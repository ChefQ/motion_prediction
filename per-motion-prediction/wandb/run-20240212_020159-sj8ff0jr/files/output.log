You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`...
