FACTS AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE

Local 1245 is the exclusive collective bargaining representative for cerlain employees of
Mirant, including Plaintiffs in this matter. Local 1245 and Mirant have executed a collective
bargaining agreement ("CBA") governing the terms and conditions of Plaintiffs' employment, to
the extent that the terms of such CBA are not inconsistent with state or federal law. Declaration
of Philip C. Monrad In Support of Motion to Dismiss ("Monrad Dec."), 2.

According to the documents in the Court file in this matter, Plaintiffs filed the Instant |
action in state court on October 17,2007. Mirant removed the action to federal court on
November 19, 2007.

On or about November 29, 2007, Mirant delivered to Local 1245 a Summons and
Mirant's Counterclaim for Declaratory Relief which is the subject of this motion. On November
30, 2007, Philip Monrad, Counsel for IBEW Local 1245, spoke with Margaret Edwards, counsel
for Mirant. Mr. Monrad agreed to accept service of the Summons and Counterclaim on behalf off
Local 1245. Ms. Edwards agreed to extend to January 11, 2007 the time for Local 1245 to

respond to the Counterclaim. Monrad Dee. { 3.

INTRODUCTION

This lawsuit involves a claim by individuals pursuing a purely state law claim against
their employer, Mirant, for violation of meal and rest breaks required by California Labor Code
statutes and the Califoria Industrial Welfare Commission's Wage Orders. As a defense, Mirant
claims that the collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") between Mirant and Local 1245 cither
waives Plaintif(s' statutory nght to meal and rest breaks, or alternatively, provides a written
agrecment making an on-duty meal period lawful under California law.

Defendant Mirant relies further on this CBA to remove this lawsuit to federal court, on
the theory that resolving this dispute requires interpretation of the CBA, and hence ts preempted
by Section 301 of the federal Labor-Management Relations Act ("LMRA"). Finally, Mirant has
filed a Counterclaim against Local 1245 itself, claiming that Local 1245 is a necessary and
indispensable party to its request for a judicial declaration that the CBA is "enforceable and not

inconsistent with or in violation of any California statute or administrative regulation."

ASe 3:07-cv-05847-PJH Document10 Filed 01/11/2008 Page 7 of 27

Mirant's Counterclaim lacks federal subject matter jurisdiction for a host of reasons.
First, a Counterclaim -even if it states a clear federal question -- does not "arise under" federal
law, as required by 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331 to establish federal question jurisdiction. Holmes Group,
lac. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Ine. 533 U.S. 826, 831 (2002).

Moreover, Mirant's Counterclaim does not state a claim over which this Court has
jurisdiction. That is because LMRA Section 301 jurisdiction does not lie over a claim, such as
this, which seeks only declaratory relief as to the validity of a CBA, without any claim thal any
party breached the CBA. Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. UAW,
523 U.S. 653 (1998).

There is also no federal question jurisdiction over this Counterclaim under LMRA

| Section 301 because that Section preempts state law claims only if the Plaintiffs' claim requires

interpretation of a CBA. Allis Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 208-13 (1985). And
despite Mirant's conclusory claims to the contrary, adjudication of Plaintiffs' claims (or for that
matter, Mirant's defenses or this Counterclaim) requires only reference to the plain and
undisputed terms of the CBA at issue here. And mere reference to this CBA does not permit
converting Plaintiffs' purely state law claims into a federal claim under Section 301.

Mirant's assertion of supplemental jurisdiction is equally without basis, because it is well
established that "supplemental jurisdiction may only be invoked when the disirict court has a
hook of original jurisdiction on which to hang it." Herman Family Revocable Trust v. Teddy
Bear, 254 F.3d 802, 805 (9th Cir, 2001). And Mirant cannot establish original jurisdiction over
the underlying claims in this lawsuit for the same reason there is no jurisdiction over its
Counterclaim. The underlying claims in this action simply do not require any imferpretation of
the CBA. Accordingly, those claims are not subject to LMRA Section 301 preemption - the
only claim for original jurisdiction which Mirant asserts - and Mirant's claim for supplemental
jurisdiction over the Counterclaim fails as well.

For these reasons, this Counterclaim against Local 1245 should be dismissed for lack of
original or supplemental jurisdiction, It should alse be dismissed or struck, as against Local

1245 because Local 1245 1s neither necessary or proper party to this action. Hence this

Counterclaim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or, in the alternative should be struck

as against Local 1245 for failure to join a necessary or proper party.

ARGUMENT

Mirant claims this Court has both original federal question subject matter jurisdiction
over this Counterclaim, and supplemental jurisdiction as well. Mirant cannot meet its burden of

showing that either of these bases for jurisdiction are present.

], Standard for reviewing a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

It is fundamental that federal courts are courts of limited Jurisdiction. They can
adjudicate only those cases which the Constitution or Congress authorize them to adjudicate.
Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). Thus, federal courts
are presumptively without jurisdiction over civil cases, and the burden of establishing the
contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction. Jd, at377. See also Lanza v. Ashcroft, 389
F.3d 917, 930 (9th Cir. 2004).

Courts reviewing a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction are "not required to accept
as true conclusory allegations which are contradicted by documents referred to in the complaint."
Steckman v, Hart Brewing, Inc., 143 F.3d 1293, 1295-96(9th Cir. 1998), and "[w]e do not...
necessarily assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they are cast in the form of

factual allegations." W. Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981),

Il. Section 301 of the LMRA provides no original jurisdiction over this

Counterclaim.

Mirani asserts original federal question jurisdiction of this Counterclaim based
exclusively on LMRA Section 301. Specifically, Mirant asserts:

This Court has original jurisdiction under Section 301 (a) of the Labor-
Management Relations Act ("LMRA), 29 U.S.C. Section 185(a), because

{2} this Counterclaim seeks interpretation of the ... CBA between Mirant and
Counter-Defendant ... IBEW Local 1245 and

/2{/ requests a declaratory judgment as to rights and obligations under the CBA."

As demonstrated below, neither of these assertions establishes federal question

jurisdiction, But as a threshold matter, tt is important first to recognize that a Counterclaim

| cannot, by itself, establish federal question jurisdiction, even if both of the assertions highlighted

above were true.

A. Federal question jurisdiction cannot be established ina

Counterclaim.

It is well settled that a defendant cannot create federal question jurisdiction simply by
filing a Counterclaim, even if that Counterclaim itself raises a federal question. That is because
Counterclaims do not "arise under" federal law, as required by 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331 for a court to
exercise federal question jurisdiction. [olmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Cireulation Sysiems,
Inc, 533 US, 826, 831 (2002); Law Fabrication, LUC v. Local 15, Sheet Metal Workers, fete. ]
AFL-CIO, 396 F.Supp.2d 1306, 1310, fn.3 (M.D. Fla, 2005): Wm. Schwarzer, et al, Federal Civil
Procedure Before Trial, 4 8.297.

Thus, according to the "well-pleaded complaint" rule, a federal question must appear in
the Complaint itself. A defendant cannot gencrate jurisdiction by making a federal claim in a
Counterclaim. To allow otherwise "would allow a defendant to remove a case brought in state
court under state law, thereby defeating a Plaintiff's choice of forum, simply by raising a federal
Counterclaim." Holmes, 533 US. al 826,

In short, this Court's original jurisdiction aver Mirant's Counterclaim depends on Mirant
first showing that Plaintiff's Complaint is subject to federal question jurisdiction, and then alsa
showing that the Counterclaim is subject to federal question jurisdiction as well. Mirant does not
even attempt to make the first showing, but it is clear as a matter of law that Mirant cannot show
either that Plaintiffs' Complaint er Mirant's Counterclaim are subject to original federal question
jurisdiction under LMRA Section 301, for the same reason - neither of them require

interpretation of the CBA between Local 1245 and Mirant.

BE. There is no LMRA Section 301 jurisdiction over this Counterclaim
because neither the Counterclaim nor Plaintiffs' underlying claims require

interpretation of the CBA.

Mirant's first claim for original jurisdiction under LMRA Section 301 is based on its
conclusory claim that "this Counterclaim seeks interpretation of the CBA." This assertion is,
indeed, essential to cstablishing federal question jurisdiction under LMRA Section 301, both for
Plaintiffs' underlying claim, and also for Mirant's Counterclaim. But this assertion is patently
false, as a matter of law.

Mirant's claim that "this Counterclaim seeks interpretation of the CBA" is essential to its
claim for Section 301 jurisdiction because Plaintiffs' Complaint states only California Labor
Code claims. The only way those claims can possibly be characterized as "arising under"
federal law is if they fall within the line of "Section 301 preemption" cases based on Allis
Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S, 202, 208-13 (1985). As recently confirmed by the Ninth
Circuit, these cases hold that state law claims will be treated as claims "arising under" LMRA
Section 301: 1) "if the asserted state right exists solely as a result of [a] CBA" or 2) "if... the
right exists independently of the CBA... [it] is nevertheless substantially dependent on
analysis of a [CBA]" Burnside v. Kiewitt Pacific Corp. 491 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9" Cir, 2007),
emphasis added.

Mirant's claim that "this Counterclaim secks interpretation of the CBA" is intended to
trigger this second prong of Section 301 preemption. But Mirant overlooks the fundamental
principal that, "to determine whether a state law right is "substantially dependent" on the terms
ofa CBA... the [Supreme] Court directs us to decide whether the claim can be resolved by
"loakfing] te" versus interpreting the CBA." /d., 491 F.3d at 1060, emphasis added.

 

' Although Mirant's Counterclaim fails to mention this statute, Mirant's claim for
original jurisdiction under LMRA 0x00A7 301 necessarily depends on the federal question jurisdiction
statute at 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331, which authorizes federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over civil
actions "arising under" federal law.
