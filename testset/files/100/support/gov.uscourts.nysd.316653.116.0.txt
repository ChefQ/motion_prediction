Filed 01/10/13 Page 7 of 27

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Lead Plaintiff, Pipefitters Union
Local 537 Pension Fund, respectfully moves this Court for an order approving the proposed
settlement of this class action (the "Litigation"), and approving the proposed Plan of Allocation of
settlement proceeds. 1
Under the terms of the proposed settlement (the "Settlement"), as set forth in the Stipulation,
Defendants have caused the sum of $67,500,000 in cash to be paid into an interest-bearing escrow
account maintained on behalf of the Class, in exchange for the dismissal of all claims brought
against the Defendants in this Litigation. This Settlement represents an excellent recovery for the
Class particularly in light of the considerable expense, delay, and risks posed by continued litigation,
including successfully opposing summary judgment, prevailing at trial, and litigating inevitable posttrial appeals. As discussed below and in the accompanying Declaration of Tor Gronborg in Support
of Lead Plaintiff's Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement and Plan of Allocation of
Settlement Proceeds and Award of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses and Lead Plaintiff's Expenses
Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(a)(4) ("Gronborg Decl."), the significant risks involved in taking this
Litigation further and through trial, when measured against the immediate benefit of the Settlement,
justify approval of this Settlement.
On November 20, 2012, the Court entered its Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement and
Providing for Notice (Dkt. No. 114) ("Preliminary Approval Order"), which directed that a hearing
be held on March 1, 2013 to determine the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement.
In accordance with the Preliminary Approval Order, the Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class

Unless otherwise noted, all capitalized terms used herein are defined in the November 7,
1
2012 Settlement Agreement (the "Stipulation"). Dkt. No. 112.
-1797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 8 of 27

Action (the "Notice") was mailed to over 302,000 potential Class Members as of January 8, 2013.

See Declaration of Carole K. Sylvester Re A) Mailing of the Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class
Action and the Proof of Claim Form, B) Publication of the Summary Notice, and C) Internet Posting
("Sylvester Decl."), ¶¶3-10.
Also, the Notice, the Proof of Claim form, the Stipulation and its Exhibits, and the
Preliminarily Approval Order were posted on the Claims Administrator's website, and pursuant to
the Preliminary Approval Order a Summary Notice was published in Investor's Business Daily and
over Business Wire on December 7, 2012. See Sylvester Decl., ¶¶12-13.
In light of their informed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and
defenses asserted, the considerable risks and delays associated with continued litigation and trial, and
the significant settlement amount, Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel believe that the Settlement is
eminently fair, reasonable, and adequate and provides an outstanding result for the Class.
Accordingly, Lead Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court approve this Settlement. Moreover,
the Plan of Allocation, which was developed with the assistance of Lead Plaintiff's economics and
damages experts, is fair and reasonable and, therefore, should also be approved by the Court.

II. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The Court is respectfully referred to the accompanying Gronborg Declaration for a full
discussion of the factual background and procedural history of the Litigation, the extensive litigation
efforts of Lead Counsel, a discussion of the negotiations leading to this Settlement, and the reasons
why the Settlement and Plan of Allocation are fair and reasonable and should be approved.

III. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS FAIR, REASONABLE, AND
ADEQUATE
A.

Settlements Are Favored and Encouraged

The court may approve a "class action settlement if it is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and
not a product of collusion." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 116 (2d Cir.
2005). The evaluation of a proposed settlement requires the court to consider "both the settlement's
terms and the negotiating process leading to settlement." Wal-Mart Stores, 396 F.3d at 116. While
the decision to grant or deny approval of a settlement lies within the broad discretion of the trial
court, a general policy favoring settlement exists, especially with respect to class actions.

Taft v.

Ackermans, No. 02 Civ. 7951 (PKL), 2007 WL 414493, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2007); see also
Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 73 (2d Cir. 1982) (The settlement of complex class action
litigations are clearly favored by the courts.). Moreover, "[c]lass action suits readily lend themselves
to compromise because of the difficulties of proof, the uncertainties of the outcome, and the typical
length of the litigation." In re Luxottica Grp. S.p.A. Sec. Litig., 233 F.R.D. 306, 310 (E.D.N.Y.
2006); see also Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 73 ("There are weighty justifications, such as the reduction
of litigation and related expenses, for the general policy favoring the settlement of litigation.

").

Recognizing that a settlement represents an exercise of judgment by the negotiating parties,
the Second Circuit has cautioned that, while a court should not give "rubber stamp approval" to a
proposed settlement, it must "stop short of the detailed and thorough investigation that it would
undertake if it were actually trying the case." Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 462 (2d Cir.
1974). As stated by the Second Circuit in Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689 (2d Cir. 1972),
the role of a court in passing upon the propriety of the settlement of a derivative or
other class action is a delicate one.... [W]e recognized that since "the very purpose
of a compromise is to avoid the trial of sharply disputed issues and to dispense with
wasteful litigation', the court must not turn the settlement hearing `into a trial or a
rehearsal of the trial'."

Id. at 691-92 (citation omitted).
B.

The Settlement Is Presumptively Fair

A strong initial presumption of fairness attaches to the proposed settlement if it is reached by
experienced counsel after arm's-length negotiations, and great weight is accorded to the
recommendations of counsel, who are most closely acquainted with the facts of the underlying
litigation. Luxottica Grp., 233 F.R.D. at 315; see also In re Alloy, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 03 Civ. 1597
(WHP), 2004 WL 2750089, at * 1-*2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2004). A court may find the negotiating
process is fair where, as here, "the settlement resulted from 'arm's-length negotiations and that
plaintiffs' counsel have possessed the experience and ability ... necessary to effective representation
of the class's interests. " D'Amato v. Deutsche Bank, 236 F.3d 78, 85 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation
omitted).
This initial presumption of fairness and adequacy applies in this case because the Settlement
was reached by experienced, fully-informed counsel after arm's-length negotiations with the
assistance of a highly experienced mediator, the Honorable Layn R. Phillips (Ret.). Gronborg Decl.,
¶¶4, 75. "So long as the integrity of the arm's length negotiation process is preserved ... a strong
initial presumption of fairness attaches to the proposed settlement." In re Paine Webber Ltd. P'ships
Litig., 171 F.R.D. 104, 125 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 117 F.3d 721 (2d Cir. 1997). In addition, Lead
Counsel was unquestionably fully informed of the merits and weaknesses of the case at the time the
Settlement was reached. Lead Counsel had conducted an extensive factual investigation of Lead
Plaintiff's claims, including significant document and deposition discovery from Defendants and
third parties, and had retained and consulted with numerous experts and consultants.

See, e.g.,

Gronborg Decl., ¶¶45-64. Moreover, following the first phase of bifurcated discovery on the issues
of materiality and statistical significance, the parties attended a face-to-face settlement and discovery
-4797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 11 of 27

meeting where each side presented their respective positions on the merits of the case, along with
supporting evidence and expert presentations. Thus, this Settlement is entitled to the presumption of
procedural fairness dictated by Second Circuit law.
C.

The Settlement Meets the Second Circuit Requirements for Approval

There are nine factors the Second Circuit has identified to determine whether to approve a
proposed settlement of a class action:
(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of
the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of
discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of
establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial;
(7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of
reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; [and]
(9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light
of all the attendant risks of litigation.
Grinnell, 495 F.2d at 463 (citations omitted). All nine factors need not be satisfied. Rather, the
Court should look at the totality of these factors in light of the specific circumstances involved. In re
Global Crossing Sec. & ERISA Litig., 225 F.R.D. 436, 456 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).
As demonstrated below and in the Gronborg Declaration, the Settlement meets each of the
relevant criteria set forth above.
1.

The Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of the
Litigation Justifies the Settlement

"The expense and possible duration of the litigation should be considered in evaluating the
reasonableness of [a] settlement." Milstein v. Huck, 600 F. Supp. 254, 267 (E.D.N.Y. 1984). In this
case, the securities claims advanced by the Lead Plaintiff involve complex legal and factual issues.
Lead Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated federal securities laws by making misleading
statements to investors about one of Wyeth's leading drug candidates, Pristiq for the treatment of
vasomotor symptoms ("VMS"), and failing to disclose safety concerns about the drug to investors.
-5797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 12 of 27

Proof of these claims would require, inter alia, extensive expert testimony, including testimony from
experts with medical, pharmacological, and biostatistics expertise.
The legal issues proving materiality, scienter, loss causation, and damages are equally
complex, and would also require extensive percipient and expert testimony. Here, as in other similar
cases involving violations of the federal securities laws, " [i]t is beyond cavil that continued
litigation ... would be complex, lengthy, and expensive, with no guarantee of recovery by the
[C]lass [M]embers." Strougo v. Bassini, 258 F. Supp. 2d 254, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (quoting Trief
v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 840 F. Supp. 277, 282 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)); see also In re Indep. Energy
Holdings PLC, No. 00 Civ. 6689 (SAS), 2003 WL 22244676, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2003)
(noting necessity of completing expert discovery, summary judgment briefing, joint pre-trial order,
in limine motions, trial, and post-trial appeals weighed in favor of settlement).
Settling the Litigation at this time will undoubtedly spare all litigants the delay and expense
of continued litigation. Many hours of the Court's time and resources required to see this case
through trial will also be spared. Moreover, at the time of the Settlement, Defendants had filed a
Rule 23(f) petition with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Had Defendants' position been
accepted and granted, any potential recovery by the Class would have been in jeopardy. Even if the
Class could obtain a larger judgment after a trial, the additional delay through likely post-trial
motions and appeals could deny the Class any recovery for years, which would further reduce its
value. See Strougo, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 261 ("even if a shareholder or class member was willing to
assume all the risks of pursuing the actions through further litigation ... the passage of time would
introduce yet more risks ... and would, in light of the time value of money, make future recoveries
less valuable than this current recovery"); Hicks v. Morgan Stanley, No. 01 Civ. 10071 (RJH), 2005
WL 2757792, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2005) ("Further litigation would necessarily involve further
-6797276_1

Filed 01/10/13 Page 13 of 27

costs [and] justice may be best served with a fair settlement today as opposed to an uncertain future
settlement or trial of the action.

").

The Settlement for $67,500,000, at this juncture, results in an immediate and substantial
tangible recovery, without the considerable risk, expense, and delay of trial. Therefore, Lead
Plaintiff submits that the Court should find that this factor weighs heavily in favor of the proposed
Settlement.
2.

The Reaction of the Class to the Settlement

The reaction of the class to the settlement is a significant factor in assessing its fairness and
adequacy, and "the absence of objectants may itself be taken as evidencing the fairness of a
settlement." PaineWebber, 171 F.R.D. at 126 (citation omitted); see also Luxottica Grp., 233
F.R.D. at 311-12. Notices describing the nature of the Litigation and the terms of the Settlement,
were distributed to over 302,000 potential Class Members. Sylvester Decl., ¶1J3-10. As of the date
this motion was filed, no objections to the Settlement have been received, no institutional investors
have opted out of the proposed Settlement, and no individual investors have opted out. 2 However,
the Court-ordered deadline set for objections is January 28, 2013. Accordingly, if Lead Counsel
receive any objections to the Settlement or Plan of Allocation, they will be addressed in Lead
Plaintiffs reply brief scheduled to be filed on February 14, 2013.

As of the date of this filing, Lead Counsel and the Claims Administrator have received 47
requests from individuals to be excluded from the Litigation. None of these requests represent a
valid opt out, as the individuals either stated that they did not acquire Wyeth common stock during
the Class Period (and, thus, are not members of the Class) or failed to provide any information to
establish whether they are eligible class members as required by the Notice (i. e., number of shares
purchased/sold during the Class Period and proper evidence of transactions during the Class Period).

The Stage of the Proceedings and Discovery Completed

"There is no precise formula for what constitutes sufficient evidence to enable the court to
analyze intelligently the contested questions of fact. It is clear that the court need not possess
evidence to decide the merits of the issue, because the compromise is proposed in order to avoid
further litigation.... At minimum, the court must possess sufficient information to raise its decision
above mere conjecture." 4 Alba Conte, Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 11.45, at
127, 128 (4th ed. 2002). As previously noted, "[f]ormal discovery is not a prerequisite; the question
is whether the parties had adequate information about their claims." Global Crossing, 225 F.R.D. at
458. See also In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 176 (S.D.N.Y.
2000) (not necessary for court to find parties engaged in extensive discovery; must merely find that
they engaged in sufficient investigation to enable court to make intelligent appraisal of case) (citing

236 F.3d 78 (2d Cir. 2001).
The volume and substance of Lead Counsel's knowledge of this case are unquestionably
adequate to support the Settlement. In drafting a cogent well-pled complaint, that withstood
Defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration, Lead Counsel conducted an extensive
investigation and informal discovery, including the: (i) review and analysis of filings made by,
and/or concerning, Wyeth with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Food
and Drug Administration ("FDA"); (ii) review and analysis of analyst conference calls concerning
Wyeth and other pharmaceutical companies; (iii) review and analysis of analysts' reports concerning
Wyeth and other pharmaceutical companies; and (iv) review and analysis of wire and press releases,
public statements, news articles, and other publications disseminated by, and/or concerning, Wyeth.

Filed 01/10/13 Page 15 of 27

Following denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss, Lead Plaintiff served document requests
on Defendants and more than a dozen securities analysts and other third party entities with relevant
information concerning Wyeth's activities during the Class Period. In response to these requests for
documents, Defendants produced more than 1.3 million pages of documents, which were reviewed
and analyzed by Lead Counsel. An additional 52,000 pages of documents were produced or
provided by third parties, including financial analysts and the European Medicines Agency
("EMA"). Lead Counsel deposed three former/current Wyeth employees, including two Wyeth
corporate representatives, deposed Defendants' market efficiency and damages expert, and prepared
for over 20 additional depositions, including the deposition of each Defendant. The parties also
engaged in a face-to-face meeting in June 2011 to address discovery issues and discuss potential
settlement, during which each party presented their respective positions and evidence supporting
their claims and defenses and had the opportunity to question each other's biostatistics consultants.
To assist Lead Counsel with the prosecution and analysis of this case, experts and
consultants, including a physician, two biostatisticians, an FDA expert, and economics and damages
experts were retained and consulted. With their assistance, Lead Counsel were able to critically
analyze document discovery, determine additional areas of investigation to pursue, meet with
defense counsel and the mediator to discuss the issues in the case, and draft a cogent and persuasive
mediation brief, which set forth Lead Plaintiff s theory of its case, and the facts supporting its
position.
The extensive investigation and discovery that Lead Counsel conducted, therefore, provided
a strong basis to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their case, the parties' positions on liability
and damages, and to knowledgeably assess a possible settlement. Thus, this Litigation had advanced
to a stage where the parties certainly "have a clear view of the strengths and weaknesses of their

cases." Teachers'Ret. Sys. ofLa. v. A. C. L.N., Ltd., No. 01-CV-11814 (MP), 2004 WL 1087261, at
*3 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2004) (citation omitted); see also Heyer v. NY. City Hous. Auth., No. 80 Civ.
1196 (RWS), 2006 WL 1148689, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2006) (although only limited
discovery was completed before settlement negotiations began, the familiarity of counsel for all
parties with the case justifies settlement). Therefore, the Court should find that this factor further
supports approval of the Settlement.
4.

The Risk of Establishing Liability

In assessing the Settlement, the Court should balance the benefits afforded the Class,
including the immediacy and certainty of a recovery, against the continuing risks of litigation. See
Grinnell, 495 F.2d at 463. While Lead Plaintiff believes it could survive Defendants' anticipated
motion for summary judgment, it recognizes that ultimate success is not assured, and further believes
that this substantial Settlement, when viewed in light of the risks of proving liability, is fair,
adequate, and reasonable. See In re Michael Milken & Assocs. Sec. Litig., 150 F.R.D. 46, 53
(S.D.N.Y. 1993) (when evaluating securities class action settlements, courts have long recognized
such litigation to be "notably difficult and notoriously uncertain") (quoting Lewis v. Newman, 59
F.R.D. 525, 528 (S.D.N.Y. 1973)); In re Bear Stearns Cos., Inc. Sec., Derivative and ERISA Litig.,
No. 08 MDL 1963, 2012 WL 5465381, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2012) ("As a general rule, securities
class actions are `notably difficult and notoriously uncertain' to litigate.")
Despite the strengths of Lead Plaintiff's case, it faced numerous hurdles to establishing
liability. This Litigation involves claims for relief under federal securities laws and, to prevail, Lead
Plaintiff must demonstrate that Defendants made misstatements or omissions of material fact with
scienter in connection with the purchase of securities and that the Defendants intentionally engaged

-10797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 17 of 27

in this conduct for the purpose of misleading investors. 3 Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185,
193 n.12 (1976).
Defendants have maintained throughout the Litigation that the evidence would demonstrate
that they did not make any misleading statements or omissions and that they did not act with the
requisite state of mind. While Lead Counsel believe that Defendants made misstatements and
omissions of material fact, and that evidence produced by Defendants would support an inference of
scienter, some of the evidence might also be interpreted as supporting Defendants' position that their
statements were not actionable under the federal securities laws. Specifically, Defendants
continuously maintained that there was no intent to deceive shareholders and that they believed
Pristiq was a safe, effective treatment for VMS. Defendants also maintained that during the Class
Period cardiovascular safety data was fully disclosed and that they reasonably believed that the
allegedly omitted data was not material to the safety of Pristiq as it was not statistically significant.
Defendants also were adamant that their Class Period stock sales were insufficient to support
scienter because they either did not sell any stock, sold a small percentage of their total holdings, or
sold their shares as they were retiring from Wyeth. Defendants also argued that Lead Plaintiff could
not establish any plausible motive to support its allegations that Defendants knowingly committed
securities fraud.
Even if Defendants' defenses could be overcome, Lead Plaintiff would have to make the
requisite showings of loss causation. See, e.g., Emergent Capital Inv. Mgmt., LLC v. Stonepath

Proof of scienter can be established: "(a) by alleging facts to show that defendants had both
motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or (b) by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial
evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness. " Whalen v. Hibernia Foods PLC, No. 04 Civ.
3182, 2005 WL 1799370, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2005) (citation omitted).

Grp., Inc., 343 F.3d 189,196-97 (2d Cir. 2003) (plaintiffs required to plead and prove loss causation
and proximate causation). Lead Plaintiff faced a significant hurdle to prove loss causation, i.e., that
Defendants' fraud caused Lead Plaintiff and the Class to suffer economic loss. Under the Supreme
Court's holding in Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 338 (2005), a "private plaintiff who
claims securities fraud must prove that the defendant's fraud caused an economic loss." As they did
in their Rule 23 (f) petition, at summary judgment and trial, Defendants would have argued that any
losses suffered by Class Members on the purchases of Wyeth common stock were completely
attributable to other factors and not the alleged misstatements.
By the time the parties agreed on the proposed Settlement, Lead Counsel had come to the
conclusion that the evidence indicated that the defenses described above might have a certain jury
appeal, and would render the inherently difficult burden of proving the elements of Lead Plaintiffs
claims as to all of the Defendants even more difficult. While Lead Plaintiff remained confident in its
ability to ultimately prove its claims and to counter any asserted affirmative defenses, the risks of
this Litigation being dismissed at the summary judgment stage, or of losing at trial, when weighed
against the immediate and substantial benefits of settlement, established that the Settlement is in the
best interest of the Class.
5.

The Risk of Establishing Damages

Lead Plaintiff also faced substantial risk in proving damages. See Indep. Energy, 2003 WL
22244676, at * 3-*4 (noting difficulty of proving damages in securities cases). In order to prevail on
its § 10(b) claims, Lead Counsel would be required to prove that the Defendants' misleading
statements and omissions inflated the price of Wyeth stock, and would also be required to prove the
amount of the artificial inflation. Lead Counsel, with the assistance of their economics and damages
experts, have calculated the artificial inflation in the market price of Wyeth stock, that, in their
-12797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 19 of 27

opinion, is attributable to the alleged wrongdoing. This figure assumes that every element of the
Class's damages theory is accepted by ajury as being correct and recoverable. As such, its viability
as an actual calculation for damages could be affected by many factors that might arise in continued
litigation, such as Defendants' rebuttals and defenses to Lead Plaintiffs damage calculations and
expert testimony.
The proof of damages is a complex matter that would require the presentation of expert
testimony. As a result, Lead Counsel knew that the Class would ultimately face a "battle of experts"
— a battle in which no party is ever assured to prevail. While Lead Counsel believe that reliable and
convincing expert testimony can be provided on the damages question, and that a judgment could
ultimately be obtained for the full amount of damages available under the law, meaningful obstacles
remain. First, the Court must determine that Lead Plaintiffs damages model is admissible — and
only then may a jury determine whether Lead Plaintiff's or Defendants' model is more accurate.
The Class was by no means assured of a ruling in their favor. See, e.g., In re Novatel Wireless Sec.
Litig., 846 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 1107 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (loss causation expert's testimony was excluded

because he employed the wrong legal standard in performing his loss causation analysis). It is
possible that, in the unavoidable "battle of experts," ajury might disagree with the Class's expert, or
find Defendants' expert more persuasive. 4 As a result of the aforementioned considerations, the

See, e.g., PaineWebber, 171 F.R.D. at 129 (noting unpredictability of outcome of battle of
damage experts); In re Warner Commc'ns Sec. Litig., 618 F. Supp. 735, 744-45 (S.D.N.Y. 1985)

("In this `battle of experts,' it is virtually impossible to predict with any certainty which testimony
would be credited, and ultimately, which damages would be found to have been caused by
actionable, rather than the myriad nonactionable factors such as general market conditions."), aff'd,
798 F.2d 35 (2d Cir. 1986). See also In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 239 (3d Cir. 2001)
("establishing damages at trial would lead to a `battle of experts' ... with no guarantee whom the
jury would believe").
-13797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 20 of 27

likelihood of proving damages, even assuming the Class prevailed on the liability issues, is difficult.
As a result, this factor also weighs in favor of the Settlement.
6.

The Risks of Maintaining the Class Action Through Trial

Although the Court certified the Class on September 18, 2012, if the Litigation had not
settled, there would be no assurance of maintaining class status through trial, since courts may
always exercise their discretion to re-evaluate the appropriateness of class certification at any time.
See Chatelain v. Prudential-Bache Sec., 805 F. Supp. 209,214 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) ("Even if certified,

the class would face the risk of decertification."); see also Berger v. Compaq Computer Corp., 257
F.3d 475 (5th Cir. 2001) (decertifying class, finding proposed class representatives did not
sufficiently remain apprised of status and claims of litigation). In fact, at the time the Settlement was
reached, Defendants' Rule 23(f) petition for interlocutory appeal was pending before the Second
Circuit. The Settlement avoids any uncertainty with respect to this issue.
7.

The Ability of the Defendants to Withstand a Greater
Judgment

The ability of a defendant to pay ajudgment greater than the amount offered in a settlement
can be relevant to whether a settlement is fair. Grinnell, 495 F.2d at 463. The fact, however, that a
defendant is able to pay more than it offers in settlement, does not, standing alone, indicate that the
settlement is unreasonable or inadequate. See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516,
538 (3d Cir. 2004) ("[T]he fact that DuPont could afford to pay more does not mean that it is
obligated to pay any more than what the .... class members are entitled to under the theories of
liability that existed at the time the settlement was reached."); In re Sony SXRD Rear Projection
Television ClassAction Litig., No. 06 Civ. 5173 (RPP), 2008 WL 1956267, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 1,

2008) ("a defendant is not required to `empty its coffers' before a settlement can be found

-14797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 21 of 27

adequate"); In re Wachovia Equity Sec. Litig., No. 08 Civ. 6171(RJS), 2012 WL 2774969, at *5
(S.D.N.Y. June 12, 2012) (same).
Wyeth is now owned by Pfizer Inc. While it is apparent that Pfizer has sufficient resources
to pay a sum larger than the settlement amount, as discussed above, as a practical matter the
prospects of recovering a substantially greater sum would have been offset by the inevitable post
trial motions and appeals Defendants would likely pursue following any judgment. Additionally,
settlement eliminates the risk of collection. Defendants have paid the Settlement Fund into escrow
pursuant to the Stipulation which is already earning interest for the Class.
8.

The Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the Best
Possible Recovery and the Attendant Risks of Litigation

The last two factors are satisfied here. The adequacy of the amount offered in settlement
must be judged "not in comparison with the possible recovery in the best of all possible worlds, but
rather in light of the strengths and weaknesses of plaintiffs' case." In re "Agent Orange" Prod.

Liab. Litig., 597 F. Supp. 740,762 (E.D.N.Y. 1984), aff'd, 818 F.2d 145 (2d Cir. 1987). The Court
need only determine whether the Settlement falls within a "range of reasonableness."

Paine Webber, 171 F.R.D. at 130 (citation omitted); Newman, 464 F.2d at 693 ("[I]n any case there is
a range of reasonableness with respect to a settlement.

").

See also Indep. Energy, 2003 WL

22244676, at *4 (noting few cases tried before a jury result in full amount of damages claimed). In
addition, in considering the reasonableness of the Settlement, the Court should consider that the
Settlement provides for payment to the Class now, rather than a speculative payment many years
down the road. See In re AOL Time Warner, Inc. Sec. & "ERISA " Litig., No. MDL 1500, 2006 WL
903236, at * 13 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2006) (where settlement fund is in escrow and earning interest for
the class, "the benefit of the Settlement will ... be realized far earlier than a hypothetical post-trial
recovery"). There are numerous risks involved in litigation — especially litigation that involves the
-15797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 22 of 27

complex issues inherent in securities class actions. In light of the complex legal and factual issues
typically present in securities class actions, the unpredictability of a lengthy and complex trial, and
the appellate process that would most likely follow, the fairness of a substantial settlement is clearly
apparent. Maley v. Del Global Techs. Corp., 186 F. Supp. 2d 358, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Here, the
Settlement of $67,500,000 in cash represents an excellent recovery for the Class, given the risks of
proceeding further in this matter.
Considering the probability of lengthy litigation in the absence of a settlement, the risk that
the Class might not have been able to succeed on liability, and the possibility that damages awarded
by a jury could have been lower than those demanded by the Class (or no recovery at all), the
Settlement is an excellent recovery.
In sum, the Grinnell factors, individually and collectively, weigh strongly in favor of the
Settlement being approved.
IV. THE PLAN OF ALLOCATION IS FAIR AND REASONABLE
If the Court approves the proposed Settlement, upon completion of the claims filing process,
the Net Settlement Fund will be distributed to Members of the Class according to the Plan of
Allocation set forth in the Notice. "[T]he adequacy of an allocation plan turns on whether counsel
has properly apprised itself of the merits of all claims, and whether the proposed apportionment is
fair and reasonable in light of that information." PaineWebber, 171 F.R.D. at 133; Luxottica Grp.,
233 F.R.D. at 316-17. See also Taft, 2007 WL 414493, at *9• As with the Settlement, the opinion of
experienced and informed counsel carries considerable weight. Indep. Energy, 2003 WL 22244676,
at *4-* 5. An allocation formula need only have a reasonable basis, particularly if recommended by
experienced class counsel. White v. NFL, 822 F. Supp. 1389, 1420-24 (D. Minn. 1993); In re Am.
Bank Note Holographics, 127 F. Supp. 2d 418, 429-30 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).
-16797276_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 116

Filed 01/10/13 Page 23 of 27

District courts enjoy "broad supervisory powers over the administration of class-action
settlements to allocate the proceeds among the claiming class members ... equitably." Beecher v.

Able, 575 F.2d 1010, 1016 (2d Cir. 1978). Numerous courts have approved distribution plans that
allocate the settlement proceeds according to the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various
claims. See Warner Commc'ns, 618 F. Supp. at 745; Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 78. Thus, "if one set
of claims had a greater likelihood of ultimate success than another set of claims, it is appropriate to
weigh `distribution of the settlement ... in favor of plaintiffs whose claims comprise the set' that
was more likely to succeed." In re "Agent Orange" Prod. L iab. L itig. , 611 F. Supp. 1.396, 1411
(E.D.N.Y. 1985) (quoting In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 643 F.2d 195, 220 (5th Cir.
1981)), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 818 F.2d 179 (2d Cir. 1987). Moreover,
there is no requirement that a settlement must benefit all class members equally.

See Petrovic v.

AMOCO Oil Co., 200 F.3d 1140, 1152 (8th Cir. 1999) (upholding distribution plan where class
members received different levels of compensation and finding that no subgroup was treated
unfairly); S.C. Nat'l Bank v. Stone, 749 F. Supp. 1419, 1437 (D.S.C. 1990) (approving settlement
where some class members did not share in recovery).
The decisions cited above acknowledge that the goal of a distribution plan is fairness to the
class as a whole, taking into consideration the strength of claims based on available evidence. Here,
experienced and informed counsel formulated the Plan of Allocation with their economics and
damages experts, which involved careful assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of Lead
Plaintiffs claims, as well as assessments of the manner in which the damages should be allocated to
the Class in light of those strengths and weaknesses. As a result, the Plan of Allocation clearly has a
"reasonable, rational basis" and should be approved by the Court. Global Crossing, 225 F.R.D. at
462 (citation omitted).
