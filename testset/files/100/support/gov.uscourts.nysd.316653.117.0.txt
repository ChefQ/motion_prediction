INTRODUCTION
Lead Counsel have succeeded in obtaining a cash Settlement Fund of $67,500,000 for the

benefit of the Class.' Lead Counsel achieved this substantial recovery solely through skill,
persistence, and effective advocacy in the face of considerable risk. As compensation for their
efforts in achieving this result, Lead Counsel respectfully move this Court for an award of attorneys'
fees of 24.5% of the Settlement Fund, plus expenses incurred in the prosecution of the Litigation in
the amount of $461,050.19. In addition, Lead Counsel request approval of reimbursement for time
and expenses of Lead Plaintiff incurred in prosecuting the alleged fraud in the amount of $4,526.25.
Lead Counsel's prosecution of this Litigation spanned almost five years and was risky and
difficult from the outset. Settlement was only reached after Lead Counsel successfully defeated
Defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration, obtained class certification,
aggressively pursued discovery, consulted with medical, biostatistics, FDA, loss causation, and
damages experts, and engaged in arduous, arm's-length settlement negotiations with the assistance
of a mediator for over a period of nearly six months. Lead Counsel filed this action in 2007. Shortly
thereafter, Pipefitters Union Local 537 Pension Fund was appointed Lead Plaintiff. No other party
moved to be lead plaintiff and no other counsel sought to be lead counsel. Had Lead Plaintiff and
Lead Counsel not been tenacious in bringing and pursuing this action, it is doubtful that Class
Members would have recovered anything from Defendants.
The Litigation is subject to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 ("PSLRA"), the effect of which has been to make it harder for investors to bring and
successfully prosecute allegations of securities fraud. A study of securities class actions filed after

2012 Settlement Agreement (the "Stipulation"). Dkt. No. 112.
-1797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 11 of 36

the passage of the PSLRA between 1996 through 2011, found that 32% of the cases that reached the
point of a motion to dismiss were dismissed in defendants' favor. 2 Here, Lead Plaintiff and Lead
Counsel faced and overcame not only this very real risk but also the additional risk of class
certification and reached a substantial settlement for the benefit of the Class. Lead Counsel firmly
believe that the settlement is a result of their diligent and effective advocacy, as well as their
reputations as attorneys who are unwavering in their dedication to the interests of the class and
unafraid to zealously prosecute a meritorious case through trial.
The substantial efforts of Lead Counsel in achieving this settlement are set forth in detail in
the Declaration of Tor Gronborg in Support of Lead Plaintiff's Motion for Final Approval of Class
Action Settlement and Plan of Allocation of Settlement Proceeds and Award of Attorneys' Fees and
Expenses and Lead Plaintiff's Expenses Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง78u-4(a)(4) ("Gronborg Decl."),
submitted herewith. Counsel in this action and their paraprofessionals combined have expended
over 6,800 hours in the prosecution of this Litigation with a resulting lodestar of more than $3.9
million. Lead Counsel undertook the representation of the Class on a contingent fee basis and no
payment has been made to date for their services or for the litigation expenses they have advanced
on behalf of the Class.
Importantly, the amount of the fee request was approved by Lead Plaintiff, who is an
experienced institutional investor with a financial stake in the outcome of the Litigation, and who is
the paradigmatic fiduciary for the Class that Congress envisioned in enacting the PSLRA. Such
endorsement strongly weighs in favor of approving the requested fee.

See Securities Class Action Filings โ 2011 Year in Review, at 18 (Cornerstone Research
2012), attached as Exhibit 1 to the accompanying Compendium of Unreported and Secondary
Authorities Cited in Support of Lead Counsel's Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and
Expenses and Lead Plaintiff's Expenses Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง78u-4(a)(4) ("Compendium").

The reaction of the Class to date also weighs in favor of the requested fee. Pursuant to the
Court's Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement and Providing for Notice (Dkt. No. 114), more
than 302,000 copies of the detailed Court-approved Notice have been mailed to potential Class
Members and nominees, and the Summary Notice has been published in a leading business
publication and widely disseminated over the Internet through Business Wire. See Declaration of
Carole K. Sylvester Re A) Mailing of the Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action and the
Proof of Claim Form, B) Publication of the Summary Notice, and C) Internet Posting ("Sylvester
Decl."), ยถยถ3-10,13. The Notice advised Class Members that Lead Counsel would seek an attorneys'
fee award of 24.5% of the Settlement Fund, plus expenses not to exceed $650,000 plus interest
thereon. Although the January 28, 2013 deadline for objecting to the requested fees and expenses
has not yet passed, to date no such objections have been received.
For all the reasons set forth herein and in the Gronborg Declaration, Lead Counsel
respectfully submit that the requested attorneys' fees are fair and reasonable under the applicable
legal standards and should be awarded by the Court.
II. LEAD COUNSEL'S REQUESTED FEE IS FAIR AND REASONABLE
AND SHOULD BE APPROVED
A.

Lead Counsel Are Entitled to a Reasonable Percentage of the
Common Fund

The Supreme Court has long recognized that "a litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common
fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney's
fee from the fund as a whole." Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S. 472, 478 (1980). The purpose
of the common fund doctrine is to fairly and adequately compensate class counsel for services
rendered and to ensure that all class members contribute equally towards the costs associated with
litigation pursued on their behalf. See Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., 209 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir.
-3797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

2000); Cent. States SE & SWAreas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C.,
504 F.3d 229, 249 (2d Cir. 2007).
Indeed, for nearly 50 years the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that private
securities actions provide "a most effective weapon in the enforcement' of the securities laws and
are `a necessary supplement to [SEC] action. " Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472
U.S. 299, 310 (1985) (quoting J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 432 (1964)).
Courts in this Circuit and District have consistently adhered to these teachings. See In re

Interpublic Sec. Litig., No. 02 Civ. 6527 (DLC), 2004 WL 2397190, at * 10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 2004)
("It is well established that where an attorney creates a common fund from which members of a class
are compensated for a common injury, the attorneys who created the fund are entitled to `a
reasonable fee โ set by the court โ to be taken from the fund.") (citation omitted).
B.

The Court Should Award a Reasonable Percentage of the Common
Fund to Lead Counsel

The Second Circuit has expressly approved the "percentage-of-the-fund" method for awards
of fees in common fund cases, recognizing that "the lodestar method proved vexing" and had
resulted in "an inevitable waste of judicial resources." Goldberger, 209 F.3d at 48, 49; see also

Savoie v. Merchs. Bank, 166 F.3d 456,460 (2d Cir. 1999) (the "percentage-of-the-fund method has
been deemed a solution to certain problems that may arise when the lodestar method is used in
common fund cases"); Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 903* (1984) ("In tort suits, an attorney might
receive one-third of whatever amount the plaintiff recovers. In those cases, therefore, the fee is
directly proportional to the recovery.") (concurring) (citation omitted). The Second Circuit
recognized how the percentage method "directly aligns the interests of the class and its counsel and
provides a powerful incentive for the efficient prosecution and early resolution of litigation," and
noted that the "trend in this Circuit is toward the percentage method." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa

Given the language of the PSLRA, the Supreme Court's indication that the percentage
method is proper in this type of case, the Second Circuit's explicit approval of the percentage
method, and the trend among the district courts in this Circuit, it is appropriate for the Court to
award Lead Counsel attorneys' fees based on a percentage of the fund.

The Requested Fee Is Well Within the Range of What Courts Have
Found to Be Fair and Reasonable Under the Percentage Method

Before determining whether Lead Counsel merit a percentage fee award that is within a
reasonable range, it is appropriate to consider what constitutes a "reasonable range."

that the 24.5% fee requested here is fully merited.
D.

The Goldberger Factors Support Lead Counsel's Requested Fee

In Goldberger, the Second Circuit provided guidance to district courts for analyzing fee
applications by requiring that they consider the following factors in a common fund case: (1) the
magnitude and complexities of the action; (2) the litigation risks involved; (3) the quality of class
counsel's representation; (4) the size of the requested fee in relation to the recoveries obtained;
(5) the time and labor expended by class counsel; and (6) public policy considerations. 209 F.3d at
50. These factors are non-exclusive, and, as noted below, courts in this District and elsewhere have
also considered, among other things, the endorsement of a sophisticated lead plaintiff.
Although none of them is controlling, each of the foregoing factors weighs strongly in favor
of approving the requested 24.5% fee here.
1.

The Action's Magnitude and Complexity Support the
Requested Fee

Courts have long recognized that securities class actions are notoriously complex and
difficult to prove. See, e.g., In re AOL Time Warner, Inc. Sec. & "ERISA" Litig., No. MDL 1500,
-7797700_i

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 17 of 36

2006 WL 903236, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2006) ("the legal requirements for recovery under the
securities laws present considerable challenges, particularly with respect to loss causation and the
calculation of damages"); Fogarazzo, 2011 WL 671745, at *3 ("securities actions are highly
complex"); In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., No. 02-CV-3400(CM)(PED), 2010 WL
4537550, at *27 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 2010) (courts have long recognized that securities class litigation
is "notably difficult and notoriously uncertain") (citation omitted).
As detailed in the Gronborg Declaration at ยถยถ8-11,18-44, 65-74, there is no question that this
Litigation presented a number of sharply contested issues of both law and fact and that Lead Plaintiff
faced formidable defenses to liability and damages. This was a complex class action involving
unique and difficult legal and factual issues under the federal securities laws. Lead Plaintiff alleged
that Defendants made misrepresentations and omissions to investors about the safety and
approvability of Pristiq for treatment of vasomotor symptoms ("VMS"). Adequately pleading these
claims was a significant undertaking, which involved, among other things, (a) the review and
analysis of thousands of pages of SEC and FDA filings, news articles, analyst reports, and other
written materials; (b) identifying, locating, and interviewing former Wyeth employees with relevant
knowledge; and (c) consulting with medical, biostatistics, damages, and loss causation
consultants/experts.
Throughout the Litigation, Defendants have adamantly denied liability and asserted they had
absolute defenses to Lead Plaintiffs claims, including that the cardiovascular adverse events
associated with Pristiq were publicly disclosed prior to the end of the Class Period, that Defendants'
misstatements and omissions were not material, that Defendants believed Pristiq was a safe and
effective treatment for VMS with allegedly no statistically significant evidence to the contrary, and
that Lead Plaintiff could not prove loss causation and damages. If the Litigation had not been
-8797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 18 of 36

settled, Lead Counsel would have been faced with additional complex factual and legal issues as
Defendants continued to pursue a vigorous defense. Unquestionably, absent a settlement there
would have been additional fact discovery, expert discovery, contested motions for summary
judgment, and trial.
The proposed settlement was reached less than two months before the fact discovery cut-off
and only after the case was actively prosecuted for almost five years. During that time, Lead
Counsel on behalf of Lead Plaintiff (1) successfully opposed Defendants' motion to dismiss and
motion for reconsideration; (2) engaged in bifurcated discovery on the issues of materiality and
statistical significance; (3) prepared for and attended a face-to-face discovery and settlement meeting
with defense counsel where each side presented their respective positions on the merits of the case,
along with supporting evidence and expert presentations; (4) addressed Defendants' proposed
summary judgment on the issue of materiality; (5) obtained class certification after extensive
briefing, class certification discovery, and argument; (6) engaged in many months of fact discovery,
including the review of over 1.3 million pages of documents produced by Defendants, a large portion
of which concerned the Pristiq for VMS clinical trials and were highly technical, the review of over
52,000 pages of documents produced by third parties, including financial analysts and the European
Medicines Agency, depositions of former and current Wyeth employees, including the depositions of
corporate representatives pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), and preparation for over 20 fact
depositions, including the deposition of each Defendant; and (7) engaged in settlement discussions
with the assistance of Judge Layn R. Phillips (Ret.) over a nearly six month period.
The "magnitude" of this class action is also apparent, as it involves thousands of investors.
The Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action was mailed to over 302,000 potential Class
Members, including hundreds of institutional investors. See Sylvester Decl., ยถยถ3-10.
-9797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 19 of 36

In sum, the "magnitude and complexity" factor clearly weighs in favor of the requested fee.
2.

The Risks of the Litigation Support the Requested Fee

The Second Circuit has identified "the risk of success as `perhaps the foremost' factor to be
considered in determining [a reasonable fee award]." Goldberger, 209 F.3d at 54 (citation omitted);

see also In re Telik, Inc. Sec. Litig., 576 F. Supp. 2d 570, 592 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) ("Courts have
repeatedly recognized that `the risk of the litigation' is a pivotal factor in assessing the appropriate
attorneys' fees to award to plaintiffs' counsel in class actions.") (citation omitted). As set forth
below, Lead Counsel confronted a host of significant risks in establishing both liability and damages.
a.

Risks of Establishing Liability Against the Defendants

Lead Counsel faced very significant risks in establishing liability as to the Defendants. As
detailed in the Gronborg Declaration, these risks included, among other things: the risk Lead
Plaintiff could not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with respect to each element of its
securities claims to the Court's satisfaction; the risk Lead Plaintiff could not prove loss causation;
the risk Lead Plaintiff could not prove scienter; and the risk a jury would find the alleged false
statements were immaterial or not actionable. Lead Plaintiff also faced the risk that, in response to
Defendants' Rule 23(f) petition, the Second Circuit would reverse or amend the Court's Order
certifying the Class. The risky nature of this Litigation is also underscored by the fact that no
counsel other than Lead Counsel even moved to be appointed to represent the Class.
b.

The Risks of Establishing Damages and Related Loss
Causation Issues

Under the federal securities laws, there can be no recovery in a ยง 10(b) case where the loss
was caused by factors unrelated to an alleged false statement or omission. Here, the amount of
damages that the Lead Plaintiff could have reasonably hoped to recover after taking into account
causation issues was hotly disputed โ and any resolution of this issue would have inevitably boiled
-10797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 20 of 36

down to a "battle of the experts" and the inherent risk that the jury would credit Defendants' experts
over those of Lead Plaintiff. See Hicks v. Morgan Stanley, No. 01 Civ. 10071 (RJH), 2005 WL
2757792, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2005) ("battle[s] of the experts" invariably "create[] a significant
obstacle to plaintiffs"); In re Am. Bank Note Holographics, Inc., Sec. Litig., 127 F. Supp. 2d 418,
426-27 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("[i]n such a battle, Plaintiffs' Counsel recognize the possibility that ajury
could be swayed by experts for Defendants, who could minimize or eliminate the amount of
Plaintiffs' losses").
The only certainty regarding damages was that the cause of the losses would be vigorously
contested, and the risk of recovering nothing was all too real even if Lead Plaintiff succeeded on all
liability issues. In any event, the numerous, specific, and serious risks of litigation presented by the
facts of this case also weigh strongly in favor of the requested fee.

c.

General Litigation Risks and the Fully Contingent
Nature of Lead Counsel's Retention

In evaluating the contingent litigation risk, the Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class

Counsel, 208 F.R.D. 340, 343 (Jan. 15, 2002) recognized that "[t]he fact that there will be no
payment if there is no settlement or trial victory means that there is greater risk for plaintiffs' counsel
in these class action cases than in cases in which an hourly rate or flat fee is guaranteed. The quid

pro quo for the risk, and for the delay in receiving any compensation in the best of circumstances, is
some kind of risk premium if the case is successful." See also Flag Telecom, 2010 WL 4537550, at
*27 ("Courts in the Second Circuit have recognized that the risk associated with a case undertaken
on a contingent fee basis is an important factor in determining an appropriate fee award."); Am. Bank

Note Holographics, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 433 (it is "appropriate to take this [contingent-fee] risk into
account in determining the appropriate fee to award").

-11797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 21 of 36

The risk of no recovery in complex cases of this type is real, and is heightened when
plaintiffs' counsel press to achieve the very best result for those they represent. Indeed, even if Lead
Plaintiff here had defeated Defendants' anticipated summary judgment motion and prevailed at trial
on both liability and damages, no judgment would have been secure until after the rulings on the
inevitable post judgment motions and appeals became final โ a process that would likely take years.
Lead Counsel know from experience that despite the most vigorous and skillful efforts, a firm's
success in contingent litigation, such as this, is never assured, and there are many class actions in
which plaintiffs' counsel expended tens of thousands of hours and received nothing for their efforts.
Indeed, even judgments affirmed on appeal by an appellate panel are no assurance of a recovery.

See, e.g., Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1990) (after 11 years of litigation, and
following a jury verdict for plaintiffs and an affirmance by a First Circuit panel, plaintiffs' claims
were dismissed by an en banc decision and plaintiffs recovered nothing). Countless other significant
cases have been lost after the investment of tens of thousands of hours of attorney time and millions
of dollars on expert and other litigation costs at summary judgment or after trial. 5
Similarly, even the most promising cases can be eviscerated by a sudden change in the law
after years of litigation. See, e.g., In re Alstom SA Sec. Litig., 741 F. Supp. 2d 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)

See, e.g., Robbins v. Koger Props., Inc., 116 F.3d 1441 (11th Cir. 1997) (reversal of jury
verdict of $81 million against accounting firm after a 19-day trial); Bentley v. Legent Corp., 849 F.
Supp. 429 (E.D. Va. 1994) (directed verdict after plaintiffs' presentation of their case to the jury),
aff'd sub nom. Herman v. Legent Corp., 50 F.3d 6 (4th Cir. 1995); Landy v. Amsterdam, 815 F.2d
925 (3d Cir. 1987) (directed verdict for defendants after five years of litigation); Anixter v. HomeStake Prod. Co., 77 F.3d 1215 (10th Cir. 1996) (overturning plaintiffs' verdict following two
decades of litigation); In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., No. C-84-20148(A)-JW, 1991 WL 238298
(N.D. Cal. Sept. 6, 1991) ($100 million jury verdict vacated on post-trial motions); In re JDS

law granted following a four week trial).

(after completion of extensive foreign discovery, 95% of plaintiffs' damages were eliminated by the
Supreme Court's reversal of 40 years of circuit court precedent in Morrison v. Nat'l Austl. Bank Ltd.,
U.S.

, 130 S. Ct. 2869 (2010)).

Unlike counsel for the Defendants, who are paid substantial hourly rates and reimbursed for
their expenses on a regular basis, Lead Plaintiff's counsel have not been compensated for any of
their time (6,838.45 hours with a lodestar value of $3,909,020.75) or reimbursed for any of their
litigation expenses ($461,050.19) incurred over the almost five years that have passed since the
Litigation was commenced. Moreover, Lead Plaintiff's counsel would not have been compensated
for their time at all had they been unsuccessful in this Litigation. Because the fee to be awarded in
this matter is entirely contingent, the only certainties from the outset were that there would be no fee
without a successful result, and that a successful result, if any, could be achieved only after lengthy
and difficult effort. Lead Counsel therefore respectfully submit that the fully contingent nature of
their retention in this high-risk action weighs strongly in favor of the requested fees and expenses,
and should be given serious consideration by the Court.

3.

The Quality of Lead Counsel's Representation Supports the
Requested Fee

A number of considerations may be relevant to assessing the quality of class counsel's
representation of a plaintiff class, including the court's own observations, class counsel's experience
and standing at the bar, and the quality of the opposing counsel whom class counsel had to litigate
against. The seminal test for evaluating "quality of the representation," however, is the quality of the
results achieved for the class members whom they were appointed to represent.

a.

The Results Obtained from Lead Counsel's Efforts

Courts have consistently recognized that the results achieved is a major factor to be
considered in making a fee award. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983). For all the
-13797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 23 of 36

reasons detailed in the accompanying Gronborg Declaration, Lead Counsel respectfully submit that
the results that they obtained for the Class in this Litigation are outstanding by any measure. These
results, without more, weigh strongly in favor of finding that the quality of Lead Counsel's
representation here was at the top end of the scale. Lead Counsel have secured a settlement that
provides for a substantial and certain cash payment of $67,500,000 for the benefit of the Class. The
excellent nature of this settlement is supported by a review of recoveries in other securities class
action settlements. A study by National Economic Research Associates ("NERA"), an economic
consulting firm, states that in 2011, the median settlement amount in shareholder class actions was
$8.7 million. Dr. Jordan Milev, Robert Patton, Svetlana Starykh, and Dr. John Montgomery, Recent

Trends in Securities Class Action Litigation: 2011 Year-End Review, at 17 (NERA Dec. 14, 2011),
attached as Exhibit 2 to the Compendium. The present settlement is nearly eight times the 2011
median recovery. Moreover, the recovery in this case was made without the benefit of any SEC or
other regulatory investigation and without the benefits of any admissions of any wrongdoing from
Defendants. This was not a case where Lead Plaintiff or Lead Counsel could rely on the work done
in any other litigation or rely on any admission by Defendants. When measured against the results in
comparable cases, Lead Counsel achieved an excellent recovery for Class Members. Thus, the
$67,500,000 recovery for the Class strongly supports the requested fee award.
b.

The Court's Observations as to the Quality of Lead
Counsel's Work

The Court may, of course, also take into account its own observations of the quality of Lead
Counsel's representation during the course of this Litigation. The Court has reviewed the
Consolidated Complaint and Lead Counsel's briefing and argument regarding, inter alia, the motion
to dismiss, motion for reconsideration, and class certification. Although this work represents only a
small fraction of the total work that Lead Counsel have performed in the course of litigating the case,
-14797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 24 of 36

we respectfully submit that the quality of that work is reflective of the quality, thoroughness, and
professionalism of the efforts that Lead Counsel have devoted to all aspects of this Litigation on
behalf of the Lead Plaintiff and the Members of the Class.
c.

The Standing and Expertise of Lead Counsel

Lead Counsel are highly experienced in prosecuting securities class actions, and worked
diligently and efficiently to prosecute this Litigation. Lead Counsel's experience and track record in
complex securities class action litigation is summarized in the firm resume attached as Exhibit A to
the accompanying Declaration of Laurie L. Largent Filed on Behalf of Lead Counsel in Support of
Application for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses ("Largent Decl.

").

Lead Counsel are

consistently ranked among the top plaintiffs' firms in the country. Further, Lead Counsel have taken
multiple complex securities fraud class action cases to trial, and are among the few firms to have
done so. Lead Counsel respectfully submit that their willingness and ability to litigate cases through
trial added critical leverage in the settlement negotiations.
d.

The Standing and Expertise of Defendants' Counsel

The quality of the work performed by Lead Counsel in obtaining the settlement should also
be evaluated in light of the quality of the opposition. See, e.g., In re Adelphia Commc'ns Corp. Sec.
& Derivative Litig., No. 03 MDL 1529 (LMM), 2006 WL 3378705, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2006)
("The fact that the settlements were obtained from defendants represented by `formidable opposing
counsel from some of the best defense firms in the country' also evidences the high quality of lead
counsels' work.

").

Here, the Defendants were represented by one of the country's preeminent law

firms, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, which vigorously defended the Litigation from the filing of
the first complaint. The corporate defendant, Wyeth (now Pfizer), is also well-versed in complex
litigation and has demonstrated a willingness to take cases to trial. That Lead Counsel was able to
-15797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 25 of 36

negotiate such an excellent recovery in the face of such formidable (and well-financed) opposition is
a testament to the skill and dedication that Lead Counsel brought to every phase of this Litigation.
In sum, all of the customary metrics indicative of exceptional "quality of representation"
weigh in favor of the requested fee.
4.

The Requested Fee Is Fair and Reasonable in Relation to the
Size of the Recoveries and Comparable Fee Awards

As discussed previously, the requested 24.5% fee falls in the "range of reasonableness" based
on fees awarded by courts across the nation in other securities cases settling in the $25 million to
$100 million range. The NERA study confirms that between 1996 and 2011, the median plaintiffs'
attorneys' fees for settlements between $25 and $99.9 million was 27% of the settlement.
Compendium, Ex. 2 at 22. This study suggests that the requested 24.5% fee here is justified in
relation to the size of the recovery.
5.

The Time and Labor Expended by Lead Counsel, Including a
"Lodestar Crosscheck," Support the Requested Fee

The Second Circuit permits courts to utilize a lodestar "cross check" to further test the
reasonableness of a percentage-based fee. See Goldberger, 209 F.3d at 50. The "lodestar" is
calculated by multiplying the number of hours expended on the litigation by each particular attorney
or paraprofessional by their current hourly rate, and totaling the amounts for all timekeepers. 6

Both the Supreme Court and courts in this Circuit have long approved the use of current
6
hourly rates to calculate the base lodestar figure as a means of compensating for the delay in
receiving payment that is inherent in class actions, inflationary losses, and the loss of access to legal
and monetary capital that could otherwise have been employed had class counsel been paid on a
current basis during the pendency of the litigation. See In re Union Carbide Corp. Consumer Prods.
Bus. Sec. Litig., 724 F. Supp. 160, 163 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); In re Veeco Instruments Inc. Sec. Litig.,
No. 05 MDL 01695 (CM), 2007 WL 4115808, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 7,2007); Missouri v. Jenkins,
491 U.S. 274, 284 (1989).
-16797700_1

Filed 01/10/13 Page 26 of 36

Additionally, "[u]nder the lodestar method of fee computation, a multiplier is typically
applied to the lodestar." In re Global Crossing Sec. & ERISA Litig., 225 F.R.D. 436,468 (S.D.N.Y.
2004). "The multiplier represents the risk of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
contingent nature of the engagement, the skill of the attorneys, and other factors."

Id. (citing

Goldberger, 209 F.3d at 47; Savoie, 166 F.3d at 460).
In this entirely contingent action, Lead Plaintiff's counsel have collectively spent 6,838.45
hours, representing a lodestar of $3,909,020.75, in investigating, prosecuting, and ultimately settling
these claims. 7 All time spent litigating this matter was reasonably necessary and appropriate, and,
Lead Counsel respectfully submit, the results achieved further confirm that the time spent on the
case was entirely proportionate to the amounts at stake.
Based on a 24.5% fee, Lead Plaintiff's counsel's aggregate lodestar of $3,909,020.75 would
yield a "crosscheck" multiplier of 4.2. Like the requested 24.5% fee award, the inferred lodestar
multiplier here also falls well within the range of multipliers awarded in other complex cases,
including other securities class actions that were certainly no more exceptional than this one.
In complex contingent litigation, lodestar multiples of four or more are commonly awarded
in this Circuit and throughout the nation. See Maley, 186 F. Supp. 2d at 369 (awarding fee equal to a
4.65 multiplier as "well within the range awarded by courts in this Circuit and courts throughout the
country"); In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 146 F. Supp. 2d 706, 736 n.44 (E.D. Pa. 2001) and In re
Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 362 F. Supp. 2d 587, 589-91 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (awarding fees in case
involving combined recoveries of $319.6 million with multiplier of 4.5 to 8.5 with respect to one

The time expended by each legal professional and paraprofessional who worked on this
7
matter (including their hourly rates and the resulting lodestar for each individual) is set forth in the
Largent Declaration and the Declaration of Matthew P. Montgomery Filed in Support of Application
for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses, submitted herewith.

recovery and 6.96 multiplier for the other, for an aggregate multiplier of roughly 6.7). 8 Case law
involving fee awards in other complex types of class actions stand for the same proposition. See,
e.g., In re NASDAQ Mkt.-Makers Antitrust Litig.,

187 F.R.D. 465, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (awarding

3.97 multiplier, and finding multipliers of 3 to 4.5 to be "common"); Sumitomo Copper, 74 F. Supp.
2d at 399 (similarly finding 3 to 4.5 multipliers to be common).
Moreover, the lodestar "crosscheck" is exactly thatโ a rough crosscheck that is not intended
to supplement the primacy of the percentage-based method. For example, as the court expressly
noted in Rite Aid, 146 F. Supp. 2d at 736 n.44, if high multipliers are not allowed in cases involving
large dollar recoveries, then the lodestar approach "begins to dominate and supersede the percentage
of the recovery formula," particularly in those exemplary cases where the recovery greatly exceeds
the norm for such litigation. See also In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 294, 307 (3d Cir.
2005) ("the lodestar cross-check does not trump the primary reliance on the percentage of common
fund method"). Courts in this District have similarly emphasized that the lodestar crosscheck should
not override the percentage approach where class counsel's efforts have produced exceptional
results. For example, in In re Buspirone Antitrust Litig., No. MDL 1413 (JGK), 2003 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 26538 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2003), Judge Koeltl awarded a 33% fee with an 8.46 multiplier.
Similarly, in Newman v. Caribiner Int'l, Inc., No. 99 Civ. 2271(GEL) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2001),
Judge Lynch observed that: "I wanted to note that, in my view, there is no difficulty with the fact
candidly acknowledged in the papers that, in terms of the time expended, this is a profitable case for
the plaintiffs' lawyers who worked on it. Contingency type percentage settlements serve an

See also In re AremisSoft Corp. Sec. Litig., 210 F.R.D. 109, 130-35 (D.N.J. 2002) (awarding
fee equal to 4.3 multiplier in case involving $194 million recovery); In re Doral Fin. Corp. Sec.
Litig., No. 1:05-md-01706-RO, slip op. at 5 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2007) ($129 million recovery for the
class; awarding fee equal to a "reasonable multiplier of 10.26").

important purpose ... so it is important in awarding or approving a fee settlement in a case of this
kind not to be [blinded] that in this particular case, calculated on an hourly basis, [that] this is a very
large, high proportion to what hourly charges would have been." Id. at 6. Judge Lynch proceeded to
approve a percentage-based fee that equated to a 7.7 multiplier. Id.
For the same reasons as discussed above, and given the outstanding results achieved solely
due to Lead Counsel's efforts in the face of substantial litigation risk, the requested multiplier of 4.2
falls within the range of "lodestar crosschecks" that are regularly approved in complex class actions,
and should be approved.

Important Public Policy Considerations Further Support the
Requested Fee

Although it is a factor that is too often given only cursory attention, public policy
considerations constitute a final but nonetheless very significant factor to consider in evaluating a fee
request. See Goldberger, 209 F.3d at 50; Flag Telecom, 2010 WL 4537550, at *29; see also

WorldCom, 388 F. Supp. 2d at 359 ("to attract well-qualified plaintiffs' counsel who are able to take
a case to trial, and who defendants understand are able and willing to do so, it is necessary to provide
appropriate financial incentives"); In re Priceline.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 3:00-CV-1884 (AVC),
2007 WL 2115592, at *5 (D. Conn. July 20, 2007) (fee awards in complex securities cases "help[] to
perpetuate the availability of skilled counsel for future cases of this nature"); Hicks, 2005 WL
2757792, at *9 ("To make certain that the public, is represented by talented and experienced trial
counsel, the remuneration should be both fair and rewarding.") (citation omitted); Maley, 186 F.
Supp. 2d at 369 ("courts recognize that such awards serve the dual purposes of encouraging
representatives to seek redress for injuries caused to public investors and discouraging future
misconduct of a similar nature")

-19797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 29 of 36

Similarly, for decades the Supreme Court has consistently recognized that the public has a
particularly strong interest in incentivizing top-quality plaintiffs' counsel to pursue private actions
under the federal securities laws to protect investors, deter violations, and help maintain the integrity
of the nation's securities markets. Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court:
"This Court has long recognized that meritorious private actions to enforce federal antifraud
securities laws are an essential supplement to criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions
brought, respectively, by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC)." Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 313 (2007). 9 Indeed, as
Congress recognized in passing the PSLRA in 1995:
Private securities litigation is an indispensable tool with which defrauded investors
can recover their losses without having to rely upon government action. Such private
lawsuits promote public and global confidence in our capital markets and help to
deter wrongdoing and to guarantee that corporate officers, auditors, directors,
lawyers and others properly perform their jobs. This legislation seeks to return the
securities litigation system to that high standard.
See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, at 31, 1995 WL 709276, at *31 (1995) ("H.R. Conf. Rep.")
Simply stated, the SEC, a vital but understaffed agency whose inadequate funding has been the
subject of numerous news stories and other accounts in recent years, does not have anywhere near
the budget or personnel to ensure enforcement of the securities laws. If the vitally important public
policy of supplementing SEC enforcement through effective private litigation is to be carried out, the
courts should award fees that appropriately reward plaintiffs' counsel for obtaining outstanding
results for the many risks that they assume in prosecuting securities class actions.

See also J.I. Case, 377 U.S. at 432 (private securities actions provide "a most effective
weapon in the enforcement" of the securities laws and are "a necessary supplement to [SEC]
action"); Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 345 (2005) ("The securities statutes seek to
maintain public confidence in the marketplace" and "[t]hey do so by deterring fraud, in part, through
the availability of private securities fraud actions.

For the foregoing reasons, public policy considerations provide further support for the
requested attorneys' fees โ a fee that is well within the established measures of reasonableness. 10
E.

Lead Plaintiffs Endorsement Should Also Be Considered in
Determining Reasonableness of the Requested Fee

In enacting the PSLRA, Congress sought to encourage institutional investors to play an
active role in prosecuting cases under the securities laws, and indicated its belief that increasing the
role of such sophisticated investors would "ultimately benefit shareholders and assist courts by
improving the quality of representation in securities class actions." H.R. Conf. Rep. at 34; see also

In re Lernout & Hauspie Sec. Litig., 138 F. Supp. 2d 39, 43 (D. Mass. 2001). Because institutional
investors with large financial stakes in an action have a particular interest in ensuring that class
counsel receive appropriate, but not excessive, fees upon final resolution of a case, courts can have
more confidence in the fairness of fee requests in cases subject to the supervision of such
institutional plaintiffs.

See Elliott J. Weiss and John S. Beckerman, Let the Money Do the

Monitoring: How Institutional Investors Can Reduce Agency Costs in Securities Class Actions, 104
Yale L.J. 2053, 2105 (1995), cited with approval by H.R. Conf. Rep. at 34; see also In re Comverse

Tech., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 06-CV-1825 (NGG)(RER), 2010 WL 2653354, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. June 24,
2010) (the fact that "PSLRA lead plaintiffs often have a significant financial stake in the
settlement" provides them with "a powerful incentive to ensure that any fees resulting from that
settlement are reasonable") (citation omitted).

10

The reaction of the Class may also be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a
requested fee. See Veeco, 2007 WL 4115808, at *10; Maley, 186 F. Supp. 2d at 374. Although the
deadline for objections to the requested fees and expenses has not yet passed, no objections have
been received to date. Lead Counsel will address objections to the request for fees and expenses, if
any arise, in a supplemental submission to be filed on February 14, 2013.
-21797700_i

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 31 of 36

The Lead Plaintiff here is precisely the kind of large and sophisticated institutional investor
that Congress wanted to supervise this type of litigation, especially since it has a substantial financial
interest at stake and has had direct involvement in the Litigation from its early days through
settlement. Based on its knowledge of the case and its review of the relevant facts, including the
results achieved in the face of significant litigation risks, Lead Plaintiff has approved and fully
supports the requested fee. See paragraph 5 to the Declaration of Charles T. Hannaford in Support of
Motion for Final Approval of Settlement, Plan of Allocation of Settlement Proceeds, and Award of
Attorneys' Fees and Expenses ("Hannaford Decl."), filed herewith.
The endorsement of Lead Counsel's fee request by the institutional Lead Plaintiff strongly
supports approval of the requested fee. See, e.g., In re Mills Corp. Sec. Litig., 265 F.R.D. 246, 262
(E.D. Va. 2009) (the fact that "Lead Plaintiffs, IPERS and MPERS โ sophisticated institutional
investors โ clearly approve of the percentage sought" supported approval of the requested fee); In re
Lucent Techs., Inc. Sec. Litig., 327 F. Supp. 2d 426, 442 (D.N.J. 2004) ("Significantly, the Lead
Plaintiffs, both of whom are institutional investors with great financial stakes in the outcome of the
litigation, have reviewed and approved Lead Counsel's fees and expenses request.

").

III. LEAD COUNSEL'S REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF LITIGATION
EXPENSES SHOULD BE APPROVED
It is well established that counsel who create a common fund are entitled to the
reimbursement of expenses that they advance to a class. LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 143 F.3d
748, 763 (2d Cir. 1998); In re China Sunergy Sec. Litig., No. 07 Civ. 7895 (DAB), 2011 WL
1899715, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 13, 2011); Veeco, 2007 WL 4115808, at *10.
Here, the litigation expenses include the costs of experts and consultants, online legal and
factual research, developing and maintaining the electronic discovery platform that counsel used to
search, review, and analyze Defendants' and third party document productions, court fees, travel
-22797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 32 of 36

expenses, copying costs, facsimile charges, court reporting services, postage and delivery expenses,
and Lead Plaintiff's share of Judge Phillip's mediation fees. All expenses are detailed in the Largent
Declaration. Lead Counsel respectfully submit that the expenses sought were all reasonably and
necessarily incurred, and are of the type that are customarily reimbursed in securities cases. See,
e.g., Global Crossing, 225 F.R.D. at 468 (court approved expenses incurred, which included
investigative and expert witness fees, filing fees, service of process, travel, legal research, and
document production).

IV. CLASS REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT
FOR ITS EXPENSES
The PSLRA specifically provides for reimbursement to representative plaintiffs in securities
actions:
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the award of reasonable costs
and expenses (including lost wages) directly relating to the representation of the class
to any representative party serving on behalf of the class.
15 U.S.C. ยง78u-4(a)(4). With the discretion provided by the PSLRA, courts routinely grant
remuneration to class representatives reflecting the services undertaken for the benefit of the class.
See In re Xcel Energy, Inc., 364 F. Supp. 2d 980, 1000 (D. Minn. 2005) (granting awards to lead
plaintiffs where they reviewed pleadings, communicated with counsel, indicated willingness to
appear at trial, kept informed of settlement negotiations, and effectuated policies of federal securities
laws); Hicks, 2005 WL 2757792, at *10 ("Courts in this Circuit routinely award such costs and
expenses both to reimburse the named plaintiffs for expenses incurred through their involvement
with the action and lost wages, as well as to provide an incentive for such plaintiffs to remain
involved in the litigation and to incur such expenses in the first place.

").

Lead Plaintiff seeks a total of $4,526.25 for its unreimbursed time spent in pursuing the
claims of the Class against the Defendants. See Hannaford Decl., ยถ6. Lead Plaintiff's efforts are
-23 797700_1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS Document 117

Filed 01/10/13 Page 33 of 36

precisely the types of activities found to support reimbursement to class representatives.
Accordingly, Lead Counsel respectfully request that the Court approve an award of $4,526.25, as
reimbursement for the efforts of the Lead Plaintiff on behalf of the Class.
V.

CONCLUSION
The total recovery of $67,500,000 under the proposed settlement represents an excellent

result achieved in a high risk case in the face of determined adverse parties and counsel. Lead
Counsel respectfully submit that the requested 24.5% fee is fair and reasonable, well within the
range of fees awarded in similar cases, and is fully supported by each of the Goldberger factors, and
that the requested reimbursement of Lead Counsel's expenses and Lead Plaintiff's time is also fair
and reasonable.
