Counterclaim of Defendant Run Ping Zhou for Failure to State a Claim upon Which
Relief Can Be Granted, because the Court may write its own orders depending on
different facts and evidence against every plaintiff.

In my Counterclaim, the evidence shows that Mei- Fang Lisa Zhang told a lie to the
Court that she was told about the Consent Order for the first time "in late February
2007". Mei- Fang Lisa Zhang was a Defendant by violation of the Consent Order. Zhang
was doing illegal trading of foreign currency futures even when she knew the case of the
CFTC vs. NICI and other Defendants. So Zhang does not have jurisdiction over me.

The allegations in my counterclaim told the truth and evidence that all the Plaintiffs
should reply, then let the Court decide its own orders as the Court may deem just and
proper. I did not fail to state a claim to pray judgment against every plaintiff in my
counterclaim.

I respectfully request that the Court deny the Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss
Counterclaim of Defendant Run Ping Zhou for Failure to State a Claim upon Which
Relief Can Be Granted, and request that the Court dismiss the Plaintiffs Complaint
against me.
