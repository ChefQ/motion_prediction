DENG, and HAO LIANG will move the Court, and Plaintiffs do hereby move, to dismiss the

3

Counterclaim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because Defendant RUN PING ZHOU’s

4

Counterclaim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The gravamen of the

5

Counterclaim is that Plaintiffs have unfairly accused RUN PING ZHOU of wrongful conduct in

6

their Complaint and that their allegations constitute malicious prosecution. Defendant RUN

7

PING ZHOU, however, has not yet litigated her defenses to the Complaint to a legal termination

8

in her favor, which is an essential element of a malicious prosecution claim. Therefore, her

9

claim is legally deficient.

10
11

The motion will be based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum of
Points and Authorities filed herewith, and the pleadings and papers filed herein.
