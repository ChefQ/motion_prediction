INTRODUCTION

2

Dell’s motion for summary judgment that Claim 12 of the Haskell ‘226 patent is invalid for

3 obviousness fails from the outset because Dell has not come forward with proof sufficient to
4 establish a prima facie case of obviousness. Although obviousness is an affirmative defense that
5 Dell must prove by clear and convincing evidence, Dell offers no proof to support its core contention
6 that the “PictureTel patents” collectively disclose all of the elements of Claim 12 as construed by
7 this Court, including the required “codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks.” Nor has
8 Dell presented proof that the PictureTel patents disclose or render obvious circuitry equivalent to
9 that identified by this Court as corresponding structure for the two means-plus-function elements of
10 Claim 12.
11

Dell’s attempt to spackle over the gaps in the teachings of the PictureTel patents with

12 unrelated art likewise fails. Relying entirely on attorney argument and the conclusory assertions of
13 its own expert, Dell fails to prove its premise: i.e., that the PictureTel references disclose the
14 limitations of Claim 12 but for the use of interpolation error codes. Once again, Dell ignores the fact
15 that Claim 12 is drafted in means-plus-function form, and instead treats the claim as though it were a
16 method combining various “techniques.” For that reason, Dell provides no proof that the prior art
17 discloses the corresponding structure identified by this Court in its construction of Claim 12 or its
18 equivalent.
19

Assuming for the purpose of argument that the PictureTel references collectively disclose

20 everything required by Claim 12 except the use of interpolation error codes, Dell’s motion for
21 summary judgment nevertheless fails because Dell presents no proof that interpolation error codes,
22 such as those described in the Haskell ‘226 patent and processed by the decoder of Claim 12, were
23 known in the art. Nor has Dell presented proof that it would have been obvious to integrate such
24 technology with the PictureTel patents to arrive at the invention of Claim 12. Rather, Dell argues
25 that it would generally have been obvious to use interpolation error codes in interpolative coding
26 systems somehow, without demonstrating that the specific implementation claimed in the Haskell
27 ‘226 patent would have been an obvious choice. Accordingly, Dell has not met its initial burden on

1 summary judgment of coming forward with proof that, left unrebutted, would support a finding of
2 obviousness by clear and convincing evidence.
3

Even if Dell had met its summary judgment burden, ample evidence exists to rebut Dell’s

4 anemic obviousness case and demonstrate a genuine dispute for trial. For example, MPT’s technical
5 expert, Professor Bernd Girod, explains how the PictureTel patents not only fail to disclose the
6 individual elements of Claim 12, or suggest their arrangement as set forth in that claim, but actually
7 teach away from the inventive decoding apparatus. That fact alone suffices to support a finding of
8 nonobviousness under controlling law. Professor Girod also analyzes the scope and content of the
9 prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention, the level of ordinary skill in
10 the art, and opines that — given the large number of video compression techniques available at the
11 time of the invention and the unpredictability of the video compression art — the invention of Claim
12 12 was nonobvious. Professor Girod’s opinion is further supported by objective indicia of
13 nonobviousness, including the failure of others to arrive at the invention, the commercial success of
14 the invention, and the licensing of the invention by others. In sum, because Dell has not presented a
15 prima facie case of obviousness, and because more than sufficient proof exists to support a finding
16 of nonobviousness, Dell’s summary judgment motion should be denied.

Digital Video Compression

Digital video signals, such as those stored on a DVD, contain information defining many
separate pictures, or frames. (Declaration of Bernd Girod in Support of Multimedia Patent Trust’s
Oppositions to Dell’s Video Coding Summary Judgment Motions (hereinafter “Girod Opp. Decl.”)
at ¶ 6.) When viewed in rapid succession, those individual frames can produce the illusion of
motion. (Id.) But the amount of information needed to digitally represent each frame of a video
signal in its entirety is too great for efficient storage and transmission. (Id. at ¶ 8.) For most
transmission or storage applications, it is therefore important to reduce the amount of information
required to represent video signals in digital form. Techniques developed to achieve such reduction
are commonly called “video compression” or “video coding” techniques. (Id.)

Video compression techniques generally exploit what is known in the art as “statistical

2 redundancy.” (Id. at ¶ 11.) Statistical redundancy refers to the empirical fact that much of the
3 information both within and between frames of a video sequence is repetitive, or “redundant.” (Id.)
4 Video compression techniques take advantage of that redundancy to store or transmit the video
5 signal efficiently; that is, with as few bits as possible. (Id.)
6

1.

Intraframe Compression Techniques

Video compression techniques that exploit redundancy within a single frame are called

7

8 “intraframe compression” techniques. (Id. at ¶ 12.) One common intraframe compression technique
9 performs a “transform” on blocks1 of pixels in the original frame to obtain a representation of each
10 block of the original frame by an array of numbers, called “transform coefficients.” (Id.) The
11 transform produces as many transform coefficients for the block as there were pixels in the original
12 block. (Id.) The purpose of the transform is to represent the pixel values in a different domain, such
13 that statistical dependencies among the individual numbers are greatly reduced. (Id.) This simplifies
14 further compression. By applying a corresponding inverse transform, the original pixel data can be
15 reconstructed without distortion, resulting in “lossless” compression. (Id.)
Another common intraframe compression technique is “quantization” of transform

16

17 coefficients. (Id. at ¶ 13.) Quantization reduces the amount of data needed to store or transmit
18 digital video by rounding each transform coefficient to the nearest one of a set of representative
19 values. (Id.) The quantization process is not reversible, and therefore results in “lossy”
20 compression. (Id.)
2.

21

Interframe Compression Techniques

Nearby frames in a video sequence are often very similar. In fact, when viewed side-by-side,

22

23 they may appear almost indistinguishable. This is because nearby frames typically show the same
24 objects at slightly shifted positions in the image. (Id. at ¶ 16.) Video compression techniques that
25 exploit this redundancy between frames are called “interframe compression” techniques. (Id.)
26
27

This Court has interpreted the term “blocks” to mean “sets of pixels (picture elements also called
pels) that constitute a portion of a frame.”

1 Substantial data compression can be achieved by exploiting the frame-to-frame similarities in a
2 video sequence using interframe coding techniques. (Id.)
3

Modern video compression systems typically use an interframe compression technique called

4 “motion-compensated prediction” to capitalize on the similarities between nearby video frames. (Id.
5 at ¶ 17.) The idea of motion-compensated prediction is to account for the displacement that objects
6 have undergone from one frame to the next and transmit that displacement to the decoder. (Id.) If
7 the displacement is estimated accurately, then pixel information in a current frame can be predicted
8 with precision simply by applying a displacement estimate to a previous frame, and no further
9 information needs to be sent. (Id.) In practice, this is not always the case, because uncovered
10 background in the image, lighting changes, changes in surface appearance, noise, and many effects
11 other than object displacement may cause frame-to-frame change in video sequences. (Id.) As a
12 result, in addition to the displacement estimate, a “prediction error” signal is often also calculated for
13 storage or transmission. (Id.)
14

The prediction error signal can be interpreted as an image, and although it is not suitable for

15 viewing, it can be compressed using intraframe compression techniques such as the block-wise
16 “transform” described above (which converts a block of error signals into a equal number of
17 transform coefficients). (Id. at ¶ 18.) Video compression using motion compensated prediction and
18 transform coding is commonly called “motion-compensated hybrid coding.” (Id.)
19

A motion-compensated hybrid coder does not use the original version of the previous frame

20 as the basis for motion-compensated prediction, because that original frame is not available at the
21 decoder. (Id.) The decoder only has a decoded and reconstructed version of the previous frame
22 available, which differs from the original signal by quantization errors due to lossy compression.
23 (Id.) For the proper operation of the motion-compensated hybrid coder, it is important that identical
24 motion-compensated prediction signals are subtracted at the encoder and then added back in again at
25 the decoder. (Id.) To achieve this, the encoder contains a replica of the decoder. Just like the
26 decoder, it adds the decoded reconstructed prediction error signal to the motion-compensated
27 prediction signal, to generate the reconstructed frame that appears at the output of the decoder. (Id.)

1 The reconstructed frame, rather than the original frame, serves as input to the motion-compensated
2 predictor, just like in the decoder. (Id.)
3

Many modern video compression systems also use an interframe compression technique

4 called “motion-compensated interpolation” to exploit the similarities between nearby video frames.
5 (Id. at ¶ 20.) As the name suggests, motion compensated interpolation predicts pixel information in
6 a current frame by averaging pixel information obtained from preceding and subsequent frames.
7 (Id.) The pixel information used in the averaging process is obtained using motion compensated
8 prediction as described above. (Id.) In the case of motion compensated interpolation, however, two
9 displacement estimates are used — one based on a previous frame, and another based on a
10 subsequent frame — to generate forward and backward predictions. (Id.) The two predictions are
11 then averaged. If the averaged prediction is inaccurate, an “interpolation error” signal can be
12 calculated for storage or transmission.
13

B.

The Haskell ‘226 Patent

14

The Haskell ‘226 patent describes compression methods and circuits that employ motion

15 compensated temporal prediction using prediction error information with motion compensated
16 temporal interpolation using interpolation error information. (Id. at ¶¶ 24-25.) The methods and
17 circuits disclosed in the Haskell ‘226 patent operate in a block-wise manner, both in performing
18 motion compensated prediction and in transforming prediction and interpolation error. (Id.)
19

The asserted claim of the Haskell ‘226 patent, claim 12, describes a decoder circuit — an

20 apparatus — capable of responding to prediction error codes and interpolation error codes to
21 generate what the patent calls “block approximations” and “interpolated blocks”:
22
23
24
25
26
27

A circuit responsive to coded video signals where the video signals
comprise successive frames and each frame includes a plurality of
blocks and where the coded video signals comprise codes that describe
deviations from approximated blocks and codes that describe
deviations from interpolated blocks, comprising:
means for developing block approximations from said codes that
describe deviations from approximated blocks; and
means responsive to said block approximations and to said codes that
describe deviations from interpolated blocks to develop said
interpolated blocks.

1 (Ex. 1, ‘226 Patent.)2 The Court has already construed the language of claim 12. (Ex. 2, ‘226
2 Markman Order.) Of particular interest here, the Court has determined the function and identified
3 specific corresponding structure associated with each of the two means-plus-function limitations
4 recited in the claim. (Id.)
As construed by the Court, the first means-plus-function limitation requires a means for

5

6 performing the function of “developing block approximations [the combinations of predicted blocks
7 with differences between the actual blocks and the predicted blocks] from said codes that describe
8 deviations from approximated blocks.” (Id.) The Court identified the corresponding structure in the
9 Haskell ‘226 patent specification as the combination of Decoder 22, DCT-1 24, Adder 27, and Shift
10 Circuit 26, including all inputs and outputs of those elements related to the claimed function. (Id.)
11 Among other things, in the Haskell ‘226 patent those elements collectively contain circuitry for
12 performing block-based motion compensation, decoding and inverse transformation of prediction
13 error, and combination of prediction error with motion-compensated predictions to form “block
14 approximations.” (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 25.)
The second means-plus-function limitation, as construed by the Court, requires a means for

15

16 performing the function of “develop[ing] said interpolated blocks responsive to said block
17 approximations [the combinations of predicted blocks with differences between the actual blocks
18 and the predicted blocks] and to said codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks.” (Ex.
19 2, ‘226 Patent Markman Order.) The Court identified the corresponding structure in the Haskell
20 ‘226 patent specification as the combination of Decoder 25, DCT-1 34, Adder 35, Shift Circuits 31
21 and 39, and Averager 32, including all inputs and outputs of those elements related to the claimed
22 function. (Id.) Among other things, in the Haskell ‘226 patent those elements collectively contain
23 circuitry for performing block-based motion compensation, block-based inverse transformation of
24 prediction error, averaging of forward and backward motion compensated predictions, and

The PictureTel Patents

4

The so-called “PictureTel patents” identified by Dell are seven patents reflecting work

5 performed at PictureTel Corporation in the late 1980s. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 65.) Some of the
6 PictureTel patents share common inventors and cross-reference one another. Collectively, the
7 PictureTel patents can be viewed as describing the evolution of a video compression system. (Id. at
8 ¶ 66.) The original system is described in the earliest-filed PictureTel patent — U.S. Patent
9 4,703,350 (“the Hinman ‘350 patent”) — and employs a motion-compensated hybrid coding scheme
10 along with a form of interframe interpolation for post-processing, but without any form of
11 interpolation error codes. (Id. at ¶ 66; Ex. 3, Hinman ‘350 patent.)
12

The next five PictureTel patents address certain features and/or relatively minor

13 modifications of the Hinman ‘350 patent system:
14

•

U.S. Patent No. 4,727,422 (Ex. 4, “the Hinman ‘422 patent”), which focuses on the
lossy compressor of the Hinman ‘350 patent system;

•

U.S. Patent No. 4,661,849 (Ex. 5, “the Hinman ‘849 patent”), which focuses on the
motion estimator of the Hinman ‘350 patent system;

•

U.S. Patent No. 4,794,455 (Ex. 6, “the Ericsson ‘455 patent”), which adds an adaptive
loop filter to the Hinman ‘350 patent system;

•

U.S. Patent No. 4,754,492 (Ex. 7, “the Malvar ‘492 patent”), which adds an
overlapping block transform to the Hinman ‘350 patent system; and

•

U.S. Patent No. 4,816,914 (Ex. 8, “the Ericsson’914 patent”), which adds quadtree
encoding of transform coefficients to the Hinman ‘350 patent system.

22

23 (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 67.) As with the Hinman ‘350 patent itself, none of these PictureTel patents
24 describes any form of interpolation error codes. (Id.)
25

The seventh (and last-filed) PictureTel patent describes a substantial modification of the

26 motion-compensated hybrid coding scheme described in the first six PictureTel patents. (Id. at ¶ 68.)
27 Rather than using transform coding of prediction error, U.S. Patent No. 4,849,810 (“the Ericsson
28

The Micke Thesis

9 bewegungskompensierenden Codierverfahrens für Fernsehbildsignale” (“Comparison of a Predictive

11 Thomas Micke (“the Micke Thesis”) describes a study to establish performance bounds for motion12 compensated predictive coding and motion-compensated interpolative coding. (Girod Opp. Decl. at
13 ¶ 84.) The bounds are information-theoretic bounds based on a mathematical analysis and supported
14 by statistical measurements performed in computer simulations with digitized video sequences. (Id.)
15 Such information theoretic bounds are non-constructive, i.e., they do not provide a blueprint of how

Accordingly, as Professor Girod — who personally supervised the work described in the

18 Micke thesis — explains, the statistical measurements of the Micke Thesis do not require a complete
19 video coder implementation. (Id. at ¶ 88.) The computer code provided in the Micke Thesis

In its summary judgment brief, Dell maintains that the Ericsson ‘810 patent “employs Interpolation
Error as a means of improving the picture.” (Dell Br. at 6.) But this Court has already rejected
24 Dell’s contention that the Ericsson ‘810 patent discloses “codes that describe deviations from
interpolated blocks” as set forth in Claim 12 of the Haskell ‘226 patent, because any interpolation
25 error disclosed in the Ericsson ‘810 patent concerns intraframe interpolation, not the interframe
interpolation required by Claim 12. (Ex. 10, July 5, 2007 Order (D.I. 1939) at 10-12.)

LEGAL STANDARDS

A.

3

Summary judgment is appropriate only where “the pleadings, depositions, answers to

Summary Judgment

4 interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no
5 genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
6 law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). Where,
7 as here, “the moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, it cannot obtain summary judgment
8 unless it presents evidence so compelling that no rational jury would fail to award judgment for the
9 moving party.” United States v. Boyce, 148 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1080 (S.D. Cal. 2001). Furthermore,
10 “[w]hen ruling on a motion for summary judgment, all of the nonmovant’s evidence is to be
11 credited, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the nonmovant’s favor.” Caterpillar Inc. v.
12 John Deere & Co., 224 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2000).
13

A summary judgment determination must also be guided by the appropriate burden of proof.

14 If the Court determines that a reasonable jury applying the proper burden of proof — in this case
15 clear-and-convincing evidence — could find for the non-movant, then there exists a genuine issue of
16 material fact that precludes granting of summary judgment. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,
17 477 U.S. 242, 254-55 (1986).
18

Obviousness

19

Because every patent is presumed valid, accused infringers face a “high burden of showing

20 invalidity on summary judgment.” Schumer v. Lab. Computer Sys., Inc., 308 F.3d 1304, 1315 (Fed.
21 Cir. 2002). “[A] party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit clear and
22 convincing evidence of invalidity so that no reasonable jury could find otherwise.” Eli Lilly and Co.
23 v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (emphasis added). If evidence is presented
24
25 library in the world known to shelve a copy of the Micke thesis was not accessible to the public
before that date. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 82.) Even in that one library, no meaningful subject-matter
26 index existed that would have directed persons interested in the art to the Micke thesis. (Id. at 83.)
Accordingly, factual disputes exist as to whether the Micke thesis qualifies as prior art.

A claimed invention can be found obvious only “if the differences between the subject matter

6 sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been
7 obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.” 35 U.S.C. §
8 103(a). Obviousness is ultimately a question of law based on underlying determinations of fact.
9 Forest Labs., Inc. v. Ivax Pharms., Inc., 501 F.3d 1263, 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The underlying
10 factual issues to be considered in an obviousness analysis include “four general types, all of which
11 must be considered by the trier of fact: (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the level of
12 ordinary skill in the art; (3) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art; and (4)
13 any objective indicia of nonobviousness.” Crown Operations Int’l, Ltd. v. Solutia Inc.. 289 F.3d
14 1367, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the
15 primacy of those factors in determining whether a patent is invalid for obviousness. See KSR Int’l.
16 Co. v. Teleflex Inc., --- U.S. ---, 127 S. Ct. 1727, 1734 (2007) (citing Graham v. John Deere Co., 383
17 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966)).
18

“[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements;

19 instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the
20 legal conclusion of obviousness.” KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1741 (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988
21 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Thus, “the burden falls on the patent challenger to show by clear and convincing
22 evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had reason to attempt to make the
23 composition or device, or carry out the claimed process, and would have had a reasonable
24 expectation of success in doing so.” PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc., 491 F.3d 1342,
25 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing, inter alia, KSR, 127 S. Ct. at 1740).
26

In that regard, the Supreme Court has “acknowledged the importance of identifying ‘a reason

27 that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in
28

the way the claimed new invention does’ in an obviousness determination.” Takeda Chem. Indus.,

ARGUMENT

9

Dell’s summary judgment arguments fail for at least two reasons. First, Dell fails to make

10 the prima facie showing required to sustain a summary judgment motion on an issue, such as
11 obviousness, where Dell bears the burden of proof. Second, any such showing is amply rebutted by
12 affirmative proof of nonobviousness that — at a minimum — establishes a genuine dispute for trial.
13 Accordingly, Dell’s motion for summary judgment should be denied.
14

A.

Dell Fails To Present A Prima Facie Case Of Obviousness.

15

“The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of coming forward with

16 evidence that demonstrates the absence of a genuine material question of disputed fact and
17 establishes that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a mater of law.” Arkie Lure, Inc. v. Gene
18 Larew Tackle, Inc., 119 F.3d 953, 955 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Here, for the reasons set forth below, the
19 “proof” presented by Dell in support of its summary judgment motion — even if unrebutted —
20 would not support a finding of obviousness. Dell’s motion for summary judgment therefore fails
21 from the outset. See SRAM Corp. v. AD-II Eng’g, Inc., 465 F.3d 1351, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (“[A]
22 moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit such clear and
23 convincing evidence of facts underlying invalidity that no reasonable jury could find otherwise.”).

Dell Presents No Proof That The PictureTel Patents
Collectively Disclose All Of The Elements Of Claim 12.

Dell seeks summary judgment on a single invalidity theory — that the PictureTel references

27 render obvious Claim 12 of the Haskell ‘226 patent. In so doing, Dell ignores the high burden it
28

must meet to establish that Claim 12 of the Haskell ‘226 patent is invalid on summary judgment.

1 For example, rather than presenting an element-by-element analysis to demonstrate that the elements
2 of Claim 12 were known in the art, Dell simply references the report of its expert, Edward Delp, as
3 purportedly demonstrating that “the PictureTel patents disclose all of the limitations of claim 12.”
4 (Dell Br. at 6.) But Dr. Delp’s report fails to support that proposition for at least two reasons.
5

First, Dr. Delp provides no analysis of structural identity or equivalence for either means-

6 plus-function element of Claim 12. (See Ex. 11, Sept. 14, 2007 Delp Report at ¶¶ 111-122.) He fails
7 to discuss the corresponding structures identified by the Court, specifies no particular structures
8 taught, suggested, or otherwise rendered obvious by the PictureTel patents, and offers no explanation
9 how any such structures could be considered identical or equivalent. (See id.) Instead, Dr. Delp
10 treats Claim 12 as though it were simply a combination of certain “techniques” — motion
11 compensated prediction with prediction error, motion compensated interpolation, and the coding of
12 interpolation error codes. (See, e.g., id. at ¶ 114.) Such analysis — addressing certain functions
13 performed by the decoder of Claim 12 without considering the claimed structures — is insufficient
14 as a matter of law to demonstrate obviousness. See In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189, 1196-97
15 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (reversing obviousness determination where PTO considered claimed function but
16 not structure).
17

To the extent that Dr. Delp addresses corresponding structure at all, he erroneously focuses

18 on individual sub-components of the corresponding structures identified by the Court — such as
19 adders, decoders, DCT-1, shift circuits, and averagers (see Ex. 11, Sept. 14, 2007 Delp Report at ¶
20 89; Ex. 14, Delp Dep. Tr. at 127) — rather than the corresponding structures as a whole. See
21 Odetics Inc. v. Storage Tech. Corp., .185 F.3d 1259, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (“The individual
22 components, if any, of an overall structure that corresponds to the claimed function are not claim
23 limitations. Rather, the claim limitation is the overall structure corresponding to the claimed
24 function.”) (emphasis added). Because he focuses on sub-components, Dr. Delp fails to opine that
25 the structures as a whole were known in the art, or that it would have been obvious to combine the
26 specific circuitry that this Court identified for the first means-plus-function element with the specific

1 circuitry that this Court identified for the second means-plus-function element, as set forth in Claim
2 12.5
Second, Dr. Delp’s report plainly fails to identify any disclosure within the PictureTel patents

3

4 of the claimed “codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks.” As this Court has held,
5 such codes “describe deviations from interpolat[ed] blocks with reference to interframe
6 interpolation.” (Ex. 10, July 5, 2007 Order (D.I. 1939) at 10-12.) But Dr. Delp’s analysis of the
7 PictureTel patents —a single claim chart quoting excerpts of the Ericsson ‘914 patent without
8 explanation or analysis — identifies nothing in those patents that can remotely be considered
9 interframe interpolation error codes.6 (Ex. 12, Sept. 14, 2007 Delp Report Ex. H.) Because Dell has
10 presented no proof that the PictureTel patents disclose all of the required claim elements, Dell’s
11 motion for summary judgment that those patents in combination render obvious Claim 12 of the
12 Haskell ‘226 patent should be denied.7

Dell Presents No Proof That It Would Have
Been Obvious To Combine Or Modify The Teachings Of
The PictureTel Patents To Arrive At The Invention Of Claim 12.

Dell likewise fails to present proof that it would have been obvious to modify the teachings
of the PictureTel patents to arrive at the invention of Claim 12. Dell seeks to sidestep its burden by

18

5

23

7

Dell relies heavily on the Supreme Court’s guidance in KSR concerning claims that cover “a
19 combination of familiar elements.” (Dell Br. at 9.) To the extent that Claim 12 can be considered a
“combination” of elements, it combines two specific structures with two specific functions.
20
6 Absent any disclosure of “codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks,” the PictureTel
21 patents also necessarily fail to disclose the required “means responsive . . . to said codes that
describe deviations from interpolated blocks” or the claimed “interpolated blocks” (which are
22 generated using “codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks”).
Dell attempts to side-step the absence of “codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks”
24 in the PictureTel patents by contending that MPT’s expert somehow “admitted” that Claim 12 does
not require interpolation error codes. (Dell Br. at 10-11.) Dell mischaracterizes that testimony.
25 Because Claim 12 is an apparatus claim directed to a decoder, Professor Girod simply noted that the
claim contains no process step of encoding interpolation error. (Ex. 13, Nov. 20, 2007 Girod Dep.
26 Tr. at 159-161.) In any event, Professor Girod’s testimony cannot obviate limitations dictated by the
plain claim language and this Court’s claim construction.

1 asserting that it need only demonstrate some reason for a person skilled in the art to apply the use of
2 interpolation error codes to the teachings of PictureTel patents. (Dell Br. at 11.) As an initial matter,
3 Dell fails to prove its premise — i.e., that the PictureTel references disclose the limitations of Claim
4 12 but for the use of interpolation error codes. For example, Dell presents no evidence — or even
5 argument — establishing that the PictureTel patents disclose or render obvious circuitry equivalent
6 to that identified by this Court as corresponding structure for the two means-plus-function elements
7 of Claim 12.
8

Furthermore, even assuming for the purpose of argument that the PictureTel references

9 collectively disclose everything required by Claim 12 except the use of interpolation error codes,
10 Dell’s motion for summary judgment nevertheless fails because Dell presents no proof that it would
11 have been obvious to integrate that technology with the PictureTel patents to arrive at the invention
12 of Claim 12. At bottom, Dell argues that it would generally have been obvious to use interpolation
13 error codes in interpolative coding systems somehow. (Dell Br. at 11-13.) But it fails to
14 demonstrate that — out of the myriad ways interpolation error codes could be implemented in a
15 video compression system — the specific implementation claimed in the Haskell ‘226 patent would
16 have been an obvious choice. Specifically, Dell provides no explanation why a person skilled in the
17 art would implement the use of interpolation error codes using circuitry identical or equivalent to the
18 corresponding structure identified by this Court, as opposed to some other configuration.
19 Accordingly, because Dell has not presented prima facie proof that it would have been obvious to
20 combine or modify the teachings of the PictureTel patents to arrive at the invention of Claim 12,
21 Dell’s motion for summary judgment should be denied.

As MPT’s Expert Explains, The PictureTel Patents
Do Not Disclose The Elements Of Claim 12 Or Render
Obvious Their Combination As Set Forth In The Claim.

3

Dell rests its obviousness case almost exclusively on the conclusory opinions of Edward

1

4 Delp. Even if those opinions sufficed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness, which — as
5 explained above — they do not, MPT’s own expert has formed contrary opinions that respond to Dr.
6 Delp’s analyses and demonstrate the falsity of his conclusions. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶¶ 64-75.) In
7 and of itself, such contradictory expert testimony suffices to foreclose summary judgment in Dell’s
8 favor on the factual question of anticipation. See, e.g., Scanner Tech. Corp. v. ICOS Vision Sys.
9 Corp., 253 F. Supp. 2d 624, 639 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“The parties’ conflicting expert witness opinions
10 regarding, inter alia, what the prior art discloses and how a person of ordinary skill in the art would
11 interpret it preclude a finding of summary judgment.”).
12

First, Professor Girod identifies several elements of Claim 12 that are missing from the

13 teachings of the PictureTel references. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶¶ 69-72.) He explains that because the
14 compression systems described in the PictureTel patents do not use interpolation error codes, they do
15 not disclose “codes that describe deviations from interpolated blocks.” (Id. at ¶¶ 70-72.) As a result,
16 they also fail to disclose any “means responsive to . . . codes that describe deviations from
17 interpolated blocks to develop said interpolated blocks.” (Id.) In addition, Professor Girod opines
18 that the PictureTel reference disclose no circuitry or structure equivalent to the corresponding
19 structure for that means-plus-function element: the combination of Decoder 25, DCT-1 34, Adder
20 35, Shift Circuits 31 and 39, and Averager 32.8 (Id.)
21
22
Because the PictureTel patents share much of the same written description and cross-reference one
another, Dell’s expert presented his obviousness analysis concerning the PictureTel patents by
24 reference to the Ericsson ‘914 patent as “a primary example.” (Ex. 11, Sept. 14, 2007 Delp Report
at ¶ 114.) He provided no claim charts for any of the other PictureTel patents, and neither he nor
25 Dell has identified any pertinent teachings in those other patents that are not also set forth in the
Ericsson ‘914 patent. (Id. at ¶¶ 114-122.) Accordingly, Professor Girod likewise addressed the
26 teachings of the PictureTel patents by reference to the Ericsson ‘914 patent. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶¶
69-70.)

Second, Professor Girod testified that the prior art as a whole fails to disclose “codes that

2 describe deviations form interpolated blocks” such as those described in the Haskell ‘226 patent and
3 processed by the decoder of Claim 12. (Ex. 13, Nov. 20, 2007 Girod Dep. Tr. at 54-58.) Those
4 codes, as illustrated by the corresponding structure identified by this Court, are transform-coded,
5 motion-compensated interframe interpolation error signals. But the prior art contains no teaching of
6 motion-compensated interframe interpolation error signals, let alone transform-coded ones. (Id.)
7 Dell does not even attempt to demonstrate otherwise.9
Third, Professor Girod explains that, even if some flavor of interframe interpolation error

8

9 was known in the prior art, a host of effective video compression technologies were available in the
10 field during the relevant time-frame, and the performance of a given combination of technologies
11 could not be readily predicted. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 53.) As such, the potential combinations of
12 known, beneficial compression technologies far exceeded what could reasonably be considered a
13 finite set of potential solutions. (Id.) Nor were the benefits achieved by the particular coding system
14 described in the Haskell ‘226 patent predictable, since extended experimentation was required to
15 assess the performance of a system combining any specific set of coding technologies. (Id. at ¶ 62.)
16 Therefore, Dr. Delp’s opinion that a person of skill in the art would have been motivated to combine
17 interpolation error codes with the PictureTel patents — and to do so in the same way taught by the
18 Haskell ‘226 patent — is an exercise in pure hindsight, piecing together the elements of Claim 12
19 from diverse sources using the patent itself as a guide. (Id. at ¶ 75.)
Fourth, Professor Girod responds to Dr. Delp’s assertion that the use of interpolation error

20

21 codes as a known solution to the problem of “perceptual artifacts” created by interpolation was
22
Dell cites several documents as purportedly establishing that some use of interframe interpolation
error codes was known in the art. (Dell Br. at 12-13.) Two of those documents, the Micke Thesis
24 and CCITT Document #81, are not even prior art, and fail in any case to disclose transform coding
of interpolation error. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶¶ 76-88.) The Lodge and Tanimoto papers fail to
25 disclose interframe interpolation error signals, let alone motion-compensated or transform-coded
interframe interpolation signals. (Ex. 23, Lodge Paper; Ex. 24, Tanimoto Paper) And the Digital
26 Pictures textbook does not disclose any form of interpolation error codes. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶
89.)

1 known in the art. (Dell Br. at 12.) As Professor Girod explains, conventional wisdom in the field
2 dictated otherwise. For example, since motion compensation artifacts were usually caused by a
3 failure of the motion estimator to extract the true motion of an object, a person of ordinary skill
4 would have typically looked for ways to improve the reliability and accuracy of the motion estimator
5 to eliminate visual artifacts, rather than coding interpolation error. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 54.) In

7 to instruct the receiver to omit motion-compensated interpolation and use frame repetition instead.

10 known solution to visible interpolation artifacts are unavailing. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 54.) The
11 Micke thesis, for example, presents an analysis of theoretical boundaries of compression systems,
12 but discloses no actual coding system.10 (Id. at ¶¶ 84, 88.) Therefore, the Micke thesis discloses
13 nothing about video quality, let alone interpolation artifacts. (Id.) Indeed, Professor Girod — an
14 expert in the field who supervised the work described in the Micke thesis — testified that he
15 personally never made the connection between transmitting interpolation error and visual artifacts.
16 (Ex. 13, Nov. 20, 2007 Girod Dep. Tr. at 62-63.)
The other reference cited by Dell, a textbook authored by a named inventor of the Haskell

17

18 ‘226 patent, fares no better. Dell points to two sentences from the diverse teachings of the 500-page
19 textbook noting that generic “side information” — not interpolation error codes — may be
20 transmitted to reduce artifacts caused by faulty interpolation. (Dell Br. at 5.) Such side information
21 could include many types of signals other than interpolation error codes, including the sort of bit
22 stream flag described above, which triggers suspension of interpolation in favor of frame repetition.
23 (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶¶ 54, 89.)

Dell does not ague that the Micke Thesis is prior art, but rather only that it evidences a reason to
26 combine. (Dell Br. at FN 7.) As set forth herein, however, the Micke Thesis does not provide a
motivation to modify the teachings of the prior art. (See also Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 81.)

In sum, ample evidence exists from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the

2 invention of Claim 12 is not invalid for obviousness. Because genuine factual disputes remain for
3 trial, Dell’s motion for summary judgment should be denied.

“Evidence rebutting a prima face case of obviousness can include . . . evidence that the prior
art teaches away from the claimed invention in any material respect.” In re Sullivan, 498 F.3d 1345,
1351 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing In re Peterson, 315 F.3d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). Here, as
explained by Professor Girod, the PictureTel patents themselves teach away from the invention of
Claim 12. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 73.) Such evidence alone suffices to present a dispute of fact
precluding summary judgment. See Winner Intern. Royalty Corp. v. Wang, 202 F.3d 1340, 1349-50
(Fed. Cir. 2000) (“What a references teaches and whether it teaches toward or away from the
claimed invention are questions of fact. . . . If [the prior art] did in fact teach away from [the
claimed invention], then that finding alone can defeat [an] obviousness claim.”).

The PictureTel Patents Teach Away From The Claimed Invention.

Specifically, a person of ordinary skill in the art considering the PictureTel patents as a whole
— as Dell contends they must be considered — would recognize that they describe the evolution of
a video compression system. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 66.) The Hinman ‘350 patent lays out a
motion-compensated hybrid coding scheme that uses a form of interframe interpolation for postprocessing, but without any form of interpolation error codes. (Id.) The next five PictureTel patents
in chronological order describe a series of relatively minor refinements of the original system. (Id. at
¶ 67.)
But the final PictureTel patent, the Ericsson ‘810 patent, discloses a significant — and
purportedly beneficial — modification of the original system. (Id. at ¶ 68.) First, a novel
compression scheme using a resolution pyramid is introduced. (Id.) At the same time, interframe
interpolation is eliminated altogether. (Id.) Thus, the PictureTel patents as a whole would have
taught a person of ordinary skill in the art to abandon interframe interpolation entirely in favor of a
resolution pyramid compression scheme. (Id.) The PictureTel references therefore teach away from

2 judgment. See Winner, 202 F.3d at 1349.

Objective Evidence Of Nonobviousness Precludes Summary Judgment.

Finally, Dell completely ignores other objective evidence that the invention of Claim 12 is

5 nonobvious, including evidence of the failure of others to arrive at the invention, the commercial
6 success of the invention, and the licensing of the invention by others. (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶¶ 907 92.) Evidence of such “secondary considerations” must be considered when evaluating obviousness.
8 Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co., 234 F.3d 654, 667 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“Our precedents clearly hold that
9 secondary considerations, when present, must be considered in determining obviousness.”); Demaco
10 Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing Ltd., 851 F.2d 1387, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (“Indeed, evidence
11 of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record.”).
12

Here, several secondary considerations demonstrate that the invention of Claim 12 is

13 nonobvious, thereby raising genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment. For
14 example, products that use the claimed invention have been highly successful in the marketplace.
15 (Girod Opp. Decl. at ¶ 90.) The claimed invention is used in numerous video coding standards,
16 including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, WMV-9, VC-1, and others. (Id.) The invention of Claim 12 has
17 contributed to the success of these products by reducing the bandwidth needed to transmit, or by
18 reducing the quantity of storage needed to store, high-quality video bitstreams. (Id.) In fact,
19 Professor Girod has explained that other video coding technologies that do not use the claimed
20 inventions have not been as commercially successful. (Id.)
21

Furthermore, licenses showing industry respect for the claimed invention also support the

22 conclusion that Claim 12 is nonobvious and therefore raise a genuine factual question. (Id. at ¶ 91.)
23 Lucent’s licensing agreements that specifically identify the Haskell ‘226 patent, and Lucent’s
24 licensing negotiation documents which refer to the Haskell ‘226 patent, indicate that the Haskell
25 ‘226 patent has been a focal point of negotiations for broader licenses with third parties. (Id.)
26 Because a host of disputed issues of fact therefore remain for trial, Dell’s motion for summary
27 judgment that Claim 12 of the Haskell ‘226 patent is invalid for obviousness should be denied.
