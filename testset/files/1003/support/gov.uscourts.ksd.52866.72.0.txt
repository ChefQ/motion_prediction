DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE CLAIMS OF THE
PLAINTIFFS MARK MONSOUR AND SHEILA MONSOUR
COMES NOW the Defendant, Menu Maker Foods, Inc., by and through its attorneys of
record John Val Wachtel and Alexander B. Mitchell of Klenda, Mitchell, Austerman &
Zuercher, L.L.C., and pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, hereby moves for summary judgment
dismissing the individual claims of the plaintiffs Mark Monsour and Sheila Monsour, on grounds
that they are not proper plaintiff’s in this litigation and they lack standing to bring as individuals
the claims made in the Complaint against the defendant. There are no disputed issues of material
fact with respect to this issue, and the Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In
compliance with Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and D.Kan.Rule 7.1, the
Defendant has submitted herewith a memorandum in support of this motion.
WHEREFORE, the defendant prays for an order of this court granting summary
judgment and dismissing the claims made in the Complaint by the individual plaintiffs Mark
Monsour and Sheila Monsour.
Respectfully submitted,
KLENDA, MITCHELL, AUSTERMAN &
ZUERCHER, L.L.C.
