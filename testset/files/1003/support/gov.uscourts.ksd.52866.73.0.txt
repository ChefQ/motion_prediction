DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT
COMES NOW the defendant, by and through its attorneys of record John Val Wachtel
and Alexander B. Mitchell, of Klenda, Mitchell, Austerman & Zuercher, L.L.C., and hereby
submits this memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of
the claims of the individual plaintiffs Mark Monsour and Sheila Monsour on grounds that they
are not proper plaintiffs in this case and that they lack standing to pursue individual causes of
action against the defendant in that those claims are solely the claims of the corporate plaintiff,
Monsour’s, Inc.
STATEMENT OF THE NATURE OF THE CASE
This litigation is a suit for damages based upon the plaintiffs’ allegations that the
defendant breached an Asset Purchase Agreement (hereinafter “the Agreement”), pursuant to the
terms of which the plaintiff Monsour’s, Inc., sold, and the defendant acquired, certain food
service inventory items then belonging to the plaintiff Monsour’s, Inc. The Agreement also
provided that the defendant was to purchase substantially all of its fresh produce requirements
from Monsour’s, Inc., under terms more specifically set out in the Agreement, and as the
Agreement was amended from time to time by the conduct and the oral agreements of the

defendant and Monsour’s, Inc. The Agreement was executed by all parties to this litigation. The
Agreement also contained a clause pursuant to which the parties agreed that the Agreement
would be construed according to the laws of the State of Missouri.
On June 30, 2005, the plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this case. The Complaint
contained six counts. Counts I and II alleged breach of contract for food service item purchases,
Counts III and IV alleged breach of contract on produce purchases, Count V alleged fraud, and
Count VI alleged that the plaintiffs were entitled to punitive damages. The defendant answered
the Complaint denying the plaintiffs’ allegations of breach of contract, fraud and punitive
damages. Discovery proceeded, and in January 2006, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Counts
V and VI – the claims for fraud and seeking punitive damages. But for the depositions of the
parties’ damages experts, discovery is complete.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
I. The Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment “… shall be rendered where the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).
In applying this standard, the court views the evidence and all reasonable
inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See
Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 665, 670 (10th Cir. 1998) (citing
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct.
1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). A fact is “material” if, under the applicable
substantive law, it is “essential to the proper disposition of the claim.” Id. (citing
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 89 L.Ed.2d
202 (1986)). An issue of fact is “genuine” if “there is sufficient evidence on each
side so that a rational trier of fact could resolve the issue either way.” Id. (citing
Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (1986)).
Carolina Industrial Products, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., 189 F.Supp.2d 1147, 1157 (D.Kan. 2001).
The moving party bears the initial burden of showing or demonstrating an absence of a
genuine issue of material fact and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Alder v. WalMart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 665, 670 (10th Cir. 1998). “In attempting to meet that standard, the
Movant may simply point out to the court a lack of evidence for the other party on an essential
element of that party’s claim.” Carolina Industrial, 189 F.Supp.2d at 1157 (internal citations
omitted).
Once the moving party meets its burden under the summary judgment standard, the
burden shifts to the party opposing summary judgment – the non-moving party – to set forth
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477

Page 7 of 14

U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 89 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). “The non-moving party must ‘set forth
specific facts that would be admissible in evidence in the event of trial from which a rational trier
of fact could find for the nonmovant.’ Alder, 144 F.3d at 671.” Carolina Industrial, 189
F.Supp.2d at 1157.
II. The Plaintiffs Mark Monsour And Sheila Monsour
Are Not Proper Parties To This Litigation
The defendant contends that the causes of action raised by the plaintiffs in their
Complaint are causes of action which, under either the law of Missouri or Kansas, can only be
raised by the plaintiff Monsour’s, Inc. Although all of the plaintiffs executed the Agreement
(Statement of Facts, ¶ 8.), it is clear from the face of the Agreement that the “Seller” was
Monsour’s, Inc.
The Agreement contained representations and warranties of the parties. (Statement of
Facts, ¶ 3.) Under Section 6.1(1) of the Agreement the “Seller” represented that it was the sole
owner of the assets to be conveyed to the defendant. (Statement of Facts, ¶ 4.) Under Section
6.1(2) of the Agreement, the “Seller” was defined as Monsour’s, Inc., a corporation in good
standing under the laws of the State of Kansas. (Statement of Facts, ¶ 5.)

Under Section

6.1(3)of the Agreement, “Seller” represented that it was a corporation owned by Mark Monsour
and Sheila Monsour. (Statement of Facts, ¶ 6.) Neither Mark Monsour or Sheila Monsour
conveyed any personal assets to the defendant pursuant to the Agreement. (Statement of Facts,
¶¶ 23 and 26.) Mark Monsour signed the Agreement in his individual capacity in case he owned
any of the assets being conveyed under the Agreement. (Statement of Facts, ¶ 27.) Given the
uncontroverted facts, there can be no doubt that Mark Monsour and Sheila Monsour are not
proper plaintiffs to this litigation.
A. The Missouri Standard

Page 8 of 14

Every suit brought in the courts of the United States shall be brought “in the name of the
real party in interest.” F.R.Civ.P.17(a). In the present action, and under the terms of the
Agreement, the parties agreed that the Agreement would be construed according to the laws of
Missouri. (Statement of Facts, ¶ 7.) It is the law of Missouri which dictates and determines who
is the proper party to bring and prosecute this action.

“State law determines whether a

shareholder may maintain a direct, nonderivative action.” Geer v. Cox, 242 F.Supp.2d 1009,
1016 (2003). Under the facts herein, Monsour’s, Inc. is the real party at interest, and the
individual plaintiffs have no standing to bring any of the claims they assert.
The general rule in Missouri is that “[a] shareholder is without standing to sue in his
individual capacity for damages to the corporation.” Sequa Corporation v. Cooper, 128 S.W.3d
69, 75 (Mo.App. E.D. 2004), citing Warren v. Mercantile Bank of St. Louis, N.A., 11 S.W.3d
621, 622, (Mo.App. E.D. 1999). In Missouri, this is so even if all of the shareholders join in the
suit and the corporation does not have any creditors. See, Cook v. Cook, 143 S.W.3d 709, 712
(Mo.App. W.D. 2004).
In Sequa, Sequa Corporation owned 100 percent of the stock of Sequa Engineered
Services, Inc. (hereinafter “SESI”) which had entered into a sale of certain of its assets with the
defendants for cash and a promissory note. SESI later agreed to discount the note, allegedly
based on misrepresentations made by defendants, and both Sequa Corporation and SESI brought
suit. The appellate court agreed with the defendants that Sequa Corporation should have been
stricken as a plaintiff because it lacked standing. The court said, “Here Sequa was a 100 percent
owner of all the shares of stock in SESI. As such, it lacked standing to sue for defendants’
alleged misconduct. SESI was the corporation who suffered damage as a result of defendants’
alleged misconduct.” Sequa, 128 S.W.3d at 75. In reaching this conclusion, the Sequa court

8

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 73

Page 9 of 14

relied on both Warren v. Mercantile Bank of St. Louis, N.A., 11 S.W.3d 621 (Mo.App. E.D.
1999) and Jones v. Rennie, 690 S.W.2d 164 (Mo.App. 1985).
In Warren, the appellate court held that the Warrens, individuals who were the sole
owners of all of the stock of a corporation, had no standing to sue the defendant for alleged
misrepresentations made to Mr. Warren on the grounds that those representations were made to
him as vice president of the corporation.

This was true despite the fact that the alleged

misrepresentations resulted in the Warrens individually investing their own personal money.
The court found that the Warrens, as shareholders, lacked standing to sue individually, and
further held that, “[M]isrepresentation claims based on an agreement between two corporations
and/or statements made to the officers or sole shareholders of a corporation belong to the
corporation, not the individual officers or sole shareholders.” Warren, 11 S.W.3d at 623.
In Jones, the appellate court reversed a judgment for Jones who was president and 100
percent shareholder of a corporation for lack of standing to bring the suit. Again, the court found
that the alleged misrepresentations which were the basis of Jones’ suit were made to him in his
capacity as president and 100 percent shareholder, and not in his individual capacity. It further
found that all of the damages sustained from the alleged misrepresentations were sustained by
the corporation and not by Jones individually, even though he owned 100 percent of the stock.
See, Jones v. Rennie, 690 S.W.2d at 166.
In addition, it must be noted that, under Missouri law, a court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over any case in which the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the cause of action. See,
Cook v. Cook, 143 S.W.3d 709, 711 (Mo.App. W.D. 2004). As the individual plaintiffs in the
action currently before this Court lack standing to bring any of the claims alleged in their

9

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 73

Filed 05/23/2006

Page 10 of 14

Complaint, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the question and must dismiss the action as it relates
to them.
The facts of this case demonstrate that the individual plaintiffs herein lack standing to
bring any of the claims asserted in their Complaint under Missouri law. The Agreement was
between two corporations, and it defined the “seller” of all of the assets at issue to be the
corporation, Monsour’s, Inc., not the individual plaintiffs. Any damage caused by any of the
alleged misdeeds of defendant was that of the corporation, and only derivatively that of the
individuals. This is true whether or not the individuals are the only officers, directors and
owners of the corporation.
As noted above, the general rule in Missouri is that a shareholder, even a 100 percent
shareholder, does not have standing to bring a cause of action for damages to the corporation.
Missouri courts do recognize certain situations in which a shareholder, qua shareholder, does
have standing to bring a cause of action; however, in each of those situations the shareholder is
actually bringing an action for injury to the shareholder directly, and not to the corporation. For
example, shareholders “have been allowed to bring individual actions when they assert violation
of rights individual to them, such as claims they were personally denied their right to inspect the
corporate books and records under Section 351.215 RSMo.” Centerre Bank of Kansas City v.
Angle, 976 S.W.2d 608, 614 (Mo.App. 1998) (citing Dawson v. Dawson, 645 S.W.2d 120, 12526 (Mo.App. 1982)). Other examples were cited by the Centerre Bank court which then stated:
“These cases illustrate that individual actions are permitted, and provide the logical remedy, if
the injury is to the shareholders directly, and not to the corporation.” Centerre Bank, 976 S.W.2d
at 614 (emphasis added).

10

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 73

Filed 05/23/2006

Page 11 of 14

The individual plaintiffs in this present case do not fall within the ambit of the illustrative
cases cited by Centerre Bank precisely because the injury complained of is not to them
individually, but is to the corporation. To the contrary, should the individual plaintiffs herein
argue that the “injury” complained of is to them “and not to the corporation,” then the
corporation (Monsour’s, Inc.) is without standing and must be dismissed. Plaintiffs do not make
such a claim; rather, the “injury” complained of in each and every count remaining in plaintiffs’
Complaint is to the corporation directly, and to the individual plaintiffs only directly as directors
and owners of the corporation. As such, the individual plaintiffs lack standing, this Court lacks
jurisdiction over the question as to them, and they must be dismissed from this action.
B. The Kansas Standard
As pointed out above, state law determines whether a shareholder may maintain a direct,
nonderivative action. Greer, 242 F.Supp.2d at 2003. Should this Court see fit to apply Kansas
law to the matters at issue, the result would be no different that it would have been under
application of Missouri law. The general rule in Kansas is that a corporate shareholder may not
bring suit in his or her individual capacity to recover damages for injury suffered directly by the
corporation of which he or she is a shareholder. Richards v. Bryan, 19 Kan.App.2d 950, 961,
879 P.2d 639, 646 (1994).
The Kansas Court of Appeals has held that:
A shareholder may only litigate as an individual if the wrong to the corporation
inflicts a distinct and disproportionate injury on the shareholder, or if the action
involves a contractual right of the shareholder which exists independently of any
right of the corporation. Bagdon, 916 F.2d at 383, Moran v. Household Intern.,
Inc., 490 A.2d 1059, 1070 (Del.Ch. 1985.)
Id). (See also, Safety Technologies, L.C. v. Biotronix 2000, Inc., 136 F.Supp.2d 1169, 1174 at
FN 3 (D.Kan. 2001) and Carson v. Lynch Multimedia Corporation, 123 F.Supp.2d 1254, 1259

11

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 73

Filed 05/23/2006

Page 12 of 14

(D.Kan. 2000).) A claim is “said to be derivative if injury is either to the corporation directly or
to the shareholder but mediated through the corporation. Bagdon v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.,
916 F.2d 279, 383 (7th Cir. 1990) cert. denied 500 U.S. 952, 111 S.Ct. 2257, 114 L.Ed.2d 710
(1991).” Id. (See also Boyle v. Harris, 23 Kan.App.2d 686, 699, 923 P.2d 504, 512 (1996).)
“‘Whether a cause of action is individual or derivative must be determined from the nature of the
wrong alleged and the relief if any, which could result if plaintiff were to prevail.’” Id. (internal
citation omitted) See also Boyle, 23 Kan.App.2d at 699, 923 P.2d at 512.
Kansas has recognized an exception to this rule in the case of closely held corporations.
Richards, 19 Kan.App.2d at 966, 879 P.2d at 646.
[I]f a corporation is closely held, a court, in its discretion may treat an action
raising derivative claims as a direct action if it finds to do so will not (1) unfairly
expose the corporation to a multiplicity of actions; (2) materially prejudice the
interests of creditors in the corporation; or (3) interfere with a fair distribution of
the recovery among all interested persons.
Id. In the present case, Monsour’s, Inc., the corporate plaintiff, has brought the action against the
defendant, and for that reason the exception to the general rule does not apply. That being so,
then, at Kansas law, “[a] shareholder may only litigate as an individual if the wrong to the
corporation inflicts a distinct and disproportionate injury on the shareholder, or if the action
involves a contractual right of the shareholder which exists independently of any right of the
corporation.” Id. at, 961, 879 P.2d at 646.
An examination of the facts herein reveals that if the defendant breached its contract with
Monsour’s Inc., an action to recover any injuries caused thereby - a direct action on behalf of
that corporation - has been brought by Monsour’s, Inc. There is no derivative or indirect action
for the individual plaintiffs to bring. An examination of the pleadings reveals that the individual
plaintiffs have pled no injuries which are distinct from and/or disproportionate to those suffered

12

Case 6:05-cv-01204-JTM

Document 73

Filed 05/23/2006

Page 13 of 14

by the corporate plaintiff. Indeed the individual plaintiffs have suffered no such injuries. In the
Complaint, the individual plaintiffs have plead the exact injury and the exact damages that were
plead by Monsour’s Inc. (See Complaint, Doc. 1.)
At Kansas law, the present cause of action is that of Monsour’s, Inc. The individual
plaintiffs have neither suffered nor pled injuries which are distinct from and disproportionate to
the injuries allegedly suffered by Monsour’s, Inc. The individual plaintiffs have no separate
causes of action to bring against the defendant. The causes of action herein are those of
Monsour’s, Inc., and not those of the individual plaintiffs. If Kansas law were to be applied in
this case, the individual plaintiffs would not be proper parties, and their claims would and must
be dismissed.
It matters not that the individual plaintiffs executed the Agreement. Neither individual
plaintiff conveyed any asset to the defendant under the terms of the Agreement, and they do not
allege that they did. The individual plaintiffs signed the Agreement only as insurance against the
possibility that they in fact held assets which should have been assets of the corporation.
Assuming that Monsour’s, Inc. suffered injury at the hands of the defendant, the individual
plaintiffs suffered no injury which was distinct from and/or disproportionate to, the corporation’s
injuries There being no evidence to the contrary, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment
dismissing the individual plaintiffs as parties to this cause of action.
CONCLUSION
Based upon the undisputed facts of this case, and based as well upon the laws of both
Missouri and Kansas, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment. The individual plaintiffs
Mark Monsour and Sheila Monsour are not proper parties to this litigation. The have no
standing, and their claims must be dismissed.
