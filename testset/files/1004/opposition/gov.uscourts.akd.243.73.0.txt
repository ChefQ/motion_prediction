Case No.: A05-0006-CV (HRH)
(Consolidated)

RESPONSE OF PLAINTIFF STATE OF ALASKA TO
MOTION OF DEFENDANT UNITED STATES FOR
EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE BRIEF
Plaintiff State of Alaska does not oppose the Motion filed by Defendant United States on
September 11, 2006 requesting that the Court extend from September 11, 2006 to October 2,
2006 the due date for the response of the United States to the State of Alaska’s opening brief.
(the “Extension Motion”). The United States has proposed an order that properly rolls back
other subsequent briefing deadlines for the State and other parties consistent with the twenty-one
day extension requested by the United States.

The Extension Motion states that “Defendants have not heard from the other parties
[including the State] on the request for a twenty-one day enlargement of time.” Motion at 4
(bracketed material added). Because the State tries to respond promptly to requests for
extensions from opposing counsel, it wishes to note that it had in fact promptly consented to the
one-week extension that the United States originally requested. We understand that the United
States after receiving the State’s consent to a one-week extension decided just before filing the
Extension Motion to instead seek a twenty-one day extension. By that time outside counsel for
the State with whom the United States had communicated was traveling. Thus there was no
opportunity for the State to consider the United States’ request for a longer extension in advance
of the filing of the Extension Motion.
