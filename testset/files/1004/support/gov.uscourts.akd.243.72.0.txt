“Public Lands” (Docket Entry No. 68). Defendants also move to
correspondingly reschedule the dates for all subsequent briefs of
the parties on the “What Process” issue.
In support of the above-motion defendants show:
1. The Plaintiff State of Alaska’s Opening Brief Regarding
What Rules of Law Govern Establishment of Federal Reserved Water
Rights in Alaska and Determinations of “Public Lands” (Docket
Entry No. 68) was submitted pursuant to the Order (Docket Entry
No. 66) filed April 26, 2005. Pursuant to the Order (Docket Entry
No. 66), defendants’ response to Plaintiff State of Alaska’s
Opening Brief Regarding What Rules of Law Govern Establishment of
Federal Reserved Water Rights in Alaska and Determinations of
“Public Lands” (Docket Entry No. 68)is due to be filed on
September 11, 2006.
2. Because of the press of other matters, additional time is
needed by defendants to prepare and file a response to the State
of Alaska’s brief. In particular, on September 6, 2006, this
court in National Audubon Society et al. v. Dirk Kempthorne et
al., No. 1:05-cv-00008-JKS,2/ issued an order and preliminary

of federal action in that case, and established a supplemental
briefing schedule in that case. The subject matter of the
National Audubon Society case is a proposed oil and gas lease
sale in the Northeast Planning Area of the National Petroleum
Reserve - Alaska, that is scheduled to be held on September 27,
2006. This court has proposed to enjoin that sale and has called
for supplemental briefs with the parties to file initial briefs
on Friday September 15, 2006, and reply briefs on Thursday,
September 21. Because of this proposed decision and the
supplemental briefing schedule in the National Audubon Society
case, undersigned counsel has been unable to complete and file a
brief in response to the Plaintiff State of Alaska’s Opening
Brief Regarding What Rules of Law Govern Establishment of Federal
Reserved Water Rights in Alaska and Determinations of “Public
Lands” (Docket Entry No. 68) within the time initially provided
by the Court’s Order of April 26, 2006,
