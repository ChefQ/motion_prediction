Pursuant to the Court’s Scheduling Order, dated July 16, 2004, as modified on September
8, 2004, Defendant Oberthur Card Systems, S.A. (“Oberthur”) hereby submits its brief in support
of its Motion for Summary Judgment of Patent Invalidity.
INTRODUCTION
Leighton Technologies LLC (“Leighton”)1 alleges that Oberthur infringes 53 claims
(“Asserted Claims”) in four United States Letters Patents, namely -- U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,817,207
(“the ‘207 patent”) (Sharinn Ex. 1); 6,214,155 (“the ‘155 patent”) (Sharinn Ex. 3); 6,036,099
(“the ‘099 patent”) (Sharinn Ex. 2); and 6,514,367 (“the ‘367 patent”) (Sharinn Ex. 4)
(collectively the “Patents”). The Asserted Claims are strikingly similar from Patent to Patent.
During the prosecution of the ‘207, ‘155 and ‘099 patents Leighton argued, as this Court
summarized in its Markman decision (Sharinn Ex. 5 at 13), that those patents “improved on the
[prior art] by eliminating the need to specifically protect the electronic element during
lamination” through adding to the claims the limitations of “the absence of a non-electronic
carrier” and “directly”. It was on the basis of this alleged inventiveness that these three patents
issued.
The ‘367 patent was prosecuted last. As in the three earlier patents all of the ‘367
patent’s claims recited an unprotected electronic element. However, during the prosecution of
the ‘367 patent, the Examiner identified a theretofore uncited prior art Japanese patent that
expressly taught laminating an unprotected chip and antenna. No longer could Leighton rely on
the unprotected electronic element for patentability. Leighton therefore amended the claims in
the ‘367 patent application to recite that the pressure during cooling was at least 10% greater

1

“Leighton” is also used to refer to Keith Leighton, the inventor and an assignor to Leighton
Technologies LLC of the Patents.

Page 6 of 28

than the pressure during heating and argued that the prior art did not teach that limitation. The
Examiner accepted this argument and allowed the ‘367 patent.
Leighton’s amendment and argument was an admission that, absent the 10% limitation,
there was no inventiveness to excluding protection for his electronic element and that at least the
independent claims of the ‘207, ’099, and ‘155 patents, whose allowance was based upon that
feature, are invalid in light of the Japanese prior art.
A separate and independent ground exists for invalidating all the claims in the ‘367
patent. Prior art about which the Examiner was unaware teaches the greater than 10% limitation
that Leighton added to achieve patentability of the ‘367 patent. Together with the other prior art
this newly discovered prior art invalidates all the Asserted Claims, including the claims of the
‘367 patent.
Because there are no issues of material fact, each of the Asserted Claims is invalid,
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §102 or §103, in view of prior art that the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (“USPTO”) did not consider during prosecution of the respective claims.
Thus, summary judgment that the Asserted Claims are invalid is appropriate as a matter of law.

I.
A.

FACTS

The Relevant Prosecution History of the Four Patents
1. The ‘207 Patent
On October 7, 1996, Leighton filed the “utility” application that matured into the subject

‘207 patent. Because that application relied on the previously filed ‘685 provisional application,
its earliest effective filing date is October 17, 1995 for material disclosed in both applications.
In the first Patent Office action, the Examiner rejected all the claims then pending as
obvious in view of U.S. Patent No. 4,450,024 (“the ‘024 prior art patent”). In his response,
Leighton narrowed all his claims to recite an unprotected “electronic element in the absence of a

2

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 7 of 28

non-electronic carrier” positioned “directly” between “first and second plastic core sheets”. In
its Markman decision, the Court held that by this language and the arguments made to the
Examiner “Leighton relinquished any interpretation of ‘non-electronic carrier’ that includes any
protection for the electronic element”. Sharinn Ex. 5, at 27.
2. The ‘099 Patent
Leighton filed the application that matured into the ‘099 patent (Exhibit 2) on August 18,
1997, approximately 10 months after filing the application that matured into the ‘207 patent.
The ‘099 patent application is a continuation-in-part of the ‘207 patent application.
Whereas the ‘207 patent is directed to a hot lamination process for the manufacture of a
contactless card, the ‘099 patent purports to relate to a so-called dual function card, which is a
combination contact/contactless card. Despite the fact that the patents relate to different types of
cards, the specifications of the ‘207 and the ‘099 patents share virtually the same disclosure.
Moreover, except for the additional milling step after lamination necessary to form a dual
interface card, the claims in the ‘099 patent and the ‘207 patent are virtually identical.
Given that similarity the prosecution of the ‘099 patent not surprisingly bears a strong
resemblance to that of the ‘207 patent. Repeating his amendments and arguments in the ‘207
patent application, Leighton amended all his claims in the ‘099 patent to require that the
“electronic element” have no protection. The Examiner thereupon allowed the claims.

3. The ‘155 Patent
Approximately two years after filing the application that matured into the ‘207 patent and
approximately one year after filing the application that matured into the ‘099 patent, on
September 22, 1998, Leighton filed the ‘155 patent application. Like the ‘207 patent, the ‘155
patent relates to contactless cards. The ‘155 patent differs from the ‘207 patent in that its claims
do not recite a printing (or coating) step.
The prosecution of the ‘155 patent application followed the prosecution of the ‘207
patent application. As might be expected due to Leighton’s success in the ‘207 patent
application distinguishing over the prior art, Leighton sua sponte amended the claims after the
‘155 patent application was filed to recite “in the absence of a non-electronic carrier” and
“directly”. Because of this sua sponte amendment, the Examiner subsequently allowed the
pending claims on June 5, 2000.
4. The ‘367 Patent
Leighton filed the application that matured into the ‘367 patent on August 5, 1999. By
that time, Leighton had the benefit of his experience in the prosecution of the ‘207 and ‘099
patents. As a result, all the originally filed claims in the ‘367 patent contained the limitations
“non-electronic carrier” and “directly” that Leighton had been required to add to the previous
applications to achieve their allowance.
The ‘367 patent is a continuation of the ‘099 patent and therefore, except with respect to
matters not here relevant, the specifications are identical. It is also a continuation-in-part of the
‘207 patent. Its claims differ from those in its parent, the ‘099 patent, principally in the absence
of a printing (or coating) step.
The Examiner for the ‘367 patent discovered prior art that had not been found during the
prosecution of Leighton’s three previous Patents: Japanese Patent 6-176214 (“JP ‘214”).

4

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Page 9 of 28

Sharinn Ex. 6 and Ex. 24. According to the Examiner, JP ‘214 taught laminating an unprotected
chip and antenna:
Japanese Patent ‘214 taught a process for forming a smart card
which included the steps of laminating with heat and pressure an
assembly which included an IC chip 11 and a thin coil 12 (an
antenna). The IC chip 11 and antenna 12 were disposed
unsupported between plastic films 14. On either side of plastic
films 14 were additional plastic films 15. The assembly was
disposed in a press and heat and pressure were applied in
order to laminate the layers together to form a smart card.
(Sharinn Ex. 7, OCS_C_045486) (emphasis added).
Examination of JP ‘214
confirms the Examiner’s
conclusion that JP ‘214 teaches the
absence of non-electronic carrier,
i.e., it directly places an electronic
element between plastic core
sheets without any protection, as
shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of JP ‘214,
which are reproduced at the right.
JP ‘214 expressly states that the IC module “houses components such as an IC memory (not
shown in the drawings) and a rectification circuit (not shown in the drawings) ….” Sharinn Ex.
6 and Ex. 24, ¶6. The thin IC module has a thickness of about 0.3 mm. Id. JP ‘214 also
explains that there are two PVC resin plastic films 14, show in Fig. 3, that serve as “first and
second plastic core sheets”. Sharinn Ex. 6 and Ex. 24, ¶7; Figs. 2 and 3. JP ‘214 explains that
the thin IC module is positioned directly between PVC resin plastic films: “[the PVC resin
plastic films are] interposed so that they sandwich the thin IC module and thin
transmission/receiving coil [12] ….” Sharinn Ex. 6 and Ex. 24, ¶7.

5

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 10 of 28

Moreover, the IC module is encapsulated using heat and pressure to form the thin noncontact IC card:
‘[H]eating and compression are applied from both surfaces with
hot plates 20 and 20, thereby fixing and integrating the elements.’
Sharinn Ex. 6 and Ex. 24, ¶¶7-9.
Since JP ‘214 teaches encapsulating the thin IC module directly between plastic core
sheets in the absence of a non-electronic carrier, no longer could Leighton argue that laminating
an unprotected “electronic element” added patentability. Leighton had to come up with a new
strategy for patentability.
As filed, the independent claims of the ‘367 patent only required “cooling said core while
applying a second pressure to said core”. Those claims said nothing about the relationship of the
pressure used during heating and that used during cooling. To distinguish over the prior art,
Leighton amended the ‘367 claims to add a limitation to all the ‘367 claims that required the
pressure during the cooling to be “at least 10% greater” than the pressure during the heating.
Leighton then argued to the USPTO that his inventive contribution to the prior art was cooling
the core with at least 10 % greater pressure than the pressure used during heating. He
represented that the prior art only taught maintaining the same pressure during cooling as was
used during heating:
One skilled in the art would not be able to conclude that the (prior
art) teaches increasing the pressure during the cooling process. …
There is no teaching or suggestion in [the prior art] to increase the
pressure during cooling to at least 10% greater than the
pressure applied during the heating.”
Sharinn Ex. at 7, OCS_C_045499 (emphasis in original).
Relying upon Leighton’s statement that none of the prior art of record taught or suggested
the greater than 10% limitation, the Examiner allowed the claims stating:

6

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 11 of 28

None of the prior art of record taught or suggested that one skilled in the
art at the time the invention was made to apply a second pressure upon the
assembly during cooling wherein the second pressure was at least 10%
greater than the first pressure applied during assembly and heating.
Sharinn Ex. 7 at OCS_C_045509 (emphasis added).
Thus, all the ‘367 patent claims, unlike the independent claims in the three preceding
Patents (the ‘207, ‘155 and ‘099 patents), recite the “at least 10% greater” pressure limitation.
B.

The Prior Art
1. Prior Art Of Record and Keith Leighton’s Testimony
By adding the greater than 10% limitation to the claims of the ‘367 patent application in

response to the Examiner’s rejection that JP ‘214 taught laminating an unprotected electronic
element, Leighton effectively conceded that JP ‘214, together with the other prior art of record,
taught the lamination process as claimed in the ‘207, ‘099, and ‘155 patents.

Oberthur

accepts Leighton’s concession and will not prolong this brief to discuss the prior art of record in
the Patent Office in which both the Examiner and Leighton found each element of Leighton’s
alleged inventive lamination process except for the greater than 10% limitation. We leave to the
detailed claim charts in Appendix A our explanation that the prior art taught all the elements and
suggested the combination of those elements in the Asserted Claims.
Contrary to Leighton’s representations to the USPTO, supra at 6, laminating plastic
cards, including those with embedded elements, at a pressure during cooling that was at least
10% greater than the pressure during heating, was common practice long before the filing date of
the earliest of the Patents. Smith ¶¶8-12. Indeed, Mr. Keith Leighton testified at his recent
deposition that he had laminated plastic cards in the 1980’s, or even earlier, with a pressure
during cooling that was 10% or more higher than the pressure during heating. For example, Mr.
Leighton testified:

7

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 12 of 28

Q I appreciate all of that, Mr. Leighton, but, unfortunately, I need
an answer to this question, and I am going to ask it again, so bear
with me, and let’s try once more. And, I’m going to try to read
back exactly what I asked, and maybe make it a little bit more
literate.
Is it fair to say, Mr. Leighton, that before 1990 you made a plastic
laminated card in which the pressure during the cooling was at
least ten percent greater than the pressure during the heating.
MR. GUTKIN:
Vague and ambiguous, Asked and answered.
Calls for speculation.
THE WITNESS: Well, in order to move, I – I’m going to say yes
to that question, but it does not pertain to making a radio frequency
card.
Sharinn Ex. 8. Indeed, the reason for increased pressure during cooling was to insure a smooth
surface on the laminated card, regardless of whether there was an embedded element present. In
other testimony Mr. Leighton conceded that he had used a higher pressure long before he filed
the applications for the Patents to insure that his laminated cards had a smooth surface:
Q:
It’s a slightly different question. I’m just trying to
understand, Mr. Leighton, what [your former employer during
1970-1981] did, and – and I’ve gotten a number of different
answers, and I’m just trying to pin down what the correct one is.
A: You keep asking if I ever increased pressure.
Q:

Yes.

A: Yes, I’ve – I have increased pressure to facilitate the product
that I was making.
Q: And the reason why you increased the pressure was to make a
smooth surface; is that correct?
A: A smooth surface, and to prevent warping of the product.
Q: And you increased the pressure to, I think you said before, to
insure there wouldn’t be voids?
A:

Correct.

Sharinn Ex. 9.
However, to simplify this motion and avoid the potential for the Court having to consider
what we believe will be bogus issues of material fact we do not rely on Mr. Leighton’s
8

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 13 of 28

admissions or a wealth of other available prior art. Rather, we rely on a “single” reference, the
1987 Oakwood Brochures, to show that Mr. Leighton’s purported invention was known for a
long time. Indeed, the Oakwood brochures, in addition to teaching the greater than 10%
limitation, teach all the elements of claim 20 of the ‘367 patent and claims 1, 6-7, and 14-16 of
the ‘155 patent.
2. The Oakwood Brochures
Oakwood Design (“Oakwood”) and its founding Director Richard Smith engineered a
series of lamination machines in 1984 known as the “Series 6 Laminators”. See Smith ¶10. In
addition to manufacturing and selling the Series 6 laminators, Oakwood used the Series 6
machine to laminate contactless security access cards as early as 1984. See Smith ¶21. From the
mid-1980’s through the late 1990’s Oakwood, at its location near London, England
manufactured presses to laminate plastic cards.
As is customary for machine manufacturers Oakwood published various manuals and
sales brochures detailing its products. Among these were two brochures that were meant to be
read together; these two publications are a 1987 Oakwood sales brochure entitled “Lamination
Presses for Bank Card & Printed Circuit Board Production (“1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure”)
(Smith Ex. B) and a 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Laminators Sales Brochure (“1987 Oakwood Series
6 Brochure”) (Smith Ex. D) (collectively referred to as the “1987 Oakwood Brochures”). The
1987 Oakwood Brochures were published at the latest in early 1988 and thereafter were widely
disseminated to the public.
The 1987 Oakwood Brochures not only promote Oakwood’s line of laminators, but also
describe typical lamination cycles and products that the laminators can make. Also discussing
lamination cycles and the structure of laminated cards is an instruction manual (Smith Ex. A)
that accompanied the sale of the Series 6 laminators, one of Oakwood’s products. The

9

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 14 of 28

instruction manual attached to Mr. Smith’s declaration was published in 1991, approximately 4
years before the effective filing date of the earliest of the Patents.
Rather than delve into the substance of these prior art publications here and duplicate text
that can be found elsewhere, we refer to the Smith and Mosteller declarations, which authenticate
and discuss these prior art publications, and our brief below, infra at 18. The 1987 Oakwood
Brochures teach, among other things, using a pressure during cooling that is at least 10% greater
than the pressure during heating. In fact, these brochures teach every element of claim 20 of the
‘367 patent and claims 1, 6-7, and 14-16 of the ‘155 patent.
C.

Level of Skill in the Art
For our present purposes, as demonstrated by the attached Declaration of Barry

Mosteller, persons who had ordinary skill in developing laminated plastic cards, including
determining card structure and lamination cycle parameters, had a college degree, preferably one
in material science, chemistry or mechanical engineering, and two years of practical experience
or alternatively had four years of practical experience in laminated plastic card development.
Mosteller ¶7.

II.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE MEANS FOR
DETERMINING WHETHER A PATENT CLAIM IS VALID
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the

moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Johnston v. IVAC Corp., 885 F.2d 1574,
1576-77 (Fed. Cir. 1989). The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of summary
judgment as a tool by which District Courts can dispose of non-triable issues:
Summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a
disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the
Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed ‘to secure the just,
speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.’

There is no dispute whether this Court is empowered to invalidate any or all of the
Patents’ claims by summary judgment. It is well accepted that the validity of a patent claim, like
any other issue, may be determined by summary judgment. Avia Group Int’l, Inc. v. L.A. Gear
Cal., Inc., 853 F.2d 1557, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Specifically, the Federal Circuit has
consistently upheld district courts’ summarily invalidating patent claims, pursuant to, inter alia,
35 U.S.C. § 102 as anticipated by the prior art. See, e.g., Tellmac Cellular Corp. v. Topp
Telecom, Inc., 247 F.3d 1316, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2001); General Elec. v. Nintendo Co., 179 F.3d
1350, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Constant v. Advanced Micro-Devices, Inc., 848 F.2d 1560, 1569
(Fed. Cir. 1988).
A.

The Presumption of Validity is Merely Procedural
The first step in an invalidity analysis is the determination of the meaning and scope of

the patent claims asserted. See Rockwell Int’l Court v. United States, 147 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed.
Cir. 1998); Markman v. Westview Instrs., Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 970-71, 976 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en
banc), aff’d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996). This Court, through its Markman decision, has completed the
first step of the subject analysis.
In general, patents are presumed to be valid under 35 U.S.C. § 282. However, this
statutory presumption is procedural rather than substantive. Fromson v. Advance Offset Plate,
Inc., 755 F.2d 1549, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1985). More precisely, this presumption merely places the
burden of persuasion initially on the party asserting invalidity.
A party, like Oberthur, seeking to prove invalidity must do so by clear and convincing
evidence (see Applied Medical Resources Corp. v. United States Surgical Corp., 147 F.3d 1374
1378 (Fed. Cir. 1998)), which need not be airtight, as the law only requires persuasion, not
perfection. Buildtex Inc. v. Kason Indus., Inc., 849 F.2d 1461, 1464 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Thus, the

USPTO’s decision that certain subject matter is patentable “is never binding on a court”.
Fromson, 755 F.2d at 1555.
B.

Anticipation and Obviousness
1. Anticipation (35 U.S.C. § 102)
The patent statute codifies “anticipation” in 35 U.S.C. § 102 . In pertinent part 35 U.S.C.

§§ 102 provides:
A person shall be entitled to a patent unless
*****
(a) the invention was … patented or described in a
printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the
invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or
(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed
publication in this or a foreign country … more than one year
prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States,
or
******
(e) the invention was described in … a patent granted on
an application for patent by another filed in the United States
before the invention by the applicant for patent . . . .
(Emphasis added). All of the prior art asserted by Oberthur in this brief qualifies as prior art
under one of these three sections of the patent statute.
Anticipation requires that a single prior art reference teach all of the limitations of a
claim. Three steps are used to determine if a patent is anticipated and therefore invalid.
Lindemann Maschinenfabrik v. American Hoist & Derrick Co., 730 F.2d 1452, 1458 (Fed. Cir.
1984).
First, the court must identify the limitations of a relevant claim. Second, it must properly
construe the limitations of the relevant claim in light of the specification and the prosecution
history of the patent. Id. And third, the court must determine, for purposes of finding invalidity

12

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 17 of 28

pursuant 35 U.S.C. §102 , whether each of the properly construed claim limitations are either
expressly or inherently found in a single prior art reference.
Notwithstanding, courts are cautioned that, while anticipation requires that a single prior
art reference teach all of the limitations of a claim, there need not be word-for-word identity
between the prior art reference and the claim limitations. Standard Havens Prods. v. Gencor
Indus., 953 F.2d 1360, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In fact, a prior art reference need not expressly
disclose all of the limitations of the claim, so long as those limitations are inherently disclosed--a
question of pure law. Id. Anticipation by inherency requires that one of ordinary skill in the
relevant art would have recognized that the missing descriptive matter is necessarily present in
the thing described in the reference. Continental Can Co. v. Monsanto, Inc., 948 F.2d 1264,
1268 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
Material that is not explicitly or inherently contained in a single prior art document may
still be considered for purposes of anticipation if that material is incorporated by reference into
the document. Advanced Display Sys., Inc. v. Kent State Univ., 212 F.3d 1272, 1282 (Fed. Cir.
2000). Furthermore, “A reference anticipates a claim if it discloses the claimed invention ‘such
that a skilled artisan could take its teachings in combination with his own knowledge of the
particular art and be in possession of the invention ....’ In re Graves, 69 F.3d 1147, 1152 (Fed.
Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1124 (1996), quoting In re Grice, 301 F. 2d 929, 936, 133
U.S.P.Q. 365, 372 (CCPA 1962) (emphasis in original).
2. Obviousness (35 U.S.C. § 103)
Non-obviousness is another fundamental requirement of patentability. Much like the test
for novelty, the test for obviousness looks to the prior art to determine whether an invention is
patentable. The test for obviousness, however, is not limited to a single prior art reference.

13

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 18 of 28

Instead, multiple prior art references can be combined to teach the limitations of a claim, thereby
rendering the claim invalid.
The Patent Act defines a claim as being obvious “if the difference between the subject
matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would
have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art
to which the subject matter pertains.” 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) sets forth the statutory obviousness criteria, and provides in relevant
part:
A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not
identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this
title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be
patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a
whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was
made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the
subject matter pertains.
The Supreme Court outlined three factual predicates that a court must consider in an
obviousness analysis. Graham v. John Deere¸ 383 U.S. 1 (1966). First, the scope and content of
the prior art must be determined. Graham, 383 U.S. at 17. Second, the differences between the
prior art and the asserted claims must be determined. Id. Third, the level of ordinary skill in the
pertinent art must be determined. Id. Although each of these predicates is a question of fact, the
ultimate finding of obviousness is a question of law. Advanced Display Sys., Inc., 212 F.3d at
1284. Accordingly, a dispute about the legal conclusion of obviousness will not preclude
granting summary judgment if there is no genuine dispute regarding the underlying factual
predicates. Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 763 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
When considering factual predicates of obviousness, there is a danger of applying
“hindsight” to find a claim to be obvious. See Minton v. Nat’l Ass’n Sec. Dealers, Inc., 226
F.Supp.2d 845 (E.D. Tex. 2002) (“Because a court has the benefit of seeing the elements already

14

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 19 of 28

combined in the patent claims when determining whether it would have been obvious to combine
the elements from the prior art references, an inherent temptation exists to ‘Monday-morning
quarterback’”). To avoid the improper use of hindsight, courts require a showing of some
motivation to combine the relevant prior art references to teach all of the limitations of the claimat-issue. See, e.g., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 229 F.3d 1120
(Fed. Cir. 2000). Thus, before a conclusion of obviousness is to be made based on combining
prior art references, a reason, suggestion, or motivation to lead an inventor to combine those
references must be established. See ACS Hospital Systems, Inc. v. Montefiore Hospital, 732 F.2d
1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984); see also Pro-Mold and Tool Co., Inc. v. Great Lakes Plastics, Inc.,
75 F.3d 1568, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
The suggestion may come expressly from the references themselves. See, e.g., In re
Sernaker, 702 F.2d 989, 994 (Fed. Cir. 1983). It may come from knowledge of those skilled in
the art that certain references, or disclosures in the references, are known to be of special interest
or importance in the particular field. Cf. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Delta Resins & Refractories, Inc.,
776 F.2d 281, 297 n. 24 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (stating that the knowledge of one skilled in the art may
provide the “teaching, suggestion, or inference” to combine references). Furthermore, the
suggestion also may come from the nature of a problem to be solved, leading inventors to look to
references relating to possible solutions to that problem. See, e.g., In re Rinehart, 531 F.2d 1048,
1054 (CCPA 1976) (considering the problem to be solved in a determination of obviousness).
The state of the art must be considered. In making an obviousness determination, the
teachings of the references, their relatedness to the field of the applicant’s endeavor, and the
knowledge of persons of ordinary skill in the field of the invention, are all relevant

15

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 20 of 28

considerations. See In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1992); In re Gorman, 933 F.2d
982, 986-87 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re Young, 927 F.2d 588, 591 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
Although obviousness is a factual issue and requires evaluation from the point of view of
the person of ordinary skill in the art, the court need not have expert testimony to render a
summary judgment of invalidity. “When the district court has before it all of the relevant prior
art, and its subject matter is easily discernible from the drawings and written descriptions, expert
testimony regarding the scope and content of the prior art is not necessary.” Ryko Manufacturing
Co. v. Nu-Star, 18 U.S.P.Q. 2D 1047, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18735 at 5 (D.MN 1990), aff’d,
950 F.2d 714 (Fed. Cir. 1991); see, Sandt Technology, Ltd. V. Resco Metal and Plastics Corp.,
264 F.3d 1344, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

III.
A.

THE PRIOR ART INVALIDATES THE ASSERTED CLAIMS
All the Asserted Claims of the ‘207, ‘155 and ‘099 Patents are Invalid
Leighton never claimed to have invented milling a card (recited in claim 1 of the ‘099

and ‘367 patents), applying an overlaminate film (recited in claim 1 of the ‘207 patent and ’155
patent) or printing (recited in claims 1 and 16 of the ‘207 patent and claim 1 of the ‘099 patent).
Rather, as described above in the prosecution history, Leighton’s first claim of novelty over the
prior art was that his process for hot laminating plastic cards eliminated “the need to specifically
protect the electronic element during lamination”. The Court in its Markman decision
summarized Leighton’s invention as follows:
Thus, as noted above, the essence of the Patents is the lack of any
‘non-electronic carrier.’
Sharinn Ex. 5 at 25.
Unfortunately for Leighton, during prosecution of the ‘367 patent, an Examiner other
than the one who had reviewed Leighton’s previous three patents found JP ‘214. That patent
expressly teaches laminating an unprotected chip and antenna. Leighton recognized that the

16

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 21 of 28

“non-electronic” carrier limitation no longer provided the defining characteristic over the prior
art. Accordingly, while prosecuting the ‘367 patent application Leighton adopted a new
strategy—the “greater than 10%” limitation.
Notably, none of the independent claims in Leighton’s three preceding patents, the ‘207
patent, the ‘155 patent and the ‘099 patent, include the “at least 10% greater” pressure limitation.
In adding this greater than 10% limitation to all the claims in the ‘367 patent, Leighton conceded
the lack of novelty of all independent claims in the other three Patents. That is, those claims’
only novelty laid in the “absence of a non-electronic carrier”, a feature that Leighton admitted
the newly cited JP ‘214 taught and that his claims were rendered unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. §
103 in view of the prior art.
For sake of brevity Oberthur does not provide a detailed narrative proving the invalidity
of all the Asserted Claims in the ‘207, ‘099 and ‘155 patents. However, the claim charts in
Appendix A apply the relevant prior art against those claims, element by element. Except for the
1987 Oakwood Brochures, which are used for teaching greater pressure during cooling with
respect to those dependant claims that recite that limitation, and except for the elements (e.g.,
printing, matte plates), which the Examiner felt were so clearly within the knowledge of those
skilled in the art that he did not cite any art, the prior art upon which the claim chart relies is that
which the Examiners of the respective Patents used. These features (printing, milling, etc.),
which are outside the claimed novelty of Leighton’s alleged invention, “had no effect on the
‘novelty and concept of the invention:’” the hot lamination cycle. Sandt Technology, Ltd. V.
Resco Metal and Plastics Corp., 264 F.3d 1344, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001), citing unreported
decision of J. McMahon.

Claim 20 of the ‘367 Patent is Invalid
Every limitation in claim 20 of the ‘367 patent is unequivocally taught in two interrelated

and widely distributed 1987 Oakwood Brochures. The 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure
incorporates by reference the contents of the 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure. These
documents, taken together, teach, among other things, using a pressure during cooling that is at
least 10% greater than the pressure during heating. Indeed, these brochures teach every element
of claim 20 of the ‘367 patent. Thus, claim 20 is invalid as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C.
§102(b).
The 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure describes
the Oakwood Series 6 laminator and illustrates an
exploded view of a card set for machine reading
applications that can be manufactured using that
laminator. Smith ¶24; Mosteller ¶9. The card set
illustration is duplicated on the right with added labels
for purposes of this motion. The card set as shown
comprises 5 plastic layers: a top transparent plastic layer;
a first opaque plastic layer having a cutout; a second
opaque plastic layer upon which an actual photograph sits; a third opaque plastic layer having an
inserted plastic substrate carrying inductive codings (coils); and a bottom opaque plastic layer.
Smith ¶¶24-25; Mosteller ¶¶9-14.
In order to create a flat surface across the card the first opaque plastic layer has a
thickness approximately the same as the thickness of the photograph and together effectively
form one layer when the card set is compressed. Smith ¶25; Mosteller ¶15. Similarly, in order
to minimize voids that the soft plastic must fill during the lamination process the third opaque

18

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 23 of 28

plastic layer surrounding the substrate has a thickness somewhere between the thickness of the
substrate and the substrate plus the thickness of the coils. Smith ¶25; Mosteller ¶15.
Accordingly, the top of the coils extend slightly above the top level of the third opaque plastic
layer surrounding the substrate. Smith ¶25; Mosteller ¶15. In sum, when assembled and
laminated the card is substantially flat across its surface. Smith ¶26; Mosteller ¶15.
The 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure teaches that the second to last layer includes, as
illustrated, inductive coils. Smith Ex. D at 4; Mosteller ¶16. It further teaches that these coils
become part of an electrical circuit that permits the coils to be machine readable:
By inserting specialist coding . . . into the core structure the
[Oakwood card] becomes a new tool . . . for many machine
reading applications . . . includ[ing] varying types of inductive
codings.
Mosteller ¶16 (emphasis added).
Moreover, that brochure even teaches that microchips can be laminated into the core:
“Oakwood technicians are skilled in the use of PVC . . . and have packaged the most
sophisticated micro chips within the core structure of a card.” Mosteller ¶13 (emphasis
added). Thus, a review of this brochure compels a finding that it discloses that “electronic
element[s]”, inductive coils or microchips, among others, can be embedded into the “core” of a
laminated plastic card.
As illustrated in the 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure, the inductive coils, or microchips,
(“electronic element[s]”) are between the second opaque plastic layer and the plastic substrate
(“first and second plastic core sheets”, i.e., “sheets of plastic between which the electronic
element is placed”). Accordingly, as required by claim 20 of the ‘367 patent, the card’s

19

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 24 of 28

inductive coils are in immediate physical contact with (“directly”2 between) and enclosed by
(“encapsulated by” 3) the second opaque plastic layer and plastic substrate when the card layers
shown in the illustration come together. As can also be seen the inductive codings are not
protected by any device from damage during lamination and therefore are “in the absence of a
non-electronic carrier”.4 Furthermore, a “core” is thereby formed by the second opaque plastic
layer, the inductive coils and the plastic substrate.
With reference to claim 20’s remaining elements, the 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure
teaches that the card set, including the “core”, is laminated by the Series 6 laminator using a heat
and pressure cycle. More precisely:
The card sets to be laminated are inserted . . . into the machine on the
laminating tray. . . . [h]eat and pressure are applied for the initial heating
cycle and varied as required during the hold and cooling period.
Smith Ex. D at 3.
As mentioned, in addition to publishing Oakwood’s Series 6 Brochure Oakwood
published a 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure. The 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure specifically
references the 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure: “an additional brochure is available for the
series 6 range”. Smith Ex. B at 8. It thus incorporates by reference the content of the 1987
Series 6 Brochure and ties the two brochures together as one.

holds an electronic element to protect it from physical damage during lamination, where the
device is not part of a circuit that utilizes a semiconductor device.” Sharinn Ex. 5 at 25.

Page 6 of the 1987 Oakwood Sales
Brochure depicts the details of a typical
lamination cycle of the Series 6 laminator
for both plastic (PVC) laminated cards and
printed circuit boards (PCB). Smith ¶19.
The parts of that Oakwood diagram
relevant to plastic laminated cards are
reproduced in the right margin. The
legend on the diagram teaches that the pressure and temperature diagram illustrates a “Typical
Lamination Cycle[]” for PVC. Smith Ex. B at 6. The pressure and temperature curves for PVC
are colored in the diagram for purposes of explaining how the respective curves describe and
illustrate the heating and pressure cycle recited in claim 20 of the ‘367 patent.
The diagram illustrates a heating cycle and a subsequent cooling cycle. Smith Ex. B at 6.
During the heating cycle of the card set, including the second opaque plastic layer, the inductive
coils and the substrate carrying the inductive coils (collectively the “core”), the card set is heated
for a “first period of time” (red line). See Sharinn Ex. 4, claim 20(c)(i). The diagram also
illustrates applying a “first pressure” for a “second period of time” (green line). See Sharinn Ex.
4, Claim 20(c)(ii). By applying this “first pressure” for a “second period of time” during the
heating of the “core”, the 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure shows that the inductive coils
(“electronic element”) are enclosed (“encapsulated") by the “core” when the second opaque
plastic layer and the plastic substrate shown beneath the inductive coils (“first and second plastic
core sheets”) are softened by the application of the heat and pressure. See Sharinn Ex. 4, Claim
20(c)(ii).

21

Case 1:04-cv-02496-CM

Document 77

Filed 10/18/2005

Page 26 of 28

During the cooling stage, the “core” is cooled (blue line) while applying a “second
pressure” (yellow line). See Sharinn Ex. 4, Claim 20(c)(iii). Claim 20 recites that the “second
pressure” is “at least 10% greater than the first pressure”. Id. The diagram in the 1987 Oakwood
Sales Brochure clearly illustrates the application of a much greater pressure during the cooling
than during the heating. Indeed, the diagram illustrates a pressure during the cooling (yellow
line) that is approximately twice as great as the pressure during the heating (green line). Smith
¶19.
Neither the Patent Examiner responsible for the ‘367 patent nor the Patent Examiners on
the three earlier Patents were aware of either of the Oakwood Brochures. Since each and every
limitation of claim 20 is described and illustrated in the 1987 Oakwood Brochures, claim 20 of
the ‘367 patent must be found invalid as anticipated under 35 U.S.C. §102(b). Indeed, for the
same reasons explained above, the 1987 Oakwood Brochures teach each and every element of
claims 1, 6-7, and 14-16 of the ‘155 patent.
Even if the Court determines that it must view the two 1987 Oakwood Brochures as
separate references, their combination is obvious pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §103. Not only is there
the reference in the 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure to the 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure, but
also the legend of the pressure/temperature diagram in the 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure, which
states “Typical Lamination Cycle[] … P.V.C. … Cycle Curves”, would motivate a person of
ordinary skill in the art to use the illustrated cycle to laminate PVC cards, including the PVC
card set illustrated in the 1987 Oakwood Series 6 Brochure. Accordingly claim 20 of the ‘367
patent is invalid as obvious in view of the prior art under 35 U.S.C. §103. Of course, this
reasoning applies equally to claims 1, 6-7, and 14-16 of the ‘155 patent.

All the Asserted Claims of the ‘367 Patent Are Invalid
Until Leighton added the greater than 10% limitation the Examiner of the ‘367 patent

application rejected all the claims of that application and did not permit that application to issue
as a patent. Since the claims prior to the addition of the greater than 10% limitation were not
patentable and since the greater than 10% limitation did not add patentability for the reasons
shown in the immediately preceding point, all the Asserted Claims of the ‘367 patent are invalid
in view of the prior art under either 35 U.S.C. § 102 or 35 U.S.C. § 103. We demonstrate this
claim by claim, element by element, in the claim charts of Appendix A.
To the extent that any further motivation need be shown to justify combining the
lamination cycle disclosed in the 1987 Oakwood Sales Brochure with the other prior art, among
other places it is found in the legend of the pressure/temperature diagram. That legend states
“Typical Lamination Cycle[] … P.V.C. … Cycle Curves” and would motivate a person of
ordinary skill in the art to use the illustrated cycle to laminate plastic (PVC) cards.
