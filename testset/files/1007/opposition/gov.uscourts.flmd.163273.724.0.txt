PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE INC.’S
AND ROCHE LABORATORIES INC’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
ON CAUSATION AND REQUEST TO DEFER RULING
The Plaintiffs' Steering Committee of MDL 1626 (hereinafter referred to as the
"Plaintiffs"), by and through the undersigned attorneys, hereby responds in opposition to
HLR, Inc.'s and Roche Laboratories, Inc.'s (hereinafter "Roche" or "Defendants") Motion
for Summary Judgment as to the following inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”) cases:

ARGUMENT

On August 11th, 2009 this Court excluded Dr. Fogel’s general causation testimony. In
summary, the Court found that Dr. Fogel was qualified and that his methodology was not
unorthodox; but was concerned that there was not currently sufficient scientific date to

Case 8:04-md-02523-JSM-TBM Document 724

Filed 09/04/09 Page 3 of 5

close the gap between hypothesis and opinion. The plaintiffs expect that gap to be closed
very shortly and respectfully request this Court to defer the ruling on this issue for the
following reasons:
1. The defendants still have not completely complied with the New Jersey Court’s
Order to turn over all relevant causation documents.
2. In addition to these five cases, the Accutane MDL has recently added a new case
that will ultimately be affected by this ruling.
3. The Defendants will suffer no prejudice or expense by the Court deferring a
Ruling since the discovery cutoffs have passed regarding these cases.

1. THE DEFENDANTS STILL OWE CAUSATION DISCOVERY TO THE
NEW JERSEY JUDGE.
In the above captioned matter, Defendants have pressed for the Daubert hearing on Dr.
Fogel and the subsequent Motion for Summary Judgment while they are simultaneously
appealing and delaying the New Jersey Court Order to produce additional documentation.
As set forth in Plaintiffs Motion to Compel, filed in this Court on March 17, 2009, it has
come to light that Defendants have failed to produce all discoverable documents and
information on the science of Accutane. Following a hearing in the New Jersey Mass
Tort on this issue on March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Court entered an order granting a
motion to compel all email correspondence of certain Roche drug safety officials as a
means for the court to investigate the integrity of document production in this case.
Plaintiffs reference the motion to compel filed in this Court rather than repeat herein the
details of the admitted production failures on the part of Roche. It is highly likely that the
New Jersey investigation will reveal additional evidence relevant to the issue of
causation. Plaintiffs and Dr. Fogel therefore seek the right to supplement the causation
case with any additional evidence produced through the New Jersey efforts.

Presently,

the Motion for Leave filed by Roche to file an Appeal to the New Jersey Appellate Court
has not been ruled on but an Opinion is expected in the near future. Defendants will not
suffer any prejudice by deferring this Court’s Ruling on the Motion for Summary
Judgment, conversely, Plaintiffs will be prejudiced by not being afforded the opportunity
to supplement Dr. Fogel’s report with this additional information.

2. THIS MDL ACCUTANE LITIGATION HAS RECENTLY ADDED NEW
CASE SPECIFICALLY NAMING HOFFMAN-LAROCHE, INC. AS A
DEFENDANT.
On June 17th, 2009 the following case was added to the MDL:
8:09-cv-01130-JSM-TBM Charles v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. et al.
This case specifically named Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc, as defendants (among others). As
this case has been added recently it is on a new discovery track and therefore has not
reached its deadline to declare a causation expert so therefore this later filed case will
have the benefit of forthcoming discovery from Roche and would be in a position to
survive a Motion for Summary judgment while the above captioned five plaintiffs would
be prejudiced by ruling before this information is available. Furthermore, there are other
remaining cases in this MDL that were not included in Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment that will also benefit from forthcoming discovery from Roche while the above
captioned five Plaintiffs will be prejudiced.
3. THE DISOCVERY CUTOFFS FOR FACT AND EXPERT WITNESSES
HAVE PASSED REGARDING THESE CASES.
The discovery cutoff for fact and expert witnesses has passed and therefore the
defendants will not be prejudiced or incur additional expenses or costs while the Court
defers the ruling. For example, the New Orleans cases (Baril, Palmer, and Perronne)
require no further investigation by the defendants. All of the Plaintiffs’ fact sheets have
been answered (and supplemented), all three plaintiffs have been deposed (twice), and the
defendants have conducted over 30 depositions (mostly of Physicians). These cases are
essentially ready for trial and waiting for the additional forthcoming evidence causes no
harm to the Defendants in this matter.
CONCLUSION
On Friday, June 26th, 2009 Hoffman-La Roche announced that they would be pulling
their drug Accutane off the market, worldwide, citing marketing considerations as the
explanation. The discovery ordered by the New Jersey Court may show otherwise. The
Courts legitimate concern about the sufficiency of the current scientific data to support

Case 8:04-md-02523-JSM-TBM Document 724

Filed 09/04/09 Page 5 of 5

causation opinions may be satisfied as a result of the forthcoming discovery that is
required of Roche. Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that Court delay ruling on
this matter until this information is available for this Courts consideration. This delay will
not prejudice the Defendants and a failure to delay the Ruling until after Defendants have
produced information they previously withheld will severely prejudice Plaintiffs.
