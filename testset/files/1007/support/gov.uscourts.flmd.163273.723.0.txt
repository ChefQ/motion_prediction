ARGUMENT

Pursuant to this Court’s September 22, 2008 scheduling order, [DE 14],
plaintiffs in these five cases designated Ronald Fogel as their sole general causation
expert. Following a Daubert hearing, the Court excluded Dr. Fogel’s general causation
testimony as methodologically unreliable on August 11, 2009. [DE 721]
This Court’s exclusion of Dr. Fogel’s testimony entitles Defendants to
summary judgment in these cases. In a pharmaceutical product liability action, the
plaintiff must prove both general and specific causation and must provide expert
testimony to satisfy this burden. Rutigliano v. Valley Bus. Forms, 929 F. Supp. 779, 783
(D.N.J. 1996) (Plaintiff “requires expert testimony to satisfy her burden with respect to
both general causation and specific causation.”); see also DeLuca v. Merrell Dow
Pharm., Inc., 911 F.2d 941, 958 (3d Cir. 1990), on remand, 791 F. Supp. 1042. (D.N.J.
1992), aff’d, 6 F.3d 778 (3d. Cir 1993); Lee v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 721 F. Supp. 89,
96 (D. Md. 1989), aff’d, 898 F.2d 146 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding that “expert testimony is
necessary since the cause of the injury claimed is a technical medical question beyond the
common knowledge of laypersons”). A defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the
plaintiffs’ expert causation evidence is found inadmissible under Daubert.
The Court previously applied this principle when it granted summary
judgment in the earlier IBD cases, after it first excluded Dr. Fogel in 2007. [DE 620] As
the Court stated at that time: “Without expert testimony that Accutane can cause IBD,
Plaintiffs are unable to prove liability in all cases in which Dr. Fogel has been designated

as the expert on this issue.” Id. at 1. The same result should occur here, with Dr. Fogel
having again been excluded in these five cases.
CONCLUSION
For the above-stated reasons, Defendants respectfully seek summary
judgment in the above-identified cases based on Plaintiffs’ inability to establish general
causation.
Respectfully submitted,
