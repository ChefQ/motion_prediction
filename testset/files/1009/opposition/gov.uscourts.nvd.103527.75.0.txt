Plaintiffs are barred from litigating in Ohio under the parties' "Loan Commitment Term

2

Sheet," which provides: ""the parties acknowledge and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of

3

any competent court in Reno, Nevada ... [for] all matters arising out of or related [to] ... [tJhis

4, Term Sheet and the Loan Documents." (Am. Compl. Ex. A-2, ECF# 11-2 (emphasis added).)
5

The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that "a forum-selection clause"—like this

6

one—must `be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases." Atlantic Marine

7

Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States Dist. Court for Western Dist. of Texas, -- U.S. ---, 134 S.Ct.

~~ 568, 579 (2013) (quotations omitted). "When parties agree to aforum-selection clause, they
0 waive the right to challenge the preselected forum as inconvenient or less convenient for
10

themselves or their witnesses, or for their pursuit of the litigation." Id. at 582. Thus, `forumselection clauses should control except in unusual cases." Id.
Thus, while remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction to the Court from which the
case was removed may ordinarily be appropriate, the Plaintiffs here have waived their right to
litigate this dispute in Ohio state court. Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiffs' motion to
remand to Lorain County, Ohio.
DATED thisa~~ day of March, 2015.
