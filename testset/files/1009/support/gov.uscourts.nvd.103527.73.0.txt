Plaintiffs filed this action in the Lorain County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas on

On February 18, 2015, Praetorium and Cresson filed a Notice of Lack of Diversity

Jurisdiction. (ECF No. 72). The Notice complies with this Court's January 21, 2015 Order by

A motion to remand the case on the basis on any defect other than
lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days
after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at
any time before final judgment it appears that the district court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An
order remanding the case may require payment ofjust costs and any
actual expenses including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the
removal. A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed
by the clerk to the clerk of the state court. The state court may
there upon proceed with such case.
