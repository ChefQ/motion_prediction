DEFENDANT KAPLAN’S COUNSEL’S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ERROR IN
CONNECTION WITH D.E. 739, MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO D.E. 737
The undersigned apologizes to the Court for the error she made in D.E. 739, when she
stated that no party had cited to expert testimony in summary judgment motions. Plaintiff’s
counsel is quite correct that Mr. Abbott did do so in a reply memorandum at D.E. 671. The
undersigned had forgotten – as no one filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiff’s motion to strike
Mr. Abbott’s reply. Notably Plaintiff does not advise the Court that Plaintiff moved to strike Mr.
Abbott’s reply because it cited to the expert’s opinions and was beyond the scope of the original
motion. D.E. 702. Mr. Abbott did not oppose the motion to strike the document referring to the
expert. No response was filed to D.E. 702. Therefore, it was assumed that the motion will be
granted.
In its motion to strike, Plaintiff argued:
Local Rule 7.1(c) mandates that “reply memorandum shall be strictly limited to
rebuttal of matters raised in the memorandum in opposition without reargument of
matters covered in the movant’s initial memorandum of law.” Pursuant to the plain
language of Local Rule 7.1(c), new arguments may not be raised in reply brief.
(citations omitted)
Plaintiff also argued that Abbott’s arguments were “egregiously improper,” because they had not
been raised in the original motion:
Arguments implicating the opinions and findings of defendants’ experts, especially
those of Hans Mueller—an expert withdrawn by defendants due to a conflict of

interest—were never put forth in Kaplan and Silverman’s summary judgment filings
[D.E. 592, 593, and 594] nor were they addressed in Plaintiff’s Response [D.E. 634].
The undersigned apologizes for the error, and asks that the Court consider Plaintiff’s
arguments in D.E. 702 when it noted that it could not respond without moving for leave to do so:
Abbott’s insertion of such arguments is highly prejudicial to Plaintiff, as Plaintiff is
unable to respond without the Court’s leave. Moreover, because Abbott had the
opportunity to file his own motion for summary judgment but chose not to do so, he
should now not be permitted to contravene the requirements of Local Rule 7.1(c) on
account of some perceived deficiency in Kaplan and Silverman’s summary judgment
motion.
Plaintiff chose to move to strike rather than respond with expert testimony. No party filed an
opposition to the motion to strike Abbott’s reply memo, and so D.E. 702 should be granted and D.E.
737 should be denied. Clearly Plaintiff thought about the potential for expert response and decided
against it. It should be bound by the choice made in D.E. 702.
