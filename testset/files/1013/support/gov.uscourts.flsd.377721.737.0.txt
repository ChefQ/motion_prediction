UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO.: 11-CV-80416-RYSKAMP
CORDELL CONSULTANTS, INC.
MONEY PURCHASE PLAN AND
TRUST, a Virginia corporation,
Plaintiff,
vs.
ELIOT C. ABBOTT, et al.,
Defendants.
________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL
SUMMARY JUDGMENT MATERIAL BASED ON EXPERT TESTIMONY
Plaintiff, Cordell Consultants, Inc. Money Purchase Plan and Trust (“Plaintiff”), hereby
moves the Court to permit Plaintiff to supplement its summary judgment filings based on
testimony from Defendants’ expert, Terry Spurlock (“Spurlock”), and Plaintiff’s rebuttal expert,
Mark Kesselman, (“Kesselman”). In support, Plaintiff states:
1.

Defendants’ expert witnesses Spurlock testified about a material and contested

issue in this case, the plain falsity of Ed Okun’s (“Okun”) personal financial statement (“PFS”)
based upon Okun’s failure to disclose the actual nature of his liabilities.1
2.

Plaintiffs’ expert Kesselman has testified to the reasonableness of the due diligence

performed by Plaintiff prior to making the $7 Million loan. Kesselman contradicts the claims of

1

The Okun PFS used to obtain the $7 Million loan from plaintiff lists $134 Million in liability to
1031 Tax Group, LLC for “Notes and Accounts Payable”. In actual fact, Okun had stolen the
money, not borrowed it. He stole the money from seven different QI companies, such as 1031
Advance, Inc.---not from 1031 Tax Group, LLC. According to records actually reviewed by the
defendant lawyers, as of December, 2006, Okun actually had taken more than $150 Million.
According to a March, 2007 e-mail from Janet Dashiell, President of the 1031 Tax Group, Inc.,
Okun had taken more than $162 Million. That e-mail was actually received and reviewed by
defendants Kaplan and Abbott.

Spurlock regarding purported red flags and badges of fraud.
3.

The Court directed that both parties to this lawsuit may petition to file supplemental

summary judgment material as to Kesselman’s testimony. Given the timeline of events, Plaintiff
also seeks leave to supplement its filings with Spurlock’s testimony. Since Plaintiff did not depose
Spurlock until after its summary judgment filings, the Court should allow Plaintiff to introduce
this newly obtained testimony. Plaintiff deposed Spurlock on August 10, 2015. See D.E. 659.
Nearly a week earlier, Plaintiff filed its final responses in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Judgment. See D.E. 649.2
4.

At his deposition, Spurlock testified to the following:
(i)

Okun’s PFS included a box for “Other Contingent
Liabilities” and he was required to list all liabilities here
(Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 39: ln. 5-18; p. 40: ln. 9-21);

(ii)

If Okun were liable for fines or penalties, Spurlock would
not expect these liabilities to be included under “Notes and
Accounts Payable” but would expect them to be listed
“elsewhere” on the PFS (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 54: ln. 1023);

(iii)

Okun’s PFS indicates that he is not the “borrower” of the
Qualified Intermediary (“QI”) money but is simply a
guarantor (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 55: ln. 5-11). If Okun were
a personal guarantor, this fact would have to be established
in writing or “it didn’t happen” (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 56:
ln. 20-25);

(iv)

If Okun was in default on the payment of his QI “notes,” that
would “absolutely” be a material fact in the bank’s decision
to extend or not extend credit (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 57: ln.
2-10);3

(v)

A borrower’s PFS could be a closing document if—while “at
the closing table”—a borrower is “asked to certify that there

This Motion was filed before the Clerk’s business day began on August 4, 2015.
It is undisputed that Okun had defaulted in the repayment of most of the $150 Million in
indebtedness to the QI’s by December of 2006.

is no change in his financial statement” (Spurlock Depo. Tr.,
p. 65: ln. 11-19);4

5.

(vi)

If Spurlock learned that an asset listed on a borrower’s PFS
was acquired with stolen money, he would not lend to that
borrower (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 66: ln. 15-21);

(vii)

If a borrower were unable to convince its attorney to supply
a written opinion letter, Spurlock would not lend to that
borrower unless “very strong reasons” were given for this
failure (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 70: ln. 1-4);

(i)

A borrower is “required to disclose all liabilities, direct and
contingent” (Spurlock Depo. Tr., p. 85: ln. 4-6);

(ii)

If a borrower is unable to determine its true level of debt—
having produced various statements that contradict one
another—this would be a “huge red flag” (Spurlock Depo.
Tr., p. 85: ln. 7-13);

Spurlock’s testimony about the falsity of Okun’s PFS goes to the very heart of

Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment [D.E. 592], which Plaintiff opposes. Defendants
make the argument that Okun’s financial statement was not fraudulent. Spurlock’s testimony, not
available at the time of plaintiff’s response to the summary judgment motion, makes it clear that
the Okun PFS was fraudulent.
6.

Kesselman’s testimony is also material to Defendants’ affirmative defenses of in

pari delicto, unclean hands, and intervening cause, which Plaintiff has sought to exclude on
summary judgment. See D.E. 189; D.E. 603. Plaintiff contends that Defendants were aware of
falsities in Okun’s financial statement that Plaintiff was unaware of. Kesselman establishes that
the Okun PFS does not reveal that Okun is ‘borrowing’ from any Q.I. company, but has instead
become indebted to a holding company called 1031 Tax Group, LLC and that there is no per se
prohibition against a Q.I. investing funds it holds.

4

Plaintiff testified that the attorney for Okun from the defendant law firm represented to Plaintiff
that there had been no adverse material change in Okun’s financial condition.
3

7.

Kesselman rebuts defendant’s contentions regarding Okun’s purported defaults in

the payment of other loans from Plaintiff. He establishes why there either was no default or why
Okun’s late payments on other loans were immaterial. Kesselman establishes that lenders do not
investigate the legality of the borrower’s business transactions and that Plaintiff’s due diligence in
making the subject loan was appropriate in the circumstances.
8.

Plaintiff did not have the benefit of either Spurlock or Kesselman’s relevant and

material testimony before its summary judgment filings. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests
that the Court grant Plaintiff leave to file a single supplemental motion in support of its Motion for
Partial Summary Judgment and in opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.
9.

Plaintiff request leave to file the deposition testimony of both Spurlock and

Kesselman together with a brief analysis of their testimony and its significance to summary
judgment issues.
