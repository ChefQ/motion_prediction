MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
Defendants City of New York, Devon Freed, Joseph Seminara, Robert Henderson,
and Robert Ortlieb, by their attorney, Zachary W. Carter, Corporation Counsel of the City of New
York, respectfully submit this memorandum of law in support of their motion for summary
judgment pursuant to Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Shane Rhooms brings this action alleging various violations of his federal and state
constitutional rights. Plaintiff alleges federal claims under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 for false arrest and
false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, denial of right to a fair trial due to fabrication of
evidence, and failure to intervene, and related state law claims for false arrest, battery, malicious
prosecution, and respondeat superior against the City of New York. (See 56.1 ¶ 1) Defendants now
move for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 on all of Plaintiff’s claims.

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 13 of 36 PageID #: 1101

Defendants are entitled to summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) The
undisputed facts show that there was probable cause to arrest Plaintiff; (2) there was also probable
cause to initiate and sustain the prosecution of plaintiff due to the presumption of probable cause
created by the grand jury indictment; (3) defendants should be granted qualified immunity with
respect to plaintiff’s claims; (4) plaintiff fails to state a claim for denial of right to a fair trial; (5)
plaintiff fails to state a claim for failure to intervene; (6) plaintiff’s state law claims fail as a matter
of law, and the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, and (7) John Doe 1
should be dismissed as a defendant.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
For a complete statement of the relevant and undisputed facts, the Court is
respectfully referred to Defendants’ Statement Pursuant to Rule 56.1, dated November 3, 2015,
(“56.1”) submitted concurrently herewith.
Plaintiff was arrested on September 6, 2010, in connection with a shooting at NYPD
Lieutenant Robert Ortlieb, Lieutenant Robert Henderson, and Sergeant Joseph Seminara, at about
12:40 a.m., at 222 Lenox Road, Brooklyn, NY. (See 56.1 ¶ 43.) For a summary of the shooting
incident leading to Plaintiff’s arrest See 56.1 ¶¶ 3-15. After the shooting an investigation quickly
commenced.

(See 56.1 ¶¶ 12, 13, 14.)

investigator.

(See 56.1 ¶ 2.)

1st Grade Det. Devon Freed was assigned as lead

Det. Freed, and many other NYPD investigators, started an

investigation into the identity of the shooter, which included, but was not limited to, speaking to 911
callers, canvasing the building of 222 Lenox for witnesses or suspects, canvasing the surrounding
locations for vehicle information, speaking to witnesses who heard shots or were in the vicinity of
the shooting incident, and conducting computer checks. (See 56.1 ¶ 14.) The investigation led to
the name Shane, provided by a resident of 222 Lenox, named Jason Brown. (See 56.1 ¶¶ 24, 25,
29.) The name Shane led the investigators to conduct computer checks, which informed them that

2

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 14 of 36 PageID #: 1102

a Shane Rhooms had been arrested on July 3, 2010, at 210 Lenox Road, near the location of the
shooting. (See 56.1 ¶ 26.) Jason Brown confirmed that a photograph of Shane Rhooms was the
individual he knew to be Shane. (See 56.1 ¶ 29.) The Plaintiff’s photograph was put into a photo
array, and Sergeant Seminara positively identified the Plaintiff as the individual who had shot at
himself, Lt. Ortlieb, and Lt. Henderson. (See 56.1 ¶ 39, 40.)
For the purpose of this motion only, taking the evidence in the light most favorable
to the non-moving party Plaintiff, Defendants will adopt as true the allegations that non-party
witness Trevor Perez was coerced into signing a written statement, on a photograph of the Plaintiff,
saying he saw Plaintiff running from the cops with a gun, because, according to him, the officers
told him they already knew that plaintiff was involved. (See 56.1 ¶¶ 30-37.) According to Mr.
Perez, this was not true, and he told the detectives that it was not true. (See 56.1 ¶ 31.) Mr. Perez
knew the Plaintiff. (See 56.1 ¶ 33, 34.) He had known the Plaintiff as someone who came to the
building, 222 Lenox, for many years. (See 56.1 ¶ 34.) Mr. Perez had seen plaintiff earlier in the
day before the shooting near Lenox. (See 56.1 ¶ 35.)
After the Plaintiff was identified as the shooter a wanted poster was prepared, and
apprehension efforts began. (See 56.1 ¶ 41.) Plaintiff’s mother called him to inform him that the
police were looking for him. (See 56.1 ¶ 46.) Even though Plaintiff knew the police were looking
for him, he did not surrender himself to the precinct until 6:00 p.m. on September 6, 2010. (See
56.1 ¶ 42.) After Plaintiff arrived at the precinct he was read his Miranda Warnings, and provided
an oral and written statement, giving an alibi, stating that he was at Webster Hall in Manhattan with
his cousin, and friends, at the time of the shooting. (See 56.1 ¶ 44, 45.) Plaintiff was subsequently
arrested. (See 56.1 ¶ 43.)
On September 7, 2010, the Plaintiff was positively identified in three separate
lineups by Lt. Henderson, Lt. Ortlieb, and Sgt. Seminara. (See 56.1 ¶ 47.) Plaintiff was asked what

3

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 15 of 36 PageID #: 1103

position he wanted in the linup and he said he wanted number 3. (See 56.1 ¶ 48.) On September 7,
2010, a criminal court complaint was signed by a paralegal with the DA’s office, based upon
information provided by complainant Robert Ortlieb. (See 56.1 ¶ 49.) After the lineups Plaintiff
was arraigned, and held on Rikers Island, until he was released on his own recognizance on
September 24, 2010. (See 56.1 ¶ 57.) During that time, a Grand Jury was convened, at which Det.
Freed testified on September 8, 2010, and Sgt. Seminara, and Lt. Henderson testified on September
10, 2010. (See 56.1 ¶ 50-53.) Plaintiff was Indicted on September 10, 2010 for twenty counts,
including three top counts of attempted murder in the first degree, C.P.L. § 110/125.27. (See 56.1 ¶
50.) Following Plaintiff’s Indictment, Det. Freed, in conjunction with the Kings County District
Attorney’s Office, obtained surveillance video from Webster Hall. (See 56.1 ¶ 54-56.) A meeting
was held with Det. Freed, ADA Lewis Lieberman, the Plaintiff’s cousin, and the Plaintiff’s defense
attorney, Sam Gregory, to view the video. (See 56.1 ¶ 55.) Shortly after this meeting the Plaintiff
was released from Rikers. (See 56.1 ¶ 57.) The charges were ultimately dismissed against Plaintiff
on December 21, 2010. (See 56.1 ¶ 58.)
STANDARD OF REVIEW
A court must grant a motion for summary judgment when “the movant shows that
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56 (a). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the
light most favorable to the non-movant, presents no genuine issue of material fact. Id.; Cifarelli v.
Village of Babylon, 93 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir. 1996). A material fact is one that might affect the
outcome of a suit under governing law. Kinsella v. Rumsfeld, 320 F.3d 309, 311 (2d Cir. 2003).
“Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving
party, there is no ‘genuine issue for trial.’” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475
U.S. 574, 587 (1986).

4

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 16 of 36 PageID #: 1104

In a motion for summary judgment, the moving party can show that no genuine issue
of material fact exists by “setting forth specific facts denying [plaintiff’s] claims.” Jermosen v.
Coughlin, 877 F. Supp. 864, 867 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 1995) (citing Williams v. Smith, 781 F.2d 319,
323 (2d Cir. 1986)). The moving party may also prevail “by pointing out that there is an absence of
evidence to support the non-moving party’s case.” Jermosen, 877 F. Supp. at 867 (quoting Gabai v.
Jacoby, 800 F. Supp. 1149, 1153 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 1992)). In order to avoid summary judgment,
the non-moving party must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine
issue of fact for trial. Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal
citations omitted).

Evidence which is merely “colorable, conclusory, speculative or not

significantly probative” is insufficient to withstand a summary judgment motion. Gabai, 800 F.
Supp. at 1153 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 1992). Similarly, “[t]he nonmoving party cannot defeat summary
judgment by ‘simply showing that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts’. . . or
by a factual argument based on ‘conjecture or surmise.’” McClellan v. Smith, 439 F.3d 137, 144
(2d Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted).
In this case, summary judgment is warranted because plaintiff cannot show that there
are genuine issues for trial. Defendants therefore respectfully request that summary judgment be
granted in their favor.
ARGUMENT
POINT I
THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST
PLAINTIFF
Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s state and federal claims
for false arrest and false imprisonment because plaintiff’s arrest was supported by probable cause.
The elements of a claim of false arrest under § 1983 “are substantially the same as the elements of a
false arrest claim under New York law.” Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.
5

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 17 of 36 PageID #: 1105

1995). Under New York law, the elements of a false arrest claim are, and the plaintiff must prove
that: “(1) the defendant intended to confine the plaintiff, (2) the plaintiff was conscious of the
confinement, (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement, and (4) the confinement was not
otherwise privileged.” Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting
Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1994)); Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d
110, 118 (2d Cir. 1995).
“The existence of probable cause to arrest constitutes justification and ‘is a complete
defense to an action for false arrest.’” Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting
Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1994)). The existence of probable cause defeats
a claim for false arrest even if any arrestee is ultimately revealed to be innocent. Pierson v. Ray,
386 U.S. 547, 555 (1967). The police have probable cause to arrest if they receive “information
from some person, normally the putative victim or eyewitness.” Panetta v. Crowley, 460 F.3d 388,
395 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Martinez v. Simonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634 (2d Cir. 2000)); McLaurin v.
New Rochelle Police Officers, 379 F. Supp. 2d 475, 477-78 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). “Indeed, as sources
of information go, crime victims are among the most reliable; they usually can provide a first-hand
non-hearsay account of the criminal activity.” Campbell v. Giuliani, No. 99-CV-2603 (JG), 2001
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 609, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2001). “Once officers possess facts sufficient to
establish probable cause, they are neither required nor allowed to sit as prosecutor, judge or jury.
Their function is to apprehend those suspected of wrongdoing, and not to finally determine guilt
through a weighing of the evidence.” Panetta v. Crowley, 460 F.3d 388, 396 (2d Cir. 2006).
Further, an arrest doesn’t need to be supported by information that “excludes all possibility of
innocence and points to the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt…As the very name
suggests, probable cause depends upon probabilities, not certainty.” Nolasco v. City of New York,
131 A.D.3d 683, 685 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep’t 2015.)

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 18 of 36 PageID #: 1106

The instant matter is an archetypal complaining victim case – three on duty police
officers were shot at. Sgt. Seminara identified the plaintiff in a photo array, and Seminara, Ortlieb,
and Henderson identified plaintiff in three separate lineups.

Those identifications provided

sufficient probable cause to arrest plaintiff, despite the fact that plaintiff provided an alibi. “A
positive photo identification by an eyewitness is normally sufficient to establish probable cause to
arrest.” Celestin v. City of New York, 581 F. Supp. 2d 420, 431 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); Franks v. City of
New York, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66004, 7-8 (E.D.N.Y. May 20, 2015); Daughtry v. City of New
York, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68627, 8-9 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2015). This is true even when the
identification may not be 100% reliable. See Norwood v. Mason, 524 Fed. Appx. 762, 765 (2d Cir.
2013); People v. Radcliffe, 23 A.D.3d 301, 808 N.Y.S.2d 22, 23 (1st Dep’t 2005) (holding that
photo identification established probable cause for defendant’s arrest, despite challenge to reliability
of identification); see Moore v. City of New York, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31994 (E.D.N.Y. Mar.
16, 2015) (finding sufficient probable cause from a photo array identification where the witness
recognized the eyes.)
Further, a mistake or misidentification of Plaintiff as the shooter does not undermine
probable cause. See Colon v. City of New York, 60 N.Y.2d 78, 82, 455 N.E.2d 1248, 468 N.Y.S.2d
453 (N.Y. 1983). When assessing probable cause, officers are entitled to reasonably rely on
identifications which later turn out to be mistaken. See Manganiello v. City of New York, 612 F.3d
149, 161 (2d Cir. 2010); Hewitt v. City of New York, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141067, 13-14
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2012), aff’d, 544 F. App’x 24 (2d Cir. 2013) (“misidentification do not
undermine probable cause.”)

Plaintiff cannot show that simply by having an alibi, that the

identifications by Seminara, Ortlieb, and Henderson were anything other than mistaken
identifications, which does not undermine probable cause. See Williams v. City of New York, No.
07-CV-5362 (NG) (VVP) (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2012) (“All that plaintiff does is assume the officers

7

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 19 of 36 PageID #: 1107

lied because he states that he did not deal in drugs. This bare assumption is insufficient to withstand
a motion for summary judgment.”) Additionally, gaps in the continuity of observation does not
render identifications unreasonable, or undermine the probable cause to arrest. See Franks v. City
of New York, et al., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104640, *9-10 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2015).
To the extent Plaintiff argues that there was not probable cause to arrest Plaintiff
because he provided an alibi that was compelling and readily verifiable (See Compl, Exh. A, ¶ 49)
such claim is without merit. Failure to review or obtain surveillance video, that an individual
claims exonerates them, does not vitiate probable cause, and officers have no obligation to do so.
See Wieder v. City of New York, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60890 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2013);
Moorehead v. City of New York, 11-CV-3294 (SLT)(SMG) (Dkt. 52) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2013).
The law imposes no duty to investigate potentially exculpatory stories, such as investigating alibi
witnesses, viewing security footage, or corroborating receipts or cell phone records. See Daughtry
v. City of New York, et al., 12-CV-2655 (NGG) (RER) (Dkt. 48) (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2015);
Alvarado v. City of New York, 453 Fed. App’x 56, 58 (2d Cir. 2011) (finding that, once probable
cause was established, detective had no obligation to refrain from making the arrest, nor investigate
a potentially exculpatory story).
Finally, to the extent Plaintiff argues in his complaint that the identification
procedures were “sham” procedures, Courts have held that suggestive identifications alone are not
constitutional violations, rather it is the individual’s right to a fair trial that is “impaired by the
admission of testimony regarding the unreliable identification.” Wray v. City of New York, 490
F.3d 189, 193 (2d Cir. 2007). Not only has Plaintiff failed to specify how the identification
procedures were shams or suggestive, but even if he had pled such facts, the claim would fail.
Whereas here, Detective Freed relied upon the identification of Plaintiff in a photo
array, and three subsequent positive identifications in lineups, Detective Freed had probable cause

8

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 20 of 36 PageID #: 1108

to arrest the Plaintiff, and the false arrest claims against him should be dismissed. In addition,
defendants Seminara, Ortlieb, and Henderson, had zero involvement. They were, unfortunately, the
victims of serious crime. They acted like, and were treated like, victims. They only identified the
plaintiff. They did not make the determination to arrest him. Therefore, the claims for false arrest
should be dismissed for lack of personal involvement.
It is well established that personal involvement in an alleged constitutional
deprivation must be alleged for § 1983 liability to lie against an individual defendant. Farid v.
Ellen, 593 F.3d 233, 249 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Farrell v. Burke, 449 F.3d 470, 484 (2d Cir. 2006));
Alfaro Motors, Inc. v. Ward, 814 F.2d 883, 886 (failure to plead the personal involvement of a
government official renders a complaint “fatally defective on its face”). It is well established that
Section 1983 imposes liability only upon a defendant who personally subjects, or causes to be
subjected any person to the deprivation of any federal right. Accordingly, “personal involvement of
defendants in alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under §
1983.” Williams v. Smith, 781 F.2d 319, 323 (2d Cir. 1986) (citation omitted); Doyle v. Coombe,
No. 97-2680, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 20261, at *3 (2d Cir. June 12, 1998); Sealey v. Giltner, 116
F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir. 1997).
To prevail on a § 1983 false arrest claim against a particular defendant, plaintiff must
demonstrate that the defendant was personally involved in the alleged constitutional deprivations.
Farid, 593 F.3d at 249 (“It is well settled in this Circuit that personal involvement of defendants in
alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under § 1983.”)
(quoting Farrell v. Burke, 449 F.3d 470, 484 (2d Cir. 2006)); Williams v. Young, 769 F. Supp. 2d
594, 602-03 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (noting that the plaintiff did not have a false arrest claim because the
defendant was not alleged to have participated in the plaintiff’s arrest). The Second Circuit has
defined “personal involvement” to mean direct participation, such as “personal participation by one

9

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 21 of 36 PageID #: 1109

who has knowledge of the facts that rendered the conduct illegal,” or indirect participation, such as
“ordering or helping others to do the unlawful acts.” Provost v. City of Newburgh, 262 F.3d 146,
155 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Gaston v. Coughlin, 249 F.3d 156, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2001). Plaintiff has
established no facts to show that Seminara, Henderson, or Ortlieb were personally involved in his
arrest or prosecution, aside from being the victim of crime, or that, if there was a constitutional
violation, that they were personally responsible. Accordingly, there can be no personal liability on
the part of Seminara, Henderson, or Ortlieb, and the claims against them should be dismissed.
Based on the foregoing, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s
false arrest claims.
POINT II
DEFENDANTS
SHOULD
BE
GRANTED
SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFF’S
FEDERAL
AND
STATE
MALICIOUS
PROSECUTION CLAIMS
Defendants should be granted summary judgment on plaintiff’s claims for malicious
prosecution. To establish a claim of malicious prosecution under federal or state law, a plaintiff
must establish that: “(1) the defendant either commenced or continued a criminal proceeding against
him; (2) that the proceeding terminated in his favor; (3) that there was no probable cause for the
criminal proceeding; and (4) that the criminal proceeding was instituted with actual malice.” Posr
v. Doherty, 944 F.2d 91, 100 (2d Cir. 1991) (citations omitted). For claims arising under 42 U.S.C.
§1983, a plaintiff must also establish a deprivation of liberty consistent with the concept of seizure.
Cunningham v. City of New York, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69801, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 18. 2007)
(citing Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 116 (2d. Cir. 1995)). A plaintiff must satisfy
all elements of this claim in order to survive a motion for summary judgment. However, plaintiff
has not proffered the requisite evidence to establish his malicious prosecution claims.

10

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 22 of 36 PageID #: 1110

A.

Defendant Freed Did Not Initiate or Continue a Criminal Proceeding Against
Plaintiff.

Plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claims against Freed fail because defendant Freed
did not initiate or continue plaintiff’s underlying criminal prosecution. It is undisputed that the
criminal prosecution against the Plaintiff began once he was positively identified by the victims,
Joseph Seminara, Robert Ortlieb, and Robert Henderson. The Second Circuit has held that initiation in
the context of a malicious prosecution claim is “a term of art” involving more than merely reporting a
crime and giving testimony. Rohman v. New York City Transit Auth., 215 F.3d 208, 217 (2d Cir. 2000).
To prevail, the plaintiff must show that the defendant “played an active role in the prosecution, such as
giving advice and encouragement or importuning the authorities to act.” Manganiello v. City of New
York, 612 F.3d 149, 163 (2d Cir. N.Y. 2010) (citing to Rohman, 215 F.3d at 217). Indeed, when the
police are accused of misconduct, “a malicious-prosecution claim cannot stand if the decision made
by the prosecutor to bring criminal charges was independent of any pressure exerted by [the]
police.” Alcantara v. City of New York, 646 F. Supp. 2d 449, 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing cases);
Smith v. City of New York, 04 Civ. 3286 (TPG), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88774 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27,
2010).
“New York law imposes a presumption that a prosecutor exercises his own
independent judgment in deciding to prosecute a criminal defendant.” Guzman v. United States,
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131684, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2013) (citation omitted). “[A] maliciousprosecution claim cannot stand if the decision made by the prosecutor to bring criminal charges was
independent of any pressure exerted by [the] police.” Alcantara, 646 F. Supp. 2d at 457 (citations
omitted). Further, “once a criminal defendant has been formally charged, the chain of causation
between the officer’s conduct and the claim of malicious prosecution is broken by the intervening
actions of the prosecutor, thereby abolishing the officer’s responsibility for the prosecution.” Smith

11

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 23 of 36 PageID #: 1111

v. City of New York, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88774, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2010) (citing
Alcantara, 646 F. Supp. 2d at 459).
Plaintiff has not proffered any evidence to overcome the presumption that the
Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, and Assistant District Attorney Lewis Lieberman, exercised
independent judgment in deciding to prosecute him. Even if ADA Lieberman had known about the
alleged coercion, he still would have proceeded based on the lineup identifications. (See 56.1 ¶¶
59-62.) Further, there is no evidence that defendant Freed played any significant role in the
initiation and continuation of the prosecution of plaintiff’s criminal case, other than investigating
plaintiff’s alibi. As such, plaintiff has failed to show not only that defendant Freed commenced or
continued his criminal prosecution, but also that there was actual malice on the part of any of the
defendants in the institution of his criminal proceeding. As such, plaintiff cannot satisfy the
initiation or actual malice elements of his malicious prosecution claim.
B.

There was Probable Cause for the Criminal Prosecution Against Plaintiff.

Plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim fails because there was probable cause for the
prosecution. Probable cause is a complete defense to an action for malicious prosecution in New
York. Dickerson v. Napolitano, 604 F.3d 732, 751 (2d Cir. 2010). The existence or lack of
probable cause is measured at the time of the commencement of the judicial proceeding, i.e. at the
time of plaintiff’s arraignment. Mejia v. City of New York, 119 F. Supp. 2d 232 (E.D.N.Y. 2000).
The general rule is that “[p]robable cause to arrest is sufficient for probable cause to prosecute
unless facts come to light between the arrest and arraignment that vitiate the probable cause.” Obilo
v. City Univ. of N.Y, 01-cv-5118 (DGT), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2886, at *34 (E.D.N.Y. February
28, 2003); Dukes v. City of New York, 879 F. Supp. 335, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). While probable
cause to arrest an individual can dissipate by the time criminal proceedings are commenced such to
breathe new life into a malicious prosecution claim, probable cause dissipates only where “the

12

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 24 of 36 PageID #: 1112

groundless nature of the charge [is] made apparent by the discovery of some intervening fact.”
Lowth v. Town of Cheektowaga, 82 F.3d 563, 571 (2d Cir. 1996).
Plaintiff bears the burden of showing there was no probable cause for the criminal
charge. Rothstein v. Carriere, 373 F.3d 275, 282 (2d Cir. 2004). Courts have found that police have
probable cause to arrest if they receive “information from some person, normally the putative victim
or eyewitness.” Panetta v. Crowley, 460 F.3d 388, 395 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Martinez v.
Simonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634 (2d Cir. 2000); McLaurin v. New Rochelle Police Officers, 379 F.
Supp. 2d 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). “Indeed, as sources of information go, crime victims are among the
most reliable; they usually can provide a first-hand non-hearsay account of the criminal activity.”
Campbell v. Giuliani, No. 99 Civ. 2603 (JG), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 609, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 24,
2001) (citing Miloslavsky v. AES Eng’g Soc’y, Inc., 808 F. Supp. 351, 355 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (“The
veracity of citizen complainants who are the victims of the very crime they report to the police is
assumed”)); see also, Crawford v. City of New York, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 8444 (2d Cir. 2012)
(affirming grant of Summary Judgment for defendants where two complaining witnesses claimed
that plaintiff molested them notwithstanding plaintiff’s arguments that the complaining witnesses’
allegations were inconsistent and that officers failed to investigate his alibi and failed to review
ACS file).
As set forth, supra, on September 6, 2010, there was probable cause to arrest
plaintiff for the attempted murder of Seminara, Ortlieb, and Henderson. Plaintiff has proffered no
evidence that probable cause dissipated at the commencement, or during the pendency, of his
criminal prosecution.

Accordingly, plaintiff cannot satisfy the third prong of the malicious

prosecution test and defendants should be granted summary judgment on plaintiff’s malicious
prosecution claim.

13

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 25 of 36 PageID #: 1113

Further, an “indictment by a grand jury creates a presumption of probable cause that
may only be rebutted by evidence that the indictment was procured by fraud, perjury, the
suppression of evidence or other police conduct undertaken in bad faith.” Savino v. City of New
York, 331 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Colon v. New York, 468 N.Y.S.2d 453, 456 (1983))
(emphasis in original); see also McClellan v. Smith, 439 F.3d 137, 145 (2d Cir. 2006) (indictment
“gives rise to a presumption that probable cause exists [for] the crimes described” in the
indictment). This “rule is founded upon the premise that the Grand Jury acts judicially and it may
be presumed that it has acted regularly.” Colon v. New York, 468 N.Y.S.2d 453, 455 (1983).
Plaintiff bears the burden of proof in rebutting the presumption of probable cause. Savino, 331 F.3d
at 73 (citing Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir. 1994)). Plaintiff’s burden may not
be met by offering “mere ‘conjecture’ and ‘surmise’ that [an] indictment was procured as a result of
conduct undertaken by the defendants in bad faith.” Savino, 331 F.3d at 73 (quoting Bryant v.
Maffucci, 923 F.2d 979, 982 (2d Cir. 1991)). Even if an indictment is later dismissed for
insufficient evidence, the presumption of probable cause created by the indictment still stands.
Selinger v. City of New York, No. 08 Civ. 2096 (RMB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119700, at *10-14
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2010), aff’d, No. 10-4955-cv, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 25736 (2d Cir. Dec. 23,
2011). Where a plaintiff was indicted by a grand jury, probable cause for his prosecution is
presumed to have existed. McClellan v. Smith, 439 F.3d 137, 145 (2d Cir. 2006); Green v.
Montgomery, 219 F.3d 52, 60 (2d Cir. 2000). In order to overcome this presumption, plaintiff must
show that “the indictment was produced by fraud, perjury, the suppression of evidence or other
police conduct undertaken in bad faith,” which plaintiff has failed to do. Green, 219 F.3d at 60
(quoting Colon v. City of New York, 60 N.Y.2d 78, 82 (1983)).
Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of proof in rebutting the presumption of
probable cause. Plaintiff has proferred no evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that the

14

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 26 of 36 PageID #: 1114

Grand Jury acted judiciously. Over the course of this litigation, plaintiff has adduced no evidence
that would show that the indictment was procured by fraud, perjury, suppression of evidence, or any
police conduct taken in bad faith. As such, plaintiff has failed to rebut the presumption of probable
cause, and summary judgment must be granted to defendants.
C.

Plaintiff Cannot Show That Defendants Acted with Actual Malice

Plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim also fails because Plaintiff cannot show any
evidence of actual malice on the part of defendants. New York law requires plaintiff to establish
that the defendants commenced the criminal proceeding due to a wrong or improper motive, such as
something other than a desire to see the ends of justice served. Rounseville v. Zahl, 13 F.3d 625,
631 (2d Cir. 1994). Only where probable cause to initiate a proceeding is “so totally lacking” may
malice reasonably be inferred. Sulkowska v. City of New York, 129 F. Supp. 2d 274, 295 (S.D.N.Y.
2001) (quoting Martin v. City of Albany, 42 N.Y.2d 13, 17 (1977)).
In this case, there is no evidence that Defendant Freed initiated or continued the
prosecution of Plaintiff at all, or that any of the defendants acted with actual malice, as Plaintiff has
provided no evidence that probable cause was “so totally lacking.” Since plaintiff’s arrest was
based on complaints by three victims, Joseph Seminara, Robert Henderson, and Robert Ortlieb, that
they were shot at by the Plaintiff, there was probable cause for the arrest of Plaintiff and so malice
cannot be inferred. Because there is nothing in the record to suggest that Defendants acted with
malice, Plaintiff’s claim of malicious prosecution must fail.
D.

Plaintiff’s Claims With Regard to Defendants Grand Jury Testimony Fail As
A Matter of Law.

To the extent that plaintiff seeks to bring a malicious prosecution claim based on his
conclusory challenge to defendants Freed, Seminara, or Ortlieb’s statements before the grand jury,
such a claim will also fail. Under the U.S. Supreme Court, Rehberg v. Paulk, a plaintiff cannot
satisfy his burden to overcome the presumption of probable cause created by a Grand Jury
15

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 27 of 36 PageID #: 1115

indictment by relying upon testimony made to a Grand Jury. Rehberg v. Paulk, ___ U.S. ___, 132
S. Ct. 1497, 1505-10 (2012) (holding that witnesses who testify before a grand jury are immune
from suit for having done so). ); Coggins v. Buonora, No. cv-13-4635, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 487
(2d Cir. Jan. 13, 2015) (holding that, post-Rehberg, a plaintiff cannot establish a § 1983 claim by
relying on grand jury testimony); Jovanovic v. City of New York, No. 10-4398-cv, (2d Cir. June 20,
2012) (Summary Order) (finding police officer absolutely immune from claim of fabrication of
evidence for testifying before the grand jury). As such, to the extent that plaintiff claims that
defendants made false statements in their Grand Jury testimony, such allegations are barred under
Rehberg and cannot be used to overcome the presumption of probable cause created by plaintiff’s
indictment. As such, plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim fails as a matter of law.
POINT III
PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR DENIAL OF THE
RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL SHOULD BE
DISMISSED AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS
Plaintiff alleges a denial of the right to a fair trial based upon the defendants
conveying the false identification of Plaintiff as the perpetrator to the District Attorney’s Office,
conveying fabricated testimony that Plaintiff selected his position in the lineup, in addition to
withholding the facts surrounding the defendants “inability to observe the shooter,” withholding or
misrepresenting the circumstances of the “tainted and otherwise sham identification procedures,”
withholding the identity of Trevor Perez from the ADA, and did not disclose the “coerced written
statement by Trevor Perez.” (Compl. Exh. A ¶¶ 38, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56.) Plaintiff’s claims are
without legal basis and should be summarily dismissed.
To ultimately prevail on this cause of action, a plaintiff must prove that a defendant
fabricated evidence that would be likely to influence a jury’s decision, that he forwarded that
evidence to prosecutors, and that the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of liberty as a result. Jovanovic

16

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 28 of 36 PageID #: 1116

v. City of New York, 486 Fed. Appx. 149, 152 (2d Cir. 2012); Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 124
F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 1997). In order to find for plaintiff, you must find that the manufactured or
fabricated evidence was the proximate cause of the deprivation of plaintiff’s liberty. Id. Plaintiff’s
allegations are insufficient to state a claim for denial of the right to a fair trial.
Even if the statements made by officers Freed, Seminara, Ortlieb, and Henderson
were untrue, they are an insufficient predicate for Plaintiff’s claim of denial of the right to a fair trial
because the alleged falsifications are testimonial. As a matter of law, police officers, like other
witnesses, are immune from liability for giving false testimony in connection with criminal matters.
Rehberg v. Paulk, 132 S. Ct. 1497, 1505-07 (2012); Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 335 (1983);
Jovanovic, 486 Fed. Appx. at 152 (dismissing a fair trial claim where “the only avenue by which the
[allegedly false evidence] could reach the jury was through [the officer’s] testimony, for which he
enjoys absolute immunity”). This rule applies with equal force to pre-trial testimony as to trial or
grand jury testimony. Rehberg, 132 S. Ct. at 1507 (immunity extends to “preparatory activity, such
as a preliminary discussion in which the witness relates the substance of his intended testimony” to
the prosecutor); Brown v. City of New York, No. 14-CV-5372 (BMC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
181736, at *9-10 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2014) (a false statement in the arrest paperwork, the criminal
court complaint or told to a district attorney is not actionable because, as inadmissible hearsay, it
would never get before a jury in a criminal case); Jones v. City of New York, 2013 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 162235, at *28-29 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2013) (finding that “a false statement by [a police
officer] to an ADA…would amount to inadmissible hearsay” and therefore could not be “likely to
influence a jury’s decision.” (quoting Ricciuti, 125 F.3d at 130 and citing Jocks v. Tavernier, 316
F.3d 128, 138 (2d Cir. 2003))), vacated on other grounds by 603 Fed. Appx. 13 (2d Cir. Mar. 4,
2015); Horvath v. City of New York, No. 12cv6005 (RJD) (JMA), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51029, at

17

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 29 of 36 PageID #: 1117

*17 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2015); see also Fappiano v. City of New York, No. 01-cv-2476 (SLT), 2014
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179584, at *66 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2015).
As the only evidence that defendants are alleged to have falsified are statements
regarding their ability to view the perpetrator, and the allegedly false identifications themselves of
Plaintiff, were statements made/conveyed to the ADA, plaintiff’s hypothetical cause of action for
denial of the right to a fair trial must be dismissed as a matter of law. The present case is
distinguishable from Ricciuti and Jocks, which dealt with a fabricated post-arrest confession of the
plaintiff that led to an additional deprivation of liberty beyond the arrest and prosecution for assault
in the first instance, and an allegedly fabricated written statement post arrest.
The Plaintiff is attempting to do exactly what the Supreme Court said in Rehberg
should not be allowed: he is attempting to circumvent the rule of grand jury immunity by claiming
the wrong occurred when the officers conspired to present false testimony. Rehberg, 132 S. Ct. at
1506 (“this rule may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to prevent
false testimony…”). This should not be allowed because at its core, Plaintiff’s fabrication of
evidence claim is a “§ 1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of the prosecution.” Id.
To state a claim against an individual police officer, a plaintiff must show that “each
particular police officer has knowingly or with gross recklessness violated his rights – alleging a
collective violation is insufficient.” Brown v. City of New York, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181736,
*11 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2014). “The manufacture of false evidence, in and of itself…does not
impair anyone’s liberty, and therefore does not impair anyone’s constitutional right.” Zahrey v.
Coffey, 221 F.3d 342, 348 (2d Cir. 2000). Furthermore, “Court should be wary of attempts by
creative litigants who cannot meet the requirements of recognized common-law derived
constitutional torts like false arrest or malicious prosecution to create new rights with labels that
sound attractive but make little logical sense and have no common law antecedents.” Id. at 8. As

18

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 30 of 36 PageID #: 1118

Plaintiff fails to allege that the defendants did any more than convey false or fabricated statements
to the prosecutor, there can be no claim for denial of the right to fair trial as against them for their
testimonial evidence, and the claim should be dismissed.
A. Plaintiff has no claim under Brady
To the extent Plaintiff alleges a denial of the right to a fair trial based upon the
withholding of evidence or information, his claim fails as a matter of law, since the information was
not forwarded to prosecutors, and could therefore not be relied on by a jury. In Brady v. Maryland,
the Supreme Court held that “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an
accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to
punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).
In order to establish a Brady violation, the aggrieved party must show that the prosecution
“suppressed” evidence “favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is
impeaching,” and “prejudice” ensued. Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999). While
police officers, like prosecutors, have a constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence, their
Brady obligation extends only as far as the DA’s Office. Walker V. New York, 974 F.2d 293, 299
(2d Cir. 1992).
The majority view amongst the circuits is that when a Plaintiff is acquitted of the
criminal charges against him, it “negates any violation of his Brady rights and extinguishes any
Section 1983 due process claim that might arise from Defendants’ alleged suppression of
exculpatory evidence.” Ambrose v. City of New York, et al., 623 F. Supp. 2d 454, 471 (S.D.N.Y.
Mar. 31, 2009); see also Pizarro v. City of New York, et al., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131471, *21-22
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2015). The fact that it could be argued that the suppression of Brady material
could “prevent a defendant from securing an earlier favorable termination of his or her case is not
considered as a potential source of ‘prejudice’ within the meaning of the Brady rule.” Id. at 472.

19

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 31 of 36 PageID #: 1119

Additionally, this Circuit has found that Brady does not “mandate disclosure of evidence any earlier
than the point in time at which the criminal defendant needs access to the evidence so that he or she
may effectively use it at a proceeding that determines guilt.” Id. at 469. Accordingly, since the
claims against plaintiff were dismissed, he can have no claim under Brady.
POINT IV
PLAINTIFF CANNOT ESTABLISH A FAILURE
TO INTERVENE CLAIM AGAINST ANY
INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANT
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to intervene on his behalf. (Compl. Ex. A
¶¶ 79-83.) As a threshold matter, plaintiff cannot state a claim for failure to intervene because he
has failed to establish a violation of his constitutional rights. Glassman v. City of New York, No.
10 Civ. 2468 (SHS), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1170 at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2013 (“Where the
arresting and prosecuting officers committed no constitutional violation, a claim for failure to
intervene will not lie.”) Moreover, even to the extent that plaintiff could establish that defendants
should be deemed liable for false arrest, because they are entitled to qualified immunity, his failure
to intervene claim cannot stand. Rodriguez v. City of New York, No. 08-CV-04173 (RRM) (RLM),
2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43005 at *38 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2012) (“police officers are immune from
suit for failure to intervene if the qualified immunity test is met.”). Assuming, arguendo, that
plaintiff had established a violation of his constitutional rights for which the defendants were not
entitled to qualified immunity, there would still be no basis for imposing liability against the
defendants for failure to intervene.
“[L]aw enforcement officials have an affirmative duty to intervene to protect against
the infringement of constitutional rights from conduct committed by other officers in their
presence.” Curley v. Village of Suffern, 268 F. 3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 2001). If they fail to do so, “in
order for liability to attach, they must have known that a constitutional violation was being

20

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 32 of 36 PageID #: 1120

committed,” Hewitt v. City of New York, No. 2009-CV-0214 (RJD) (MDG), 2011 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 11479, 3-4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2011), and “there must have been a realistic opportunity to
intervene to prevent harm from occurring.” Anderson v. Branen, 17 F.3d 552, 557 (2d Cir. 1994).
It appears as if Plaintiff alleges that all of the defendants collectively, directly,
violated his rights and somehow also failed to intervene. The premise of Plaintiff’s claim is unclear
and unsound. Such an argument is untenable, and the claim should be dismissed.
POINT V
DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED
IMMUNITY
If the Court finds that Seminara, Ortlieb, and Henderson should not be dismissed as
defendants for lack of personal involvement, as they were the victims of the crime and nothing
more, then all Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from suit for the arrest and prosecution
of plaintiff. The “doctrine of qualified immunity shields public officials performing discretionary
functions from civil liability insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known or insofar as it was
objectively reasonable for them to believe that their acts did not violate those rights.” Bradway v.
Gonzales, 26 F.3d 313, 317-18 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal citations and quotations omitted); Thomas v.
Roach, 165 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir. 1999).
Defendants should be granted qualified immunity with respect to plaintiff’s false
arrest and malicious prosecution claims. A police officer is entitled to qualified immunity from a
claim for arrest without probable cause if: (1) it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe
that probable cause existed; or (2) officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether
there was probable cause. Zellner v. Summerlin, 494 F.3d 344, 369 (2d Cir. 2007) (citations
omitted).

“An officer’s actions are objectively unreasonable when no officer of reasonable

competence could have made the same choice in similar circumstances.” Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d
21

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 33 of 36 PageID #: 1121

416, 420-21 (2d Cir. 1995). For qualified immunity purposes, in deciding whether an officer’s
conduct was “objectively reasonable,” the Court must examine the information possessed by the
officer at the time of the arrest, but “[courts] do not consider the subjective intent, motives, or
beliefs” of the officer. Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. Crotty, 346 F.3d 84, 106 (2d Cir. 2003).
In the instant matter, it is clear that defendant Freed is entitled to qualified immunity.
Based on the information available to Freed at the time of the arrest, namely the identification of the
Plaintiff as the perpetrator in a photo array, it was objectively reasonable for Freed to believe that
there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff. Even if the Court were to conclude that probable cause
was absent, there was still “arguable probable cause” to arrest plaintiff. See Zellner, 494 F.3d at
369. Accordingly, defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because their actions in arresting
plaintiff were lawful and objectively reasonable.

POINT VI
PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS AGAINST JOHN DOE 1
SHOULD BE DISMISSED
Plaintiff’s claims against John Doe 1 officer should be dismissed and he should
properly be removed from the caption of the complaint. Plaintiff filed this Second Amended
Consolidated Complaint on July 21, 2015, after the close of discovery and over one dozen
depositions. Plaintiff has failed to amend the complaint or attempt to add or substitute officers for
the John Doe unidentified officer. Plaintiff should not be permitted to use the John Doe as a place
holder for an individual they’ve been unable to identify. Accordingly, John Doe 1 officer should be
dismissed from the complaint and removed from the caption.

22

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 34 of 36 PageID #: 1122

POINT VII
PLAINTIFF’S STATE LAW CLAIMS SHOULD
BE DISMISSED UNDER NEW YORK LAW
In addition to asserting state law claims that correspond to their federal claims,
specifically false arrest and malicious prosecution, plaintiff alleges in conclusory fashion that
defendants violated his rights under New York State law. First, plaintiff attempts to present a state
law theory of respondeat superior liability against defendant City, which requires plaintiff to
establish that an individual defendant, acting within the scope of his or her employment, committed
a culpable act. Massey v. Starbucks Corp., No. 03 Civ. 7279 (SAS), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12993,
at *24 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2004). Because plaintiff has failed to establish culpable conduct by
defendants, this claim necessarily fails.
Even if Plaintiff could establish a state law claim against defendants relating to his
detention and arrest, defendants are entitled to governmental immunity. “‘[W]hen official action [of
a police officer] involves the exercise of discretion of expert judgment in policy matters, and is not
exclusively ministerial, [he] generally is not answerable in damages for the injurious consequences
of that action.’”

Cerbelli v. City of New York, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109341, at *76-77

(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2008) (citing Mon v. City of New York, 574 N.Y.S.2d 529 (N.Y. 1991)
(brackets in original)). If a plaintiff’s claims relate to an officer’s exercise of discretion, then
“governmental immunity applies unless the court also finds that the exercise of discretion was
unreasonable.” Id. at 77. In this case, in exercising their discretion, the individual defendants acted
reasonably and, as such, are protected by governmental immunity. Kijak v. Columbia Presbyterian
Hosp., No. 11 Civ. 6076 (NRB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134965, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2013)
(“A public employee’s discretionary acts, comprising ‘conduct involving the exercise of reasoned
judgment,’ may not result in liability for the municipality.”) (citing Lauer v. City of New York, 711
N.Y.S.2d 112 (2000)).
23

Case 1:11-cv-05910-PKC-RER Document 77 Filed 04/18/16 Page 35 of 36 PageID #: 1123

Plaintiff brings a further claim for battery. Under New York Law, a “‘battery’ is an
intentional wrongful physical contact with another person without consent.” Girden v. Sandals
Int’l, 262 F.3d 195, 203 (2d Cir. 2001). Plaintiff pled no specific allegations against the defendants
to support this claim. Accordingly, it should be dismissed.
To the extent Plaintiff’s state law claims are not dismissed for the reasons advanced
herein, because defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all plaintiffs’ federal causes of
action, the Court should decline to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state law
claims. See Astra Media Group, LLC v. Clear Channel Taxi Media, LLC, 414 F. App’x 334, 337
(2d Cir. 2011) (“where all federal claims have been dismissed at a relatively early stage, the district
court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendant state law claims”). See, e.g.,
Pitchell v. Callan, 13 F.3d 545, 549 (2d Cir. 1994) (“it is axiomatic that a court should decline to
exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims when it dismisses the federal claims prior to trial”).
Based on the foregoing, plaintiff cannot maintain his state law causes of action, and
therefore, these claims should be dismissed and defendants granted summary judgment.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendants City of New York, Devon Freed, Joseph
Seminara, Robert Henderson, and Robert Ortlieb, respectfully request that the Court grant their
motion for summary judgment in its entirety, together with costs, fees and such other and further
relief as the Court deems just and proper.
