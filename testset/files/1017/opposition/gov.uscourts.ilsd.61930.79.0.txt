PLAINTIFFS' RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO DISMISS SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
COMES NOW Plaintiffs, by and through undersigned counsel, and for their Response in
Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint state as follows:
INTRODUCTION
The Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint
The Plaintiffs, Kelly Sonnenberg and Casey Sonnenberg, are class representatives of
Illinois citizens seeking to recover losses resulting from the Defendants’ illegal operation of an
internet gambling site. The reasons that two separate individuals have filed claims is because
Kelly and Casey rely upon different sections of Illinois’ Anti-Gambling statute, 720 ILCS 5/28
et. seq.

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 2 of 18 Page ID #549

Kelly Sonnenberg’s claims, stated in counts 1, 5, and 91 of the Second Amended
Complaint, relies upon 728 ILCS 5/28-8, commonly known as the Loss Recovery Act. Kelly
Sonnenberg did not lose money nor play on the Defendants’ illegal site but, as more fully set out,
that is not a requirement under the Loss Recovery Act.
Casey Sonnenberg did lose money playing on the Defendants’ illegal site. His claims are
stated in Counts 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 of the Second Amended Complaint. These counts
rely upon sections of the Illinois Anti-Gambling statute other than the Loss Recovery Act.

The Illinois Anti-Gambling statute, 728 ILCS 5/28 et. seq.
The Illinois Anti-Gambling statute contains nine sections; although section 6 was
repealed. The Complaint sets out the relevant sections for the lawsuit, (Second Amended
Complaint paragraphs 19, 20, 21, and 22). These sections will be more fully discussed in other
parts of this memo. However, by way of introduction, the Committee Comments are relevant
here:
Gambling has long since been recognized as an activity
detrimental to the best interest of society, primarily because of the
evil consequences which accompany it. (See Peterson, Gambling
Should It Be Legalized? (1951).) Illinois, like most other states,
has prohibited certain types of gambling almost from the inception
of government in the state. The laws proscribing this activity date
from as early as 1874. That statute prohibited gaming generally,
the keeping of a gaming house, gambling in futures, and made
gambling contracts void. This law was followed by prohibitions on
bookmaking and pool selling…
Article 28 represents an attempt to present a unified statute which
correctly express as public policy of the state towards gambling
and at the same time avoids ambiguity and inconsistency.
(Committee Comments to Article 28)

The Complaint mistakenly lists Count 9 as Count IV. Second Amended Complaint, page 24.

ARGUMENT
As this Court has noted: "motions to dismiss . . . 'must receive careful scrutiny' and
are 'not often granted.'" United States v. City of Fairview Heights, Ill., 132 F. Supp. 2d
684, 686 (S.D. Ill. 2000) (quoting Sidney S. Arst Co. v. Pipefitters Welfare Educ. Fund, 25
F.3d 417, 420 (7th Cir. 1994)). This is because the issue is not whether a plaintiff will
ultimately prevail on his claims but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to
support the claims. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974), abrogated on other
grounds by Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982).
A court must assume as true all well-pleaded facts and reasonable inferences, and
construes these in the light most favorable to the plaintiff when ruling on a 12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss. See Fries v. Helsper, 146 F.3d 452 (7th Cir. 1998) citing Wiemerslage
Through Wilmerslage v. Maine Twp. High School Dist., 29 F.3d 1149 (7th Cir. 1994). A
claim may only be dismissed if it is beyond doubt that no set of facts would entitle the
plaintiff to relief. See Travel All over the World, Inc. v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 73 F.3d
1423 (7th Cir. 1996) citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957).
Here, the Defendants’ motion must be denied. Kelly Sonnenberg has adequately plead a
cause of action pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/28-8. She has alleged that the defendants are “winners”
pursuant to the statute and has identified both the loser and losses she seeks to recover for.
Furthermore, Casey Sonnenberg has also adequately plead causes of action pursuant to 720 ILCS
5/28-1, -3, and -7. A private cause of action can be implied from a criminal statute under
Illinois law. Also, as all gambling contracts are null and void, recovery is proper for all monies
lost pursuant to said contracts, and recovery may be had for any violation of Article 28. (See 720
ILCS 5/28-7(a).

I.

Kelly Sonnenberg Has Adequately Plead a Claim for Relief Under Illinois Law
As discussed above, Kelly Sonnenberg’s cause of action is alleged pursuant to 720 ILCS

5/28-8.
A.

Defendants are Winners and are Liable for Plaintiffs’ Losses Under Illinois Law
In dismissing Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, the Court relied heavily on a recent

Northern District of Illinois decision, Langone v. Kaiser and FanDuel, Inc., 2013 WL 5567587
(N.D. Ill. Oct. 9, 2013). That case was decided after the parties here completed briefing on
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint. As such, Plaintiffs never had the
opportunity to argue the application or correctness of that non-binding decision.
The Defendants here are considered “winners” and are liable for losses of Illinois
gamblers in two distinct ways. First, the Defendants won money directly from Illinois gamblers
in the form of a “rake” from the games. In poker, the “rake” is the portion of money kept by the
operator of a card room as a commission for hosting the game. Under Illinois law, the rake is
considered “winnings” for the house. Second, the Defendants are also liable for all of the losses
of Illinois gamblers on Pokerstars, including money lost to other individual gamblers, pursuant to
720 ILCS 5/28-3.
(1).
The Defendants won money directly from Illinois residents in the form of a
“rake” collected from each game they hosted.
In Langone, the court held an operator of a “fantasy sports” website was not considered a
winner for the purposes of the LRA as they did not wager or risk any money themselves. Id. at 7.

4

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 5 of 18 Page ID #552

Instead, the court noted they functioned as “the house” and acted as a conduit for transmission of
the prize to other participants. Id.
It’s worth first noting the distinction between fantasy sports and poker. In Langone, the
Defendants’ games allowed participants to choose “professional players in a given sport ... and to
compete against other fantasy sports participants based upon the actual performance of those
players in key statistical categories.” Id. at 1. Here, the Defendants operated online card rooms
that offered live poker. However, even if the analysis is the same for online poker and online
fantasy sports, the Langone court misinterpreted relevant Illinois law and reached an incorrect
holding.
The Langone court relied on two cases to hold that the keeper of a gambling house is not
liable to a loser unless they also risk money gambling. Id. at 7, citing Holmes v. Brickey, 82
N.E.2d 200, 202 (Ill.App. 3Dist. 1948); Ranney v. Flinn, 60 Ill.App. 104 (Ill.App. 3Dist. 1894).
These cases, however, do not stand for that proposition.
Ranney’s facts are similar to the instant case. There, a saloon owner kept a room upstairs
in which he allowed patrons to gamble at poker. Id. Like the Defendants here, the saloon owner
received a portion of the money wagered on each hand as a rake, or commission, for hosting the
games. Id. A judgment was entered against the Defendants for which they appealed. Id. The
court reversed the judgment as there was insufficient evidence to show that the Plaintiff lost
more than the statutory minimum to the Defendant. Id. at 105.
The court in Langone stated “in Ranney, the Court emphasized that the owner of a saloon
who provided a room for poker games was only a winner when he actually played in the games.”

5

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 6 of 18 Page ID #553

Langone at 7. This is a misstatement of the holding. The Ranney court expressly did not offer an
opinion as to whether a “rake” constituted winnings. Ranney at 105. The Court stated:
The evidence tends to show that [the saloon owner] received
compensation for the use of the room in “chips,” representing
money, whenever certain hands were held--and that Flinn had
frequent occasion to contribute “chips” to the table in this way--but
assuming that money so received by the defendant was money won
by him within the statute, as to which no opinion need be
expressed, there is no proof that he ever received thus as much as
$10 from Flinn at any one sitting. Id. (emphasis added)
Thus, the Ranney decision does not apply here as it was decided on a jurisdictional basis
and does not speak to whether a rake can be considered “winnings” of the house. However,
while there was no holding on the issue either way, the Ranney court certainly contemplated the
possibility of this being the case.
The Langone court similarly misapplied Holmes in its decision. In Holmes, the court
reversed a lower court’s granting of a motion to dismiss an amended complaint that made similar
allegations as Kelly Sonnenberg makes here. The Holmes defendants operated a gambling
establishment in which the Plaintiff lost money. Holmes at 200. The Plaintiff brought an action
against the owner of the establishment for these losses. Id. The court held that Plaintiffs stated a
valid cause of action:
As to the amended complaint stating a cause of action, it will be
noted that the allegations are that the defendant conducted a
gambling establishment and that as a result of the plaintiff having
engaged in gambling games at the place of the defendant he owed
the defendant certain money in excess of $10.00 as a result of
certain games of chance played with dice, and that he did pay to
the defendant certain sums of money as a result of the losses
incurred in said games and on no other consideration. These
allegations are clear and concise and include every fact necessary
for the plaintiff to prove to entitle him to succeed. Such allegations

6

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 7 of 18 Page ID #554

are sufficient to state a cause of action. Id. at 202. (emphasis in
original)
The Holmes court went on to address the ruling in Rammey and, though it did state that
the “winner and not the keeper of the house is liable to the loser,” it did not say that the
establishment’s rake is not considered winnings. Indeed, it noted that “[w]e do not believe that
the decision in Ranney intended any comfort for operators of gambling houses, but rather
imposes the burden on the plaintiff to allege and prove who did win his money or thing of value,
be he the owner of a gambling house or just a fellow gambler.” Id. Like the amended complaint
in Holmes, Kelly Sonnenberg has alleged a loss greater than the statutory minimum was paid to
the defendants by her son, Casey. Kelly must now have the opportunity to prove with evidence
that the defendants were the winners of this money. As such, and like in Holmes, the Motion to
Dismiss should be denied.
(2).
The Defendants are also liable for all of the losses of Illinois gamblers
pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/28-3.
Besides the money won by the Defendants directly in the form of the rake, the
Defendants are also liable for all of the losses of Illinois residents on Pokerstars pursuant to 720
ILCS 5/28-3. This section makes the keeping of a “gambling place” illegal. Id. Furthermore,
subsection (c) states “[s]uch premises of any person who knowingly permits thereon a violation
of any Section of this Article shall be held liable for, and may be sold to pay any unsatisfied
judgment that may be recovered and any unsatisfied fine that may be levied under any Section of
this Article.” 720 ILCS 5/28-3(c). Emphasis Supplied.
As detailed herein, and as admitted to in their memorandum, the Defendants have
violated numerous provisions of multiple sections of the Anti-Gambling Article. By a plain

7

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 8 of 18 Page ID #555

reading of this section, the Defendants shall be liable for all losses caused by those violations.
As such, the motion to dismiss should be denied.
B.

Kelly Sonnenberg Has Adequately Identified a Loser and a Loss

In Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, Kelly Sonnenberg identifies a loser and the
losses she seeks to recover. The Second Amended Complaint states Kelly’s son Casey
Sonnenberg “had an account with Pokerstars and has lost money amounting to a sum of $50.00
or more to the Defendants.” See SAC ¶ 4. This identifies a) the identity of the loser, b) the loss
that is sought to recover, and c) the identity of the winners of these losses. This is sufficient for
the purposes of this Complaint. For further details, see the affidavit of Casey Sonnenberg
attached as Exhibit A.
Furthermore, specifics of Casey Sonnenberg’s, and all other Illinois gamblers’, history of
losses are in the control of the defendants. The Court should deny the Defendants’ motion to
dismiss and allow discovery into their player data.
II.

Casey Sonnenberg Has Stated a Claim for Relief Under the Illinois Anti-

Gambling Statute.
As previously mentioned Casey Sonnenberg has stated claims in Count 2 (relying upon
728 ILCS 5/28-1), 3 (relying upon 728 ILCS 5/28-3), 4 (relying upon 728 ILCS 5/28-7) against
Rational Entertainment Enterprises, LTD and identical theories in Counts 6, 7, and 8 against the
Defendant, Oldford Group, LTD.

A.

728 ILCS 5/28-1 Allows a Civil Cause of Action for the Class Represented by
Casey
8

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 9 of 18 Page ID #556

The relevant portions of 728 ILCS 5/28-1 relied upon by Casey Sonnenberg in Counts 2
and 6 are as follows:
728 ILCS 5/28-1 Gambling
(a)

A person commits gambling when he:
(1)

Plays a game of chance or skill for money or other thing of
value, unless excepted in subsection (b) of this Section; or

(2)

Makes a wager upon the result of any game, contest, or any
political nomination, appointment or election; or

(3)

Operates, keeps, owns, uses, purchases, exhibits, rents, sells,
bargains for the sale or lease of, manufactures or distributes
any gambling device; or

(5)

Knowingly owns or possesses any book, instrument or
apparatus by means of which bets or wagers have been, or
are, recorded or registered, or knowingly possesses any
money which he has received in the course of a bet or
wager; or

(11)

Knowingly transmits information as to wagers, betting odds,
or changes in betting odds by telephone, telegraph, radio,
semaphore, or similar means; or knowingly installs or
maintains equipment for the transmissions or receipt of
such information; except that nothing in this subdivision
(11) prohibits transmissions or receipt of such information
for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests; or

(12)

Knowingly establishes, maintains, or operates an Internet
site that permits a person to play a game of chance or skill
for money or other thing of value by means of the Internet
or to make a wage upon the result of any game, contest,
political nomination, appointment, or election by means of
the Internet. This item (12) does not apply to activities
referenced in item (6) and (6.1) of subsection (b) of this
section.

9

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 10 of 18 Page ID #557

Under section (c) of 28-1 a person who initially violates these provisions is guilty of a
class A misdemeanor while a subsequent conviction is a class 4 felony.
The Defendants maintain that a criminal statute may not provide the basis for a civil
cause of action. (Defendants Motion to Dismiss, pages 12 through 14) However, the Defendants
have failed to cite the relevant law. The Defendants cite two cases for the proposition that a
criminal statute cannot be used to support a civil cause of action: Mallet v. Wisconsin Division of
Vocational Rehabilitation 130 F. 3d 1245 (7th Circuit 1997) and Israel Aircraft Industries, LTD
v. Sanwa Business Credit Corp. 16 F. 3d 200 (7th Circuit 1994) These cases do not apply here
because the criminal statutes at issue in those cases were federal criminal statutes, not state
statutes.
In interpreting a state statute, a federal court must apply that state’s statutory construction
principles. See Brownsburg Area Patrons v. Baldwin, 137 F. 3d 503, 507 (7th Circuit 1998).
Under longstanding Illinois law a court may determine that a private cause of action is implied in
a statute even if the explicit language of the statute does not provide for one. Fischer v.
Lexington Health Care, 188 Ill. 2d 455, 722 N.E. 2d 1115 (1999).
The test to determine if a private right of action is appropriate involves balancing four
factors: (1) the Plaintiff is a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted, (2)
the Plaintiff suffered an injury that the statute was designed to prevent, (3) a private cause of
action is consistent with the underlying purpose of the statute, and (4) a private right of action is
necessary to provide an adequate remedy for statutory violations. Id. at 460. For a recent case
applying these principles see Cowper v. Nyberg, 2014 IL App (5th) 120415 Consideration of
these factors strongly favor Casey Sonnenberg’s right to bring the present suit.
(1).

Casey Sonnenberg and the class he seeks to represent are persons for whose
benefits 720 ILCS 5/28-1 was enacted.
10

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 11 of 18 Page ID #558

As previously established 720 ILCS 5/28-1 was enacted to prevent the scourge of
gambling. The Defendants make no argument that their conduct was legal under 728 ILCS 5/281. As a recidivist offender, the Defendants have committed numerous felonies under Illinois law.
Casey Sonnenberg has cited six provisions of 5/28-1 to support his claim, especially relevant is
section (12) which make it illegal to “knowingly establish, maintain, or operate an Internet site
that permits a person to play a game of chance on skill for money or other thing of value by
means of the Internet or to make a wager upon the result of any game, contract, political
nomination, election or appointment by means of the Internet.2
Casey Sonnenberg has alleged that he had an account with Pokerstars and lost money
gambling on the Defendants’ illegal gambling website. (Second Amended Complaint paragraphs
4 and 6) as well as representing a class of similarly situated victims (Second Amended
Complaint, paragraphs 49 through 56). The proposed Plaintiff’s class are precisely the persons
who were intended to be protected by the anti-gambling statute.
(2).

The proposed class suffered injuries that the statute was designed to protect
against.

This factor is also in the Plaintiff’s favor. Casey Sonnenberg seeks to recover losses for
the class of people who suffered injury (losses) on account of the Defendants’ illegal Internet
gambling site. (Second Amended Complaint, paragraph 49) He seeks to represent only “Illinois
gamblers” who lost money on the Defendants illegal website. (Id.) Clearly, the proposed class
are persons who suffered injuries which the statute was designed to protect against, or why even
make it illegal to “knowingly establish, maintain, or operate” an Internet gambling site?
(3).

2

Casey Sonnenberg’s private cause of action asserted in the Second Amended
Complaint is consistent with the purpose of 720 ILCS 5/28-1.

“Internet” is defined at 720 ILCS 5/28-2(a)(5).

11

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 12 of 18 Page ID #559

As stated, Casey Sonnenberg only seeks to represent a class of “Illinois” citizens who
suffered losses on the Defendants’ illegal site. He is not seeking a nationwide class or to
represent any persons who have no arguable claim to the protection of Illinois law. An award of
damages to such a class is completely consistent with the intent of the legislature to protect
Illinois citizens from the scourge of illegal gambling and, especially, the scourge of illegal
internet gambling, Again, see 720 ILCS 5/28-1 (a)(12).
Put somewhat differently, an award of damages to the class proposed by Casey
Sonnenberg would not be inconsistent with the clear goals of Illinois anti-gambling statute, 720
ILCS 5/28-1. Again, this factor strongly favors Casey Sonnenberg’s assertion of a private cause
of action.
(4).

Implying a private cause of action to Casey Sonnenberg’s proposed class is
necessary to provide an adequate remedy for violations of 720 ILCS 5/28-1.

For whatever reason, no Illinois prosecutor has charged the Defendants for their admitted
violation of Illinois’ prohibition of illegal gambling by operating an illegal internet gambling
website. Therefore, these Defendants are not at any risk of criminal conviction. Even if they were
facing such a prosecution, an implied private cause of action might still be necessary to
financially compensate victims.
However, without any threat of criminal prosecution, Casey Sonnenberg’s proposed class
is necessary to provide an adequate remedy to those harmed by the Defendants’ commission of
numerous illegal acts. Casey’s suit is available to provide an adequate remedy for the
Defendants’ illegal activity. Apparently, it is the only remedy to address the harms the Illinois
legislature sought to prevent by enacting Section 28-1.

12

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 13 of 18 Page ID #560

In conclusion, each of the four factors used by courts to decide whether an Illinois statute
implies a private cause of action are in favor of Casey Sonnenberg’s proposed class. If an
implied right to private action is not found here, then there will be no vindication of the
legislative intent behind Illinois’ Anti-Gambling statute. The instant suit is why Illinois courts
allow a private cause of action to be implied through no explicit statutory language supports it;
without such a suit, the law will be unenforced.
Finally, as to this point, it seems clear that 720 ILCS 5/28-7 provides an explicit right to
pursue a civil suit for violations of Section 28-1 and all other criminal prohibitions against
gambling under Article 28. Section 28-7 will be discussed again below but it is relevant to point
out in this portion of the brief that it allows a court to declare “null and void” any monies “won”
or obtained in violation of any section of this Article 720 ILCS 5/28-7(a) Emphasis Supplied.
Therefore, any losses suffered by victims due to the Defendants violation of Section 28-1,
may be recovered because Section 28-7 renders the obligation to pay same null and void. This is
the explicit right to a civil remedy the Defendants claim does not exist. Should the court feel this
straight forward analysis in error, then, for reasons already stated, Casey Sonnenberg,
individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, can maintain a civil action for violations
of Section 28-1.

B.

728 ILCS 5/28-3, Keeping a Gambling Place Allows an Implied Private Cause
of Action for the Class of Victims Represented by Casey Sonnenberg
720 ILCS 5/28-3 makes it illegal to Keep a Gambling Place. Specifically, “any person

who knowingly permits any premises or property owned or occupied by him or under his control
to be used as a gambling place” commits a misdemeanor. A subsequent offense is a class four
felony. For all of the reasons stated previously with regard to 5/28-1, a private cause of action
13

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 14 of 18 Page ID #561

should be applied here as well. Without it, the law will be unenforced and victims left without
recourse or without the protection of the law the legislature intended.

C.

Casey Sonnenberg has stated a cause of action under 720 ILCS 5/28-7
This statute explicitly provides for a civil remedy. It imposes no criminal liability. In

pertinent part it states:
5/28-7 Gambling Contracts Void
(a) All promises, notes, bills, bonds, covenants, contracts,
agreements, judgments, mortgages, or other securities or
conveyances made, given, granted, drawn, or entered into, or
executed by any person whatsoever, where the whole or any part of
the consideration thereof is for any money or thing of value, won
or obtained in violation of any Section of this Article are null and
void.
(b) Any obligation void under this Section may be set aside and
vacated by any
court of competent jurisdiction, upon a complaint filed for that
purpose, by the person so granting, giving, entering into, or
executing the same, or by his executors or administrators, or by
any creditor, heir, legatee, purchaser or other person interested
therein; or if a judgment, the same may be set aside on motion of
any person stated above, on due notice thereof given. (Emphasis
added.)
The Defendants admit that, “This provision of the Illinois gambling statute was drafted to
void existing obligations incurred in gambling contracts.” (Defendants Motion to Dismiss,
paragraph 14) Of course, that is precisely what Casey Sonnenberg’s suit seeks, to void all of the
illegal contracts the Defendants entered into with Illinois citizens and to return all ill-gotten gains
back to the victims of the Defendants’ illegal schemes.
Seemingly the Defendants admission admits all. However, the Defendants argue that
Casey’s suit under this provision cannot stand because “typically” this provision is used as an

14

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 15 of 18 Page ID #562

“affirmative defense” (Id.) Perhaps that is its most common use in the reported cases but there is
nothing in the broad statutory language that would so limit it.
Section (a) states that “all” gambling contracts, “where the whole or any part of the
consideration thereof is for any money or thing of value, won or obtained in violation of any
Section of this Article are null and void.
Section (b) stands in complete opposition to the Defendants’ position. It states that “Any
obligation void under this section may be set aside and vacated by any court of competent
jurisdiction, upon a complaint filed for that purpose, by the person … entering into, or executing
same…”
The most important rule of statutory construction is the language of the statute. Here,
especially at section (b) the explicit statutory language supports the right of a person, such as
Casey Sonnenberg, who has “entered into” an illegal gambling contract to file a complaint for
the purpose of holding those contracts null and void. That is precisely what Casey Sonnenberg
has done, both for himself individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated victims of
the Defendants illegal schemes.
If the legislature intended this section to be limited to an “affirmative defense” it clearly
knows how to do so. But that is not the language the legislature employed. It chose broad
language which made this provision applicable to undo all illegal gambling contracts, any
“money or thing of value won an obtained in violation of any Section of this Article are null and
void.” 720 ILCS 5/28-7(b). Emphasis Supplied.
Actually, in light of the fact that this section applies to any violation of any section of
Article 28, it stands as the explicit grant to pursue a civil remedy, regardless of any “implied”

15

Case 3:13-cv-00344-DRH-SCW Document 79 Filed 06/19/14 Page 16 of 18 Page ID #563

right. Of course, unlike the next section, 28-8, seemingly only the actual loser can pursue a
remedy under this section which is why Casey filed his own action.
The Defendants argument that Section 28-7 can only be used as an affirmative defense
and not the basis of a suit for damages because the next section, the Loss Recovery Act Section
28-8, provides for a civil recovery is without merit. (Defendant’s Memorandum paragraph 14)
Again, such an argument is belied by explicit statutory language. Moreover, section 28-8, the
Loss Recovery Act permits “any person” to sue to recover gambling losses if the actual loser
does not. This demonstrates that the legislature was so intent upon providing a civil remedy to
victims of illegal gambling that they permitted actual losers under Section 28-7 to sue to declare
an illegal gambling contract null and void and if that right went unexercised, then under Section
28-8 “any person” could bring such a suit.
Likewise, the defense assertion that Section 28-7 applies only to “existing obligations”
(Defendants Memorandum, p. 14) is belied by explicit statutory language. Again, the term
“existing obligations” does not appear in the statute and surely the legislature could have used
the term if it intended to so limit the remedy it did provide. If the term “existing obligations” is
given its ordinary meaning, i.e. an obligation not yet satisfied, then clearly the statute rejects
such an approach.
Section 28-7(a), by express terms, renders gambling contracts void even if the
“obligation” is no longer “existing.” It uses the past tense numerous times. “(a) All promises,
notes, bills, bonds, covenants, contracts, made, given, drawn, or entered into, or executed, by any
person whatsoever, … won or obtained in violation of any section of this Article are null and
void.” 720 ILCS 5/28-7(a).

Because of their illegal gambling activities, the Defendants “won” or “obtained” losses
from Casey Sonnenberg and others similarly situated. In accord with the remedy provided by
Section 28-7, the Plaintiff class seeks to undo those losses by having this Court declare the
“conveyances made, given, drawn, or entered into, or executed” by the Plaintiff class to be “null
and void.”
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein, the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
