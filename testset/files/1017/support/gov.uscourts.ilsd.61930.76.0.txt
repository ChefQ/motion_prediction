DEFENDANTS' MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTON TO
DISMISS SECOND-AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

In its March 14, 2014 Order, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint
because (1) it failed to plead facts sufficient to allege that Defendants Rational Entertainment
Enterprises Ltd. ("REEL") and Oldford Group Ltd. ("Oldford") are "winners" within the
meaning of the Illinois Loss Recovery Act ("LRA") and (2) it failed sufficiently to put
Defendants on notice of the specific "losers" or "losses" that allegedly give rise to this action.
The Court granted leave to amend, but in their Second Amended Complaint ("SAC"), Plaintiffs
have added nothing that addresses these fundamental flaws. First, Plaintiffs have not, and

cannot, plead that Defendants are "winners" within the meaning of the LRA. Plaintiffs still fail

{M0227844.1}
to make any allegation that Defendants placed any bets or wagers, won any bets or wagers, or
otherwise participated in the online poker games they hosted. Rather, in the SAC, Plaintiffs
merely reinforce the conclusion that these Defendants were simply operators of an online
cardroom and, therefore, as this Court previously found, more akin to a third-party service
provider. Second, Plaintiffs still fail to plead the "who," "what," or "when" of the losses they
seek to recover. Although Casey Sonnenberg is identified as an alleged "loser," Plaintiffs fail to
plead, in any detail, the specifics of his alleged loss. Third, as a result of these pleading failures,
neither Kelly Sonnenberg nor Casey Sonnenberg can recover on behalf of a purported class of
unidentified losers with unspecified losses.

For these reasons, and guided by the instructive reasoning of the court in Langone vy.
Kaisser and FanDuel, Inc., Case No. 1:12-cv-02073 (N.D. IL. Oct. 9, 2013), the Court should
dismiss the Second Amended Complaint - Plaintiffs' third attempt to state a claim against these
Defendants - and do so with prejudice.

STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS
Allegations Relating to Plaintiffs

Plaintiffs' SAC inexplicably seeks to assert recovery by two separate plaintiffs on behalf
of the same group of alleged losers and losses. With respect to Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg, the
SAC alleges that she "is a natural person and an adult resident of St. Clair County, Illinois" and
"the mother of plaintiff Casey Sonnenberg." Pl. SAC at 0x00A75. As for Plaintiff Casey Sonnenberg,
the SAC alleges that he "is a natural person and an adult resident of St. Clair, County Illinois,"
and the "son of plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg." /d at (6. Without providing any further detail, the
SAC merely alleges that "Casey Sonnenberg had an account with PokerStars and has lost money

amounting to a sum of $50.00 or more to the Defendants." Jd.
Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg purports to bring this action individually and on behalf of
"any person" under the LRA, 720 ILCS 5/28-8.' See id. at 141; Count I (4957-64); Count V
({91-98); and Count IX (4125-132). Plaintiff Casey Sonnenberg purports to bring this action
individually, in his capacity as a "loser" and on behalf of a "loser" class. See id. at {49; Counts
N-TV; VI-VII; X-XII. However, while Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg claims that her entitlement to
recovery arises under 720 ILCS 5/28-8, Plaintiff Casey Sonnenberg claims that his entitlement to
recovery arises under 720 ILCS 5/28-1, 720 ILCS 5/28-3, and 720 ILCS 5/28-7. See id. Despite
asserting separate claims for relief, in fact, both Plaintiffs seek the same recovery - i.e. "all
money lost by Illinois gamblers on PokerStars." See id. at {41 (Kelly Sonnenberg); 0x00A749 (Casey
Sonnenberg).
Allegations Relating to the Defendants

Plaintiffs allege scarcely any facts regarding the Defendants individually. With respect to
Defendant REEL, the SAC alleges that Defendant REEL "`is a business entity organized and
operating under the laws of the Isle of Man" and "is licensed by the Isle of Man Gaming
Authority to operate online poker rooms and accept losses from Illinois gamblers." Jd. at euro7. As
for Defendant Oldford, the SAC alleges that it "is a business entity organized under the laws of
the British Virgin Islands" and "a parent company of the other defendants." Jd at {8, The SAC
further alleges that Defendants REEL and Oldford "acted in concert in a joint venture to
facilitate, host, operate, and profit from an online poker business commonly known as

Pokerstars." Jd. at 99.

 

' Although purporting to bring this action on behalf of "any person," Ms. Sonnenberg's
underlying class is the same as Casey Sonnenberg's underlying class in that both seek to
represent so-called PokerStars "losers." See Pl. SAC at0x00A741 ("The class sought to be certified is:
Those individuals who lost an amount of $50.00 or more on Pokerstars, excluding those
individuals who have previously brought an action against any Defendant to recover their losses
under the Illinois Loss Recovery Act, 720 ILCS 5/28-8.").

Apart from these allegations, Defendants REEL and Oldford are not mentioned directly
by name in any of the other factual allegations. The only other time they are mentioned by name
is in the individual counts, which repeat, almost verbatim, the same causes of action as to each
defendant. The remaining allegations of the SAC referring to the Defendants' business
conclusively underscore the fact that Defendants were merely operators of an online poker room,
acting as a conduit for transmission of the prize money to the winner. See, e.g, id. at 0x00A724
(alleging that Defendants "host[ed]" games); 0x00A726 (alleging that Defendants "designed and
provided proprietary software"); 0x00A740 (alleging that Defendants "establish[ed], own[ed],
operat[ed], finance[ed], promotjed] and/or profit[ed]" from transactions occurring on the games
that they hosted).

Here, even under the most liberal pleading standards, Plaintiffs fail to plead facially
plausible claims for relief under the LRA.

ARGUMENT

This Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' SAC in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule
12(b)(6) because, despite the additional opportunity to amend their complaints, Plaintiffs have
still failed to state claims for relief against these Defendants.' Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

8(a)(2) imposes "two easy-to-clear hurdles" that a complaint must satisfy in order to survive a

 

* Defendants also maintain that the SAC should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(2)
because Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts with respect to each individual Defendant that would
confer personal jurisdiction over them in this Court. See Wysnoski v. Millet, 759 F. Supp. 439,
442 (N.D. fll. 1991) (finding that, where there are multiple defendants, personal jurisdiction as to
each must be considered separately)\(citing Rush v. Savehuk, 444 U.S. 320, 332 (1980) and
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297-99 (1980)). Defendants also
incorporate by reference their arguments in support of dismissal raised in their Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiff's First-Amended Complaint - specifically, that the complaint should be
dismissed as a matter of equity because Plaintiff seek to pursue a claim that would require the
PokerStars group of companies to pay the same monies they already forfeited to the United
States Government a second time. See Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. #10].

Cir. 2008) (quoting EEOC v. Concentra Health Sves., Inc., 496 F.3d 773, 776 (7th Cir. 2007)).
Plaintiffs have failed to clear these hurdles.

First, the SAC does not describe the plaintiff's claims and the grounds supporting them in
"sufficient detail to give the defendants fair notice" of the claims alleged against them. EEOC,
496 F.3d at 776. This requires more than mere "labels and conclusions" or a "formulaic
recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,
545 (2007). This "standard demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-
harmed-me accusation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Second, the SAC does not
include well-pleaded allegations that, if true, "plausibly suggest a right to relief, raising that
possibility above a speculative level." EEOC, 496 F.3d at 776. "A claim has facial plausibility
when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference
that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Mann v. Vogel, 707 F.3d 872, 877 (7th
Cir. 2013) (quoting gbal, 556 U.S. at 679). "Accordingly, a motion to dismiss may be properly
granted where the plaintiff does not allege a plausible entitlement to relief either by (1) failing to
provide the defendant with notice of plausible claims against it or (2) asserting only speculative
or conclusory allegations in the complaint." See March 14, 2014 Order Dismissing Sonnenberg
First-Amended Complaint ("March 14 Order") [Dkt. #68] at p. 9, attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

It bears further notice that Illinois courts have long held that the "Loss Recovery Act
should not be interpreted to yield an unjust or absurd result contrary to its purpose." Vinson v.
Casino Queen, Inc., 123 F.3d 655, 657 (7th Cir. 1997). Illinois statutes like the LRA are "penal
in their nature," Robson y, Doyle, 61 N.E. 435, 437 (ill. 1901), and "must be strictly construed."

See Phillips v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 714 F.3d 1017, 1023 (7th Cir. 2013); see also Reuter
v. MasterCard Int'l, Inc., 921 N.E.2d 1205, 1211 (IIL App. 2010) (nothing that an Hlinois Circuit
Court "explained that the [LRA] is penal in nature and must therefore be strictly construed").

Given that Plaintiffs' SAC fails the simple requirements that the law imposes - again -
the Court should dismiss it with prejudice.

I. Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg Has Failed to State a Claim for Relief Under 720
ILCS 5/28-8,

In Counts I, X, and [X of the SAC, Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg seeks to recover gambling
losses as "any person" under the 720 ILCS 5/28-8.0x00B0 However, Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg has
failed to plead facts sufficient to state a claim for relief pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6).

Despite this Court's explicit instructions in its March 14 Order, Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg fails

person, any sum of money or thing of value, amounting
to the sum of $50 or more and shall pay or deliver the

720 ILCS 5/28-8.
to plead facts sufficient to allege that Defendants are "winners" within the meaning of the LRA
and to put Defendants on notice of the specific losers or losses that would entitle her to recovery.

A. PokerStars is Not a "Winner" Within the Meaning of the LRA.

In dismissing Ms. Sonnenberg's First-Amended Complaint, this Court found that Plaintiff
had not pled that PokerStars is a "winner" within the meaning of the LRA. See Ex. 1, March 14
Order at p. 11. In so finding, the Court noted certain glaring omissions in the allegations of the
First Amended Complaint. Specifically, the Court noted that the First Amended Complaint
"[did] not state that the PokerStars defendants made any bets or wagers and [did] not state that
PokerStars won any bets or wagers that would qualify under the statute as `winners.'" Jd at
p.10. The Court also stressed the lack of any allegation that the PokerStars Defendants
"participat[ed] in the games itself" or "risk[ed] any of its money in producing the prize money to
the winner." /d. at p.i1. Accordingly, this Court, guided by the "valid and instructive"
reasoning of the Langone court, found that the "PokerStars Group is more akin to a third party
service provider that provides a forum for others to play the game and does not have a stake in
how the game is decided." /d. at p. 11, 10. Put differently, "the PokerStars Group acted as a
conduit for transmission of the prize money to the winner and it did not risk any of its money in
producing the prize money to the winner." /d. at p.11.

Nothing in the SAC should change the Court's evaluation or the result here. Plaintiffs
still have not pleaded facts sufficient to demonstrate that the Defendants are "winners" under the
statute. There are no allegations that the Defendants participated in the games by placing bets or
wagers, winning bets or wagers, or risking any of their own money. And the reason is obvious:
Defendants are merely operators of an online poker room, and not participants in the underlying

games they host, and therefore are "more akin to a third-party service provider." Indeed, the
allegations of the SAC reinforce this conclusion through repeated allegations that the Defendants
owned and operated an online poker website that hosted poker games. See, e.g., Pl. SAC at 424
(alleging that Defendants "host{ed]" games); 926 (alleging that Defendants "designed and
provided proprietary software"); 940 (alleging that Defendants "establishfed], own[ed],
operat[ed], finance[ed], promot{ed] and/or profit[ed]" from transactions occurring on the games
that they hosted). Indeed, even Plaintiffs admit that "unknown individuals won money from
Illinois gamblers during the poker games hosted by the Defendants" - an allegation at odds with
their otherwise conclusory, and wholly unsupported, claim that PokerStars, the host of these
games, could have "won" the monies at issue. See id. at 937.

The only new addition to Plaintiffs' SAC is the conclusory allegation that PokerStars
won money in the form of the "rake," "takeout," or "commission on the games they hosted." See
id. at (924, 35, 37. These allegations are simply insufficient, In Langone, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Wlinois dismissed a similar case against a fantasy sports site
(FanDuel.com), finding that the site and its owner were not "winners" within the meaning of the
LRA even though the site charged an entry fee or commission from its players. See generally
Langone Order at p.2, attached hereto as Exhibit 2, Although the site admittedly derived its
profit from commissions, the court rejected the notion that the site was a "winner" under the
LRA because plaintiff did not allege that the site participated in the game itself or placed any
"wagers" with particular participants "by which it could lose money based on the happening of a
future event." fd. at pp.13-14.

Similarly, in this case, the assertion that the Defendants derived their profits from
collecting commissions in the form of a "rake" or "take out" (neither of which is defined in the

SAC) is not probative of whether or not the Defendants can be construed to be "winners."
Plaintiffs notably make no assertion that Defendants risked anything when taking their
commissions (and indeed they cannot make such an allegation). For this reason, Counts I, V,
and IX of the SAC should be dismissed for failure to plead facts sufficient to demonstrate that
Defendants are "winners" within the meaning of the LRA.

B. Plaintiffs Fail to Identify a Loser or Loss.

This Court previously dismissed the First-Amended Complaint because Plaintiffs had
failed to identify specific losers or losses. Specifically, the Court found that Ms. Sonnenberg's
First-Amended Complaint did not adequately allege a "loser" or "loss," noting that "the first
amended complaint is devoid of allegations stating the "who" "what" and "when" of the losses
she seeks to recover." See Ex. 1, March 14 Order at pp. 11-12.

Plaintiffs' SAC is similarly lacking this basic factual predicate necessary to support a
third-party claim under 720 ILCS 5/28-8(b). Other than identifying her son Casey Sonnenberg,
as a purported loser, Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg fails to identify a single cognizable loser or loss.
Rather, Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg simply asserts: "Numerous Illinois residents, including
Plaintiff Casey Sonnenberg, have lost an amount more than $50.00 dollars while gambling with
Pokerstars and for the purposes of 720 ILCS 5/28-8 are `losers.'" Pl. SAC at 459. This Court
has already held that such conclusory allegations are insufficient.' Even as to Casey
Sonnenberg, the only identified "loser," Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg fails to plead basic facts,
including: when the purported loss was incurred,' to whom (i.e. which player) the loss was

sustained, and what is the amount of loss in question. Given Plaintiffs' failure to identify a

 

" Indeed, the Langone court dismissed a similar complaint where the plaintiff alleged that "it is
more likely than not that [plaintiff] has lost over $50." See Ex. 2, Langone Order at p. 3.

* The mere allegation that "Casey Sonnenberg did not bring an action on his own behalf within
six months of any loss to PokerStars" is insufficient for these purposes. See Pl. SAC at 961.

-g-
single, quantifiable loss associated with any specific loser, Plaintiff cannot even demonstrate that
any loser would satisfy the LRA's jurisdictional minimum.

The Court should reject any suggestion that Plaintiffs may rely on such conclusory
allegations in a complaint with the hope of later identifying specific losers and losses. Indeed,
the Langone court rejected the assertion that a plaintiff was permitted to plead unidentified
gambling losers and losses under the LRA. See Ex, 2, Langone Order at pp. 10-11. Notably, the
court found that such penal statutes are strictly construed, and, as such, reject a plaintiff's attempt
"to compel the [winner] to disclose a cause of action against himself," as such an attempt
amounts to "purely a fishing bill so far as it seeks such discovery." Jd. at p. 12 (citing Rodson v.
Doyle, 61 N.E. 435, 436-37 (Hl. 1901)). As in Langone, the Plaintiffs in this case cannot satisfy
the basic pleading requirements of the LRA without compelling the Defendants to disclose
information against themselves in order to aid in Plaintiffs' fishing expedition.(R) Accordingly,
Plaintiffs' SAC should be dismissed with prejudice.

C. Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg Cannot Recover Individually or on Behalf of a
Purported Class of "Any Persons" Under the LRA.

Plaintiffs' pleading failures warrant dismissal of Plaintiff Kelly Sonennberg's claim to
recovery individually and on behalf of an "any person" class. See generally Pl. SAC at Counts L,
X, and [X. First, Plaintiff Kelly Sonnenberg cannot recover individually as "any person" under
the LRA because she has failed to plead basic facts relating to her son, Casey Sonnenberg's,
purported losses. In Langone, the court reasoned that there was an "express link" between a

loser's right to recovery under subsection (a) of the LRA and a third-party's right to recovery

 

0x00B0 Indeed, Plaintiffs admit in their SAC that discovery is required to plead their case. See id. at
442 (While the exact number of Class members is unknown to Plaintiff at this time, and can
only be ascertained through appropriate discovery, Plaintiff believes that there are thousands of
Hlinois poker players who lost money to PokerStars.")
