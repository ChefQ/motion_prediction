-2August 9, 2006:
Although not altogether clear, defendants appear to base their motion to dismiss on the
order issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on June 1, 2006, which
was entered on the docket in this matter at Dkt. # 66. In that order, the Court of Appeals stated
that it did not have jurisdiction over defendants’ interlocutory appeal. Defendants apparently
conclude that, because the Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction over defendants’
interlocutory appeal, then this District Court must not have jurisdiction over the instant civil
action. However, it is clear that the Court of Appeals did not rule on the District Court’s
jurisdiction over this matter, and it does not follow that a denial of an interlocutory appeal
necessitates dismissal of an action for lack of jurisdiction.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss is, in all other respects, entirely incomprehensible.
Defendants have not established any legal or factual basis for the dismissal of the instant action;
thus, the United States respectfully requests that the defendants’ motion to dismiss be denied.
Dated this 22nd day of August, 2006.
Respectfully Submitted,
DEBORAH M. SMITH
Acting United States Attorney
