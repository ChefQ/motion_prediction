A05-123-CV (RRB)
Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice
Come now Donald Louis Hymes and Rita MariNa
Hymes ("Hymes") with this Motion to Dismiss with prejudice.
Hymes have relied upon the adjudged decision of Levins
v. Rovegno, 12 P. 161, 162-64 , `an ultimate fact is deduced
from probative facts by a process of natural reasoning'.

The inference or conclusion of law is by a process of

LD
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 ~ Filed 08/09/2006 Page 2of9

artificial reasoning. The evidentiary facts become the
premises and the ultimate fact the conclusion.

Ibid at 163, "A presumption of fact is the natural
connection of one fact with another by a combined process of
proof and argument, while a presumption of law is a similar
connection, artificially made by annexing a rule of law or
legal incident to a particular fact proved. * * * . .. are
all facts; and whether their existence or non-existence is
reached by a process of natural reasoning, or by artificial
process known as a `conclusion of law' does not in the least
alter their status as facts."

Hymes have relied upon the adjudged decision as held
in People ex rel. v. Sexton et al., 444 N.Y.S.2d 884, 885
(Sup. Ct. NY County 1943). There are only two kinds of
facts. These are ultimate facts and evidentiary facts.
Ultimate facts are essential for any determination or
decision by the court, and evidentiary facts are necessary
to prove essential or ultimate facts. See also Perales v.
Braslau's Furniture Co., 493 S.W.2d 638, 640 (Ct. of App.
Tex. 1973); Wichita Falls & Oklahoma Ry. Co. v. Pepper, 135
S.W.2d 79, 84 (Sup. Ct. Tex. 1940).

Hymes filed an interlocutory appeal to the Circuit
Court of the United State for the 9% Circuit ("9% Cir.) on
important issues of law concerning many of the ultimate

facts of Judge Ralph R. Beistline's ("Beistline") ORDER at
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 ~ Filed 08/09/2006 Page3of9

Docket 43, ("Doe. 43 ORDER") including, but not limited to
*whether the "United States" and the "United States of
America" exist individually,
*does the "'United States of America' have constitutionally
granted powers",
and
*Hymes' Motion to Clarify ("Doc. 42 Motion"), submitting
ultimate facts, to have Beistline perform his purported
Powers to declare the Law arising under Article III in all
Cases in Law and Equity, exercising the judicial Power of
the United States under the Authority of the United States
within the several States and under the holding of adjudged
decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in
Marbury v Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), "[i]lt is
emphatically the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is." |
Beistline refused to declare what Law of the United
States, arising under Article VI, is or might have
application to Hymes on what Return and_ substantive
regulations have the force and effect of Law in 26 U.S.C. 8
6011, in which Hymes have presented the Law and substantive
regulations in the Doc. 42 Motion.

The 9%" Cir. Denial ("Doe. 66 Denial") proffered the

ultimate fact that "the court lacks jurisdiction over this

 

interlocutory appeal", which includes all of the ultimate

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 ~~ Filed 08/09/2006 Page 4of9

facts presented by Hymes.

If the correct Plaintiff to this instant case can't be
identified, be it the "United States" or the "United States
of America", it follows a fortiori there is no Case.

If no Law of the United States can be identified as
being an essential element of any Case of this Class, it
follows a fortiori, there is no Case.

If the parties of "United States" or the "United
States" can't be identified a fortiori there is no moving
party in this Case.

If the 90x00B0 Cir. does not have jurisdiction over the
ultimate facts presented on the Interlocutory Appeal it
follows a fortiori the USDC lacks jurisdiction over this
instant Case and this Case must be dismissed.

The USDC and 9% Cir. applied to Hymes the status of
being a "citizen of the United States" ("citizen of the US")
(5 U.S.C. B 552a(2) & (13)) means an "Individual"
irrevocably conflated with all of the following essential
elements being a citizen of the US, which are; the Social
Security Act ("SSA") at 49 Stat. 620 as amended with the
required Social Security Number ("SSN"); the IRS in 49 Stat
620 Titles VIII & IX; and, the denial of access to the
Courts in 42 U.S.C. 8 405(g) & (h); and, 26 U.S.C. 8 6109(a)
the Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") shall be the SSN;

and, the Form 1040 (OMB 1545-0074) with the mandatory use of
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 ~~ Filed 08/09/2006 Page5of9

the SSN; and, when rights are created against the United
States for Individuals (SSA - federal benefits); 26 U.S.C. &
6011 the requirement of the Form 1040 (OMB-1545-0074) with a
Mandatory SSN; and, the Driver License and Passport in 42
U.S.C. & 666(13); and then, Congress can by statute for
citizens of the US, deny access to all courts of the United
States and even a remedy for rights created (federal
benefits - SSA) against the United States for Individuals as
held in U.S. v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 331(1919), Dismuke v.
U.S., 297 U.S. 167, %171-72(1936), Garza v. Chater, 891
F.Supp. 464, 466-67 (N.D. Ill 1995) and Alien v. Graham,
446 P.2d 240, 243-44 (Ct. App. Ariz. 1968)

The administrative issue of the Ultimate Fact "Taxpayer
Status Determination" of Donald Louis Hymes as a "taxpayer",
is posited only in 26 CFR 601.201 under the statutory
authority of 5 U.S.C. BR 301 & 552 with the IRS employees
sitting as a Court of Errors of the decisions of the USDC
and 9*0x00B0 Cir., divesting USDC and the 9% Cir. of cognizance
of this Class of Case arising under Article III of all Cases
in Law and Equity, exercising the judicial Power of. the
United States under the Authority of the United States in
the several States. See Hayburn's case, 2 U.S. 408, U.S. v.
Ferreira, 54 U.S. 40, U.S. v. Todd, 54 U.S. 52, Muskrat v.
U.S., 219 U.S. 346, Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514

U.S. 211 and Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1.
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 ~~ Filed 08/09/2006 Page6of9

From exclusive ultimate fact taxpayer status
determination, posited only in & 601.201 of who is a
"taxpayer", flows a fortiori, no court of the United States
has cognizance of this Class of Case arising under Article
IIl.

Under the unambiguous language of 5 U.S.C. & 552(a)
acknowledged by the IRS in 26 CFR 8 601.702(a), the IRS is
to publish all regulations in the Federal Register and then
in 26 CFRs "Substantive rules of general applicability
adopted as authorized by law." If not published, ibid
"shall not adversely change or affect a person's rights."
There are three types of regulations in 8% 601.701 pronounced
by the IRS, being: "part 601(Statement of Procedural
Rules)"; and, "part 301 of this chapter (Procedure and
Administration Regulations)"; and, "various substantive
regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, such as
the regulations in part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax
Regulations), in part 20 of this chapter (Estate
Regulations), and in part 31 of this chapter (Employment Tax
Regulations)." [Emphasis added]

Of these three types of regulations in the CFRs, only
"substantive regulations" have the "force and effect of law"
under the statutory authority of Congress and published
under the procedural requirements imposed by Congress as

held in Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 282-83
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 ~ Filed 08/09/2006 Page 7 of9

(1979).

There are three tables in the CFRs for substantive
regulations composed of "part 1", "part 20" and "part 31."
The substantive regulations for part 1 (Individual Income
Taxes) are located in Title 26 CFRS at C.F.R. T. 26, Ch. I,
Subch. A, Pt. 1 (Pt. 20 & Pt. 31). Hymes supplied all of
the substantive regulations of 26 U.S.C. & 6011 to Beistline
in the Doc. 42 Motion, to have Beistline declare the law.
Beistline DENIED in total.

It is mandatory for the IRS to follow its own self-imposed
regulations and this requirement was not met by the agency
after Donald Louis Hymes requested a taxpayer status
determination to be made. The 8 601.201 regulation
establishes unambiguously that the agency is to make said
determinations of who are "taxpayers." The IRS and its
employees are bound to the regulations and the courts shall
enforce them, see U.S. v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 696 (1974);
Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 368(1957); Associated Builders
v. U.S. DOE, 451 U.S. 287(1978). The agency is to "be held
to strict compliance with their own regulations and rules of
procedure," Associated Builders at 288, and the agency
egregiously violated & 601.201 as the taxpayer PLR has not
been preformed. The IRS, failed to comply with its own
rules and violated its self-imposed obligation to create the

"taxpayer" determination status PLR, see Lyng v. Payne, 476
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document75 Filed 08/09/2006 Page 8of9

U.S. 926, 938 (1986). Therefore, the term "taxpayer" as it
relates to Hymes has no effect in law. Lex non cogit ad
impossibilia.

Therefore, this instant Case must be DISMISSED WITH

PREJUDICE.
