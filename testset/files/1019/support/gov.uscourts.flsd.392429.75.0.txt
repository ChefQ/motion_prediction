UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
WEST PALM BEACH DIVISION
Case No. 11-81404-CIV-SEITZ/SIMONTON
COUPLING SOLUTIONS, LLC, a business
entity organized under the Laws of the State of
Florida,
Plaintiff,
vs.
PAUL ANTHONY DAVIDSON,
Defendant.

MOTION TO STRIKE PLEADINGS AND ENTER DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT
FOR FAILURE TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDIATION
Plaintiff Coupling Solutions, LLC, through counsel, moves this Court to strike Defendant
Paul Davidson’s (“Defendant”) pleadings and enter a default against him for his refusal to
participate in mediation, and in support thereof states as follows:
1.

Southern District of Florida Local Rule 16.2(d)(1) specifies that all civil cases

(except those listed in Local Rule 16.2(c)) shall be referred to mediation. Accordingly, on April
11, 2012, this Court entered an Order requiring the parties to conduct mediation by October 5,
2012. (Dkt. No. 49). This Order further required the parties to agree on a mediator and file a
Notice of Selection of Mediator within fourteen (14) days from the date of the Order, and submit
a proposed order scheduling mediation within sixty (60) days. (Dkt. No. 49).
2.

On April 25, 2012, Defendant’s then-counsel proposed Attorney Harry R. Schafer

as the potential mediator, and the Notice of Selection of Mediator was timely filed on the same

Case 9:11-cv-81404-PAS Document 75 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/29/2012 Page 2 of 6

day. (Exhibit A; Dkt. No. 54). Likewise, on May 24, 2012, Defendant’s counsel agreed to hold
mediation on September 6, 2012. (Exhibit B).
3.

On June 4, 2012, Defendant’s counsel informed Plaintiff that it would be moving

to withdraw from the case, and that Defendant was going to proceed pro se. Shortly thereafter,
on June 5, 2012, Defendant’s counsel moved to withdraw, stating in its motion that Defendant
had been advised of his mediation obligations. (Dkt. No. 63). The same day, Plaintiff also
submitted the previously agreed to proposed order scheduling mediation.
4.

Also on June 5, 2012, this Court entered an “Order of Instructions to Pro se

Litigant” that summarized the rules Defendant was to follow, including the Local Rules for the
Southern District of Florida. (Dkt. No. 59). The Court cautioned Defendant that his failure to
comply with the federal and local rules may result in sanctions.
5.

On June 6, 2012, this Court entered the parties’ proposed order scheduling

mediation to occur before Harry R. Schafer on September 6, 2012. (Dkt. No. 62). On June 7,
2012, this Court granted Defendant’s counsel’s motion to withdraw. (Dkt. No. 64).
6.

On August 21, 2012, the mediator’s office contacted both parties to remind them

of the mediation and the deadline for the mediation statements, at which point Defendant stated
that he did not want to mediate the case and objected to the very mediator his counsel had
suggested. (Exhibit C). Defendant then apparently called the mediator’s office and repeated that
he had no intention of attending the mediation, despite the fact that both his previous counsel and
the mediator’s office had informed him that the mediation was ordered by the Court. (Exhibit C).
Defendant subsequently wrote a threatening email1 to Plaintiff’s counsel stating, among other
things, that “THE MEADIATION [sic] HAS BEEN CANCELLED ………….. ‘WHATS [sic]
1

Defendant has threatened the undersigned counsel and law firm with “reporting” to the Florida Bar, and has further
threatened to turn over his collection of emails to the police, accusing Plaintiff of some form of undefined criminal
conduct.

Case 9:11-cv-81404-PAS Document 75 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/29/2012 Page 3 of 6

NEXT.’” (Exhibit D). Defendant is also refusing to be deposed, a point which Plaintiff is
currently taking up with Magistrate Simonton. (Exhibit D). Defendant’s willful refusal to
comply with this Court’s mediation Order is not his first refusal to follow Court rules. On
August 22, 2012, this Court issued an Order to Defendant warning him that if he “continues to
ignore Court Orders, the Court will strike Defendant’s Answer and Affirmative Defenses and
Enter a default against Defendant.” (Dkt. No. 74).
7.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16, the Court may strike pleadings in

whole or in part and /or enter a default judgment if a party fails to obey a scheduling or other
pretrial order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(1)(c). The Court may impose monetary sanctions for the
purpose of punishing the parties for egregious behavior. See Morris v. Buena Vista Corp., 2011
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49836, *3 (M.D. Fla. May 10, 2011).
8.

Failure to attend mediation in violation of a Court’s Orders has been held to

justify entry of a default judgment against an uncooperative party. See Morris v. Buena Vista
Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49831, **1-2 (M.D. Fla. March 31, 2011) magistrate report
adopted by Morris v. Buena Vista Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49836, * 3 (M.D. Fla. May 10,
2011).

Indeed, it has been held that “even a non-lawyer should realize the peril to her case,

when []he . . . ignores numerous notices, and fails to attend hearings and depositions. Even a
non-lawyer should realize the need to communicate either with the court or with opposing
counsel.” In Re: Sunshine Jr. Stores, Inc., 456 F.3d 1291, 1307 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing Anthony
v. Marion County Gen. Hosp., 617 F.2d 1164, 1169 (5th Cir. 1980); see also Moon v. Newsome,
863 F.2d 835, 838 n.5 (11th Cir. 1989)).
9.

In this case, Defendant has ignored at least four (4) Court Orders, two regarding

selecting the mediator and scheduling the mediation (Dkt. Nos. 49 and 62) and two ordering him

Case 9:11-cv-81404-PAS Document 75 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/29/2012 Page 4 of 6

to follow this Court’s rules (Dkt. Nos. 59 and 74). Defendant has flatly refused to participate in
mediation, as well as to schedule a deposition. Plaintiff seeks sanctions for Defendant’s refusal
to abide by this Court’s Orders. “It is not the court’s function to drag a party kicking and
screaming through discovery.” Telectron, Inc. v. Overhead Door Corp., 116 F.R.D. 107, 134
citing Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 102 F.R.D. 472, 489 (S.D. Fla. 1984) aff’d in part, rev’d
in part, 775 F.2d 1440 (11th Cir. 1985). Plaintiff contends that the conduct of Defendant
evidences a desire to simply harass, accuse, and intimidate others, but all the while refusing to
engage in the process, frustrating and delaying discovery. If Defendant has no respect for this
Court’s Orders or the Rules of the Court, this matter cannot be resolved fairly, justly and timely.
As such, the only appropriate remedy is to strike Defendant’s pleadings and enter default.
RELIEF SOUGHT
Given Defendant’s failure to follow the rules of this Court, Plaintiff seeks an Order:
a.
b.
c.

Entering default and ultimately judgment in favor of Plaintiff;
Awarding attorneys’ fees in an amount to be determined; and
Such other relief as this court deems just.
RULE 7.1(a)(3) CERTIFICATE

The undersigned counsel has made reasonable efforts to confer with Defendant in a good
faith effort to resolve the issues raised in this motion and has been unable to do so, as evidenced
by Exhibit D.
