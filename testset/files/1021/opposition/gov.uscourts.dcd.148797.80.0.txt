OUTSIDE DIRECTOR-DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTIONS FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINT
AND/OR TO AMEND THE JUDGMENT
Defendants Robert Allardice, H. Jay Sarles, and John Loveridge (the “Outside
Directors”) submit this memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion For Leave To File
Amended Consolidated Complaint And/Or To Amend The Judgment. No. 1:11-cv-01142, ECF
No. 75; No. 1:11-cv-02287, ECF No. 32.

The Outside Directors join in the arguments made by the Carlyle Defendants in their
separate memorandum (“CD Opp.”), which are incorporated by reference. We write separately
to underscore the glaring and dispositive procedural flaws in Plaintiffs’ motion.
ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs present two separate motions, seeking alternative forms of relief: First, and
principally, they contend that, under Rule 15(a), the Court should grant them leave to file yet
another amended complaint, because a plaintiff “should typically be afforded at least one
opportunity to amend his or her complaint” following a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. Pl. Mem. at 6.
Second, in the event their Rule 15(a) motion is denied, Plaintiffs invoke Rule 59(e) to amend
certain discrete portions of the Court’s judgment. Id. at 5.
The Court should reject both motions. Plaintiffs’ Rule 15(a) motion is precluded because
Plaintiffs have not challenged under Rule 59(e) the Court’s order dismissing the complaint with
prejudice—and any such challenge would be meritless in any event. Additionally, Plaintiffs’
Rule 59(e) attacks on “certain of the Court’s findings” in its Memorandum Opinion (Pl. Mem. at
1) are of no legal consequence. While Plaintiffs quarrel with some of the grounds on which the
Court rejected their claims, they do not challenge the Court’s holding with respect to loss
causation, which is an adequate and independent basis to support the judgment.
I.

PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO RELIEF UNDER RULE 15(a)
1.

Plaintiffs urge the Court to afford them another chance to amend their complaint

on the ground that such leave should be “freely given” under Rule 15(a). Pl. Mem. at 5. But
Plaintiffs confuse their burden—the Court has already denied Plaintiffs an opportunity to re-

Case 1:11-cv-01142-ABJ Document 80 Filed 10/04/12 Page 3 of 7

plead when it dismissed their complaint with prejudice.1 As a result, “the comparatively lenient
requirements for filing an amended pleading under Rule 15(a)” are “irrelevant to the threshold
question of whether the motion for leave to file an amended pleading should be considered in the
first instance.” Agrocomplect, AD v. Republic of Iraq, 262 F.R.D. 18, 21 (D.D.C. 2009).
Instead, the Court “cannot permit an amendment unless [Plaintiff] ‘first satisfies Rule 59(e)’s
more stringent standard’ for setting aside that judgment.’” Ciralsky v. C.I.A., 355 F.3d 661, 673
(D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996))
(alteration omitted; emphasis added); see Lightfoot v. Dist. of Columbia, 555 F. Supp. 2d 61, 66
(D.D.C. 2008) (“The viability of a plaintiff’s post-judgment Rule 15(a) motion [] initially
depends on the sustainability of the Rule 59(e) motion.”).
But Plaintiffs do not argue under Rule 59(e) that the Court committed clear error when it
dismissed their complaint with prejudice, as opposed to affording them leave to amend See
Firestone, 76 F.3d at 1208 (plaintiff “properly” moved under Rule 59(e) for an order that “the
dismissal of the original complaint with prejudice was erroneous”) (emphasis in original).
Rather, Plaintiffs invoke Rule 59(e) only for the distinct purpose of repeating certain arguments
as to why the complaint already on file is just fine. Because Plaintiffs have not moved under
Rule 59(e) to amend the Court’s order denying them leave to re-plead, their renewed request
under Rule 15(a) is procedurally barred. See Ciralsky, 355 F.3d at 673.
2.

Even if Plaintiffs had properly challenged the Court’s dismissal with prejudice,

their Rule 15(a) motion would nevertheless fail because the Court correctly refused leave to
amend on futility grounds. “Where a court determines that the assertion of additional facts

On page 86 of their Brief in Opposition to Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss, Plaintiffs
expressly requested “that they be afforded leave to file an amended complaint” in order to “cure
any defects.” No. 1:11-cv-01142, ECF No. 56. The Court rejected that request.

consistent with the challenged pleading would not remedy the deficiency, dismissal of a claim
with prejudice is appropriate.” Carty v. Author Solutions, Inc., 789 F. Supp. 2d 131, 136 (D.D.C.
2011). Here, the fundamental defects identified by the Court—including Plaintiffs’ failure,
despite repeated amendments, to identify any material misstatement or to plead loss causation—
could not be allayed through further pleading. See CD Opp. at 6-7 (citing In re XM Satellite
Radio Holdings Sec. Litig., 479 F. Supp. 2d 165, 187 (D.D.C. 2007); In re GlaxoSmithKline PLC
Sec. Litig., No. 05 Civ. 3751(LAP), 2006 WL 2871968, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 6, 2006)).2 The
Court therefore did not err (much less clearly so) in dismissing the complaint with prejudice. See
Jung v. Ass’n of Am. Med. Colleges, 226 F.R.D. 7, 9-10 (D.D.C. 2005).
Indeed, Plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint vividly illustrates the futility of any
further pleading. While Plaintiffs proffer “material amendments” that purport to “address all of
the four material defects found by the Court,” Pl. Mem. at 5, their proposed amended complaint
comes no closer to stating a claim than its predecessors. See CD Opp. at 15-30. Plaintiffs’
failure to cure those defects reinforces that the Court was correct to dismiss the complaint with
prejudice in the first instance, and likewise renders any error in refusing leave to amend harmless
as a matter of law. Cf. Colvin v. Caruso, 605 F.3d 282, 294-95 (6th Cir. 2010) (district court’s
abuse of discretion in denying motion to amend is harmless error where amendment would have
been futile).

2

By contrast, Plaintiffs’ claim under United Kingdom law (Count VI), was dismissed
without prejudice where the defect identified by the Court—the failure sufficiently to allege that
the United Kingdom was the “home state”—could theoretically be addressed through additional
pleading. Mem. Op. at 64.

II.

PLAINTIFFS’ LIMITED REQUESTS FOR RELIEF UNDER RULE 59(e) ARE
BOTH IRRELEVANT AND MERITLESS
As noted above, Plaintiffs invoke Rule 59(e), not to challenge the dismissal with

prejudice, but in support of their “additional and/or alternative” requests to amend certain aspects
of the Court’s opinion. Pl. Mem. at 5. The Court should not indulge those requests. First, and
most obviously, Plaintiffs’ narrow requests under Rule 59(e) are beside the point because
Plaintiffs do not challenge the Court’s holding with respect to loss causation. It is therefore
irrelevant whether Plaintiffs are correct on any (or all) of their Rule 59(e) arguments—it would
not change the outcome. Second, in any event, each of Plaintiffs’ arguments is baseless for the
numerous reasons explained by the Carlyle Defendants. See CD Opp. at 7-12.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, both of Plaintiffs’ motions should be denied.
