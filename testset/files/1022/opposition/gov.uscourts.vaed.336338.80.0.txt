PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGMENT RE FXF.COM

1

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 80 Filed 09/01/16 Page 2 of 8 PageID# 1428

The Plaintiff, Associated Recovery, LLC, opposes the Motion to Set Aside Default
Judgment Re FXF.COM as filed by Mr. Ye Yu.
I.

INTRODUCTION
Mr. Ye Yu was not the registrant (owner) of Defendant FXF.COM on December 28,

2016, when the Original Complaint was filed or any time thereafter. Accordingly, Mr. Ye Yu
has no standing to appear in this Court on behalf of the Defendant FXF.COM.
II.

BACKGROUND – DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATIONS
A domain name registrar is a commercial entity that manages the reservation of

Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) to register names through a generic
top-level domain (gTLD) registry such as VeriSign, Inc. and/or a country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) registry, and must enter into a Registrar Accreditation Agreement. See
https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en , attached as
Exhibit 1.
A Registered Name Holder (commonly referred to as “registrant” or “owner”) is the
person or entity that holds the right to use a specific domain name. The Registered Name
Holder can either be a person or an organization who is the domain name holder, legally bound
by the terms-of-service agreements with a registrar, as required by ICANN. See Id.
ICANN requires registrars to maintain a WHOIS database which contains various
information concerning each domain name including the name, email address and physical
address of the Registered Name Holder. ICANN requires registrars to make the WHOIS database
available for public search to lookup the information for each domain name. See Id. at Sec 3.3.
2

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 80 Filed 09/01/16 Page 3 of 8 PageID# 1429

ICANN also mandates that registrants “provide accurate information for publication in
directories such as WHOIS, and promptly update this to reflect any changes” within 15 days.
See Id. at Domain Name Registrants’ Responsibilities in paragraph 4 on pdf. page 69 of
Exhibit 1 and attached as Exhibit 2.
III.

ARGUMENT
A.

“Whoisguard, Inc.” Was the Registrant of FXF.COM -- Not Mr. Yu.

Mr. Ye Yu does not have standing to bring the motion to set aside the default of the
FXF.COM domain name because Mr. Ye Yu was not the registrant of the FXF.COM domain
name at any time during the pendency of this proceeding.
At the time that Associated Recovery filed its complaint on December 28, 2015, the
registrant of FXF.COM was “Whoisguard, Inc.” and the registrar was identified as eNom, Inc.
Specifically, on December 28, 2015, eNom’s WHOIS database identified the registrant of
FXF.COM as:
Registrant Organization: WHOISGUARD, INC.
Registrant Street: P.O. BOX 0823-03411
Registrant City: PANAMA
Registrant State/Province: PANAMA
Registrant Postal Code: 00000
Registrant Country: PA
Registrant Phone: +507.8365503
Registrant Phone Ext:
Registrant Fax: +51.17057182
Registrant Fax Ext:
Registrant Email:
15B93ABAFD0B47E787820FDA56E25280.PROTECT@WHOISGUARD.COM
(Dkt. 1, Exhibit 6.)
Notably, eNom, Inc., does not identify Mr. Ye Yu as having any association with
FXF.COM.
3

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 80 Filed 09/01/16 Page 4 of 8 PageID# 1430

Plaintiff sent notices sent to the Defendant FXF.COM sent in accordance with 15 U.S.C.
§1125(d)(2)(A)(ii)(II), which requires the Plaintiff to send notice to the registrant at the postal
and e-mail address provided by the registrant to the registrar.
Despite Mr. Ye Yu’s statements to the contrary, the e-mail address listed by eNom at the
time the Original Complaint was filed was:
15B93ABAFD0B47E787820FDA56E25280.PROTECT@WHOISGUARD.COM.
Notice of the filing of the Original Complaint was sent to the above referenced e-mail
address and to the physical address identified above. Associated Recovery received no response
to any of its notices. (Dkt. 1, PageID #260 at paragraphs 4 and 6.)
Pursuant to the Court’s Order Granting Default Judgment, the registrant/owner of the
FXF.COM domain name was changed from Whoisguard, Inc. to Associated Recover, LLC, visa-vis Verisign, Inc. Verisign, Inc., changed the registrar of record from eNom, Inc. to
Uniregistry, Inc. Uniregistry, Inc., is the registrar for Associated Recovery for the FXF.COM
domain name.
As noted, Mr. Ye Yu was not identified at the registrant of the FXF.COM domain name
at the time of the filing of the Original Complaint. If Mr. Ye Yu is a representative of
Whoisguard, Inc., Mr. Ye Yu would not have standing to file his motion on behalf of
Whoisguard, Inc., because Whoisguard, Inc., is a corporation. A corporation can only be
represented in this Court by an attorney at law and not a pro se defendant.
B.

Mr. Ye Yu’s Exhibits Are Defective

Mr. Ye Yu’s Exhibits 1 and 2 to his Memorandum are curious.

4

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 80 Filed 09/01/16 Page 5 of 8 PageID# 1431

Mr. Ye Yu’s Exhibit 1 purports to be a Purchase and Sale Agreement through Sedo
GmbH or Sedo LLC. This document is not executed and lacks any evidence of being
consummated. It is clear that this document precedes any payment required at “consideration” to
complete a contract. No evidence of any payment is provided. (Dkt. 76, PageID# 1378 at
paragraph “c).”)
Mr. Ye Yu’s Exhibit 2 purports to a renewal payment through Namecheap.com, but it is
merely an “Order Summary.” The “Approval #” under the “Additional Transaction Details” is
not entered. No evidence of any payment is provided. (Dkt. 76, PageID #1380.)
Regardless, Mr. Ye Yu’s Exhibit 2 does not identify the registrant and is dated
February 25, 2014. This exhibit does not prove anything about the ownership of the FXF.COM
domain name on December 28, 2015. Even if Mr. Ye Yu were the owner in February 2014, he
could have subsequently transferred the FXF.COM domain name to Whoisguard, Inc., at any
time prior to the filing of the Original Complaint.
IV.

CONCLUSION
Should Mr. Ye Yu tender credible evidence of his alleged ownership of the FXF.COM

domain name on the filing date of the Original Complaint, Associated Recovery requests
permission to file a surreply.

5

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 80 Filed 09/01/16 Page 6 of 8 PageID# 1432

If Mr. Ye Yu demonstrates standing to file his motion, Associated Recovery asks that the
Court maintain the status quo between the parties and order the domain name recovered by
Associated Recovery through the default judgment to remain in its account with its registrar,
Uniregistrar Corp., pending the outcome of this matter.

Date: September 1, 2016
