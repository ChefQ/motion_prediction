DEFENDANT'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO

SET ASIPE PJEFAULT JUDGMENT REGARDING FXF.COM

Ye Yu sued as defendant FXF.com, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 60(b), submit this Memorandum in Support of Motion to Set Aside
Default Judgement. Ye Yu is owner of the FXF.com, one of the domain names

against which Plaintiff has brought this complaint.
FACTS

A.

Related Litigation Case

This dispute is related to Case 3:09-CV-00988, NetsphereInc et al v. Baron
et al, which is filed on 2009-05-28 in Texas Northern District Court.

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 2 of 24 PageID# 1364

Pursuant to the Northern District Court of Texas's order authorizing sales of
the Plaintiffs domain names to meet the unpaid legal expenses. The domain
"FXF.com" is allerged as one of the domains.
B.

Ye Yu Purchases FXF.com

Ye Yu purchased the controlling interest of the domain "FXF.com" through

"SEDO.com" marketplace from previous registered owner. (Exhibit-1: Contract
and Sale Agreement)

After purchase, Ye Yu immediately began using the domain. Efforts and
resources have been put into the planning for "FXF.com", which was renewed for

many years in advance for our long term plan on the domain. (Exhibit-2: Renewal
Invoice)

C.

Service of Complaint

The plaintiff declared that they are unable to serve defendant "FXF.com" by

privacy email in ECF 17-1, howeverthere are 3 problems with that:
Firstly, the Plaintiff falsely declared that the privacy email was not
working. Ye Yu didn't experience any problem in receiving alerts through the

privacy email address. To support this, an example inquiry coming through the

privacy email is provided as Exhibit 3 (Exhibit-3: Purchase Inquiry).

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 3 of 24 PageID# 1365

Secondly, The plaintiff didn*t perform due diligence. The privacy email is
a paid service provided by the ENOM aka. NameCheap.com (the "registrar") to
help protected domain owner's personal email address online, it's never intended to
block communication. If the plaintiff contact the registrar, in this situation, the
registrar has the obligation to relay the message to the domain owner.
Thirdly, the email address used in service is either wrong or made up.

let's compare the email address in Exhibit-3 with which someone else has emailed

defendant successfully:

12664F3E16E24E89B1905AD3AC22E8FRPROTECT@whoisguard.com

against the wrong or made up email used for service in ECF 17-1:
15B93ABAFD0B47E787820FDA56E25280.PROTECT@whoisguard.com
D.

Service by Publication

Plaintiff published the court order ECF-6 in the Washington Times on Feb 3,
2016. However, Ye Yu does not subscribe to the Washington Times.
£.

Default Judgement and Order
Ye Yu noticed the domain was transferred out of his domain account on June

8, 2016. immediately he tried to work with the registrar's support to resolve the
suspected system error.

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 4 of 24 PageID# 1366

Ye Yu hear about the case for the first time only after registrar's legal

department finally responded with the Court Order (ECF 43) they have received.
Ye Yu immediately consulted his lawyer in California to learn about case.

Ye Yu initial plan was to reach out to the opposing party to explore
possibility of quick resolution instead of being litigious. Ye Yu also communicated
with Dentons for the prospect of being represented by them in the final week of
July. After careftil consideration, Ye Yu decided to file Pro Se. Since then, Ye Yu
has been actively learning civil procedures, local rules and research relevant cases.

Ye Yu has responded to the case in the most promptly manner as he is capable of

due to the complex history of the case, and necessary efforts in learning relevant
laws.
ARGUMENTS

A.

Constitutional Right

Attempt to contact by non-existing email address is the same as throw

Service of Process down the sewer or mail it to an non-existing physical address.
By United States Constitution, Ye Yu is entitled to the due process of law.

The plaintiffs invalid Service of Process injures the Constitutional right of Ye Yu.
At the time of writing, without due process of law, the property ownership has been
transferred.

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 5 of 24 PageID# 1367

B.

Preference to Meritorious Claim over Default

The Court VAED has strong tradition of giving preference to meritorious
claims over defaults as evident for example: Case No. 1:1 l-cv-00888 JCC/JFA.

Ye Yu has acquired domain through a contractual transaction. The same goes
for the previous registered owner(s) of the domain "FXF.com".

The plaintiff is involved with multiple cases that are all stemmed from the

same primary case in Texas Northern District Court, which is later went into
USCA. Because the main case is still open, the plaintiff has no concrete basis for
the complaint.

Under FRCP Rule 60(b)(1) for "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or

excusable neglect". Ye Yu without prior legal practice experiences have been
surprised and scrambling to react to the sudden loss of property without due
process.

Under FRCP Rule 60(b)(3) for "fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct by
an opposing party". I don't know if opposing party has made up a fake email and
"fraud" the Court, but even at the minimum, the Fact-C points of this memorandum
with Exhibit-3 demonstrated that the plaintiff has misrepresented the fact in order

to move the court to issue default judgement and subsequent order, which leads to

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 6 of 24 PageID# 1368

Ye Yu's Constitutional Right of due process of law being violated and the loss of
private property.
Pursuant to FRCP Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b), the Court has a good cause to
set aside the default judgement.

C.

Plaintiffs Claim Is Unjust
The auctioned portion of the domains produced a lot of cash to cover the

Plaintiffs unpaid legal expenses. If the same domains returns to the Plaintiff for
free, it would be gross injustice to all subsequent owners, who have spent their
hard earned and saved money for these domains. This would be equivalent to
robbery on these domains owners.
D.

Plaintiff Misinterprets USCA5 Unwind Order

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal ordered to vacate and unwind receivership,
however this should not be interpreted as to also reverse the past domain sales,

because these sales were necessary and only way to generate fund to cover legal
expenses affirmed by the Court.

By logic, if the Court ordered that the legal expenses shall be paid, it is also
affirming the past domain sales shall stand, because this is the only way to pay for
the legal expenses in the context of the original case.

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 7 of 24 PageID# 1369

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal's original Court Orders never explicitly stated

that the past domain sales shall be reversed, nor granting the plaintiff rights to take
the domains back for free.

E.

Plaintiff Didn^t Bring the Complaint in Good Faith

Texas Northern District Court is most familiar with the historic long

standing cases involving the Plaintiff, yet the Plaintiff chose to file in a different
state with a Court that has no prior encounter with the Plaintiff.

A look at the defendants listed in original complaint (ECF 1), the plaintiff
picked only domains with oversea owner addresses and oversea private registration
providers.
The foregoing stated factors are calculated to maximize the Plaintiffs chance

to get default judgement.
F.

The Defendant Requests The Court To Restore All Parties' Position

Prior to The Default Judgement
Because the default judgement was attained in questionable circumstances,

and the plaintiffs assertion on the domain hasn't been contested in court through
due process, the Plaintiff shouldn't have the right to continue hold the control of the
domain "FXF.com".

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 8 of 24 PageID# 1370

Therefore, it is only fair to restore all parties' position prior to the Default
Judgement.
G.

The Court Should Transfer This Action to Northern Texas District

Court

Firstly, the complaint brought by plaintiff is stemmed from the still open
case No. 3:09-CV-0988-F in the Northern Texas District Court, which held:

The court shall retain exclusivejurisdiction ofthis case over any disputes
that may arise concerning this or any earlier order, the wind down ofthe
Receivership estate, and the reliefprovided under this order, or any
controversy that arisesfrom or relates to the Receivership or actions ofthe
Receiver or his professionals.
Secondly, on August 1, 2016, the plaintiff has listed the defendant
"FXF.com" in the Northern Texas District Court Case No. 3:16-cv-01025-L ECF

76 "Amended Complaint" as one of the defendants.

CONCLUSION

WHEREFORE, for all previous mentioned reasons, Ye Yu and defendant

"FXF.com" respectfully request the Court to grand this motion to set aside default

judgement (ECF 43) and order Uniregistrar Corp., the current registrar of the
FXF.com domain name, in coordination with Verisign Inc., the registry of all

Case 1:15-cv-01723-AJT-JFA Document 76 Filed 08/18/16 Page 9 of 24 PageID# 1371

".com" domains, to take all steps within their power to transfer the domain back to
Ye Yu at its original registrar and transfer of the case to Northern District of Texas.

To Wliom it may concern,

I located your contact from whois lookup and I understand that you own the domain name fxf.com
I am looking to secure a domain name for my startup and I think fxf.com would be useful.
In order to express my genuine interest in fxf.com I would like to make a serious offer of $35,000 USD via escrow.
I believe the price is fair because the domain is short and easy to remember.

Please feel free to let me know your thoughts.
Best Regards,
Jennifer
