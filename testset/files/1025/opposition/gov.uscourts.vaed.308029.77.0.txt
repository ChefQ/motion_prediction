IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
ALEXANDRIA DIVISION

PRO-FOOTBALL, INC.,
Plaintiff,

Civil Action No.: 1:14-cv-1043-GBL-IDD

v.
AMANDA BLACKHORSE, MARCUS
BRIGGS-CLOUD, PHILLIP GOVER,
JILLIAN PAPPAN and COURTNEY
TSOTIGH,
Defendants.
DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO ACLU’S
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE
Defendants Amanda Blackhorse, Marcus Briggs-Cloud, Phillip Gover, Jillian Pappan and
Courtney Tsotigh (“Defendants”) respectfully oppose the motion by the American Civil Liberties
Union and American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia (collectively, “ACLU”) for leave to file a
brief of amici curiae regarding Plaintiff’s Constitutional arguments. [Dkt. 76] The proposed
ACLU brief comes too late, unnecessarily burdens the Court and the parties with an additional
20 pages of briefing, and intrudes on the balanced schedule negotiated by the Plaintiff,
Defendants, and the United States, and then adopted by this Court in January. Accordingly, the
motion should be denied.
ARGUMENT
A trial court should only accept a brief of amicus curiae if it is both timely and useful.
Tafas v. Dudas, 511 F. Supp. 2d 652, 659 (E.D. Va. 2007). In assessing the usefulness of the
proffered brief, the Court should consider whether existing counsel is in need of assistance and
1

whether further briefing will be helpful to the Court. Bryant v. Better Business Bureau, 923 F.
Supp. 720, 728 (D. Md. 1996) (cited by Tafas, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 659).
The proffered ACLU amicus brief is not timely. ACLU was on notice of Plaintiff’s
intent to raise Constitutional arguments since the Complaint’s filing in August, 2014.

In

addition, the separate briefing of Constitutional issues was a primary issue at the January 15,
2015 Scheduling Conference, and on January 22, 2015 the parties jointly proposed a briefing
schedule that allotted the parties 170 pages solely on the Constitutional issues. Yet, at no time
prior to the Scheduling Conference or even during the month after the Court’s January 26, 2015
Scheduling Order did ACLU voice any interest in filing an amicus brief. ACLU’s motion comes
months late, as Defendants are preparing their opposition to Plaintiff’s Constitution-based
arguments, and while the parties are separately briefing whether Plaintiff’s “Redskins” marks are
disparaging. Had ACLU announced its intention earlier, the parties could have proposed an
alternative or revised briefing schedule to the Court. Now, it is simply too late.
Moreover, Plaintiff has no need for outside assistance in presenting its Constitutional
arguments to the Court. Plaintiff is represented by one of the largest law firms in the country,
which has vigorously litigated this case and its predecessor for many years before a variety of
forums; there is no reason to believe that they are not competent to adequately address the issues
without aid from ACLU. Moreover, the Court has already agreed to increase the page limit for
Plaintiff to brief the Constitutional issues, permitting a 40 page reply brief. 1 Allowing 20
additional pages from ACLU would merely increase the burden on Defendants and the Court to
review yet more briefing, to no discernible benefit.

1

Defendants consented to Plaintiff receiving additional pages for its reply because the United
States is filing a separate brief opposing Plaintiff’s Constitutional arguments. The proposed
ACLU brief upsets this negotiated balance.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court deny the
Motion for Leave to File Brief of Amici Curiae.
