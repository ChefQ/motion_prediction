IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE
Proposed Amici Curiae American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties
Union of Virginia, by and through undersigned counsel, file this motion for leave to file a brief
in the above-captioned case. The proposed brief is attached to this motion. Counsel for amici
have contacted all parties to seek consent to file this motion; Plaintiff and Defendant United
States do not oppose this motion, but counsel for Defendants Blackhorse, et al., intend to oppose
it.
In support of this motion, proposed amici state the following:

1

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 76 Filed 03/05/15 Page 2 of 5 PageID# 2849

1.

This case presents the issue of whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.

§ 1052(a), which requires the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) to refuse registration of
any trademark that it deems “immoral,” “scandalous,” or disparaging to any persons, is a
violation of the First Amendment. The Plaintiff in this case owns the trademark of the National
Football League team, the “Redskins,” and filed suit after the PTO invoked the disparagement
clause of Section 2(a) to cancel the Redskins trademark on the ground that the mark is
disparaging to Native Americans. The Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment argues, among
other things, that the disparagement clause of Section 2(a) violates the First Amendment both
facially and as applied to the Redskins mark. Amici agree; but unlike Plaintiff, have no financial
stake in this case, and have even called on Plaintiff to change the name of the team.
2.

The court’s disposition of Plaintiff’s motion is of critical importance, because it

implicates First Amendment protections against viewpoint-based censorship of private speech.
Proposed amici have considerable expertise in this area of law and seek to file a brief to aid the
court in its resolution of this one constitutional issue in the case. Amici seek to place this case in
the broader context of Section 2(a)’s inconsistent and unconstitutional results for trademark
applicants beyond the instant Plaintiff.
3.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nationwide, nonprofit,

nonpartisan organization with more than 500,000 members dedicated to the principles of liberty
and equality embodied in the Constitution and our nation’s civil rights laws. Since its founding in
1920, the ACLU has vigorously defended free speech and racial justice, and has appeared before
the federal courts in numerous First Amendment cases involving viewpoint discrimination, both
as direct counsel and as amicus curiae, including American Civil Liberties Union of N.C. v. Tata,
742 F.3d 563 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding unconstitutional a state’s decision to issue a “Choose Life”

specialty license plate while refusing to issue a pro-choice specialty plate), petition for cert. filed
sub nom. Berger v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of N.C., No. 14-35 (July 11, 2014), Reno v.
American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844 (1997) (striking down statutory provisions
censoring “indecent” and “patently offensive” communications on the Internet), and Walker v.
Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., No. 14-144, petition for cert. granted Dec. 5,
2014 (hearing appeal of Fifth Circuit’s ruling holding Texas’ viewpoint-based ban on specialty
license plates is unconstitutional). The proper resolution of this case is a matter of substantial
interest to the ACLU and its members. The ACLU of Virginia is an affiliate of the national
ACLU.
5.

Proposed amici advance the following arguments in their brief. Section 2(a) of the

Lanham Act regulates private expression protected by the First Amendment and impermissibly
mandates viewpoint discrimination, because it regulates trademarks based on their perceived
message. Additionally, Section 2(a) burdens private speech by placing an unconstitutional
condition on the receipt of valuable government benefits. As the benefits of federal registration
are both uncontested and significant, the denial or cancellation of a trademark creates a direct
and substantial burden on the speaker, and, therefore the speech, in violation of the First
Amendment. Lastly, Section 2(a) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and has led to
arbitrary enforcement by the PTO, which has both granted and rejected registration of the very
same terms.
6.

Proposed amici contacted all parties to this case on February 26, 2015 to seek

consent to file this motion and the attached proposed brief. Plaintiff consents to this motion.
Intervenor-Defendant United States informed amici on March 3rd that the government does not
oppose this motion. Defendants Blackhorse, et al. informed amici on February 27th that they did

not consent to this motion, and further stated on March 3rd that they intend to file an opposition
hereto.
WHEREFORE, proposed amici respectfully request leave to file the attached brief of
amici curiae.

Respectfully Submitted,
