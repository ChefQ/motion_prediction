DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO
PLAINTIFF’S MATERIAL, UNDISPUTED FACTS
Plaintiff Kumar is a computer scientist whose work has focused
on medical robotics, computer-assisted surgery and other human-machine
interactions. Declaration of Dr. Rajesh Kumar (“Kumar Decl.”) ¶ 3 & Ex. B.
1.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kumar has worked in academia and private industry,
including in a senior position at Intuitive Surgical, Inc., where he developed the
prototype that led to the da Vinci Si robotic surgery platform. Kumar Decl. ¶ 3 &
Ex. B.
2.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kumar has published over 100 patents and applications,
books, chapters, articles and peer-reviewed conference papers. Kumar Decl. ¶ 3 &
Ex. B pp. 2-12.
3.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kumar has served as a conference organizer and article
reviewer for Defendant IEEE. Kumar Decl. Ex. B at 1-2.
4.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits that
Plaintiff Rajesh Kumar (“Kumar”) has reviewed articles for IEEE but denies that
Kumar has served as a conference organizer for IEEE. Kumar Dec., Exh. B at 1-2.
IEEE editors continued to solicit Dr. Kumar’s expertise for peer
review even after this lawsuit was filed. Kumar Decl. Ex. C.
5.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 3 of 36 PageID: 3141

Dr. Kumar began his Ph.D. research as a graduate student in
computer science at Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”) in 1996. There, he
researched and developed new software architectures for computer-assisted
surgery, focusing on systems in which humans and robots perform surgical and
other tasks cooperatively. He worked primarily with JHU’s “steady hand robot,” a
modular test bed that he helped develop and for which he wrote all of the robot
control application programming interface software needed during his graduate
student tenure. The steady hand robot allows a user to manipulate a tool jointly
with the machine, in a manner that reduces human tremor and enables extreme
precision. Kumar Decl. ¶ 5.
6.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits the
allegations contained in the first, second and fourth sentences in this Paragraph.
With respect to the third sentence contained in this paragraph, Kumar was among
many scientists and researchers who worked on the “steady hand” robot, which
was conceived independently of him. See the Moving Declaration of Russell
Taylor (“Taylor Dec.”) [Dkt. 73], ¶¶ 2-3, Exhs. A and B. The implication that
Kumar was somehow a creator or primary author of the steady hand robot is
therefore denied.
Dr. Kumar’s Ph.D. dissertation (“Thesis”), published in 2001, is
entitled “An Augmented Steady Hand System for Precise Micromanipulation.”
The Thesis is based on his five-plus years of research at JHU. Kumar Decl. ¶¶ 2,
6, Ex. A.
7.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kumar led and was personally responsible for the work
described in the Thesis, which was funded in part with National Science
Foundation grants. Kumar Decl. ¶ 6.
8.

3

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 4 of 36 PageID: 3142

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits that the
Thesis describes some work for which Kumar was personally responsible that was
funded in part with National Science Foundation grants. However, as the Thesis
makes clear, other work it describes was performed by other scientists, on whose
research Kumar built. See, e.g., Kumar Dec., Exh. A at RK-IEEE000268-75;
Opposition Declaration of Bruce R. Ewing (“Ewing Opp. Dec.”), Exh. A (Taylor
Tr.) at 190-91, 195.
The Thesis is Dr. Kumar’s original solution to a complex
computing problem: how to generate simple, modular programming instructions
(“primitives”) that can be combined and transparently implemented to control the
steady hand robot in order to execute complex, microscopic tasks in coordination
with a human operator. The Thesis explains how to use “task modeling” to
improve control of the steady hand robot, thereby enhancing its potential future use
in microsurgery and other tasks requiring both extreme precision and human
decision-making. Kumar Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. A.
9.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits that the
Thesis as a whole contains original material contributed by Kumar, but denies that
the concept of using “task modeling” to operate a robot, or to program a robot by
using modular programming instructions known as primitives, are such original
contributions. See Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. A (Taylor Tr.) at 39-41, 190-91, 195;
see also Defendant’s Local Civil Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts Not in
Dispute (“IEEE 56.1 Statement”) [Dkt. 74], ¶¶ 19-23, 34-42.

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 5 of 36 PageID: 3143

Dr. Kumar’s Thesis used visualizations, called “task graphs,” to
both visualize the complex tasks and to help implement the corresponding
computer code that instructs the robot to perform complex motions – some humaninitiated, some machine-initiated. The task graphs decompose complex tasks into a
series of more basic modules, each signifying a particular set of coding
instructions. Kumar Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. A at 38; Expert Declaration of J. Kenneth
Salisbury Jr. (“Salisbury Decl.”) ¶ 15.
10.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
The Thesis provides several example scenarios for
implementing and testing Dr. Kumar’s task graph programming. One such
experiment is based on “retinal vein cannulation” (“RVC”), a microsurgical
technique that involves insertion of a micropipette (a minuscule tube) into a blood
vessel in the retina in order to inject medicine. Kumar Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. A at 51-77.
11.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kumar had practical reasons for choosing RVC as an
experimental example. Porcine eyes were readily available for research purposes,
and a small business had donated the necessary needles, thus providing a nonclinical setting in which Dr. Kumar could perform the numerous trials needed to
test the feasibility and effectiveness of his code. Kumar Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. A at 6975, 81.
12.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE denies the
allegations contained in this paragraph to the extent Kumar contends that his use of
the retinal vein cannulation surgical procedure as an example in his Thesis was due
to practical considerations. In fact, the scientists at Johns Hopkins University
(“JHU”) who developed the steady hand robot made the retinal vein cannulation
procedure a focus of their research, making it a natural area of study for Kumar
and others at JHU. Taylor Dec., ¶¶ 2-3, Exh. A at IEEE_001560-61, Exh. B at
5

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 6 of 36 PageID: 3144

pages C-12-C-13; Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. A (Taylor Tr.) at 96-97; Exh. B (Hager
Tr.) at 25-27, 78-82, 195-200.
As part of his Thesis work, Dr. Kumar used the robot to pierce
the porcine vessels with a micropipette, both with and without his task-level
augmentation code. The experiments confirmed the feasibility of Dr. Kumar’s task
graph program in a realistic surgical workspace. Kumar Decl. Ex. A at 72, 75.
13.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits the
allegations contained in the first sentence of this paragraph. IEEE denies the
allegations contained in the second sentence of this paragraph, as the experiments
described in the Thesis were not performed on human eyes, and the Thesis makes
clear that further research would be needed. Kumar Dec., Exh. A at RKIEEE000331-34.
RVC has never been clinically performed on humans with
steady-hand robotic assistance. Kumar Decl. ¶ 9; Declaration of Eric M. Stahl
(“Stahl Decl.”) Ex. N, 64:2-65:15.
14.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
The Thesis is not about RVC, but simply uses RVC as an
illustration of one of the experiments Dr. Kumar devised to test his code. Kumar
Decl. ¶ 9.
15.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Thesis Figure 5.13 consists of a task graph representation of Dr.
Kumar’s RVC experiment. Kumar Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. A at 70-72, Fig. 5.13.
16.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
6

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 7 of 36 PageID: 3145

Thesis Figure 5.13 does not describe the steps necessary to
actually perform RVC; rather, it decomposes the surgical process into individual,
programmable tasks, at a level of abstraction that Dr. Kumar determined to be
appropriate for performing his experiment. Kumar Decl. ¶ 10; Salisbury Decl.
¶¶ 16-21.
17.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE denies that
Figure 5.13 describes anything. Rather, the Figure lists visually the steps involved
when the retinal vein cannulation surgical procedure is performed by the steady
hand robot, which was an active area of research at JHU at the time the Thesis was
drafted. Taylor Dec., ¶¶ 2-3, Exh. A at IEEE_001560-61, Exh. B at on pages C12-C-13; Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at 42-45, 209-16. In addition, the
“level of abstraction” reflected in Figure 5.13 is not attributable to any creative
selections made by Kumar, but is an artifact of the manner in which the retinal vein
cannulation procedure is performed with the aid of the steady hand robot. See the
Moving Declaration of Bruce R. Ewing (“Ewing Mov. Dec.”) [Dkt. 73], Exh. U
(Kumar Tr.) at 55-57, Exh. V (Taylor Tr.) at 87-88, Exh. W (Hager Tr.) at 66-67;
see the Moving Declaration of Thomas R. Friberg (“Friberg Dec.”) [Dkt. 73], Exh.
A at pp. 2-3.
Each state (e.g., “MoveToPort,” “Orient,” “Insert,”) and each
transition (e.g., “button1”) in Thesis Figure 5.13 signifies substantial code that Dr.
Kumar created for this RVC experiment. Kumar Decl. ¶ 11.
18.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.

7

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 8 of 36 PageID: 3146

A task graph depicting RVC as an actual surgical procedure
(rather than a technological demonstration) would not describe “orient” and insert”
as separate steps. Kumar Decl. ¶ 10.
19.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE denies the
allegations contained in this paragraph to the extent it concerns a task graph
depicting the retinal vein cannulation procedure as performed by the steady hand
robot. Any task graph showing the steps the steady hand robot would go through
in performing the retinal vein cannulation procedure would include “Orient” and
“Insert” steps. Ewing Mov. Dec., Exh. U (Kumar Tr.) at 55-57, Exh. V (Taylor
Tr.) at 87-88; Exh. W (Hager Tr.) at 66-67; Friberg Dec., Exh. A at pp. 2-3.
A task graph depicting RVC as an actual surgical procedure
(rather than a technological demonstration) would have included additional tasks
and additional detail, such as a task for delivering medication into the retinal vessel
or a “tracking” task, neither of which are depicted in Thesis Figure 5.13. Kumar
Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. A at 70, 76-77; Stahl Decl. Ex. B 118:10-119:12; Ex. N 74:4-13.
20.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits that,
when retinal vein cannulation is performed as an actual surgical procedure,
medication would typically be delivered through the cannula. IEEE denies that,
when retinal vein cannulation is performed as an actual surgical procedure without
the steady hand robot, a “tracking” task must be employed, as the Thesis discusses
that concept only as a possibility when the procedure is performed with the aid of
the steady hand robot. Kumar Dec., Exh. A at RK-IEEE000335.

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 9 of 36 PageID: 3147

Thesis Figure 5.13 is original to Dr. Kumar. He created it to
reflect his Thesis RVC experiment as it was coded., and he conceived the
individual steps shown therein, their sequence, and their text descriptions. While
the task graph reflects Dr. Kumar’s general understanding of RVC (based on
clinical ophthalmology videos depicting the procedure), it is not based on any preexisting work. Kumar Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. A at 70-71; Salisbury Decl. ¶ 14-19.
21.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. Figure 5.13 of the Thesis shows the steps
necessary to perform retinal vein cannulation with the aid of the steady hand robot
that are dictated by the nature of the procedure, in the sequence in which they must
be performed when performed by that robot. Ewing Mov. Dec., Exh. U (Kumar
Tr.) at 55-57, Exh. V (Taylor Tr.) at 87-88, Exh. W (Hager Tr.) at 66-67, 209-16;
Friberg Dec., Exh. A at pp. 2-3; see the accompanying Declaration of Blake
Hannaford, Ph.D. (“Hannaford Dec.”), ¶¶ 11-19; see also IEEE 56.1 Statement,
¶¶ 20-39.
The Thesis satisfied JHU Computer Science Department’s
Ph.D. requirements, which require a doctoral dissertation to be a “large, careful,
and substantive piece [of] original work.” Stahl Decl. Ex. R at 8 (emphasis
added); id. Ex. P 23:5-16; 36:9-19; Ex. Q 20:13-27:19.
22.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted. The JHU Ph.D. requirements specify that the
Thesis as a whole must be original, not all of its constituent elements. Ewing Opp.
Dec., Exh. A (Taylor Tr.) at 190-91.
The Thesis’ original work includes its use of task graphs to
instruct the robot to perform complex micromanipulation tasks. Stahl Decl. Ex. Q
65:7-66:13, 84:7-21; Ex. P 34:20-35:20; Kumar Decl. Ex. A at 19-20, 36;

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 10 of 36 PageID: 3148

Defendant’s Response: Denied. The use of task graphs to identify the steps
performed by a robot undertaking a complex procedure like retinal vein
cannulation pre-dates the Thesis. See Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 11-19, Exhs. B-E; IEEE
56.1 Statement, ¶¶ 34-42.
The Thesis was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office in
2001, the same year it was published. Kumar Decl. Ex. D.
24.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kumar is the registered author and sole copyright claimant
of the Thesis. Kumar Decl. Ex. D.
25.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.

¶ 14.

26.

Dr. Kumar left JHU for private industry in 2001. Kumar Decl.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
In late 2002, Dr. Greg Hager of JHU’s Computer Science
department (one of the faculty readers who approved the Thesis) invited Danica
Kragic to visit JHU as a post-doctoral researcher to work on human-machine
micromanipulation. Stahl Decl. Ex. B 30:12-33:22; Ex. C.
27.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
During her visit, Dr. Kragic and Dr. Hager submitted the
accused article in this case, “Task Modeling and Specification for Modular
Sensory Based Human-Machine Cooperative Systems,” which IEEE published in
2003 (the “IEEE Article”). Stahl Decl. Ex. A (Article); Ex. T 22:24-23:10.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.

and control the steady hand robot in “human-machine cooperative systems,” which
is a concept described in those words only in the Article. Compare Stahl Dec.,
Exh. A with Kumar Dec., Exh. A.
The IEEE Article describes the same strategy as is described in
the Thesis for programming higher level tasks using graphically depicted coding
primitives. Stahl Decl. Ex. A (IEEE Article) § 2. Kumar Decl. Ex. A.
37.

Defendant’s Response: IEEE is not clear what is meant by the term “strategy” as
used in this Paragraph. If “strategy” is meant to refer to the representation of task
sequences in the form of a task graph including states and transitions, then IEEE
admits the allegations contained in this Paragraph but asserts that such a “strategy”
is not original to Kumar. Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 11-19, Exhs. B-E. However, if
“strategy” is meant to refer to the series of steps that are undertaken when the
retinal vein cannulation procedure is performed with the aid of the steady hand
robot, then IEEE denies the allegations contained in this Paragraph, as the
“strategies” depicted in the Article and the Thesis differ in this regard. See
Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 20-29; IEEE Additional Facts, ¶ 3, infra.
Like the Thesis, the IEEE Article illustrates this strategy and
coding using RVC as an example, and contains a task graph containing the same
(non-clinical) task decomposition of RVC as is seen in the Thesis. Stahl Decl. Ex.
A. § III, VIII; Figure 1; Kumar Decl. Ex. A.
38.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. See Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at
229-30; Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 20-29; IEEE Additional Facts, ¶ 3, infra.

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 15 of 36 PageID: 3153

The authors of the IEEE Article had no particular reason to
choose RVC as an illustration. The IEEE Article contains no RVC-related
experiment, no trials and no results. Stahl Decl. Ex. A.
39.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. Retinal vein cannulation was a subject of active,
ongoing research involving the steady hand robot at the time the Article was
written. See Response to Paragraph 12, supra; IEEE 56.1 Statement, ¶¶ 22-24.
The IEEE Article contains an expression of the RVC task graph
. It is effectively the same as that
described in Dr. Kumar’s Thesis, simply translated into a different computer
; id. Ex. A, Section VIII; Kumar
language (XML). Stahl Decl.

XML is a “markup language,” like HTML. It enables a user to
program by “stating what the results should be,” in contrast to Dr. Kumar’s
language, which contains the actual step-by-step instructions or “recipe” to achieve
the results. Stahl Decl. Ex. N 114:19-117:3.
41.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
Dr. Kragic claims she prepared the IEEE Article’s RVC task
graph using the same software program (Xfig) that Dr. Kumar used to draw Thesis

A side-by-side comparison of the coding in Dr. Kragic’s Xfig
source file for Article Fig. 1 and that in the Xfig source file for Dr. Kumar’s figure
5.13 shows that Kumar’s work was the original source for the IEEE Article’s task
graph. Each element of Dr. Kragic’s task graph was created in the same sequence
and same manner of construction as Dr. Kumar’s original, with the same document
settings, formatting and stylistic elements (except that the IEEE Article version
rotates the orientation from “portrait” to “landscape”). Kumar Decl. ¶¶ 21-27 &

Defendant’s Response: Denied. See Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 30-35, Exh. F.
Each of the two task graphs at issue involved entering into Xfig
hundreds of individual elements – i.e., shapes, text and formatting. They would
not have appeared in the same order, with the same formatting and construction
choices, unless the figures came from the same source. Kumar Decl. ¶¶ 21-27;
Exs. I –K.
44.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. See Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 30-35, Exh. F.
Dr. Kumar’s Xfig source file was stored on a shared JHU
network drive, and would have been accessible to anyone with administrative
access to that shared network. Kumar Decl. ¶ 22.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted.
, and there
is no evidence that either Kragic or Hager had administrative access to the network
on which they were stored.
The IEEE Article offers no insight into task-level programming
of cooperative human-robot systems that is not also contained in the Thesis.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted to the extent that Hager used the words
“apparent” and “troublesome” to describe the resemblance between the two
Figures, but Hager also stated that Figure 1 of the Article was “clearly different”
from Figure 5.13 of the Thesis and that any similarities were superficial. Ewing
Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at 120-22.
IEEE’s expert witness attempted to locate another example of a
task graph depiction of RVC, and failed to find a single one. The only such task
graph is the one Dr. Kumar created and the IEEE Article copied. Stahl Decl. Ex. N
53:3-17; 93:1-14; id. Ex. Q 91.
67.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits the
allegations contained in the first sentence of this Paragraph, but this fact is hardly
surprising, since there is no evidence any other robotics laboratory was working or
has ever worked on retinal vein cannulation. Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.)
at 66-67; Ewing Mov. Dec., Exh. U (Kumar Tr.) at 49. IEEE denies the second
sentence of this Paragraph. See IEEE's Responses to Paragraphs 12, 17, supra, and
IEEE Additional Facts, ¶ 3, infra; see also IEEE 56.1 Response, ¶¶ 25-42.
Kragic and Hager later used the same task graph (IEEE Article

these later works have all issued statements or errata noting Kumar should have
been acknowledged in connection with the task graph. Kumar Decl. ¶ 18 & Ex. E,
F.
68.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits the
allegations contained in the first sentence of this Paragraph and that other

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 25 of 36 PageID: 3163

publishers have issued statements or errata with respect to these other articles, but
denies that “Kumar should have been acknowledged in connection with the task
graph.” Further, agreements Kumar reached with other publishers in settlement of
actual or contemplated litigation are inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 402, 403 and
408, and IEEE objects to the Court’s consideration of all evidence concerning such
settlements on this motion. See McHann v. Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., 713
F.2d 161, 166 (5th Cir. 1983) (“. . . nor can plaintiff show the defendant’s liability
or extent of liability, by proof of defendant’s settlement with a third person”);
Trout v. Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 572 F.Supp.2d 591, 596-600 (M.D. Pa.
2008).
Section IV of the IEEE Article (“Basic Primitives”) contains
routines and primitives taken entirely from the Thesis. The framework, task
elements and terminology that the Article uses to express these instructions are all
lifted from the Thesis. Kumar Decl. Ex. A chapters 4, 5 and pp. 96-97; Stahl Decl.
Ex. A § IV; Salisbury Decl. ¶ 32.
69.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. See Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at
227-29; Hannaford Dec., ¶¶ 20-29; see also IEEE Additional Facts, ¶ 3, infra,
Response to Paragraphs 12, 17, supra.
The article copies, practically verbatim, the Thesis’ description
of the steady hand robot hardware. Kumar Decl. Ex. A at 22-23; Stahl Decl. Ex. A
§ III (last full paragraph).
70.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. While one sentence in the Article describing
certain attributes of the hardware of the steady hand robot is similar to a sentence
25

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 26 of 36 PageID: 3164

in the Thesis describing the same attributes, which is hardly surprising given the
subject matter, the remainder of the hardware descriptions are notably different.
Compare Kumar Dec., Exh. A at RK-IEEE000281-82 with Stahl Dec., Exh. A at
IEEE_000507-08. Further, the same degree of similarity is found when the same
passage in the Article co-authored by Hager, Stahl Dec., Exh. A at IEEE_00050708, is compared with the unpublished manuscript co-authored by Hager that he
gave to Kragic before her arrival at JHU. Stahl Dec., Exh. E at 4, Section III(A) at
paragraph 2.
The two works describe their objectives in similar terms: the
Thesis’ goal is to “augment human actions in medicine” where “precision,
efficiency, and consistency” are required; the IEEE Article’s goal is “augmenting
surgical manipulation tasks” which are “repetitive, sequential and consist of simple
steps.” Stahl Decl. Ex. A (Abstract); Kumar Decl. Ex. A at 9.
71.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. The expression in the two cited excerpts is
obviously different, beyond the concept of augmenting surgical procedures through
the aid of robots, a concept that is neither protectable nor original to Kumar.
Taylor Dec., ¶¶ 2-3, Exh. A at IEEE_001538, 1542-43 (1997 CISST ERC grant
proposal with sections devoted to “Surgical Augmentation Systems”), Exh. B at
cover page (Title of 1998 JHU grant proposal listed as “Cooperative Steady-Hand
Augmentation of Human Skill in Micromanipulation Task”).
The Thesis and IEEE Article use the same expressive content to
describe the robot’s software architecture: “A modular architecture was designed

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 27 of 36 PageID: 3165

for controlling the steady hand robot. This architecture is suitable for several other
surgical robot applications[.]” Kumar Decl. Ex. A. at 20. “The system has to be
modular – complex tasks should be defined using a set of basic control primitives.
This allows the surgeon to model a variety of tasks using the existing architecture.”
Stahl Decl. Ex. A, § I.
Defendant’s Response: Denied, beyond the common reference to a “modular”
software architecture, which is a common term widely used in the field of robotics.
Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at 75-76; see also IEEE 56.1 Statement,
¶¶ 37-39.
The two works use nearly identical terms to describe the
software controls used to manipulate the robot. The Article discusses the robot “as
a purely kinematic Cartesian device,” with specific inputs for controlling the tool
tip position and velocity. Stahl Decl. Ex. A § IV.A. The Thesis likewise explains
that “for moving to a specified frame, Cartesian control simply involves
performing inverse kinematics on the given frame and moving with obtained joint
parameters.” Kumar Decl. Ex. A at 29; id. at 25-27 (discussing kinematic
parameters).
73.

Defendant’s Response: Denied, beyond the common references to the steady
hand robot as having “Cartesian” controls and “kinematic” properties, which are
common concepts in robotics and terms that are necessary to use when describing
attributes of the steady hand robot. Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at 38-40;
Salisbury Dec., ¶ 8 (describing an article Salisbury published in 1980 called
“Active Stiffness Control of a Manipulator in Cartesian Coordinates”); see also
IEEE 56.1 Statement, ¶¶ 43-46.

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 28 of 36 PageID: 3166

Dr. Kumar was not aware of the IEEE Article’s publication in
2003. It was published without his knowledge or permission. Kumar Decl. ¶ 15.
74.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted. No such permission was required.
Dr. Kumar returned to JHU in 2007 as an assistant research
professor, working on research unrelated to his Thesis topics. He discovered the
IEEE Article in 2010, while preparing a grant application to the National Science
Foundation for JHU. He had no prior knowledge of its existence. Kumar Decl.
¶15.
75.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. At a minimum, on two occasions in 2009,
Kumar was listed as a co-principal investigator on grant applications submitted to
the National Science Foundation by Hager in which the Article was one of the
cited references. Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. E at IEEE_001380, 1402 (Ref. 60), Exh.
F at IEEE_001428, 1454 (Ref. 71).
Dr. Kumar recognized immediately that the IEEE Article was
based on his Thesis. Kumar Decl. ¶16.
76.

Defendant’s Response: Denied. As set forth in IEEE’s Response to Paragraph
75, supra, Kumar had to be aware of the Article no later than 2009, but he did not
complain to IEEE until January 2012, as set forth in IEEE’s Response to Paragraph
80, infra. As set forth in IEEE’s Responses to Paragraphs 35-40, 43-44, 46, supra,
and in Paragraph 3 of IEEE’s Additional Facts, infra, the Article was not based on
Kumar’s Thesis.

28

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 29 of 36 PageID: 3167

Because the IEEE Article was co-authored by a JHU colleague
(Dr. Hager, by then chair of the Computer Science Department), he attempted first
to have his concerns resolved internally. Kumar Decl. ¶ 16.
77.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted. However, Kumar’s “concerns” with JHU
encompassed a number of other issues beyond the Article co-authored by Hager.
Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. G. IEEE objects to the Court’s consideration on this
motion or at trial of Kumar’s disputes with JHU, its review of his complaints that
JHU characterized as “research or professional misconduct,” and the outcome of
his subsequent lawsuit against JHU as being irrelevant to any of the matters this
Court must decide in this copyright infringement dispute. See Fed. R. Evid. 402.
A JHU dean conducted a summary inquiry into Dr. Kumar’s
allegations, construing them as a claim of research misconduct. While JHU found
no violations of the university’s research misconduct policies, the inquiry did not
consider the issue of copyright infringement. Stahl Decl. Ex. CC at RKIEEE000904; id. Ex. BB 77:11-21.
78.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted. See IEEE’s objection incorporated into its
Response to Paragraph 77, supra.
JHU later wrongfully retaliated against Dr. Kumar’s
employment for his pursuit of the complaint. Kumar Decl. ¶ 19 & Ex. G.
79.

Defendant’s Response: IEEE admits that a jury in Baltimore found JHU liable in
the amount of $10,000 for retaliating against Kumar for filing a complaint of
research misconduct that encompassed issues other than the Article co-authored by

29

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 30 of 36 PageID: 3168

Hager. Kumar Dec., Exh. G; Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. G. See IEEE’s objection
incorporated into its Response to Paragraph 77, supra.
Dr. Kumar also alerted IEEE of his concerns with the IEEE
Article. Stahl Decl. Ex. T 62:14-24.
80.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted. As stated in the deposition excerpt cited in
this Paragraph, Kumar transmitted a plagiarism complaint to IEEE in January
2012.
IEEE admits its initial investigation of Dr. Kumar’s complaint
violated IEEE’s own written policies, because it assigned the investigation to a
single IEEE officer rather than a required independent, “ad hoc” committee of
experts. That officer had clear conflicts of interest:
, and he had advised a grad student who had preceded Dr. Kragic at
JHU and had co-authored articles with Dr. Hager. Stahl Decl. Ex. T 52:18-53:13;
74:18-75:21;
; Kumar Decl. ¶ 20 & Ex. H.
81.

Defendant’s Response: Admitted in part and denied in part. IEEE admits that,
initially, the investigation of Kumar’s plagiarism complaint was assigned to Dr.
Alessandro DeLuca, the then-Vice President of Publications at the IEEE Robotics
and Automation Society (not IEEE itself). Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. H (Vengraitis
Tr.) at 51-54. Consistent with IEEE policy, DeLuca should have appointed an
independent, ad hoc committee to review Kumar’s plagiarism complaint that
would report to him, id. at 52, but he failed to do so and instead summarily
dismissed the complaint. Vengraitis Opp. Dec., ¶ 4; Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. H
(Vengraitis Tr.) at 73-74. When Kumar complained about this dismissal, DeLuca

are hereby incorporated by reference, and the following additional material
undisputed facts are offered for the Court’s consideration.

Prior to 2001, when the Thesis was published, Hager had served as an

Assistant and Associate Research Professor at Yale University and a full Professor
at JHU, beginning in 1999. He had also published, alone or with co-authors, 14
journal articles, 4 book chapters, 8 invited articles, and 47 peer-reviewed
conference papers before that time, among many other professional
accomplishments. Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. I.
3.

While Figure 5.13 of the Thesis and Figure 1 of the Article share

similarities attributable to the fact that they concern the same research, performed
on the same robot, in the same lab, there are material differences between them,
namely:

Case 2:12-cv-06870-KSH-CLW Document 89 Filed 04/06/15 Page 35 of 36 PageID: 3173

A.

Figure 5.13 depicts transitions from the “Insert” and “Contact” states

to the “Retract” state, whereas Figure 1 of the Article depicts transitions to an
“Error” state from all other states.
B.

“Start” is depicted as a state in Figure 1 of the Article but as a

transition in Figure 5.13 of the Thesis.
C.

“Contact” is a state and a transition in Figure 5.13 of the Thesis, but

only a state in Figure 1 of the Article.
D.

In Figure 5.13 of the Thesis, a button must be pressed to puncture the

vein, whereas in Figure 1 of the Article, no button is pressed to reach the
“Puncture” state. Ewing Opp. Dec., Exh. A (Taylor Tr.) at 116-17, 122-25; Exh. B
(Hager Tr.) at 45-61, 83-85, 156-57;

The Thesis generally is concerned with very specific applications and

is more detailed than the Article, which focuses on more general principles and
their application in XML language. Ewing Dec., Exh. B (Hager Tr.) at 69-73, 22122.
