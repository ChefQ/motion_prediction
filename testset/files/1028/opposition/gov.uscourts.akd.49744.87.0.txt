ATTORNEYS’ FEES

Defendant.
Defendant Government Services Corp. (“GSC”) hereby opposes the Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees filed by Plaintiff Big State Logistics, Inc., (“Big State”) at Docket 76.
Big State’s approach to this litigation has been a case study in vexatious, obstreperous,
and wasteful litigation practices. GSC respectfully submits that the Court should not
reward these improper practices with an enhanced attorneys’ fee award, and that Big

State’s practices instead mandate a reduction of any Rule 82 award.
INTRODUCTION
There has never been a significant dispute here. GSC has never disputed that Big
State delivered fuel at GSC’s behest and that GSC would have to pay for that fuel.

GSC’s only defense was that it had not yet been paid for the fuel itself. GSC offered a
confession of judgment for the full amount sought before the litigation even commenced,
made the same offer several times thereafter, and eventually simply confessed judgment
to avoid further unnecessary litigation expense.
Big State, however, rejected reasonable efforts at resolution at every turn, insisting
instead on wasteful and vexatious litigation, asserting dozens of misguided discovery
requests and filing two entirely unnecessary motions to compel. The fact that Big State,
through its own vexatious, obstreperous, and overly litigious approach, managed to incur
tens of thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees in a case where no attorney’s fees were in
fact necessary is not fairly laid at GSC’s doorstep. At most, Big State should be awarded
the standard percentage under Alaska Civil Rule 82. More appropriately, any attorneys’
fee award should be significantly reduced to account for Big State’s improper approach.
I.

ALASKA CIVIL RULE 82 STANDARDS
This Court applies Alaska Civil Rule 82 to diversity matters.1 That Rule allows,

in a case where a money judgment is recovered, an award of a varying percentage of the
total amount of the judgment.2 The court may adjust the award downward based on
several considerations, including the complexity of the litigation, the reasonableness of

the hours expended, the reasonableness of the claims pursued, the relationship between
the amount of work performed and the matters at stake, and vexatious conduct.3

II.

BIG STATE’S CONTINUED REFUSAL OF OFFERS TO CONFESS
JUDGMENT WAS VEXATIOUS AND UNREASONABLE
There was never any need to litigate this case:
• GSC has never disputed that it would have to pay the amounts GSC sought.
• Prior to this litigation, GSC offered a settlement consisting of a confession
of judgment for the full amount sought with a covenant not to execute so
long as GSC met the terms of a payment plan.4 Big State refused.
• Twice more during the course of the litigation, GSC again offered a
settlement consisting of a confession of judgment for the full amount
sought and a payment plan, but with a higher up-front payment of $20,000.
Big State refused.
• Big State’s ultimate refusal to accept a confessed judgment was based on
the remarkable justification that “your client’s settlement offer is really to
only pay $20,000 and then let Big State have a worthless judgment.”5
• Big State even opposed GSC’s request, made at oral argument on one of
Big State’s motions to compel, for the Court to enter a confessed judgment
without any conditions.

that a party can get through litigation is a judgment. Big State was offered a judgment in

A confession of judgment is the gold standard of litigation settlement offers. All

its favor for the full amount sought before it spent a dime litigating this case, and several

more times after that. Big State refused these offers of a judgment in its favor along with
significant upfront payments, deriding the offered judgment as “worthless.” It instead
chose to both refuse the upfront money and incur significant attorneys’ fees in order to
get … the same judgment! Big State even went so far as to oppose, at oral argument on
its motion to compel, GSC’s offer to simply confess judgment without any covenant not
to execute. This bears repeating: Big State was offered, in open court, all of the relief
that it could obtain in this matter without need to litigate further, and it opposed GSC’s
request.
Big State’s insistence on litigating, even when there was no substantive reason to
litigate, took vexatiousness to an unreasonable and nearly incomprehensible extreme.
Big State’s efforts appear intended to maximize, rather than minimize the fees incurred.
GSC’s offers rendered Big State’s extensive work on the case unnecessary, as it was
offered all the relief it could get for no expenditure at all. Big State’s inability to take
“yes” for an answer does not merit compensation in the form of an attorney’s fee award
under the standards set forth in Alaska Civil Rule 82(b)(3)(A), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (J).
III.

BIG STATE’S DISCOVERY POSITIONS WERE UNREASONABLE
The lion’s share of the work done by attorneys in this case was related to Big

State’s discovery jihad, which was both unnecessarily overdone and unreasonably
litigious. Again, Big State’s efforts in this regard do not merit any compensation, but
rather a reduction.

In a case where the essential facts were not contested, Big State issued dozens of
discovery requests. As set forth in the briefing on Big State’s motions to compel, many
of Big State’s discovery requests were simply misguided – seeking information, for
example, on the wrong contract, and demanding banking and customer account
information not related to the issues between the parties in this case.6 While discovery is
certainly broad, Big State made no efforts to keep the issues in this case narrow, even
though GSC had essentially conceded liability and damages.
Moreover, Big State’s motions to compel in this matter were “necessitated” only
by its own unreasonableness. First, most of GSC’s objections to the production of
documents were based on the need for a reasonable protective order.7 As made clear in
the briefing, GSC agreed to produce documents once a protective order was in place. Big
State, however, tied up the process based on its patently unreasonable insistence that such
protective order could not limit the use of documents produced thereunder to the present
case. As noted in the briefing, every protective order necessarily contains such a
provision, because without it the order is inherently ineffective. Big State’s opposition to
this necessary provision could only have been based on pure contentiousness or a lack of
understanding of protective orders generally, but was in either event unreasonable.

The same is true of, for example, Big State’s position on production of
information regarding the specific contract at issue. As discussed in the briefing on Big
State’s motion to compel, Big State simply got the contract number wrong in its

discovery requests. Instead of simply issuing new or corrected discovery requests,
however, Big State sought unnecessary court intervention through a motion to compel.
The Court, of course, simply instructed Big State to send out interrogatories with the right
contract number – the same thing GSC told it to do in the first instance. This level of
obstreperousness was, again, simply unreasonable.
Nor did the lesson sink in. Even after the motion to compel led to predictable
results, Big State issued new discovery requests, and got the contract number wrong
again.8 Again, Big State chose to be obstreperous first, in lieu of paying attention to the
substance of the matter.
Again, these are factors supporting a downward departure under Alaska Civil Rule
82(b)(3)(A), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (J).
CONCLUSION
This brief is not intended to be a comprehensive list, but simply to demonstrate
that the fact that this was not a matter that needed to be litigated at all did not stop Big
State from over-litigating from start to finish. Big State’s approach to the case was
unreasonably vexatious and contentious. It took up the Court’s time with unnecessary
discovery motions and asserted unreasonable positions regarding such motions. It

obstreperously refused GSC’s various offers to confess judgment at no additional cost to
Big State, preferring instead to force the parties to incur costs and attorneys’ fees (and to
force the Court to spend unnecessary time and resources) to obtain the same result. GSC

could not avoid being dragged into court on this matter – it could not force Big State to
accept the judgment by confession that the Court eventually entered. GSC should not,
however, have to pay attorneys’ fees simply because Big State was unreasonably
contentious. Big State’s Motion should be denied.
