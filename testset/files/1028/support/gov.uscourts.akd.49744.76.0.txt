CASE NO. 4:13-cv-00029-TMB
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION AND
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
Plaintiff Big State Logistics Inc. asks the Court to award it full reasonable attorney’s fees
in this case under ARCP 82, because the Defendant Government Services’ defense that it had not
yet been paid for the bulk gasoline delivered by Plaintiff Big State was completely false.
Plaintiff Big State seeks an award of its actual reasonable fees in the amount of $32,167 for the
litigation of this case. Total Attorney hours for Robert Sparks are 109.04 hours at $250 per hour
and 11.9 hours for FOIA specialist Stephen Reed from Smith Currie & Hancock in Atlanta,
Geogia, at $425 per hour. See Robert A. Sparks Aff.
A. Introduction.
Plaintiff is Big State Logistics Inc. an Alaska Corporation. Plaintiff Big State filed suit in
September 2013, seeking to recover for $155,054.39 worth of gasoline that it had delivered to
Joint Base Elmendorf/Richardson at the request of Defendant Government Services Corp.

Docket 4, Amended Complaint, Docket 9, Affidavit of Mervin Gilbertson. Plaintiff Big State
also sought prejudgment attachment of the amount due from Defendant Government Services.
Docket 8 and 9. Defendant contended in its Answer and in its sworn affidavit from Matt Ruck
that it had not yet been paid by the United States for the gasoline delivered by Plaintiff Big State.
Docket 18, 19. Based on Matt Ruck’s affidavit denying that the United States had paid for the
fuel, the District Court denied Plaintiff Big State’s Motion for Prejudgment Attachment. Docket
35.
Government Services managing agent, Matt Ruck, has two felony convictions for crimes
involving dishonesty within the last six (6) years, including felony forgery and felony bad checks.
Docket 53, exhibit 1 and 2.
On March 27, 2014, Defendant Government Services filed a Motion of Confession of
Judgment. Docket 64. On April 4, 2014, the Court entered a judgment in favor of Plaintiff Big
State against Defendant Government Services in the amount of $155,054.39.

Defendant

Government Services filed its Motion to Confess judgment, because it knew that Plaintiff Big
State would shortly be in receipt of an affidavit to establish that the invoices submitted by
Defendant Government Services to the United States for the fuel supplied by Plaintiff had all
been paid to Defendant Government Services prior to Plaintiff Big State’s lawsuit being filed in
September 2013. See Affidavit of Robert A. Sparks and Affidavit of Cedric D. Davis (Exhibits
A - P to Mr. Davis’ affidavit). In short, Defendant Government Services Corp.’s defense to the
case was a fraud and a sham, it had been paid by the United States for the fuel prior to the
Plaintiff’s lawsuit being filed. See Affidavit of Robert A. Sparks and Affidavit of Cedric D.
Davis (Exhibits A - P to Mr. Davis’ affidavit).
B. Plaintiff Big State is Entitled to Fees Under ARCP 82.
A federal court sitting in diversity must apply state law in determining whether the
prevailing party is entitled to attorneys' fees. See Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Law Offices of Conrado
Joe Sayas, Jr., 250 F.3d 1234, 1236 (9th Cir.2001). The minimum fee award Plaintiff Big State

should receive under ARCP 82 would be $13,803.24 for contested without trial.1 However,
Plaintiff Big State seeks award of its actual attorney’s fees in litigating this case under A.R.C.P.
82, because Government Services Corp.’s defense that it had not been paid by the federal
government for the fuel it purchased from Plaintiff Big State was completely false and frivolous.
“Rule 82(b)(3) lists factors that may permit a court to depart from a partial fees award
calculated under Rule 82(b)(1) and (2), and to award enhanced or even full reasonable fees.”
Johnson v. Johnson, 239 P.3d 393, 399 (Alaska 2010). The trial court may award full reasonable
fees when a defense was frivolous, vexatious or in bad faith. Id. Defendant Government
Services falsely maintained though out the litigation of this case that it had not yet been paid by
the United States for the fuel it purchased from Plaintiff Big State. Docket 18, 19, 30, 31.
C. Government Services Corp. Was Fully Paid By The United States.
Prior to the filing of this lawsuit by Plaintiff Big State, Defendant Government Services
had been fully paid for all of the fuel delivered by Plaintiff Big State to JBER at Defendant’s
request. Defendant Government Service’s denials that it had been paid are completely false.
Defendant Government Services Corp. identified its unpaid invoices for the fuel
submitted by Plaintiff Big State as the following invoices numbers:
date

11322-3268

$39,264.46

Exhibit 1, Grisham letter 2/5/2014. The dates that the fuel was delivered by Plaintiff Big State to
JBER were as follows:
June 26, 2013
July 11, 2013

1

ARCP 82(b)(1): 25,000 x 18% = $4,500; $75,000 x 8% = $6,000; $55,054.39 x 6% =
$3,303.24). $4,500 + $6,000 + $3,303.24 = $13,803.24

the Government Information Specialist for the United States Defense Financial Accounting
Service. See Davis Affidavit. Mr. Davis certifies that the documents attached to his affidavit as
Exhibit s A - P are true copies of original records maintained by the Defense Financial
Accounting Service concerning “contract no. SP0600-11-D-4009, that were requested by Big
State Logistics, Inc.” See Davis Aff. Mr. Davis further certifies that the documents were kept in
the course of the regularly conducted business activity of the DFAS and were prepared as a
regular practice or custom. See Davis Affidavit
Exhibit A to Mr. Davis’ Affidavit shows that Defendant Government Services invoice no.

15, 2013.

On Exhibit O, the goods receipt number is

used as the “”invoice number” and the document shows that Defendant Government Services
was paid for the fuel delivery on September 3, 2013. Davis Aff. Ex. O. Exhibit P to Mr. Davis’
Affidavit shows that the delivery date for the fuel that Defendant Government Services was paid
for on September 3, 2013, was July 30, 2013. Davis Aff., Ex. P. This is the same date as the
last delivery by Plaintiff Big State to JBER. See docket 9, Gilbertson Aff.
There is no reasonable dispute that Defendant Government Services Corp. was fully paid
by the United States for the fuel delivered by Plaintiff Big State Logistics, Inc. no later than
September 3, 2013. See Davis Aff, Exhibits A-P. Defendant’s defense that it had not been paid
by the United States for the fuel delivered by Plaintiff Big State, is completely false and
frivolous. Plaintiff Big State seeks recovery of its reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in this
case in the total amount of $32,167.00. See Robert A. Sparks Affidavit.
While Defendant may continue to contend that the case was “overlitigated” Plaintiff Big
State, Plaintiff relies on the attached affidavit of attorney Mark P. Melchert. Mark P. Melchert

creditor, Coville, Inc. in District of Alaska case no. 3-12-cv-000232. Defendant Government
Services confessed judgment that it owed Coville $345,727 and had agreed to make installment

Case 4:13-cv-00029-TMB Document 76 Filed 04/18/14 Page 5 of 7

payments. Melchert Aff. Mr. Melchert explains that Defendant Government Services only paid
Coville a little over $100,000 and the quit making instalment payments. Melchert Aff.
Following entry of judgment, Mr. Melchert has been unable to contact Mr. Ruck or anyone else
from Government Services and has been unable to locate any assets from which to collect
Coville’s judgment. See Melchert Aff.
Significantly, Plaintiff Big State obtained entry of a discovery order in the present case
compelling Defendant Government Services to disclose the location, name and account number
of its bank. Docket 63.
CONCLUSION

false, frivolous and bad faith defense alleged by Defendant Government Services in this case.

167 for 109.04 hours by attorney Robert Sparks and 11.9 hours for FOIA specialist Stephen Reed
