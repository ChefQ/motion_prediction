GOVERNMENT?'S RESPONSE TO APPLICANT'S MOTION FOR

COMES NOW the United States Attorney, by and through his undersigned assistant, and
files this response to Applicant's Motion for Copies of All Letters Submitted m Connection with

the Court prior to the Defendant's sentencing. In light of the cases cited by the Applicant, we
would ask that any personal identifying information be redacted from the letters beforehand and
that the Court keep certam letters under seal, such as those reflecting "medical information from
health care providers, information which may lead to harassment from the defendant, and other
information for which good cause is shown." United States v. Langston, 2008 WL 5156625 at *1
