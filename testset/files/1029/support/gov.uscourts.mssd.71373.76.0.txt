APPLICATION/MOTION FOR COPIES OF ALL LETTERS SUBMITTED IN CONNECTION
WITH DEFENDANT’S SENTENCING
COMES NOW Curtis Flowers, Applicant/Movant, through counsel, and pursuant to the
First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, seeks
an order from this Court granting him access to Attachment 1 to Document 70 in the above
styled and numbered matter (presentencing letters attached to Presentence Investigation Report),
as well as any other presentencing letters or other communications from any person concerning
sentencing of Defendant in the instant matter submitted to, referred to or considered by the Court
in connection with sentencing proceedings herein, and the right to obtain copies of same, and in
support thereof would show as follows:
1.

The indictment in the instant prosecution of PATRICIA ANN SULLIVAN a/k/a

Patricia Hallmon Sullivan a/k/a Patricia Odom Sullivan (hereafter “Sullivan”) was filed on or
about February 10, 2010 alleging the commission by Sullivan of multiple violations of 26 U.S.C.
§ 7206(2), Assisting in the Preparation of False Tax Returns, over the period between April 2005
and February 2008. On or about September 30, 2010, Patricia Ann Sullivan Defendant a/k/a
Patricia Hallmon Sullivan, a/k/a Patricia Odom (hereafter “Sullivan”) was convicted after trial by
jury on eight counts of Assisting in the Preparation of False Tax Returns in violation of 26 U.S.C

Page 1 of 6

§ 7206(2) under the February 17, 2010 indictment.

On or about January 5, 2011 this Court held

a sentencing hearing and sentenced Sullivan to a term of incarceration on those convictions. The
transcript of that hearing, redacted of identifying information regarding innocent parties in
accordance with local rules, is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1 to this
Motion (hereafter “Sent. Tr.”).
2.

As Exhibit 1 reveals, while Sullivan was under indictment in this matter, on or

about June 18, 2010, Applicant Curtis Flowers (hereafter “Flowers”) was convicted of four
counts of capital murder, and on June 19, 2010, was sentenced to death on all four of those
conviction in Case No. 2003-0071-CR in Montgomery County, Mississippi. Defendant Sullivan
was a material witness for the State of Mississippi against Mr. Flowers, testifying in that matter
on or about June 12, 2010, during the pendency of the charges in the instant matter against
Sullivan, and in five others that preceded it, including testimony given during three proceedings
relevant to the Flowers prosecution occurring during the time frame covered by the indictment in
the instant matter. Sent. Tr. at 54-56. 1
3.

Exhibit 1 also reveals that at Sullivan’s sentencing hearing before this court, the

presentencing letters sought to be disclosed were considered and made part of the Presentence
Investigation Report by this Court,including but not limited to presentencing letters submitted
under cover of a presentencing letter from the Doug Evans, the District Attorney for the
Mississippi Fifth Circuit Court District, the prosecuting attorney in the Montgomery County
prosecution of applicant. Sent. Tr. at 6. There was also allocution by Defendant Sullivan herself,
1

Post-trial motions in the Montgomery County prosecution of Applicant, including the motion for a new trial, were
finally disposed of on August 4, 2010. A notice of appeal of that matter was timely filed thereafter by Mr. Flowers,
and his conviction and sentence is presently pending in Mississippi Supreme Court Case No. 2010-DP-01248-SCT
on the mandatory appeal required in all cases in which a death sentence has been imposed. The record in that matter
was not, however, filed with the Mississippi Supreme Court until February 14, 2012. This motion is made as soon
as practical after that filing, which provided the official record of what makes access to the sentencing comment
letters in Defendant Sullivan’s case necessary for the reasons stated in this motion.

and the factual statements of one of her counsel, a former assistant district attorney in Mr. Evans’
office, concerning Sullivan’s role as an investigative source and witness in the Montgomery
County Flowers prosecutions as a factor warranting mitigation of Sullivan’s sentence in the
instant matter. Sent. Tr. at 54-56.
4.

Mississippi recognizes the clear possibility that a witness facing his or her own

criminal difficulties may be a significantly less reliable witness than one not facing such issues,
and does not hesitate to ensure that any jury hearing such testimony is aware of those
circumstances. Moore v. State, 787 So. 2d 1282 (Miss. 2001), McNeal v. State, 551 So. 2d 151,
158 n.2 (Miss. 1989). See also Dedeaux v. State, 87 So. 664, 665 (Miss. 1921) (citing Wilson v.
State, 71 Miss. 880, 16 So. 304 (1894). Even without an agreement, if a witness is only hoping
for some sort of benefit in her own criminal problems, such hopes may serve an even greater
incentive for her to have testified more favorably to the State than otherwise. 2
5.

The foregoing factual and legal matters raise an issue in the pending State

prosecution against Flowers that may need to be litigated in the state courts relating to
nondisclosure of information concerning prosecution of Sullivan in the instant matter prior to
Sullivan’s testimony in the pending State prosecution. These issues arise under the Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and/or under applicable Mississippi
law relating to discovery and disclosure in criminal proceedings. Disclosure of the documents

2

State and federal courts recognize the importance of disclosure of this kind of information as fundamental
according a criminal accused his rights to due process and to a fair trial. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676-77 Hughes v.
State, 735 So. 2d 238, 253 (Miss. 1999); Malone v. State, 486 So. 2d 367, 368 (Miss. 1986). See also Strickler v.
Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 282 n. 21 (1999) (“[o]ur cases make clear that Brady’s disclosure requirements extend to
materials that, whatever their other characteristics, may be used to impeach a witness”); Little v. State, 736 So. 2d
486, 489 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999) (duty of State to investigate and disclose). See also Arizona v. Youngblood, 488
U.S. 51, 58 (1988)).

sought herein is required in order that Applicant Flowers and his state counsel may determine
whether such issues in fact exist, and to litigate them appropriately in the event they do. 3
6.

All Courts must observe a heightened level of regard for the substantive and

procedural rights of a capitally charged individual. Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 290,
305 (1976); Simmons v. State, 805 So.2d 452, 472 (Miss.2001).

See also Caldwell v.

Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 329-330 (1985); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978)
(“qualitative difference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability
when the death sentence is imposed”).

This applies not only to matters pertaining to the

sentencing phase of such proceedings, but also, under both federal and Mississippi state law, to
the culpability phase as well. See Murray v. Giarrantano, 492 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1989) (citing cases
pertaining to determination of guilt rather than only sentencing); Flowers v. State, 842 So.2d
531 (Miss. 2003) (reversal of earlier conviction of Applicant in same matter, citing heightened
scrutiny standard and reversing conviction for numerous culpability phase errors including
Batson violation by the prosecution).
7.

For the foregoing reasons, Flowers respectfully that he has made a “compelling

demonstration that disclosure . . . . is required to meet the ends of justice.” U.S. Dept. of Justice
v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1, 13 (1988), and in particular his needs under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth
3

See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995) ((Due process right to receive information impeaching of State’s
witnesses). Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973) (Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses). See also
United States v. Garcia, 531 F.2d 1303, 1306-07 (5th Cir. 1976)), Blankenship v. Estelle, 545 F.2d 510, 513 (5th
Cir. 1977) (specifically including information that a prosecutors’ witness has been arrested or charged in any other
proceeding). See also Love v. State, 441 So. 2d 1353, 1355-57 (Miss. 1983); Little v. State, 736 So. 2d 486, 489
(Miss. Ct. App. 1999) (citing Boches v. State, 506 So. 2d 254, 263 (Miss. 1987)) Gowdy v. State, 592 So. 2d 29, 35
(Miss. 1991) In Re J.E., 726 So. 2d 547, 550 (Miss. 1998) (Mississippi constitutional law). See also Uniform
Circuit and County Court Rules applicable to criminal prosecutions in the state of Mississippi. UCCCR 9.04A.6
(requiring disclosure of impeaching or exculpatory information regarding State’s witnesses), Miss. R. Evid. 608(b)
(permitting impeachment by cross examination with prior conduct indicative of dishonesty other than convictions).
The record in the Montgomery County prosecution of Applicant reveals that despite the foregoing law, and an order
requiring provision of updated NCIC-type criminal history to the defense regarding all States’ witnesses, the
existence of Sullivan’s pending federal charges or the fraudulent conduct underlying them was not disclosed to
Applicant Flowers by the State of Mississippi. at any time prior to or during the June 2010 testimony of Sullivan.

Amendments to his defense of the matter in which the defendant in the instant matter was a
witness. Disclosure of sentencing letters to the general public, which is not sought in the instant
motion, has been approved in other prosecutions in the federal courts located in the State of
Mississippi, even where the constitutional considerations pertaining to Applicant’s situation
exist. See, e.g., U.S. v Langston, No. 1:08-cr-00003-MPM-JAD, 2008 WL 5156625 (N.D.Miss.
December 8, 2008, Order) and U.S. v. Scruggs, No. 3:07CR00192-B-A, 2008 WL 2559384
(N.D.Miss. June 23, 2008, Order)) (neither reported in F. Supp. 2nd). 4
8.

To the extent that Sullivan’s privacy interests are implicated, her position as a

state’s witness in the state prosecution, and her claiming and making testimonial statements and
offering sentencing support letters regarding that participation in mitigation of sentence for her
own criminal activities, effectively waives those protections in any event.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Applicant Curtis Flowers moves for an
Order from this Court granting him access to and the right to obtain copies of Attachment 1 to
Document 70 in the above styled and numbered matter (presentencing letters attached to
Presentence Investigation Report), as well as any other presentencing letters or other
communications from any person concerning sentencing of Defendant in the instant matter
submitted to, referred to or considered by the Court in connection with sentencing proceedings
herein, subject to an appropriate protective order protecting the identity of innocent parties and
victims in the instant matter, if this Court finds that to be desirable.
Respectfully submitted,
CURTIS FLOWERS, Applicant/Movant

Moreover, on information and belief, the courts of the Southern District of Mississippi have, subsequent to treating
those letters in Sullivan’s matter as part of the non-publically available presentence investigation report, adopted a
policy of treating presentencing letters like most other pleadings and documents in criminal matter and filing them in
the publically available record. Disclosure of those letters to Applicant would therefore be consistent with present
policy.
