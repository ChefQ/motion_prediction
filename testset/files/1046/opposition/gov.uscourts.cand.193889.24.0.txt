INTRODUCTION
Endeca’s proposal to indefinitely stay this patent infringement litigation (the “Office Depot

Action”) is precisely opposite to what should be done procedurally to promote judicial economy.

4

Earlier filed, related Case No. C06-7336 PJH, SpeedTrack, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores (“Wal-

5

Mart Action”), in which Endeca intervened, originally contained infringement claims against an

6

internet retailer (Wal-Mart) and various GPS providers (Toyota, Hertz and Magellan Navigation).

7

The claims against the GPS providers have all been settled through the licensing of the SpeedTrack

8

patents by those now-dismissed defendants. The only remaining parties adverse to SpeedTrack in

9

the Wal-Mart Action are Wal-Mart and intervenor Endeca. Wal-Mart is the direct infringer; Endeca

10

contributes to and induces that infringement by providing the technology by which the patented

11

methods are practiced by Wal-Mart.

12

A host of internet retailers are infringing SpeedTrack’s patents, including many retailers

13

which use Endeca’s technology (Endeca Technology Retailers or “ETRs”). To promote judicial

14

economy and to precipitate a resolution with all infringing ETRs (since Endeca has indemnified

15

such retailers), SpeedTrack filed the Office Depot Action against six ETRs and filed an

16

administrative motion to have the Office Depot Action related to the Wal-Mart Action. It only made

17

sense, for example, that the claim construction rulings in the Wal-Mart Action apply with equal

18

force to the Office Depot Action.

19
20

By its motion, Endeca seeks to prevent the realization of the judicial economics intended by
the related case filing.

21

Rather than stay the present case as requested by the defendants and prejudice SpeedTrack,

22

given the admitted overlap of issues, judicial economy is best served by consolidation (at least for

23

purposes of discovery and claim construction) of this case with the Wal-Mart action. In fact,

24

SpeedTrack has proposed such a consolidation with appropriate changes to the discovery and trial

25

schedule.

LEGAL STANDARDS ON A MOTION TO STAY LITIGATION
A court has the inherent power to stay proceedings in order “to control the disposition of the

causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”

Landis v. North Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). This power “calls for the exercise of judgment,

2

which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance.” Id., 299 U.S. at 254-55;

3

Cherokee Nation v. U.S., 124 F.3d 1413, 1416 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (reversing a trial court’s indefinite

4

stay and stating: “[A] trial court must first identify a pressing need for the stay. The court must then

5

balance interests favoring a stay against interests frustrated by the action. Overarching this balancing

6

is the court’s paramount obligation to exercise jurisdiction timely in cases properly before it.”); see

7

also Conroy v. Fresh Del Monte Produce, Inc., 325 F.Supp.2d 1049, 1053-54 (N.D.Cal. 2004).

In determining whether to stay proceedings, the Court considers the following FACTORS:
(1) judicial economy; (2) the moving party’s hardship; and (3) potential prejudice to the non-moving

10

party. Landis, 299 U.S. at 254-55; Cherokee Nation, 124 F.3d at 1416; Single Chip Sys. Corp. v.

11

Intermec IP Corp., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50708, at *10 (S.D. Cal. 2007). As the parties moving

12

for a stay, Defendants must show “a compelling reason to stay this case.” Nichols Inst. Diagnostics,

13

Inc. v. Scantibodies Clinical Lab., Inc., 218 F. Supp. 2d 1243 (S.D. Cal. 2002); Landis, 299 U.S. at

14

255 (“… the suppliant for a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required

15

to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to

16

some one else.”).

ARGUMENT
A.

Defendants’ Motion to Stay Should Be Denied Because Defendants Have Not
Shown That Bifurcation Is Clearly Necessary in This Case

19
20
21

1.

A stay does not promote judicial economy

Indefinitely staying discovery and trial in the present case is inimical to judicial economy

22

and will only serve to multiply proceedings before this Court thereby requiring duplication of effort

23

by the parties and the Court. Defendants’ claim that judicial economy is served by a stay is based

24

upon its assertion that resolution of the Wal-Mart Action will resolve this case. That is true only if

25

Wal-Mart wins on grounds equally applicable to the Office Depot Action defendants. While it is

26

true that SpeedTrack would be bound by any finding of patent invalidity or unenforceability, absent

27

coordination or consolidation, defendants in the Office Depot Action are not bound by this Court’s

28

determinations relating to claim construction, patent validity, patent infringement, patent
-2OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY THIS LITIGATION

Case 3:07-cv-03602-PJH

1

enforceability or damages in the Wal-Mart Action. Accordingly, if SpeedTrack prevails in the Wal-

2

Mart action, SpeedTrack and the Court will have to reprise all claim construction and liability issues

3

all over again. Putting aside the obvious prejudice and unnecessary cost to SpeedTrack, such

4

multiple proceedings are not in the interest of judicial economy. Rather than a stay, tailored

5

consolidation best serves the interests of judicial economy.

6

The cases cited by defendants for the proposition that “manufacturer” suits take precedence

7

over “customer” suits which should be stayed do not apply to this case. Rather, in contrast to this

8

case, in each of those cited cases the patentee was also asserting direct infringement against the

9

“manufacturer who had supplied the customer infringing products.” For example, in Leviton, the

1

10

defendant purchased ground-fault-circuit-interrupter outlets from a manufacturer, and simply re-sold

11

those outlets. Similarly in Corning Glass, the Court of Claims ruled that the infringement issues

12

were identical in plaintiff’s suits against a catalog item manufacturer and the United States

13

government, which had purchased and used those catalog items.

14

Here, Endeca is not a direct infringer of the targeted conduct, and the asserted claims are

15

method claims only. The issue of infringement in this case will turn on the operation of each

16

Defendant’s website, each of which is different from one another. Therefore, the economy or

17

feasibility of proceeding with a “manufacturer” suit first, where the manufacturer is selling the same

18

product as the customer, is not present here. Notably, in the only Federal Circuit case cited by

19

Defendants for the proposition that “manufacturer” suits should proceed before “customer” suits –

20

Katz v. Lear Stigler, Inc., 909 F.3d 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1990) – the Federal Circuit actually reversed a

21

district court’s grant of a stay of litigation against a so-called “customer” because of such

22

“differences in the various suits.” Id at 1463. In Katz, the Federal Circuit reasoned that certain

23

issues in one suit would not be resolved in the other suit, and “[t]here is no good reason to unduly

24

delay the resolution of [such] issues,” especially in light of “[t]he public policy favoring expeditious

25

resolution of disputes … dealing with wasting assets such as patents.” Id at 1463-64.

26

2.

27

A stay of the litigation would be unfair and prejudicial to SpeedTrack

Prejudice to the non-moving party is also a factor that must be considered by a court in

1

deciding a motion to stay a litigation indefinitely. Cherokee Nation v. U.S., 124 F.3d at 1416 (“The

2

court must then balance interests favoring a stay against interests frustrated by the action.”) A stay

3

of this litigation, proposed by Defendants in this case, would result in at least three material forms of

4

prejudice to SpeedTrack.

5

First, it would prevent cost saving coordination and consolidation. SpeedTrack would suffer

6

the practical prejudice inherent in any divided proceeding, especially in a case such as this where the

7

evidence and issues substantially overlap. Such prejudice is well-established in the case law and

8

includes additional delays, greater litigation costs, extra discovery disputes, and the burden and

9

inconvenience of presenting the same evidence more than once. See, e.g., Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Barr

10

Labs., Inc., 218 F.R.D. 387, 393 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Real v. Bunn-O-Matic Corp., 195 F.R.D. 618,

11

624 (N.D.Ill. 2000); Monaghan v. SZS 33 Assocs., L.P., 827 F. Supp. 233, 246 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).

12

Secondly, SpeedTrack would suffer the prejudice of being forced to defend its patent’s

13

validity multiple times, while each Defendant (represented by the same counsel) each sequentially

14

tries to invalidate the ‘360 patent. If the Defendants’ requested stay is granted, SpeedTrack will be

15

required to argue issues like claim construction and patent validity multiple times. If SpeedTrack

16

were to lose its claim construction or validity arguments even once, SpeedTrack could be precluded

17

from arguing those issues again. At the same time, each Defendant could argue these issues anew.

18

Speedtrack could also be subject to inconsistent rulings, as each defendant may argue for different

19

claim constructions.

20

Thirdly, SpeedTrack’s interest (as well as the public’s interest) in expeditious resolution of

21

disputes dealing with wasting assets such as patents would be frustrated. See Katz, 909 F.2d at

22

1463-64.

23

3.

Defendants have not shown that they will suffer any prejudice or
hardship if this litigation is not stayed

24
25

As discussed above, the moving parties’ hardship or prejudice is one factor to be considered

26

in ruling on a motion to bifurcate or motion to stay. Landis, 299 U.S. at 254-55; Cherokee Nation,

27

124 F.3d at 1416-18; Single Chip Sys. Corp., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50708, at *10. Defendants

28

here do not even contend that they would be prejudiced or suffer hardship if their motion for stay is

denied. Their chief complaint is that SpeedTrack is trying to encourage Endeca to settle this

2

litigation by seeking to enforce its patent against Endeca’s clients. That complaint does not

3

constitute legally cognizable prejudice for the purpose of Endeca’s motion. SpeedTrack is entitled

4

to sue and to threaten to sue infringers of its patent.

5

IV.

6

CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, Defendants motions to stay should be denied.
