MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

Pursuant to Civil Local Rules 7-2 and 7-4, Defendants Office Depot, CDW, Newegg,

3

Circuit City, PC Connection, and CompUSA respectively submit this Memorandum of Points And

4

Authorities in support of their Motion to Stay.3

I.

INTRODUCTION
On November 29, 2006, Plaintiff SpeedTrack, Inc. (“SpeedTrack”) filed suit for patent

6
7

infringement against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) in this Court, alleging that certain search

8

functionality on Wal-Mart’s retail website infringed U.S. Patent No. 5,544,360 (“the ‘360

9

Patent”).4 Because Wal-Mart is a customer of Endeca Technologies, Inc. (“Endeca”), and in view

10

of several dozen letters sent by SpeedTrack to other Endeca customers charging them all with

11

infringement, Endeca moved to intervene in the suit on March 13, 2007. The Court allowed

12

Endeca’s intervention on April 12, 2007, and Endeca has since participated fully in the litigation

13

in defense of its customer, Wal-Mart.

14

On July 11, 2007, after an unsuccessful mediation between SpeedTrack and Endeca,

15

SpeedTrack filed a second complaint against six additional Endeca customers – the six defendants

16

in this action. SpeedTrack’s selection of the six Endeca customers sued here, and the timing of the

17

action, were no accident. In a letter sent to Endeca on the same day this suit was filed,

18

SpeedTrack’s counsel explained why it chose these customers and asked Endeca to reconsider its

19

settlement posture before more of its customers were dragged into litigation. According to

20

SpeedTrack’s counsel, the complaint was filed to encourage Endeca to enter into settlement talks:

Nothing contained in this motion shall be understood to be an admission as to any of the
allegations set forth in Plaintiff’s Complaint as filed on July 11, 2007 or as a waiver of any
defenses. Defendants Office Depot, CDW, Newegg, Circuit City, PC Connection, and CompUSA
expressly reserve the right to assert any and all available defenses and counterclaims in their
respective Answers, including but not limited to, the defenses of lack of personal and/or subject
matter jurisdiction, improper venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of process,
or failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
4

SpeedTrack’s Complaint also made allegations against Toyota, Hertz and Magellan for
their use of technology unrelated to Endeca’s. Those defendants have now been dismissed from
the case, leaving the case between SpeedTrack, Wal-Mart and Endeca.

“We hope that Endeca will view this new lawsuit as an opportunity to revisit the need to get

2

creative and serious about a global settlement with SpeedTrack.” (July 11, 2007 letter from R.

3

Dorman to S. Bauer, attached as Exh. A).5

4

The six defendants in this case, all Endeca customers, respectfully request that this Court

5

stay the present action pending resolution of the dispute between SpeedTrack and Endeca in the

6

previously-filed Wal-Mart case. This case is more than six months behind the Wal-Mart case,

7

which involves the same patent and the same Endeca technology. The Wal-Mart case will resolve

8

the same legal and factual questions at issue here relating to the validity of the ‘360 Patent and

9

whether Endeca’s technology infringes the patent. Resolution of the substantive liability issues

10

before this Court in the Wal-Mart case should proceed before subjecting six additional Endeca

11

customers to the harassment and expense of litigating in parallel.
A stay here would avoid potentially needless litigation without prejudicing SpeedTrack’s

12
13

legal rights in any way. If Endeca succeeds in the action against SpeedTrack, this second case will

14

be for naught. On the other hand, if SpeedTrack succeeds in its case against Endeca, it is highly

15

likely the customer suits will settle quickly, because the primary issue remaining will be a

16

valuation of damages.

17

For these reasons, this Court should exercise its discretion to stay the customer suits

18

against Defendants pending resolution of the dispute between SpeedTrack and Endeca.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Endeca is a Massachusetts-based venture-capital-backed company that provides enterprise

21

information access solutions to a wide range of customers, including a number of online retail

22

clients. Each of the six customer-defendants in this suit (and Wal-Mart) have obtained customized

23

solutions from Endeca built on Endeca’s patented Information Access Platform.
SpeedTrack’s original complaint against Endeca’s customer, Wal-Mart, alleged that Wal-

24

26
27
28

Mart directly infringes the ‘360 Patent by providing certain search functionality on its

www.Walmart.com website. (SpeedTrack’s Complaint for Patent Infringement, Permanent

2

Injunction and Damages, dated November 29, 2006, ¶ 12, attached as Exh B). After SpeedTrack

3

sent dozens of infringement notice letters to other Endeca customers, Endeca intervened in the

4

Wal-Mart case, seeking a declaration from this Court that Endeca’s technology (and its customers’

5

use thereof) does not infringe the ‘360 Patent and that the patent is invalid. (Endeca Technology,

6

Inc.’s Complaint In Intervention, dated April 13, 2007, attached as Exh. C).

7

Well after the Wal-Mart suit was joined and validity and infringement contentions

8

exchanged, and after an unsuccessful mediation, on July 11, 2007, SpeedTrack filed this suit

9

against six more of Endeca’s customers – Office Depot, CDW, Newegg, Circuit City, PC

10

Connection, and CompUSA. SpeedTrack’s allegations again focus on technology developed and

11

supplied by Endeca for use on retail websites. (See, e.g., SpeedTrack’s Complaint For Patent

12

Infringement, Permanent Injunction, and Damages, ¶ 13).

13

In a letter sent by SpeedTrack’s counsel to Endeca’s counsel on the same day that

14

SpeedTrack filed its second complaint, SpeedTrack wrote the following to Endeca: “We hope that

15

Endeca will view this new lawsuit as an opportunity to revisit the need to get creative and serious

16

about a global settlement with SpeedTrack.” (Exh. A, p. 3). It is clear that SpeedTrack filed this

17

suit to pressure Endeca into a settlement. Since filing this suit, SpeedTrack has, in fact, continued

18

to harass Endeca’s customers, contacting customers directly contrary to instructions from their

19

outside counsel. (See August 17, 2007 Email correspondence between R. Berman and S. Grill,

20

attached as Exh. D).

ARGUMENT

23

This Court Should Exercise Its Discretion To Stay The Customer Suits Against
Defendants Pending Resolution Of The Dispute Between SpeedTrack and Endeca In
The Wal-Mart Case.

24

Courts have broad discretion when deciding whether to stay proceedings. Landis v. North

25

American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936); CMAX Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 (9th Cir.

1962) (“A district court has inherent power to control the disposition of the cases on its docket in a

2

manner which will promote economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”).

3

In the context of patent litigation, courts have long recognized that a dispute between a

4

patent holder and the manufacturer of accused goods should take precedence over suits brought by

5

the patent holder against customers of the manufacturer. See Katz v. Lear Siegler, Inc., 909 F.2d

6

1459, 1463-64 (Fed. Cir. 1990); Corning Glass Works v. United States, 220 Ct. Cl. 605, 607 (Ct.

7

Cl. 1979) (“Courts generally favor suits against the supplier, as primary defendant, over suits

8

against that supplier’s customers, even where the customer’s suit is filed first.”).

9

Moreover, courts routinely exercise their discretion to stay customer suits where the

10

manufacturer is the “true defendant” in the dispute. See Codex Corp. v. Milgo Elec. Corp., 553

11

F.2d 735, 737-38 (1st Cir. 1977) (“At the root of the preference for a manufacturer’s declaratory

12

judgment action is the recognition that, in reality, the manufacturer is the true defendant in the

13

customer suit . . . . a manufacturer must protect its customers, either as a matter of contract, or

14

good business, or in order to avoid the damaging impact of an adverse ruling against its

15

products.”); see also, Leviton Manuf. Co., Inc. v. Interline Brands Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

16

61944, at*5-11 (M.D. Fla. August, 30, 2006) (staying customer suit in favor of proceeding against

17

the manufacturer to determine validity and infringement); Honeywell Int’l Inc. v. Audiovox

Business Machine Security, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16064, at*4-5 (C.D. Cal. May 3, 1988)

(same); Probatter Sports, LLC v. Joyner Technologies, Inc., 463 F. Supp. 2d 949, 955-57 (N.D.

Ill. Sept. 15, 1988) (“The public interest is served by resolving a patent infringement claim in a

24

single suit against the manufacturer, rather than a multiplicity of actions against the

25

manufacturer’s customers.”).

1

The primary issue in determining whether to stay a suit by a patentee against the customers

2

of an alleged infringer is “whether or not an exercise of the Court’s discretion . . . would operate to

3

prevent needless litigation without substantial impairment of the patentee’s rights under the patent

4

law.” Wilbur v. Superior Concrete Accessories, 217 F. Supp. 600, 601 (N.D. Cal. 1963). A key

5

factor is whether resolution of the major issues in the suit against the manufacturer, including

6

infringement and patent validity, will resolve or advance the prosecution or resolution of these

7

issues in the customer suits. Katz, 909 F.2d at 1464.

8
9

In the instant case, staying a suit brought by SpeedTrack against six Endeca customers in
this action makes practical sense. Endeca is the true defendant, as they developed the technology

10

at issue and provided it to the customer Defendants for use on their retail websites, and is

11

defending that same technology in the Wal-Mart case. Further, the Wal-Mart case involves the

12

same patent and requires resolution of the same legal and factual questions. The resolution of the

13

major issues before this Court in the Wal-Mart case, including patent infringement and patent

14

validity, will significantly advance the prosecution or resolution of those issues in this case. See

15

Katz, 909 F.2d at 1464. Staying the proceedings against Defendants would, therefore, prevent

16

needless litigation and expense for these innocent bystanders, who were apparently brought into

17

this dispute solely to apply pressure to Endeca.

18

In addition, a stay of the customer suits here would not prejudice SpeedTrack in any way.

19

SpeedTrack should have the same interests in having the liability case resolved quickly and

20

without multiple proceedings. The stay sought here would not affect SpeedTrack’s ability to get a

21

speedy resolution of the liability issues in the Wal-Mart case. Granting this stay might even result

22

in a speedier resolution of the dispute between the new defendants.

23

Simultaneously with the filing of this motion, Endeca is filing a motion in the Wal-Mart

24

action, asking this Court to bifurcate and stay the damages portion of that case, so that the liability

25

issues there can be decided as efficiently and expeditiously as possible. Endeca believes it has

26

identified knock-out prior art that invalidates the SpeedTrack patent. Endeca, as a small venture-

1

capital backed business, has no interest in multiplying litigation proceedings, increasing expenses,

2

or delaying resolution of the dispute between it and SpeedTrack.

3

This action is more than six months behind the schedule set in the Wal-Mart case, which is

4

rapidly moving towards a Markman hearing on claim construction. A stay in this case would

5

serve to streamline the issues of liability and facilitate a faster settlement or dismissal. Indeed, in

6

Katz, the court recognized that “there may be additional issues involving the defendants in the

7

[customer suits],” but stated that “their prosecution will be advanced if [the patentee] is successful

8

on the major premises being litigated in [the suit against the manufacturer], and may well be

9

mooted if [the patentee] is unsuccessful.” Id.

10

The same holds true in this case. Resolution of the Wal-Mart case will either significantly

11

advance the major issues in this case, or render this case moot altogether.

12

IV.

CONCLUSION

13

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant its motion

14

to stay the proceedings pending resolution of the dispute between SpeedTrack and Endeca in the

15

Wal-Mart case.
