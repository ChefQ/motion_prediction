INTRODUCTION
Defendants City of Vallejo, Kenny Park, and Mathew Mustard (collectively,

3

“Defendants”) waged a public relations assault against two victims of horrific crimes in order to

4

provide cover for their own failed and inadequate investigation. Among the numerous

5

defamatory statements, Defendants publicly accused Plaintiffs Denise Huskins (“Huskins”) and

6

Aaron Quinn (“Quinn”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) of fabricating a kidnapping and sexual

7

assault, demanded an apology from Plaintiffs, and thereby lit the fuse to an international media

8

firestorm. Defendants set out to destroy Plaintiffs’ reputations and succeeded mightily. Yet

9

despite the fact that Defendants never had a shred of evidence in support of their wild

10

accusations (and indeed intentionally ignored all evidence inconsistent with them) and the fact

11

that an alleged kidnapper sits in jail awaiting trial for crimes he admitted to in emails and

12

jailhouse interviews, Defendants still maintain they did nothing wrong in publicly destroying

13

Plaintiffs’ lives and reputations.
By their motion to dismiss, Defendants do not seek to justify their conduct, nor do they

14
15

argue that their statements were true. Instead, Defendants seek to dismiss just some of the claims

16

against them, primarily by trying to stretch various state law privileges and immunities to the

17

breaking point. But law enforcement is not given free rein to abuse victims simply because such

18

conduct involves the same subject matter as a police investigation, and thus none of their

19

proffered privileges or immunities apply here. For example, nothing in Civil Code section 47(b)

20

covers gratuitous statements that perform no investigative function, such as statements to the

21

press or to officers’ friends and neighbors. Similarly, binding Ninth Circuit authority – which

22

Defendants do not so much as mention – holds that the immunity under Government Code

23

section 821.6 for “instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding” applies

24

only to claims for malicious prosecution. Defendant’s remaining arguments similarly lack merit

25

or are uncontested. Thus, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied.

BACKGROUND

27

A.

28

On March 23, 2015, Plaintiffs were sleeping at Quinn’s home, when one or more

PLAINTIFFS ARE VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED AND HUSKINS IS KIDNAPPED

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 11 Filed 08/25/16 Page 8 of 26

1

intruders 1 broke into the home, blindfolded Plaintiffs, bound their hands and feet, and drugged

2

them. (Compl. ¶ 12.) The assailant instructed Quinn that Huskins would be kidnapped for

3

ransom, that Quinn was being monitored, and that the assailant would harm Denise if Aaron

4

went to the police. (Id. ¶ 14.) The assailant followed through on his threats and took Denise.

5

(Id.). Quinn, confined to the couch, ultimately succumbed to sleep from effects of the strong

6

sedative the intruder had given him. (Id. ¶ 15.) When he awoke hours later he was terrified and

7

agonized for the next several hours about what to do. (Id.) He was afraid to leave the house or

8

call the police for fear that the kidnapper would harm Huskins. (Id.) In the intervening hours, he

9

received a number of texts and emails requesting a ransom for Huskins’s release. (Id.) He

10

ultimately called the Vallejo Police Department (“VPD”) to seek their help. (Id. ¶ 16.)

11

B.

DEFENDANTS IGNORE CRITICAL EVIDENCE AND AGGRESSIVELY INTERROGATE
QUINN FOR NEARLY 18 HOURS

12
13

VPD came to Quinn’s home and immediately acted as if Quinn was the criminal rather

14

than the victim, focused solely on irrelevant evidence they thought might implicate him (such as

15

whether he had held a “party” the night before), and ignored key evidence of the crime (such as

16

evidence of forced entry to the house and batteries and other items left by the true kidnapper).

17

(Id. ¶ 17.) Quinn then went with officers to the VPD station at 3:30 p.m., where he was

18

promptly and maliciously treated like he had already been convicted of murdering Huskins. (Id.

19

¶ 18.) VPD took Quinn’s clothing. (Id. ¶ 19.) In exchange, Quinn was given prison pants with

20

the words “Solano Prison” displayed on the side and a dirty white t-shirt, but no underwear or

21

socks. (Id.) They also took his blood and DNA. (Id.) The police placed Quinn in an

22

interrogation room, where he was cut off from any family or other visitors who would be able to

23

help him. (Id.) The room was accessible only to those who passed through doors with keypad

24

locks, and individuals who entered the room were required to offload their personal effects. (Id.)

25
26
27
28

1

Plaintiffs believed that there were multiple people involved, although only one assailant
(Matthew Muller) is currently being prosecuted for the crime. For ease of reference, Plaintiffs
simply reference the “intruder” or “assailant” (singular).

1

VPD proceeded to interrogate Quinn aggressively for 18 straight hours. (Id. ¶ 20.) Det.

2

Mustard and others repeatedly told Quinn they believed he was lying, that they did not want to

3

hear anything else about any claimed intruders, and that they knew that Quinn had really killed

4

Huskins. (Id. ¶ 21.) VPD told Quinn he would be branded a “cold, calculated monster,” asked

5

him whether he had ever seen a body after it had been exposed to the elements, and told him he

6

was going to ruin his family’s name. (Id.)

7

VPD (including but not limited to Det. Mustard) led Quinn to believe that he was not free

8

to leave during the marathon interrogation. (Id. ¶ 22.) For example, a sign on the inside of the

9

door read “[t]his door is to remain closed at all times.” (Id.) During the interrogation, they

10

intentionally confined him in a small space without a clock, positioned themselves between

11

Quinn and the doorway – physically blocking his ability to leave – and screamed at Quinn and

12

invaded his personal space. (Id.) When Quinn had to use the bathroom, officers accompanied

13

him and never left him alone. (Id. ¶ 23.) During the entire eighteen-hour interrogation, Quinn

14

was given only two bottles of water, a travel-size bag of chips, and a slice of cold pizza. (Id.) At

15

breaks, Quinn was left in the room alone, where he curled up in the rolling swivel chairs and

16

cried. (Id.) They also kept Quinn incommunicado from his relatives, despite requests from both

17

Quinn and his relatives that they be allowed to see each other. (Id. ¶ 24.) VPD falsely told

18

Quinn that no one was there for him, in an apparent effort to coerce him to confess to a crime he

19

did not commit. (Id.) Over twelve hours after Quinn’s interrogation began – and approximately

20

24 hours after he had first been drugged and assaulted by the kidnapper – the investigating

21

officers subjected Quinn to a lie detector test. (Id.¶ 26.) Although there was no indication that

22

Quinn lied in response to any question, Quinn was told that he had failed the test, and VPD

23

continued to interrogate him even more aggressively. (Id.) Quinn demanded to speak to an

24

attorney but the police kept him isolated from his attorneys for several more hours. (Id. ¶ 28.)

25

At 6:00 a.m., VPD finally allowed Quinn to speak with his brother. (Id. ¶ 30.) Quinn’s brother

26

recognized Quinn was not free to leave, and assisted Quinn in finding an attorney by 9:00 a.m.

1

Despite the aggressive posturing, VPD did not have any evidence to charge Quinn with

2

any crime, and he was released after his attorney arrived. (Id. ¶ 31.) VPD delayed Quinn’s

3

departure in an attempt to secure more media coverage of Quinn’s release. (Id.) When VPD

4

finally allowed Quinn to leave, they tried to force Quinn – sleep deprived, hungry, and still

5

wearing the jail clothes from VPD – to exit the front of the station where numerous media outlets

6

had congregated at VPD’s instruction. (Id.) Quinn’s attorneys identified what VPD was doing

7

and secured a more discrete release. (Id.)

8

C.

9

When initially taken from Quinn’s house, Huskins was transported several hours away in

HUSKINS IS KIDNAPPED AND RAPED TWICE

10

the trunk of a car by the kidnapper. (Id. ¶ 32.) Huskins was forced into the bedroom of a home

11

and tied to the bed with zip ties and a bike lock. (Id. ¶ 33.) For the next day, Huskins remained

12

a hostage in this small room, and was forced to wear a blindfold made of blacked out swim

13

goggles when her captor entered the room. (Id.) Huskins was drugged repeatedly while held

14

captive, and raped multiple times. (Id. ¶¶ 34-35.) Following the second rape, the kidnapper told

15

Huskins that she would be released. (Id. ¶ 37.) The kidnapper threatened Huskins again, telling

16

her that when she spoke with the police or media she should never speak of the rape or of his

17

supposed military background. (Id.) Huskins was again drugged and blindfolded, as the

18

kidnapper drove for hours. (Id. ¶ 38.)

19

D.

VPD ACCUSES HUSKINS OF FAKING HER OWN KIDNAPPING TO RE-LIVE THE
THRILL OF PRIOR SEXUAL ABUSE

20
21

While held captive, the kidnapper forced Huskins to record a “proof of life” tape, used to

22

prove that she was still alive. (Id. ¶ 39.) That recording was transmitted to the San Francisco

23

Chronicle on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 24, who shared it with VPD. (Id.) Shortly

24

thereafter, VPD had Huskins’s mother and brother verified that her voice was the voice in the

25

recording. (Id.) During that encounter, VPD officers asked Huskins’s mother if Huskins had

26

ever been kidnapped or assaulted before. (Id. ¶ 40.) Huskins’s mother confided that Huskins

27

had been sexually molested when she was a child. (Id.) An officer, believed to be Defendant

28

Mustard, stated that the fact Huskins had previously been sexually abused made sense because,

1

in his experience, women who have already been sexually assaulted often pretend that it is

2

happening again in order to gain attention and re-live the excitement of that experience. (Id.) He

3

explained that this “fact,” along with the evidence that Huskins was still alive, made it likely that

4

Huskins was just making this whole incident up to get attention. (Id.)

E.

HUSKINS IS RELEASED IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, AND VPD ACCUSES HER OF A
CRIME BEFORE TAKING HER STATEMENT

6
7

On March 25, 2015, after being kidnapped, assaulted, and detained for over two days,

8

Huskins was released near her parents’ homes in Huntington Beach. (Id. ¶ 42.) The Huntington

9

Beach Police Department (“HBPD”) observed “darker impression circles” around her eyes,

10

consistent with Huskins’s and Quinn’s statements that they had been forced to wear swim

11

goggles as blindfolds. (Id. ¶ 43.) Huskins also showed HBPD the shoes – which were too large

12

for her feet – and water bottle the kidnapper had given her. (Id.) Huskins spoke with HBPD for

13

nearly one hour about her kidnapping and release. (Id.) Still in shock from the kidnapping and

14

fearful of retribution from a dangerous criminal still on the run, Huskins denied to HBPD that

15

she had twice been sexually assaulted and did not mention that the kidnapper claimed to be ex-

16

military. (Id. ¶ 45.) Huskins’s account regarding the details of the home invasion entirely

17

corroborated Quinn’s. (Id. ¶ 44.)

18

HBPD contacted VPD, and spoke with them for approximately one-half hour. (Id. ¶ 46.)

19

Although VPD had neither seen nor spoken with Huskins, Mustard spoke with HBPD about the

20

case, and ultimately spoke with Huskins’s cousin who was on the scene. (Id. ¶ 50.) VPD’s

21

contact with Huskins – through Det. Mustard’s call with Huskins’s cousin – did not involve VPD

22

asking about Huskins’s condition or follow up on her story to help catch the dangerous predator

23

that had just released her. (Id. ¶ 51.) Instead, Det. Mustard threatened and verbally attacked

24

Huskins. (Id.) Det. Mustard told Huskins’s cousin that VPD was offering a “proffer of

25

agreement” for immunity. (Id.) Det. Mustard stated that Quinn had been at the station

26

cooperating with VPD, and whoever accepted first would get immunity. (Id.) Det. Mustard told

27

Huskins’s cousin that he did not want to hear anything more about the claimed intruders, and

28

“inconveniently” shown up alive, VPD maliciously transitioned to the hoax story to avoid

2

criticism for its initial and utterly false accusations of murder. (Id.)

3

Huskins learned about VPD’s prior assertions that Quinn murdered Huskins and its new

4

assertions that both Huskins and Quinn had faked the entire story. Fearful that VPD would place

5

her back in a confined area and subject her to additional trauma, and that she was unjustly being

6

painted as a suspect in a crime rather than as the victim that she truly was, Huskins took a

7

commercial flight back to the Bay Area. (Id. ¶ 55.) Huskins travelled alone with a borrowed cell

8

phone, cowering wherever she could to avoid the press, police, or kidnapper, each of which she

9

reasonably believed were still after her. (Id.)

F.

11

Even before Huskins’s plane touched down in the Bay Area, VPD began a dramatic

12

public relations assault on her and Quinn. (Id. ¶ 58.) First, VPD issued a press release to the

13

public, stating in part: “Today, there is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger

14

abduction or an abduction at all. Given the facts that have been presented thus far, this event

15

appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.” (Id.)

At a press conference held that same evening at approximately 9:27 p.m., Lt. Park made
the following statements, each of which were false:
o

“We also know that the statement that Mr. Quinn provided was such an
incredible story, we initially had a hard time believing it, and, upon further
investigation, we were not able to substantiate any of the things that he
was saying.”

o

“. . . Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins has plundered valuable resources away
from our community, and has taken the focus away from the true victims of
our community, while instilling fear amongst our community
members. So, if anything, it is Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins that owes this
community an apology.”

o

“If you can imagine devoting all of our resources, 24 hours a day, on what
I will – uh - classify as a wild goose chase – it’s a tremendous loss. It’s
disappointing, it’s disheartening, and the fact that we’ve essentially wasted
all of these resources, for essentially nothing, is upsetting.”

o

Question: “Is there any evidence that makes you know, conclusively, that
this was a fake? I mean, did something come up that made it without
argument that this was all a hoax?”

Lt. Park: “I can tell you that our investigation has concluded that none of

that this was not a random act, and that the members of our community

Each statement was undeniably false and despicable – VPD, a professional law
enforcement organization, formally accused two victims of a horrific home invasion and
kidnapping of falsifying the entire incident. (Id. ¶ 61.) Lt. Park and VPD knew that it is a crime
to provide false statements to the police, and indicated that Huskins and Quinn had committed
that crime. (Id.) Lt. Park’s public statements were delivered with malice and careless disregard
for the truth to cover up VPD’s own incompetence. (Id.) VPD and Lt. Park had no evidence to
support the false and disparaging comments made so publicly during an open investigation. (Id.

Within minutes of VPD’s false statements that Huskins’s kidnapping was a hoax, VPD
had successfully and widely spread its hoax theory, turning a local disappearance into a
worldwide media frenzy proliferating VPD’s public smearing of Huskins and Quinn. (Id. ¶ 64.)
News outlets across the world likened Huskins to the lead character in the film “Gone Girl,” 2
and placed Huskins’s picture next to that of the lead character, including one depicting the
character naked and covered in blood. (Id.) Nancy Grace took to television displaying the
Twitter hashtag “#kidnappinghoax.” (Id.)

VPD CONTINUES TO ATTACK HUSKINS AND QUINN

Shortly after Huskins landed in San Francisco, Huskins’s attorney told VPD that she
would cooperate with its investigation. (Id. ¶ 67.) Huskins’s attorney also told VPD that
Huskins wished to submit to a sexual assault exam as soon as possible. (Id.) VPD demeaned the

exam request and responded that the sexual assault exam could wait. (Id.) A law enforcement

2

official on the case told Huskins’s attorney to watch “Gone Girl” to understand their

investigation. (Id.) VPD both publicly and privately implied that Huskins had lied about being

sexually assaulted, patronizingly and misogynistically implying that she could not have been

raped unless she had grievous physical injuries. (Id.) On information and belief, VPD never

tested Huskins’s SART test. (Id. ¶ 68.)

7

Huskins ultimately spoke with VPD for nearly two full days about her captivity and

8

sexual assaults. (Id. ¶ 69.) Nothing Huskins said provided any additional justification to the

9

public statements Lt. Park made about her on behalf of VPD, yet VPD focused intently on

10

proving up its “Gone Girl” case. (Id.)

In June 2015, Matthew Muller was arrested in connection with a similar invasion and

15

Plaintiffs and directly contradicts VPD’s public statements. On July 20, 2015, the City of

Vallejo admitted privately that “it is clear now that there was a kidnapping on March 23, 2015,

17

that it was not a hoax or orchestrated event and that VPD conclusions were incorrect.” (Id. ¶ 80.)

18

But even then, VPD still maintained that it had done nothing wrong given “the information that

was available at the time.” In the meantime, Huskins and Quinn’s lives and reputations were

completely destroyed.

ANALYSIS

4

A.

5

Plaintiff Quinn has stated a valid cause of action for “stigma plus” defamation because

“STIGMA PLUS” DEFAMATION

6

the harm he alleges is not “purely reputational” under binding Ninth Circuit precedent but

7

instead occurred in conjunction with Plaintiff Quinn’s unlawful arrest and interrogation. “There

8

are two ways to state a cognizable § 1983 claim for defamation-plus: (1) allege that the injury to

9

reputation was inflicted in connection with a federally protected right; or (2) allege that the

10

injury to reputation caused the denial of a federally protected right.” Herb Hallman Chevrolet,

11

Inc. v. Nash-Holmes, 169 F.3d 636, 645 (9th Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original). Thus, where

12

defamatory statements are made in conjunction with an “unconstitutional arrest (in violation of

13

the Fourth Amendment) . . . the necessary plus of the stigma-plus requirement” has been meet.

14

Cooper v. Dupnik, 924 F.2d 1520, 1534 (9th Cir. 1991), aff’d in relevant part en banc, 963 F.2d

15

1220 n.6 (9th Cir. 1992); see also Gobel v. Maricopa Cty., 867 F.2d 1201, 1205 (9th Cir. 1989),

16

abrogated on other grounds by Merritt v. County of Los Angeles, 875 F.2d 765 (9th Cir. 1989)

17

(“Gobel and DeFranco have stated a proper section 1983 claim, however, because they alleged

18

that the false statements were made in connection with their illegal arrest.”).

19

Here, Plaintiff Quinn has alleged that the defamatory statements about him were made in

20

conjunction with his unlawful custodial interrogation and false arrest in violation of his Fourth

21

and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. (Compl. ¶¶ 112-118). And, for purposes of this motion to

22

dismiss, Defendants do not even attempt to contend that Quinn has not stated a valid § 1983

23

cause of action concerning the unlawful nature of the arrest, and indeed have admitted in

24

correspondence to Plaintiffs that such claims were “sufficiently pled.” (Clune Decl. Ex. F.)

25

Thus, Quinn has stated a valid cause of action for “stigma plus” defamation against Defendants. 3

26
27
28

3

Plaintiffs do, however, concede that Huskins’ employment-related injuries are
insufficient to satisfy the “plus” requirement for her alone.

Defendants do not argue that the statements giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims were true or

3

dispute that they acted with malice. Instead, Defendants ask this Court to hold their campaign of

4

malicious disparagement absolutely privileged under California Civil Code section 47(d) or

5

California Government Code section 821.6. Because neither statute applies here, this Court

6

should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs’ defamation claim. Defendants bear

the burden of demonstrating the applicability of these defenses. Milstein v. Cooley, 257 F.3d

Defendants’ Conduct Is Not Privileged Under California Civil Code
Section 47(b)

10
a)
11
12

Defendants’ statements to the press are not statements made in a
judicial proceeding

Defendants argue that their statements to the press are protected as part of a “judicial

13

proceeding” under section 47(b)(2). (Mot. 6.) But a press conference is not a judicial

14

proceeding, and California courts have routinely held that statements made to the general public

15

about judicial proceedings are not protected under section 47(b)(2). “The principal purpose of

16

the litigation privilege ‘is to afford litigants and witnesses the utmost freedom of access to the

17

courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.”’ GetFugu, Inc. v.

18

Patton Boggs LLP, 220 Cal. App. 4th 141, 152 (2013) (citation omitted). The litigation privilege

19

“applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants

20

or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that

21

have some connection or logical relation to the action.” Id. at 152 (quoting Silberg v. Anderson,

22

50 Cal. 3d 205, 212 (1990)).

23

For the privilege to apply, there must be a “functional connection” to the litigation itself.

24

Rothman v. Jackson, 49 Cal. App. 4th 1134, 1141 (1996). Thus, for example, statements made

25

in pleadings, demand letters, and investigatory interviews are protected as logically related to the

26

judicial proceedings. Id. at 1148 (collecting cases). But press conferences explaining one

27

party’s position on potential or actual litigation to the general public are not protected. Id. at

28

1148-49 (involving a press conference in response to potential criminal and civil tort allegations

1

of child abuse); see also Susan A. v. County of Sonoma, 2 Cal. App. 4th 88, 93 (1991) (after a

2

public defender retained a psychologist to interview a criminal defendant, subsequent statements

3

by that psychologist to the press about what she learned in in that interview were not privileged).

4

That is because “republications to nonparticipants in the action are generally not privileged under

5

section [47(b)] . . . .” Silberg, 50 Cal. 3d at 219. Here, Defendants’ statements in the March 25,

6

2015 press conference and in related press releases were not distributed to participants or

7

witnesses in the litigation – they were sent broadly to the national news media at large. (Compl.

8

¶ 89.) As such, they are not protected under section 47(b).

9

Defendants point to authority suggesting that statements made to police are protected by

10

the privilege because they can prompt and facilitate investigations that are prerequisites to

11

criminal prosecution. (Mot. 5-6 (citing Forro Precision, Inc. v. Int’l Bus. Machines Corp., 673

12

F.2d 1045, 1055 (9th Cir. 1982).) But the press release and later statements to the media here

13

clearly did not have the function of investigating Huskins and Quinn, nor were they

14

communications directed at other law enforcement agencies aimed to prompt further

15

investigation of them. Instead, they were wholly extraneous statements made to the public at

16

large, which were separate and apart from the actual investigation. Indeed, the actual substance

17

of the communications indicated that, as far as the police were concerned, there was no

18

kidnapper and thus no need for further investigation of the supposedly invented crime. (See,

19

e.g., Compl. ¶ 89 (“I can tell you that our investigation has concluded that none of the claims has

20

been substantiated. I can go one step further to say this – that this was not a random act, and that

21

the members of our community are safe, and that they have nothing to fear.”).) As such, there is

22

no sense in which these press communications by the police furthered the investigation itself,

23

much less performed a function that was a prerequisite to any criminal prosecution. Thus, they

24

are not protected.

25

Defendants may try and argue that the public had a “substantial interest” in the potential

26

criminal case given the threat to public safety posed by the a kidnapper being on the loose, and

27

therefore may contend that the statements should still be protected by 47(b)(2), pointing to

28

certain case law including within the privilege’s protections certain nonparties with a “substantial
11
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

1

interest” in the proceeding. But, any such construction of the privilege that would extend it to

2

statements made to the general public on issues of “public interest” has been repeatedly rejected

3

by California courts because that “would swallow up the general rule, which [the California

4

Supreme Court ... reaffirmed, that [the litigation privilege] does not privilege ‘republications to

5

nonparticipants in the action . . . ‘” GetFugu, 220 Cal. App. 4th at 153 (citations omitted). Thus,

6

the general public cannot be said to be anything close to a “participant” in the proceedings and

7

Defendants’ statements to the public via the press are not part of a “judicial proceeding” under

8

section 47(b)(2).

9

b)

Defendants’ statements to the press were not made as part of an
“official proceeding”

10
Defendants also argue that anything a police officer does in any way related to an
11
investigation necessarily constitutes an “official proceeding” authorized by law under section
12
47(b)(3), and therefore any communication about the investigation is absolutely privileged by
13
law as long as it happened to be uttered by a police officer. (Mot. 5.) No case law supports
14
Defendants’ sweeping view of this privilege.
15
California courts have relied almost exclusively on the same authority applicable to
16
“judicial proceedings” under section 47(b)(2) (discussed above) in developing the case law
17
applicable to “official proceedings” under section 47(b)(3). In so doing, they have reasoned
18
“[b]y analogy to cases extending the litigation privilege to statements made outside the
19
courtroom.” Hagberg v. California Fed. Bank FSB, 32 Cal. 4th 350, 362 (2004). But nothing
20
suggests that the “official proceeding” privilege should somehow extend beyond what the
21
litigation privilege itself would cover to protect communications whose function is neither to
22
investigate nor to prompt officials to investigate. “[T]he communication must still be ‘in
23
furtherance of the objects’ of the proceeding” – namely the investigation – and “not be
24
extraneous to the [proceeding].” Hawran v. Hixson, 209 Cal. App. 4th 256, 282–83 (2012)
25
(alteration in original) (suggesting but not deciding that a statement made in a press release about
26
an SEC investigation was not protected by the “official proceeding” privilege because it did not
27
further the purposes of the SEC investigation.”) As explained above, Defendants’ statements in
28
12
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

1

press releases and during a press conference on March 25, 2015 in no way performed the

2

function of investigating Huskins and Quinn, nor was their function to prompt any investigation

3

by others. Instead, they were wholly “extraneous” statements made to the public at large,

4

separate and apart from the actual investigation and are thus not protected.

5

None of the cases that Defendants cite in their brief state otherwise. For example, Braun

6

v. Bureau of State Audits concerned statements contained in a final audit report that the state

7

auditor was required by law to create and report to “official administrative agencies.” 67 Cal.

8

App 4th 1382, 1390 (1998). Unsurprisingly, the Court held that statements made in the report

9

itself were entirely privileged. Here, unlike Braun, the statements to the press were in no way

10

made as part of an investigative report; indeed, they served no investigative function whatsoever.

11

Likewise, Imig v. Ferrar merely restates the rule that communications serving to prompt an

12

internal affairs investigation are privileged, 70 Cal. App. 3d 48, 55 (1977), which is not what

13

happened here.

14

Finally, it is important to put Defendants’ sweeping interpretation of the privilege in

15

context to show how out of touch it is with the common law immunities on which the privilege is

16

based. “The privilege recognized in section 47 derives from common law principles establishing

17

a defense to the tort of defamation.” Rusheen v. Cohen, 37 Cal. 4th 1048, 1057 (2006). Under

18

that common law, “while prosecutors, like all attorneys, were entitled to absolute immunity from

19

defamation liability for statements made during the course of judicial proceedings and relevant to

20

them, most statements made out of court received only good-faith immunity” – not absolute

21

immunity irrespective of malice. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 277 (1993) (citations

22

omitted). From this, the Supreme Court has held that the absolute protections of the litigation

23

privilege cannot possibly apply to statements to the press, even if made by prosecutors:

24
25
26
27

Comments to the media have no functional tie to the judicial process just because
they are made by a prosecutor. . . . The conduct of a press conference does not
involve the initiation of a prosecution, the presentation of the state’s case in court,
or actions preparatory for these functions. Statements to the press may be an
integral part of a prosecutor’s job . . . and they may serve a vital public function.
But in these respects a prosecutor is in no different position than other executive
officials who deal with the press, and, as noted above qualified immunity is the
norm for them.

Id. at 277-78 (cross reference omitted); see also Soliz v. Williams, 74 Cal. App. 4th 577, 590-91,

2

595 (1999). So too here, it would be completely inconsistent with the common law

3

underpinnings of section 47(b) to hold that police officers – who are even further removed from

4

courtroom proceedings – are somehow entitled to absolute immunity for anything they say in

5

any way touching on an investigation simply because those statements happened to have been

6

uttered by a police officer. That would immunize knowingly false statements made to satisfy

7

personal vendettas, even if the communication in no way prompts or furthers the investigation

8

and was made simply to gratuitously injure an innocent victim. Such an interpretation cannot be

9

squared with the public balancing of interests the privilege was designed to maintain. See

10

Rothman v. Jackson, 49 Cal. App. 4th 1134, 1147 (1996) (holding that the “balancing of interests

11

. . .disfavors application of the litigation privilege to spiteful and harmful slurs made outside of

12

the precincts which the privilege exists to shelter”).
c)

13

Defendants’ statements outside of the press release are also
unprotected.

14
Defendants do not address Plaintiffs’ allegations, made on information and belief, that
15
Defendants made additional gratuitous and entirely malicious statements about Plaintiffs over
16
and above what they said in the press conference as part of their campaign to destroy Plaintiffs’
17
lives and reputations and cover up their own incompetence. (Compl. ¶¶ 47, 86.) Thus, for
18
example, if Defendants made statements to their friends, relatives, neighbors, or other non19
witnesses repeating the same malicious and untruthful statements they made to an internationally
20
televised audience, such communications can in no way be said to have been made as part of a
21
“judicial proceeding” or other “official proceeding.” As such, there is no conceivable immunity
22

for these additional statements. 4

23
24
25
26
27
28

4

In the alternative, Plaintiffs should be given leave to amend to add in additional facts,
especially in light of their pending request, pursuant to Rule 56(d), to obtain additional evidence
on these issues. (See Wagstaffe Rule 56 Decl., filed concurrently herewith.)

2.

Defendants’ Conduct Is Not Immunized Under California
Government Code Section 821.6

2
3

Under binding Ninth Circuit precedent, California Government Code section 821.6 does

4

not immunize Defendants’ conduct against claims of defamation. Section 821.6 states that “[a]

5

public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or

6

administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously and

7

without probable cause.” Cal. Gov’t Code § 821.6 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit has

8

recently held that this statute applies only to claims for malicious prosecution against public

9

employees, but not other tort claims. Garmon v. Cty. of Los Angeles, No. 12-55109, _ F.3d _,

10

2016 WL 3606745, at *7 (9th Cir. July 5, 2016). In so doing, the Ninth Circuit followed

11

authority directly from the California Supreme Court, “‘confining [section 821.6’s] reach to

12

malicious prosecution actions.’” Id. (quoting Sullivan v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 12 Cal. 3d 710,

13

720 (1974)). As other courts have noted, limiting 821.6 to malicious prosecution claims (and

14

thus not allowing it to immunize any action that happens to be part of a police investigation) is

15

necessary as a matter of public policy. That is because “interpreting Section 821.6 to apply to all

16

tort claims would create ‘a regime of lawless law enforcement in California’ by giving the

17

‘state’s law enforcement authorities a license to kill or to do any other damage that strikes their

18

fancy, even maliciously and without probable cause, as long as they do it in the course of

19

investigating crime.’” Dinius v. Perdock, No. C 10-3498 MEJ, 2012 WL 1925666, at *9 (N.D.

20

Numerous other federal district court decisions had previously reached the same

at *17 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2013); Tucker v. City of Richmond, No. C 12-1829 MEJ, 2012 WL

1

reached a different conclusion, and read section 821.6 much more expansively, the Ninth Circuit

2

expressly rejected these decisions as misguided and inconsistent with California Supreme Court

3

precedent, and the statute’s legislative history. Garmon, 2016 WL 3606745, at *7. Defendants

4

only cite to the same California Court of Appeals cases that the Ninth Circuit rejected. (See Mot.

5

6-7.) This Court is bound to follow the Ninth Circuit on matters of state law, even if it conflicts

6

with lower California courts of appeals. See Brewster v. Cty. of Shasta, 112 F. Supp. 2d 1185,

7

1188 & n.5 (E.D. Cal. 2000), aff’d, 275 F.3d 803 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, Plaintiffs plainly do not

8

bring a claim for malicious prosecution. Instead, Plaintiffs brought state tort claims for

9

defamation. The Ninth Circuit makes clear that section 821.6 does not immunize Defendants’

10
11

conduct in this regard.
C. FALSE ARREST

12

Although Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff Quinn has stated a claim against Det.

13

Mustard and the City for false arrest, they correctly note that Quinn did not plead a false arrest

14

claim against Lt. Park. Plaintiffs admit that they did not intend to plead any false arrest claim

15

solely as to Lt. Park, and that any such claim is not part of this action.

16
17

D. INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
By violating the civil rights of and publicly attacking the recent victims of a horrendous

18

crime to cover up their own failed investigation, Defendants’ conduct is sufficiently extreme and

19

outrageous for Plaintiffs’ claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”) to

20

survive. “Generally, conduct will be found to be actionable where the ‘recitation of the facts to

21

an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead

22

him to exclaim, ‘Outrageous!’” Blanco v. Cty. of Kings, 142 F. Supp. 3d 986, 1002 (E.D. Cal.

23

2015) (quoting Cochran v. Cochran, 65 Cal. App. 4th 488, 494 (1998)). “Because whether a

24

defendant’s conduct was extreme and outrageous is ordinarily a question for the jury, [the court]

25

may grant summary judgment only if no reasonable jury would find [the] conduct to have been

26

so extreme and outrageous as to warrant recovery.” Collier v. Simpson Papaer Co., 133 F.3d

27

926 (9th Cir. 1997).

28

Behavior may be extreme and outrageous if the defendant knows that the plaintiff is

1

vulnerable. McMahon v. Craig, 176 Cal. App. 4th 1502, 1516 (2009). Additionally, behavior

2

may be considered outrageous if the defendant “abuses a relation or position which gives him

3

power to damage the plaintiff’s interests.” Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Prot. Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148,

4

170 n.7 (1987). Because of their position of authority, police officers are often liable for IIED.

5

See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46, cmt. e (1965) (“In particular police officers, school

6

authorities, landlords, and collecting creditors have been held liable for extreme abuse of their

7

position.”); see also Blanco, 142 F. Supp. 3d at 1002 (court found reasonable trier of fact could

8

find extreme and outrageous conduct where plaintiff pled that a police officer “retaliate[d]

9

against her for previously refusing to submit to his earlier interrogation” by continuing an

10

interrogation during a strip search); Newman v. San Joaquin Delta Cmty. Coll. Dist., 814 F.

11

Supp. 2d 967, 979 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (“An unprovoked attack by a police officer could be

12

considered extreme and outrageous conduct.”).

13

Here, Defendants’ unprovoked attacks targeted recent victims of a terrifying crime –

14

assault, abduction, kidnapping, and rape – while asserting an authoritative position over

15

Plaintiffs. Among other allegations in the Complaint, Quinn alleges that he alerted Defendants

16

that he had been attacked, drugged, and that his girlfriend was kidnapped (all true). (Compl. ¶¶

17

17, 12-14.) In response, Defendants denied Quinn his Fourth Amendment rights (a claim not

18

contested by this motion or anywhere at the pleading stage), forced him to continue an 18-hour

19

interrogation while at his most vulnerable, and attempted to humiliate Quinn by forcing him to

20

leave the police station through the front door while still wearing the prison pants (with no

21

underwear), dirty white shirt, and no socks. (Id. ¶¶ 18-20, 31.) Additionally, following the

22

release of Huskins, and before ever speaking with her, Defendants waged a public relations

23

assault against these vulnerable Plaintiffs that they knew would create an international media

24

firestorm. (Id. ¶¶ 58-64.) Defendants publicly accused Plaintiffs of fabricating the entire

25

intrusion and kidnapping (and thereby claimed Plaintiffs had committed a crime), wasting the

26

resources of the citizens of Vallejo, and demanded an apology on behalf of the community. (Id.

27

¶ 60.) Defendants knew that this conduct would destroy Plaintiffs’ reputations and ostracize

28

them from their own community. Further, Defendants’ attack was completely unprovoked,
17
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 11 Filed 08/25/16 Page 24 of 26

1

unsubstantiated by any evidence, and made to cover for their own disastrous investigation and

2

give the public a false sense of security. (Id. ¶¶ 61-62.) Defendants’ national media assault

3

occurred at approximately 9:30 p.m. – less than twelve hours after Huskins was released. (Id. ¶

4

60.) When the attack commenced, Plaintiffs remained traumatized and vulnerable, which

5

Defendants knew or should have known. (Id. ¶¶ 127-136.) Defendants also knew or should

6

have known that their statements, although disseminated indiscriminately, would reach Plaintiffs.

7

(Id.) Thus, a reasonable juror could find this conduct outrageous.

8
9

Defendants’ remaining challenges to the IIED claim likewise lack merit. As explained
above, California Government Code section 821.6 applies only to malicious prosecution claims

10

and thus does not immunize Plaintiff’s IIED claim. Garmon, 2016 WL 3606745, at *7;

11

Williams, 2013 WL 498854, at *17 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2013) (“[S]ection 821.6 does not

12

automatically immunize Defendant’s investigatory conduct against Plaintiff’s IIED claim”).

13

In addition, Defendants allege that they are not liable (under Government Code section

14

845) for damages resulting from “not freeing Huskins from her captor sooner,” such as those

15

Huskins suffered at the hands of the kidnapper. (Mot. at 10.) But, although Defendants may be

16

morally culpable in this regard, Plaintiffs do not seek through this lawsuit damages for such

17

injuries. Defendant City of Vallejo is also vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees.

18

See Cal. Gov’t Code § 815.2. Thus, Plaintiffs have stated a valid IIED claim.

19
20

E. NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
Defendants claim – without any analysis – that Plaintiffs have failed to plead the requisite

21

duty in support of their claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”). But

22

Defendants have numerous independent duties to Plaintiffs, each of which Plaintiffs alleged in

23

their Complaint. For example, it is undisputed that Defendants possessed a legal duty to not

24

unreasonably seize or falsely arrest or imprison Quinn. See U.S. Const. amends. IV & XIV; Cal.

25

Const. art. I, § 13. Likewise, the California Constitution creates a legal duty requiring law

26

enforcement to avoid “intimidation, harassment, and abuse” of victims such as Plaintiffs. Cal.

27

Const. art. I, § 28. Huskins is also owed special protections as a sexual assault victim. See Cal.

28

Penal Code § 680. Additionally, in Catsouras v. Dep’t of California Highway Patrol, 181 Cal.

Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 11 Filed 08/25/16 Page 25 of 26

1

App. 4th 856 (2010), the court held that law enforcement officials “owed a duty of care to

2

plaintiffs not to place decedent’s death images on the Internet for the lurid titillation of persons

3

unrelated to official CHP business.” Id. at 886. Like Catsouras, Plaintiffs here have similarly

4

alleged that Defendants’ public relations campaign was designed to destroy their reputations and

5

hide information regarding Defendants’ abusive and disastrous investigation, and not in

6

furtherance of any official or judicial proceeding. (See discussion supra pp. 10-14; Compl. ¶¶

7

58-64.)

8
9

In additional to specific legal obligations, the California Supreme Court also has
articulated a number of factors for consideration when determining the existence of a duty for

10

negligent infliction of emotional distress, each of which weigh in favor of liability here, and

11

which Defendants fail to address or discuss entirely:

15

The foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that plaintiff
suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct
and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant’s conduct, the
policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and the
consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting
liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the
risk involved.

16

Klein v. Children’s Hosp. Med. Ctr., 46 Cal. App. 4th 889, 896 (1996). Here, with respect to the

17

public relations assault and subsequent treatment of Plaintiffs, it is entirely foreseeable that

18

Defendants’ conduct would cause harm in the form of emotional distress to Plaintiffs.

19

Defendants knew that Plaintiffs reported a horrendous crime and their disparaging and

20

unreasonable statements – both publicly and privately – were likely to destroy Plaintiffs’

21

reputation and ostracize them from their community. Second, Defendants do not doubt, in any

22

way, that Plaintiffs suffered injury, and admitted as much in their private non-apology letter.

23

(Compl. ¶ 80.) Third, Defendants’ conduct was intimately connected to the injury suffered.

24

Overnight, Plaintiffs went from victims of a horrific crime to being portrayed as criminals

25

themselves, and Huskins, specifically, was forever branded the “Real Life Gone Girl.” (Id. ¶

26

64.) Fourth, there is extensive moral blame attached to Defendants’ conduct – Defendants

27

attacked the victims of a crime to hide the deficiencies of their own disastrous investigation and

28

provided the community with a false sense of security. (Id. ¶¶ 58-64.) Fifth, recognizing

Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 11 Filed 08/25/16 Page 26 of 26

1

liability here will prevent future harm. Law enforcement personnel will be deterred from

2

spreading false and malicious lies about victims of crime for self-interested reasons. Sixth, the

3

burden to Defendants here is limited to the facts of this case, and would protect members of the

4

community from similar harm. 6 (Id. ¶¶ 72-76.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged

5

a duty sufficient to support a NIED claim.

6

The remaining arguments against Plaintiffs’ NIED claim are also baseless. This is not a

7

claim for malicious prosecution, so Government Code section 821.6 does not apply. Defendants

8

are mistaken that Plaintiff’s NIED claim seeks damages for Defendants “not freeing Huskins

9

from her captor sooner.” (Mot. at 10.) And Defendant City of Vallejo is vicariously liable for

10

the conduct of its employees. See Cal. Govt. Code § 815.2. Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently

11

stated a claim for NIED against all Defendants.

12

V.

CONCLUSION
For the aforementioned reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny

13
14

Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Should the motion be granted in any part, Plaintiffs request

15

leave to amend.
