IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
BREITLING OIL AND GAS,
CORPORATION, a Texas Corporation,
Plaintiff,
v.

Case No. CIV-13-1310-D

CROWN ENERGY COMPANY, an
Oklahoma Corporation,
Defendant.
DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S PARTIAL
MOTION TO DISMISS DEFENDANTS’ COUNTERCLAIMS
COMES NOW the Defendant, Crown Energy Company, an Oklahoma
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “Crown”), and does hereby respond to the
Plaintiff’s Partial Motion to Dismiss Defendant’s Counterclaims. In support, Defendant
states as follows:
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
1.

Crown and Plaintiff are the parties to multiple independent contractual

relationships regarding discrete oil and gas wells, the rights and obligations of the parties
being embodied in a series of documents (including, but not limited to Participation
Agreements on prospects, operating agreements and COPAS), collectively known as a
Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”). Each discrete well has its own separate JOA.
2.

Plaintiff was one of several working interest owners participating in

development of oil, gas and other mineral interests. Crown was designated the operator

of these wells. The other working interest owners vary from well to well and are not
necessary parties to this action.
3.

There exists between the parties obligations regarding other wells

including, but not limited to the: (1) Magnolia; (2) Bethel Extension; (3) Yardeka;
(4) Warrior Prospect (acreage); (5) West Lucien Prospect (acreage); (6) Tanger 1-14;
(7) Union 1-11; (8) Mathews 1-28; (9) Meek 76-2; (10) the Martin SWD well; and
(11) the Woodring #1 well, including application of production revenues. The obligation
due Crown from Plaintiff on all agreements is only ascertainable by examining the
individual facts and JOA’s applicable to each well.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY
Plaintiff seeks relief from this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) in the
form of dismissal of the Third and Fifth causes of action contained in Crown’s
Counterclaim, or that the Court abstain from hearing said causes of action. In support,
Plaintiff alleges Crown’s counterclaims have been within the jurisdiction of the State
Court in an action commenced on October 23, 2012 and is currently set for trial
March 5-7, 2014 in Garfield County (case number CJ-12-298-03). Plaintiff alleges that
Crown has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and that the issues are
so intertwined and should be dismissed on the doctrine of issue preclusion. Further,
Plaintiff states were this Court to hear evidence on the well known as the Woodring #1
well, which is the subject of the Garfield County case, piecemeal litigation would result.

2

The Garfield County action is limited to a single well controlled by a discrete
JOA. The Plaintiff has elected in this action to seek, in essence, an accounting as to three
other discrete properties; two of which are each controlled by discrete JOA’s and one that
is embodied in a limited liability company.
The Defendant’s Third Counterclaim in this action alleges, and by design was
intended to seek an accounting of the balance of all the wells in which the parties to this
action are involved, which are not included in the Garfield County action or the
Plaintiff’s Petition/Complaint. Those wells are listed above. In other words, it was
designed to state a claim encompassing the parties’ entire relationship. The claims are
broader and encompass properties not included in the Garfield County action or in this
action.
Inclusive of that global accounting must be any lingering issues which will arise or
remain after the Garfield County action is concluded. One of three things will result from
the Garfield County litigation; (1) neither party owes the other party anything,
(2) Breitling owes Crown a deficiency after foreclosure of the lien, or (3) Crown holds
excess funds due to Breitling. Number one is highly unlikely and would mean there is no
impact on this action. Number two would create an adjudicated liability to Crown for
which it could assert a set off against any Breitling claims in this action. Number three
would create a fund from which Crown could collect liabilities owed by Breitling, if any
are due at the conclusion of this action. The three possibilities needed to be preserved as
part of the Counterclaim and therefore were specifically plead in the third cause of action
as “inclusive” claims.
3

There never was any interest on the part of the Defendant to re-litigate the issues
in the Garfield County case. That case has been pending for fourteen and one-half
months. Discovery is complete. Pretrial is scheduled for February 21, 2014. Trial is
scheduled to commence March 5, 2014. To dismiss that case, to be joined in this case
would be a total waste of time and judicial resources. However, the net results of that
case should be part of an omnibus accounting between the two parties which would be
denied if the Third Cause of Action to Crown’s Counterclaim were dismissed at this
preliminary stage of the litigation.
There is no doubt that the issues resolved by the Garfield County case could
constitute issue preclusion in this action. While that is true, that does not mean that the
net results should not be considered by this Court as they might impact the overall rights
and liabilities between the parties. The Garfield County action should be concluded long
before this case is ready for trial, so there should be no delay attributable to this action.
To the extent this Court believes that inclusion of the Garfield County case, to any
extent is currently improperly joined herein, Crown seeks leave of Court to amend its
Third Cause of Action to its Counterclaim, to withdraw any reference to that action on
the Woodring #1 well from this action until the respective liabilities between the parties
arising from that discrete contractual relationship are finally adjudicated. However, the
claim stated encompasses more wells and associated contracts than the Garfield County
action and should not be dismissed, just amended.

4

Plaintiff’s Motion to Partially Dismiss Defendant’s Counterclaim must be
reviewed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), by determining if Crown has failed to state
a claim upon which relief can be granted. Under no set of facts can it be concluded the
allegations of Crown’s Counterclaims fail to state a claim entitling Crown to relief.
Crown specifically alleged in its Third Cause of Action that it is entitled to payment from
Plaintiff on additional wells. Further, Crown’s allegations are clear the Garfield County
case will result in a determination of what amount Plaintiff owes Crown for the
Woodring #1 well. The liability determined in the Garfield County State Court action
will be necessary for this Court in determining ultimate net liability between the parties
as a whole. Such a determination promotes judicial efficiency and provides an accurate
resolution to all claims between the parties. Crown is clear in its request that “to the
extent not addressed in the Garfield County action, Crown should be allowed to foreclose
its lien rights” (Fifth Cause of Action of Crown’s Counterclaim). Accordingly, claims to
which Crown is entitled to relief have been made, and as such should not be dismissed.
Allowing Crown to go forward with all Counterclaims raised does not result in reasserting claims already litigated. Rather, inclusion of Crown’s Counterclaims creates a
method by which final global issue resolution is reached.
