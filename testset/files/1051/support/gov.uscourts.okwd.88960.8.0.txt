IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA
BREITLING OIL AND GAS,
CORPORATION, a Texas Corporation,
Plaintiff,
vs.

Case No. CIV-12-1310-D

CROWN ENERGY COMPANY, an
Oklahoma Corporation,
Defendant.

PLAINTIFF’S PARTIAL MOTION TO DISMISS DEFENDANT’S
COUNTERCLAIMS AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT
COMES NOW Breitling Oil and Gas Corporation, (“Breitling” and/or “Plaintiff”),
and moves this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss two of Defendant’s
five Counterclaims for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted because
such claims are subject to a pending state court action. In support hereof, Breitling
respectfully shows as follows:
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Breitling’s claims against Defendant Crown Energy Company (“Crown” and/or
“Defendant) arise from three Joint Operating Agreements involving the following three
oil and gas wells: (1) Martin well; (2) Wilson well; and (3) Crowder well. Each well at
issue in this lawsuit is subject to its own and separate Joint Operating Agreement.
Crown, however, has a pending lawsuit in state court against Breitling that arises out of a
separate operating agreement involving an oil and gas well identified as Woodring #1

well. Breitling seeks dismissal of Crown’s two counterclaims that involve and relate to
the Woodring #1 well.
STATEMENT OF THE FACTS
1.

On or about October 23, 2012, Crown filed a lawsuit against Breitling

styled Crown Energy Company v. Breitling Oil and Gas Corporation, Case No. 2012298-03, in the District Court of Garfield County, Oklahoma (“State Court” action).
2.

The subject matter of the State Court action involves an oil and gas well

known as Woodring #1 well. In the State Court action, Crown alleges that as a contract
operator, it entered into an operating agreement with Breitling on or about April 20,
2011, to drill and operate oil and gas wells upon the following oil and gas leasehold
estate: Southeast Quarter, Section 13, Township 22 North, Range 6 West in Garfield
County.

The State Court action is pending and is set for a non-jury trial on March 5,

2013.
3.

On or about November 12, 2013, Breitling filed this lawsuit against Crown

in the District Court of Oklahoma County, styled Breitling Oil and Gas Corporation v.
Crown Energy Company, Case No. CJ-2013-6199. (Doc. #1-2).

On or about December

12, 2013, Crown removed this action to the District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma. (Doc. #1).

Simultaneous with that filing, Crown filed its Answer and

Counterclaims. (Doc. #1-5).
4.

Crown has asserted two counterclaims against Breitling that all arise and

relate to the State Court action.

(Doc. #1-5). In particular, Crown’s “Third-Cause of

Action” seeks an offset from the amounts allegedly owed to Crown in the State Court

action. (See p. 14, ¶¶ 4-5, Doc. #1-5).

Crown’s “Fifth Cause of Action” seeks to

foreclose on its liens rights against the funds that are subject to the State Court action.
(See p. 15, Doc. #1-5). Breitling moves to dismiss both of Crown’s Counterclaims, or in
the alternative requests this Court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over Crown’s
two counterclaims that are subject of this Motion.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
In determining the merits of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b)(6), the Court must accept all factual allegations set forth in the plaintiff’s complaint
as true and construe all reasonable inferences in light most favorable to the plaintiff.
Morse v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., 154 F.3d 1124, 1126-27 (10th Cir. 1998). A dismissal
is appropriate, if the Court determines that the plaintiff failed to plead “enough facts to
state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 570 (2007). The actual facts asserted by Defendant as Counterclaimant in its
Third and Fifth Causes of Action fail to establish that Defendant alleged any set of facts,
which would entitle it to any relief.
ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES
PROPOSITION 1: THIS COURT SHOULD DISMISS AND/OR ABSTAIN FROM
HEARING CROWN’S TWO COUNTERCLAIMS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO
THE STATE COURT ACTION
A district court may abstain from exercising its authority when a state forum has
concurrent jurisdiction and when wise judicial administration, giving regard to
conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation, counsels
such abstention. Arkwright-Boston Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. New York, 762 F.2d 205, 210
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
PLAINTIFF’S PARTIAL MOTION TO DISMISS –

(2nd Cir. 1985)(Citing Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 442
U.S. 800, 47 L.Ed. 2d 583, 96 S. Ct, 1236 (1976). The Colorado River Court discussed
four factors that the district court should consider when deciding whether to abstain: (1)
whether either court has assumed jurisdiction over property; (2) inconvenience of the
federal forum; (3) avoidance of piecemeal litigation, and (4) the order in which the courts
obtained jurisdiction.

Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 818. The Supreme Court in Will v.

Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 437 U.S. 655, 667, 57 L. Ed. 2d. 504, 98 S. t. 2552 (1978) added a
fifth factor: whether federal or state law provides the substantive rule to determine the
merits. See also Arkwright-Boston, 762 F.2d at 210.

Whether to abstain is within the

sound discretion of the district court. Id. (Citing Giardina v. Fontana, 733 F.2d 1047,
1053 (2nd Cir. 1984).
Here, two of Crown’s five counterclaims solely involve the Woodring #1 well,
property that the State Court has assumed jurisdiction over. Breitling has not made any
claims in this lawsuit that relate or involve the property associated in the State Court
action. To the extent that the parties are required to re-litigate or conduct additional
discovery concerning Woodring #1 well would not only be inconvenient for all parties
involved, but would also result in piecemeal litigation. Moreover, the State Court action
was filed long before Breitling filed this lawsuit. If this Court refuses to abstain, it will
force Breitling to defend against Crown’s allegations relating to the Woodring #1 well on
two fronts, and would result in piecemeal litigation as well as inconsistent disposition of
the claims. As such, Breitling moves this Court to dismiss Crown’s two counterclaims

that arise and relate to the State Court action, or in the alternative, abstain from exercising
jurisdiction over such claims.
PROPOSITION 2:
CROWN’S COUNTERCLAIMS RELATING TO THE
WOODRING #1 WELL SHOULD BE DISMISSED ON THE GROUNDS OF
ISSUE PRECLUSION
Crown’s two counterclaims that arise and relate to Woodring #1 well should be
dismissed on the grounds that the relief sought by Defendants are so inextricably
intertwined with the pending State Court proceedings that they should be dismissed based
on the doctrine of issue preclusion.

Although the State Court action is pending and

judgment has not yet been entered, a non-jury trial is scheduled for March 5, 2013. As
such, the doctrine of issue preclusion, or otherwise known as collateral estoppel, should
bar Crown from re-asserting its two counterclaims against Breitling in this federal court
action. B. Willis CPA, Inc. v. BNSF Railway, Corp., 531 F.3d 1282 (10th Cir. 2008).
Once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, the
same parties or their privies may not re-litigate that issue in a suit brought up on a
different claim. Id. To invoke issue preclusion, there need not be prior adjudication on
the merits, but only a determination of a material issue common to both cases. Id.
Here, the entire subject matter of the State Court action involves and arises from
the Woodring #1 well, all of which has been litigated since October of 2012. With the
upcoming trial, all issues concerning and relating to the Woodring #1 well will be fully
disposed of. As such, Crown’s third and fifth causes of action set forth in its Answer and
Counterclaim should be dismissed on the grounds of issue preclusion.

RESERVATION OF RIGHTS – TOLLING OF ANSWER DATE
Breitling is of the position that the filing of this partial Motion to Dismiss tolls the
time to answer the entirety of Crown’s Counterclaims. See Gortat v. Capala Bros., Inc.,
257 F.R.D 353, 366 (E.D. N.Y. 2009); Ideal Instruments Inc. v. Rivard Instruments, Inc.,
434 F. Supp. 2d 598, 638-639 (N.D. Iowa 2006), on reconsideration, 434 F. Supp. 2d
640, 65 Fed. R. Serv. 3d 733 (N.D. Iowa 2006); See Gerlach v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co.,
448 F. Supp. 1168, 1174 (E.D. Mich. 1978).

If the Court disagrees, Breitling

respectfully requests that this Court render an order requesting that Breitling file its
Response within a reasonable time.
PRAYER & CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Breitling Oil and gas Corporation, prays the Court
dismiss Defendant’s Third-Cause of Action and its Fifth Cause of Action for the reasons
described herein above; Breitling further prays that this Court enter such orders, granting
Breitling such other relief which the Court deems to be just and equitable.

Respectfully Submitted
