RAMON RODRIGUEZ,
Plaintiff,

Case No.: 5:08-CV-204-OC-10-CRJ

vs.

CITY OF CLERMONT, CITY
OF CLERMONT POLICE DEPT.,
and JEFFREY RADI, in his official
and individual capacity,
Defendants.
________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OPPOSING
DEFENDANT CITY OF CLERMONT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
WITH CORRECTED CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

Plaintiff RAMON RODRIGUEZ, (“RODRIGUEZ”), by and through the
undersigned counsel, files and serves this Memorandum Opposing Defendant CITY OF
CLERMONT’s Motion to Dismiss, and states:
I.

PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT IS NOT A “SHOT GUN” COMPLAINT
Defendant, CITY OF CLERMONT (CITY), correctly notes that Plaintiff

inadvertently numbered the introductory paragraph of each Count in the Complaint by
incorporating by reference each of the preceding paragraphs.

(Plaintiff intended to

incorporate by reference only paragraphs 1-51 in each count). Defendant also correctly
states the law of this Circuit that a party may not incorporate all allegations of each count

in every successive count1.

Magluta v. Samples, 256 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2001).

However, Defendant incorrectly urges this Court to dismiss the Complaint “in its
entirety,” when the cases cited by the Defendant agree that repleader is the appropriate
remedy, not dismissal. Magluta, 256 F.3d at 1284.
Plaintiff’s counsel apologizes to the Court and to the parties for this oversight and
requests this Court to permit Plaintiff to re-plead the offending paragraphs by replacing
the language in paragraphs 65, 102, 107, 124, 130, and 141 with the following language:
“RODRIGUEZ re-alleges every factual allegation as stated in paragraphs 1 - 51 of this
complaint.”
II.
PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS GIVES SUFFICIENT NOTICE
UNDER FED. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) FOR CLERMONT TO RESPOND
Defendant CLERMONT properly states the appropriate STANDARD OF
REVIEW in its Motion to Dismiss, “the Complaint need not give specific facts, but must
‘give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’
Erickson v. Pardus, 127 Fla. 2197, 2200 (2007) (sic)2.”

However, Defendant

CLERMONT misapplies both the standard and the Court’s ruling in Erickson to this case.
In Erickson, the Supreme Court reiterated its long standing position that plaintiffs
are not required to state their claims with specific facts. The Plaintiff in Erickson alleged
that he had suffered harm because he was being denied treatment for hepatitis C, that he
1

Plaintiff did not reallege “every allegation” in each Count; he realleged all “factual allegations,” as they

do apply to each Count.

still needed treatment and that the decision to withhold treatment was endangering his
life. The Defendant moved to dismiss these allegations and the District Court, upon
recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, dismissed the Complaint. The Supreme Court
held it was error to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint, noting that Plaintiff’s allegations of
harm were more than enough to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2). ibid. The Supreme Court stressed
that the allegations, need only “give the defendant fair notice of what the ...claim is and
the grounds upon which it rests.” ibid.
In this case, Defendant CLERMONT claims it cannot comprehend Plaintiff’s
Complaint because:
1.

“The Plaintiff’s Complaint is peppered with the phrases ‘at all times material to
this action’ and ‘during all times relevant and material’.”

Then, Defendant

complains that Plaintiff refers to various dates in his Complaint i.e., date of filing
Notice of EEOC Complaint, date the EEOC issued a Notice of Suit Rights letter,
date discrimination began, etc.
2. “It is unclear from the counts in the Complaint whether the conduct alleged by
Officer Radi is conduct the Plaintiff believes was undertaken in his official or in
his individual capacity.”
We shall examine some of these phrases allegedly “peppered” through out the Complaint
to show the Court that Defendant’s argument is specious. Then we shall discuss the issue
of whether plaintiff properly pleaded Defendant RADI’s status and whether these
allegations give Defendant CLERMONT proper grounds to support a Motion to Dismiss.
3

It is true Plaintiff, in paragraph 14 of the Complaint, alleges, “At all times
material to this action, Defendant CLERMONT operated and exercised control over,
among other things, Defendant CPD in Clermont, Lake County, Florida.” Is Defendant
actually representing to this Court that it is unable to respond to the allegation that “at
some time relevant” to any of the dates mentioned in this Complaint it operated and
exercised control over the CLERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT? Either the allegation
is true or it is not. If Defendant CLERMONT did not operate and exercise control over
the CLERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT for each and every date mentioned in the
Complaint, (including the time the Plaintiff was hired by the Defendant, the time the
Defendant began to discriminate against the Plaintiff, the time Plaintiff filed his EEOC
Complaint, etc.), then Defendant should deny the allegation. Otherwise, it should admit
the allegation. How is Defendant unable to respond to this allegation?
Similarly, Plaintiff, in paragraph 15 of the Complaint alleges, “At all times
material to this action, Defendants, CLERMONT and CPD, were ‘employers’ within the
meaning of Section 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 2000e.” Is Defendant actually telling this
Court that it is unable to respond to this allegation? If at anytime material to this action,
(including the time the Plaintiff was hired by the Defendant, the time the Defendant
began to discriminate against the Plaintiff, the time Plaintiff filed his EEOC Complaint,
etc.) Defendant CLERMONT stopped being an “employer” within the meaning of
Section 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 2000e, then Defendant should deny this allegation.
Otherwise it should admit the allegation. How is this confusing?

Paragraphs 16-20 and 23-25, General Allegations concerning the Parties3, all
contain similar allegations that this Defendant should be able to answer. For instance, in
paragraph 25, “during all times relevant and material,” (including the time the Plaintiff
was hired by the Defendant, the time the Defendant began to discriminate against the
Plaintiff, the time Plaintiff filed his EEOC Complaint, etc.) either Defendant RADI
supervised RODRIGUEZ as part of his employment by the CPD or Defendant RADI did
not supervise RODRIGUEZ. If Defendant RADI supervised RODRIGUEZ for some of
the time, but not for all of the relevant time, what keeps Defendant CLERMONT from
simply denying the allegation?
Defendant can point to no case law requiring such rigid pleading of fact. In fact,
Defendant’s argument flies in the face of relevant case law in this Circuit.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in United States v
Baxter International, Inc., 345 F.3d 866 (11th Cir. 2003) reversed the District Court’s
dismissal of a claim for failure to state a claim, noting that, in applying Fed.R.CivP.
12(b)(6), “a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it
appears beyond a doubt that the [complainant] can prove no set of facts in support of his
claim which would entitle him to relief.” Citations omitted.
The United States in Baxter sought to intervene in a Multi-District Litigation
settlement of a class-action products liability suit against manufacturers of silicone breast

Relevant factual allegations concerning specific timeframes are plead appropriately in paragraphs 29-51

of the Complaint.

implants.

The Defendants moved to dismiss the government’s claims under Rule

12(b)(6), arguing, among other things, that they could not properly respond to the claims
as pled. The District Court dismissed the Complaint on sufficiency grounds and on other
substantive grounds. The Appellate Court for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding
“Because the Federal Rules embody the concept of liberalized ‘notice pleading,’ a
complaint need contain only a statement calculated to ‘give the defendant fair notice of
what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests’.” 345 F.3d 866, 881.
See also: Evans v. McClain of Georgia, Inc. 131 F.3d 957 (11th Cir 1997) and cases cited.
There is no question that the plaintiff in this case has given Defendant
CLERMONT fair notice of his claims and the grounds upon which those claims rest.
Aside from Plaintiff inadvertently numbering the introductory paragraph of each Count,
which Plaintiff concedes was a mistake, each Count states the claim and grounds upon
which that claim rests. As such, this Court should deny Defendants Rule 12(b)(6) Motion
to Dismiss.
Defendant’s argument that “it is unclear from the counts in the Complaint
whether the conduct alleged by Officer Radi is conduct the Plaintiff believes was
undertaken in his official or in his individual capacity,” is likewise unpersuasive. Count I
of the Complaint specifically notes that Defendant RADI was acting in his official and
individual capacity. Thus, Defendant has fair notice of Plaintiff’s claim and the specific
factual allegations detailed in Count I amply state the grounds upon which this claim
rests.

6

Moreover, Defendant CLERMONT’s argument regarding Counts II, Plaintiff’s
§1983 Discriminatory Custom Claim, and III, §1983 Equal Protection Claim, is deficient
because Defendant CLERMONT’s liability is based upon Defendant CLERMONT’s
policy or custom, not upon respondeat superior. Monell v. New York City Department of
Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). Thus, Defendant RADI’s status is irrelevant.
Finally, Defendant CLERMONT’s argument as to Counts IV-VII is moot.
Plaintiff did not plead a Title VII Claim against RADI in his individual capacity and
Plaintiff, in his Memorandum of Law Opposing Defendant RADI’s Motion to Dismiss,
concedes that the Title VII Claims against RADI in his official capacity are superfluous.
Similarly, Plaintiff agrees to dismiss the FRCA Claims against RADI in his individual
capacity and in his official capacity.
As such, Plaintiff respectfully request this Court deny Defendant CLERMONT’s
Motion to Dismiss.
