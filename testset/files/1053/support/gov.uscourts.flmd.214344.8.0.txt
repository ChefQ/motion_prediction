U.S. DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
OCALA DIVISION
RAMON RODRIGUEZ,

CASE NO: 5:08-cv-00204-WTH-GRJ

Plaintiff,
vs.
CITY OF CLERMONT, CITY OF
CLERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT,
and JEFFREY RADI,
Defendants.
/
CITY OF CLERMONT’
S MOTION TO DISMISS
WITH INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and Local Rule 3.01 of the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Defendant CITY OF CLERMONT
(hereinafter the “
City”
), by and through its undersigned counsel, files and serves this Motion to
Dismiss the Plaintiff’
s Complaint with incorporated Memorandum of Law, and states as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, RAMON RODRIGUEZ has filed a seven-count Complaint which consists of
146 numbered paragraphs. Plaintiff has named as Defendants the CITY OF CLERMONT, the
CITY OF CLERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT and JEFFREY RADI, in his official and
individual capacity. The CITY OF CLERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT is not a separate
legal entity from the CITY OF CLERMONT, and all CITY OF CLERMONT police officers are
employees of the CITY OF CLERMONT; therefore, a Motion to Dismiss the CITY OF
CLERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT has been filed separately.

In Counts I, II and III, the Plaintiff is claiming a violation of civil rights under 42 USC
§ 1983. In Counts IV and V, Plaintiff claims a violation of Title VII and in Counts VI and VII,
the Plaintiff claims a violation of Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992. In all but Count I, the
Plaintiff names all three Defendants. In each of the counts, Plaintiff “
realleges every factual
allegation”in the numbered paragraphs above it.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a Complaint should be “
a short and
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” The Complaint need
not give specific facts, but must “
give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the
grounds upon which it rests.” Erickson v. Pardus, 127 Fla. 2197, 2200 (2007). If a Complaint
fails to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and thereby fails to state a claim upon which relief
may be granted, the Complaint is subject to dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). See
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957). As discussed in further detail below, Plaintiff’
s
Complaint does not comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and is therefore subject to dismissal.
DISCUSSION
The Plaintiff’
s Complaint is an impermissible “shotgun” pleading which must be
dismissed.
“
Shotgun Complaints are not sufficient pleadings.” Strategic Income Fund v. Spear,
Leeds and Kellog, 305 S.3rd 1293, 1295 (11th Cir. 2002). A shotgun pleading is one which
“
contains several counts, each one incorporating by reference the allegations of its predecessors,
leading to a situation where most of the counts (i.e. all but the first) contain irrelevant factual
allegations and legal conclusions.”Id. When a defendant is presented with a shotgun pleading,
it is “
virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim
for relief,”and a party faced with such a Complaint is not expected to draft a responsive

pleading. Anderson v. District Board of Trustees of Central Florida Community College, 77
F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir. 1996).
The Plaintiff’
s Complaint is a classic example of a “
shotgun”pleading. Each count
contains a paragraph which attempts to reallege every factual allegation stated in each preceding
paragraph in the Complaint. Further, the Plaintiff has named the CITY OF CLERMONT along
with Officer JEFFREY RADI in his official and individual capacity. It is unclear from the
counts in the Complaint whether the conduct alleged by Officer Radi is conduct the Plaintiff
believes was undertaken in his official or in his individual capacity. Obviously this is significant
for purposes of the Defendant City’
s response, as the Defendant City is Officer Radi’
s employer,
in his official capacity. Thus, this Defendant is faced with the very problem that the prohibition
on shotgun pleadings is intended to prevent: It is virtually impossible to know which allegations
of fact are intended to support which claims for relief. See Anderson, 77 F.3d at 365.
The 11th Circuit has called this type of shotgun pleading a “
cardinal sin.” Weissman v.
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., 500 F.3d 1293, 1311 (11th Cir. 2007). “
Shotgun
pleadings impede the due administration of justice and, in a very real sense, amount to
obstruction of justice.” Strategic Income Fund LLC, 305 F.3d at 1296; citing Byrne v. Nezhat,
261 F.3d 1075, 1128-34 (11th Cir. 2001). Because Defendant City has been presented with a
shotgun pleading, Defendant City has effectively no notice of the actual claims against it. This
violates the notice pleading requirement set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8.
One purpose of the pleading rules set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 is to give the defendant
notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests. Erickson, 127 Fla. at
2200. The Plaintiff’
s Complaint is peppered with the phrases “
at all times material to this
action”and “
during all times relevant and material.” Also throughout the Complaint, the

3

Case 5:08-cv-00204-WTH-TBS Document 8 Filed 08/22/08 Page 4 of 5 PageID 79

Plaintiff identifies several different points in time by specific date, including the date the EEOC
complaint was filed (Complaint, paragraph 2), the date the EEOC issued a Notice of Suit Rights
letter (Complaint, paragraph 4), the date the letter was received (Complaint, paragraph 5) and the
90-day expiration from the date of receipt (Complaint, paragraph 6), the date of Plaintiff’
employment with the City (Complaint, paragraph 29), the date Officer Radi became the
Plaintiff’
s supervisor (Complaint, paragraph 30), the date Plaintiff allegedly complained about
retaliation (Complaint, paragraph 45), and the approximate date that alleged discrimination
“
began”(Complaint, paragraph 60a).
This is not a claim with a specific date of accident; rather it is a claim for an allegedly
ongoing activity, which as stated in the four corners of the Complaint, did not begin when the
Plaintiff began employment with the Defendant City. Because this is an allegedly ongoing
activity, it is not clear what portion of time the Plaintiff thinks is relevant when Plaintiff uses the
phrase “
at all times material to this action”or “
during all times relevant and material.”
Therefore, the Plaintiff has failed to provide the Defendant City with notice of when the
Defendant allegedly committed wrongs (i.e. whether the terms “
relevant”or “
material”refer to
the time before, after, during, or a portion of all of the above). As such, the Plaintiff has violated
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), because Defendant City has not been provided fair notice of the grounds
upon which the Plaintiff’
s alleged claim rests. Erickson, 127 Fla. at 2200.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff has violated the notice pleadings requirement in
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Therefore, the Plaintiff’
s Complaint is subject to dismissal. If this Court
is not inclined to dismiss the Plaintiff’
s Complaint, Defendant City asks, in the alternative, that
Plaintiff be ordered to provide a more definite statement pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).
