KOBAYASHI VENTURES, LLC,

Plaintiff
Vv. : Case No. 1:08-cv-04450-LAP
PAPERTECH INC., :
Defendant.

KOBAYASHI VENTURES' BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO PT PAPERTECH, INC.'S
MOTION TO DISMISS KOBAYASHI VENTURES' FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
AND ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiff, Kobayashi Ventures, LLC ("KV" or "Plaintiff'), by and through its attorneys,
Jeffrey M. Schwaber, Alexia Kent Bourgerie, and Stein, Sperling, Bennett, De Jong, Driscoll &
Greenfeig, P.C., submits this brief in opposition to PT Papertech Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss for
Failure to State a Claim Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or in the Alternative for Summary
Judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 ("Defendant's Motion"), and states as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

The linchpin of Defendant's Motion is a set of material facts alleged by Defendant in
Defendant's Motion---which genuinely are disputed, for which there is no verified support in the
record, and as to which to date there has been no discovery whatsoever.

Specifically, Defendant rests its motion on a purported September 27, 2000 letter (the
"Purported Letter") from its general manager, Kari Hilden, to the then licensor International
Paper Company ("International Paper"), which states in pertinent part, "termination will go into

effect 30 days following your receipt of this Notice." Defendant posits without any support that

the Purported Letter was sent and properly was directed. In fact, International Paper has no
1

 

 
Case 1:08-cv-04450-LAP Document 11 Filed 07/31/2008 Page 8 of 20

record of ever receiving the Purported Letter, by either Champion or International Paper. See
Affidavit of Inger H. Eckert on behalf of International Paper, attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and
adopted herein by reference. Regardless, assuming arguendo that this Purported Letter was sent,
(i) on its face such a letter did not provide a notice in the manner required by the express terms of
the License Agreement; (i1) there is no verification whatsoever of receipt; and (iii) in KV's view,
based on these circumstances any such letter as misdirected and apparently not received did not
operate to terminate the License Agreement and Defendant's obligations thereunder. Applying
the standards applicable to Defendant's Motion and as fully discussed below, KV is entitled to
proceed with its First Amended Complaint against Defendant, and Defendant's Motion in its
entirety necessarily must be denied.
II. PERTINENT FACTS
In Opposition to Motion to Dismiss

1, On or about November 12, 1998, Defendant entered into the License Agreement
acquiring patent rights to what now is known as KV's Patented Technology.'

2. The License Agreement provides for certain royalties to be paid by Defendant.

3. On the topic of the legal matter of a notice of termination, the License Agreement
provides in pertinent part as follows:

21.1 It shall be sufficient giving any notice, report, or other

communication hereunder, if the party giving same shall deposit a copy thereof in

the Post office in a registered or certified envelope, by postage prepaid certified

mail, or delivered by messenger or air courier addressed to the other party at the

address provided hereinbelow or at such other address as may hereafter be
designated in writing.

4, On the topic of notice of termination, the License Agreement states in pertinent
part as follows:

16.3 LICENSEE shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon

thirty (30) days prior written notice to CHAMPION to such effect, in which

event, this Agreement shall terminate on the thirty-first (310x00B0 day after sending

such notice."

5. Defendant acknowledged and made certain royalty payments under the above-
referenced License Agreement, but thereafter stopped making payments, and continues to this
day to make, cause to be made, use, sell, and offer for sale products embodying KV's Patented
Technology, without complying with its contractual obligations.'

6. A number of times, beginning July 16, 2004 and thereafter on or about November

1, 2007, Defendant has been notified in writing of its failure to make contractually-mandated

royalty payments.`

7. In a letter dated June 27, 2008, KV notified Defendant of its default under the
License Agreement and gave to Defendant an opportunity to cure by fulfilling its obligations
under the License Agreement." Defendant has failed to so cure.

8. Since on or about December 10, 2007, KV has been the owner of the Patented
Technology.(R)

In Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment

9, The Declaration of counsel attached to Defendant's Motion is not based on first-
hand knowledge as would be required for consideration in connection with a motion for
summary judgment ("Defective Declaration').

10... The only "fact" alleged in the Defective Declaration of counsel is that the
Purported Letter attached to the Declaration is a true copy of such a letter. That "fact" is
immaterial, and entirely misses the point.

11. There is no verification that the Purported Letter was or was not sent, when and as
addressed, or otherwise.

12. There is no verification as to how the Purported Letter was sent (such as regular
mail, certified mail, registered mail).

13. There is no verification that the Purported Letter was received, as addressed or

otherwise. Upon information and belief, such a letter was not received until 2007.

 

14. The Affidavit of Inger H. Eckert on behalf of International Paper, Exhibit 1
hereto, verifies nonreceipt of the Purported letter stating in pertinent part, "There was no

indication from the File Materials that any such letter or notice dated September 27, 2000 ever

was received by Champion or International Paper.
