Case 1:08-cv-04450-LAP Document10_ Filed 07/14/2008 Page 5 of 24

Defendant PT Papertech, Inc. (erroneously named and sued as "Papertech Inc." and
referred to herein as "Papertech") respectfully submits this memorandum along with the
declaration of Oren J. Warshavsky in support of its Motion to Dismiss the First Amended
Complaint filed by Defendant Kobayashi Ventures, LLC ("Kobayashi'') pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim against Papertech upon which relief can be granted.

I, INTRODUCTION

This action bears all the characteristics of a typical strike suit. Kobayashi originally filed
this action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that
Papertech infringed patents purportedly owned by Kobayashi. In granting Papertech's motion to
transfer venue, Judge Doumar noted that Kobayashi's patent infringement claim lacked merit.
[Order, dated May 7, 2008, at p. 8.] Specifically, Judge Doumar explained that the assignment
on which Kobayashi relies did not support its claim for damages for past infringement. [J/d.]

In an attempt to collect the same damages that were expressly precluded by Judge
Doumar, Kobayashi effectively dismissed its patent infringement claims, filed the First Amended
Complaint and now asserts a single claim for breach of a November 12, 1998 license agreement
(the "License Agreement") between Papertech and non-party Champion International
Corporation ("Champion"). Kobayashi alleges that it has succeeded to Champion's rights under
the License Agreement, and is owed royalties by Papertech. Like the patent infringement claims,
this breach of contract claim is fatally flawed.

This Court should dismiss this lawsuit for two reasons. First, the License Agreement was
properly terminated in October 2000. Kobayashi's initial complaint dealt with these facts in
some detail, and attached Papertech's letter as an exhibit. Second, in the unlikely event that this
Court determines that the License Agreement was not terminated, Kobayashi's First Amended
Complaint is time barred. Specifically, the statute of limitations bars this action because

Kobayashi's claim, if any, accrued more than seven years ago either: (i) on October 28, 2000

8905017.7
Case 1:08-cv-04450-LAP Document10 _ Filed 07/14/2008 Page 6 of 24

when Papertech terminated the License Agreement; or (ii) on March 1, 2001 when Papertech did
not to pay the required royalty payment or provide the associated reporting; which, assuming the
license agreement was still in effect at the time, would constitute a material breach. Either way,
the statue of limitations bars Kobayashi's claim.

Recognizing these fatal flaws, Kobayashi attempts to navigate around them - removing
both its detailed allegations about Papertech's September 27, 2000 letter of termination as well
as the actual letter which was attached as an exhibit to the original complaint - and now urging
that Papertech's termination was insufficient. Kobayashi's attempt to conceal the September 27,
2000 letter of termination is improper. Because the License Agreement was terminated in 2000,
and because the alleged breach occurred in 2001, Kobayashi's First Amended Complaint cannot
stand, and Papertech respectfully requests that the First Amended Complaint be dismissed.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) accepts as true the plaintiffs allegations in the
complaint.! Accordingly, although Papertech disputes many of the allegations in Kobayashi's
First Amended Complaint, as well as its original Complaint in this action, Papertech provides the
following factual statement for purposes of this motion:

A. Papertech and Champion Entered Into a License Agreement

On or about November 12, 1998, Papertech entered into the License Agreement with
Champion. [First Amended Complaint ("FAC"), filed June 27, 2008, 0x00A7 9, Ex. 3.] Under the
License Agreement, Champion granted Papertech the non-exclusive right to make, use, and sell
the patented subject matter of the patents asserted by Kobayashi in its original complaint
("Champion Patents"). [FAC 0x00A7 10, Ex. 3.]

B. The License Agreement Was Allegedly Transferred to Kobayashi

The First Amended Complaint alleges that the following series of transactions assigned to

8905017.7
Case 1:08-cv-04450-LAP Document10 _ Filed 07/14/2008 Page 7 of 24

Kobayashi the Champion Patents and Champion's rights under the License Agreement:

(i) Champion International Corporation became International Paper through a
merger. [FAC at yen 8.];

(ii) On or about October 19, 2007, Jacklin Associates, Inc. ("Jacklin") allegedly
acquired title to the Champion Patents and the License Agreement as a result of a
Patent Purchase Agreement between International Paper and J acklin.? [FAC q 7,
Ex. 2.] International Paper expressly granted Jacklin the right to all causes of
action and enforcement rights related to the patents, including remedies for past
infringement. [FAC 0x00A7 7, Ex. 2 at Ex. D.]; and

(iii) | Then, on or about December 10, 2007, Jacklin purportedly assigned the
Champion Patents and the License Agreement to Kobayashi as a result of a

purported Patent Assignment. [FAC 4 6, Ex. 1.]
C. Papertech Terminated the License Agreement in 2000

The License Agreement gave Papertech, as licensee, the unilateral right to terminate the
agreement: "LICENSEE shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days
prior written notice to CHAMPION to such effect, in which event, this Agreement shall
terminate on the thirty-first (31st) day after sending such notice." [FAC, Ex. 3 (J 16.3).] On or
about September 27, 2000, Papertech, via its General Manager, Kari Hilden, sent a letter to
Champion International Corporation (International Paper Co.), via its Director, Capital Project,
Support and MRO, Richard Piela, providing notice of Papertech's termination of the License

Agreement upon 30 days written notice to Champion International Corporation (the "September

 

2 Inexplicably, the License Agreement, which had been terminated almost seven years
earlier, was included in a schedule of "Assigned Agreements" attached to the Patent Purchase
Agreement. It is also noteworthy that Exhibit 2 of the First Amended Complaint is an unsigned
Patent Purchase Agreement; the only signature is International Paper's signature on Exhibit D to
Exhibit 2, which is entitled Assignment of Patent Rights. [FAC, Ex. 2 (Ex. D).]

27, 2000 letter of termination"). [FAC J 16; Complaint ("Complaint"), filed December 27, 2007,
4 12, Ex. 6; Declaration of Oren Warshavsky, Esq. In Support of PT Papertech, Inc.'s Motion to
Dismiss for F ailure to State a Claim Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5), and In
the Alternative For Summary Judgment Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 ("Warshavsky
Decl."") 93, Ex. A.]

D. Kobayashi Sued Papertech in December 2007

On or about December 27, 2007, Kobayashi commenced this action against Papertech in
the United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia. In its original complaint,
Kobayashi sued Papertech for patent infringement. [Complaint {J 29-34.] In its First Amended
Complaint, filed with this court, Kobayashi dismissed its patent infringement claims and now

only alleges breach of the License Agreement. [FAC ff 19-23.]

lil, KOBAYASHI FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM AGAINST PAPERTECH
A. Papertech Meets the Legal Standard for a 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss

Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a claim may be dismissed
where the plaintiff fails "to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."? The purpose of a
motion under Rule 12(b)(6) is to test the sufficiency of the complaint; that is, to test whether the
complaint alleges all of the facts necessary to state the particular cause of action.* When
considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court "must accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the

plaintiff."> A court, however, is "not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a

 

3 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

5 Id. (citation omitted).

8905017.7
Case 1:08-cv-04450-LAP Document10_ Filed 07/14/2008 Page 9 of 24

factual allegation."(R) "A complaint may not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) unless it appears
beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would

entitle him to relief." '

Accepting its allegations as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to
Kobayashi, does not overcome Kobayashi's failure to state a claim against Papertech because:
(1) Kobayashi cannot provide an existing contract necessary to support a claim for breach of the
License Agreement and (2) even if it could somehow establish an existing License Agreement,
any claim for a breach thereof is barred by the statute of limitations. Kobayashi's claim is

therefore subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).

B. Kobavashi Made The September 27, 2000 Termination Letter Part of The
Record of This Case

Generally, in a motion to dismiss, the court may consider only material found in the
complaint.' For purposes of this rule, `"[t]he complaint is deemed to include any written
instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by
reference." There are exceptions to this rule, at least two of which are applicable to this case,
that allow the court to consider on a motion to dismiss items not attached to the complaint-
specifically the September 27, 2000 letter of termination. [FAC 0x00A7 16, Complaint { 12, Ex. 6;
Warshavsky Decl. 7 3, Ex. A.]

First, the court is permitted to consider, on a motion to dismiss, documents that are not

attached to the complaint, but are referred to, central to, or relied upon in the complaint (that

8 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).

9 Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002)(citation omitted)(on

were in plaintiff's possession or known to plaintiff when it brought suit), and are not disputed.'0x00B0
"Even where a document is not incorporated by reference, the court may nevertheless consider it
where the complaint relies heavily upon its terms and effect, which renders the document
integral to the complaint."'' This exception permits the court to consider Papertech's September

27, 2000 letter of termination.'* This letter is central to and is relied upon in Kobayashi's First

 

10 Chambers, supra, 282 F.3d at 153; Cortec Industries, Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d
42, 44 (2d Cir. 1991); see 2 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE, 0x00A7 12.34[2] (Matthew Bender 3d
ed.)(noting the court is permitted to consider for motion to dismiss "undisputed documents
alleged or referenced in complaint").

11 Chambers, supra, 282 F.3d at 153. See e.g., International Audiotext Network, Inc. v.
American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir. 1995)(on a motion to dismiss
monopoly claims, permitting consideration of agreement between defendant and third party,
though agreement was not incorporated in or attached to complaint, as agreement was integral to
the complaint and complaint relied on agreements' terms and effects); Cortec Industries, supra,
949 F.2d at 44 (2d Cir. 1991)(on motion to dismiss, allowing consideration of documents
transmitted to plaintiffs by defendants and relied upon by plaintiffs in drafting complaint, but not
attached to complaint; "Plaintiffs' failure to include matters of which as pleaders they had notice
and which were integral to their claam-and that they apparently most wanted to avoid-may not
serve as a means of forestalling the district court's decision on the motion.'"'); 60223 Trust v.
Goldman, Sachs & Co,, 540 F. Supp. 2d 449, 451 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)(considering notes and
reports on motion to dismiss "since plaintiffs have mentioned and relied on these notes and
reports in the complaint"). See also Enervations, Inc. v. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Co., 380 F.3d 1066, 1067-69 (8th Cir. 2004)(allowing consideration of contract termination letter
on a motion to dismiss as it was "`embraced by the pleadings'"; complaint alleged defendant
improperly terminated contract, but letter was not attached to complaint).

12 It should be noted that even when a document is not directly referenced in the complaint,
the court may consider it on a motion to dismiss. For example, in Levy v. Verizon Information
Services, Inc., 498 F. Supp. 2d 586, 594 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), where plaintiffs carefully avoided
mentioning certain documents in their complaint, the court considered those documents on a
motion to dismiss as the documents were referenced "indirectly." Likewise, in Connecticut
Indemnity Co. v. 21st Century Transport Co., Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10795, *9-10
(E.D.N.Y. 2001); 2001 WL 868340 *3-4 (E.D.N.Y. 2001), the court held that it was appropriate
to consider on a motion to dismiss a purchase agreement that was not incorporated or even
referred to in a complaint. The court stated the agreement "clearly is integral to the Amended
Complaint since liability under plaintiffs theory would be available only if the purchase of
assets did not insulate [defendant] Allied from [defendant] Rutigliano's liabilities." This is
identical to the present case as Kobayashi's breach of contract theory would only be available if
the alleged "purported" termination was not effective to terminate the License Agreement.
