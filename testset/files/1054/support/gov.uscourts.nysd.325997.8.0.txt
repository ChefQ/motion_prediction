PT PAPERTECH, INC.'S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO DISMISS FOR
FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE 12(B)(6), AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT UNDER FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 56

 

Defendant PT Papertech, Inc. (erroneously named and sued as "Papertech Inc." and
referred to herein as "Papertech") moves this Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(b)(6), for an order dismissing the plaintiff Kobayashi Ventures, LLC's ("Kobayashi") First
Amended Complaint against Papertech.

This Motion to Dismiss is made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on
the ground that Kobayashi's First Amended Complaint fails to state a claim against Papertech
upon which relief can be granted because (1) no contract between Kobayashi and Papertech
exists and (2) the statute of limitation for breach of contract prevents Kobayashi's First Amended
Complaint against Papertech.

Alternatively, if the court does not find that this matter can be resolved as a motion to

dismiss, Papertech requests that the court convert the motion into one for summary judgment

concurrently-filed Brief in Support of PT Papertech, Inc.'s Motion To Dismiss For Failure to
State a Claim Pursuant To Federal Rule Of Civil Procedure 12(B)(6), and in the Alternative for
