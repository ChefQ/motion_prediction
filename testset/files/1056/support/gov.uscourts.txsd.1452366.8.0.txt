INTRODUCTION
This is a contract dispute between a health insurance company and a hospital regarding
the amount of payment due the hospital with respect to certain claims for reimbursement for
post-emergency care services.

Plaintiff Memorial Hermann Health System’s (“Memorial

Hermann”) suit is premised on the allegation that Defendant Health Care Service Corporation, a
Mutual Legal Reserve Company that operates in Texas as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas
(“BCBSTX”) 1, failed to pay hundreds of claims pursuant to the alleged contractual terms. But
the contract underlying Memorial Hermann’s complaint contains a mandatory arbitration
agreement requiring that “any Contract interpretation or claim issue” be resolved “by arbitration
under the commercial rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association.” BCBSTX
moves to enforce that agreement to arbitrate and respectfully submits this memorandum of law in
support of its motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) for
improper venue.
NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Memorial Hermann sued BCBSTX on August 1, 2017 in the District Court of Harris
County, Texas, alleging that BCBSTX breached its contract with Memorial Hermann by failing
to pay hundreds of claims submitted by Memorial Hermann for post-emergency care services.
On September 3, 2017, BCBSTX removed the case to this Court based on diversity jurisdiction.
(See Dkt. No. 3.)

1

Memorial Hermann named Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas as the defendant in the State Court Action. But
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas is not a corporate entity; it is an unincorporated division of Health Care
Service Corporation. (See Dkt. No. 3 Notice of Removal.)

STATEMENT OF ISSUES
Issue: Should the Court compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act
(“FAA”) and Texas General Arbitration Act (“TGAA”), and dismiss this action pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) based on improper venue because the express terms of
the underlying contract require any contract interpretation or claim issue to be resolved through
arbitration?
Standard of Review: Under the FAA, when a party fails, neglects, or refuses to arbitrate
under a written agreement for arbitration, the aggrieved counter-party may move the court for an
order directing that an arbitration proceed pursuant to the relevant agreement. 9 U.S.C. § 4.
Similarly, under the TGAA, 2 a court must order the parties to arbitrate upon a showing that there

2

In the alternative, BCBSTX brings its motion pursuant to the TGAA. The FAA applies to contracts involving
commerce “absent clear and unambiguous contractual language to the contrary.” Action Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Fid.
& Guar. Co., 358 F.3d 337, 340–43 (5th Cir. 2004). The arbitration provision at issue here expressly invokes
the TGAA and a separate provision of the contract provides that the contract will be governed by the laws of the
state of Texas. Given the language of the arbitration provision, there is conflicting case law regarding whether
the FAA, the TGAA, or both governs in this case. Compare Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans of Gulf Coast, Inc.,
141 F.3d 243, 249–50 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding that the parties intended Texas law and the TGAA to govern the
scope of the arbitration clause, to the exclusion of the FAA, where the arbitration clause (1) invoked the TGAA,
(2) provided that the arbitration would be conducted in Harris County, Texas, (3) provided that disagreements
over arbitrators were to be resolved by “any judge of any Court of the State of Texas, having jurisdiction and
located in Harris County,” and (4) announced in bold, capital type on the first page of the contract: “This
agreement is subject to arbitration under the Texas General Arbitration Act”) with Pedcor Mgmt. Co. Welfare
Benefit Plan v. Nations Pers. of Texas, Inc., 343 F.3d 355, 360–62 (5th Cir. 2003) (parties “must expressly
exclude the applicability of the FAA if they want only state law to apply”); see also Freudensprung v. Offshore
Tech. Servs., Inc., 379 F.3d 327, 338 n.7 (5th Cir. 2004) (“Where, as here, an agreement contains a clause
designating Texas law but does not exclude the FAA, the FAA and Texas law, including that state’s arbitration
law, apply concurrently because Texas law incorporates the FAA as part of the substantive law of that state.”);
Baylor Health Care Sys. v. Equitable Plan Servs., Inc., 955 F. Supp. 2d 678, 692–93 (N.D. Tex. 2013) (“When
an agreement contains a clause that designates Texas law but does not exclude the FAA, the FAA and Texas
law, including the TAA, apply concurrently.”) (citing Freudensprung, 379 F.3d at 338 n.7). The Texas
Supreme Court in 2010 held that a clause requiring that disputes arising out of the contract “be resolved by
mandatory and binding arbitration ... pursuant to the Texas General Arbitration Act....” was sufficient to
indicate the parties’ intent to choose “a state’s substantive law, specifically the TAA, to govern disputes under
the agreement,” to the exclusion of the FAA. In re Olshan Found. Repair Co., LLC, 328 S.W.3d 883, 890 (Tex.
2010). But in Vujasinovic & Beckcom, PLLC v. Cubillos, No. CV H-15-2546, 2016 WL 5573712 (S.D. Tex.
Sept. 29, 2016), where the contract contained a Texas choice of law provision and an arbitration clause
requiring disputes to be resolved “pursuant to the Texas General Arbitration Statute,” id. *2, the court held that
the contract did not “exclude the applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act,” and that “the Federal Arbitration
Act and the Texas Arbitration Act both apply.” Id. at *4. Regardless, as discussed throughout this
memorandum, the analysis under the FAA and TGAA is substantially the same, and the result in this case is
exactly the same. See e.g., Dustrol, Inc. v. Champagne-Webber, Inc., No. CIV.A.3:01-CV-0650-G, 2001 WL

2

is an agreement to arbitrate and the opposing party has refused to do so. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code § 171.021(a).
A court engages in a two-step analysis in determining whether to compel arbitration
under the FAA: (1) whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in question; and (2)
whether “legal constraints would foreclose the arbitration of those claims.” Webb v. Investacorp
Inc., 89 F.3d 252, 258 (5th Cir. 1996). Whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute
involves two separate determinations:

“(1) whether there is a valid agreement

to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) whether the dispute in question falls within the scope of
that arbitration agreement.” Id.; see also ASW Allstate Painting & Const. Co., Inc. v. Lexington
Ins. Co., 188 F.3d 307, 311 (5th Cir. 1999) (applying the TGAA and Texas law) (citing Certain
Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London v. Celebrity, Inc., 950 S.W.2d 375, 377 (Tex. App.—Tyler
1996), writ dismissed w.o.j., 988 S.W.2d 731 (Tex. 1998)).
However, an arbitration agreement may delegate determination of the scope of
arbitrability to the arbitrator, including by incorporating the American Arbitration Association
(the “AAA”) commercial arbitration rules into the arbitration agreement.

See, e.g.,

Schlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Baker Hughes Inc., 355 S.W.3d 791, 802 (Tex. App.—Houston
[1st] 2011, no pet.); Petrofac, Inc. v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., 687 F.3d 671,
675 (5th Cir. 2012). In such cases, the court’s analysis is limited.
It performs the first step—an analysis of contract formation—as it always does.
But the only question, after finding that there is in fact a valid agreement, is
whether the purported delegation clause is in fact a delegation clause—that is, if it
1326477, at *3–*4 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 16, 2001) (noting that the party opposing arbitration conceded “that the
choice-of-law issue is of no consequence because both the [FAA] and the TGAA require that there be an
agreement to arbitrate, and that the dispute be within the scope of that agreement, before arbitration will be
compelled” (internal quotation marks omitted); also noting, after choosing to apply the TGAA, that “the
analysis would be substantially similar were the FAA to be applied”). Under Texas law, Memorial Hermann
bears the burden of defeating the arbitration agreement. Cantella & Co. Inc. v. Goodwin, 924 S.W.2d 943, 944
(Tex. 1996) (“A party opposing an arbitration agreement bears the burden of defeating it.”).

3

evinces an intent to have the arbitrator decide whether a given claim must be
arbitrated. If there is a delegation clause, the motion to compel arbitration should
be granted in almost all cases.
Kubala v. Supreme Prod. Servs., Inc., 830 F.3d 199, 202 (5th Cir. 2016) (internal citations
omitted).
The Fifth Circuit has recognized that when the claims alleged in a complaint are subject
to arbitration, dismissal of the civil litigation under Rule 12(b)(3) is the proper remedy. See, e.g.,
Lim v. Offshore Specialty Fabricators, Inc., 404 F.3d 898, 902 (5th Cir. 2005); see also Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(3).
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Memorial Hermann is a large, sophisticated healthcare system in Texas that provides a
variety of health care services, including emergency services. (Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶¶
6, 16.) BCBSTX offers insurance and administers health benefit plans that enable its members
to receive access to health care services. (Id. ¶ 6.) In connection with those efforts to provide
access, BCBSTX contracts with healthcare providers, including hospitals and healthcare systems
like Memorial Hermann.
Memorial Hermann alleges that the parties entered into various contracts to govern their
relationship, including how BCBSTX would reimburse Memorial Hermann for services provided
to members of various BCBSTX health benefit plans. (Id. ¶¶ 8-11.) Through these contracts,
Memorial Hermann became an “in-network” provider for certain BCBSTX plans, including
certain Health Maintenance Organization (“HMO”) and Preferred Provider Organization
(“PPO”) plans. (See id. ¶¶ 8-9.)
Memorial Hermann and BCBSTX also entered into a broad-ranging Hospital Contract for
Traditional Indemnity Business (the “Traditional Contract”). (Ex. 1 Traditional Contract; see

4

also Dkt. No 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶ 11-12.) 3 The Traditional Contract provides the
“reimbursement mechanism which will be used as the basis for payment of Covered Services by
BCBSTX to [Memorial Hermann].” (Ex. 1 Traditional Contract Art. 2.A.) The reimbursement
rate under the Traditional Contract is known as the PAR rate. (See Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet.
¶ 11). The Traditional Contract defines “Covered Services” as “those acute care inpatient and
outpatient hospital services for which benefits are available under a Subscriber’s health care
benefit plan.” (Id. Art. 1.A.) “Subscriber,” in turn, “means any person entitled to receive
Covered Services under a health care benefit plan provided or administered by [BCBSTX].” (Id.
Art. 1.B.)
In 2013, BCBSTX introduced the Blue Advantage HMO plan (the “BAV Plan”). (Dkt.
No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶ 14.) Memorial Hermann was “out-of-network” for the BAV Plan. (Id.
¶ 15.) Because Memorial Herman was not an “in-network” provider for the BAV Plan (id. ¶ 15),
BCBSTX took the position that the Traditional Contract applied for reimbursement of services
provided by Memorial Hermann to BAV Plan members. (See id. ¶ 20.) Memorial Hermann
eventually agreed. (Id.)
Now, Memorial Hermann alleges that BCBSTX breached its contractual obligations with
regard to payment of claims submitted for post-emergency care services to BAV Plan members
and, as a result, owes the PAR reimbursement rate for hundreds of BAV Plan claims. (Id. ¶¶ 24,
30.)

3

References to Ex. 1 are to Exhibit 1 of the Declaration of Brian P. Kavanaugh. Ex. 1 contains relevant excerpts
of the Traditional Contract. While Memorial Hermann did not attach the Traditional Contract, or any other
contract, to its petition, the Traditional Contract is expressly referenced in the petition (e.g. Dkt. No. 3-1 State
Court Pet. ¶ 11) and is properly considered by the Court. Regardless, under Rule 12(b)(3), this Court is
“permitted to look at evidence in the record beyond simply those facts alleged in the complaint and its proper
attachments.” Ambraco, Inc. v. Bossclip B.V., 570 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir. 2009).

5

The operative Traditional Contract contains a forum selection provision requiring that
any contract interpretation or claim issue shall be resolved by arbitration. The full text of the
provision states:
After exhausting the remedies contained in this Article 11, any Contract
interpretation or claim issue which [Memorial Hermann] or BCBSTX determines
has not been satisfactorily resolved shall be resolved by arbitration under the
commercial rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association, and in
accordance with the Texas General Arbitration Act (Chapter 171 Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Codes). (Ex. 1 Traditional Contract Art. 11.C.)
Despite this, Memorial Hermann has made its intention clear that it does not seek to
arbitrate, as evidenced by filing this lawsuit in state court.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Federal and Texas policy strongly favor arbitration. Garrett v. Circuit City Stores, Inc.,
449 F.3d 672, 674 (5th Cir. 2006) (“[O]nce a party makes an agreement to arbitrate, that party is
held to arbitration unless Congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial
remedies for the statutory rights at issue.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Ford, 141
F.3d at 250 (“Texas courts favor arbitration.”) (citing Monday v. Cox, 881 S.W.2d 381, 384
(Tex. App.—San Antonio 1994, writ denied)); Cantella, 924 S.W.2d at 944 (noting Federal and
Texas law strongly favor arbitration).
Because the parties agreed to arbitrate all contract interpretation and claim issues, as set
forth in Article 11 of the Traditional Contract, and because no legal constraints impact the
arbitrability of those claims, this Court must compel arbitration. Webb, 89 F.3d at 258; see also
Woodmen of World Life Ins. Soc’y/Omaha Woodmen Life Ins. Soc’y v. JRY, 320 F. App’x 216,
221 (5th Cir. 2009).

Specifically, it cannot be disputed that the parties entered into the

arbitration agreement contained in the Traditional Contract.

6

And, under that arbitration

agreement, any dispute regarding the scope of the arbitration agreement must be submitted to the
arbitrator.
When all of the claims alleged in a complaint are subject to arbitration, dismissal of the
litigation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), as opposed to a stay of litigation, is the
proper remedy. See Alford v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 975 F.2d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir. 1992);
Lim, 404 F.3d at 902 (analyzing Fifth Circuit law, as well as other circuits, to find that it is
proper to grant a Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss in the event of a valid forum selection clause).
Because Memorial Hermann’s dispute with BCBSTX is subject to a valid arbitration agreement,
the Court should dismiss this action.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE PARTIES AGREED TO ARBITRATE THIS DISPUTE
Whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a dispute involves two determinations: “(1)

whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) whether the dispute in
question falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement.” Webb, 89 F.3d at 258; see also
Kubala, 830 F.3d at 202 (“Enforcement of an arbitration agreement involves two analytical
steps.

The first is contract formation—whether the parties entered into any arbitration

agreement at all. The second involves contract interpretation to determine whether this claim is
covered by the arbitration agreement.” (internal citations omitted; emphasis added)); ASW
Allstate Painting & Const. Co., 188 F.3d at 311 (applying TGAA and Texas law) (citing
Celebrity, 950 S.W.2d at 377).
In this case, the Traditional Contract contains a valid agreement to arbitrate. (Ex. 1
Traditional Contract Art. 11.C.) And under the terms of that same agreement, the second
threshold issue – the scope of the arbitration agreement – must be determined by the arbitrator,
not the Court.
7

A. There is a Valid Arbitration Agreement in Place
The satisfaction of this first threshold issue – contract formation – cannot be questioned
because it is undisputed that “the parties entered into any arbitration agreement at all.” Kubala,
830 F.3d at 202 (emphasis added).

Because Memorial Hermann executed the Traditional

Contract (Ex. 1 Traditional Contract Art. 23) and has been operating under it since 2005 (id.;
Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶¶ 11-12), whether there is any valid arbitration agreement must be
answered affirmatively. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. v. Gaskamp, 280 F.3d 1069, 1073 (5th Cir.
2002), opinion supplemented on denial of reh’g, 303 F.3d 570 (5th Cir. 2002) (The
determination of whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate “is generally made on the basis
of ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.” (internal citation and
quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, Memorial Hermann concedes in the State Court Petition that
the Traditional Contract is valid and enforceable, and seeks to be paid the rates set forth in this
contract. (Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶¶ 11-12, 20-21, 35.)
B. The Arbitration Agreement Delegates the Scope of Arbitrability to the Arbitrator
Ordinarily, both contract formation and contract interpretation are threshold issues for the
court to decide. See e.g., Kubala, 830 F.3d at 201–02; Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 355 S.W.3d at
802 (citing First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 1923
(1995)). But the parties’ contract may bypass the court’s involvement in this second threshold
issue by delegating interpretation of the scope of arbitrability to the arbitrator. Petrofac, Inc.,
687 F.3d at 675 (“Just as the arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the
parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute, so the question ‘who has the primary power to decide
arbitrability’ turns upon what the parties agreed about that matter.” (quoting Kaplan, 514 U.S. at
943)).

8

“Delegation clauses are enforceable and transfer the court’s power to decide arbitrability
questions to the arbitrator. Thus, a valid delegation clause requires the court to refer a claim to
arbitration to allow the arbitrator to decide gateway arbitrability issues.” Kubala, 830 F.3d at
202 (citing Rent–A–Ctr., W., Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 68–69, 130 S. Ct. 2772, 2776 (2010)).
Where the arbitration agreement expresses an intent to have questions of arbitrability determined
by the arbitrator, “the court’s analysis is limited. It performs the first step—an analysis of
contract formation—as it always does. But the only question, after finding that there is in fact a
valid agreement, is whether the purported delegation clause is in fact a delegation clause—that
is, if it evinces an intent to have the arbitrator decide whether a given claim must be
arbitrated. If there is a delegation clause, the motion to compel arbitration should be granted in
almost all cases.” Id. (citations omitted).
Further, under Texas and Fifth Circuit law, “the express incorporation of rules that
empower the arbitrator to determine arbitrability—such as the AAA Commercial Arbitration
Rules—has been held to be clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties’ intent to allow the
arbitrator to decide such issues.” Schlumberger Tech. Corp., 355 S.W.3d at 802; Petrofac, Inc.,
687 F.3d at 675 (holding that incorporating AAA rules into an arbitration agreement “presents
clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability”). This is
because the “AAA Rules for commercial arbitration include Rule 7, which provides that ‘[t]he
arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections
with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability
of any claim or counterclaim.’” Crawford Prof’l Drugs, Inc. v. CVS Caremark Corp., 748 F.3d
249, 262 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting AAA rules for commercial arbitration). The Fifth Circuit in
Crawford, relying on Petrofac, affirmed the district court’s order compelling arbitration, holding

9

that “whether the Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to arbitration must be decided in the first instance
by the arbitrator, not a court.” Id. at 263.
As in Schlumberger, Petrofac, and Crawford, the arbitration agreement in this case
expressly incorporates and requires application of the “commercial rules and regulations of the
American Arbitration Association.” (Ex. 1 Traditional Contract Article 11.C.) Accordingly,
questions regarding the scope of the arbitration agreement must be determined by the arbitrator.
This is the required result under both the FAA and the TGAA.

In Vujasinovic &

Beckcom, 2016 WL 5573712, the relevant contract, like the Traditional Contract here, contained
a Texas choice of law provision and an arbitration clause requiring disputes to be resolved
“pursuant to the Texas General Arbitration Statute in accordance with the commercial arbitration
rules then in effect with the American Arbitration Association.” Id. at *2. The court first held
that “[w]hen a contract contains a clause specifying Texas law (as here), but does not exclude the
applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act, the Federal Arbitration Act and the Texas
Arbitration Act both apply.” Id. at *4 (citing Freudensprung, 379 F.3d at 338 n.7). Applying
both statutes, the court found, based on Petrofac and Schlumberger, that both “Fifth Circuit and
Texas cases unambiguously hold that incorporating AAA rules into an arbitration agreement
makes threshold questions of arbitrability questions for the arbitrator to decide, rather than the
court.” Id. at *5. Layering in the Fifth Circuit’s instruction in Kubala, the court concluded:
The combination of Petrofac and Kubala makes this case simple.
This court has already ruled that there is a valid and enforceable
arbitration clause, and the parties do not meaningfully challenge
that ruling. The arbitration clause incorporates the AAA rules by
reference, which, under Petrofac, is the functional equivalent of a
delegation clause. Under Kubala, once the court determines that
there is a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement that contains
a delegation clause, the court must grant the motion to compel
arbitration. The arbitrator will hear and rule on the defendants’

10

various arguments as to what claims can properly be heard in
arbitration and what claims must be left for the court to decide.
Id. at *6.
Fifth Circuit and Texas precedent under the FAA and TGAA require that any dispute
about the scope of the Traditional Contract’s arbitration clause be decided by the arbitrator. This
Court, need not, and may not, wade into the scope of arbitrability. Instead, the dispute must be
sent to arbitration and the litigation dismissed.
C. Regardless, the Dispute Falls Within the Scope of the Arbitration Agreement
Even if the Court were to find that the Traditional Contract’s express incorporation of the
AAA rules does not prevent it from independently considering the scope of the arbitration
agreement, Memorial Hermann’s claims are well within the scope of the arbitration agreement
facially and under the broad interpretation given to arbitration agreements under Texas and Fifth
Circuit law. If a valid arbitration agreement exists, both Texas and federal law require courts to
apply a “strong presumption favoring arbitration.” Vujasinovic & Beckcom, 2016 WL 5573712,
at *4 (citing J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 227 (Tex. 2003)).
Memorial Hermann’s allegations center on the interpretation of the Traditional Contract
and its application to claims for reimbursement submitted by Memorial Hermann to BCBSTX
for post-emergency services provided to BAV Plan members. (Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet.
¶¶ 20, 35.) In other words, this is a contract interpretation dispute about claim issues. And the
Traditional Contract’s arbitration provision explicitly requires that “any Contract interpretation
or claim issue” must be resolved by arbitration. (See Ex. 1 Traditional Contract Art. 11.C.) As
such, the entire dispute falls within the arbitration provision and dismissal is proper. See Moses
H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24–25, 103 S. Ct. 927, 941 (1983)
(Courts must resolve “any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues . . . in favor of

11

arbitration.”); see also AT & T Techs., Inc. v. Commc’ns Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643, 650, 106
S. Ct. 1415, 1419 (1986) (“[A]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied
unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an
interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Pennzoil
Expl. & Prod. Co. v. Ramco Energy Ltd., 139 F.3d 1061, 1067 (5th Cir. 1998) (same); Rouf v.
Cricket Commc’ns, Inc., No. CIV.A. H-13-2778, 2013 WL 6079255, at *6 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 19,
2013) (holding that the plaintiffs’ claims for anticipatory breach of contract fell strictly within
the purview of the arbitration clause, which stated that “all disputes” arising out of the contract
shall be decided by arbitration).
Moreover, all Counts of the petition require interpretation and application of the
Traditional Contract, and thus dismissal is warranted. Alford, 975 at 1164. Count One (breach
of contract) directly relates to “claim issues” and the proper “Contract interpretation” of the
Traditional Contract and its PAR Rate. Count Two (quantum meruit/unjust enrichment) is also a
“claim issue” dispute regarding reimbursement for claims submitted by Memorial Hermann.
(See, e.g., Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶ 45.) Further, Count Two is only plead in the
alternative and expressly incorporates and relies on all of the factual allegations of the petition,
including the Traditional Contract and PAR Rate. (Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶ 38); see
Reliable Energy Sols. v. Amalfi Apartment Corp., No. 4:16-CV-03346, 2017 WL 3412198, at *3
(S.D. Tex. June 30, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, No. CV H-16-3346, 2017 WL
3394613 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 7, 2017) (holding that breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust
enrichment claims were all within the scope of the arbitration agreement because all three claims
“relate to the nature and quality of the goods and services that formed the basis for the

12

Agreement, and any representations made in connection therewith”). 4 Count Three, which seeks
declaratory relief, likewise relies on all of the factual allegations of the petition regarding the
Traditional Contract (Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶ 46), and turns on the allegation that
BCBSTX’s claim denials “violate[] the parties’ agreement.” (Id. ¶ 48.); see also Reliable Energy
Sols., 2017 WL 3394613, at *3 (“But, where there are any doubts or ambiguities as to scope of
the arbitration provision, they are ordinarily resolved in favor of arbitration.”).
Under Texas law and the TGAA, the result is the same. 5

First, under Texas law,

Memorial Hermann bears the burden of showing that the claims asserted are not within the scope
of the arbitration agreement. Prudential Sec. Inc. v. Marshall, 909 S.W.2d 896, 900 (Tex. 1995)
(placing the burden of showing the claims fell outside the scope of the arbitration agreement on
the party opposing arbitration).

Second, a court focuses on the factual allegations of the

complaint, rather than the legal causes of action asserted. Id. The test is whether the claim is “so
interwoven with the underlying contract that it could not stand alone, that is, whether the claim is
actionable without reference to the underlying contract.” A&A Glob. Indus., Inc., 2001 WL
1343628, at *3 (applying Texas law).
Memorial Hermann’s factual allegations, which are incorporated into and form the basis
of each of the petition’s counts, implicate the Traditional Contract and, consequentially, its
arbitration provision.

Counts One and Two center on the applicability of the Traditional

Contract, or its terms, to BAV Plan claims, thereby making such claims eligible for the

4

Memorial Hermann’s claim for damages, $17,000,000, is exactly the same under Count One and Count Two,
further illustrating that both counts rely on the validity and applicability of the Traditional Contract. (Dkt. No.
3-1 State Court Pet. ¶¶ 36, 45.)

5

There is “no perceptible difference” between federal and state law when determining the scope of an arbitration
agreement. See Ford, 141 F.3d at 250 n.7; see also A&A Glob. Indus., Inc. v. Wolfe, No. CIV.A.3:01CV1515D, 2001 WL 1343628, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 29, 2001) (noting a determination of the scope of an arbitration
provisions is similar under FAA and TGAA).

13

reimbursement rates agreed to in the Traditional Contract. (See Dkt. No. 3-1 State Court Pet. ¶¶
35-36, 42, 45.) Thus, reference to and evidence relating to the Traditional Contract is essential
for Memorial Hermann to maintain its claims.

The facts implicated by Count Three for

declaratory relief are also “interwoven” with the Traditional Contract because that Count seeks a
declaration that BCBSTX’s claims determinations violate the parties’ contract.

(Id. ¶ 48.)

Resolution of this claim is not possible without reference to the Traditional Contract and
therefore this claim is also subject to arbitration. See Jack B. Anglin Co. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d
266, 271 (Tex. 1992) (confirming a Deceptive Trade Practices Act claim was subject to an
arbitration agreement under the FAA, and adding that “Texas law favors the joint resolution of
multiple claims to prevent multiple determinations of the same matter”); see also Dickey’s
Barbecue Restaurants, Inc. v. Mathieu, No. 3:12-CV-5119-G, 2013 WL 5268976, at *6 (N.D.
Tex. Sept. 18, 2013) (holding that plaintiff’s declaratory judgment cause of action was
arbitrable).
II.

Arbitration is Not Foreclosed by Other Legal Constraints
Memorial Hermann cannot show any legal constraints that would foreclose arbitration

under these facts. This is a simple two-party contract dispute with a valid arbitration provision,
and there are no policy reasons or other statutes that would impact the arbitrability of the claims.
See Folse v. Richard Wolf Med. Instruments Corp., 56 F.3d 603, 605 (5th Cir. 1995) (providing
as an example of a legal constraint when “Congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a
waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue” (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)); see also Fozard v. C.R. England, Inc., 3:16-CV-1334-B, 2017 WL 1036661,
at *4 (N.D. Tex. March 17, 2017) (“The party resisting arbitration must demonstrate that
Congress clearly intended to preclude the parties from waiving their judicial remedies or that
another ground exists at law or equity (such as fraud or coercion) which permits the parties’
14

contract or agreement to be revoked.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
Arbitration is appropriate, and required, in these circumstances.
III.

This Case Should Be Dismissed Under Rule 12(b)(3)
Fifth Circuit case law demonstrates that, when a valid arbitration agreement is applicable,

dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3), rather than a stay of proceedings, is a proper remedy. See, e.g.,
Lim, 404 F.3d at 902 (analyzing Fifth Circuit law, as well as other circuits, to find that it is
proper to grant a Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss in the event of a valid arbitration clause); see
also Mitsui & Co. (USA), Inc. v. MIRA M/V, 111 F.3d 33, 37 (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming a district
court’s grant of a Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause). 6 Because
the claims in this case are subject to a valid arbitration agreement, the case should be dismissed.
CONCLUSION
Because this dispute is subject to a valid and applicable arbitration provision, this Court
should compel arbitration pursuant to Section 4 of the FAA or Section 171.021(a) of the TGAA,
and dismiss this litigation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). See 9 U.S.C. §
4; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 171.021(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3). Alternatively, the Court
should stay the litigation pending arbitration pursuant to Section 3 of the FAA or Section
171.025 of the TGAA. See 9 U.S.C. § 3; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 171.025.

6

There is also support for dismissing on the grounds of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). See, e.g., Omni
Pinnacle, LLC v. ECC Operating Servs., Inc., 255 F. App’x 24, 25–26 (5th Cir. 2007) (affirming district court’s
order dismissing claims under Rule 12(b)(1) and compelling arbitration). To the extent the Court views Rule
12(b)(1) as the proper mechanism for dismissal pursuant to a motion to compel arbitration—and in the
alternative— BCBSTX moves to dismiss on this ground as well.
