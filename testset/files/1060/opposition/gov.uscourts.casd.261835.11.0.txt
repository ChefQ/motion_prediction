PETITIONER'S OPPOSITION TO
RESPONDENT'S MOTION TO DISMISS

No Oral Argument Required

Date: 9 June 2008

Time: 11:00 AM

Courtroom: #4

The Honorable William Q. `Hayes

I. INTRODUCTION

Respondent's MOTION TO DISMISS is based on two issues of law:

(i) alleged failure of Petitioner to exhaust his administrative

remedies;

and (ii) alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

In its MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF

DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS ("MEMO") at 2, Respondent stated:

Hornback's petition for mandamus should be dismissed

because:

II. GUMEN

1. This Court Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction

In its MEMO at 3, Respondent stated:

Second, Hornback's petition only properly invokes the

Mandamus Statute 28 U.S.C. 1361. That statute, however,

does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity.

That first sentence is not correct. The operative statute
which provides sovereign immunity in this action, was correctly set

forth in the PETITION at 7, line 19, as 35 U.S.C. 1310x00B0."

2. Petitioner Has Exhausted His Administrative Remedies

(a) 35 U.S.C. 25] NOT Applicable
In its MEMO at 2 Respondent stated (original emphasis):

The USPTO simply cannot revise his patented claims until
they are substantively reviewed - to determine .
patentability. Rather, as the USPTO has repeatedly told
him, Hornback must file a proper request for a "reissue"
of his patent in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 251.

The operative portion of 35 U.S.C. 251 is the first paragraph

which states in its entirety (emphasis added):

Whenever any patent is, through error without any
deceptive intention, deened wholly or partly inoperative
or invalid, by reason of a defective specification or
drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or
less than he had a right to claim in the patent, the
Director shall, on the surrender of such patent and the (c)
a t_ of the fee uired b w, reissue the patent
for the invention disclosed in the original patent, and
in accordance with a new and amended application, for the
unexpired part of the term of the original patent. No
new matter shall be introduced into the application for
reissue.

* On page 1 of that PETITION, Petitioner made a typographical
error in.stating that the operative statute was 37 U.S.C.
131 instead of 35 U.S.C. 131. However, since the correct
statute was set forth on page 7, Petitioner deemed it

-unnecessary to amend the PETITION. He regrets this error.

Clearly, by requiring the patentee to pay the fee and amend
the application, even though allowed on 17 September 1987, (A22), |
35 U.S.C. 251 applies to the reissuance of a patent, where the
errors in the patent were the fault of the patentee, not the PTO.

(b) PTO Refus to Reissue tent Pursuant to 35 U.S.C.

On 2 August 2007 Petitioner submited an "Amended Petition to.
Reissue Patent No. 6,079,666". In that Amended Petition at 2 (A38)
Petitioner stated:

Alternatively, if the PTO can show that any error in
either the patent specifications or patent claims is the
fault.of of Petitioner, then it should do so, and reissue
the corrected patent pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 251, quality
control and the above-noted apology for the inconvenience
to Petitioner, notwithstanding. In that unlikely event,
Petitioner has enclosed a check (Enclosure 5) in the
amount of $395.00 as the required "small entity" reissue |
fee. | a .

On 8 January 2008, the PTO returned the check and refused to
reissue the patent or even to issue a "CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION":
"The errors requested to be corrected will not be entered. The
broadening of claims may affect patentability of claims". (A41).

Quite the contrary! The requested corrections (A40) would

ow, not broaden, those claims. The indefinite terms in the

printed claims such as "wide bandwidth" (A31; Col. 7, L 12; Col.
8, L 7) and "low-pass" (A31; Col. 7, L 21; Col. 8, L 7) rendered

those claims so broad that Counsel for Defense in Case No. 99-38

Cc, correctly asserted those claims to be invalid for failure to

comply with 35.U.S.C. 112. (A61).-

3. Allowed Claims 3-6 Were Those Filed 11 May 1987

In Respondent's EXHIBIT J at 5-6 (237-238), the PTO stated:

Petitioner did not follow either rule. Therefore the

effective result of the petitioner filing the

Supplemental Response, using the exact same numbering (3-

6) was improper. Petitioner should have numbered the

substitute claims as claims 7-10. At allowance, the

examiner mailed the Notice of Allowance indicating that
claims 3-6 would be allowed. Claims 3-6, filed (sic) May

1, 1987 [were] properly allowed. However, claims 3-6

mailed (sic) May 6, 1987 were, from a review of the

record, never examined, but considered "duplicate" claims
since they were not presented in the manner required by

37 CFR 1.121 or 1.126. ,

That explanation resolves a 20-year-old ambiguity:

EXHIBIT 12 (A52-A53) shows that, on 27 May 1987, the PTO filed
and responded to two sets of claims -- the first on 5/4/87, the
second on 5/11/87. How can the same set of claims simultaneously
`be both "pending" (Item 1, Id.) and "allowed" (Item 3)? "Answer:

e the e set. By their very order, Item 1 indicates
that pending claims 3-6 were those filed 5/4/87, while Item 3
indicates that allowed claims 3-6 were those filed 5/11/87.

That conclusion is supported by a statement `by Counsel for
Defense during a status conference on 19 March 2001, Case No. 99-
38 C, that he had uncovered some errors in the patent claims. (See
Request for Production and Things No. 6, A55). But the printed
claims are, verbatim, comma for comma, period for period, identical
to the first set, filed 4 May 1987. Thus, the point of reference
for the observed errors in the printed claims could only have been
the claims filed-11 May 1987, not those filed 4 May 1987.

Moreover, patent examiners have been shot at dawn for allowing
claims such as those filed 5/4/87 which contain the indefinite

terms cited above. (See Section 2(b) above, last paragraph.

Had the PTO included allowed claims 3-6 as requested (A58),
instead of cancelled claims 1-2 (A14), with the copy of the patent
application it sent Petitioner on 9 June 1999 for validation', and
not lied about why it refused to do so (A59 vis-a-vis A57-A58),
this PETITION would have been unnecessary. (See PETITION at 5-6).

4. Pro Effect of Classification o te: icatio

In Respondent's EXHIBIT J at 7 (239), the PTO stated:

An. examination of this file reveals that patentee is

unfamiliar with patent prosecution procedure. Lack of

' skill in this field usually acts as a liability in
affording the maximum protection for the invention
disclosed. :

But if `Petitioner had disclosed his application to a patent
attorney during patent prosecution -- which was closed 17 September |
1987 (A22) -- and for 12 years thereafter, he would have. been
subjected to 2 years. in prison and a $10,000 fine (35 U.S.C. 186),
and forfeiture of his patent rights (35 U.S.C. 182). (A21).

To verify the above, consider the restrictions set. forth in
the Secrecy Order the PTO imposed on the patent application on 24
August 1987, allegedly pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181 (A21):

The subject matter of the above-identified application

has been determined to be encompassed by .... E.O. 12356, (c)

"National Security Information" and thus is subject to

the "Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding

Classified Information". [ISM].

The principals shall protect the subject matter as
required by the Industrial Security Manual _ for
Safeguarding Classified Information and may disclose the
subject matter of the above-identified application to

other persons having the requisite clearance on a "need-
to-know" basis ... .

? For 13 years Petitioner was denied access to his own patent
application while it was classified at the level of SECRET.

CHse SOS eV OO1E Tg NP Document 11 Filed "eo Page 6 of 17
1 Moreover, on 7 August 1998, the PTO stated (A63, attached):
2 The application is classified as SECRET' and is under

. Secrecy Order which allows access to authorized
3} personnel; i.e. appropriate clearance ona "need- -to-know"

basis.

4

5 To that end, in its MEMO at 3, Respondent stated:

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181, the United States Patent and

6 Trademark Office ("PTO") entered a secrecy order for

Hornback's patent application on August 24, 1987. Id.

7 The secrecy order unequivocally notified Hornback that

8 restrictions applied to his patent application. id.

9 That first.sentence is not correct. 35 U.S.C. 181 was "enacted
10 by congress in 1952. However, Executive order 12356, and its
rn implementing directive, the ISM -- the source of those restrictions
12 -- were not issued until 1982! Therefore, in 1952 Congress did
13| not `issue, and could not have issued, a Secrecy Order which
4 mandated compliance with Executive Order 12356 and the ISM, neither
15 of which even existed until 30 years after it enacted that statute. -
16 As a result, that Secrecy Order was not imposed pursuant to 35
7 U.S.C. 181. Accordingly, those restrictions were not legally
18 binding on Petitioner, and no Court has ever held otherwise!

19 For 13 years, those restrictions prevented Petitioner, a
90 private citizen with no personnel or facility security clearance,
91 from possessing a copy of his own patent application, and from
99\ disclosing the subject matter in that. application to a patent
93 attorney for legal representation. - See DECLARATION OF .NED A.
o4 ISRAELSEN (A64), a registered Patent Attorney, who, on 29 October
oF 1992, stated under oath: "4. Because I could not get access to the
96 patent application, I was unable to represent Mr. Hornback".

Those unauthorized harsh restrictions resulting from the
`classification of the patent application at the level of SECRET |
pursuant to Executive Order 12356, are a far cry from the benign }
restrictions actually authorized by congress in 35 U.S.C. 181, as
set forth in the so-called "TYPE I" Secrecy Order which states
(A66):

The principals may disclose, for legitimate business

purposes, the subject matter of the above-identified

application to a U.S. citizen or to a person who is both
admitted lawfully into the United States for permanent
- residence and is located in the United States provided

the U.S. citizen or person is furnished with a copy of

this Secrecy Order and is informed that this Secrecy

Order is applicable to the subject matter disclosed.

III. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Whenever the subject matter in a patent application is
sufficiently sensitive to warrant protection in the interest of
national security, the Government may either: (i) impose a Secrecy
Order (A65) on that application pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181, which
withholds the patent from issue, and then compensate the inventor
under 35 U.S.C. 183; or (ii) if, as here, unauthorized disclosure
could cause serious damage to the national security (see PETITION
- at 2), then acquire a proprietary interest in (i.e., take) that
application (A69) and classify it at the level of SECRET.
But once the application is declassified, the Secrecy Order
rescinded, and the issue fee timely paid, the inventor is entitled |
_to a patent under 35 U.S.C. 131, which conforns to the allowed
patent application (A22), and not bastardized by errors inserted
by the PTO either for business or for counterintelligence purposes.
Being ever mindful of the national security issues involved,
Petitioner permitted those issues to trump all issues regarding PTO
rules. He, therefore, acted as a pro se applicant. As such, he
did, indeed, fail to number amended claims 3-6 as new claims 7-10.
So if this Court grants instant MOTION based on that one oversight,
while overlooking the documented PTO lies and shenanigans, it would
still be a small price to pay for the satisfaction of knowing that,
in the process, no national security information was compromised.
Drastic wrongs? You bet!

WHEREFORE, Respondent's MOTION TO DISMISS should be denied.

The application is Classified as SECRET and is under Secrecy Order which allows access to authorized
personnel; i.e. appropriate clearance ona "need-to-know" basis. The case cannot be released from our area but

could be reviewed here. I'm assuming the request is coming from Dept. of Justice regarding a Civil action. Give
