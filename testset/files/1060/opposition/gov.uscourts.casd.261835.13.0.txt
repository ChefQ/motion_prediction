\ 18 _  Respondent's MOTION TO DISMISS is based on two issues of law:

21) In its MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF

1 II. RG N
2 1. his Court Has Subject tter Jurisdictio
3} In its MEMO at 3, Respondent stated:
4 Second, Hornback's petition only properly invokes the
Mandamus Statute 28 U.S.C. 1361. That statute, however,
5 does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity.
6 That first sentence is not correct. The operative statute
7|| which waives sovereign immunity in this action, was correctly set
8|| forth in the PETITION at'7, line 19, as 35 U.S.C. 1310x00B0.
9}. 2. Petitic as austed Hi inistrative edie
10 (a) 35 US. cent. 251 NOT Applicable
11 In its MEMO at 2 Respondent stated (original emphasis) :
12 The USPTO simply cannot revise his patented claims until
they are substantively reviewed - to determine .
13] patentability. Rather, as the USPTO has repeatedly told
him, Hornback must file a proper request for a "reissue"
14 of his patent in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 251.
15 The operative portion of 35 U.S.C. 251 is the first paragraph
16|| which states in its entirety (emphasis added):
17 Whenever any patent is, through error without any
deceptive intention, deened wholly or partly inoperative
18 or invalid, by reason of a defective specification or
drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or
19 less than he had a `right to claim in the patent, the
Director shall, on the surrender of such patent and the (c)
20 payment of the fee required by law, reissue the patent
for the invention disclosed in the original patent, and
21) in accordance with a new and amended application, for the
" unexpired part of the term of the original patent. No
22 new matter shall be introduced into the application for
reissue. :
23
24
25
26)| > On page 1 of that PETITION, Petitioner made a typographical
97 error in stating that the operative statute was 37 U.S.C.
131 instead of 35 U.S.C. 131. However, since the correct
98 statute was set forth on page 7, Petitioner deemed it

unnecessary to amend the PETITION.- He regrets this error.

1 Clearly, by requiring the patentee to pay the fee and amend
2 `the application, even though allowed on 17 September 1987, (A22),
3|| 35 U.S.C. 251 applies to the reissuance of a patent, where the
4|| errors in the patent were the fault of the patentee, not the PTO.
5 (b) PTO Refused to Reissue Patent Pursuant to 35 U.S.C.
6 On 2 August 2007 Petitioner submitted an "Amended Petition to
7|| Reissue Patent No. 6,079,666". In that Amended Petition at 2 (A38)
8 Petitioner stated:
9} |. ; Alternatively, if the PTO can show that any error in
either the patent specifications or patent claims is the
10 fault.of of Petitioner, then it should do so, and reissue
the corrected patent pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 251, quality
11 control and the above-noted apology for the inconvenience
to Petitioner, notwithstanding. In that unlikely event,
12 Petitioner has enclosed a check (Enclosure 5) in the
. amount of $395.00 as the required "small entity" reissue .
13) fee. . -
14 On 8 January 2008, the PTO returned the check and refused to
15 reissue the patent or even to issue a "CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION"
16|| with the terse statement: "The errors requested to be corrected in
17 the claims will not be entered. The broadening of claims may
18|| affect patentability of claims". (A41). |
19 Quite the contrary!) The requested corrections (A40) would
20 a ow, not broaden, those claims. The indefinite terms in the
21) printed claims such as "wide bandwidth" (A312; Col. 7, L 12; Col.
99 8, L 7) and "low-pass" (A31; Col. 7, L 21; Col. 8, L 7) rendered
23|| those claims so broad that Counsel for Defense: in related case No.
24 99-38 C, correctly asserted those claims to be invalid for failure
25|| to comply with 35 U.S.C. 112. (A61).

3. Allowed Claims 3-6 Were Those Filed 11 May 1987
In Respondent's EXHIBIT J at 5-6 (237-238), the PTO stated:

Petitioner did not follow either rule. Therefore the
effective result of the petitioner filing the
Supplemental Response, using the exact same. numbering (3-
6) was improper. Petitioner should have numbered the
substitute claims as claims 7-10. At allowance, the
examiner mailed the Notice of Allowance indicating that
Claims 3-6 would be allowed. Claims 3-6, filed (sic) May
1, 1987 [were] properly allowed. However, claims 3-6
mailed (sic) May 6, 1987 were, from a review of the
record, never examined, but considered "duplicate" claims
since they were not presented in the manner required by
37 CFR 1.121 or 1.126.

That explanation resolves a 20-year-old ambiguity: EXHIBIT 12
(A52-A53) shows that, on 27 May 1987, the PTO responded to two sets
of claims -- the first was filed on 5/4/87, the second, on 5/11/87.

Now, how can the same set of claims be simultaneously . "pending"

| (Item'1, Id.) and "allowed" (Item 3)? Answer: They are NOT the |

same set. By their very order, Item 1 indicates that the pending
set was the first set filed on 5/4/87, whereas Item 3 indicates
that the allowed set was the set later filed on 5/11/87.

That conclusion is supported by a statement by Counsel for
Defense during a status conference on 19 March 2001, Case No. 99-
38 C, that he had uncovered some errors in the patent claims. (See
Request for Production and Things No. 6, A55). But the printed
Claims are, verbatim, comma for comma, period for period, identical

to the first set, filed 4 May 1987. Thus, the point of reference

for the observed errors in the printed claims could only have been

the claims filed-11 May 1987, not those filed 4 May 1987.
Moreover, patent examiners have been shot at dawn for allowing
claims such as those filed 5/4/87 which contain the indefinite

terms cited above. (See Section 2(b) above, last paragraph).

a
Had the PTO included allowed claims 3-6 as requested (A58),
instead of cancelled claims 1-2 (Al4), with the copy of the patent
application it sent Petitioner on 9 June 1999 for validation', and
not lied about why it refused to do so (A59 vis-a-vis A57-A58),
this PETITION would have been unnecessary. (See PETITION at 5-6).
4. ofou ect of C assification o tent A icatio
In Respondent's EXHIBIT J at 7 (239), the PTO stated:
An examination of this file reveals that patentee is
unfamiliar. with patent prosecution procedure. Lack of
- skill in this field usually acts as a liability in
affording the maximum protection for _the invention
disclosed. . cent

But if Petitioner had disclosed his application to a patent

attorney during patent prosecution -- which was closed 17 September |

| 1987 (A22) -- and for 12 years thereafter, he would have. been

subjected to 2 years. in prison and a $10,000 fine (35 U.S.C. 186),
and forfeiture of his patent rights (35 U.S.c. 182). -(A21).

To verify the above, consider the restrictions set. forth in
the Secrecy order the PTO imposed on the patent application on 24
August 1987, allegedly pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181 (A21): |

The subject matter of the above-identified application
' has been determined: to be encompassed by .... E.O. 12356, (c)
"National Security Information" and thus is subject to
the "Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding

Classified Information". [ISM].

The principals shall protect the subject matter as
required by the Industrial Security Manual for
Safeguarding Classified Information and may disclose the
subject matter of the above-identified application to
other persons having the requisite clearance on a "need-
to-know" basis ... .

Moreover, on 7 August 1998, the PTO stated (A63, attached):
The application is classified as SECRET' and is under

Secrecy Order which allows access to authorized

personnel; i.e. appropriate clearance on a "need-to-know"
basis. Lo

To that end, in its MEMO at 3, Respondent stated:

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181, the United States Patent and

Trademark Office ("PTO") entered a secrecy order for

Hornback's patent application on August 24, 1987. Id.

The secrecy order unequivocally notified Hornback that

restrictions applied to his patent application. id.

That first. sentence is not correct. 35 U.S.C. 181 was enacted
by Congress in 1952. However, Executive Order 12356, and its
implementing directive, the ISM -- the source of those restrictions
-- were not issued until 1982! Therefore, in 1952 Congress did
not authorize, and could not have authorized, a Secrecy Order which
' mandated compliance with Executive Order 12356 and the ISM, neither
of which even existed until 30 years after it enacted that statute.
As a result, that Secrecy Order was not imposed pursuant to 35.
U.S.C. 181. Accordingly, those restrictions were not legally
binding on Petitioner, and no Court has ever held otherwise!

For years, those restrictions prevented Petitioner, a
private citizen with no personnel or facility security clearance,
from possessing a copy of his own patent application, and from
disclosing the subject matter in that application. to a patent
attorney for legal representation. See DECLARATION OF .NED A.
ISRAELSEN (A644), a registered Patent attorney, who, on 29 October

1992, stated under oath: "4. Because I could not get access to the

patent application, I was unable to represent Mr. Hornback".

Those harsh unauthorized restrictions resulting from the
classification of the patent application at the level of SECRET |
pursuant to Executive Order 12356, are a far ery from the benign |:
restrictions actually authorized by congress in 35 U.S.C. 181, as
set forth in the so-called "TYPE I" Secrecy Order which states
(A66): |

The principals may disclose, for legitimate business

purposes, the subject matter of the above-identified

application to a U.S. citizen or to a person who is both
admitted lawfully into the United States for permanent
- residence and is located in the United States provided

the U.S. citizen or person is furnished with a copy of

this Secrecy Order and is informed that this Secrecy

Order is applicable to the subject matter disclosed.

III. S0x00A7S A ONCLUSTO

Whenever the subject matter in a patent application is|
sufficiently sensitive to warrant protection in the interest of |.
national security, the Government may either: (i) impose a Secrecy
Order (A65) on that application pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181, which
withholds the patent from issue, and then compensate the inventor.
under 35 U.s.c. 183; or (ii) if, as here, unauthorized disclosure

could cause serious damage to the national security (see PETITION

oon oaw ke why

- at, 2), then acquire a proprietary interest in (izes, take) that
10 application (A69) and classify it at the level of SECRET.

11 But once the application is declassified, the Secrecy Order
12}} rescinded, and the issue fee timely paid, the inventor is entitled
13}| to a patent under 35 U.S.C. 131, which conforms to the allowed

14]} patent application (A22), and not bastardized by errors inserted

 

15 by the PTO either for business or for counterintelligence purposes.
16 Being ever mindful of the national security. issues involved,
17 Petitioner permitted those issues to trump all issues regarding PTO
18]}| rules. He, therefore, acted as a pro se applicant. As such, he
19)| dia, indeed, fail to number amended claims 3-6 as new claims. 7-10.
20|) so if this Court grants instant: MOTION based on that one oversight,
21|| while overlooking the documented PTO lies and shenanigans, it would
221] still be a small price to pay for the satisfaction of knowing that,

23]| in the process, no national security information was compromised.

 

24) | Drastic wrongs? You bet!
25 WHEREFORE, Respondent's MOTION TO DISMISS should be denied.
