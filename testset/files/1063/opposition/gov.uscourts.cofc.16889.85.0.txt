DEFENDANT'S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S
MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Pursuant to the Court's Rules, defendant, the United States, respectfully responds to the
motion filed on May 30, 2006 by plaintiff, Huntleigh USA Corporation, requesting the Court to
order the production of documents withheld by the Government in discovery upon the grounds of
deliberative process privilege.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
The Government, having produced more than 25,000 pages of documents, served its
privilege log in December 2005. See Pl. Mot. 2. On January 17, 2006, in response to an inquiry
from Huntleigh during a hearing on another motion, this Court ordered the Government to
"certify that the agency head of the Transportation Security Administration personally considered
the contents of, and authorized the assertion of deliberative process/pre-decisional executive
privilege with regard to, each document for which the defendant asserts that privilege." Pl. Mot.
Exh. B. On May 11, 2006, after, among other things, substantially reducing the number of
documents with respect to which we assert the privilege, the Government provided Huntleigh
with a declaration of Edmund "Kip" Hawley, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland

Security, Transportation Security Administration, also known as the "TSA Administrator." Pl.
Mot. Exh. D.
Mr. Hawley states in his declaration that he "personally reviewed each of the documents"
at issue "and determined that the deliberative process privilege applies, for the reasons stated" in
the declaration. Hawley Dec. ¶ 3. Mr. Hawley conducted his personal review of the documents,
as we believed Huntleigh and the Court understood he would, after the Court's January 17, 2006
order and, perforce, after the Government served its discovery responses and privilege log in this
case. The Government has never stated or otherwise attempted to represent that the TSA
Administrator was personally involved in, or approved, the initial assertion of deliberative
process privilege by Government counsel during discovery. As demonstrated below, the
Administrator's involvement at an earlier point was not required.
Mr. Hawley describes in his affidavit 18 "documents" (some of which are collections of
documents, such as e-mail messages) for which he has determined to invoke the deliberative
process privilege. Among them are 13 documents created during the drafting of testimony that
was delivered on January 22, 2002, by John Magaw, then the Under Secretary of Transportation
for Security, before the aviation subcommittee of the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, concerning the agency's progress in implementing the requirements of the
Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 ("ATSA"), and the state of aviation security.
Id. ¶¶ 4-6. The other documents include e-mails discussing whether TSA should reimburse
airlines for their subcontracting of airport security services, absent a contractual obligation upon
the Government's part to reimburse the air carrier for those costs, id. ¶¶ 7, 9; e-mails discussing
how to respond to a request by the chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, Rep. John

Mica, to meet with a contractor preparing a study for TSA, before the completion of that report,
id. ¶ 8; and an undated draft report entitled, "Oversight of Security Screener Contracts" prepared
by the Office of Inspector General, Department of Transportation, which bears handwritten notes
and appended to which is a three-page memorandum dated December 17, 2002 from Admiral
James Loy, then the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security, to the Inspector General,
commenting on the draft report and identifying actions that TSA intended to take in response to
the issues raised in the draft. Id. ¶ 10.
Huntleigh argues in its May 30, 2006 motion that, contrary to the allegedly "uniform case
law of this Court regarding the deliberative process privilege, [the Government] failed to
properly and timely assert the privilege in the first instance, then submitted a post hoc, facially
inadequate declaration by the head of the TSA." Pl. Mot. 2. Huntleigh asks the Court to hold the
privilege inapplicable to all of the documents and order their immediate production. Id. at 10.
We demonstrate below that the Court should deny the motion in its entirety, as our invocation of
the privilege is both procedurally correct and substantively sound.
ARGUMENT
I.

The Government's Assertion Of Privilege Is Procedurally Proper
This Court recognizes the deliberative process (also called Governmental or executive)

privilege for "inter- and intra-agency deliberative communications or official information," in
order to shield from disclosure "'documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and
deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are
formulated.'" CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 680, 686 (1987) (quoting Carl
Zeiss, Stiftung v. V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, Jena, 40 F.R.D. 318, 324 (D.D.C. 1966), aff'd, 384 F.2d 979

(D.C. Cir. 1967)). Documents qualifying for the privilege must have been created in advance of
a "policy" decision, Walsky Constr. Co v. United States, 20 Cl. Ct. 317, 320 (1990), and must
reflect the "interchange of recommendations and deliberations that contribute to the
decisionmaking or policymaking process." CACI, 12 Cl. Ct. at 687.
Courts have upheld assertions of Governmental privilege as to entire documents that
contain both deliberative and strictly factual material, when the two are necessarily intertwined.
See, e.g., Kaiser Alum. & Chem. Corp. v. United States, 141 Ct. Cl. 38, 157 F. Supp. 939,
942-44 (1979). Agency heads or their direct delegees must provide sworn, "precise and certain
reasons" supporting nondisclosure. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. 128,
135 (2006) ("PG&E"); Walsky, 20 Cl. Ct. at 320; see also Marriott Inter. Resorts, L.P. v. United
States, 437 F.3d 1302, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Although this Court ordered the Government to
provide a statement by the head of TSA in support of the deliberative process privilege prior to
Huntleigh's filing any motion, that is not the ordinary procedure in the Court of Federal Claims.
Huntleigh relies upon PG&E as an alleged example of "the uniform case law of this
Court" supporting the argument that the agency head must personally invoke the deliberative
process privilege "at the time" the Government first asserts the privilege in discovery. Pl. Mot. 2,
5; see also id. at 6 (referring to "settled case law"). Huntleigh is mistaken about both PG&E and
the weight of prior precedent. Rather, the practice of this Court, and most (but not all) other
Federal courts, has been to require the agency head to execute a sworn statement in support of the
deliberative process privilege only in connection with the Government's response to a motion to
compel production of the documents which were withheld upon the basis of the privilege. Had
the Court held in PG&E that the deliberative process privilege must be formally invoked by the

agency head at the time a privilege log is produced, or else the assertion of privilege is invalid,
that ruling would be contrary to the weight of authority and unprecedented in this circuit.
However, in an unpublished order in April 2006, granting in part and denying in part the
Government's motion for reconsideration of the published PG&E decision, the PG&E Court
clarified that it had not held that the Government "waived the right to assert the deliberative
process privilege by waiting until it responded to plaintiff's motion to compel to execute
affidavits in support of its assertion of the privilege . . . . Rather, the court merely found such
practice to be 'procedurally deficient,' thereby eroding the credibility of defendant's claim of the
privilege." Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. United States, No. 04-74C, slip op. at 4 (Fed. Cl. April 27,
2006) (quoting 70 Fed. Cl. at 143), avail. in CM/ECF. The PG&E Court expressly
"recognize[d]" on reconsideration, furthermore, "that there are authorities that have stated that
the deliberative process privilege need not be formally invoked until after the opposing party files
a motion to compel. See e.g., In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 741 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Abramson
v. United States, 39 Fed. Cl. 290, 294 n.3 (1997)." Slip op. at 5 n.3 (emphasis added).
This Court has long followed the procedure endorsed in Sealed Case and Abramson for
invoking and supporting the deliberative process privilege. Contrary to PG&E, this settled
practice is not "procedurally deficient." 70 Fed. Cl. at 143. In addition to the two decisions cited
by the PG&E Court on reconsideration, decisions of this Court, the Court of Claims, and other
courts which support the position that the agency head may prepare and execute an affidavit
invoking a Governmental privilege after the Government's initial discovery responses, in
response to a motion to compel, include, e.g., Kaiser Aluminum, 157 F. Supp. at 947 (sustaining
assertion of privilege based upon letter provided after motion to compel was filed); CACI Field

Services, 12 Cl. Ct. at 683 & n.6 (sustaining assertion in part, based upon affidavit attached to
opposition to motion to compel); DOE v. Brett, 659 F.2d 154, 155 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1981)
("[A]ffidavits or testimony are necessary . . . only if the agency wishes to avoid in camera
inspection of the documents . . . ."); and Tri-State Hospital Supply Corp. v. United States, 226
F.R.D. 118, 134 n.13 (D.D.C. 2005) ("[T]he government had no obligation to formally invoke
the privilege in advance of the motion to compel[.]"). See also SEC v. Downe, No. 92-Civ-4092,
1994 WL 23141, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 1994) (applying Local Rule to assertion of
investigative files privilege); National Inst. of Mil. Justice v. DoD, 404 F. Supp. 2d 325, 339-40
(D.D.C. 2005) (relying upon supplemental declaration filed in Freedom of Information Act case).
But see, e.g., Anderson v. Marion Cty. Sheriffs Dept., 220 F.R.D. 555 (S.D. Ind. 2004); Miller v.
Pancucci, 141 F.R.D. 292 (C.D. Cal. 1992), cited in Pl. Mot. 5-6.
Huntleigh also cites Jade Trading, LLC v. United States, 65 Fed. Cl. 487 (2005), in
support of its argument that the agency head's decision to invoke deliberative process privilege
must be contemporaneous with the Government's discovery responses. Pl. Mot. 6. But Jade
Trading does not so hold – or even support that argument. To the contrary, after rejecting the
Government's "purported invocation of the executive privilege by individuals other than the head
of an agency or department," this Court granted the Government approximately two weeks
either to produce the documents at issue "or [to] submit declarations asserting the privilege by
the Commissioner of the IRS and the Secretary of the Treasury." 65 Fed. Cl. at 497 (emphasis
added). Had the Court agreed with Huntleigh that the privilege is forfeited unless the agency
head personally approves the invocation of the privilege in the Government's privilege log, it
would not have allowed the Government the opportunity to prepare and file new declarations.

See also Cobell v. Norton, 213 F.R.D. 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2003) ("Defendants will be provided with an
opportunity to submit an affidavit that conforms with the requirements for proper invocation of
the privilege . . . ."); Scott Paper Co. v. United States, 943 F. Supp. 489, 498 (E.D. Pa. 1996)
(similar); Pierson v. United States, 428 F. Supp. 384, 395 (D. Del. 1977) (similar).
The Government provided Mr. Hawley's declaration to plaintiff, at the Court's direction,
before Huntleigh filed the instant motion. See Pl. Mot. 3. As noted above, a declaration of the
agency head is not ordinarily required until after a motion has been filed. Accordingly, the
Government has amply satisfied the procedural requirements under this Court's case law for
asserting the deliberative process privilege during discovery, and for supporting that assertion.
Huntleigh somewhat confusingly raises the issue of whether there was a "formal
delegation" of Mr. Hawley's authority to determine the applicability of the deliberative process
privilege. Pl. Mot. 3, 6. As Mr. Hawley is the head of TSA, which is a distinct agency, see 6
U.S.C. § 203; 49 U.S.C. § 114(b), no delegation was necessary and none occurred. Huntleigh
appears to be arguing that Mr. Hawley could or should have "delegated" to counsel of record
from the Department of Justice the authority to assert the privilege in the Government's discovery
responses. As noted above, the weight of authority requires no such delegation. This should not
be surprising, given that involving agency heads in discovery responses on a routine basis, prior
to any motion practice challenging an assertion of privilege, would be impracticable.
II.

Mr. Hawley Identifies Proper Grounds For Invoking the Privilege
Huntleigh argues that, assuming the privilege was timely invoked, Mr. Hawley's

declaration does not provide the necessary "precise and certain reasons" why the confidentiality
of the documents should be maintained. Pl. Mot. 7-9 (quoting Walsky, 20 Cl. Ct. at 320).

Huntleigh cites what it terms "examples" of this alleged defect. Id. at 8. However, because
Huntleigh makes specific arguments only with respect to these "examples," those are the only
arguments to which we can, or need, respond.1
Huntleigh's entire criticism of Mr. Hawley's discussion of the series of e-mails and other
documents relating to the congressional testimony delivered in January 2002 by the Under
Secretary of Transportation for Security (documents 1-13) is the allegation that Mr. Hawley does
not "refer[] to any final agency policy that resulted." Id. This is neither true nor relevant. It is
untrue, in that Mr. Hawley explains that, because the Aviation and Transportation Security Act
had been enacted only approximately 60 days before Mr. Magaw's testimony, the preparation of
that testimony necessarily presented "numerous, fundamental policy decisions regarding how to
measure TSA's progress in meeting the requirements of ATSA, how to define TSA's broader
mission, and how to communicate these conclusions to Congress." Hawley Dec. ¶ 4.
The policy questions were what could and should be said in an open session of Congress
about the status of aviation security. The language chosen by Mr. Magaw after the deliberations
during drafting appears in the text of the testimony as delivered (which has been produced to
plaintiff). See id. ¶¶ 4-6. "Disclosing these [drafting documents] would disclose frank
discussions of this policy matter and could inhibit open intra-agency debate in similar
circumstances." Id. ¶ 5. It is difficult to imagine what further explanation could be provided, or
would be useful. Huntleigh's criticism is irrelevant, moreover, because the deliberative process
"privilege [is not] negated by defendant's failure, in some cases, to identify a later, specific
1

Should the Court conclude that any of Huntleigh's arguments may have merit, we
respectfully request the opportunity to submit the pertinent document or documents for in camera
review. See Sealed Case, 121 F.3d at 735-36.

agency decision that was based on the 'pre-decisional' documents." Yankee Atomic Elec. Co.
v. United States, 54 Fed. Cl. 306, 312 (2002) (citing NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S.
132, 153 n.18 (1975) (construing Freedom of Information Act)).
Huntleigh asserts without elaboration that "document 16 appears to be an utterly
unprivileged e-mail chain unconnected to the adoption of any agency policy . . . ." Pl. Mot. 8.
However, Mr. Hawley explains that
[t]he policy matter discussed in these e-mails is whether the agency
should clear its contractor, Bearing Point, to discuss its preliminary
findings and conclusions directly with Rep. John Mica, chairman
of the House aviation subcommittee, before completing its report
[on a private security screening pilot program]. Disclosure of the
contents of these documents would reveal internal policy
deliberations regarding appropriate communications with
Congress, as well as how to evaluate the pilot program, and could
inhibit open debate in similar circumstances.
Hawley Dec. ¶ 8. The TSA head has, therefore, identified the specific policy questions at issue
in these communications and the specific harm that could result from their disclosure. Huntleigh
offers no reasoned response.
Huntleigh argues that Mr. Hawley's description of document 18 contains "no detail as to
how it contributed to the give-and-take of the deliberative process or any resulting definitive
agency policy." Pl. Mot. 8. Mr. Hawley plainly states, however, that the document consists of a
draft report by the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General, concerning
contract administration by TSA, and TSA's comments responding to the Inspector General's draft
recommendations for agency action. Hawley Dec. ¶ 10. Document 18 not only "contributed to
. . . give-and-take," Pl. Mot. 8 – it is give and take regarding specific policy recommendations.
"Agencies are, and properly should be, engaged in a continuing process of examining their
9

policies; this process will generate memoranda containing recommendations which do not ripen
into agency decisions; and the lower courts should be wary of interfering with this process."
Sears, 421 U.S. at 153 n.18. Despite Huntleigh's desire for additional "detail," Pl. Mot. 8, the
TSA Administrator's affidavit amply supports the assertion of deliberative process privilege with
respect to document number 18.
Huntleigh's only other argument regarding the substance of Mr. Hawley's declaration is
that the Administrator "makes [only] boiler-plate assertions of harm . . . ." Pl. Mot. 8. Huntleigh
cites no examples. In fact, Mr. Hawley describes with particularity why each type of document at
issue should not be disclosed. It is impossible, of course, for anyone to predict with certainty that
the disclosure of any particular document will lead to specific undesirable consequences.
However, Mr. Hawley explains TSA's legitimate interest in preserving the confidentiality of each
of these documents, in order to foster frank and robust policy debate within the agency.
See Sears, 421 U.S. at 153 n.18. Huntleigh's argument, in a footnote, that the concerns of the
agency head can be addressed by making these documents subject to the protective order in this
case is unprecedented and should be rejected, as it proves too much and would effectively negate
the privilege in every case. Pl. Mot. 8 n.4.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons given above, we respectfully request the Court to deny plaintiff's motion
to compel.
