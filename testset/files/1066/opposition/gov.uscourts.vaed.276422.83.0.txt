Civil Action No. 3:12cv97

PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO EXCEED PAGE LIMITATION OF LOCAL CIVIL RULE 7(F)(3)
COME NOW the Plaintiffs, by counsel, and as for their Memorandum in Opposition to
the Defendant’s Motion To Exceed Page Limitation Of Local Civil Rule 7(F)(3) (Docket No.
81), they state as follows:
On February 5, 2014 the Defendant filed a motion seeking permission to file an
opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification in excess of the thirty pages permitted by
Local Rule 7(F)(3). It seeks permission to file a fifty-page brief in response, a request that is
generally regarded with disfavor. State v. West, 862 P.2d 192 (1993) (overruled on other grounds
by, State v. Rodriguez, 961 P.2d 1006 (1998)). Plaintiffs oppose this motion.
Defendant argues that it needs twenty additional pages in which to respond to Plaintiffs’
class certification brief because the Plaintiffs present a “completely different” class definition
than the one alleged in their Amended Complaint and that this new definition “fundamentally
change[s] the dynamic of the class claim”. This is simply incorrect. In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel
discussed the class definition and legal theories raised in their motion for class certification with
defense counsel before the Plaintiffs’ initial complaint was even filed. The Defendant has now

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 83 Filed 02/05/14 Page 2 of 4 PageID# 956

had over a year and a half to litigate this case and focus in on the pertinent issues. Plaintiffs’
arguments are no surprise to the Defendant and certainly do not raise any “new issues”. In fact,
several of the cases that Plaintiffs cited in their class certification brief are the same cases that the
Defendant relied on in its summary judgment motion. The Defendant simply has no good-faith
basis to request an additional twenty pages for its opposition.
And even if that was not the case, the class definition in the Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in
Support of their Motion for Class Certification is not substantially more complex such that an
increased page limit would be necessary. In fact, Plaintiffs specifically narrowed the class
definition in order to limit the number of potential class members and moot certain defenses that
the Defendants could use to attack class certification. Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Class
Certification, 18. (ECF No. 72).
The Defendant cannot demonstrate that “good cause” exists to justify the requested
extension. First, and most importantly, the Plaintiffs would be materially and substantially
prejudiced if the Defendant was granted an additional twenty pages for its opposition brief.
Plaintiffs have already submitted their Motion for Class Certification and limited their brief to
thirty pages in compliance with the Local Rules. In doing so, Plaintiffs eliminated many pages
before filing the final version of their brief. This required Plaintiffs to limit the breadth of the
arguments that they presented to the court and abbreviate or eliminate others altogether. In fact,
Plaintiffs’ counsel spent nearly an entire day editing their brief with the sole purpose of bringing
their brief to within the page limits mandated by this Court's Local Rules. It required several of
Plaintiffs’ attorneys in succession to pare down the brief sufficiently such that they were still
able to make the more critical points of their arguments. They did so because this Court's Rules
are not “suggestions”, or “goals for the parties to shoot for”. They are Rules. They define the

playing field. Plaintiffs complied with these Rules, and they would be materially prejudiced if
the Defendant was granted an additional 20 pages—2/3 of the length of an additional brief—for
its opposition.
Finally, the Court should note the timing of this Request. While Plaintiffs’ counsel have
the highest regard for their Troutman Sanders opponents, this firm has litigated opposite
Plaintiffs’ counsel on many of these types of motions before. This Defendant necessarily
understood that the issues were complex. It could have requested an additional twenty pages for
its brief before Plaintiffs filed their Motion, or it could have proposed a consent order such that
Plaintiffs would not have to show their hand first subject to the strictures of the page
limitation. Instead, it waited until Plaintiffs had already complied with the Court’s Rules and
then after the Plaintiffs’ showed their hand, it decided to seek additional pages for its
opposition—a benefit not afforded to the Plaintiffs.
Because the Plaintiffs would suffer material prejudice if the Defendant’s motion was
granted, and due to the timing of the Defendant’s motion, it should be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
