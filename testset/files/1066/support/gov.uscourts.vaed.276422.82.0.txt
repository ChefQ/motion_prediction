CORELOGIC NATIONAL
BACKGROUND DATA, LLC
Defendant.
DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION TO EXCEED PAGE LIMITATION OF LOCAL CIVIL RULE 7(F)(3)
Defendant, CoreLogic National Background Data, LLC (“NBD”), by counsel, submits
this memorandum in support of its motion to exceed the page limitation set forth in Local Civil
Rule 7(F)(3) for NBD’s memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.
ARGUMENT
On January 3, 2014, Plaintiffs’ filed their Motion for Class Certification (Dkt. No. 70)
and memorandum in support thereof (“Certification Memorandum”) (Dkt. No. 72) seeking
certification of a class of over 1.7 million individuals, claiming statutory damages of up $170
million to $1.7 billion, as well as requesting punitive damages.
Plaintiffs’ Certification Memorandum raises many complex issues, which NBD will
contend include the lack of Article III standing of some putative class members due to the overbreath of the proposed class definition, numerous fatal ascertainability issues, and other factual
defects with Plaintiffs’ typicality, commonality, and superiority arguments that preclude class
certification here.
Moreover, and most importantly, Plaintiffs seek certification of a class under a revised
definition that is completely different than the definition alleged in the Amended Complaint

Case 3:12-cv-00097-REP Document 82 Filed 02/05/14 Page 2 of 5 PageID# 951

(Dkt. No. 30). Plaintiffs’ revised proposed class definition is based on a theory of liability under
§ 1681k(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that implicates NBD’s transmission of Social
Security numbers. Not only does this new class definition fundamentally change the dynamic of
the class claim, it also requires NBD to address several new issues in its opposition.
Moreover, the forthcoming arguments against certification have occurred in the context
of a case where NBD has produced over 100,000 pages of documents during the two years that
this case has been pending, as well as NBD’s production of an entire database consisting of
millions of criminal records. NBD also engaged a nationally-prominent expert witness, who
produced a detailed report on issues relating to class certification. Indeed, the parties have
previously (and jointly) represented to the Court the complexity of this case and their cooperative
discovery efforts to overcome that complexity. (See Dkt Nos. 35, 45, 51, and 54.)
Given enormity of the class Plaintiffs seek to certify and the number of complex issues
that NBD must address in opposition to the Certification Memorandum, NBD respectfully
requests that the Court allow it to file a memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Class Certification not to exceed 50 pages. Granting NBD additional pages will allow the Court
to engage in the “rigorous analysis” required before deciding whether to certify a class in this
case. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011). As of the submission of this
memorandum, NBD’s counsel is deeply engaged in crafting a concise but comprehensive brief,
and they represent to the Court that, in their professional opinion, 50 pages is the minimum
number of pages necessary to present all of the critical issues.
Local Civil Rule 7(F)(3) states that “[e]xcept for good cause shown in advance of filing,
opening and responsive briefs . . . shall not exceed thirty (30) 8-1/2 x 11 inch pages” in length.
Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced if NBD is given additional pages for its opposition to respond to
the arguments previously made by Plaintiffs in the opening motion. And, NBD has offered to

consent to Plaintiffs being afforded 35 pages for their reply brief, which is itself a proportionally
larger extension that what NBD seeks here for its opposition brief. This motion is also made in
advance of the deadline for the filing of NBD’s memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion
for Class Certification. Nor will granting NBD the additional pages requested disrupt the
agreed-to briefing schedule on class certification.
The granting of this motion is also consistent with NBD’s having consented to Plaintiffs’
three prior requests to extend the discovery cutoff, Dkt. Nos. 35, 44, and 56, as well as NBD’s
prior consent on two occasions to provide Plaintiffs with an additional sixteen days to file their
Motion for Class Certification. See Dkt. Nos. 59, 61.
The complexity and seriousness of this case, Plaintiffs’ brand new class definition, as
well as NBD’s good faith offer to provide a more-than-reciprocal page limit extension to
Plaintiffs in connection with their reply brief, all provide good cause for the modest requested
extension herein.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, Defendant, CoreLogic National Background Data, LLC, respectfully
requests that the Court: (1) grant its Motion to Exceed Page Limitation Contained in Local Rule
7; (2) provide NBD leave to file memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class
Certification, not to exceed 50 pages; and (3) award NBD any such further relief that the Court
deems appropriate.
