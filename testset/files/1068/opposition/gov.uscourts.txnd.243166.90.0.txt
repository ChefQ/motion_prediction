UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

v. No. 4:14-CR-023-A
CHRISTOPHER ROBERT WEAST (01)

GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PRODUCTION
OF GRAND JURY MINUTES

The United States of America, by and through the United States Attorney, files this
Response to Weast's Motion for Production of Grand Jury Minutes and would show the
Court as follows:

Weast requests the production, prior to trial, of transcripts of every witness who
testified before the grand jury in his case. The Government opposes Weast's motion.

A. Defendant has failed to demonstrate a particularized need for such evidence

This Court has discretion to disclose grand jury minutes. Posey v. United States,
416 F.2d 545, 557 (5th Cir. 1969). However, grand jury minutes should be made
available "only where, on the facts of a particular case, the interest of justice requires
disclosure." Jd. This requires a defendant to first make a "particularized showing of need"
before disclosure should be granted. Jd. (citing Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855
(1966) (additional citations omitted)); see also, United States v. Tucker, 526 F.2d 279, 282
(Sth Cir. 1976) ("A defendant must show `particularized need' to justify infringement of

the secrecy surrounding a grand jury") (internal citations omitted).

Here, Weast states only that he is "contemplating" that he will be able to show a
particularized need once he has received information to which he is not otherwise entitled.
(Def. Mot. Produc. Grand Jury Mins. 1, ECF No. 81.) Thus, Weast has failed to
demonstrate to this Court that the interest of justice requires disclosure of grand jury
minutes.

B. Disclosure of testimony pursuant to the Jencks Act

The Government told Weast that to the extent that Grand Jury testimony constituted
Jencks Act material, it would turn those statements over; otherwise, the Government
opposed his motion.

However, the Jencks Act does not require the Government to turn over statements
or reports in its possession that were made by a Government witness or prospective
Government witness until after that witness has testified on direct examination at trial.

18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3500. Also, only grand jury statements that relate to the subject matter of the
witness's trial testimony must be turned over. United States v. Ferreira, 625 F.2d 1030,
1034 (1st Cir. 1980). Thus, if a witness testifies at trial on matters unrelated to the grand
jury proceedings, the defendant is not entitled to production of grand jury testimony.

Although the Government may choose to disclose Jencks Act material prior to a
witness testifying, the Government objects to Weast asking the Court to order early, global

production of such material without first making a particularized showing of need.

Therefore, the Government respectfully submits that Weast's motion should be

denied.

Respectfully submitted,
