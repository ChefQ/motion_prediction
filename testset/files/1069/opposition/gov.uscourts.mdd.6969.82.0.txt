WARFIELD-ROHR CASKET COMPANY, INC.’S RESPONSE
TO EEOC’S MOTION TO CLARIFY ORDER OF JUDGMENT
Warfield-Rohr Casket Company, Inc. (“Warfield-Rohr”), by its attorneys submits this
response to the EEOC’s Motion to Clarify Order of Judgment and states as follows:
1.

The EEOC’s contention that Warfield-Rohr has been stalling payment of the

judgment entered in this case is simply wrong.
2.

On November 16, 2005, the EEOC sent the undersigned a letter requesting

payment of the judgment and interest. Exhibit 1.
3.

By email dated November 22, 2005, the undersigned advised that it had a check in

the total amount requested made payable to the EEOC ready to be picked up. Exhibit 2.
4.

The EEOC refused to accept the check. Exhibit 3.

5.

Warfield-Rohr is not aware of any case law or court rule prohibiting it from

satisfying the judgment by paying the EEOC or requiring that payment be made directly to
Mr. Kuehnl. Indeed, the check was made payable to the EEOC at the direction of WarfieldRohr’s accountant.

Nevertheless, as an accommodation to the EEOC, Warfield-Rohr issued new

checks made payable directly to Mr. Kuehnl in the gross amount requested by the EEOC. One
check covered the liquidated damages and interest portion of the award. The other check
covered the back pay portion of the award, with the appropriate withholdings deducted. On
December 7, 2005, the undersigned made the checks available to the EEOC and Mr. Kuehnl as
full satisfaction of the monetary aspects of the judgment. Exhibit 4.
7.

The EEOC refused to sign Exhibit 4, apparently because it does not want to waive

the costs it sought in this action.
8.

The EEOC sought costs after the entry of judgment, which Warfield-Rohr

opposed. The Court, in its final order of September 6, 2005, made no mention of the costs
requested by the EEOC.
9.

Regardless, Warfield-Rohr believed it reasonable that the EEOC should waive its

right to any potential recovery of costs in exchange for Warfield-Rohr paying Mr. Kuehnl
directly because the EEOC would be avoiding the time and expense of having to process the
settlement funds (and withhold taxes), as well as the time, expense, and uncertainties of
attempting to enforce and collect the judgment.1
10.

This case has been pending since 2001. Warfield-Rohr has offered to pay the

amount requested by the EEOC (which is in excess of $400,000) in the manner requested, i.e.,
directly to Mr. Kuehnl. All Warfield-Rohr is requesting is closure and a satisfaction of the
money judgment.
1

The EEOC also appears concerned about Warfield-Rohr paying it $546.00 in costs
awarded by the fourth circuit on September 27, 2005 for the prior appeal in this case.
Although Warfield-Rohr believes it would not be unreasonable for the EEOC to waive
this nominal amount in exchange for Warfield-Rohr voluntarily paying the judgment in
the manner requested by the EEOC, it agrees to pay this amount.
