Re:

Siancas et al. v. Exclusive Detailing Inc. et al.
Docket No.: 2:14-cv-6151

Dear Judge Locke:
This office represents defendants in the above referenced matter. As the Court is aware,
this matter is scheduled for a Settlement Conference before Your Honor on February 23, 2016 at
2:00 p.m. In furtherance of same, the parties are required to submit an ex parte settlement
position to the Court twenty-four (24) hours prior to the conference. We respectfully submit this
correspondence as notice to the Court that, in light of this lawsuit and the numerous other
lawsuits recently filed against the defendants, our client has been forced into seeking Bankruptcy
protection pursuant to 11 U.S. Code Chapter 7.
In good faith, our client diligently sought alternatives to filing for Bankruptcy, but their
present state of financial affairs renders them incapable of defending these lawsuits or meeting
their other outstanding financial obligations. The anticipated filing date is Monday, February 22,
2016. As such, it is respectfully submitted that an appearance at the Settlement Conference
scheduled for Monday, February 22, 2016 would be moot, pursuant to the Bankruptcy protection
afforded under 11 U.S.C. 362(a)(1). If the court requires, I can be available by phone if needed
for the above conference. Thank you for your consideration and courtesies.
Respectfully submitted,

Michael K. Chong
