GOVERNMENT=S OBJECTION TO DEFENDANT
CARAMADRE=S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO WAIVE JURY TRIAL
The United States of America, by and through its undersigned
attorneys, hereby objects to Defendant Joseph Caramadre=s Motion For
Leave To Waive Jury Trial.

Caramadre’s attempt to avoid a jury trial

in this case should be rejected because the harm he fears is entirely
speculative, the plain language of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
23 requires the government’s consent for a non-jury trial, and
neither the Supreme Court nor any appellate court has ever approved
a defendant’s waiver of a jury over the government’s objection.
BACKGROUND
Defendants Joseph Caramadre and Raymour Radhakrishnan are
charged in a sixty-six count indictment with conspiracy, wire fraud,
mail fraud, identity fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money

1

laundering.

Caramadre is also charged with one count of witness

tampering.
On August 2, 2012, co-defendant Radhakrishnan elected to
represent himself.

For months prior to Radhakrishnan’s decision to

proceed pro se, Caramadre’s defense team repeatedly indicated in
conversations with the government and in chambers conferences with
the Court that Caramadre would prefer a non-jury trial.

At every

instance, the government indicated it would object to a non-jury
trial.

After Radhakrishnan moved to proceed pro se, Caramadre filed

a Motion to Sever, citing prejudice he anticipates will result from
Radhakrishnan’s pro se performance.

In an Order and Memorandum

issued September 21, 2012, the Court denied Caramadre’s Motion to
Sever. 1

Caramadre now seeks a bifurcated, non-jury trial over the

government’s objection, based on the same speculative prejudice
Caramadre presumes will result from Radhakrishnan’s pro se
representation.

1

Although the Court’s written Order denying the Motion to Sever was issued
subsequent to the filing of Caramadre’s Motion For Leave To Waive Jury Trial, the
Court had previously advised the parties in chambers that it was likely to deny
the Motion to Sever. Moreover, in his Motion to Sever and in subsequent
correspondence with the Court, Caramadre repeatedly acknowledged that the
identified prejudice was speculative, and that severance was premature.

ARGUMENT
I.

The Government’s Consent is Required For a Non-Jury Trial.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23 states:
If the defendant is entitled to a jury trial,
the trial must be by jury unless:
(1) the defendant waives a jury trial in writing;
(2) the government consents; and
(3) the court approves.

F.R.C.P. 23(a).
Rule 23 was adopted in 1944 to codify the Supreme Court’s holding
in Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 312 (1930).

See United

States v. United States District Court for The Eastern District of
California, 464 F.3d 1065, 1069 (9th Cir. 2006).

In Patton, the

Supreme Court held that it was permissible for a criminal defendant
to consent to trial by a jury consisting of fewer than twelve people.
However, in so doing, the Court emphasized the pivotal role of trial
by jury in the criminal context, particularly where the defendant
is charged with a serious crime:

Not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a
constitutional jury be jealously preserved, but the maintenance
of the jury as a fact-finding body in criminal cases is of such
importance and has such a place in our traditions, that, before
any waiver can become effective, the consent of government
counsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition
to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant. And
the duty of the trial court in that regard is not to be discharged
as a mere matter of rote, but with sound and advised discretion,
3

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 1172

with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that
mode of trial or from any of the essential elements thereof,
and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt
with increase in gravity.

Patton, 281 U.S. at 312-313 (emphasis added).
The constitutionality of Rule 23 was challenged in Singer v.
United States, 380 U.S. 24 (1965). The defendant in Singer offered
in writing to waive trial by jury. The trial court was willing to
approve the waiver, but the government refused to consent. Id. at
25. The defendant was thus tried by jury and convicted, and his
conviction was affirmed on appeal.
Before the Supreme Court, the defendant argued that, pursuant
to the right to jury trial under Article III, section 2, of the
Constitution and the Sixth Amendment, a criminal defendant has a
“correlative right to have his case decided by a judge alone if he
considers such a trial to be to his advantage.” Id. at 25-26. The
Supreme Court squarely rejected this argument, holding that “there
is no federally recognized right to a criminal trial before a judge
sitting alone.” Id. at 34.
The Court then considered the argument that requiring the
defendant's waiver to be conditioned upon the consent of the
government and the trial judge violated the defendant's right to a
fair trial or due process. Id. at 35. The Court held that it did not:

4

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 1173

We find no constitutional impediment to conditioning a
waiver of this right on the consent of the prosecuting
attorney and the trial judge when, if either refuses to
consent, the result is simply that the defendant is subject
to an impartial trial by jury-the very thing that the
Constitution guarantees him. The Constitution recognizes
an adversary system as the proper method of determining
guilt, and the Government, as a litigant, has a legitimate
interest in seeing that cases in which it believes a
conviction is warranted are tried before the tribunal
which the Constitution regards as the most likely to
produce a fair result.

Id. at 36.
Further, the Court stated that Rule 23(a) does not require that
the government state its reason for refusing to consent to a
defendant's jury waiver, since the law will presume that such refusal
is not for an “ignoble purpose.” Id. at 37.
II.

The Singer Dicta Does Not Apply.

In conclusion, the Singer Court remarked:
We need not determine in this case whether there might be
some circumstances where a defendant's reasons for wanting
to be tried by a judge alone are so compelling that the
Government's insistence on trial by jury would result in
the denial to a defendant of an impartial trial. Petitioner
argues that there might arise situations where “passion,
prejudice ... public feeling” or some other factor may
render impossible or unlikely an impartial trial by jury.
However, since petitioner gave no reason for wanting to
forgo jury trial other than to save time, this is not such
a case, and petitioner does not claim that it is. Id. at
37-38. (emphasis added).

Seizing this dicta, Caramadre recycles his severance argument

5

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 1174

that Radhakrishnan’s pro se performance is likely to cause such
overwhelming prejudice that a fair trial is impossible.

However,

the Supreme Court has never determined whether the circumstances
alluded to in Singer have ever actually existed- i.e., where
requiring a defendant to undergo trial by jury would infringe his
constitutional right to a fair trial- nor has it ever decided what
circumstances would create such an unusual situation. To the
contrary, in at least one post-Singer opinion, the Court has
characterized the requirement of government consent as absolute.
See Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 383 (1979).
Contrary to Caramadre’s contention that “the law on the question
before the Court is sparse and aged” (Motion to Waive Jury Trial at
5), in fact the law is recent and overwhelmingly against him.

On

mandamus review in 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals collected
the cases and observed that:
Although lower courts have since assumed that Singer
allows for an exception to the requirement of governmental
consent to a jury waiver, no United States Court of Appeals
appears to have approved a defendant's waiver of a jury
over the government's objection. Indeed, the circuits that
have considered this issue have uniformly upheld the trial
courts' refusals to grant such waivers without
governmental consent. See United States v. Jackson, 278
F.3d 769, 771 (8th Cir.2002); DeLisle v. Rivers, 161 F.3d
370, 389 (6th Cir.1998); United States v. Van Metre, 150
F.3d 339, 353 (4th Cir.1998); United States v. Gabriel,
125 F.3d 89, 94-95 (2d Cir.1997), overruled on other
grounds by Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S.
696, (2005); United States v. Clark, 943 F.2d 775, 784 (7th
Cir.1991); United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 718 F.2d 1210,
6

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 1175

1217-1219 (2d Cir.1983). See also United States v. Clapps,
732 F.2d 1148 (3d Cir.1984), overruled on other grounds
by McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 360-61, 107
S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987).
United States v. United States District Court for the Eastern
District of California, 464 F.3d 1065, 1070-1071 (2006).
In Eastern District of California, the defendants were charged
with transporting minors in interstate commerce with the intent to
engage in illicit sexual activity.

Id. at 1066.

The trial was

expected to include evidence that the defendants had committed
approximately ten years of ritualistic sexual abuse of their own
minor children, including oral copulation, anal and vaginal
intercourse, and other acts the children were forced to commit.
at 1067.

Id.

The defense moved for a non-jury trial over the

government’s objection, citing the Singer dicta that “passion,
prejudice and public feeling” would render a fair and impartial jury
by trial impossible.

Id.

The 9th Circuit held that the District

Court’s decision to accept a waiver of jury trial over the
government’s objection was clearly erroneous as a matter of law and
issued a writ of mandamus. Id. at 1072.
The First Circuit, also on mandamus review, reversed and
remanded a District Court’s decision to grant a defendant’s motion
to bifurcate the possession element from the rest of the case in a
felon in possession case.

See United States v. Collamore, 868 F.2d
7

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 1176

24 (1st Cir. 1989)(abrogated on other grounds by United States v.
Tavares, 21 F.3d 1 (1994).

In Collamore, the First Circuit, quoting

Singer, held that “the government, as a litigant, has a legitimate
interest in seeing that cases in which it believes a conviction is
warranted are tried before the tribunal which the Constitution
regards as most likely to produce a fair result- the jury.”
28.

Id. at

The Court continued “If a Court believes there is insufficient

evidence to convict, it may grant a motion to acquit, Fed. R. Crim.
P. 29, or in the interest of justice, it may grant a new trial, Fed
R. Crim. P. 33.

It may not, however, otherwise tamper with the

government’s decision to have its case tried to a jury.”
Other Courts have reached the same result.

Id.

See e.g., United

States v. Van Metre, 150 F.3d 339, (4th Cir. 1998)(affirming denial
of motion for non-jury trial without government consent); United
States v. Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89 (2nd Cir. 1997), overruled on other
grounds by Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696 (2005),
(same); United States v. Martin, 7040F.2d 267 (6th Cir. 1983)(same);
United States v. Morlang, 531 F.2d 183 (4th Cir. 1975)(same).
Caramadre relies heavily on United States v. Panteleakis, 422
F.Supp. 247 (D.RI 1976).

In Panteleakis, which was not reviewed by

the Court of Appeals, the District Court allowed a non-jury trial
without the government’s consent.

Id. at 250.

In so doing however,

the Court noted that the case involved five defendants and “the trial
8

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 1177

will unquestionably involve intricate rulings on the admissibility
and inadmissibility of evidence as it relates to each particular
defendant.

This is not a conspiracy case and each defendant is

entitled to the full benefit of rulings on evidence relating to
hearsay, admissions, etc.”

Id. at 249 (emphasis added).

As this

Court recognized in its Order denying Caramadre’s Motion to Sever,
“joint trials are preferred in the federal system because they promote
efficiency and serve the interests of justice by avoiding the inequity
of inconsistent verdicts. 2

This is especially true in a conspiracy

case.” Order Denying Caramadre’s Motion to Sever at 3 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).

Moreover, although the government did not consent to a bench
trial in Panteleakis, it did not dispute any of the reasons identified
by the defendants in seeking a non-jury trial.

422 F.Supp. at 249.

“The government has not attempted to rebut the inference that
substantial prejudice is practically impossible to avoid.” Id. at
250.
By contrast, here the government unequivocally disputes the
speculative prejudice Caramadre identifies as flowing from
Radhakrishnan’s pro se representation.
purely speculative.

The presumed prejudice is

As the Court observed in denying Caramadre’s

2

It bears noting that having fact finders for each defendant in the same trial
could also lead to inconsistent verdicts.

9

Case 1:11-cr-00186-S-PAS Document 85 Filed 09/21/12 Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 1178

Motion to Sever, “To conclude that any mistake Radhakrishnan might make
in the future will prejudice Caramadre is pure speculation.
Speculation and assumption, based solely on hypotheticals and what-ifs,
are insufficient to sever a trial.”
Motion to Sever at 6.

Opinion and Order on Caramadre’s

For the same reasons that severance is

unwarranted, so too is it inappropriate to grant Caramadre a non-jury
trial over the government’s objection.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant Caramadre’s Motion For
Leave To Waive Jury Trial should be denied.
