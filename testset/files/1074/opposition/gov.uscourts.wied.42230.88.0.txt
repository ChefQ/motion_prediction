UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
v.

Case No. 06-CR-320

DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS
TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE AND FOR A NEW TRIAL

As he did in a motion filed before his trial, Olofson asks the Court to compel the
government to disclose a copy of “any and all correspondence from the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) to SGW/Olympic Arms or concerning SGW/Olympic Arms’
use of M-16 parts in the production of its AR-15 type weapons between 1980 and 1990,
particularly the use of M-16 triggers, hammers, disconnectors and selectors.” It now is
clear that Olofson is seeking disclosure of one specific letter from ATF to SGW.1

In his supporting memorandum, Olofson contends that he “previously requested disclosure
of the SGW letter from the government on September 25 and December 10, 2007. The government
refused to turn over the letter.” Def. Memo. at 1. Olofson makes it sound as though (1) he requested
a specific letter; (2) the United States Attorney’s Office had that letter; and (3) the United States
Attorney’s Office refused to provide the letter to Olofson. In fact, Olofson’s September and
December requests (as well as his initial motion to compel discovery) were much broader, and
included a litany of items that Olofson withdrew after conceding that they were not exculpatory.
Moreover, when the requests were made, the United States Attorney’s Office did not have in its
possession any correspondence between ATF and SGW.

I.

Before trial, the Court declined to compel disclosure of the information sought by
Olofson because it was not persuaded that the information was exculpatory; the
Court’s ruling was correct, and Olofson now is simply rearguing the same point
without any new information that impacts the Court’s original analysis.
The government’s position has all along been that the information sought by

Olofson is not subject to disclosure because it is not exculpatory. Tr. at 2, 3, 5. The Court
has agreed, declining to compel disclosure before trial because it was not persuaded that
the information was exculpatory.
In his motion, Olofson recounts that “[t]he Court had previously denied Olofson’s
motion for disclosure based upon the ATF’s representations that the SGW letter contained
privileged tax return information.” Def. Motion at 1. Again, the Court actually denied
Olofson’s because it found that the information that was sought was not exculpatory. The
Court explained that, “based upon what I’ve heard today as well as during our last hearing
and after reviewing your motion to compel discovery, I cannot conclude that the
information you’re requesting is, in fact, exculpatory. . . . [T]here is nothing that you’ve
said that suggests to me that the Government is required under Brady to provide you with
this information. Hence, your motion to compel is denied.” Tr. at 6.
Olofson has identified nothing new that suggests that the Court was wrong in
finding that the information was not exculpatory. The argument he makes now (“[T]he
SGW letter is discoverable because it directly contradicts the government’s theory during
the pendency of this case that because Olofson’s AR-15 contained the following M-16 parts,
it qualified as a machine gun: a M-16 trigger, hammer, disconnector and selector.”) is
virtually identical to the one that he made before trial (“So if the Government’s proof is
2

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 05/12/08 Page 2 of 7 Document 88

going to be that the presence of these internal M-16 parts are what constitutes or makes this
gun a machine gun, then I think the letter is . . . exculpatory and discoverable underneath
Brady.”).
The government has a duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to a defendant. Brady
v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). Exculpatory evidence is evidence that supports a claim
of innocence to the crime charged. United States v. Serfling, 504 F.3d 672, 678 (n.1) (7th Cir.
2007). Olofson has not articulated any basis for finding that the information he seeks is
favorable and material to his defense. Cf. United States v. Banks, 405 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.
2005). He simply asserts that the letter is discoverable “because it directly contradicts the
government’s theory . . . that because Olofson’s AR-15 contained [specific] M-16 parts, it
qualified as a machine gun. . . .” Def. Memo. at 2.
Olofson mischaracterizes the government’s position. The government has never
contended that any particular combination of parts was necessary or sufficient to satisfy
the statutory definition of a machinegun. From the beginning, the government’s position
has been that Olofson’s firearm was a machinegun not because of the presence or absence
of any particular component, but because it fired automatically more than one shot,
without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. See 28 U.S.C. § 5845(b). The
government articulated this position in the final pretrial report, R.66:4; in its opening
statement, Tr. 12; through its expert witness, Tr. 100; and in its closing argument, Tr. 188,
213.

Nonetheless, Olofson contends that the information he seeks is exculpatory because
it somehow contradicts the government’s theory of the case. It is impossible to tell from
his assertion why it is that Olofson believes the information is exculpatory. He never has
contended (nor could he maintain) that the ATF letter supercedes and supplants the
express statutory definition of “machinegun.” And to the extent that Olofson believes that
the letter shows that SGW manufactured his model of AR-15 with M-16 hammers, triggers,
disconnectors, and selectors, his lawyers certainly could have subpoenaed someone
affiliated with SGW to testify at trial as to the manufacture of those guns during the
relevant time period. It doesn’t appear that any such attempt was made.
Again, before trial the Court denied Olofson’s motion to compel because Olofson
had not satisfied the Court that the information he sought was exculpatory. Tr. 6. Olofson
has added no further articulation, and his most recent motion to compel should be denied.
II.

The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms maintains its position with respect
to the restrictions of 26 U.S.C. § 6103.
Olofson now portrays § 6103 as the basis upon which the government declined to

disclose the ATF letter and upon which the Court denied his earlier motion to compel. But
the government made clear that the § 6103 restriction was “secondary” to its central
position that the letter was not exculpatory. Tr. 5. Likewise, the Court based its decision
on Olofson’s failure to establish that the letter was exculpatory, and merely noted the
government’s position on the § 6103 issue. Tr. 6. Significantly, the Court also suggested
that, had it been satisfied that the letter may be exculpatory, it could have required an in
camera inspection of the letter. Tr. 6.

Case 2:06-cr-00320-CNC Filed 05/12/08 Page 4 of 7 Document 88

ATF maintains its position with respect to § 6103 restrictions on disclosing the letter.
Olofson suggests that the letter is not “return information” because it was “not filed by the
taxpayer.” Def. Memo. at 4. But § 6103(a) broadly prohibits the disclosure of “return
information,” which includes information “received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished
to, or collected by the Secretary . . . with respect to the determination of the existence, or
possible existence, of liability” under the Internal Revenue Code. 18 U.S.C. § 6103(b)(2)(A)
(emphasis added).
Olofson also attempts to remove the ATF letter from the compass of § 6103 by
asserting that it “issued from BATF in response to safety concerns about SGW/Olympic
Arms AR-15 rifles.” Def. Memo. at 4. He also acknowledges, however, that he has never
seen a copy of the letter; according to Olofson, the information that he has about the letter’s
content comes from the owner of SGW/ Olympic Arms. While it appears that the owner
of SGW has discussed the letter with Olofson, it does not appear that Olofson or his
attorneys have ever sought or obtained SGW’s consent to disclosure of return information.
If they had obtained such consent, SGW’s return information could be disclosed. 26 U.S.C.
§ 6103(c).
The government would disclose the ATF letter if after in camera inspection the Court
found that it was exculpatory or if SGW provided the appropriate consent. In the absence
of either of those two events, and because Olofson has not otherwise established that the
letter is exculpatory, the Court should deny his motion to compel.

III.

Olofson has not established that he is entitled to a new trial.
Olofson claims that he is entitled to a new trial because “[a]fter evaluation, it is clear

that the SGW letter undermines the jury’s verdict in this case and creates a miscarriage of
justice.” Def. Mot. at 2.
In order to establish that he is entitled to relief under Rule 33, Olofson would have
to “show that he became aware of the evidence only after the trial, that he could not have
discovered the evidence by due diligence any sooner, that the evidence is material and that
the evidence would probably lead to an acquittal in the event of a new trial.” United States
v. Brumley, 217 F.3d 905, 909 (7th Cir. 2000).
Olofson acknowledges that his motion for a new trial is conditioned upon his
motion to compel being granted. If the motion to compel is denied, then there is no basis
for granting a new trial. But even if the motion to compel is granted, the parties and the
Court should be afforded the opportunity to assess its impact on the Brumley factors before
addressing the merits of a motion for a new trial.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the government asks the Court to deny Olofson’s motions
