UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCON SIN

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
Case No. 06-CR-320

v.
DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE

D AVID R. O LOFSON, by counsel, submits the instant motion to compel
the disclosure of evidence. Olofson seeks to compel the government to disclose a
copy of any and all correspondence 1 from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF) to SGW /Olympic Arms or concerning SGW /Olympic Arms’ use
of M-16 parts in the production of its AR-15 type weapons between 1980 and 1990,
particularly the use of M-16 triggers, hammers, disconnectors and selectors. The
Court had previously denied Olofoson’s motion for disclosure based upon the ATF’s
representations that the SGW letter contained privileged tax return information.
1

For the purposes of simplicity and clarity, Olofson will refer to the
correspondence as the “SGW letter” from this point forward.

Olofson now seeks disclosure of the SGW letter because the BATF’s contention that
the SGW letter contains privileged return information is both incorrect in law and
contrary to internal BATF policy. Moreover, the SGW letter is exculpatory because
upon information and belief, it contains evidence that directly contradicts evidence
elicited by the government during trail that was central to its theory of guilt. See
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). In support of this motion, Olofson submits an
accompanying memorandum of law.
W HEREFORE , David R. Olofson, by counsel, respectfully requests that
the Court order the defendant to disclose any and all correspondence from the BATF
to SGW /Olympic Arms or concerning SGW/Olympic Arms’ use of M-16 parts in
the production of its AR-15 type weapons between 1980 and 1990, particularly the
use of M-16 triggers, hamm ers, disconnectors and selectors as soon as practicable.
Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, May 1, 2008.
