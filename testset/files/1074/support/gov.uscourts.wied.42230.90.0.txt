UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
Case No. 06-CR-320

v.
DAVID R. OLOFSON,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE

D AVID R. O LOFSON, by counsel, submits this reply in support of his
motion for disclosure of evidence and motion for a new trial.
I.

Olofson Requests Any And All Correspondence.
Olofson’s instant motion to compel seeks any correspondence between

the BATF and Schuetzen Gun Works (“SGW”) or Olympic Arms concerning
SGW/Olympic Arms’ use of M-16 parts in the production of its AR-15 type weapons
between 1980 and 1990, particularly the use of M-16 triggers, hammers,
disconnectors and selectors. As stated in the motion to compel, the use of the phrase
“SGW letter” for simplicity’s sake and was not intended to limit Olofson’s request.
See Defendant’s Motion to Compel at 1, FN1.

II.

The Evidence Requested is Exculpatory.
It should be reiterated that Olofson has never seen any correspondence

from the BATF to SGW/Olympic Arms concerning the latter’s use of M-16 parts in
the production of AR-15 rifles.

However, it is Olofson’s belief that the

correspondence indicates that SGW/Olympic Arms AR-15 rifles were manufactured
with internal parts, specifically M-16

triggers, hammers, disconnectors and

selectors. Olofson also believes that the correspondence also indicates that the use
of these internal M-16 parts creates a safety hazzard and asks that SGW/Olympic
Arms issue a recall for the AR-15 rifles manufactured with the M-16 parts.
The above information is exculpatory for a number of reasons. First,
the evidence contradicts the testimony at BATF Officer Kingery who testified that
SGW/Olympic Arms did not manufacture AR-15 rifles with all four M-16 parts.
Additionally, the correspondence contradicts the government’s theory that it was
the combination of the four M-16 parts that cause Olofson’s AR-15 to fire multiple
rounds with a single pull of a trigger. In the government’s response, it argues that
“Olofson’s firearm was a machine gun not because of the presence or absence of any
particular component, but because it fired automatically more than one shot,
without reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” Government’s brief at 3. But
this statement is belied by the government’s introduction of its Exhibit 9, the AR-15
to M-16 Conversion Book.

The government used this book in its attempt to

demonstrate that a AR-15 can be converted into an M-16 by the substitution of
certain M-16 parts – the very parts found in Olofson’s AR-15.
III.

Additional Evidence.
Undersigned counsel has now come into possession of a copy of

another item that was requested in discovery: ATF “Open Letter,” Federal Firearms
Licensee News Publication, issued in the fall of 1986. An excerpt from this Open
Letter is attached hereto.
The letter addresses owners of various AR-15 rifles that have been
assembled with internal M-16 parts.1 The letter notes that “the vast majority of these
rifles have been assembled with an M-16 bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector
and selector....” The letter notes that SGW is one of the companies that assembles
its rifles with these M-16 parts. Moreover, the letter cautions: “Additionally, these
rifles could pose a safety hazard in that they fire automatically without the user
being aware that the weapon will fire more than one shot with a single pull of the
trigger.”

The letter then instructs that “[a]ny AR15-type rifles which have been

assembled with M16 internal components should have those parts removed and
replaced....”

1

The letter cautions that these rifles, if they fire automatically, could be considered machine
guns under 26 U.S.C. § 5845. However, this letter predates the United States Supreme Court’s
decision in Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600 (1994), which requires that knowledge that the rifle
will fire automatically.

This open letter buttresses the correspondence requested by this motion
in that it also contradicts Officer Kingery’s testimony that SGW/Olympic Arms’ AR15 rifles were not manufactured with M-16 bolt carriers, hammers, triggers,
disconnectors and selectors. Moreover, the open letter demonstrates that according
to the ATF the preferred course of action is to replace the M-16 parts with the proper
AR-15 parts, which is what should have taken place in this instance.
IV.

26 U.S.C. § 6103.
Undersigned counsel is attempting to contact SGW/Olympic Arms

owner Bob Schuetzen to see if he will sign a consent for the release of the
information. However, at the time of the filing of this reply, Mr. Schuetzen has not
been reached. In the event that Mr. Schuetzen cannot be contacted prior to the May
13, 2008, sentencing hearing, Olofson would request that the Court review the
correspondence in camera to determine whether it contain exculpatory information
that should be disclosed under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).
V.

Conclusion.
For the foregoing reasons, Olofson respectfully requests that the court

grant his motion to compel the disclosure of any correspondence between the BATF
and Schuetzen Gun Works (“SGW”) or Olympic Arms concerning SGW/Olympic
Arms’ use of M-16 parts in the production of its AR-15 type weapons between 1980
