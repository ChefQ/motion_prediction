INTRODUCTION.

23

Plaintiff Katrina Perkins Steinberger hereby files her Response to Third-Party

24

Defendant [sic] Deutsche Bank as Trustee’s Motion for Adverse Inference Regarding

25

Authenticity of Loan Documents (the “Motion”). The Motion should be denied. Solomon

26

Krotzer, counsel for Deutsche Bank as Trustee, prevented Plaintiff and her Counsel from

27

viewing the purported original loan documents in person, by insisting that his secretary

28

2

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 93 Filed 10/29/15 Page 3 of 10

1

film the attorney-client document review on her iPhone. Attorney Krotzer insisted on the

2

filming, claiming that it would protect his firm should Undersigned Counsel or perhaps

3
4
5

even his own secretary, decide to “scribble” all over the purported originals.

37(b)(2)(A), Fed.R.Civ.P., does not support the assessment of any sanction under these
circumstances.
II.

Rule

FACTUAL BACKGROUND.

On August 17, 2015, the parties agreed that Undersigned Counsel and Plaintiff

8

would come to Houser and Allison to look at the purported original documents on August

9

21, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. The request to review the documents was made with the proviso that

10

doing so was an informal process and that neither Counsel nor Ms. Steinberger had the

11

expertise to opine on the authenticity/original nature of the documents. See Declaration of

12

Barbara J. Forde (“Forde Declaration”), attached hereto as Exhibit 1, and Exhibit A thereto

13

(the e-mail string between counsel dated August 17, 2015).

14
15
16
17
18

On the day the document review was to take place, August 21, 2015, with less than
5 hours’ notice, Attorney Krotzer e-mailed Plaintiff’s Attorney to confirm the review, and
to notify Attorney Forde:
Please be advised my assistant, Paige, will be videotaping the inspection with
her iPhone. We do not mean to be intrusive, but we think it is important in
case there is a dispute later about markings on the original documents.

19
20

See Forde Declaration ¶ 4, and Exhibit B thereto (the e-mail string between counsel dated

21

August 21, 2015).

22

Attorney Forde responded that in fact such filming was an intrusion on the attorney-

23

client relationship and attorney-client communications, and would otherwise hinder the

24

document review. Attorney Forde proposed that she and her client would agree not to

25

touch the documents at all, and that Paige could lay them out on the table for review. See

26
27
28

Forde Declaration ¶¶ 5, 7, and Exhibit B thereto.
Attorney Krotzer refused the proposal, and insisted that his secretary film Counsel
and her client reviewing the documents, on her iPhone, with the following justification:

Here is an illustration to explain why we need to videotape (hypothetical).
Paige sees you start scribbling on the Note. It is then a “he said/she said”
situation where you would deny ever scribbling on the note. Or, what if you
don’t scribble on the note, and Paige says she saw you scribble on the note?
It is then a “he said/she said” in the other direction.
See Forde Declaration ¶ 6, and Exhibit B thereto. Undersigned Counsel reiterated her
promise as an officer of the court that she would not touch the documents. She pointed
out that Attorney Krotzer had other ways of memorializing the condition of the documents
prior to the review. See Forde Declaration ¶ 7, 8, and Exhibit B thereto.

9

Since Attorney Krotzer refused to drop his demand that this attorney-client meeting

10

be filmed, Attorney Forde cancelled the document review. See Forde Declaration ¶ 9, and

11

Exhibit B thereto.

12

Plaintiff has proceeded with her intent to have the purported original loan

13

documents examined by a person with expertise in the questioned document area, William

14

Flynn, B.S., D-ABFDE of Affiliated Forensic Laboratory, Inc. Undersigned Counsel

15
16
17
18
19

requested a day and time from Attorney Krotzer when Mr. Flynn can examine the
purported original documents in Mr. Flynn’s offices where his specialized equipment is
located. Attorney Krotzer is requiring that the document examination be videotaped. Mr.
Flynn objects to being filmed while he works. This discovery dispute is currently pending
before the Court in the Joint Statement of the Issues Regarding Discovery Dispute filed
with the Court on October 26, 2015 (Doc. 91).

III.

LEGAL ANALYSIS.

22
23

A.

The Failure to Review the Loan Documents at Houser & Allison Was
Substantially Justified and Harmless.

24
25

In filing the Motion, Attorney Krotzer and Deutsche Bank as Trustee show a lack of

26

candor toward the tribunal. Attorney Krotzer’s Declaration is disingenuous for failing to

27

tell the Court that Plaintiff and her Counsel set an appointment to review the documents,

28

4

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 93 Filed 10/29/15 Page 5 of 10

1

but the improper and invasive conditions placed on that review by Attorney Krotzer forced

2

Plaintiff to cancel the review. Compare Krotzer Declaration Doc. 83-1 ¶¶ 5, 7,1 with

3
4
5
6
7

Forde Declaration Exhibit 1 hereto ¶¶ 4-9. Just five hours before the document review was
set to occur, Attorney Krotzer revealed that he would insist on filming the Plaintiff and her
attorney’s document review at Houser & Allison. Access to the documents was barred
without being filmed by Attorney Krotzer’s assistant on her iPhone. Attorney

Krotzer’s

only justification for requiring filming of this attorney-client privileged review of the
documents was his belief that Attorney Forde was going to “scribble” all over the Note, or

8

that his own assistant Paige would falsely state that Attorney Forde scribbled on the Note

9

even though Attorney Forde had not done so. See Forde Declaration ¶ 6; Exhibit B

10

thereto.

11

privileged review which would contain attorney-client privileged communications, and

12

avowed as an officer of the court that she and Plaintiff would not touch the documents.

13

Attorney Krotzer insisted the review be filmed.
Incredibly, in the face of these facts, the Defendant claims to not know why

14
15
16
17
18
19

Attorney Forde objected to the Defendants’ filming of this attorney-client

Plaintiff has not reviewed the documents: “Presumably, the reason Plaintiffs have not
inspected the original loan documents is because they benefit from their ignorance.” See
Doc. 83 at 4:23-25.
Attorney Forde was substantially justified in cancelling the review. Indeed, the case
law, none of which Attorney Krotzer cited in his Motion, demonstrates that the Motion
should be denied.

20

Rule 37(b)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P. should not be applied “when it has been established

21

that failure to comply (with court discovery orders) has been due to inability, and not to

22

willfulness, bad faith, or any fault of (the disobedient party)….” U.S. v. Sumitomo Marine

23

& Fire Ins. Co., Ltd., 617 F.2d 1365, 1369 (9th Cir. 1980). When the disobedience is due

24

to circumstances beyond that party’s control, preclusion of evidence should not be

25
26
27
28

1

The Krotzer Declaration must be disregarded on this Motion, because it does not comply
with 28 U.S.C. § 1746, which specifically requires the Declaration to state, “I declare (or
certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
Executed on (date). (Signature).” The Krotzer Declaration does not contain this required
language.
5

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 93 Filed 10/29/15 Page 6 of 10

imposed. Id. In the context of a failure to disclose, the Ninth Circuit has held that the

2

“exclusion of evidence under Rule 37(c)(1) is not appropriate if the failure to disclose was

3
4
5
6
7

either substantially justified or harmless.” Luke v. Family Care and Urgent Medical
Clinics, 323 Fed.Appx. 496, 499 (9th Cir. 2009)(quoting Yeti by Molly Ltd. v. Deckers
Outdoor Corp., 259 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2001)).
The Second Circuit,2 in analyzing Rule 37, discussed the constitutional implications
of barring evidence when the failure to obey an order is due to circumstances beyond a
party’s control:

8

Where the party makes good faith efforts to comply, and is thwarted by
circumstances beyond his control for example, a foreign criminal statute
prohibiting disclosure of the documents at issue[,] an order dismissing the
complaint would deprive the party of a property interest without due process
of law. It would, after all, be unfair and irrational to prevent a party from
being heard solely because of a nonculpable failure to meet the terms of a
discovery order. Indeed, such measures would be gratuitous, for if the party
is unable to obey there can be no effective deterrence, general or specific.

Cine Forty-Second St. Theatre Corp. v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp., 602 F.2d 1062, 1066

16

(2d Cir. 1979).

17

Thus, under Ninth Circuit law, no sanctions should be assessed here. Defendant

18

and its Attorney thwarted Plaintiff’s attempt to review the documents in spite of reasonable

19
20
21
22

offers by Plaintiff’s Counsel to address the Defendant’s concerns. Barring the Plaintiff
from presenting evidence on the issue of authenticity of the documents will deprive Ms.
Steinberger of a property interest without due process of law. Such a sanction would be no
deterrent, because Plaintiff was prevented from reviewing the documents by the very party
now seeking to have her punished for failing to do so.

23

Another reason supports denial of the Motion. The Ninth Circuit has held that

24

sanctions should not be assessed under Rule 37 without adequate warning to the

25

disobedient party about the consequences for non-compliance. Halaco Engineering Co. v.

26

Costle, 843 F.2d 376, 379-80 (9th Cir. 1988)(judge’s prior statements did not notify the

27

This Second Circuit case was cited with approval in Sumitomo, 617 F.2d at 1369.

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 93 Filed 10/29/15 Page 7 of 10

1

party of the Rule 37 consequences of failing to comply; therefore it did not constitute an

2

order for the purposes of Rule 37). Here, in a Text-Only Minute Entry on ECF, the Court

3
4
5
6
7

used the word “order” in stating that Plaintiff should “within a reasonable period of time,
inspect the original documents in person.” See Doc. 65. No signed Order was issued, and
no consequences attached to a failure to review the documents. The Court stated that the
purpose of the review was a hope to narrow the issues. And the only timeframe was “a
reasonable time.”
Only 10 days later, Plaintiff’s Counsel set up a time to comply, but had to cancel

8

based on Attorney Krotzer’s unwarranted conditions for that review. Further, such a

9

review by Plaintiff’s Counsel will not narrow the issues; she is not qualified to opine on

10

whether the documents are authentic originals or not. The failure to review the documents

11

is therefore harmless. This is precisely why Plaintiff seeks to have William Flynn examine

12

the documents—to address the issue of authenticity by someone with the training and the

13

equipment to opine on the subject.

14
15
16
17
18

The Motion should be denied.
B.

The Adverse Inference Rule Has No Application Here.

Deutsche Bank as Trustee seeks a ruling from this Court that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s
failure to go look at the documents at Houser & Allison should result in a sanction of

19

prohibiting “Plaintiffs from disputing the authenticity of the loan documents.” See Doc. 83

20

at 4:15-17. Deutsche Bank as Trustee fails to claim any prejudice from Counsel’s not

21

seeing the purported originals, nor can Deutsche Bank as Trustee credibly argue that a

22

review of those documents by Plaintiff’s Counsel would somehow result in a confession

23

by Plaintiff that the documents are authentic.

24

clear throughout this proceeding that neither she nor her client is competent to determine

25
26
27
28

Indeed, Undersigned Counsel has made it

whether the purported originals are the true originals, and it goes without saying that
Attorney Forde cannot be a witness in these proceedings.
Deutsche Bank as Trustee fails to tell this Court or Plaintiff, what “loan documents”
Defendant wants to have ruled, authenticated. The sheer volume of documents attached to
7

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 93 Filed 10/29/15 Page 8 of 10

1

the Motion makes that determination impossible, and demonstrates bad faith.3 Apparently

2

Deutsche Bank as Trustee believes that every document it wants to use at trial, or at least

3
4
5

521 pages of documents, should be authenticated by this Court based on Attorney
Krotzer’s thwarting of Plaintiff’s good faith attempt to go see the purported original loan
documents. But the law does not allow this:

6

The district court’s authority to issue the sanctions [under Rule 37(b)] is
subject to certain limitations: (1) the sanction must be just; and (2) the
sanction must specifically relate to the particular claim at issue in the order.

7
8
9

U.S. v. National Medical Enter., Inc., 792 F.2d 906, 910 (9th Cir. 1986). Plaintiff was not

10

going to Houser & Allison to review 521 pages of documents; she was going there to

11

review the purported original loan documents which would be in a hard copy collateral file

12

of some sort. If any adverse inference were to be issued, it would only be as to those

13

documents the Plaintiff was to review; presumably the Note and Deed of Trust.
Regardless, no adverse inference should be made here. A court may permit a jury

14
15
16
17
18

to draw an adverse inference related to evidence, if a party fails to produce that relevant
evidence within its control. Liss v. Exel Transp. Services, Inc., 2008 WL 370886 at *5
(D.Ariz. Feb. 11, 2008).

A court can also prohibit the disobedient party from opposing

designated claims or defenses or from introducing designated matters in evidence. Id.
“The rule permitting a jury to draw an adverse inference is based on two

19

rationales.”

20

proposition that a party who destroys a relevant document is more likely to have been

21

threatened by the document that someone who does not destroy it. Id. The other is the

22

“deterrence rationale” which presumes that the adverse inference will deter parties from

23

destroying evidence. Id.

Id.

One is the “evidentiary rationale” recognizing the common sense

24

Here, of course, Plaintiff has destroyed nothing and has failed to produce nothing.

25

Her failure to review the documents at Houser & Allison was based on improper and

26

As an example, Doc 83-5 contains underwriting documents, credit reports and financial
information from loan initiation; these cannot be said in good faith to be “loan
documents.”

28

8

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 93 Filed 10/29/15 Page 9 of 10

1

invasive conditions placed on that document review. Neither rationale behind the adverse

2

inference doctrine would be served by using it against Plaintiff.
Further, Plaintiff’s Counsel’s failure to look at the documents would not bring the

3
4
5
6
7

case closer to resolution. Not seeing the documents does not allow Plaintiffs, as Defendant
“presumes,” to “benefit from their ignorance.” See Doc. 83 at 4:23-25.

An unfounded

presumption by Deutsche Bank as Trustee hardly requires an adverse inference against
Plaintiff. Plaintiff is in the process of having William Flynn examine the documents; no
prejudice has been suffered by Defendant. No adverse inference is warranted.

8

Defendant next argues, wholly without foundation, that “there is no reason to

9

dispute the authenticity of [the 521 pages attached to the Motion].” See Doc. 83 at 5:6.4

10

Attorney Krotzer goes so far as to assume the role of a handwriting expert and opine that

11

Mr. Perkins’ signature on his Last Will and Testament is the same as that on the loan

12

documents. See Doc. 83 at 5:6-8. Attorney Krotzer cannot be attorney, expert witness and

13

jury in this matter; he must choose a role. At present, he is Counsel for the Defendant,

14

only.
The Motion has no merit, and Plaintiff respectfully requests that it be denied.

15
16

IV.

17
18

CONCLUSION.

Plaintiff’s failure to go to Houser & Allison to view the purported original loan
documents was through no fault of her own. An appointment for the review was made, but

then cancelled by Plaintiff’s Counsel due to improper and invasive conditions placed upon

20

In an astonishing misrepresentation of Plaintiff’s claims, Deutsche Bank as Trustee
accuses Plaintiff of making a “show-me-the-note” argument (Doc. 83 at 3, 4), even though
the Arizona Court of Appeals in this very case, ruled that Steinberger did not. Steinberger
v. McVey ex rel. County of Maricopa, 234 Ariz. 125, 141 ¶ 70, 318 P.3d 419, 435 ¶ 70 (Ct.
