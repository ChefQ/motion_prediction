Pursuant to FRCP 37(b)(2)(A)(ii), Third-Party Defendant, Deutsche Bank

2

National Trust Company As Trustee For Indymac Indx Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-

3

AR14, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2005-AR14 (“Deutsche Bank as

4

Trustee”) hereby moves for an adverse inference order in light of Plaintiffs’ failure to

5

obey this Court’s order. Specifically, for disobeying the following order issued on

6

August 7, 2015: “The Court orders that plaintiff’s counsel, within a reasonable period of

7

time, inspect the original documents in person.” (Doc. 65). To date, Plaintiff’s attorney

8

has not inspected the loan documents in person. Therefore, an appropriate sanction

9

would be to prevent Plaintiff from disputing the authenticity of the loan documents in

10

these proceedings, thereby narrowing the scope of this litigation.

11

I.

Factual and Procedural History

12

This case was filed by Plaintiffs on the eve of a scheduled trustee’s sale. Without

13

any good-faith basis, Plaintiffs continue to dispute the authenticity of the original loan

14

documents which are currently held in a safe at undersigned counsel’s office at: 2929 N.

15

Central Avenue, Suite 1560, Phoenix, AZ 85012.

16

Amended Complaint, at Paragraph 146, “Plaintiff alleges that the whereabouts of the

17

Note are unknown.” (See ¶ 146, Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 1, page 30 of 58).

18

Plaintiffs also allege that “No Defendant is the Note Holder/Lender because no entity

19

took the Note by transfer and is entitled to payment, while also being the true

20

beneficiary of the DOT.” (See ¶ 150, Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 1, page 31 of

21

58).

22

Note/debt from the DOT; the DOT secures nothing.” (See ¶ 194, Second Amended

23

Complaint, Doc. 1, page 38 of 58).

For example, in their Second

Finally, Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants having voluntarily separated the

24

In short, Plaintiffs are making “show me the note” types of arguments in order to

25

avoid paying what is owed on the subject loan. However, Deutsche Bank as Trustee has

26

tried to “show” Plaintiffs the original note and corresponding loan documents since this

27

case was removed. The custodial history of the original loan documents was set forth in

28

Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand (Doc. 33).

Specifically,

Case 2:15-cv-00450-ROS Document 83 Filed 10/12/15 Page 4 of 6

1

Deutsche Bank as Trustee received the original loan documents on or about June 2,

2

2005. (See ¶ 4 of the Declaration of Barbara Campbell, attached as Exhibit A to

3

Response to Motion to Remand (Doc. 33)).

4

undersigned counsel’s office and received and signed for on February 6, 2015. (See

5

Exhibit B to Response to Motion to Remand (Doc. 33)). At the time the judicial

6

foreclosure was filed on March 23, 2015 (Doc. 14), Deutsche Bank as Trustee was in

7

possession of the original “wet-ink” note, endorsed in blank, through counsel. The loan

8

documents are currently held at a safe at undersigned counsel’s office. (See Declaration

9

of Solomon Krotzer, attached as Exhibit A).

The loan documents were sent to

10

Given the above, at a status conference on August 7, 2015, this Court ordered that

11

Plaintiffs inspect the original loan documents “in person,” in order to narrow the scope

12

of this litigation. (Doc. 65). As expected, Plaintiffs have not inspected the original loan

13

documents and over two months have passed since this Court’s order.

14

II.

15

Given Plaintiffs’ overt violation of this Court’s order, an appropriate sanction

16

would be to prohibit Plaintiffs from disputing the authenticity of the loan documents.

17

Specifically, FRCP 37(b)(2)(A)(ii) states:

18

Adverse Inference is Appropriate Pursuant to FRCP 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)

(A)

For Not Obeying a Discovery Order. If a party … fails to obey an order

19

… the court … may issue further just orders.

They may include the

20

following: … (ii) Prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or

21

opposing designated claims or defenses ….”

22

This sanction would be appropriate because it would not have taken much time or

23

effort for opposing counsel to inspect the original loan documents. Presumably, the

24

reason Plaintiffs have not inspected the original loan documents is because they benefit

25

from their ignorance. For example, as long as Plaintiffs have not actually inspected the

26

original loan documents, they can continue to make their “show me the note” arguments

27

in these proceedings and dispute the authenticity of the documents. In short, Plaintiffs

28

ignored and disregarded this Court’s order for their own benefit.

2

Scanned copies of the “original collateral file,” containing the original “wet-ink”
Note, Deed of Trust, and other documents is attached as Exhibit B.

3

Scanned copies of the origination file, with original “wet-ink” copies of the loan

4

application and related documents signed by Mr. Perkins at closing, is attached as

5

Exhibit C1 through C5.

6

Clearly, there is no reason to dispute the authenticity of these documents. The

7

signature of Charles Perkins is uniform throughout. The signature matches the will of

8

Mr. Perkins, filed in the probate matter, which is attached as Exhibit D.

9

III.

CONCLUSION

10

Therefore, Deutsche Bank as Trustee moves for an adverse inference order,

11

conclusively presuming for purposes of these proceedings, that the documents attached

12

as Exhibit B and Exhibit C1 through C5 are the original “wet ink” documents signed

13

by Mr. Perkins, that Deutsche Bank as Trustee has been in possession of the original

14

“wet-ink” Adjustable Rate Note since June 2, 2005, and prohibiting Plaintiffs from

15

making contrary claims or defenses, including disputing the authenticity of these

16

documents, in these proceedings.
