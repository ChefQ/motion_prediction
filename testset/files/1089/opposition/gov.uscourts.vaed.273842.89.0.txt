JOINT MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO

Plaintiffs Gregory Thomas Berry, Summer Darbonne, Rickey Millen, Shamoon Saeed,
Arthur B. Hernandez, Erika A. Godfrey and Timothy Otten, individually and on behalf of all
others similarly situated, (“Plaintiffs”), and Defendants Reed Elsevier Inc., LexisNexis Risk
Solutions FL Inc., and LexisNexis Risk Data Management, Inc. (“Defendants”) (collectively,
“the Parties”) respectfully submit this memorandum of law in response to Watts Guerra LLP’s
Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's October 23, 2013, Order requiring the law Firm of
Watts Guerra, LLP (“Watts Guerra”) and attorney Ryan Thompson (“Thompson”) to cease use
of certain advertisements and communications (Doc. 85). The Parties brought the Motion to
Correct Misrepresentations of the Watts Guerra, L.L.P. Group to protect Class Members from
Watts Guerra's misleading and false advertising and to prevent Watts Guerra from undermining
the Court-supervised Notice program. For the following reasons, the Court properly entered that
Order and should deny Watts Guerra's Motion for Reconsideration.

I.

OVERVIEW
Despite the substantial activity and filings with regard to and from the Aaron group,

neither Mr. Anthony nor Mr. Bennett (or any of their counterparts) has ever been successful in
obtaining an e-mail or telephonic response or communication from Mr. Thompson or Watts
Guerra. Attempts to meet and confer or discuss the Watts Guerra counter-notice have been
rebuffed. The present motion and matter should have been resolvable between counsel. Still, the
Parties recognize, by their Virginia counsel, their obligation to attempt a solution that avoids
further judicial burden, but yet provides a fair means to determine the propriety and truthfulness
of the Watts Guerra counter-notice campaign. Accordingly, The Parties propose that the Court
resolve this dispute by (a.) Ordering Watts Guerra to meet and confer directly with the
Parties’ Virginia counsel to determine if there is a negotiable solution to the pending
dispute. As necessary, such conference could be supervised by United States Magistrate Judge
Novak; and (b.) Referring this matter to a Special Master. Retired United States District
Court Judge Friedman, and Retired United States Magistrate Judges Stillman and Poretz1 are all
immediately available. The Parties would agree to pay the expense absent a separate motion for
sanctions or other remedy sought by independent motion. The Special Master would be tasked
with determining the accuracy and ethical permissibility of the Watts Guerra counter-notice
campaign. Further, the Special Master could and likely would refer the Watts Guerra advertising
to the Virginia State Bar for pre-review by the ethics staff attorneys.2 This would be done

1

Counsel understand that Judge Dohnal (Ret.) will be unavailable.

Both the Parties and now Watts Guerra have raised the issue of compliance with Virginia legal ethics. This is
dangerous territory for any of the attorneys in the case to litigate with uncertainty. However, as the Court is likely
aware, the Virginia State Bar ethics staff will perform a review of proposed attorney advertising for ethical
permissibility http://www.vsb.org/site/regulation/advertising-and-solicitation/#request.

2

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 3 of 32 PageID# 2082

without risk or expense to Watts Guerra and could start immediately. Such solution alleviates
Watts Guerra’s concern that it would have to seek consent or review by the Parties’ counsel.
Watts Guerra opposes the proposed Class Settlement in this case. If it actually represents
any class members who intend to object, it has a right to do so. And Watts Guerra has an
unrestricted right to communicate with those clients who have retained the firm. These issues
are not before the Court and are not impacted by the present dispute. Further, Watts Guerra’s
urgency is also based upon a false premise – that the communications at issue are directed to
influence class members to decide whether or not to approve the settlement. In fact, the
deadline to object and opt out has long passed. Instead, Watts Guerra wants to continue its
challenged communications in order to sign up more claimants who it can use to press
LexisNexis for more money outside of the settlement in this case (either for actual damages or
some other remedy if the settlement is rejected and the case dismissed). Regardless of the
propriety of these objectives, the relevant point is that there is no immediate need to permit an
unfettered Watt’s Guerra marketing campaign. There is no irreparable harm faced by Watts
Guerra by the very minimal delay in permitting the Virginia State Bar or Special Master review
of the counter-notice campaign.
In contrast, if the Settlement is approved, the Watts Guerra communications do pose a
real harm or danger to class members. The Settlement presents real and substantial benefits to
class members who take advantage of the consideration. They may obtain their free full file
consumer report and inquiries for users of that file. Class members will now be able to dispute
inaccurate information in the FCRA file, and that information will be restricted to those with a
FCRA purpose. Disputes may be noted even for the information that all concede may not be
FCRA governed. But if class members were told instead that the Berry Settlement provided

3

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 4 of 32 PageID# 2083

nothing, Watts Guerra’s marketing would serve the improper purpose of impairing class member
participation in such benefits.
Accordingly, examination of the details of the Watts Guerra counter-notice, which the
Parties contend is unquestionably untruthful and misleading, can await the still-expedited review
as proposed herein. The present motion has nothing to do with the Court’s pending
consideration of the fairness and Adequacy of this settlement.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs sued Defendants on November 14, 2011, alleging that Defendants sold

Accurint® Identity Reports in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et
seq. (“FCRA”). After extensive litigation, on March 15, 2013, the Parties reached a Proposed
Settlement Agreement (“the Settlement Agreement”) (Doc. 63, Ex. 1). Under the Settlement
Agreement, the Court will certify two classes for settlement purposes only. One class, certified
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), will receive monetary compensation, and another, certified under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), will receive substantial injunctive relief. The Court granted preliminary
approval of the settlement on April 29, 2013, appointing Class Counsel to represent both the
Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) classes. The Court also set a deadline by which class members
could object to the settlement of August 30, 2013. Publication notice was provided to the Rule
23(b)(2) class commencing in June 2013. On August 30, 2013, Watts Guerra filed objections to
settlement, purportedly on behalf of over 20,000 named individuals.
It is not clear just when Watts Guerra began the misleading advertising campaign that
was the subject of this Court’s order. Thompson registered the website –
http://www.BringaClaim.com (“the Website”) – in June 2012, and used it until at least midAugust, 2013 to make misleading solicitations in another case, the national mortgage
4

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 5 of 32 PageID# 2084

settlement. 3 Sometime thereafter, the website content was changed to solicit consumers to hire
Watts Guerra to provide services with respect to the claims embraced by the Berry Settlement
Agreement. Since no "claims" are either permitted or required to obtain benefits in this case, use
of “bringaclaim.com” for this purpose was inherently misleading. Watts Guerra recorded one or
more videos targeted at the Rule 23(b)(2) class members for whom the Court has already
appointed Class Counsel. The videos did not contain the cautionary language required by
various state bars for attorney advertising, did not advise Class Members that the Court had
already appointed Class Counsel to represent them, and were in other ways misleading. The
Website provided false and misleading information and failed to provide important class
information. Watts Guerra designed the Website to encourage viewers to sign quickly a retainer
agreement with its firm without fully considering all information necessary to make an informed
decision. Watts Guerra used the website, which contained a form retainer agreement, to solicit
clients.
After the August 30 objection deadline passed, Watts Guerra began to run advertisements
on television on such channels as Fox News, BET, and the Game Show Network and left the
website operative.

Watts Guerra’s post-August 30 advertising continued to suggest to viewers

that if the viewer signed up with Watts Guerra after the objection deadline, there was some legal
service that Watts Guerra could offer them in connection with this litigation.
3

The West Virginia Attorney General sued Thompson’s prior law firm, Murray LLP, in 2012, alleging that the firm
sought to charge consumers a fee of 20% to assist them in processing a claim for benefits they were already
guaranteed to receive, and that the firm’s conduct was unscrupulous and deceptive. Murray agreed to stop offering
services to West Virginia residents in order to settle that case.

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 6 of 32 PageID# 2085

On October 21, 2013, the Parties requested that the Court order Watts Guerra to take down the
website and videos because they contain false and misleading advertising to members of the Rule
23(b)(2) class (Doc. 82). Two days later, the Court granted the motion and issued an order
requiring Watts Guerra to take down the Website and refrain from further mass marketing
regarding the Settlement Agreement without prior Court approval (“the Take Down Order”)
(Doc. 84). On October 28, 2013, Watts Guerra filed a notice certifying compliance with the
Order, (Doc. 87), but also filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the order violates the
First Amendment and that the Court erroneously based its decision on misstatements made in the
Parties’ motion. (Docs. 85, 86). Defendants respectfully submit this Response to Watts Guerra's
Motion for Reconsideration to refute those contentions.
III.

WINSTON STRAWN DOES NOT REPRESENT WATTS GUERRA OR
RYAN THOMPSON AND HAS NO STANDING TO PROSECUTE THIS
MOTION
In In re Trans Union Corp. Privacy Litig., the United States Court of Appeals for the

Seventh Circuit disposed of an appellate matter in which Watts Guerra was represented by the
same Winston Strawn attorney who has communicated and corresponded with the Parties in this
case, Kimball Anderson. 664 F.3d 1081, 1083 (7th Cir. 2011). In that matter, as sub judice,
Thompson and Watts Guerra tried to hover just beyond the jurisdiction of the court, pursuing
what Judge Posner described as its “[h]eads I win, tails you lose, strategy.” Id. at 1083-84. And
now, the movants herein are engaging in a similar game.
Thompson and Watts Guerra have never properly entered an appearance before this
Court. On August 30, 2013, the Aaron “Objectors” filed a pleading in which various attorneys
where listed as counsel for the Aaron individuals. Of these, Charles B. Molster, III has a
Virginia law license and is apparently charged with signing the group’s pleadings. Mssrs.
6

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 7 of 32 PageID# 2086

Ferranti (Chicago) and Issacharoff (New York)4 moved for admission pro hac vice, which
motions were granted without objection. (Docs. 77, 78). No other Aaron group attorneys are
admitted before the Court.
And now, Mr. Molster has filed the present motion, seeking to speak for his “on paper”
co-counsel, Thompson and Watts Guerra. This presents several real problems. First, Winston
Strawn cannot properly represent both the Aaron individuals and Watts Guerra. As this Court
has explained,
“Loyalty to a client is also impaired when a lawyer cannot consider,
recommend or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of
the lawyer's other responsibilities or interests. The conflict in effect forecloses
alternatives that otherwise would be available to the client. It is also important to
note that “[s]imultaneous representation of parties whose interests in litigation
may conflict, such as co-plaintiffs or co-defendants, is governed by paragraph
(a)(2)” of Rule 1.7. Rule 1.7, Note [23]. “An impermissible conflict may exist by
reason of substantial discrepancy in the parties’ testimony, incompatibility in
positions in relation to an opposing party or the fact that there are substantially
different possibilities of settlement of the claims or liabilities in question.” Id.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has made clear that:
In determining whether to disqualify counsel for conflict of interest, the trial
court is not to weigh the circumstances ‘with hair-splitting nicety’ but, in
the proper exercise of its supervising power over the members of the bar
and with the view of preventing ‘the appearance of impropriety,’ it is to
resolve all doubts in favor of disqualification.
In other words, the assessment must be made in perspective of the realities of the
case.
It is, of course, important in our system of justice that parties be free to
retain counsel of their choice. “However, this Court has held that the right of one
to retain counsel of his choosing is ‘secondary in importance to the Court‘s duty
to maintain the highest ethical standards of professional conduct to insure and
preserve trust in the integrity of the bar.’”

4

For whatever reason, Mr. Issacharoff is not on the counsel list for the present motion.

7

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 8 of 32 PageID# 2087

Sanford v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 687 F. Supp. 2d 591, 601-02 (E.D. Va. 2009) (citations
omitted). The subject Motion, and that of the Parties that led to the Order, were directed solely
at Watts Guerra and Thompson. There is no challenge to the rights or interests of the Aaron
individuals. And, if Winston Strawn seeks to represent those individuals, the Parties would
ordinarily lack any standing to complain. But Winston Strawn cannot also represent Watts
Guerra, which is alleged by these motions to have misled the very consumers Winston Strawn
claims to represent.
Accordingly, the real postural problem for Watts Guerra’s motion is not simply an active
conflict of interest, but rather one of standing. Winston Strawn has not actually appeared as
counsel Mr. Thompson or Watts Guerra in this case. And Mr. Thompson himself has not sought
admission pro hac vice. There is no one who has been responsive to the Parties’ meet-and
confer-attempts. Mr. Anderson made a very explicit proclamation that Winston Strawn does not
represent Watts Guerra. While the text and tone of the present motion may suggest an intention
to speak for Watts Guerra, that entity and Thompson first need to appear in the case as an
interested party, and with attorney representation that is not already bound to represent the Aaron
consumers – who are themselves potentially adverse to Watts Guerra.
This is also of concern for another important reason. There is no one answerable to the
Court who has been willing to meet-and-confer or to engage with the Parties to discuss these
motions (or anything else in the case). Prior to the Court’s Order, Messrs. Anthony and Bennett
contacted by e-mail the various attorneys who were listed within the Aaron pleadings. Only one
responded – Kimball Anderson, a Chicago lawyer not admitted in this case. In each of several emails back and forth to schedule a meet and confer call, Mr. Anderson removed Thompson from
the contact chain. When that first call occurred, the day the Order was entered, Mr. Anderson

8

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 9 of 32 PageID# 2088

very explicitly responded to the Parties’ counsel on the call (including Anthony and Bennett)
that, “I don’t represent Watts Guerra.” (verbatim). In later communications and another meet
and confer call attempt, Mr. Anderson was the only attorney who responded or attended. Watts
Guerra and Thompson have yet to respond even once.
IV.

ARGUMENT
A.

The Court's Take Down Order Was and Is Proper

Lawyer advertising – and there is no doubt but that the Watts Guerra campaign was
lawyer advertising – is commercial speech” (Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 36364, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2698-99 (1977)) entitled to First Amendment protection only if it is not
misleading. Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 447 U.S. 557, 566, 100
S.Ct. 2343, 2351 (1980). Because public naiveté may cause even literally accurate lawyer
advertising to be misleading, there is a substantial governmental interest in placing lawyer
advertising in its proper perspective. Peel v. Atty. Registration & Disciplinary Comm’n, 496
U.S. 91, 108, S.Ct. 2281, 2291 (1990). Watts Guerra's campaign was inherently misleading: it
falsely suggested the existence of a “claims” process; it inaccurately described the settlement and
the procedural setting of the case; it failed to advise its targets that they already had appointed
counsel, and, after August 30, it falsely implied that there was action the viewer could take in the
Berry case for which a lawyer’s services would be useful. The Court’s order is entirely
consistent with the First Amendment.
To avoid the legitimate governmental strictures on lawyer advertising to persons with
whom the lawyer has no prior relationship, Watts Guerra makes a specious argument that their
BringaClaim.com website, available to literally billions of internet users worldwide, and their

9

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 10 of 32 PageID# 2089

television ads that ran on cable channels such as Fox News, BET and Investigation Discovery,
were “communications . . . made by Watts Guerra principally to the own clients.” (Doc. 86, p. 6).
First, the “clients” Watts Guerra refers to are not “clients”with respect to the Berry
matter; they are 20,000 claimants from the In Re Trans Union litigation to whom Watts Guerra
had previously and effectively marketed. Until they signed up as clients in this case, they were
former clients.
Second, Watts Guerra long ago acquired physical mailing addresses, telephone numbers,
and in many cases email addresses for those former limited scope clients. If Watts Guerra
wanted to communicate “principally” with its former clients, the tailored and by far most
economical means by which to do so would have been to drop a letter in the mail. The scope and
expense of what Watts Guerra did puts the lie to their statements to the Court: internet and
television advertising is principally useful in reaching persons with whom the advertiser does not
yet have a relationship. Here, the obviously intended targets of Watts Guerra’s advertising were
non-clients represented by other, Court-appointed counsel. Their communications must be
analyzed as lawyer advertising.
Third, the television advertising campaign began after the objection deadline had passed,
after the last date on which Watts Guerra could offer services to anyone who had not already
signed up with them.
The Motion for Reconsideration mischaracterizes the Court's order as prohibiting Watts
Guerra from communicating with its clients. The Order does no such thing. Watts Guerra is free
to call, write or email anyone who has signed an agreement retained them for services in this
case. The Order merely prohibits Watts Guerra from indiscriminately communicating with
10

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 11 of 32 PageID# 2090

persons represented by Class Counsel with misleading materials implying that a Class Member
who has not already objected to the Settlement has the ability to do so after the deadline has
expired.
The Court's order requiring Watts Guerra to take down the Website and preventing it from
making further statements to Class Members was not an unlawful prior restraint. The Court did
not prevent Watts Guerra from speaking in the first instance. Rather, Watts Guerra spoke first
and the Court then sanctioned the firm based on that impermissible speech. Only after Watts
Guerra spoke did the Court sanction it by limiting similar future speech. Although the Court did
not explicitly state the factual basis for such violations, the Parties supplied several legitimate
reasons in their Motion to Correct (Doc. 83). As discussed below, the Website and Videos were
saturated with false statements. Watts Guerra cannot, therefore, complain that it does not know
on what basis the Court made its decision. The Order does not amount to an impermissible prior
restraint.
Finally, Watts Guerra cannot now complain of the purported overbreadth or scope of the
current Order as they have had every opportunity to suggest an alternative (and a truthful one) to
the broad and inaccurate advertising previously utilized. On multiple occasions, Messrs. Bennett
and Anthony, on behalf of their respective clients and teams, tried to meet and confer with Watts
Guerra. Neither Mr. Thompson nor any other person from Watts Guerra has even been so
courtesy (or concerned) as to respond to an e-mail or attend a telephone conference. The lone
Aaron attorney to respond, Mr. Anderson, refused to discuss any alternative language or changes
to the Watts Guerra advertising.

B.

Watts Guerra’s Counter-Notice Campaign Would Likely Confuse and
Mislead the Members of the Public and Rule 23(b)(2) Class

The “counter-notice” campaign proposed by Watts Guerra is as inherently misleading.
Given the procedural setting of the case, Class Members who have not already objected have no
action to take in the case whatsoever. Since they have no choices to make, and no actions to take
unless and until a court denies settlement approval, they have no current use for additional legal
services. Offering to “represent” them in a matter in which they can now play no role is
inexcusable.
Watts Guerra appears to be trying to assemble a list of persons who might have a claim to
assert against LexisNexis if the Berry settlement is not ultimately approved. They cannot lure
consumers into giving them information with false representations that Watts Guerra can provide
them services in connection with the Court’s determination of whether to approve the settlement.
Watts Guerra does not deny the strong majority of the accusations leveled as to its
http://www.BringAClaim.com website, its “we will send you a check” promise or the
overshadowing of the Class Notice by the aggressive marketing and sales pitch. Instead, the firm
defends its advertising by suggesting that some of it was not 100% inaccurate, or that while
misleading on its own, the Watts Guerra counter-notice campaign would not be practically
misleading because class members could also find and read the Court’s actual notice. These
defenses are best viewed as mitigation of Watts Guerra’s ethical exposure rather than as
meaningful arguments for Watts Guerra’s unfettered distortion of the Court’s final approval
process, or worse – successful implementation of an approved settlement. Even accepting that
some of Watts Guerra’s recent webpages included a link to the actual settlement notice and

12

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 13 of 32 PageID# 2092

website, as a whole and in most ways by itself, the Watts Guerra campaign grossly misstated the
settlement and case and made promises that are unsupported by the claims and law in the case.
Watts Guerra’s statements suggest to Website viewers that they will gain nothing and
lose everything under the current Settlement Agreement, lose absolutely nothing by opposing it,
and gain a cash award if they hire Watts Guerra. (Doc. 83, Ex. D). Essentially, Watts Guerra
presents a classic “too good to be true scenario” -- that hiring Watts Guerra presents very little
risk and a comparatively high potential reward. (Doc. 83, Ex. D). This is one of the overarching
misimpressions that the Parties seek to correct.
Watts Guerra creates this low risk, high reward misimpression by providing several
pieces of misleading information while omitting two pieces of critical information. First, the
firm states that if viewers do not object to the settlement the Court will likely approve it, in
which event. Rule 23(b)(2) class members will receive no money. This implies both that
viewers can still object to the settlement, and that the Rule 23(b)(2) class will receive no value in
the settlement. (Doc. 83, Ex. B, p. 1). It also states that the firm provides an alternative -suggesting that if a viewer objects (after the passage of the objection deadline), Watts Guerra
might obtain $100 to $1,000 on that person's behalf (without explaining the difficulty of a
willfulness claim or the uncertainty of litigation generally). (Doc. 83, Ex. B, p. 8). The site
omits any reference to the substantial benefits the injunctive relief will provide the Rule 23(b)(2)
class. It also omits the fact that the Rule 23(b)(2) class members retain an important alternative
to objecting: they retain their right to bring individual claims for actual damages under the
FCRA, and may recover attorneys' fees for those claims. Taken together, these facts improperly
suggest to website viewers that they will gain nothing and lose everything under the current

13

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 14 of 32 PageID# 2093

settlement, lose absolutely nothing by challenging it, and gain a cash award if they do. None of
these suggestions has a basis in fact.
This misimpression is particularly noteworthy when one puts the communications into
context. Watts Guerra continued to direct these communications at members of the Rule
23(b)(2) class well after the objection deadline had passed, at a time when those class members
had literally no use for the services of the Watts Guerra law firm.5 This included a television ad
that was directed at all Rule 23(b)(2) class members, not just the Watts Guerra firm’s supposed
“clients.” See id. Although that television ad exhorted class members to “Call to File Your
Claim NOW!”, no claims process exists—a fact not disclosed in the television ad. Nor does the
television ad, in addition to asking class members to call the Watts Guerra’s firm’s toll-free
number to “File Your Claim NOW!”, disclose the existence of class counsel, inform class
members that the objections deadline had passed, or say anything about the existing proposed
settlement. When placed into this context, it becomes clear that the television ad, like the other
parts of the Advertising Campaign, could only confuse absent class members and was not part of
a bona fide lawyer solicitation.
The fact that Watts Guerra also included some truthful statements in the Website and
Videos does not provide the Advertising Campaign, as a whole, with First Amendment
protection. To the contrary, the Court must not assume that individual viewers will know which
statements are truthful, know which are not, and ignore the latter. Simply put, and especially in
the context of lawyer advertising, the Court should not assume that viewers will parse out Watts
5

See, e.g., the television ad currently available at http://www.ispot.tv/ad/72lV/watts-guerra-consumer-report, which
last aired on television on September 30, 2013, and which promises viewing class members, “You May Be Entitled
to Cash Compensation!” and “You May Be Entitled to Compensation! Call to File Your Claim NOW!”

14

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 15 of 32 PageID# 2094

Guerra's false statements from its true statements when making the critical decision regarding
whether to retain its services. Rather, the Court must view the materials in their entirety as
would any ordinary viewer. When viewed this way, Watts Guerra's statements intentionally
create viewer misimpressions and confusion.
Watts Guerra attempt to circumvent the ethical requirements, which require attorneys to
communicate truthfully and candidly, by stating that it merely communicated with its “clients”
from the Trans Union litigation. Watts Guerra asserts that this preexisting relationship allows it
to communicate more freely with those clients. However, even if a preexisting attorney-client
relationship allowed an attorney to mislead and lie to his or her current clients (which it does
not), that is not what happened here. Rather, Watts Guerra provided mass advertising on
television, internet videos, and internet websites that reached many members of the general
public that Watts Guerra never before represented. Nor does a past relationship with a “client”
in the Trans Union matter provide a basis for finding that those people remain Watts Guerra
clients for the purposes of this matter.6 When that case ended, so too did Watts Guerra's
relationship with those clients. Watts Guerra had no preexisting relationship with the potential
clients it misled.
Watts Guerra stated in its Website video, and continues to falsely assert, that potential
clients “risk nothing by being part of this action.” (Doc. 86, pp. 14-15; Doc. 83, Ex. D) (“stating
that Watts Guerra “Fails to fairly describe the injunctive relief provided for in the Proposed
Settlement, objectively or otherwise”). Watts Guerra remains adamant in its position that “the

6

This is especially true considering the tenuous nature of Watts Guerra‘s relationship is with any one “client” in
such cases.

15

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 16 of 32 PageID# 2095

(b)(2) class members get nothing in the proposed settlement--and, therefore, risk nothing in
objecting to same.” (Doc. 86, p. 14). In light of the prior briefing on this issue and the Court's
preliminary approval order recognizing the value of the injunctive relief, the Parties will not
reargue this point. (Doc. 83, Ex. D). Watts Guerra's statement that the injunctive relief lacks
value does not make that contention true, no matter how many times it is repeated. The fact
remains that the injunctive relief provides industry-wide changes that will ensure Class Members
are not subject to the precise treatment of which they complained when they originally filed this
suit in 2011. (Doc. 83, Ex. A) (“The Settlement requires the Defendants, at their expense, to
design, implement, and maintain specific, substantial procedures that address the lawsuit’s
concerns about the preparation and sale of Accurint® searches and reports to debt collectors.”).
Watts Guerra's statement that the injunctive relief lacks value is false.
Watts Guerra, in addition, failed to address several misrepresentations the Parties
identified in their Motion to Correct. For example, Watts Guerra did not address the Parties
contention that the Website “[f]alsely describes the release as being broader than it really is, in
order to convince absent class members to object . . . .” (Doc. 83, Ex. D, p. 4). Nor does Watts
Guerra address the Parties claim that the advertising campaign “[f]alsely obscures the distinction
between the proposed Rule 23(b)(2) Class and the Rule 23(b)(3) Class.” (Doc. 83, Ex. D, p. 5).
The Parties' Motion to Correct provides further examples and exhibits in support. (Doc. 83).
The following excerpts from the Website explain the disagreement and more thoroughly
demonstrate the Parties’ position that the Website has a misleading design intended to create a
“high-pressure sales” feel. Specifically, the screen shots show exactly how a viewer may access
the Court-approved settlement website from the Watts Guerra Website.

After entering http://www.BringaClaim.com as intended and displayed before the Court’s
“Take-down” Order, the viewer sees the following (“the Home Page”):7

The Parties have resized the pictures for clarity of presentation.

In the first step, in order to stumble across the actual approved Notice website link, the
viewer must ignore the prominent video, both the “LEARN MORE” button and the large “Click
Here For Help With Your Claim” link, and an embedded textual hyperlink. The viewer must
instead scroll to the bottom of the page to locate “THE BERRY SETTLEMENT” link on the
Home Page.8 Clicking that link opens the following page:

Watts Guerra states in its Motion for Reconsideration that “the home page had two prominent links routing
viewers to a landing page for ‘The Berry Settlement’ . . . .” (emphasis added). Watts Guerra appears to be mistaken
-- the only link routing the Website Home Page to “The Berry Settlement” page is outlined in the above image.
(Doc. 86, pp. 9-10.).

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 21 of 32 PageID# 2100

The viewer must again ignore the large “CLICK HERE” button and click on the nondescript website link or the embedded hyperlink at the end of the page to visit the class
settlement home page. In fact, Watts Guerra similarly buried nearly all of the important links on
its Website to make it less likely that readers would actually obtain the court-approved
information. (Doc. 83, Ex. B).
Fundamentally,, Watts Guerra provided only deeply buried links to information regarding
the existence of Class Counsel and Class Counsel’s relationship with the Rule 23(b)(2) class
(Doc. 83, Ex. B; Doc. 86, p. 13). Watts Guerra argues that it provided a disclaimer on the
Website containing the Video, stating that “[p]rior results do not guarantee a similar outcome
and depend on the facts of each matter.” (Doc. 86, p. 14). The only way to access this
disclaimer statement from the Website Home page is to click “THE BERRY SETTLEMENT”
link in the first image, and to then dig deeper into the second image, where a further miniscule
link is provided at the very bottom of the page:

21

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 22 of 32 PageID# 2101

22

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 23 of 32 PageID# 2102

Merely providing these relatively small links (in relation to the large “CLICK HERE”
buttons and other links) does not transform the Website and its sub pages, as a whole, into a fair
and accurate depiction of the Settlement Agreement.
Watts Guerra created this overall Website design in an attempt to lure viewers into
“signing up” before actually visiting the official Court-approved Class Website and becoming
fully informed of the relevant issues. In fact, the retainer agreement “eSign” form used a
technology that directs the viewer to the “Next” part of the form the viewer must fill in. Clicking
the “Next” button after filling out the initial questionnaire form skipped over all of the terms of
the agreement and took the viewer to the “eSignature” block at the end of the document. (Doc.
83, pp. 3-6) (the PDF version does not currently contain the technology). Taken together, the
Website design and content show that Watts Guerra intentionally misled viewers into quickly
signing up based on misimpressions about the Rule 23(b)(2) settlement.9 Thus, Watts Guerra
Marketing Campaign purposefully avoids any substantive discussion of, or convenient or
conspicuous reference to, the Court-approved settlement websites and the Court-approved notice
describing the settlement.
C. Watts Guerra's Speech Amounts to False Advertisement that the First
Amendment Does Not Protect
False and misleading statements and material omissions permeate the Watts Guerra massadvertising campaign. The First Amendment does not protect such statements, and Watts
Guerra’s Motion for Reconsideration therefore lacks merit. Attorney “[a]dvertising that is false,
deceptive, or misleading of course is subject to restraint.” Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S.
9

Of course, the television advertising contains no references whatsoever to appointed Class Counsel or discussion of
the existing settlement. Instead, the ads compel class members to visit the Watts Guerra website first, after hearing
the misleading descriptions that comprise the ads.

350, 383, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2709 (1977) (citing Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Consumer
Council, 425 U.S. 748, 771-72 & n. 24, 96 S.Ct 1817, 1830-31 (1976). Because “the advertiser
knows his product and has a commercial interest in its dissemination, we have little worry that
regulation to assure truthfulness will discourage protected speech.” Bates, 433 U.S. at 383.
“Indeed, the public and private benefits from commercial speech derive from confidence in its
accuracy and reliability.” Id. Thus, the First Amendment provides no protection for ‘untruthful or
misleading expression’ in lawyer advertising.” Id. In fact, “because the public lacks
sophistication concerning legal services, misstatements that might be overlooked or deemed
unimportant in other advertising may be found quite inappropriate in legal advertising.” Id.
1.
The Court’s Order Does Not Constitute an Impermissible Prior Restraint on
Protected Speech
The Court should also reject Watts Guerra's argument that the Court’s Take Down Order
amounts to an impermissible prior restraint on speech.10 Courts have the ability to limit
communications between parties and potential class members. District courts have “both the
duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a class action and to enter appropriate
orders governing the conduct of counsel and parties.” Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 100,
101 S.Ct. 2193, 2200 (1981). Rule 23(d) provides that, “[i]n the conducting an action under this

10

Contrary to Watts Guerra’s contention, the Court‘s Order does not require the “blessing of both Class Counsel
and the Court . . .” before Watts Guerra may post further information related to the Settlement Agreement. Rather,
the Court required that Watts Guerra meet and confer with the Parties Counsel before posting information to ensure
that there is an actual dispute between the Parties and Watts Guerra. If the Parties do not object, Watts Guerra will
be free to post information as it pleases. The Order does not, therefore, improperly delegate authority to the Parties.
It instead preserves the Court‘s resources by ensuring that all involved do not, in fact, agree that the future
communication is permissible.
As far the “blessing” of the Court, the Parties suggest that this Court refer the clearance of any future website
content to a Special Master or Magistrate Judge for approval if there is a dispute as to content between the Parties
and Watts Guerra.

24

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 25 of 32 PageID# 2104

rule, the court may issue orders that: . . . (C) impose conditions on the representative parties or
on intervenors . . . [and] (E) deal with similar procedural matters.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(d).
As Watts Guerra notes, the Court should impose a remedy restricted to that necessary to
prevent and correct the effects of improper Class communications and conduct under Rule 23.
Coles v. Marsh, 560 F.2d 186, 189 (3d Cir. 1977), cert denied, 434 U.S. 985, 98 S.Ct. 611. The
Supreme Court stated in Gulf Oil that “[a]n order limiting communications between parties and
potential class members should be based on a clear record and specific findings that reflect a
weighing of the need for a limitation and the potential interference with the rights of the parties.”
452 U.S. at 101-102. The district court in Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 160 F.R.D. 478
(E.D. Pa. 1995), faced a similar factual situation. Several law firms sent misleading solicitations
to members of the potential settlement class, urging them to opt-out or to object to the fairness of
the proposed settlement. By the opt-out date, absent class members had filed 201,654 opt-out
requests. The court determined that the solicitations by outside counsel contained misstatements,
“likely confused and misled class members, caused a high number of opt-outs, and therefore, had
an adverse effect on the administration of justice.” Id. at 498.
The outside counsel made very similar misstatements to those made by Watts Guerra in
this case. For example, they stated:
1.

“[T]he only way to protect your rights to future compensation is to sign the
enclosed ‘opt out‘ form immediately and “if you do not send in this form
immediately, YOU WILL LOSE VALUABLE RIGHTS IN THE EVENT YOU
DEVELOP AN ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASE IN THE FUTURE.” Id. at
491.

2.

“[A]sbestos companies can back out of this proposed settlement at any time but
victims are bound to its terms forever.” Id. at 492.

25

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 26 of 32 PageID# 2105

3.

Letters stating that “this proposed settlement forces you to give up something…
FOR NOTHING IN RETURN.” Id. at 494.
The court further stated that:
To compound the problem, but not the sole factor that makes these
communications misleading, is the fact that almost all of the communications
submitted by the settling parties in support of their joint motion contain one-sided
attacks on the proposed settlement without any mention of its benefits. . . .
Indeed, most do not even note the existence of a Court-approved notice packet or
how to obtain one. . . . It is apparent that the manner in which information was
presented in these letters and advertisements was certain to discourage class
members from participating in the settlement.

Id. at 496 (footnote omitted). In that case, the Court required curative notice to those who had
opted-out, and established a second opt-out period. Id. at 502.
Similar action has been taken by other courts. See In re Fed. Skywalk Cases, 97 F.R.D.
370, 374 (W.D. Mo. 1983); Impervious Paint Indus., Inc. v. Ashland Oil, 508 F. Supp. 720, 722
(W.D. Ky. 1981); see also David F. Herr, Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) § 21.33
(2008) (“Objectors to a class settlement or their attorneys may not communicate misleading or
inaccurate statements to class members about the terms of a settlement to induce them to file
objections or to opt out. If improper communications occur, curative action might be necessary,
such as extending deadlines for opting out . . . or voiding improperly solicited opt outs and
providing a new opportunity to opt out.”).
The rules and caselaw limiting what Watts Guerra could say in its advertising to potential
clients existed at the time that it spoke. No law required Watts Guerra to obtain a license or preapproval from the government to make those communications. After Watts Guerra spoke, the
parties complained to the court and the court took corrective action. In this case Watts Guerra
spoke first and then was required to retract its misleading and inaccurate speech, rather than

26

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 27 of 32 PageID# 2106

being prevented from speaking in the first instance. The court then issued its order preventing
similar future speech based on its finding that the speech violates the rules and law. These
events do not constitute prior restraint; rather, they are corrective action after the fact.
2.
Even if the First Amendment Provides Some Protection to Watts Guerra’s
Speech, the Court May Nevertheless Properly Limit that Speech in this Case
The Court should apply the “commercial speech” test. At best this is a lawyer advertising
issue involving commercial speech. Movant even must acknowledge that Watts Guerra, or any
other law firm, may not mislead or make a misrepresentation. Additionally, Watts Guerra cannot
mount a facial challenge because this is commercial speech.
Speech by professionals obviously has many dimensions. “There are circumstances in
which we will accord speech by attorneys on public issues and matters of legal representation the
strongest protection our Constitution has to offer.” See, e.g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501
U.S. 1030, 111 S.Ct. 2720 (1991); In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 1893 (1978). However,
pure commercial advertising has always received a lesser degree of protection under the First
Amendment. “Particularly because the standards and conduct of state-licensed lawyers have
traditionally been subject to extensive regulation by the States, it is all the more appropriate that
we limit our scrutiny of state regulations to a level commensurate with the 'subordinate position'
of commercial speech in the scale of First Amendment values.” Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc.,
515 U.S. 618, 635, 115 S.Ct. 2371, 2381 (1995) (citations omitted).
a.
The Court and the Parties have a Substantial Interest
in Protecting the Class Settlement Process
The State has a legitimate and, indeed, “compelling“ interest in preventing those aspects
of solicitation that involve fraud, undue influence, intimidation, overreaching, and other forms of

27

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 28 of 32 PageID# 2107

“vexatious conduct.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 462, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1918
(1978). The Court, in addition, has an obligation to protect class members from such
information in precisely the manner in which it did in this case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(d)).
Concerning communications with putative class members, the Supreme Court in Gulf Oil
articulated the standard: “regulation of communication is appropriate where the purposes of
Rule 23 are threatened or undermined.” Adair v. EQT Prod. Co., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110512
(W.D. Va. Sept. 28, 2011) (citing Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 100, 101 S.Ct. 2193,
2200 (1981), (“Because of the potential for abuse, a district court has both the duty and the broad
authority to exercise control over a class action and to enter appropriate orders governing the
conduct of counsel and parties.”). The Court also has the interest in protecting its own
investment in time and resources to effectuate the Settlement Agreement against illegitimate
attack.
b.

The Court Adequately Tailored its Order to the Facts of this Case

The Court adequately tailored its Take Down Order. Because regulation of commercial
speech “may extend only as far as the interest it serves,’ . . . state rules that are designed to
prevent the ‘potential for deception and confusion . . . may be no broader than reasonably
necessary to prevent the’ perceived evil.” Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U.S. 466, 472,
108 S.Ct. 1916, 1921 (1988) (citations omitted).
The Order merely required Watts Guerra to stop using mass advertising to communicate
with Rule 23(b)(2) Class Members who have no current ability to make use of any legal services
in this case. The Order required Watts Guerra to take down all websites and videos relating to
the Proposed Settlement and cease any and all advertising campaigns or other communications
related to the Proposed Settlement whether on television, the radio, or other media. (Doc. 84, pp.
28

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 29 of 32 PageID# 2108

1-2). Additionally, no other Watts Guerra- or Thompson-controlled websites were implicated in
the Take Down Order. Similarly, the only videos, advertising campaigns or other
communications implicated in the Court’s order were those describing the Proposed Settlement
and indiscriminately directed at persons who could make no use of Watts Guerra’s services. The
Court thus tailored the Order to preclude communications that would necessarily reach members
of the Rule 23(b)(2) who have not already objected to the settlement..
Watts Guerra remains free to contact its existing clients through any other means
available. (Doc. 84). Watts Guerra may call its clients by phone, send them letters, or visit them
in person. In fact, if Watts Guerra does not have other means of directly communicating with its
“clients,“ it would probably run afoul of the Rules of Professional Conduct requiring attorneys to
keep clients apprised of information related to their case.
Most tellingly, in its Motion for Reconsideration, Watts Guerra claims the Take Down
Order is not adequately tailored but never offers a less-restrictive means to achieve the
substantial interest in protecting the Class Members from its misrepresentations. After the Court
issued the Take Down Order, Parties’ counsel attempted to discuss with Watts Guerra what less
restrictive alternatives could accomplish this goal. Watts Guerra either could not come up with,
or would not share, any ideas.11 Instead it filed this motion while pretending to meet and confer.
Watts Guerra has not suggested a better restriction either or proposed what it thinks is accurate.

11

As earlier stated, Watts Guerra would not meet and confer on this issue in good faith. It provided only Kimball
Anderson, who stated he could not speak on behalf of Watts Guerra. Anderson Then requested twenty-four hours to
respond, and pushed this request back further in his email. Ultimately, Watts Guerra did not respond but instead
elected to file the Motion for Reconsideration. The Parties believe that all concerned might have been able to reach
an agreement and avoid the additional extensive filings had Watts Guerra undertaken a good-faith meet and confer.
Although this response shows that Watts Guerra’s arguments lack merit, for the Court‘s convenience, the Parties
remain willing to address the issue informally.

29

Case 3:11-cv-00754-JRS Document 89 Filed 11/01/13 Page 30 of 32 PageID# 2109

c.
The Potential Harm Far Outweighs Any Value the Speech
May Have
The value any truthful statements in Watts Guerra's campaign are undermined by the
accompanying false and misleading statements. Watts Guerra has no legitimate need to speak to
class members whom are not their clients after the objection deadline. Watts Guerra is merely
trying to get a list of people it can later represent in individual suits. It is, therefore, abusing the
legal system to create a client list for future cases. The Court should not condone this behavior.
Watts Guerra’s speech is at best misleading and retains little value. On the other hand, Watts
Guerra threatens to destroy the immense value provided by the injunctive relief. This balance
favors strongly favors the remedy the court ordered.
V.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should overrule Watts Guerra’s Motion for

Reconsideration, or in the alternative Order Watts Guerra to meet and confer directly with the
Parties’ Virginia counsel to determine of there is a negotiable solution to the pending dispute;
and Refer this matter to a Special Master.
