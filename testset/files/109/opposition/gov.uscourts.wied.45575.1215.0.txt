IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
GREEN BAY DIVISION
APPLETON PAPERS INC. and
NCR CORPORATION,
Plaintiffs,
v.

No. 08-CV-16-WCG

GEORGE A. WHITING PAPER
COMPANY, et al.,
Defendants.
RESPONSE OF PLAINTIFF APPLETON PAPERS INC. TO THE
FRG DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
AMENDED COUNTERCLAIMS

Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. (“API”) opposes the FRG Defendants’ Motion for
Leave to File Amended Counterclaims (Dkt. 1185) for the reasons set forth in Plaintiff
NCR Corporation’s Response to FRG Defendants’ Motion for Leave to File Amended
Counterclaims to Seventh Amended Complaint (“NCR Response”). Dkt. 1212. API
joins the NCR Response and adopts the arguments and authorities set forth therein.
An assertion made in the FRG Defendants’ brief warrants comment.

The

Defendants erroneously assert that the Court has ruled that “NCR and API . . . must pay
100% of the past and future response costs and natural resource damage overpayments
appropriately incurred by defendants with respect to OU2-OU5.”

Dkt. 1186 at 6

(emphasis added). Although the Court initially ruled that “Plaintiffs’ liability under
§ 107 for the OU2-5 portions of the river is not contested,” Dkt. 1080 at 14, the Court
retracted this finding as to API when it granted API’s motion for reconsideration, stating:
“Appleton Papers is correct that there was no basis to conclude that it had ‘conceded’ its
liability in this action.” Dkt. 1139 at 1.

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 10/17/11 Page 1 of 3 Document 1215

Further, in a decision released the same day in the Government’s Fox River
enforcement action (Case No. 10-CV-910), the Court denied the Government’s motion
for preliminary injunction because it concluded that “Appleton Papers Inc. is likely not
liable under CERCLA.” Dkt. 172 at 21 in Case No. 10-CV-910. The Court reaffirmed
that ruling in a subsequent decision in the enforcement action. Dkt. 193.
At the August 1, 2011 status conference in this case, the Court opined on the
likely impact of its reconsideration ruling on the Defendants’ pending counterclaims:
Yeah, it seems to me the ruling I’ve made now, the reconsideration would
eliminate any liability you [API] would have on the counterclaims by the
defendants.
***
Now, this is the guidance part. We haven’t ruled this way. I mean, it hasn’t been
raised, but that seems to be the consequences of my ruling, my more recent
ruling.

Transcript of August 1, 2011 Hearing, at 59:16-19 & 60:1-7. Thus, while the Court has
not yet rendered a final decision on API’s liability under CERCLA, that liability clearly
is in doubt. Therefore, Defendants are wrong in asserting that the Court has ruled that
API and NCR are liable for 100% of recoverable response costs in OU2-OU5.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. respectfully requests that
the Court deny the FRG Defendants’ motion for leave to amend their counterclaims.
Dated this 17th day of October, 2011.
Respectfully Submitted,
APPLETON PAPERS INC.
