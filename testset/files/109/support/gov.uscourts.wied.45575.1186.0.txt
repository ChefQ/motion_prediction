BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF FRG DEFENDANTS1 MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
AMENDED COUNTERCLAIMS TO SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT

1

This motion is filed on behalf of the defendants who were, or whose predecessors were, members of the
Fox River Group: CBC Coating Inc., Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP (f/k/a Fort James Operating
Company), Fort James Corporation, and Georgia-Pacific LLC (collectively, “GP”), P.H. Glatfelter
Company, U.S. Paper Mills Corp., and WTM I Company (hereinafter, “FRG Defendants”).

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 09/23/11 Page 1 of 14 Document 1186
PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

The FRG Defendants move this Court pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure for leave to file Amended2 Counterclaims to add a counterclaim for anticipatory
breach of contract against Appleton Papers Inc. (“API”) and NCR Corporation (“NCR”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) and to amend their existing counterclaims for contribution.
The FRG Defendants seek to conform their pleadings to the circumstances of this case. As
signatories to the Fox River Group (“FRG”) Agreements, described below, Plaintiffs agreed that
FRG assessments previously paid would be reallocated by the court’s final ruling on allocation.
The court has issued a final allocation ruling in two summary judgment opinions, dated
December 16, 2009, and March 1, 2011. Dkt. Nos. 795 and 1080. By these rulings, Plaintiffs
are 100% liable and owe full contribution to each FRG Defendant for costs each FRG Defendant
may have incurred in connection with OU2-5 of this Lower Fox River Site. The FRG
assessments, which are the subject of this motion, and which were sought in the FRG
Defendants’ initial counterclaims, were all associated with the site as a whole (that is, OU2-5) or
specific projects in OU2-5.
Although the FRG Defendants believe that the court awarded them their FRG assessments
in the March 1, 2011 decision, Plaintiffs now contend that the FRG Defendants may not
reallocate any FRG assessments unless the underlying costs paid by those assessments can be
shown to be otherwise recoverable under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-75, because the FRG
Defendants asserted counterclaims under section 113 of CERCLA, but did not assert contract
claims. See Dkt. No. 969, [Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants P.H.
Glatfelter Company and WTM I Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Counterclaims]
2

In the case of CBC Coating Inc., this will be its Third Amended Answer, Affirmative Defenses and
Counterclaim.

PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

at 34-35. The FRG Defendants have consistently taken the position that the FRG agreements
make FRG assessments reallocable whether or not they were used to pay CERCLA “costs of
response” or “natural resource damages.” See, e.g., Dkt. No. 878, [Glatfelter & WTM I Brief in
Support of Motion for Summary Judgment] at 25-26; Dkt. No. 894, [Memorandum of Law in
Support of Georgia Pacific’s and Certain Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment] at 8; Dkt.
1044 at 15, [CBC’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment]. Indeed,
NCR and API themselves sought to recover amounts they paid in connection with the FRG
activities in this action. Dkt. No. 265, [Seventh Amended Complaint] at ¶¶ 55, 179, 185.
However, given NCR’s and API’s current position on recoverability of FRG costs, in order to
conform the pleadings to the actual positions that have been consistently asserted in this case, the
FRG Defendants seek leave to amend their counterclaim for FRG assessments as a contract
claim as well as in their contribution claim.
I.

Background
A.

The FRG Agreements
In 1994, predecessors of the FRG Defendants formed the FRG in order to cooperate

in defense and settlement of claims being asserted by the natural resource trustees, the United
States, and the State of Wisconsin (“State”), of which the parties had received formal or informal
notice. In April 1993, Defendant P.H. Glatfelter Co. provided formal notice to NCR – then
known as AT&T Global Information Solutions, Inc. – of the Fox River claims, and invited NCR
to participate in negotiations with the State. NCR declined.
Several years later, the federal natural resource trustees provided notice to NCR and API of
their potential liability for natural resource damages associated with this site. The various
governments sought to negotiate a comprehensive agreement with all seven of the noticed parties
3

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 09/23/11 Page 3 of 14 Document 1186
PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

at that time. Consequently, negotiations began in late 1996 and continued into January 1997
resulting in agreed terms under which NCR and API might join the FRG.
Negotiations for a comprehensive agreement involving the federal parties did not succeed.
However, on January 31, 1997, the FRG Defendants, NCR, and API entered into several
agreements (the “1997 State Agreement”) among each other and the State through the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources (“WDNR”) and the Wisconsin Department of Justice
(“WDOJ”). Dkt. No. 909, [Declaration of Arthur A. Vogel, Jr. (“Vogel Decl.”)] at ¶¶ 2-3. The
1997 State Agreement sought to undertake and implement certain plans, studies, and related
activities associated with alleged injuries to and loss of natural resources and/or services
resulting from alleged releases to the Lower Fox River. These companies continued to refer to
themselves as the “Fox River Group” (“FRG”), and referred to these and subsequent related
agreements as the “FRG Agreements.” Id. at ¶ 5.
At the time the FRG companies entered into the 1997 State Agreement, they also entered
into an agreement among themselves under which they would fund the first $12 million of
shared costs associated with undertaking the activities in connection with the 1997 State
Agreement. Dkt. No. 912, [Declaration of Jayni E. Foley in Support of Georgia-Pacific LLC’s
and Certain Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Equitable Factors (“Foley Decl.”)],
Ex. 105, January 31, 1997 Funding and Interim Implementation Agreement. That agreement
incorporated by reference a proposed allocation scheme set forth in a memorandum from J.
Andrew Schlickman, counsel for NCR, dated January 17, 1997, and revised on January 20, 1997.
Mr. Schlickman’s proposal provided for allocation on an interim basis only, and also provided
that the single share borne by NCR and API jointly would be higher for the first $6 million than
for the second $6 million. Id. at 5-6. Mr. Schlickman’s memorandum further provided, in
4

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 09/23/11 Page 4 of 14 Document 1186
PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

pertinent part: “The amounts paid under this proposal would be subject to reallocation at a later
date through procedures to be agreed to by the parties.” Id. at 5.
FRG costs exceeded $12 million by a considerable amount. A disagreement arose as to
how additional cash calls should be allocated on an interim basis. The FRG agreed to mediate
that disagreement in 1999, and arrived at a second interim allocation agreement on July 27, 1999.
Dkt No. 912, [Foley Decl.], Ex. 106, July 27, 1999 FRG Agreement on Interim Allocation. The
July 27, 1999 FRG Agreement on Interim Allocation provided, in part: “The amounts paid
under this agreement and previous funding agreements among the Companies will be subject to
reallocation upon completion of the final allocation.” Id. at 2. Under that agreement, the “final
allocation” would be the outcome of allocation litigation that could be commenced by any party
after certain events had occurred, including after an order under section 106 of CERCLA had
been issued to any member of the FRG. This case is that allocation litigation.
Plaintiffs themselves sought in this action to recover assessments paid by them to the FRG,
as did the FRG Defendants in their counterclaims. But in the course of resisting the FRG
Defendants’ motions for summary judgment on their counterclaims and again more recently in
connection with their status conference submissions, Plaintiffs have taken the position that with
respect to reallocation of FRG Assessments, only costs and expenses incurred by the FRG that
are consistent with the National Contingency Plan (“NCP”) under CERCLA are subject to
reallocation. Dkt. No. 969, [Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants P.H.
Glatfelter Company and WTM I Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Counterclaims]
at 34-35.
By taking the position that only FRG costs consistent with the NCP are subject to
reallocation, and by refusing to acknowledge their liability for all FRG Assessments, NCR and
5

API are in anticipatory breach of the 1997 Funding Agreement and the 1999 Interim Allocation
Agreement with respect to their commitments regarding reallocation because there is no such
qualification or limitation in any of the relevant agreements.
B.

The “Final Allocation”

When Plaintiffs initiated this action they sought an allocation of response costs
and damages among the parties. Dkt. No. 265, [Seventh Amended Complaint] at ¶¶ 1,
179, 184. Not surprisingly, among other costs and damages, Plaintiffs sought the costs
they had incurred with the Fox River Group. Id. at ¶¶ 54, 55. By initiating this action,
NCR and API put in motion the “final allocation.” This Court’s December 2009 and
February 2011 Decisions concluded NCR and API are not entitled to any reimbursement
of their Fox River costs and damages, and instead must pay 100% of the past and future
response costs and natural resource damage overpayments appropriately incurred by
defendants with respect to OU2-OU5. Dkt. Nos. 795 and 1080. The FRG costs are
plainly part of the costs to be allocated in this proceeding, as contemplated by the FRG
Agreements and by Plaintiffs themselves when they initiated this action seeking (among
other costs and damages) their own FRG costs.
Accordingly, in seeking summary judgment on their counterclaims, each
Defendant sought its FRG costs. Specifically, Certain Defendants set out specific
categories of costs they sought. Dkt. No. 893, [Certain Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment on Equitable Factors]. FRG costs were identified in that motion as well. Id. at
Section B.3 (“[a]ll assessments Defendants paid to fund the Fox River Group after
January 1, 1997, plus six percent simple interest on each assessment from the date of the
assessment and continuing until these judgments are satisfied”). All FRG costs and the
6

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 09/23/11 Page 6 of 14 Document 1186
PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

calculation of accrued interest were fully supported by the Vogel Declaration and
supporting documents. See Dkt. No. 909.
The parties fully briefed issues surrounding the FRG Defendants’ entitlement to a
reallocation of the FRG costs, including that this litigation is the “final allocation.” See
Defendants’ briefing, Dkt. No. 893, at 8-9, 30; Plaintiffs’ briefing, Dkt. No. 998, at 2526, 28 n.16.; Defendants’ reply briefing, Dkt. No. 1044, at 6-13. This Court expressly
granted Dkt. No. 893 in its February 2011 Decision and Order with certain exceptions
that did not include FRG costs.3
Nevertheless, Plaintiffs have since failed to remit payment for the reallocated costs
pursuant to the FRG Agreements. To the contrary, they argue that this Court should include the
issue of whether the FRG costs are NCP consistent in the February trial. Dkt. No. 1163,
[Transcript of Status Conference Before the Honorable William C. Griesbach, United States
District Judge, August 1, 2011, Appleton Papers, Inc., et al. v. George A. Whiting, et al., No. 08CV-00016-WCG] at 23:10-24:2. Plaintiffs, therefore, are in anticipatory breach of their
contractual obligations to the FRG Defendants under the FRG Agreements. Thus, even if not
liable for contribution under section 113 of CERCLA, as set forth in the FRG Defendants’
counterclaims, Plaintiffs are liable for breach of contract for failure to make payments under the
FRG Agreements for reallocated costs.

“The Defendants’ summary judgment motions [857], [861], [891], [893], [902], and [914] are
GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as set forth above. These Defendants are entitled to contribution
from Plaintiffs for expenses incurred in cleaning up OU2-OU5, but resolution of expenses relating to OU1
will require a determination of “arranger” liability. GP’s and U.S. Paper Mills’ motions for summary
judgment will be denied to the extent any of the funds it seeks have been covered by insurance. Issues of
fact preclude a ruling on some aspects of damages, as set forth above.” Dkt. 1080 at 33.

II.

Standard For Leave To Amend Counterclaims
Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, outside the period

where the party may amend its pleading as a matter of course, “a party may amend its pleading
only with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave.” Fed R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). A
court “should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.” Id. The Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit takes a liberal view of Rule 15(a) and the amendment of pleadings. Guse
v. J.C. Penney Co., 570 F.2d 679, 680 (7th Cir. 1978) (“This court has taken a liberal view of
Rule 15(a)”). Whether or not to grant a motion to amend is within the discretion of the district
court. Guise v. BWM Mortgage, LLC, 377 F.3d 795, 801 (7th Cir. 2004). In the absence of a
specific reason, such as undue delay, futility, or undue prejudice, leave to amend should be
granted. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Sound of Music Co. v. Minn. Mining &
Mfg. Co., 477 F.3d 910, 922-23 (7th Cir. 2007).

III.

There Is No Basis to Deny Leave to Amend Counterclaims
There is no basis on which the Court should deny FRG Defendants’ request to amend their

counterclaims to add a claim for anticipatory breach of contract against Plaintiffs. FRG
Defendants have not unduly delayed bringing their counterclaim nor acted in bad faith or with
dilatory motive, and Plaintiffs most certainly would not be prejudiced given that they initiated
this lawsuit and the parties continue to litigate the counterclaims. There is no specific reason to
deny leave to amend FRG Defendants’ Counterclaims for the reasons set forth below.
First, the proposed counterclaim will not unduly prejudice Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs brought this
case seeking to reallocate FRG Costs. From the outset, this case has therefore included that set
of issues. Since filing their counterclaims, the FRG Defendants have maintained throughout this
8

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 09/23/11 Page 8 of 14 Document 1186
PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

litigation that Plaintiffs are liable for all costs associated with the Fox River contamination,
including, specifically, the assessments paid by them for FRG Costs. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 878,
[Glatfelter & WTM I Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment] at 25-26. There is
nothing new about the claims the FRG Defendants seek to add, other than the specific form of
the pleading.
Moreover, Plaintiffs cannot claim prejudice when all that the FRG Defendants seek is that
the judgment in this case enforce the agreements to reallocate FRG assessments in this allocation
litigation. Plaintiffs voluntarily signed the FRG Agreements. They then instituted this lawsuit
seeking, among other things, their FRG payments. Plaintiffs may dislike the outcome of the case
they commenced against Defendants, but Plaintiffs are the ones who put the FRG assessments in
play by suing for their reallocation. Seeking to amend the pleadings in order to ensure Plaintiffs
abide by the Court’s allocation decisions and honor their contractual obligations does not amount
to prejudice.
Second, the new claim is not futile. It includes legally cognizable claims under
section 113 of CERCLA for statutory contribution and for breach of contract. The
amendment merely seeks to conform the pleadings to current circumstances given the
Plaintiffs’ position, taken when the court's rulings have not gone their way, that the FRG
costs which were the basis for the FRG Assessments, had to be NCP consistent - a
condition nowhere found in any of the interim allocation agreements entered into by the
parties.
Finally, the FRG Defendants have not delayed in bringing this counterclaim. The
FRG Defendants have asserted the claim they now seek to plead repeatedly. Indeed in
their summary judgment filings, the FRG Defendants noted in response to Plaintiffs’
9

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 09/23/11 Page 9 of 14 Document 1186
PHI 316,766,829v9 9-23-11

spurious suggestion that they had not properly pled their claim for FRG costs that:
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) this Court can enter judgment on the
FRG costs even if not expressly requested in Defendants’ pleadings. See F.R.C.P.
54(c) (“Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is
entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.”)
Plaintiffs themselves initiated this action, in part to recover their FRG costs. It
therefore would be both fair and judicially efficient to resolve the FRG claims
now.
Dkt. No. 1044, at 8 n.4. Yet, following the March 2011 decision, Plaintiffs persist that the
pleadings must be conformed. Their recent suggestion prompts the timing of this Motion.
Therefore, for the reasons stated above, FRG Defendants respectfully request that
the Court enter an Order granting leave to file the proposed Amended Counterclaims,
attached as Exhibits A through E to the FRG Defendants’ Motion.
