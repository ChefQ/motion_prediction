TO PLAINTIFF CARLOS A. HAWTHORNE AND HIS ATTORNEYS OF
RECORD:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on December 1, 2011, at 8:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as

4

counsel may be heard, in Courtroom 8 of the United States District Court, Northern District of

5

California, located at 450 Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco, California, Defendants Cota,

6

Lee, Robinson, Cruz, Pickett, Holt, and Fox (Defendants) will move this Court to dismiss

7

Plaintiff Carlos A. Hawthorne’s request for incidental, compensatory, and punitive damages

8

against Defendants in Plaintiff’s third amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal

9

Rules of Civil Procedure on the ground that the request, which essentially asserts new claims

10
11
12

against Defendants in their individual capacities, is time-barred.
This motion is based on this notice of motion, the supporting memorandum of points and
authorities, and the pleadings and records on file with the Court.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

14

INTRODUCTION

15

Plaintiff, an inmate at San Quentin State Prison, claims that he was sent to a “walk alone”

16

exercise yard because he is African-American. (Order of Service, 2:13-16, December 15, 2008,

17

ECF No. 19.) He alleges that he was transferred to that yard because the area to which he had

18

previously been assigned “had too many blacks.” (Id.)

19

In his third amended complaint, Plaintiff seeks incidental, compensatory, and punitive

20

damages against Defendants in their individual capacities. As discussed more fully below, such

21

claims are barred by the statute of limitations and must be dismissed.

22
23

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiff, a condemned inmate in the custody of the California Department of Corrections

24

and Rehabilitation at San Quentin State Prison, filed a first amended complaint against

25

Defendants on November 17, 2008. (Complaint Under the Civil Rights Act, November 17, 2008,

26

ECF No. 17.) That complaint stated that Defendants--members of the prison’s Institutional

27

Classification Committee (ICC)--classified him for a “walk-alone” exercise yard because he is

28

African-American. (Order of Service, 2:13-16, December 15, 2008, ECF No. 19.) He alleged

1

that he was sent to that yard in February 2007 because the area where he previously exercised had

2

“too many blacks.” (Id.) The Order of Service found that Plaintiff’s allegation was “sufficient to

3

state an equal protection claim.” (Id.)

4

In a September 2, 2010 order, the Court found that the first amended complaint requested

5

forms of injunctive relief not available to him. (Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part

6

Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, 7:17-28, September 2, 2010, ECF No. 61.)

7

Therefore, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to file a second amended complaint to correct that

8

deficiency. (Id.)

9

While Plaintiff’s second amended complaint continued to seek relief not available to him,

10

the Court’s October 29, 2010 order dismissing and striking portions of that complaint noted that

11

“plaintiff does seek a declaratory judgment that defendants denied his equal protection rights.”

12

(Order Dismissing and Striking in Part Second Amended Complaint, 2:8-9, October 29, 2010,

13

ECF No. 66.) The Court added that “this form of relief is available to him.” (Id.)

14

Plaintiff’s third amended complaint, which was filed on October 7, 2011, includes the

15

request for declaratory relief regarding unconstitutional acts of discrimination that was set forth in

16

the second amended complaint. (Third Amended Complaint, 8:7-9, October 7, 2011, ECF No.

17

84.) But the third amended complaint also seeks “incidental, compensatory, and punitive

18

damages against Defendants based on their unconstitutional acts of discrimination . . . .” (Id. at

19

5:5-6.)

ARGUMENT
I.

PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS IN THEIR
PERSONAL CAPACITIES ARE TIME-BARRED.
The remedies available against individual defendants for a § 1983 claim depends on

whether they are sued in their official or personal capacities. Carmen v. San Francisco Unified
School Dist., 982 F. Supp. 1396, 1407 (N.D. Cal. 1997). Plaintiff is limited to injunctive and
declaratory relief against individual defendants in their official capacities, and damages against
individual defendants in their personal capacities. Id.

Case3:08-cv-01473-WHA Document85

1

Plaintiff’s third amended complaint now seeks incidental, compensatory, and punitive

2

damages against Defendants. (Third Amended Complaint, 5:5-6, October 7, 2011, ECF No. 84.)

3

The request is tantamount to asserting new claims against Defendants in a wholly new capacity,

4

since individual damages are only available against individual defendants in their personal

5

capacities. Such claims cannot proceed in this case because they are barred by the statute of

6

limitations.

7

The statute of limitations in § 1983 civil-rights cases is governed by state law. See Wilson v.

8

Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985). Because civil-rights actions are best characterized as actions

9

for injuries to personal rights, federal courts borrow the state statute of limitations that applies to

10

personal-injury actions. McDougal v. County of Imperial, 942 F.2d 668, 672-74 (9th Cir. 1991).

11

In California, that statute of limitations is two years. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 335.1.1

12

Plaintiff’s third amended complaint alleges that Defendants attempted to cover-up their

13

unconstitutional race-based discrimination by falsely claiming “on the Form 128G that the ICC

14

did not assign Plaintiff to Exercise Yard No. 1 because Plaintiff . . . ‘refused to program on any

15

other yard’ during the February 1 hearing.” (Third Amended Complaint, 6:25-27, October 7,

16

2011, ECF No. 84.) Plaintiff filed an administrative appeal requesting the correction of the

17

inaccuracy “upon receiving the Form 128G.” (Id.)

18

The statute of limitations begins to run once a plaintiff’s cause of action has accrued. Two

19

Rivers v. Lewis, 174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir. 1998). Accrual, which is determined by federal law,

20

occurs “when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the

21

action.” Id.

22
23

In this case, Plaintiff’s cause of action would have accrued no later than April 2007, when
he initiated an administrative appeal concerning his yard assignment. Thus, the statute of

24
25
26
27
28

1

California law also provides that complaints for damages filed by inmates sentenced to
“a term less than life” may be tolled for two years. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 352.1(a), (c). Plaintiff
is a condemned inmate, and cannot be characterized as an inmate sentenced to “a term less than
life.” Therefore, the two-year tolling period is not available to him. See Martinez v. Gomez, 137
F.3d 1124, 1126 (9th Cir. 1998); Grasso v. McDonough Power Equip., 264 Cal.App.2d 597, 601
(1968).

1

limitations for the claims against the Defendants in their individual capacities expired in April

2

2009.

3

Moreover, Plaintiff cannot assert that the claims against Defendants in their individual

4

capacity “relate back” to his original complaint. In Lovelace v. O’Hara, 985 F.2d 847, 848-49

5

(6th Cir. 1993), a homeowner filed a § 1983 action against a sheriff’s deputy in his official

6

capacity. The original complaint contained a statement that the defendant acted “not as an

7

individual” but “clearly within the expressed and implied powers of his official capacity.” Id. at

8

850. The district court later granted the homeowner leave to file an amended complaint naming

9

the sheriff in his individual capacity. Id. The appellate court reversed, concluding that relation

10

back was not proper because defendant did not have notice that he was being sued in his

11

individual capacity within the 120 days allowed for service of the summons and complaint under

12

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Id. at 850-51.

13

An amendment in a defendant’s capacity in a section 1983 action “alters the elements of

14

recovery and defense . . . [and] requires major changes in pleading, discovery, trial preparation

15

and selection and location of witnesses to testify at trial.” Lovelace, 985 F.2d at 850 (quoting Hill

16

v. Shelander, 924 F.2d 1370, 1384 (7th Cir. 1991) (Coffey, J., dissenting). Like the defendant in

17

Lovelace, Defendants in this case were not aware that Plaintiff was seeking to hold them

18

personally liable until long after the suit had been instituted against them in their official capacity.

19

Plaintiff Hawthorne’s second amended complaint, filed more than two years after the original

20

complaint, specifically stated that he was not seeking money damages. (Order Dismissing and

21

Striking in Part Second Amended Complaint, 2:10, October 29, 2010, ECF No. 66.) The

22

Lovelace court noted that “it is not too much to ask that if a person or entity is to be subject to suit,

23

the person or entity should be properly named and clearly notified of the potential of payment of

24

damages individually.” 985 F.2d at 851 (quoting Wells v. Brown, 891 F.2d 591 (6th Cir. 1989).

25

Because Defendants did not have notice that they were being sued individually until more than

26

three years after the original complaint was filed, long after the 120-day period set forth in Rule 4

27

had passed, the request for damages in the third amended complaint must be dismissed.
