No. 3:13-cr-00097-SLG-JDR
UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE IN
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS (Dkt. 85)

The United States responds in opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss
(Dkt. 85; filed 10/14/14) and respectfully asks that it be denied. In short,

Defendant’s Motion asks this Court to make an ex ante ruling on the sufficiency of
the Government’s substantial-step evidence and, based on that ruling, to dismiss
Count 2 of the First Superseding Indictment (Dkt. 75; filed 9/17/14). In support,
Defendant argues that his thoroughly documented and largely uncontested conduct
is insufficient to show that he took a substantial step in attempting to travel in
interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.
See 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b).
But Defendant’s arguments are flawed and his Motion should be denied in
full. First and foremost, Defendant’s request for a pre-trial ruling on the
sufficiency of the United States’ substantial-step evidence runs contrary to
established law.

Whether the United States has proven a substantial step is a

determination that is properly left to a jury—after it has heard and considered the
evidence. See NINTH CIRCUIT MODEL CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION 5.3 (2010) (Attempt
instruction; instructing jury on the need to find a substantial step); see also generally
United States v. Hofus, 598 F.3d 1171 (9th Cir. 2010) (analyzing and upholding the
substantial-step language in the district court’s jury instruction). Even if this Court
were to charitably consider Defendant’s present motion under Rule 29, it would still

Page 2 of 5

be proper to allow the United States to present its evidence at trial before ruling.1
See FED. R. CRIM. P. 29(a) (allowing a defendant to move for acquittal after the close
of the government’s case-in-chief). Thus, because no jury has been seated and no
evidence presented, the ruling that Defendant’s Motion seeks would be premature
and improper.
Moreover, even if this Court were to consider the sufficiency of the
Government’s substantial-step evidence at this preliminary stage, it would find
adequate grounds upon which a rational juror could determine that a substantial step
occurred. See generally United States v. Goetzke, 494 F.3d 1231, 1235-7 (9th Cir.
2007) (per curiam) (upholding attempt-based conviction in light sufficient evidence
for a rational juror to determine that a substantial step occurred). Though
Defendant’s motion seeks to minimize his damning conversations and actions,
1

Indictments may be dismissed pre-trial if a court finds that fundamental facial or procedural
defects abound. No facial or procedural defects have been alleged here. Were Defendant to
allege such defects at this late stage, his efforts to escape trial would still fall short. “Only a defect
so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no longer to be a grand jury, or the indictment no
longer to be an indictment, gives rise to the constitutional right not to be tried.” Midland Asphalt
Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 802 (1989). FED. R. CRIM. P. 7(c) requires only that an
indictment “be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the
offense charged.” Thus, courts need look only to the face of the indictment to assess whether or
not there are any defects warranting dismissal. United States v. Hickey, 367 F.3d 888, 894 (9th
Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court has formulated criteria to be used when evaluating a challenged
indictment: (1) whether the indictment contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged
and sufficiently informs the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet and (2) whether it will
provide him with adequate future protection against Double Jeopardy. Russell v. United States,
369 U.S. 749, 763-64 (1962). Because Count 2 of the First Superseding Indictment satisfies these
criteria in all aspects—and Defendant has made no allegation that Count 2 is facially or
procedurally flawed—dismissal should not be granted.

Defendant cannot plausibly argue that no rational juror could find a substantial step
based solely on the facts that he concedes.2

For example, Defendant does not

dispute that, inter alia, he:
 stated that he enjoyed having sex with children in Cambodia;
 told an undercover agent that he knew someone who could acquire
children in Cambodia to have sex with;
 planned a trip to Cambodia with an undercover agent for the stated
purpose of having sex with children;
 expressed his intent to join the agent in travelling to Cambodia and
having sex with children while there;
 agreed to a date on which he and the agent would travel to Cambodia
to have sex with children; and
 purchased an airline ticket to Cambodia for the dates that he and the
agents had discussed.
Arguing that these actions are only corroborative—indeed, “strongly
corroborative”—of Defendant’s intent to travel to Cambodia, Defendant contends
that they do not evince his intent to have sex with children while there.
But this argument appears ill-founded. Indeed, Defendant seems to argue
that none of it—not Defendant’s admitted history of sexual abuse of children in
Cambodia, not his recorded statements expressing his intent to travel to Cambodia
2 To constitute a substantial step, a defendant's “actions must cross the line between preparation

and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that the crime will take place unless interrupted by
independent circumstances.” United States v. Nelson, 66 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 1995) (internal
quotation marks omitted).

for the purpose of having sex with children, and not his purchase of a plane ticket to
Cambodia on the agreed-upon date—provides any insight into why he may have
been travelling to Cambodia. The United States respectfully disagrees and believes
that these actions provide a sufficient basis upon which a rational juror could both
discern Defendant’s intent and find a substantial step.
In any case, the matter should not be litigated pre-trial and should ultimately
be left to a jury who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence upon which Count 2
is based. Thus, the United States respectfully urges this Court to deny Defendant’s
Motion to Dismiss.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, October 21, 2014, in Anchorage, Alaska.
