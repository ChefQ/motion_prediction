Comes Now, Jason Jayavarman, by and through his attorney, Rex Lamont
Butler & Associates, Inc., and respectfully moves and petitions this Honorable Court
to dismiss Court II of the Superceding Indictment. This motion is based on the
following considerations:
Count II of the Superceding Indictment charges Jayavarman, commencing on
April 23, 2013, and ending on August 14, 2013, with attempting to travel in foreign
commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct. This Court should
dismiss Count II because Jayavarman did not make a substantial step towards
completing the alleged crime.

A undercover agent contacted Jayavarman on the pretext of wanting to go to
Cambodia to have sex with young girls.
The Government will attempt to establish that, during a series of conversations
with the undercover agent, Jayavarman: (1) Stated that he likes young and fresh girls;
(2) Referred to girls as young as 13; (3) Discussed how to have sex with virgins; (4)
Stated that, in Cambodia, he made a movie of himself and a young girl having sex;
(5) Stated that he has made films in the United States; (6) Instructed the undercover
agent on how to get child pornography from Cambodia to the United States; (7) Stated
that he knew someone who could get girls as young as 12 or 13 years of age; (8)
Stated that he knew the person who would deliver the child and that the person was
trustworthy; (9) Stated that should the need arise Cambodian police could be bribed;
(10) Discussed camera equipment that could be used in filming; (11) Stated that he
intended to join the agent in getting young girls; (12) Stated that he goes to Cambodia
to check on land he owns there; and (13) Told the agent that he was going to travel
to Cambodia during the same time period the agent intended to travel there. (Docket,
1).

According to the Government, Jayavarman admitted, during an interrogation,
to having sex with 13 and 14 year old girls in Cambodia. Jayavarman admitted to
having sex with a 14 year old commencing in 2009. He stated that this continued
during succeeding years and that the encounter was taped. The last encounter
occurred in 2011. Videos of the supposed encounters were brought back to Alaska.
(Docket 1).
According to the Government, Jayavarman has traveled to Cambodia 12 times
since 2009. On August 6, 2013, Jayavarman booked a flight to Cambodia with a
departure date of August 19, 2013. (Docket, 1). Multiple stops were contemplated,

full twenty days after the ticket was purchased.

Discussion

To be guilty of an attempt, a person must intend to commit a crime and take a
substantial step toward completing the commission of that crime. Braxton v. United
States, 500 U.S. 344, 349 (1991); U.S. v. Pariseau, 685 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.
2012). Merely preparing to commit a crime does not constitute a substantial step.
Buffington v. U.S., 815 F.2d 1292, 1301 (9th Cir. 1987). Rather, a substantial step
requires an act “that is strongly corroborative of the firmness of a defendant’s criminal
intent.” Buffington, 815 F.2d, at 1301.
In the instant case, even assuming arguendo, without so admitting, that
Jayavarman intended to travel internationally for the purpose of engaging in illicit sex

acts, it nevertheless remains true that the act of purchasing a ticket is not strongly
corroborative of the requisite intent. The purchase of an airline ticket is strongly
corroborative of only one thing— an intent to travel. The purchase of a ticket is not
corroborative of the underlying purpose of the contemplated travel. With respect to
the purpose of contemplated travel, the purchase of a ticket is a neutral act.
The purchase of a ticket was not even remotely corroborative of an intent to
travel for the purpose of illicit sex. Jayavarman had legitimate business in Cambodia.
He explained to the agent that he owned land in Cambodia that he intended to visit.
Given that fact, the purchase of the ticket was, at the worst, an ambiguous act. A
U.S. v. Jayavarman, Motion to Dismiss.

person’s ambiguous acts can not be said to be strongly corroborative of anything, let
alone the firmness of the person’s purpose or intent.
It may be noted that the contemplated flight was not direct to Cambodia. A
number of stops were planned. Planning to travel to Cambodia with numerous
intermediate stops before commencing the actual flight to Cambodia did not evidence
the firmness of Jayavarman’s intent or purpose. This is because a great amount of
time would have had to have elapsed before the actual flight to Cambodia would have
commenced. In this case, nearly three weeks would have had to have passed after
Jayavarman bought the ticket before the Cambodian flight would have commenced.
Even assuming arguendo that illicit sex was a purpose of the contemplated
travel, the fact that the flight was scheduled so far in advance evidences a tentativeness
of purpose, as opposed to a firmness of purpose. Such a situation is qualitatively
different from simply going to the airport, buying a ticket, and standing in line to
board an international flight. The greater the amount of time that must elapse between
an act (purchasing a ticket) and the commission of a crime (traveling internationally
for illicit sex), the less suggestive the act is of firmness of purpose. By way of

contrast, temporal propinquity between an act and the contemplated commission of a
crime suggests intent and purpose. Here, of course, the contemplated travel to
Cambodia would not occur until after almost three weeks had elapsed; and, the
contemplated travel would not occur until after Javavarman had made several
intermediate stops.
A substantial step requires that the defendant’s actions “must unequivocally
[demonstrate]

that the crime will take place unless interrupted by independent

circumstances.” United States v. Goetzke, 494 F.3rd 1231, 1237 (9th Cir. 2007),
quoting from United States v. Nelson, 66 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 1995).
U.S. v. Jayavarman, Motion to Dismiss.
Page 4

In light of the fact that Jayavarman purchased the ticket almost three weeks
prior to the departure date for Cambodia, and in light of the fact that he planned
several stops at different locations prior to boarding a plane for Cambodia, it can not
be said that at the crime would have taken place had there been no interruptions.
During the three-week waiting period Jayavarman could have changed his mind about
traveling to Cambodia. This is especially the case since Jayavarman’s itinerary
involved a whole week of travel.
In Goetzke, the defendant was charged with attempting to entice a minor. The
defendant argued that he was not guilty of an attempt since he, at no time, was in the
physical proximity of the minor. The Ninth Circuit, pointing out that the defendant
was charged with attempting to entice a minor and not with attempting to engage in
sexual activity with a minor, rejected the defendant’s position. Thus, in enticement
cases, travel or physical proximity, is not required in order for conduct to constitute
a substantial step.
Goetzke is inapposite. Jayavarman, unlike the defendant in Goetzke, is charged
in Count II with attempting to travel for the purpose of engaging in illicit sex.

Finally, it may be noted that Jayavarman’s statements to the agents are irrelevant
to establishing that he performed a substantial step. Whatever evidentiary value those
statements have with respect to establishing intent, if any, they have no evidentiary
value concerning the second criterion of an attempt crime— a substantial step. In that
regard, at least one court, even in a enticement case, was unwilling to consider the
defendant’s statements to the victim as a substantial step toward committing the
offense. See United States v. Gladish, 536 F.3d 646, 650 (7th Cir. 2008)(“Treating
speech (even obscene speech) as the ‘substantial step’ would abolish any requirement
of a substantial step.”).

Conclusion

Count II should be dismissed on the ground that Jayavarman did not take a
substantial step toward committing the crime of traveling for the purpose of engaging
in illicit sex.
