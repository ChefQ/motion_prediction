DEFENDANT, JACKSON COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD'S
RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Defendant, JACKSON COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD ("School Board"), by and through
undersigned counsel, pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(C)(1), hereby files this Response to Plaintiffs'
Motion for Reconsideration. In support of this Response, Defendant states as follows:

1. On July 29, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reconsideration Rule 11 Sanctions
("Motion") (doc. 86), wherein Plaintiffs request this Court reconsider its February 15, 2013
Order which granted Rule 11 sanctions against Plaintiffs (doc. 41). The basis for Plaintiffs'
request is that they have identified "Supplemental Authority" in the form of an Order entered by
the Honorable Stephen P. Mickle of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Florida, Tallahassee Division, on April 20, 2004. (doc. 86).

2. As set forth fully below, Plaintiffs have failed to state a sufficient basis for

reconsideration and, accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion must be denied.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Plaintiffs have failed to state whether their Motion is brought pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule
60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Importantly, however, Plaintiffs filed their Motion
more than twenty-eight (28) days after the entry of the Order from which they seek relief. (Docs.
86, 41.) Accordingly, in light of such failure and the timing with which the Motion was filed, it
must be construed as a Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment of Order. See Mahone v.
Ray, 326 F.3d 1176, n.1 (110x2122 Cir. 2003) (`Although Mahone did not specify whether his motion
for reconsideration was filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) or 60(b), we designate it as the latter
because it was not filed within 10! days of the judgment that it seeks to reopen."); Bessent v.
National Hous. P'ship, 2008 WL 1744925, *1 (N.D. Fla. April 11, 2008) ("Plaintiff's Motion for
Reconsideration does not state whether it is filed pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule 60... However, the
timing of the filing is instructive... Because the motion for reconsideration was filed more than
ten days after the order was issued and because Plaintiff has not specifically stated what
subsection of Rule 60 entitles her to relief, this Court will construe the motion for
reconsideration as a motion for relief from an order pursuant to Federal Civil Procedure Rule
60(b)."); Brown v. Spells, 2011 WL 4543905, *1 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 30, 2011) ("Thus, applying the
time-based method, if a motion is filed within twenty-eight days of judgment, the motion should
be analyzed under Rule 59 framework. If the motion is filed after the twenty-eight window has
passed, then Rule 60 should be applied.")

Rule 60(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, states that:

the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final
judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:

 

1 ""As of December 1, 2009, the time limit for filing under Rule 59(e) has been expanded from ten days to twenty-eight days. See
Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (2011). Thus, older cases that mention a ten-day deadline should be interpreted in light of the 2009
extension." Brown v. Spells, 2011 WL 4543905, n.1 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 30, 2011).
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 87 Filed 08/13/13 Page 3 of 5

(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;

(2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence,
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
under Rule 59(b);

(3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic),
misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;

(4) the judgment is void;

(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is
based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or
applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or

(6) any other reason that justifies relief.

Here, Plaintiffs have claimed that their request is based upon the existence of "Supplemental
Authority." (Doc. 86.) As the existence of "Supplement Authority" does not fall within any of
the first five (5) subsections of Rule 60(b), Plaintiffs' request must be one under Rule 60(b)(6),
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

"TRJelief under Rule 60(b)(6) is an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only
upon a showing of exceptional circumstances." Rease v. Harvey, 376 Fed.Appx. 920, 921 (11th
Cir. 2010); Bessent, 2008 WL 1744925 at *1; Gulf Power Co. v. Coalsales I, L.L.C., 2011 WL
3269412, *1 (N.D. Fla. July 29, 2011). Motions made under Rule 60(b)(6) must demonstrate
"that the circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant relief' Bessent, 2008 WL
1744925 at *2 (quoting Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 235 F.3d 1307, 1317 (11" Cir. 2000))
and "the party seeking relief has the burden of showing that absent such relief, an `extreme' and
`unexpected' hardship will result" Rease, 376 Fed.Appx. at 921. In sum, as the Honorable M.
Casey Rodgers of this Court has succinctly stated:

[While Rule 60(b) "give[s] the court the power to set aside a
judgment whose integrity is lacking ... [it] dofes/ not provide ... a
means for litigants to obtain the district court's reconsideration of
the claims and defenses its judgment adjudicated." Gonzalez v.
Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 366 F.3d 1253, 1294-95 (11th
Cir.2004) (emphasis in original). Thus, Rule 60(b) may not be used

to challenge mistakes of law that could have been raised on direct
appeal, see Rease v. Harvey, 376 Fed. Appx. 920, 921 (11th
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 87 Filed 08/13/13 Page 4 of 5

Cir.2010), or as " `a second opportunity for the losing party to
make its strongest case, to rehash arguments, or to dress up
arguments that previously failed,' " see Gonzalez, 366 F.3d at 1295
(quoting Kustom Signals, Inc. vy. Applied Concepts, Inc., 247
F.Supp.2d 1233, 1235 (D.Kan.2003)). Furthermore, "[i]t is well
established ... that relief under Rule 60(b)(6) `is an extraordinary
remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional
circumstances.' " Rease, 376 Fed. Appx. at 921 (quoting Griffin v.
Swim-Tech Corp., 722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir.1984)). "Under
[Rule 60(b)(6) ], `[t]he party seeking relief has the burden of
showing that absent such relief, an "extreme" and "unexpected"
hardship will result.' " Jd. (quoting Griffin, 722 F.2d at 680). In
other words, like Rule 59(e), "Rule 60(b)(6) should be only
sparingly used and may not be employed simply to rescue a litigant
from strategic choices that later turn out to be improvident."
Kramer y. Gates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C.Cir.2007) (internal
marks and citation omitted),

Gulf Power Co., 2011 WL 3269412 at *1 (internal footnote omitted). In addition, "{a] motion
for reconsideration should not be used as a vehicle to present authorities available at the time of
the first decision or to reiterate arguments previously made[.]" Z.K. Marine, Inc. v. M/V
Archigetis, 808 F.Supp. 1561, 1563 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 3, 1992). "Motions to reconsider under Rule
60(b)(g) are granted sparingly." Bessent, 2008 WL 1744925 at *2.

Here, Plaintiffs have failed to show the existence of any exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances entitling them to relief under Rule 60(b)(6), nor have they shown that, absent such
relief, an extreme or unexpected hardship will result. See Bessent, 2008 WL 1744925 at *2;
Rease, 376 Fed.Appx. at 921. Rather, Plaintiffs are attempting to utilize Rule 60(b)(6) to present
authorities which were available at the time the Order was initially entered, as well as reiterate
arguments previously made. This is an impermissible use of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion. See ZK.
Marine, Inc., 808 F.Supp. at 1563; Gulf Power Co., 2011 WL 3269412 at *1. Moreover,
Plaintiffs' Motion, despite being couched as a Motion for Reconsideration, clearly attempts to

challenge an alleged mistake of law which Plaintiffs previously attempted to raise on direct
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 87 Filed 08/13/13 Page 5 of 5

appeal. (Docs. 44, 61.) Such attempt is, likewise, an impermissible use of a Rule 60(b)(6)
motion. Rease, 376 Fed.Appx. at 921; Gulf Power Ce., 2011 WL 3269412 at *1.
As Plaintiffs' have neither stated a proper basis for relief under Rule 60(b)(6), Federal
Rules of Civil Procedures, nor made a showing sufficient to entitle them to relief under Rule
60(b)(6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs' Motion should be denied.
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court deny Plaintiffs' Motion
for Reconsideration.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 13" day of August, 2013.
