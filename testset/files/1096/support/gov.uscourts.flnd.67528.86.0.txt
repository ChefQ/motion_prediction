MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION RULE 11 SANCTIONS [Dkt. 41]

COMES NOW, Plaintiffs, and moves the court to reconsider its order granting
Rule 11 sanctions against them for filing this case in federal court. They do so on the
basis of Supplemental Authority ---- a case in which The Honorable Stephen Mickle
granted a preliminary injunction requiring a school district to implement a new Individual
Education Program (“IEP”) over the school district’s stay put objection in 20041. MP
2004 v. Leon County School Board, Dkt. 22, NDFL Case No. 4:04-cv-69 (2004)
(attached).
The case shows that courts do have authority to grant injunctive relief in cases
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, when the circumstances are
appropriate, and that stay put does not always and automatically trump the child’s needs
going forward. Since the Northern District of Florida has at least once issued injunctive

1

Plaintiffs’ counsel asks the court for reasonable accommodation to consider the
supplementary authority. The case was not a published one, but if counsel’s memory were not
impaired by her disabling condition, she might have recalled it specifically before recently.

relief in the stay put context of IDEA, granting a new IEP to a student, it cannot be either
unreasonable or frivolous for Plaintiffs to file its claims in federal district court in this
case seeking the same (and additional relief under other statutes).
Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the court reconsider and vacate its
order for Rule 11 sanctions [Dkt. 41].
Undersigned consulted with opposing counsel who opposes this motion.

ORDER
This cause comes before the Court on Plaintiff’s Motion for Emergency
Preliminary Injunction, or, Alternatively, Determination of the Stay Put Placement
(doc. 7) and Defendant’s response (doc. 14). Although the allegations made in
the complaint and motion for injunction raise many issues, all stem from a single
legal issue of whether the stay put provision1 of the IDEA2 prevents or excuses
Defendants from exercising the duty, under 6A-6.0334(2), Florida Administrative
Code, to place Plaintiff in appropriate educational programs consistent with the
Individual Education Plan (IEP) of the Orange County School District.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, MP, is an 18 year old exceptional education student who suffers
from emotional problems, language impairment, and learning disability. He has
been enrolled intermittently in the Leon County School District since 1996, and
has made little educational progress while there. Five legal proceedings,
including this one, have resulted.
First, in May 2001, MP through his parents requested a due process
hearing regarding the sufficiency of his IEPs. The dispute was settled at
mediation, without a hearing and without filing suit.
Second, on April 26, 2002, MP was arrested for possession of a controlled
substance while at school. The Leon County School Board suspended MP for
eight days and proposed a forty-five day interim alternative educational
placement for MP at the Second Chance School. MP’s existing IEP remained in
effect for the Second Chance School.
Because MP’s parents were not satisfied with the IEP and were not
satisfied with the Second Chance School as the interim alternative placement,
they enrolled MP in the Hope School, which is a private school. They also
requested a due process hearing as to whether the District was providing MP
with a free and appropriate public education as required under the IDEA.
On September 5, 2002, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ruled that
MP’s IEP and his alternative placement in the Second Chance School complied

with the IDEA’s requirements. The ALJ also ruled that the District was not
required to reimburse MP’s parents for private educational services. The ALJ
refused to hear other issues raised by MP’s parents regarding the sufficiency of
the IEPs from 1997 to 2002 and various non-IDEA claims; finding that the proper
scope of the hearing was limited to the disciplinary issues in accordance with 20
U.S.C. § 1415(k)3. All other issues, the ALJ ruled, should be addressed at a
separate hearing. MP filed suit in federal court for review of these rulings and
relief on other claims, which included all of the claims dismissed at the hearing
and additional claims concerning extended year services in 2002 and an IEP for
the 2002-2003 school year. The suit, MP One4, is still pending.
Third, in October 2002, MP’s parents requested a due process hearing
regarding the issues that were not addressed at the disciplinary hearing. The
ALJ ruled that she had no jurisdiction to enforce the parties’ mediation agreement
from 2001. Furthermore, because MP’s parents had since raised all other issues
in federal court through MP One and insisted that the issues remain before the
federal court, the ALJ dismissed the remaining claims. MP then filed suit in
federal court. This suit, MP Two5, is still pending.
Fourth, between June 2 and 23, 2003, MP was detained at the Leon

reasons, of a child with a disability and prescribes hearing procedures.

Regional Juvenile Detention Center. MP was enrolled in the Hope School at the
time, but during his period of detention he received schooling at the detention
center. The schooling provided was not pursuant to an IEP because the District
did not provide MP with an IEP at the beginning the 2003-2004 school year,
although MP’s parents requested an IEP in March 2003. After MP arrived at the
detention center, the district initiated the process for developing an IEP. MP was
released, however, before the IEP was developed.
MP’s parents requested a due process hearing regarding the 2003-2004
IEP. The ALJ ruled that MP was not entitled to an IEP during the 2003-2004
school year because MP was enrolled in a private school and receiving McKay
Scholarship funds6. MP filed suit in federal court. This suit, MP Three7, is still
pending and has been consolidated with MP One and MP Two.
Fifth, and finally, the instant case arises from MP’s transfer from the
Orange County School District to the Leon County School District on February 9,
2004. MP was living in Orange County from September 25, 2003 until February
2004. He moved to Orange County to receive trauma treatment and enrolled in
the public school system. The Orange County School District developed an IEP
for MP. MP’s parents were satisfied for the most part with the IEP and MP made

significant progress.
MP transferred to the Leon County School District when he moved back
home in February 2004. The District refused to adopt the IEP from Orange
County and insisted that MP’s IEP from April 2002 stay put. MP requested a due
process hearing. The ALJ dismissed MP’s claims on March 2, 2004 after finding
that it lacked jurisdiction to award injunctive relief to MP and that the issue of
MP’s stay-put IEP was a matter for the federal court to determine. MP then filed
this suit.
DISCUSSION
When an exceptional educational student with a current IEP transfers from
one Florida public school district to another, the receiving district is required to
place the student in appropriate educational programs consistent with the IEP.
Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334(2). If the receiving district chooses to review and
revise the IEP, it may do so in accordance with the general requirements for
diagnosing, evaluating, and assigning exceptional students. Id.; Fla. Admin.
Code R. 6A-6.0331. The regulations, however, do not allow the transferring
district to disregard the IEP.
The District in this case disregarded MP’s IEP from the Orange County
School District based the stay-put provision of the IDEA. A review of the
provision, however, reveals no impediment to implementing the IEP from Orange
County.

“[T]he purpose of the stay-put provision . . . is ‘to prevent school districts
from effecting unilateral change in a child’s educational program.’” Georgia State
Dep’t of Educ. v. Derrick C., 314 F.3d 545, 551 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Erickson
v. Albuquerque Pub. Schs., 199 F.3d 1116, 1121 (10th Cir. 1999).
It reads in relevant part:
. . . [D]uring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant
to this section, unless the State of local educational agency and the
parents otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current
educational placement of such child, or, if applying for initial
admission to a public school, shall, with the consent of the parents,
be placed in the public school program until all such proceedings
have been completed.
20 U.S.C. § 1415(j).
Nothing in the terms of the stay-put provision requires the District to keep
MP frozen in his 2002 IEP. Under its plain terms, the stay-put provision allows a
school district or the state, with the consent of the parents, to make changes to
MP’s IEP. Because MP’s parents have consented to the IEP developed by
Orange County, the stay-put provision does not prevent the District from fulfilling
its obligation under Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334(2) to place MP in programs
consistent with the IEP from Orange County.
In similar situations, courts have determined that the stay-put provision
does not prohibit school districts from making changes to an IEP when those
changes are requested by the parents and ordered by state hearing officers.

Commonwealth of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 372 (1985); Bd. of Educ. of Montgomery
County v. Brett Y., 959 F.Supp. 705, 708-713 (D. Md. 1997). There is no reason
to come to a different conclusion in this case simply because the required
change to the IEP is pursuant to a state administrative regulation as opposed to
an order from a hearing officer. Like an order from a hearing officer, a
administrative regulation requiring a change to an IEP is tantamount to an
agreement by the state to modify the IEP. To the extent the parents agree, the
IEP can be modified without conflicting with the stay-put provision.
Although the District complains that MP should not be allowed to
manipulate his IEP by transferring in and out of the District, there is no indication
that MP’s transfer to Orange County was for anything other than a legitimate
purpose to receive medical treatment. In any event, the District has not cited to
any provision that prevents MP’s transfers or that relieves it of the obligation to
implement the transfer IEP. Since MP’s parents consent, the District cannot rely
on the stay-put provision to absolve itself of the duty to accept the Orange
County IEP in accordance with the regulations governing transfer students.
MP has demonstrated an entitlement to preliminary injunctive relief given
the record currently before the Court. MP has shown probable success on the
merits regarding the IEP from Orange County. MP will suffer irreparable injury
from further delays in his education. The injury to MP outweighs any harm to the
District since the District is only being required to obey applicable regulations

which do not conflict with the stay-put provision. Implementing the Orange
County IEP will serve the public interest.
Given the limited progress MP made under previous IEPs in the District,
the passage of time since the 2002 IEP, and the progress MP has made since
then, the 2002 IEP at this point in time does not appear reasonably calculated to
provide educational benefit to MP8. The other matters that may be at issue for
preliminary injunctive relief will require further development of the record before
they can be determined by the Court. Based on the foregoing, it is
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:
1.

Plaintiff’s Motion for Emergency Preliminary Injunction, or,

Alternatively, Determination of the Stay Put Placement (doc. 7) is granted as
provided in this order.
2.

The District shall comply with its obligation under Florida

Administrative Code Rule 6A-6.0334(2) of placing MP in programs consistent
with the IEP from Orange County. No revisions to the IEP shall be made unless
agreed upon by MP’s parents after consultation in good faith.
DONE AND ORDERED this 20th day of April, 2004.
