Nature and Stage of Proceedings

Plaintiff AstraZeneca LP respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to

the motion of defendant TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc. to Exclude Certain Testimony by

Michael Rappeport.
Summary of Argument
1. By motion dated November 23, 2005, TAP seeks to exclude portions of

the testimony of Michael Rappeport, AstraZeneca's consumer survey expert, as reflected in
Sections I and Ill of his report. Dr. Rappeport critiqued two consumer surveys conducted for
TAP by Dr. Thomas Dupont, one designed to assess consumer response to AstraZeneca's 45-
second "Better is Better" television advertisement (the "TV Survey") and the other designed to

assess consumer response to a Better is Better internet ad (the "Internet Survey").

2, The criticisms advanced by Dr, Rappeport in Sections IT and III of his
report relate to whether the TV Survey addresses the relevant issue in the case. Dr. Dupont
concluded that subjects in the TV Survey who responded that the commercial was
communicating that AstraZeneca's NEXIUM(R) {esomeprazole magnesium) was superior to
TAP's PREVACID(R) (lansoprazole) for relieving symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux disease
did not recognize the superiority claim in the advertisement as applying only to healing erosions
in the esophagus ("erosive esophagitis" or "EE") and were therefore misled by the
advertisement. Dr. Rappeport opined, however, that a subject might have concluded that
Nexium is superior to Prevacid for relieving the symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux disease
precisely because it is superior for healing EE - that is, if Nexium and Prevacid were equivalent

in every way except that Nexium was proven better for healing EE, one might reasonably

DBO1:(933082.1 057159.1005
Case 1:04-cv-01332-KAJ Document105 ~ Filed 12/14/2005 Page 5of 14

conclude that Nexium is better for treating acid reflux disease, which causes EE. A subject
concluding that Nexium is better for treating acid reflux disease on that basis would not have
been misled. (Exh A, Rappeport Report at 4-7). Because Dr. Dupont did not ask any questions
designed to find out why a consumer may have thought Nexium was better, the studies are

"valueless as evidence that the commercial misleads." (/d. at 6).

a

3. In the course of rendering this opinion, Dr. Rappeport stated that this
alternate explanation was more reasonable than Dr. Dupont's assumption that people failed to
perceive the limitation to healing EE. (/d. at 5-6). He also provided his view of what consumers
understand concerning heartburn and acid reflux disease. Claiming that these opinions are
unfounded, TAP seeks to exclude Dr. Rappeport's entire testimony with respect to the failure of

the TV Survey to address the relevant issues in the case.

4. Neither of the opinions TAP challenges are necessary to Dr. Rappeport's
criticism and neither will be offered at trial. Specifically, Dr. Rappeport will not testify at trial as
to his view of consumer understanding of heartburn and acid reflux disease, but will simply
testify that Dr. Dupont's surveys failed to assess consumer understanding of heartburn and acid
reflux disease. Nor will he offer his belief that his alternative explanation for consumers'
responses was more reasonable than Dr. Dupont's assumption that consumers failed to perceive
the limitation to healing of moderate to severe EE. Indeed, Dr. Rappeport's report expressly
states that regardless of whose explanation was more reasonable, the TV Survey failed to provide
evidence that consumers were misled because it failed to exclude the alternative explanation.
(id. at 6). Accordingly, there is no basis to preclude Dr. Rappeport from testifying that the TV
Survey failed to answer the question whether or not consumers perceived the express limitation

in the commercial to healing of moderate to severe ER.

5. TAP also argues that Dr. Rappeport's alternate explanation is "contrary to
law" and, specifically to the "established rule that a pharmaceutical advertising claim that is true
with respect to a subset of patients becomes false when presented as an unqualified claim."
(Opening Br. at 4-5). TAP's position makes no sense because Dr. Rappeport's alternative
explanation is that the advertisement makes a qualified claim, consumers perceive the

qualification, and conclude that Nexium is better because of that qualification.

6. In any event, the only two cases TAP cites for the so-called "established
rule" do not support the proposition TAP asserts. In one, an advertiser claimed that consumers
could not buy a more potent pain reliever than its product (an equivalence claim, not a
superiority claim). Tests showed that a competitor's product was equal in most respects but
superior in one efficacy measure. Therefore, it was false for the advertiser to claim that no other
pain reliever was more potent. In the other case TAP cites, the appeals court affirmed the lower
court's holding that a superiority claim was false where studies failed to show superiority on

even one efficacy measure.

7. Finally, TAP asserts that Dr. Rappeport has made unfounded medical
assumptions. This assertion is a pure "straw man" as Dr. Rappeport has nowhere rendered the

medical opinions TAP claims he has offered.

In this action, TAP contends that AstraZeneca's Better is Better advertising is
false because it communicates the implied messages that AstraZeneca's Nexium is superior to
TAP's competing Prevacid for treating the symptoms of acid reflux disease, such as heartburn,

and for overall healing of EE, even though the advertising expressly states only that Nexium is

superior to Prevacid for healing moderate to severe EE. Nexium's superiority for healing
moderate to severe EE has been demonstrated in studies conducted both by AstraZeneca and by

TAP.

On December 20, 2004, the Court denied TAP's motion for a preliminary
injunction, holding that TAP failed to demonstrate that AstraZeneca's Better ads were literally
false. (Exh. B) (D.1. 42). Accordingly, TAP commissioned Dr. Dupont to conduct the TV

Survey and the Internet Survey.

AstraZeneca retained Dr. Rappeport to comment on Dr, Dupont's surveys. In
addition to certain methodological criticisms that are not the subject of this motion, Dr.
Rappeport concluded in Sections II and I] of his report that the TV Survey does not provide
probative evidence in this case because it failed to ascertain what respondents meant when they
said Nexium was better at healing the symptoms of acid reflux disease and thus failed to address
the relevant issues in the case. Specifically, Dr. Rappeport concluded that the TV Survey was

"essentially valueless as evidence that the commercial misleads," (Exh. A at 6).'

TAP now seeks to preclude Dr. Rappeport from testifying as to the opinions he
rendered in Section II, which relate to what Dr. Dupont needed to ascertain in his surveys to
address the issues raised by TAP in the case, and Section II, in which Dr. Rappeport applies

those principles to conclude that the TV Survey is valueless.

 

He also opined, in Section V of his report, that the Internet Survey offered little insight
"as to how people understand the material on the web page" (/d. at 22) but this opinion is
not the subject of TAP's motion.

Argument

Point |

DR. RAPPEPORT WILL NOT OFFER
UNSUBSTANTIATED OPINION TESTIMONY

A central premise of Dr. Rappeport's criticism of the TV Survey is that while Dr.
Dupont determined that a substantial portion of survey respondents perceived a message in
AstraZeneca's television advertising that Nexium is better than Prevacid for treatment or relief of
heartburn symptoms, he failed to understand what respondents meant by their answers. As Dr.
Rappeport put it, "Dupont implicitly assumes that, from the consumers' viewpoint, being better
at treating acid reflux disease and/or heartburn is distinct from being better at healing erosive
esophagitis." (Exh. A at 7). But a consumer might conclude that, if Nexium and Prevacid are
equal except that Nexium is better for healing EE, a condition caused by acid reflux disease,
Nexium is therefore better at treating acid reflux disease. Such a consumer would not have been
misled into believing that Nexium was proven better at treating all aspects of acid reflux disease.
since Dr. Dupont did nothing to determine what his survey subjects actually meant when they
answered that Nexium is better than Prevacid for treating acid reflux disease, Dr. Rappeport
concluded that "Dupont's survey questionnaire provides essentially no evidence relevant to the

key survey issues in this case.' (Exh. A at 8).

In the course of expressing this opinion, Dr. Rappeport also provided his personal
belief that his alternative explanation was more reasonable than Dr. Dupont's blanket assumption
that everyone who stated that Nexium offers superior symptom relief to Prevacid was misled,
Dr. Rappeport conceded that he had done nothing to test whether his belief was supported, and

AstraZeneca represents that this belief will not be part of his trial testimony. Excluding such

DBOL:1933082.1 057159.1005
Case 1:04-cv-01332-KAJ Document105 ~ Filed 12/14/2005 Page 9Qof 14

testimony, however, does not mean that Sections I and II of Dr. Rappeport's report should be
excluded in their entirety. Indeed, Dr. Rappeport expressly stated that even if one believed Dr.
Dupont's assumption was more likely to be correct than his own, "as long as there is some
reasonable chance" some consumers were responding for the reasons stated by Dr. Rappeport,
the "researcher has not successfully carried out his or her task (which is to be able to say with

some assurance how respondents, not researchers, interpret the survey questions)." (Exh. A at

6)?

Put another way, the relevant issue is not whether Dr. Rappeport's hypothesis
about what respondents meant is more reasonable or more likely than Dr. Dupont's, but whether
Dr. Dupent's survey excluded a reasonable explanation of what respondents meant by their
answers that would indicate they were not misled. As Dr. Dupont acknowledged, he did nothing
to address, let alone exclude, Dr. Rappeport's explanation. (Exh. D, Dupont Tr. at 36-37).
Accordingly, precluding Dr. Rappeport from providing his personal beliefs about whose
hypothesis is more reasonable does not in any way affect his ability to testify concerning the

other opinions in Sections I and II of his report.'

in his report, Dr. Rappeport also made a series of observations about consumer

understanding of heartburn and acid reflux disease. In so doing, he merely was illustrating that

 

; At his deposition in this case, Dr. Rappeport testified that "it really doesn't matter

whether I'm right or not. The necessity is to prove 'm wrong..." (Exh C., Rappeport
Tr. at 135).

In fact, the reasonableness of Dr. Rappeport's hypothesis is borne out by two survey
questionnaires (416 and 423) where the interviewers went beyond Dr. Dupont's
instructions and actually asked respondents why they believed Nexium was better for
relieving symptoms of acid reflux disease. In both instances, the respondents stated that
Nexium was better precisely because it is better for EE. (Exh. E).

Case 1:04-cv-01332-KAJ Document105 ~~ Filed 12/14/2005 Page 10 of 14

Dr. Dupont did nothing to assess consumer understanding of these conditions. Again,
AstraZeneca represents that Dr. Rappeport will not offer these opinions concerning consumer
understanding of heartburn or acid reflux disease at trial, but will simply testify that Dr. Dupont
failed to assess consumer understanding of heartburm and acid reflux disease and how they relate
to EE, a critical failure under the circumstances of this case. This is appropriate expert testimony

and does not warrant exclusion of the entirety of Sections IT and III of his report.

Point 2

DR. RAPPEPORT'S OPINIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW

TAP aiso seeks to exclude Dr. Rappeport's opinions on the ground that they are
"contrary to established false advertising law." (Opening Brief at 4). Thus, in its opening brief,
TAP relies on a supposed "established rule that a pharmaceutical advertising claim that is true
with respect to a subset of patients becomes false when presented as an unqualified claim." (fd.
at 5). TAP theorizes that Dr. Rappeport's opinion is contrary to law because he states that it is
reasonable for someone to conclude that because Nexium is better than Prevacid for EE, it is
better overall. But TAP's argument misstates Dr. Rappeport's opinion, which is that a consumer
might perceive a qualified claim that Nexium is better for EE and conclude that, ali other things
being equal, that Nexium's superiority for EE makes it superior for treating acid reflux disease,
which causes EE. Because Dr, Rappeport specifically hypothesized that consumers perceived a
qualified claim, TAP's asserted "established rule" concerning unqualified claims has no

application to his opinion.

In any event, the cases TAP cites do not begin to establish that a consumer is

misled if he or she believes that a qualified claim that a drug is superior for healing a symptom
