INTRODUCTION
Defendants agree with Plaintiff Carol Loeb Shloss (“Shloss”) that this Court’s May 30,

2
3

2007 Order addressed only one of the two issues that must be resolved in determining whether a

4

party is entitled to attorneys’ fees under the Copyright Act. The May 30 Order addressed only the

5

question of whether Shloss was the prevailing party, and did not reach the second and more

6

significant part of the test for awarding attorneys’ fees—whether the prevailing party is entitled to

7

fees under the Fogerty factors. Defendants thus do not oppose Shloss’s request for

8

“clarification.” Nonetheless, it is relevant to note—as Shloss herself admits—that she brought

9

her clarification motion only after her prolonged (but unsuccessful) effort these past four months

10

to utilize the Court’s admittedly incomplete ruling to extract a fee payment from Defendants.

11

Shloss continues her overreaching in her clarification motion. This Court’s May 30, 2007

12

Order is plainly limited to Shloss’s prevailing-party status and, as Shloss admits, does not address

13

the Fogerty factors. Yet Shloss claims, rather incredibly, that a ruling on the Fogerty factors “can

14

be inferred” from the Order. Motion at 2. It cannot. Moreover, when the Fogerty factors are

15

applied, it is clear that Shloss should not be awarded attorneys’ fees in this case. Enough is

16

enough. The Court should deny Shloss’s fee request and put this dispute to an end.

ARGUMENT
A.

19
20

DEFENDANTS AGREE THAT THIS COURT’S MAY 30, 2007 ORDER
DID NOT COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS OF WHETHER SHLOSS IS
ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS’ FEES

Defendants agree with Shloss that the fee issue has not been fully addressed by this Court.

21

The Court’s May 30, 2007 Order determined that Shloss is the “prevailing party” for purposes of

22

the Copyright Act.1 But the Order did not reach the second part of the fee inquiry—whether

23

Shloss, as the prevailing party, is entitled to fees. See 5/30/07 Order at 3 (identifying “prevailing

24

party” as the only “standard[]” at issue); id. at 3-4 (discussing only prevailing-party status). That

25

latter analysis is guided by the Fogerty factors, and the plain words of the Order show that it did

26

not address those factors: The Order neither cites Fogerty or its progeny, nor refers to the parties’

27
1

28

For purposes of this response, Defendants accept the Court’s ruling that Shloss is the
prevailing party. They nonetheless reserve their right to appeal that ruling.

earlier briefing on the Fogerty factors. See 5/30/07 Order (citing only the parties’ briefing on

2

prevailing-party status). Indeed, in directing this Court to that briefing (see Motion at 3), Shloss

3

acknowledges that this Court has yet to apply the Fogerty factors to this case.

WHEN THE FOGERTY FACTORS ARE APPLIED, SHLOSS IS NOT
ENTITLED TO A FEE AWARD

Shloss’s clarification motion was delayed for four months, notwithstanding her own

7

recognition that the May 30, 2007 Order lacked the proper Fogerty analysis, because she was

8

attempting to leverage that incomplete ruling into a fee payment from Defendants that they were

9

unwilling to pay, particularly in light of the minimal amount of work required for the actual

10

outcome that Shloss obtained.2 Indeed, Shloss admits that she filed her clarification motion only

11

after her fee demands remained unmet for four months. As she puts it, she filed her motion

12

because the parties’ “attempt[s] to agree on an amount for [attorneys’] fees” have been “without

13

success” these past several months. Motion at 2. In now seeking this Court’s involvement again,

14

Shloss highlights the parties’ considerable differences on a reasonable fee amount, if one were

15

awarded or if the parties were to settle the issue by agreement. See 17 U.S.C. § 505 (permitting

16

“a reasonable attorney’s fee” (emphasis added)). In light of these considerable differences, the

17

question of whether Shloss is entitled to fees under the Fogerty factors takes on a heightened

18

significance.

19

The question of whether to give Shloss a fee award at all rests within the reasoned

20

equitable discretion of this Court. See Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 534 (1994). In

21

exercising that discretion, and before awarding fees, the Court must keep in mind the Copyright

22

Act’s purpose of “promot[ing] creativity for the public good” (Jackson v. Axton, 25 F.3d 884, 890

23

(9th Cir. 1994)), and conclude that Shloss, as the prevailing party, is entitled to fees in light of the

24

various non-exclusive factors identified by the Supreme Court in Fogerty. The Fogerty factors

25

26
27
28

As explained further infra and in Defendants’ Opposition, Shloss’s counsel, which
provided their representation pro bono, expended significant unnecessary efforts during the
course of the litigation, such as filing multiple, lengthy complaints containing irrelevant
allegations; changing the material which Shloss wanted to use months after the initial complaint
was filed; and not specifying the material at issue until forced to do so in her opposition to
Defendants’ motion to dismiss.

address “the degree of success obtained, frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness of

2

both the legal and the factual arguments, [and] the need to advance considerations of

3

compensation and deterrence.” Fogerty, 510 U.S. at 535 n.19; see also Jackson, 25 F.3d at 890.

4

But a “prevailing party” is not automatically entitled to fees; indeed, as this Court itself has

5

recognized, it is at times appropriate for courts to deny fees outright to a party that “prevails” in

6

the underlying litigation. Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Int’l Serv. Ass’n, No. C 04-00371 JW, 2005 WL

7

2007932 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2005) (determining that party successfully opposing copyright-

8

infringement claims did not warrant attorneys’ fees where accuser’s claims were not objectively

9

unreasonable or frivolous and instead presented complex and novel issues that were diligently

10

litigated, and where neither party had an improper motivation in litigating the case). Such

11

rulings, denying fees to prevailing parties, are typically sustained by the federal courts of appeals.

12

See, e.g., Berkla v. Corel Corp., 302 F.3d 909, 923-24 (9th Cir. 2002); Action Tapes, Inc. v.

13

Mattson, 462 F.3d 1010, 1014 (8th Cir. 2006); Palladium Music, Inc. v. EatSleepMusic, Inc., 398

14

F.3d 1193, 1200-01 (10th Cir. 2005); Positive Black Talk, Inc. v. Cash Money Records, Inc., 394

15

F.3d 357, 381-82 (5th Cir. 2004); Medforms, Inc. v. Healthcare Mgmt. Solutions, Inc., 290 F.3d

16

98, 117 (2d Cir. 2002); Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int’l, Inc., 140 F.3d 70, 72-75 (1st Cir.

17

1998).

18

An analysis of the Fogerty factors as applied to this case demonstrates that Shloss is not

19

entitled to any amount of fees. As elaborated more fully in Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s

20

Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“Opposition” (attached as Exhibit A to

21

Declaration of Maria K. Nelson)), Shloss is not entitled to fees because:

22

•

Shloss did not obtain a meaningful victory in securing a settlement of claims
that Defendants had no intention of bringing against Shloss, and where
Shloss did not obtain any of the declarations or injunctions sought in her
complaint (see Opposition at 13-15);

•

Defendants asserted neither objectively unreasonable nor frivolous positions
but instead maintained positions supported by law; by contrast, Shloss’s
multiple laundry-list complaints, which failed to specify the material that
Shloss wanted to use, required both parties to expend additional—and
unnecessary—resources and fees that would not be recoverable in any fee
request (see Opposition at 15-17);

•

there is no need for, nor would there be a benefit from, awarding attorneys’
fees for deterrence or compensation purposes, because Defendants acted in
good faith in vigorously defending the copyrighted material at issue, and are
not “corporate behemoths” with deep pockets (Fogerty, 510 U.S. at 524) that
might warrant a fee award for deterrence or compensation purposes,
especially where Defendants have incurred their own attorneys’ fees in
litigating the necessary and unnecessary aspects of Shloss’s lawsuit (see
Opposition at 19-21).

Accordingly, no fee award is warranted.

10
11

Page 5 of 5

Defendants’ opposition to Shloss’s lawsuit was properly motivated in light of
Defendants’ legitimate interest in protecting the copyrighted material at issue,
and Shloss presented no evidence that Defendants took their positions in bad
faith or engaged in copyright misuse (see Opposition at 17-19); and

Document 90

In sum, Shloss should not be permitted a windfall, much less a windfall contrary to the
purposes of the Copyright Act and to the Fogerty analysis guiding a court’s discretion in

12
awarding fees under that Act. This case—consistent with the parties’ settlement of the case over
13

eight months ago—should finally conclude with the denial of Shloss’s request for attorneys’ fees.
III.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing and their Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Award of Attorneys’

Fees and Costs, Defendants respectfully request that, upon completion of the fee-award analysis
under the Fogerty factors, Shloss’s request for attorneys’ fees be denied.
