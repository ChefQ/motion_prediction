1

Introduction. During the time since the Court ruled that Plaintiff Carol Shloss should recover

2

her attorneys’ fees in this action, the parties have attempted to agree on an amount for such fees,

3

unfortunately without success. Before initiating the motions practice necessary to determine that

4

amount judicially, Plaintiff respectfully asks the Court to clarify in part the basis for the Court’s

5

Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion For Award Of Attorneys’ Fees And Costs dated May 30, 2007

6

(the “Order”).

7

Plaintiff seeks this clarification because, under governing law, an award of fees in a copyright

8

case lies within the District Court’s sound discretion, guided by certain factors articulated by the

9

United States Supreme Court in Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517 (1994), and thus often

10

referred to as the Fogerty factors. The Court’s earlier Order awarding Professor Shloss her fees

11

fully explored the issues surrounding why she should be considered the prevailing party for these

12

purposes. But the Order’s consideration of at least some of the Fogerty factors was more implicit

13

than explicit. Professor Shloss is concerned that Defendants will challenge the Court’s fee award on

14

appeal once proceedings are completed, and that Defendants will seize on the less explicit aspects of

15

the Court’s ruling to argue that the Court exercised its discretion improperly, or not at all. While she

16

believes that the reasons for the Court’s exercise of discretion can be inferred from the record and

17

the parties’ briefing, and regrets the need to bring this issue back before the Court, she respectfully

18

suggests that a supplemental order clarifying more explicitly the basis for the Court’s exercise of its

19

discretion according to the Fogerty factors will obviate any question the Defendants may seek to

20

raise before the Court of Appeals regarding the basis for the Court’s ruling.

21

The Court has the authority to clarify the bases for its prior Order.

The Order is

22

interlocutory, and therefore the Court has the inherent and plenary power to modify or clarify it at

23

any time before final judgment. See City of Los Angeles, Harbor Division v. Santa Monica

24

Baykeeper, 254 F.3d 882, 889 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b).

25

Clarification as requested will assist the parties and the Court of Appeals in the event

26

Defendants insist on appellate review. The case law makes clear that where an award of attorneys’

27

fees furthers the purposes of the Copyright Act, as the award in this case does, an order granting the

28

prevailing party’s fee request is appropriate. Because a fee award under section 505 of the Copyright

Act is not automatic, but rather within the District Court’s discretion, appellate courts often look to

2

the District Court’s analysis supporting its exercise of that discretion. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461

3

U.S. 424, 437 (1983) (stating it is important for a district court “to provide a concise but clear

4

explanation of its reasons for the fee award”). In particular, in addition to determining the prevailing

5

party, as the Court expressly did in the original Order, the District Court may wish its decision

6

awarding fees to reflect the reasons the award furthers the purposes of the Copyright Act. Fogerty,

7

510 U.S. at 534 n.19; Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 94 F.3d 553, 558 (9th Cir. 1996). In addition, the

8

Ninth Circuit has identified several other non-exclusive factors that District Courts may consider

9

when granting a fee award, including (1) the degree of success obtained, (2) frivolousness, (3)

10

motivation, (4) reasonableness of the losing party’s legal and factual arguments, and (5) the need to

11

advance considerations of compensation and deterrence. Wall Data Inc. v. Los Angeles County

12

Sheriff’s Department, 447 F.3d 769, 787 (9th Cir. 2006) (refusing to reverse district court’s fee

13

award where the district court had considered and weighed the appropriate factors).

14

More explicit application of these factors to the record may assist the parties and the

15

Magistrate Judge in the proceedings to determine the proper amount of fees to be awarded, as well

16

as the Court of Appeals should Defendants seek review.

17

No further briefing is necessary. The parties fully addressed the Fogerty factors in their

18

briefing on Plaintiff’s original motion for fees. See Declaration of Julie A. Ahrens in Support of

19

Motion for Clarification (“Ahrens Decl.”), Ex. A (Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities

20

in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, Docket No. 73, filed April 10, 2007,

21

at 12-19); Ahrens Decl., Ex. B (Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Award of

22

Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, Docket No. 78, filed May 14, 2007 at 13-21); and Ahrens Decl., Ex. C

23

(Plaintiff’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion For Award Of Attorneys’ Fees And

24

Costs, Docket No. 82, filed May 21, 2007, at 5-10). The Court thus was fully informed regarding the

25

relevant factors and how the record in this case weighed upon them, as is implicitly reflected in the

26

Court’s original Order. As the parties have already fully briefed the issue, no further briefing on the

27

question should be necessary.

28

Conclusion. Because further analysis from the Court regarding its reasons for awarding fees

here will help the parties as they proceed before the Magistrate Judge and in any future appeal,

Professor Shloss respectfully requests that the Court clarify its original Order by stating more

explicitly the respects in which, under Fogerty and its progeny, it considers its fee award to further

the purposes of the Copyright Act.
