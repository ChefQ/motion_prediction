DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFFS’ “MOTION CHALLENGING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE
DEFENDANT’S RESPONSES TO THE PLAINTIFFS’ REQUESTS FOR
ADMISSION OF FACT & MOTION TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF
REQUESTED DISCOVERY DOCUMENTS”

Defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”), files this Response in
Opposition to “Plaintiffs’ Motion Challenging the Sufficiency of the Defendant’s
Responses to the Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission of Fact & Motion to Compel
the Production of Requested Discovery Documents.” (Doc. 87). Defendant has
sufficiently responded to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission and Plaintiffs requests
for documents seeks the production of documents that are irrelevant to the two
remaining claims.

I. Introduction and Background
1.

Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint arises from a promissory note plaintiff

Cobrey Bennett executed in connection with a mortgage loan transaction on real
property located at 965 Summerfield Drive, Cumming, Georgia. The subject loan
in the amount of $284,900.00 was executed by Plaintiff Cobrey Bennett on
November 19, 2012. (See Am. Compl., Doc. 16, ¶ 5).
2.

On or about September 24, 2013, Plaintiffs, acting pro se, commenced

this action by filing a Complaint against Defendants in the Superior Court of
Forsyth County, Georgia, Case No. 13SC-1473-B. (See Compl. Doc. 1)
3.

On or about October 22, 2013, Defendant removed this action to the

United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Gainesville
Division, Civil Action No.: 2:13-cv-00234-WCO. (Doc. 1).
4.

On or about October, 28, 2013, Plaintiffs, acting pro se, filed an

amended complaint against Defendant. (Doc. 6).
5.

On December 10, 2013, Plaintiffs, acting pro se, filed and propounded

Requests for Admissions to Defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing. (See Doc. 17-1).
6.

On December 12, 2013, Ocwen filed Defendant’s Partial Motion to

Dismiss and a Memorandum in Support of the same for failure to state a claim upon
which relief could be granted. (Doc. No.19).

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 3 of 11

7.

On January 3, 2014, Defendant responded to Plaintiffs’ Requests for

Admission.
8.

On January 6, 2014, Plaintiffs served Defendant’s counsel with a

“Discovery Demand.” The “Discovery Demand” stated, verbatim, as follows:
The Plaintiffs in the a fore mentioned case formally demand, the
accounting books, financial books, and records of the alleged owners
of the Plaintiffs’ note? We demand not servicing records, but
affidavits of indebtedness to Ocwen.
When a borrower’s note is sold, the alleged note owner no longer owns
the note. Hence, they no longer have any beneficial rights in the note
to assign to anyone, including the servicing of the mortgage.
Ocwen’s authenticated accounting and financial records of being the
note owner, authenticated copies of servicing agreements and PSAs
showing Ocwen has the right and authority to service the loan and/or
foreclose; Also, authenticated document custody records showing
when the note was endorsed and came into Ocwen’s physical
possession. Finally the actual ‘original’ wet-ink promissory note and
all endorsements there after.
9.

Defendant served its Initial Disclosures pursuant to the Court’s

Scheduling Order and produced documents to Plaintiffs on January 13, 2014, which
included production of origination documents, account payment history, and
correspondence related to Plaintiffs’ purported Qualified Written Request and
account status.
10.

On February 5, 2014, Defendant responded to Plaintiffs’ “Discovery

Demand,” even though it was not properly described under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 4 of 11

11.

A Non-Final Report and Recommendation was entered on May 13,

2014, recommending dismissal of 12 of Plaintiffs’ 15 causes of action. (Doc. 60).
12.

An Order adopting the Report and Recommendation was entered on

August 12, 2014. (Doc 74). The only two remaining substantive claims in this
action are: (1) conversion and (2) violation of the Real Estate Settlement and
Procedures Act (RESPA). (Docs. 60 and 74).1
17.

Defendant provided a supplemental production of documents to

Plaintiffs on August 27, 2014.
II. Arguments and Authorities
Only two claims remain against Defendant, and Plaintiffs’ voluminous
requests are irrelevant to the claims made.

While the undersigned counsel

recognizes the general dictates of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 that Plaintiffs repeat over and
over, the Court retains broad discretion to determine relevancy and limit discovery.
See Aeritas, LLC v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 2013 WL 454452, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 7,
2013).

Now that the Court has appropriately whittled this case down from 15

claims to the remaining two causes of action for conversion and alleged violation
of RESPA, the only relevant documents relate to the payment history to show the
status of the account and how payments were applied, and then any
correspondence between the borrower and the servicer pertaining to RESPA.
Plaintiffs also have a “claim” for punitive damages (Count XVI in the Amended Complaint)
that is tied to the success of their conversion claim.

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 5 of 11

This is a simple case about payments and the loan account, and Plaintiffs are
not entitled, as they seek here, to an unfettered “fishing expedition” of extraneous,
irrelevant documents that have no impact on their claims.2 See Tyree v. Hartford
Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 2011 WL 4352006, at *2 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 15, 2011) (quoting
Crosby v. La. Health Serv. and Indemnity Co., 647 F.3d 258 (5th Cir. 2011) (“Rule
26(b) ‘has never been a license to engage in an unwieldy, burdensome, and
speculative fishing expedition’”); United States v. Lake County Bd. Of
Commissioners, 2006 WL 1660598, at *1 (N.D. Ind. June 7, 2006) (internal
citations omitted) (“[t]he relevancy requirement should not be misapplied so as to
allow fishing expeditions in discovery”).
A. Requests for Admission
Ocwen stands by its objections and responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for
Admission Nos. 3,3 5, 7, 8, 9,4 10, 12, and 15. Most of Plaintiffs’ Requests were
vague and confusingly worded as stated in the objections, and an examination of

2

Undersigned counsel denies Plaintiffs’ allegations that he has misrepresented anything. (Doc.
87, pp. 19-20). Plaintiff’s initial disclosures were not produced until late January 2014. (See
Doc. 37).
3

Defendant notes the Court’s determination that Plaintiffs’ purported serving of a subpoena on
Defendant was improper. (Minute Entry, October 17, 2014).
4

Plaintiffs’ Motion (Doc. 87, p. 6) misquotes Defendant’s objections and response to Requsest
for Admission No. 9. The actual response was “Ocwen objects to this request as it vaguely
refers to ‘Defendants,’ and refers to an ‘Ombudsman’ without further description or context.
Subject to and without waiving those objections, Ocwen admits that the subject statement was
sent and further states that the referenced statement from the Ombudsman email address speaks
for itself.”

5

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 6 of 11

the Defendant’s responses shows that Defendant did admit or deny each request as
best as could be expected subject to the objections. Further, now that this matter
only involves causes of action for conversion and alleged violation of RESPA,
most of the requests are completely irrelevant to the pending claims. Plaintiffs’
repeated assertion that “Ocwen did not make a request for a more direct question”
(Doc. 87, passim), is not required under the Federal Rules and is not the
responding parties’ burden.

Defendant appropriately objected to confusing or

irrelevant requests, and responded in good faith to the requests subject to the noted
objections.

Plaintiffs’ Motion pertaining to the responses to the Requests for

Admission should be denied.
B. Requests for Documents
1. Conversion Claim
Defendant has produced all relevant documents for a conversion claim.
Generally, there is no viable conversion claim for money, because while money
constitutes personal property, “it is intangible personalty that is fungible, as it
belongs to a class of property which cannot be differentiated by specific
identification unless there has been created a specific fund that has been set aside
from other money.” Reis v. Ralls, 250 Ga. 721, 723(1), 301 S.E.2d 40 (1983);
Branch v. Alliance Syndicate, 220 Ga.App. 561, 564(2), 469 S.E.2d 807 (1996). A
narrow exception exists when the allegedly converted money is shown to

6

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 7 of 11

compromise a specific, separate, identifiable fund. Grant v. Newsome, 201
Ga.App. 710(1), 411 S.E.2d 796 (1991); Taylor v. Powertel, Inc., 250 Ga. App.
356, 359, 551 S.E.2d 765, 769-70 (2001). In the case of mortgage payments, a
successful plaintiff must “isolate and present specific instances of the Defendants'
failure to credit payments and properly tie the facts to each element of the
conversion claims.” Hand v. ABN AMRO Mortgage Grp., Inc., 2013 WL 6383128
at *10 (S.D. Ga. Dec. 5, 2013).
Here, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant did not give
Plaintiffs proper credit for payments and charged improper fees. (See Doc. 16,
Am. Compl, ¶ ¶ 79-82).

The only documents that are relevant to Plaintiffs’

conversion claim are those that relate to the payment history to evaluate whether
any specific monies were not applied pursuant to the terms of the Note and
Security Deed. Defendant produced the payment history of the account (and
produced an updated payment history in August 2014) along with correspondence
from Ocwen reflecting that any previous fees were removed and that the account
was current, except for the fact that Plaintiffs stopped making any payments on the
loan from August 2013 to the present.
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel seeks documents that are completely irrelevant
to any conversion claim, likely based on internet propaganda. Requests related to
“accounting books, financial books, and records,” “affidavits of indebtedness”

7

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 8 of 11

(which does not even exist), and for the subject promissory note, or an
“authenticated document of custody records showing when the note was endorsed”
are simply not relevant to the claims pending.

Defendant’s counsel is in

possession of the original note in this matter, and will produce that original note for
the court’s review if requested, but there is no requirement to produce an original
note to the Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Tonea v. Bank of America, N.A., -- F.Supp.2d --,
2014 WL 1092348, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2014) (rejecting and dismissing
“produce the original promissory note” theory); Carr v. Bank of America, 2013
WL 8609735, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 24, 2014) (quoting Sellers v. Bank of America,
N.A., 2012 WL 1873005, at *7 (N.D. Ga. May 21, 2012)) (“Georgia law does not
require a lender to produce the original loan document even when the lender is
taking affirmative action such as commencing a foreclosure proceeding”); Roper
v. Bank of America, 2012 WL 1134805, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 4, 2012). Plaintiffs
repeatedly ask the Court “to deem that the Defendants, have no proof to show a
just claim, to the Plaintiff’s loan/property [sic]” (Doc. 87, passim) but copies of the
Note and Security Deed have both been produced.
Plaintiffs are in default under their loan obligations and are attempting to stir
up controversy by any means they can create.

The relevant documents for

Plaintiffs’ conversion claim relate to the payment history, which has been
produced.

Defendant should not be required to produce anything further as

8

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 9 of 11

Plaintiffs’ requests for extraneous documents are not reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence for any actual claim that the Plaintiffs have
pending as numerous cases have held. See Haase v. Countrywide Home Loans,
Inc., et al., 748 F.3d 624, 631 (5th Cir. 2014) (affirming denial of pro se plaintiff’s
motion to compel discovery against banking defendants as requests were
overbroad and not relevant and borrowers had been provided with copies of
essential documents needed to support their claim); Davis-Burton v. CitiMortgage,
Inc., 2013 WL 4327995, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 18, 2012) (denying pro se plaintiff’s
motion to compel documents that had no relevance to the issues in the case);
Johnson v. McLaughlin, 2014 WL 2480617, at *2 (M.D. Ga. June 3, 2014)
(denying pro se plaintiff’s motion to compel where document requests were
overbroad and plaintiff had not made any effort to clarify or limit scope).
2. RESPA Claim
Defendant has produced all relevant documents related to any alleged
RESPA claim. Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges violations of 12 U.S.C.
§ 2605(e) and (k). (See Doc. 16, Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 74-78). RESPA requires loan
servicers to respond to borrower’s servicing related any potential Qualified Written
Requests (QWR) and make appropriate corrections, conducting an investigation,
and “provid[ing] the borrower with a written explanation or clarification that
includes…information requested by the borrower or an explanation of why the

9

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 88 Filed 10/31/14 Page 10 of 11

information requested is unavailable or cannot be obtained by the servicer.” 12
U.S.C. § 2605(e)(2)(C).
Defendant has produced all correspondence related to the purported QWR
sent by Plaintiffs and the responses provided by Ocwen. Further, Defendant has
produced the payment history and correspondence described above that set out the
status of the account, with all fees waived. There is nothing further that can be
produced related to a RESPA claim.
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel is due to be denied. Defendant has sufficiently
responded to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission and has produced all relevant
documents related to the remaining two claims of conversion and RESPA.
Respectfully submitted this the 31st day of October, 2014.
