INTRODUCTION
On Decernber 13, 2013, in an effort to narrow the issues in dispute bef'ore the Court,
the Plaintiffs sent Ocwen, a Requests forAdmission of Facts. On or about January 3,
2014, Ocwen, submitted re$ponses to those requests. Many of ths responses are
inadequate because Ocwen's counsel KeithAnderson failed to admit or deny the request,
made baseless objections, claimed that it was irrelevant to admit or deny the request

while simultaneously providing

a

partial answer that did not fairly meet the substance of

the request, and otherwise provided answers that were non-responsive.
Because Ocwen's, responses are insuffi.cient, inadequate, confusing,

ffid fail to

comply with FRCP 26, the Plaintiffs are entitled to a more accurate and complete
response to the requests listed below. In the alteraative, the Plaintiffs request that this

Honorable Court order that each matter of which Plaintiffhas made a Request for

Admission & Production of evidence is deemed admitted.

TrrE REQ{'ESTS TTTATARS TIIA SUBJECT OF TrIrS MOTION
Request No. 3: Admit that the Defendants received a subpoena on09/26/13 which was

proper$ served via GA law for a request of records of which the Defendants did not
comply in a timely manner.
Response No. 3: Ocwen, denies tbat it received a properly served subpoena under GA

law & denies that it did not in comply with any properly served subpoena. Ocwen,
further states that this matter is in a federal court and governed by the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure.
Basis for Motion fo Compel: Pursuant to FRCP 26 permits only three possible
responses to this request

l)

admit, 2) deny, and 3) Defendant is unable to admit or deny.

Ocwen's response that they denied receiving a properly served subpoena as well

as

denying their failure to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena is untrue. There is
evidence to support that Ocwen's reply is untrue. Ocwen's reply shows the Court that

they have no good faith basis to deny the request. Coupled with evidence of receipt

of

the subpoena and acknowledgment of it by Ocwen's defense, it is apparent that the only

good faith response available to Ocwen is to o'admit." Plaintiffis asking this Court to
deem the request admitted.

Request No. 5: Admit the Defendants stated *Ocwen has multiple sites and servicing
centers serving different portfolios of loans. Your loan recently transitioned from our

Ocwen servicing center in Orlando, FL to our servicing center in Waterloo, Iowa. The

monthly payments were being processed at our FL ofiice and later forwarded to the
Waterloo, Iowa office which made it appear as if your account was delinquent"o yet did
nothing to correct it or stop the constant calls and misinformation sent to the Plaintiffs.
Respqnre No. 5: Ocwen objects to this request as vague and ambiguous as it provides
no context for the alleged statement. Subject to and without waivrng those objections,
Ocwen states that any document speaks for itself and denies that it "did nothing" to
correct inadvertent actions taken.

this Court to deem the request admitted.

&au4 including but not limited to Sealy Davis v Ocwen 04-CV-1469, a wrongful

disclosures.

know if any of the companies have any legal claim to their loan/ and or their property
and excuse for not taking their word on these matters. Due to the constant unfuths by
the Defendants, and the Defendant's lack of actual evidence other than their word to

prove otherwise, the Plaintiffs are asking this Court to deem, that Ocwen does not have
any legal claim to their loan or property. The Defendants, must also make available for

inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material,
unless privileged or protected from disclosure.

but it is not relevant or related to the claims made in this action.
Basis for Motion to Compel: The rules allow us to discover any fact "reasoaably

Request No. 4: Ocwen's authenticated accountiag and financial records of being the
note owner, authenticated copies of servicing agreements and PSAs showing Ocwen has
the right and authority to service the loan and/or foreclose.

Response: Ocwen objects to this request as v&gue, ambiguous, and irrelevant to the
claims made. The claims pending have nothing to do with the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, ffid Plaintiffs have been informed that Ocwen is the loan servicer.
Basis for Motion to Compel: The rules allow us to discover any fact "reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence". Quoting directly from Rule
26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Also, because the Defendants, have told the

Plaintiffs on several different occasions, that someone other than themselves serviced

their loan or property.
Request No. 5: Authenticated document of custody records showing when the note was
endorsed and came into Ocwen's physical possession.

Response: Ocwen objects to this request as vague, ambiguous, and irrelevant to the
claims made, as there is no obligation for the lender or servicer to produce the
promissory aote. See Roper v. Bank of Americ a,2012 WL 1 134805, at *2 (N.D. Ga.

Apr. 4 2012); Watkins v. Beneficial, HSBC Mortg.o 2010 WL 4318898, at *1 (N.D. Ga.

May 14, 2009). Further, there would be no such "authenticated document" of this nature
would exist.

property. Plaintiffs are asking this Court to deem, that Ocwen does not have any legal

claim to their loan or property.
Request No. 6: The Plaintiffs request the actual ooorginal" wet-ink promissory note and

all endorsements there after.
Response: Ocwen objects to this request as production of the original or "wet ink" note
is not required under Georgia

law

Basis for Motion to Compel: Because the Defendaat's have repeatedly failed to
disclose the requested information, the Plaintiffs request the Court to deem that the
Defendants, have no proof to show

a

the constant untruths by the Defendantsn and the Defendant's lack of actual evidence,

other than their word to prove otherwise, the Plaintiffs are asking this court to deem, that
Ocwen does not have any legal claim to their loan or property.
Because, the Defendants, have constantly violated, the Plaintiffs Civil Rights and

intemrpted the enjoyment of their home due to tlese violations, as well as the fact that
the Defendants, have been observed by an government entity, committing the same

violations to millions of other customers of said Defendants, as well as false paperwork
and perjury the Defendants shouldn't be permitted to offer any opinions or testimony at

trial in this lawsuit. The Plaintiffs should not be submitted to any further victimizing by
the Defendants. The Court should order that this request is deemed admitted.

OFANSWERS TO REQUESTS TO

AI}MIT

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Cobrey & Maryam Bennett filed this action to recover damages caused
by
defendants (Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC) Defendants have answered
the complaint with

various denials, objections, & untruths.
First, the Plaintiffs requested a producfion of evidence via a subpoena
0n September

30ft of 2013 which the defendants have yet to comply with.
Second, On December 10, 2013, the Plaintiffs served a request
of admissions on the

Defendants. The request sougbt admission of facts related to the conrplaint.
Ocwens
counsel served the responses to the requests to admit on January
3,2014.The answers

were insufficient and do not comply with Rule 36(a)a of the federal rules
of civil
procedure.

According to Fed. R. cil. Pro. 36(a) 4 Awwer If a mafter is not admitted,
the answer

t]

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 87 Filed 10/17/14 Page 18 of 36

must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully
admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when
good faith requires that a parly qualiff an aflswer or deny only a part of a matter, the
answer must speci$ the part admitted and qualifr or deny the rest. The answering party

may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny

only if the parfy states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the informatioa

it

knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.

Keith Anderson has not responded to Plaintiffs' attempt to obtain to meet and confer
regarding the responses and has just overall avoided the Plaintiffs altogether. The

Plaintiffs even in good faith warned the Defendants, they had proof that MrAnderson,
had lied on the court record to give him a chance to amead the matter to no
avail.

AccordinglS plaintiffs respectfirlly requests that the Court determine that the responses
are insufficient and move the court to Determine Sufticiency of Defendant's
Answers

and objections; For Enfiy of order that the Matter is Admitted:

Also the Plaintiffs, after purchasing a chain of title which was submitted to the
Court
shows that Mortgage Servicing LLC is the only company that had a title to
our home.
The allonge that shows Allquest, purchased the title is not mentioned which
makes

it

false. Nor is Ocwen listed anywhere in the title chain.

Due to this the Plaintiffs have sent Ocwen andAllquest subpoenas for
the production

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 87 Filed 10/17/14 Page 19 of 36

of the accounting books, financial books, and records cf the alleged owners of the

Plaintiffs'note, affidavits of indebtedness to Ocweno authenticated accounting and
financial records of being the note owner, authenticated copies of servicing agreements
and PSAs showing Ocwea has the right and authority to seryice the loan and/or

foreclose, authenticated document cf custody records showing when the note was
endorsed and came into Ocwen's physical possession,

& the actual "orginal" wet-ink

promissory note and all endorsements there after.

BACKGROUND

l. Plaintiffs

have in good faith conferred and attempted to confer with the Defendant's

counsel, in an effo* to secure disclosue without court action.
2. The Plaintiffs, who requested discovery and filed Request forAdmissions,
move the

Court, to determine the sufficiency of the answer and objections and
for enfiy of the
appropriate orders concerning production.

3' Unless the Court determines than an objection is justified, it shall
order that an answer
be served;

If the Court determines that an answer

does not comply with the requirements

of the rule, enter an order that the matter is admitted.

FACTUALALLEGATIONS

z, Mr Anderson also lied In his response to the request for admissions. In Response
No. 3, Mr Anderson states, "Oc\ryen denies that it received a properly served
subpoena under GA law, and denies that

it did not comply with any properly

served subpoena. Ocwen further states that this matter is in federal court and
governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." The Plaintiffs' complaint was

filed in state court. The subpoena was purchased, issued, and sent to Ocwen on
September 30, 2013. The Defense did not move the case to federal court until
10/22/13.

As part of Ocwen's consent agreement, they must ensure that facts asserted in its
documents about borrowers'loans used are accurate and supported by reliable

evidence' The Plaintiffs asked the defense for Ocwen's accounting books,

financial books, and any records of sale/loss of the alleged owners of the

Plaintiffs'note holder. The Defense objected to this request as completely
irrelevant. The Plaintiffs disagrees. Ocwen's defense claimed they had no,

fiduciary dufy to the Plaintiffs. when the ptaintiffs

staterd

ocwen, had not loaned

them any money the defense stated they issued credit. The plaintiffs feel it is
well

within their right to request proof of the defense's claims of ownership of their
properly' because much like the defense's clients, the defense is giving
confticting
and confusing information regarding the ownership of the plaintiffs'loan.

4'

During discovery facts you seek do NOT have to be "admissible,, in court ... sa
long as they are "reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible

20

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 87 Filed 10/17/14 Page 21 of 36

evidence". Quoting directly from Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

(conholling in all federal courts and generally followed by all state courts)
"Relwant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence."
Due process includes our right to discovery and our right to discovery is NOT

limited to "admissible evidence". The defendant is refusing to accept any
responsibility, even for painfully obvious facts that anyone reasonable would
concede.

5'

The Plaintiffs, sent Ocwen a request for production of said documents
in January,
and the only thing we have gotten is more copies of the servicing
records, and

objections ts the request, "stating objections for being irrelevant." The
objections,
are not inline with any of the FRCP regarding discovery.

ARGTJMENT
A. APPLICABLE STANDARI)
"Admissions are sought first to facilitate proof with respect to
issues that cannot be
eliminated from &e case and, secondly to narrow the issues
by eliminating those that
can be' An admission on a rnatter of opinion may facilitate
proof or narrow the issues

or both." olszewski

v

new Britain General Hosp., 2000

wL 23471g

{February 3, 2000)

(Gaftey, J') Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(a)(6) requires that
answers to requests
to admit "shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail
the reason why &e
answering party caunot truthfutly admit or deny

2l

tle

matter. A denial shall fairly meet the

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 87 Filed 10/17/14 Page 22 of 36

substance of the requested admission,

ffid when good faith requires that aparty qualify

his or her answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested,
such party shall speciff so much of it as is true and

qualiff or deny the remainder. An

answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reasol for failure to
admit or deny unless such parly states that he or she has made a reasonable inquiry and
that the information known or readily obtainable by him or her is insufficient to enable
an admission or denial."

Where a pat$ has answered or objected to a request for admission, Allows the
requesting patry to seek

a

judicial determination of the sufficiency of the ansvrer or

objection; Hightower v. Walgreen Eastern Co., Inc.o 2000 WL 1434054 (Conn.Super.
September I5, 2000). The court may reject unjustified objections and order answers,
and

determine that, as to answers deemed non-complianl either the matier be deemed
admitted or an amended answer be served.

B. THE COURT SHOI,'LD REQUIRE OCWEN TO PRO\rIDE AMENDED
RESPONSNS TO TTilA PLAINTIFFS FIRST REQUAST FORADMISSIONS

l. Failure ofresponses

to "meet the zubstance ofthe requested admission" and to specify

the portions of the requested admissions that are true.
The responses to requests to admit nos.

l, 2,3,4,5, z, 8, g,12,13, &

15, fail to comply

with FRCP 26, which requires that "A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the
requested admissionn

ild

when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 87 Filed 10/17/14 Page 23 of 36

deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, such party shall
specifu so much of it as is true and quali$ or deny the remaindet'' as follows:
Responses: 1,2,3, 4, 5,7

,8,9, lz,

r?.,

&

15 of the plaintiffs' requests to admit. ocwen

objects to the requests as vauge and ambiguous and then admits to the requested

information
Deficiency: ocwen admits it called the Plaintiffs multiple times ovsr the course

of

several months but only after he objected on the wording. The Defense playing
is
word
games' Plaintiffs meaning coupled with the evidence has given
the Defendants more
than enough information to properly admit or deny the requested
admissions. By

crediting disingenuous, hair-splitting distinctions whose unarticulated goal
is to unfairly
burden the opposing party,"Thalheim v. Eberhe im,124.F.R.D.
34,35 (D. coan. lgss)

B. THE COURT SIIOULD REQUIRB OCWEN TO SBR\IEAMEI\IDED
RESPONSES TO THE SECOND SST OF DISCOVERY I}EMANDS.
ocwen's responses to second set of discovery demands, responses
, r,2,&4*6 do not
comply with 34(a)(lXA&B), The Plaintiffs requested all
the accounting, financial and
record books of the atleged owners of the Plaintiffs'note,
Affidavits of indebtedness to
Ocwen, Ocwen's authenticated accounfing and financial records
of being the note owner

& authenticated copies of servicing agreements

and PSAs showing ocwen has the right

and authority to service our loan, Authenticated documents
of custody records showing

when the note was endorsed and came into ocwen's physical possession,
the wet ink

23

Case 2:13-cv-00243-WCO Document 87 Filed 10/17/14 Page 24 of 36

promissory note and all endorsements there after. Ocwen did not give the Plaintiffs any

of these requested items, and they still have not given the Plaintiffs the calls requested in
the subpoena.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffrespectfutly requests that the Court determine
that Ocwen's answers to the requests for admission identified & the failure to produce
requested discovery herein are insufficiento and order the Defendants to serve amended
answers and force Ocwen to comply with the discovery demand and give the plaintiffs
the requested documents. The Plaintiffs would also like the court to have the Defense

give us proof of sale and loss regarding their loan. Or in the alternative have the Court to
add thE admissions as admitted, and the failure to comply with the production

of

evidence as proof that the Defendants, have no legal claims to either the Plaintiffs'loan
or property
