16

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits this

17 Motion For Extension Of Time To File Reply To Government's Response To Defendant's
18 Motion To Suppress. Through this motion, the defendant respectfully requests that the Court
19 set a deadline of October 20, 2012 for the filing of the defendant's reply to the government's
20 response (Dkt. #873).
21

The government filed its response to the defendant's Motion To Suppress on August

22 20, 2012. The government then mailed the defendant a copy of the response on August 21,
23 2012. The defendant received the response on the night of August 23, 2012. The defendant
24 was only able to skim through the government's response prior to drafting this motion for
25 extension of time.[1] Through his skimming, the defendant noticed various cases that he

picking it up on August 26, 2012 with special arrangements made with CCA-CADC for the
28 defendant to bring him a digital copy on a Sunday—a day CCA-CADC refuses to allow the
defendant to use the defense laptop computer..

1 does not have access to and the government failed to provide the defendant with courtesy
2 copies of its cited cases that may not be readily available. Some of the noted cases were
3 unpublished cases and, unless the case was cited in the defendant's original Motion To
4 Suppress, the defendant does not have access to it. Additionally, as a general matter, the
5 defendant does not have access to any case newer than March of 2012—whether published
6 or not—due to CCA-CADC's failure to update its legal research computers. By providing
7 the defendant two months to reply, he will have time to obtain copies of cases cited in the
8 government's response through various—yet to be determined—means.

The defendant is currently in pretrial detention and has limited access to the outside

10 world. The defendant does not have a paralegal or a private investigator to assist him. He
11 currently only has a court-appointed shadow counsel, Philip Seplow,[2] to assist with the
12 preparation of his reply and other defense matters. However, the defendant typically only
13 sees Mr. Seplow at CCA-CADC once every one to two weeks. By providing the defendant
14 two months to reply, he will be able to exchange data to/from the defense laptop computer
15 (when Mr. Seplow visits CCA-CADC to see other clients) an adequate number of times prior
16 to the deadline to have the reply filed.
17

The government's response is 67 pages and, even with just the noted skimming, the

18 defendant noticed certain sections that will require placing additional evidence on the record
19 in order to show the incorrectness/irrelevancy of certain government arguments. By
20 providing the defendant two months to reply, he will have the time to assemble the needed
21 evidence and put it into context.
22

The defendant currently has a pending discovery request and proposed motion to

23 compel discovery (stemming from new evidence) that have not been addressed by the Court
24 or the government. The requested discovery is extremely relevant to the defendant's fishing
25 expedition / exploratory rummaging argument with respect to the search of seized data

assistance. However, Mr. Colmerauer is far too busy with Mr. Seplow's ordinary clients to
28 assist the defendant with the totality of the legal research, document retrieval, and other
matters relating to preparation of the defendant's reply.

1 storage devices. By providing the defendant two months to reply, the pending discovery
2 issue will have time to resolve.
3

If the Court decides that the defendant needs to back up his factual claims with an

4 expert, the defendant will need more than two months to reply to the government's response.
5

Based on the points and authorities set forth herein, the defendant respectfully

6 requests that this motion be granted and the proposed order be issued.

This motion and all attachments were drafted and prepared by the pro se defendant,

9 attachments on his behalf using the ECF system. The defendant is appearing pro se and has
10 never attended law school. The defendant's filings, however inartfully pleaded, must be
11 liberally construed and held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by
12 lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).

LRCrim 12.2(a) requires that the undersigned include the following statement in all

14 motions: “Excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(D) will occur as a result of this
15 motion or of an order based thereon.”
