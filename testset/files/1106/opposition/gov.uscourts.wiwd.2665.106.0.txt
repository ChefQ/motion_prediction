Case No. 99-cv-475-bbc

Plaintiff’s Corrected Response in Opposition to Owens-Illinois, Inc.’s
Motion for Summary Judgment

Plaintiff opposes Defendant Owens-Illinois’s (“OI”) motion for summary judgment.
Evidence and Procedural History
On September 2, 1997, Plaintiff Delores Suoja, the wife of Oswald Suoja, filed an action
in Dane County Circuit Court for injuries to Oswald Suoja from mesothelioma. (Ex.1 at ¶¶4-5,
11.) Delores Suoja pursued the Dane County action “Individually and as Special Administrator
of the Estate of Oscar Suoja, Deceased.” (Ex 1 at 6.) OI was not a named in pleadings as a
defendant in the Dane County. (Ex.1 at 5-6.) The reason OI was not a named defendant was the
existence of a written agreement between OI and clients of Cascino Vaughan Law Offices to
attempt settlement before filing lawsuits. (McCoy declaration at ¶6; Plaintiff’s Additional
Proposed Findings of Fact [hereafter cited as Pl PFF] 1.) Pursuant to the terms of the agreement,
OI counsel would be notified by CVLO about the existence of the claim and settlement would be
attempted before a CVLO client initiated a lawsuit against OI. (McCoy declaration at ¶¶5-6; Pl

1

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 2 of 12

PFF 2.) Negotiations about the Suoja claim with OI were attempted in the 1997-99 period, but
were unsuccessful as set forth below. (Ex 2, ¶¶5-7; Pl PFF 3.)
As pointed out in OI’s proposed findings of facts, OI was referred to in the Dane County
complaint in two ways. First, as an unnamed coconspirator as part of the conspiracy allegations
and, second, in allegations against defendant Owens Corning Fiberglas as the manufacturer of
Kaylo insulation products distributed by Owens Corning. (Ex 1 at ¶¶35, 51, 73 of the
complaint, OI PFF 18-19.) Attorney Jill Rakauksi, who at the time was employed by Cascino
Vaughan Law Offices (CVLO), handled most of the work on the Dane County case. (Ex. 20, and
McCoy declaration at ¶ 4; Pl PFF 4.)
During discovery in the Dane County action, OI’s products also were mentioned when
Delores Suoja was served requests to admit Oswald Suoja’s exposures to certain products by
defendant Sprinkmann Sons Corporation, an insulation contractor. (Ex.14 at ¶¶41-42, OI PFF
26.) On January 25, 1999, Plaintiff responded she “cannot admit or deny inhalation” of asbestos
fibers attributable to OI. (Ex.14 at ¶¶41-42, OI PFF 26.) The claim against Sprinkmann in the
Dane county case was resolved by a negotiated dollar settlement, and resolution of product
exposure issues involving the Sprinkmann claims became unnecessary and did not occur.
(McCoy declaration at ¶9; Pl PFF 5.) Based on the settlement agreement, the claim against
Sprinkmann was dismissed “on the merits.” (See Doc # 92, OI ex 21.)
The claim against Owens Corning was also resolved after filing the lawsuit by a
settlement agreement. (McCoy declaration at ¶ 10; Pl PFF 6.) No resolution of the exposure
issues as to Owens Corning products occurred or was needed for the settlement. (McCoy
declaration at ¶11; Pl PFF 5- 6.)

2

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 3 of 12

On July 12, 1999, Plaintiff filed a motion to add OI as a named defendant to the Dane
County action based on the inability to negotiate settlement with OI. (Ex 2, ¶¶5-7.) The motion
was untimely filed after the scheduling order deadline of July 22, 1998, for amending pleadings
in Dane County. (Doc # 92, OI ex 22.) On October 19, 1999, attorney Rakauski wrote a letter to
the Dane County court advising the case had been fully resolved as to the named defendants.
(Ex 4.) The motion to add OI as a defendant was heard four days later on July 23, 1999. (Ex 3.)
The untimely motion to add OI, although not opposed, was denied by the court. (Ex. 3; Doc # 92,
OI ex 41.)
Following the denial of the motion to add OI as a defendant, the Dane County court
continued to enter additional dismissals of defendants. (Ex 20.) The last entry on the Wisconsin
computer docketing system for the Dane County case was a dismissal entered on December 6,
1999. (Ex 20.) OI cites no dismissal or other order in the Dane County action which had
findings involving OI or exposure to OI products, and OI was not a party at any time to the Dane
County case (Pl PFF 7.)
On October 9, 1999, Delores Suoja filed the instant action (the federal action) within less
than 3 months after the motion to add OI as a defendant in the Dane County action was denied.
Delores Suoja filed the federal action “individually and as special administrator for the estate of
Oswald F. Suoja” in the Western District of Wisconsin against OI as the only defendant. (Doc #
2 at 1.) The federal action was filed before the last dismissal of the Dane County action.
The federal case was transferred to asbestos litigation MDL-875 supervised by District
Judge Eduardo Robreno in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On March 25, 2009, an order
was entered by Judge Robreno appointing Gary Suoja “Special Administrator solely for the
purposes of pursuing the above lawsuit” and amending the complaint “on its face substituting

3

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 4 of 12

Gary Suoja, individually and as special administrator for the estate of Oswald F Suoja, as
plaintiff herein.” (Ex.6.) OI did not object to the motion, Gary being the special administrator, or
amending the case to name him as Plaintiff. (Ex.7 at 3.) Other than the appointment of Gary
Suoja as special administrator, no proceedings specific to the federal action occurred until Judge
Robreno entered a scheduling order on April 12, 2012, which included deadlines through and
including the dispositive motion stage. (Doc # 3; Ex.5 at 1-3.)
During pendency of the case in MDL-875, discovery proceeded including the depositions
of two coworkers of Oswald Suoja, George Schlub and Lawrence Zimmer taken in early 2012.
(Ex.8; Ex.9; Pl PFF 8.) The depositions contained testimony about Oswald’s exposure to Kaylo
brand pipe and block insulation from before 1959 at Badger Ordnance jobsite, which is the
period when OI was a manufacturer of Kaylo. (Ex.8 at 11-25; Ex.9 at 25-27; Ex.10 at 54; Ex.11
at Answer to No. 22; Pl PFF 9.) Additionally, Plaintiff disclosed during discovery in the MDL a
group of invoices confirming Kaylo was delivered to Badger Ordinance. (Ex. 15; Pl PFF 10.)
After the coworker testimony and the invoice disclosure OI did not file a dispositive
motion based on exposure although the deadline for such motions was October 8, 2012, in the
MDL-875 scheduling order. (Ex.5 at 1; Ex.7.) OI did however file a motion for partial
summary judgment limited to the MDL conspiracy and punitive damages claims. (Suoja MDL
Case 2:09-cv-60256-ER Document 101.) The conspiracy claim dismissal was not opposed and
Judge Robreno entered an order granting that part of the motion 1. (Suoja MDL Case 2:09-cv60256-ER Document 108.) The federal case was remanded to the Western District of Wisconsin
on January 9, 2014. (Doc # 11.)

1

Pursuant to general practice in MDL-875, no rulings are made on punitive damages claims,
which are retained in the MDL even after remand.

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 5 of 12

As has been discussed, standard interrogatory answers, which mistakenly failed to
mention the earlier Dane County lawsuit, were served by Plaintiff during the MDL-875 phase of
the case on about June 18, 2012. (Ex.12, ¶14.) Due to the 13 years which had elapsed after the
Dane County action was dismissed and the departure of attorney Rakauski from the Cascino
Vaughan Law Offices firm sometime before the end of 2003, CVLO did not have information in
the computer database or personal recollections by the firm’s current attorneys about the Dane
County action. (McCoy declaration at ¶ 12; Pl PFF 11.) As a result the Dane County action
mistakenly was not listed in answers to standard interrogatories in the federal case (McCoy
declaration at ¶ 12; Pl PFF 12.) However, Suoja’s discovery responses in the MDL advised OI
of the existence of the settlements which arose from the earlier action. (Ex. 22 at Interrogatory
36; ex. 21 at 2; Pl PFF 13.) Further, OI knew of the Suoja claim in 1997 or 1998 by the
settlement negotiations under the CVLO-OI agreement previously discussed (Pl PFF 14.)
During the briefing on OI’s unsuccessful motion to enforce the alleged settlement
agreement, and the resulting discovery motion practice, the past filing of the Dane County action
was learned about by attorney Robert McCoy who had assumed handling the Suoja case
sometime after remand. (Doc #62-1, McCoy declaration at ¶¶ 12-13; Pl PFF 15.) On March 4,
2015, District Judge Barbara Crabb entered an order denying a motion by OI to enforce the
alleged settlement agreement. (Doc # 67.)
OI then brought a motion to reopen discovery on issues of authority to make the alleged
agreement, the status of Gary Suoja as special administrator to bring the claim, and the Dane
County action. (Doc # 71.) In an order entered on April 10, 2015, by District Judge Crabb, the
motion to reopen discovery was denied as to the status of Gary Suoja as special administrator

5

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 6 of 12

and allowed by agreement of Plaintiff as to the authority to alleged agreement and the Dane
County action. (Doc # 77.)
In denying the discovery motion as to the status of Gary Suoja to serve as special
administrator, Judge Crabb found the opportunity to challenge the 2009 special administrator
appointment had been forfeited and the argument could no longer be asserted. (Doc #77 at 2-3.)
The basis of the ruling was OI failed to timely challenge in MDL-875 2009 order of Judge
Robreno which amended the case to make Gary Suoja the Plaintiff in the capacity of special
administrator. (Doc #77 at 2-3.) Judge Crabb held: “I am denying defendant’s request to
conduct discovery on plaintiff’s status as the administrator of the estate because I agree with
plaintiff that defendant has forfeited this issue.” (Doc #77 at 2.) Judge Crabb pointed to
availability to OI of the public record evidence of the Douglas County probate court proceedings
which could have been used to contest the appointment by Judge Robreno based on the earlier
discharge of Gary Suoja in the Douglas County probate court. (Doc #77 at 2.)
OI then conducted the agreed discovery in the 90 day window allowed by this Court on
the alleged settlement agreement and the Dane County action. (Ex.13.) Plaintiff provided
portions of the Dane County court file as the only historical information about the case available
to Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel. (Doc # 96; Ex. 16; Ex. 17, Ex.19.) Plaintiff also provided a
copy of the file from the Douglas County probate case. (Ex. 16; Ex. 17; Ex.19.) OI took lengthy
discovery depositions of two of Oswald Suoja’s children - Gary and Kimberly Suoja. (Ex. 18.)
After discovery on the issues relating to the alleged settlement agreement and the Dane
County action were completed, OI on July 10, 2015, filed the instant motion for summary
judgment. (Doc # 89.)

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 7 of 12

Argument
OI’s motion does not list any grounds in the motion for summary judgment but refers
only to the brief in support. Three grounds appear in the brief: issue preclusion based on the
Dane County action, Gary Suoja lacks “standing” to pursue the claim for the estate of his father,
and neither Delores nor Gary Suoja could bring a separate second action against OI. Each
argument is discussed below.

1. Issue Preclusion
“There are four specific elements to issue preclusion: (1) the issue is the same as one
involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the determination of the issue
was necessary to the prior judgment; and (4) the party against whom preclusion is invoked was
fully represented in the prior action.” Easley v. Reuss, 247 Fed. Appx. 823, 826-827, 2007 U.S.
App. LEXIS 22352, *7 (7th Cir. Wis. 2007).
OI has not established any of the above elements which are all necessary for issue
preclusion. While OI’s argument in the instant summary judgment motion does not make clear
about which issue OI believes should be precluded, it appears as if the issue is exposure to OI
products.
As to the first element above, OI was not a defendant to frame the issue of exposure to OI
products as one needing resolution in the Dane County action. OI was mentioned in connection
with the allegations against two other defendants – Owens Corning (the OI Kaylo distributor)
and Sprinkmann (a contractor which used OI Kaylo). However, claims against both defendants
were resolved by settlement agreements and payments without rulings or other determination as

7

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 8 of 12

to any exposure to OI products. The issue of OI product exposure was being dealt with in
settlement negotiations with OI and not in the Dane County lawsuit.
The second element required for claim preclusion is also not satisfied. The issue of OI
exposure was not a subject of “actual litigation” due to the settlements with Owens Corning and
Sprinkmann. No evidence is shown to be elicited during discovery on the OI exposures beyond
the allegations of the pleadings. Also, OI was only involved in settlement discussions with
CVLO and never as a party to the Dane County action to participate in litigation.
The third element of issue preclusion is also not satisfied. The settlements with Owens
Corning and Sprinkmann resulted in judgments without any determination of the merits of the
allegations that might relate to exposure to OI products. Although OI asserts in the proposed
findings of fact the claims against the defendants in the Dane County action were dismissed “on
the merits,” OI does not point to findings made by the Dane County court specific to OI or
exposure to OI products. As discussed above, the claims of the defendants in the Dane County
action that involved mention of OI products were resolved by settlement payments and judicial
determination as to the exposures was not necessary.
OI had the opportunity to assert the insufficiency of the coworker exposure evidence in
MDL-875, but OI did not make such a motion. OI makes no mention in the instant summary
judgment motion of the coworker testimony or invoices produced during the discovery period in
the MDL-875. The evidence of exposure to OI Kaylo has not changed since the MDL-875
scheduling order deadline for dispositive motions and the filing of OI’s motion for summary
judgment in this Court. By not filing a dispositive motion within the deadline set in MDL-875,
this court has already ruled the ability to file has been forfeited. The Dane County court case
was dismissed more than 12 years before the coworker OI Kaylo testimony occurred in the

8

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 9 of 12

MDL-875 depositions. The Dane County proceedings and materials in the Dane County case
have no preclusive effect to limit evidence against OI elicited in later MDL-875 discovery.
OI may argue in reply that it was pled as an unnamed coconspirator in the Dane County
action, but that coconspirator claim was not adjudicated and no evidence has been presented that
the coconspirator claim is being pursued in the instant case. (Doc # 91 OI’s Proposed Findings
of Fact at ¶ 21.) As to the negligence and strict products liability claims that are being pursued in
the instant case, no findings were made by the Court in the Dane County proceedings as to OI.
OI may argue in reply that Plaintiff’s response to Sprinkmann Sons Corporation’s
Request to Admit (“RTA”) in the Dane County case should lead to issue preclusion. (Doc # 91
OI’s Proposed Findings of Fact at ¶ 26.) However, OI has not provided evidence of any such
RTA response in the instant case. A RTA is not a party admission binding in other actions.
Kohler v. Leslie Hindman, Inc., 80 F.3d 1181, 1185, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 6583, *7, 34 Fed. R.
Serv. 3d (Callaghan) 1342 (7th Cir. Ill. 1996) (“When a party in a lawsuit makes an admission in
its pleadings or in its answer to a request for admissions, it makes a judicial admission that can
determine the outcome of that lawsuit. Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b); Murrey v. United States, 73 F.3d
1448, 1455 (7th Cir. 1996). But a statement made in one lawsuit cannot be a judicial admission
in another. See id.”).
Even if the Sprinkmann RTA answer is deemed admissible, the answer (cannot “admit or
deny”) is not conclusive, and a genuine issue of material fact remains as to OI Kaylo product
exposure based on coworker evidence which was elicited 12 years later and invoices for Kaylo at
Badger Ordinance.

2. Gary Suoja’s Standing

9

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 10 of 12

OI also challenges the “standing” of Gary Suoja to bring this action. (Doc #90 at 6-7.)
OI may argue in reply that the discharge in the Probate Court of Douglas County of Gary Suoja
as special administrator is determinative of the standing issue. (Doc # 91 OI’s Proposed
Findings of Fact at ¶ 54.) The issue has already been adjudicated by this Court and found to be
forfeited in denying OI’s motion for further discovery on the issue.
The discovery conducted by OI after the order did not produce new evidence on the
special administrator appointment beyond what is set forth in public orders of the Probate Court
in Douglas County. In finding forfeiture this Court pointed out the same public file was
available to OI when Judge Robreno’s order was issued in 2009. OI is effectively bringing a
second motion to reconsider Judge Robreno’s 2009 order and a motion to reconsider this Court’s
finding of forfeiture without any new grounds.

3. Filing of a Second Action
OI contends litigation of the initial Dane County action prohibits the filing or
maintenance of a separate action against OI in this Court. OI’s argument is misplaced. First,
consolidation of the claim against OI was attempted by Plaintiff and denied in the Dane County
action. Second, OI confuses the distinction between wrongful death and survival claims.
Consolidation was sought by Plaintiff’s motion in the Dane County case to amend and
add OI as a defendant that was found untimely. This Court has no reason to reconsider that
finding in light of the scheduling orders entered in the Dane County case which required
amendments to pleadings be filed by July 22, 1998. (Doc # 91 OI’s Proposed Findings of Fact at
¶ 22, OI ex 23..)

10

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 11 of 12

OI asks this Court to revisit the 1999 order denying amendment to add a claim against OI
by pointing to language in the Wisconsin wrongful death statute that requires “consolidation” if
more than one wrongful death action is pending. Wis. Stat. §895.04(3). OI’s confuses the
distinction between “wrongful death actions” and “survival actions” which has been carefully
laid out in decisions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court2. Oswald’s Suoja’s claims existed before
his death and “survive” his death in the name of his estate under the Wisconsin survival statute.
Wis. Stat. §895.01. Wrongful death is a new cause of action created at death for the
beneficiaries of the estate. “Although survival actions and wrongful death actions are commonly
intertwined, they are distinct.” Christ v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 2015 Wisc. LEXIS 326, *13, 2015
WI 58 (Wis. 2015).
Delores asserted the estate’s claims against OI under the survival statute. As to the
“distinct” claims asserted under the survival statute, the “consolidation” language in the
wrongful death statute has no application. Gary Suoja stepped into her shoes to continue to
assert the survival claims when Judge Robreno issued the order recognizing Gary as the special
administrator.
OI’s arguments about Gary Suoja bringing the wrongful death claim after the Dane
County action are also misplaced. Gary is designated under Judge Robreno’s order to bring
claims “individually,” which can only be for wrongful death. Wrongful death claims are

2

“Damages for injuries sustained by a tort victim prior to his death now survive in what is
known as a survival action … Survival actions are brought by the decedent's personal
representative to benefit the decedent's estate … Statutory survival actions exist under Wis. Stat.
§ 895.01(1)(am), … Certain relatives of tort victims are now also able to bring actions for
wrongful death. Wrongful death actions were created by statute in chapter 7, Laws of 1857. "A
wrongful death claim refers to the statutory cause of action belonging to named persons for
injuries suffered post death.” Christ v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 2015 Wisc. LEXIS 326, *10-13, 2015
WI 58 (Wis.2015) (citing Bartholomew v. Wis. Patients Comp. Fund, 2006 WI 91, ¶55, 293 Wis.
2d 38, 717 N.W.2d 216).
11

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-bbc Document #: 106 Filed: 08/04/15 Page 12 of 12

statutory and must be pursued by an individual authorized to bring such claims. See Wis. Stat.
§895.04. No other “individual” claims are proper after death based on the restrictions of the
statutory rights. Wrongful death claims are additional to and separate from the survival of the
estate’s common law claims against OI, for which Gary was also appointed by Judge Robreno.
Under the wrongful death act, if the spouse survives, only the spouse can assert the wrongful
death claim. Wis. Stat. 895.04(2). Delores did so in filing an “individual” claim against OI,
which can only be for wrongful death, in addition to the claim on behalf of the estate. After the
death of Delores, the wrongful death claims passed to the “lineal heirs.” Wis Stat. 895.04(2).
Under Judge Robreno’s order Gary Suoja has stepped into the shoes of Delores after her death to
“individually” bring the single consolidated claim permitted for the lineal heirs. The past history
of an earlier wrongful death action in Dane County involving other defendants has no bearing
because that action has terminated and “consolidation” as to that terminated action is moot.

Conclusion
For the above reasons the motion should be denied.
