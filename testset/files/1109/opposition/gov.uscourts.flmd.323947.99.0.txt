Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 2 of 22 PageID 2286

Plaintiff, Incarcerated Entertainment, LLC (“IE”), files its Response in Opposition to
Warner Bros. Pictures‟ (“Warner”) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff‟s First Amended Complaint and
states:
Introduction
IE has sued Warner for false advertising and related claims because Warner has and is
promoting its movie War Dogs as the true story of Efraim Diveroli (“Diveroli”), when
admittedly the film is largely a work of fiction. To establish its claims, IE describes Warner‟s
misconduct in great detail, identifies Warner‟s false promotional materials, quotes several of
Warner‟s assertions that War Dogs is true and alleges that these statements mislead consumers
about the content of the movie. Warner does not contend that its advertisements are appropriate
because War Dogs is actually a true story. Warner openly admits that War Dogs is not a true
story.1 Rather, Warner contends that its advertisements are immune from suit under the First
Amendment and are not false or misleading for other reasons. As such, the case rests upon the
issue of whether Warner‟s advertising conveys a false message and, if so, whether IE has pled
actionable claims. In false advertising cases, courts across the country, including in this Circuit,
balance the interest in free expression under the First Amendment against the public‟s interest in
enforcement of the Lanham Act—a test that requires a careful examination of the facts and
evidence. As described below, the First Amendment does not bar IE‟s well-pled claims, and
Warner‟s Motion to Dismiss (the “Motion”) should be denied.
Legal Standards on a Motion to Dismiss
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim merely tests the sufficiency
of the complaint; it does not decide the merits of the case. Milburn v. United States, 734 F.2d

1

See Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 89), p. 2. Because the parties agree that War Dogs is not a true story, a comparison
between Diveroli‟s real life and the movie is irrelevant.

762, 765 (11th Cir.1984). To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a complaint must
include “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant
is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Factual
allegations must be accepted as true and construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. Id.;
Belanger v. Salvation Army, 556 F. 3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir. 2009).
Notice pleading does not require “that the pleader allege a „specific fact‟ to cover every
element or allege „with precision‟ each element of a claim…” Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for
Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 683 (11th Cir. 2001). Rather, a complaint should include either direct
or inferential allegations of the material elements necessary to state a claim. Id.
IE need not meet Rule 9(b)‟s heightened pleading standard. Third Party Verification, Inc.
v. Signaturelink, Inc., 492 F. Supp.2d 1314, 1327 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (denying motion to dismiss
and finding that false advertising, unfair competition, and FDUTPA claims did not have to meet
Rule 9 pleading standards). Nevertheless, it easily does so for each claim. IE alleges many false
or misleading statements and includes the identity of the speaker, when the statement was made,
and where or to whom the statement was made.2 These allegations are sufficient to satisfy
Rule 9(b). See Continent Aircraft Trust v. Diamond Aircraft Indus., Case No. 11-61663, 2013
WL 2285539, at *8 (S.D. Fla. May 23, 2013) (denying motion to dismiss fraud claims).
IE agrees that the Court may and should consider the full advertisements and promotional
interviews that form the basis of IE‟s claims. Indeed, IE contemporaneously files the Declaration
of Ross Reback, see Dkt. 98, which includes multiple attachments located after filing the
Amended Complaint, demonstrating Warner‟s further promotion of War Dogs through various
cable companies and On Demand outlets as “the true story.” Because IE has not conducted
discovery, the full extent of Warner‟s involvement in and the consumer confusion caused by

these summaries remains to be seen. However, these advertisements demonstrate why this case
should not be dismissed and does not violate the First Amendment. In contrast, the evidence
Warner submitted that is unrelated to Warner‟s advertising and which addresses matters outside
the four corners of the Complaint should not be considered, as described in IE‟s Response to
Warner‟s Motion for Judicial Notice (Dkt. 97).
Argument
This Court should deny Warner‟s Motion to Dismiss because (a) IE‟s claims are not
barred by the First Amendment; (ii) IE pleads false and misleading statements sufficient to create
a question of fact; and (iii) IE pleads the remaining elements of its claims.
I.

The First Amendment Does Not Bar IE‟s Claims.
The protections afforded by the First Amendment are not limitless. Artistic or expressive

works with a commercial purpose, like a book, song, or movie, cannot deceive the public or
unfairly compete under the cloak of free speech. Instead, they are subject to a balancing test first
employed in Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989) and adopted by the Eleventh
Circuit in University of Alabama Bd. Of Trustees v. New Life Art, Inc., 683 F.3d 1266 (11th Cir.
2012). Given that an artistic work itself may violate the Lanham Act, Warner‟s argument that
advertisements for a commercially-distributed artistic work are fully shielded by the First
Amendment and outside the scope of the Lanham Act,3 defies logic. Not surprisingly, Warner
fails to cite a single case holding that the Lanham Act is inapplicable to advertising of expressive
or artistic works.4

3

See Dkt. 89, pp. 8-9.
Indeed, Warner cites several cases that analyze Lanham Act false advertising claims relating to creative works.
See, e.g., University of Alabama, 683 F.3d at 1276-78; Parks v. LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437 (6th Cir. 2003).

Although Warner concedes its advertisements are hybrid in nature—commercial speech
intertwined with noncommercial speech5—it nevertheless contends that, because they promote
an expressive work, they must be treated as noncommercial and cannot be regulated. Warner has
scant authority for its position,6 and the case on which it most heavily relies, Gordon & Breach
Sci. Publ’rs S.A. v. Am. Inst. Of Physics, 859 F. Supp. 1521, 1533 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), says the
opposite: “Of course, the fact that an advertisement promotes a good or service protected by the
First Amendment does not serve by itself to remove the ad from the realm of commercial
speech…” Gordon, 859 F. Supp. At 1541, n.8. The issue of whether Warner‟s ads should be
treated as commercial speech is itself a fact question. See O’Grady v. Twentieth Century Fox
Film Corp., No. 5:02CV173, 2003 WL 24174616, *15 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 19, 2003) (finding “a fact
issue whether this is a case about commercial speech...”).7 And, if Warner‟s ads are
noncommercial speech, the Rogers balancing test applies and raises additional factual questions
inappropriate for disposition on a motion to dismiss. Id.
A.

IE Alleges Warner‟s Advertisements are Unprotected Commercial Speech.

Warner‟s contention that speech with any artistic or expressive element cannot be
commercial and cannot be regulated is simply wrong.8 Both ads for expressive works and mixed
speech can be treated as commercial speech. At this stage of the proceeding, without the benefit
of discovery, IE has alleged sufficient facts to raise a factual question about whether Warner‟s
speech is commercial.

5

See Dkt. 89, pp. 9-10.
Warner only cites 2 J. McCarthy, The Rights of Publicity & Privacy § 8.69 (2016) for the general proposition that
advertising for expressive works shares the same immunity as the media use itself. See Dkt. 89, p. 8.
7
O’Grady was a Report and Recommendation. The Court advised the parties to assume that it would adopt the
Report and Recommendation and the case settled thereafter. See Dkts. 180 and 195.

The concept that advertisements for expressive works can independently violate the
Lanham Act is not novel. “Doctrines extending noncommercial status from a protected work to
advertising for that work are justified only to the extent necessary to safeguard the ability to
truthfully promote protected speech.” Charles v. City of L.A., 697 F.3d 1146, 1156 (9th Cir.
2012) (emphasis added). In Charles, the court stated: “That the underlying E! News program is
itself entitled to full First Amendment protection does not cloak all advertisements for the
program with noncommercial status; speech inviting the public to watch E! News is not
inherently identical to the speech that constitutes the program itself.” Id. at 1152.
Not only did the Charles court reject Warner‟s proposed rule that all advertising for
movies is beyond the reach of commercial speech regulations, it correctly summarized that such
a rule would “radically enlarge the recognized exceptions to the First Amendment‟s limited
protection for advertising,” and that “[n]o court has ever suggested that such a broad exception to
the commercial speech doctrine is required…” Id. at 1156. Here, extending noncommercial
status to Warner‟s advertisements is not necessary to safeguard Warner‟s ability to promote its
protected movie. Warner could and should have promoted War Dogs without misleading the
public that it is a true story. Thus, Warner‟s advertisements do not deserve the same protection as
its movie.
Warner‟s assertion that its ads are intertwined speech that must be treated as
noncommercial speech and cannot be regulated is equally flawed.9 Warner relies on Gordon &
Breach Sci. Publ’rs S.A. v. Am. Inst. Of Physics, 859 F. Supp. 1521, 1533 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), Riley
v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781 (1988), and Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods.
Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983) to support the notion that “when commercial and noncommercial

speech are „intertwined,‟ the speech as a whole must be shielded.”10 However, none of the cases
Warner cites adopt the rigid, bright-line standard Warner suggests in its Motion. To the contrary,
each court conducts a careful analysis evaluating several factors to determine whether the speech
at issue is actually intertwined and should be considered commercial or noncommercial. Thus,
even when speech is intertwined, it is not automatically considered noncommercial. Here, IE has
sufficiently pled the elements establishing Warner‟s War Dogs advertisements qualify as
commercial speech, thus raising an issue of fact that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.
Warner‟s reliance on Gordon to claim that its speech is protected is misplaced. Gordon
illustrates how several factors must be evaluated to determine whether speech qualifies as
noncommercial. Importantly, two factors were paramount to that Court: (1) the non-profit
nature of the defendant‟s business, and (2) the fact that the speech was part of an academic
journal. The decision emphasized the importance of these factors by expressly limiting its
holding stating “we do not consider whether we would reach a different result if the articles in
question were authored by a commercial entity . . . or if they were published in the trade journal
of a commercial enterprise or industry.” Gordon, 859 F.Supp. at 1542, n. 10.
Here, Warner is a for-profit entity, and its speech is not part of some larger educational or
academic materials. Rather, Warner‟s false advertisements and promotions were made to benefit
its own economic interests by selling movie tickets to its film—because movies that are “true
stories” sell better to the public.11 Accordingly, Warner‟s reliance on Gordon for the proposition
that intertwined speech should automatically be considered noncommercial is improper.
In Riley, the pertinent speech included a statement required by state law, thus making the
speech “inextricably intertwined” with any other statements made by the professional

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 8 of 22 PageID 2292

fundraisers. Warner‟s speech was not required by law, and is not so “inextricably intertwined”
with fully protected speech so as to require the court to treat it as noncommercial. See O’Grady,
2003 WL 24174616, at *13 (“The Court is also not convinced as a matter of law that the speech
is „hybrid speech‟ because Defendants‟ commercial advertisements and promotional materials
are not „inextricably intertwined‟ with expressive speech.”).
Bolger supports IE‟s position and recognizes the difficulty in addressing speech that
contained part commercial solicitation and part discussion of public issues. Ultimately, the court
in Bolger rejected the use of bright-line tests Warner suggests in its Motion, and instead provided
the following guidance:
The mere fact that these pamphlets are conceded to be advertisements clearly does
not compel the conclusion that they are commercial speech. Similarly, the
reference to a specific product does not by itself render the pamphlets commercial
speech. Finally, the fact that Youngs has an economic motivation for mailing the
pamphlets would clearly be insufficient by itself to turn the materials into
commercial speech. The combination of all these characteristics, however,
provides strong support for the . . . conclusion that the informational pamphlets
are properly characterized as commercial speech.
Id. at 66-67 (citations and footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).

The Court further

explained:
The mailings constitute commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they
contain discussions of important public issues such as venereal disease and family
planning. We have made clear that advertising which links a product to a current
public debate is not thereby entitled to the constitutional protection afforded
noncommercial speech. . . . Advertisers should not be permitted to immunized
false or misleading product information from government regulation simply by
including references to public issues.
Id. at 67-68.
Bolger undermines Warner‟s blanket proposition that “[w]hen commercial and
noncommercial speech are „intertwined‟, the speech as a whole must be shielded”12 and instead
12

See Dkt. 89, p. 9.

7

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 9 of 22 PageID 2293

explains precisely how intertwined speech can still be considered commercial in nature. Just like
the speech in Bolger, Warner‟s speech promotes, advertises, and references a product (War
Dogs), through which Warner obtained an economic benefit. These factors support the
conclusion that Warner‟s advertisements for War Dogs are commercial. Warner cannot cloak
itself in constitutional protections to avoid claims for false and misleading advertisements by
suggesting that its movie advertisements are inextricably intertwined with expressive speech.
Warner‟s contention that its ads are intertwined speech that should be shielded as a whole
is premature. The character and circumstances surrounding the speech in question must be
considered and raises issues of fact that cannot be decided at this stage. Ultimately, the
allegations in the Amended Complaint are sufficient to support the conclusion that the speech at
issue is commercial in nature, thereby leaving it unprotected from Lanham Act claims.
B.

Intertwined Speech is Regulated by the Lanham Act and Analyzed Under the
Rogers Balancing Test.

Although Warner argues for a finding of intertwined speech, it ignores the controlling
Rogers test. Warner‟s authorities do nothing to overrule the analysis employed in the many
cases applying the Lanham Act to mere titles of artistic works—speech that is far less
commercial than Warner‟s advertisements. Accordingly, even if the Court finds Warner‟s speech
to be intertwined and subject to some protection as noncommercial speech, that protection must
still be balanced against the interests analyzed in Rogers and its progeny. Simply put, the
Lanham Act and similar state law claims provide a remedy for false or misleading intertwined
speech, and Warner‟s vague arguments to the contrary are wrong.
In Rogers, Ginger Rogers sued the producers and distributors of a movie titled Ginger
and Fred for a violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. Rogers, 875 F.2d at 997. The trial
court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, settling on the exact position

{BC00111272:1}

8

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 10 of 22 PageID 2294

Warner advocates in this case, finding that “because the speech at issue here is not primarily
intended to serve a commercial purpose, the prohibitions of the Lanham Act do not apply, and
the Film is entitled to the full scope of protection under the First Amendment.” Id.
The Second Circuit rejected the trial court‟s approach because it “unduly narrows the
scope of the [Lanham] Act.” Id. Notably, while recognizing that movies and other works of
artistic expression deserve protection, the Second Circuit concluded that Rogers‟ claim was
actionable because movies are sold in the commercial marketplace, where “the danger of
consumer deception [is] a legitimate concern that warrants some government protection.” Id.
This need to protect both artistic expression and consumer expectations necessitates a balancing
test:
We believe that in general the Act should be construed to apply to artistic works
only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the
public interest in free expression. In the context of allegedly misleading titles
using a celebrity‟s name, that balance will normally not support application of the
Act unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever,
or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the
source or the content of the work.
Id. at 999 (emphasis added). This test applies to intertwined speech that combines artistic
expression and commercial promotion, whether its subject is the title of an artistic work or an
advertisement for the artistic work. Id. at 998; see also Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday
Dell Publ’g Group, 886 F.2d 490, 495 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding Rogers test “generally applicable
to Lanham Act claims against works of artistic expression”).
After considering the evidence—in the form of survey data, anecdotal evidence, and the
title of the work itself—the court found no issue of fact to submit to the jury. Rogers, 875 F.2d at
at 1001. But the court provided examples of situations that may constitute Lanham Act
violations, such as titles that are artistically relevant but misleading as to source or content. Id. at

{BC00111272:1}

9

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 11 of 22 PageID 2295

999. The court reasoned that use of a celebrity‟s name combined with representations of truth
may warrant Lanham Act protection. “For example, if the characters in the film in this case had
published their memoirs under the title “The True Life Story of Ginger and Fred,” and if the
film-maker had then used that fictitious book title as the title of the film, the Lanham Act could
be applicable to such an explicitly misleading description of content.” Id. at 1000.
The claims at issue in this case are analogous. Warner‟s advertisements use Diveroli‟s
real name (as does the entire movie) and false assertions that the movie is true—suggesting that
War Dogs is more than just “based” on a true story. Beyond using Diveroli‟s name, the War
Dogs advertisements use the real name of David Packouz, Diveroli‟s childhood friend who
became an independent contractor for Diveroli‟s company, AEY, Inc., and AEY, Inc.‟s name.
The movie trailer includes a realistic scene of a Wolf Blitzer CNN television report and touts the
movie as “an unbelievable story of the American dream.”13 Accordingly, Warner‟s misleading
representations fit the very scenario the Rogers court used to exemplify an unprotected
expressive work that is actionable under the Lanham Act.
In another similar case, the Sixth Circuit also reversed summary judgment in favor of the
defendant on a Lanham Act claim because the use of Rosa Parks‟ name as a song title and on an
album cover raised a disputed issue of fact as to whether that speech was artistically related to
the content of the song or whether the use of her name was a misleading advertisement. Parks,
329 F.3d at 458. In reaching its decision, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the First Amendment
does not grant everyone who cries "artist" carte blanche when it comes to advertising its works.
Id. at 454; see also Columbus Rose Ltd. v. New Millennium Press, No. 02Civ2634, 2002 WL
1033560, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. May 10, 2002) (granting injunction and finding likelihood of success

(Dec. 19, 2003) (recommending denial of defendants‟ motion for summary judgment and finding
question of fact about misleading nature of movie advertisements).
Movie studios themselves have relied on the Lanham Act to remedy misleading
advertising of movies released by competitor studios. In Miramax Films Corp. v. Columbia
Pictures Entm’t, Inc., 996 F. Supp. 294 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), the production company for the movie
Scream sued its competitor for advertising its movie Summer as being “from the creator of
Scream.” Scream was directed by Wes Craven and promoted as a “Wes Craven product,” and
Kevin Williamson wrote the original screenplay. Id. at 296. Craven was not involved with
Summer, but Williamson adapted a novel for the screenplay.

Id. Miramax sued for false

advertising under the Lanham Act and moved for preliminary injunctive relief to enjoin
Columbia‟s advertising.
Importantly, Miramax was “clearly a false advertising case because the misleading words
appear in advertisements and promotional materials.” Id. at 299. As such, and as was the case in
Rogers, the court reviewed the advertisements and other evidence relating to consumer confusion
before granting injunctive relief. Id. at 302.
The Lanham Act and analogous state law claims14 provide a remedy for
misrepresentations in advertisements for artistic works. IE‟s claims are actionable. And, at this
stage, IE‟s detailed allegations must be accepted as true and as sufficient to state claims for false
advertising. Evidence cannot be weighed, as would be required to determine whether Warner‟s
speech is protected.

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 13 of 22 PageID 2297

Because Warner‟s advertisements are subject to the Lanham Act, IE need only allege
false or misleading statements. See Ameritox, Ltd. v. Millennium Labs., Inc., 889 F. Supp. 2d
1304, 1312 (M.D. Fla. 2012) (denying motion to dismiss and finding plaintiff stated claims for
false advertising and unfair competition).15 Warner claims that IE has not identified any false or
misleading statements based on two general legal propositions which it manipulates into a sort of
“test” that IE must pass at the pleading stage.16 However, Warner‟s authorities stand only for the
proposition that statements must be viewed in the full context of each advertisement, but must
not be viewed as an entire campaign. See id; Johnson and Johnson Vision Care Inc. v. 1-800
Contacts, Inc., 299 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. 2002).
IE has pleaded several false and misleading statements that do not rely on the entire
campaign. As one example, as described above, the movie trailers viewed in their entirety could
easily lead a consumer to believe that War Dogs is Diveroli‟s true story. The ads use real names
(Diveroli and Packouz), reference a real company (AEY, Inc.), incorporate realistic news reports
(Wolf Blitzer‟s “Breaking News” CNN segment), and tout an “unbelievable story.”
IE also alleges multiple false and misleading statements made by Warner‟s agents in
social media interviews to promote the film. Again, these statements could mislead consumers.
Warner also publicized its retention of Packouz and another prominent figure the public equates
as being intimately familiar with Diveroli‟s true story, Guy Lawson, to lend credibility to its
promotion of the film as “true.” Warner even gave Packouz a cameo appearance in the film and
credited Lawson as a co-producer. With this knowledge, a consumer would likely apply

15

The court identifies the elements of a section 43(a) Lanham Act false advertising claim as: (1) the advertisements
of the opposing party were false or misleading; (2) the advertisements deceived, or had the capacity to deceive,
consumers; (3) the deception had a material effect on purchasing decisions; (4) the misrepresented product or
service affects interstate commerce; and (5) the movant has been—or is likely to be—injured as a result of the false
advertising.

12

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/16 Page 14 of 22 PageID 2298

additional weight to statements by these individuals. At this stage, although the exact
relationship between Warner, Packouz, and Lawson is unknown, IE has sufficiently alleged an
agency relationship.17 See Continent Aircraft, 2013 WL 2285539, at *10 (denying motion to
dismiss even though agency allegations were “thin”).
Facing these facts, Warner, without engaging in discovery, asks the Court to ignore the
power of its advertising campaign and instead argues that a consumer could not be deceived
about the truth of the movie because it is “obviously fictionalized,” and its director‟s and actors‟
statements are not “unqualified” or are mere “puffery.”18 Essentially, Warner attacks IE for
alleging its perceptions about the advertisements, but then asserts that its own perceptions about
the quotes cited in the Amended Complaint should control. Warner even goes so far as to
discredit direct and unequivocal assertions that the film is true by arguing that IE should have to
prove the statements were authorized. This is not IE‟s obligation at the pleading stage.
Even more gaunt than these flawed arguments is Warner‟s reliance on War Dogs’
disclaimer, which a consumer could only see after he purchases his ticket and watches the entire
movie. Warner cannot cure the confusion its advertising created after-the-fact by throwing up a
disclaimer after the purchasing decision had already been made.
Warner also incorrectly argues that it is immune because it never explicitly stated War
Dogs told the unadulterated truth. Motion, p. 7. The O’Grady court rejected this very argument.
See O’Grady, 2003 WL 24174616, at *4 (focusing on the false and misleading impression
created by the promotion). More importantly, IE has alleged that Warner actually did tell the
public the movie was true.19 Warner contends that its false statements were unauthorized or

canceled out by qualifications and caveats, but IE‟s alleged facts must be accepted as true and
raise a question of fact as to whether Warner created a misleading perception about the movie is
a question that must be left to a fact-finder. See id.
III.

IE Pleads the Remaining Elements of its Claims.
IE‟s Amended Complaint more than adequately alleges materiality and causation.

Warner is simply incorrect in asserting that IE failed to “meet several other required elements”20
for its claims. First, IE‟s Amended Complaint sets forth specific allegations regarding the
materiality of Warner‟s false and misleading advertisements and how those advertisements
damaged IE. Second, nothing at the pleading stage requires IE to identify specific persons who
were misled by Warner‟s false and misleading advertisements nor to prove how such persons
were misled into acting based on those advertisements. None of the cases cited by Warner
support its arguments that such identification and proof is required at the pleading stage. For
example, IE will have the opportunity to prove these elements through survey evidence, expert
opinions, and of course, direct factual evidence obtained during discovery.
A.

IE‟s Amended Complaint Sufficiently Alleges Materiality and Causation.

With regard to alleging the materiality of Warner‟s false advertising asserting that War
Dogs is the true story, IE even quotes Todd Phillips, the director of War Dogs and Miles Teller,
one of the principal actors, in its Amended Complaint21:
68. Warner Bros. placed a substantial importance on representing War
Dogs as a true story to the public because it knew that such representations induce
consumers to go see movies. In fact, Phillips even stated that “the idea that this
was a true story was for me the most interesting part about it.”
69. Similarly, Miles Teller recognized that: “I love the words „based on a
true story‟ at the beginning of a film…it buys you so much with an
audience.”

70. In another interview, Phillips relayed the results of test screening the
movie, which involve surveying real consumers about their opinions about the
film, by stating: “I think one of the things that really attracts people to it when
we test screen the movie, what did you like about the movie, I think one of
the main things is that it was based on a real story.”
After incorporating these allegations into each of its counts, IE alleges 22 that Warner‟s
representations are likely to mislead consumers, actually deceived or intended to deceive a
substantial number of consumers and were material to their purchasing decisions. IE‟s Amended
Complaint further alleges how Warner‟s false advertising caused damage to IE,23 by essentially
cutting it out of the competitive marketplace. IE‟s Amended Complaint incorporates each of the
above allegations regarding causation above into each of its counts. In addition, IE further
alleges24 that Warner‟s representations caused IE to suffer injury and damage.
In light of all of these allegations, Warner does not and cannot argue that IE failed to
allege materiality and causation. Nor can Warner take issue in its Motion with the truth of these
allegations.25 Instead, Warner incorrectly asserts that IE needs to establish more at this early
stage, while relying on cases that do not support its argument that IE‟s allegations are in any way
deficient. IE has properly pleaded all of the required elements of its claims.
B.

IE is Not Required to “Establish” Materiality and Causation in its Pleading.

As to the pleading of materiality, Warner faults IE for not addressing the types of details
seldom if ever found in a pleading. For example, Warner assails IE for not identifying any
specific consumers who were deceived by Warner‟s false advertising and not disproving that
“obvious innocent factors . . . drove the consumer‟s buying decision.”26 The case Warner relies

upon, Johnson & Johnson, 299 F.3d 1242, does not support its assertion that IE‟s pleading is in
any way deficient. In fact, the Johnson & Johnson case did not address pleading at all. That
case dealt with a preliminary injunction, the record evidence, and the plaintiff‟s burden to prove
likelihood of success, not pleading requirements. Nor does Johnson & Johnson require that “IE
„must‟ establish this materiality element at the pleading stage by showing “how the statement
actually deceived specific consumers”.27 Quite obviously, the evidence needed to support the
grant of a preliminary injunction (as in Johnson & Johnson) is substantially different than that
needed to adequately plead a cause of action. Warner conflates this critical distinction.
Warner also wrongly argues that IE is required to “plead enough specifics to show how
„reasonable‟ consumers would be deceived by Warner‟s promotions.”28 First, although not
required to do so, IE met the heightened pleading standard suggested by Warner. IE‟s Amended
Complaint alleges that Todd Phillips publically stated: “I think one of the things that really
attracts people to it when we test screen the movie, what did you like about the movie, I think
one of the main things is that it was based on a real story.”29 Second, Warner failed to provide
any case support for its dubious elevated pleading standard. Instead, Warner cites this Court to
Pernod Ricard USA, LLC v. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc., 653 F.3d 241 (3d Cir. 2011), which merely
affirmed the trial court‟s bench trial decision. Far from dealing with pleading requirements,
Pernod is utterly silent on the issue, focusing instead on the evidence presented at trial.
Nor do the other cases cited by Warner aid its argument for a heightened materiality
pleading requirement. In Partington v. Bugliosi, 56 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 1995), the court affirmed
grant of summary judgment in a defamation case—not a false advertising case—and did not
27

See Dkt. 89, p. 18. The other case cited by Warner for this proposition, Swatch S.A. v. New City Inc., 454 F.
Supp.2d 1245 (S.D. Fla. 2006), also fails to support it. Swatch denied a plaintiff‟s motion for summary judgment
and did not address pleading requirements.

address pleading requirements at all. Greenspan v. Random House, Inc., 859 F. Supp. 2d 206 (D.
Mass 2012) is also inapposite. In Greenspan, the plaintiff wholly failed to allege that any of the
defendants‟ misrepresentations “influenced, or would likely influence consumer purchasing
decisions” or resulting harm to its business. Id. at 220. In this case, as shown above, IE expressly
alleged both the elements that were entirely absent in the Greenspan case.
Warner concludes its materiality pleading argument by spending two pages arguing that
Diveroli‟s past misconduct renders excusable Warner‟s promotion of the film as true while
admitting that the portrayal of him in War Dogs is not.30 This thinly-veiled attempt to prejudice
the Court against Diveroli and IE, by association, fails. The point of this case is that Warner
knowingly and falsely advertised the movie as telling the true story of a rather dramatic period in
Diveroli‟s life. Warner finds itself before the Court because it chose to lie about the truth rather
than tell it. War Dogs‟ own director freely admits that telling the public that the film is based on
a true story attracts an audience. Warner cannot have it both ways. It is free to make up stories
for the sake of entertainment. But, if Warner chooses to do so, it cannot misrepresent its madeup story as “true” to attract larger audiences as it so clearly did here.
In short, Warner utterly failed to present this Court with anything other than a naked
argument to support its position that IE‟s Amended Complaint failed to sufficiently allege that
Warner‟s false advertising claims were material.

IE specifically identified numerous false

advertising statements attributable to Warner and its agents and expressly alleged such false
statements “deceive or are likely to deceive consumers”,31 are “deceptive and unfair and likely to

30

Because the parties agree that War Dogs is not a true story, a comparison between Diveroli‟s real life and the War
Dogs movie is irrelevant.

mislead consumers”,32 and “actually deceived or tended to deceive a substantial number of
consumers and were material to consumers‟ purchasing decisions.”33
Similarly, IE‟s Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that it has been, and continues to
be, harmed by Warner‟s false advertising. IE agrees with Warner that it “must allege an injury to
a commercial interest in reputation or sales.”34 Without question, IE has done so. IE‟s Amended
Complaint specifically alleges that Warner‟s false advertising statements: “have caused and are
likely to continue causing Incarcerated competitive or commercial injury”,35 “have caused and
are likely to continue causing Incarcerated competitive or commercial injury, including, but not
limited to, loss of goodwill and loss of sales”,36 “were intended to cause and did in fact cause
deception of the public, misleading prospective purchasers as to the truth of the story presented
in War Dogs”,37 and that, as a result of Warner‟s false advertising statements, IE “has suffered
damages, including, but not limited to, loss of goodwill and loss of sales.”38
Warner, however, argues that IE is required to do more at the pleading stage. Warner is
wrong and the cases it cites do not support its position. Although Warner relies on Lexmark
Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377 (2014) in arguing that IE failed to
adequately allege proximate causation,39 Lexmark actually establishes the sufficiency of IE‟s
pleading. In discussing the pleading of proximate causation, the Supreme Court stated, in the
same footnote cited by Warner:
If a plaintiff’s allegations, taken as true, are insufficient to establish proximate
causation, then the complaint must be dismissed; if they are sufficient, then the
plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to prove them. (Emphasis added).

Id. at p. 1391, n. 6. Here, as shown above, IE expressly alleged proximate causation and those
allegations must be taken as true. As such, under Lexmark, IE “is entitled to an opportunity to
prove” those allegations. See Id.
Nor does Global Tech LED, LLC v. Hilumz Int’l Corp., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70584
(M.D. Fla. May 31, 2016) support Warner‟s argument. In Global Tech, the court found that the
counterclaims asserting false advertising entirely lacked causation and damages allegations:
The counterclaims contain no allegations of commercial or reputational injury,
nor plead a causal link between the misrepresentation and the injury. In fact,
nothing in Defendant’s pleading indicates that Defendants have ever been
injured.
Id. at *8-9.

Conversely, IE‟s Amended Complaint expressly and specifically alleged both

commercial and reputational injury caused by Warner‟s false advertising statements.40
Warner is also wrong in asserting that IE failed to adequately allege its injuries and
arguing that IE merely “hints at three injuries”.41 In fact, IE expressly alleged (not merely
hinted) that it has suffered “competitive or commercial injury”42 and “loss of goodwill and loss
of sales”.43

IE is not required at the pleading stage, as Warner argues, to specifically allege

how its goodwill was injured or “detail how its sales . . . declined in response to any allegedly
misleading ad.”44 Nor is IE required in its Amended Complaint to “account for obvious plausible
„alternative‟ causes and effects.”45 Nothing in the case law cited by Warner requires the pleading
of such allegations. See Lexmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1393-1395 (determining that false advertising
claim was adequately pled); Black Diamond Land Mgmt., LLC v. Twin Pines Coal Co., 2016

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87022 *45-46 (N.D. Ala. July 6, 2016)(plaintiff failed to allege “contents of
any advertisements by Defendants”); American Dental Association v. Cigna Corp., 605 F.3d
1283 (11th Cir. 2010)(RICO case, not false advertising, noting that where proximate cause not
expressly alleged—as here—court may make inferences).
IE‟s express allegations that Warner‟s false advertising caused IE harm is far from
implausible. Rather, IE has alleged that it is selling a competitive product—a book detailing the
true story of Diveroli‟s adventures—and that Warner is causing it harm by falsely advertising the
War Dogs movie as the true story of those same adventures. It is certainly likely, and not
implausible, that Warner has inflicted commercial harm on IE based on Warner flooding the
market with its false proclamations that War Dogs tells the true story of Diveroli.
IV.

The Court Should Ignore Warner‟s SLAPP References.
Warner states that it will file a motion for an award of fees and costs pursuant to Florida‟s

anti-SLAPP statute, section 768.295, Florida Statutes, if the Court grants the Motion to Dismiss.
Because the Court should deny the Motion, Warner‟s anti-SLAPP arguments are irrelevant and
not ripe. If the Court decides to consider Warner‟s anti-SLAPP arguments, then IE requests an
opportunity to respond by separate brief to raise all of its responsive arguments, including the
Eleventh Circuit‟s decision in Royalty Network, Inc. v. Harris, 756 F.3d 1351 (11th Cir. 2014)
finding that Georgia‟s anti-SLAPP statute did not apply in federal court.
Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, this Court should deny the Motion to Dismiss.
Request for Oral Argument
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(j), IE respectfully requests the Court to schedule oral
argument on the Motion to Dismiss and related filings, which IE estimates should take one hour.
