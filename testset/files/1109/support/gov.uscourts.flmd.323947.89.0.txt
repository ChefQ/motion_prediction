INCARCERATED ENTERTAINMENT, LLC,
Plaintiff,

Case No.: 8:16-cv-1302-T-35UA (ICG)
DISPOSITIVE MOTION

WARNER BROS. PICTURES, a Division of
WB STUDIOS ENTERPRISES INC.,
Defendants.

WARNER BROS. PICTURES’ MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S FIRST
AMENDED COMPLAINT AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendant Warner Bros. Pictures (“Warner”) respectfully moves for entry of an order
dismissing Incarcerated Entertainment, LLC’s (“IE”) First Amended Complaint, see Dkt. No.78
(“FAC”), because it fails to state a claim, see FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). The FAC should be
dismissed with prejudice because this is the second time that IE has failed to state a claim, see
Dkt. No. 40, and because further amendment would be futile, especially in light of the First
Amendment infirmities in IE’s claims.
Warner also seeks its fees and costs in defending this suit pursuant to Florida’s antiSLAPP statute. See FLA. STAT. ANN. § 768.295. Florida amended the statute in 2015 to make it
“easier and cheaper” for moviemaker defendants like Warner to dismiss lawsuits of this sort at
an “early stage[]” and to recover their litigation expenses. Samuel Morley, Florida’s Expanded
Anti-SLAPP Law: More Protection for Targeted Speakers, 90 FLA. B.J. 17-18 (Nov. 2016).
Warner’s expenses in this case are substantial given the scope and changing nature of IE’s case.
This Motion is based on the following Memorandum of Law and Declaration of Dimitri
Portnoi, Notice of Filing, and Request that Court Consider Sources all filed herewith.

I.

Introduction
The movie War Dogs dramatizes a true story—condemned by Congress and recounted in

various news sources—of how several young men secured a $300 million contract to supply
arms in aid of a U.S. war, only to be convicted of fraud. While darkly comedic and told from the
perspective of one of the young men (David Packouz), the movie tackles many important issues
of the day: including greed, war profiteering, and contemporary U.S. foreign policy.
Motion pictures generally, and especially those that dramatize front-page news events,
are shielded by the First Amendment and Florida’s anti-SLAPP laws. No one owns the historical
facts recounted in such movies, and moviemakers have broad artistic license to dramatize stories
“based on” true events—in order to reach audiences, to tell a compelling story, and to convey a
message. Dkt. No. 40 at 1, 9-10, 16-19. These freedoms of speech extend to advertisements for
movies, and the First Amendment bars causes of action challenging such speech. Id.
Efraim Diveroli (through his company, IE) has now filed a second complaint seeking to
hold Warner liable for creating and promoting War Dogs. Initially, IE alleged that Warner
conspired to steal Diveroli’s true-crime story and misappropriated his personality rights to
promote the film. Warner moved to dismiss the complaint, showing that no story theft occurred
and that all of IE’s claims were barred by Eleventh Circuit and Florida law. Id.
Rather than oppose the motion, IE hired new counsel and withdrew its complaint. IE’s
latest complaint drops six defendants and all of its prior claims, but it is still without merit. The
FAC’s gravamen is that in marketing War Dogs, Warner sold the film as “the ‘true story’ of []
Efraim Diveroli” and as the “unadulterated truth.” FAC ¶¶ 1, 2. IE contends that such alleged
promotions were misleading and hurt its ability to sell Diveroli’s memoir to other buyers.
IE’s claims cannot survive a motion to dismiss. To begin, IE’s complaint attacks free
speech, including artists talking about their creative process. Such speech may not be regulated.
1

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 3 of 27 PageID 1587

Even if such speech could be challenged (and it cannot), IE’s conclusory claims about
what Warner said are contradicted by the sources that IE incorporated by reference in the FAC.
As examples, War Dogs’ trailers explicitly state that the movie is “Based On A True Story.”
This tagline makes plain that parts of the movie are fiction (not the “unadulterated truth”), as
does a prominent disclaimer in the film. In promoting the movie, the creators of War Dogs also
said that parts of it were fictional. IE only selectively quotes from these statements in the FAC,
but established law requires that the Court consider the full interviews in ruling on this motion. 1
IE cannot plead other key elements of its claims as well—including that any consumer
saw the ads at issue, relied upon them, was deceived, or thus chose not to buy Diveroli’s book.
Nor can IE plead causation. To the contrary, IE admits that the 2016 ad campaign it challenges
occurred after potential Hollywood buyers declined to purchase Diveroli’s story in 2014.
In short, while Diveroli might dislike War Dogs, wish he controlled its contents, or wish
he was paid to make it, that does not give rise to a Lanham Act or Florida state law claim. To the
contrary, IE’s latest SLAPP complaint, which chills speech, should be dismissed with prejudice.
II.

Factual and Procedural Background
For purposes of this motion, Warner assumes the well-pleaded facts in IE’s complaint are

true, see Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, 480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir. 2007), but does
not accept “unwarranted deductions of fact or legal conclusions,” or facts refuted by the sources
cited in IE’s complaint, Moseley v. Carnival Corp., 593 F. App’x 890, 892 (11th Cir. 2014).
Because this is now a false advertising case, the Court “must” be especially careful to review the
alleged false statements at issue in “full context”—as to do otherwise would be akin to trying to
1

See infra 2-3, 10-11. In a Request filed herewith (“RJN”), Warner furnishes the Court with
underlying copies of the statements that IE challenges. As noted in the Request, the Court may
also take notice of records like the court order affirming Diveroli’s conviction, news sources
relevant to the First Amendment analysis, and the DVD copy of War Dogs and Diveroli’s
memoir. E.g., U.S. ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana Inc., 776 F.3d 805, 811 & n.4 (11th Cir. 2015).

Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 299 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. 2002).
A.

The Afghan Arms Deal and Efraim Diveroli’s Criminal Prosecution

In 2006, the United States sought to arm Afghan security forces to help fight the Taliban.
The United States opened for bid a contract to supply these munitions, and in 2007, it awarded
AEY, Inc. (“AEY”) a $298 million supply contract. Diveroli, a Miami man in his early twenties,
ran AEY with help from several colleagues, including David Packouz. FAC ¶¶ 12, 14, 15.
While attempting to fulfill the Afghan contract (which required sourcing millions of rounds of
AK-47 ammunition), AEY bought embargoed Chinese-made ammunition from Eastern Europe,
and AEY, Diveroli, and Packouz conspired to defraud the United States about the origin of the
rounds. See id. ¶¶ 14-16; RJN Ex. B (Diveroli v. U.S., 803 F.3d 1258, 1261 (11th Cir. 2015)).
The New York Times ran a front-page story in 2008 concerning AEY’s Afghan deal. RJN
Ex. C. In the story’s wake, the United States suspended AEY’s contract, and it indicted Diveroli,
Packouz, and others on 80 counts of criminal fraud. See FAC ¶ 16; Diveroli, 803 F.3d at 1261.
A congressional committee condemned the episode “as a case study in what is wrong with the
procurement process.” RJN Ex. D at 1. It pointedly asked: “Why did [our] government award a
military contract worth $300 million to a company run by an inexperienced 21-year-old?” Id.
Diveroli pled guilty to conspiracy. RJN Exs. E-H. In 2011, Judge Lenard sentenced him
to four years in prison, FAC ¶¶ 17, 18, finding: “Diveroli and others lied to obtain the contract -they lied about their prior experience. They lied about their references. They lied about AEY.”
RJN Ex. I at 52:2-54:22. The media widely covered Diveroli’s downfall. E.g., Dkt. No. 40 at 4.
B.

The 2011 Rolling Stone Article and Motion Picture Contract

While Diveroli was in prison, journalist Guy Lawson published an article in Rolling
Stone about Packouz and Diveroli. FAC ¶ 21; RJN Ex. N (The Stoner Arms Dealers: How Two
3

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 5 of 27 PageID 1589

American Kids Became Big-Time Weapons Traders, ROLLING STONE (2011)). The feature is told
largely from Packouz’s perspective and quotes him extensively. See id. Shortly after the Rolling
Stone article appeared, Warner secured rights from Lawson to make a motion picture based on
his article. FAC ¶¶ 23-24. Numerous media outlets reported this deal in July 2011, e.g., Dkt.
No. 1 (“Compl.”) ¶¶ 39-40, and noted that Todd Phillips was set “to produce and possibly direct
Arms and Dudes, an adaption of a Rolling Stone article,” id. Ex. 17 at 25.
C.

Diveroli’s Effort to Profit from His Story and Partnership with Ross Reback

In November 2013, Diveroli and Ross Reback formed IE “for the purpose of monetizing
Diveroli’s story.” Id. ¶ 28. In mid-2014—after Phillips had completed a script for War Dogs,
Dkt. No. 40 at 7; Compl. Ex. 26 at 59—Reback contacted Warner and other “Hollywood based
groups,” trying to sell Diveroli’s story, and Warner declined. FAC ¶¶ 31-34, 73 & Exs. A-D.
IE fails to identify any specific producer that “expressed interest” in Diveroli’s project.
Cf. FAC ¶ 73. And while IE generically alleges that it tried to sell the project in 2014 and failed,
id. ¶¶ 31-35 & Exs. A-D, the alleged false promotions it challenges began in 2016, see FAC ¶¶
31-35—years after IE’s alleged Hollywood marketing efforts failed.
D.

The Initial Promotions of War Dogs, This Lawsuit, and Diveroli’s Memoir

Warner began promoting War Dogs in 2016. The movie’s trailers, Facebook page, and
website all said that the movie was “Based On A True Story.” FAC ¶¶ 51-53. As this marketing
campaign began—and three months before War Dogs premiered on August 19, 2016—IE filed
this lawsuit. See Dkt. No. 1. In the suit, IE proclaimed that Diveroli had nothing to do with the
War Dogs movie. Compl. ¶ 101.
Days after filing suit, IE published Diveroli’s memoir, Once a Gun Runner ... The Real
Story. FAC ¶¶ 5, 109, 115. The first-person memoir recounts his life story—his childhood in
Miami, his intimate family relationships, his time in Los Angeles learning the arms trade, his
4

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 6 of 27 PageID 1590

relationship with his longtime girlfriend, his work as an arms dealer, and eventually his arrest,
conviction, and early days in prison. See Dkt. No. 84 (“Gun Runner”). The book contains
exhaustive confessions about the copious amounts of illegal drugs that Diveroli consumed, lies
he told and documents he forged to secure business, how he impersonated and bribed U.S. and
foreign officials, how he did business while “stoned, drunk, coked up,” and his many disputes
with associates. See Portnoi Decl. Ex. A (collecting verbatim excerpts from Gun Runner).
In the book, Diveroli describes himself as a “monster,” Gun Runner at 222, recounts how
his family called him worse, id. at 245, 216, and explains how his arms dealing fueled an “everincreasing desire for more -- more excitement, more alcohol, more drugs, more money.” Id. at
111. Diveroli admits violently attacking, with paintball guns at close range, a security guard who
had annoyed him, id. at 19-20, and he talks about how he and Packouz cut ties and fought over
money: “‘You better pay me, bro!’ yelled Packouz….. ‘Fuck you!’ I replied. ‘I was about to
give you more money then you’ve ever seen in your life and then you got us all fucked up….
You ain’t gettin’ shit!’ Packouz is still waiting for that check.” Id. at 223.
Despite claiming lost book sales, IE offers no book sales data for Gun Runner, and fails
to cite any consumers who declined to buy the book because of promotions they saw for War
Dogs. Nor does IE explain how its self-published book even competed with the movie.
E.

War Dogs and Its Release

War Dogs was released in theaters in August 2016—months after this lawsuit was filed
and Diveroli’s memoir was published. Before War Dogs’ release, the director, screenwriters,
and principal actors granted press interviews. FAC ¶¶ 59, 62, 65-70. In the interviews—from
only a few of which IE selectively quotes, e.g., id. ¶ 65—director Todd Phillips explained that,
while “it was the true story [of War Dogs] that appealed to him” and he “tried to follow what
happened as closely as possible,” “we weren’t making a documentary,” and parts of the movie
5

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 7 of 27 PageID 1591

“didn’t happen.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRnhlO7g1YE. As Phillips also
explained, the movie was written and told through Packouz’s perspective, so “we’re watching
the movie through [David’s] eyes” and it “reflects [his] interpretation” of the story. Id.
Neither Warner nor the War Dogs cast ever stated that Diveroli or IE endorsed the movie
or attested to its “unadulterated truth.” FAC ¶ 2. To the contrary, the actor who played Diveroli
told interviewers that he never spoke to Diveroli. Compl. ¶ 102. And screenwriter Stephen Chin
explained that he added plotlines from his own life to create an entertaining film. RJN Ex. O.
Packouz and Lawson served as consultants for the movie and mentioned it on their
Facebook pages. FAC ¶¶ 55, 60, 63. IE pleads no specifics to sustain a claim that the postings
were authorized by Warner or influenced any consumer’s behavior. Indeed, one of the cited
Lawson postings promoted a book that he published in 2015, not Warner’s movie. Id. ¶ 55.
War Dogs itself is a dark, comedic look, told through Packouz’s eyes, at how Packouz—
down on his luck in business, and recently having gotten his girlfriend pregnant—is lured into
the arms business by his childhood friend Diveroli. The movie depicts how they achieve initial
success, but ultimately part ways over business disputes and are convicted of crimes. The movie
begins by saying it is merely “Based On A True Story,” and ends with the prominent disclaimer:

Dkt. No. 88 (“DVD”) at 00:45, 01:51; see also Tyne v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 336 F.3d 1286,
1288-89 (11th Cir. 2003) (similar disclaimer approvingly cited). Unlike Once a Gun Runner, the
movie does not track Diveroli’s life or delve into his family. Rather, like the trailer cited by IE,
6

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 8 of 27 PageID 1592

see FAC ¶ 51 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWs5qnZnhfo), the movie follows Packouz’s
story and offers broad commentary about “Dick Cheney’s America” during wartime.
F.

The FAC

In its new complaint, IE no longer asserts that Warner stole Diveroli’s story and it does
not challenge that the movie is based on true events. Rather, IE asserts that War Dogs is not
“true” in every respect, FAC ¶¶ 80-83, and it objects to a few sequences in the movie. IE
disputes a scene in which Diveroli tears up his contract with Packouz, a scene in which Diveroli
shoots a gun in public, and the sequence in which Diveroli and Packouz brave the “triangle of
death” to deliver arms to the U.S. Army. Id. IE, of course, neglects to disclose that two of these
“fictionalized” scenes finds a basis in actual events. According to public court records, Packouz
and others filed suit against Diveroli for not honoring his contracts. RJN Exs. J-K. Moreover,
Diveroli admitted, in his book, to lying to business associates, doctoring documents to deceive
them, and engaging in acts of physical violence involving guns in public. Gun Runner at 19-20,
124, 189; Portnoi Decl. Ex. A. As for the third scene, War Dogs writer Stephen Chin disclosed
in public interviews that he fictionalized the “triangle of death” scenes. Infra at 15-16.
In the FAC, IE asserts four causes of action under the Lanham Act and Florida law for
false advertising. Each claim pivots on the premise that Warner marketed War Dogs as the
“unadulterated truth.” FAC ¶ 2. As shown below, this straw-man attack on something that
Warner never said has no merit, and the FAC should be dismissed with prejudice.
III.

The FAC Should Be Dismissed with Prejudice Because IE Cannot State a Claim.
Three pleading requirements govern this Rule 12 motion. First, “only a complaint that

states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,
678 (2009). Conclusory or speculative allegations do not suffice, see id., and allegations need
not be assumed true if there are “obvious alternative explanation[s] [for plaintiff’s harm], which
7

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 9 of 27 PageID 1593

suggest lawful conduct rather than the unlawful conduct the plaintiff would ask the court to
infer.” Am. Dental Ass’n v. Cigna Corp., 605 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir. 2010).
Second, if a Lanham Act claim is “grounded in fraud,” Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading
requirements apply. EcoDisc Tech. AG v. DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corp., 711 F. Supp. 2d
1074, 1085 (C.D. Cal. 2010). While Warner has identified no decision of this District on the
question, the majority of courts apply Rule 9(b) to claims filed under Florida’s Deceptive and
Unfair Trade Practices Act (“FDUTPA”), which has the same elements in this case. 2
Third, Florida enacted its “anti-SLAPP statute” to grant procedural protections to creators
and distributors of First Amendment works—explicitly including “movies.” FLA. STAT. ANN.
§ 768.295(2)(a). Florida prioritizes the “expeditious resolution” of legal claims challenging such
works and entitles defendants to their fees and costs if they prevail in fending off such suits. Id.
§ 768.295(4). Movies enjoy broad First Amendment protection, whether purely fictional or
based on real-life events. See, e.g., Tyne v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 901 So. 2d 802, 810 (Fla.
2005); Tyne v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 204 F. Supp. 2d 1338, 1342 (M.D. Fla. 2002).
“Advertising for constitutionally protected expressive media shares the constitutional immunity
of the media use itself.” 2 J. McCarthy, THE RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY & PRIVACY § 8.69 (2016).
A.

IE’s Claims All Run Afoul of the First Amendment.

Neither the Lanham Act nor Florida law, under which IE asserts claims, may regulate the
statements at issue here promoting War Dogs. By Congress’s design, the Lanham Act regulates
only “commercial speech,” as that term is defined in the First Amendment case law. See Gordon

2

See, e.g., Stires v. Carnival Corp., 243 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1322 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (applying
Rule 9(b) test); Fla. Digital Network, Inc. v. N. Telecom, Inc., 2006 WL 2523163, at *5 (M.D.
Fla. Aug. 30, 2006) (same); WrestleReunion, LLC v. Live Nation Television Holdings, Inc., 2008
WL 3048859, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 4, 2008) (same); Global Tech LED, LLC v. Hilumz Int’l
Corp., 2016 WL 3059390, at *3 (M.D. Fla. May 31, 2016) (same elements when fraud alleged).

& Breach Sci. Publ’rs S.A. v. Am. Inst. of Physics, 859 F. Supp. 1521, 1533 (S.D.N.Y. 1994);
Suntree Techs., Inc. v. Ecosense Int’l, Inc., 693 F.3d 1338, 1349 (11th Cir. 2012) (adopting the
analysis in Gordon); Univ. of Ala. Bd. of Trs. v. New Life Art, Inc., 683 F.3d 1266, 1277 (11th
Cir. 2012) (Lanham Act must “be read narrowly to avoid impinging on [protected] speech”). 3
Commercial speech is narrowly construed as speech that “does no more than propose a
commercial transaction,” or which is “related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and
its audience.” City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 421-22 (1993)
(italics added). When commercial and noncommercial speech are “intertwined,” the speech as a
whole must be shielded, as any other rule would create “uncertainty” and chill speech. Riley v.
Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 794-96 (1988); see Bolger v. Youngs Drug
Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 66 (1983) (commercial speech must be “examined carefully to ensure
that speech deserving of greater constitutional protection is not inadvertently suppressed”).
When speakers “have purposes beyond the solely commercial”—e.g., a political point of
view they want to express, or “the product they advertise is a constitutionally protected one”—
that speech is noncommercial and thus outside the scope of the Lanham Act and any state-law
analogue. Gordon, 859 F. Supp. at 1540. IE bears the burden of showing that the statements it
challenges are each solely commercial and “undeserving of full First Amendment protection.”
Id.
IE cannot make that showing. Each statement it challenges promotes a movie or a book
(i.e., constitutionally protected works), excerpts parts of the movie’s contents to promote it,
and/or discusses the creative process, artistic vision, political motivation behind the movie’s

3

Courts similarly interpret the FDUTPA and Florida’s unfair competition law. See, e.g.,
Gorran v. Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., 279 F. App’x 40, 41 (2d Cir. 2008) (FDUTPA); Tobinick v.
Novella, 142 F. Supp. 3d 1275, 1283 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (state-law unfair competition).
9

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 11 of 27 PageID 1595

making. Such speech cannot be regulated, and if IE objects to the statements challenged in the
FAC, its remedy is to engage in more speech, not to pursue a lawsuit.
B.

IE’s Claims Also All Fail Because It Has Not Pled and Cannot Plead a Single
False or Misleading Statement.

All four counts in IE’s complaint also share the common element that it must allege that
Warner made a false or misleading statement in a commercial promotion. 4 IE cannot meet this
threshold element for each of its claims for two main reasons: (i) IE’s conclusory attacks on
what it perceives Warner to have said are irrelevant—it is Warner’s specific statements that
matter; and (ii) when one examines the 18 specific statements that IE targets, none is actionable.
Before delving into the 18 specific statements that IE cites, it must be noted that IE’s
claims that Warner “engaged in a media blitz” or had a “chief marketing mantra” to sell War
Dogs as Diveroli’s “true story,” FAC ¶¶ 50, 58, are irrelevant. Such conclusory allegations do
not meet Iqbal’s or Rule 9’s specificity tests. See supra at 7-8.
Nor are false-advertising claims judged at some gestalt level of what a plaintiff argues an
advertising campaign conveyed. Courts “must consider each representation individually, as
opposed to grouping them as an overall advertising campaign.” Ameritox, Ltd. v. Millennium
Labs., Inc., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1304, 1312 (M.D. Fla. 2012); Johnson, 299 F.3d at 1248 & n.4
(Eleventh Circuit reversing district court that took gestalt approach). Moreover, in looking at

4

The elements of IE’s Count I require (1) a false or misleading statement; (2) that actually
deceived consumers or had the tendency to deceive a substantial portion of the targeted audience;
(3) materially deceived or was likely to influence purchasing decisions; (4) where defendant’s
products traveled in interstate commerce; and (5) the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured
by causally related declining sales or loss of goodwill. Ameritox, Ltd. v. Millennium Labs., Inc.,
2012 WL 33155, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 6, 2012). The elements of IE’s Count III (Lanham Act Damages) differ only insofar as it must allege an actual injury resulting from actual consumer
deception. See Harper House, Inc. v. Thomas Nelson, Inc., 889 F.2d 197, 210 (9th Cir. 1989).
The elements of IE’s Counts II and IV (FDUTPA - Injunctive Relief and Unfair Competition)
are the same as their Lanham Act analogues. See Suntree, 693 F.3d at 1345; infra at 22-23.
10

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 12 of 27 PageID 1596

any one specific promotion, courts must study its entire context, not just snippets that plaintiff
chose to quote. See id.; Osmose, Inc. v. Viance, LLC, 612 F.3d 1298, 1311 (11th Cir. 2010).
As shown below, none of the 18 statements that IE challenges survives these tests:
1. The War Dogs Trailers. In the section of the FAC titled “False Advertising”—in
which IE complains that Warner engaged in a “media blitz to promote War Dogs as a true
story”—IE cites the War Dogs trailers, and alleges that in one trailer a nameplate bearing
Diveroli’s name appears in one shot sitting atop a desk. FAC ¶¶ 50, 51, 53.
There is nothing actionable in the trailers. To begin, while a movie trailer helps sell a
movie, “it is protected under the First Amendment as it is a part of a protected expressive work.”
Esch v. Universal Pictures Co., 2010 WL 5600989, at *6 (N.D. Ala. Nov. 2, 2010) (trailer is
expressive work that cannot be regulated under state law); Montgomery v. Montgomery, 60
S.W.3d 524, 529 (Ky. 2001) (same; music video used to promote album).
Even if one could assert a claim based on the trailers’ content (and IE cannot, see id.),
they are not misleading. They say the movie is “Based On A True Story,” see FAC ¶ 51 (links to
trailers), and courts have held that such language signifies that a movie is obviously fictionalized
in part. See, e.g., Tyne, 901 So. 2d at 810; Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496,
513 (1991); Partington v. Bugliosi, 56 F.3d 1147, 1155 (9th Cir. 1995); Greenspan v. Random
House, Inc., 859 F. Supp. 2d 206, 220 (D. Mass. 2012). 5 IE makes the conclusory claim that the
“trailers represent[] to consumers that War Dogs is true,” FAC ¶ 53, but IE tellingly cannot cite
any specific place where the trailers (or Warner) made this unqualified claim.

As for the “Efraim Diveroli” nameplate on the desk, id.—which appears for a fleeting
moment in one trailer—no one owns historical facts like names, and it has long been held that
using a real person’s name to promote a movie based on his life is not a commercial activity, but
rather constitutionally protected speech. See Tyne, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 1341; Tyne, 425 F.3d at
1364; Seale v. Gramercy Pictures, 949 F. Supp. 331, 337 (E.D. Pa. 1996); Dkt. No. 40 at 16-19.
2 & 3. The War Dogs Facebook Page and Website. Other than citing these two media
sources and the number of followers that the Facebook page had, see FAC ¶ 52, IE challenges no
specifics. Nor can it fairly. Both the Facebook page and website make plain that War Dogs is
“Based on a true story,” e.g., http://www.wardogsthemovie.com/story/, and there are no
representations that the movie is entirely true or endorsed by Diveroli.
4. Diveroli’s Picture. IE pastes a page from a Rolling Stone website, which includes
pictures of the real Diveroli and Packouz, to suggest Warner used Diveroli’s image to promote
its movie. FAC ¶ 54. Yet IE does not and cannot allege that Warner controls the content of
Rolling Stone. The excerpted article also makes plain that the movie is “based on a true story,”
id.—and no more. And in any event, even had Warner published Diveroli’s image, courts have
held that “use of a person’s … likeness to advertise a … motion picture concerning that
individual is not actionable” but rather is protected as free speech. Seale, 949 F. Supp. at 336.
5. The War Dogs Movie Poster. IE complains that the War Dogs movie poster lifted the
cliché “An American Dream” from Diveroli’s book and IE’s promotional materials. FAC ¶ 56.
Not only are movie posters protected speech, see Whitehurst v. Showtime Networks, Inc., 2009
WL 3052663, at *8 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 22, 2009) (packaging of DVD), and are clichés not
copyrightable, see Greenspan, 859 F. Supp. 2d at 216, but IE concedes it is dropping this claim,
given that the tagline appears in Lawson’s Rolling Stone article, which predated Diveroli’s book

12

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 14 of 27 PageID 1598

publication by five years. RJN Ex. N at 19. The reference to “An American Dream” is not
actionable, in any event. “The Lanham Act regulates only representations of fact—statements
that are ‘capable of being proven false.’” Ameritox, 889 F. Supp. 2d at 1317 (italics added). It
does not regulate clichés.
6-8. Lawson & Packouz Facebook Posts. IE complains that Lawson invited readers in
March 2016 to “[c]heck out the book that inspired the movie.” FAC ¶ 55. To be actionable,
however, the statement must be “for the purpose of influencing consumers to buy defendant’s
goods or services.” Suntree, 693 F.3d at 1349 (italics added). Lawson asks readers to buy his
book, not to see Warner’s movie, and thus Warner cannot be held liable based on this post.
Furthermore, Lawson’s measured statement that his book “inspired” the movie is not a claim that
the movie is true in all respects—just the opposite. E.g., Muzikowski v. Paramount Pictures
Corp., 477 F.3d 899, 908 (7th Cir. 2007) (district court held phrase “inspired by a true story” is
literally true even if resulting work is not a true account of plaintiff’s story). Finally, other than
making the conclusory assertion that Lawson acted as Warner’s “agent” in making this Facebook
post, IE offers no specific facts to support this agency claim, meaning it “fails” under Iqbal.
Azure, LLC v. Figueras Seating U.S.A., Inc., 2013 WL 12093811, at *3 (S.D. Fla. July 18, 2013).
IE’s other complaints about Lawson’s and Packouz’s Facebook posts fail for similar
reasons. FAC ¶¶ 60, 63. Both are posts on Lawson’s and Packouz’s personal Facebooks. To be
actionable, the statements had to be made by Warner, for the purposes of influencing consumers,
and had to be “disseminated sufficiently to the relevant purchasing public.” Suntree, 693 F.3d at
1349. IE pleads no specifics to establish that statements posted on the men’s personal Facebooks
were made as Warner’s agents, cf. Azure, 2013 WL 12093811, at *3, or for the purpose of
advertising to the public generally rather than to communicate with their 1,000 or so Facebook

13

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 15 of 27 PageID 1599

friends. Such limited posting does not give rise to a claim, especially when one compares IE’s
claim that the official War Dogs Facebook page had 200,000 followers and the War Dogs trailers
were seen 13.5 million times, FAC ¶¶ 51-52, to images in the FAC showing that Lawson’s post
garnered 89 “reactions,” and had only 14 comments, id. ¶¶ 60, 63; RJN Exs. R, T.
As for Lawson’s stated opinion that the film is “[f]ast, funny, and amazingly close to the
real truth of the story,” FAC ¶ 60, “[s]tatements of opinion are generally not actionable,”
Osmose, 612 F.3d at 1311, and nor is “puffery,” Intertape Polymer Corp. v. Inspired Techs., Inc.,
725 F. Supp. 2d 1319, 1333 (M.D. Fla. 2010). Packouz’s 25-word note comparing his life to the
movie’s trailer and opinions about how close the movie tracks his story, FAC ¶ 63, is likewise
not actionable. Packouz also qualifies this boast in a comment on the thread, explaining the
“true” story could be found in the 2015 book that Guy Lawson wrote about him, not the War
Dogs movie. RJN Ex. T.
9. The Changed Lawson Book Title. IE complains that Lawson changed the name of his
book from Arms and the Dudes to War Dogs in June 2016. FAC ¶ 61. Of course, the title of a
book is protected speech, and authors have “significant First Amendment interest in choosing an
appropriate title for his or her work.” Twin Peaks Prods., Inc. v. Publ’ns Int’l, Ltd., 996 F.2d
1366, 1379 (2d Cir. 1993). Even if IE could hold Warner liable for Lawson’s artistic choice (and
it cannot), IE’s claim misses the mark. While IE complains that Lawson sold his book as the
“true story” and made reference to Warner’s movie in doing so, the book’s new cover makes
plain that the story that Lawson recounts merely “Inspired The Movie.” FAC ¶ 61. Nowhere
does it or Lawson say that the movie is true in all respects. And as the movie’s disclaimer makes
clear, while the movie was “based on” Lawson’s Rolling Stone article, it “fictionalized … events,
scenes, and time sequences” and “created and composited” dialogue and characters. Supra at 6.

14

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 16 of 27 PageID 1600

10. Argentinian Facebook Post. IE cites a September 2016 Facebook post by Warner
Bros. Pictures Argentina, which IE translated from Spanish using Facebook’s auto-translate tool.
See FAC ¶ 64 (“Rate this translation”). The translation is nonsensical (“Meet the history of
efraim diveroli and David Packouz in #amigosdearmas”), and not actionable as a statement of
fact. In any event, historical facts, including the use of real names quoted above, are fair game
when promoting a movie. Supra at 12, 13. Lastly, the “Lanham Act applies extraterritorially if
and only if there is a substantial effect on [U.S.] commerce,” NewMarkets Partners LLC v.
Oppenheim, 638 F. Supp. 2d 394, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), none of which IE properly alleges.
11-18. Filmmaker Interviews. Lastly, IE excerpts eight statements from the director,
writers, and two actors in War Dogs—out of hundreds they made—to accuse Warner of falsely
advertising War Dogs. Where possible, Warner has provided the Court with the underlying
sources from which IE appears to have pulled these statements. See RJN at 2-3 & Exs. O-Q.
None is actionable under the Lanham Act or Florida law. First, Warner did not author the
statements and many were edited by media outlets, which made First Amendment protected
judgments about the selection, quantity, and arrangement of the interview segments chosen for
inclusion. These decisions are not attributable to Warner. The interviews also delve into the
creative processes of the director, writers, and actors. This means that none of the interviews can
be regulated by the Lanham Act or Florida law. Again, the statutes regulate only “commercial
speech”—or “expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.”
Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 561 (1980) (italics
added); Riley, 487 U.S. at 796 (speech that “inextricably intertwine[s]” both noncommercial and
commercial elements is “fully protected expression”); Parks v. LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437,
449 (6th Cir. 2003); Gordon, 859 F. Supp. at 1540.

15

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 17 of 27 PageID 1601

None of the creator interviews that IE challenges—either the statements these artists
made, or the journalistic judgments that led to their editing—is purely “commercial speech,” and
thus none can be the subject of a Lanham Act or state-law claim. Id. That should begin and end
the inquiry on these final eight challenged statements, but if the Court wishes to delve into the
specifics of each of the eight cited interviews, none is actionable under any theory, in any event:
• IE begins by attacking an interview that Stephen Chin (one of the screenwriters) gave
in which he said he was “very interested in finding the real story” when writing War Dogs and
wanted to be “deeply true” to the story. FAC ¶ 62. What IE omits from the FAC is the rest of
the interview. In it, Chin talks openly about how he added stories from his own life—including
his trip through the “triangle of death,” which Diveroli and Packouz never made—to tell a more
compelling story, “about the war[,] the economics of war, [and] the giant military industrial
complex.” RJN Ex. O. Such context is key to any false advertising claim, supra at 2-3, 10-11,
and IE cannot omit it, in asserting that War Dogs was sold as “unadulterated truth,” FAC ¶ 2.
• IE quotes Todd Phillips (the director and writer) four times, as saying that “truth is
stranger than fiction”; “it was really the reality, the idea that it was a true story that appealed to
me”; filmmakers “stick to the facts as much as we can”; and audiences are attracted to the fact
that War Dogs “was based on a real story.” FAC ¶¶ 65-66, 68, 70. Again, IE omits from the
FAC Phillips’ further comments in these interviews. He said repeatedly that War Dogs “is not a
documentary,” that parts of it “didn’t happen,” and that, in making the movie, he had to “present
information in a particular way—you have to dumb it down or entertainment it up—just to get
people to understand.” RJN Ex. Q; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRnhlO7g1YE. He also
said he loves “when you take the seeds of the truth or the seeds of something real and build on
it”—making clear the movie is part fiction. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8Ip3khf8.

16

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 18 of 27 PageID 1602

• IE quotes Miles Teller (who played Packouz) twice as saying “these are real people”
who “are still alive,” and that he “loves the words ‘based on a true story.’” FAC ¶¶ 59, 69. The
former statement is true, and the latter expresses an artistic opinion. Neither is actionable.
• Jonah Hill (who plays Diveroli) is quoted as describing War Dogs as “a story that’s so
crazy you can’t believe it actually happened,” and “one of the craziest movies I’ve ever been in –
in a great way. And it’s all true.” FAC ¶ 67. Statements that a movie is “so crazy” and “one of
the craziest” an actor worked in are non-actionable opinion and puffery. Castrol Inc. v. Pennzoil
Co., 987 F.2d 939, 945 (3d Cir. 1993) (“Puffery is an exaggeration or overstatement expressed in
broad, vague, and commendatory language.”). The “it’s all true” comment, which follows this
puffery, appears at the end of a two-paragraph Film Takeout post on Facebook from January 2,
2016—four months before Diveroli released his book, and seven months before the movie was
released. See Compl. ¶ 102; RJN Ex. U. There is no indication that any specific consumer saw
the post, and, if anyone did see it, the post also notes that the movie is “Based on” the Rolling
Stone article, and that Diveroli was not involved in the movie’s making. Id. Unlike commercial
speech, which “does no more than propose a commercial transaction,” Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66,
Hill’s brief artistic commentary is non-actionable opinion and cannot be so regulated.
C.

IE’s Claims Fail Because It Cannot Meet Several Other Required Elements.

1. The 18 Statements Did Not Materially Deceive Consumers. To sustain its damages
claims (in Count II and IV), IE must plead both the existence of a deception and the fact that the
deception had a “material effect” on purchasing decisions. Johnson, 299 F.3d at 1247. IE does
not identify a single consumer who made a purchasing decision, much less in the implausible
manner that IE theorizes—i.e., that the consumer was poised to see War Dogs or buy Once a
Gun Runner (even though the two are very different media and were released months apart from
each other); that the consumer (based on an unidentified false statement among the 18)
17

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 19 of 27 PageID 1603

mistakenly believed that War Dogs was Diveroli’s “true” story (even though the cover of
Diveroli’s book and Author’s Note both say that his book, and not the movie, are the “Real
Story”); and none of the other obvious innocent factors (e.g., a great writer and director for War
Dogs, the cast, or vivid cinematography and an appealing soundtrack) drove the consumer’s
buying decision. Accounting for these specifics is required under Iqbal, and pursuant to the
Lanham Act and Florida law, see supra at 7-8, 10 & n.4, yet IE fails to plead any of them.
Indeed, to seek damages, IE “must” establish this materiality element even if Warner’s
ads were “literally false.” Johnson, 299 F.3d at 1251; see Swatch S.A. v. New City, Inc., 454 F.
Supp. 2d 1245, 1251-52 (S.D. Fla. 2006) (“not all deceptions affect consumer decisions”);
5 McCarthy, supra, §§ 27:36, 27:42. Because the Court cannot assume that consumers viewed
“the ad campaign as a whole,” Johnson, 299 F.3d at 1248, to survive this motion, IE must thus
identify specific statements—e.g., one of the interviews, a Facebook post, or a trailer—and show
how the statement actually deceived specific consumers. IE does not and cannot plead this.
IE’s injunction claims (Counts I and III) are not only asserted months too late, but to
sustain such claims, IE had to plead enough specifics to show how “reasonable” consumers
would be deceived by Warner’s promotions. Pernod Ricard USA, LLC v. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc.,
653 F.3d 241, 253 (3d Cir. 2011). This theory of materiality is also implausible. Warner said
the movie was “Based On A True Story,” and its creators said it was fictionalized in part and
“not a documentary.” Supra at 11-12, 16. In addition, even if such disclaimers had not been
made (and they were), courts recognize that reasonable consumers of movies “are aware … that
parts of such programs are more fiction than fact.” Partington, 56 F.3d at 1155. Movies have to
compress time; use actors to play real people; and, unlike documentaries, do not use historical
footage or witness interviews to represent “verifiable fact.” Id. This reasonable understanding

18

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 20 of 27 PageID 1604

that movies are part fiction—essential to a free marketplace of ideas—extends across media and
countries. See. e.g., Greenspan, 859 F. Supp. 2d at 220 (advertising book as “nonfiction” “only
means that the literature is based on true stories or events, not that every statement is in fact
demonstrably true”); Masson, 501 U.S. at 513; Bundesverfassungsgericht [BVerfG] [Federal
Constitutional Court] Jun. 13, 2007, 84 (Ger.) (recognizing that consumers of movies based on
true events are aware that they do not present events as they actually occurred) (translation at
https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/EN/2007/06/rs20070613
_1bvr178305en.html).
IE’s claims fail to meet the materiality test for yet a further reason. IE complains of two
core untruths in the two-hour War Dogs movie, both relating to Diveroli’s character. First, it
complains that the film portrays Diveroli as “an unethical business-person” and shows him as
tearing up a written contract with Packouz. FAC ¶ 80. Yet IE fails to explain how this
dramatization is sufficiently material, such that it would persuade consumers to go see War Dogs
instead of purchasing Diveroli’s book. This scene was not included in the advertisements for
War Dogs, so IE cannot allege that it influenced purchasing decisions. Moreover, in Diveroli’s
own biography, he concedes a long list of unethical misdeeds. The list includes his defrauding
the United States (for which he was convicted); repeatedly lying to business counterparts about
his religion, identity, existence of his family, and the terms of contracts; altering and creating
documents to mislead counterparts; and not paying Packouz or an Albanian box manufacturer
Kosta Trebicka. Compare FAC ¶ 82, with Gun Runner at 32, 38, 46, 83, 117, 124, 189; Portnoi
Decl. Ex. A. IE also omits that Packouz and other associates sued Diveroli and testified under
oath that he cheated them. RJN Exs. L at 111:21-112:3, M at 98:10-22, 153:7-154:13. And IE
ignores that Judge Lenard, in sentencing Diveroli—at a hearing packed with reporters, see Gun

19

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 21 of 27 PageID 1605

Runner at 246—expressly found that he “lied to obtain the [Afghan] contract,” and “lied” about
his experience, references, and company. RJN Ex. I at 52:2-54:22.
Second, IE asserts that War Dogs includes misleading scenes “in which Diveroli engages
in exceedingly reckless and deadly behavior.” FAC ¶ 83. Again, IE fails to show how the scene
it complains about—Diveroli shooting a gun in the air in Miami—misled consumers, altered
their buying decisions, or rendered the War Dogs promotions actionable. Nor could IE plead
such a theory in any way that would meet the plausibility test required by Iqbal. Supra at 7-8.
Diveroli’s autobiography exhaustively chronicles his violent, reckless conduct. He boasts
about brutally ambushing a security guard in a close-range paintball-gun attack, which he
describes as “incredibly reckless.” Gun Runner at 19-20. He details his repeated drunk driving,
fist fights, a violent confrontation with a girlfriend, rampant drug and alcohol abuse, and chronic
infidelity to his girlfriends and extensive use of prostitutes. Portnoi Decl. Ex. A. Diveroli refers
to himself becoming “more and more reckless” and his mother describes him as a “reckless
train.” Gun Runner at 209, 250. And the book also includes numerous pictures of Diveroli with
guns and the admission that Diveroli violated his parole by possessing a gun. See id. at 240.
Indeed, Diveroli concedes his reckless behavior was so well-known and publicly
documented that when people with whom he tried to associate ran a quick Google search on him,
they were stunned. See Gun Runner at 212-13, 236. “When I sat down, the med student was
staring at her iPhone with her mouth open, not slightly ajar—this chick could have caught flies.
‘Everything okay?’ I asked, and she held her cell out … so I could see my DUI mug shot.
Fucking Google! ‘Who are you?’ she asked, in an extremely snobbish tone, and then looked at
her iPhone. ‘A restraining order, battery, domestic violence, two DUIs … and … international
gun running???” Id. at 213. In light of such overwhelming public admissions of misconduct

20

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 22 of 27 PageID 1606

proffered by Diveroli himself, it is implausible that consumers were materially misled by War
Dogs or its promotion.
2. IE’s Lanham Act Claims Also Fail the Lexmark Zone-of-Interests and Proximate
Causation Tests. To state a Lanham Act claim, IE’s claims must “‘fall within the zone of
interests protected by the’” Act, which in a “false advertising” case requires that it “must allege
an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control
Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1388, 1390 (2014). To establish such an injury, IE must
plead a plausible theory of proximate causation—running from the asserted false ads to direct,
tangible, non-speculative harms. Id. at 1391 & n.6. Such causation “must be adequately alleged
at the pleading stage in order for the case to proceed,” id., and “[n]either an anticompetitive
purpose nor consumer deception establishes injury,” Global Tech, 2016 WL 3059390, at *3;
Duty Free Ams., Inc. v. Estee Lauder Cos., 797 F.3d 1248, 1277 (11th Cir. 2015).
IE hints at three injuries, but each fails the Lexmark test. First, it suggests its “goodwill”
was harmed, FAC ¶ 113, but it alleges no specifics. IE is the plaintiff here (not Diveroli), and
yet IE pleads nothing about its reputation, other than to note that it was created to “monetize[ ]
Diveroli’s story.” Id. ¶ 28; cf. Black Diamond Land Mgmt., LLC v. Twin Pines Coal Co., 2016
WL 3617974, at *14 (N.D. Ala. July 6, 2016) (complaint for lost business reputation dismissed
for failure to show company’s commercial activity). There is also no allegation that Warner
“disparaged” IE—meaning this goodwill theory is inapt. Lexmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1394.
Second, as discussed above, IE intimates that it lost book sales, FAC ¶ 75, but it does not
detail how its sales (if there were ever any of substance) declined in response to any allegedly
misleading ad. Its speculation that its sales were hurt “stretch[es] proximate causation” too far,
Lexmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1394 (need “something close to a 1:1 relationship” between false ads and

21

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 23 of 27 PageID 1607

lost sales), and fails to account for obvious plausible “alternative” causes and effects, Am.
Dental, 605 F.3d at 1290. These alternative causes include the equally (if not more) likely
reality that the expansive promotion of War Dogs actually heightened awareness of Diveroli,
which in turn would have increased interest in his book and, thus, generated sales. It also
ignores the basic sequence of events. IE released Diveroli’s book (and his version of events)
four months before Warner released War Dogs. If anything, IE preempted Warner, and
capitalized on the movie.
Third, IE contends that several “Hollywood based groups” who expressed an interest in
Diveroli’s book “declined to move forward due to the Warner Bros. launch of War Dogs.” FAC
¶ 73. IE fails to allege the identity of any of these “groups,” when and how they allegedly
communicated their decisions, or how an ad campaign that ran in 2016 interfered with a project
that IE unsuccessfully pitched in 2014. Indeed, in its first complaint, filed in April 2016, IE
conceded away any plausible chain of causation. In the complaint, IE alleged that its Hollywood
sources had already rejected IE’s Diveroli project, see Compl. ¶ 103, months before Warner
made many of the promotional statements that IE now challenges, see, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 60-65, 68.
IE also fails to account for “obvious alternative explanation[s]” for its alleged harm. Am.
Dental, 605 F.3d at 1290. Among the many innocent, obvious reasons that those in Hollywood
would pass on doing business with IE are that Diveroli is a convicted fraudster, and in his book,
he calls himself a “monster,” who was so unlikeable, that his friends abandoned him. Gun
Runner at 222. The book itself would also give many producers pause were any in Hollywood
ever to read it: It exposes Diveroli’s dark views about women and other cultures, and it makes a
series of personal attacks on Diveroli’s family, doctors, lawyers, friends, and colleagues. Id. at
16, 28, 55, 57-58, 78-79, 89, 99, 109, 205-06, 218; Portnoi Decl. Ex. A.

22

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 24 of 27 PageID 1608

3. IE’s Florida Law Claims Are Derivative of the Lanham Act Claims and Must Be
Dismissed. IE’s Florida state law claims merely recycle its Lanham Act claims; they add no new
facts; and they fail for the same reasons that IE’s Lanham Act claims fail. “The Eleventh Circuit
has held that [t]he success of [a plaintiff’s] FDUTPA claims is tied to the federal Lanham Act
claims for [] false advertising,” Global Tech, 2016 WL 3059390, at *3, and “based on the [ ]
conclusion above that [IE] failed to state a plausible claim under the Lanham Act, its” parallel
state law claims can be dismissed, Ameritox, 2012 WL 33155, at *5; Suntree, 693 F.3d at 1345.
IV.

Warner Is Entitled to Its Fees and Costs.
Florida recently amended its anti-SLAPP statute, recognizing the need to protect “free

speech in connection with public issues.” FLA. STAT. ANN. § 768.295(1). The statute defines
“[f]ree speech in connection with public issues” as “any written or oral statement” made “in
connection with [a] movie”—protecting both “movies” themselves and promotions made “in
connection with them.” Id. § 768.295(2)(a); see Samuel Morley, Florida’s Expanded AntiSLAPP Law: More Protection for Targeted Speakers, 90 FLA. B.J. 17, 18 (2016).
Florida prioritizes the “expeditious resolution” of anti-SLAPP motions and instructs that
“[t]he court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred,” FLA.
STAT. ANN. § 768.295(4) (italics added). “Effective anti-SLAPP statutes” exist to “make it
easier and cheaper to terminate such lawsuits at early stages,” and courts should recognize “the
mere filing and pendency of [such a lawsuit] chills speech.” Morley, supra, at 17.
IE’s complaint falls squarely within the anti-SLAPP statute. Its claims are without merit
(as shown above), and they are aimed directly at First Amendment-protected activities—i.e.,
making and promoting a movie. IE also seeks to chill speech on matters of significant public
concern—e.g., war profiteering, government mismanagement, and criminal misconduct. See
Sarver v. Chartier, 813 F.3d 891, 902, 905 (9th Cir. 2016) (movie The Hurt Locker “fully
23

Case 8:16-cv-01302-MSS-AAS Document 89 Filed 12/01/16 Page 25 of 27 PageID 1609

protected under the First Amendment”; its “focus on the conduct of the Iraq War” was plainly
“of public concern”). Indeed, it is hard to imagine a case more worthy of anti-SLAPP protection.
See, e.g., Tamkin v. CBS Broad., Inc., 193 Cal. App. 4th 133, 144-45 (2011) (“creative process
must be unfettered”; SLAPPing claims challenging contents and promotion of TV show).
If and when the Court grants this Motion, Warner will file a motion for an award of (and
submit to the Court for review) its full fees and costs. See Blackburn v. ABC Legal Servs., Inc.,
2012 WL 1067632, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2012). These fees and costs are substantial, given
that IE initially pursued one invalid theory of the case and extensive discovery in aid of it—
which Warner had to move to dismiss and seek to stay on behalf of itself and many other
defendants. IE’s new counsel has focused on a new theory of the case, but it is equally barred by
the First Amendment and other legal principles.
For the anti-SLAPP statute and Iqbal to work, courts must enforce their procedural
safeguards—which include not permitting serial amendments, preventing invasive discovery,
and awarding fees and costs. See Morley, supra, at 24 (if courts are unwilling to strike SLAPP
suits quickly, defendants will become “entangled in burdensome litigation, defeating the law’s
central purpose”); Michel v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 816 F.3d 686, 702 (11th Cir. 2016) (“Forcing
[defendants] to defend inappropriate suits through expensive discovery proceedings,” based on a
complaint that fails to meet Iqbal, “would constrict” those freedoms and “chill free speech.”).
This case should be no exception, and IE should be held accountable under Florida’s antiSLAPP law. 6

Warner also reserves its rights to seek its fees and costs under the Lanham Act. See 15
U.S.C. § 1117(a); Tire Kingdom, Inc. v. Morgan Tire & Auto, Inc., 253 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th
Cir. 2001). To the extent IE is not capitalized in a way to pay such fees or costs, Warner
reserves its rights to seek its fees and costs from IE’s principals.

V.

Conclusion
Warner’s Motion should be granted. The defects in IE’s complaint cannot be cured by

amendment, and this case should be dismissed with prejudice.
WHEREFORE, Warner Bros. respectfully moves for the entry of an order dismissing the
FAC with prejudice, declaring this case an anti-SLAPP suit, and granting such other and further
relief as the Court deems just and proper.
