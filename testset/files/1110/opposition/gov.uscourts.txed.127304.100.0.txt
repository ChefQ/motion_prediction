in the Eastern District of Texas (“District” or “EDTX”) is improper—but because venue in the
District of Northern California (“Transferee District” or “NDCA”) is allegedly more convenient.
The facts and the law demonstrate that the Motion to transfer must be denied. Nearly
half of the remaining parties are resident in this District, a fact that strongly supports keeping the
case in this District Court. Plaintiff is entitled to substantial deference in its choice of venue.
Moving Defendants have simply failed to meet their substantial burden of showing that the
relevant facts “clearly” support transfer. In fact, the Moving Defendants have failed to identify
any facts to support their motion. Instead, they have repeatedly tried to mislead the Court as to
the proper standard and are asking this Court to disregard the substantial deference routinely
afforded to a plaintiff’s choice of venue. The Moving Defendants’ argument is contrary to the
law of this District. Furthermore, Moving Defendants have failed to assert any substantiated
facts to show meaningful inconvenience should this Court deny transfer.
Accordingly, Hopewell respectfully requests the Court deny Moving Defendants’ Motion
to Transfer Venue.
II.

BACKGROUND
Hopewell brought this suit against Adobe, Apple, HTC, LG, Motorola Mobility, Inc.2

(“Motorola), Nokia, Inc. (“Nokia), Opera Software ASA (“Opera”), Palm, Inc. (“Palm”),
Quickoffice, Samsung, and SEA on December 22, 2010 alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.
7,171,625 (“the ’625 Patent”). Hopewell, as alleged in the Complaint, is a Texas limited liability
company and maintains its principal place of business at 101 East Park Blvd, Suite 600, Plano
Texas 75074, a resident of the Eastern District of Texas. See Complaint (Dkt. # 1), ¶¶ 2.

2

Hopewell originally filed suit against Motorola, Inc. but due to Motorola, Inc’s spinoff of its operations, Motorola
Mobility, Inc was substituted.

Filed 07/07/11 Page 3 of 12

Of the original Defendants, Motorola, Nokia, Opera, and Apple have since licensed the
’625 Patent and have been dismissed from this case with prejudice. Of the Moving Defendants,
only Adobe has a principal place of business in the Northern District of California. See
Complaint [Dkt. # 1], ¶¶ 3.
As admitted by the Moving Defendants, both Quickoffice and Samsung have their
principal places of business in the Eastern District of Texas. See Motion [Dkt #89], pg 3.
Neither LG, HTC, nor SEA has its principal place of business in the Northern District of
California.
The only non-moving Defendant, Palm, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the HewlettPackard Company. The Hewlett-Packard Company has its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto,
CA but directs its U.S. operations from its facility in Houston, TX. See [Exh. A, Screenshot of

III.

THIS ACTION SHOULD REMAIN IN THIS DISTRICT.
A.

Standard of Law

The Moving Defendants must “clearly” show good cause to move venue to the
Transferee District. 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (2009) (controlling transfer “in the interest of justice”);
Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. Bell Marine Serv., Inc., 321 F.2d 53, 56 (5th Cir. 1963) (“[O]f course,
he who seeks the transfer must show good cause.”); In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 545 F.3d 304,
315 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (“This ‘good cause’ burden reflects the appropriate deference to
which the plaintiff[’]s choice of venue is entitled.”). Thus, “when the transferee venue is not
clearly more convenient than the venue chosen by the plaintiff, the plaintiff[’]s choice should be
respected.” Id. (emphasis added). A motion to transfer venue should only be granted upon a
showing that the transferee venue is “clearly more convenient” than the venue chosen by the

3

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

Filed 07/07/11 Page 4 of 12

plaintiff. In re Nintendo Co., 589 F.3d 1194, 1197 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Genentech, Inc., 566
F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re TS Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315, 1319 (Fed. Cir.
2008)
To transfer venue, this Court must answer two inquiries in the affirmative: (i) if the action
“might have been brought” in the Northern District of California, the Transferee District; and (ii)
if so, is the transfer “clearly” for the convenience of the parties based on the private and public
factors adopted by the Fifth Circuit. Id. at 312, 315. The private factors are:
(1) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of
compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses; (3) the cost of
attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical problems that make
trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.
Id. at 1315 (citation omitted); Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947); Nintendo, 589
F.3d at 1198; Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1342; TS Tech., 551 F.3d at 1319. The public interest
factors for the Court to consider in this analysis are:
(1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local
interest in having localized interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the
forum with the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of
unnecessary problems of conflict of laws [or in] the application of foreign law.
Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at 315 (citation omitted); Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501 at 508-09; Nintendo, 589
F.3d at 1198; Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1342; TS Tech., 551 F.3d at 1319.
Moving Defendants must offer concrete facts to support transfer. “Defendants seeking a
transfer cannot carry their burden by merely making unsupported assertions, but rather they must
properly establish relevant venue facts . . . .” In re Triton Ltd. Sec. Litig., 70 F. Supp. 2d 678,
688 (E.D. Tex. 1999).
Moving Defendants’ vague assertions fall short of “clearly” alleging facts that
demonstrate good cause exists to usurp Hopewell’s choice of venue in this District.

Filed 07/07/11 Page 5 of 12

Hopewell is a Resident of the Eastern District of Texas

Hopewell incorporated in Plano, Texas shortly before this litigation. Other than directing
this litigation, Hopewell’s Plano office is used for business purposes such as the receipt of
notices from the State of Texas as well as notices and payments from licensees of its patent.
Accordingly, the Court should grant consideration to Hopewell’s decision to conduct business
and avail itself to the laws of Texas.
C.

Hopewell Could Have Filed this Action in the Transferee District.

Hopewell does not contend that this action could not have been brought in the Transferee
District, where venue exists. However, in view of the private and public factors, this Court
should deny transfer of venue to the Northern District of California.
D.

Private Factors Do Not Favor Transfer.
1.

The Court Should Afford Weight to Hopewell’s Selection of Venue in
the Eastern District of Texas.

A plaintiff’s choice of venue is “a burden of proof question”—placing a significant
burden on the movant (Moving Defendants) to show good cause for transfer. Volkswagen, 545
F.3d at 314 n.10 (citing Humble Oil, 321 F.2d at 56; Time, Inc. v. Manning, 366 F.2d 690, 698
(5th Cir. 1966)). The good cause burden—requiring a movant to “clearly demonstrate” that an
alternate venue is more convenient—reflects the deference that a court should afford a plaintiff’s
choice of venue. Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at 315 (emphasis added); TS Tech USA., 551 F.3d 13191320 (declaring plaintiff’s venue choice impacts defendant’s burden to prove the transferee
venue is “clearly more convenient”) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).
Moving Defendants have turned a blind eye to the fact that this Court has held, on
multiple occasions that the great deference routinely afforded to a plaintiff’s choice of venue.
See, e.g., Texas Data Co., L.L.C. v. Target Brands, Inc., Civ. No. 2:10-cv-269-TJW, pp. 8-11
5

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

Filed 07/07/11 Page 6 of 12

(E.D. Tex. Jan. 12, 2011) (“Texas Data”) [Exh. B]; Ams. for Fair Patent Use, L.L.C. v. Sprint
Nextel Corp., Civ. No. 2:10-cv-237-TJW), p. 7 (E.D. Tex Jan. 12, 2011) [Exh. C]. This Court
has further observed that the defendant in Volkswagen only met its heavy burden to transfer
venue by showing that (i) four out of the eight factors for venue transfer favored transfer and (ii)
no factors cut against transfer. Texas Data [Exh B], p. 27. In fact, Judge Ward recently denied a
motion to transfer where “two factors slightly weigh in favor of transfer and one factor slightly
weighs against transfer.” Id. (emphasis added). See also Simpleair, Inc. v. Apple Inc., et al 2:09cv-00289-CE (E.D. Tex. Jun. 15, 2011). Here, Moving Defendants have failed to show that any
of the private or public factors favor transfer. Accordingly, this Court should deny Moving
Defendants’ Motion to transfer venue.
2.

Moving Defendants have Failed to Demonstrate that Evidence would
be More Accessible in the Transferee District.

First, compared to most other patent cases, the amount of proof required in this case is
minimal. The claims of the ’625 Patent are directed to a visual element of the accused products.
Therefore, the proof needed for infringement in the present case can be ascertained by a limited
amount of documents along with a physical inspection of the accused products.
Moving Defendants have failed to mention that Hopewell already possesses certain user
guides relevant to showing infringement. Furthermore, additional documentation could likely be
viewed and downloaded from any computer with internet access or be provided electronically by
the Defendants. See In re Triton Ltd. Sec. Litig., 70 F. Supp. 2d at 690 (“[T]he, the location of
documents is entitled to little weight in this analysis, given the ease with which they can now be
copied.”). Similarly, Moving Defendants have failed to show that any relevant documents in its
sole possession “are so voluminous that they would be difficult to transport.” Id.. Other Courts
have noted that “today’s modern technology allows for the easy exchange of electronic
6

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

discovery,” and the location of documents outside the forum does not warrant transfer. Acuity
Brands v. Cooper Industries, Inc. 2008 WL 2977464 at *3 (D. Del. 2008).
Hopewell’s own documents are available in the Eastern District of Texas. In addition,
because Samsung and Quickoffice are both located in the Eastern District of Texas, it is more
likely than not that their relevant sources of proof and witnesses are located in the Eastern
District of Texas. Furthermore, Hopewell reasonably believes that certain relevant documents
and materials s are available at Quickoffice and Samsung’s facilities in this District and at
Palm’s facilities in Houston.
Second, other than possible documents and employees of Adobe, Moving Defendants
have not shown that any documents or witnesses would be more accessible in the Transferee
District.
Quickoffice’s declaration that its director of partner development is based in the San
Francisco Bar area should be given no weight whatsoever. [QuickOffice Decl. at 3] Moving
Defendants have not demonstrated how this witness would be even remotely relevant to
Hopewell’s sources of proof. Furthermore, the Northern District of California would be less
convenient for Quickoffice’s CEO, resident in Connecticut, and Director of Business
Development, resident in London, England.
Although remaining in this district may slightly inconvenience HTC and LG, this does
not arise to the level that the Northern District of Texas is clearly more convenient.
Hopewell’s witnesses likely include the inventor, Cristiano Sacchi, and the principal of
Todo Partners, LLC3, Addison Fischer. Although Mr. Sacchi is located near the bay area, Mr.
Fisher is a resident of Florida, making it thus less convenient for Mr. Fischer.

3

Todo Partners, LLC is the owner by assignment of the ’625 Patent and Hopewell is the exclusive licensee with all
rights in the ’625 Patent.

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

Filed 07/07/11 Page 8 of 12

As for LG, and non-movant Palm, Moving Defendants’ naked assertion that “the bulk of
relevant documents and witnesses from these two defendants will likely be a location in
California” does not alter the balance of this factor. Motion [Dkt. #89] pg. 6. For at least these
reasons, the accessibility of evidence factor favors Hopewell.
3.

Availability of Compulsory Process Does Not Weigh in Moving
Defendants’ Favor.

Moving Defendants identify only the inventor of the patent-in-suit and the prosecuting
attorney as non-party witnesses where the compulsory process may be required. However,
Moving Defendants have not shown that either compulsory witness would not be agreeable to
attend trial in Texas.
Furthermore, Moving Defendants’ blanket assertion that “so many critical third party
witnesses are located in Northern California” is completely without support. See Motion [Dkt.
#89]. As such, this factor falls short of clearly weighing in favor of the Moving Defendants.
4.

Cost of Attendance for Willing Witnesses Clearly Favor This District.

As discussed above, three of the remaining parties have their headquarters in the Eastern
District of Texas. The costs for attendance by their willing witnesses favor this district. Of the
other Defendants, SEA, headquartered in New Jersey, likely has little or no evidence or
witnesses in its possession as most will be in the possession of its affiliate, Samsung.
Moving Defendants assert that witnesses for HTC and LG are located in Washington and
Southern California, respectively. See Motion (Dkt. 89), pg. 6; Exh. 2, Declaration of Maron, ¶¶
3, 9. If taken as true, the cost for attendance for these witnesses is only slightly reduced by being
in Northern California. However, Moving Defendants neglect to mention that LG’s likely
witnesses may also be in South Korea, which makes the costs no less or greater for either district.

8

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

Filed 07/07/11 Page 9 of 12

Adobe’s one witness related to its accused product – Adobe Reader for Android – is Mr.
Chatterjee, who is located in Adobe’s offices in Noida, India. See Motion (Dkt. 89), pg. 6;
Declaration of Marilyn Becker, ¶ 5. In fact, the cost is no less or greater for Mr. Chatterjee to
come to the Eastern District of Texas as it is for him to go to the Northern District of California.
However, the cost of attendance will be significantly greater for Samsung, Quickoffice, and
Hopewell’s witnesses.
As such, this factor significantly favors Hopewell.
C.

Public Interest Factors, Particularly the Local Interest Strongly Favors
Litigation in East Texas.

While Apple was a party to this litigation, the local interest slightly favored the Eastern
District. With Apple no longer a party to this litigation, the local interest heavily favors litigation
in East Texas.
1.

The Eastern District of Texas has an Overriding Localized Interest.

First, Hopewell’s formation in the Eastern District of Texas and enforcement of its patent
rights exclusively in this District has created a localized interest. Texas Data (Exhibit C), p. 26
(“[T]he Court will give some weight to the fact that Plaintiff . . . is incorporated in Texas and
conducts all relevant operations in the Eastern District of Texas.”).

Second, Defendants

Quickoffice and Samsung maintain their headquarters in this District.
Further, where there is a local interest, it is not unfair to burden citizens with jury duty.
See MedioStream, Inc. v. Acer Am. Corp., 2008 WL 4444327 at *3 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2008)
(“The defendants sell the accused systems throughout the United States, including in this district.
As such, there is a local interest in adjudicating this dispute, and it is not unfair to burden the
citizens of this district with jury duty.”). This is especially true as this litigation concerns three
residents of this district: Plaintiff Hopewell and Defendants Samsung and Quickoffice. The
9

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

Filed 07/07/11 Page 10 of 12

Northern District of California concerns only one Movant, Adobe. As such, the localized
interest is overridingly in favor of the Eastern District of Texas.
2.

This District is Highly Familiar with Streamlining Multi-Defendant
Patent Litigation.

The Eastern District of Texas is well suited to hear this case, as this Court hears a
disproportionate number of multi-defendant patent cases when compared to other districts in the
United States. See Forumlating Litigation-Hold Instructions and Identifying Accused
Instrumentalities in Multi-Defendant Patent Litigation, at 4, attached as Exh. D. This familiarity
and this Courts ability to manage such complex cases weigh against transfer. Volkswagen, 545
F.3d at 315 (recognizing importance of a court’s familiarity with governing laws to the venue
transfer analysis). As such, this District’s familiarity with the relevant patent laws and its ability
to manage and streamline multi-defendant cases weighs heavily in favor of litigating in this
District. See The PACid Group, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc. et al – Civil Action No. 6:09-CV324 – Dkt. #295, attached as Exh. E. (Ordering early mediation and early sales discovery to
streamline multi-defendant case)
3.

The Conflict of Law and Court Congestion Factors are Neutral.

There is apparently no conflict of law issue, so this factor is neutral.

Additionally,

Hopewell agrees with the Moving Defendants that there are no administrative difficulties
flowing from court congestions in either district.
IV.

CONCLUSION.
Considering all of the “private” and “public” interest factors, Defendants have not shown

that the Northern District of California is “clearly more convenient” than the Eastern District of
Texas. No good cause exists for transferring venue in this case. In fact, three parties are
residents in the Eastern District of Texas. Only one Moving Defendant resides in the Northern
10

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 100

Filed 07/07/11 Page 11 of 12

District of California. It appears that the Eastern District of Texas is clearly more convenient for
this case. As such, Hopewell respectfully requests the Court deny Moving Defendants’ motion.
