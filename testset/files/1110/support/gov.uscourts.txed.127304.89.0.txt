California under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a). The Northern District of California is most convenient
because it has compulsory process over crucial non-party witnesses; and important documents
and other evidence may be found there, including critical factual information pertaining to (i) the
design, marketing and sale of the accused products, (ii) the conception and reduction to practice
of the patented invention, (iii) ownership and standing to sue, and (iv) compliance with the duty
of candor to the PTO, and potentially invalidating prior art, all as described below. 2
I.

NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
This case has only the barest connection to the Eastern District of Texas, while the

Northern District of California has far greater interest in and ties to the issues involved in this
litigation. The patent-in-suit was filed by a Northern California inventor, prosecuted by a
Northern California attorney, and originally assigned to a Northern California company that
leases or sells computer software.

The plaintiff company, Hopewell Culture and Design

(“Hopewell”), claims to be the exclusive licensee of the patent-in-suit, U.S. Patent No. 7,171,625
(the “’625 patent”). Hopewell was incorporated in Texas only two weeks before this case was
filed and is not known to have any employees in the Eastern District of Texas. Other than
maintaining this lawsuit, Hopewell is not known to have any business operations in Texas.
Movants are not aware of any information suggesting that Hopewell has any business operations
apart from asserting the ‘625 patent in this lawsuit.
Hopewell joined a total of eleven defendants in this action, of which nine remain. With
two exceptions, none of the remaining defendants have any relevant business operations within

2

The non-moving defendants – Motorola Mobility, Inc. (“Motorola Mobility”), which has been
substituted for Motorola, Inc., and Palm, Inc. (“Palm”) – have stated they do not oppose the
motion. Two other original defendants – Opera Software ASA and Nokia, Inc. – have been
dismissed from the case.

this District. As the Complaint admits, three of the remaining defendants – Apple, Adobe
Systems, and Palm – have their principal place of business in the Northern District of California.
Original Complaint (Dkt. # 1), ¶¶ 3, 4, 10. A fourth, LGE, is a California corporation, with its
principal place of business in San Diego California. Id., ¶ 6. HTC America is headquartered in
Bellevue Washington (id., ¶ 5), but conducts substantial business in the Northern District of
California. 3 Motorola Mobility is headquartered in Libertyville, Illinois, but also has branch
offices in California, including four in the Northern District of California (one of which is a
“principal office”). 4 Samsung Electronics has its principal place of business in New Jersey, but
also has branch offices in California, including one in the Northern District of California. 5 Only
two defendants, Quickoffice (headquartered in Plano, Texas) and Samsung Telecommunications
(headquartered in northern Richardson, Texas), have their principal places of business in the
Eastern District of Texas. Both of these defendants, however, have offices and/or employees
located in California (and one in the Northern District of California), 6 and both have joined this
motion to transfer.
This case is still in the early stages. Apple, Adobe, LG, HTC America, Quickoffice,
Palm, and the two Samsung entities have answered the complaint. Motorola Mobility has
received a series of extensions and has not yet answered or otherwise responded to the
complaint. Opera Software and Nokia were both dismissed prior to filing an answer.

STATEMENT OFFACTS
A.

The Plaintiff Is A Non-Practicing Entity Formed Days Before This Litigation
Was Filed And, Apart From This Lawsuit, Appears To Have No Other Real
Contacts To Texas

Hopewell was formed as a Texas entity on December 6, 2010 almost certainly for the
purpose of attempting to create jurisdiction in this District. See Ex. 4, Declaration of Susan E.
Powley (“Powley Decl.”) ¶ 4 & Ex. A. This case was filed approximately two weeks later, on
December 22, 2010. The Moving Defendants are unaware of any business activities conducted
by Hopewell in this District, apart from assertion of the ‘625 patent. Hopewell has not alleged
that it manufactures products, employs anyone, or does anything of substance in this District.
B.

Critical Third Party Witnesses And Documents Related To The ‘625 Patent
Are Located In The Northern District Of California

Despite Hopewell’s attempts to manufacture contacts with this District, most of the
relevant evidence related to the ‘625 patent is located in the Northern District of California.
Documents and testimony from the inventor, the prosecuting attorney and Actify are likely to be
key to this litigation, and all are located in the Northern District of California.
The sole named inventor of the ‘625 patent, Cristiano Sacchi, resided in San Francisco,
California at the time the application leading to the ‘625 patent was filed. Complaint, Exhibit A
(‘625 patent, page 1); Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. G. It appears Mr. Sacchi is a former vicepresident of Actify, Inc. (“Actify”), a California company, and that he assigned his interests in
the ‘625 patent to Actify in June of 2002. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Exs. B & C. Mr. Sacchi appears
currently to be the CEO of a San Francisco based company, Novedge. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Exs.
D - F.
Actify was located in San Francisco, California at the time Mr. Sacchi assigned the
application to it.

Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. C.

4

Actify, Inc. remains in business and is

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 5 of 18

headquartered in San Francisco. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. I. David R. Graham is the attorney
who prosecuted the ‘625 patent. Complaint, Exhibit A, pages 1-2. Mr. Graham was located in
Milpitas, California when the application was filed. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. G. Mr. Graham is
still located at the same address in Milpitas, California, a city in Santa Clara County and within
the Northern District of California. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 (discussion of Ex. H).
Critical third party evidence relating to the issues of invalidity and inequitable conduct
are also within subpoena range in the Northern District of California. The only drawings in the
‘625 patent appear to be two screenshots of an Actify software program called SpinFire.
Complaint, Exhibit A, pages 1-2. A press release available on the Actify website indicates that a
version of its SpinFire software was on sale as early as May 15, 2001, more than one year before
the application for the ‘625 patent was filed on June 18, 2002. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. J. The
prosecution history for the ‘625 patent does not reflect any filing of an Information Disclosure
Statement (“IDS”), by the inventor, his attorney, or anyone else at Actify during the prosecution
of the application leading up to the ‘625 patent concerning the software being sold by Actify.
Powley Decl. ¶ 5.
As the foregoing demonstrates, third party documents and testimony from Mr. Sacchi, the
sole named inventor, the prosecuting attorney, and current or former employees of Actify in
addition to Mr. Sacchi are likely to be key to this litigation, and all are located in the Northern
District of California.
C.

Five Defendants Have Relevant Documents And Witnesses Located In Or
Near The Northern District Of California

Apple, Adobe Systems, HTC America, LG Electronics and Palm have witnesses and
documents located in or near the Northern District of California.

Apple is a California

corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, which lies within the Northern District of
5

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 6 of 18

California. Apple’s likely witnesses with knowledge relevant to this case are also located in
Cupertino. No known Apple witnesses with knowledge relevant to this case are located in the
Eastern District of Texas, and Apple’s relevant records relating the accused devices are located
in Cupertino. Ex. 1, Declaration of Joel Podolny, (“Podolny Decl.”),¶¶. 2, 4-7.
Adobe Systems is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in San Jose, California, which
also lies in the Northern District of California. Adobe Systems’ likely witnesses are located in
San Jose or in Noida, India. No known Adobe witnesses are located in the Eastern District of
Texas, and Adobe’s relevant records relating the accused Adobe Reader for Android software are
located San Jose and/or Noida, India. Declaration of Marilyn Becker (“Becker Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-7
(filed under seal concurrently with this motion, together with an unopposed motion to seal).
HTC America has its principal place of business (approximately 125 employees) in
Bellevue, Washington (in the Seattle area), and it is a Washington State corporation. All of its
employees expected to testify or to be deposed in this case are located in Washington State, as
are HTC America records relating to the accused Droid Eris, Droid Incredible, Hero, and EVO
handsets. See Maron Decl., ¶¶ 5-9. HTC America has no offices or retail stores in Texas. Maron
Decl., ¶ 6.
Two other defendants, LGE and Palm, are headquartered in California (Palm in San Jose
and LGE in San Diego). Accordingly, the bulk of relevant documents and witnesses from these
two defendants will likely be located in California.
In view of the foregoing, transfer is appropriate because the Northern District of
California is a venue where this action could have been brought in the first instance, is where the
key witnesses and evidence concerning the alleged invention are found, and is a closer, more
accessible and more convenient venue for many of the witnesses who will testify in this case,

6

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 7 of 18

including in particular the non-party witnesses. Finally, the allegedly infringing technology was
developed for Actify, which is headquartered in San Francisco, and by an inventor (Sacchi) who
was and is located in San Francisco. The Northern District of California thus has a far greater
interest in resolving this dispute than the Eastern District of Texas.
III.

ARGUMENT
A.

The Legal Standard

“For the convenience of parties, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any
civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.” 28 U.S.C.
§ 1404(a). In a series of recent cases, the Fifth and Federal Circuits have enunciated the standard
to be used in deciding motions to transfer venue. See In re Volkswagen of America, Inc., 566
F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2009) [hereinafter Volkswagen III]; In re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338
(Fed. Cir. 2009); In re TS Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (applying the Fifth
Circuit’s en banc Volkswagen II decision to rulings on transfer motions out of this circuit); In re
Volkswagen of America, Inc., 545 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 2008) [hereinafter Volkswagen II]. The
moving party must show “good cause,” and this burden is satisfied “when the movant
demonstrates that the transferee venue is clearly more convenient.” Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at
315.
A threshold question is whether the suit could have been brought in the proposed
transferee district.

In re Volkswagen AG, 371 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004) [hereinafter

Volkswagen I]. If the transferee district is a proper venue, then the court must weigh the relative
conveniences of the current district against the transferee district. In making the convenience
determination, the Fifth Circuit considers several private and public interest factors, none of
which are given dispositive weight. Id. “The private interest factors are: ‘(1) the relative ease of
access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of
7

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 8 of 18

witnesses; (3) the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical problems
that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.’” Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315
(quoting Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 203). “The public interest factors are: ‘(1) the administrative
difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized interests
decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case; and
(4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflict laws [or in] the application of foreign
law.’” Id. (quoting Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 203).
B.

The Court Should Order Transfer Because Movants Have Met Their Burden

Applying the uncontroverted facts to the public and private interest factors, Movants
demonstrate that the Northern District of California is clearly more convenient than is the
Eastern District of Texas. Consequently, the Court should grant the instant motion to transfer.
1.

Hopewell Could Have Brought This Action Against All Defendants In
The Northern District Of California

Hopewell could have brought this action against all defendants in the Northern District of
California. Indisputably, all the products Hopewell accuses of infringement are sold, distributed,
and/or used in the Northern District of California. Three Defendants (Apple, Adobe Systems,
and Palm) are headquartered in the Northern District of California.

A fourth (LGE) is a

California corporation, headquartered in San Diego. The remaining defendants either have
offices and/or employees or do substantial business in the Northern District of California. See
supra, Part I, pp. 2-3. Indeed, for most Defendants, those contacts are more substantial than their
contacts with the Eastern District of Texas. Thus, all of the remaining Defendants have the
requisite “minimum contacts” with the Northern District of California such that Hopewell could
have brought this action against them there.

The Private-Interest Factors Weigh Heavily In Favor Of Transfer To The
Northern District Of California
a.

The Northern District Of California Has Significantly Greater
Access To The Primary Sources Of Proof

The first private interest factor is relative ease of access to sources of proof. Here, this
factor tips decisively in favor of the Northern District of California. First, the vast majority of
third party physical evidence and third party witnesses identified to date relate to the critical
issues of invalidity and enforceability and are located in or near San Francisco, California.
Powley Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5. The named inventor apparently remains in San Francisco. Powley Decl. ¶ 4
& Exs. D-F. His testimony and documents will be central to the issues of invalidity and
inequitable conduct.
Any research and development concerning the subject matter of the ‘625 patent occurred
in San Francisco, and relevant documents (other than those possessed by Mr. Sacchi), including
inventor notebooks and pre-statutory bar versions of SpinFire, are likely to be in the offices of
Actify in San Francisco. Powley Decl. ¶4, Exs. I-K. Access to Actify documents and witnesses
likely also will be central to the issues of invalidity, inequitable conduct, and
ownership/standing. Actify’s documents and testimony also will be important to damages issues,
including whether Hopewell is barred from pre-suit damages for failure of Actify to mark any
products embodying the claimed subject matter.
In addition, the attorney who prosecuted the ‘625 patent is also located in the Northern
District of California. Powley Decl. ¶ 4 & Exs. G-H. Second, the majority of Defendants’
documents and witnesses also are located in or near the Northern District of California. Three
defendants (Apple, Adobe Systems, and Palm) are headquartered in Northern California.
Moving Defendant’s Apple’s and Adobe Systems’ relevant documents and witnesses are located
outside of the Eastern District of Texas, and primarily in the Northern District of California. See
9

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 10 of 18

Podolny Decl., ¶¶ 5-7; Becker Decl., ¶¶ 4-5. Palm is also headquartered in the Northern District
of California, and it presumably also has relevant documents and witnesses within that district.
Defendant HTC America is located on the West Coast in Bellevue Washington, where its
relevant documents and likely witnesses are also located. Maron Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9. Defendant LGE
is headquartered in San Diego. Thus, the majority of its witnesses and documents in the United
States that are potentially relevant to this case are located in California.

Samsung Electronics is

headquartered in New Jersey, and it presumably has relevant documents and witnesses located
there. In contrast, only two defendants, Quickoffice and Samsung Telecommunications, are
headquartered in this District.
This factor tips decidedly in favor of transfer.
b.

The Northern District Of California Has The Availability Of
Compulsory Process Over Witnesses That Is Lacking In The
Eastern District Of Texas

The subpoena power of the Northern District of California weighs heavily in favor of
transfer. When third-party evidence is likely to be critical, as is expected here, the relative
subpoena powers of the transferee and transferor court over non-party witnesses is an important
tipping factor. In re Acer, 626 F. 3d 1252, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“By comparison, the subpoena
powers of the Northern District of California may be expected to be invaluable, in the event
process is required to hale relevant witnesses into court. This factor surely tips in favor of
transfer.”).
As explained above, the testimony of current and former Actify employees, including the
named inventor of the patent-in-suit, is likely integral to the issues in this case (e.g.. invalidity,
unenforceability, and damages). The testimony of the prosecuting attorney also will be relevant
to the issue of inequitable conduct. These are all non-party witnesses believed to be in the
Northern District of California, where compulsory process will be available to secure their
10

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 11 of 18

attendance in the Northern District of California, not the Eastern District of Texas. Fed. R. Civ.
P. 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) (limiting a court’s subpoena power to within 100 miles from the courthouse.
See also Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316.
That so many critical third party witnesses are located in Northern California – witnesses
subject to compulsory process in California, but not in Texas – is central to the transfer analysis.
See In re Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1345 (“[t]he fact that the transferee venue is venue with usable
subpoena power here weighs in favor of a transfer, and not only slightly.”).
c.

Cost Of Attendance For A Substantial Number Of Witnesses Is
Less In The Northern District Of California

Another important fact in the transfer analysis is the convenience and costs associated
with attendance by witnesses. See Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1343; Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 205206; In re Nintendo, 589 F.3d 1194, 1198-99 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The court must consider the
convenience of both party and non-party witnesses.

See id. at 204 (requiring courts to

“contemplate consideration of the parties and witnesses”); Fujitsu Ltd. v. Tellabs, Inc., 639 F.
Supp. 2d 761, 765-66 (E.D. Tex. 2009). The cost of attendance for many of the likely witnesses
will be substantially reduced by transferring this case to the Northern District of California.
In Genentech, the Federal Circuit found a clear abuse of discretion in denying transfer
when, inter alia, a “substantial number of material witnesses reside[d] within the transferee
venue [the Northern District of California]” and no witnesses resided in the district in which it
was filed. 566 F.3d at 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009). In Nintendo, witness convenience weighed heavily
in the Federal Circuit’s decision to grant mandamus, when witnesses residing on the west coast
and in Asia would be forced to travel significantly farther if the case proceeded in this District
instead of Washington State. 589 F.3d at 1199.

11

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 12 of 18

As in Genentech, where the defendants were headquartered in San Francisco and San
Diego, many of the defendants here are headquartered in or near California. HTC America’s
witnesses work at its headquarters in the Seattle area, which is far closer to the Northern District
of California than to the Eastern District of Texas. Moreover, none of the defendants – even
those that may have witnesses for whom the Eastern District of Texas may be closer forum –
have indicated that they oppose the motion. Seven defendants have joined the motion, and the
other two have affirmatively state they do not oppose it.
In addition, the Moving Defendants know of no Hopewell employee witnesses having
relevant knowledge residing in this District, not surprising for a company formed a mere two
weeks before filing this lawsuit. Software Rights Archive, LLC v. Google, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 73972 (E.D.Tex. July 22, 2010) [hereinafter “SRA”] at *16 (“establishing a principal
place of business in this district shortly before filing suit does not create a local interest”) (citing
Federal Circuit precedent). Here, as in TS Tech, Genentech, Nintendo, and Microsoft, there is a
stark contrast in relevance, convenience, and fairness between the Northern District of California
and the Eastern District of Texas.
Finally, the fact that Hopewell chose to file in this District is not a sufficient basis to deny
transfer to the Northern District of California and, indeed, is entitled to little weight. In re TS
Tech., 551 F.3d at 1320 (“Fifth Circuit precedent clearly forbids treating the plaintiff’s choice of
venue as a distinct factor in the § 1404(a) analysis.”) (citing Volkswagen II, 545 F. 3d at n. 10).
Moreover, that Hopewell claims to be located in the Eastern District of Texas, having been
formed about two weeks before the filing of suit, is not a basis on which to prevent transfer. See
In re Microsoft, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 80 at **8-9 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 5, 2011)(non-precedential)
(connections to a preferred forum, including incorporation in Texas just 16 days before filing

12

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 13 of 18

suit, established in anticipation of litigation and for the likely purpose of making that forum
appear convenient are entitled to little or no consideration in determining whether transfer is
warranted under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a)); SRA, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73972 at *16.
Thus, the analysis of private-interest factors – i.e., location of sources of proof, the cost of
attendance of willing witnesses, and the availability of compulsory process – all strongly favor
transfer of venue to the Northern District of California. See id., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73972,
at ** 9-12.
3.

The Public Interest Factors Weigh In Favor Of Transfer To The Northern
District Of California

The public interest factors are: ‘(1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court
congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity
of the forum with the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary
problems of conflict laws [or in] the application. The second factor weighs decisively in favor of
transfer. The remaining three factors are neutral.
a.

The Northern District Of California Has A Significant And OverRiding Local Interest In This Dispute

The Northern District of California has a significant and over-riding local interest in this
dispute. The patented technology appears to have been developed, manufactured and sold in
Northern California. See Complaint, Exhibit A. A strong local interest exists when the “cause of
action calls into question the work and reputation of several individuals residing in or near that
district who presumably conduct business in that community.” In re Hoffman-La Roche Inc., 587
F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Such an interest abides here in the Northern District of
California, where the conduct of Actify, the inventor of the ‘625 patent, and the attorney who
prosecuted it all are at issue. No similar or comparable compelling local interest exists in the
Eastern District of Texas.
13

Case 2:10-cv-00586-DF -CE Document 89

Filed 06/06/11 Page 14 of 18

The availability of the Defendants’ products for purchase throughout the entire U.S.,
including in this District, does not create a countervailing interest here.

The courts have

repeatedly explained that, in cases in which the accused products can be found all over the
country (as Plaintiff here alleges), no specific venue has a dominant interest in resolving a claim
for patent infringement. See In re TS Tech, 551 F. 3d at 1321; see also Volkswagen II, 545 F. 3d
at 318 (mere availability of the allegedly infringing product in the district does not create a local
interest in the dispute, as such a rational “could apply virtually to any judicial district or division
in the United States”). The Northern District of California clearly has an overriding local interest
in this dispute.
b.

Practical Considerations Favor Transfer

The other three public interest factors are neutral. There are no administrative difficulties
flowing from court congestion or issues with forum familiarity with U.S. patent laws in the
transferee court. The Northern District of California, like this Court, is familiar with patent law
and has deep experience litigating patent cases. SRA 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73972 at *17
(citing T.S. Tech, F.3d at 1320-21). The Northern District of California also has asked to be a
participating district in the Patent Pilot Program under Pub. L. No. 111-349, 124 Stat. 3674. See
News Release dated January 26, 2011 (located at http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/news/30). Both
Districts have Local Patent Rules and district judges well versed in patent law. There are no
conflict of law issues here.
Moreover, because this motion to transfer venue is filed so early in these proceedings, the
expected timeline for claim construction and trial renders this factor neutral to the transfer
analysis. Id. at ** 13-14.

CONCLUSION
In view of the foregoing, the instant motion is well founded, and this case should be

transferred to the far more convenient forum that has compulsory process over non-party
witnesses and documents integral to many pleaded defenses, rather than remain in this forum,
where lack of compulsory process may limit defenses at trial. The instant motion to transfer to
the Northern District of California should be granted.

CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE
The undersigned certifies that the moving parties complied with Local Rule CV-7(g)’s
meet and confer requirement. On Monday, May 23, 2011, Jerry Selinger, counsel for HTC
America, acting on behalf of the Moving Defendants, conducted a telephonic conference with
Hao Ni, counsel for Plaintiff Hopewell Culture & Design LLC (“Hopewell”). Hopewell’s
counsel stated that Hopewell opposes the foregoing motion and the transfer of this case to the
Northern District of California. The Moving Defendants have thus reached an impasse with the
Plaintiff, and present this motion to the Court for determination. Counsel for the non-moving
Defendants (Motorola Mobility, Inc., substituted for Motorola, Inc., and Palm, Inc.) have stated
that their respective clients do not oppose the motion.
/s/ Jerry R. Selinger__________

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE
The undersigned hereby certifies that counsel of record who are deemed to have
consented to electronic service are being served with a copy of this MOTION TO TRANSFER
VENUE TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF
CALIFORNIA UNDER 28 U.S.C. §1404(a), via the Court’s CM/ECF system per Local Rule
CV-5(a)(3) on this the 6th day of June, 2011.
/s/ Jerry R. Selinger__________
