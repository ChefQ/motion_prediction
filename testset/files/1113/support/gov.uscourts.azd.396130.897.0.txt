16

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Motion

17 For Leave To Place Additional Evidence On The Record Responsive To Government Claims
18 Contained In Response To Motion To Suppress. Through this motion, the defendant
19 respectfully requests that the Court permit him to file his proposed Fourth Submission Of
20 Consolidated Exhibits Relating To Discovery And Suppression Issues submitted in support of
21 the defendant's Reply To Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress.[1] The
22 Court previously noted that “reply memoranda are not the place for new evidence, and the
23 Court routinely disregards evidence presented for the first time in a reply.”[2] However, the
24 defendant has a list of very good reasons as to why the Court should make an exception and
25 consider the additional exhibits presented by the defendant. As explained in the subsections
The instant motion is not being used to present additional suppression arguments to
26 1.
the Court. Any suppression argument briefly referenced in this motion is already fully
27 articulated in the defendant's Reply To Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To
Suppress, which is no greater than the authorized 50 pages.

1 below, it would be manifest injustice to not consider the exhibits considering they solely act
2 to rebut untruthful and/or unsubstantiated factual claims made by the prosecution in
3 Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #873). The defendant's
4 reply is a pure Refutation that only addresses the very specific points raised by the
5 government at Dkt. #873. The defendant is not relying upon any exhibit to make new
6 arguments or to support old arguments. The only alternative to considering the defendant's
7 new exhibits is to hear many days of testimony by additional witnesses—many of whom

GOVERNMENT CLAIMS CONTAINED IN RESPONSE TO MOTION TO SUPPRESS
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 would need to fly in from California[3]—in order to establish the same facts that are already
9 established by the additional exhibits.
10

In its response at Dkt. #873, the government capitalized on the fact that the Court

11 “routinely disregards evidence presented for the first time in a reply[]”[4] by making a series
12 of brand new untruthful and unsubstantiated claims of which the defendant has no way to
13 effectively rebut without presenting additional evidence for the first time in his reply. Some
14 of the government's new claims are relevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis and
15 necessitate additional evidence reflective of the truth. However, the government also used
16 page Nos. 1-38 of Dkt. #873 to launch an unsubstantiated character attack against the
17 defendant holding no relevance to the Fourth Amendment issues. The government's
18 otherwise irrelevant character attack acts to poison the jury pool, bait the press towards
19 negative coverage, and otherwise taint the defendant's chances at a fair trial.
20

In order to effectively rebut the government's untruthful and unsubstantiated claims,

21 the defendant requests that his new exhibits be considered by the Court in the context of the
22 defendant's Reply To Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress. The
23 following subsections categorize the 24 new exhibits attached to Fourth Submission Of
24 Consolidated Exhibits Relating To Discovery And Suppression Issues and explain why they
25 are necessary to rebut the specific untruthful and/or unsubstantiated claims made by the
See Motion Requesting Evidentiary Hearing To Settle Contested Issues Of Fact Going
26 3.
To Validity Of Fourth Amendment Searches And Seizures. The docket number for the above
27 named motion is unavailable for inclusion here considering it is being filed by the
defendant's shadow counsel's office at the same time of the instant motion.

A.

Exhibit Nos. 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, and 11 are needed
to rebut the government's attack on the defendant's character.

The government's attack on the defendant's character is on page Nos. 1-38 of Dkt.

5 #873. Instead of addressing the relevant facts, the government went to great efforts to paint
6 the defendant as a bad person. The government's allegations involved rogue and treasonous
7 U.S. intelligence agents, a U.S. government instigated civil war, threats of violence,

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PLACE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE RECORD RESPONSIVE TO

CR08-814-PHX-DGC

8 weapons, missiles, robot assassins, and the defendant being the leader/organizer of the
9 alleged scheme. Although the government's accusations are entirely irrelevant to the Fourth
10 Amendment issues being presented to the Court,[5] the government using page Nos. 1-38 of
11 its response as a forum to attack the defendant's character acts to poison the jury pool, bait
12 the press towards negative coverage, and otherwise taint the defendant's chances at a fair
13 trial. The defendant should be permitted to defend himself against these libelous assertions
14 made by the government by presenting a small list of rebuttal evidence from the
15 government's own discovery—evidence the government seemingly ignores.
16

The government's stategy at Dkt. #873 is a continuation of what former United States

17 Attorney Dennis Burke[6] began in 2010 with the USDOJ making the false claim that the
18 defendant was a “self-described California-based 'Hacker'”—a claim the prosecution now
19 admits was a lie.[7] By allowing the defendant to present evidence rebutting the
20 5.
If the Court disagrees, however, then the defendant's new exhibits addressed in this
subsection should be considered under the alternative theory that his rebuttal to the
21 government's “bad guy” allegations is relevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis.
United States Attorney Dennis Burke was forced into resignation by the Obama

administration for his misconduct associated with the ATF's “Operation Fast and Furious”—a
23 botched federal investigation now perpetuating ongoing murders at the muzzle of USDOJ

1 government's character attack at Dkt. #873,[8] the defendant will at least have something on
2 the record to contrast the government's new false claims in the event that potential jurors are
3 once again exposed to the product of the government's unethical prosecution strategy. In
4 2010, many reporters took the government's bait and repeatedly referred to the defendant as a
5 “self-described Hacker” in widely available news articles covering the case at the time.

B.

Exhibit Nos. 12 and 13 are needed to rebut the government's
inference that the search of the defendant's key and keyhole was a
“search incident to arrest.”

On page No. 63 of Dkt. #873, the government attempted to combine a search and

14 seizure made by Santa Clara police officers incident to the defendant's arrest with a separate
15 seizure of the defendant's keys made by a federal agent. In support if its argument, the
16 government made the factual claim that, at the time of the defendant's arrest, “[a] third
17 federal agent was summoned to the scene from the nearby apartment complex. The third
18 agent took the keys which had been seized incident to arrest and went back to the subject
19 apartment.” Id. at 34. In order to show that the seizure of the keys made by a federal agent
20 was separate from the search incident to arrest, the defendant is presenting EXHIBIT 13
21 showing how far away from the Domicilio apartment complex the defendant was arrested
22 and EXHIBIT 12 showing that the defendant was already subdued, demobilized, and in
23 custody at the time of the federal agent seizure of the keys.
24

The exhibits relevant to this section are EXHIBIT 12 and EXHIBIT 13 attached to the

25 a[s] the 'Hacker[,]'” as was claimed in the government's USDOJ press release.).
Even if the government's claims are true, which they are not, said claims in no way
26 8.
support the government's arguments responsive to the defendant's suppression filings. See
27 Government's Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress (Dkt. #873). The government
clearly had an ulterior motive when it placed Dkt. #873, page Nos. 1-38, on the record—
28 especially in light of the imminent press coverage that will result from the Court's ruling on
the defendant's Motion To Suppress and related filings.

Exhibit No. 14 is needed to rebut the government's claim that
needing time to defeat encryption justified failure to comply with
the terms of the N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT and 08-70502-PVT
search warrants.

On page No. 66 of Dkt. #873, the government claimed that “the length of time that the

9 United States has spent analyzing the lawfully seized material is reasonable in light of... the
10 defendant's efforts at concealing his crimes through encryption...” Id. Contrary to the
11 government's claim, IRS-CI Agent Daun was able to get around all encryption as soon as she
12 sat down at the defendant's computer on August 3, 2008. In order to rebut the government's
13 claim, the defendant is presenting EXHIBIT 14 containing an August 25, 2008 email from
14 IRS-CI Agent Daun to AUSA Battista stating that she was able to get around the encryption
15 issues.

The exhibit relevant to this section is EXHIBIT 14 attached to the defendant's Fourth

17 Submission Of Consolidated Exhibits Relating To Discovery And Suppression Issues. The

D.

Exhibit Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18 are needed to rebut the government's
claim that no witnesses know the defendant under any of his aliases.

On page No. 59 of Dkt. #873, the government attempted to distinguish the use of an

24 alias discussed in United States v. Villarreal, 963 F.2d 770, 772-73 (5th Cir. 1992) from the
25 defendant's use of aliases based on the reasoning that the defendant in Villarreal “was known
26 by at least one witness by the fictitious name connected to two shipping drums full of
27 marijuana that Customs agents opened without court authorization.” Id. Contrary to the
28 government's comparison, agents interviewed numerous individuals who stated they know

2 defendant is presenting EXHIBIT 15 through EXHIBIT 18 containing government agent
3 reports regarding the noted interviews.

Exhibit No. 19 is needed to rebut the government's claim that there
would be no accountability had the defendant walked away from his
lease at apartment No. 1122.

On page No. 36 of Dkt. #873, government claimed that “[a]t the time of his arrest,

12 defendant was living in the apartment under the false Brawner identity with no means of
13 traceability or recourse if he walked away from the terms of the lease or apartment.” Id.
14 Contrary to the government's claim, Domicilio was able to contact the defendant after his
15 arrest while he was at the Santa Clara County Jail and later while he was at CCA-CADC in
16 Florence, AZ. The defendant was held accountable and satisfactorily closed out his lease. In
17 order to rebut the government's claim, the defendant is presenting EXHIBIT 19 containing
18 correspondence from Domicilio to the defendant after his arrest.
19

The exhibit relevant to this section is EXHIBIT 19 attached to the defendant's Fourth

20 Submission Of Consolidated Exhibits Relating To Discovery And Suppression Issues. The
21 noted exhibit is referenced and relied upon in the defendant's Reply To Government's
22 Response To Defendant's Motion To Suppress, Section I(R), hereby incorporated into this

defendant with a copy of the N.D.Cal. 08-90330MISC-RS order.

26

On page No. 55 of Dkt. #873, the government claimed that “in this case the agents

27 had no real opportunity to serve the owner of the aircard with a copy of the tracking
28 warrant[.]” Id. Contrary to the government's claim, agents had an opportunity for service

1 considering it succeeded at serving the defendant with a menu from a Chinese food
2 restaurant on July 22, 2008. In order to rebut the government's claim, the defendant is

4 defendant with a Chinese food restaurant menu at his home residence.
