Case 3:07-cv-05847-PJH Document16 Filed 01/30/2008 Page 6 of 25

I. INTRODUCTION

Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertions in their Motion to Remand, resolution of Plaintiffs' claims
depends entirely upon interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement between Mirant and
IBEW Local 1245. Therefore, under well-settled Supreme Court law, Plaintiffs' state law claims are
indeed preempted by, and arise under, Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act
("LMRA"), 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 185(a). In fact, each and every one of Plaintiffs' claims in this case rests on
the incorrect interpretation of specific language in the collective bargaining agreement rather than
the actual practices of the parties. To support their meal and rest period claims, Plaintiffs allege that
certain language in the collective bargaining agreement prohibits them from taking off duty breaks in
violation of California law. In other words, Plaintiffs have accused Mirant and their Union of having
negotiated an unlawful contract.' Yet, the collective bargaining agreement language that Plaintiffs
reference is equally subject to a lawful interpretation, and it is well-established that where a contract
is subject to more than one interpretation, a court should give it the meaning that is lawful.
Interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement also requires an examination of past practice
and extrinsic evidence. The Supreme Court has held that Section 301 creates a federal common law
for interpreting and enforcing collective bargaining agreements, and it is this law that must be
applied to the interpretation disputes here. Thus, as shown in more detail below, this Court does
have jurisdiction over this case under Section 301, and Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand must be denied.

Further, as this Court properly has jurisdiction over this matter under Section 301, the Court
has supplemental jurisdiction over Defendant's Counterclaim. All requirements of the Declaratory

Judgment Act are met. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike or Dismiss the Counterclaim must

also be denied.

 

' While Plaintiffs contradict their Complaint by claiming in their Motion to Remand that they are not
challenging the lawfulness of the CBA, they are plainly doing just that, as the Union acknowledges.
(IBEW Local 1245 Motion to Dismiss, pp. 21, 22 (recognizing that Plaintiffs claim "that
implementing this CBA violates state law regarding meal and rest breaks" and that Plaintiffs argue
that the CBA "authorizes Mirant to violate state meal and rest break requirements."))

1 | IL RELEVANT FACTS
2 A. Defendant Mirant California, LLC.

3 Defendant Mirant California, LLC ("Mirant") owns and operates Power Plants in San
4 | Francisco (the "Potrero Power Plant"), Antioch (the "Contra Costa Power Plant") and Pittsburg,

5 | California (the "Pittsburg Power Plant') (collectively the "Power Plants"). Mirant purchased the

6 | Power Plants from PG&E in 1999. (Declaration of Lisa Battles ("Battles Decl."'), { 2.)
7 B. The Collective Bargaining Agreement Between Mirant and IBEW Local 1245.
8 The Power Plant Technicians employed by Mirant are members of a bargaining unit

9 || represented by IBEW Local 1245 (the "Union'). Since 2000, Mirant and the Union have been
10 }| parties to a series of Collective Bargaining Agreements. The current Collective Bargaining
11 || Agreement (the "CBA") has been in effect since November 1, 2005. The practices that the parties
12 || intended to be set forth in the CBA have been the practices since before Mirant purchased the Power
13 || Plants. (Battles Decl., {J 6, 7.)

14 1, The Applicable Bargaining Unit.

15 The CBA bargaining unit consists of "Power Plant Technicians employed at the Company's
16 | Contra Costa, Pittsburg and Potrero Power Plants." (Battles Decl., 4 & Exh. 1, CBA 0x00A7 4.1.)

17 2. Normal Plant Operations and Periodic Shift Work.

18 The usual work schedule for employees in the bargaining unit is "eight (8) hours per day,
19 | Monday through Friday." (Battles Decl., Exh. 1, CBA 0x00A7 16.2.) However, the CBA also provides
20 | different terms for employees who are "shift employees." "Shift employees" are individuals who
21 | work "a job that is staffed with a rotating twenty-four (24) hour per day shift, on a seven (7) day a
22 || week basis, including holidays." (Battles Decl., Exh. 1, CBA 0x00A7 16.5.)

23 Mirant produces and sells electricity only when necessary meet electricity demands. The
24 | Contra Costa and Pittsburg Plants produce electricity only about 30 to 60 days per year. The
25 || remainder of the year, these Power Plants are fully staffed, but do not produce electricity. (Battles
26 || Decl., 73.)

27 Mirant's interpretation of the term "shift employees" is that it includes only those Power

2g || Plant Technicians who regularly work twelve hour shifts. The term "shift employee" does not

include Power Plant Technicians whose regular work schedule is only 8 hours per day, regardless of

whether those individuals work overtime or how much overtime they work. (Battles Decl., { 8.)

C. All Power Plant Technicians Receive Duty Free Meal and Rest Periods in
Compliance with California Law.

All Power Plant Technicians employed by Mirant receive meal breaks lasting at least 30
minutes every day. The employees are relieved of all duties during the meal breaks and are free to
leave the premises. (Battles Decl., { 9.)

A few Power Plant Technicians are responsible for manning the control room ("control room
operators"). When the Power Plants are producing electricity, the control room operators cannot
leave the control room unattended, but are expected to try to find another employee to relieve them
during their break times. (Battles Decl., 0x00A7 12.)

Employees also receive at least two fifteen minute breaks per day. Employees can take these
breaks anywhere in the Plant. During their breaks, they are relieved of all duties. Employees are

also permitted to take additional shorter breaks at any time. (Battles Decl., 19, 18.)

D. There Is Extensive Language in the CBA Regarding Meal Periods and Rest
Breaks.

1. Unpaid Meal Periods for Power Plant Technicians with Eight (8) Hour
Shifts Under Section 16.2 of the CBA.

Power Plant Technicians with 8 hour shifts have regular working hours of "40 hours per
week, eight (8) hours per day, not including a meal period of one-half (1/2) hour." (Battles Decl.,
Exh. 1, CBA 0x00A7 16.2.) Unless employed as a "Shift Employee," meal periods are not included in
"work time." (Battles Decl., Exh. 1, CBA 0x00A716.3.) Mirant interprets this provision to mean that the
30 minute duty free meal periods of these employees are unpaid. (Battles Decl., { 9.)

2. "Time Worked" in CBA Section 16.5.

CBA Section 16.5 sets forth the terms of the parties' agreement with respect to meal periods
for "shift employees." It provides: "Time to consume meals for shift employee shall be considered
as time worked." (Battles Decl., Exh.-1.) Plaintiffs interpret this provision as constituting "evidence
of the fact that Mirant denied Plaintiffs the mandatory off-duty meal and rest periods . . . ." (Motion
to Remand, p. 4.) Plaintiffs assert that the fact that the CBA "states unequivocally that the meal

periods of `shift employees' are `considered as time worked'" is "consistent with Plaintiff's claims
that the Class Members are not getting required `off duty' meal periods." (Motion to Remand, p. 7.)

In contrast, Mirant has never interpreted this language to mean that "shift employees" must
perform any work while consuming meals. Mirant interprets this language to mean that the parties
have agreed that the duty free meal periods of "shift employees" are paid rather than unpaid break
periods. Not only do "shift employees" receive duty free meal breaks, but they are also paid their

regular hourly rate for the time that they are on break. (Battles Decl., J 10.)

3. Whether CBA Section 16.5 Requires Employees to Remain in Any
Particular Location During Their Meal Periods.

Section 16.5 of the CBA also states that "[mJeals will be taken at the work station or as
directed by the Supervisor." (Battles Decl., Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs claim that this provision is "evidence"
that Mirant requires employees to "remain at their work stations to monitor and respond to alarms
while they eat quickly." (Motion to Remand, p. 1.) In contrast, Mirant does not interpret this
provision as requiring employees to work during lunch. The Power Plants are extremely large and
spread out facilities, and employees do not generally have assigned work stations and can be
working anywhere in the plant at any point in time. Mirant interprets the term "work stations" to
mean the entire Plant, which includes kitchen, outdoor patios and other spaces that are appropriate
for breaks. Moreover, Mirant has always interpreted this language to mean that such employees may
take their meal breaks anywhere they want and find convenient. unless they are directed by their
supervisors to remain in the Plant. That would only occur if the nature of the work prevented them

from leaving. (Battles Decl., 0x00A7 11.)

4. On-Duty Meal Period Agreement.

The vast majority of Power Plant Technicians may leave the premises and are never required
to perform any work during meal breaks. The only people who may rarely be unable to leave the
Plant are the very few Power Plant Technicians who work as control room operators. When the
Power Plants are producing electricity, there may be a few occasions when the nature of the work
prevents control room operators from being relieved of all duties during their meal periods. Mirant
intended and interprets Section 16.5 to constitute an on-duty meal period agreement should it be

1 || necessary for a control room operator to continue monitoring equipment. However, even during the
2 | time that the Power Plants are operational, control room operators are required to take a duty free
3 || meal period as they are expected to ask other employees to relieve them. (Battles Decl., { 12.)

4 CBA Section 24.1 states: "The Company and the Union may mutually agree to amend or add
5 | to any provision of this Agreement during its term, provided that any such amendment or
6 | modification must be in writing ...." Mirant interprets this language as giving the Union an ability
7 || to revoke the on-duty meal period agreement in Section 16.5 at any time. (Battles Decl., 13.) In
8 | contrast, Plaintiffs claim "no written statement of a right to revoke exists in the CBA or elsewhere."

10 5, Paid Rest Breaks.
11 CBA Section 16.7 states that "[e]ach employee shall be allowed a ten-minute paid break to
12 | be taken at his or her workstation . . . ." (Battles Decl., Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs claim this "demonstrates

13 || that it has been the policy and practice of MIRANT that the only rest periods to be taken by the
14 | Class are unlawful `on duty' breaks." (Motion to Remand, p. 4.) However, Mirant does not interpret
15 || this language to mean that employees must stay at their workstations to monitor and respond to
16 | alarms. Section 16.7 provides for rest breaks during which employees are relieved of all duties and
17 || do not perform any work. Meirant's interpretation of Section 16.7 is that it only means that
18 | employees may not leave the plant during breaks. There are several break areas, including a kitchen,
19 || restrooms and outdoor patios, where employees may go during breaks without leaving the plant.
20 | (Battles Decl., { 18.)

21 6. The Provisions of the CBA that Govern Overtime Meal Breaks.

22 The CBA also contains agreements regarding a second meal period. Pursuant to Section
23 | 17.8, Power Plant Technicians who have 8 hour shifts receive a second 30 minute meal period
24 | (`overtime meal break") when they work overtime. Power Plant Technicians who regularly work 12
25 || hour shifts receive an overtime meal break when they work more than 12 hours. An employee who
26 || does not receive any overtime meal break receives a $13.00 meal allowance plus one-half hour of

27 || pay at one and one-half times the employee's regular hourly rate, which is more than the one hour
