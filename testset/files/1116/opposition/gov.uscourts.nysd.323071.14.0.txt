IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
-------------------------------------------------------John Finn,

Case No: 08-cv-2975 (LTS) (KNF)

Plaintiff,
JUDGE LAURA T. SWAIN
vs.
Smith Barney, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Citigroup, Inc., Brian Williams, and Does 1
through 20, inclusive.
Defendants.
-------------------------------------------------------MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS

Preliminary Statement
Plaintiff, John Finn, respectfully requests that this court deny defendants request for stay.
Defendants assert that plaintiff is bound by a contract between them and plaintiff. However,
defendants are seeking at once to enforce one portion of the provision that would force plaintiff to
arbitration, while simultaneously asking this court to freeze plaintiff from acting under the protection
afforded him by the remaining portion of the provision. Such is not fair. Contractual provisions
should not be set aside absent a waiver of both parties. Where defendants’ have refused to waive
their right to arbitrate, this court should not negate the effect of plaintiff’s option to enforce the
provision currently barring arbitration to such an extent that absent waiving such provision and
seeking arbitration (which under the contract, he currently need not do), plaintiff’s right to seek
redress for his injuries at the hands of defendants is rendered null.

In order to do allow defendants to advise plaintiff on how to invest his money and to invest it
for him, plaintiff had no choice but to agree to all of the terms of section 6 of the contract defendants
now simultaneously rely upon and seek the court’s aid to ignore. According to such section,
defendants have a right to force plaintiff to arbitration. However such right is limited in cases where
no class action is pending that plaintiff is a member of and where plaintiff has not opted out of such
class. Defendants’ requested stay would negate the plain meaning of such contractual language.
Defendants provided cases where trial courts have granted stays under seemingly similar
circumstances. However such cases are not controlling on this court and, as will be discussed below,
the facts and rationale applied by those courts supporting such stays are not present here.
Plaintiff concedes that if a) the class action of which plaintiff is a member fails to be
certified, or is thereafter decertified, or b) he chooses to opt out of the established class when
required, that absent a waiver, defendants will be entitled to request a stay of any then-pending
proceedings before this court so as to enforce the arbitration provision of the contract.
Plaintiff also concedes that if he chooses to remain a member of the class if it is established a
at some point must choose, that the claims of any then-pending proceedings before this court that are
covered by the class suit should be at least stayed upon motion of defendants.
However, plaintiff disagrees with defendants that the validity, construction, or purposes of
FINRA rules that are contractual binding upon FINRA members including defendants have any
bearing on the construction and enforceability of the contractual language in the agreement between
defendants and plaintiff simply because they are similar to each other. Furthermore, plaintiff believes
that the harm to plaintiff in disallowing him to proceed as much as the language of the contract
allows him, will present a far greater harm to him than to defendants.

Background
Defendants, by defendant Brian Williams, purchased auction rate securities of their own choice after
a telephone call where Williams told plaintiff that such securities were as liquid and safe as if not the
same as money market funds. Defendant made this recommendation after plaintiff explained that the
funds from the sale of his house in Brooklyn constituted his life savings and that he wanted to place
them in the safest investment with safety and liquidity the primary goal, not income. Had
defendant’s disclosed to plaintiff that there was a chance that these securities would become illiquid
should auctions fail, then plaintiff would never have let defendants purchase such securities.
Now, $400,000.00 of such securities are virtually worthless, as the auctions have
continuously failed since February 2008. Moreover, it has been reported that large institutional
investors were advised to remove their funds from these securities before the auctions failed
while small investors such as plaintiff were not. Plaintiff is not alone in his pain and suffering at
the hands of the defendants and others like them as class actions against all major players in this
fraud have been maintained while numerous states’ criminal divisions have launched
investigations.
Argument
Defendants ask this court to stay this action based the language contained in the contract
between plaintiff and defendants set forth in defendant’s memorandum. Such language on one hand
allows defendants to force plaintiff to arbitrate and on the other hand limits their ability to do so
while plaintiff is a member of a class or putative class asserting similar claims against the

defendants. This court is bound to construe the language of the contract according to general
principals of contract law.1
This court should first satisfy itself that the contractual language at issue is not ambiguous.2
When it finds that it is not, next it should review the parties’ intent as expressed in the language of
the contract.3
Subsection six of the contract plainly and unambiguously prohibits defendants from
enforcing any contractual right they have while under the conditions set forth. The primary effect of
such language is to allow plaintiff to seek whatever lawful remedies he wishes without interference
from defendants asserting arbitration rights. The courts in the cases sited by defendants, for whatever
reason, chose to construe the meaning of FINRA or NASD rules binding upon defendants that may
have been raised as the basis for opposing stays in those cases. Here, however, such rule is not the
basis for plaintiff’s opposition to a stay. Rather, plaintiff here relies on the plain language of the
contact between the parties alone.
The fact that the language in the contract between the parties is similar or identical to the
FINRA rules does not properly lead to the conclusion that the FINRA rules are at issue here since
the parties were free to contract any way they wanted. The omission of an arbitration clause in a

contract will effectively remove the right of FINRA members to force a customer into arbitration
(but not the opposite since they are subject to FINRA rules).4 Since parties can always modify the
language of arbitration agreements between them, contractual language has been held to allow a
party to maintain court actions notwithstanding the existence of an arbitration provision.5 Defendants
could have left out the limiting portion of the contract if they wanted to, but they did not. If such
contractual language did not exist, only then would the FINRA rule, if plaintiff asserted it, be
properly construed by this court to determine whether to grant a stay.
Here, there is no basis for the court to look beyond the plain meaning of the language in the
contract. To resort to looking at the intent behind FINRA rules, as if such were legislative in nature,
would be improper since such are not at issue here. Indeed, such may not have been proper for the
courts cited by defendants since FINRA rules, contrary to legislative statutes, are contractual in
nature between FINRA members.6
Despite maintaining this motion, defendants’ cannot disagree that they may not enforce their
right to arbitrate at this time. Such is plainly stated in the contract. However, a stay of this action
would disallow plaintiff to enjoy his right to personally assert claims against the defendant absent
proceeding to arbitration which is the effect of the additional plain and unambiguous language of the
contract. By pressing for the same, and while doing so, offering as rationale the existence of the
arbitration provision, defendant are doing nothing more than asking the court to ignore the

contractual language prohibiting them from doing asserting the arbitration language. The court
should not allow defendants to do so and thereby overlook the terms of the contract agreed to.
As long as the current condition satisfying the language of the contract exists, plaintiff should
not be hampered in pursuing a remedy in this court. The argument by defendants that such will be a
waste of time is not true. As defendants have stated, these conditions, which under the contract allow
plaintiff to prosecute his case here, may last a very long time depending upon the court’s decision
regarding the putative class actions and any appeals which may arise from such decisions. Indeed,
plaintiff may be able to conduct discovery and proceed to trial while these conditions exist. Even if
eventually forced to arbitrate prior to resolution of this matter if the condition abates, plaintiff’s
discovery obtained under the rules of this court will not be wasted but will be helpful to the parties
and to the arbitrators if the case is ultimately heard. The idea asserted by defendants that litigation
before this court that may conclude prior to a trial on the merits is a waste of time is ridiculous given
that the vast majority of cases settle and are encouraged to settle before decisions on the merits. Are
all of those cases and the concepts underlying discovery and early resolution of disputes a waste of
this court’s time? The answer is not only no, but is also that such exist as of right for people such as
plaintiff.
Plaintiff agrees that this court has the power to issue stays as incidental to its power to control
its docket.7 However, once this court construes the clear language of the contract and not subject to
any view of the intent of FINRA or NASD behind rules that are not a part of this case, the court
should not even countenance a stay on the basis of the existence of an arbitration provision since
such is contractually is not currently available to defendant.

Nonetheless, the considerations of equity underlying this court’s decision to grant a stay or
not weigh heavily in favor of plaintiff under the four relevant factors described in defendants’
memorandum.8
Under the first factor regarding hardship to plaintiff, Mr. Finn would be irreparably harmed
because a stay would deprive him his right to this court’s assistance in personally asserting his
claims against defendants. If and when he is contractually forced to arbitrate, only then will this right
contractually disappear. A stay will force him either join a class which he may not want to do or to
arbitrate which he may not want to do and which under the contract in question he is not currently
required to do. Meaningful discovery leading to settlement and even trial on the merits is possible
under current conditions. If he may lose the benefit of this court at some currently unknowable time
in the future, such does not lessen his rights in the present. Such benefit a benefit to plaintiff is not
insubstantial or else the defendants would not be trying so hard to take it from him.
Under the second factor regarding hardship to defendants, the defendants are not deprived or
harmed in any meaningful way. First, defendants are not deprived of their right to arbitrate because
at the present time, they are contractually prohibited from arbitrating under the same contract they
claim such right. Defendants’ right to arbitrate is not present at this time. Defendants cannot be
deprived of something they do not have. Second, defendants claim that being forced to litigate
plaintiff’s claims on an individual and class basis would prejudice them is weak at best. In forcing
defendant to arbitration they would still incur separate actions. Indeed, via their letters to this court,
they intend to try and force all of the class members to individual arbitrations. Such is opposite to

2d 376, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2007);

simplifying litigation for defendants and contrary to their assertion here. In fact, since the court has
chosen to coordinate the putative class actions under plaintiff’s case, such presents the simplest way
to conduct defendant’s litigation. Therefore denying to issue a stay will actually benefit defendants.
Under the third factor regarding court resources, the court has already placed the class actions
and this matter under the same judge for purposes of coordination. And again, the possibility that
this matter may not proceed to a final conclusion presents no real hardship or waste to this court
where substantive discovery and perhaps trial is ultimately possible under current conditions.
Under the fourth factor regarding the policy favoring arbitration agreements, there is no basis
to consider the same where at the moment and for the unforeseeable future, the defendants do not
have a right, contractual or otherwise, to arbitrate. At this point, only plaintiff does, and he should be
free to choose not to exercise such right or else such is not really a right.
The request for stay of this matter until some future unknown time will essentially force the
plaintiff to arbitrate if he wishes any hope of recovering the $400,000.00 he has lost at the hands of
defendants unless he wishes to join the class and lose control over his litigation. Just as the plaintiff
has the right to not join the class, by the plain language of the contract between him and defendants,
his right to seek redress for his grievances here remains at this time. This court should not remove
either of these essential rights. The defendants have demonstrated no contractual right to arbitration
at this or any imminent time and therefore no equitable right to a stay.
For all of the foregoing, plaintiff respectfully requests that the court deny defendants’ motion.
