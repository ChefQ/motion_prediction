PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Defendants Smith Barney, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGMI"), Citigroup Inc.
("Citigroup"), and Brian Williams ("Williams") (collectively, "Defendants") respectfully seek a stay
of these proceedings, including Defendants' obligation to answer, move or otherwise respond to the
Complaint, until it is determined whether John Finn's (""Plaintiff's") claims will proceed as part of
the related class actions before this Court -LHB Insurance Brokerage Inc. v. Citigroup Inc., et al.,
08-cv-3095 (LTS) ("LHB'"), and Swanson v. Citigroup Inc., et al., 08-cv-3139 (LTS) (`Swanson').
If the claims do proceed as part of the class actions, this case need not continue at all. If the claims
do not proceed as part of the class actions, then they will be subject to arbitration. In neither event
will this case ultimately proceed as an individual, separate action before this Court.

Plaintiff, who holds a brokerage account at Smith Barney, has asserted claims with
respect to particular investments. His account agreement provides for mandatory arbitration of
claims. He attempts to rely on a provision of the arbitration agreement that excludes the claims of a
customer who "is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any
claim encompassed by the putative class action" until class certification is denied or he opts out of
the class. However, while he relies on the provision excluding class actions from arbitration, he
secks to bring his own claims individually. Thus, he seeks to use the existence of the LHB and
Swanson Class actions to delay his obligation to arbitrate his claims, but apparently does not want to
proceed as a membcr of those putative classes.

Plaintiff is, of course, entitled to participate as a class member in LHB and Swanson.
Or he is entitled to proceed individually in arbitration. But he is not entitled to avoid arbitration by
pointing to class actions in which he is not participating, thus delaying his arbitration obligation until

cither class certification is denied or he opts out later in the litigation.
Case 1:08-cv-02975-LTS Document10 Filed 05/06/2008 Page 7 of 18

Defendants respectfully request that the Court stay the proceedings in the Finn action,
including Defendants' obligation to answer, move or otherwise respond to the Complaint, until it is
determined whether Plaintiff's claims will be resolved as part of the related cases of LHB and
Swanson. \f and when it is determined that Plaintiff's claims will not be resolved as part of the class
actions-either because class certification is denied, Plaintiff opts out, or Plaintiff represents to the
Court at any time that he does not wish to participate in the class actions-Defendants will promptly
move to compel arbitration in the individual Finn action.

BACKGROUND

Plaintiff alleges that he held a retirement savings account at Smith Barney, (see
Compl. {| 8), which is a division of CGMI. In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he invested in
auction rate securities ("ARS") on the recommendation of Smith Barney broker and defendant Brian
Williams.' (See Compl. {J 11-12.) Plaintiff asserts that he was misled with respect to these
investments, and that they were unsuitable for him. He asserts claims under the federal securities
laws, state law, and regulatory rules.

Plaintiff executed an agreement with respect to the Smith Barney account in which he
made the purchases alleged in the Complaint that contains an arbitration provision. The agreement
states, in relevant part:

6. Arbitration...

I agree that all claims or controversies, whether such claims or controversies
arose prior, on or subsequent to the date hereof, between me and SB and/or any
of its present or former officers, directors, or employees concerning or arising
from (i) any account maintained by me with SB individually or jointly with
others in any capacity; (ii) any transaction involving SB or any predecessor
firms by merger, acquisition or other business combination and me, whether or
not such transaction occurred in such account or accounts; or (iii) the

 

' ARS are long-term securities for which the interest rates or dividend yields are periodically re-

set through "dutch auctions," typically held every 7, 14, 28 or 35 days.

Case 1:08-cv-02975-LTS Document10 Filed 05/06/2008 Page 8 of 18

construction, performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us,
any duty rising from the business of SB or otherwise, shall be determined by
arbitration... .

No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to
enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has
initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class
who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the
putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; (ii) the class is
decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the class by the court.

Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a
waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein.

(Account Application, Client Agreement and Substitute Form W-9 Request for Taxpayer Identification
Number, attached as Ex. A to the accompanying Declaration of Charles E. Davidow (""Davidow Decl."),
{ 6 (bold-face in original, italics added).")

Under the paragraph governing class actions, arbitration is not barred completely or
indefinitely. Rather, the arbitration is precluded only while Plaintiff is a member of either a putative
or certificd class. If the class claims are dismissed, class certification is denied, the class is
decertified, or Plaintiff is no longer a class member-either by voluntarily opting out of the class or
by a decision of the court, then the arbitration exclusion no longer applies and Plaintiffs individual
claims may be compelled to arbitration." Arbitration is mandatory under the Federal Arbitration Act
("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 4, and courts faced with an uncontested arbitration agreement have no option

other than to order the parties to arbitration. See infra Part I.

 

Another account document associated with this account is attached as Exhibit B to the
Davidow Declaration.

The preclusion of arbitration is also confined to claims cncompassed by the putative class action.
Defendants do not concede at this time that all of Plaintiff's individual claims are encompassed
by the putative class action and reserve their rights to compel those individual claims that are not
encompassed by the putative class action to arbitration at the appropriate time, in the event that
this Motion to Stay the Proceedings is denied.
Case 1:08-cv-02975-LTS Document10 Filed 05/06/2008 Page 9 of 18

Just days after Plaintiff filed the Complaint, two putative class action complaints were
filed in this District Court against some of the same defendants named in this action, also asserting
claims in connection with the plaintiffs' purchases of ARS from the defendants. See LHB Insurance
Brokerage Inc., No. 08-cv-3095 (LTS) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2008) [Doc. 1]; Swanson, No. 08-cv-
3139 (LTS) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2008) [Doc. 1]. On April 4, 2008, Defendants submitted a letter to
the Court requesting that these later-filed cases be assigned to this Court as related to this action, for
coordinated proceedings. (See Defs.' Letter to the Court, Apr. 4, 2008, Davidow Decl. Ex. C.) In
their written responses to Defendants' request, all plaintiffs raised the issue of arbitrability, with the
putative class action plaintiffs attempting to differentiate those actions as non-arbitrable by virtue of
the exclusion of class actions from arbitration. (See Finn Letter to the Court, Apr. 10, 2008 ("Finn
Letter"), Davidow Decl. Ex. D, at 1; LHB Letter to the Court, Apr. 9, 2008, Davidow Decl. Ex. E, at
2 & n.1; Swanson Letter to the Court, Apr. 9, 2008, Davidow Decl. Ex. F, at 2.) The LHB and
Swanson cases were transferred to this Court on April 17, 2008.

In his letter to the Court, Plaintiff argued that his individual claims in this action are
non-arbitrable because he is a putative class member in the LHB and Swanson actions. (See Finn
Letter, Davidow Decl. Ex. D, at 1.) He did not contest the existence or validity of the binding
arbitration agreement with Defendants. To the contrary, he used the provision of that agreement
relating to class actions as a shield. Yet he indicates (as we read his letter) that he wishes to pursue
his claims as an individual, not as a member of the class: "And because his core claims have been
duplicated by later filed putative class actions, if judicial economy, the rules, and other
considerations lean toward consolidation of such under Judge Swain, then they should be without

regard to the individual nature of his action." (/d. at 2.)
Case 1:08-cv-02975-LTS Document10 Filed 05/06/2008 Page 10 of 18

In response to the Court's inquiry as to Defendants' intentions regarding arbitration,
Defendants informed the Court by letter, dated April 14, 2008, that they could not move to compel
arbitration at this time because of the pendency of the related class actions. Defendants stated their
intention to file this Motion. (See Defs.' Letter to the Court, Apr. 14, 2008, Davidow Decl. Ex. G.)
Plaintiff responded in a letter to the Court, dated April 16, 2008. (See PI1.'s Letter to the Court, Apr.
16, 2008, Davidow Decl. Ex. H.)

ARGUMENT

L. Plaintiff Is Subject to an Uncontested, Valid and Binding Arbitration Agreement, the
Enforcement of Which Is Mandatory Under the FAA

Plaintiff does not dispute the existence or terms of his binding arbitration agreement
with Smith Barney." Federal statutory and case law require the strict enforcement of such
agreements in accordance with their terms.

The FAA requires judicial enforcement of a wide range of arbitration provisions in
written contracts "involving commerce." 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2. Specifically, Section 2 of the FAA provides:
A written provision in any . .. contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce
to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or
transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement

in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a
contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable... .

Id. (emphasis added).

 

Defendants CGMI, Citigroup and Williams, although not signatories to the arbitration agreement,
also are entitled to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims and therefore also are entitled to move
this Court for a stay of these proceedings. A non-signatory may compel a signatory's claims to
arbitration where "the relationship among the parties, the contracts they signed... , and the
issues that had arisen' among them discloses that `the issues the nonsignatory is secking to
resolve in arbitration are intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed.'"
JLM Indus., Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen SA, 387 F.3d 163, 177 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Choctaw
Generation Ltd. P'ship v. Am. Home Assurance Co., 271 F.3d 403, 406 (2d Cir. 2001)) (holding
that parent companies could invoke arbitration agrcements signed by subsidiaries).
