I.

INTRODUCTION

2

Plaintiffs Denise Huskins (“Huskins”) and Aaron Quinn (“Quinn”) were asleep in

3

Quinn’s home when an intruder broke in, tied them up, kidnapped Denise, and raped her multiple

4

times before releasing her days later. When both victims went to the Vallejo Police Department

5

(“VPD”) in their desperate hour of need, VPD not only did not help, it affirmatively waged a

6

vicious campaign against them for the purpose of covering up their own incompetence. Due to

7

Defendants’ bullying and utterly false fixation that Quinn must have murdered Huskins, they

8

first illegally interrogated Quinn for 18 straight hours while Huskins was missing. Then, when

9

Huskins “inconveniently” showed up alive, Defendants hatched an even more outrageous

10

scheme: to cover up their first false theory that Quinn killed Huskins by going on national

11

television within hours of Huskins’s release and falsely announcing that Huskins and Quinn had

12

simply made the whole thing up. Defendants now seek, via this anti-SLAPP motion, to strike

13

Plaintiffs’ defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) claims, asserting

14

that they acted within the bounds of the law. Defendants’ motion is meritless.

15

First, Defendants assert that they are absolutely immune under California Civil Code

16

section 47(b) because their statements to the national media involved the same subject matter as

17

an ongoing police investigation. But, as explained in Plaintiffs’ concurrently filed motion to

18

dismiss and further below, law enforcement is not given free rein under 47(b) to abuse victims

19

through press releases serving no investigative function simply because such conduct involves

20

the same topics as a police investigation. In addition, Plaintiffs have alleged in their Complaint

21

that many additional statements were made outside the context of the statements to the press, for

22

example in statements made to VPD’s friends and neighbors, that served no investigative

23

function. Under the Federal Rules, Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on these claims before this

24

Motion can be resolved as to those statements.

25

Second, Defendants argue that Government Code section 821.6 bars the defamation and

26

IIED claims. But they ignore binding Ninth Circuit authority holding that this section applies

27

only to claims for malicious prosecution, and not the claims Plaintiffs bring here.

28

Third, and most gallingly, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs are “public figures” for
1
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO STRIKE

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 12 Filed 08/25/16 Page 8 of 27

1

purposes of defamation law simply because they had the unlucky misfortune to be the victims of

2

crimes that the media covered. They thus argue that Plaintiffs must affirmatively demonstrate

3

that the statements were made with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for

4

their falsity. But Defendants ignore settled authority holding that Plaintiffs must voluntarily

5

thrust themselves in the limelight before this high showing of fault is required. Further, even if

6

Plaintiffs were somehow considered public figures, Plaintiffs have more than enough evidence

7

demonstrating that Defendants made these false statements intentionally, and as part of a vicious

8

campaign to deflect public attention away from VPD’s own ineptitude. In any event, Defendants

9

are also entitled to discovery on these issues before the Court can rule on these matters. 1

10

Accordingly, the Court should deny Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion in full.

11

II.

BACKGROUND

12

A.

13

At the time of the events giving rise to the Complaint, Plaintiffs were licensed physical

PLAINTIFFS LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC EYE AS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS

14

therapists living in Vallejo, California. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 2; Quinn Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs were

15

private citizens holding private employment with Kaiser Hospital. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 2; Quinn

16

Decl. ¶ 2.) At no time did Plaintiffs ever seek the public eye or take any steps to address any

17

issues of public concern. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 2; Quinn Decl. ¶ 2.)

18

B.

19

On March 23, 2015, Plaintiffs were sleeping at Quinn’s home when one or more

20

intruders 2 broke into the home, blindfolded Plaintiffs, bound their hands and feet, and drugged

21

them. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 3; Quinn Decl. ¶ 3.) The assailant instructed Quinn that Huskins would

22

be kidnapped for ransom, that Quinn was being monitored, and that the assailant would harm

23

Denise if Aaron went to the police. (Quinn Decl. ¶ 4.) The assailant followed through on his

1

In accordance with this point, Plaintiffs have concurrently filed a Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 56(d) declaration of James M. Wagstaffe for such discovery.
2

Plaintiffs believed that there were multiple people involved, although only one assailant
(Matthew Muller) is currently being prosecuted for the crime. For ease of reference, Plaintiffs
simply reference the “intruder” or “assailant” (singular). (Huskins Decl. ¶ 3; Quinn Decl. ¶ 3.)

threats and took Denise. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 4.) Quinn, confined to the couch, ultimately

2

succumbed to sleep from effects of the strong sedative the intruder had given him. (Quinn Decl.

3

¶ 5.) When he awoke hours later he was terrified and agonized for the next several hours about

4

what to do. (Id. ¶ 6.) He was afraid to leave the house or call the police for fear that the

5

kidnapper would harm Huskins. In the intervening hours, he received a number of texts and

6

emails requesting a ransom for Huskins’s release. (Id. ¶ 5.)

7

C.

8

Quinn called VPD, who came to his home. (Id. ¶ 6.) The police immediately acted as if

9

VPD IGNORES KEY EVIDENCE AND AGGRESSIVELY INTERROGATES QUINN

Quinn was the criminal rather than the victim, focused solely on irrelevant evidence they thought

10

might implicate him (such as whether he had held a “party” the night before), and ignored key

11

evidence of the crime (such as evidence of forced entry to the house and batteries and other items

12

left by the true kidnapper). (Id. ¶ 7.) Quinn went with officers to the VPD station, where he was

13

promptly and maliciously treated like Huskins’s murderer. (Id.) VPD took Quinn’s clothing.

14

(Id. ¶ 8.) In exchange, Quinn was given prison pants with the words “Solano Prison” displayed

15

on the side and a dirty white t-shirt, but no underwear or socks. (Id.) They also took his blood

16

and DNA. (Id.) The police placed Quinn in an interrogation room, where he was cut off from

17

any family or other visitors who would be able to help him. (Id.) VPD proceeded to interrogate

18

Quinn aggressively for 18 straight hours. (Id. ¶ 9.) Det. Mustard and others repeatedly told

19

Quinn they believed he was lying, that they did not want to hear about any claimed intruders, and

20

that they knew that Quinn had killed Huskins. (Id.) VPD led Quinn to believe that he was not

21

free to leave during the marathon interrogation. (Id. ¶ 10.) Despite VPD’s aggressive posturing,

22

VPD did not have any evidence to charge Quinn with any crime, and he was released after his

23

attorney arrived. (Id. ¶¶ 10-15.) VPD delayed Quinn’s departure in an apparent attempt to

24

secure more media coverage of Quinn’s release. When VPD finally allowed Quinn to leave,

25

they tried to force Quinn—sleep deprived, hungry, and still wearing the jail clothes from VPD—

26

to exit the front of the station where numerous media outlets had congregated at VPD’s

27

instruction. (Id. ¶ 16.) Quinn’s attorneys identified what was occurring, and secured a more

28

discrete release. (Id.)

1

After his release, Quinn discovered that, rather than monitoring his email and phone for

2

communications from the kidnapper, VPD instead put his plane on airplane mode, and thus

3

missed several emails and calls. (Id. ¶¶ 17-18.) Quinn shared these new communications with

4

VPD, which had all occurred while he was in custody. (Id.) Over the next two days, Quinn

5

continued to cooperate with VPD. (Id. ¶ 19.)

6

D.

HUSKINS IS KIDNAPPED, TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE STATE IN THE TRUNK OF
A CAR, AND RAPED TWICE

7
When initially taken from Quinn’s house, Huskins was transported several hours away in
8
the trunk of a car by the kidnapper. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 4.) Huskins was taken into the bedroom of
9
a home and tied to the bed with zip ties and a bike lock. (Id. ¶ 5.) For the next day, Huskins
10
remained a hostage in this small room, and was forced to wear a blindfold made of blacked out
11
swim goggles when her captor entered the room. (Id.) Huskins was drugged repeatedly while
12
held captive, and raped multiple times. (Id.) The kidnapper threatened that he would harm
13
Huskins and/or her family again if she disclosed the rapes or the kidnapper’s supposed military
14
background when she spoke with the police or media. (Id. ¶ 7.) Huskins was again drugged and
15
blindfolded, as the kidnapper drove for hours. (Id.)
16
17

E.

WHILE SHE WAS STILL MISSING, MUSTARD ACCUSES HUSKINS OF TRYING TO
“RE-LIVE” THE THRILL OF PRIOR SEXUAL TRAUMA

18

While held captive, the kidnapper forced Huskins to record a “proof of life” tape, used by

19

kidnappers asking for ransom to prove that the kidnapped person is still alive. (Id. ¶ 6.) Shortly

20

thereafter, VPD had Huskins’s mother and brother verify that her voice was the voice in the

21

recording. (See Jane Huskins Dec. ¶ 3.) During that encounter, VPD officers said that Huskins’s

22

mother should watch the movie “Gone Girl” to understand what was happening to her daughter. 3

23

(Id. ¶ 11.) They also asked Huskins’s mother if Huskins had ever been kidnapped or assaulted

24

before. (Id. ¶ 6.) Huskins’s mother confided that Huskins had been sexually molested when she

25

was a child. (Id.) An officer, believed to be Defendant Mustard, stated that the fact Huskins had

26
27
28

3

“Gone Girl” is a fictitious book-turned-to-film about a cheating husband accused of
killing his wife. A final twist reveals that, rather than being kidnapped, the wife elaborately
faked her disappearance to frame the husband as revenge for his infidelity.

1

previously been sexually abused made sense because, in his experience, women who have

2

already been sexually assaulted often pretend that it is happening again in order to gain attention

3

and “re-live” the excitement of that experience. (Id. ¶ 13.) He explained that it is likely that

4

Huskins was just making this whole incident up to get attention. (Id.)

5

F.

HUSKINS IS RELEASED IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, AND VPD ACCUSES HER OF A
CRIME BEFORE TAKING HER STATEMENT

6
On March 25, 2015, Huskins was released near her parents’ homes in Huntington Beach.
7
(Huskins Decl. ¶ 8.) The Huntington Beach Police Department (“HBPD”) observed “darker
8
impression circles” around her eyes, consistent with Huskins’s and Quinn’s statements that they
9
had been forced to wear swim goggles as blindfolds. (Clune Decl. Ex. A, p.7.) Huskins also
10
showed HBPD the shoes—which were too large for her feet—and water bottle the kidnapper had
11
given her. (Id. at p.6; Huskins Decl. ¶ 13.) Huskins spoke with HBPD for nearly one hour about
12
her kidnapping and release. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 12.) Still in shock from the kidnapping and fearful
13
of retribution from a dangerous criminal still on the run, Huskins denied to HBPD that she had
14
twice been sexually assaulted and did not mention that the kidnapper claimed to be ex-military.
15
(Id. ¶ 14.) Huskins’s account regarding the details of the home invasion entirely corroborated
16
Quinn’s. (See Id. ¶ 3; Quinn Decl. ¶ 3.)
17
HBPD contacted VPD, and spoke with them for approximately one-half hour. (Huskins
18
Decl. ¶15.) Although VPD had neither seen nor spoken with Huskins, Det. Mustard spoke with
19
HBPD about the case, and ultimately spoke with Huskins’s cousin who was on the scene. (Id.;

Nicholas Huskins Decl. ¶ 11.) VPD’s only contact with Huskins—through Det. Mustard’s call
21
with Huskins’s cousin—did not check on Huskins’s condition or follow up on her story to catch
22
the dangerous predator that had just released her. (See Nicholas Huskins Decl. ¶¶ 11, 14.)
23
Instead, Det. Mustard threatened and verbally attacked Huskins. (Id.) Det. Mustard told
24
Huskins’s cousin that VPD was offering a “proffer of agreement.” (Id.) Det. Mustard stated that
25
Quinn had been at the station cooperating with VPD, and whoever accepted first would get
26
immunity. (Id.) Det. Mustard told Huskins’s cousin, “I don’t want to hear any more about these
27

Vallejo. (Id.) Det. Mustard was hostile and aggressive during this call. (Id.) Given that

2

Huskins had “inconveniently” shown up alive, VPD maliciously transitioned to the hoax story to

3

avoid criticism for its initial and utterly baseless accusations of murder. (Compl. ¶ 51.)

4

Detective Mustard made similar statements to Quinn and Huskins’s mother. (Quinn Decl. 21;

5

Jane Huskins Decl. ¶¶ 20-22.)

6

Huskins learned about VPD’s prior assertions that Quinn murdered Huskins and its new

7

assertions that both Huskins and Quinn had faked the entire story. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 20.) Fearful

8

that VPD would place her back in a confined area and subject her to additional trauma, and that

9

she was unjustly being painted as a suspect in a crime rather than as the victim that she truly was,

10

Huskins took a commercial flight back to the Bay Area. (Id.) Huskins travelled alone with a

11

borrowed cell phone, cowering wherever she could to avoid the press, police, or kidnapper, each

12

of which she reasonably believed were still after her. (Id.)

13

G.

14

Even before Huskins’s plane touched down in the Bay Area, VPD began a dramatic

VPD PUBLICLY SMEARS HUSKINS AND QUINN

15

public relations assault on her and Quinn. First, VPD issued a press release to the public, stating

16

in part: “Today, there is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or

17

an abduction at all. Given the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an

18

orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.” (Clune Decl. Ex. B.)

19
20
21

At a press conference held that same evening at approximately 9:27 p.m., Lt. Park made
the following statements, each of which were false:
o

“We also know that the statement that Mr. Quinn provided was such an incredible
story, we initially had a hard time believing it, and, upon further investigation, we
were not able to substantiate any of the things that he was saying.”

o

“Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins has plundered valuable resources away from our
community, and has taken the focus away from the true victims of our community,
while instilling fear amongst our community members. So, if anything, it is Mr.
Quinn and Ms. Huskins that owes this community an apology.”

o

“If you can imagine devoting all of our resources, 24 hours a day, on what I will – uh
- classify as a wild goose chase – it’s a tremendous loss. It’s disappointing, it’s
disheartening, and the fact that we’ve essentially wasted all of these resources, for
essentially nothing, is upsetting.”

Lt. Park: “I can tell you that our investigation has concluded that none of the claims
has been substantiated. I can go one step further to say this – that this was not a
random act, and that the members of our community are safe, and that they have
nothing to fear.”

4
5
6

(Clune Decl. Ex. C; see Nicholas Huskins Decl. ¶ 19.) Each statement was undeniably false and

7

despicable. Lt. Park and VPD surely knew that it is a crime to provide false statements to the

8

police, and indicated that Huskins and Quinn had committed that crime. In fact, VPD and Lt.

9

Park had no evidence to support the false and disparaging comments made so publicly. Within

10

minutes of VPD’s false statements that Huskins’s kidnapping was a hoax, VPD had successfully

11

and widely turned a local disappearance into a worldwide media frenzy proliferating VPD’s

12

public smearing of Huskins and Quinn. News outlets across the world likened Huskins to the

13

lead character in the film “Gone Girl,” and placed Huskins’s picture next to that of the lead

14

character, including one depicting the character naked and covered in blood. (Clune Decl. Ex.

15

D.) Nancy Grace took to television displaying the Twitter hashtag “#kidnappinghoax.” (Id. Ex.

16

E.)

17

On information and belief, VPD gratuitously made numerous additional false and

18

otherwise defamatory statements about Huskins and Quinn to others without any valid law

19

enforcement purpose. (Compl. ¶ 47.)

20

H.

21

Shortly after Huskins landed in San Francisco, Huskins’s attorney told VPD that she

22

would continue cooperate with the investigation into her kidnapping. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 25.)

23

Huskins’s attorney also told VPD that Huskins wished to submit to a sexual assault exam as soon

24

as possible. (Id ¶ 26.) VPD demeaned the exam request and told her attorney that it could wait.

25

(Id.)

26

VPD CONTINUES TO ATTACK HUSKINS AND QUINN

Huskins ultimately spoke with VPD for nearly two full days about her captivity and

27

sexual assaults. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 27.) Nothing Huskins said provided any additional

28

justification to Defendants’ defamatory statements, yet VPD focused intently on proving up its

1

“Gone Girl” case. Investigators repeatedly told Huskins and her attorneys that she was lying,

2

and built up a deceptive evidentiary record in hopes that they could charge her with a crime.

3

(Id.) Due to the ongoing and aggressive harassment of Huskins, Quinn, and those connected to

4

them by VPD, Huskins and Quinn no longer feel safe in the City of Vallejo; VPD’s actions have

5

forced Huskins and Quinn to leave the City of Vallejo. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 28; Quinn Decl. ¶ 25.)

7

In June 2015, Matthew Muller was arrested in connection with a similar invasion and

THE FBI ARRESTS MATTHEW MULLER FOR THE KIDNAPPING

8

assault. On July 13, 2015, an unsealed FBI affidavit detailed Muller’s purported involvement in

9

Huskins’s kidnapping. (Dkt. No. 1 in Case No. 2:15-cr-00205-TLN.) The 50-page affidavit

10

mirrored the accounts of Plaintiffs and directly contradicts both VPD’s public statements and the

11

declarations in support of Defendants’ motion. On July 20, 2015, the City of Vallejo admitted

12

privately that “it is clear now that there was a kidnapping on March 23, 2015, that it was not a

13

hoax or orchestrated event and that VPD conclusions were incorrect.” (Huskins Decl. Ex. A;

14

Quinn Decl. Ex. B.) Even then, VPD still maintained that it had done nothing wrong given “the

15

information that was available at the time.” (Id.) In the meantime, Huskins and Quinn’s lives

16

and reputations were completely destroyed.

III.

THE ANTI-SLAPP STATUTE DOES NOT APPLY IN FEDERAL COURT

18

California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is a procedural rule that conflicts with

19

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56. Rules 12 and 56 “establish the exclusive criteria for

20

testing the legal and factual sufficiency of a claim in federal court.” Makaeff v. Trump Univ.,

21

LLC, 736 F.3d 1180, 1188 (9th Cir. 2013) (Watford, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en

22

banc); Abbas v. Foreign Policy Grp., LLC, 783 F.3d 1328, 1333 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Plaintiffs

23

recognize that existing Ninth Circuit authority currently holds otherwise, and make this argument

24

to preserve this issue for appeal.

ANALYSIS IF THE ANTI-SLAPP STATUE APPLIES
“The anti-SLAPP statute requires a two-part analysis: (1) the defendant must make a

28

petition or free speech’; and (2) once the defendant makes this showing, ‘the burden shifts to the

McAfee, Inc., 660 F.3d 1156, 1163 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Mindys Cosmetics, Inc. v. Dakar,

3

611 F.3d 590, 595 (9th Cir. 2010)). On disputed issues of fact, prong two of the anti-SLAPP

4

analysis is considered under the same standard as a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.

5

Rogers v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 57 F. Supp. 2d 973, 981-82 (C.D. Cal. 1999). Thus, as

with summary judgment, all inferences on disputed facts must be drawn in Plaintiffs’ favor.

7

Metabolife Int'l, Inc. v. Wornick, 264 F.3d 832, 840 (9th Cir. 2001). Further, leave to amend

PLAINTIFFS CAN ESTABLISH A PROBABILITY OF PREVAILING ON THEIR
DEFAMATION CLAIM

11
Plaintiffs do not dispute that the defamation claim arises from an act in furtherance of the
12

rights of petition or free speech under prong one of the anti-SLAPP statute. 4 As to prong two,

13
Defendants do not argue that the statements giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims were true. Instead,
14
Defendants ask this Court to hold each statement privileged under California Civil Code section
15
47(b) or California Government Code section 821.6, or, alternatively, that Plaintiffs are “public
16
figures” and Defendants acted without actual malice. Defendants bear the burden of
17
demonstrating the applicability of any privileges or immunities. Milstein v. Cooley, 257 F.3d
18
1004, 1008 (9th Cir. 2001); Palmer v. Zaklama, 109 Cal. App. 4th 1367, 1380 (2003). None of

Plaintiffs have not been given documents, including emails and texts, from VPD despite a
full public records request and Defendants’ obligation to provide documents under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 26. As such, Plaintiffs concurrently have filed a Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) request for such
discovery. (See Wagstaffe Decl.) It is reasonably anticipated that such discovery will show even
more deceit and unlawful involvement by VPD in this investigation and communications that are
well beyond any pending or anticipated proceeding, in which case the anti-SLAPP statute could
not properly be invoked at all. See Abuemeira v. Stephens, 246 Cal. App. 4th 1291, 1298 (2016);

1. Defendants’ Conduct Is Not Privileged Under California Civil
Code Section 47(b)

2
a) Defendants’ statements to the press are not statements made in
a judicial proceeding

3
4

Defendant argues that their statements to the press are protected as part of a “judicial

5

proceeding” under section 47(b)(2). (Mot. at 10.) But a press conference is not a judicial

6

proceeding, and California courts have routinely held that statements made to the general public

7

about judicial proceedings are not protected under section 47(b)(2). “The principal purpose of

8

the litigation privilege ‘is to afford litigants and witnesses the utmost freedom of access to the

9

courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.”’ GetFugu, Inc. v.

10

Patton Boggs LLP, 220 Cal. App. 4th 141, 152 (2013) (citation omitted). The litigation privilege

11

“applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants

12

or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that

13

have some connection or logical relation to the action.” Id. (citation omitted).

14

For the privilege to apply, there must be a “functional connection” to the litigation itself.

15

Rothman v. Jackson, 49 Cal. App. 4th 1134, 1141 (1996). Thus, for example, statements made

16

in pleadings and demand letters, are protected as logically related to the judicial proceedings. Id.

17

at 1148 (collecting cases). But press conferences explaining one party’s position on potential or

18

actual litigation to the general public are not protected. Id. at 1148-49 (involving a press

19

conference in response to potential criminal and civil tort allegations of child abuse); see also

20

Susan A. v. County of Sonoma, 2 Cal. App. 4th 88, 93 (1991) (after a public defender retained a

21

psychologist to interview a criminal defendant, subsequent statements by that psychologist to the

22

press about what she learned in that interview were not privileged); GetFugu, Inc., 220 Cal. App.

23

4th at 152 (involving statements made in a press release by attorneys for a company about an

24

FBI investigation into an adversary). That is because “republications to nonparticipants in the

25

action are generally not privileged under section [47(b)] . . . .” Silberg, 50 Cal. 3d at 219. Here,

26

Defendants’ statements in the March 25, 2015 press conference and in related press releases

27

were not distributed to participants or witnesses in the litigation—they were sent broadly to the

28

national news media at large. As such, they are not protected under section 47(b).
10
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 12 Filed 08/25/16 Page 17 of 27

1

Defendants point to authority suggesting that statements made to police are protected by

2

the privilege because they can prompt and facilitate investigations that are prerequisites to

3

criminal prosecution. (Mot. at 10:17-22 (citing Forro Precision, Inc. v. Int’l Bus. Machines

4

Corp., 673 F.2d 1045, 1055 (9th Cir. 1982).) But the press release and later statements to the

5

media here clearly did not have the function of investigating Huskins and Quinn, nor were they

6

communications directed at other law enforcement agencies aimed to prompt further

7

investigation of them. Instead, they were extraneous statements made to the public at large,

8

which were separate and apart from the actual investigation. Indeed, the actual substance of the

9

communications indicated that, as far as the police were concerned, there was no kidnapper and

10

thus no need for further investigation of the supposedly invented crime. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 89

11

(“I can tell you that our investigation has concluded that none of the claims has been

12

substantiated. I can go one step further to say this – that this was not a random act, and that the

13

members of our community are safe, and that they have nothing to fear.”).) As such, there is no

14

sense in which these press communications by the police furthered the investigation itself, much

15

less performed a function that was a prerequisite to any criminal prosecution. Thus, they are not

16

protected. See Rothman, 49 Cal. App. 4th at 1141.

17

Defendants may try and argue that the public had a “substantial interest” in the potential

18

criminal case given the threat to public safety posed by the a kidnapper being on the loose, and

19

therefore may contend that the statements should still be protected by section 47(b)(2), pointing

20

to certain case law including within the privilege’s protections certain nonparties with a

21

“substantial interest” in the proceeding. But, any such construction of the privilege that would

22

extend it to statements made to the general public on issues of “public interest” has been

23

repeatedly rejected by California courts because that “would swallow up the general rule, which

24

[the California Supreme Court ... reaffirmed, that [the litigation privilege] does not privilege

25

‘republications to nonparticipants in the action . . .’” GetFugu, Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th at 153

26

(citations omitted). Thus, the general public cannot be said to be anything close to a

27

“participant” in the proceedings and Defendants’ statements to the public via the press are not

28

part of a “judicial proceeding” under section 47(b)(2).

1

b) Defendants’ statements to the press were not made as part of
an “official proceeding”

2
Defendants also argue that anything a police officer does in any way related to an
3
investigation necessarily constitutes an “official proceeding” authorized by law under section
4
47(b)(3), and therefore any communication about the investigation is absolutely privileged by
5
law as long as it happened to be uttered by a police officer. (Mot. at 10:8-14.) No case law
6
supports Defendants’ sweeping view of this privilege.
7
California courts have relied almost exclusively on the same authority applicable to
8
“judicial proceedings” under section 47(b)(2) (discussed above) in developing the case law
9
applicable to “official proceedings” under section 47(b)(3). In so doing, they have reasoned
10
“[b]y analogy to cases extending the litigation privilege to statements made outside the
11
courtroom.” Hagberg v. California Fed. Bank FSB, 32 Cal. 4th 350, 362 (2004). But nothing
12
suggests that the “official proceeding” privilege should somehow extend beyond what the
13
judicial proceeding privilege itself would cover to protect communications whose function is
14
neither to investigate nor to prompt officials to investigate. [T]he communication must still be
15
‘in furtherance of the objects’ of the proceeding”—namely the investigation—and “not be
16
extraneous to the [proceeding].” Hawran v. Hixson, 209 Cal. App. 4th 256, 282–83 (2012)
17
(alteration in original) (suggesting but not deciding that a statement made in a press release about
18
an SEC investigation was not protected by the “official proceeding” privilege because it did not
19
further the purposes of the SEC investigation.”).
20
As explained above, Defendants’ statements to the press on March 25, 2015 in no way
21
performed the function of investigating Huskins and Quinn, nor was their function to prompt any
22
investigation by others. Instead, they were wholly “extraneous” statements made to the public at
23
large, separate and apart from the actual investigation and are thus not protected.
24
None of the cases that Defendants cite in their brief state otherwise. For example, Braun
25
v. Bureau of State Audits concerned statements contained in a final audit report that the state
26
auditor was required by law to create and report to “official administrative agencies.” 67 Cal.
27
App. 4th 1382, 1390 (1998). Unsurprisingly, the Court held that statements made in the report
28
12
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 12 Filed 08/25/16 Page 19 of 27

1

itself were entirely privileged. Likewise, Imig v. Ferrar merely restates the rule that

2

communications serving to prompt an internal affairs investigation are privileged. 70 Cal. App.

3

3d 48, 55 (1977). Here, unlike Braun and Imig, the statements to the press were in no way made

4

as part of an investigative report; indeed, they served no investigative function whatsoever.

5

Finally, it is important to put Defendants’ sweeping interpretation of the privilege in

6

context to show how out of touch it is with the common law immunities on which the privilege is

7

based. “The privilege recognized in section 47 derives from common law principles establishing

8

a defense to the tort of defamation.” Rusheen v. Cohen, 37 Cal. 4th 1048, 1057 (2006). Under

9

that common law, “while prosecutors, like all attorneys, were entitled to absolute immunity from

10

defamation liability for statements made during the course of judicial proceedings and relevant to

11

them, most statements made out of court received only good-faith immunity”—not absolute

12

immunity irrespective of malice. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 277 (1993) (citations

13

omitted). From this, the Supreme Court has held that the absolute protections of the litigation

14

privilege cannot possibly apply to statements to the press, even if made by prosecutors:

15
16
17
18

Comments to the media have no functional tie to the judicial process just because
they are made by a prosecutor. . . . The conduct of a press conference does not
involve the initiation of a prosecution, the presentation of the state’s case in court,
or actions preparatory for these functions. Statements to the press may be an
integral part of a prosecutor’s job . . . and they may serve a vital public function.
But in these respects a prosecutor is in no different position than other executive
officials who deal with the press, and, as noted above qualified immunity is the
norm for them.

19
Id. at 277-78 (cross reference omitted); see also Soliz v. Williams, 74 Cal. App. 4th 577, 590-91,
20
595 (1999) (discussing section 47(b) and the common law judicial immunity, and holding that
21
“the absolute judicial immunity against the imposition of monetary damages does not extend to
22
defamatory statements made by a judge to a reporter”). So too here, it would be completely
23
inconsistent with the common law underpinnings of section 47(b) to hold that police officers—
24
who are even further removed from courtroom proceedings—are somehow entitled to absolute
25
immunity for anything they say in any way touching on an investigation simply because those
26
statements happened to have been uttered by a police officer. That would immunize knowingly
27
false statements made to satisfy personal vendettas, even if the communication was solely made

1

to gratuitously injure an innocent victim. Such an interpretation cannot be squared with the

2

public balancing of interests the privilege was designed to maintain. See Rothman, 49 Cal. App.

3

4th at 1147 (holding that the “balancing of interests . . . disfavors application of the litigation

4

privilege to spiteful and harmful slurs made outside of the precincts which the privilege exists to

5

shelter”). Thus, Defendants’ expansive interpretation of section 47(b)(3) privilege to cover

6

anything said about a police investigation by a police officer must be rejected.

7

c) Defendants statements outside of the press release are also
unprotected, and require discovery

8
Defendants’ motion ignores Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendants made additional
9
gratuitous statements about Plaintiffs over and above what they said in the press conference as
10
part of their intentional campaign of disparagement to deflect attention away from Vallejo’s own
11
incompetence. (Compl. ¶¶ 47, 86.) Thus, for example, if Defendants made statements to their
12
friends, relatives, neighbors, or other non-witnesses repeating the same malicious and untruthful
13
statements, such communications can in no way be said to have been made as part of a “judicial
14
proceeding” or other “official proceeding,” for all the reasons discussed above. As such, there is
15
no conceivable immunity for these additional statements.
16
In addition, Defendants have refused Plaintiffs’ attempts to obtain discovery about these
17
key issues. As explained in Plaintiffs’ concurrently filed Rule 56(d) declaration of James
18
Wagstaffe, this anti-SLAPP motion cannot be adjudicated as a matter of due process until such
19
discovery is obtained.
20
21

2. Defendants’ Conduct Is Not Immunized Under California
Government Code Section 821.6

22

Under binding Ninth Circuit precedent, California Government Code section 821.6 does

23

not immunize Defendants’ conduct against claims of defamation. Section 821.6 states that “[a]

24

public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or

25

administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously and

26

without probable cause.” Cal. Gov’t Code § 821.6 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit has

27

recently held that this statute applies only to claims for malicious prosecution against public

28

employees, but not other tort claims. Garmon v. Cty. of Los Angeles, No. 12-55109, _ F.3d _,

malicious prosecution actions’” Id. (quoting Sullivan v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 12 Cal. 3d 710, 720

4

(1974)). As other courts have noted, limiting 821.6 to malicious prosecution claims (and thus

5

not allowing it to immunize any action that happens to be part of a police investigation) is

6

necessary as a matter of public policy. That is because “interpreting Section 821.6 to apply to all

7

tort claims would create ‘a regime of lawless law enforcement in California’ by giving the

8

‘state’s law enforcement authorities a license to kill or to do any other damage that strikes their

9

fancy, even maliciously and without probable cause, as long as they do it in the course of

10

investigating crime.’” Dinius v. Perdock, No. C 10-3498 MEJ, 2012 WL 1925666, at *9 (N.D.

11

Cal. May 24, 2012) (quoting Frank J. Menetrez, Lawless Law Enforcement: The Judicial

12

Invention of Absolute Immunity for Police and Prosecutors in California, 49 Santa Clara L. Rev.

13

393, 426 (2009) (extensively analyzing legislative history of section 821.6). 5

14

While it is true that some decisions from California’s lower courts had previously

15

reached a different conclusion, and read section 821.6 much more expansively, the Ninth Circuit

16

expressly rejected these decisions as misguided and inconsistent with California Supreme Court

17

precedent, and the statute’s legislative history. Garmon, 2016 WL 3606745, at *7. Defendants’

18

only cite to the same California Court of Appeals cases that the Ninth Circuit rejected. (See Mot.

19

at 11:10-16.) This Court is bound to follow the Ninth Circuit on matters of state law, even if it

20

conflicts with lower California courts of appeals. See Brewster v. Cty. of Shasta, 112 F. Supp. 2d

21

1185, 1188 & n.5 (E.D. Cal. 2000), aff’d, 275 F.3d 803 (9th Cir. 2001).

22

Here, Plaintiffs plainly do not bring a claim for malicious prosecution. Instead, Plaintiffs

23

brought a state tort claims for defamation. The Ninth Circuit makes clear that section 821.6 does

Numerous other federal district court decisions had previously reached the same
conclusion. See, e.g., Williams v. City of Merced, No. 1:10-CV-01999-MJS, 2013 WL 498854,
at *17 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2013); Tucker v. City of Richmond, No. C 12-1829 MEJ, 2012 WL

not immunize Defendants’ conduct in this regard.

3. The New York Times “Actual Malice” Standard Does Not Apply,
and Plaintiffs Have Readily Met that Standard Regardless

3
Defendants argue both that the “actual” malice standard applies to Plaintiffs’ defamation
4
claims and that there is insufficient evidence to meet that standard. Neither argument has merit.
5
a) Plaintiffs were not public figures
6
Plaintiffs did not voluntarily participate, in any way, in the controversy giving rise to
7
Defendants’ coordinated disparagement campaign, and therefore Plaintiffs are not public figures.
8
“[A] ‘public figure’ plaintiff must have undertaken some voluntary act through which he seeks to
9
influence the resolution of the public issues involved.” Reader’s Digest Assn. v. Superior Court,
10
37 Cal. 3d 244, 254 (1984) (emphasis in original); Wolston v. Reader’s Digest Ass’n, Inc., 443
11
U.S. 157, 167 (1979) (“A private individual is not automatically transformed into a public figure
12
just by becoming involved in or associated with a matter that attracts public attention.”). “To
13
hold otherwise would create an ‘open season’ for all who sought to defame persons convicted of
14
a crime.” Wolston, 443 U.S. 157 at 169. Defendants only citation in support of this argument is
15
to a dissent to a denial of a petition for certiorari. See Lorain Journal Co. v. Milkovich, 474 U.S.
16
953, 964 (1985). But even the Lorain Journal Co. dissent recognized that “a court must focus on
17
the ‘nature and extent of an individual’s participation in the particular controversy giving rise to
18
the defamation.’” Id. at 963 n.8 (quoting Wolston, 443 U.S. at 167). Defendants offer no facts
19
or legal reason that Plaintiffs are public figures. At all times, Plaintiffs were private citizens,
20
living life outside of the public eye. (Huskins Decl. 2; Quinn Decl. ¶ 2.) Prior to the defamatory
21
statements at issue, Plaintiffs took no voluntary steps to inject themselves in the action. To the
22
contrary, Plaintiffs were unwilling victims of a terrifying assault and kidnapping, which
23
Defendants exacerbated when they maliciously defamed Plaintiffs in front of the international
24
news media.
25
b) Even if “actual malice” were required, Plaintiffs have
demonstrated such malice

26
27
28

Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude
that Defendants acted with actual malice while engaging in their deliberate campaign of

1

disparagement. Because this is a factual question, this motion is treated analogous to a Rule 56

2

motion for summary judgment, and all facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to

3

Plaintiffs. Rogers v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 57 F. Supp. 2d 973, 981 (C.D. Cal. 1999);

4

see also Metabolife Int'l, Inc. v. Wornick, 264 F.3d 832, 840 (9th Cir. 2001). Thus, the motion

5

can only be granted if no reasonable juror could find for Plaintiffs. Metabolife, 264 F.3d at 840.

6

“To show actual malice, a public figure must demonstrate the defendant uttered the

7

statement ‘with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or

8

not.’” Nguyen-Lam v. Cao, 171 Cal. App. 4th 858, 867 (2009) (quoting New York Times Co. v.

9

Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 278–79 (1964)). Here, there is more than enough evidence from which a

10

reasonable juror could infer that Defendants made the statements knowing they were false as part

11

of a coordinated campaign to cover up VPD’s failed investigation. For example, Det. Mustard’s

12

absurd statement that rape victims like to “re-live” their sexual assault, and therefore Huskins

13

(and Quinn) must be recreating that horrid experience by fabricating an abduction story is so

14

unbelievable, that it suggests a deeper motivation for VPD’s campaign of disparagement here.

15

(See Jane Huskins Decl. ¶ 13.) Similarly absurd was Det. Mustard’s wild assertion—made at a

16

time when Denise was still missing—that this case was a situation like “Gone Girl,” where a

17

woman had faked her own disappearance and rape. (Id ¶ 11.) Moreover, the suggestion by

18

another detective, also made while Huskins was still missing, that he could tell Huskins’s mother

19

what had happened in five year’s time—after any statute of limitations would run—likewise is

20

suggestive of an intentional conspiracy to conceal and misrepresent the truth. (Id ¶ 16.)

21

Further, Defendants have flat out lied in their declarations to the Court in the briefing on

22

this motion, again raising an inference of an intentional and continuing effort at falsification and

23

cover-up. All three Declarations submitted by Defendants say that Huskins refused to speak to

24

the Huntington Beach Police Department. (Mustard Decl. ¶ 18, O’Connel Decl. ¶ 6. Park Decl. ¶

25

12.) But, as both Denise’s testimony and the Huntington Beach Police Report itself demonstrate,

26

Denise did speak with HBPD for an hour or more, and was entirely cooperative. (Clune Decl.

27

Ex. A; Huskins Decl. ¶ 12.) Defendants’ statements to the contrary suggest an ongoing

28

campaign of disparagement to save their own reputations at the expense of those of Quinn and

1

Huskins.

2

At the very least, there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that

3

Defendants intentional avoidance of facts that might contradict their absurd “Gone Girl theories”

4

was reckless, which is all that is required to demonstrate constitutional malice. A failure to

5

investigate may evidence actual malice where that failure “was a product of a deliberate decision

6

not to acquire knowledge of facts that might confirm the probable falsity of [the subject] charges

7

. . . .” Antonovich v. Superior Court, 234 Cal. App. 3d 1041, 1048 (1991) (quoting Harte-Hanks

8

Commc’ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 692 (1989)). Here, VPD officers, including

9

Mustard, Park, and O’Connell, intentionally ignored reams of evidence that was inconsistent

10

with their fabricated story, while supposedly crediting wholly absurd theories. In addition to the

11

evidence already described above, Defendants put Quinn’s phone on airplane mode while Denise

12

was still missing, even though Quinn told VPD the kidnapper would be contacting him at that

13

number, and thus missed four communications from the kidnapper. (Quinn Decl. ¶¶ 17-18.)

14

When Huskins was found alive, Defendants somehow concluded Huskins was not acting like

15

someone who had been assaulted, kidnapped, and drugged is “supposed to act” (O’Connell Decl.

16

¶ 6), even though they had never actually spoken with nor seen Huskins. (Huskins Decl. ¶ 18,

17

23.) VPD also ignored the fact that Huskins and Quinn’s stories completely corroborated one

18

another’s. (See Huskins Decl. ¶ 3; Quinn Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendants further ignored the “darker

19

impression circles” under Denise’s eyes found by HBPD (Clune Decl. Ex. A, p. 7; Huskins Decl.

20

¶ 5), which was consistent with what she and Quinn had told the police about how they were

21

blindfolded (Huskins Decl. ¶¶ 3-5; Quinn Decl. ¶ 3.) Instead, VPD ignored obvious and

22

available explanations to developments to credit their absurd, self-interested lies: for example

23

that because Denise was “wearing sunglasses” that therefore she must have faked the whole

24

thing. (See Huskins Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8-9.) In addition, rather than taking time to actually investigate

25

the crime, within hours of Denise being discovered alive, Detective Mustard insisted that he did

26

not believe the story about the “frog men” and immediately began attacking her. (Nicholas

27

Huskins Decl. ¶ 14.) This immediate and purposeful avoidance of the facts to fit a pre-

28

conceived—and entirely absurd—narrative alone is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable
18
Case No. 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EF

Case 2:16-cv-00603-TLN-EFB Document 12 Filed 08/25/16 Page 25 of 27

1

juror could infer a deliberate decision not to acquire information about the kidnapping, and thus a

2

reckless disregard for the truth. 6

3

Similarly demonstrating such reckless behavior is the completely unjustified inference

4

that, because Huskins’s cousin was a lawyer, and that he was supporting her on the scene, that

5

Huskins had therefore “lawyered up” and must be guilty. This was her cousin—not a “retained

6

lawyer”—and Vallejo knew that. (Nicholas Huskins Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.) In addition, our entire

7

criminal justice system is predicated on the notion that people are not guilty just because they

8

want a lawyer. This presents a particularly egregious instance where such an inference is

9

unfounded. After all, throughout this period, Mustard had been telling Denise’s confidants—

10

including her mother and her cousin—that Denise had been lying and would face criminal

11

prosecution. (Id. ¶ 14.) Thus, it obvious that she might seek legal help despite her innocence.
Finally, Defendants’ declarations, if taken at face value, provide more than sufficient

12
13

evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer a reckless disregard for the truth. Mustard

14

admits he actually possessed serious doubts regarding the circumstances of Plaintiffs’ assault

15

and kidnapping, but Defendants nevertheless went ahead with their press release. Mustard states

16

in his sworn declaration that “I did not know what had happened” and that he had “considered

17

multiple different theories that could have resulted in criminal charges being filed against various

18

persons, had sufficient evidence been found.” (Mustard Decl. ¶¶ 16-17 (emphasis added).) A

19

reasonable juror could infer malice from these statements, though the full picture readily

20

supports an inference of deliberate knowledge of falsity here. 7

21

Finally, as described in Plaintiffs’ concurrently filed Rule 56(d) motion for discovery,

22
23
6

24
25
26
27
28

Defendants’ declarations also make hay of the supposedly low ransom amounts requested
by the kidnapper. But to get there, Defendants must intentionally ignore the emails Quinn
showed them explaining that the ransom amount was designed to avoid triggering a $10,000
reporting limit regulation. (Quinn Decl. Ex. A.)
7

As Defendants acknowledge, Defendant City of Vallejo is vicariously liable for the
conduct of its employees. See Cal. Gov’t Code § 815.2. Thus, because Plaintiffs have
adequately plead their defamation claim as against Mustard, Park, and the unknown Doe
Defendants, Plaintiffs have successfully plead the defamation claim against the City of Vallejo.

1

because malice is a deeply rooted factual issue for which Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery

2

before their claims can be stricken, Plaintiffs should be allowed discovery on the issue of actual

3

malice before the Court could strike this defamation claim.

4

B.

PLAINTIFF HUSKINS CAN ESTABLISH A PROBABILITY OF PREVAILING ON HER
INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS CLAIM

5
Defendants challenge Huskins’s IIED claim for the same reasons as the defamation
6
claim: California Civil Code section 47(b), California Government Code section 821.6, and the
7

New York Times standard. Defendants do not challenge the IIED claim on other grounds. 8 As

8
explained above, neither asserted privilege or immunity applies here. The statements made to
9
the public lack the “functional connection” to judicial or official proceedings to be covered by
10
the litigation privilege. See Rothman, 49 Cal. App. 4th at 1141. Similarly, California
11
Government Code section 821.6 applies only to malicious prosecution claims and thus does not
12
immunize Plaintiffs’ IIED claim. Garmon, 2016 WL 3606745, at *7; Williams, 2013 WL
13
498854, at *17 (“section 821.6 does not automatically immunize Defendants’ investigatory
14
conduct against Plaintiff’s IIED claim”). Finally, Plaintiffs have established that they were not
15
public figures under the New York Times standard because they took no “voluntary act through
16
which [they] seek[] to influence the resolution of the public issues involved.” Reader’s Digest
17
Assn., 37 Cal. 3d at 254. Thus, Defendants’ motion to strike the IIED claim fails for the same
18
reasons that the motion to strike the defamation claim does.
19
V.

CONCLUSION

20
For the aforementioned reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny
21
Defendants’ motion to strike. To the extent the motion is granted in any respect, Plaintiffs
22
should be given leave to amend.
23
24
25
26
27
28

8

Importantly, Defendants do not challenge Quinn’s IIED claim based on his illegal 18hour interrogation. Thus, his IIED claim clearly remains regardless of Huskins’s claim.
