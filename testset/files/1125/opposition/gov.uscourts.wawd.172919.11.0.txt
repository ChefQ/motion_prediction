v.
NORTHSTAR LOCATION SERVICES,
LLC, a New York Limited Liability
Company,
Defendant.

COME NOW, Plaintiffs, DONOVAN and JANICE FLECK, by and
through their counsel, ROBERT MITCHELL, and respond to Defendant’s
12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION and FACTS

Plaintiffs’ complaint asserts that Defendant’s letter threatening to report a
debt to “credit bureaus throughout the country” violated the provision of the
Washington Collection Agency Act that prohibits debt collectors from
threatening to impair a debtor’s credit rating while attempting to collect a debt,
inter alia. RCW 19.16.250(9).

1

Defendant filed this Motion to Dismiss, which is based on two distinct

2

theories. The first theory is that Defendant’s letter could not possibly violate the

3

statute because the statements made therein are technically true. Defendant’s

4

second theory is that the threat to report the debt to “credit bureaus throughout

5

the country” was a benign statement of the action Defendant would take and

legally could take under the law. Therefore, the statement could not have been a
“threat to impair Plaintiffs’ credit rating.”
The problems with Defendant’s theories are simple and straight forward.
First, Defendant’s theories are based on an unpublished state court case with
different facts, which completely missed the mark when analyzing the meaning
of the “least sophisticated consumer standard,” and which directly contradicts
published federal authority on the issue. Therefore, the case should not be used
as authority to determine the merits of this case because, quite simply, there is a
reason the Court voted to not publish the ruling.
Second, Defendant admits that the “least sophisticated consumer standard”
applies in this case, yet Defendant completely misconstrues exactly what that
standard means. (See Defendant’s Motion at pp. 3-4, lines 18 – 23).
Third, Defendant completely ignores the progeny of case law that holds
that even factually true statements can be threatening, false, or misleading; that
intent is not even an issue when examining collector communications under this
strict liability remedial statute; and Courts are directed to liberally construe the
statutes in favor of consumers.
Given the degree of deference Courts are instructed to give to Plaintiffs’
consumer claims, it is borderline frivolous for Defendant to suggest through its

Regardless, because Defendant’s motion presents matters outside the
pleadings, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss must be treated as a Motion for
Summary Judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). As a result, Summary Judgment
standards must apply and this Court is required to view all facts in a light most
favorable to Plaintiffs. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Therefore, the question before this
Court is whether reasonable persons could reach but one conclusion regarding
whether the language contained in Defendant’s collection letter was threatening
in nature. Id.

12

16

Given the facts of this case and the strict manner in which collector actions
are scrutinized under these strict liability remedial statutes that must be liberally
construed in favor of consumers, it would be nearly impossible to determine that
a reasonable juror could only conclude that Defendant’s letter was nonthreatening. In fact, it is not only possible but likely that reasonable jurors would

17

find the “benign” statement harassing, abusive, threatening, and in violation of

18

the statutes. Therefore, this Court should deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and allow Plaintiffs to proceed with discovery to determine what exactly
Defendant’s motives were in crafting and including the offending language in the
collection letter at issue.

LEGAL ARGUMENT

Standard For Determining Motion To Dismiss.

3
4
5
6
7

If, on a motion…to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim
upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are
presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated
as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule
56…
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).

8

In this case, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss includes: 1) An unpublished

9

state court case; 2) Facts concerning Defendant’s intent; 3) Arguments

10

concerning the “least sophisticated consumer” standard; 4) Arguments

11

concerning the veracity of the statement contained in the collection letter at issue;

12

as well as other issues not present in previous pleadings in this case. Therefore,

13

pursuant to the above-referenced rule, this Court should use CR 56 to determine

14

the proposed dismissal of this action.

15

B.

16

Standard For Determining Summary Judgment.
A motion for summary judgment should only be granted only when:

17
18
19
20

the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show
that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Blume Dev. Co., 115 Wn.2d 506, 516, 799 P.2d 250 (1990)). No genuine issue
of material fact exists if the Court, after considering the evidence in a light most
favorable to the non-moving party, concludes that reasonable persons could reach
only one conclusion. Reynolds v. Hicks, 134 Wn2d. 491, 495, 951 P.2d 761
(1998)(citing Wilson v. Steinbach, 98 Wn.2d 434, 437, 656 P.2d 1030 (1982)).
The burden for establishing uncontroverted material facts initially rests
with the moving party. Berger v. Sonneland, 144 Wn.2d 91, 103, 26 P.3d 257
(2001)(citing Folsom v. Burger King, 135 Wn.2d 658, 663, 958 P.2d 301 (1998)).
A party can meet this burden by either setting forth its version of the facts and
allege that there is no genuine issue, or the party can meet this burden by pointing
out that the non-moving party does not have sufficient evidence to support its
case. Guile v. Ballard Community Hospital, 70 Wn. App 18, 21, 851 P.2d 689
(1993)(citing Hash v. Children’s Orthopedic Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 110 Wn.2d 912,
916, 757 P.2d 507 (1988) and Young v. Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 112 Wn.2d
216, 225 n.1, 770 P.2d 182 (1989)).
In this case, Defendant has not even met its initial burden because

18

Defendant’s own pleadings illustrate that different Courts have decided the

19

matter differently and that the outcome is “fact” specific. The facts and law

20

contained in Defendant’s pleadings illustrate that a genuine issue of material fact

21
22
23
24
25

exists in this case concerning whether reasonable minds could consider the
language contained in Defendant’s letter a threat to impair Plaintiffs’ credit
ratings.

This matter is further complicated by the fact that the Court must

liberally construe this strict liability remedial statute to Plaintiffs’ benefit.

Defendant’s Theory That A Technically True Statement Cannot
Possibly Violate The Statutes At Issue, Especially Where Defendant
Lacked Intent, Is Untrue, Unsupported, And Should Be Rejected,
Especially Where It Is Contrary To The Least Sophisticated
Consumer Standard, And Where It Conflicts With This Strict
Liability Remedial Statute’s Clear Intent That The Statute Should Be
Liberally Construed To Benefit Consumers Like Plaintiffs.

An unlawful misrepresentation need not be made willfully or intentionally.
Padilla v. Payco General American Credits, Inc., 161 F. Supp 2d 264
(S.D.N.Y. 2001). More importantly, a literally true letter can still convey a
misleading impression in violation of the FDCPA. Sledge v. Sands, 182 F.R.D.
255 (N.D. Ill. 1998). Most importantly, in analyzing the “False or Misleading
Representations” portion of the FDCPA, and the subsequent “Least Sophisticated
Consumer” standard adopted to interpret the same, one Court stated:
In the general context of consumer protection - of which the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act is a part - it does not seem 'unfair to require
that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of
proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.
Russell v. Equifax A.R.S., 74 F.3d 30 (2d Cir. 1996).
Defendant’s motion astutely points out that Courts use the “least

19

sophisticated consumer standard” in determining what is meant by a collector’s

20

communication and whether the communication is false or misleading. Wade v.

21

Regional Credit Ass'n, 87 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 1996); and Swanson v. Southern

22

Oregon Credit Serv., 869 F.2d 1222 (9th Cir. 1988). However, Defendant’s

23

motion completely misconstrues the meaning behind the “least sophisticated

24

consumer standard” and the effect it has on the statute’s intent.

"The basic purpose of the least-sophisticated-consumer standard is to
ensure that the FDCPA protects all consumers, the gullible as well as the
shrewd." Clomon v. Jackson, 988 F.2d 1314 (2d Cir. 1993). In analyzing the

4

“False or Misleading Representations” portion of the FDCPA, and the subsequent

5

“Least Sophisticated Consumer Standard” adopted to interpret the same, Courts

6

have held that the FDCPA is a remedial statute to be liberally construed in favor

7

of the consumer. Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F.3d 1107 (10th cir. 2002). The “least

8

sophisticated consumer” standard is an “objective test.” Lewis v. ACB Bus.

In determining what is meant by a debt collector’s communication with a
debtor, the Court should keep in mind that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
is a strict liability, remedial statute that must be liberally construed to the benefit
of consumers. Baker v. G.C. Servs. Corp., 677 F.2d 775 (9th Cir. 1982); Johnson
v. Riddle, 305 F.3d 1107 (10th cir. 2002); Fox v. Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc., 15

statute to the benefit of consumers. (See RCW 19.86.920)(stating: “To this end
this act shall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes may be served.)

3

6

Given the above, Defendant’s intent in drafting the letter is
inconsequential. It matters even less whether the language contained in
Defendant’s collection letter was technically true. The only issues to be resolved
are whether the least sophisticated consumer would have understood the threat to

7

report the debt to “credit bureaus throughout the country” as a threat to impair

8

Plaintiffs’ credit ratings. This question must be answered in a manner that gives

9
10
11
12
13
14
15

effect to the statutes at issue. Therefore, in answering the above question, the
Court must be mindful of the fact that all questions of fact must be construed in a
light most favorable to Plaintiffs (CR 56), the statutes at issue are remedial strict
liability statutes, Defendant’s intent is inconsequential, Plaintiff’s impression of
what was meant by the statement should be interpreted using the least
sophisticated consumer test, which is an objective test, and the statutes and the
facts of this case must be liberally construed to the benefit of Plaintiffs.

As a result, it is would be virtually impossible for this Court, or any other
Court for that matter, to find that there are no genuine issues of material fact
present in this case, and that Defendant should be given a pass in this lawsuit
despite the fact that Defendant intentionally went perilously close to an area of
proscribed conduct (if Defendant did not dive directly into the area of proscribed
conduct). Therefore, Defendant should be held to account for such actions rather
than being summarily dismissed from this lawsuit.
