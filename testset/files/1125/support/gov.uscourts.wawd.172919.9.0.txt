I. MOTION AND RELIEF REQUESTED
COMES NOW Defendant CREDIT PROTECTION ASSOCIATION, L.P. ("CPA"),
by and through its attorney David J. Elkanich, and moves the Court to dismiss the Complaint
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because plaintiffs fail to state any claims upon which
relief can be granted.
Plaintiffs seek relief for alleged violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
and Washington state law, based upon a sentence contained in a letter CPA sent Donovan

Fleck on September 13, 2010. That letter states, in relevant part, "[i]f this account is not

settled, your name and account number will be reported to credit bureaus throughout the
country." The plaintiffs do not allege that this language is false, and do not allege that it is
illegal to furnish information to the bureaus. Instead, the plaintiffs misinterpret a Washington
statute to assert that the letter threatens to impair their credit if they did not pay. There is,
however, nothing in the defendant's letter that violates the law. It is a truthful statement
consistent with Federal and Washington state consumer laws.
Il. STATEMENT OF FACTS
Each of Plaintiffs' allegations stem from one sentence in a letter CPA sent Plaintiff
Donovan Fleck.! In that letter, CPA states, in relevant part, "[iJf this account is not settled,
your name and account number will be reported to credit bureaus throughout the country."
Exhibit A.
Plaintiffs' complaint asserts several violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act ("FDCPA"), 15 U.S.C. 1692. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege CPA violated 0x00A71692d,
0x00A71692f, and 0x00A70x00A71692e(2), (5), and (10):
e Section 1692d states, "[a] debt collector may not engage in any conduct
the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any
person in connection with the collection of a debt."

e Section 1692f states that it is an unfair practice to use any unfair or
unconscionable means to attempt to collect a debt.

0x00B0 Section 1692e(2) states, "[a] debt collector may not use any false,
deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the
collection of a debt" and specifically prohibits "[t]he false
representation of... (A) the character, amount, or legal status of any
debt; or (B) any services rendered or compensation which may be
lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt."

0x00B0 Section 1692e(5) prohibits a collector from threatening to take any
action that "cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken."

0x00B0 Section 1692cent(10) prohibits "the use of any false representation or

deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain
information concerning a consumer."

Plaintiffs' complaint also alleges CPA violated the Revised Code of Washington,
0x00A70x00A719.16.250(9) and (10), which prohibits collection agencies from threatening a debtor with
impairment of his credit rating if a claim is not paid. Finally, Plaintiffs also allege CPA
committed the tort of outrage under Washington state law.

The language contained in CPA's letter does not violate the FDCPA or Washington
state law, and therefore, Plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed.

I. ARGUMENT

A. THE LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN CPA'S LETTER DOES NOT
VIOLATE THE FDCPA

As explained above, the FDCPA prohibits collectors from harassing debtors, from
using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt, from using false, deceptive or
misleading representations, and from threatening to take action they cannot legally take, or
that is not intended to be taken. FDCPA 0x00A70x00A7 1692d, 1692f, 1692e, et. seq. CPA's letter does
not violate any of these sections because it is not a threat in any way.

This Court applies the "least sophisticated consumer" standard to these allegations to
determine if a consumer would have been misled by CPA's letter. Donohue v. Quick Collect,
Inc., 592 F.3d 1027, 1030 (9th Cir. 2010); see Wade v. Regional Credit Ass'n, 87 F.3d 1098,
1099 (9th Cir. 1996). The "least sophisticated consumer" standard serves a dual purpose, "[i]t
(1) ensures the protection of all consumers, even the naive and the trusting, against deceptive

debt collection practices, and (2) protects debt collectors against liability for bizarre or

idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices." Clark v. Capital Credit & Collection
Services, Inc., 460 F.3d 1162, 1180 (9th Cir. 2006) (concurrence, citing Clomon v. Jackson,
988 F2d 1314, 1320 (2d Cir. 1993)).

The language at issue in this case is not a threat of any kind, it does not harass, oppress
or abuse the intended recipient, nor is it false, deceptive or misleading in any manner. The
language conveys information to Mr. Fleck, that in the event he does not pay the debt he
owes, CPA will furnish information about the debt to the credit bureaus. Nothing in the
statement violates the FDCPA.

The language in CPA's letter is far more benign than language in a similar case in
which FDCPA claims were dismissed. See Wade v. Regional Credit Association, 87 F.3d
1098 (9th Cir. 1996). In Wade, the defendant sent a debtor a letter which stated: "[iJ]f not
paid TODAY, it may STOP YOU FROM OBTAINING credit TOMORROW." Jd. at 1100
(emphasis in original). The Ninth Circuit held that this letter did not violate the FDCPA,
because it was not "a threat to take action" that could not be legally taken, it was not
"unconscionable," nor was the letter threatening. Jd.

The court also stated that "the notice told Wade correctly that she had an unpaid debt,
and properly informed her that failure to pay might adversely affect her credit reputation.
There was no false representation ..." Jd. In fact, the court held that the letter was
"informational, notifying Wade that failure to pay could adversely affect her credit
reputation." Jd. The language contained in the letter in Wade was much more threatening
that the statement contained in CPA's letter, which merely informs Mr. Fleck that in the event
he does not pay, his information will be furnished to the bureaus. Therefore, Plaintiffs'

FDCPA claims should be dismissed as a matter of law.

Moreover, Washington courts interpreting the FDCPA have found letters with
language less threatening than CPA's to be in compliance with the FDCPA. In Glover v.
Account Receivable, Inc., 111 Wn. App. 1022, 2002 WL 737491 (2002) (unpublished
opinion)', the court looked to the Wade decision and held that a letter which stated, " [w]ithin
three days this letter will become a permanent part of your credit record with the Credit
Bureau unless paid" did not violate the FDCPA or Washington state law. Jd. at *3. The court
held, "[t]he language in Wade is much stronger than the language" sent in Glover, and
therefore the language did not violate the "least sophisticated consumer standard." Jd.

Like Wade and Glover, the letter sent by CPA does not violate of the FDCPA. CPA's
letter simply stated that "[i]f this account is not settled, your name and account number will be
reported to credit bureaus throughout the country." Exhibit `A. CPA is not liable for any
bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretation by Plaintiffs. Clark, 460 F.3d at 1180.

B. THE LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN CPA'S LETTER DOES NOT
VIOLATE WASHINGTON LAW

1. Consumer Agency Act
Plaintiffs argue that CPA's letter also violates the Washington Collection Agency Act
("CAA"). The CAA states, in relevant part, that a collection agency shall not:
(9) Communicate or threaten to communicate, the existence
of a claim to a person other than one who might reasonably be

expected to be liable on the claim in any manner other than
through proper legal action, process, or proceedings ...

 

? After a diligent search, counsel for CPA was not able to locate a local rule addressing the use of
unpublished opinions in the Western District of Wasington. Accordingly, this unpublished opinion is
being cited for illustrative purposes only.

(10) Threaten the debtor with impairment of his credit if a
claim in not paid.

RCW 19.16.250. The statute, however, also creates an exception, which states, "a [collection
agency] may inform a credit reporting bureau of the existence of a claim ..." RCW
19.16.250(9)(a). CPA's letter fits within this exception.

These identical claims were also addressed in Glover, where the court examined a
collection agency's letter which stated "[w]ithin three days this letter will become a
permanent part of your credit record with the Credit Bureau unless paid." The Glover court
held that this language did not violate the CAA. Glover, at *2. The court looked to the
language of the CAA and correctly explained that the letter:

[D]id not threaten `impairment of [Glover's] credit rating' if he

did not pay, as prohibited by RCW 19.26.250(10). Rather,

consistent with RCW 19.16.250(9)(a), [the collection agency]

advised Glover that if he did not pay his debt, it would be

become `part of this credit report.'
111 Wn.Ap. at *2. The court held that, as explained by the exception noted in the CAA and
detailed above, a collector can make a truthful, negative credit report to a credit bureau and
truthfully inform debtors that they are going to make such a report. Jd.

The language in CPA's letter is analogous with the language in the letter in Glover.
CPA simply stated that failure to settle the account would result in information about the
account being furnished to credit bureaus across the country. CPA did not threaten to destroy
or ruin Plaintiffs' credit, nor did CPA state that Plaintiffs would be unable to get credit in the
future. CPA did not make any representation on how the information would affect or impact

Plaintiffs' credit. It simply stated the truth, that if he did not settle his account, it would

inform credit bureaus. As the Glover court held, that is not a violation of Washington law.

2. Consumer Protection Act

Plaintiffs also allege that CPA's letter violated the Consumer Protection Act. Under
the Consumer Protection Act, a violation of the CAA is a per se violation of the Consumer
Protection Act. Plaintiffs' basis for liability under the Consumer Protection Act is apparently
based solely on the court finding liability under the CAA or the FDCPA. As in Glover,
because CPA did not violate the CAA or the FDCPA, the Consumer Protection Act claim
should be dismissed as well.

3. Tort of Outrage
Finally, Plaintiffs claim that CPA committed the tort of outrage. Under Washington
law, the elements of tort of outrage are:
(1) [E]xtreme and outrageous conduct; (2) intentional or
reckless infliction of emotional distress; and (3) actual result to
the plaintiff of severe emotional distress. The conduct in
question must be so outrageous in character, and so extreme in
degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to
be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized
community.
Humble v. Boeing Co., 305 F.3d 1004, 1012 (9th Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original).

As discussed above, CPA's letter was not in violation of state or federal law, and
therefore cannot possibly be considered extreme and outrageous. Plaintiffs allege that Janice
Fleck has terminal cancer, and that Donovan Fleck, to whom CPA sent the letter, paid the
debt rather than paying for her medicine. Those allegations are no doubt tragic; however,
there are no allegations that CPA knew of her condition, or of Mr. Fleck's dilemma in paying

bills, and any inference to that end would simply be wrong. There are no allegations that

either of the Plaintiffs ever even spoke to CPA. Those facts, serious and tragic, cannot on

 

their own found the basis of the tort of outrage.

Case 3:11-cv-05035-RBL Document9 Filed 01/25/11 Page 8 of 9

Even if the court found that CPA had violated the FDCPA or Washington law, the
language of the letter alone does not rise to the level of "outrageous in character, and so
extreme in degree, as to go beyond ail possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as
atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." Jd. Therefore, Plaintiffs' claim
of outrage should be dismissed as well.

IV. CONCLUSION
Because CPA's letter does not violate the FDCPA or Washington state law, Plaintiffs'

complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.
