Shaw LLP, Douglas B. Allen, and Burnett, Burnett, & Allen in preparing the Preliminary

4

Infringement Contentions (“Infringement Contentions”) of Richard and Brant Berger in their patent

5

infringement action against Rossignol Ski Company. As a direct result of defendants’ blunders, the

6

District Court dismissed the Bergers’ infringement action on summary judgment on April 25, 2006.

7

Rather than admitting their mistakes, defendants attempted to conceal them from the Bergers, the

8

federal court, and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.

9

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

10

Defendant Allen claims that the Bergers’ lawsuit against him is barred by the one-year

11

malpractice statute of limitations (CCP § 340.6) because more than one year passed between the

12

April 25, 2006 judgment in Berger v. Rossignol and the September 12, 2007 filing of the Bergers’

13

complaint in the present case.1 Allen’s argument fails for several reasons.

14

Allen readily concedes that the statute of limitations is “tolled while representation

15

continues on the same matter” in which the alleged malpractice took place.2 The Bergers’

16

complaint alleges that “an attorney-client relationship existed between plaintiffs and defendants” at

17

all times relevant to the matters alleged3 and “at least through the Federal Circuit’s denial of the

18

appeal on January 16, 2007.”4 Accordingly, because less than one year passed between January

19

16, 2007 and the September 12, 2007 filing of the complaint in this action, the statute of

20

limitations did not expire.
Allen improperly attempts to circumvent the Bergers’ allegations by arguing—without

21
22

evidentiary support—that (1) he “was neither attorney of record on the appeal or is admitted to the

23

Federal Circuit Court of Appeals”; and (2) that his March 9, 2005 retainer letter to the Bergers

24

terminated his representation upon entry the April 25, 2006 judgment.5 Both of those unsupported

25

The Bergers’ action was initially filed in California state court on September 12, 2007. It was later removed to this
court on October 17, 2007.

assertions are absent from the complaint, rebutted by the Bergers’ allegations, disputed, and,

2

moreover, may not form the basis of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). As such, Allen’s

3

motion must be denied.
That said, should the court consider Allen’s unsupported assertions, the court must consider

5

his motion to be one for summary judgment.6 If so, the Bergers cross-move for summary

6

adjudication that the statute of limitations does not bar any claim of the Bergers against Allen. As

7

set forth in the declaration of Richard Berger, Allen continued to represent and advise the Bergers

8

through the their Rule 60 motion to vacate the judgment, the subsequent Federal Circuit appeal,

9

and the Petition for Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court (which was filed by Allen on

10

April 12, 2007 and denied on October 1, 2007). Allen’s assertion that he stopped representing the

11

Bergers on April 25, 2006 is blatantly false.
Finally, Allen’s assertion that all of the Bergers’ claims are governed by the one-year

12
13

statute of limitations under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 340.6 is simply wrong.7 Section 340.6 does not

14

apply to “actual fraud.”8 Thus even if the Bergers’ claims against Allen for professional

15

negligence, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty were time-barred, the Bergers’ fraud

16

claim would survive.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

17
18

I.

Facts Alleged in Complaint

19

A.

The Berger Patents

20

The Bergers invented a novel step-in binding (the Berger Binding) that was awarded two

21

United States Patents (Nos. 5,913,530 (the ‘530 patent) and 6,196,569 (the ‘569 patent)).9

22

Rossignol, a large French ski company, infringed those patents.10

23

B.

Preparation for Berger v. Rossignol - The Suyat Claim Chart

24

In preparing to sue Rossignol, the Bergers’ patent attorney, Reginald Suyat, prepared a

claim chart (the Suyat Claim Chart) explaining how the Rossignol binding infringed both patents.11

2

In early 2003, the Bergers began consulting with Slobodin and his law firm, Seyfarth Shaw,

3

about filing a patent infringement action against Rossignol. On October 13, 2003, Suyat sent

4

Slobodin a copy of the Suyat Claim Chart. 12
The Bergers retained Allen and his firm, Burnett, Burnett, & Allen, to initiate the patent

infringement action against Rossignol. But because Allen had no prior patent infringement

7

experience, Slobodin and Seyfarth agreed to advise, supervise, and assist Allen in the action.13

8

C.

9

Suit was filed in the Northern District of California in June 2005 and assigned to the Hon.

10

Charles R. Breyer. Judge Breyer held the initial Case Management Conference on November 18,

11

2005.14 Later that day, Allen met with Slobodin and Suyat. After that meeting, Slobodin promised

12

plaintiffs that he would supervise the case to make sure all important deadlines were met and

13

appropriate procedures were followed, and that he soon would file his formal appearance in Berger

14

v. Rossignol.15
D.

15

Initiation of Berger v. Rossignol - Collaboration Between Defendants

The Bergers’ Infringement Contentions and the Defective Seyfarth Shaw
Claim Chart

16

The Patent Scheduling Order in Berger v. Rossignol mandated that Plaintiffs Infringement

17
18

Contentions were to be served by December 3, 2005. Defendants missed that deadline because

19

Seyfarth failed to provide the promised support. On December 16, two weeks after the deadline

20

had passed, Allen wrote to Slobodin requesting a claim chart to comply with the court’s order.

21

Almost three weeks later, on January 3, 2006, Slobodin and Seyfarth sent Allen a modified and

22

fatally defective claim chart. Allen served that claim chart with the Bergers’ Infringement

23

Contentions the following day on January 4.
Significantly, and in contrast to the Suyat chart, the Seyfarth Claim chart included the

24
25

Rossignol “coupler base” (item 4) as part of the “lower attachment.” The ‘530 patent requires that

1

the “lower attachment” rotate “relative to” the “upper attachment.” But in the Rossignol product

2

the “coupler base” rotates with the upper attachment, not relative to it.16
In addition to providing Allen with a faulty claim chart, Seyfarth also sent Allen a Seyfarth

3
4

memorandum discussing the validity of the ‘569 patent. As an apparent result of that memo,

5

defendants did not include a claim chart or any mention of the ‘569 patent in the Infringement

6

Contentions.17
Additionally, the Bergers’ Infringement Contentions made no contention of infringement

7
8

under the Doctrine of Equivalents of either the ‘530 or ‘569 patents.18

10

Rossignol’s Summary Judgment Motion - Defendants’ Concealment of Their
Mistakes

Seizing on defendants’ blunders, on February 21, 2006, Rossignol promptly filed a motion

12

for summary judgment asserting that (1) the Bergers’ Infringement Contentions confirmed

13

noninfringement of the ‘530 patent; and (2) the Berger’s case should be dismissed as to the ‘569

14

patent because no contentions were made as to that patent.19
On March 14, 2006, Seyfarth filed an appearance in Berger v. Rossignol. But rather than

15
16

forthrightly telling the Bergers and the court about their mistake and seeking to amend the Bergers’

17

Infringement Contentions, defendants unsuccessfully sought Rule 56(f) postponement of the

18

summary judgment motion.20
Finally, on March 27, 2006, defendants conceded that the Infringement Contentions were

19
20

defective and moved to amend them. But in presenting that motion, defendants concealed the fact

21

that Seyfarth had prepared the defective claim chart incorporated into the Infringement

22

Contentions. Defendants also filed the Bergers’ opposition to Rossignol’s motion for summary

23

judgment conceding that the Bergers’ Infringement Contentions were defective and making no

24

argument that Rossignol’s binding infringed the ‘530 patent under the defective Infringement

Contentions.21
At the April 14, 2006 oral argument, defendant Slobodin again concealed Seyfarth’s

3

responsibility for the faulty claim chart and indicated that Seyfarth was not involved in the action

4

until after the Infringement Contentions were served.22
On April 25, 2006, the District Court denied the Bergers’ Motion for Leave to Amend

emphasizing that “the Bergers offer no explanation as to why the ‘errors’ were made in the first

7

place, and, in particular, how they could have ‘mistakenly’ omitted any contentions as to the ‘569.”

8

The District court also granted Rossignol’s Motion for Summary Judgment and entered Judgment

9

in favor of Rossignol as to the Bergers’ patent infringement claims.23

10

F. The Federal Circuit Appeal – Defendants’ Ongoing Concealment

11

The Bergers later appealed the District Court’s judgment to the Federal Circuit. During

12

oral argument on January 10, 2007, defendant Slobodin continued to conceal his and Seyfarth’s

13

preparation of the defective claim chart used in the Bergers’ Infringement Contentions. When the

14

Federal Circuit asked Slobodin how the errors in the Infringement Contentions occurred, Slobodin

15

deceptively replied, “the attorney that was handling it before me did that for whatever reason I am

16

not sure.” On January 16, 2007, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s April 25, 2006

17

judgment.24
Each of the defendants represented the Bergers during these events and continued to do so

18
19

at least through the Federal Circuit’s denial of the appeal on January 16, 2007.25

After the April 25, 2006 judgment was entered, defendants began jointly preparing a Rule

3

5

The Bergers’ Rule 60 Motion - Joint Preparation by Allen & Seyfarth

60 motion to vacate the judgment.27
On May 7, 2006, Allen forwarded his draft FRCP Rule 60 motion to the Bergers

4

containing, for the first time, an explanation of how the defendants’ mistake occurred:

6

In 2003, a second claim chart was created by Sayfarth [sic] and
Shaw in Chicago, which chart did include the base plate (item 4), as
part of the lower attachment along with 5b, and 17, in claim one.
….

7
8

The undersigned intended to utilized [sic] the claims chart of
Mr. Suyat in the preliminary infringement contentions, however the
original had not been located, only a copy with inter-lineation
(underlining in the text). Due to the lateness of the disclosures
already, the undersigned despaired of finding the original. In
actually making the disclosure, however, the undersigned mistook
the claims chart from the Sayfarth [sic] Chicago office as a clean
copy of the Suyat chart, not noticing the mistaken identification of
the base plate (item 4) in claim one. The undersigned therefore
erroneously disclosed the wrong claims chart. Instead of using the
chart prepared by the patent’s prosecutor, the chart by a former
associate of Sayfarth [sic] in Chicago was erroneously used.28

14

Defendants then forwarded their draft Rule 60 motion to David Tunno, a trial consultant

15
16

they had been consulting with concerning Berger v. Rossignol. After reviewing the draft, Tunno

17

cautioned defendants that, by explaining their mistake, they were revealing that Slobodin had made

18

“misleading” statements to the court during the April 14, 2006 hearing:

19

There is one aspect of it that strikes me as a being a potential
problem. I believe this will be the first time the court will have
learned of the involvement of Seyfarth Shaw, some 3 years ago (pg.
8, 2nd paragraph). How the Chicago office became involved at that
point is not explained in the brief and my concern is that the court
may interpret that involvement as a contradiction to what Jack told
the court in the April 14, hearing, specifically that he was not
directly or substantially involved until March, ’06. If not a
contradiction to Jack’s claim, it may at least seem that Jack’s claim
was misleading.29

20
21
22
23
24

Allen responded on May 8, 2006:
25
Those are good suggestions. I struggled with whether to
identify Sayfarths [sic] involvement in 2003. I am concerned about

withholding things from the court at this point. I have no problem
inserting more explanation. Anyway I shall consider your thoughts
further today.30

1
2

Defendants ultimately decided to continue to hide Seyfarth’s early involvement from the
3
court. On May 23, 2006, defendants filed a Rule 60(b) motion which made no reference to
4
Seyfarth’s preparation of the faulty claim chart used to prepare the Bergers’ Infringement
5

Contentions.31 Remarkably, the missing explanation was still included in draft motions that were

6
sent to the Bergers on May 15, 2006 and May 18, 2006 (i.e., just 5 days before the motion was
7

filed).32

8
The court denied the Rule 60 motion on July 16, 2006.

The Bergers’ Federal Circuit Appeal - Continued Representation by Allen

10

appeal to the Federal Circuit. During that time, Allen continued to manage the Bergers’ “litigation
12
fund,” consult with Slobodin, and advise the Bergers concerning Berger v. Rossignol during late
13

2006 and early 2007.33

14
According to Allen’s billing records, he spent time in June and August 2006 corresponding
15
and engaging in telephone calls with defendant Slobodin and issued a $11,000 “Trust Check” to
16
Seyfarth from the Bergers’ litigation account to cover “costs and partial payment for time spent on

Allen responded the following day on February 20, 2007 acknowledging that “I [Allen] represent

The Bergers’ Petition for Certiorari - Direct Handling by Allen

10

During those discussions, Allen advised the Bergers that they still had approximately $36,000 left

11

in their litigation fund which could be used to pay him for preparing the Petition. Allen also

12

advised the Bergers that he believed they had “a good shot” at the Petition and that their money

13

would be well-spent.37
The Bergers could not reach an agreement on whether to spend the remainder of their

14
15

litigation fund to pay Allen for the Petition. Allen then offered to handle the matter in exchange

16

for the Bergers’ waiver of any malpractice claims against him concerning a mistake in Berger v.

Rossignol.38 That proposal fell through, but Allen chose to proceed. On April 12, 2007, Allen

The Statute of Limitations Under CCP § 340.6 Was Tolled During Allen’s Ongoing
Representation of The Bergers

10

A.

The Bergers’ Allegations Confirm That Allen’s Representation Was Ongoing

11

Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 340.6 creates a one-year statute of limitations for an “action against

12

an attorney for a wrongful act or omission, other than actual fraud, arising in the performance of

13

professional services” which begins to run “within one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through

14

the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or

15

omission.”
Allen’s Rule 12 motion claims that more than one year passed from the time that the

16
17

Bergers discovered defendants’ malpractice and the September 12, 2007 filing of their complaint.

18

But as Allen concedes, the CCP § 340.6 statute is tolled while the “attorney continues to represent

19

the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission

20

occurred.”43
The Bergers’ complaint plainly alleges that “an attorney-client relationship existed between

21
22

the Bergers and defendants” at all times relevant to the matters alleged44 and “at least through the

23

Federal Circuit’s denial of the appeal on January 16, 2007.”45 Those allegations must be accepted

24

as true for purposes of Allen’s Rule 12 motion and may not be contradicted by matters “outside” of

the complaint.46
Because less than one year passed from January 16, 2007 to September 12, 2007, the

2

Document 35

Bergers allegations reveal no statute of limitations defense under CCP § 340.6.

4

B.

The Declaration of Richard Berger Confirms Allen’s Ongoing Representation

5

Apparently undaunted by the prohibition against “speaking” Rule 12(b)(6) motions, Allen

6

argues that—contrary to the Bergers’ allegations—his representation actually terminated upon

7

entry of the April 25, 2006 judgment because (1) he “was neither attorney of record on the appeal

8

or is admitted to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals”; and (2) his March 9, 2005 retainer letter to

9

the Bergers provided that his representation would terminate “upon the entry of judgment” in

10

Berger v. Rossignol.47 But because those matters are outside of the complaint, they must be

11

excluded by the court.
If, on the other hand, the court chooses not to exclude Allen’s unsupported assertions, his

12
13

motion becomes a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication:

14

If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss
for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not
excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for
summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all
parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material
made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.48

15
16
17

In such an event, the Bergers may present their own evidence in opposition to Allen’s Rule

18
19

56 motion and may further present their own cross-motion for summary judgment:

20

Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment: In addition to
filing an opposition, the opposing party may respond to a motion for
summary judgment by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment
in its favor.49

21
22

Accordingly, if Allen’s additional facts are considered, the Bergers ask for summary

23
24
25
26
27
28

adjudication that Allen has no statute of limitations defense under CCP § 340.6.

As an initial matter, Allen’s motion does not present any actual evidence to support his

1
2

claim that he no longer represented the Bergers as of April 25, 2006. He did not submit a

3

declaration and did not attach a copy of the retainer letter that supposedly supports his claim. He

4

merely asserts unsupported argument in his moving papers. That is not sufficient to support his

5

summary judgment motion or to overcome plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary adjudication.
And the declaration of Richard Berger and attached exhibits confirm that Allen continued

to represent the Bergers long after the April 25, 2006 judgment was entered. Allen directly

8

participated in drafting—and was still counsel of record during—the Rule 60 motion that was filed

9

on May 23, 2006 and denied on July 16, 2006. He coordinated the Federal Circuit appeal with

10

Seyfarth and paid for their time and expenses directly from the Bergers’ litigation account. He

11

advised the Bergers on how to proceed once the Federal Circuit appeal was denied on January 16,

12

2007. He handled the Bergers’ Petition for Certiorari filed on April 12, 2007 and denied on

13

October 1, 2007.
Allen may argue that there was a gap in his representation between the July 16, 2006 denial

14
15

of his Rule 60 motion and the April 12, 2007 filing of the Bergers’ Petition. But that argument is

16

belied by the Berger Declaration and, in particular, Allen’s February 20, 2007 e-mailing

17

acknowledging that “I [Allen] represent you and Brant and have loyally done so over many years.”

18

Moreover, even if there were such a “gap” in representation, less than one year passed between

19

July 16, 2006 and April 12, 2007. So under no set of facts could Allen assert a valid statute of

20

limitations defense under CCP § 340.6.

CCP § 340.6 Does not Apply to The Bergers’ Claim for Actual Fraud
At page 2 of Allen’s brief, he makes the following argument:
Although, the complaint alleges various causes of action,
whether arising from tort or breach of contract, the California Code
of Civil Procedure 340.6 applies to all legal theories arising from
attorney malpractice.
Allen is wrong. CCP § 340.6 expressly excludes claims based on “actual fraud” from its

application. Nothing in the cases cited by Allen suggests otherwise.
So even if Allen were able to assert a defense under CCP § 340.6, that defense would not

The Bergers’ Fraud Claim is not “Uncertain”

3

At pages 4 and 5 of his brief, Allen cursorily argues that the Bergers fraud claim is

4

“uncertain and ambiguous.” But Allen fails to explain exactly what, if anything, is “uncertain” or

5

“ambiguous” about that claim—other than to say that “Defendants Slobodin and Seyfarth Shaw

6

have previously addressed these issues in the demurrer filed in state court on October 12, 2007.”
To the extent that Allen is relying on pleadings filed by other parties in another court, that

7
8

is improper. If Allen wishes to present an argument for the court’s consideration, he must do so in

9

a way that the Bergers can meaningfully and intelligently respond to.
In any event, the Bergers’ fraud allegations are clear, direct, and certain. As the complaint

11

plainly alleges, defendants modified the Suyat claim chart—thereby rendering it defective—and

12

incorporated that defective claim chart into the Bergers’ Infringement Contentions without telling

13

the Bergers. When Rossignol challenged the defective Infringement Contentions on summary

14

judgment, defendants actively concealed their mistake from the Bergers, as well as the court. That

15

concealment persisted through the Rule 60 motion filed by plaintiffs and later through the Federal

16

Circuit appeal. The fact that defendants had committed such a mistake was highly material

17

information, known to defendants, that they had an obligation to disclose to the Bergers and to the

18

court. Had the Bergers known that information, they could have acted on that knowledge by

19

insisting that defendants reveal their mistake to the court or by retaining new counsel to do so. But

20

defendants did not allow the Bergers to do that. Instead, they continued to hide their mistake while

21

permitting the Bergers’ rights against Rossignol to slowly dissolve into nothing.

IV.

“As a practical matter, leave to amend is almost always granted by the court.”50 Rule 15(a)

expressly states that leave to amend “shall be freely given when justice so requires.”
