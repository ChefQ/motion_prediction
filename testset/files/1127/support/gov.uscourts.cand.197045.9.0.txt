alleges various causes of action, whether arising from tort or breach of contract, the California Code

2

of Civil Procedure 340.6 applies to all legal theories arising from attorney malpractice [see:

3

Southland Mechanical Constructors Corporation v. Nixen (1981) 119 Cal. App. 417; Worthington v.

4

Rusconi (1994) 29 Cal. App. 4th 1488]. The complaint herein was originally filed on September 12,

5

2007. On the face of the complaint, however, the description of the alleged malpractice arises from

6

the assertion of allegedly defective infringement contentions. The original defective infringement

7

contentions were apparently written by J. Terry Stratman of Seyfarth and Shaw (“Seyfarth”) on or

8

about December 22, 2003 (see: Paragraph 17 and 25 of the Complaint).

9

The Plaintiffs obtained two patents upon a snowboard binding in 1997. In 1998, Rossignol a

10

French Ski equipment company began marketing its similar binding which plaintiffs claimed

11

infringed upon their patent (complaint paragraphs 9 through 11). The allegedly infringing Rossignol

12

binding was sent to the attorney who prosecuted the original patents of plaintiffs, Reginald Suyat, a

13

partner with the law firm of Fish & Richardson (complaint paragraph 12 and 13). Mr Suyat

14

prepared a “claims chart” identifying the components of the infringing device to the claims of the

15

patent. This claims chart, setting forth the “infringement contentions” of the plaintiffs was sent

16

together with the Rossignol binding to defendant, Seyfarth, for consideration by Jack Slobodin at

17

the Seyfarth law firm. According to paragraph 16 of the complaint, the initial prejudice caused to

18

defendants was the failure to return the Rossignol binding “prejudicing plaintiffs’ ability to later

19

repeat Suyat’s work.” On or about December 22, 2003, Terry Stratman of Seyfarth reviewed Suyat’s

20

claims chart and prepared his own claims chart and a memorandum questioning the validity of the

21

“569 patent (paragraphs 17 and 25). This claims chart is alleged to be defective in its identification

22

of component “4" as part of the “lower attachment” on the Rossignol binding (paragraph 27). It was

23

this “defective” claims chart that led to the “defective” infringement contentions upon which

24

plaintiffs’ base this case. The alleged defective infringement contentions were used in the action that

25

was not filed against Rossignol until 2005, seven years after Rossignol began allegedly infringing

26

upon the plaintiffs’ patents, and two years after the “defective infringement” contentions were

27

created.

The statute on malpractice begins to run when a client first suffers damage or prejudice.

2

A client suffers damage when he is compelled, as result of the attorney’s error, to
‘incur and pay attorney’s fees and legal costs and expenditures.’ [Southland
Mechanical Constructors Corporation v. Nixen (Supra) citing Budds v. Nixen 6
Cal. 3rd 195, 201](1)

3
4

As set forth in the complaint, the genesis of the alleged malpractice was the erroneous
5
infringement contentions and memorandum created by Terry Stratman which ultimately led to the
6
failure to literally assert infringement against Rossignol and the failure to asset the 569' patent.
7
Berger knew or had reason to know that he has suffered prejudice from the actions of Seyfarth at that
8
time, however, as Seyfarth failed, following specific request, to return the Rossignol binding
9
“prejudicing plaintiffs’ ability to later repeat Suyat’s work.” The failure to return the binding by
10
inference include a failure to return the “Suyat claims chart”, which reflected the correct
11
infringement contentions. Had the chart been returned in 2003, there would have been no prejudice
12
to plaintiffs since plaintiffs would not have needed to duplicate Suyat’s work. This inference is
13
confirmed further in paragraph 24, where the request for a “claims chart” is made both to Mr. Suyat
14
as well as Mr. Slobodin. If Suyat had his claims chart in 2005, he would have given it to the
15
defendant Allen. Thus the phase on paragraph 16, “prejudicing plaintiffs’ ability to later repeat
16
Suyat’s work,” reveals that plaintiffs were put on notice in 2003, that they had been prejudiced by the
17
actions of the Seyfarth firm. They had either a defective claims chart in 2003, drafted by Mr.
18
Stratman, or they had none, and no binding to re-create one. In either case, they knew, or had reason
19
to know that there was a problem, that they were prejudiced by the need to expend more attorneys
20
fees to correct the error, and sat on their claim.
21
The failure of the plaintiffs to address the errors perpetrated in 2003, led to the very problem
22
of which they complain in 2006, i.e. the erroneous use of the “Stratman Claims Chart” in the
23
preliminary infringement contentions. Had plaintiffs addressed the problem in 2003, as required
24
under the statute, they would have created a duplicate “Suyat Claims Chart”, or recovered the
25
original, and avoided the entire problem with the disclosure in 2006. Thus the claim is barred by the
26
27
28

1. Although Southland Mechanical Constructor Corporation v. Nixen was disapproved on other grounds in
Laird v. Blacker 2 Cal. 4 th 606 (1992) the principles for which it is cited herein remain. In fact, Laird v. Blacker restrict
the commencement of the statute to the initial adverse ruling indicating it is not tolled by the taking of an appeal.

statute of limitations, based upon the facts recited in the face of the complaint.

2

As a second basis for the assertion of the statute of limitations, the judgment complained of

3

was entered on April 25, 2006. Although, the judgment was appealed, such appeal does not toll the

4

statute (see: Laird v. Blacker (1992) 2 Cal. 4th 606, 617). Although the statute may be tolled while

5

representation continues on the same matter the complaint does not allege that defendant Allen

6

represented plaintiffs on the appeal. In fact, defendants will have a difficult time truthfully alleging

7

such representation since plaintiff Allen was neither attorney of record on the appeal nor is admitted

8

to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. To the contrary, the contract memorializing the retention of

9

defendant Allen on March 9, 2005, states,

10
11

“representation of client by attorney shall in any event terminate upon the entry of
judgment, or the filing of a judgment, or the filing of dismissal in the litigation
to which this agreement applies.”

12

Although these latter facts are not properly taken from the face of the complaint, the face of

13

the complaint indicates itself that the representation on appeal was conducted by Jack Slobodin and

14

Seyfarth, not defendant Allen.

15

Accordingly, the initial error of which plaintiffs complain originally occurred in 2003.

16

According to plaintiffs, they were prejudiced by the requirement of expending attorney fees to

17

remedy that error and were aware of such, or reasonably should have been aware of such, in 2003.

18

The complaint was not filed until four years later. The judgment in the complaint was entered in

19

April of 2006, but the complaint was not filed until a year and half later notwithstanding the

20

termination of representation by defendant Allen. Based upon the face of the complaint, it appears

21

that the claims against all the defendants are barred by the statute of limitations and are certainly

22

barred specifically regarding this moving defendant.

23

(In Other Respects the Complaint Is Uncertain and Ambiguous and Therefore Fails to State a Cause
of Action)

24
Notwithstanding the notice pleading requirements of Federal Court, plaintiffs are required to
25
plead a clear action for breach of contract. They are likewise required to plead an actual claim for
26
fraud. Defendants Slobodin and Seyfarth have previously addressed these issues in the demurrer
27
filed in state court on October 12, 2007. The complaint is vague as to the formation of the

attorney/client relationship which must be plead [see: Gulf Insurance Company v. Berger, Kahn,

2

Shafton, Moss, Figler, Simon & Gladstone (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 114, 126. The elements of a fraud

3

cause of action are specific and require specific pleading [see: Consumer Cause Inc. v. Arkopharma,

4

Inc. (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 824, 827; Barbara A. v. John G. (1983) 145 Cal. App. 3rd 369, 376;

5

Robinson Helicopter Company Inc. v. Dana Corporation (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 979, 990]. Similar

6

requirements apply to negligent misrepresentation and breech of fiduciary duty. Alleged

7

misrepresentation to the “Court” cannot be claimed by the plaintiffs, even if they occurred. No duty

8

is alleged against this moving defendant. Notwithstanding the liberal construction applied to federal

9

pleadings, such claims must still be pled with specificity showing an actionable claim against the

10
11
12
13
14

defendants.
despite this generous standard, we repeatedly have cautioned that FRCP 12(b)(6) is
not entirely a toothless tiger...the threshold for stating a claim may be low, but it is
real. The complaint must therefore set forth factual allegations, either direct or
inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some
actionable legal theory [see: Podiatrist Association v. La Cruz Azul de P.R. Inc. (1st
Circuit 2003) 332 Fed. 3rd 6, 19; Begala v. PNC Bank (6th Cir. 2000) 214 Fed. 3rd 776,
779)

15

CONCLUSION

16

It is evident that plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the statute limitations as to this moving

17

defendant. Further the claim is vague and uncertain and fails to properly plead the causes of action it

18

attempts to set forth. Irrespective of the form of the cause of action, however, C.C.P. Section 340.6

19

applies and the complaint should be dismissed without leave to amend.
