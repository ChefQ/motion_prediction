Counsel for Respondent the Honorable Cynthia Lummis,
U.S. Representative for Wyoming
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF WYOMING

JACQUELINE S. JUDD,
Petitioner,
v.

Case No. 2:15-cv-00064-SWS

CYNTHIA LUMMIS,
U.S. Representative for Wyoming,
Respondent.
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO SET HEARING AND
REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS
Respondent the Honorable Cynthia Lummis, U.S. Representative for Wyoming, hereby
responds to Petitioner Jacqueline S. Judd’s Motion to Set Hearing (June 18, 2015) (ECF No. 14)
(“Hearing Motion”), which Congresswoman Lummis construes as Ms. Judd’s opposition to the
Congresswoman’s Motion to Dismiss (June 8, 2015) (ECF No. 12) (“Motion to Dismiss”). See
Hr’g Mot. at 1 (seeking a hearing “rather than dismissal”). 1
1

Were the Court to construe the Hearing Motion as simply a request for oral argument on the
Petition for Writ of Mandamus, Declaratory Judgment, and Permanent Injunction (Mar. 20,
2015) (ECF No. 2) (“Petition”) and the Motion to Dismiss, Congresswoman Lummis maintains

Case 2:15-cv-00064-SWS Document 15 Filed 06/23/15 Page 2 of 7

The Hearing Motion wholly fails to respond to Congresswoman Lummis’s many
arguments in favor of dismissal. On this basis alone, the Court should grant the Motion to
Dismiss. See, e.g., Poole v. Sw. Bell Tel. L.P., 86 F. App’x 372, 374 (10th Cir. 2003) (deeming
claim “abandoned” where plaintiff “did not oppose the defendants’ argument” in support of
motion to dismiss); Hutton v. Woodall, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, No. 13-cv-1338, 2014 WL 4961458,
at *4 (D. Colo. Oct. 3, 2014) (similar); Stevens v. Water Dist. One of Johnson Cnty., 561 F.
Supp. 2d 1224, 1229 n.1 (D. Kan. 2008) (similar).
But the Hearing Motion is more than merely unresponsive. As explained below, the
Hearing Motion fully reaffirms the many fatal jurisdictional and pleading defects plaguing the
Petition, as Congresswoman Lummis laid out in detail in the memorandum of points and
authorities filed in support of the Motion to Dismiss. See generally Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of
Mot. to Dismiss of Resp’t Hon. Cynthia Lummis (June 8, 2015) (ECF No. 13) (“Mem. in
Supp.”).
1. Speech or Debate Clause Immunity. The Hearing Motion makes clear that Ms. Judd
is challenging Congresswoman Lummis’s alleged failure to “carry[] out the impeachment
process.” Hr’g Mot. at 2; see also, e.g., id. at 3 (alleging that Congresswoman Lummis
“disregard[ed] . . . her oath of her office to commence/file the impeachment process”). The
Hearing Motion also, for the first time, 2 takes issue with the Congresswoman’s alleged failure to
“obtain[] all necessary documentation, audio, video, and media and witnesses of proof needed to
that neither the Petition nor the Motion to Dismiss requires oral argument. See Local Civil Rule
7.1(a) (“Motions may be decided on the submissions unless oral argument, at the Court’s
discretion, is ordered.”).
2

Ms. Judd cannot properly use her opposition to the Motion to Dismiss as a means to
supplement the allegations in the Petition. See Sudduth v. Citimortgage, --- F. Supp. 3d ----,
No. 14-cv-00874, 2015 WL 661766, at *4 n.2 (D. Colo. Jan. 28, 2015) (citing, among other
cases, Jojola v. Chavez, 55 F.3d 488, 494 (10th Cir. 1995)).

impeach and file criminal charges against [the President],” i.e., her alleged failure to undertake a
congressional investigation. Id. For the reasons previously stated, however, the Speech or
Debate Clause absolutely immunizes Congresswoman Lummis from such claims. See Mem. in
Supp. at 7-12.
2. Political Question Doctrine. By doubling down on her challenge to Congresswoman
Lummis’s alleged failure to pursue the President’s impeachment, see, e.g., Hr’g Mot. at 2-3,
Ms. Judd again runs headlong into the political question doctrine, see Mem. in Supp. at 13-14.
3. Standing. The Hearing Motion underscores, emphatically, that the Petition seeks to
vindicate only generalized harms allegedly suffered by “ALL the people” – not a concrete,
particularized injury suffered personally by Ms. Judd. Hr’g Mot. at 2. 3 The Hearing Motion
likewise makes clear that the President “and his administration” allegedly caused these injuries,
id. at 2, 4 which injuries therefore are not fairly traceable to Congresswoman Lummis and thus
cannot be redressed in an action brought solely against the Congresswoman. Consequently, for
3

See also, e.g., Hr’g Mot. at 1 (seeking “[h]earing rather than dismissal for the sake of the
people”); id. (asserting that Ms. Judd “is a representative for the people of the state of
Wyoming”); id. at 2 (alleging that “the American people” are “in vital and grave danger”); id.
(alleging that “not ONE individual citizen of this United States of America; yet ALL the people
who reside in the state of Wyoming and this country” are “unsafe and unsecure now and in the
future”); id. at 3 (alleging that President’s actions “threaten[] the very lives, safety, freedoms,
values, liberties of the People of the United States of America” and “continually harm[] all
Americans”).
4

See also, e.g., Hr’g Mot. at 1 (President’s “provocations, miss leading [sic], false, and
fraudulent acts, speeches, and implantation of all illegal and unconstitutional proceedings and
actions”); id. (President is “domestic terrorist”); id. at 2 (“Americans[’] liberties and freedoms
are being strangled and depleted by [the President] and his administration, by implementing and
carrying out illegal and unconstitutional laws, bylaws, regulations, acts, and decrees”); id.
(President “has been engaging in the commission of crimes against the people and our country”);
id. (President “has supplied arms, funds, aids and abets the enemies of the United States of
America; passed illegal laws, illegal immigration laws, and numerous other unconstitutional and
illegal acts against the constitution of the United States of America”); id. (President’s “illegal
actions, scams, and speeches . . . while in office”); id. at 3 (President’s “blatant disregard for the
constitution of the United States” amounting to “impeachable and criminal offenses”).

the reasons previously stated, Ms. Judd has not established, and cannot establish, Article III
standing. See Mem. in Supp. at 15-17.
4. Sovereign Immunity. Rather than identify an express, statutory waiver of sovereign
immunity that would permit this action to proceed, see Mem. in Supp. at 19-20, the Hearing
Motion simply appeals to equity “for the sake of the people,” Hr’g Mot. at 1. Such an appeal is
insufficient to subject a federal official to civil suit in her official capacity.
5. Failure to State a Claim. The Hearing Motion confirms that Ms. Judd improperly
seeks Congresswoman Lummis’s removal from office. See, e.g., Hr’g Mot. at 1 (demanding that
Congresswoman Lummis “show cause to the people why she should remain the representative
for the people of the state of Wyoming”). The Hearing Motion likewise relies on patently
inapplicable provisions of Wyoming’s state constitution as authority for judicial removal of a
Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. See id. at 3. For the reasons previously stated,
only the U.S. House of Representatives has the power to expel its members. See Mem. in Supp.
at 18, 24. 5
The Hearing Motion reaffirms Ms. Judd’s complaint that Congresswoman Lummis
“ignored and refused the pleads [sic] and demands of the people of her state . . . to
commence/file the impeachment process,” Hr’g Mot. at 3, notwithstanding that a constituent’s

Moreover, even assuming that Wyoming’s state constitution possibly could apply here, the
Court still would lack the authority to command Congresswoman Lummis’s removal from
office. Like Article I, section 5, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, Article III, section 12 of
Wyoming’s state constitution vests the Wyoming legislature with the exclusive power to
discipline its members, including through expulsion “with the concurrence of two-thirds.”
Wyoming’s state constitution similarly vests the Wyoming House of Representatives – not
private litigants and courts – with “the sole power of impeachment.” Wyo. Const. art. III, § 17;
contra Hr’g Mot. at 3 (contending that “Article III Section 16 and 18 of the Wyoming
Constitution . . . grants the people the right to impeach and or file criminal charges on members
of the legislators [sic]”).

4

Case 2:15-cv-00064-SWS Document 15 Filed 06/23/15 Page 5 of 7

mere dissatisfaction with her Congresswoman is not a cognizable cause of action, see Mem. in
Supp. at 22 & n.19.
Finally, to the extent that the Hearing Motion – also, for the first time, see supra note 2 –
challenges Congresswoman Lummis’s failure to “fil[e] criminal charges” against the President,
Hr’g Mot. at 2, Ms. Judd has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted: The
Supreme Court has explained that “the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute
discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693
(1974); accord Smith v. Krieger, 389 F. App’x 789, 798 (10th Cir. 2010) (“The long-standing
view of the Supreme Court is that such power [to prosecute crimes in the name of the United
States] is exclusive [to the Executive Branch].”).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons stated in the Memorandum in Support, the
Court must dismiss the Petition, with prejudice.
