Jacqueline S Judd
CASE NO. 2:15-cv00064-SWS

Petitioner

U.S. House of Representative
Cynthia Lummis

Opposition to Defendant's

Respondent

Motion to Dismiss

Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd hereby submits its opposition to Defendant, House of Representative Cynthia
Lummis' Motion to Dismiss the Complaint with Prejudice.

Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd's complaint not

only meets but exceeds the standards governing the form of a complaint contemplated by Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 8(a), whereas this Court has jurisdiction in this matter, where the Complaint filed
sufficiently alleges plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd's harm and damages. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to
dismiss should be denied.

Defendant, House of Representative Cynthia Lummis' move to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for Failure

to file within 14 days of defendant's response is miss construed and false with the timing of mail of
response, originating from Maryland, and being sent to the Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd, taking no less

than 5/8 days to reach Plaintiff, for Plaintiff to respond to Defendant. Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd has
responded as such within the timely manner allotted of the 14 days following receipt of Defendants
rebuttals and oppositions. Plaintiff has retained the original envelopes of origin and dates, and stapled to

given fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it rests. Where in actuality, the
relief/response sought will be obtained through a court of law and its evidence.
Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd has specifically identified the actions or lack thereof, of Defendant, House of

Representative Cynthia Lummis, and how those actions, lack thereof are wrongful toward/against, and the
people of Wyoming, of the United States of America. Finally the Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd clearly
states on fair notice the charges in question from the Writ of Mandamus, and to the responses of the
violations and reasons for hearing.
Summary

In Summary, the Plaintiff, Jacqueline S Judd fully complies with the pleading requirements of Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) and provides Defendant House of Representative Cynthia Lummis fair

notice of the charges against her and the grounds thereof Discovery and argument will add further detail
later of facts in support of actual, realistic, and honest evidence. Therefore, the Plaintiff Jacqueline S
Judd respectfully requests that the Court deny Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Defendant, House of
Representative Cynthia Lummis with Prejudice; and grant the motion for hearing as requested from the
onset of the Petition of Writ of Mandamus.
