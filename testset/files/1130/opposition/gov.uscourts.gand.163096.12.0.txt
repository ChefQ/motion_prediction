PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS'
MOTION TO DISQUALIFY BUSCH, SLIPAKOFF & SCHUH, LLP

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Marcelino Solis, ("Plaintiff') by and through his
undersigned counsel and files this his Response in Opposition to the Motion to
Disqualify Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh, LLP ("BSS") filed by Defendants The `Taco

Maker, Inc. ("TMI"), Fransglobal Corporation ("FG") and Carlos Budet (" Budet")

(collectively as "Defendants") showing this Court that Defendants' Motion to
Disqualify ("Motion") is without merit and must be denied in its entirety.
BACKGROUND FACTS

In or about March, April and July 2008, Plaintiff was approached in Atlanta,
Georgia concerning an investment opportunity whereby Plaintiff would invest in
TMI/FG and thereby acquire an equity stake in TMI ("Equity Investment"). In
addition, through this Equity Investment, Plaintiff's tortilla manufacturing
company was assured of future lucrative food production contracts from TMI2
During the negotiations of the Equity Investment, Plaintiff was invited to Puerto
Rico to attend a meeting with principals of TMI.' Plaintiff was accompanied on
this trip with his counsel, Mr. Shane Stogner, ("Stogner").' After that trip, Stogner,
at the behest of Plaintiff, drafted a Stock Purchase Agreement ("SPA") whereby
Plaintiff would purchase certain shares in TMI from Miguel Lausell (the "Lausell
Buyout")." During the onset of negotiations, Stogner received an email from Mr.

Jose Aponte Carro, identifying himself as the lawyer for TMI.0x00B0

In July 2008, Plaintiff informed Defendants that any investment would also
need to include a corporate restructuring of FG/TML, along with new bank
financing; Plaintiff demanded that Stogner be involved in this restructuring to
ensure it was done properly.' Due to this request, Stogner sent a draft engagement
letter ('Letter") to Defendants.(R)

On or about July 11, 2008, Plaintiff, through Stogner, informed Defendants
he was not interested in pursuing the proposed Lausell Buyout and the SPA was
never agreed to by the parties." Soon thereafter, Budet approached Plaintiff again
and assured Plaintiff that if he wired $125,000.00 to Puerto Rico that he would still
be given an equity stake in FG/TMI and would still receive the lucrative food
production contracts.'0x00B0 Based on these assurances by Budet, Plaintiff wired said
sum.!! Plaintiff was never given an equity stake in FG or TMI, and has never been
given any food production contracts despite his investment."

After this Court denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss based on lack of
personal jurisdiction (DE # 7), Defendants now allege that Stogner represented

Defendants and that it is improper for BSS to bring suit against TML, FG and

Budet.'? However, no express or implied attorney-client relationship ever existed
between Stogner and any of the Defendants.
STANDARD FOR DISQUALIFICATION

A party moving to disqualify counsel for the opposing party faces a high
burden and Courts should be very careful in ordering disqualification." A party
seeking disqualification must first prove that an attorney client representation
actually existed between its client and opposing counsel.'> A party may prove the
existence of an attorney-client relationship with direct evidence by showing that
the person asserting the relationship paid the attorney fees, that party was not
represented by his own counsel, and that party informed the attorney that he was
relying on him for legal advice.'(R)

STOGNER'S ROLE

On or about June 6, 2008, (at his previous firm of Taylor, Busch, Slipakoff

& Duma, LLP), Stogner sent a Letter Of Intent to Mr. Thomas Torres as a Seller of

stock in TMI effectuate the Equity Investment.'" In this letter Stogner sets forth

that he is acting "[a]s attorney for a party ("the Buyer"). Stogner concludes his
letter by stating that he is "prepared to meet with representatives of the Seller and
its advisors to discuss further the terms of our proposal and to answer any
questions you may have about the Buyer or our proposal."'" Negotiations with
Torres did not lead to an agreement.

Thereafter, in connection with the next investment proposal, the Lausell
Buyout, Stogner drafted a proposed SPA." The SPA specifically proposed that
each party to the Lausell Buyout would shoulder their own costs, including that of
counsel."! However, the Lausell Buyout was never consummated, as Plaintiff
declined to invest via the SPA."

Soon thereafter, Stogner sent the proposed Letter to the attention of
Defendant Budet, which was never signed."? The Letter set forth a proposal for
legal services and stated very clearly that a conflict would exist between Stogner's
representation of TMI as he was currently representing "Marcelino Solis, a

potential shareholder in the company". At all times, through all negotiations

Defendants, were represented by their counsel, Jose Aponte Carro ("Carro")."? Mr.
Carro requested changes to the proposed SPA."
THE LAUSELL BUYOUT AND SPA WERE NEVER CONSUMMATED

Surprisingly, Defendants point to an unexecuted SPA which was never
consummated and involved a non-party to this case, to somehow allege that an
attorney-client relationship existed with Stogner. During the drafting of the
proposed SPA, Stogner negotiated the terms with Carro, who represented the
Defendants as their outside counsel and eventually their in house counsel."'
Stogner sent numerous emails and correspondence which set forth a negotiation of
the terms of the SPA."*

As shown by the document itself, the necessary terms of the Stock Purchase
are not present, (the price, the number of shares transferred, the date of the
agreement). Defendants' mysteriously point to an unexecuted arms-length

negotiated document which was never signed in an effort to justify their present

Motion. However, at all times pertinent to the Lausell Buyout and thereafter,

Stogner represented only Plaintiff and negotiated with Carro, counsel for

Defendants.

THE LETTER WAS NEVER EXECUTED AND
DISCLOSED A POTENTIAL CONFLICT

Defendants aver that Stogner's unsigned Letter is also evidence that an
attorney-client relationship existed."" However, the Letter was never signed by
Stogner or anyone at his firm.*' Nor was the Letter signed by anyone on behalf of
the Defendants as required.*' The Letter states that Stogner will only be employed
to work on the "possible recapitalization or refinancing of the company, corporate
governance as well as any other general matters as we may otherwise mutually
agree." The Letter was sent because Plaintiff demanded that as part of the
transaction that Stogner would be need to be involved in the corporate
restructuring and refinancing of FG/TMI."

Interestingly, the Letter specfically discloses and informs FG/TMI that a

potential conflict would occur given Stogner's current representation of

"Marcelino Solis a potential investor in the company".*" Stogner's Letter
concludes with the following paragraph:
"Again, thank you for the opportunity to represent you pursuant to the
terms of this engagement. Ifthe terms as stated herein are
satisfactory, please sign, date and complete the requested information
where indicated below and return this engagement letter to me,
keeping a copy for your files.""0x00B0
It is clear from the record that the Letter was never agreed to by either party, as the
copy attached to Defendants' Answer is unsigned by either Stogner or any of the
Defendants and cannot serve as a basis for an assertion of an attorney-client

relationship.*0x00B0

DEFENDANTS NEVER TOOK STEPS TO CREATE AN IMPLIED
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH STOGNER

 

Since no documetary evidence exists to establish an attorney-client
relationship, Defendants would necessarily have to rely on the proposition that an
implied attorney-client relationship arose between themselves and Stogner.
However, according to Georgia law, an implied attorney-client relationship cannot

occur where the person asserting the relationship never paid the attorney any fees,

was represented by his own counsel, and never informed the attorney that he was
relying on him for legal advice.' Defendants cannot meet any of these criteria,

1, Neither Defendants, nor Stogner, ever signed the Letter.* Therefore,
neither party agreed to the terms of the Letter. Defendants never
forwarded the $1,000 retainer, nor did Stogner ever receive an hourly
fee from Defendants.*"

2. Defendants were represented by their own counsel at all times
pertinent hereto."" Defendant Carro was the outside counsel for both
TMI/FG and then was appointed the COO and the CLO of FG/TMI.""

3. Defendants also never informed Stogner that they were seeking his
advice or relying upon his advice as an attorney."

All of Stogner's communications with the Defendants were done as arms-
length negotiations concerning the terms of the SPA or in order to help Plaintiff

complete a wire transfer of the investment monies." Stogner received no

information in negotiating the Equity Investment and or Lausell Buyout which
would be confidential or detrimental to the Defendants in this action.

Defendants in this case cannot meet any of the three criteria set forth in In re.
Infocure Securities Litigation, therefore their Motion must be dismissed in its
entirety.

STOGNER IS NOT A NECESSARY WITNESS

Defendants alleged that Stogner and BSS should be disqualified from this
action because Stogner is a necessary witness and cannot also serve as an advocate
in this action.' However, as demonstrated above, Defendants never had an
express or implied attorney-client relationship with Stogner. To the extent that
Defendants plan on calling Stogner to testify in this action, that need is outweighed
by Plaintiff's right to choose his counsel of choice." Regardless, Stogner is not a
necessary witness in this action.

In order to disqualify an attorney based on his role as a necessary witness,
the moving party must demonstrate that Stogner's knowledge is relevant to the
disputed, material questions of fact and that there is no other evidence available to

prove those facts.' The Clough court also cited the case of Chapman Engineers v.
