FRANSGLOBAL CORPORATION
AND CARLOS BUDET,

Counterclaimants,
v.
BUSCH, SLIPAKOFF, & SCHUH,
LLP AND SHANE STOGNER, ESQ.
Third-Party Defendants.

THE TACO MAKER, INC.'S, FRANSGLOBAL CORPORATION'S
AND CARLOS BUDET'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY BUSCH,
SLIPAKOFF, & SCHUH, LLP AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN
SUPPORT
The Taco Maker, Inc., (“Taco Maker”), FransGlobal Corporation
(“FransGlobal”), and Carlos Budet (“Budet”) (collectively referred to
herein as “Third-Party Plaintiffs”) hereby file, by and through counsel of
record, their Motion to Disqualify the law firm of Taylor, Busch, Slipakoff,
& Duma, LLP, N.K.A. Busch, Slipakoff, & Schuh, LLP (“Busch

Case 1:09-cv-03293-RWS Document 9 Filed 07/14/10 Page 2 of 11

Slipakoff”) as counsel for Plaintiff, Marcelino Solis (“Solis”). Third-Party
Plaintiffs move to disqualify Busch Slipakoff from representing the Plaintiff
as, under the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct, (i) representation by
the law firm would involve a conflict of interest with a former client, (ii)
such representation would jeopardize the confidentiality of information
previously provided to the law firm, and (iii) there will be an inevitable
conflict of interest in the law firm, or its members, acting as both an
advocate and a witness.
First, while the Third-Party Plaintiffs acknowledge the Court has an
interest in respecting a litigant’s choice in selecting counsel, the Court also
has a duty to protect previous clients from potential conflicts that may arise.
Rule 1.9 states that “a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a
matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a
substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially
adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents
after consultation.” Ga. R. Prof. Conduct 1.9(a).1 Comments to the rule

1

Humphrey v. State, 244 Ga.App. 808, 537 S.E.2d 95 (Ga.App. 2000)(A lawyer is required to decline
successive representation where the second matter is "substantially related" to the lawyer's
representation of the former client as an irrebutable presumption arises that confidences were disclosed
to the attorney bearing upon the subject matter of the representation. Further, a party seeking
disqualification need not demonstrate which confidences were revealed or even that harm resulted, but
rather only a substantial relationship between the two cases). See also Dodson v. Floyd, 529 F.Supp. 1056,
1060‐61 (N.D.Ga. 1981)(the relevant test for disqualification is well settled and is measured by
representations which are "substantially related" and that since a lawyer should preserve the

Case 1:09-cv-03293-RWS Document 9 Filed 07/14/10 Page 3 of 11

further explain that “the underlying question is whether the lawyer was so
involved in the matter that the subsequent representation can be justly
regarded as a changing of sides in the matter in question.” Ga. R. Prof.
Conduct 1.9, Comment 2. Where such conflict arises and a lawyer is
disqualified from representation, which is currently associated with the firm,
such disqualification is also imputed to the firm; subject only to waiver by
the client. Ga. R. Prof. Conduct 1.10.
Second, Rule 1.6 provides "[a] lawyer shall maintain in confidence all
information gained in the professional relationship with a client, including
information which the client has requested to be held inviolate or the
disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would likely be detrimental to
the client, unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures
that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, or are
required by these rules or other law, or by order of the Court." Ga. R. Prof.
Conduct 1.6.2

confidences, a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety; doubts of which should be
resolved in favor of disqualification).
2

Paul v. Smith, Gambrell, & Russell, 267 Ga. App. 107, 599, S.E.2d 206, 209 (Ga.App. 2004)(where a
contract of employment was consummated with an attorney and the subsequent litigation involves
substantially the same matter, the court did not and held it should not investigate as to the nature of the
confidential information obtained during the course of representation as such disclosure would first
require the client's consent).

Third, combining the roles as an advocate and a witness presents
prejudice; prejudice which may affect a party's rights in litigation. Rule 3.7
of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct provides that a lawyer shall
not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary
witness except where (i) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue, (ii)
the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the
case, or (iii) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship
on the client. Comment 4 to Rule 3.7 further provides that the evaluation of
"substantial hardship" requires a balancing test and the rule provides that
such test is determined on (i) whether the opposing party is likely to suffer
prejudice depends upon the nature of the case, (ii) the importance and
probable tenor of the lawyer's testimony, and (iii) the probability that the
lawyer's testimony will conflict with that of the other witnesses.
Busch Slipakoff’s previous engagements with Taco Maker should
disqualify the firm from further representation for the reasons stated
hereunder:
1.

On or about July 10, 2008, Busch Slipakoff was engaged to

represent Taco Maker in connection with "the possible recapitalization or
refinancing of the company, corporate governance as well as any other

4

Case 1:09-cv-03293-RWS Document 9 Filed 07/14/10 Page 5 of 11

general matters as we may otherwise mutually agree". See Exhibit "C" to the
Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiff's Complaint, [D.E. 8-4].
2.

Busch Slipakoff's engagement with Taco Maker occurred at the

same time as the funds transferred between parties to the litigation and the
dispute arises as to the terms of that monetary transfer.
3.

Mr. Stogner, as a legal representative to Taco Maker and an

agent of Busch Slipakoff, owed both contractual and professional duties to
the company, including that of undivided loyalty and confidentiality. Such
duties were breached when, after entering into a dual representation with
both Solis and Taco Maker for the purpose of funding the Lausell
transaction, Busch Slipakoff, without any authorization from Taco Maker,
took an adverse position against Taco Maker and initiated the present
litigation.
4.

The nature of the present case relates to those corporate funding

agreements and/or what Plaintiff contends is an ancillary deal that was
executed after the Lausell transaction fell through. See Plaintiff's Response
Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 2, [D.E. 4]. As
such, Busch Slipakoff is engaged by Mr. Solis as, legal counsel, to recover
funds advanced from the same transaction, or set of transactions, which the
law firm dually represented the parties.
5

Case 1:09-cv-03293-RWS Document 9 Filed 07/14/10 Page 6 of 11

5.

Busch Slipakoff has not sought to consult with Taco Maker for

consent in representing Mr. Solis; as would be required in order to act as
counsel for a subsequent client involved in the same or substantially related
matter.
6.

Further, as Shane Stogner, Esq. would be clearly disqualified

from representation of either party to this transaction, the disqualification is
imputed to his law firm in the same or substantially related matter, unless the
client consents.3
7.

In addition to the claims brought forth between Plaintiff and

Defendants, Third-Party Plaintiffs have brought a claim for malpractice
against Busch Slipakoff for its negligence in the dual representation of the
parties and attribute any confusion as to the terms of that transfer to either
negligence, by wire-transferring funds prior to the execution of a written
agreement, or knowing misrepresentations to circumvent the obligations set
forth in the July 10, 2008 Stock Purchase Agreement. See Third-Party
Plaintiffs' Answer and Affirmative Defenses, [D.E. 8]. As such, not only will
Busch Slipakoff, or agents thereof, be required to testify in its/their own

3

Amoco Chemicals Corp. v. MacArthur, 568 F.Supp. 42 (N.D.Ga. 1983)(granting motion for disqualification
as to the entire firm for lawyer's disqualification; noting that the risk of information sharing among two
attorneys, presently affiliated, warrants disqualification and that the "Chinese Wall" procedures for
former government lawyers are inapplicable in a private sector context).

Case 1:09-cv-03293-RWS Document 9 Filed 07/14/10 Page 7 of 11

defense, and against the interests of its former client, Taco Maker, but also
advance one of their current members, Mr. Shane Stogner, as a material
witness in the terms of the transfer; raising concerns of potentially even two
or more witnesses from Busch Slipakoff testifying.4
8.

The risk that Taco Maker, and the other Third-Party Plaintiffs,

will suffer prejudice is high due to the importance of Shane Stogner's
testimony and such testimony may in fact even be determinative on the
outcome of the litigation; testimony which will likely conflict with other
parties and witnesses in the case.
9.

Busch Slipakoff was aware of the conflict of interest at the time

of filing the present lawsuit, or should have been aware after verification
with Mr. Stogner, Plaintiff's son-in-law, and accordingly, such risk of
disqualification was foreseeable.5
10.

Disqualification will not work as a substantial hardship on

Plaintiff Solis. At this early stage of the litigation, Plaintiff can, with

4

If a lawyer who is a member of the firm may not act as both advocate and witness on behalf of the client
by reason of conflict of interest, Rule 1.10: imputed disqualification disqualifies the firm also. Ga. R. Prof.
Cond. 3.7, Comment 4.
5

It is relevant that one or both parties could reasonably foresee that the lawyer would probably be a
witness. Ga. R. Prof. Cond. 3.7, Comment 4.

7

Case 1:09-cv-03293-RWS Document 9 Filed 07/14/10 Page 8 of 11

minimal additional expense and delay, obtain numerous other counsel of his
choice.
Accordingly, Busch Slipakoff’s previous associations with Taco
Maker should now preclude representation on behalf of Mr. Solis and
disqualify the law firm in the current matter as such presents irreparable
injury to the Third-Party Plaintiffs and raises serious concerns of
impropriety. Busch Slipakoff, having been privy to confidential
information, including that information obtained by, among other meetings,
the attendance of Mr. Shane Stogner at a Taco Maker shareholders' meeting
in 2008, has essentially elected sides in the contested transaction(s); which
continued representation for the Plaintiff would clearly call into question the
fair and efficient administration of justice.

WHEREFORE, Third-Party Plaintiffs pray that the Court issue an
immediate order that Busch Slipakoff be disqualified from representation of
either party to this transaction and further in any matters related to corporate
funding for Taco Maker, its shareholders, or such other matters as may
otherwise serve as a breach of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct
and/or jeopardize the confidential information received during the course of
the Taco Maker representation.
