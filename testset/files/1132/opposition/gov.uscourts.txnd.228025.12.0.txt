PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO
DISMISS COMPLAINT

 

TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Andrew J. Gonzalez, who hereby submits his Response in

Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint and states as follows:

[. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. Plaintiffis Andrew J. Gonzalez; Defendants are MIDLAND FUNDING, L.L.C., and
MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, INC (collectively "Defendants").

2. Plaintiff sued Defendants for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") 15
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681 et. seq. and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the "FDCPA") 15
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692 et. seq.

3. In February 2012, Plaintiff noticed that Defendants had placed a derogatory account in
his Transunion, Experian, and Equifax consumer reports. (Docket No. 1 at 915). Plaintiff

never received any written notification from Defendants regarding the derogatory

account. On March 20, 2012 and May 15, 2012, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant
disputing the alleged account. (Docket No. 1 at 417). Defendants never responded to
Plaintiff's request for validation. (Docket No. 1 at 419, 422). Defendant continued
collection activity by continuing to report the alleged account as accurate to Transunion,
Experian, and Equifax consumer reporting agencies. (Docket No. 1 at 0x00A729, 931, 934).
Defendant MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, INC. obtained Plaintiff's Transunion
consumer report without a permissible purpose. (Docket No. 1 at 23). Plaintiff asserts
that there is no account that Plaintiff has that Defendants could possibly review for
collection.

4. Defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint.

5. Plaintiff files this response asking the Court to deny Defendant's Motion.

Il. STANDARD OF REVIEW

6. Federal rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only "a short and plain statement of the
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," in order to "give the defendant fair
notice of what the...claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Ailantic Corp. v.
Twombly,550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), quoting Conley v. Gibson,355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957).
"[A] complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed
factual allegations." Jd. At 555. "[W]e do not require heightened fact pleading of
specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face". Id.
At 570.

7. The complaint must only include "sufficient factual allegations to provide the grounds on

which the claim rests". Friends of Lake View School District v. Beebe, 578 F.3d 753, 762

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page 3o0f19 PagelD 68

(8" Cir. 2009). While "mere labels and conclusions" will not satisfy a plaintiff's burden,
there is no need for detailed factual allegation or specific facts that describe the evidence
to be presented. /d. A plaintiff satisfies their burden if they allege facts sufficient to
allow a court to infer "more than the mere possibility of misconduct". Ashcroft v. Iqbql,
129 W.Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009).

8. Well-pleaded allegations of fact and every inference fairly deducible therefrom are
accepted as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss. Erickson v. Pardus,551 U.S. 89, 93-
94 (2007). "[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that
actual proof of those facts is improbable, and "that a recovery is very remote and

unlikely." Twombly, 550 US. at 556.

Ill. ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES

9. "When considering Defendant's motion, the court must construe the factual allegations in
the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff." In re Stac Elecs. Sec. Litig., 89
F.3d 1399, 1403 oh Sir. 1996): Jones v. General Elec. Co., 87 F.3d 209, 21 17" Cir.
1996). "Only if no possible construction of the alleged facts will entitle plaintiff to relief
should the court grant defendant's motion." Hishon v. King & Spaulding, 467 U.S. 69,
73, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 2232 (1984). If the factual allegations in plaintiff's complaint
support any legal theory that entitles plaintiff to some relief, the court should overrule

defendant's motion to dismiss.

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page 4of19 PagelD 69

A. PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED SUFFICENT FACTS TO STATE A COGNIZABLE
CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANT MIDLAND CREDIT
MANAGEMENT, INC. FOR VIOLATION OF 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681b.

10. In this case, Plaintiff alleged a cause of action for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681b. The elements are:

a. That Defendant MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, INC. obtained Plaintiff' s
consumer credit report from Transunion on February 01,2011, May 01, 2011,
August 01, 2011, September 01, 2011, and February 01, 2012 with no permissible
purpose.

b. That Plaintiff has never had any business dealing or any accounts with, made
application for credit from, made application for employment with, applied for
insurance from, or received a bona fide offer of credit from the Defendant,
MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, INC. that would have given them
permissible purpose to obtain Plaintiff's consumer credit report.

c. That Plaintiff never gave his consent for the Defendant, MIDLAND CREDIT
MANAGEMENT, INC. to obtain his consumer credit report from any agency at
any time.

11. Plaintiff is not aware of, nor has the Defendant identified AT ANY TIME, what alleged

 

account, if any, the Defendant references in their motion as "giving them permissible
purpose" to obtain Plaintiffs consumer credit report and any information to identify
whether said alleged account was the type of account as defined in the FCRA that could
give the Defendant permissible purpose even if it existed.

12. No information has been provided as to what type of account the Defendant alleges it

owns that relates to the Plaintiff. There is no evidence as to whether the alleged account

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page5of19 PagelD 70

is the type of account (i.e. asset or demand deposit) that could possibly give the
Defendant permissible purpose to obtain Plaintiff's consumer credit report at any time
under the FCRA even IF it did exist and they did own it.

13. No existence or ownership of any account relating to the Plaintiff has been documented
and/or established through evidence, in any manner, by the Defendant that could possibly
give them permissible purpose to have obtained Plaintiffs consumer credit report. This
fact is precisely what the Plaintiff alleges in his claim for statutory damages. Defendant
should not be allowed to make an unsubstantiated claim of the existence and ownership
of an alleged account and expect the court to dismiss a claim against it as a result.

14. To survive a motion pursuant to a 12(b)(6) motion, a claimant must state "enough facts to
state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face," Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 570 (2007). Plaintiff sufficiently alleged facts necessary to prove each element of
his cause of action and the court must construe the factual allegations in the complaint in

the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

B. PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED SUFFICENT FACTS TO STATE A COGNIZABLE
CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANTS FOR VIOLATION OF 15 U.S.C.
0x00A7 1681s-2(b).

15. Defendants argue, "Pursuant to 0x00A7 1681s-2(b), liability for furnishers of information, like
Defendants, is limited to instances where the furnisher of information is on notice from a
credit reporting agency ("CRA") that the consumer disputes the reported information".
Further Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to assert that the CRAs ever notified

Defendants of his dispute and that Plaintiff's allegation that Defendants violated 0x00A7 1681s-

2(b) by not reporting to the credit bureaus that the debt was disputed; such allegation

Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint Page 5 of 19
Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page6of19 PagelD 71

would be a violation of 0x00A7 1681s-2(a). Defendants fail to mention that Plaintiff also alleges
that Defendants failed to fully and properly investigate Plaintiff's dispute of the
MIDLAND FUNDING, L.L.C. and MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, INC.
representation within Plaintiff's credit. (See Docket No. 1 at 954, 955, 956, 957, 62,
63, 64, 65). However, the fact that Defendants establish this defense necessarily
establishes that Plaintiff may have an alternative claim that the credit reporting agencies
breached its statutory duty to notify the Defendants. (See Chiang v. Verizon New England
Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 38 (1 Cir. 2010).

16. In this case, Plaintiff alleged a cause of action for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681s-2(b). The Elements are:

a. In February 2012, Plaintiff noticed that Defendants placed a derogatory and
inaccurate account in Plaintiffs Transunion, Experian, and Equifax consumer
reports.

b. Plaintiff on more than one occasion sent Defendants written communication
disputing the alleged account.

c. Plaintiff sent several written letters to Transunion, Experian, and Equifax
consumer reporting agencies disputing the alleged account being reported by
Defendants.

d. Defendants continued to report the erroneous and derogatory account as accurate

 

to Transunion, Experian, and Equifax consumer reporting agencies.
e. Defendants have never provided Plaintiff any information as to the alleged debt

being owed by Plaintiff, despite written requests.

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page 7 of19 PagelD 72

17. Furnishers are required to undertake five enumerated duties upon receipt of a notice that
the consumer has disputed the accuracy of completeness of any information provided by
that furnisher with a consumer reporting agency. (See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681s-2(b)(1)(A)
through (E)). Any furnisher who fails to comply with these duties is liable to the
consumer in a private cause of action for its negligent or willful noncompliance. (See 15
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681n and 16810). Numerous cases affirm Plaintiff's right to seek relief for
violation of these duties. King v. Equifax Info. Services, 2005 WL 1667783 (S.D. Tex.
July 15, 2005); Mendoza v. Experian Info. Solutions, Inc., 2003 WL 2005832 (S.D Tex.
Mar. 25, 2003); Carlson v. Trans Union, L.L.C, 259 F. Supp. 2d 517 (N.D. Tex. 2003);
Scott v. AmEx/Centurion, 2001 WL 1645362 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 18, 2001).

18. Defendants argue that, "Plaintiff fails to assert that the CRAs ever notified Defendants of
his dispute. Absent the existence of a dispute notification to Defendants by the CRAs
pursuant to 0x00A7 1681i(a)(2), Plaintiff cannot maintain a FCRA claim against Defendants
under the facts allged." In the case of Kibbie v. BP/Citibank, 2009 WL 2950365 (M_D.
Pa. Sept. 9, 2009); the court found that, finding sufficient pro se plaintiff's complaint
despite absence of allegations that the CRAs she notified of her dispute with furnisher
had informed the furnisher of the dispute, noting precedent in the Third Circuit that
"discovery is generally necessary to evaluate whether a claim actually exists, as the claim
may depend upon an act by the credit reporting agency". Plaintiff argues that he has
stated enough factual allegations against Defendants to render his claims "plausible".

19. To survive a motion pursuant to a 12(b)(6) motion, a claimant must state "enough facts to
state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face," Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S.

544, 570 (2007). "the plaintiff must give enough details about the subject matter of the

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page 8of19 PagelD 73

case to present a story that holds together. In other words, the court will ask itself could
these things have happened, not did they happen," Swanson v. Citibank, 2010 WL
2977297 (7" Cir. July 20, 2010). Plaintiff sufficiently alleged facts necessary to prove
each element of his cause of action and the court must construe the factual allegations in

the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

C. THE FDCPA IMPOSES A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD.

20. The FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692, et seq., is a strict liability statute, Taylor v. Perrin,
Landry deLaunay & Durand, 103 F.3d 1232 (50x2122 Cir. 1997): see also Irwin v. Mascot,
112 F. Supp. 2d 937 (N.D. Cal. 2000). "Because the Act imposes strict liability, a
consumer need not show intentional conduct by the debt collector to be entitled to

damages." Russell v. Equifax A.R.S., 74 F. 3d 30, 33-34 (20x2122 Cir. 1996).

D. THE FDCPA MUST BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED IN FAVOR OF
CONSUMER DEBTORS.

21. The FDCPA is a remedial statute. Hamilton v. United Healthcare of Louisiana, Inc., 310
F. 3d 385, 392 (5 Cir. 2002). The remedial nature of the FDCPA requires that courts
interpret it liberally. Clark v. Capital Credit & Collection Services, Inc., 460 F. 3d 1162,
1176 (9" Cir. 2006). "Because the FDCPA, like the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1601 ef seq., is a remedial statute, it should be construed liberally in favor of the

consumer." Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F.3d 1107, 1117 (20% Cir. 2002).

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document12 Filed 02/25/13 Page9of19 PagelD 74

E. THE FDCPA IS TO BE INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEAST
SOPHISTICATED CONSUMER STANDARD.

22. The FDCPA is to be interpreted "under an unsophisticated or least sophisticated
consumer standard." Gonzales v. Kay, 577 F. 3d 600, 603 (5" Cir. 2009) (quoting
Goswami v. Am. Collections Enter., Inc., 377 F. 3d 488, 495 6" Cir. 2004); Taylor v.
Perrin, Landry, deLaunay & Durand, 103 F.3d 1232, 1236 (5" Cir. 1997). A court must
"assume that the plaintiff-debtor is neither shrewd nor experienced in dealing with
creditors." Goswami v. Am. Collections Enter., Inc., 377 F. 3d at 495. "This standard
serves the dual purpose of protecting all consumers, including the inexperienced, the
untrained and the credulous, from deceptive debt collection practices and protecting debt
collectors against liability for bizarre idiosyncratic consumer interpretations of collection

materials." Zaylor v. Perrin, Landry, deLaunay & Durand, 103 F. 3d at 1236.

F. THE FDCPA BROADLY PROHIBITS UNFAIR OR UNCONSCIONABLE
COLLECTION METHODS, CONDUCT WHICH HARASSES, OPRESSES OR
ABUSES ANY DEBTOR, AND ANY FALSE, DECEPTIVE OR MISLEADING
STATEMENTS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE COLLECTION OF A DEBT.

23. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA") is a comprehensive statute which
prohibits a catalog of activities in connection with the collection of debt by third parties.
See 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692, et. seq. The FDCPA imposes civil liability on any person or entity
that violates its provisions, and establishes general standards of debt collector conduct,
defines abuse, and provided for specific consumer rights. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692k. The

operative provisions of the FDCPA declare certain rights to be provided to or claimed by

debtors, forbid deceitful and misleading practices, both generally and in a specific list of

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document 12 Filed 02/25/13 Page 10o0f19 PagelD 75

disapproved practices, and prohibit harassing and abusive tactics both generally and in a
specific list of disapproved practices.

24. In enacting the FDCPA, the United States Congress found that "[t]here is abundant
evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many
debt collectors," which "contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital
instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1692(a). Congress additionally found existing laws and procedures for redressing debt
collection injuries to be inadequate to protect consumers. 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692(b). It is the
express purpose of the FDCPA to "eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt
collectors, to insure that debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection
practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to
protect consumers against debt collection abuses." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692(e).

25. Accordingly, the FDCPA broadly enumerates several practices considered contrary to its
stated purpose, and forbids debt collectors from taking such action. The substantive heart
of the FDCPA lies in three broad prohibitions. First, a debt collector may not engage in
any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person
in connection with the collection of a debt." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692d. Second, a "debt
collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in
connection with the collection of any debt." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692e. And third, a "debt
collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any
debt." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692f. Simply it was designed to protect consumers from
unscrupulous collectors, whether or not there exists a valid debt, the FDCPA broadly

prohibits unfair or unconscionable collection methods, conduct which harasses, oppresses
