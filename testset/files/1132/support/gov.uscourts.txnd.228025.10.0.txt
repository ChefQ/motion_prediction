Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document10 Filed 02/19/13 Page5of16 PagelD 46

Defendants Midland Funding, LLC ("Midland Funding") and Midland Credit
Management, Inc. ("MCM7") (collectively "Defendants"), submit this Brief in Support of Their
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (the "Complaint") pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff filed this suit alleging that Defendants committed a laundry list of violations
under both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the "FDCPA") 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692 et. seq. and
the Fair Credit Reporting (the "FCRA") 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1681 et. seq.' Although Plaintiff's
Complaint alleges a myriad of violations, his complaint is devoid of any facts that would support
any recovery. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Complaint should be dismissed.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On January 23, 2013, Plaintiff Andrew J. Gonzalez ("Plaintiff") filed this suit against
Defendants. The Complaint, which is somewhat rambling, disjointed and contains virtually
nothing but conclusions, alleges that in February 2012, "Plaintiff obtained his consumer credit
reports from all three major consumer reporting agencies," and that "Plaintiff noticed that
Defendants MCM and Midland had placed derogatory and inaccurate information" on them

*2 The Complaint does not

"regarding an alleged account they were attempting to collect.
describe the supposedly "derogatory and inaccurate information" nor does it identify the account
whose reporting was supposedly inaccurate. Moreover, Plaintiff provides no specifics regarding
what information allegedly appeared on his credit reports and did not attach any portion of the

alleged offending credit report to his Complaint. The Complaint further alleges that in March

and May of 2012, Plaintiff sent letters demanding the validation of the alleged debt or cease and

desist from further collection activity.? Plaintiff describes Defendants' collection attempts as
Defendants' "disclosure of inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies." Plaintiff
alleges Defendants did not respond to either his March or May 2012 letter."

The Complaint further alleges that Plaintiff sent MCM a letter on July 26, 2012
"requesting proof that permission was given to pull [sic] TransUnion consumer credit report,"
and that on or around August 18, 2012, MCM responded.0x00B0 Other than stating that MCM
identified itself as a debt collector in the letter it sent Plaintiff, and that "MCM did not provide
any lawful proof that permission was given to obtain Plaintiff's Transunion consumer
reports...," Plaintiff does not describe the contents of the MCM letter in his Complaint.'

Plaintiff further alleges in his Complaint that he sent dispute letters to Experian,
TransUnion and Equifax "regarding the account being alleged by MCM and Midland."* Plaintiff
provides no information as to the contents of his dispute letter, and further fails to provide any
description of his "dispute." Plaintiff contends that after sending the dispute letters to Experian,
TransUnion and Equifax, that Defendants continued "to report the derogatory and erroneous
information;"" however, again Plaintiff provides no description of the information being reported
including how the information is "derogatory" or "erroneous." Plaintiff also alleges in his
Complaint that "[t]he only reason that the Defendants Midland and MCM have communicated
the erroneous and derogatory information regarding the alleged account after March 2012 to

TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax consumer reports was to attempt to collect on alleged

debt."'0x00B0 Plaintiff then asserts that Midland Funding "did not have a lawful purpose for
requesting, obtaining and using Plaintiff's consumer report.""!
Il. STANDARDS FOR DISMISSAL

The purpose of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is to
test the formal sufficiency of the statement of the claim for relief, and not to determine the facts
or merits of the case.'* In ruling on a motion to dismiss, courts must take the plaintiff's
allegations as true, view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and draw all inferences
in the plaintiff's favor.!0x00B0

The Supreme Court of the United States recently reiterated that "[w]hile a complaint
attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a
plaintiff's obligation to provide the `grounds' of his `entitle[ment] to relief? requires more than
labels and conclusions... "!* A Plaintiff's "Tfjactual allegations must be enough to raise a right
to relief above the speculative level", and a court should dismiss the case of any plaintiff who
cannot elevate his claim from merely "conceivable" to "plausible."!> Furthermore, this
"plausibility standard," however, "asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has
acted unlawfully," and where a complaint pleads facts that are "merely inconsistent with" a
defendant's liability, it "stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility."'(R) The

United States Supreme Court in Jgbal further held that "threadbare recitals of a cause of action's

elements supported by conclusory statements" are insufficient to overcome a motion to

dismiss. !"

IV. ARGUMENT
A. Plaintiff fails to state any viable FCRA claims.

1. The facts plead by Plaintiff do not give rise to 0x00A7 1681b claims against
Defendants.

Section 1681b of the FCRA, which sets forth the permissible purposes for furnishing
consumer reports, authorizes the issuance of a consumer report "to a person that a consumer
reporting agency has reason to believe `intends to use the information in connection with a credit
transaction involving the consumer on who the information is to be furnished and involving the
extension of credit to, or review or collection of an account of, the consumer...."?'(R)
Accordingly, where a debt collector "obtains a consumer credit report for the purposes of
collecting on an account, the utilization of the consumer credit report falls under a permissible
purpose use, which is authorized under the FCRA," and furthermore, "[a] debt collector cannot
be subject to liability under the FCRA on this basis alone."!"

In Counts V through IX of Plaintiff's Complaint, Plaintiff seeks statutory damages from

Defendants for their alleged violations of 0x00A7 1681b of the FCRA."" Specifically, Plaintiff alleges

purpose of conducting a review or engaging in collection efforts, to state a claim under the FCRA, plaintiff must
allege facts giving rise to a plausible inference that defendants did not obtain the credit report for use in conducting a
review or collecting debt.").

Case 4:13-cv-00050-A Document 10 Filed 02/19/13 Page9of16 PagelD 50

that no permissible purpose exists for Defendants to pull his credit report."' Plaintiff, however,
pleads that (1) liability of MCM applies equally to Midland Funding (and vice versa), and (2)
Midland Funding "`is an entity who at all relevant times was engaged, by use of the mails, in the
business of attempting to collect a "debt" from Plaintiff, as defined by 15 U.S.C 0x00A7 1692a(5)."
Because Plaintiff's pleading makes clear that Defendants' were engaged in debt collection, the
pulls were permissible under FCRA."*

2. Plaintiff fails to plead facts necessary to support a violation of 0x00A7 1681s-
2(b) as set forth in Counts III and IV of his Complaint.

Although 0x00A7 1681s-2(a) of the FCRA prohibits furnishers like Defendants from
"[rleporting information with actual knowledge of errors" and from "{r]eporting information
after notice and confirmation of errors," there is no private right of action for violations of 0x00A7
1681s-2(a) of the FCRA."* Pursuant to 0x00A7 1681s-2(b), liability for furnishers of information, like
Defendants, is limited to instances where the furnisher of information is on notice from a credit
reporting agency ("CRA") that the consumer disputes the reported information."> The
obligations of furnishers of information under 0x00A7 1681s-2(b) are as follows:

(1) In general
After receiving notice pursuant to Section 1681i(a)(2) of this title of a
dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information

provided by a person to a consumer reporting agency, the person shall--

(A) conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information;

(B) review all relevant information provided by the consumer reporting
agency pursuant to section 1681i(a)(2) of this title;

(C) report the results of the investigation to the consumer reporting
agency;

(D) if the investigation finds that the information is incomplete or
inaccurate, report those results to all other consumer reporting agencies to
which the person furnished the information and that compile and maintain
files on consumers on a nationwide basis; and

(E) if an item of information disputed by a consumer is found to be

inaccurate or incomplete or cannot be verified after any reinvestigation

under paragraph (1), for purposes of reporting to a consumer reporting

agency only, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation

promptly--

(i) modify that item of information;

(ii) delete that item of information; or

(iii) permanently block the reporting of that item of information.

(2) Deadline

A person shall complete all investigations, reviews, and reports required

under paragraph (1) regarding information provided by the person to a

consumer reporting agency, before the expiration of the period under

section 1681i(a)(1) of this title within which the consumer reporting

agency is required to complete actions required by that section regarding

that information."0x00B0

As shown above, the FCRA provides that before liability can be imposed against a

furnisher, the furnisher must receive "notice pursuant to 0x00A7 1681i(a)(2) of this title of a dispute

with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided by [the furnisher] to a

consumer reporting agency.""' Section 1681i(a)(2) requires that a CRA notify the furnisher of a
