Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendants Midland Funding, LLC

against Defendants alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1681 et. seq. and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the "FDCPA") 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1692 et.
seq.

2. Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed with prejudice because Plaintiffs
