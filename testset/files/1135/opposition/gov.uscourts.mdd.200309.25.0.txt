I. INTRODUCTION
Defendants American Home Realty Network, Inc. (“AHRN, Inc.”) and
Jonathan J. Cardella (“Cardella”) hereby oppose Plaintiff Metropolitan Regional
Information Systems, Inc.’s (“MRIS”) Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Although
MRIS’s Complaint contains several counts, MRIS’s motion seeks preliminary
relief exclusively on MRIS’s claims of “copyright infringement.” Memorandum in
Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (cited as “MRIS Brief”).
MRIS Brief at 1.
In its Brief, MRIS asserts it has seven registered compilation copyrights
containing real estate listing information and photographs. Its Complaint refers to
three additional registrations. MRIS’s database is unpublished and none of the
underlying text and photographs is registered as a copyright by MRIS.

See

Copyright Registrations attached as Exhibit 1.
MRIS’s motion should be denied because it has shown no urgency in
bringing this case.

AHRN, Inc.’s web site on which the allegedly infringing

materials appeared has been online since August of 2007. Declaration of AHRN,
Inc.’s CEO Jonathan J. Cardella (“5/18/12 Cardella Decl.”), Exhibit 2, ¶ 5. As one
of the largest multiple listing services in the country and an industry leader, MRIS
likely knew about AHRN, Inc.’s activities for some time before it sent AHRN, Inc.
a cease-and-desist letter on November 18, 2011, but did not file this case until
March 28, 2012. MRIS’s dilatory tactics require denial of the motion.
Apart from its being dilatory bringing suit and filing its motion, the Court
should deny MRIS’s motion additionally for the following reasons:

1

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 6 of 30

First, MRIS has not shown any likelihood that it will prevail on the merits of
its copyright claim because:
(1) MRIS has failed to established valid or enforceable copyright; the
underlying content of MRIS’s Database is not protectable, as it is composed of
factual information, which is not eligible for copyright; and
(2) MRIS has failed to establish copyright infringement, as it has not
compared (or even disclosed), the “selection, coordination and arrangement” of
its Database to the actual organization or arrangement of AHRN, Inc.’s database.
Instead, it erroneously compares the content of its database with screen shots of
content of AHRN’s website.
Second, MRIS has failed to present evidence of irreparable injury;
adopted a discredited “sweat of the brow” theory of harm; and alleged injury to
third parties which is irrelevant in the preliminary injunction context.
Third, the failure of MRIS’s irreparable injury allegations, and MRIS’s and
its allies’ concerted effort to flood AHRN, Inc. with cease-and-desist letters and
law suits to destroy AHRN, Inc., tips the balance of equities decidedly in AHRN,
Inc.’s favor.
Fourth, the public interest is best served by innovation and competition,
not by violations of the 2008 consent decree in the government’s antitrust suit
against the National Association of Realtors.
Fifth, proof of MRIS’s attempt to suppress and destroy AHRN, Inc.
through concerted action establishes a credible defense of copyright misuse.

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 7 of 30

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy involving the exercise
of very far-reaching power to be granted only sparingly and in limited
circumstances.” Microstrategy Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 245 F.3d 335, 339 (4th Cir.
2001) quoting Direx Israel, Ltd.v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 816
(4th Cir. 1991). “Under the new standard for preliminary injunctions, the plaintiff
must establish (1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to
suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of
equities tips in his favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.”
Wereldhave USA-San Antonio, L.P. v. Peter Fillat Architects, Inc., 2010 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 7660, at *6 (D. Md. Jan. 29, 2010), quoting Real Truth about Obama,
Inc. v. Federal Election Commission, 575 F.3d 342, 346 (4th Cir. 2009). The
Fourth Circuit [in Real Truth], “emphasized that this standard is more stringent
than the prior standard and that plaintiffs must clearly show that they are likely to
succeed on the merits and to suffer from irreparable harm before such an
extraordinary relief for an injunction may be awarded.” Id.
III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
A. INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
In 2005, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice sued the
National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) for violations Section 1 of the Sherman
Act, 15 U.S.C. §1 (2004), arising out of discriminatory policies of multiple listing
services and brokers encouraged and implemented through the NAR. Complaint
in U.S. v. National Association of Realtors (“NAR”), 05cv5140 (N.D. Ill. 2005),

3

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 8 of 30

attached as Exhibit 3. The complaint in that case demonstrates that the public
interest lies with competition, noting that “[b]y virtue of industry-wide participation
and control over a critically important input, MLS joint ventures have market
power in almost every relevant market.” Id. ¶23. The Division recognized that
brokers with innovative, Internet-based business models present a competitive
challenge to brokers who provide listings to their customers only by traditional
methods. Id. ¶ 29.
On November 18, 2008, the Department of Justice entered a consent
decree with the NAR, settling the Complaint with a Final Judgment by imposing
certain prohibitions on the real estate industry. Consent Decree attached as
Exhibit 4. NAR accepted prohibitions imposed upon it against promulgating and
enforcing any rule that:


Prohibits, restricts, or impedes access to, or discriminates against a webbased broker who provides to its customers all of the listing information
that is permitted under traditional methods; mail, fax, etc.; Exhibit 4,
Prohibition A, B at 5;



Prohibits, restricts, or impedes the referral of customers whose identities
are obtained from a website by a web-based broker to any other person,
or establishes the price of any such referral; id. Prohibition C;



Imposes fees or costs upon any broker who operates a website or upon
any person operating a website for a broker that charges fees in excess of
the reasonably estimated actual costs incurred by a multi list board in
providing listing information to the broker OR discriminates in fees or costs
charged to a broker versus a person operating a website for a broker, id.
Prohibition D.
B. DEFENDANT AHRN, INC.
Defendant AHRN, Inc. is a small, innovative California real estate

brokerage which has developed a novel system of software and database
4

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 9 of 30

applications that work together to facilitate real estate transactions between
buyers and sellers represented by real estate agents and brokers. Defendant has
applied this technology to objectively rate and rank real estate agents and to
identify them to prospective home buyers and sellers, based on their specific
requirements, through its web site: www.NeighborCity.com.
Decl., ¶ 4.

5/18/12 Cardella

This technological advancement was motivated by the lack of

comparable services then, and still, available on the market due to the industrywide “black out” of information rating real estate agents’ specific market activities
and professional performance. Id., ¶ 5. Other brokerage websites feature their
own agents or agents with whom they have cooperative referral agreements.
None rate, rank or even identify all the Realtors in an area. Some popular real
estate portal sites only suggest real estate agents who pay to be featured next to
properties within a designated geographic area. These sites derive their ratings
directly from feedback scores submitted by customers specifically invited by the
agent who may then cherry-pick the results incorporated in their performance
ratings. Id.
To fill the gap, AHRN, Inc. put all the real estate listings, foreclosure and
for sale by owner listings in the markets it serves in a database underlying its
NeighborCity site. AHRN created technology that continuously scores, ranks and
rates agents based on their transaction and listing history. Id., ¶ 6. Specifically, it
assesses how well agents perform in selling their clients’ homes relative to their
nearest competitors, as determined by a comparison to a proprietary “peer
index”. AHRN, Inc. also created “AgentMatch” technology that uses its ranking

5

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 10 of 30

and rating data with interested buyers of a seller’s property to match those
buyers with specialized and qualified local real estate agents. AgentMatch
quickly routes interested buyers and sellers searching major search engines
such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing for highly specific information to local agents to
make

introductions

and

schedule

property

viewings;

coordinates

their

communications; and allows AHRN, Inc. to monitor these interactions to improve
the level of service generally available to the public. Id.
AHRN, Inc.’s business model and its NeighborCity website offer unique
online real estate services. Id., ¶ 7. Unlike other websites, NeighborCity.com
lists buy-side real estate agent recommendations for virtually every property and
allows its users to contact those agents without releasing their personal contact
information until they are ready to do so. Id.
The data displayed on the NeighborCity web site originates from multiple
sources: brokers and agents, county tax assessor’s offices and related public
records, foreclosure data providers and from For Sale By Owner aggregators. Id.,
¶ 8. None of the sources involve access to the MRIS Database. NeighborCity
also provides school data from education.com, maps and Streetview® from
Google and geolocation data from third party providers. NeighborCity further
derives and publishes unique professional profiles incorporating the performance
metrics, statistics and rankings for each of the roughly one million residential real
estate agents in the US derived from the real estate data that it aggregates. The
key feature that shows buy-side agents next to listed properties assists buyers in
locating exclusive brokerage representation. This enables buyers to avoid the

6

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 11 of 30

inherent conflict of interest involved in working with an agent and brokerage that
brokers both the buy side and sell side of a given real estate sales transaction.
Id.
AHRN, Inc. provides services to the public free of charge. Id., ¶ 9. It is
typically compensated for its agent matching and referral services out of the local
buy-side agent and broker commissions, except when making referrals that result
in listing agreements, in which case AHRN, Inc. is compensated by the listing
brokerage. Neither the home-buyer, home seller, nor the home seller’s agent or
broker is charged any fees except in the case of a listing referral as mentioned.
If the home purchase is not closed by the particular agent to whom a referral is
made, no compensation is collected. Id.
C.

PLAINTIFF MRIS

MRIS is one of the largest regional real estate multiple listing services in
the United States. See Complaint, ¶ 13; MRIS Brief, 1. It serves real estate
brokers and agent subscribers and other authorized subscribers in Maryland,
Virginia and the District of Columbia and also in parts of Delaware, West Virginia
and Pennsylvania. MRIS Brief, 1.

MRIS maintains a database of real estate

listing information (“MRIS Database”) that it alleges it has registered with the U.S.
Copyright Office under procedures applicable to automated databases.
Complaint, ¶¶ 17-18; MRIS Brief, 4-5. Although “automated databases” are not
defined in the Copyright Act, the Copyright Office’s Circular 65 considers
databases a form of compilation, and registration procedures for automated
databases are governed by Circular 65 and 37 C.F.R. § 202.3(b)(5). A

7

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 12 of 30

compilation, as defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101 (2010), is “a work formed by the
collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,
coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole
constitutes an original work of authorship.”
MRIS claims not only rights in the automated database compilation itself,
but also rights in “the original expressive contributions (e.g., photographs) MRIS
has made or acquired to individual property listings in the MRIS Database …”
MRIS Brief, 10; Complaint, ¶ 17. However, MRIS has not registered copyrights
to any of the individual data or photographs contained in the MRIS Database.
See Memorandum in Support of Defendant AHRN, Inc.’s Rule 12(b) Motion to
Dismiss [D.E. 24-1], 10-11.
The real estate listing information in the MRIS Database is sourced
directly from professional brokers and agents under contract to MRIS.
Complaint, ¶ 15; MRIS Brief, 3. MRIS alleges its MRIS Database is unpublished.
Complaint, ¶ 18.

However, it makes the Database content available to its

subscribers through a “portfolio of technology solutions,” including broker and
agent software products and services. Complaint, ¶ 14; MRIS Brief, 3. One of
the software products and services MRIS offers to its subscribers is the Internet
Data Exchange Program (“MRIS IDX”) which allows subscribers to display
Database content to the public on their own web sites. Complaint, ¶¶ 19-21;
MRIS Brief, 3-4.
The data feed in the MRIS IDX program is provided in the Real Estate
Transaction Standard form (“RETS”). Complaint, ¶ 20, MRIS Brief, 3-4. MRIS

8

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 13 of 30

also licenses the RETS feed to third parties. Complaint, ¶ 21, MRIS Brief, 4.
Upon information and belief, one of the third parties to which MRIS licenses its
RETS feed is the NAR which displays content from the MRIS Database on its
website: www.Realtor.com. MRIS also displays content from the Database on its
own website: www.HomesDatabase.com, and to journalists and others via its
Pending Home Sales Index monthly market summary. Complaint, ¶13, MRIS
Brief, 5.
The selected content and arrangement of listing data MRIS provides to its
subscribers and the public vary widely.

For example, upon information and

belief, MRIS subscribers may receive a (1) long form listing, see listing for 15230
Riding Club Drive, Exhibit 5 hereto; (2) an agent synopsis listing, see synopsis
for 15230 Riding Club Drive, Exhibit 6 hereto; and various condensed listing
summaries, see Weichert listing summaries, Exhibit 7 hereto. The information
provided to the public through www.homesdatabase is yet another type of
condensed listing summary, see homesdatabase listing for 214 Watkins Pond
Road, Exhibit 8.
D. BACKSTORY OF THIS LITIGATON
The NAR held its annual meeting in Anaheim, California from November
11 to 14, 2011.

Defendants have learned that the annual meeting featured

discussions of the perceived threat AHRN, Inc. poses to the industry and what
the industry could do to shut down AHRN, Inc. 5/18/12 Cardella Decl., ¶ 10.
Beginning in November just before the Anaheim meeting, AHRN, Inc.
began to receive what would become an onslaught of cease-and-desist letters

9

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 14 of 30

from brokers and multiple listing services.

These have continued into

2012. Most of the letters, 20 in all since early November, 2011, are substantially
similar as to form and content, allege copyright infringement and threaten legal
action. Three (3) additional letters are from brokers objecting to AHRN, Inc’s
referral program; and three (3) letters involve complaints to governmental
agencies related to either alleged copyright infringement and/or licensing
violations. On November 15, 2011, the morning after the Anaheim NAR meeting
closed, AHRN, Inc. received one of these cease-and-desist letters from an
attorney for the NorthStar MLS in Minnesota. Three days later, on November 18,
2011, AHRN, Inc. received a cease-and-desist letter from MRIS, attached as
Exhibit B to the Complaint. Id., ¶ 11.
On November 15, 2011, the morning after the Anaheim NAR meeting
closed, AHRN, Inc. received one of these cease-and-desist letters from an
attorney for the NorthStar MLS web site in Minnesota. Three days, later on
November 18, 2011, AHRN, Inc. received a cease-and-desist letter from MRIS,
attached as Exhibit B to the Complaint. Id.
On December 22, 2011 AHRN, Inc. was copied on an email, attached as
Exhibit 9, from John Mosey of the NorthStar MLS to his attorney Mitchell Skinner,
in which Mosey complained of a sense that after “dropping C&D’s on the head of
the bad fellow,” i.e. Jonathan Cardella, nothing had changed, and he called for
following up the “full force and fury” of the cease-and-desist letters with:





"Collective action;"
Imparting a "world of hurt" on Cardella;
Using copyright litigation as the means to do that;
Sharing the cost of litigation among the MLSs;

10

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 15 of 30




“Connecting the dots between all of the MLSs;”
“Sending a message that our copyrights are enforceable and we
are serious about punishing anyone who doesn’t take us seriously.”

The result of the Mosey email was the present lawsuit filed on March 19,
2012, followed by an additional suit filed on April 18, 2012, in Minnesota,
Regional Multiple Listing Service of Minnesota, Inc., d/b/a NorthstarMLS v.
American Home Realty Network, Inc., 0:12cv965 (D. Minn). 5/18/12 Cardella
Decl., ¶ 12.
These actions by brokers and multiple listing services came shortly after
AHRN, Inc. rolled out updated profile pages for 850,000 agents that feature
agent scores and performance metrics based on their transaction history. See
Inman News Daily Real Estate News (May 15, 2012), copy attached as Exhibit
10; 5/18/12 Cardella Decl., ¶ 13. Other companies that rolled out real estate
agent profile pages were forced to discontinue publication of those pages within
days after their respective launches, such as Redfin, another innovative real
estate brokerage. See Inman News article, supra; 5/18/12 Cardella Decl., ¶ 14.
IV. ARGUMENT
A.

MRIS CANNOT SUCCEED ON THE MERITS

In order to establish copyright infringement of a compilation copyright,
plaintiff MRIS must show a likelihood of success on the merits.

“The two

elements of copyright infringement are: (1) ownership of a valid copyright by the
party complaining of infringement, and (2) unauthorized copying of the protected
work by the infringing party.” Universal Furniture Intl., Inc. v. Collezione Europa
USA, Inc., 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 22212 at *14 (4th Cir. Aug. 29, 2006)
(unpublished), citing Keeler Brass Co. v. Cont'l Brass Co., 862 F.2d 1063, 1065
11

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 16 of 30

(4th Cir. 1988).
MRIS cannot succeed on the merits because it: (1) has failed to establish
the eligibility for copyright of its database or any valid copyright in the underlying
text and photographs of its compilation patent; (2) even if the subject matter of
MRIS’s compilation copyright were theoretically copyrightable, MRIS has failed to
identify sufficiently, nor indeed at all, the text, photographs, authors and
photographers.
1. A Substantial Question Exists Whether The Underlying Text is
Copyrightable
a. Catalogs Are Less Copyrightable
MRIS asserts that its Database provides its subscribers access to “… a
copyrighted automated catalog, containing a compilation of regional real estate
listings and related informational content.” MRIS Brief 1 (emphasis added). The
courts have held that raw data and facts are not copyrightable and that due "to
their highly factual nature, . . . generally fall towards the less-protected end of the
spectrum" of copyrightable material. Franklin Mach. Prods. v. Heritage Food
Serv. Equip, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89666 at *9, *12 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 5,
2007) (Court dismissed complaint) (“Franklin Machine I”); 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
18989 at *2, *7 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 11, 2008)

(Court ordered plaintiff to pay

defendant’s attorneys fees) (“Franklin Machine II”).
In Franklin Machine I at *5, the court also stated that “[t]he copyright in a
compilation -- like the catalogs at issue in this case -- extends only to the material
contributed by the author of such work, but not to the preexisting materials,”
citing 17 U.S.C. § 103(b). See plaintiff’s counsel’s advice to MRIS and others in

D. Charron and J. Westermeier, MRIS Guidance Paper, attached as Exhibit 11. 1
b. MRIS’s Catalog Databases Are Not Copyrightable,
As They Lack Originality
Copyright protection is unavailable for both derivative works and
compilations alike unless, when analyzed as a whole, they display sufficient
originality so as to amount to an "original work of authorship." See 17 U.S.C. §
101 (defining a "derivative work", inter alia, as a work containing alterations
"which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship"); id. (defining a
“compilation” as requiring that "the resulting work as a whole constitutes an
original work of authorship"). The originality required for copyright protection is
essentially the same. See Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S.
340, 358 (U.S. 1991) ("Originality requires only that the author make the
selection or arrangement independently . . . and that it display some minimal
level of creativity.")

Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Publishing Co. 158 F.3d

674, 680 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirmed district court finding that the “elements of the
West case reports for which West seeks copyright protection lack sufficient
originality or creativity to be protectable--whether considered separately or
together.”) Id. at 681.
In Universal Furniture, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 22212 at *12-13, the Fourth
Circuit affirmed the denial of a motion for preliminary injunction based “on the
uncertainty that [the] … compilations are in fact copyright able” where they likely

“Our recommended practice, which we address through the Program, is to provide
separate copyright protection for each listing beyond the compilation [because] … the
copyright protection for automated databases as compilations is even weaker than the
protection accorded more “traditional”, hard-copy compilations.” MRIS Guidance Paper,
Exhibit 11, at 20.
13

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 18 of 30

failed to meet the Fourth Circuit’s test that “the design must reflect the designer's
artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences." Superior
Form Builders, Inc. v. Dan Chase Taxidermy Supply Co., Inc., 74 F.3d 488, 494
(4th Cir. 1996), (quoting Brandir Int'l, Inc. v. Cascade Pac. Lumber Co., 834 F.2d
1142, 1145 (2d Cir. 1987)).
Nowhere in its motion does MRIS describe the identification, selection or
arrangement of its databases in such a way that the resulting work as a whole
constitutes an original work of authorship. The Supreme Court in Feist noted that
“facts are not copyrightable,” but “compilations of facts generally are.” Feist, 499
U.S. at 344.
Many compilations consist of nothing but raw data i.e., wholly
factual information, not accompanied by any original written
expression. On what basis may one claim a copyright in such a
work? Common sense tells us that 100 uncopyrightable facts do
not magically change their status when gathered in one place….
The sine qua non of copyright is originality.
Id. at 345. See Nautical Solutions Mktg. v. Boats.com, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
6304, at *7 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1, 2004)

(extraction of facts from a website by

competing yacht broker’s web site was unprotectable because alleged infringer
only cut and pasted the industry standard yacht descriptions from the registrant
and the photographs had been taken by others without transfer of copyrights.)
Where the compilation compiler adds no written expression, but
rather lets the facts speak for themselves …. [t]he only conceivable
expression is in the manner in which the compiler has selected and
arranged the facts… No matter how original the format, however,
the facts themselves do not become original through association.
This inevitably means that the copyright in a factual compilation is
thin. Notwithstanding a valid [compilation] copyright, a subsequent

14

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 19 of 30

compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another’s
publication….
Id. at 349. See Richmond Homes Mgt, Inc. v. Raintree, Inc, 1995 U.S. App.
LEXIS 26452, at *9 (4th Cir. Sep. 18, 1995):
“The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to
the material contributed by the author of such work, as
distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work,
and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.
The copyright in such work is independent of and does not affect or
enlarge the scope, duration, ownership or substance of, any
copyright protection in the preexisting material.”
Here the compiler MRIS has added no written expression, as far as can
be detected (the compilation is itself unpublished). The compiler does not make
any selections, texts or photographs; they are provided on automatic pilot
through uploading by the subscribers. MRIS Brief at 3.
In short, the compilations allegedly infringed lack the originality to be
copyrightable.
2. MRIS’s Purported Registrations of Text and Photographs
Are Invalid For Failure To Identify Any Author and Photographer
All of MRIS’s copyright registrations list MRIS as the copyright claimant
and refer to preexisting “text and photograph(s).” None of the registrations lists
an actual author for either text or photographs.
In Muench Photography, Inc. v. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Co.,
712 F. Supp. 2d 84 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); the court granted summary judgment
against Muench, a company owned by two photographers, which had sued a
textbook publisher and its printer for infringement of database compilation
copyrights. The Court held that under 17 U.S.C.S. § 103(b), when the work at

15

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 20 of 30

issue is a compilation, the copyright extends only to the material contributed by
the author of the compilation (and not to the underlying works).

Muench

Photography, 712 F. Supp. 2d at 90; see also Richmond Homes, 1995 U.S. App.
LEXIS 26452, at *8-9.
The Muench court further held that: (1) the registration of a collective work
reaches the individual works only when the author of the collective work authored
each of the individual works, id. at 94; (2) in any event, the registrant of a
compilation copyright must list the names of the authors of the underlying works,
id. ; and (3) suggested that the author who filed registration for collective work
must be the same author of the underlying individual works that were the subject
of the infringement, id.; citing Woods v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 920 F. Supp.
62, 64 (S.D.N.Y.1996), Richmond Homes, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 26452, at *8-9
(“Having concluded that the district court's finding of common ownership … of the
copyrights is clearly erroneous, it follows that the … copyrights cannot be merged
as derivative creations of the same owner”).
Thus, MRIS’s failure to provide the names of all authors of independent
works contained in the database, limits the registration and the scope of any
infringement suit to the database as a whole. It does not cover the individual
works contained therein. See Muench Photography, 712 F. Supp. 2d at 95; see
also Alaska Stock, LLC v. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publ. Co., 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 108041, at *11-12 (D. Alaska Sep. 21, 2010) (same); Bean v. Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt Publ. Co., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83676, at *6-7 (D. Ariz. Aug. 10,
2010) (same).

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 21 of 30

Without identification of the text and its authors, the photographs and their
photographers found in the MRIS database, the compilation copyright is invalid
or unenforceable as to those individual elements of the database.
3. MRIS Has Not Established Infringement of Its Database
Plaintiff’s copyright infringement claims are rooted in its broad non-specific
allegations that (1) “[d]efendants are obtaining and copying MRIS copyrighted
information, without authorization, from or sourced from the [allegedly
unpublished] MRIS database,”

Complaint, ¶¶ 18, 29; and (2) AHRN, Inc.

“provides [its] customers unauthorized access to and use of the copyrighted
MRIS Database and informational content in support of their referral business,”
Complaint, ¶ 26, MRIS Brief, 1, 6.

In its Brief, MRIS twice expresses its belief

that AHRN, Inc. “is receiving and copying copyrighted content from the MRIS
Database via multiple sources, including by way of example, from a RETS data
feed that is sent to a licensed real estate brokerage, and/or by copying and
compiling such content from MRIS or third party web sites.” MRIS Brief, 6, 11.
In support of these broad allegations and speculative beliefs, MRIS points to a
series of screen shots allegedly taken from the NeighborCity web site.

See

MRIS Brief, 11, referring to Exhibits F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4, F-5, and F-6 to Plaintiff’s
Motion.

MRIS alleges that these screenshots show that AHRN, Inc. uses

materials that are “…identical… to MRIS’s copyrighted content … since the
website incorporates MRIS’s copyrighted content in its entirety” (emphasis in
original). MRIS Brief, 11.
However, Feist makes clear that: (1) “a compilation is copyrightable only

17

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 22 of 30

to the extent that it features an original selection, coordination or arrangement,”
and (2) establishing infringement of a compilation copyright requires “copying of
constituent elements of a work that are original,” Feist 499 U.S. at 360-61
(emphasis added). This has come to require what is known as a “dissection
analysis.” Haslett v. Hasselbeck, 757 F. Supp. 2d 73, 81 (D. Mass. 2010).
To establish infringement, MRIS must show substantial similarity between
its copyrighted work and what it alleges AHRN, Inc. to have copied. In evaluating
substantial similarity for determining copyright infringement, the courts “first
‘dissect’ the work to remove those aspects not protected by copyright….That
dissection analysis is an appropriate method of evaluating substantial similarity
even when actual copying has occurred. “By dissecting the accused work and
identifying those features which are protected the court can also determine those
aspects of the work that should be considered in the comparative analysis under
the ordinary observer test."

Yankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater Candle, LLC,

259 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 2001).
In its Brief, MRIS has failed to conduct a proper dissection analysis and
indeed, to the extent it compares anything, it compares the proverbial apples to
oranges. The proper thing to compare would be the “selection, coordination or
arrangement” of MRIS’s registered database to that of the AHRN, Inc. database.
Instead, MRIS compares unprotected elements of its database, unpublished and
undisclosed, with individual elements of AHRN, Inc.’s NeighborCity.com
webpage, without first removing the unprotected individual elements from
consideration.

B.

MRIS HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH IRREPARABLE INJURY

MRIS’s Complaint is largely silent as to the extent and nature of its alleged
damages from copyright infringement. It alleges only that it is entitled to the
maximum statutory damages based on willful infringement, and alternatively, its
actual damages plus AHRN, Inc.’s profits from infringement “as will be proven at
trial,” see, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 43, 49, 55, 64, 73, 83, but provides no other
specific allegations of damages.
In its Brief, MRIS alleges it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the
absence of injunctive relief on the basis that AHRN, Inc.’s alleged infringement
“hinders MRIS’s rights to control the means and methods by which its
copyrighted works will be seen by the public.” MRIS Brief, 11. 2 It also alleges
significant harm to its real estate brokers and agent subscribers by allegedly
“making it impossible for brokers to maintain control over the dissemination of
their own listing information.” Id., 8.
MRIS has presented three declarations in support of irreparable injury.
Two are by MRIS subscribers: Campbell Declaration, MRIS Brief Exhibit D and
Coile Declaration, id Exhibit E; one by its Chief Marketing Officer, Heithaus
Declaration, id. Exhibit A. These declarations are grossly inadequate to establish
MRIS’s irreparable injury.
Indeed, the Court should strike or disregard the two subscriber
Declarations as irrelevant, because “[t]he two more important factors [in the four
part preliminary injunction test are] … those of irreparable injury to the plaintiff
2

At the same time, MRIS contends its Database is “unpublished,” see Complaint, ¶ 18,
and thus not disclosed to the public.
19

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 24 of 30

without a decree and of likely harm to the defendant with a decree.” Universal
Furniture, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 22212 at *6 (emphasis added). This is true as
a general matter even outside the realm of copyrights. The court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction unless the plaintiff asserts his own injury. See Warth v. Sedin,
422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) ("The Art. III judicial power exists only to redress or
otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party, even though the
count or judgment may benefit others collaterally.”) (emphasis added).
Both Campbell and Coile make the identical allegation that “the
NeighborCity.com website has caused and is causing irreparable harm to my real
estate brokerage and business in Maryland.” Campbell Decl. ¶ 4, Coile Decl. ¶
4. Allegations of injury to third parties are of no moment to the determination of
irreparable injury to Plaintiff MRIS. See Warth, 422 U.S., at 499.
The Declaration by MRIS’s Heithaus is also inadequate to establish
irreparable injury for several reasons. First, MRIS alleges no “irreparable injury”
to itself. Heithaus alleges only “significant harm.” Heithaus Decl. at ¶ 9. Second,
the preponderance of harm that Heithaus alleges is, again, harm to MRIS’s
“subscriber brokers and agents,” id. ¶ 10, and “reducing the revenues that MRIS
broker subscribers and agents would otherwise earn,” id. ¶12.
The only harm MRIS alleges to itself is the result of inaccuracies in the
current status of properties on the NeighborCities.com website, which, MRIS
claims affects the credibility and integrity of the information MRIS publishes and
disseminates and hurts its reputation, id. ¶ 9, and “dilutes the value of the MRIS’s
database,” id. ¶ 13. But the alleged inaccuracies on AHRN, Inc.’s website would

20

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 25 of 30

presumptively harm AHRN, Inc., not MRIS.

Moreover this allegation has no

support and is entirely speculative, in that MRIS fails to present any evidence
from any witness in whose eyes MRIS’s reputation was actually harmed by
alleged mistakes on the NeighborCity web site.

It is also inconsistent with

copyright injury because the greater the discrepancies in the comparison
between the MRIS Database, a “thinly” copyrighted compilation database, and
the NeighborCity listings, the less likely there is infringement.
The only remaining allegation of harm, not “irreparable injury,” is that
AHRN, Inc.’s unauthorized use of real estate listings “dilutes the value of the
MRIS database.” Id. ¶ 13. Again, this allegation is speculative and unsupported
by any evidence. It is based on the assumption that purely informational real
estate listings are copyrightable. It also lacks any allegation, let alone proof, of
the historic value of the database and the current value of the database and
proof of cause and effect between AHRN, Inc.’s use of the listings and any
provable reduced value of the database. Finally, this alleged type of harm would
be compensable with money damages, and therefore, not a proper basis for an
irreparable injury determination.
C.

THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES FAVORS AHRN, INC.

The timing and activities of the NAR, Northstar MLS, MRIS and other
multiple listing services in late 2011 and early 2012 strongly suggests that this
suit is part of an effort spearheaded by the National Association of Realtors to
shut down Defendants’ Internet-based real estate agent ranking and rating
website, www.NeighborCity.com by forcing AHRN, Inc. to spend its resources

21

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 26 of 30

fighting off litigation. Thus for AHRN, Inc. these and possible additional lawsuits
are an existential threat, the very intent of which is expressed by the Mosey
email, Exhibit 9.
By contrast, MRIS has established no cognizable injury to itself. First,
injury to third parties is not recognized for irreparable injury, which means that
the Campbell and Coile declarations must be disregarded.

Second, MRIS’s

claimed loss of “sweat of the brow” investment must also be disregarded
because that is a concept that has been completely repudiated by the Supreme
Court in Feist, 499 U.S. at 359-360.
Thus, the ongoing damages to AHRN, Inc. clearly outweigh the zero
damages to MRIS. The equities tip decidedly in AHRN, Inc.’s favor.
D. THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS BEST SERVED BY COMPETITION
MRIS alleges that the public interest would be served by an injunction
because it would prevent the “misappropriation of the skills, creative energies
and resources which are invested in the protected work,” quoting Apple
Computer Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F. 2d 1240, 1255 (3d Cir. 1983).
MRIS Brief 14. This is the “sweat of the brow” or rationale for copyrights that the
Supreme Court specifically repudiated in Feist. In Feist, the Supreme Court held
that its application of the 1909 Copyright Act makes clear that the “statute did not
permit the ‘sweat of the brow’ approach. … Without a doubt the ‘sweat of the
brow” doctrine flouted basic copyright principles.” Feist, 499 U.S. at 353-354.
Thus Feist overrules Apple on which MRIS rests its public interest argument.

E. AHRN, INC.’S DEFENSE OF COPYRIGHT MISUSE
Even before discovery, the Mosey email strongly suggests that Mr. Mosey
intends to violate prohibitions of the DOJ Consent Decree with NAR.

What

occurred after the NAR annual meeting redoubles suspicions that NAR, multiple
listing services and certain brokers are currently engaged in what amounts to a
potential U.S. v NAR II.
Lending further evidence of concerted anticompetitive action by the
multiple listing services, in addition to the sudden flood of cease-and-desist
letters after Anaheim is the following: AHRN, Inc. met every cease-and-desist
letter with an offer to negotiate a license for the use of the brokers’ or multiple
listing services’ website. In each case, AHRN’s overture to license was rebuffed
out of hand without negotiations.
essentially the same language

Each rejection used the same format and
Attached as Exhibit 12 are the offer to and

rejection from MRIS and as Exhibit 13, the offer to and rejection from NorthStar.
The universal rejections raise the spectre of concerted refusals to deal by entities
with market power which violate the antitrust laws. See Realcomp II, Ltd. v. FTC,
635 F.3d 815, 824, 829 (6th Cir. 2011); Robertson v. Sea Pines Real Estate,
2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 9694, at *8-9 (4th Cir. S.C., May 14, 2012).
“A successful defense of misuse of copyright bars a culpable plaintiff from
prevailing on an action for infringement of the misused copyright.” Lasercomb
America, Inc. v. Job Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970, 972 (4th Cir. 1990). (injunction
reversed).

A full blown antitrust case need not be proven by defendants to

prevail on a copyright misuse defense:

23

Case 8:12-cv-00954-DKC Document 25 Filed 05/18/12 Page 28 of 30

The attempted use of a copyright to violate antitrust law probably
would give rise to a misuse of copyright defense, the converse is
not necessarily true -- a misuse need not be a violation of antitrust
law in order to comprise an equitable defense to an infringement
action. The question is not whether the copyright is being used in a
manner violative of antitrust law (such as whether the licensing
agreement is "reasonable"), but whether the copyright is being
used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the
grant of a copyright.
Id. at 978.
In Ocean Atl. Woodland Corp. v. DRH Cambridge Homes, 2003 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 16737, at *16 (N.D. Ill. Sep. 24, 2003), the Court held that assertion of a
prospective copyright misuse defense cast grave doubt on whether plaintiff could
prevail on the merits of its copyright infringement claim. The existence of the
defense was among the deficiencies in proof of likelihood of success on the
merits that warranted denial of a motion for preliminary injunction.
V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, defendants AHRN, Inc. and Cardella
respectfully request the Court to deny MRIS’s motion for preliminary injunction.
