IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND
GREENBELT DIVISION

METROPOLITAN REGIONAL
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC.,

CIVIL ACTION NO.
8:12-cv-00954-AW

Plaintiff,
v.
AMERICAN HOME REALTY NETWORK, INC.
and JONATHAN J. CARDELLA,
Defendants.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, and for the reasons set forth in the
accompanying Memorandum, Plaintiff Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc.
(“MRIS”) respectfully moves this Court for an order preliminarily enjoining Defendants
American Home Realty Network, Inc. d/b/a NeighborCity.com (“AHR”) and Jonathan J.
Cardella, (collectively, “Defendants”), their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and
those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order
by personal service or otherwise, from copying, using, displaying, distributing, or creating
derivative works from copyrighted informational content taken from MRIS’ real estate listing
database (“MRIS Database”), during the pendency of this action.
As detailed in the accompanying memorandum and declarations attached thereto, MRIS
is one of the country’s largest online real estate multiple listing services. Through the MRIS
Database, MRIS maintains and provides authorized, licensed subscribers and other authorized
users with access to and use of a copyrighted automated catalog that contains a compilation of

regional real estate property listings and related informational content. To build their real estate
referral business, Defendants have unlawfully taken copyrighted informational content, including
real estate listings, photographs, and related content, from the MRIS Database for its own
website, NeighborCity.com. A preliminary injunction is necessary to stop Defendants’ copyright
infringement and to protect MRIS, its authorized real estate broker and agent subscribers, and the
public, from the irreparable harm that arises every day that Defendants are permitted to continue
their infringing activities.
A proposed Order is submitted with this motion.
Respectfully submitted,
Dated: April 4, 2012
