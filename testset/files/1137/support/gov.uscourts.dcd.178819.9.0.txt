Case: 1:16-cv-00825 (CRC)

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR AWARD OF COSTS
Plaintiff Paul Burke respectfully petitions the Court for an award of costs as provided by
the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E). Plaintiff only seeks payment
of the $400 filing fee.
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal on June 30, 2016 after receiving the
documents requested. Plaintiff has substantially prevailed and received the documents by "a
voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency" (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)). He has
provided public benefit, putting the important information online, without commercial benefit to
him. Defendant HHS acted unreasonably in withholding for years information which it had
provided to other members of the public, and in authorizing the original deciding official to make
decisions on the administrative appeal.
Plaintiff is filing this motion to keep the case moving, in case settlement negotiations fail
to resolve the remaining issue of cost. Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 7(m) Plaintiff has discussed
with HHS counsel, and the agency takes no position at this time.
ELIGIBILITY FOR AWARD OF COSTS
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E) says,
"(i) The court may assess against the United States… litigation costs reasonably incurred
in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.
16-825 PLAINTIFF COSTS, JULY 2016, PAGE 1

Case 1:16-cv-00825-CRC Document 9 Filed 07/11/16 Page 2 of 7

"(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a complainant has substantially prevailed if the
complainant has obtained relief through… a voluntary or unilateral change in position by
the agency, if the complainant’s claim is not insubstantial."
For almost three years HHS improperly refused to release the documents. They keep the
documents on a password-protected web portal for instant release to Accountable Care
Organizations, which serve Medicare patients (Exhibit 6 and paragraph 7 in Plaintiff's
Declaration filed with this Motion). HHS could have accessed the documents and given them to
Plaintiff instantly. Instead, HHS released the documents 1,059 days after it received the FOIA
request, 440 days after it received the administrative appeal, but only 35 days after the court case
was filed, one day after HHS FOIA staff told Plaintiff they were aware of the court case, and on
the same day the HHS Answer to the Complaint was originally due.
HHS only provided the documents when they were facing the deadline to respond to the
lawsuit. The timing of this "unilateral change in position by the agency" was too far from the
dates of the request and the administrative appeal, and too close to the court filing, to be
coincidental. Dates are documented in the Plaintiff's Declaration.
Requests for costs in FOIA cases survive dismissal of the underlying case (Carter v. VA,
780 F.2d 1479, 1481 (9th Cir. 1986); Anderson v. HHS, 3 F.3d 1383, 1385 (10th Cir. 1993)).
ENTITLEMENT FOR AWARD OF COSTS
Four aspects entitle the plaintiff to award of his costs (Davy v. CIA, 550 F.3d 1155, 1159
(D.C. Cir. 2008)):
(1) Public benefit derived from the case - CMS has 430 Accountable Care
Organizations participating in the "Shared Savings Program" in 49 states and DC, serving 7.7
million patients (Exhibit 12 in Plaintiff's Declaration, "Medicare Makes Enhancements to the
Shared Savings Program ..." Press release June 6, 2016 from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, "CMS"). With 7.7 million patients, this is a large effort by CMS to give financial
16-825 PLAINTIFF COSTS, JULY 2016, PAGE 2

Case 1:16-cv-00825-CRC Document 9 Filed 07/11/16 Page 3 of 7

rewards to doctors and hospitals participating in Accountable Care Organizations, when they
reduce unnecessary spending on their Medicare patients (42 CFR 425.604(d) and 425.606(d)).
Documents obtained by this case govern the wording which these organizations must use to tell
patients about the program and its incentives (42 CFR 425.20 and 425.310(c)). Because of this
case, anyone can now see this wording, which covers important topics such as reducing the cost
of Medicare and coordinating care.
Plaintiff has already posted the documents received in this case online for anyone to see,
and he is preparing an analysis for publication (paragraph 1 in Plaintiff's Declaration).
(2) Lack of commercial benefit to the plaintiff - Plaintiff derives no income from the
information, nor from his website, which does not take advertisements and is maintained as a
contribution to the public interest.
(3) Nature of the plaintiff's interest in the records - Plaintiff needed the records to
report fully on how Medicare patients are informed about Accountable Care Organizations. He
can now report on what CMS allows and requires these organizations to tell patients.
(4) Reasonableness of the agency's withholding of the requested documents - HHS
was unreasonable in three ways: the records were not exempt, processing time was excessive,
and the administrative appeal process was not independent of the original decision.
(4A) RECORDS WERE NOT EXEMPT
Plaintiff's request asked for "signs," "standardized written notices," "templates," and
"model language," which CMS gives to medical providers in Accountable Care Organizations.
The request is Exhibit 1 in Plaintiff's Declaration. The following wording identifies the material.
CMS used this wording when it published its Final Rule (76 Federal Register 67946-67947,
11/2/11):
•

"CMS will develop appropriate language" for signs, which medical providers must
display to patients.
16-825 PLAINTIFF COSTS, JULY 2016, PAGE 3

Case 1:16-cv-00825-CRC Document 9 Filed 07/11/16 Page 4 of 7

•
•

Medical providers must "make available standardized written notices developed by
CMS to the Medicare FFS beneficiaries whom they serve." [FFS-Fee For Service]
CMS may supply "templates or model language for ACOs to use in marketing
materials".

Similar wording is codified at 42 CFR 425.310(c)(1) and 425.312(a). The wording
indicated that providers must offer some of the material to patients, and may offer them the rest.
The CMS denial letter, signed by Mr. Hugh Gilmore, withheld "the materials in their
entirety, under Exemption 5 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5))." The denial letter is Exhibit 2 in
Plaintiff's Declaration.
The letter made conclusory mention of civil discovery privileges, attorney-client
privilege and deliberative process privilege. It did not explain how any of these privileges applies
to information already released to the public, i.e. doctors participating in Accountable Care
Organizations, pursuant to a Final Rule. Accountable care Organizations are independent legal
entities, separate from the government (42 CFR 425.104).
The documents are not pre-decisional, since Medicare has approved them for release to
doctors in Accountable Care Organizations and to Medicare patients. The documents cannot
contain recommendations on legal or policy matters, nor personal medical information, since
their purpose is to tell patients factual information about the Accountable Care Organizations.
The two Federal Register pages cited above and referenced in the FOIA request have
numerous statements confirming the public nature of the documents, as shown in Exhibit 5, page
12, of Plaintiff's Declaration.
There was no basis for withholding, since a claim of privilege cannot apply to
information which doctors "make available" to the public.
(4B) EXCESSIVE PROCESSING TIME
A first-in first-out principle of processing FOIA requests was endorsed by Open America
v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605 at 616 (D.C. Cir. 1976).
16-825 PLAINTIFF COSTS, JULY 2016, PAGE 4

Case 1:16-cv-00825-CRC Document 9 Filed 07/11/16 Page 5 of 7

CMS had 3,383 FOIA requests pending September 30, 2013. One of them was Plaintiff's.
They received another 26,361 during the next 12 months, and processed 25,027, which could
have covered the entire 3,383 backlog (Exhibit 9, page 16, in Plaintiff's Declaration, taken from
Table V. A. of HHS Fiscal Year 2014 Freedom of Information Annual Report). However
Plaintiff's request was still pending at the end of the 12 months, and languished until 2/25/2015.
Plaintiff's request was one of the simplest, since the material sits on a CMS web portal,
readily accessible to Accountable Care Organizations and to CMS (Exhibit 6). 16,341 other
"simple requests" were indeed processed in 20 days or less during FY 2014 (Exhibit 10). All
these were received after, and processed before, Plaintiff's request.
The median time to process a simple FOIA request at CMS was 11 days in 2013, 14 days
in 2014, and 10 days in 2015; even complex requests had median response times of 2, 3 and 22
days (Exhibit 11). It was unreasonable that CMS took hundreds of days for this request, and it
was contrary to the first-in first-out principle.
(4C) NOT AN INDEPENDENT APPEAL PROCESS
HHS gave authority to resolve or delay the administrative appeal to Mr. Gilmore, the
CMS FOIA Officer who originally denied the request, while bypassing the independent HHS
offices who are responsible for administrative appeals under the law and regulations.
FOIA establishes for requesters, "the right of such person to appeal to the head of the
agency any adverse determination" (5 U.S.C. §552(a)(6)(A)(i)). HHS Rules say that HHS names
a "review official identified in the denial letter" (45 CFR 5.34(a)). The denial letter identifies
"The Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer, CMS" (Exhibit 2). HHS Rules require,
"... the designated review official will consult with the General Counsel to ensure that the
rights and interests of all parties affected by the request are protected. Also, the
concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs is required in all appeal
decisions, including those on fees. When the review official responds to an appeal, that
constitutes the Department's final action on the request..." (45 CFR 5.34(c))
16-825 PLAINTIFF COSTS, JULY 2016, PAGE 5

Case 1:16-cv-00825-CRC Document 9 Filed 07/11/16 Page 6 of 7

CMS has its own Rules at 42 CFR 401.148, which allow the Administrator to delegate
review. CMS is unreasonable if the Administrator delegates to the original deciding official.
Such delegation defeats the purpose of having an appeal.
The staff who contacted Plaintiff about resolving the appeal, and who did resolve it, were
the original deciding official, Mr. Gilmore, and his staff, not an independent reviewing official.
On January 4, 2016, while the appeal was pending, Mr. Derrick McNeal, who works for
Mr. Gilmore, called Plaintiff and said HHS policy is that only Accountable Care Organizations
have access to the written documents, so Plaintiff was not allowed to have them (Plaintiff's
Declaration paragraph 7).
As detailed in Plaintiff's Declaration paragraphs 9-10, on June 7, 2016 Mr. Gilmore and
two of his staff, Mr. McNeal and Mr. Paul Levitan, telephoned the Plaintiff with authority to
negotiate resolution of the appeal. Mr. Gilmore said he was "calling about [the] appeal" and that
he was "aware of the litigation." They said the agency could take weeks or years to release the
documents, but offered to release them in three days if Plaintiff withdrew his appeal. Plaintiff
did not do so, but they released the documents anyway the next day, with no mention of
decisions by the agency head, Deputy Administrator, General Counsel, or Assistant Secretary for
Public Affairs, who are the officials specified by law and regulation.
Plaintiff accepts the release, but believes the involvement of Mr. Gilmore and his staff in
the appeal was unreasonable, and an independent review process could have released the
documents far sooner and without need for court action.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff should not have had to pay $400 and bring this into court, in order to get 17
pages which were clearly not privileged, were not exempt from disclosure, and are important in
revealing how CMS governs information for patients about its Shared Savings Program.
