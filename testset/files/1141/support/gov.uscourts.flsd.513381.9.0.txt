PLAINTIFF’S MOTION REQUESTING AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE ORDERING
DEFENDANT TO APPEAR PURSUANT TO PLAINTIFF’S APPLICATION FOR AN
ORDER ENFORCING AN ADMINSTRATIVE SUBPOENA
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission respectfully requests the Court, pursuant
to Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(5), issue an Order to Show Cause ordering Defendant to appear and show
cause why the Commission’s January 31, 2017 subpoena should not be enforced consistent with
the relief the Commission seeks in its Application for an Order Enforcing and Administrative
Subpoena (“Application”) [D.E.1].
As set forth in greater detail in the Application, the Commission issued a subpoena to
Defendant on January 31, 2017 requesting various documents, including certain email
correspondence. However, despite the Commission’s best efforts to resolve the issue and even
after prioritizing its production requests, the Commission is still without many of the requested
materials, most notably documents definitively identifying all investors, documents relating to
sales agents’ compensation, key emails from high ranking company officials, and a privilege log.

Case 1:17-cv-22665-CMA Document 9 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2017 Page 2 of 4

Under Rule 81(a)(5), Proceedings Involving a Subpoena, the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure apply, except as otherwise provided by statute, local rule, or by court order in the
proceedings. As the Court noted in United States v. Elmes, 532 F.3d 1138, 1144 (11th Cir.
2008), summons enforcement proceedings are “most appropriate for streamlined procedures.”
(internal citation omitted); see also SEC v. McCarthy 322 F.3d 650, 655 (9th Cir. 2003)
(“summary proceedings may be conducted without formal pleadings, on short notice, [and]
without summons and complaints. . .”) (quoting New Hampshire Fire Ins. Co. v. Scanlon, 362
U.S. 404, 406 (1960)); see also First Nat’l Bank of Miami Springs, 655 F.2d 661, 663 (5th Cir.
1981) ([Rule 81(a)(3)] make[s] application of the rules of civil procedure in subpoena
enforcement proceedings discretionary with the district court”).1
The Commission filed its Application on July 17, 2017. Counsel for Defendants entered
their appearance on July 18 and 19, 2017, respectively. [D.E. 3, 4]. Counsel also acknowledged
and accepted service of the Application on July 18, 2017. [D.E. 5]. The Defendant has had
several weeks to digest the Application. The Commission thus respectfully requests the Court
exercise its authority under Rule 81(a)(5) and the applicable guiding case law, and issue an Order
to Show Cause ordering Defendant to appear to show cause why the Commission’s January 31,
2017, subpoena should not be enforced as requested.

Local Rule 7.1 Conferral
We hereby certify that we conferred with counsel for the Defendant who opposes the
relief requested herein.

The predecessor to Rule 81(a)(5) is 81(a)(3), but the change was “without substantive difference.” US v. AS
Holdings Group, LLC, 521 Fed. Appx. 405, 409, fn. 2 (6th Cir., April 3, 2013).
