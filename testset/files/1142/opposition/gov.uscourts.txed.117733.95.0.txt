PLAINTIFFS,
V.
GRACO CHILDREN’S PRODUCTS INC.,
DEFENDANT.

PLAINTIFFS’ BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
GRACO CHILDREN’S PRODUCTS INC.’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE
CERTAIN OPINIONS OF GARY WHITMAN AND WAYNE ROSS, M.D.
Plaintiffs respectfully ask the Court for an Order denying defendant Graco’s motion to
exclude certain opinions offered by experts Gary Whitman and Wayne Ross, M.D. Specifically,
Graco asks the Court to preclude Mr. Whitman and Dr. Ross from offering certain opinions
regarding the failure of the armrest on J.M.’s TurboBooster, how that failure affected his
movement during the crash (his kinematics) and the performance of his seat belt and lastly, how
that failure and J.M.’s resultant kinematics caused or contributed to cause his injuries.
Graco’s motion is not merely without merit; indeed, it strains credulity. Mr. Whitman
and Dr. Ross are eminently well-qualified experts whose opinions are predicated upon their
application and use of the scientific method, the very same methodology they employ whether
they are working on a litigation matter or a non-litigation matter. Graco is quibbling with their
conclusions, not their methodologies.

All of the opinions and conclusions offered by Mr.

Whitman and Dr. Ross, including the opinions critiqued by Graco in its motion, are relevant,
reliable and clearly pass muster under F.R.E. 702, Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 79,
113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) and Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137,
119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). Graco’s motion should be denied.

I. Pertinent Background Facts
This case arises out of an automobile accident that occurred on July 29th, 2007, on a four
lane highway. Plaintiffs’ vehicle, a 2005 Ford SportTrac, ran into the rear of a tractor that
moved off the shoulder of the road onto the highway. J.M., then four years old, was a passenger
in plaintiffs’ vehicle and was catastrophically injured in the accident.1 Plaintiffs contend that
J.M.’s child safety seat, a Graco TurboBooster, structurally failed in the accident and that this
failure, among others, caused his injuries. Everyone other than J.M. who was involved in the
accident has recovered without permanent problems. J.M. is a quadriplegic.
Two of the experts plaintiffs hired to help them prosecute this case are Mr. Whitman and
Dr. Ross. For the Court’s convenience, Mr. Whitman’s CV, Rule 26 reports and deposition are
provided herewith as Exhibits A (CV), B (report), C (supplemental report), D (deposition volume
1) and E (deposition volume 2). Similar materials for Dr. Ross are provided herewith as Exhibit
F (CV), G (report) and H (deposition).
A. Mr. Whitman and His Opinions Attacked by Graco
Mr. Whitman is an engineer and a highly qualified expert in the field of seats and
restraint systems. See Exhibit A and Exhibit B, pp. 2-5. He spent 15 years, inter alia, designing,
assessing and testing seating and restraint systems at the Naval Air Warcraft Center before he
ever began working in forensic matters. Id. Since then, and in addition to his work in cases like
this, he has been retained by and collaborated with the federal government (NHTSA) on child
occupant protection issues.2 Mr. Whitman has worked with the American Academy of Child

1

Graco gratuitously adds in its brief that J.M.’s mother was “apparently” speeding and texting when the wreck
happened. Graco adds the “apparently” to avoid running afoul of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. There isn’t any evidence to
support Graco’s efforts at assassinating the character of J.M.’s mother.

2

This stands in stark contrast to Graco’s liability “expert,” Dr. Van Arsdell, who has never been retained outside of
litigation to do non-litigation work for the government. For example, Graco’s motion mentions the “biofidelity” of
child crash test dummies. The government didn’t hire any of Graco’s “experts” to run testing to assess child dummy
biofidelity. Rather, the government hired Mr. Whitman. Which reveals all one needs to know about which party
has retained “real world” experts and which has retained “litigation” experts.

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Injury Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia – again, all on important issues pertaining to child safety seats and child occupant
protection. Id. He has authored numerous peer-reviewed papers pertaining to occupant restraint
and child safety seat related issues and he holds two patents dealing with automobile seats and
restraints. Id. The same year that Graco’s liability expert (Van Arsdell) received his doctorate
and went to work full time as a litigation engineer, Mr. Whitman was awarded the Pennsylvania
Governor’s Highway Safety Award for Occupant Protection in recognition of his lifetime of
work in the field of occupant protection.3
Mr. Whitman initially authored a fifty-one page report in this case. (Exhibit B). The
general discussion at pages 14-30 of his report is good context for the Court, but the opinions
attacked by Graco are at pages 33-34 (¶Q) and pages 42-43 (Opinion O). Id. Notwithstanding
Graco’s misrepresentations to the contrary, Mr. Whitman’s opinions at issue are predicated upon
uncontroverted eyewitness testimony, Graco’s own testing, and his reliance on the opinions of
Dr. Ross. Id. After receiving and reviewing certain testing done by the Graco’s litigation experts
for this case, Mr. Whitman issued a supplemental report. (Exhibit C).
Graco invests a lot of time and effort in its motion talking about the biofidelity of crash
test dummies. “Biofidelity” refers to the ability, or inability, of a crash test dummy to replicate
how humans respond to forces and accelerations in crashes.

See Exhibit B, pg. 3.4

Mr.

Whitman’s tests have revealed that the Hybrid III Three-Year-Old dummy is capable of
illustrating general kinematics (movement of the body), but is not sufficiently biofidelic to

3

By 1997, the year Van Arsdell received his last degree and embarked on a career in litigation, Mr. Whitman had
already spent nineteen years working as a “real world” expert in seats and restraint systems and further, had begun
to translate that “real world” expertise into some forensic work. Id. The same year (1997) Van Arsdell left
academia to become a professional witness, Mr. Whitman was lead author for an important peer reviewed paper
pertaining to child safety seats that was presented at a special international Child Occupant Protection Seminar.

4

The Court is referred to the first bullet point at the top of the page, where Mr. Whitman discusses the study of child
test dummy biofidelity he was in charge of for the federal government.

recreate a crash or accurately predict injuries in a specific crash. Id., pgs. 4 and 40. Due to the
lack of biofidelity of crash test dummies, the actual kinematics of children involved in real
crashes is far worse than what is seen in crash test videos. Id., pg. 42, ¶ H. Stiffness of the crash
test dummies decreases the potential of “rollout” in crash tests. See Exhibit C, pg. 10, ¶ 5.
B. Dr. Ross and His Opinions Attacked by Graco
Dr. Ross is perhaps the most qualified witness in this case. Dr. Ross is a medical doctor
who works as a forensic pathologist and neuropathologist. See Exhibit F.5 He is double board
certified in anatomic and forensic pathology. Id. He has investigated nearly a thousand cases in
which people suffered fatal injuries in car wrecks, including over 34 cases in which people
suffered similar injuries to those suffered by J.M. See Exhibit G, pg. 1. Dr. Ross is not limited
to working in cases in which people suffer fatal injuries. Indeed, he routinely consults with
police and district attorneys regarding people who have suffered non-fatal injuries, investigating
and explaining how and why they were injured. Id. Dr. Ross has special expertise in cases
involving children who have suffered head/neck injuries. Id.
Plaintiffs retained Dr. Ross to do what he does in criminal cases; specifically, to figure
out how and why J.M. suffered his injuries in the wreck at issue in this case. Dr. Ross employed
the scientific method. Id. at 5. He proposed five hypothetical arguments in his search for the
cause of J.M.’s injuries.

Id.

He then addressed each hypothetical.

Id., pgs. 12-24. He

investigated how it was possible that J.M., who was restrained in his TurboBooster by the
vehicle’s three point belt, had injuries from his shoulder belt across his abdomen and right arm,
and an injury from his lap belt across his pelvis. Id. at 10. For the Court’s edification, here is a
post-accident photograph of these injuries:

5

The Court is likely familiar with the fields of pathology and forensic pathology. Neuropathology is a subspecialty
of pathology that focuses on injuries to the brain and spinal cord. Dr. Ross did a rare fellowship in neuropathology
to gain unique expertise with respect to neurological injuries, like the injury J.M. suffered in this case. Id.

Shoulder Belt Injury

Lap Belt Injury

In reaching his opinions in this case, Dr. Ross looked at different restraint scenarios with
a child surrogate restrained in an exemplar TurboBooster in a exemplar vehicle. Id., pgs. 12-24.
And he studied Graco’s own testing. He found general dummy kinematics similar to what he
would expect led to J.M.’s injuries, specifically rollout and repositioning of the shoulder harness.
Id. Here are pictures from Graco’s own testing that demonstrate the rollout phenomenon and the
resulting head contact that broke J.M.’s neck:

5

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 6 of 15

Id. at pp. 19-24. As can be seen, the shoulder belt in the above photograph is a perfect match to
the shoulder belt injuries seen in J.M.’s post-accident hospital photograph. A virtually identical
match occurs in a Graco test (#7062206) where the inboard armrest flexes dramatically and
changes position nearly 3”, failing to manage the crash loads just as J.M.’s armrest did – this too
was relied upon by Dr. Ross:

Dummy rolls out from under
shoulder belt – note location
of shoulder belt is in the
precise location of J.M.’s
post-crash injury photograph

This test, with no oblique angle and a stiff dummy, shows exactly what happened to J.M. in the
crash at issue – adding the oblique angle from the subject crash, and with a real child involved
6

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 7 of 15

instead of a dummy, establishes with near certainty that the failure of the armrest to manage
crash loads creates a very hazardous condition for a child. Yet Graco’s contention is that
plaintiffs’ experts cannot rely on this test, and others like it, under Daubert. Graco is wrong.
II. Argument
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that any expert be qualified to testify by
“knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.” Fed.R.Evid. 702. Specifically, Rule 702
states:
If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact
to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as
an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education, may testify
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if
(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,
(2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and
(3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the
case.
Expert testimony must “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine
a fact in issue.” Id. It is the trial judge's responsibility to determine, at the outset, whether the
expert is proposing to testify to expert knowledge and whether such testimony will assist the trier
of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue. Id.; Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592. The trial judge
acts as a gatekeeper by requiring a valid connection to the pertinent inquiry and assessing
“whether the testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of [the relevant]
discipline.” Id.; Kumho, 526 U.S. at 149.
To constitute expert knowledge that will “assist the trier of fact,” the proposed testimony
must be both relevant and reliable. E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co., Inc. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d
549, 556 (Tex. 1996). The trial judge's role is to make the initial determination of whether an
expert's opinion is relevant and whether the methods and research upon which it is based are
reliable. Id. at 558. Relevant testimony is that which is “sufficiently tied to the facts of the case
7

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 8 of 15

that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Id. at 556 (quotation omitted). “In addition
to being relevant, the underlying scientific technique or principle must be reliable. Scientific
evidence which is not grounded ‘in the methods and procedures of science’ is no more than
‘subjective belief or unsupported speculation.’ ” Id. at 557 (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 590).
A. Mr. Whitman
Graco parses and misrepresents Mr. Whitman’s testimony throughout its brief. For
example, Graco claims Mr. Whitman had done “no testing” to support his opinions in this case.
Plaintiffs encourage the Court to read Mr. Whitman’s testimony, in which he states that he didn’t
do any testing because Graco’s own testing supported his opinions. Exhibit E, pg. 144, L. 16 pg. 146, L. 7.
Graco further claims Mr. Whitman testified that no testing to substantiate his “rollout”
opinion could be performed because of the lack of biofidelity of the crash test dummies. That
misrepresents Mr. Whitman’s testimony. Read in context, Mr. Whitman testified that he would
expect more rollout with a child than with a dummy but that there is no way to quantify the
difference because there is no relevant cadaver testing of children. Exhibit D, pg. 71, L. 7 - pg.
73, L. 2.
Notwithstanding Graco’s gamesmanship, the reality is that there is no significant
“rollout” in the frontal testing it performed (though there was some) because of the nature of the
test and the stiffness of the body of the test dummy. The wreck in this case was not a pure
frontal. It was an oblique impact to the left front of the subject vehicle of -5 to -15 degrees. See
Exhibit B, pg. 7 and Exhibit G, pg. 5. So what does Mr. Whitman actually say about rollout?
Q. But you don't know that because you haven't run a test to that; right?
A. Well, I know that that's true with adults. Physics is physics. And I already
know that with the Graco Turbo Booster that you can get rollout with the Graco
TurboBooster in a perfect frontal. And so I know from adult testing that as it's
becoming more oblique away from the shoulder belt the propensity for rollout will
8

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 9 of 15

be greater. So I know that this becoming more oblique is going to promote
rollout.
See Exhibit E, pg. 35, L. 15 - pg. 36, L. 1. That this rollout occurred in J.M.’s accident is not
only supported by Graco’s tests with the TurboBooster, it is also supported by the fact witness
testimony – testimony that Graco completely ignores. Exhibit B, pgs. 34-35.
Moreover, Mr. Whitman is entitled to rely on Graco’s testing. Indeed, there is no
requirement that an expert “personally perceive the subject of his analysis.” NutraSweet Co. v. XL Engineering Co., 227 F.3d 776, 790 (7th Cir.2000). The practice of employing experience to
analyze data assembled by others is neither illicit nor unusual. Phillips v. Raymond Corp., 364
F.Supp.2d 730, 743 (N.D.Ill.2005). Opinions drawn from observation and personal experience
are not excluded by the Daubert analysis. See Kumho, 526 U.S. at 156 ("But no one denies that
an expert might draw a conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and specialized
experience").
Finally, there is nothing illicit or improper about Mr. Whitman relying on the opinions of
Dr. Ross. “[W]hen an expert relies on the opinion of another, such reliance goes to the weight,
not to the admissibility of the expert’s opinion.” Ferrara & DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury Ins.
Co., 240 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2001) (upholding admission of expert testimony on whether marine
fire had electrical origin over similar objections, including that one expert had impermissibly
relied on observations and report of another). Accordingly, expert opinion which relies upon the
information or opinion of others is acceptable, provided it is the sort of opinion reasonably relied
on by experts in the relevant area of expertise. See Dura Automotive Sys. Of Indiana, Inc. v. CTS
Corp., 285 F.3d 609, 612-614 (7th Cir.2002). In sum, there is more than a sufficient factual basis
to deem Mr. Whitman’s opinions regarding the armrest failure and J.M.’s “rollout” both relevant
and reliable for purposes of Daubert. Graco’s motion should be denied as to Mr. Whitman.

9

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 10 of 15

B. Dr. Ross
Graco’s argument pertaining to Dr. Ross is heavy on attorney spin, but woefully bereft of
real facts or legal citations.

For example, Graco complains that Dr. Ross didn’t do any

independent testing of his own, nor is he aware of any testing done by plaintiffs’ experts for this
case. This is true, but it omits a great deal of relevant testimony that provides context to this
issue. See Exhibit H, pg. 22, L. 17 - pg. 25, L. 22.
Dr. Ross didn’t do any testing for this case because Graco had already done testing. Id.6
There was no reason to do additional testing because, to the extent it can, that testing plainly
supports the opinions of Dr. Ross. Id. Unfortunately though, the nature of the current crash test
dummies and the absence of cadaver testing with children does not allow anyone, including Dr.
Ross, to run testing that will replicate what happened to J.M. in the wreck. Id.7 And therein lies
the sophistry of Graco’s motion. What Mr. Whitman and Dr. Ross (repeatedly) explained is that
the crash test dummies are rigid and do not twist and stretch like a human body:
Of course, [J.M.] had a so much more pliable chest. His chest and abdomen are
like a pretzel, in a way, soft as a pretzel, if I can use that as an analogy or
metaphor. Especially in comparison to a six year old dummy.
Id., pg. 29, L. 2-5. So Graco’s critique of Dr. Ross (and Mr. Whitman) is that, while plenty of
testing was done that does support their opinions, the additional testing that Graco says should
have been done – testing that is not scientifically possible at the present time – was not done to
support their opinions and, therefore, their opinions should be precluded. That argument defies
logic.

6

It is interesting to note that the implication in defendant’s argument is that its own testing is not a reliable basis for
expert witness opinion testimony. Yet its own experts rely on that same testing, and Graco relies on it to support its
Motion for Summary Judgment.
7

Dr. Ross clearly testified that this problem with crash test dummy technology does not and did not prevent him
from testing his opinion. Id.. pg. 25, L. 2-10. More on that infra.

10

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 11 of 15

Even more illogical are Graco’s arguments regarding the sled tests Dr. Ross discusses in
his report. This discussion occurs in a portion of the report in which Dr. Ross investigates and
debunks whether it was possible that J.M. had his shoulder belt under his right arm when the
wreck happened. See Exhibit G, pgs. 19-22.8 Dr. Ross discusses the sled tests generally and
then focuses on tests 215 and 216. Id. Graco conveniently failed to provide the Court with the
testimony of Dr. Ross in this regard:
Q. You rely on this test for the proposition that (J.M.) can roll out of the shoulder
belt, correct?
A. I considered it, yes.
Q. And you believe in this test that the armrest came off of the Turbo Booster?
A. I don't know if the armrest came off in this test or not. But to the extent that
this shows the kinematics of what we believe illustrates happened to (J.M.).
Yes, I believe it supports my opinion. And is testing that was done by Graco
that we considered, yes.
See Exhibit H, pg. 94, L. 22 - pg. 95, L. 6. In fact, Graco is simply playing a semantics game
when it argues that none of the testing on which Dr. Ross relies involved an armrest detachment.
Again, here is the testimony of Dr. Ross that Graco failed to provide to the Court:
Q. Now, you also refer to test number 07062206 and 07062208?
A.

Right.

Q. Okay. You say that the armrest pops off early in the test. That's not true, is
it?
A. I think that's true, yes.
Q. The armrest separates from the base?
A. It looks like it pops off. I mean it doesn't come totally out. I believe, if you
look at it, it definitely pops up, pops off. And it doesn't say totally in there.
And I believe there is a three inch separation as documented in the document
there.
Q. You looked at the crash test video, correct?
8

It bears noting that Graco’s experts agree with Dr. Ross that J.M. did not have his shoulder belt under his arm.

11

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 12 of 15

A. Yes.
Q. In your view, that armrest comes off?
A. Well, not completely. But in my view, it definitely displaces upward. In that
sense, it pops off. If you look at the static aftermath of the photos, it shows
that the armrest is twisted pretty significantly and the observer documents
three inches of separation. There is some documentation that talks about
three inches of separation. So in that sense, it pops off. But it doesn't totally
come out, no.
*

*

*

Q. Is this the only test where you saw this flexing and the shoulder roll out?
A.

I think that's the only one where I see both combined. In others, I've seen,
you know, the armrest just pop off from whatever test. I don't know that I've
documented them here. But this one shows the combined effects of the rollout
and the armrest popping off or dislodging.

Id., pg. 114, L. 16 - pg. 115, L. 18; pg. 116, L. 1-8. If Graco wishes to waste the jury’s time with
a silly semantics game, that is certainly its prerogative. But quibbling over what constitutes a
separation does not create a Daubert issue.9
Graco’s penultimate argument is that the opinion of Dr. Ross that the flexing or
separation of the armrest of J.M.’s TurboBooster allowed his shoulder belt to relocate on his
abdomen should be stricken because he performed no testing “of his own” to support this
opinion. See Graco’s motion, p. 9. This ignores the fact that the opinion of Dr. Ross in this
regard is predicated upon uncontroverted eyewitness testimony, Graco’s own testing and the
scientific analysis performed by Dr. Ross of J.M.’s injuries (and his non-injuries). See Exhibit G,
pg. 12-24. Of course, there is no requirement under Daubert that Dr. Ross perform his own
independent testing to support his opinions. Indeed, Graco cites no authority in support of its
argument. Dr. Ross is entitled to rely on Graco’s own testing. See, e.g., NutraSweet Co. and
9

The Court is respectfully referred to Exhibit H, pg. 143, L. 11 through pg. 148, L. 21. In the interest of judicial
economy, plaintiffs will not reproduce the entirety of that testimony in this brief, but Dr. Ross clearly explains his
reliance on the Graco testing, the relevance thereof, the problems with trying to test to “recreate” what happened to
J.M. and how he scientifically analyzed the evidence and injuries to reach and test his opinions. Which,
parenthetically, is what he does each and every day as a forensic pathologist, irrespective of whether he is testifying
in a civil or criminal case.

12

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

Filed 06/06/11 Page 13 of 15

Phillips, supra; see also Kumho, 526 U.S. at 156 ("But no one denies that an expert might draw a
conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and specialized experience").
Furthermore, it is nonsensical to argue that a forensic pathologist must perform specific
testing intended to recreate an event to support his opinions and conclusions. Under Graco’s
logic, Dr. Ross cannot opine that someone suffered an injury when she was struck in the head by
a baseball bat unless Dr. Ross tested his hypothesis by striking someone in the head with a
baseball bat. Obviously, that is an absurd proposition. Forensic pathologists reach their opinions
and conclusions by using their education, training and experience to analyze the evidence and
injuries. That is precisely what Dr. Ross has done in this case.
Smith v. BMW North America, Inc., 308 F.3d 913 (8th Cir. 2002) is instructive. Smith was
a vehicular product liability case. The plaintiff’s theory was that, had her air bag deployed, she
would not have been injured. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the
defendant after excluding plaintiff’s experts, including a forensic pathologist. Id. at 915. The
district court excluded plaintiff’s forensic pathologist causation opinions, primarily because he
lacked expertise in biomechanical analysis. Id. at 919.10 On appeal, the Eighth Circuit held that
the exclusion of the forensic pathologist’s causation opinions was reversible error. Id. at 919-20.
The court reasoned that, irrespective of whether he was an expert in biomechanics, the forensic
pathologist had the medical knowledge, education, training and experience to opine as to how
and why the plaintiff was injured and also, to opine that a properly functioning air bag would
have prevented injury. Id.
This case presents an even more compelling justification for admission of the causation
opinions offered by Dr. Ross. As a forensic pathologist and neuropathologist, Dr. Ross has the
education, training and experience to offer medical opinions as to how and why J.M. was
10

By comparison, Dr. Ross is an expert in biomechanics, so much so that he regularly teaches biomechanics to other
engineers, other health care providers and law enforcement. See Exhibit F.

13

Case 5:09-cv-00107-DF Document 95

injured. Moreover, Dr. Ross is an expert in the field of biomechanics. Clearly, Graco’s motion
must fail as to Dr. Ross. His opinions are relevant and reliable.11
III. Conclusion
The issues raised by Graco pertaining to Mr. Whitman and Dr. Ross are simply matters
for cross examination. This Court said it best in Hadley v. Wadley Regional Medical Center,
2006 WL 5111114, *3 (E.D.Tex. 2006):
“the rejection of expert testimony is the exception rather than the rule.” See
Fed.R.Evid. 702, Adv. Comm. Notes (2000). Daubert did not work an overriding
change in federal evidence law, and “the trial court’s role as gatekeeper is not
intended to serve as a replacement for the adversary system.” See id., quoting
United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, More or Less, Situated in Leflore County,
Mississippi, 80 F.3d 1074, 1078 (5th Cir.1996). As Daubert itself recognized,
“[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful
instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of
attacking shaky but admissible evidence.”
The opinions of Mr. Whitman and Dr. Ross implicated by Graco’s motion are hardly “shaky.”
Indeed, they are predicated on a rigorous application of the scientific method and an
extraordinarily thorough review and examination of all the evidence. Mr. Whitman and Dr. Ross
are extremely well-qualified experts. The opinions they intend to offer at trial, including, but not
limited to the opinions Graco seeks to exclude, are relevant and reliable. The issues raised by
Graco in its motion, if anything, simply go to the weight of those opinions, an issue to be
measured by the jury through cross-examination. Graco’s motion should be denied.
