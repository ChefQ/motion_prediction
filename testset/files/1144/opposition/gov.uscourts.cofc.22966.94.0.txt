IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS

AVOCENT REDMOND CORP., a Washington
corporation,
Plaintiff,
v.

No. 08-69C
Judge Lawrence S. Margolis

THE UNITED STATES,
Defendant,
and
ROSE ELECTRONICS, a Texas general
partnership,
Defendant-Intervenor.

AVOCENT REDMOND’S OPPOSITION TO ROSE’S
MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS ADMITTED
OR TO COMPEL AVOCENT TO FURTHER ANSWER
Plaintiff Avocent Redmond Corp. (“Avocent”) opposes the motion of Rose Electronics to
deem its Requests to Admit to Avocent admitted.
On September 30, 2009, following a meet and confer on this issue, Avocent moved this
Court for a Protective Order relieving Avocent of any burden to further respond to the 331
Requests to Admit Rose has already served in this action and to limit the number of requests for
admit that can be served by each side to 75. Avocent opposes the present motion on the grounds
established to support its motion for a protective order and incorporates that memorandum by
reference as if more fully set forth herein. Rose is improperly using Requests to Admit as a way
to harass and burden Avocent. More specifically, many of Rose’s Requests are directed to
irrelevant subject and would require too much investigation to fully answer. Accordingly,
Avocent respectfully requests that all aspects of Rose’ present motion be denied.

A. Many Of Rose’s Requests Are Directed To Irrelvant Subject Matter
The majority of Rose’s Requests to Admit are directed to Avocent’s alleged delay in
filing suit before Rose raised 28 U.S.C. § 1498 as an affirmative defense in the related Seattle
District Court action. Because Avocent could not sue both Rose and the United States seeking
compensation on the same product sales, 28 U.S.C. § 1500, Avocent was not in the position to
sue the United States under § 1498 until Rose raised that affirmative defense in 2007, just a year
before Avocent initiated this action. Rose had the option of not raising § 1498 as an affirmative
defense in the district court litigation. In that situation, which is not uncommon, the government
supplier is responsible for its sales to the United States. Manville Sales Corp. v. Paramount
Systems, Inc., 917 F.2d 544, 555 (Fed. Cir. 1990). 1 Prior to the pleading raising § 1498 as a
defense, Avocent had no reason to believe that it needed to pursue a claim against the United
States.
By its very terms, § 1500 provides that this Court does not have jurisdiction over any
claim the plaintiff has pending in any other court against a party purporting to have acted under
the authority of the United States. Once a district court litigation is initiated against a
government supplier, § 1500 operates as an effective bar to a claim against the United States
unless and until that party pleads § 1498 as a defense for certain of its sales. Otherwise, the
plaintiff would be seeking compensation from two courts on the same sales.
When the government supplier pleads and establishes a § 1498 defense, the district court
is divested of jurisdiction to award damages for those sales, and the plaintiff must bring its claim
for unauthorized use in the Court of Federal Claims. Here, despite an earlier patent infringement
litigation between these parties in 1998 through early 1999, Rose did not raise § 1498 as an
1

The same result would occur when a defendant has pled § 1498 but not proven that
defense at trial.

affirmative defense until 2007. (See Berquist Declaration (“Berquist Decl.”), ¶ 2, Tab A (Rose’s
1998 Answer)). Thus, Avocent was not on notice that it needed to file an action in this Court
until 2007, and Avocent’s possible awareness of Rose’s sales to the United States at an earlier
time is irrelevant to any issue in this case.
B. Rose’s Requests Are Improper And Impose An Undue Burden On Avocent
Critically, and contrary to Rose’s sweeping generalization otherwise, Avocent did not
refuse to admit or deny even one of Rose’s Requests on the grounds of relevance only. Rather,
Avocent responded to even irrelevant Requests if the answer could be obtained without extensive
investigation. For example, in response to Rose’s Request No. 45, directed to whether Avocent
(and its officers, directors, employees, and agents) viewed Rose’s website in 1998, Avocent
objected to the Request as irrelevant (as explained above) but admitted that the statement was
true. Avocent was able to admit that Request because it did not require extensive investigation –
Avocent knew that its counsel had in fact viewed Rose’s website in 1998. Accordingly, Avocent
admitted that Request even though Avocent believed, and still believes, that the information
sought by that Request is irrelevant. Avocent did, however, refuse to admit or deny the Rose
Requests that were both irrelevant and required Avocent to undertake an extensive investigative
effort.
It is generally accepted by courts that a Request to Admit is not a fact discovery device.
Moldenhauer v. Tazewell-Pekin Consol. Communs. Ctr., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57058 (C.D. Ill.
2006). Instead, the purpose of requests for admission is to expedite the trial and to relieve the
parties of the cost of proving facts that will not be disputed at trial. If the truth of the facts in
question is known to the parties or can be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, they can be
eliminated as a point of contention in the case. Lakeland Ptnrs., L.L.C. v. United States, 88 Fed.

Cl. 124 (Fed. Cl. 2009). A request, like many of those served by Rose here, that requires a party
“to make an across-the-board admission” about the conduct, or knowledge, of its personnel is
improper. Ransom v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 646, 648 (Cl. Ct. 1985). This is especially true,
where, as here, the information sought by the Request is irrelevant.
Rose’s Request No. 9 demonstrates the problem:
REQUEST NO. 9:
Admit you have been aware of Rose’s GSA contract(s) since at least 1995.
RESPONSE:
Avocent objects to this request as being directed to an irrelevant subject
matter. Avocent’s infringement claim against the United States did not
mature until after Rose plead an affirmative defense under §1498. Prior to
that time, it would have been improper to pursue a claim against the United
States and Rose for the same sales. Rose did not plead the §1498 defense
until February 8, 2007. The detailed factual investigation required by this
request is thus overly burdensome given this lack of relevance.
(See Berquist Decl., Tab B (Avocent’s Responses)). The admission sought by this Request
requires information not readily available and would require Avocent to survey its corporate
records and interview its current and former employees, officers, directors and agents. That is
plainly unreasonable, especially given the Request’s lack of relevance. 2
Requests to Admit are useful tools when a party has obtained witness testimony or
identified a document which tends to establish a fact which that party would like to remove from
contention. Here though, Rose uses a string of alternately worded Requests in an effort to force
Avocent to conduct Rose’s discovery investigations for it. None of the disputed Requests are

2

The burdens associated with Rose’s Requests to Admit, and the unlimited number of
those Requests, was discussed at the parties meet and confer at which Rose refused to
acknowledge a problem or agree to a reasonable limit on the number of Requests that can be
served. That issue is the subject of Avocent’s September 30 Motion for a Protective Order and
an Order to limit the number of Requests to Admit that can be served.

premised on prior testimony or documentary evidence, and the investigative burden associated
with these Requests is too great.
Never once in the meet and confer between the parties or in the present motion has Rose
even addressed the investigative burden it seeks to impose on Avocent through its Requests for
Admission. Rather, Rose focuses exclusively on Avocent’s relevancy argument. But relevance
was only one part of Avocent’s objection, and not even the important part. Where Avocent
could admit the Request based on what it knows today, it did – even when it believed that the
admission would turn out to be irrelevant. (See e.g., Berquist Decl., Tab B, pp. 19, 21-22
(Avocent’s Response to Requests 45 and 51-52)). The real problem with Rose’s Requests is that
they attempt to impose an unreasonable discovery burden on Avocent. That is why Avocent
asked this Court for a Protective Order.
C. Rose’s Explanations Fail To Explain How
Its Requests Even Support Their Laches Theory
Request No. 9, reproduced above, demonstrates a further problem with Rose’s Requests.
Rose did not introduce a KVM with OSD (the accused product) until 1998. Thus, even
accepting Rose’s assertion that any delay should be measured from the date Avocent first knew
that Rose was selling the accused products to the United States, it is not clear how awareness of
Rose’s GSA contract in 1995 would be relevant. Similarly, it is not clear why review of various
Rose’s product catalogs before 2002, the subject of Rose’s Requests 34-41, would be relevant to
when Avocent first knew of Rose’s sales of accused products to the United States. The same
holds true of Requests 42-49 as to Avocent’s review of Rose’s website in various years, Requests
53-74 (Avocent’s participation in various tradeshows) and Requests 1-4, and 9-33. At the meet
and confer, Avocent asked Rose to explain how these questions were relevant. Rose flatly
refused to answer that question as to any of its Requests. (Berquist Decl. at ¶¶ 5-7). Even now,

Rose simply advises the Court that its inquiries are relevant because the documents at issue
“advertised Rose’s sales to the United States.” (Rose Memo., p. 6).
But Rose refused to provide that same information when asked at the meet and confer,
and even now, Rose’s statements regarding purported relevance are conclusory and
uninformative. Specifically, do any of the documents addressed by Rose’s Requests advertise
the sale of its KVM switch with OSD to the United States? As to the catalogs published before
Rose introduced the accused products, that answer to that question would, of course, be no. Rose
was not yet selling the accused products in 1995 and 1996. Thus, Rose’s 1995 and 1996 catalogs
could not advertise the sale of those products to anyone. The 1998 Rose website, which Avocent
admitted to having reviewed (see Avocent Response to Request No. 45) simply advised that
Rose sold products to the United States. It did not “advertise” the sale of what Rose describes as
its “alleged infringing products.” (Rose Memo. p. 7). 3 Even assuming that any alleged delay
should be measured from the date Avocent first knew, or should have known, that the United
States was buying Rose’s accused products, Rose has not established the relevancy of the
disputed Requests and Rose has not explained why its Requests justify the burden and expense
required to obtain an answer.
D. Conclusion
For all the above reasons, and the reasons stated in Avocent’s September 30 Motion for a
Protective Order, Avocent respectfully requests that this Court deny all aspects of Rose’s present
motion. Rose has propounded an unreasonable number of admission requests and has those used

3

Rose mistakenly refers to the products purchased by the government as “infringing
products” in order to argue that Avocent could have brought the present action at any time under
35 U.S.C. § 271. (Rose Memo. p. 7). That argument, of course, ignores the fact that
“infringement” actions against the United States are limited under § 1498 to claims for
“unauthorized” use and that such claims must be brought in this Court.

requests improperly. The investigative burden associated with responding to Rose’s numerous
Requests is oppressive. This is especially true in light of the questionable relevance of many, if
not all, of the Requests served. The better course of action would be to limit the number of
Requests each party can serve so as to limit Rose’s ability to force Avocent to needlessly expend
resources responding to irrelevant questions, discourage the use of Requests for fact discovery,
and promote the proper use of this device.
