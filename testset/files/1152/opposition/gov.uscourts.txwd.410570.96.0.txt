FULCRUM’S RESPONSE TO STRATEGIC’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE
EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
Plaintiff Fulcrum Credit Partners LLC (“Fulcrum”) responds to Defendant
Strategic Capital Resources, Inc.’s (“Strategic’s”) Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Peter
M. Lupoff. (Dkt. No. 91).
Strategic does not dispute that Peter Lupoff is a highly qualified Wall Street
executive with decades of personal experience valuing and trading bankruptcy claims. Strategic
questions only (1) Mr. Lupoff’s characterization of a document that Fulcrum indisputably sent to
Strategic in October 2009, four months before the trade in question; and (2) his detailed
explanation of why Strategic’s TOUSA claims were worth much more in the February 2010
market than the $5.3 million that Strategic quickly obtained after reneging on Fulcrum (for a net
gain of $2.9 million). (Dkt. No. 91, Exh. 1 at 11-19). Mr. Lupoff’s opinions are based on
industry standards and his years of relevant experience. Because the opinions meet the criteria
set out in Federal Rule of Evidence 702, the Court should deny Strategic’s motion.

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 96 Filed 03/28/11 Page 2 of 7

Governing Legal Standards
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides that expert testimony is admissible to
“assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue” where “(1) the
testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable
principles and methods, and (3) the [expert] witness has applied the principles and methods
reliably to the facts of the case.” FED. R. EVID. 702. Explicating from these standards, the
Supreme Court in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. instructed that trial courts must
act as “gatekeepers” for expert testimony, ensuring that such that testimony is both reliable and
relevant. 509 U.S. 579, 593-94 (1993).
This gatekeeping function, however, “is not intended to serve as a replacement for
the adversary system,” which employs “[v]igorous-cross examination, presentation of contrary
evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof [as] the traditional and appropriate
means” of attacking admissible evidence. Pipitone v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 250 (5th
Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

These traditional evidentiary

safeguards are generally more appropriate if a party merely challenges the expert’s “bases and
sources,” which only “affect the weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its admissibility.”
United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d 1074, 1077 (5th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted).
Argument
I.

Strategic’s Sole Ground for Excluding Mr. Lupoff’s Liability Opinions Is Misguided
and Already Clarified.
In October 2009, Fulcrum sent its “Standard Terms and Conditions” (Exh. 1) to

Strategic, and said, “If we come to agreement on economic terms, these terms will govern the
settlement of our transaction.” Fulcrum sent an actual Purchase and Sale Agreement (Exh. 2) to
-2-

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 96 Filed 03/28/11 Page 3 of 7

Strategic four months later, after Strategic agreed in writing to the economic terms of the deal.
Strategic now asks the Court to exclude Mr. Lupoff’s entire opinion (eleven single-spaced pages)
regarding the TOUSA claims trade for one reason: that he “mistakenly” labeled Fulcrum’s
“Standard Terms and Conditions” (Exh. 1) a “form of Purchase and Sale Agreement” in his
report. (Dkt. No. 91 at 3-4).
This argument, of course, relates to an alleged basis or source of Mr. Lupoff’s
opinion, which is generally “left for the jury’s consideration.” 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d at
1077.

But in any event, Strategic’s contention is incorrect, as Mr. Lupoff was under no

misunderstanding.
Unmentioned in Strategic’s motion is the fact that weeks ago, after Strategic
insisted that the parties should fly to New York for Mr. Lupoff’s deposition, he testified plainly
that his characterization of the Standard Terms as a “draft PSA” was based on his experience in
the claims trading industry. (Exh. 3 (Lupoff Depo.) at 54). In the claims trading industry, the
“Standard Terms and Conditions” are interpreted as a form of purchase agreement, because they
supply the “terms [that] will govern the settlement of [a] transaction” in the event that an
“agreement on economic terms” is reached. (Id. at 55). Strategic’s counsel directly questioned
Mr. Lupoff whether he had used the term “PSA” to refer to the “Standard Terms and Conditions”
document. Mr. Lupoff responded:
Q.

It’s your position though looking at your report that Fulcrum’s form of
purchase agreement was in Strategic’s possession since October 2009?

A.

Summary terms, again there may be semantics but --

Q.

[Counsel interruption] Later on you actually refer to it in your report
multiple times as a purchase and sale agreement in their possession since
October of 2009, correct?

A.

I may have said that but what I mean is the summary terms.
-3-

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 96 Filed 03/28/11 Page 4 of 7

Q.

So what you are referring to was not the purchase and sale agreement of
February 23rd but you’re referring to the standard terms and conditions for
distressed trade?

A.

Yes.

(Id. at 58-59 (emph. added)). The only uncertainty is why Strategic filed a motion on this issue,
after Mr. Lupoff explained in his deposition why he used the term that he did. He used the term
consistently with his experience in the industry, as others would use it.
Mr. Lupoff’s understanding of the facts is obvious, and it serves as the basis for
his otherwise unobjected-to opinions regarding customary bankruptcy trading practices and the
Fulcrum-Strategic trade. Should Strategic have further doubt, it will have the opportunity to revisit the issue at trial. Accordingly, Strategic’s motion to exclude Mr. Lupoff’s liability opinions
should be denied.
II.

Strategic’s Arguments to Exclude Mr. Lupoff’s Opinions on Market Value Are
Flawed and Based on Contentions Strategic Lost During the Summary Judgment
Briefing.
The Court likewise should deny Strategic’s motion to exclude Mr. Lupoff’s

opinions regarding the market value of the TOUSA claims at the time of Strategic’s breach. This
market value forms the basis of damages owed to Fulcrum.

Strategic’s objection to this

testimony as “speculative” (Dkt. No. 91 at 5) reveals only its own misunderstanding of the
measure of damages sought by Fulcrum, not any failure by Mr. Lupoff to provide relevant
opinions.
Strategic contends that Fulcrum seeks to recover only “lost profits” -- the
difference between the price Strategic offered (and confirmed, then reneged) and the price at
which “Fulcrum could have sold the TOUSA trade claims” to another buyer. (Dkt. No. 91 at 6).
Fulcrum, however, is not seeking just “lost profits,” but the difference between the purchase
-4-

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 96 Filed 03/28/11 Page 5 of 7

price from Strategic and the market value of the claims, as of February 2010. As Judge Pitman
has determined (Dkt. No. 93 at 7), this valuation does not require a showing that Fulcrum would
have sold the claims to a later purchaser. Miga v. Jensen, 96 S.W.3d 207, 216 (Tex. 2002);
Walden v. Affiliated Computer Servs., Inc., 97 S.W.3d 303, 328 (Tex. App.--Hous. [14th Dist.]
2003, pet. denied) (the proper measure of damages is “the difference between the price
contracted to be paid and the value of the article at the time when it should have been
delivered.”). Moreover, Strategic cannot force Fulcrum to confine its evidence to lost profits
alone. As Judge Pitman observed, “Strategic has pointed to no authority which holds that [lost
profits] is the only measure of value a party may proffer as evidence of damages for breach of
contract.” (Dkt. No. 93 at 7).
Given that market value can encompass more than just “lost profits,” any notion
that Mr. Lupoff’s damages model is “speculative” falls flat. Strategic wrongly criticizes Mr.
Lupoff for “ignor[ing] the only objective facts that might provide a measure of potential value:
the proposed sale of the TOUSA trade claims by Fulcrum to another buyer.” (Dkt. No. 91 at 6).
But Mr. Lupoff provided a detailed explanation, unrebutted in Strategic’s motion, on why the
market value of the TOUSA trade claims was much higher than reflected in Fulcrum’s potential
“downstream” sale, and even higher than the $2.9 million additional profit that Strategic quickly
secured last spring when it walked away from Fulcrum.1 (Dkt. No. 91, Exh. 1 at 11-12, 18-19).
Fulcrum’s ability to find a specific arbitrage or fundamental value buyer does not control or limit
Fulcrum’s proposed damage model. See Miga v. Jensen, 96 S.W.3d at 220 (“Numerous courts
have refused . . . to require a person who has been prevented from obtaining goods by the

1

Throughout its motion to strike Mr. Lupoff’s damage opinions as “hypothetical,” not once does Strategic
acknowledge that it quickly sold most of the claims at nearly three times the price that it had agreed to sell to
Fulcrum. It should not be surprising even to Strategic, who claims to be inexperienced in this area, that the claims
could have sold for higher prices.

wrongful act of another to establish a particular sale in order to recover.”) (O’Neill, J.,
dissenting).
Without evidence or explanation, Strategic resorts to bluster, dismissing as
“tortured” Mr. Lupoff’s detailed explanation of the evidence relevant to determining the market
value of the TOUSA claims. But Mr. Lupoff’s opinion contains pages of unrebutted analysis
explaining the reasons why market buyers routinely price bankruptcy claims off of the bond
market (Dkt. No. 91, Exh. 1 at 12 (citing multiple industry sources)), and that Strategic’s own
failure to find these prices was the result of its own ineffective marketing techniques, among
other reasons. (Id. at 11-19). Mr. Lupoff explained why the claims had significant market value
depending on whether they were traded on an arbitrage or fundamental value investing market,
and he confirmed with Fulcrum that it had the ability to participate in either market. (Id. at 11).
All of these matters were explored, at length, during Mr. Lupoff’s deposition.
(Exh. 3 at 114-36). Again, if Strategic has further questions, it can present them at trial.
Conclusion
Mr. Lupoff’s opinions are reliable and relevant to the issues at hand. His detailed
report reflects an accurate understanding of the facts and a reasonable basis to conclude that the
TOUSA claims had significant market value in February 2010 beyond what Strategic realized.
The Court should deny Strategic’s motion to exclude his expert testimony.
