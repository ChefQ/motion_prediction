DEFENDANT STRATEGIC CAPITAL RESOURCES~ INC.’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE
EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF
TO THE HONORABLE LEE YEAKEL, U.S.D.J.:
NOW COMES Defendant Strategic Capital Resources, inc. (hereinafter "Strategic" or
"Defendant") and files this Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Peter M. Lupoff in the abovestyled and numbered cause. In support thereof, Strategic would show the Court as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Fulcrum Credit Partners LLC (hereinafter "Fulcrum" or "Plaintiff") has
designated Wall Street hedge fund manager Peter Lupoff as its all-purpose expert in this case.
Mr. Lupoff has been designated as Fulcrum’s expert concerning both liability issues and
damages.
However accomplished as Mr. Lupoff may be as a Wall Street hedge fund manager, his
opinions as an expert witness in this cause fail to meet the reliability standards of F.R.E. 702 and
applicable law. Specifically, as set forth below, Mr. Lupoff’s opinions relating to both liability
and damages should be excluded from the trial of this case as unreliable and therefore
inadmissible.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF --PAGE 1

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 91 Filed 03/14/11 Page 2 of 9

Mr. Lupoff has opined concerning the negotiations between Strategic and Fulcrum and
whether a binding agreement existed between them to sell Strategic’s TOUSA trade claims.
However, in reaching these opinions, he proceeded from the foundational premise that Strategic
had possession of the Purchase and Sale Agreement for the proposed transaction in October
2009. This is demonstrably false as everyone (except Mr. Lupoff) concedes. The inaccuracy of
this premise taints the remainder of his opinions concerning the enforceability of the purported
agreement between Strategic and Fulc~ama. Mr. Lupoff’s opinions in this respect are therefore
both unreliable and irrelevant. They should be excluded from the trial of this cause.
Second, Mr. Lupoff has opined upon the "value" of the TOUSA trade claims that
Fulcrum sought to acquire from Strategic. Although Fulcrum has not pled it, Mr. Lupoff’s
opinion may constitute Fulcrum’s damage model at trial. However, Mr. Lupoff’s opinions in
this regard are fatally flawed in numerous respects and should be stricken. The dual scenarios
that Mr. Lupoff has manufactured are completely hypothetical and under Texas law are too
speculative to form the basis for recovery of lost profits from the failed transaction. Moreover,
even Mr. Lupoff admits that the scenarios he describes in his report are not the most likely ones
had Strategic actually sold its trade claims to Fulcrum. Rather, he admits that the most likely
outcome would have been the contemplated sale of the TOUSA claims to another fund for a
fraction of the value Mr. Lupoff ascribes to them. The models posited by Mr. Lupoff would
award Fulcrum a windfall--one much larger than the windfall that Fulcrum seeks simply
through prosecuting this lawsuit. For these reasons, Mr. Lupoff’s opinions concerning the value
of the TOUSA trade claims are both unreliable and irrelevant and they should be stricken.

II.
A.

ARGUMENT AND GROUNDS

Standard for Admissibility of Expert Testimony
The admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Fed. R. Evid. 702:
If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact
to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as
an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon
sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and
methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to
the facts of the case.
"In short, expert testimony is admissible only if it is both relevant and reliable." Pipitone

v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002). If a witness is called upon to provide an
expert opinion because the witness’s specialized knowledge may assist the jury’s understanding
of the issues, the district court is required by its gatekeeping role to ensure that the expert is
properly qualified and that the testimony is reliable. United States v. McMillan, 600 F.3d 434,
456 (5th Cir. 2010). See generally Daubert v. Merrell Dou~ Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579
(1993) (discussing the district court’s duty to ensure the reliability of expert testimony).
While there are various factors a court may consider in determining the reliability of an
expert’s opinion, "the existence of sufficient facts and a reliable methodology is in all instances
mandatory." Hathaway v. Bazany, 507 F.3d 312, 318 (5th Cir. 2007). "[W]ithout more than
credentials and a subjective opinion, an expert’s testimony that ’it is so’ is not admissible.’" Id.
(quoting Viterbo v. Dow Chem. Co., 826 F.2d 420, 424 (5th Cir.1987)).
B.

Mr. Lupoff’s Opinions Concerning the Proposed Fulcrum-Strategic "TOUSA
Trade" Should Be Excluded as Unreliable and Irrelevant
Unsurprisingly, Mr. Lupoff opines that Strategic was bound to sell its TOUSA trade

claims to Strategic pursuant to the so-called "Trade Confirmation" of February 4, 2010. See
December 8, 2010, Summary and Opinion of Peter M. Lupoff at 1. The Lupoff Report is

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF nPAGE 3

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 91 Filed 03/14/11 Page 4 of 9

attached hereto as Exhibit 1. One of the foundation premises underlying Mr. Lupoff’s opinions
is his contention that Strategic was in possession of Fulcrum’s "Purchase and Sale Agreement"
as of October 13, 2009. See Exh. 1 at 1, 8, 9, 10, 19. Indeed, Mr. Lupoff repeats this point no
fewer than nine (9) times throughout his Report. See id.
Mr. Lupoff expands upon the significance of this premise, stating:
By providing a PSA in advance, when and if the economic terms are agreed upon,
there can be greater reliance on the prospective closing as rational parties
presumably will review the PSA in advance. Therefore, a buyer/intermediary can
reliably choose to expend more time, energy and capital in the due diligence and
closing of such claims.
Exh. 1 at 8. He also notes that:
The combination of Strategic’s possession of Fulcrum’s PSA dating back to
October 13, 2009 and the nature of the discussions between parties of holdbacks
and payment of purchase price suggest that there would have been little
reasonable disagreement to the terms and conditions of a PSA.
Exh. 1 at 9. Then Mr. Lupoff includes this "fact" in each of the sections containing his
"Conclusions." Exh. 1 at 10, 19.
This premise, upon which Mr. Lupoff’s opinions are based, is demonstrably false. The
proposed Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") for the sale of the TOUSA trade claims was
first transmitted to Strategic on February 23, 2010. Mr. Hamilton, one Fulcrum’s principals,
unequivocally admitted that the PSA was transmitted to Strategic for the first and only time on
that date. See Deposition of Matthew Hamilton at 168:21-169:6. Excerpts of Deposition of
Matthew Hamilton attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
This is not a mere matter of semantics as Mr. Lupoff might now suggest. Mr. Hamilton
acknowledged that there were numerous differences between the PSA on the one hand and the
"Standard Terms and Conditions" that Fulcrum does assert were sent to Strategic in October
2009. See Exh. 2 at 153:10-165:20.

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 91 Filed 03/14/11 Page 5 of 9

An expert’s opinion may be excluded if there "is simply too great an analytical gap
between the data and the opinion proffered." Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997).
Moreover, "nothing in Rule 703 requires a court to admit an opinion based on facts that are
indisputably wrong. Even if Rule 703 will not require the exclusion of such an unfounded
opinion, general principles of relevance will." Guillory v. Domtar Industries, Inc., 95 F.3d 1320,
1331 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting Christophersen v. Allied-Signal, 939 F.2d 1106, 1114 (5th
Cir. 1991). (en bane)). "In other words, an opinion based totally on. incorrect facts will not speak
to the case at hand and hence will be irrelevant." Id.
In this instance, Mr. Lupoff’s opinions are premised upon incorrect facts and include just
this type of analytical gap. By basing his opinions upon a demonstrably false premise, his
analysis is fatally flawed and cannot meet the reliability standards of FRE 702. Indeed, they are
so flawed by this fundamental error that they are ultimately irrelevant mad therefore inadmissible.
C.

Mr. Lupoff’s Opinions Concerning Strategic’s Alleged Damages Should Be
Excluded as Unreliable---Mr. Lupoff Admits that His Damage Model does not
Reflect the Most Likely Outcome Had the Trade Occurred
Mr. Lupoff also provides opinions concerning the "value" of the subject TOUSA trade

claims, presumably as a damage model in the event of a liability finding against Strategic. See
Exh. 1 at 11-17. Mr. Lupoff’s opinions concerning the supposed value of the TOUSA trade
claims should be excluded and, in any case, areirrelevant as a measure of damages in this case
for at least two reasons.
1.

Mr. Lupoff’s Opinions Concerning the "Value" of the TOUSA Trade Claims are
Unduly Speculative

In order to recover lost profits damages under Texas law, those lost profits must be
proved with reasonable certainty. See Ramco Oil & Gas, Ltd. v. Anglo-Dutch (Tenge), L.L.C.,
207 S.W.3d 801, 808 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (citing Tex.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF --PAGE 5

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 91 Filed 03/14/11 Page 6 of 9

Instruments, Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgm’t, Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276, 279 (Tex.1994)). Evidence of
lost profits must not be uncertain or speculative. Id. Additionally, "[o]pinions or estimates of
lost profits must be based on objective facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost
profits may be ascertained." HoltAtherton Indus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Tex. 1992).
Mr. Lupoff pays lip service to the proposed trade between Fulcrum and a "downstream
buyer for a guaranteed, immediate gain" for an agreed upon price. Exh. 1 at 11. Then he tosses
this evidence aside so that he can conclude that Fulcrum’s real loss was up to eight times greater
than this proposed trade. Exh. 1 at 20.
There are numerous flaws with the methodology by which Mr. Lupoff reaches this
conclusion that render it unreliable. First and foremost, Mr. Lupoff ignores the only objective
facts that might provide a measure of potential value: the proposed sale of the TOUSA trade
claims by Fulcrum to another buyer. Mr. Lupoff does not (and cannot) direct the Court to any
real-world offer or other similar evidence that Fulcrum could have sold the TOUSA trade claims
for an amount remotely approaching the one in his report.
In a related vein, Mr. Lupoff does not refer to or cite any other offers for TOUSA trade
claims held by any other party. Assuming, arguendo, that Mr. Lupoff could find TOUSA trade
claims other than Strategic’s that were sold during the same timeframe for an amount
approaching the one that he now ascribes to Strategic’s TOUSA trade claims, they might serve as
a proxy for their value. He does not.
Instead, Mr. Lupoff engages in a tortured analysis where he first analogizes trade claims
to unsecured bonds. Exh. 1 at 12. Of course, as Mr. Lupoff admitted at deposition, the bond
market is a transparent one while trade claims are just the opposite. See Deposition of Peter M.
Lupoff at 94:18-95:24. Excerpts of Deposition of Peter M. Lupoff attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF --PAGE 6

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 91 Filed 03/14/11 Page 7 of 9

Mr. Lupoff also does not address any of the other differences between trade claims and bonds or
the relative sophistication of bond traders vis-a-vis sellers of trade claims.
Then Mr. Lupoff speculates about the amount an "arbitrage investor" or a "fundamental
value investor" might pay for trade claims. Exh. 1 at 12-13 (arbitrage investor); Exh. 1 at 14-16
(fundamental value investor). While this might be an interesting academic exercise, Mr. Lupoff
does not point to a single offer for or purchase of a TOUSA trade claims by either an arbitrage
investor or a fundamental value investor. Moreover, Mr. Lupoff appears to assume that Fulcrum
has sufficient assets to buy and hold (rather than flip) these trade claims. Again, this is a
completely hypothetical exercise. It is the worst kind of speculation because it is based upon no
objective evidence and anticipates the actions of a hypothetical buyer who may not exist.
In short, Mr. Lupoff’s opinion in this respect is utterly unreliable. Moreover, it is far too
speculative to be relevant to the recovery of lost profits under Texas law. It would only serve to
confuse and mislead the jury and should be excluded on this basis.
2.

Mr. Lupoff Admits That the Dual Scenarios Upon Which He Bases His Analysis
Were the Two Least Likely Outcomes Had Strategic. Sold the TOUSA Trade
Claims to Fulcrum

A second reason why Mr. Lupoff’s opinions concerning the value of the TOUSA trade
claims should be excluded is because even he admits that the scenarios by which he reached his
valuation (i.e., sale to an arbitrage investor and sale to a "fundamental value" investor) were the
least likely outcomes had Strategic sold its claims to Fulcrum. While Mr. Lupoff, declined to
place a percentage likelihood on each potential outcome, he was forced to admit at deposition
that the most likely scenario had Fulcrum acquired the TOUSA trade claims was the
contemplated sale to the upstream buyer. Exh. 3 at 128:13-129:21. This, as noted above, would

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF PETER M. LUPOFF --PAGE 7

Case 1:10-cv-00137-LY Document 91 Filed 03/14/11 Page 8 of 9

have been for a fraction of the amount that Mr. Lupoff hypothesizes for the other two
hypothetical buyers.
It is well established that an expert’s opinions are rendered unreliable if that expert fails
to consider or exclude alternative causes or outcomes. See Michaels v. Avitech, Inc., 202 F.3d
746, 753 (5th Cir. 2000). The inadequate treatment of other potential causes necessarily
undermines the reliability of an expert’s opinion. See Brown v. Parker-Hannifin Corp., 919 F.2d
308, 311-12 (5th Cir.1990). This is neatly summarizes one of the principal flaws with Mr.
Lupoff’s methodology in this instance concerning the value of the TOUSA trade claims. On this
basis alone, Mr. Lupoff’s opinions concerning valuation of the TOUSA trade claims are
unreliable and irrelevant. Strategic respectfully moves that they be excluded from the trial of this
cause.
III. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant Strategic Capital Resources, Inc.
prays that this Honorable Court exclude the testimony of Peter Lupoff from the trial of this
matter as requested herein and order any further relief to which Defendant may be entitled either
at law or in equity.
