Defendant.

Defendant, Daniel David Rigmaiden, appearing pro se, respectfully submits Motion

17 To Suppress All Digital Data Evidence As A Sanction For Failure To Preserve Evidence.
18 This motion depends on the facts and arguments contained in the defendant's Reply To
19 Government's Response To Motion For Discovery RE: Digital Evidence Search (hereafter
20 “Discovery Motion Reply”) (Dkt. #9??), hereby incorporated into this motion by reference
21 pursuant to LRCiv 7.1(d)(2) when referenced through LRCrim 12.1. This motion requests
22 that all digital data evidence copied from storage devices seized under the N.D.Cal.
23 warrants[1] be suppressed as an adequate sanction for the government's failure to preserve the
24 discoverable evidence the defendant could have used to support his Fourth Amendment
25 suppression arguments. See Discovery Motion Reply.
26

As explained in the numbered paragraphs below, there are three categories of

27
The warrants at issue are N.D.Cal. 08-70460-HRL/PVT (apartment No. 1122) and
28 1.
N.D.Cal. 08-70502-PVT (storage unit No. A-47).

1 evidence the government likely failed to preserve. If the government does in fact have the
2 missing evidence, the defendant is confident that the government will immediately provide it
3 to the defense and specify in its response to this motion that it has done so. Otherwise, all
4 evidence listed below was not preserved by the government and the defendant is without the
5 evidence he needs to solidify his arguments raised in his First Supplement To Motion To
6 Suppress RE: Search And Seizure Of Digital Evidence Under N.D.Cal. Warrants (Dkt. #867).
7 [2] The defendant is also without the evidence he needs to solidify his brand new Fourth
8 Amendment challenge that only came to light with the recent October 22, 2012 disclosure.[3]
9 Notwithstanding previous suppression filings (e.g., Dkt. #867), the defendant does not have

MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL DIGITAL DATA EVIDENCE
AS A SANCTION FOR FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

10 “ample evidence” to make his arguments. The success of the defendant's claim that the
11 government conducted a fishing exhibition depends on how severely all government actors
12 rummaged through the defendant's data and how much out-of-scope material was viewed.[4]
13 Given the heightened factual standard for proving a government fishing exhibition, the
14 Fourth Amendment challenges at issue here do not have an “evidence cut-off point” as the
15 Court applied to aircard locating mission challenges addressed in its order at Dkt. #723.
Based on new evidence contained in the government's October 22, 2012 disclosure,
16 2.
the defendant needs to file a second supplement to his Motion To Suppress, which will
17 update facts and arguments raised at Dkt. #867. See also Dkt. #867, p. 1, fn. No. 1.
3.
The new Fourth Amendment challenge will be raised in the defendant's second
18 supplement to his Motion To Suppress. See Dkt. #867, p. 1, fn. No. 1 (anticipating second
supplement based on government's history of belated disclosures). The newly discovered
19 Fourth Amendment violation relates to IRS-CI Agent Daun using her “human eyes” to
arbitrarily review a multitude of the defendant's files—possibly all of them—without using
20 any methods designed to “locate and expose only those categories of files, documents, or
other electronically stored information that are identified with particularity in the warrant...”
21 E.g., Submission Of Documents Related To Original Northern District Of California 0870460-HRL Search Warrant Used To Physically Search Apartment No. 1122, “Computer
22 Search Protocol For The Northern District Of California” (Dkt. #566-2, p. 17). This newly
discovered Fourth Amendment violation will be addressed in the defendant's second
23 supplement to his Motion To Suppress. However, in brief, prior to conducting a “human
eye” review, IRS-CI Agent Daun should have isolated possible in-scope data by first
24 conducting extensive keyword searches across data content and/or categorized files based on
the defendant's very descriptive and accurate file/folder labeling, as was noted by IRS-CI
25 Agent Daun in an email to FBI Agent Richard J. Murray. See Fifth Submission Of
Consolidated Exhibits Relating To Discovery And Suppression Issues, EXHIBIT 04 (Dkt.
26 #929-1, p. 21). In order to support his arguments, the defendant will seek an expert witness
having both “computer expert” and “digital forensics expert” experience.

In addition to reading the numbered paragraphs below, how the missing evidence is
helpful
to the defense is explained in the defendant's Reply To Government's Response To
28
Motion For Discovery RE: Digital Evidence Search (Dkt. #9??).

Because the government failed to preserve relevant and helpful evidence, the

2 defendant's Fourth Amendment defense is prejudiced under Rule 16, Fed. R. Crim. P.,[5] and
3 under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.[6] The government also acted in bad
4 faith.[7] The defendant therefore respectfully requests that the Court suppress all digital data
5 copied from the defendant's physical data storage devices seized from apartment No. 1122
6 and storage unit No. A-47.[8] The requested sanction is proper considering it will not result
7 in the government losing all of its evidence gathered in this case[9] and, because the sanction
8 is suppression, it will eliminate the defendant's Fourth Amendment need for the very
9 evidence the government failed to preserve. The categories of evidence the government

AS A SANCTION FOR FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE
CR08-814-PHX-DGC

10 failed to preserve are as follows:
11

1.

The government failed to preserve evidence, such as reports, logs, network

12 user account login records for “Phosvr001” and other file servers, etc., specifying precisely
13 5.
See United States v. Flyer, 633 F.3d 911, 916 (9th Cir. 2011) (“If the government
destroys evidence under circumstances that do not violate a defendant's constitutional rights,
14 the court may still impose sanctions including suppression of secondary evidence. In doing
so, the court must balance the quality of the Government's conduct and the degree of
15 prejudice to the accused. The Government bears the burden of justifying its conduct and the
defendant bears the burden of demonstrating prejudice.” (internal citations and quotation
16 marks omitted)).
See United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 (9th Cir. 2000) (“The
17 6.
suppression of material evidence helpful to the accused... on a motion to suppress, violates
process if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the
18 due
result of the proceeding would have been different.”).
There is evidence of the government acting in bad faith while failing to preserve
19 7.
evidence. First, the “Computer Search Protocol” contained in the N.D.Cal. warrants
20 required the government to (1) “complete an off-site search of a device that agents removed
in order to search for evidence of crime as promptly as practicable and no later than thirty
21 (30) calendar days after the initial execution of the warrant[,]” and (2) “locate and expose
only those categories of files, documents, or other electronically stored information that are
22 identified with particularity in the warrant...” See, e.g., Submission Of Documents Related
To Original Northern District Of California 08-70460-HRL Search Warrant Used To
23 Physically Search Apartment No. 1122, “Computer Search Protocol For The Northern
District Of California” (Dkt. #566-2, p. 16-17). The government was therefore on notice of
24 the importance of preserving evidence showing whether agents complied with the quoted
terms. Although not dispositive, there is also evidence of the prosecution concealing
25 evidence from the defendant relating to violations of the “30-day search window” during the
discovery process. See Motion Requesting Sanctions For Discovery Violations RE: Digital
26 Evidence Search (Dkt. #9??); Fifth Submission Of Consolidated Exhibits Relating To
Discovery And Suppression Issues, EXHIBIT 05 (Dkt. #929-1, p. 22).
27 8.
This request for suppression also applies to the original data and physical drives
themselves currently in the possession of the government.
28
9.
The defendant was originally indicted prior to any seizure of his digital data.

1 which government actors were provided with or had access to virtual machine clones of the
2 defendant's entire computer system—which includes private out-of-scope data. The
3 defendant's Discovery Motion Reply, Section I(A), describes what the government provided
4 via the October 22, 2012 disclosure, explains why it is insufficient, and articulates how full
5 disclosure of the missing evidence will help the defendant's Fourth Amendment arguments,
6 i.e., supporting a finding of prejudice for failure to preserve. Going by the October 22, 2012
7 disclosure, which consisted mainly of a prosecution report, the government likely failed to
8 preserve adequate logs of who had access to the defendant's private data via the virtual
9 machine clones and where that data was shared.

2.

The government failed to preserve evidence, such as reports, logs, etc.,

11 specifying precisely which government actors actually accessed, and when/where they
12 accessed, virtual machine clones of the defendant's entire computer system—which includes
13 private out-of-scope data. The defendant's Discovery Motion Reply, Section I(C), describes
14 what the government provided via the October 22, 2012 disclosure, explains why it is
15 insufficient, and articulates how full disclosure of the missing evidence will help the
16 defendant's Fourth Amendment arguments, i.e., supporting a finding of prejudice for failure
17 to preserve. Going by the October 22, 2012 disclosure, which consisted mainly of a
18 prosecution report, the government likely failed to preserve adequate logs of how many
19 times and at what dates/times each government actor accessed the defendant's private data
20 via the virtual machine clones.
21

3.

The government failed to preserve evidence, such as reports, logs, etc.,

22 specifying precisely what files government actors “looked at” using their “human eyes”
23 while searching the forensic images and virtual machine clones of the defendant's entire
24 computer system. The defendant's Discovery Motion Reply, Section I(D), describes what the
25 government provided via the October 22, 2012 disclosure, explains why it is insufficient, and
26 articulates how full disclosure of the missing evidence will help the defendant's Fourth
27 Amendment arguments,[10] i.e., supporting a finding of prejudice for failure to preserve.
