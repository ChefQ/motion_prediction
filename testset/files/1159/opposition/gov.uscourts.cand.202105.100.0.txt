Defendant CHECK RECOVERY SERVICE responds to the items of
Plaintiff’s motion as follows:
Item (1): On June 29, 2007, Plaintiff forwarded to PAUL

4

ARONS, Attorney for Plaintiffs, a list of all debtors who paid

5

interest to Defendant from December 4, 2007 to April --, 2007.

6

The list included the name, last known address and phone number,

7

check date, check amount, check payee, and check number, and the

8

date and amount of all payments of interest received by

9

Defendant. The list was sent on a C.D. in an Excel spreadsheet.

10

Therefore, no order is appropriate as Defendant has complied with

11

the request.

12

Item (2): Defendant has no objection to this item.

13

Item (3): Defendant objects to paying any of the costs

14
15

incurred in the mailing of the notice.
Item (4): Defendant has no objection to this item.

INTRODUCTION

17

1. The rule established by the United States Supreme Court
18
in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelion, (1974), 417 U.S. 156, 94 S.
19
Ct. 2140 is that Plaintiff is responsible for the costs of
20
sending notices. Plaintiff cites no appellate court case which
21
supports shifting the cost of notice to a Defendant. Furthermore,
22
the trial court opinions cited by Plaintiff involve actions in
23
which liability was based on clearly established legal precedent
24
and undisputed facts. The liability in this case is not yet
25
established and will not be established until the Court of
26
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit establishes binding precedent on
27
whether interest under C.C. 3287 and the service charge under
28
C.C. 1719 can be imposed.

2. The data Defendant is providing to Defendant shows that

2

Defendant processed 22,341 payments of interest for a total sum

3

of $260,374.76, or the sum of $11.65 per payment. The cost of

4

mailing 22,341 notices will be at least $22,341.00. If Defendant

5

is ordered to advance this sum, and eventually prevails on

6

appeal, Defendant will be left with no remedy to recover the

7

funds advanced for mailing.

8

10

3. Defendant has no funds with which to pay the notice costs
because:
a. Safeway, the primary client of Defendant, stopped

11

placing accounts with Defendant in December, 2006. This has

12

resulted in the termination of Defendants business.

13

In December, 2006, (the last month Defendant received

14

new business from Safeway) Defendant deposited a total of

15

$75,400.00 into its Client Trust Account, which included the

16

portion that belonged to the original creditor. After the

17

original creditor was paid from the Client Trust Account, the sum

18

of $23,338.00 was paid from the Client Trust Account to Defendant

19

to cover its business expenses and distribution of profits.

20

As of June 25, 2006, Defendant deposited a total of

21

$14,156.00 into its Client Trust Account, which included the

22

portion that belonged to the original creditor. After the

23

original creditor was paid from the Client Trust Account, the sum

24

of $5,358.37 was paid from the Client Trust Account to Defendant

25

to cover its business expenses. There are no profits

26

for distribution.

27
28

Therefore, Defendant has no funds with which to comply
with any order of this Court to advance costs of notice. While

1

Defendant does have a liability insurance policy to cover a

2

portion of this lawsuit, the liability insurance policy has an

3

exclusion of coverage for the portion of the claim that is based

4

on the collection of unlawful interest. Since the insurance

5

carrier does not cover this liability, the insurance carrier is

6

likewise not responsible for the cost of the notices if it is a

7

cost charged to the Defendant.

8

b. In addition, Defendant agreed with the insurance

9

carrier to assume all of the attorney fees and costs of defense

10

to enable Defendant to litigate this claim instead of settle or

11

pay it. Under this Agreement, the insurance carrier would not be

12

liable for these costs even if they were covered under the

13

policy, which they are not.

14

c. Defendant has consistently sought appellate review

15

of the liability issues in this case at the earliest possible

16

time. Plaintiff has obstructed the efforts of defendant to seek

17

appellate review at every step of this litigation.

18

d. It is unconscionable to impose a notice cost of at

19

least $22,341.00 on Defendant before liability is established and

20

binding precedent is established on the primary liability issue

21

in this case.

22

e. Defendant previously argued that Plaintiff, as a

23

bankrupt who owes nothing due to her discharge, had no standing

24

to represent the class, and that Plaintiff, who never paid any

25

interest, had no standing to be a class representative of

26

individuals who did pay interest. Since this Court previously

27

rejected these arguments, Defendant is not repeating those

28

arguments in full in this opposition. However, Defendant is again

“We find nothing in either the language or history of
Rule 23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a
preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order
to determine whether it may be maintained as a class
action. Indeed, such a procedure contravenes the Rule
by allowing a representative plaintiff to secure the
benefits of a class action without first satisfying the
requirements for it. He is thereby allowed to obtain a
determination on the merits of the claims advanced on
behalf of the class without any assurance that a class
action may be maintained. This procedure is directly
contrary to the command of subdivision (c)(1) that the
court determine whether a suit denominated a class
action may be maintained as such ‘(a)s soon as
practicable after the commencement of (the) action . .
..’ **2153 In short, we agree with Judge Wisdom's
conclusion in Miller v. Mackey International, 452 F.2d
424 (CA5 1971), where the court rejected a preliminary
inquiry into the merits of a proposed class action: ‘In
determining the propriety of a class action, the
question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs
have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the
merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23
are met.’ Id., at 427.
Additionally, we might note that a preliminary
determination of the merits may result in substantial
prejudice to a defendant, since of necessity it is not
accompanied by the traditional rules and procedures
applicable to civil trials. The court's tentative
findings, made in the absence of established
safeguards, may color the subsequent proceedings and
place an unfair burden on the defendant.

22
23
24
25
26
27

In the absence of any support under Rule 23,
petitioner's effort to impose the cost of notice on
respondents must fail. The usual rule is that a
plaintiff must initially bear the cost of notice to the
class. The exceptions cited by the District Court
related to situations where a fiduciary duty
pre-existed between the plaintiff and defendant, as in
a shareholder derivative suit. Where, as here, the
relationship between the parties is truly adversary,
the plaintiff must pay for the cost of notice as part
of the ordinary burden of financing his own suit.

Petitioner has consistently maintained, however, that
he will not bear the cost of notice under subdivision
(c)(2) to members of the class as defined in his
original complaint. See 479 F.2d, at 1008; 52 F.R.D.,
at 269. We therefore remand the cause with instructions
to dismiss the class action as so defined.

Eisen vs. Carlisle & Jacquelin, (1974),
417 U.S. 156, 177-178, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 2152-2153
The United States Supreme Court held that, in a true

7

adversary proceeding, F.R.C.P. Rule 23 requires that the costs of

8

notice be paid by Plaintiff. The United States Supreme Court made

9

no exception to this rule if liability was established. If

10

Plaintiff does not pay the costs, the portion of the class action

11

requiring notice must be dismissed.

12

Plaintiff cites NO binding precedent from any Circuit Court

13

of Appeal to support his argument that the defendant can be

14

ordered to pay notice costs after liability has been established.

15

Plaintiff’s authority consists of several trial court decisions

16

imposing costs after liability has been established. However, in

17

each of these cases, the decision imposing liability was based on

18

the resolution of the underlying facts by the trial court. None

19

of these cases involved an interpretation of the law when no

20

binding precedent was available and the defendant consistently

21

expressed a desire to obtain appellate review to establish

22

binding precedent.

23

For example, in the case of Six Mexican Workers vs. Arizona

24

Citrus Growers, (1986), 641 F. Supp 259, the Trial Court found

25

that the defendants intentionally violated the Farm Labor

26

Contractor Registration Act, a factual finding. Defendants did

27

not claim that the law did not apply; they claimed that they did

28

not violate it. Defendants then conceded that the finding of

1

facts by the trial court did effectively resolve all liability

2

issues.

3

In the case of Kyriazi vs. Western Electric Co., (1979),

4

465 F. Supp 1141, the Court found that the Defendant had

5

discriminated against its female employees and applicants for

6

employment, a factual finding. Again, defendants did not claim

7

that the law did not apply; they claimed that they did not

8

violate it. Defendants also conceded that the finding of facts by

9

the trial court did effectively resolve all liability issues.

10

In the case of Meadows vs. Ford Motor Co., (1973), 62 F.R.D.

11

98 (1973), the Court also found that the Defendant had

12

discriminated against its female employees and applicants for

13

employment, a factual finding. Again, defendants did not claim

14

that the law did not apply; they claimed that they did not

15

violate it. Defendants also conceded that the finding of facts by

16

the trial court did effectively resolve all liability issues.

17

In the case of Barefield vs. Chevron, U.S.A., (1988), 12.

18

Fed. R. Service 3d 1232, the only Northern District of California

19

case cited by Plaintiff, the issue of notice costs is not even

20

addressed in the opinion.

21

This is a very important distinction. The standard of review

22

on an appeal of findings of fact is whether the trier of fact

23

engaged in a clear abuse of discretion. The standard of review on

24

an appeal of an issue of law is a de novo review. The appellate

25

court reaches its own, independent decision and is not bound by

26

the determinations of law by the trial court. Thus, the

27

likelihood that an appellant will prevail on an appeal of a

28

determination of law is significantly greater than the likelihood

________________________________________________________________

Page 8 of 11

1

that an appellant will prevail on an issue of law because the

2

extent of review of a legal issue is significantly greater.

3

There are no issues of fact in this case, and the appeal in

4

this case will be based solely on the determination of an issue

5

of law. Therefore, Defendant submits liability will not be

6

established until the central issue of law has been determined by

7

the appellate court. Therefore, there is no legal authority to

8

require the defendant to pay the notice costs, The notice costs

9

must either be paid by Plaintiff or the portion of the class

10

requiring a notice must be dismissed.

11

III
IT IS INEQUITABLE TO ORDER THE PLAINTIFF TO PAY THE NOTICE COSTS
BEFORE THE APPEALS COURT DETERMINES LIABILITY

12
13

The data Defendant is providing to Defendant under Item (1)

14

shows that Defendant processed 22,341 payments of interest for a

15

total sum of $260,374.76, or the sum of $11.65 per payment. The

16

cost of mailing 22,341 notices will be at least $22,341.00. If

17

Defendant is ordered to advance this sum, and eventually prevails

18

on appeal, Defendant will be left with no remedy to recover the

19

funds advanced for mailing. This is why the Court ha no

20

jurisdiction under Eisen vs. Carlisle & Jacquelin, (1974),

21

417 U.S. 156, 177-178, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 2152-2153 to order the

22

defendant to pay the notice costs.

23

More importantly, the Declaration of Clark Garen establishes

24

that Defendant has no funds with which to pay the notice costs,

25

and that the insurance carrier is not liable for

26

the payment of these costs if they are ordered to be paid by

27

Defendant as an element of Defendants costs. Of course, if the

28

costs are awarded to Plaintiff as an element of costs awarded to

Plaintiff, the insurance carrier may be liable for the cost

2

expense.

IV
THIS COURT CANNOT ENFORCE AN ORDER THAT THE DEFENDANT PAY THE
NOTICE COSTS, AND SUCH AN ORDER WILL LEAVE THIS CASE IN LIMBO
Should this Court enter a judgment or order requiring

6

Defendant to pay the notice costs, such a judgment or order is

7

just a civil judgment that will be unenforceable. Once judgment

8

is entered, the judgment must be levied against assets or cash

9

flow to be enforced. Furthermore, Defendant will have an

10

obligation to notify its clients (Safeway) that this order or

11

judgment has rendered Defendant insolvent. Defendant suspects

12

that the clients will then re-call all of their accounts, which

13

will effectively put Defendant completely out of business. This

14

will result in no assets that any judgment or order this Court

15

can be levied upon, and a legal action that will be in limbo

16

because the required Rule 23 notices cannot be issued.
V
APPELLATE REVIEW

17
18

From the outset, Defendant has sought appellate review of
19
the interest issue which is the sole basis for liability.
20
Defendant has sought appellate review at every stage of these
21
proceedings, and Plaintiff has consistently sought to avoid and
22
delay appellate review.
23
Plaintiff now seeks this order imposing notice costs on
24
Defendant in an effort to keep Defendant from seeking appellate
25
review. This is not a proper reason for ordering a defendant to
26
pay for the costs of class notice.

VI
IT IS UNFAIR AND UNCONSCIONABLE TO ORDER DEFENDANT TO PAY NOTICE
COSTS BEFORE LIABILITY IS ESTABLISHED BY APPELLATE REVIEW
Defendant received 22,341 payments of interest, which will

4

require 22,341 notices. Since the cost of postage is now 41

5

cents, the cost of mailing will be at least $1.00 per notice, or

6

$22,341.00. It is unconscionable to impose this liability on

7

Defendant before liability is established by the Court of

8

Appeals.

9

VII
PLAINTIFF HAS NO STANDING TO REPRESENT THE CLASS

10
The parties have extensively briefed and argued the standing
11
of Plaintiff to both represent the class because she is bankrupt
12
and to represent those who actually paid interest because
13
Plaintiff did not pay any interest.
14
Defendant incorporates each of those arguments, which the
15
Court is already quite familiar with, in opposition to this
16
motion so that those issues are preserved in the event an appeal
17
of an order to pay notice costs is filed. Defendant is prepared
18
to further brief the standing issues if the Court wishes to
19
reconsider its ruling on standing.
20
VII
CONCLUSION

21
22

The motion to require the Defendant to bear any of the costs

23

of the class notice to class members must be denied.
