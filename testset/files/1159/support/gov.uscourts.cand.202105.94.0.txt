Case No. 05-04993 MJJ
Case No. 06-02037 MJJ

Plaintiffs,

CLASS ACTION

vs.

NOTICE THAT A CLASS ACTION HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO BENEFIT YOU AND IS PENDING IN
THE FEDERAL COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO

IMPERIAL MERCHANT SERVICES, d/b/a
CHECK RECOVERY SYSTEMS,
Defendants.

-- YOU ARE NOT BEING SUED -A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO BENEFIT YOU HAS BEEN
FILED IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN SAN
FRANCISCO
Why Did I Get This Notice?
A class action lawsuit has been brought on your behalf against IMPERIAL MERCHANT
SERVICES, d/b/a CHECK RECOVERY SYSTEMS (Imperial). Imperial’s records show that
between December 6, 2004 and June ___, 2007 Imperial sent you at least one form collection
letter in an attempt to collect a dishonored check written in California. The letter included a
demand for interest on the dishonored check.
This notice summarizes the lawsuit, your rights, and additional information you need to
know.

What Is This Lawsuit About?
Imperial is a debt collector. Imperial sent plaintiffs Brandy Hunt and Brian Castillo form
letters in which it attempted to collect both interest and a $25.00 service charge on a
dishonored check. Both plaintiffs sued Imperial for violating the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act. They allege that California law does not permit a debt collector to assess both
interest and a statutory service charge on a dishonored check.

What Is A Class Action and Who Is Involved?
In a class action lawsuit, one or more people called “Class Representatives” (in this case,
Brandy Hunt and Brian Castillo) sue on behalf of other people who have similar claims. The
people together are called a “Class” or “Class Members.” Ms. Hunt, Mr. Castillo, and all the
Class Members are called the Plaintiffs. The company they sued (Imperial) is called the
defendant. One court resolves the issues for everyone in the Class—except for those people
who choose to exclude themselves from the Class.
In this case, the Court has ruled that this lawsuit may proceed as a class action for:
Hunt v. Imperial, Class Notice www.imperialclassaction.com 1-555-555-5555

EXHIBIT 1

Case 4:05-cv-04993-SBA

Document 94

Filed 06/19/2007

Page 5 of 6

All persons to whom Defendant mailed a collection demand at any time since
December 5, 2004, (1) which included a demand for both interest and a statutory
service charge on a dishonored check; (2) where the check was written in the State
of California for personal, family or household purposes; and (3) whose mail was
not returned as undeliverable.
How Will I Be Affected By This Lawsuit
The plaintiff is asking the Court to order defendant to repay each class member any interest
charges that he or she paid, and to also order defendants to pay “statutory damages.” If the
plaintiff is successful, you will receive the payments that the Court orders. If the plaintiff is
not successful, you will receive nothing.
What Happens If I Do Nothing At All?
You are already a member of the Class. You have the right to remain a Class Member or to
exclude yourself from this lawsuit. You must decide this now. If you want to be included as
a Class Member and keep the possibility of receiving money or benefits from this lawsuit,
you do not have to do anything. By doing nothing, you are staying in the Class. All the
rulings made by the Court will apply to you, and any settlement between the parties will
include you, unless you are notified otherwise. If you remain a Class Member, you may
contact Class Counsel to tell them about any demands you received from the defendant and
to ask questions about this lawsuit. If you move or change your mailing address you
should notify Class Counsel so that they can let you know of any settlement and/or send
you any benefits that result from the lawsuit.
Why Would I Want to Be Excluded From This Lawsuit?
You may not want to be part of this lawsuit, for example, because you do not believe the
defendant did anything wrong, or you want to file your own lawsuit against the defendant,
or because you do not want to share in any funds that are recovered. If you want to start
your own lawsuit against the defendant, you should consult an attorney soon, because your
claims are subject to a statute of limitations.
If you exclude yourself from the Class, you will have no further role to play in this lawsuit.
For example, you will not be able to participate in hearings or object to the terms of any
settlement. If you exclude yourself, you will have the right to bring an individual lawsuit
against the defendant, if you bring it within the time allowed by law. If you bring your own
lawsuit against the defendant and win, you might recover a larger amount of money than
you may receive under this class action.

How Do I Ask the Court to Exclude Me?
If you do not want to be part of this suit, you must write to Class Counsel, P.O. Box XXX,
Anytown, USA 99999 and clearly state your request to be excluded with a statement like :

Do I Have A Lawyer In This Case?

Friday Harbor, WA, Irving Berg, San Francisco, CA and Ronald Wilcox, San Jose, CA..
Together, these lawyers are called “Class Counsel.” They are experienced in handling similar
cases.

Court either from the defendant or from money that is recovered from the defendant. You
will not personally have to pay any fees, costs or expenses of this lawsuit. However,
attorney’s fees, litigation costs and expenses may be awarded to Class Counsel by the
Court out of any recovery made on your behalf in this lawsuit.
