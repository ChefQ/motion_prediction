MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
APPROVAL OF CLASS NOTICE PLAN
Date: July 24, 2007
Time: 9:30 a.m.
Courtroom 11

21

I. INTRODUCTION
22

In this action, plaintiffs have challenged defendant’s practice of assessing
23
24
25

both interest, and a statutory service charge when collecting dishonored checks. On
March 21, 2007, this Court both granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification,

26

certifying a class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) and (3), and granted plaintiffs’

27

motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that defendant violated the Fair Debt

Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692, et seq., [FDCPA] by collecting and
2
3

attempting to collect, interest.
Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B), “the best notice practicable under

4
5

the circumstances” must be given to all Rule 23(b)(3) class members. The parties have

6

met and conferred and resolved all class notice issues, except for one. Where, as here,

7

the defendants have already been found liable, defendants should bear the cost of

8

giving notice to the class. Defendant disagrees.
Therefore, plaintiffs are filing this motion in which they will ask the Court to

9
10

approve the notice plan to which the parties have agreed, and to order defendants to

11

pay the costs of notice.

II.

THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON THE BEST NOTICE PRACTICABLE UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
A. Form of Notice
Where a class has been certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) the class

16

notice must advise class members of the nature of the action; the definition of the class

17

and any subclasses; the claims, issues, and defenses for which the class has been

18

certified; the right of a potential class member to be excluded or to opt out from the

19

class; the right of a class member to enter an appearance by counsel; and the binding

20

effect of a class judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(b).

21

Sufficient information about the case should be provided to enable class

22

members to make an informed decision about their participation. The notice should

23

describe succinctly the positions of the parties; identify the opposing parties, class

24
25

representatives, and counsel; describe the relief sought; and explain any risks and
benefits of retaining class membership and opting out, while emphasizing that the court

4th, § 21.311, p. 289.
The notice that plaintiffs propose meets these requirements.1 Defendant
has agreed to this form of notice.
B. Plan for Distributing Notice
Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(2)(B) “the court must direct to class members the

8

best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all

9

members who can be identified through reasonable effort.” In this case, defendants

10

have the name and an address for each class member. Plaintiffs propose to update

11

and standardize addresses using the United States Postal Service’s National Change of

12

Address Database, [NCOA] linked with other commercially-available products to provide

13

the most current and accurate addresses for class members, at a nominal cost. Mailing

14
15
16

will be by first-class mail, with address correction requested, which will assure that the
mailing is sent to all class members who can be located through a reasonable effort.
The Court certified as a Rule 23(b)(2) class for those class members who

17

did not pay any portion of the statutory service charge The Rule 23(b)(3) class includes
18

only those who are entitled to actual damages. Therefore, notice will only be sent to
19

class members who are entitled to actual damages, i.e. class members who paid
20
21
22

interest in addition to the check amount plus a statutory service charge.2
Defendant agrees to this notice mailing plan.

23
24

27

1. A copy of the proposed notice is attached as Exhibit 1 to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Approval of Class
Notice Plan.
2. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to clarify or correct the class definition, to accurately reflect that Rule
23(b)(3) class members are those who paid both a statutory service charge and some amount of interest,
and who will therefore be entitled to actual damages.

DEFENDANT SHOULD BE ORDERED TO PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY
TO MAIL NOTICE
The backbone of defendant’s collection operation is its computerized

4

database. The database contains information identifying all class members, the checks

5

that defendant sought to collect, and the payments that class members made.

6

Defendant has informally agreed to provide the information that plaintiff has requested

7

to identify class members and to calculate damages, but defendant has not yet provided

8

any data. Plaintiffs believe, simply to avoid any undue delay, that it would be prudent to

9

obtain a court order compelling defendant to produce the computerized data needed to

10
11
12

effectuate the notice plan, and to calculate damages. Accordingly, plaintiffs request an
order compelling defendants to provide a list of all members of the class certified by this
Court in the Order entered on March 21, 2007. The list shall include each class

13

member’s last known address and phone number, and for each check that defendant
14

sough to collect, the check date, check amount, check payee and check number, and
15

date and amount of all payments received. The data should be provided in a
16
17
18
19
20
21
22

computerized format agreed upon by the parties, no later than two weeks from the date
this motion is decided.3
IV. DEFENDANT SHOULD BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COST OF CLASS NOTICE,
SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUND LIABLE FOR VIOLATING THE FDCPA
The Supreme Court has held that “The usual rule is that the plaintiff must
initially bear the cost of notice to the class.” Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, et al., 417
U.S. 156, 178, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974). However, “interim litigation costs,

23

including class notice costs, may be shifted to defendant after plaintiff's showing of
24
25
26
27
28

3. Plaintiffs first formally requested this data in a March 25, 2007 letter. See Declaration of Paul
Arons in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Approval of Class Notice Plan. Thus, defendants have already
had several months to compile this information.

some success on the merits, whether by preliminary injunction, partial summary
2
3
4

judgment, or other procedure.” Conte & Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 8.6 at
180 (4th Ed. 2002).
Class notice costs should be shifted to the defendant where, as here,

5
6

defendant’s liability has already been established. In Meadows v. Ford Motor Co., 62

7

F.R.D. 98, 101-102 (W.D.Ky. 1973), the court ordered defendants to pay notice costs

8

after the court had certified the class and determined that plaintiffs were entitled to

9

relief. The court noted that although the general rule required the cost of notice be to

10

initially borne by plaintiff, this was because class notice usually took place during the

11

early stages of the litigation. In Meadows, however, the class was certified at a time

12

when the Court has already determined that the plaintiff and the members of her class

13

were entitled to recover on their demands for injunctive relief. Therefore, the expense of

14

sending the class action notices had to be paid by the defendant.

15
16
17
18

In Kyriazi v. Western Electric Co., 465 F.Supp. 1141, 1144 (D.N.J. 1979).
the litigation was bifurcated into a liability stage and a damages stage. Id. At the
conclusion of the liability stage, the court found that the employer had unlawfully
discriminated against its female employee class members. Id. at 1141. During the

19

damage phase of the trial, the court ordered that all class members were to be mailed a
20

notice and a proof of claim form, and that defendant had to bear the notice costs. Id. at
21

1144.
22
23
24

In this circuit, the Arizona district court followed the holdings in Meadows
and Kyriazi and ordered defendants to pay the cost of notice partly because defendants'

25

liability had already been established. Six (6) Mexican Workers v. Arizona Citrus

26

Growers, 641 F.Supp. 259, 265 (D. AZ 1986). For similar rulings see Hook v. Baker,

27

2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26698, *7 (S.D.Ohio 2004); Marcarz v. Transworld Systems,

Catlett v. Missouri Highway and Transportation Comm’n., 589 F.Supp. 949 (W.D.Mo.
1984).
Here, as in the cases cited above, defendant’s liability has been

6
7

established and the only questions remaining are identifying class members and

8

calculating actual and statutory damages. Accordingly, the costs of notice should be

9

borne by defendants. Once defendants have provided plaintiffs with information

10

sufficient to determine approximately how many notices will be mailed, plaintiffs will

11

submit a cost estimate to defendants. If defendants dispute the estimate, the parties

12

shall meet and confer to resolve any dispute. If they are unable to do so, plaintiffs shall

13

file a motion to establish the amount that defendants are required to advance for costs

14

of notice.

V. CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, plaintiffs Hunt and Castillo respectfully request that their
motion be granted, and that the Court approve the class notice proposal set forth above.
