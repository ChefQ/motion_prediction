MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA
NOW COMES John Doe, alleged user of I.P. Address 66.30.115.104,
and for his Motion to Quash the Subpoena issued to Comcast Corp.

("Comcast") dated May 11, 2011, states as follows:

1. John Doe, as alleged user of I.P. Address 66.30.115.104,
requests that the Court quash the subpoena pursuant by the Plaintiff
to order Comcast to supply personally identifiable information related

to the I.P. Address aforementioned.

2. Plaintiff's subpoena should be quashed because it requires
the Keeper of Records of Comcast, located in Moorestown, New Jersey,
to produce documents at the office of Plaintiff's counsel in Amesbury,

Massachusetts, which is more than 100 miles away.
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 12 Filed 06/17/11 Page 2 of 4

3. Plaintiff's subpoena should be quashed because it does not
contain any specific information about the claimed copyrighted work,
for example file name, file type and/or file size, nor the method of
infringement, for example peer-to-peer networking and/or direct file
transfer, with regards to the allegedly uploaded and/or downloaded
movie using a computer assigned the I.P. Address 66.30.115.104 on
11/15/2010 19:55:10 UTC, per the paperwork and spreadsheet information

submitted to Comcast and in-turn to John Doe.

4, Plaintiff's subpoena to Comcast also does not provide
information on the amount of data shared and/or the duration of the
data shared on the internet. Therefore it is plausible that John Doe
inadvertently clicked on a link which started the alleged copyright
movie download and/or upload for a split-second, thereby not
downloading and/or uploading 100% or 50% or even a full 1% of the

movie being claimed by the Plaintiff as their copyrighted work.

5. Plaintiff's subpoena also fails to state the validity of
gathered information on John Doe, as represented in the supplied and
alleged evidence submitted in form of a list of I.P. Addresses to
Comcast, which in-turn was submitted to John Doe. Therefore it is
plausible that Plaintiff cannot guarantee with 100% accuracy, the
validity of the I.P. Address of John Doe submitted to Comcast, and the
Plaintiff also fails to detail the validity of how they gathered this

I.P. Address.
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 12 Filed 06/17/11 Page 3 of 4

6. Notice of Plaintiff's subpoena also was improperly served
by Comcast. As instructed in the Order Granting Plaintiff's Emergency
Ex-Parte Motion for Early Discovery, the ISP is to distribute a copy
of the Notice within seven days of the service of the subpoena. John
Doe was sent notice of the Rule 45 subpoena on June 3, 2011, which is
23 days after the subpoena date of May 11, 2011, meaning Comcast
responded much later than the seven days instructed in the court
order. The 21 days allowed for the Doe defendant consequently exceeds
the subpoena deadline of June 8, 2011, resulting in a subpoena that
fails to allow a reasonable time to comply. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

P. 45(c) (3) (A) (1), this is sufficient cause to quash a subpoena.

7. John Doe would also bring to the Court's attention the
prevalence of computer hackers and their ability to copy or spoof I.P.
Addresses and Media Access Controller addresses thereby falsely
assuming John Does internet identity and/or hijacking his computer
without John Doe's knowledge. John Doe does submit to having wireless
security enabled on his personal home network, but cannot guarantee

its unauthorized use and/or hacking thereof.

8. John Doe would finally like to point to the memorandum
opinion of CP Productions, Inc. v. DOES 1-300 No. 10 C 6255 (2011),
which dismisses a similar case on the grounds that suits pursuing
individual, independent instances of copyright infringement should be

filed separately, and should not be allowed to be filed on a wholesale
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 12 Filed 06/17/11 Page 4 of 4

basis. Such allowances could lead to possible abuse, including mass--

litigation as a strategy to monetize infringement.

WHEREFORE, movant prays that the Court grant him motion to quash

subpoena.
