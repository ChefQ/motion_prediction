DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
REGARDING RELATOR'S CLAIM FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES

Defendants, Valley Baptist Health System ("VBHS") and Valley Baptist Medical Center
(""VBMC") (collectively, "Valley Baptist"), file this Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
Regarding Relator's Claim for Certain Damages ("Motion") and in support thereof would show
the Court as follows:

IL SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

1. This Motion seeks a judgment from this Court as to the damages that Relator,
Michael N. Swetnam, Jr. (""Swetnam" or "Relator"), may recover under the False Claims Act
("FCA") and for unjust enrichment as a matter of law.' Here, Swetnam seeks the following
damages:

e Statutory civil penalties ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 for each FCA violation;

e Disgorgement of reimbursements Valley Baptist received from Medicare and
Medicaid for medical services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients; and

e Unjust enrichment measured by the "additional" Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursements realized by Valley Baptist due to an increase in the number of
physicians practicing as staff physicians at the hospital.

Case 1:08-cv-00446 Document 95 Filed in TXSD on 05/30/14 Page 2 of 18

For the reasons set forth below, and assuming Valley Baptist violated the FCA,' the only
recoverable damages that Swetnam would be entitled to recover in this action is the statutory
civil penalty for violations that occurred during the applicable limitations period. Accordingly,
Valley Baptist seeks partial summary judgment on this ground.

Il. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND

2. This Motion presents a pure question of law-i.e., recoverable damages under the
FCA and for unjust enrichment-and does not ask or require the Court to make any factual
conclusions. Nevertheless, a brief summary of the background and undisputed facts may be
helpful in the Court's consideration of the legal issues presented.'

3. On October 9, 2008, Swetnam filed this FCA qui tam action in the wake of Valley
Baptist discovering and reporting to the Texas Department of Insurance that Swetnam was and
had been involved in an insurance fraud scheme for several years by which Swetnam (i) charged
Valley Baptist for premiums on general liability and windstorm insurance policies that did not
exist, and (ii) otherwise altered premiums to be paid by Valley Baptist on such insurance policies
that did exist. Swetnam was ultimately indicted for his conduct, and on May 3, 2010, a jury
found him guilty on three counts of mail fraud. United States District Judge Keith Ellison
sentenced Swetnam to thirty-seven (37) months in federal prison and ordered Swetnam pay
Valley Baptist almost $3,000,000 in restitution for his involvement in the insurance fraud

scheme.*

 

* Valley Baptist expressly reserves the right to file additional motions for summary judgment in accordance with
this Court's Amended Scheduling Order.

* Having already ruled on Valley Baptist's earlier filed motions for summary judgment with respect to some of
Swetnam's claims, this Court is familiar with the facts that gave rise to this lawsuit. Valley Baptist incorporates the
facts included in its previous motions for summary judgment as if set forth herein and refers the Court to that
Motion for a further recitation of the facts. See Doc. 70.

" The insurance fraud scheme that resulted in Swetnam being incarcerated is unrelated to the malpractice insurance
subsidy program at issue in this lawsuit.

4. During the same time that Swetnam was being investigated for his criminal
involvement in the insurance fraud scheme, the Department of Justice was investigating
Swetnam's allegations in this gui tam action. The sole basis of Swetnam's claim is that Valley
Baptist used a medical malpractice insurance program-the XOL Program that Swetnam created
in 1993 and administered for Valley Baptist until it was terminated in 2002-to knowingly and
intentionally induce patient referrals to Valley Baptist in violation of the Stark Law,0x00B0 the Anti-
Kickback Statute ("AKS")0x00B0 and the FCA. After the Department of Justice completed its lengthy
investigation of Swetnam's claims, the government declined to intervene in Swetnam's qui tam
action.

5. From the time the XOL Program was implemented in 1993 and until the time it
was terminated in 2002, Swetnam supported and defended the XOL Program.' Remarkably,
Swetnam now claims that the XOL Program violated certain federal laws, including the Stark
Law, the AKS, and the FCA. Through this lawsuit, Swetnam asks this Court (i) to enter statutory
civil penalties of hundreds of millions of dollars in his favor, (ii) to disgorge Valley Baptist of
the hundreds of millions of dollars that the government reimbursed Valley Baptist for providing
medical services to the Rio Grande Valley's elderly and low income residents, and (iii) to award
him in excess of six million dollars based on alleged unjust enrichment damages.

6. Other than Valley Baptist's use of Swetnam's XOL Program, Swetnam does not
allege any wrong doing on Valley Baptist's part. That is, Swetnam does not dispute that Valley
Baptist actually provided the medical services that the government reimbursed, that the medical
services provided were billed to Medicare and Medicaid at the appropriate amounts, and that the

medical services Valley Baptist provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients were necessary.

documents will be hand delivered to the Court with a courtesy copy to Mr. Swetnam's counsel.

7. This Court previously granted summary judgment in Valley Baptist's favor on
Swetnam's claims under the Stark Law.(R) This Court also granted summary judgment as to any
FCA claims that would have arisen prior to October 9, 2002." As such, the applicable damages
period, if any, would only be for the period from October 9, 2002 until April 15, 2003-the date
the XOL Program was terminated.'? Swetnam requested, and Valley Baptist agreed that, this
Court should address by a motion for partial summary the recoverable damages that Swetnam
may seek from Valley Baptist should the fact finder determine that Valley Baptist violated the
FCA.'! Because there are no material factual issues and the question before the Court is strictly
one of statutory interpretation, this motion can be decided as a matter of law.

8. As a matter of law, this Court should enter judgment that the damages sought by
Swetnam are not recoverable. First, the civil penalty is not calculated on every reimbursement
request as Swetnam alleges. Rather, if it is awarded, the civil penalty should be calculated only
on each annual cost report that is shown to be false in violation of the FCA. Second, damages
and disgorgement are different remedies that are measured differently. Third, the False Claims
Act does not grant qui tam relators the remedy of disgorgement. Moreover, disgorgement of all
funds the government paid to Valley Baptist violates the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines
Clause because it is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of Valley Baptist's allegedly
improper act-i.e., using Swetnam's XOL Program. Finally, Swetnam is not entitled to damages
for an unjust enrichment claim because he lacks standing to pursue such a claim.

9. For these reasons, Swetnam is not entitled to the damages he seeks. Accordingly,

Valley Baptists requests that this Court enter judgment that Swetnam cannot, as a matter of law,

recover disgorgement damages or unjust enrichment damages and that the civil penalty sought
by Swetnam is based on each annual cost report that is proven to have been made in violation of
the FCA during the applicable limitations period, not on every Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement claim made by Valley Baptist.
II. ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES

10. Valley Baptist moves for partial summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 56 on Swetnam's claims for civil penalties and a disgorgement of Valley
Baptist's profits for violations of the FCA and for unjust enrichment damages.
A. Summary Judgment Standard.

11. "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a
matter of law."'? "A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support

the assertion by citing to particular parts of materials in the record . . . ."!0x00B0 "

[T]he plain language
of Rule 56[] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and
upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of
an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at
trial."!*

12. "Initially, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a
genuine issue of material fact."'0x00B0 If the burden of proof at trial lies with the non-moving party,

eee

the movant may satisfy its initial burden by "`showing'-that is, pointing out to the district

court-that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case."'0x00B0 While the

party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of
material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case.""

13. "When the moving party has met its Rule 56[] burden, the nonmoving party
cannot survive a summary judgment motion by resting on the mere allegation of its pleadings.""(R)
The nonmovant must identify specific evidence in the record and articulate how that evidence
supports that party's claim.'" "This burden will not be satisfied by `some metaphysical doubt as
to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a
scintilla of evidence.'""0x00B0
B. The FCA provides for civil penalties and an award of actual damages.

14. Under the FCA, if a person is found to have engaged in one of seven statutorily
defined types of fraud, that person is liable for two separate categories of damages: (1) a civil
penalty; and (2) the government's actual damages."! With respect to the civil penalty, the court
must assess a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000 for each FCA
violation."" For actual damages, the court must award "3 times the amount of damages which the
government sustains because of the act of that person" who violated the FCA." The relator who
brings an FCA action may also be entitled to a portion of the government's recovery. Here,
because the government did not intervene in this lawsuit and only if Valley Baptist is found

liable for violating the FCA, Swetnam would be entitled to recover from Valley Baptist an

amount that is between 25% and 30% of the sum of the civil penalty and government's actual

damages." Swetnam would also be entitled to his reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses."
Although the statute is clear, the parties dispute the measure of recoverable damages in this case.

C. Even if the fact finder determines Valley Baptist violated the FCA, Relator is not
entitled to entire amount of civil penalties that he seeks.

15. As discussed above, if a person violates the FCA, that person is a liable for a civil
penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000 for each fraudulent claim."0x00B0 "Claim"
is defined as any request or demand ... for money or property."" Swetnam seeks to recover
between $5,000 and $10,000 for every reimbursement request that Valley Baptist submitted to
the government for medical services rendered between October 9, 2002 and April 15, 2003 by
Valley Baptist physicians who participated in the XOL Program. As a matter of law, Swetnam is
not entitled to the damages he seeks.

16. Swetnam does not allege that any single reimbursement request that Valley
Baptist submitted to the government was fraudulent. Indeed, Swetnam does not dispute that
Valley Baptist actually provided the medical services that the government reimbursed, that the
medical services were billed at the appropriate amounts and that the provided medical services
were necessary. Therefore, this lawsuit does not involve fraudulent reimbursement requests.

17. | Notwithstanding the foregoing, Swetnam claims he is entitled a civil penalty for
virtually every Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement claim Valley Baptist submitted to the
government for medical services rendered between October 9, 2002 and April 15, 2003 by
physicians who participated in the XOL Program (approximately 31,056 claims during this
period). Based on Swetnam's claim, he seeks a $5,000 to $10,000 civil penalty for every single

reimbursement request the government paid Valley Baptist during the relevant time period-all

31,056 claims, for a total of $155.3 million to $310.6 million in civil penalties. As described
below, Swetnam's claim fails as a matter of law.

18. Under the FCA, the "violation" is the submission of a false claim.7% Here,
Swetnam claims Valley Baptist violated the FCA because Valley Baptist submitted annual cost
reports to the government that were false. Specifically, Swetnam claims that, in the annual cost
reports, Valley Baptist certified that it had complied with all laws and regulations when it had in
fact not done so. Therefore, the violation is the submission of the false annual cost report, and
each allegedly false annual cost report represents one false claim, for which Valley Baptist could
be liable for one civil penalty. 7? The civil penalty of $5,000 to $10,000 is not applied to each
reimbursement request.

19. Because this Court's earlier order on the statute of limitations bars Swetnam's
claims for FCA violations that occurred prior to October 2, 2002, Swetnam can only recover a
civil penalty for each allegedly false annual cost report that was submitted after October 2, 2002.
Here, the parties do not dispute that the 2002-2003 annual cost report is the only applicable
annual cost report. Therefore, the range of civil penalties for which Valley Baptist could be liable
totals anywhere between $5,000 and $10,000.

20. Accordingly, this Court should render judgment that the damages recoverable for
violation for submission of a false claim would only be the one statutory penalty in an amount

between $5,000 and $10,000 relating to the 2002-2003 annual cost report.

D. Even if the fact finder determines Valley Baptist violated the FCA, Relator is not
entitled to the actual damages that he seeks.

21. As discussed above, the FCA provides for two categories of damages: "civil
penalt[ies] and damages." There is not any one specific standard for calculating damages under
the FCA." Instead, courts have used several different damage models, adapting them to the facts
of each case.*' Here, Swetnam seeks as damages a disgorgement from Valley Baptist of all
amounts Valley Baptist received from the government for medical services rendered by
physicians who participated in the XOL Program from October 9, 2002 through April 15, 2003."
Swetnam also seeks unjust enrichment damages under the theory that the Valley Baptist received
additional Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements due to an increase in the number of
physicians practicing at Valley Baptist because of the XOL Program. As a matter of law,
Swetnam is not entitled to these damages.

i. Damages and disgorgement are different remedies that are measured differently.

22. Damages and disgorgement are distinct remedies. "Disgorgement of improper
profits" is a restitutionary remedy,*? and restitution is appropriate only where there has been a
showing of unjust enrichment.** Although restitution can be granted as a form of legal relief, it is
generally considered an equitable remedy.*0x00B0 "Money damages are, of course, the classic form of
legal relief."0x00B00x00B0 In addition, damages and restitutionary remedies (like disgorgement) are

measured differently. Damages are measured by the plaintiff's loss; restitution is measured by

enrichment because: (i) as described below, he lacks standing to pursue such a claim, and (ii)
there is no dispute Valley Baptist provided the medical services that the government reimbursed.
For these reasons, the Court should not award Swetnam damages that include a disgorgement of
all amounts Valley Baptist received from the government from October 9, 2002 until April 15,
2003.

ii. The FCA's plain language does not grant Swetnam the remedy of disgorgement.

23. Although there is not any one specific standard for calculating damages under the
FCA," the FCA's text does not permit Swetnam to seek as damages a disgorgement. Unless a
statute's text is ambiguous, courts are bound by the text's plain meaning.*" Swetnam does not
allege that the FCA or its remedial provision is ambiguous. In fact, the FCA clearly and
unequivocally sets out the remedies imposed on violators: a civil penalty, "plus 3 times the
amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.""! Because
the FCA's text is not ambiguous, courts are bound by the FCA's plain meaning.

24. The word at issue is "damages," which the FCA does not define. ""When words in
a statute are not otherwise defined, it is fundamental that they `will be interpreted as taking their
