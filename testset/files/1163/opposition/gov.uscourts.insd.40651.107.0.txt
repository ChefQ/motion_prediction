Civil Action Case No. 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES [CM/ECF 95]
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court deny Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees.

First, Defendant had the opportunity to answer Plaintiff’s Complaint and his failure to do so
provides Plaintiff with the absolute right to dismiss. Because Plaintiff dismissed Defendant
through a notice, without prejudice, Defendant is not the prevailing party. Under the Copyright
Act, only prevailing parties are entitled to an award of fees. Further, allowing Defendant to
recover his fees without an adjudication on the merits would violate the spirit of the Copyright
Act.
For all the foregoing reasons, as set forth below, this Court should deny Defendant’s
motion for fees.

II.

FACTS
A. Procedural History
On June 18, 2012, Plaintiff filed this action for copyright infringement against seven

defendants. Shortly thereafter, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Serve a Third
Party Subpoena and entered an order allowing Plaintiff to subpoena Comcast Communications in
order to discover the identity of the alleged infringers. See CM/ECF 7. On September 27, 2012,
after notifying each of its subscribers of the pending law suit, Comcast provided Plaintiff with
the subpoena response, identifying among others, Defendant James Helferich (“Helferich”) as
John Doe #5 in this law suit.
Pursuant to your Honor’s order [CM/ECF 11], Plaintiff promptly amended its Complaint
on October 3, 2012 to name Helferich and on November 1, 2012 Helferich was served. See
CM/ECF 36.

Despite having been notified of the suit by Comcast and then being personally

served with the Amended Complaint, Helferich ignored the lawsuit. Indeed, several months
passed without an answer and on April 24, 2013 the Court entered a default judgment in the
amount of $35,760.00.
Once Helferich realized that a monetary judgment had been entered against him, he
immediately responded and within two weeks of the default judgment being entered, counsel
appeared in this matter on his behalf.
B. Defendant Either Perjured Himself Or His Counsel Submitted a Motion in
Bad Faith
On May 21, 2013 Defendant filed a Motion to Quash Service & to Set Aside Default
Judgment (“Motion”). See CM/ECF 67. Attached to that Motion, Helferich filed a declaration
claiming, among other things, that “I was never served with a subpoena”. Id. at 67-2, ¶7. It also
stated, “[t]he first time I became aware of my duty to participate in the proceedings was my
2

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 3 of 14 PageID #: 746

receipt of a default judgment.” Id. at ¶8. Noteworthy, the clerk would have mailed Helferich
notice of the Clerk’s entrance of a default judgment over two months before Plaintiff filed for
final default judgment.
In Helferich’s motion, he argues, “[h]e was not served, something he would have taken
note of were it to occur, being aware of the consequences of service.” CM/ECF 67-1 at *5 citing
CM/ECF 67-1 ¶7. He also states, “[a]ny presumption of proper service has certainly been
overcome by the declaration provided, and the clear inaccuracy of the return of service.” Id. He
claims that the process server’s report acts as evidence that he was not served because it lists his
hair as “brown” and identifies him as 180lbs instead of 250lbs. Counsel for Helferich puts forth
this argument unaware that Helferich had signed the notice of service. See CM/ECF 69 Ex. A.
It is strikingly similar to the signature on his declaration. And, Facebook photos of his from
November 2012 show that he had a beard and brown eyebrows, making a logical conclusion that
his hair was “brown”1.
While Mr. Helferich did not expressly deny service, his counsel certainly used his
declaration as evidence to argue improper service. Ultimately, Defendant’s motion was filed in
bad faith, when service was properly effectuated.

Significantly, Plaintiff’s process server has

served dozens of others defendants that properly filed answers, including defendants in this case.
And, Plaintiff’s process server would have no opportunity, nor motivation, to know Defendant’s
signature before serving him. Defendant, however, had significant motivation to put forth a
dishonest argument in the hopes of vacating his default judgment.

Plaintiff has not included pictures of Defendant from his Facebook page out of respect for
Defendant’s privacy. That being said, should the Court wish to view these pictures Plaintiff will
submit them.
3

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 4 of 14 PageID #: 747

C. Defendant Failed to File an Answer
Aware that this Court favors resolving cases on their merits, Plaintiff did not oppose the
Motion to Vacate the Default Judgment. Plaintiff did, however, identify Defendant’s bad faith in
filing the motion. See CM/ECF 69. Defendant replied and stated that the signature was not his,
but conspicuously made this comment through counsel, absent a declaration, and failed to in
anyway elaborate.

At no point in time did Defendant ever file an answer.

D. Plaintiff Has Substantial Evidence Against Defendant
Plaintiff’s evidence against Helferich is significant.

Specifically, IPP, Plaintiff’s

investigator, recorded Helferich infringing the siterip in this case for a period of 8 days. See
CM/ECF 101, Exhibit A.

This is a far greater time than Helferich’s accused “snapshot”.

Further, Helferich downloaded another siterip containing Plaintiff’s movies just a few weeks
later.

Id.

And, Plaintiff informed Helferich that it had recorded this infringement for a

substantial period in its response to interrogatories. See Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s
Interrogatories at ¶ 4.
While the siterip at issue in this case contained a large amount of Plaintiff’s movies in
one file, eight days is more than enough of a period to complete the transaction and distribute to
other infringers, inflicting substantial harm on Plaintiff. Indeed, BitTorrent is a popular file
sharing service mainly because of its speed and ability to download large amounts of content in a
short period of time.
Helferich stated in his interrogatories that he had a far superior knowledge of computers,
including a technical degree in Computer Networking Systems. See CM/ECF 96 -2 at *2. And,
he built his own computer. Id. at *3. His primary job is in system monitoring and in the past he
has worked as a computer technician. Id. at *2. (“Worked …for three months as a Systems

4

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 5 of 14 PageID #: 748

Analyst with System Monitoring as my primary job description”.) Helferich’s defense is that he
was not at home during the time of infringement and it was his neighbors.
Despite monitoring networks for a living, Helferich states that he did not know his
network lacked a password. He also states he did not know who was using his Internet. Further,
Helferich’s declaration states that “during the time I was alleged to have participated in the socalled ‘swarm’, I was out of town, visiting in-laws.” But, his interrogatories state that he was at
home that morning, and did not leave until later that day. Specifically, his interrogatory says:
As already provided in my declaration, no one would have been home that day for
the majority of the day. Only my wife and I would have had access, if any, to the
afore mentioned “Computer Devices.” Such access would have been to check a
recipe for something being cooked in the morning to take to Easter celebrations at
my in-laws. We would have left sometime in the morning and been gone the
entirety of the day.
See Helferich’s Response to Interrogatories at #10. Helferich is referring to April 7th, 2012. The
last date of recorded activity for the swarm by Helferich was on April 7, 2012 at 10:21:11 EST.
The infringement had been on-going for eight days at that point and appeared to have stopped
later that day. That is consistent with Helferich’s story. Helferich’s declaration, therefore, does
not in any way absolve him of guilt.
E. Helferich’s Expert Does Not Exonerate Him
Helferich’s forensic expert only examined his hard drives for evidence of Plaintiff’s
movies. See CM/ECF 96-3. Not surprisingly, given Helferich’s background and expertise in
computers, and that he built his own computer, Helferich’s paid expert did not find Plaintiff’s
movies. Helferich’s expert does not provide any indication that the two hard drives he examined
were in Helferich’s possession at the time of the infringement, nor does he state whether he
examined the hard drives for evidence of tampering or wiping the drives clean, other than
looking for Plaintiff’s movies. Id.
5

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 6 of 14 PageID #: 749

Indeed, in the Bellwether trial, a similar defendant to Helferich, Bryan White, also built
his own computer. See Malibu Media v. John Does 1, et. al., 12-cv-02078, CM/ECF 170 (E.D.
Pa. June 3, 2013), Exhibit A. And, Bryan White showed to the Honorable Judge Baylson how
there were no traces of Plaintiff’s movies on his computer, nor did there ever appear to be. That
being said, Plaintiff’s expert was able to determine that the hard drive system had been placed on
the hard drive three days after Plaintiff served its discovery requests. Id. And, Microsoft’s
business records further verified this information. Id. Even though Mr. White had gone to great
efforts to include files dating from before the time he wiped his hard drive clean, the hard drive
system revealed that he had tampered with his computer and deleted evidence. Id. Helferich’s
expert does not rule out the very real possibility that this is the case here. Moreover, Helferich
states that one of his hard drives was originally obtained from his brother in law. See CM/ECF
96-2 at *3. It is possible the hard drive he provided his expert was not even the hard drive in his
computer at the time of infringement.
Finally, Helferich’s expert report is disingenuous when Helferich stated to Plaintiff in
response to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents that it was “burdensome and
oppressive” to produce a copy of his hard drives to Plaintiff. See CM/ECF 96-3 at *2. Despite
refusing to comply with Plaintiff’s discovery, he produced a copy for his expert – and never even
volunteered to provide that copy to Plaintiff’s expert for his own analysis.
F. Helferich’s Map of his Wi-Fi Range Does Not Exonerate Him
Helferich’s map showing the range of his Wi-Fi points to, at best, three or four homes
that may have had access to the Wi-Fi. See CM/ECF 96-3. Helferich does not indicate whether
any of his neighbors possessed the motive or capabilities to download the files. And, the farther
away one is from a Wi-Fi signal, the weaker the signal. It is not clear that any of his neighbors

6

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 7 of 14 PageID #: 750

would have been able to download the files, even if they were in the range of the wireless signal.
The length of time of the infringement further demonstrates that it was a resident and not a guest
or passerby.
G. Plaintiff Complied with Discovery
Plaintiff complied with a substantial amount of Defendant’s discovery requests and had
supplemented its response to Defendant’s interrogatories three times. At the time when Plaintiff
decided to dismiss its suit against Defendant, Defendant was sending undersigned multiple
emails a week (sometimes multiple emails per day) demanding Plaintiff turn over various
amounts of information.
Significantly, Helferich was demanding that Plaintiff provide “the amount of revenue
generated by actual sales, distribution, and all other manners of revenue generation other than by
copyright infringement suits in federal courts, trespass to chattels suits in state courts, and
settlements or verdicts regarding the same, whether had before or after actual service of
summons, with regards to each of the fifteen films alleged to have been part of the swarm
participated in by Defendant Helferich, and break down that revenue into applicable categories,
to the best of your ability.” See CM/ECF 101 Ex. B. Helferich was demanding that Plaintiff
submit that to him in a matter of days or threatening to file a Motion to Compel. The amount of
time and effort to respond to this request, particularly in an amount of days, would cause Plaintiff
to expend significant expense. This is on top of the numerous motions that Plaintiff would have
to respond to filed by Defendant, as well as the costs for its forensic investigator to examine a
self-made computer. Indeed, Plaintiff knew firsthand the costs from the Bellwether trial. See
Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1, 6, 13, 14, CIV.A. 12-2078, 2013 WL 3038025 (E.D. Pa.

7

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 8 of 14 PageID #: 751

June 18, 2013) ($128,350.50 in fees awarded to Plaintiff). Plaintiff also knew that it was not
likely that Helferich had the resources to ever enable Plaintiff to recover.
Plaintiff simply did a cost-benefit analysis of the case and determined that while it
believed Defendant to be the infringer, and the evidence certainly supported it, the deterrence of
a federal law suit would likely prohibit Helferich from ever stealing its movies again. But, to
continue the case and expend hundreds of thousands of dollars and at the same time, potentially
bankrupt Helferich with a later award of attorneys’ fees, was not in either party’s best interests.
Given that Helferich had failed to file an answer and Plaintiff had an absolute right to dismiss,
Plaintiff thought that this course of action best suited its goals.
III.

DEFENDANT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE AN ANSWER AND
FAILED TO DO SO
Defendant’s argument that he was barred from filing an answer is incorrect. Indeed, the

Seventh Circuit has expressly held that filing an answer after a default has been entered may cure
the default and is a factor a court should consider when determining whether to vacate. See
Anilina Fabrique de Colorants v. Aakash Chemicals & Dyestuffs, Inc., 856 F.2d 873, 879 (7th
Cir. 1988) (“[Defendant] promptly attempted to cure its default by filing its proposed answer and
counterclaims”); see also Matter of Busick, 719 F.2d 922, 926 (7th Cir. 1983) (“Clearly,
appellant acted promptly to cure the defect by filing an answer … [t]here is no indication in the
record that the default was willful.”) This is consistent with other courts throughout the country.
See e.g. Marks v. Gephardt, C07-5259RJB, 2007 WL 4269803 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 3, 2007)
(“Defendants may be technically in default at this time, however, the filing of an answer on
November 9, 2007, is an attempt to cure the default.”)

IV.

PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE
ABSOLUTE RIGHT

OF

VOLUNTARY

DISMISSAL

WAS

ITS

Because of Defendant’s failure to answer or file for summary judgment, Plaintiff had an
absolute right to file a voluntary dismissal. “[O]ne doesn't need a good reason, or even a sane or
any reason, to dismiss a suit voluntarily. The right is absolute, as Rule 41(a)(1) and the cases
interpreting it make clear.” Marques v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Chicago, 286 F.3d 1014, 1017 (7th
Cir. 2002). “[T]his rule accords to the movant an absolute right of dismissal without prejudice if
no answer or motion for summary judgment has been filed.” United States v. E. I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co., 13 F.R.D. 490, 495 (N.D. Ill. 1953). “The effect of a voluntary dismissal
without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a) ... is to render the proceedings a nullity and leave the
parties as if the action had never been brought.” Kurz v. Fid. Mgmt. & Research Co., 07-CV592-JPG, 2007 WL 2908918 (S.D. Ill. Oct. 4, 2007).
Because Plaintiff’s right to voluntary dismiss is absolute, the amount of time and work
expended by a defendant is not relevant to the dismissal. “Courts have refused to weigh the
amount of effort expended by the defendant or the district court, instead holding that ‘rule
41(a)(1) means what it says.’” Am. Soccer Co., Inc. v. Score First Enterprises, a Div. of Kevlar
Indus., 187 F.3d 1108, 1111 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Carter v. United States, 547 F.2d 258, 259
(5th Cir. 1977) (finding the amount of effort expended by Defendant to be irrelevant and noting:
“Defendants who desire to prevent plaintiffs from invoking their unfettered right to dismiss
actions under rule 41(a)(1) may do so by taking the simple step of filing an answer”); Manze v.
State Farm Ins. Co., 817 F.2d 1062, 1067 (3d Cir. 1987) (reversing an award of attorney’s fees).
V.

DEFENDANT IS NOT THE PREVAILING PARTY
Under the Copyright Act, “the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs

by or against any party . . . the court may also award a reasonable attorney’s fee to the prevailing
9

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 10 of 14 PageID #: 753

party as a part of the costs.” 17 U.S.C. § 505. (Emphasis added). The Copyright Act does not
define the term “prevailing party” and, accordingly, it must be construed with “general principles
of law.” See 6 Patry on Copyright § 22:211.
In Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Virginia Dept. of Health & Human Res.,
532 U.S. 598 (2001) the Supreme Court announced that a party prevails when there has been “a
material alteration of the parties' legal relationship.” Id. at 603.

Buckhannon’s “material

alteration” test is used in the context of the Copyright Act for purposes of determining who is a
prevailing party entitled to an award of costs and attorney’s fees. See Riviera Distributors, Inc.
v. Jones, 517 F.3d 926, 928 (7th Cir. 2008); Cadkin v. Loose, 569 F.3d 1142, 1149 (9th Cir.
2009); Interscope Records v. Leadbetter, 2007 WL 2572336 (W.D. Wash. 2007) aff'd, 312 Fed.
Appx. 50 (9th Cir. 2009).
“[A]s Buckhannon explained, there must be a court-ordered change in the legal
relationship between the parties.” Southworth v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wisconsin Sys., 376
F.3d 757, 771 (7th Cir. 2004). “In other words, ‘there must be a judicial imprimatur on the
change.’” Walker v. Calumet City, Ill., 565 F.3d 1031, 1034 (7th Cir. 2009). Here, Plaintiff
dismissed Defendant through a notice, without a Court order. Therefore, there was no judicial
imprimatur. For these reasons, courts traditionally hold that a defendant is not entitled to
attorney’s fees when dismissed by notice without prejudice.
A. Courts in the Seventh Circuit Consistently Find That A Dismissal Without
Prejudice Does Not Make Defendant A Prevailing Party For Purposes of Fee
Shifting
“[A] dismissal without prejudice does not render the defendant a prevailing party for
purposes of the fee-shifting statutes.” Zila Swab Technologies, Inc. v. Van Dyke, 01 C 8729,
2003 WL 1745901 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 1, 2003). “[A] dismissal without prejudice does not ‘bestow
prevailing party status on [claimants] because it effect[s] no ‘change in the legal relationship of
10

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 11 of 14 PageID #: 754

the parties.’” United States v. Approximately $3,174.00 in U.S. Currency, 928 F. Supp. 2d 1040
(E.D. Wis. 2013). “A dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(1)(i) does not decide the
case on the merits.” Id.
The Copyright Act expressly allows fee recovery only to a defendant that is the
prevailing party. See 17 U.S.C. §505. “Because Defendant is not a prevailing party, he is not
entitled to attorney’s fees.” Malibu Media v. Jeremy Cotton, et. al., 12-cv-00845, (S.D. In. April
29, 2013)

Here, because Helferich was dismissed without prejudice, Helferich is not the

“prevailing party” under the Copyright Act. Id.
B. Defendant’s Cases Are All Distinguishable or Inapplicable
Defendant relies on Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 396, 110 S. Ct.
2447, 2456, 110 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1990) for the premise that the Court retains jurisdiction to award
fees when a defendant is dismissed without prejudice. While this may be true, Defendant is still
not the prevailing party.

Indeed, Cooter & Gell retained jurisidiction for the purpose of

awarding fees under Rule 11. As Plaintiff has previously briefed, Helferich cannot be awarded
fees under Rule 11 because he did not comply with the safe harbor. See CM/ECF 101.
Defendant’s reliance on Sequa Corp. v. Cooper, 245 F.3d 1036, 1038 (8th Cir. 2001) is
also misplaced. First, in Sequa Corp., the Eighth Circuit’s holding was limited to costs and not
attorneys’ fees.

See Id. at 1037 (“[A] voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule

41(a)(1)(i) does not deprive a District Court of its authority to award costs.”). Here, Defendant
has not demonstrated he is entitled to any costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Indeed, none of
his requests for compensation fall under the list of approved costs.
Second, the Eighth Circuit expressly disagreed with the district court that the defendant
was the “prevailing party” after a voluntary dismissal without prejudice. “Though we disagree

11

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 12 of 14 PageID #: 755

with the court's conclusion that Sequa's voluntary dismissal of the action made defendants
prevailing parties, we note that Rule 54(d)(1) simply provides that ordinarily costs shall be
allowed ‘as of course’ to the prevailing party ‘unless the court otherwise directs.’” Id. Indeed,
the court reasoned that the relevant statute in which the defendant was seeking costs, namely
Rule 54(d)(1) permitted it in some circumstances where the defendant is not the prevailing party.
“We do not read Rule 54(d)(1) as impairing the inherent authority of a trial court to award costs
incurred in defending an action prior to its voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff, even though a
voluntary dismissal without prejudice means that neither party can be said to have prevailed.”
Id. at 1037-38. But, here, the Copyright Act expressly limits a fee award to the prevailing party.
Finally, the reasoning relied upon in Sequa is contrary to Seventh Circuit precedent,
which states, “[r]ule 41(a)(1)(i) prevents an award of ‘costs’ against the party who dismisses the
suit voluntarily.” Szabo Food Serv., Inc. v. Canteen Corp., 823 F.2d 1073, 1077 (7th Cir. 1987);
see also Smart v. Local 702 Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 573 F.3d 523, 525 (7th Cir. 2009) (“A
party prevails for purposes of Rule 54(d) when a final judgment awards it substantial relief”).
Here, Seventh Circuit precedent prevents any award of costs to Defendant.
C. Public Policy Supports Denying Defendant Fees
“[T]he right of voluntary dismissal is still a vital policy of federal procedure and is one of
the consequences to which all federal cases are subject.” Miller v. Stewart, 43 F.R.D. 409, 411
(E.D. Ill. 1967). If the Court were to allow Defendant to recover fees on the basis of a voluntary
dismissal without prejudice, plaintiffs will no longer be able to rely on the premise that a notice
of dismissal without prejudice is absolute, and a plaintiff can dismiss its case without
consequence. Indeed, the concept that “[a] voluntary dismissal without prejudice leaves the
situation as if the action had never been filed” Beck v. Caterpillar Inc., 855 F. Supp. 260, 264

12

Case 1:12-cv-00842-TWP-MJD Document 107 Filed 10/04/13 Page 13 of 14 PageID #: 756

(C.D. Ill. 1994) will no longer be true. Plaintiffs may continue claims they no longer wish to
pursue, as would Malibu Media here, in order to avoid fee liability.
Further, because there has been no adjudication on the merits, an award of fees to
Defendant would violate the spirit of the Copyright Act. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held
that a fee award must be “faithful to the purposes of the Copyright Act”. Fogerty v. Fantasy,
Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 535, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 1033, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994). Allowing a Defendant
that is likely liable for infringement to obtain an award of fees simply because Plaintiff dismissed
its suit, as an absolute right, would violate the purposes of the Copyright Act.
VI.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court deny Defendant’s

motion for attorney’s fees.
