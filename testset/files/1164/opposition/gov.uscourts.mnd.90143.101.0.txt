ATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFF
HYSITRON INCORPORATED

Plaintiff Hysitron Incorporated (“Hysitron”) respectfully submits this
memorandum of law in opposition to Defendant MTS Systems Corporation’s (“MTS”)
motion for protective order, or in the alternative, to stay discovery.
INTRODUCTION
Hysitron seeks evidence and information in MTS’ possession to prove Hysitron’s
patent and trademark claims. The discovery at issue is relevant to both. And, with
respect to the trademark claims specifically, the Rules do not permit MTS to make use of
the HYSITRON mark for its own commercial gain while simultaneously refusing
discovery on the same subject. Furthermore, and contrary to its representations, MTS
continues to use the HYSITRON mark even after the filing of this motion for protective
order, and after advising Hysitron and the Court that it had ceased use of the mark. 1
As stated, the discovery sought by Hysitron relates to Hysitron’s pending patent
and trademark claims. Additionally, MTS’ motion for partial summary judgment
directed at the trademark claims is pending. MTS refuses to provide discovery directly
relevant to the trademark claims while simultaneously contending it should be granted
summary judgment, an absolutely untenable position. Hysitron respectfully requests that
the motion for protective order, or in the alternative a stay, be denied and that MTS be
compelled to produce the requested documents.
This opposition memorandum responds only to MTS’ motion for protective order,
or in the alternative, for a stay of discovery. Pursuant to D. Minn. LR 7.1(a), Hysitron

MTS’ continued use of the HYSITRON mark was noted in Hysitron’s Memorandum of
Law in Support of Motion to Compel, and the Platt Declaration, filed April 1, 2008.
1

makes no reply to MTS’ opposition to Hysitron’s motion to compel, which was included
in MTS’ combined filing.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Hysitron served its Second Set of Requests for Production of Documents to
Defendant on January 4, 2008. (Declaration of Brian N. Platt in Support of Motion to
Compel Documents (“Platt Decl.”) ¶ 4.) MTS served its responses on February 22, 2008.
(Id. Ex. 3.) MTS’ discovery responses did not include any substantive response for
document requests 5 and 9-42. (Id. Ex. 3.)
On March 19, MTS and Hysitron held a Rule 37 meet-and-confer telephone
conference to resolve these discovery issues. (Id. ¶ 5.) The parties held a second Rule 37
meet-and-confer telephone conference on March 27, in which MTS agreed to provide
responses for Request Nos. 11, 12, 14, and 15.
On April 17, 2008, more than two weeks after the filing of Hysitron’s Motion to
Compel Documents, MTS agreed to provide documents responsive to Request Nos. 10
and 18-21. (Declaration of Brian N. Platt in Opposition to Motion for Protective Order
(“Supp. Platt Decl.”) Ex. 1.) At issue now are document requests 5, 9, 13, 16, 17, and
22 – 42. MTS continues to use the HYSITRON mark to sell MTS products through
sponsored link advertising. (Supp. Platt Decl. Ex. 2.)
BACKGROUND
MTS purchased the keyword HYSITRON for use as a sponsored link from
Google. (See Johns Decl. ¶ 12.) That purchase triggers advertisements to appear on
Google’s search results based on the key terms purchased. A purchase of the key term
2

“hysitron” will return an advertisement when a user searches for that term. Purchasing an
advertisement from Google, however, does not in any way limit the search results to
Google.com. Rather, advertisements triggered by key terms purchased through Google
also displayed on numerous third party websites.
These third party websites are not bound to a specific format in which to display
the advertisements. The third party websites may re-format the Google advertisements
and display them in a manner that matches other non-sponsored search results, or
incorporate the advertisements within the content of their own websites. Consequently,
Internet users searching for “Hysitron” are presented with links to MTS’ website in a
variety of formats. Many of those links are embedded within the results pages of thirdparty websites. Examples showing MTS’ advertisements on Google, as well as a few
third-party websites, are shown below:

(Am. Compl. ¶ 34 (www.google.com)).

3

(Supp. Platt Decl., Ex. 3 (www.webcrawler.com).)

(Supp. Platt Decl., Ex. 4 (www.excite.com).)

4

(Supp. Platt Decl., Ex. 6 (www.dogpile.com).)
These references are mere examples of the numerous ways MTS has taken
Hysitron’s trademark and generated advertisements based on Hysitron’s coined
trademark. Moreover, as shown in the Webcrawler, Excite, and Dogpile examples, the
MTS advertisement is not distinguished as a sponsored link: the advertisements on these
websites are incorporated within the regular search results. Moreover, these results show
that the key term “hysitron” is “sponsored by” the website located at www.mtsnano.com,
creating the impression that MTS is in some way affiliated or connected with Hysitron.
The intent behind MTS’s use of the “hysitron” mark to generate its advertisements
can only be to get consumers to click on the advertisement. Because the format in which
the ads are displayed creates the impression that MTS is connected to the search term
“hysitron,” consumers are likely to click on the advertisement to learn more information
about MTS. At that point, MTS has effectively confused the consumers into avoiding
Hysitron’s official website, and caused the consumers to visit MTS’ website. The
5

consumers may never know the parties are not related. Moreover, MTS has used
Hysitron’s mark to gain a customer or potential customer. The documents showing the
extent to which this activity occurs are solely in MTS’ possession. MTS should not be
allowed to hide behind the facts of its misconduct.
MTS’ conduct continues, causing a likelihood of consumer confusion. Despite
MTS’ false statement that it had stopped using the HYSITRON mark in connection with
sponsored link advertising (as shown above), (see Platt Decl. Ex. 1), Hysitron’s
investigation revealed continued use. MTS had not stopped using the HYSITRON mark
for sponsored link advertising. (Platt Decl. Ex. 2; Am. Compl. ¶ 34.) Continued
investigation shows MTS’ ongoing use of the HYSITRON mark. (Supp. Platt Decl. Ex.
2.) MTS should be required to provide discovery to show the extent of its infringement,
and to detail its process of presenting MTS’ advertisements based on Hysitron’s
trademark. 2
ARGUMENT
I.

MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER.
Consideration of a motion for protective order, or to stay discovery, is a matter

wholly within the discretion of the Court. Sanden v. Mayo Clinic, 495 F.2d 221, 228 (8th
Cir. 1974) (“[T]he granting or denial of a protective order is within the discretion of the
trial court . . . .”). The Court’s discretion is guided by Rule 26, which grants the right to
discovery of “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any
2

Except as discussed during the unsuccessful settlement negotiations mediated by the
Court, MTS has offered no assurances, let alone made a binding commitment, regarding
its future use of Internet advertising. (See Platt Decl., Ex. 1.)
6

party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (emphasis added). A party seeking a protective order
must show “good cause” for its issuance. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).
“Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated
reasoning, do not satisfy the Rule 26(c) test.” Foltz v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,
331 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2003). Even when “good cause” is shown, the Court
should balance the relative burden on the parties. See, e.g., In re Coordinated Pretrial
Proceedings in Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig., 669 F.2d 620, 623 (10th Cir. 1982).
Nearly all of the document requests are relevant to Hysitron’s proof of patent
damages. All of the document requests are also relevant to Hysitron’s proof of its
trademark claims. Furthermore, MTS cannot not be permitted to stonewall on discovery
while simultaneously contending Hysitron’s trademark claims should be dismissed on
summary judgment. MTS’ legal challenge to the trademark claims is simply wrong.
Indeed, precedent in this judicial district (Tunheim, J.), and other districts, rejects MTS’
position. (See infra, at 8-12.) Hysitron’s motion to compel should be granted in full.
A.

Patent Infringement.

Hysitron’s pending claims for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,026,677 (“the
’677 patent”) and 5,553,486 (“the ’486 patent”) provide substantial basis for the
requested discovery. MTS ignores the patent claims and their relevance in its motion for
protective order. (See MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 1-15.) Because the
requested protective order would preclude discovery relevant to Hysitron’s claims for
patent infringement, the Court should decline its entry.

7

1.

Nearly All of Hysitron’s Requests are Relevant to Patent
Damages.

The following requests are relevant to Hysitron’s patent damages. The discovery
is directed to issues of lost profits, price erosion, and the competitive relationship
between the parties. Hysitron is entitled to present the jury with the facts that make the
proof of its contentions compelling.


Request No. 5. Trademark Searches or Investigations. The relevant
market for products, including competitive relationship based on the
“totality of the circumstances,” is relevant to patent damages. Bic Leisure
Prods., Inc. v. Windsurfing Int’l Corp., 1 F.3d 1214, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 1993).



Request No. 9. Channels of Trade. The normal channels of trade for
distribution are relevant to patent claims. Bic Leisure, 1 F.3d at 1218.



Request No. 13 Target Market. Lost profits patent damages are available
where infringing products compete in the same market. Id.



Request No. 17 Use of “Hysitron”. Advertising, marketing, and sales are
part of the “totality of the circumstances” considered in evaluating lost
profits damages. TWM Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Dura Corp., 789 F.2d 895, 902
(Fed. Cir. 1986).



Request Nos. 22-33. Third Party Advertising. Third party advertising
by MTS using the “Hysitron” mark is part of the “totality of the
circumstances” considered in evaluating lost profits damages. See id.



Request Nos. 34, 35. Website Marketing. MTS’ efforts to market its
website www.mtsnano.com in competition with Hysitron is part of the
“totality of the circumstances” considered in evaluating lost profits
damages. See id.



Request No. 38. Pricing. MTS’ pricing, and Hysitron’s competition with
a larger infringer, is relevant to lost profits damages. Id. at 902.



Request No. 42. Keyword Advertising Plans. MTS’ plans to expand
keyword advertising, as part of a plan to compete in the marketplace, are
relevant to lost profits damages, and to Hysitron’s burden competing with
MTS. See id.
8

(See Hysitron Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Compel at 10-32).
The requested protective order would unfairly limit Hysitron’s access to discovery
relevant to its patent claims. It should be denied.
Indeed, MTS implicitly concedes the relevance of these requests to the patent
claims, but contends it has (or will) produce documents sufficient for Hysitron’s needs.
Based on seven document requests, MTS contends it has produced documents which “are
more than ample to calculate Hysitron’s lost profits claim.” (See MTS Mem. Law Supp.
Mot. Prot. Ord. at 18-19). MTS does not have the right to arrogate to itself the scope of
Hysitron’s discovery. Nor is MTS entitled to cherry-pick its documents for selective
production, while withholding documents that damage its case. MTS ignores the fact that
the lost profits determination must be made in the light of the totality of the
circumstances between the parties. TMW Mfg. Co., 789 F.2d at 902. Refusing to
provide discovery because MTS thinks it has produced “ample” documents is
self-serving and improper.
B.

Trademark Infringement.

MTS’ allegation that Hysitron’s trademark claims are “vexatious,” while MTS
makes use of the HYSITRON mark, shows chutzpah. See Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co. v.
CFMT, Inc., 142 F.3d 1266, 1271 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (describing as “chutzpah” the
“behavior of a person who kills his parents and pleads for the court’s mercy on the
ground of being an orphan”). Furthermore, its contention that it has a defense to these
claims is insufficient grounds to resist discovery. See, e.g., Bruckelmyer v. Ground

9

Heaters, Inc., Case. No. C 02-1761 DWF/RLE, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11024, *5-6 (D.
Minn. June 5, 2003) (declining to stay discovery in favor of dispositive motions).
1.

The Scope of Requests Relating to Trademark Claims is
Appropriately Broader than Patent-related Requests.

MTS defined the scope of trademark discovery by using the HYSITRON mark to
market its directly competing products. (Supp. Platt Decl., Exs. 2-5). The scope of
MTS’ use of the Hysitron mark extends beyond the subject matter of Hysitron’s patent
claims. Discovery related to trademark infringement puts at issue MTS’ marketing of all
of its products and services. That discovery is appropriately broader in scope: MTS
defined the scope of this discovery by its decision to use the HYSITRON mark to
promote its own products. MTS’ suggestion that Hysitron wants to “have it both ways,”
and that Hysitron’s position is “inconsistent with the position it took in objecting to MTS’
discovery requests” is wrong. (MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 19-21.) The
discovery related to the patent claims is appropriately limited to the asserted patents and
embodiments thereof. (Order, docket no. 72, at 2-4).
2.

Hysitron’s Right to Relevant Discovery.

Hysitron’s claims for trademark infringement remain pending. MTS continues to
trade on the renown and reputation of HYSITRON to sell MTS products. (Platt Decl.,
Ex. 2; Supp. Platt Decl., Ex. 2.) A promise (even when not hollow) to cease infringement
does not unilaterally stop the discovery process: Hysitron has a right to seek discovery to
prove its claims and obtain a permanent injunction.

10

MTS’ (false) contention that it has ceased use of the HYSITRON mark is
meaningless. Nothing restricts MTS’ future conduct. Indeed, in its brief, MTS
characterizes an injunction as “unnecessary” against conduct that is not “likely to occur in
the future.” (MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 12-13 (emphasis added).) With
due respect, not “likely” to occur is not good enough. The law is clear:
[V]oluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive
the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case, i.e., does not
make the case moot.
United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953). The “voluntary cessation of
a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the
legality of the practice.” See Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 503 (8th Cir. 2006)
(internal quotations omitted).
Furthermore, MTS’ statement that it has stopped using the term “hysitron” is false.
(See Johns Decl. ¶ 12; see also Supp. Platt Decl., Ex. 2.) The law recognizes that a
promise to stop infringing conduct is worth little. A permanent injunction, and the
subsequent enforcement powers of the Court, is the appropriate remedy for infringing
conduct. The purpose of Hysitron’s discovery is proper.
MTS turns Hysitron’s motivation on its head, arguing that Hysitron pursues
trademark claims not “for a substantive purpose . . . but rather, to recover attorneys’
fees.” (MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 3.) Hysitron is neither so imprudent,
nor wealthy, to pursue discovery for discovery’s sake; neither is Hysitron so imprudent as
to pursue its trademark claims on the prospect that the Court will find this case
“exceptional” and award attorneys’ fees under 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). Rather, Hysitron
11

seeks what it is entitled to under the law: injunctive relief forbidding MTS from trading
on the renown and reputation of HYSITRON. It will also seek an award of attorneys’
fees because MTS’ infringement is “exceptional.”
Notably, MTS has propounded one-hundred and one separate Requests for
documents. Some requests are breathtaking in scope. By contrast, MTS proposes that
Hysitron’s twenty-nine requests provide “more than ample” discovery. (See MTS Mem.
Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 18-19). The unfairness in the suggestion is self-evident.
3.

There is “Use In Commerce” of the HYSITRON Mark As a
Matter of Law.

The facts that MTS concedes demonstrate “use in commerce”:
Approximately two years ago, MTS obtained the keyword
“hysitron” from Google, which triggered MTS’ Sponsored Link
advertisement to appear on the search result page below the label
“Sponsored Link” when a user typed the term “hysitron” into the
search engine.
(MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 6; Johns Decl. ¶ 12.) As a matter of law, that
is “use in commerce” within the meaning of the Lanham Act. As held by Judge
Tunheim, “Based on the plain meaning of the Lanham Act, the purchase of search terms
is a use in commerce.” Edina Realty, Inc. v. TheMLSonline.com, 80 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA)
1039, *9-10 (D. Minn. 2006) (emphasis added). 3

3

MTS proffers an incorrect interpretation of Edina Realty, distinguishing on the
purported presence or absence of use of the mark in the sponsored link. (MTS’ Mem.
Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 10-11.) This interpretation is wrong:
The advertising text has changed over time. In spring 2005, plaintiff
persuaded Google to forbid defendant from using the phrase Edina Realty
in its advertising, which Google allowed for the two previous years.
12

Other Courts have reached a similar result on the question of “use in commerce.”
Buying for the Home, LLC v. Humble Abode, LLC, 459 F. Supp. 2d 310, 324 (D.N.J.
2006) (“[T]he alleged purchase of the keyword was a commercial transaction that
occurred ‘in commerce,’ trading on the value of Plaintiff’s mark.”); Google Inc. v. Am.
Blind & Wallpaper Factory, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32450 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 18,
2007) (“This Court thus concludes, as did the courts in GEICO, 800-JR Cigar, Humble
Abode, Edina Realty, and Wentworth, that the sale of trademarked terms in the [Google]
AdWords program is a use in commerce for the purposes of the Lanham Act.”); see also
Brookfield Communs., Inc. v. W. Coast Entm’t Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1064 (9th Cir.
1999) (finding Internet metatags to be a use in commerce).
There can be no dispute: “the purchase of search terms is a use in commerce.”
Edina Realty, 80 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1039, at *9-10. 4 MTS purchased HYSITRON as a
search term: it is a “use in commerce.” Id.

Edina Realty, 80 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1039, *4 n.1 (emphasis added). The opinion
specifically noted “Edina Realty” was not used in the sponsored link at the time of
decision. See id. How the trademark is used (or not) in the sponsored link bears on the
issue of likelihood of confusion. It is irrelevant to the issue of “use in commerce.” The
metatag cases, on which Judge Tunheim relied, underscore this conclusion. Misleading
metatags are invisible to the web surfer, but are visible (and misleading) to search
engines. Brookfield Communs., 174 F.3d at 1064.
4

Judge Tunheim rejected defendant’s argument that “its purchase of search terms is not a
‘use in commerce’ because there is no public promotion of the mark during the search
transaction.” Edina Realty, 80 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1039, at *9-10.
13

4.

MTS’ Confuses the Question of Confusion.

The question is not, as MTS contends, whether a “likelihood of confusion” existed
at the time of sale. The issue in a case of “initial interest confusion” is whether a
“defendant uses [a] plaintiff’s trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial
consumer attention.” Conversive, Inc. v. Conversagent, Inc., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1093
(C.D. Cal. 2006) (citing Nissan Motor Co. v. Nissan Computer Corp., 378 F.3d 1002,
1018-19 (9th Cir. 2004)). The Lanham Act protects against initial interest confusion
regardless of whether there is confusion at the time of purchase. Grotrian, Helfferich,
Schulz. TH. Steinweg NACHF. v. Steinway & Sons, 523 F.2d 1331, 1342 (2d. Cir.
1975).
Initial interest confusion may constitute trademark infringement even in the
absence of a consummated sale transaction. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. Penguin
Books USA, Inc., 109 F.3d 1394, 1405 (9th Cir. 1997) (finding initial interest confusion
where use of the mark “capture[s] initial consumer attention, even though no actual sale
is finally completed.”). Moreover, it is not obviated by the “sophistication and expertise”
of purchasers, as MTS would suggest. For example, in Grotrian, the Court commented
on the thought processes of potential buyers of “Steinweg” pianos:
Misled into an initial interest, a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy
himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good,
if not better, than a Steinway.
365 F. Supp. at 717. The Court then further commented on the harm of initial interest
confusion:

14

Deception and confusion thus work to appropriate [Steinway’s] good
will. This confusion, or mistaken beliefs as to the companies’
interrelationships, can destroy the value of the trademark which is
intended to point to only one company. Thus, the mere fact that
purchasers may be sophisticated or discriminating is not sufficient to
preclude the likelihood of confusion.
Id.
Moreover, the Courts have held that the “use of the Internet as a marketing tool
exacerbates the likelihood of confusion,” given that “entering a web site takes little effort
– usually one click from a linked site or a search engine’s list . . . .” PACAAR Inc. v.
TeleScan Technologies, LLC, 319 F.3d 243, 252 (6th Cir. 2003) (overruled on other
grounds) (quoting Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1057). Accordingly, “[w]eb surfers are more
likely to be confused” than would traditional “brick-and-mortar store” customers. Id.
The likelihood of confusion analysis in this initial interest confusion case is
complicated by MTS’ refusal to provide relevant discovery. Evidence of initial interest
confusion exists: if a user searches HYSITRON, but selects the “MTS Nano” link, it is
evidence of initial interest confusion. MTS, at a minimum, should have records from
Google detailing the number of clicks on its advertisements, when those clicks occurred,
and general information relating to where the clicks originated. MTS should also have
internal website statistics detailing information about who entered its website from
clicking on the Google advertisements, including the third party websites where the
Google advertisements appeared.
Information related to third party websites is just as relevant as the Google
statistics, because MTS’ advertisements are triggered on those third party websites based

15

on the HYSITRON mark. Document Request No. 22 lists examples of the third party
websites where Hysitron has located MTS’ advertisements. MTS should have the
records that show any other third party website. MTS’ refusal to provide the information
is inexcusable.
5.

MTS’ Evidence of Confusion.

Notwithstanding its refusal to produce relevant information that bears directly on
proof of confusion, MTS argues that Hysitron’s failure to prove actual confusion (while
MTS steadfastly withholds evidence) should be given substantial weight. (MTS’ Mem.
Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 11-12.) Ordinarily, “[b]ecause of the difficulty in garnering
. . . evidence [of actual confusion], the failure to prove instances of actual confusion is
not dispositive.” E.g., AMF, Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 353 (9th Cir. 1979).
In this case, any evidence of actual confusion is in MTS’ possession. It should be
required to respond to Hysitron’s discovery requests without further delay. To stonewall
discovery and then contend there is no proof is untenable.
6.

MTS’ Intent Argument Misses the Mark.

MTS’ argument on “intent” is misdirection. Undoubtedly it “intended” to
purchase HYSITRON as a keyword from Google. (MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot.
Ord. at 16.) But, the relevant intent is the intent to derive a benefit from the reputation of
another. Escercizio v. Roberts, 944 F.2d 1235, 1243 (6th Cir. 1991); accord SquirtCo v.
Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086, 1091 (8th Cir. 1980) (“Intent on the part of the alleged
infringer to pass off its goods as the product of another raises an inference of likelihood
of confusion . . . “). The documents in the possession of MTS, including internal MTS
16

communications, will be directly relevant to proving the “nefarious” or “bad” intent that
is probative in a trademark case. E.g., Tdata Inc. v. Aircraft Tech. Publrs., 411 F. Supp.
2d 901, 912 (S.D. Ohio 2006) (“nefarious” intent); Conversive, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1093
(“bad intent”).
MTS use of the HYSITRON mark “is not in a good faith, descriptive sense, but is
in a bad faith, bait-and-switch, create-initial-confusion sense.” Tdata, 411 F. Supp. 2d at
912. “[W]here the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another’s, there
is a presumption that the public will be deceived.” Conversive, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1093.
HYSITRON is a coined term and has no meaning other than as a trademark: the symbol
of the renown and reputation of Hysitron. Documents that bear on MTS’ subjective
intent when it purchased the HYSITRON mark from Google are absolutely key: those
documents should be produced. MTS’ motion for a protective order or, in the alternative,
a stay should be denied.
II.

ALTERNATIVE MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS.
In the alternative, MTS moves to stay these proceedings pending the outcome of

its dispositive motion. The power to stay proceedings is incidental to the Court’s power
to manage its docket, conserve judicial resources, and provide a just determination.
Kemp v. Tyson Seafood Group, Inc., 19 F. Supp. 2d 961, 964 (D. Minn. 1998). The
Court should decline to enter a stay: MTS continues to infringe, Hysitron seeks a valid
remedy, and MTS’ position on the merits is untenable. See Bruckelmyer, Case. No.
C 02-1761 DWF/RLE, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11024, *5-6 (declining to stay discovery
in favor of dispositive motions).
17

MTS’ proffered grounds for refusing discovery is its view of the merits: this is
legally insufficient. Moreover, MTS has failed to show likely success on the merits, or a
likely narrowing of issues. MTS continues to infringe the HYSITRON mark—even after
filing these motions. Its past and present use of the HYSITRON mark is a “use in
commerce,” and document discovery, including that directed at MTS’ bad intent, relates
directly to proof of likely confusion. See Edina Realty, 80 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1039, *910. MTS’ allegation that Hysitron’s claims are “without merit” is simply incorrect.
(MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 15.) MTS infringes. Hysitron is entitled to
an injunction.
MTS also notes the discovery period and suggests there is “ample time” for
discovery after summary judgment. (See MTS’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prot. Ord. at 15.)
This suggestion ignores the ongoing burden of delaying discovery, and the relevance of
this discovery to MTS’ pending dispositive motions. If MTS’ dispositive motion is not
denied outright, further discovery under Rule 56(f) seems likely. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
56(f). A stay of discovery might work to delay consideration of the motion for partial
summary judgment, by preventing discovery of the relevant facts.
The Court should deny MTS’ requested stay. MTS fails to proffer any basis for
staying discovery. MTS has already put off—through May—discovery propounded in
January. The Court should exercise its discretion to allow discovery to proceed.
