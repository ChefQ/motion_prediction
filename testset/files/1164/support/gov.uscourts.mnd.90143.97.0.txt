DEFENDANT’S
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN
SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
PROTECTIVE ORDER, OR IN
THE ALTERNATIVE, TO STAY
DISCOVERY PENDING
DISPOSITION OF MOTION FOR
PARTIAL SUMMARY
JUDGMENT, AND IN
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL

Defendant MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”) respectfully MTS seeks an order
protecting it from the oppression, undue burden, and expense imposed by Plaintiff
Hysitron Incorporated’s (“Hysitron”) Document Requests No. 5, 9, 13, and 16-17, and
22-42. MTS also opposes Hysitron’s Motion to Compel.1
INTRODUCTION
This Motion arises in a somewhat atypical context. Hysitron seeks broad and
costly document discovery regarding its trademark infringement claims even
though: 1) there was never any actual confusion from the alleged infringement; 2) MTS
has discontinued the conduct about which Hysitron complains; and, 3) there is no remedy
available or necessary because Hysitron cannot recover money damages and the claim for

injunctive relief is moot. Nevertheless, Hysitron proclaims it is “entitled” to proceed
with this extremely burdensome discovery, the majority of which is not only unnecessary,
but unjustifiable, in light of the real issues in this case.
This is a patent infringement case; however, Hysitron belatedly added trademark
claims and it seeks an injunction against a Sponsored Link Internet advertising program
that MTS has discontinued. Though Hysitron was aware of the program for over two
years, it never complained, much less sought a TRO or preliminary injunction. Hysitron
acknowledges that the ad program did not cause any actual confusion in the market, so it
is not entitled to money damages. Moreover, MTS has voluntarily discontinued the ad
program, so there is no need for an injunction. Curiously, when MTS offered to enter an
undertaking further confirming that it has no intent to resume the program, Hysitron
declined, instead pressing ahead with this needless litigation.
MTS has moved for partial summary judgment because its discontinued
Sponsored Link advertising was not, as a matter of law, “use in commerce” under the
Lanham Act and, therefore, did not infringe Hysitron’s mark.2 Moreover, Hysitron
cannot recover money damages because there is no evidence of actual confusion. It is
also clear that the ad program, when it ran, was not likely to have caused any confusion
in the market, so Hysitron is not entitled to an injunction. The fact that MTS has
discontinued the ad program and offered to enter an undertaking to that effect further
demonstrates that injunctive relief is unwarranted and unavailable. The absence of any

Montgomery on May 29, 2008.

damages or legitimate threat of irreparable harm, coupled with Hysitron’s refusal of
MTS’ offer to enter an undertaking, suggests an ulterior purpose for these claims.
Hysitron has disclosed that ulterior and improper purpose—it is not pursuing these claims
for a substantive purpose; i.e., to recover damages for past injury or to prevent future
harm, but rather, to recover attorneys’ fees.

In these circumstances, Hysitron’s far

reaching and irrelevant discovery requests can only be intended to oppress MTS and to
saddle it with undue burden and expense. Accordingly, the Court should grant MTS’s
Motion for Protective Order.
Alternatively, should the Court elect not to grant MTS’ Motion for Protective
Order in its entirety, the Court should stay discovery on these claims until Judge
Montgomery has ruled on MTS’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.
Finally, even if Hysitron’s trademark claims had any legitimacy and its related
discovery requests had some proper purpose, the vast majority of the requests are
duplicative, overbroad, unduly burdensome, or not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. And as for those few requests that may arguably be
deemed even tangentially relevant, the burden and expense of production far outweighs
any possible benefit they could bring to the case. For each of these reasons, MTS
opposes Hysitron’s Motion to Compel.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Hysitron served its Second Set of Requests for Production of Documents and
Things to Defendant MTS on January 4, 2008. (Declaration of Brian Platt in Support of
Motion to Compel Documents (“Platt Decl.”) ¶ 4.) MTS served responses and objections
-3-

on February 22, 2008. (Platt Decl. Ex. 3.) In relevant part, MTS objected to Document
Requests 5, 9, 13, and 16-17, and 22-42 as being overly broad, unduly burdensome,
vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.3
Counsel for MTS met and conferred with counsel for Hysitron on March 27, 2008.
(Platt Decl. ¶ 6.) MTS informed Hysitron that the above identified requests were far
beyond the realm of relevant information and that if they were not withdrawn, MTS
would seek a protective order. Hysitron refused to withdraw the requests and indicated it
planned to move to compel. Accordingly, MTS requested that counsel for the parties
work together to schedule the respective motions. Counsel for Hysitron agreed, but then
inexplicably obtained a hearing date without informing MTS until the day initial briefs
were due. The parties have since agreed that MTS’ Motion for a Protective Order and
Hysitron’s Motion to Compel will be heard on the same day, May 1, 2008.
BACKGROUND
A. The Relevant Market.
Hysitron and MTS each manufacture and market nanomechanical test instruments.
(Compl. at ¶ 18.) These highly sophisticated research instruments are purchased by
university, industry and government research facilities for very specialized nano research
and development projects. (Declaration of Margaret Johns previously filed under seal in

3

MTS has now agreed to respond to Document Requests 10 and 18-21. Thus, these
Requests are no longer part of this Motion.
-4-

Support of Defendant’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (“Johns Decl.”) ¶¶ 4-5.)4
Both Hysitron and MTS have established reputations and are well-known in the narrow
field of nanomechanical research. (Id. ¶ 3.) These instruments cannot be purchased over
the Internet. (Id. ¶ 4; Affidavit of David P. Pearson previously filed under seal in Support
of Defendant’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (“Pearson Aff.”) Ex. A (Pl.’s
Resp. to Def.’s First Set of Discovery Reqs. (“Adm. Nos.”) 27-30.)5 The sales cycle for
the Nano Vision™ device made by MTS is at least six months long and is often over a
year in length. (Johns Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.) During this process prospective purchasers, who are
typically persons with advanced degrees in engineering or similar fields, engage in a
lengthy due diligence process before buying one of these products. (Johns Decl. ¶ 5.)
This process involves substantial, direct contact between the customer and MTS over
many months or years during which MTS and the customer determine the features of the
instrument that would be appropriate for the customer given its particular research needs.
(Id. ¶¶ 7-9.) MTS’ product information about the Nano Vision™ product contains MTS’
name and logo and very clearly identifies MTS as the manufacturer of the device. (Id.
Ex. 1.) Potential purchasers are well-informed about the source (manufacturer) of the
product through substantial direct contact with MTS and through the receipt of MTS’
product information and product quote before the product is purchased. (Id. ¶¶ 3-10 and
Exs. 1, 2.)

B. MTS’ Keyword-Based Sponsored Link Advertising.
Approximately two years ago, MTS obtained the keyword “hysitron” from
Google, which triggered MTS’ Sponsored Link advertisement to appear on the searchresult page below the label “Sponsored Link” when a user typed the term “hysitron” into
the search engine.6

(Compl. ¶¶ 32, 34.)

Importantly, a search using the keyword

“hysitron” does not simply take a user directly to Hysitron’s website or a website
authorized by Hysitron. Rather, it produces an organic search-result list that may include
web pages administered by Hysitron, discussing Hysitron, or perhaps even criticizing
Hysitron, or any web page with the word “Hysitron” in its text, such as an article or
“blog.”

6

Google operates a widely-used Internet search engine through which consumers
can search for, among other things, websites offering information about products and
services.
Google’s “AdWords” service allows customers to arrange for their
advertisements to appear on Google’s search results page in response to a user’s search
query. Internet search engines enable users to locate websites by keying in terms
(“keywords”) and performing searches on the search-engine database. (Compl. ¶ 25.) In
response to a keyword search, search engines produce both organic- and sponsored-result
lists of websites. (Id. ¶ 26.) Organic-result lists match the user’s keyword to data on a
particular website. (Id.) Sponsored-result lists match keywords purchased by advertisers
to data on a particular website. (Id. ¶ 27.)
Search engines use sponsored-result lists as a way to generate revenue. (Id.)
When a user’s keyword matches a keyword purchased by an advertiser, a clearly titled
“Sponsored Link” advertisement may appear on the search-result page. (Id. ¶ 29.) This
“Sponsored Link” section appears on the same page, but separate from the organic-result
list, and it is generally shaded differently than the organic-result list. Google’s customers
may select certain search terms that, if entered by a user, will return search results in a
separate section titled “Sponsored Links.” The “Sponsored Links” section identifies and
provides a link to the customer’s website, and provides a limited amount of advertising
text. For additional discussion, see Int’l Profit Assocs., Inc. v. Paisola, 461 F. Supp. 2d
672, 676 (N.D. Ill. 2006), and Government Employees Ins. Co (“GEICO”) v. Google,
Inc., No. 1:04CV507, 2005 WL 1903128, at *2 (E.D. Va. Aug. 8, 2005).
-6-

During the period in which MTS utilized a Sponsored Link with the keyword
“hysitron,” MTS’ Sponsored Link advertisement did not display Hysitron’s mark in its
title, heading, text, or any other portion of the advertisement seen by the user. (Johns
Decl. ¶ 12; Pearson Aff. Ex. B (Pl.’s Responses to Def.’s 2d Set of Discovery Reqs.),
Adm. Nos. 39-46.) Thus, when a user performed a search under the keyword “hysitron,”
she or he would be presented with an organic-list of potentially relevant websites and a
separate Sponsored Link advertisement of MTS’ products that did not display the word
“hysitron” in any manner whatsoever. An Internet user observing MTS’ Sponsored Link
saw only MTS’ name and logo, and never saw any reference to “Hysitron” or its
products. (Johns Decl. ¶ 12.)
C. Hysitron’s Trademark Claims.
Hysitron’s trademark claims are based exclusively on its allegation that MTS
former use of the keyword “hysitron” in its Sponsored Link advertising infringed
Hysitron’s mark. (Compl. At ¶¶ 18-39, 40, 44, 49, 55.) However, a Sponsored Link
advertisement that does not depict or display the contested mark in any way cannot
constitute trademark infringement. See Part II, infra.
Earlier this year, MTS voluntarily discontinued the ad program involving the word
“hysitron.” (Johns Decl. ¶ 12.) It also offered, in good faith, to enter an undertaking
agreeing not to resume the “hysitron” keyword Sponsored Link advertising in the future.
Although no formal undertaking was entered between the parties, MTS has no plans to
resume the “hysitron” keyword Sponsored Link advertising in the future. (Id.)

-7-

Hysitron has acknowledged that it has no evidence of any actual confusion caused
by the Sponsored Link advertisement in the past. (Pearson Aff. Ex. B (Pl.’s Responses
to Def.’s 2d Set of Discovery Reqs.), Interr. No. 20.) Similarly, MTS no evidence of
actual confusion in the marketplace, and it is unaware of any past likelihood of confusion.
(Johns Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.)

Notwithstanding the absence of any past confusion or risk of

future confusion, Hysitron has persisted with its trademark claims, seeking to enjoin
activity that is neither presently occurring nor likely to occur in the future. Hysitron has
propounded voluminous, far-reaching discovery requests based solely on these “gonowhere” claims. Because these claims cannot lead to any meaningful recovery, the
discovery requests can only have been propounded to place an undue burden on MTS.
Thus, MTS respectfully moves for a protective order and opposes Hysitron’s Motion to
Compel.
ARGUMENT
I. LEGAL STANDARD
A. Protective Orders.
The Rules of Civil Procedure provide that “[t]he court may, for good cause, issue
an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or
undue burden and expense … .” Fed R. Civ. P. 26(c). “Because of liberal discovery and
the potential for abuse, district courts have broad discretion ‘to decide when a protective
order is appropriate and what degree of protection is required.” Pecarina v. Tokai Corp.,
2002 WL 1023153, at *8 (D. Minn. May 20, 2002) (citing Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,
467 U.S. 20, 34 (1984)). “Pursuant to Rule 26(c), a court may fashion ‘any order which
-8-

justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression,
or undue burden or expense’ upon good cause shown.’” Id.
B. Motions to Stay Discovery.
As noted, the Court has broad discretion over matters of discovery. See Kramer v.
NCS Pearson, Inc., 2003 WL 21640495, at *1 & 3 (D. Minn. June 30, 2003). This
includes broad latitude to decide whether, and when, to stay discovery. See id. at 3.
Where, as here, the expense or hardship of proceeding with discovery is substantial and
the potential harm of a delay is minimal, a stay of discovery may be warranted. See
Intermedics, Inc. v. Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., 1998 WL 35253495, at *2 (D. Minn. June
15, 1998).
C. Objections to Improper Discovery.
Even in the absence of a protective order, a party may oppose improper discovery
requests by timely serving objections.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) and 34(b)(2)(C).

Thereafter, the Court may limit discovery in the following manner:
“[o]n motion or on its, own, the court must limit the frequency or
extent of discovery otherwise allowed by [the] rules or by local rule if it
determines that:
(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more
convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.
***
(iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery
outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the
amount in controversy, the parties resources, the importance of the
issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in
resolving the issues.

II.

THE COURT SHOULD GRANT MTS’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE
ORDER
A. Hysitron’s Trademark Claims Are Devoid of Merit and Afford No Remedy.
MTS is entitled to a protective order relieving it of the burden and expense of this

needless and onerous discovery. These requests cannot have been propounded for a
proper purpose because the underlying claims are clearly defective. Moreover, even if
Hysitron could possibly prevail, there is no meaningful remedy to be had at the end of the
day. Thus, this is clearly vexatious litigation pursued for an improper purpose.
First, the claims have no merit.

MTS’ now discontinued Sponsored Link

advertisement did not constitute a “use in commerce” as defined by the Lanham Act
because it did not display Hysitron’s mark in the ad. See Merck & Co v. MediPlan
Health Consulting, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 2d 402, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); Rescuecom Corp. v.
Google, Inc., 456 F. Supp. 2d 393, 403 (N.D.N.Y. 2006); Site Pro-1, Inc. v. Better Metal,
L.L.C., 506 F. Supp. 2d 123 (E.D.N.Y. 2007); FragranceNet.com, Inc. v.
FragrenceX.com, Inc., 493 F. Supp. 2d 545 (E.D.N.Y. 2007); Nautilus Grp., Inc. v. Icon
Health & Fitness, Inc., No. C02-2420RSM, 2006 WL 3761367 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 21,
2006); c.f. Hamzik v. Zale Corp., No. 3:06-cv-1300, 2007 WL 1174863 at *3 (N.D.N.Y.
April 19, 2007) (finding “use” where plaintiff’s mark did appear on displays associated
with the goods ); and Edina Realty v. The MLSOnline.com, 2006 WL 737064 (D. Minn.
Mar. 20, 2006) (finding use in case where mark appeared in Sponsored Link
advertisement).

- 10 -

Second, even if the Sponsored Link advertisement was considered a Lanham Act
use, the ad—when it ran—cannot be said to have been likely to have substantially
confused an appreciable number of Hysitron’s and MTS’ highly sophisticated customers.
See Gateway, Inc. v. Companion Prods., 384 F.3d 503, 509 (8th Cir. 2004); Children’s
Factory v. Benee’s Toys, 160 F.3d 489, 494 (8th Cir. 1998). Under the Eighth Circuit’s
six-factor likelihood of confusion analysis, see SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086,
1089 (8th Cir. 1980), purchasers of this highly specialized, expensive test equipment
could not have been likely to have been confused by an ad that did not even contain the
word “hysitron.” See Perini Corp. v. Perini Constr. Inc., 915 F.2d 121, 127 (4th Cir.
1990) (“the sophistication and expertise of usual purchasers can preclude any likelihood
of confusion”); Mars Musical Adv., Inc. v. Mars, Inc., 159 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1153 (D.
Minn. 2001) (noting that likelihood of confusion is lessened where goods are costly and
purchasers expend greater time choosing between competing products). Where, as here,
purchasers are sophisticated and knowledgeable, products are extremely expensive, and
the sales cycle is months or years long, a claim that confusion is likely cannot be
sustained.
Moreover, “when determining whether there exists a likelihood of confusion,
weight is given to the number and extent of instances of actual confusion.” Duluth NewsTribune, 84 F.3d at 1099 (quoting Life Techs., Inc. v. Gibbco Sci., Inc., 826 F.2d 775, 777
(8th Cir. 1987)). The lack of actual confusion is a “strong indicator” of a lack of a
likelihood of confusion. Plus Prods. v. Plus Discount Foods, Inc., 722 F.2d 999, 1006
(2d Cir. 1983); The Nautilus Group, Inc. v. Savvier, Inc., 427 F. Supp. 2d 990, 997 (W.D.
- 11 -

Wash. 2006); Nabisco v. Warner-Lambert Co., 32 F. Supp. 2d 690, 699 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).
Where, as here, there was no actual confusion whatsoever, it defies reason to suggest that
purchasers were, nonetheless, likely to have been confused.
Finally, as noted above, even if MTS’ Sponsored Link advertisement was a use
under the Lanham Act, and even if the ad could somehow be deemed to have been likely
to confuse an appreciable number of consumers when it ran (despite that utter lack of any
actual confusion), the sole remedy available to Hysitron would be an injunction. But
MTS has voluntarily discontinued the program and has no intent to resume it in the
future. Where allegedly infringing conduct has ceased and is unlikely to recur, the need
for an injunction is moot. See Schutt Mfg. Co. v. Riddell, Inc., 673 F.2d 202, 207 (7th
Cir. 1982) (equitable relief inappropriate were defendant “did not threaten to persist in or
resume the allegedly infringing or unfair conduct”). That is the case here. Moreover,
when MTS offered to enter an undertaking precluding any future resurrection of the ad
program, Hysitron declined, inexplicably perpetuating this needless but expensive
litigation.
B. Hysitron’s Trademark Claims and This Discovery Have Been Brought for an
Improper Purpose.
Hysitron’s persistence in the face of these facts, and particularly, MTS’ voluntary
discontinuation of the program, raises serious questions about Hysitron’s purpose in
pursuing these claims. Hysitron has propounded literally dozens of complex discovery
requests purportedly in pursuit of a meritless claim that, even if successful, could yield
nothing more than an unnecessary injunction against conduct that is not occurring or

- 12 -

likely to occur in the future—and this in the face of MTS’ offer to enter an undertaking
for Hysitron’s benefit.
The reason Hysitron persists in this litigation is not a mystery. Hysitron has
admitted its true motive for continuing the litigation and this expansive discovery. In the
absence of any actual damages in the past and the impossibility of any actual damages in
the future because the Sponsored Link no longer exists, Hysitron says it is “entitled” to
pursue the infringement claims to recover attorneys’ fees. (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot.
Compel at 3.) In other words, it wants to continue this costly litigation and send MTS the
bill. That strategy does not provide a proper basis for these discovery requests.
Given that astonishing admission, Hysitron’s discovery requests can only have
been brought to annoy, oppress and cause MTS undue burden and expense, and they
cannot be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. A
showing that discovery is not relevant satisfies the “good cause” requirement of Rule
26(c)(1) and a protective order may be issued to proscribe the discovery of irrelevant
material. Smith v. Dowson, 158 F.R.D. 138, 140 (D. Minn. 1994) (citing Moore’s Fed.
Pract., ¶ 26.24; Navel Orange Admin. Committee v. Exeter Orange Co., 722 F.2d 449
(9th Cir. 1983)). Under these circumstances, the Court should exercise its inherent power
to prevent this needless, wasteful, and expensive discovery by granting MTS’s Motion
for Protective Order.

- 13 -

III. ALTERNATIVELY, THE COURT SHOULD STAY THIS DISCOVERY
PENDING RESOLUTION OF MTS’ SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION.
The Rules of Civil Procedure are to be interpreted “to secure the just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. To
effectuate this purpose, the Court has the inherent authority to manage its docket, cases,
and interlocutory orders. See Intermedics, Inc. v. Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., 1998 WL
35253495, at *2 (D. Minn. June 15, 1998) (citing Landis v. North Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248,
254 (1936)). The Court has particularly broad discretion over matters of discovery,
including the authority to stay discovery. See Kramer v. NCS Pearson, Inc., 2003 WL
21640495, at *1 & 3 (D. Minn. June 30, 2003). “[W]hen ruling on a Motion to Stay, ‘the
Court must weigh the competing interest: i.e., the possible damage of granting a stay
versus the hardship or inequity of forcing a case onward.’” Intermedics, Inc., 1998 WL
35253495, at *3 (quoting Clintec Nutrition Co. v. Abbott Laboratories, 1995 WL 228988,
at *1 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 1995)); see also Riehm v. Engelking, 2006 WL 2085404, at *1
(D. Minn. July 25, 2006) (holding that stay of discovery pending summary judgment
would not damage the plaintiff). Courts also generally consider the strength of the
moving party’s showing that the underlying claims are unmeritorious and the breadth of
the requested discovery and the burden of responding to those requests. See In re
Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., 2002 WL 88278, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22,
2002).
Here, each of these factors weighs in favor of a stay. In Riehm, the court found
that good cause existed for a stay, stating, “it is likely that the Court’s ruling on the

- 14 -

dispositive motions will narrow the issues in this case and obviate the need for some
discovery.” Id. at *2. The court also noted that even if the dispositive motions did not
entirely dispose of the case, there was no harm that would result from the stay. Id. MTS
similarly has a pending motion for partial summary judgment motion on Hysitron’s
trademark claims. For the reasons discussed above, Hysitron’s trademark claims are
utterly without merit or any possibility of providing relief. Thus, it is likely that the
ruling on MTS’ Motion will “obviate the need” for the disputed discovery. Riehm, 2006
WL 2085404, at *2.

And, as discussed in detail below, the disputed requests are

sweeping in scope, creating a substantial burden on MTS.

See In re Currency

Conversion Fee, 2002 WL 88278, at *1. Finally, the Scheduling Order in this case does
not require fact discovery to be completed until November 1, 2008. Thus, a stay will
result in no harm to Hysitron because there would be ample time to complete this
discovery is Judge Montgomery was to deny any part of the Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment.
Accordingly, if the Court determines not to grant MTS’s Motion for Protective
Order, it should stay this discovery pending a resolution of the Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment.
IV. MTS’ OPPOSITION TO HYSITON’S MOTION TO COMPEL
In conjunction with its Motion for Protective Order, MTS also opposes Hysitron’s
Motion to Compel. There are two fundamental bases for MTS’s opposition to Hysitron’s
Motion: 1) the vast majority of the requests are duplicative, overly broad, unduly
burdensome or not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence;
- 15 -

and, 2) to the extent that any of the requests are even marginally proper, the expense and
burden the requests impose far outweighs any probative benefit they may confer with
respect to any controverted issue.
A. Hysitron’s Requests Are Overly Broad, Unduly Burdensome, and Not
Reasonably Calculated to Lead to the Discovery of Admissible Evidence, and
its Purported Justifications for the Requests Fail.
Hysitron has proffered three broad justifications, albeit in varying textual forms,
for the discovery it seeks. First, it claims the discovery is relevant to the purported intent
and willfulness of MTS which supports Hysitron’s claim that this is an exceptional case.
Second, it claims the discovery is relevant to determining their patent damages. Third, it
claims the discovery is relevant to the likelihood of confusion analysis.

None of these

justifications can be sustained.
1. Hysitron’s “Exceptional Case” Justification.
Hysitron attempts to justify almost every disputed request on the grounds that it is
related to its “exceptional case” theory and its attempt to prove “intent” or “willfulness.”
This argument is specious for multiple reasons. There is no dispute that MTS was aware
of Hysitron and intentionally purchased the term “hysitron” for its Sponsored Link
advertisement. Thus, MTS’ intent to obtain this term as a keyword for its Sponsored
Link advertisement is not a disputed issue.
Moreover, documents concerning MTS’ “intent” and/or “willfulness” are not
relevant because, as a matter of law, MTS’ conduct could not constitute an exceptional
case. Numerous courts around the country have held that use of another’s mark in
connection with a Sponsored Link advertisement is permissible, where the trademark

- 16 -

does not appear in ad. (Supra, Part II.) These cases provide ample legal justification for
MTS’ conduct, necessarily defeating any suggestion that this is an “exceptional case.”
CJC Holdings, Inc. v. Wright & Lato, Inc., 979 F.2d 60, 65-66 (5th Cir. 1992); Buca di
Bacco, Inc. v. Buca di Bacc’, Inc., 828 F. Supp. 31, 32 (S.D. Tex. 1993). Thus, Hysitron
cannot show that these requests are relevant to either MTS’s intent or a theory of willful
infringement and the requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.
2. Hysitron’s “Market Information” and “Patent Damages” Justifications.
Hysitron broadly asserts that most of the disputed requests are germane to its
alleged patent infringement damages and the market for the alleged infringing product.
This is a curious explanation, since Hysitron previously propounded multiple requests
seeking vast amounts of information on this very subject. In response, MTS has already
produced more than enough information for Hysitron to determine the characteristics of
the marketplace and to analyze its alleged patent damages. Moreover, as Hysitron has
admitted, there is no real dispute about the relevant marketplace. (See Hysitron’s Mem.
Supp. Mot. Compel at 13.) Undeterred by these facts or the cumulative, burdensome
nature of its requests, Hysitron asserts that it is entitled to “prove its case” by forcing
MTS to respond to this unnecessary discovery. (Hysitron Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at
13.)

This is nothing more than an abuse of the discovery process.

And despite

Hysitron’s attempt to justify the requests on that basis, the majority of the disputed
requests are not related to its alleged “patent damages” in any case.

- 17 -

a.)

MTS has already produced documents sufficient to identify the
relevant market and analyze any alleged patent damages.

Hysitron’s purports to justify its overbroad discovery requests as somehow
remotely related to the “totality of the circumstances” relevant to patent damages. This
fails because in response to previous requests, MTS has already produced or agreed to
produce more than sufficient documents for Hysitron to analyze its alleged patent
damages. Hysitron previously served 29 discovery requests encompassing all of the
information necessary for its patent claims. (Affidavit of Brent A. Lorentz in Opposition
of Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel (“Lorentz Aff”) Ex. 1 (Def. Resp. Pl. First Set of Req.
Prod. Doc.)) These earlier requests sought, among other things:
(1)

a specimen of each advertisement, marketing and promotional
materials;

(2)

documents sufficient to identify every sale of the allegedly
infringing devices;

(3)

documents sufficient to show the gross, operating, and net revenues
relating to MTS’ sales of the allegedly infringing devices;

(4)

documents sufficient to show the gross, operating, and net profits
relating to MTS’ sales of allegedly infringing devices;

(5)

documents sufficient to show costs relating to MTS’ manufacture
and sale of the allegedly infringing devices;

(6)

documents and things relating to market share analysis, including
but not limited to analysis of the market size, numbers of products in
the market, number of competitors in the market, market share per
product or competitor, or market growth; and

(7)

documents sufficient to identify all products available on the market
that compete with the allegedly infringing devices.

- 18 -

(See id., MTS’ Resp. Hysitron’s First Set of Doc. Req. Nos. 5-6, 13, 17-22.)) These
documents are more than ample to calculate Hysitron’s lost profits claim.
b) MTS has agreed to produce additional documents in response to
Hysitron’s Second Set of Document Requests.
Additionally, in response to Hysitron’s Second Set of Document Requests, MTS
agreed during the meet and confer to produce documents sufficient to show (1) “the
characteristics of Defendants’ customers and prospective customers to which MTS
markets or plans to market” the accused devices; (2) documents sufficient “to identify
and describe the target or intended customers of” MTS’ accused devices; (3) documents
sufficient “to identify the classes of persons who make the decisions to purchase” MTS’
accused devices; (4) documents sufficient to show “the types of purchasers, end users,
expected purchasers, or expected end users” of MTS’ accused devices. (See Hysitron’s
Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 1, Hysitron’s Second Set of Document Req. Nos. 11, 12, 14,
and 15.) Even though Hysitron agrees there is no dispute about the market or the
customers, MTS has agreed to respond to this discovery. Clearly, the documents that
MTS has already produced and agreed to produce are sufficient to identify the market for
the product at issue in the patent case, the customers for that product and other relevant
information related to patent damages.

MTS objects to further duplicative and

unnecessary discovery on the same issues.
c)

Hysitron’s demand for this discovery is inconsistent with the position
it took in objecting to MTS’ discovery requests.

Hysitron itself already limited the scope of relevant discovery when it opposed
MTS’s earlier Motion to Compel. That motion was heard on December 10, 2007. MTS
- 19 -

sought, among other things, the production of any documents concerning “[a]ll
projections, forecasts, market share reports and forecasts, marketing acceptance
documents, business plans, strategic plans, fiscal plans, marketing strategies and plans
relating to the sale and anticipated sale of scanned probe microscope apparatuses,
microindentation apparatuses, surface imaging apparatuses, and/or multi-plate capacitor
systems.” (Order on Def. Mot. Compel Disc. (“Order”), Doc. No. 72, at 7-9.) MTS
made arguments very similar to those advanced by Hysitron here, specifically, that such
documents were relevant to Hysitron’s damages claims for patent infringement. Id.
In opposing that motion, Hysitron argued the request was “hopelessly overbroad.”
(Hysitron Mem. Opp’n MTS Mot. Compel at 14.) Hysitron specifically argued that it
had already agreed to produce “documents sufficient to assess the sales, revenues, costs,
and profits attributable to Hysitron’s commercial embodiments of the inventions claimed
in the patents-in-suit,” market share analyses from 1992 to the present for scanned probe
microscope apparatuses, and communications with all potential purchaser of its products.
(Id. at 14-15.) In Hysitron’s words, the limited information it had agreed to produce
would “fully enable MTS to perform” the lost profits analysis. (Id. at 15.) MTS has
already produced or agreed to produce this same category of documents. Nothing more
is required.
Hysitron also argued that the only discovery necessary for its trademark claim
were “advertisements, brochures, marketing materials, documents sufficient to identify its
targeted market, and communications with all potential purchasers of its commercial
embodiment of the patents-in-suit” and documents concerning the “distinctiveness,
- 20 -

reputation, and recognition” of the HYSITRON mark.

(Id.)

The Court accepted

Hysitron’s position. (Order at 7-9.) Hysitron cannot have it both ways. MTS has
produced documents and information comparable in kind and scope to the documents
Hysitron successfully argued were sufficient for the damages analysis. The Court has
already narrowed the scope of this discovery and its ruling should apply here as well.
3. Hysitron’s “Likelihood of Confusion” Justification.
As discussed more fully above, Hysitron has persisted with this litigation despite
the acknowledged absence of any actual confusion, and despite the discontinuation of the
Sponsored Link advertising. Even if Hysitron was entitled to some discovery on its
fatally defective trademark claims, it cannot be entitled to discovery that goes far beyond
the narrow issue that the trademark claims present. The only even remotely relevant
trademark issue is whether an appreciable number of Hysitron’s and MTS’s customers,
were likely to have been confused by MTS’s Sponsored Link advertisement when it was
in place.
Courts traditionally apply a six-factor test to determine whether allegedly
infringing conduct may be likely to cause confusion. SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d
1086, 1089 (8th Cir. 1980). These include: 1) whether the degree of purchaser care can
eliminate any likelihood of confusion which would otherwise exist; 2) the strength of the
owner’s mark; 3) the similarity between the owner’s mark and the alleged infringer’s
mark; 4) the degree to which the products compete with each other; 5) the alleged
infringer’s intent to pass off its goods as those of the trademark owner; and, 6) incidents
of actual confusion. Id.
- 21 -

Hysitron asserts that virtually all of the disputed requests are relevant to this
analysis, but in reality, almost none of them are probative of the Squirtco factors. Indeed,
the most of these factors require no document discovery at all. For example, the degree
of purchaser care, the strength of the mark in question, the similarity between the
Hysitron’s mark and the MTS’s mark, the degree of competition between them, and the
lack of intent of MTS to “pass off its goods” are clearly undisputed issues. Thus,
Hysitron’s broad and overreaching discovery requests cannot be justified on this basis
and its Motion to Compel should be denied.
B. Any Requests That Are Not Overbroad or Unduly Burdensome or May Be
Marginally Calculated to Lead to the Discovery of Admissible Evidence Must
Be Limited to the Extent the Cost and Burden They Impose Outweighs the
Likely Benefit of Production,
Pursuant to Rule 26(b)(2)(C), the Court must limit the scope of discovery
otherwise allowed where “the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its
likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties’
resources, the importance of the issue at stake in the action, and the importance of the
discovery resolving the issues.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(iii). “[E]ven though the
standard of relevancy for discovery purposes is a liberal one the parties should not be
permitted to roam in shadow zones of relevancy and to explore matter which does not
presently appear germane on the theory that it might become so.” Smith v. Dowson, 158
F.R.D. 138, 142 (D. Minn. 1994).
In this case, Hysitron seeks unfettered freedom to explore the “shadow zone.” In
light of the discovery undertaken to date and the true issues in the case, Hysitron’s

- 22 -

current requests bear little relationship to any truly disputed matter. Given the marginal
relationship of these requests to the issues needing resolution, the burden of producing
responses far outweighs any conceivable benefit they may confer. As noted, MTS has
already produced vast amounts of information and reams of documents. Further, MTS
has agreed to produce additional documents, more than sufficiently address the disputed
issues in the case. Many of the disputed requests are duplicative or cumulative and others
simply cannot advance the ball.
By way of example, in its Document Request No 22, Hysitron seeks:
All documents that relate to Defendant’s advertising with search engine and
third party websites, including but not limited to Google.com and its
affiliates, Mapquest.com, AOL.com, Yahoo.com, Info.com, IXquick.com,
Netscape.com,
PepeSearch.com,
Wondir.com,
Vivisimo.com,
Webcrawler.com, About.com, Ask.com, Dogpile.com, Hotbot.com,
Lycos.com, Mamma.com, IWON.com, Aeiwi.com, Excite.com,
Gimenei.com,
Sputtr.com,
Nanovip.com,
macraesbluebook.com,
Azonano.com, Stormingmedia.us, and Clusty.com (hereinafter “Third Party
Websites” (this definition is not limited to the examples provided)).
This Request has virtually nothing to do with the analysis of alleged damages,
such as potentially lost sales or sales of the allegedly infringing product, product cost, or
the nature of the market. Moreover, the Request, which seeks “all documents” that relate
to MTS’ advertising with search engines and Third Party Websites, is “hopelessly
overbroad.” It is not reasonably tailored to the issues it purportedly addresses. It is not
limited to keyword advertising or the term “hysitron.”

The probative and relevant

documents have already been produced, and the cost and burden of responding to this
Request far outweighs any benefit the discovery could possibly provide, particularly in

- 23 -

light of the documents MTS has already produced. Many other requests suffer this very
same flaw.
Therefore, to the extent that the Court does not grant MTS’ Motion for Protective
Order or for a Stay, and it deems any of these requests to be allowable under the Rules,
MTS respectfully requests that the Court limit their scope to information that might
legitimately help to resolve a material issue that is legitimately in dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(b)(2)(C)(iii).
C. The Specific Requests in Dispute.
REQUEST NO. 5:
All Documents referring or relating to any formal or informal trademark searches or
investigations that relate to Plaintiff’s HYSITRON mark.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims this Request is relevant to the trademark claims because it relates
to likelihood of confusion and willful or deliberate infringement and is relevant to patent
damages. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 11-12.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
This Request is not probative at all of the likelihood of confusion issue and says nothing
about willfulness because Hysitron has already admitted that it does not own any
trademark registrations for the HYSITRON mark, thus a trademark search would not
have produced anything. Additionally, “trademark searches and investigations” are not
probative of Hysitron’s patent infringement damages (lost profits claim) which is based
on actual lost sales.
- 24 -

REQUEST NO.9:
All Documents relating to descriptions of the normal channels of trade for distribution of
Defendant’s nanomechanical test instruments and related services.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims this Request is relevant to patent damages because it relates to the
market segment in which Hysitron and MTS compete, that it is relevant to its trademark
claims because the claims need to be considered with regard to “normal channels of
trade,” and willfulness. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 13-14.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
Hysitron’s patent damage justification fails because MTS has already produced, among
other things, documents sufficient to show “the types of purchasers, end users, expected
purchasers, or expected end users” of MTS’ accused devices.” (See Hysitron’s Mem.
Supp. Mot. Compel at 1, Hysitron’s Second Set of Document Req. Nos. 15.) The
Request is thus duplicative.

To the extent “normal channels of trade” could be

interpreted to include more than what MTS has already produced, it is overbroad.
Hysitron does not explain how “descriptions of normal channels of trade” could
conceivably contain evidence of MTS’ intent. Further, the cost and burden of responding
far outweighs any probative value of this information, particularly in light of the
documents MTS has agreed to produce.
REQUEST NO. 13:
Documents sufficient to identify the market Defendant intends to target based on its
marketing, promoting, and advertising using the term “hysitron.”

- 25 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims this Request is relevant to its patent damages and likelihood of
confusion analysis because it will establish that MTS and Hysitron compete in the same
market segment, and because it relates to willfulness. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot.
Compel at 14-15.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
This Request is duplicative because MTS has already produced or agreed to produce
documents sufficient to show the characteristics of Defendants’ customers and
prospective customers to which MTS markets or plans to market the accused devices, and
documents sufficient to identify and describe the target or intended customers of MTS’
accused devices. (See Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 1, Hysitron’s Second Set
of Document Req. Nos. 11, 12.) To the extent Request No. 13 could be interpreted to
include more than what MTS has already produced, it is overbroad. Further, the intended
market has nothing to do with willfulness. Finally, there is really no dispute that MTS
and Hysitron compete in the same market. Hence, the cost and burden of responding to
this Request outweighs the likely benefit.
REQUEST NO.16:
All documents relating to the manner in which Defendant’s customers or prospective
customers come to the decision to purchase Defendant’s nanomechanical test
instruments, including, but not limited to, documents identifying the types of people who
made these decisions, their job responsibilities, and the procedures and basis under which
they made these decisions.

- 26 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to the likelihood of confusion,
ostensibly because it relates to the market. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 16.)
Hysitron also claims that this Request is relevant to whether this is an exceptional case
because it may demonstrate that MTS intended to take advantage of “quick-click
purchasers.” (Id.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
This Request is duplicative. MTS has already agreed to produce documents sufficient to
identify actual and intended customers. With respect to the willfulness justification,
Hysitron’s assertion that MTS may have intended to take advantage of “quick-click
purchasers” is entirely irrelevant to the current case because it is undisputed that MTS
and Hysitron do not sell there products online. Moreover, the nature of the products at
issue make “quick-click purchasing” a facially absurd argument.

This isn’t

“Amazon.com;” these precision scientific instruments cost tens to hundreds of thousands
of dollars and are purchased in a sales process lasting months or years. Hysitron has
admitted that the purchasers of these instruments are sophisticated individuals. Thus,
beyond what MTS has already agreed to produce, this Request is not likely to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 17:
All documents relating to Defendant’s actual marketing, promotional, or advertising
efforts or activities that use, incorporate, or are generated by Plaintiff’s HYSITRON
Mark or derivatives thereof.
- 27 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron argues in conclusory fashion that this Request “informs every aspect of
the trademark claim.” (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 17-18.)

Hysitron also

claims that it is relevant to the “totality of the circumstances” for evaluating lost profits.
(Id.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
This Request is duplicative because MTS has already agreed to produce, among other
things, a specimen of each advertisement, marketing and promotional material.

(See

Lorentz Aff. Ex. 1, MTS’ Resp. Hysitron’s First Set of Doc. Req. Nos. 6.) Further,
Hysitron presumably has MTS’ Sponsored Link and website advertising. To the extent
Request No. 17 could be interpreted as requiring more, it is overbroad. Additional
documents not seen by Internet users are not probative of the likelihood of confusion
issue. As to the patent damages justification, MTS has, as discussed, produced or agreed
to produce documents sufficient to enable Hysitron to determine its damages, i.e., its lost
profits.
REQUEST NO. 22:
All documents that relate to Defendant’s advertising with search engine and third party
websites, including but not limited to Google.com and its affiliates, Mapquest.com,
AOL.com, Yahoo.com, Info.com, IXquick.com, Netscape.com, PepeSearch.com,
Wondir.com, Vivisimo.com, Webcrawler.com, About.com, Ask.com, Dogpile.com,
Hotbot.com, Lycos.com, Mamma.com, IWON.com, Aeiwi.com, Excite.com,
Gimenei.com, Sputtr.com, Nanovip.com, macraesbluebook.com, Azonano.com,
Stormingmedia.us, and Clusty.com (hereinafter “Third Party Websites” (this definition is
not limited to the examples provided)).

- 28 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron justifies this Request on the grounds that advertising is part of the
“totality of circumstances” relevant to patent damages. It also seeks to justify this
Request on the basis of willfulness. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS has produced or agreed to produce documents sufficient to enable Hysitron to
calculate and determine its damages, as discussed previously. Hence this Request is
overly broad and duplicative. Further, this Request has little or nothing to do with the
damage issue itself, i.e., the number of sales of the allegedly infringing product, the cost
of the product, the nature of the market, etc., topics about which MTS has agreed to
produce documents.
This Request, which seeks “all documents” that relate to MTS’ advertising with
search engines and Third Party Websites, is “hopelessly overbroad.” This Request is not
reasonably tailored to the issues in this case, and is not even limited to keyword
advertising, let alone keyword advertising employing the term “hysitron.” Hysitron has a
copy of MTS’ Sponsored Link and MTS’ website. Other documents never seen by
Internet users have no probative value concerning either damages or alleged confusion in
this market. Therefore, the probative and relevant documents have been produced, and
this Request is overly broad, unduly burdensome and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Finally, the cost and burden of responding to this

- 29 -

Request far outweighs any benefit, particularly in light of the documents MTS has
already agreed to produce.
REQUEST NO. 23:
All Documents relating to contracts, agreements, or other understandings, written and
oral, between Defendant and any search engine or third party website concerning
advertising and search engine results, including but not limited to Defendant’s use of the
term “hysitron” in connection with keyword advertising with Third Party Websites.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron tries to justify this Request on the grounds that it is relevant to patent
damages and the issue of willfulness. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above,
i.e., MTS has produced documents fully sufficient to enable Hysitron to calculate and
determine its damages, and it is beyond the scope of discovery to which Hysitron itself
has agreed. Documents relating to contracts or agreements between MTS and any search
engine or third party website are not probative of damages, willfulness, or the likelihood
of confusion in the market. Further, this Request is not limited to keyword advertising or
keyword advertising employing the term “hysitron.” Hysitron has a copy of MTS’
Sponsored Link and MTS’ website. Other documents, and particularly contracts, have no
probative value.

Thus this Request is overly broad, unduly burdensome and not

reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

REQUEST NO. 24:
All documents that relate to the manner in which Defendant’s advertisements and search
results appears on Third Party Websites.

- 30 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron uses the same justifications for this Request as for most of the requests in
dispute here, i.e., Hysitron claims the Request is relevant to patent and trademark
damages, the issue of willfulness, and confusion in the marketplace. (Hysitron’s Mem.
Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above,
i.e., MTS has produced or agreed to produce documents fully sufficient to enable
Hysitron to calculate its damages. Further, Hysitron has a copy of MTS’ Sponsored Link
and MTS’ website. The truly germane documents are in Hysitron’s possession. Other
documents never seen by Internet users have no probative value concerning alleged likely
confusion in the market. Hence this Request, which asks for “all documents” that relate
to the manner in which MTS’ advertisements appear on Third Party Websites, is overly
broad and unduly burdensome. Further, this Request, like other requests, is not limited to
keyword advertising with the term “hysitron,” and is overbroad for that reason.
REQUEST NO. 25:
All Documents sufficient to determine dates on which Defendant placed advertising on
Third Party Websites, including but not limited to advertising that related in any way to
the term “hysitron.”
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to the patent damages and Hysitron’s
claim of willful infringement. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
- 31 -

In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS has produced documents or agreed to produce documents sufficient to enable
Hysitron to calculate its lost profits damages. This damage claim is based on actual sales
of the alleged infringing product in the market place. Given that there was no actual
confusion in the market place and no lost sales resulting from actual confusion, the time
period during which MTS placed advertising on Third Party Websites is irrelevant to the
damage calculation. Further, this Request is also not at all probative of willfulness.
REQUEST NO. 26:
All Documents sufficient to determine Defendant’s target market via
Websites advertising, including but not limited to Defendant’s selection of
location in connection with the distribution of advertisements.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to patent damages and MTS’
intentional use of Hysitron’s mark. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS has already agreed to produce documents sufficient to identify the relevant markets
for the products in which MTS and Hysitron compete.

This Request is, therefore,

duplicative. Moreover, the relevant market in this lawsuit is not reasonably open to
dispute. Given this, this Request is duplicative and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Further, as with other requests, the cost and burden
of responding to this Request outweighs the potential benefit.

- 32 -

REQUEST NO. 27:
All Documents relating to correspondence with Third Party Websites regarding
Defendant’s advertising on those Third Party Websites.
OBJECTION:
Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is overly broad, unduly burdensome,
vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.
Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to patent damages and MTS’
intentional use of Hysitron’s mark. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
Further, this Request is not probative of any damages issue and MTS’ production on this
topic is sufficient. Correspondence with Third-Party Websites is not related to any of the
factors for likelihood of confusion. Documents never seen by Internet users have no
probative value concerning alleged confusion in this market. Moreover, this Request is
not limited to keyword advertising or “hysitron.” Accordingly, this Request is overly
broad and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 28:
All documents sufficient to identify the keywords submitted to Third Party Websites in
connection with Defendant’s advertising with those Third Party Websites.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to patent damages and MTS’
intentional use of Hysitron’s mark. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS’ keyword advertising with words other than “hysitron” does not have any relevance
to the question of whether MTS use of “hysitron” in keyword advertising was likely to
- 33 -

cause confusion in the relevant marketplace. The use of other keywords in website
advertising is not probative of damages (lost profits) here, and Hysitron has
acknowledged it lost no sales from actual confusion in the market. Accordingly, this
request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 29:
All documents that relate to statistics provided by Third Party Websites regarding
Defendant’s advertising with those Third Party Websites, including but not limited to the
number of times the Third Party Websites served an advertisement and the number of
visitors who clicked on Defendant’s advertisement that was generated from the
“hysitron” mark.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 30:
All documents that relate to statistics maintained by Defendant in connection with
Defendant’s advertising on Third Party Websites.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that Requests 29-30 are relevant to patent damages and MTS’
intentional use of Hysitron’s mark. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
The patent damage justification fails because MTS has agreed to produce documents to
enable Hysitron to conduct its lost profits analysis. In addition, the mere clicking on a
web-link has no logical correlation to whether or not an appreciable number of
consumers were confused as to the source of MTS and Hysitron’s respective products.
This is particularly true in the present case, where it is undisputed that MTS and

- 34 -

Hysitron’s customers cannot purchase the nanomechanical test instruments over the
Internet, and it is undisputed that MTS’ sponsored link did not contain the term
“hysitron” in its heading or body. Again, absent confusion, an increase in web traffic
generated by use of the keyword “hysitron” is not infringement. Given this, website
statistics are not probative of any issue relating to likelihood of confusion or damages.
Thus this Request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence. Finally, this Request, if relevant at all, is so tangential to any issues in this
action that the cost and burden of responding clearly outweighs any benefit.
REQUEST NO. 31:
All Documents from which Plaintiff can determine the amount of money Defendant has
expended on advertising with Third Party Websites, including but not limited to
advertising using the term “hysitron.”
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 32:
All Documents from which Plaintiff can determine the amount of money which
Defendant plans to expend on advertising with Third Party Websites, including but not
limited to advertising using the term “hysitron.”
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that Requests 31-32 are relevant to patent damages, MTS’
intentional use of Hysitron’s mark, and confusion in the market. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp.
Mot. Compel at 24-25.) (Id.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS has produced or agreed to produce documents fully sufficient to enable Hysitron to
- 35 -

calculate its alleged lost profits. These Requests are thus unnecessary and burdensome.
Further, they are not at all probative of the damage issue. The expenditure or planned
expenditure of funds on advertising are not probative of Hysitron’s alleged damages. In
addition, MTS’ actual or planned internet advertising expenditures are not probative of
whether an appreciable number of consumers were likely to be confused by MTS’ use of
the keyword “hysitron” in past sponsored link advertising. Advertising expenditures are
not relevant to any of the likelihood of confusion factors. Further, MTS has ceased using
“hysitron” in Sponsored Link advertising. MTS should not be required to respond to this
request because it is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant and
admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 33:
All documents that relate to Defendant’s decision to use the term “hysitron” in
connection with keyword advertising on Third Party Websites.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to patent damages and MTS’
intentional use of Hysitron’s mark. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 24-25.)
In response to the patent damages justification, MTS incorporates the arguments
presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.

Further, MTS’ knowledge that it was using

“hysitron” as a search word for keyword advertising is not a disputed issue. Accordingly,
this discovery request is not likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 34:
All documents that relate to Defendant’s advertising, promoting, and marketing of its
website mtsnano.com.

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
MTS’ marketing of its own website has absolutely no bearing on whether or not an
appreciable number of consumers were likely to be confused by MTS’ use of the
keyword “hysitron” in past sponsored link advertising. MTS should not be required to
respond to this request because it is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
relevant and admissible evidence.

Further, the demand for “all documents” is so

expansive that, given the tangential relevance (at best) of this request, the cost and burden
of responding far outweighs any benefit.
REQUEST NO. 35:
All documents that relate to Defendant’s usage statistics for its website mtsnano.com
from one year prior to the first use of the term “hysitron” in connection with search
engine advertising, including but not limited to the following:
• Server log files
• Yearly page request reports
• Monthly page request reports
• Weekly page request reports
• Daily page request reports
• Host reports (indicating the host name of the visitors)
• Referring URL reports
• Referring site reports
• Search query reports
• Search word reports
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that this Request is relevant to patent damages and relates to
evidence of “market presence and sales activities’ which is somehow germane to
likelihood of confusion. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 26.)
- 37 -

In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
Web traffic is not probative of damages (lost profits) which is based on actual lost sales,
so the patent damage justification fails. This justification further fails because Hysitron
and MTS agree there was no actual confusion by an actual purchaser. As to potential
confusion, the mere clicking on a web-link has no logical correlation to whether or not an
appreciable number of consumers were confused as to the source of MTS and Hysitron’s
respective products. This is particularly true in the present case, where it is undisputed
that MTS and Hysitron’s customers cannot purchase the nanomechanical test instruments
over the Internet, and it is undisputed that MTS’ Sponsored Link did not contain or
display the term “hysitron.” Thus, website statistics are not probative of any issue
relating to likelihood of confusion or damages. Thus, this discovery request is not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Further, this is an extremely broad request and the burden of responding is
substantial. The Court should not compel the discovery because the cost and burden far
outweighs any real benefit to the issues being litigated.
REQUEST NO. 36:
All documents that show the degree of care Defendant’s customers exercise in purchasing
nanomechanical instruments.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO. 37:
All documents that show the level of sophistication of Defendant’s customers that
purchase nanomechanical test instruments.

- 38 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that Requests 36-37 are relevant to trademark claims because they
bear on the characteristics of the customers and are thus relevant to likelihood of
confusion. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 27.) Hysitron also argues that these
documents are relevant to willful or deliberate actions. (Id.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS has agreed to produce documents concerning communications between MTS and
customers relating to their purchase of allegedly infringing devices (See Lorentz Aff. Ex.
1, MTS’ Resp. Hysitron’s First Set of Doc. Req. Nos. 14.) MTS also agreed to produce
documents sufficient to identify the classes of persons who make the decisions to
purchase MTS’ accused devices and documents sufficient to show the types of
purchasers, end users, expected purchasers, or expected end users of MTS’ accused
devices.

(See Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 1, Hysitron’s Second Set of

Document Req. Nos. 14 and 15.) This Request is thus duplicative, and to the extent
Request No. 37 could be interpreted as requiring more, it is overbroad.
In addition, there is no conceivable basis for stating that documents showing the
degree of care and the level of sophistication of customers (third parties) could have any
probative relationship to MTS’ own intent.
REQUEST NO. 38:
All documents that show the price charged to consumers of Defendant’s nanomechanical
test instruments.

- 39 -

OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims this request is relevant to lost profits. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp.
Mot. Compel at 27.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(ii)-(iii)
above. MTS has already agreed to produce documents sufficient to identify every sale of
the allegedly infringing devices; documents sufficient to show the gross, operating, and
net revenues relating to MTS’ sales of the allegedly infringing devices; and documents
sufficient to show the gross, operating, and net profits relating to MTS’ sales of allegedly
infringing devices. (See Lorentz Aff. Ex. 1, MTS’ Resp. Hysitron’s First Set of Doc.
Req. Nos. 13, 17, 18.) To the extent Request No. 38 could be interpreted as requiring
more, it is overbroad. The price MTS charged for its
REQUEST NO.39:
All Documents relating to Defendant’s enforcement of its marks against third parties who
use Defendant’s trademark in connection with keyword advertising.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
REQUEST NO.40:
All Documents relating to Defendant’s enforcement of its marks against third parties who
use Defendant’s trademark in connection with metatags.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

- 40 -

REQUEST NO.41:
All Documents relating to Defendant’s enforcement of its marks against third parties who
use Defendant’s trademark in connection with organic search marketing. For the purpose
of this Request, “organic search marketing” is defined as “obtaining results in a search
engine that are not sponsored.”
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Hysitron claims that Requests 39-41 are relevant to MTS’ sophistication and
willfulness in using Hysitron’s mark. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Compel at 30-31.)
Hysitron also claims that these requests are relevant to likelihood of confusion. (Id.)
In response, MTS incorporates the arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i) and (iii)
above.

MTS’ own trademark enforcement activities concerning parties, trademarks,

words and/or and terms with no relation to “hysitron” are not relevant to the limited
question of whether or not an appreciable number of consumers would be confused by
MTS’ use of the term “hysitron” in keyword advertising. Moreover, meta-tags and
organic search marketing are distinctly different from keyword advertising. This case
does not involve meta-tags nor organic search marketing, as Hysitron has admitted, and
thus these Requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.
REQUEST NO.42:
All Documents relating to any plans to expand the present use of keyword advertising to
any other search engine or third party website.
OBJECTION:
See General Objection No. 10. Defendant objects to this Request on the grounds it is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

Hysitron claims this request is to its trademark claim because it could apparently
be probative of MTS’ intent and the likelihood of confusion. (Hysitron’s Mem. Supp.
Mot. Compel at 32.) Hysitron also claims that these requests are relevant to likelihood of
confusion because they demonstrate MTS’ intent. In response, MTS incorporates the
arguments presented in Sec. II(B)(i)-(iii) above.
MTS has discontinued use of its Sponsored Link, and has no plans to and does not
intend to use “hysitron” in Sponsored Link advertising in the future. Further, any future
plans for keyword advertising cannot be relevant to whether or not a likelihood of
confusion existed during the discrete period in time in the past when MTS used keyword
advertising with the term “hysitron.” MTS should not be required to respond to this
request because it is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant and
admissible evidence.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, MTS respectfully requests that its Motion for
Protective Order be granted, or in the alternative, that the Court stay discovery of these
issues pending a resolution of its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. MTS further
urges the Court to deny Hysitron’s Motion to Compel.
