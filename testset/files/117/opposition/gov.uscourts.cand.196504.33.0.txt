The BigBand Defendants respond as follows to the (1) motion filed by Gwyn Jones for

14

an order consolidating the above-captioned matters, appointing her as lead plaintiff, and

15

approving her selection of co-lead counsel, and (2) the motion filed by the Sphera Fund for an

16

order consolidating the above-captioned matters, appointing the Sphera Fund as lead plaintiff,

17

and approving its selection of co-lead counsel.1

18

I.

INTRODUCTION

19

The above-captioned matters are putative securities fraud class action lawsuits alleging

20

that the defendants made misrepresentations and/or omissions in connection with and following

21

BigBand’s initial public offering. The first action, Mohanty v. Bassan-Eskenazi et al., No. C 07-

22

5101-SBA (the “Mohanty Action”), was filed on October 3, 2007, and the other actions followed

23

over the subsequent weeks.

24

On November 21, 2007, the parties to each of the then-pending lawsuits submitted a

25

Stipulation and [Proposed] Order Regarding Consolidation and Scheduling in the first-filed

26

The BigBand Defendants are BigBand Networks, Inc. (“BigBand”), Amir BassanEskenazi, Ran Oz, Frederick Ball, Gal Israely, Dean Gilbert, Ken Goldman, Lloyd Carney,
Bruce Sachs, Robert Sachs, and Geoffrey Yang.

Mohanty Action, in which they agreed that the cases should be deemed related and consolidated.

2

See Mohanty Action, Docket No. 11.2 The [Proposed] Order also provides that defendants need

3

not respond to any complaint until the court-appointed lead plaintiff files a consolidated

4

amended complaint.

5

On December 3, 2007, two alleged class members filed motions for appointment as lead

6

plaintiff. Gwyn Jones filed a motion seeking consolidation of the actions, appointment as lead

7

plaintiff, and approval of her selection of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP and Kahn Gauthier

8

Swick, LLC as co-lead counsel. Separately, the Sphera Fund filed a motion seeking

9

consolidation of the actions, appointment of the Sphera Fund as lead plaintiff, and approval of

10

the Sphera Fund’s selection of Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP and The Law Office of Jacob

11

Sabo as co-lead counsel. The motions are scheduled for hearing on February 5, 2008.

12

Also on December 3, 2007, the Wiltjer Action was filed in the Superior Court for the

13

County of San Francisco. On January 2, 2008, all defendants jointly removed the Wiltjer Action

14

to this Court and, the next day, the BigBand Defendants filed a Motion for Administrative Relief

15

in the Mohanty action to consider whether the Wiltjer Action should be related to the Mohanty

16

Action and the other earlier-filed actions. Mohanty Action, Docket No. 24.3

17

As explained below, the BigBand Defendants agree that these matters (including the

18

Wiltjer Action) should be consolidated into the first-filed Mohanty Action pending before the

19

Hon. Saundra B. Armstrong. The BigBand Defendants take no position, however, on the

20

appropriateness of the moving parties or their counsel for the positions of lead plaintiff and lead

21

counsel, respectively.

As explained below, Wiltjer v. BigBand Networks, Inc., et al., Case No. 08-22-CRB (the
“Wiltjer Action”), was not filed until December 3, 2007 – the same day on which Ms. Jones and
the Sphera Fund filed their competing motions for appointment as lead plaintiff.

THE BIGBAND DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO THE JONES AND SPHERA
FUND MOTIONS

2
3

A.

4

The BigBand Defendants agree that the above-captioned matters should be consolidated

Consolidation

5

into a single action before Judge Armstrong. The consolidation order should specifically include

6

the Wiltjer action, which was filed (and removed to this Court) after Ms. Jones and the Sphera

7

fund filed their competing motions for appointment as lead plaintiff, and any other substantially

8

similar actions that may be filed later. See, e.g., Mohanty Action, Docket No. 11 at 1 (joint

9

request among all parties that consolidation include subsequently-filed actions). The BigBand

10

Defendants understand that the plaintiff in the Wiltjer Action intends to file a motion to remand

11

the Wiltjer Action to state court.

12

B.

13

The BigBand Defendants take no position regarding the appointment of either Gwyn

14

Jones or the Sphera Fund as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. However, in taking no

15

position, the BigBand Defendants do not concede that these actions may properly be maintained

16

as a class action, and do not waive their right to challenge the standing of the appointed lead

17

plaintiff or the appointed lead plaintiff’s ability to adequately represent the class. The BigBand

18

Defendants can take discovery at the appropriate time regarding the appointed lead plaintiff’s

19

ability to adequately represent the Class. See In re Chiron Corp. Sec. Litig., No. C-04-4293

20

VRW, 2007 WL 4249902, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2007) (“The appointment of lead plaintiffs

21

occurring as it does in advance of class discovery, is not a final ruling on their appropriateness as

22

Class Representatives”) (citation omitted); In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc., Sec. Litig., 191

23

F.R.D. 369, 373 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (same); Tanne v. Autobytel, Inc., 226 F.R.D. 659, 666 (C.D.

24

Cal. 2005) (“Evidence regarding the requirements of Rule 23 will, of course, be heard in full at

25

the class certification hearing. There is no need to require anything more than a preliminary

26

showing at this stage”) (quoting Gluck v. CellStar Corp., 976 F. Supp. 542, 546 (N.D. Tex.

27

1997)).
