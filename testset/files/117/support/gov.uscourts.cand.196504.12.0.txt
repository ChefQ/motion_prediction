NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION
TO: ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on January 22, 2008, at 1:00 P.M., or as soon thereafter as

4

the matter may be heard, before the Honorable Judge Sandra B. Armstrong, United States District

5

Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division, Courtroom 3, 3rd Floor, 1301 Clay Street,

6

Suite 4005, Oakland, California 94612, Gwyn Jones (“Jones” or “Movant”) will and hereby moves

7

for an order for consolidation of these actions; to be appointed Lead Plaintiff in these actions

8

against BigBand Networks, Inc. pursuant to the lead plaintiff provisions of the Private Securities

9

Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), codified as Section 27(a)(3) of the Securities Act of

10

1933, 15 U.S.C. § 77z-1(a)(3) (2007), and/or Section 21D(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of

11

1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3) (2007); and for approval of Movant’s selection of the law firms

12

Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP (“Hagens Berman”) and Kahn Gauthier Swick, LLC (“KGS”)

13

as Co-Lead Counsel in this action.

14

This motion is based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum of Points and

15

Authorities in Support Thereof, the Declaration of Reed R. Kathrein in Support of this Motion, the

16

pleadings on file in this action, oral argument and such other matters as the Court may consider in

17

hearing this motion.

18
19
20

Jones makes this Motion on the belief that Movant is the most “adequate plaintiff” as
defined in the PSLRA because:
1.

Movant has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the Class and has

21

incurred substantial losses in the amount of $438,617.74 as a result of Movant’s purchase and/or

22

acquisition of shares of BigBand Networks, Inc. securities pursuant to or traceable to the

23

Company’s March 2007 Initial Public Offering (“IPO” or the “Offering”) through September 27,

24

2007, and

Movant satisfies the typicality and adequacy requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Proc.

Jones further requests that the Court approve the selection of Movant’s counsel, Hagens

3

nationally recognized law firms with significant class action, fraud and complex litigation

4

experience, and are firms with the resources to effectively and properly pursue this action.

5

For all of the foregoing reasons, Jones respectfully requests that this Court: (1) appoint

Jones to serve as Lead Plaintiff in this action; (2) approve Jones’ selection of Lead Counsel for the

7

Class; and (3) grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

I.

3

INTRODUCTION

Jones hereby moves to be appointed Lead Plaintiff in this action against BigBand

4

Networks, Inc. (“BigBand” or the “Company”) pursuant to the lead plaintiff provisions of the

5

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), codified as Section 27(a)(3) of the

6

Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77z-1(a)(3) (2007), and/or Section

7

21D(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3) (2007); and for

8

approval of Movant’s selection of the law firms Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP (“Hagens

9

Berman”) and Kahn Gauthier Swick, LLC (“KGS”) as Co-Lead Counsel in this action.

10

Jones fully understands Movant’s duties and responsibilities to the Class, and is willing and

11

able to oversee the vigorous prosecution of this action. As described in the Certification attached

12

to the Declaration of Reed R. Kathrein at Ex. A, (“Kathrein Decl.”), Jones has suffered a loss of

13

$438,617.74 as a result of Movant’s purchase and/or acquisition of shares of BigBand securities

14

pursuant to or traceable to the Company’s March 2007 Initial Public Offering (“IPO” or the

15

“Offering”) through September 27, 2007. To the best of Movant’s knowledge, Jones has therefore

16

sustained the largest loss of any qualified investor seeking to be appointed as Lead Plaintiff. In

17

addition to evidencing the largest financial interest in the outcome of this litigation, Jones’

18

certifications demonstrate Movant’s intent to serve as Lead Plaintiff in this litigation, including

19

Movant’s cognizance of the duties of serving in that role. 1

20

Moreover, Jones satisfies both the applicable requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 23 of

21

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule 23”) and is presumptively the “most adequate

22

plaintiff.” Jones respectfully submits that Movant should be appointed as Lead Plaintiff in this

23
24
25
26
27
28

The relevant federal securities laws specifically authorize any class member seeking to be
appointed lead plaintiff to either file a complaint or move for appointment as lead plaintiff. See, 15
U.S.C. § 77z-l(a)(3)(B)(i)(Claims under the Securities Act of 1933) and 15 U.S.C. § 77zl(a)(3)(B)(i) (Claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). A copy of Jones’ certifications
of Movant’s transactions in BigBand securities is attached as Exhibit A to the Kathrein Decl. that
has been filed in support of this motion.

Jones also moves to consolidate all related actions pursuant to Rule 42(a) of the Federal

4

Rules of Civil Procedure as each involves common questions of law or fact relating to untrue

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9

The first lawsuit against Defendants in any District, Mohanty v. Bassan-Eskenazi, et al.,

10

was filed on October 3, 2007 in the Northern District of California by Bikash Mohan Mohanty,

11

individually and on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired BigBand

12

securities pursuant to or traceable to the Company’s March 2007 IPO. 2 The gravamen of the

13

complaint is Defendants’ violation of the Securities Act.3 Specifically, the complaint arises out of

14

Defendants’ including or allowing the inclusion of materially false and misleading statements in

15

the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO, in direct violation of

16

the Securities Act. 4 These misrepresentations and omissions caused the price of BigBand

17

securities to be artificially inflated, and thereby resulted in the damages suffered by Jones and the

18

other members of the Class.

19
20

Shortly after the initial filing of the Mohanty action, Plaintiff Mohanty published a notice of
pendency of that action over the national wire service Market Wire on October 4, 2007. Kathrein

SUMMARY OF FACTS

This is a class action brought on behalf of the purchasers of BigBand common stock

8

pursuant to the March 2007 IPO of 10.7 million shares of common stock priced at $13.00 per

9

share. In connection with this Offering – of which the Company sold 7.5 million shares and

10

insiders sold 3.2 million shares – Defendants raised gross proceeds of at least $159.965 million

11

(including the $20.865 million BigBand shares sold by Company insiders in connection with the

12

IPO Underwriters’ oversubscription agreement).

13

BigBand, its entire Board of Directors, its Chief Financial Officer and the Underwriters

14

involved in the Offering (including, Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &

15

Smith, Inc., Jefferies & Co., Inc., Cowen & Co., Inc., and Thinkequity Partners, LLC), are each

16

charged with including, or allowing the inclusion of materially false and misleading statements in

17

the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO, in direct violation of

18

the Securities Act of 1933. Specifically, Defendants each failed to conduct an adequate due

19

diligence investigation into the Company prior to the IPO, they also each failed to reveal that at

20

that time of the IPO, BigBand was not performing according to plan, that it lacked significant

21

controls and procedures and Defendants lacked any reasonable basis to forecast near-term

22

foreseeable financial and operational results.

23

Moreover, at the time of the IPO, Defendants also failed to reveal that the Company’s

24

financial results were already underperforming expectations and that Defendants had boosted the

25

financial results of the quarter immediately prior to the offering, by loading its customers with

26

more inventory than they could possibly use in the near term – such that sales in the immediate

27

quarters would foreseeably be adversely impacted. In addition, Defendants also failed to reveal

1

that the roll out of its new products were not proceeding according to its growth plan, and that this

2

transition too was adversely impacting, and foreseeably would continue to impact revenues in the

3

near-term.

4

It was only on September 27, 2007, after the close of trading – and after Defendants and

5

other Company insiders liquidated over $15.30 million of their personally held shares in or in

6

connection with the IPO – that the truth about the Company was ultimately revealed to investors,

7

including that the problems which existed at the time of the IPO would result in extremely

8

disappointing results for the third quarter of 2007 – including substantially reduced revenues as the

9

Company’s largest customer was forced to “work off” excess inventory prior to being able to

10

acquire more product from BigBand, and that problems rolling out the Company’s latest products

11

were also having a material adverse impact upon earnings, operations and results.

12

The following trading day, on the publication of this news, BigBand stock price collapsed.

13

As evidence of this, shares of BigBand fell over 30% in a single trading day – plummeting from

14

over $9.00 per share to below $6.00 per share, before closing at $6.49 per share, on September 28,

15

2007. That trading day, BigBand also experienced exceptionally heavy trading volume with

16

almost 7 million shares traded – hundreds of times the Company’s recent average daily trading

17

volume.

IV.
A.

ARGUMENT

The Court Should Consolidate the Related Actions

20

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires that the question of

21

consolidation be decided prior to the determination of the appointment of Lead Plaintiff. The

22

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995)

23

(“PSLRA”) provides, among other things, for consolidation of substantially similar actions:

24
25
26

If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the
same claim or claims arising under this title has been filed, and any
party has sought to consolidate those actions for pretrial purposes or
for trial, the court shall not make the determination [of appointment

15 U.S.C. § 77z-4(a)(3)(B)(ii) and 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(ii).

2

Thus, the PSLRA establishes a two-step process for resolving lead plaintiff and

3

consolidation issues where more than one action on behalf of a class based on substantially the

4

same facts has been filed. The court “shall” first decide the consolidation issue and thereafter

5

decide the lead plaintiff issue “[a]s soon as practicable” after the consolidation motion has been

6

decided. Id.

7

Given that the selection of lead plaintiff and lead counsel is the necessary first step to

8

prosecute the actions, Plaintiff urges the Court to grant the consolidation Motion as soon as

9

practicable and consolidate these related actions under the lowest case number. 5 A prompt

10

determination is reasonable and warranted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), given the common

11

questions of fact and law presented by the actions now pending in this District.

12

Consolidation pursuant to Rule 42(a) is proper and routinely granted in actions such as this,

13

where there are common questions of law and fact. See Yousefi v. Lockheed Martin Corp.,

14

70 F. Supp. 2d 1061, 1064 (C.D. Cal. 1999). 6 Courts have recognized that securities class actions,

15

in particular, are ideally suited to consolidation pursuant to Rule 42(a) because their unification

16

expedites pretrial proceedings, reduces case duplication, avoids contacting of the parties and

17

witnesses for inquiries in multiple proceedings, and minimizes the expenditure of time and money

18

by all persons concerned. See e.g., In re Equity Funding of Am. Sec. Litig, 416 F. Supp. 161, 176

19

(C.D. Cal. 1976), Primavera Familienstiftung v. Askin, 173 F.R.D. 115, 129 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).

20

Indeed, “[i]n securities actions where the complaints are based on the same ‘public statements and

21

reports’ consolidation is appropriate if there are common questions of law and fact” and the parties

22

5
On November 21, 2007, the parties to each of these cases filed a joint Stipulation and
[Proposed] Order Regarding Consolidation and Scheduling.

23
24
25
26
27
28

Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows this Court to order consolidation
of separate actions:

6

When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending
before the Court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all of
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all of the actions
consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings
therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs of delay.

2

F.R.D. 129, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Consolidating shareholder class actions streamlines and

3

simplifies pre-trial and discovery proceedings, including motions, class action issues, clerical and

4

administrative duties, and generally reduces the confusion and delay that result from prosecuting

5

related actions separately before two or more judges. Id. See also In re Olsten Corp. Sec. Litig., 3

6

F. Supp. 2d 286 (E.D.N.Y. 1998).

7

As discussed above, the actions pending before this Court present virtually identical factual

8

issues, each one alleges violations of the federal securities and each action names the same

9

defendants. The differences in the complaints are minor and will be resolved upon the filing of a

10

consolidated complaint. Because these actions are based on the same facts and involve the same

11

subject matter, the same discovery will be relevant to all lawsuits. Thus, consolidation is

12

appropriate.

13

Accordingly, this Court should enter an Order that consolidates the related cases and all

14

future related cases with the instant action.

Jones Should Be Appointed Lead Plaintiff
1.

The PSLRA Procedure for Lead Plaintiff Appointment Favors Appointment of
Jones

17
The selection of Lead Plaintiff in a securities class action is a determination made by the
18
Court as to which plaintiff is the most capable of adequately representing the class. The Court:
19
(s)hall appoint as lead plaintiff the member or members of the purported
20
plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately
21
representing the interests of class members in accordance with this
22
subparagraph.
23
15 U.S.C. § 77z-1(a)(3)(B)(i) and 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i) (emphasis added).
24
The “most adequate plaintiff” assumes a rebuttable presumption that:

(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure.

8
9

Only by a showing that a Lead Plaintiff will not fairly and adequately represent the Class,
or is subject to unique defenses that will render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing

10

the Class, will this presumption be overcome. 15 U.S.C. § 77z-1(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II) and 15 U.S.C.

11

§ 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II).

12

Under this statutory test, Jones is the “most adequate plaintiff” and should be appointed as

13

Lead Plaintiff on behalf of the proposed Class. Jones has timely moved this Court for appointment

14

as Lead Plaintiff in accordance with the PSLRA and has the willingness, resources and expertise to

15

obtain excellent results for the Class. Consequently, this Court should appoint Jones as Lead

16

Plaintiff and approve Movant’s selection of Hagens Berman and KGS as Co-Lead Counsel for the

17

Class.

19

Jones moves the Court to be appointed Lead Plaintiff and has timely filed the instant

motion to be appointed lead plaintiff within the 60-day time period requirement. The plaintiff in

the first-filed action published notice on Market Wire, a national business-oriented wire service, on

22

October 4, 2007. Accordingly, Jones meets the requirement of 15 U.S.C. § 77z-

24

within the 60-day time period requirement.

25

Moreover, Jones has sustained a substantial loss from Movant’s investment in BigBand

26

securities and has shown Movant’s willingness to represent the Class by signing a certification

this certification, Jones is prepared to consult with counsel on a regular basis, prior to every major

2

litigation event, and direct the course of the litigation, with the benefit of counsel’s advice. In

significant experience in securities class action litigation. Kathrein Decl., Ex. D.

3.

Jones Has the Largest Financial Interest of the Plaintiffs Who Have Submitted
Applications for Lead Plaintiff

6
As a result of Movant’s purchases of BigBand securities throughout the Class Period, Jones
7
has suffered losses of $438,617.74. Kathrein Decl., Ex. B. Jones believes Movant has the largest
8
financial interest in this class action compared to any other party moving for Lead Plaintiff. The
9
PSLRA provides that there is a rebuttable presumption that the “most adequate plaintiff” is the
10
plaintiff with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class. 15 U.S.C. § 77z11
l(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(bb). “So long as the plaintiff with the largest losses satisfies the adequacy
12
requirements, he is entitled to lead plaintiff status...” Ferrari v. Gisch, 225 F.R.D. 599, 602 (C.D.
13
Cal. 2004) (citing In re Cavanaugh 306 F.3d 726, 732 (9th Cir. 2002)). Jones, therefore, is
14
presumptively the “most adequate plaintiff” pursuant to the PSLRA.

Jones Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23

16
Section 27(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(cc) of the Securities Act and Section 21D(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(cc) of
17
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the PSLRA, provides that the Lead Plaintiff
18
must satisfy the typicality and adequacy requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a). Siegall v. Tibco
19
Software, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 26780, *15 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2006) (“In the context of
20
determining the appropriate lead plaintiff, the requirements of ‘typicality’ and adequacy of
21
representation are the key factors.”). This Court’s analysis of any other requirements of Rule 23 as
22
it relates to class certification should be deferred until the Lead Plaintiff moves for class
23
certification. Schriver v. Impac. Mortg. Holdings, Inc., 2006 Dist. Lexis 40607, *16 (C.D. Cal.
24
May 2, 2006) (“At the lead plaintiff appointment stage, the Rule 23 inquiry is not as searching as it

facie showing that it meets the typicality and adequacy factors.”). As detailed below, Jones

satisfies both the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a), and should therefore be

2

appointed Lead Plaintiff in this action.

3

a.

Jones’ Claims Are Typical of the Claims of All the Class Members

4

Under Rule 23(a)(3), typicality exists where “the claims…of the representative parties” are

5

“typical of the claims...of the class.” The typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is satisfied when

6

the representative plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same event or course of conduct that gives rise

7

to claims of other class members, and when the claims are based on the same legal theory. See

8

Crossen v. CV Therapeutics, 2005 US Dist. Lexis 41396, *13 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2005). The

9

requirement that the proposed class representatives’ claims be typical of the claims of the class

10

does not mean, however, that the claims must be identical. See Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d

11

1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1988).

12

In this case, the typicality requirement is met because Jones’ claims are identical to the

13

claims of the other Class Members. Jones and all the members of the Class purchased BigBand

14

securities when the stock prices were artificially inflated as a result of the Defendants’

15

misrepresentations and omissions, and thus, both Jones and the Class Members suffered damages

16

as a result of these purchases. Simply put, Jones, like all the other Class Members, (1) purchased

17

BigBand securities pursuant to or traceable to its March 2007 Initial Public Offering; (2) purchased

18

BigBand securities at artificially inflated prices as a result of the Defendants’ misrepresentations

19

and omissions; and (3) suffered damages thereby. Jones’ claims and injuries “arise from the same

20

event or course of conduct that [gave] rise to the claims of other class members.” Crossen, 2005

21

US Dist. Lexis 41396 at *13.

22

Moreover, Jones is not subject to any unique or special defenses. Thus, Jones meets the

23

typicality requirement of Rule 23 because Movant’s claims are the same as the claims of the other

24

Class Members.

25
26
27
28

Jones Will Adequately Represent the Interests of the Class

The requirements of Rule 23(a) relating to adequate representation are satisfied if (1) the
class counsel is qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the litigation; (2) the interests

of the class are not antagonistic to one another; and (3) the lead plaintiff has a “sufficient interest in

2

the outcome of the case to ensure vigorous advocacy.” Miller v. Ventro Corp., 2001 U.S. Dist.

3

Lexis 26027, *44 (N.D Cal. Nov. 28, 2001) (citing Takeda v. Turbodyne Techs., 67 F.Supp. 2d

4

1129, 1132 (C.D. Cal. 1999)). As described below, Jones will adequately represent the interests of

5

the class.

6

Jones’ interests are clearly aligned with the members of the Class because Movant’s claims

7

are identical to the claims of the Class. There is no evidence of antagonism between Jones’

8

interests and those of proposed Class Members. Furthermore, Jones has a significant, compelling

9

interest in prosecuting this action to a successful conclusion based upon the very large financial

10

loss Movant incurred as a result of the wrongful conduct alleged herein. This motivation,

11

combined with Jones’ identical interest with the members of the Class, clearly shows that Jones

12

will adequately and vigorously pursue the interests of the Class. In addition, Jones has selected

13

counsel that is highly experienced in prosecuting securities class actions such as this one to

14

represent the fund and the class.

15

In sum, because of Jones’ common interests with the Class Members, Movant’s clear

16

motivation and ability to vigorously pursue this action, and Movant’s competent counsel, the

17

adequacy requirement of Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a) is met in this case. Therefore, since Jones not

18

only meets both the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a), and has sustained the

19

largest amount of losses at the hands of the Defendants, Jones is, in accordance with 15 U.S.C. §

20

77z-1(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I), presumptively the most adequate plaintiff to lead this action. 7

21

C.

22

THIS COURT SHOULD APPROVE JONES’ CHOICE OF LEAD COUNSEL
The PSLRA vests authority in the Lead Plaintiff to select and retain counsel to represent the

23

class, subject to the Court’s approval. 15 U.S.C. § 77z-1(a)(3)(B)(v) and § 78u-1(a)(3)(B)(v).

24

Thus, this Court should not disturb the Lead Plaintiff’s choice of counsel unless necessary to

25

“protect the interests of the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 77z-l(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II)(aa) and§ 78u-

26

7
The PSLRA clearly envisions a two-part test of a presumption of adequacy and a
mechanism for rebutting the presumption. 15 U.S.C. § 77z-1(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I) and (II) and § 78u1(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I) and (II). Jones meets the presumption of adequacy.

will receive the highest caliber of legal representation.

For all of the foregoing reasons, Jones respectfully requests that this Court: (1) appoint
