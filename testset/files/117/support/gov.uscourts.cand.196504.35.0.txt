Lead plaintiff Movant Sphera Fund respectfully submits this memorandum

2

of law in further support of its motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and for

3

approval of its selection of lead counsel, and in opposition to the competing

4

motion of Gwyn Jones, who has not made the requisite showing of adequacy

5

under the PSLRA and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Because Sphera Fund is a sophisticated

6

institutional investor which has a substantial financial interest in this litigation and

7

has demonstrated its adequacy to serve as lead plaintiff, Sphera Fund is the most

8

adequate plaintiff and should be appointed lead plaintiff for the Class and have its

9

selection of Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP and The Law Office of Jacob Sabo

10

approved as co-lead counsel.

INTRODUCTION
Presently pending before the Court are two motions seeking appointment as
lead plaintiff and approval of lead counsel filed by: (i) Sphera Fund – a
sophisticated, institutional investor with losses of $374,889.61; and (ii) Gwyn
Jones (“Jones”) – who appears to be an individual investor with reported losses of
$438,617.74.
Pursuant to the express terms of the Private Securities Litigation Reform

19

Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”), the Court shall adopt a presumption that the most

20

adequate plaintiff in a securities class action is the class member with the largest

21

financial interest in the litigation who also satisfies the adequacy and typicality

22

requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.

23

As detailed herein and in its opening brief, Sphera Fund should be

24

appointed lead plaintiff in this action because (i) it has suffered a substantial

25

financial loss as a result of its purchase of Big Band stock, (ii) Sphera Fund is the

26

only movant that satisfies the requirements of Rule 23, as it is both an adequate

27

and typical representative for all class members; and (iii) Sphera Fund is a

sophisticated institutional investor, the prototypical investor that Congress

2

envisioned as serving as lead plaintiff in actions brought under the PSLRA.

3

Accordingly, Sphera Fund should be appointed as lead plaintiff, and the

4

competing motion of Gwyn Jones should be denied.

5

As the presumptive most adequate plaintiff, Sphera Fund has selected lead

6

counsel in this action, subject to Court approval. Here, the law firms Glancy

7

Binkow & Goldberg LLP and The Law Office of Jacob Sabo as co-lead counsel.

8

Both of these law firms have extensive experience in securities class action

9

litigation and are well-qualified to prosecute this action. Accordingly, Sphera

10

Fund’s lead counsel selection should be approved by the Court.

11

ARGUMENT

12
13

Sphera Fund Is The Most Adequate Plaintiff
And Should Be Appointed Lead Plaintiff

14

The PSLRA provides a “rebuttable presumption” that the most “adequate

15
16

I.

plaintiff” to serve as Lead Plaintiff is the person or group of persons that:
(aa)

has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a
notice... ;

(bb)

in the determination of the Court, has the largest financial interest in
the relief sought by the class; and

(cc)

otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure.

2

district courts have not followed them invariably, especially when doing so would

3

4

members of the purported plaintiff class who are most capable of representing the

5

interests of the class members.”)(citations, internal quotations omitted). “[T]he

6

securities class action plays a critically important role and “owes a fiduciary duty
to all members of the proposed class to provide fair and adequate representation
and actively work with class counsel to obtain the largest recovery for the
proposed class consistent with good faith and meritorious advocacy.” In re
Network Associates, 76 F.Supp.2d at 1033.
As demonstrated below, Sphera Fund is the only movant who has
sufficiently demonstrated that it meets Rule 23’s requirements of typicality and
adequacy.
A.

Sphera Fund Satisfies The
Requirements Of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23

Under Rule 23(a)(4), the representative party must also “fairly and
adequately protect the interests of the class.” As demonstrated in its opening brief,
Sphera Fund readily meets the adequacy and typicality requirements. See Sphera
Fund Opening Memorandum (“Op. Mem.”) at 7-10.
“[T]he typicality requirement of Rule 23(a) requires that the claims or
defenses of the class representatives not differ significantly from the claims or
defenses of the class as a whole.” In re HiEnergy Techs., Inc. Sec. Litig., 2006
WL 2780058, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2006) (citing In re Computer Memories

Sec. Litig., 111 F.R.D. 675, 680 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 26, 1986)). See also Ruland v.

2

InfoSonics Corp., 2006 WL 3746716, at *6 (S.D.Cal. Oct. 23, 2006)(“Claims are

3

‘typical’ under Rule 23 if they are ‘reasonably co-extensive with those of absent

4

class members; they need not be substantially identical’”)(citing Hanlon v.

5

Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir.1998)). Sphera Fund is typical of the

6

Class because it purchased Big Band shares during the Class Period: (a) at prices

7

alleged to have been artificially inflated by the false and misleading statements

8

issued by defendants, and (b) was damaged by defendants’ alleged violations of

9

federal securities laws.

10
11
12
13
14

18

Sphera Fund is also an adequate representative of the class. Rule 23's
adequacy requirement is satisfied where the moving party demonstrates that it can
“adequately protect the interests of the class,” i.e., that the plaintiff’s attorneys are
qualified and experienced, and the plaintiff does not have interests antagonistic to
or conflicting with those of the class. In re HiEnergy Techs., 2006 WL 2780058, at
*4 (citing Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1978)).
Sphera Fund has chosen proposed lead counsel, the law firms Glancy Binkow &
Goldberg LLP and The Law Office of Jacob Sabo, which have extensive

19

experience successfully litigating securities class actions, see Op. Mem.,

20

Declaration of Lionel Z. Glancy, Ex. D (attaching firm resumés), and is not aware

21

of any antagonism between Sphera Fund’s interests and those of the Class.

22

Accordingly, the Court can rest assured that Sphera Fund and its proposed lead

23

counsel will more than adequately protect the interests of absent class members.

24

As the only movant which has sufficiently demonstrated its adequacy

25

pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Sphera Fund is the presumptive most adequate

26

plaintiff and should be appointed lead plaintiff in this action.

Sphera Fund is precisely the type of lead plaintiff which Congress

7

envisioned when it enacted the PSLRA. Institutional investors hold a preferred

8

position under the PSLRA as they are likely to have substantially more financial

9

resources than individual private investors, they possess investment sophistication,

10

and “an administrative structure under which they fulfill their fiduciary obligations

to their members by choosing counsel to represent them and then maintaining
oversight over those attorneys.” City of Brockton Retirement System v. The Shaw
Group, Inc., 2007 WL 2845125 at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2007).
As an institutional investor, Sphera Fund is “accustomed to acting in the
role of a fiduciary, and its experience with investing and financial matters will
only benefit the class.” Gluck v. CellStar Corp., 976 F.Supp. 542, 546 (N.D.Tex.,
1997) citing In re California Micro Devices Securities Litigation, 168 F.R.D. 276,
278 (N.D.Cal.1996).
C.

As the Only Institutional Investor Movant,
Sphera Fund Should Be Appointed Lead Plaintiff

Congress’ clear goal in enacting the PSLRA provisions governing the
appointment of lead plaintiff was, in part, to increase the likelihood that
institutional investors will serve as lead plaintiffs. See Bioenvision, 2007 WL
4526532, at *3 (collecting cases).
Accordingly, courts have realized Congress’ goal by rejecting competing
lead plaintiff movants with allegedly greater financial interests in favor of an
institution. See Bowman v. Legato Systems, Inc., 195 F.R.D. 655, 658 (N.D. Cal.
No. 4:07-cv-05101-SBA

3

1112 (N.D.Cal. 2001)(single institutional investor with losses of $2.3 million

4

appointed over competing movants with aggregate losses of $14 million). Thus,

5

by appointing Sphera Fund as lead plaintiff in this case, the Court would be

6

fulfilling one of the PSLRA’s primary goals – “increasing the appointment of

7

institutional investors as lead plaintiffs.” Id., at 1109.

Likewise, in this case a single institutional investor, Sphera Fund, seeks to
be appointed Lead Plaintiff. See Network Associates, 76 F. Supp. 2d at 1021,
1025 (analyzing legislative history and noting “It seems clear that Congress
intended a single, strong lead plaintiff to control counsel and the litigation”);
Sakhrani v. Brightpoint, 78 F. Supp. 2d 845, 850 (S.D. Ind. 1999)(“The PSLRA
was enacted with the explicit hope that institutional investors . . . would step
forward to represent the class and exercise effective management and supervision
of the class lawyers”); Gluck v. CellStar Corp., 976 F. Supp. at 548 (N.D. Tex.
1997)(“through the PSLRA, Congress has unequivocally expressed its preference
for securities fraud litigation to be directed by large institutional investors”).

19

Sphera Fund, which manages more than $260 million in capital is the ideal lead

20

plaintiff envisioned by the PSLRA. It is run by a team of experienced investment

21

managers and directors who act in a fiduciary capacity on a daily basis, and it

22

clearly possess the resources and ability to oversee this litigation and monitor the

23

lawyers. Moreover, Sphera Fund is the only movant which has made a prima

24

facie showing that it satisfies the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23,

25

as required by the PSLRA. See 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I) (cc). As a

26

sophisticated institutional investor with substantial experience and resources,

27

Sphera Fund is capable of managing this litigation efficiently, effectively and in

II.

Gwyn Jones Has Not Established a Prima Facie Case
of Adequacy and Is Ineligible to Serve as Lead Plaintiff

Pursuant to the PSLRA, the Court must determine which of the competing
movants has the “largest financial interest” in the litigation. See 15 U.S.C. §
78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I). The movant claiming to have the largest loss in this case is
apparently an individual investor, Gwyn Jones, about whom virtually nothing is
known. However, as an individual whose ability and qualifications to be lead

10

plaintiff, if any, are unknown, Jones cannot assure the adequate representation of

11

absent class members’ interests. See In re Cable and Wireless, 217 F.R.D. at 377

12

(E.D.Va. 2003)(“a movant’s financial interest is just a beginning point, and courts

13

acknowledge that they must also consider the movant’s ability and willingness to

14

adequately represent the class.”)

15

Once the court has determined the movant with the largest financial interest

16

in the litigation, “It must then focus its attention on that plaintiff and determine,

17

based on the information he has provided in his pleadings and declarations,

18

whether he satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a),” with the court relying on the

19

presumptive lead plaintiff’s initial filings and sworn certification. In re

20

Cavanaugh, 306 F. 3d at 730 (emphasis added).

In order to be appointed lead plaintiff under the PSLRA, a plaintiff’s filings
must make a prima facie showing of its adequacy to serve in that role. See Id.; 15
U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(cc). Although “the fact that a searching inquiry
under Rule 23 is not required at this stage of the litigation does not mean that the
Court must pay mere lip service to the requirement of the statute that a prospective
lead plaintiff satisf[y] the requirements of Rule 23.” In re Flight Safety
Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation, 231 F.R.D. 124, 128 (D.Conn.

2003)(citing In re Terayon Communications Systems, Inc. Securities Litigation,

2

2004 WL 413277 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 23, 2004). In this case, the Court is faced with a

3

dearth of identifying information concerning Jones, who proposes to undertake

4

this important fiduciary role on behalf of absent class members without providing

5

even basic information for the Court to evaluate his or her qualifications.

6

Jones’ certification provides no information whatsoever concerning who

7

Gwyn Jones is, including what he or she does for a living, where he or she resides,

8

his or her investment experience, his or her experience serving as a fiduciary, or

9

even Jones’ middle initial. “[T]he certification requirement forms the baseline for

18

any party seeking to act as lead plaintiff in a securities class action...” and
“requires a plaintiff seeking to serve in a representative capacity to put forward
with his, her, or its motion such information from which the district court can
evaluate the adequacy of that plaintiff against competitors . ...” Burke v.
Ruttenberg, 102 F.Supp.2d 1280, 1320 (N.D. Ala. 2000). Jones has failed to do
that.
In this context, Jones’ submission of nothing more than a cookie-cutter
certification form without any supplemental information whatsoever raises more

19

questions that it answers, and serves only to defeat a court’s reasonable inquiry

20

into the movant’s bona fides.

21

Essentially, Jones is a blank slate, whose background is completely

22

unknown and whose certification fails to provide any meaningful information

23

with which the Court can independently make the required adequacy

24

determination under Rule 23. See Chill v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 181 F.R.D.

25

398, 410 414 (D.Minn.1998)(“If there is any benefit in appending a certification to

26

context of a Lead Plaintiff Motion. ...[C]ertifications are an essential foundation

for assessing a proposed Lead Plaintiff's capacity to be the ‘most adequate

2

plaintiff’”). Accordingly, the Court cannot accurately assess Jones’

3

qualifications, if any, or be confident that class members’ interests will be

4

adequately protected. See In re Conseco, Inc. Securities Litigation, 120 F.Supp.2d

5

729, 734 (S.D.Ind. 2000)(appointing institutional investor as lead plaintiff over

6

individual movant because, despite having the largest loss, his “certification form,

does not provide the quality of information about himself that would give the

Court confidence in appointing him as lead plaintiff over institutional investors”).

Conversely, Sphera Fund, as an institutional investor and experienced
fiduciary, has the background, expertise and professional organization to ensure
adequate representation for the class. This Court or any other interested party may,
through a simple Internet search1, easily and quickly access substantial
information concerning Sphera Fund, its size, business organization, management
(including the signatory of its Certification, managing partner Mr. Ron Senator)
investment philosophy, historical performance data, and, importantly, a variety of
contact information including office and email addresses, telephone and fax
numbers, and the name of the relevant party who can respond to inquiries for

19

additional information. Thus, Sphera Fund’s transparency stands in stark contrast

20

to the complete lack of similar information about Jones. See King v Livent, Inc., 36

21

F. Supp. 2d 187, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)(PSLRA’s lead plaintiff selection process

22

“works better with more information than less”).

23

Sphera Fund is an institutional investor which possesses the resources,

24

expertise, and incentives necessary to pursue this action on behalf of the class and

25

whose qualifications and expertise are readily available for review. Jones, on the

other hand, presents no support that he or she can provide the same or, for that

2

matter, any of the resources or expertise of a large institution like Sphera Fund in

managing a complex securities litigation. Consequently, Sphera Fund should be

appointed lead plaintiff and Jones motion should be denied.

5

Alternatively, in the event the Court does not deny Jones’ motion outright,

Sphera Fund respectfully urges to Court to appoint Sphera Fund as co-lead

plaintiff to ensure that the litigation proceeds with speed and efficiency, and that

the interests of the class are adequately protected. See Plumbers and Pipefitters

III.

Sphera Funds’ Selection Of Counsel Should Be Approved

21

The PSLRA states that the “most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to the

22

approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.” See 15

23

U.S.C. §78u-4 (a)(3)(B)(v). Here, Sphera Fund has selected the law firms Glancy

24

Binkow & Goldberg LLP and The Law Office of Jacob Sabo as co-lead counsel to

25

represent it and the class. Both of these law firms have extensive experience in the

26

area of shareholder litigation, both have successfully litigated numerous securities

27

class actions and are well-qualified to serve as lead counsel. See Sphera Fund’s

be confident that appointing Sphera Fund as lead plaintiff will ensure that the class
