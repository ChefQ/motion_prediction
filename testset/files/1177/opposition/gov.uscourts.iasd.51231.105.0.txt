GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT
MO YUN’S MOTION TO SEVER
The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA submits the following response to
defendant Mo Yun’s motion to sever, Dkt. 98.
INTRODUCTION
Defendants Mo Hailong and Mo Yun, who are brother and sister, are charged
with five others in a one-count indictment, which charges them with conspiring to
steal trade secrets, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1832(a)(5). Dkt. 57. Trial for both
defendants is scheduled for December 1, 2014.
Defendants should be tried together. The Eighth Circuit has recognized that
joint trials are almost always proper, and are nearly universally proper for
codefendants who are charged in the same conspiracy and face no other charges.
Establishing the kind of substantial prejudice that could justify severance is a
heavy burden, and one defendant has not met. Neither of the two recognized bases
for severance exist here, because defendant has not demonstrated that her defense
is irreconcilable with that of her brother, and she has not shown that the jury will
1

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 2 of 19

be unable to compartmentalize the evidence against her, and distinguish it from
evidence against her brother. Indeed, the government’s evidence against the two
defendants will be nearly identical, and all of it is admissible against defendant.
Separate trials would force the parties and the court to conduct the same lengthy,
complicated trial twice, and this result would prejudice the government. Moreover,
defendant’s desire for a trial date before that of her brother is not a basis for
severance. The Speedy Trial Act contains the same preference for joint trials that
severance doctrine protects, and time should be excluded under the Act for delay
necessary to secure a joint trial in this case.
This court should deny defendant’s motion.
ARGUMENT
I.

The preference for joint trials is strong, and applies with particular
force here.
There is a strong preference that defendants who are indicted together

should be tried together, and such joint trials “play a vital role in the criminal
justice system.” Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993).1 Joint trials are
preferred because they conserve scarce time and resources, they give the jury the
best perspective on all the evidence and therefore increase the likelihood of a correct
outcome, and they avoid the “scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts.” Id.;
United States v. Hively, 437 F.3d 752, 765 (8th Cir. 2006). The presumption in favor
of joint trials is particularly strong where defendants are charged in the same

2

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 3 of 19

indictment with participating in the same conspiracy. “Rarely, if ever, will it be
improper for co-conspirators to be tried together.” United States v. Kime, 99 F.3d
870, 880 (8th Cir. 1996).
All of the general reasons for joint trials apply with particular force in this
case. Defendant and her brother Mo Hailong are charged in the same indictment
with participating in the same conspiracy, and there are no other charges. A trial of
the defendants, whether joint or separate, would be lengthy—at least a month, if
not longer. And, as explained in more detail below, the evidence at a trial of
defendant would be nearly identical to the evidence at a trial of her brother. There
is a strong presumption against forcing the government and court to try the same
case twice. As the Supreme Court has explained:
It would impair both the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal
justice system to require . . . that prosecutors bring separate
proceedings, presenting the same evidence again and again, requiring
victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes
trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last-tried defendants
who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution’s case beforehand.
Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 210 (1987).
Recognizing the preference for joint trials, Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure permits a district court to sever a defendant from trial only if a
joint trial will result in prejudice, and the Eighth Circuit has explained that such
prejudice must be “real” rather than speculative. United States v. Sandstrom, 594
F.3d 634, 644 (8th Cir. 2010). The court of appeals has recognized two
circumstances that may establish prejudice: if defendants have defenses that are
3

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 4 of 19

“irreconcilable,” or if “the jury will be unable to compartmentalize the evidence as it
relates to separate defendants.” Id. “Only in an unusual case will the prejudice
resulting from a joint trial be substantial enough to outweigh the general efficiency
of joinder.” United States v. Al-Esawi, 560 F.3d 888, 891 (8th Cir. 2009).
Critically, defendant bears the burden of showing a clear likelihood of
prejudice, Hively, 437 F.3d at 765, and this burden is “heavy.” Sandstrom, 594 F.3d
at 644.
II.

Defendant has not demonstrated that a joint trial will prejudice her.
A.

There are no irreconcilable defenses.

Defendant’s motion for severance does not even contend, much less
demonstrate, that her defense at trial will be irreconcilable with that of her codefendant and brother, Mo Hailong. In any event, there is a high bar to showing
such an irreconcilable defense. There is no inherent prejudice when defendants offer
defenses that conflict with one another. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 538. The risk of
prejudice exists “only when there is a danger that the jury will unjustifiably infer
that this conflict alone demonstrates that both [defendants] are guilty.” Sandstrom,
594 F.3d at 644 (emphasis in original). Even then, “[t]he risk of prejudice posed by
joint trials is best cured by careful and thorough jury instructions.” United States v.
Mickelson, 378 F.3d 810, 818 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Sandstrom, 594 F.3d at 646
(holding that jury instructions cured any prejudice from antagonistic defenses). In
short, defendant’s motion offers no grounds for severance based on irreconcilable
defenses.
4

B.

There is no risk of spillover.

This is not a case in which a jury will be unable to differentiate between the
evidence against defendant and the evidence against her brother, Mo Hailong.
There will be little to compartmentalize, because the evidence at a trial of defendant
alone would be nearly identical to the evidence at a joint trial of defendant and Mo
Hailong, and all of this evidence is admissible against defendant. Moreover, any
slight risk of spillover does not support the drastic step of severance, and the court
can cure any potential prejudice with appropriate jury instructions.
1. Defendant’s chats with Mo Hailong are admissible against
both defendants.
From 2006 to 2008, defendant, Mo Hailong, and the conspiracy’s leader, Dr.
Li Shaoming, communicated with each other about their plan to steal corn seed
from companies in the United States, send the seed to China, and conceal their
actions from American companies and authorities. Some of these conversations
occurred through instant messenger “chats,” which Mo Hailong preserved in text
files on his computer.2 As outlined in the indictment, on January 16, 2007,
defendant Li Shaoming told Mo Hailong:
[Defendant] MO Yun is in charge of the specifics from the home
country side. She will contact you and work with you. I hope we can
gather 1000 pieces of the top notch corn hybrids or inbred lines
currently available in the U.S. It’s even better if we can collect the elite
breeds that are being tested.
The indictment summarizes such chats from 2007 and 2008, but there are
additional chats involving defendant from 2006, which the government has provided
defendants in discovery.
5
2

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 6 of 19

Indictment, ¶ 27.
In subsequent conversations up to January 2008, defendant instructed Mo
Hailong to contact Dr. Li Shaoming about what corn seed to collect; defendant
instructed Mo Hailong to contact farm owners about purchasing farmland for DBN,
which, according to Mo Hailong, would help them obtain the “parent of germplasm”;
defendant asked Mo Hailong if he could get corn, and Mo Hailong responded that
it’s easy to pick and take pictures, but caution is needed to avoid being seen; Li
Shaoming told Mo Hailong that Li Shaoming would speak to defendant about
sending additional employees to help Mo Hailong collect seed; and defendant told
Mo Hailong that Li Shaoming was very glad to see the performance of the seeds Mo
Hailong had sent, and that Mo Hailong’s work in the United States was very
important to Li Shaoming’s plan. Id. ¶¶ 28-32.
Defendant has not filed a motion to exclude the chats summarized in the
indictment, but her severance motion claims they are inadmissible hearsay and that
the government cannot authenticate them. Dkt. 98-1 at 15-16. These claims are
baseless.
The chats are not hearsay. Chats between Mo Hailong and Mo Yun are
admissible against both defendants as statements of a party opponent. See Fed. R.
Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). Chats between Mo Hailong and Li Shaoming are admissible
against Mo Hailong as statements of a party opponent, and are admissible against
Mo Yun as co-conspirator statements. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2(E).
Defendant’s challenge to the authenticity of the chats is equally flawed. If the
6

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 7 of 19

chats cannot be authenticated, they are inadmissible against both defendants, but
that is something defendants have in common and is not a reason to sever their
trials. More importantly, there is no authentication problem.
“To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of
evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that
the item is what the proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). The evidence at
trial will show the chats are conversations between defendants—not necessarily
every conversation defendants had, but at least some of their conversations. To
establish this, the government does not need testimony from a participant in the
conversations; it can demonstrate what they are through circumstantial evidence,
including their content. United States v. Wadena, 152 F.3d 831, 854 (8th Cir. 1998);
United States v. Young, 753 F.3d 757, 773 (8th Cir. 2014); Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4).
There is plenty of evidence that the chats are conversations between
defendants: (1) the chats are contained in text files found on Mo Hailong’s computer,
which the FBI seized from his home; (2) the chats are saved in individual files, and
the file names contain defendant’s name, “Mo Yun,” and often include the date; (3)
the text of the chats indicates that they are between “Hailong” and the Chinese
character for “Mo Yun”; (4) in several chats, defendant and Mo Hailong refer to
defendant’s email address as moyun@dbn.cn—defendant’s name, followed by her
employer, DBN, followed by “.cn,” the Internet country domain for China; and (5)
defendant admitted to the FBI that one of the chats records her giving advice to her
brother, Mo Hailong, about personal matters. (During the same chat, defendant and
7

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 8 of 19

Mo Hailong discussed buying farmland in furtherance of the conspiracy. Indictment
¶ 29.)3
This evidence is more than enough to satisfy the proponent’s threshold: “a
rational basis” to believe the chats are conversations between defendants. Wadena,
152 F.3d at 854; see also United States v. Manning, 738 F.3d 937, 943 (8th Cir.
2014) (affirming district court’s admission of chats found on defendant’s computer
based on identifying information about defendant contained in chats, testimony
that defendant admitted using the username contained in chats, and presence of
chats on defendant’s laptop in his house).
Once the government meets this burden, “the jury determines any further
questions as to the evidence’s authenticity.” For example, defendant suggests that
because Mo Hailong may have cut and pasted the chats into a text file, they might
be inaccurate or incomplete. Dkt. 98-1 at 15. Defendant will be free to argue this
point to the jury, but they go to the evidence’s weight, not its admissibility. See
United States v. Garrison, 168 F.3d 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 1999) (holding that
defendant’s claim that airline flight records were inaccurate because they conflicted
with other evidence at trial was for the jury to resolve).
2. Coconspirator statements and acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy are admissible against both defendants.
As summarized above, in 2007 and 2008, defendant gave her brother Mo
Defendant says she will move to suppress this admission. Dkt. 98-1 at 1516. But she has not done so, and her motion will be meritless, because she was not
in custody at the time of the interview.

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 9 of 19

Hailong instructions about collecting corn seed in the United States and Mo Hailong
discussed the need to avoid being detected while doing so, defendant and Mo
Hailong discussed sending the seed to defendant Li Shaoming in China, and
defendant instructed Mo Hailong to contact land owners about buying farmland in
Iowa, which Mo Hailong said would help them obtain the “parent of germplasm.”
Indictment ¶¶ 27-32.
In the following years, Mo Hailong and other coconspirators followed
defendant’s instructions and carried out the plans defendant, Mo Hailong, and Li
Shaoming had discussed. In May 2008 and March 2012, Mo Hailong bought
farmland in Iowa and Illinois. Id. ¶¶ 33 38. In May 2011, he was found digging
hybrid corn out of a field in Iowa, and after being caught, Mo Hailong and defendant
Wang Lei sped away in a car. Id. ¶ 35. In September 2011, Mo Hailong mailed over
340 pounds of “corn samples” from Iowa to his home in Florida, and in May 2012, he
and defendants Ye Jian and Lin Yong attempted to ship 250 pounds of corn seed
from Illinois to Hong Kong. Id. ¶¶ 37, 39.
In August and September 2012, defendants Ye Jian and Lin Yong stole
inbred corn seeds from fields in Illinois and had numerous conversations about their
activities. Id. ¶¶ 42-64. These included conversations in which they specifically
discussed how they were stealing intellectual property, and the consequences if they
were caught. Id. ¶¶ 54-57. In September 2012, Mo Hailong instructed Ye Jian to
thoroughly clean the cars used to steal corn seed and to remove any “traceable
marks or clues.” Id. ¶ 71. Mo Hailong also explained how he and coconspirators
9

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 10 of 19

Wang Lei, and Dr. Li Shaoming had washed cars in the past for the same purpose.
Id. Also in September 2012, Mo Hailong smuggled stolen corn seed from Chicago to
his home in Florida; defendants Li Shaoming and Ye Jian attempted to smuggle
stolen corn seed from Illinois to China; and defendant Wang Honwei attempted to
smuggle stolen corn seed from Illinois to Canada. Id. ¶¶ 72-75.
All of this evidence—and more—will be part of the government’s case against
both defendants, and all of it is admissible against both. The overt acts of
defendant’s coconspirators are evidence of her guilt because defendant is
responsible for the foreseeable acts of coconspirators taken in furtherance of the
conspiracy. Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646-47 (1946); United States v.
Elder, 682 F.3d 1065, 1073 (8th Cir. 2012). Defendant was part of a conspiracy to
steal corn seed from American companies, smuggle it to China, and conceal the
scheme from American companies and law enforcement. In 2007 and 2008, she and
Mo Hailong discussed each part of the conspiracy, and defendant instructed Mo
Hailong about specific ways to carry it out. After these conversations, Mo Hailong
and other coconspirators carried out her instructions. Evidence of their acts in
furtherance of the conspiracy is admissible against defendant.4
While defendant notes that she left DBN in 2009, Dkt. 98-1 at 14, she does
not claim that she withdrew from the conspiracy. Defendant bears the burden of
proving her withdrawal, which requires evidence that she “took affirmative action
to withdraw from the conspiracy either by making a clean breast to the authorities
or by communicating [her] withdrawal in a manner reasonably calculated to reach
[her] coconspirators.” United States v. Zimmer, 299 F.3d 710 (8th Cir. 2002). Merely
ending her criminal activities is not enough to show withdrawal. Id. The indictment
alleges that defendant was a member of the conspiracy from its beginning in 2007 to
10
4

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 11 of 19

In addition, the statements of defendant’s coconspirators in furtherance of
the conspiracy are evidence of her guilt and are admissible against her under
Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). “The exchange of information is the lifeblood
of a conspiracy[,]” United States v. Pallais, 921 F.2d 684, 688 (7th Cir. 1990), and
this one was no different. The coconspirator statements summarized above, coupled
with the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, show the conspirators acting on
the plans defendant, Mo Hailong, and Li Shaoming formed in 2007 and 2008.
Defendant has not filed a motion to exclude these coconspirator statements, but her
severance motion claims they are inadmissible because the government has no
evidence, other than the coconspirator statements themselves, that defendant was
part of a conspiracy. Dkt. 98-1 at 16-17.
Defendant is wrong. There are two categories of independent evidence
showing defendant’s involvement in the conspiracy. First, in 2007 and 2008,
defendant, Mo Hailong, and Li Shaoming had numerous conversations, summarized
above, about Mo Hailong’s efforts to steal corn seed from companies in the United
States, send corn seed back to China, buy farmland in Iowa, and conceal the
conspiracy from others. Indictment ¶¶ 27-32. In some of those conversations,
defendant, who Li Shaoming described as being “in charge of the specifics” of the
conspiracy from China, gave Mo Hailong instructions about how to carry out the
conspiracy. Id. ¶¶ 27-29. Second, beginning in 2008 and continuing to the end of the
its conclusion in 2012, Indictment ¶ 25, and she is responsible for the acts of her
coconspirators during that time.
11

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 12 of 19

conspiracy in 2012, Mo Hailong and multiple other conspirators carried out
defendant’s instructions, stealing corn seed in Iowa and Illinois, smuggling and
attempting to smuggle it out of the country, buying farmland, and concealing their
actions from the victim companies and authorities. Id. ¶¶ 33-75.
To admit coconspirator statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), this court need
only find that a conspiracy exists by a preponderance of the evidence. Young, 753
F.3d at 771. In making that finding, the court may consider the content of the
coconspirator

statements

themselves—the

only

requirement

is

that

the

coconspirator statements cannot be the “sole evidence of the conspiracy.” United
States v. Ragland, 555 F.3d 706, 713 (8th Cir. 2009) (emphasis added). Here, the
independent evidence described above, coupled with the coconspirator statements
themselves, proves a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. The
coconspirator statements were made in furtherance of that conspiracy, and they are
admissible against defendant.
3. Nothing about a joint trial requires severance.
As described above, the government will introduce the same core of evidence
at trial against both defendants. Moreover, because the same evidence is admissible
against both defendants, there is no risk of the jury convicting defendant based on
evidence inadmissible against her—the problem of spillover. See Kindle, 925 F.2d at
277 (holding that severance was not warranted because “much of the testimony did
directly or indirectly implicate appellant in the conspiracy”). Whatever minor risk of
spillover exists does not justify severance. “Severance is never warranted simply
12

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 13 of 19

because the evidence against one defendant is more damaging than that against
another. . . . What is required for a severance is a specific showing that a jury could
not reasonably be expected to compartmentalize the evidence.” Hively, 437 F.3d at
765; accord Kime, 99 F.3d at 880. Even if there were evidence to compartmentalize
in this case, which there is not, the Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit have
repeatedly held that jury instructions can prevent any prejudice. See Zafiro, 506
U.S. at 939; Hively, 437 F.3d at 765; Kime, 99 F.3d at 880.
III.

Defendant is not entitled to severance merely in order to secure a
trial date before her codefendant.
Defendant’s main argument for severance is that she claims to want a trial

on December 1, 2014, while her co-defendant Mo Hailong is not prepared to go to
trial on that date. Dkt. 98-1 at 7-8, 14-16. But securing a trial before a codefendant
is not a basis for severance, and time is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act for
reasonable delay made necessary by the Act’s strong preference for joint trials.
A.

Severance is not justified merely to avoid a delay in trial.

As explained above, the Eighth Circuit has recognized that two types of
prejudice may justify severance, and trial delay is not one of them. See Sandstrom,
594 F.3d at 644 (recognizing irreconcilable defenses, and a jury’s inability
compartmentalize evidence a proper bases to sever). Other authorities agree. See,
e.g., 41 Geo. L.J. Ann. Rev. Crim. Procedure at 327-330 (2012) (collecting cases that
recognize four forms of prejudice warranting severance: mutually exclusive
defenses, antagonistic conduct by a codefendant’s attorney, a codefendant’s refusal
13

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 14 of 19

to give exculpatory testimony due to potential for self-incrimination, and the
introduction of a codefendant’s confession that incriminates the defendant).
This is no quirk of severance doctrine: the preference for joint trials is built
into the Speedy Trial Act itself. The Act provides that a district court must exclude
time under the Act for “[a] reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined
for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion
for severance has been granted.” 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(6). The Eighth Circuit has held
that this provision means that the speedy trial clocks of codefendants should be
synchronized, and that exclusions of time for one defendant apply to all defendants.
United States v. Lightfoot, 483 F.3d 876, 885-86 (8th Cir. 2007). Defendant claims
that the speedy trial clock for codefendant Mo Hailong has expired, Dkt. 98-1 at 12,
but that is incorrect. As the government explains in a separate filing, time should
be excluded for Mo Hailong until December 1, 2014, this exclusion should also apply
to defendant, and Mo Hailong’s speedy trial clock should be reset and synchronized
with defendant’s, which will leave them both with no expired time under the Act.
See Dkt. 104-1; Lightfoot, 483 F.3d at 885-86; 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(6).
As the Eighth Circuit has explained, the purpose of applying exclusions of
time to all defendants in a case “is to insure that the Speedy Trial Act does not alter
the present rules governing severance of co-defendants by forcing the government to
prosecute the defendants separately or be subject to a speedy trial dismissal
motion.” Lightfoot, 483 F.3d at 886 (citing United States v. Monroe, 833 F.2d 95, 100
(6th Cir. 1987); United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 532 (1st Cir. 2005)).
14

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 15 of 19

Time excluded for one defendant is excluded for all to “prevent[] speedy trial
concerns from deterring the government from seeking to join defendants.” Lightfoot,
483 F.3d at 886.
Without this rule, the Speedy Trial Act would become “a sword that can be
used to shred the joinder rules”—an outcome Congress specifically guarded against.
Vega-Molina, 407 F.3d at 532. “The legislative history of this section demonstrates a
strong Congressional preference for joint trials and an intention that delays
attributable to the joinder of defendants be liberally excluded.” Monroe, 833 F.2d at
100. Indeed, by providing that all defendants should be on the same speedy trial
clock, Congress “explicitly recognized the utility of multi-defendant trials to
effectuate the prompt efficient disposition of criminal justice [feeling that] the
efficiency and economy of joint trials far outweighed the desirability of granting
severance where the criterion was simply the passage of time.” Id.; accord United
States v. Otero-Hernandez, 743 F.2d 857, 859 (11th Cir. 1984); United States v.
Varella, 692 F.2d 1352, 1359 (11th Cir. 1982).
In passing the Act, Congress explained that it did not want district courts to
be “forced to grant severances unnecessarily in multi-defendant cases so that a
defendant whose case was moving slowly would not hold up the trial of his
codefendants,” Varella, 692 F.2d at 1359—the exact demand defendant makes here.
Following Congress’s instruction, courts have denied Speedy Trial Act and
severance claims of defendants based on significant trial delays made necessary by
a joint trial. See, e.g., United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2005)
15

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 16 of 19

(holding that defendant held in custody was not entitled to severance based on
delay of three years and five months that resulted from joint trial); Vega-Molina,
407 F.3d at 532-33 (holding that there was no Speedy Trial Act violation for a yearand-a-half delay of trial that resulted because a codefendant’s lawyer was
unavailable during the delay).
B.

Delay of trial is reasonable.

Like defendant, the government wants to proceed to trial at the earliest
feasible date. The government acknowledges that defendant is separated from her
children, but such collateral consequences of criminal charges are hardly unique to
this case. Defendant’s inability to travel to China is necessary in light of this court’s
finding that she “poses a substantial risk of flight.” Dkt. 90 at 5. Defendant is not in
custody, and the government and defendant are working together on a proposal that
would permit defendant to travel to Los Angeles in the coming weeks to visit her
children.
In preparation for trial, the government has been diligently reviewing
discovery, has disclosed voluminous material as soon as it has become available (so
much that defendant complains about the volume, Dkt. 97-1 at 2), and is working to
declassify the relatively small amount of additional material as soon as possible.
But some delay past the current trial date of December 1 is inevitable. And such
delay is also reasonable.
First, defendant’s pretrial litigation strategy alone may require a delay.
Defendant has filed a motion to sever and a motion for a bill of particulars, and the
16

Case 4:13-cr-00147-SMR-CFB Document 105 Filed 09/17/14 Page 17 of 19

court has scheduled a hearing on these motions on October 1, 2014. Dkt. 103.
Defendant’s severance motion announces her intention to file the following
additional pretrial motions: (1) a motion to exclude defendant’s statements to Mo
Hailong in the instant messenger chat sessions; (2) a motion to exclude
coconspirator statements; (3) a motion to suppress defendant’s pre-arrest
statements to the FBI; and (4) a possible motion to dismiss the indictment under
the Speedy Trial Act and Sixth Amendment. Dkt. 98-1 at 7-8, 11-12. Defendant’s
argument for severance assumes that this court will grant all of these additional
motions, although none of them have merit.
There is currently no deadline for filing pretrial motions, and defendant has
informed the government that she may file motions in addition to those listed
above, some of which by their nature, would cause significant time to fully address.
If defendant files extensive pretrial motions, and particularly those that raise
complex factual or legal issues, the time necessary for the government to respond
and the court to rule will likely make the December trial date unrealistic.
Second, because of the volume of discovery, the fact that much of it is in
Mandarin, and the fact that some of it has not yet been disclosed because it is still
classified, defendant Mo Hailong’s attorneys have informed the court that they will
not be prepared for trial by December 1. Dkt. 99. These are good reasons to delay
the trial, and they apply to both defendants.
Third, all of the reasons that create a strong presumption in favor of joint
trials apply with particular force in this case. Separate trials would be lengthy,
17

complicated, and nearly identical. Because the government’s case would be nearly
the same, a separate trial would not protect defendant from prejudice during the
trial itself. And separate trials would risk the “scandal” of inconsistent jury verdicts,
while prejudicing the government by allowing Mo Hailong to see the government’s
entire case far in advance of his own trial. See Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 537; Richardson v.
Marsh, 481 U.S. at 210.
The Eighth Circuit has said that “[r]arely, if ever, will it be improper for coconspirators to be tried together.” Kime, 99 F.3d at 880. This is not the rare case.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, the court should deny defendant Mo Yun’s motion to sever.

Respectfully Submitted,
Nicholas A. Klinefeldt
