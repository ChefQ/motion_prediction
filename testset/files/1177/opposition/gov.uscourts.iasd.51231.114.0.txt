I.

INTRODUCTION
While reciting the general law regarding severance, the Government ignores the fact that

the case against Mo Yun (“Ms. Mo”) involves no evidence of her involvement in the charged
conspiracy during any time period in which an alleged theft of trade secrets took place. And
while falling back on the argument that a conspiracy does not require proof of an actual theft, the
Government further ignores the fact that none of the alleged excerpts of conversations
purportedly involving Ms. Mo from 2007-08 reference obtaining seeds other than those that are
sold and grown in the marketplace. In other words, the Government does not even possess a
theory, much less evidence, which establishes that the conversations in 2007-08 related to seeds
that enjoyed trade secret protection. Finally, the Government must acknowledge the enormous
gap in time between the 2007-08 excerpts and the 2011-12 alleged acts of theft – a gap which
includes Ms. Mo terminating her employment with DBN no later than March 2009. It is a last
gasp effort to suggest that anyone could reasonably extend Pinkerton liability this far.
Judged against this background as well as the general dearth of evidence against Ms. Mo,
she asks the Court to exercise its discretion and sever her trial from that of Mo Hailong.
Severance is necessary to accord respect to Ms. Mo’s rights to a speedy and fair trial – rights
whose importance is paramount in light of the harsh circumstances arising out of Ms. Mo’s arrest
and lengthy separation from her children, husband, parents and community. This separation has
already caused irreparable harm to the children and Ms. Mo.
While alleged co-conspirators are routinely tried together, this case is anything but
routine.1 Because the decision to grant severance depends on the individual circumstances and
1

None of the severance cases cited by the Government involved defendants whose alleged
acts were so removed in time from the operative acts of the conspiracy, where the evidence was
as thin and isolated as the evidence here, and where the damaging effect of the pre-trial

evidence of each case, courts are granted wide discretion in this area to determine what is just
and fair. See United States v. Wint, 974 F.2d 961, 966 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Swarek,
656 F.2d 331, 337 n.4 (8th Cir. 1981). Here, the just and fair way to respect Ms. Mo’s right to a
speedy trial and not to be unfairly tainted by the evidence not involving her is to sever her case
and set an early trial date.
II.

ARGUMENT
The Government contends that its problems timely producing discovery in this case,

together with Ms. Mo’s intended motions, preclude a December 1 trial. This argument is
disingenuous. First, if the Government indicts a defendant but is not prepared to produce
discovery reasonably in advance of the scheduled trial date, due process dictates that it should be
precluded from using that evidence against the defendant. It is not the defendant’s burden to
wait for the Government to get its act together.2 Second, the Court can and should impose
reasonable deadlines for production of discovery and pretrial motions such that a December 1
trial can go forward. Ms. Mo will file her motions in accordance with that schedule. Given the
Government’s thin case against Ms. Mo, its aggressive and distorted interpretation of the instant
separation from family is so harsh. See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534 (1993) (defendants
arrested after joint delivery of drugs); Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987) (defendants
charged based on single, joint attack); United States v. Sandstrom, 594 F.3d 634 (8th Cir. 2010)
(defendants charged with single shooting); United States v. Al-Esawi, 560 F.3d 888 (8th Cir.
2009) (question was whether to sever different counts, not co-conspirators); United States v.
Hively, 437 F.3d 752, 765 (8th Cir. 2006) (defendants engaged in Government grant fraud which
required simultaneous conduct by both); United States v. Mickelson, 378 F.3d 810 (8th Cir.
2004) (defendants were employees at same store where they used position to acquire and then
sell pseudophedrine); United States v. Kime, 99 F.3d 870, 880 (8th Cir. 1996) (drug charges
based on one-month wiretap investigation).
2

See, e.g. United States v. Davis, 244 F.3d 666, 673 (8th Cir. 2001) (affirming exclusion of
evidence provided by Government after discovery deadline “in order to maintain the integrity of
the judicial process and respect the pressing scheduling problems of the district court”); and
United States v. Pherigo, 327 F.3d 690, 694 (8th Cir. 2003) (setting forth standard for excluding
evidence not timely produced by Government).

message excerpts, and its handling of her interrogation, none of the intended motions should be a
surprise. The Government should be prepared to respond in a timely manner. There is no reason
to delay.
Next, the Government assures the Court that the trial evidence against both Ms. Mo and
her brother will be the same. This is far from accurate. By way of example only:


The last allegation regarding Ms. Mo is from January 2008, and the indictment
makes clear that she resigned from DBN in March 2009. The only allegations of
actual trade secret theft relate to events alleged to have taken place in 2011-12.



There is no allegation that Ms. Mo ever even discussed stealing trade secrets, let
alone actually stole any.



The evidence relating to Mo Hailong apparently consists of witness testimony,
audio and video recordings, documentary evidence, surveillance records, and
more. The “evidence” involving Ms. Mo consists of a handful of purported
instant message excerpts.



The alleged excerpts were found on Mo Hailong’s computer. The Government
will surely argue that the excerpts are admissible against Mo Hailong merely
because they were in his possession. But to introduce them as against Ms. Mo,
the Government faces the significant (and, Ms. Mo contends, insurmountable)
burden of authenticating the excerpts as containing accurate and trustworthy
copies of statements by Ms. Mo.3

At its most basic level, then, the evidence purportedly implicating Ms. Mo is vastly
different from the evidence against Mo Hailong or any of her alleged co-conspirators. The
Government’s suggestion otherwise only highlights the concern that a joint trial would subject
Ms. Mo to being smeared by evidence that is irrelevant or should not be admissible as against
her. In light of the difference in quantity and type of evidence as between Ms. Mo and her
3

The Government fails entirely to explain how it intends to authenticate excerpts of instant
messages saved in a format which is inherently unreliable. The relevance of United States v.
Garrison, 168 F.3d 1089 (8th Cir. 1999), cited by the Government on this point, is unclear. Opp.
at 8. There, the defendant claimed that evidence introduced at trial was fabricated because it
conflicted with trial testimony. 168 F.3d at 1094. Here, as the Government must concede, there
will be no witness at all who can authenticate the excerpts.

brother, the Government’s contention that a limiting instruction could resolve the resulting
prejudice is absurd.4
Nor has the Government made any showing that the evidence related to Ms. Mo is
anything but exceedingly thin. Rather, its response – both in its opposition to this motion and at
the bail hearing several weeks ago – has been to assert that the excerpts are “independent
evidence” of Ms. Mo’s participation in the alleged conspiracy, permitting the Government to
then introduce as against Ms. Mo later-in-time statements and acts not involving her at all. But
even the Government does not assert that the excerpts are, by themselves, inculpatory. Instead, it
insists that they implicate Ms. Mo when interpreted in light of those later-in-time statements and
acts not involving Ms. Mo. The case agent conceded as much at the bail hearing and the
Government now admits it again. See Opp. at 11-12. But it is only through the excerpts that the
later statements and acts could potentially become admissible. This, then, is not “independent”
evidence; it is improper bootstrapping, and the Government should not be permitted to bootstrap
its way through basic evidentiary requirements.5
In the indictment, at the bail hearing, and in its opposition to this motion, the Government
has suggested that Ms. Mo played a key role in this alleged conspiracy. That assertion is belied,
however, by the dearth of evidence against her, and by the acknowledgement that Ms. Mo
stopped working for DBN years before the events that form the gravamen of the indictment are
4

Ms. Mo raised the looming evidentiary issues to explain just how prejudicial a joint trial
would be. While the Government attacks Ms. Mo for not yet having filed her motions in limine,
this misses the point. Even if the excerpts were somehow deemed to be admissible against Ms.
Mo, the unfair prejudice that would result from a joint trial remains for all the reasons described
here and in Ms. Mo’s original motion.
5

United States v. Ragland, 555 F.3d 706, 713 (8th Cir. 2009), cited by the Government, is
inapposite. There, the court had independent witness testimony about the defendant’s
involvement in the alleged conspiracy. Here, there are no witnesses who will testify that Ms. Mo
was part of any criminal conspiracy.

alleged to have occurred. Moreover, it relies entirely on the Government’s own self-serving
interpretations of purported excerpts from 2007-08. Indeed, it argues – unpersuasively – that
statements made and acts committed by other people years later were somehow foreseeable to
Ms. Mo, even though it has no witness or evidence to connect them together. The alleged Mo
Yun excerpts from 2007-08 do not discuss theft, and by arguing that they provide evidence of the
charged conspiracy, the Government seeks to stretch the rules of evidence beyond reason.
III.

CONCLUSION
The continued separation of Ms. Mo from her children and family is based on evidence

which is unreliable, inadmissible, and most egregiously, not incriminating. This is not the
“normal” case; here, all of the alleged acts of theft occurred years after Ms. Mo was gone from
the company and nobody is alleging she was involved in any of them. Under these unique
circumstances, Ms. Mo should not be forced to endure the unfair prejudice that would result
from a joint trial. She asks that this Court exercise its discretion, sever her case from Mo
Hailong, and allow her to proceed to trial on December 1.
