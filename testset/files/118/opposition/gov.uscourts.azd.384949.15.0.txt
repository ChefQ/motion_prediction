PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO DISMISS PRE-DEATH
SUFFERING CLAIMS
(Assigned to the Honorable David G.
Campbell)

(Oral Argument Requested)

Plaintiffs offer this response in opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss

25 Plaintiffs’ claims for pre-death pain and suffering. They contend that Arizona’s
26 wrongful death and survivor statutes preclude the award of pre-death pain and suffering

damages to Carol Gotbaum’s Estate. They are wrong. Here, the Defendants used
excessive force on Carol, were deliberately indifferent to her medical needs, improperly
restrained her and left her alone, shackled in a holding cell, in violation of her
constitutional rights. Had she lived, she could have sought pain and suffering damages
for these violations. But because Defendants’ acts and omissions caused her death (the
most severe injury possible), Defendants argue that these claims are invalid under
§ 1983, because Arizona law precludes recovery for pre-death pain and suffering and
because federal law is silent on this question. If this were so, it would effectively
preclude Carol’s Estate of any meaningful recovery under § 1983. The question for the
Court is simple: Would it further § 1983’s remedial purpose to apply Arizona law to
eliminate Carol’s claim under § 1983 simply because the Constitutional violations in
this case resulted in her death, instead of permanent injury? And the answer is
obvious: Of course not. For that reason, courts around the country have concluded that
where, as here, a state statute purports to preclude such a claim under § 1983, it cannot
stand in the way of compensating the estate and its creditors for the violations of the
decedent’s civil rights. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with § 1983 and,
therefore, invalid. See 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Carol Gotbaum was a 45 year old mother of three young children at the time of

her death on September 28, 2007, in a holding cell at Sky Harbor Airport. [Compl., ¶ ¶
16, 17, 20, 27, 28.] She was en route from her home in New York City to an alcohol
rehabilitation center in Tucson on the day of her death. [Id. ¶ 30, 33.] After being
bumped twice from her connecting flight to Tucson, Carol went into an emotional
tailspin: She dropped to the floor of the terminal in despair, tossed her Blackberry, and

ran up the concourse, yelling that she was not a terrorist. [Id. ¶ ¶ 34, 36, 38.] Three
Phoenix Police Officers approached Carol and within seconds took her to the ground on
her abdomen, cuffed her arms behind her, hauled her to her feet and marched and
dragged her through the terminal to the Police substation in Terminal 4. [Id. ¶ ¶ 40, 41,
46, 47.] There, they shackled Carol to an eyebolt on a stationary concrete bench in a
holding cell with a set of leg irons, her hands still cuffed behind her back, and left her
alone and unobserved. [Id. ¶ ¶ 48, 49, 50.] Some time later, one of the officers noticed
that Carol was silent, looked into the holding cell and saw Carol sitting on the floor in
front of the bench, her hands now under her chin in front of her body, with the leg iron
chain across her neck. She was not moving. [Id. ¶ 51.] Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
was unsuccessful and Carol was pronounced dead at 3:29 p.m. [Id. ¶ 52.]

Plaintiffs have alleged claims based on state law and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 resulting
from Carol’s death. Her Estate is properly seeking damages for pre-death pain and
suffering pursuant to § 1983. [Id. Prayer for Relief (e), p. 24.]
II.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
The Estate’s Claim for Pre-Death Pain and Suffering Is Not Precluded by
Arizona Statute and Denial of That Claim Would Thwart the Express
Purpose of § 1983.

Defendants contend that the Estate’s federal claims for pre-death pain and
suffering under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are barred by Arizona’s statutory preclusion of pain
and suffering damages for survival actions, A.R.S. § 14-3110, and by Arizona’s
wrongful death statutes. They are not. As courts in Arizona and around the country
have concluded, when § 1983 claims are premised upon constitutional deprivations that
caused the death of the individual, state law cannot bar the Estate’s recovery of predeath pain and suffering. To do so would be entirely inconsistent with the express
purposes of compensation and deterrence under § 1983. See 42 U.S.C. § 1988. It

would also unfairly deprive Carol’s Estate and its creditors of any recovery for the
deprivations of Carol’s constitutional rights, simply because the violations killed Carol
instead of permanently injuring her.1

The primary purposes of § 1983 are well-established: To compensate the victims
of constitutional deprivations and to deter future constitutional violations by such
awards. E.g., Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 403 (1997); Wyatt v. Cole, 504
U.S. 158, 161 (1992) cert. denied 510 U.S. 977 (1993); Anderson v. Warner, 451 F.3d
1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2006).

The Supreme Court has implicitly recognized that

punishment, while perhaps not the prominent purpose, is also a permissible purpose of
§ 1983 liability. City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. at 268. Because
§ 1983 contains no enumeration of recoverable damages, the Court must make that
determination. 42 U.S.C. § 1988; Gilbaugh ex rel. Gilbaugh v. Balzer, No. Civ. 991576-AS, 2001 WL 34041889, *6-7 (D. Or. June, 7, 2001). Courts may look to state
law in determining the appropriate scope of recovery. See 42 U.S.C. § 1988. “The
court may not, however, mold the constitutional claim to fit within the parameters of
state law.”

Bass by Lewis v. Wallenstein, 769 F.2d 1173, 1188 (7th Cir. 1985)

(emphasis added). State law remedies can only be adopted for a § 1983 claim if doing
so would not be inconsistent with § 1983’s purposes. Id.; see also Smith v. Wade, 461
U.S. 30 (1983) (holding, as a general rule, punitive damages are recoverable under
§ 1983, without respect to state law).

21

Under the rationale proffered in Defendants’ Motion, had Carol survived and sued for
her pain and suffering, Defendants would have no legal basis to challenge the
23 recoverability of such damages. This, of course, highlights the inconsistency with
which the application of state law to Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims in this case would work
24 an injustice under Defendants’ arguments: To deny the primary source of Carol’s
recovery under § 1983, simply because the constitutional violation, here, resulted in
25 Carol’s death instead of injury.

Plaintiffs do not dispute that Arizona’s survivor statute, which allows claims to
be brought on behalf of Carol’s Estate, specifically bars the recovery of pain-andsuffering damages for any state claims. But, such a limitation on the Estate’s federal
claims, in this case, would be entirely inconsistent with § 1983’s purpose of providing
compensation to Carol for the deprivation of her Constitutional rights and deterring such
conduct in the future. Here, the violation of Carol’s rights caused her injuries and
death. [Compl. ¶ 115.] Indeed, the primary measure of damages in this case for the
significant deprivations of Carol’s constitutional rights is her pre-death pain and
suffering.

To take those damages away would be to seriously diminish the

compensation to Carol and her Estate, as the victim of constitutional deprivations that
resulted in her death. This would be patently inconsistent with § 1983’s stated purpose
of providing compensation to the victim for deprivations of constitutional rights.2 See,
e.g., Gilbaugh, 2001 WL 34041889 at *6-7 (holding Oregon statute deprived estate of
meaningful recovery for constitutional deprivation and, thus, was inconsistent with
§ 1983’s remedial purposes).
The vast majority of courts that have been faced with the prospect of applying
state law to preclude significant damages in wrongful death cases, like here, have
almost uniformly concluded that the application of state law would be inconsistent with
§ 1983’s remedial purposes. For example, in Gilbaugh, the Estate of a man killed by
police officers brought a claim under § 1983 for deprivations of the decedent’s
constitutional rights. 2001 WL 34041889. The decedent was killed immediately by
police gunfire. Thus, the majority of damages in the case were general, arising from the
fear and pre-impact terror suffered when he saw the police officer point the gun at his

24

Plaintiffs, Carol’s minor children, have separate claims for the violations of their own
25 14th Amendment rights to the existence of the parent-child relationship. Those claims,
of course, also arise out of Carol’s death.

face. Id. at *5-6. But such general/pre-impact terror damages were precluded by
Oregon statute. The District Court recognized that the application of Oregon law, in
that case, would be inconsistent with § 1983’s purposes, because it would effectively
eliminate the compensation to the victim for the deprivation of constitutional rights.
If the court held that Plaintiff’s Section 1983 action was barred by
the state wrongful death statute, Plaintiff’s sole remedy for Gilbaugh’s
death would be for funeral expenses under the common law tort claim.
Plaintiff would have no way to recover anything for the deprivation of
Gilbaugh’s federal civil rights. The message this would send to state
actors is that they can kill older, unmarried individuals with near
impunity. As long as the victim is killed quickly and cleanly, the most
their employer will be liable for is funeral expenses. This is clearly
inconsistent with the purposes of Section 1983. Gilbaugh, at *7.

This was also, in essence, the conclusion reached by the Arizona Court of
Appeals in Badia v. City of Casa Grande, 195 Ariz. 349, 988 P.2d 134 (Ct. App. 1999).
In Badia, the issue before the court was whether Arizona’s survivor statute would
preclude a § 1983 claim for pain and suffering brought by the Estate of a man who died
of causes unrelated to the constitutional deprivations.

The court held that the

application of Arizona law was not inconsistent in the circumstances of that case; but, it
took great pains to infer a different result where the death was caused by the
constitutional deprivations:

20

Inasmuch as Perez’s death in this case did not result from defendants’
alleged use of excessive force, § 14-3110 neither frustrates nor is
inconsistent with the policies and purposes of § 1983. Badia, 195 Ariz. at
355-56, 988 P.2d at 140-41 (emphasis added).

21

The Supreme Court also inferred the same conclusion in Robertson v. Wegmann,

19

22 436 U.S. 584 (1991). There, the Court upheld a Louisiana statute that caused a § 1983
23 claim to abate when the victim died of causes unrelated to the constitutional deprivation.
24 But the Court took time to distinguish the case from the situation where, like here, the
25 death resulted from the constitutional deprivation: “the fact that a particular action
26 might abate surely would not adversely affect § 1983’s role in preventing official

In line with these authorities, courts have held survivor statutes, like Arizona’s,
to be inconsistent with § 1983 in cases where the constitutional deprivation resulted in
the victim’s death. For example, in Berry v. City of Milwaukee, 900 F.2d 1489 (10th
Cir. 1990), the Tenth Circuit performed a comprehensive analysis of § 1983 wrongful
death recovery, in light of an Oklahoma survivor statute that, like Arizona’s, precluded
recovery for the pre-death pain and suffering of the decedent. Id. at 1500 (“[f]rom our
analysis, we conclude that Congress envisioned a significant remedy for wrongful
killings resulting from conduct proscribed by § 1983”). The Tenth Circuit concluded
that application of state law survivor statutes to effectively preclude recovery for
wrongful death violations was inconsistent with the purposes of § 1983 and would lead
to varied results across the country. Accordingly, the court concluded that the “federal
remedy [was] to be applied to § 1983 cases,” which would be “a survival action,
brought by the estate of the deceased victim, in accord with § 1983’s express statement
that the liability is to the party injured.” Id. at 1506-07. Relying on a string of decisions
by the United States Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit concluded that Oklahoma’s
limitation on survival actions was inconsistent with § 1983; instead, it concluded,
“appropriate compensatory damages would include medical and burial expenses, pain
and suffering before death, loss of earnings based upon the probable duration of the
victim’s life had the injury not occurred, the victim’s loss of consortium, and other
damages recognized in common law tort actions.” Id. at 1507.

23
24

The same conclusion has been reached by other circuit courts, as well as district
courts within the Ninth Circuit.3 E.g., Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052, 1063 (8th Cir.

25

The Ninth Circuit has not addressed this issue.

2001) (“Berry, represents the correct assessment of the damages available in § 1983
death cases” which included pre-death pain and suffering); Jaco v. Bloechle, 739 F.2d
239, 245 (6th Cir. 1984) (refusing to apply Ohio law limit to recovery, concluding it
was “hostile” to § 1983); Garcia v. Whitehead, 961 F. Supp. 230, 233 (C.D. Cal. 1997)
(holding California’s survival statute, which excluded damages for decedent’s pain and
suffering, was inconsistent with federal civil rights laws).

Consistent with this

approach, this Court explained to County Defendants less than two years ago that a
decedent’s claims are viable under Arizona law and separate from any claim by the
survivors. See Wilson v. Maricopa County, 463 F. Supp.2d 987, 987-99 (D. Ariz. 2006)
(Campbell, J.) (discussing the liability of the County for violating decedent’s rights,
then acknowledging the separate claims brought by the parents of an adult child).
To support their position, Defendants cite only a single case, Venerable v. City of
Sacramento, 185 F. Supp. 2d 1128 (E.D.Cal. 2002), in which a state survival statute was
invoked to preclude pre-death pain and suffering damages in a § 1983 claim. It is not
persuasive. California has issued opinions, in both state and federal courts, that fall on
both sides of this issue.

The following courts have refused to apply California’s

survival statute to § 1983 claims, finding it to be inconsistent with the purposes of
§ 1983: Garcia v. Whitehead, 961 F. Supp. 230, 233 (C.D.Cal. 1997): Williams v. City
of Oakland, 915 F. Supp. 1074, 1078-79 (N.D.Cal. 1996) (the death in this case did not
result from the constitutional violation); Guyton v. Phillips, 532 F. Supp. 1154, 11671168 (N.D.Cal 1981). The California Supreme Court in County of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court, 21 Cal. 4th 292, 308, 981 P.2d 68, 78 (1999), held that its survival
statute could be applied to preclude damages for the decedent’s pre-death pain and
suffering in a civil rights case, when the death was not a result of the constitutional
violation, but expressly did not reach the question of its applicability in those situations

where the constitutional violation did cause the death. “Therefore we express no view
on whether the preclusion of pain and suffering damages under California’s survival law
would be inconsistent with the policies underlying the federal civil rights law in those
situations where the asserted constitutional deprivation caused the death.” Finally, two
other courts applied the survival statute to preclude pre-death pain and suffering in
§ 1983 actions. One of these is relied on by Defendants. Their reliance is not justified.

9

In Venerable v. City of Sacramento, 185 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1132 (E.D.Cal.,
2002) the court expressly recognized that its holding was contrary to that reached by
other California courts:

10

Despite the modernization of California law, and the permission of
survival actions for personal injury torts, some federal district courts have
declined to apply the California limitation on recovery of a decedent's
pain and suffering. These courts find that the deterrence provided in the
California survival statute is inadequate and therefore inconsistent with
§ 1983. See, e.g., Garcia v. Whitehead, 961 F. Supp. 230, 233
(C.D.Cal.1997); Williams v. City of Oakland, 915 F. Supp. 1074
(N.D.Cal.1996); Guyton v. Phillips, 532 F. Supp. 1154 (N.D.Cal.1981).

In light of these authorities, Defendants’ Motion should be denied. Depriving the
Estate of pain-and-suffering damages would, under the circumstances, reduce the
compensation intended to redress the violation of Carol’s rights by Defendants. It
neither makes sense nor is it consistent with the purposes of § 1983 for the Court to
eliminate those damages simply because Carol died. Accordingly, Arizona’s survivor
statute does not apply and cannot bar recovery of Carol’s pain-and-suffering under
§ 1983, for the manner in which Defendants deprived Carol of her constitutional rights
and, ultimately, her life. The Court should deny Defendants’ Motion in its entirety.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons and based upon the foregoing authorities, Plaintiffs

respectfully request that the Court deny Defendants’ Motion.
