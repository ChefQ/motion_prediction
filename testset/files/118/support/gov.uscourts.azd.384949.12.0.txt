DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
DISMISS PRE-DEATH
SUFFERING CLAIMS

Plaintiffs,

17

19

NO. CV08-937-PHX-DGC

Under Arizona’s Wrongful Death Act, A.R.S. § 12-611, et seq., Plaintiffs
cannot recover damages for a decedent's pre-death suffering. Moreover, Plaintiffs cannot
1937193.1

1

recover damages for a decedent's pre-death suffering under Arizona’s survival statute,

2

A.R.S. § 14-3110. In addition, because federal law is silent on this issue, the Estate of

3

Carol Anne Gotbaum is also precluded from recovering damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983

4

due to the appropriate application of the law of Arizona, the forum state. Thus, dismissal

5

of any claim for the alleged pre-death suffering of Carol Anne Gotbaum is mandated

6

pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P.

7

I.

FACTS

8

This case arises out of the death of Carol Anne Gotbaum at Phoenix Sky

9

Harbor Airport while in the custody of Phoenix Police. Plaintiffs filed first in Arizona

10

Superior Court; Defendants removed that action to Federal District Court.

11

Plaintiffs bring this wrongful death action pursuant to A.R.S. §12-611, et

12

seq., DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT and 42 U.S.C. §1983.1 Plaintiffs specifically allege

13

in their First Amended Complaint that the Estate has suffered damages in the form of pre-

14

death pain and suffering pursuant to applicable law.2

NO PLAINTIFF CAN RECOVER PRE-DEATH SUFFERING DAMAGES
UNDER ARIZONA’S WRONGFUL DEATH STATUTES.
Under Arizona’s wrongful death statutes, statutory beneficiaries may

recover damages that the decedent would have been able to recover, had death not ensued.
A.R.S. § 12-611, et seq. “[A]n action for wrongful death is an original and distinct claim
for damages sustained independent of those injuries personal to the decedent.” Halenar v.
Superior Court, 109 Ariz. 27, 29, 504 P.2d 928, 930 (1972) (emphasis added); see also In
re Lister’s Estate, 22 Ariz. 185, 195 P. 1113 (1921) (wrongful death statute creates a new
cause of action for the wrongful death). Claims by the beneficiaries under the wrongful
death statute, however, are not derived from the decedent’s claims. Schoenrock v. Cigna
Health Plan of Ariz., Inc., 148 Ariz. 548, 550, 715 P.2d 1236, 1238 (App. 1985) (citing
Huebner v. Deuchle, 109 Ariz. 549, 514 P.2d 470 (1973)). Statutory beneficiaries recover

for damages they suffered from the death of the decedent – not those injuries the

2

decedent suffered. See Mullen v. Posada Del Sol Health Care Ctr., 169 Ariz. 399, 400,

3

819 P.2d 985, 986 (App. 1991)(emphasis added). For example, beneficiaries may recover

4

for “loss of love, affection, companionship, consortium, [and] personal anguish and

5

suffering.”

6

Plaintiff, including the Estate of Carol Anne Gotbaum, from recovering damages for any

7

alleged pre-death suffering by Carol Gotbaum because they did not personally suffer those

injuries.

Thus, the wrongful death statutes preclude any

PLAINTIFFS CANNOT RECOVER DAMAGES FOR PRE-DEATH
SUFFERING UNDER ARIZONA’S SURVIVAL STATUTE.
Plaintiffs have not alleged any claims under Arizona's survival statute.

Plaintiffs incorporated all of their claims, including their inappropriate claims for pain and
suffering noted above, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is silent as to
whether pain and suffering damages survive death. But Arizona law, specifically A.R.S.
§14-3110, is not. In areas on which federal law is silent, federal courts must borrow the
law of the forum state unless it is inconsistent with the purposes of the federal law. 42
U.S.C. § 1988.
Arizona's survival statute provides as follows:

18

Every cause of action, except a cause of action for damages
for breach of promise to marry, seduction, libel, slander,
separate maintenance, alimony, loss of consortium or invasion
of the right of privacy, shall survive the death of the person
entitled thereto or liable therefore, and may be asserted by or
against the personal representative of such person, provided
that upon the death of the person injured, damages for
pain and suffering of such injured person shall not be
allowed.

Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 14-3110 (emphasis added)

Id. (emphasis added).

Arizona law is clear: pre-death pain and suffering of a decedent is not
actionable.

27

Under federal law, a federal court sitting in Arizona would apply the

28

Arizona survival statute precluding a decedent's estate from recovering pain and suffering
1937193.1

damages to determine damages available in federal civil rights claims. 42 U.S.C. § 1983;

2

42 U.S.C. § 1988; Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 14-3110. In the present matter, Arizona's survival

3

statute prohibits recovery of damages for the decedent's pain and suffering and, thus,

4

precludes the §1983 claims allegedly stemming from the pre-death pain and suffering of

5

Carol Anne Gotbaum.

7

PLAINTIFFS CANNOT RECOVER DAMAGES FOR PRE-DEATH
SUFFERING UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

8

An Arizona court has already held that Arizona’s survival statute is not

9

inconsistent with § 1983 by precluding recovery of pre-death pain and suffering. Badia v.

10

City of Casa Grande, 195 Ariz. 349, 988 P.2d 134 (App. 1999). Other courts have also

11

held survivorship statutes similar to Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 14-3110 are not inconsistent with

12

the purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and, therefore, a plaintiff cannot recover for the

13

decedent's pain and suffering. See, e.g., Venerable v. City of Sacramento, 185 F. Supp. 2d

14

1128, 1133 (E.D. Cal. 2002). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court stated, “[a]

15

state statute cannot be considered ‘inconsistent’ with federal law merely because the

16

statute causes the plaintiff to lose the litigation.” Robertson v. Wegman, 436 U.S. 584,

17

593 (1978). Under Arizona’s wrongful death and survival statutes statutes, there is no

18

basis for statutory beneficiaries to recover for pre-death injuries suffered by the decedent

19

under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 or otherwise.

20

V.

CONCLUSION

21
22

In the First Amended Complaint, the Estate of Carol Anne Gotbaum

23

specifically seeks damages for pre-death pain and suffering of the decedent, Carol Anne

24

Gotbaum. Nevertheless, the Estate is not entitled to pursue such damages in an Arizona

25

wrongful death action. The wrongful death statutes, A.R.S. §12-611, et seq. and the

26

survival statute, A.R.S. § 14-3110 specifically forbid such a claim. In addition, due to the

27

silence of federal law on this issue, the Estate is also precluded from recovering damages

28

under 42 U.S.C. §1983 after the appropriate application of the law of Arizona, the forum

state. Therefore, Defendants move this Court for an order dismissing all claims for pre-

2

death pain and suffering alleged in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint.
