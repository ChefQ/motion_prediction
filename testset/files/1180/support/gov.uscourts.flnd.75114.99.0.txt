EMERGENCY MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION
AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Defendant, the Clerk of Court of Washington, County, Florida ("Clerk"),
moves for clarification of the Court's Order Denying the Motions to Dismiss,
Granting a Preliminary Injunction, and Temporarily Staying the Injunction dated
August 21, 2014 ("Injunction"). Specifically, the Clerk requests clarification as to
whether the Injunction requires that the Clerk only issue marriage licenses to
Stephen Schlairet and Ozzie Russ as specifically set forth in the Injunction, both of

whom are parties to this matter, or if the Injunction requires that the Clerk issue
Case 4:14-cv-00107-RH-CAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/14 Page 2 of 6

marriage licenses to all same-sex couples who apply once the stay expires at the
end of the day on January 5, 2015.

Because this matter presents issues that are extremely time sensitive and
require immediate resolution, and because there are criminal penalties associated
with the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the state of Florida
which could place the Clerk in immediate jeopardy if she inadvertently acts outside
the scope of the Injunction, the Clerk respectfully requests that the Court waive the
time requirements of Local Rule 7.1 and hear this matter on an expedited basis.
The more particular grounds for this motion are stated in the supporting
memorandum below.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The Injunction requires the Clerk to issue a marriage license to Stephen
Schlairet and Ozzie Russ, a same-sex couple, "the later of (a) 21 days after any
stay of this preliminary injunction expires or (b) 14 days after al information is
provided and all steps are taken that would be required in the ordinary course of
business as a prerequisite to issuing a marriage license to an opposite-sex couple."
Injunction at 32, | 6. The Court entered a stay of the Injunction pending appeal.
Id. at 32-33. By order dated December 3, 2014 in Case No. 14-14061, the

Eleventh Circuit denied a motion to extend the stay. On Friday, December 19,
Case 4:14-cv-00107-RH-CAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/14 Page 3 of 6

2014, the United States Supreme Court also denied an application for stay.
Therefore, the stay expires at the end of the day on January 5, 2015.

The Clerk will comply with the Injunction upon the expiration of the stay
and, as directed by the Court, will issue a marriage license to Plaintiffs Schlairet
_and Russ within the time frame as set forth in the Injunction. However, the Clerk
anticipates that upon the stay's expiration she will receive other applications for
marriage licenses from same-sex couples. -

Pursuant to section 741.05, Florida Statutes, it is a misdemeanor of the first
degree, punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to $1,000,
for a clerk of court (or county court judge) to issue a marriage license to a same-
sex couple. 0x00A7 741.05, Fla. Stat.; see also 0x00A70x00A7 741.03, 741.04(3), Fla. Stat. While
the Injunction undoubtedly orders the Clerk to issue licenses to Plaintiffs Schlairet
and Russ, thus providing the Clerk with protection from criminal prosecution for
that action, the Clerk is uncertain whether the Injunction requires her to issue
marriage licenses to other same-sex couples. Indeed, the Clerk is aware of
confusion among clerks of court of counties throughout Florida as to whether or
how to implement the Court's order.

Because of the threat of being in contempt of the Injunction on the one hand,

and the jeopardy of being found to have violated her oath to uphold the law and
Case 4:14-cv-00107-RH-CAS Document 99 Filed 12/23/14 Page 4 of 6

facing criminal prosecution on the other,' the Clerk respectfully requests the Court
provide immediate clarification as to the scope of the Injunction and whether it
extends to other non-party same-sex couples who apply to the Clerk for a marriage
license.
CONCLUSION

Because of the time-sensitive nature of these issues associated with the
impending expiration of the stay of the Injunction, and the jeopardy for criminal
penalties for actions taken outside the scope of the Injunction, the Clerk
respectfully requests expedited clarification as to whether the Injunction requires
the Clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples who are not parties to this

proceeding.

RULE 7.1(B) CONFERENCE
Counsel for the Clerk conferred with counsel for Plaintiffs and is authorized
to report that Plaintiffs consent to the filing of the motion but object to any relief

afforded as a result of this motion that would limit the scope of the Injunction.

 

1 Notably, no state attorney is a party to this case and thus, the injunction would presumably not prevent a state
attorney from enforcing the criminal penalties under Florida law.
