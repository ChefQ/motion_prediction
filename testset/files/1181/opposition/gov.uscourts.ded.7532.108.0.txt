SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

iGames Entertainment, Inc. has filed a motion to preclude, in part, the testimony
of Thomas John Shopa, CPA, CFP, an expert witness for Chex Services, Inc. and
Equitex, Inc. In its motion papers iGames fails to address binding Third Circuit law that
is directly contrary to its position. Once viewed in light of the applicable law, iGames
itself has defeated its own argument to exclude Mr. Shopa's testimony.

The specialized knowledge of Mr. Shopa, who is familiar with the accounting
aspects of interest payment obligations and profit sharing obligations will assist the trier
of fact to understand the evidence and to determine the precise factual issue which
iGames contends is at the heart of this case.

Further, iGames' arguments go to the weight of Mr. Shopa's testimony and not to
its admissibility. This is a case where cross-examination, contrary evidence, and careful
instruction on the burden of proof are the appropriate means for iGames to attack Mr.
Shopa's opinion. Therefore, Mr. Shopa's testimony is admissible and iGames' motion

should be denied.
Case 1:04-cv-00180-KAJ Document 108 Filed 03/28/2005 Page 5 of 14

STATEMENT OF THE FACTS!

iGames Entertainment, Inc. ("iGames") initiated this action in this Court on
March 24, 2004, alleging, among other things, that Chex Services, Inc. ("Chex") had
breached the terms of a Term Loan Note ("Note") that was executed by iGames in favor
of Chex. The Note is the subject of litigation that was initiated by Chex in Minnesota"
wherein Chex seeks to recover the principal amount plus accrued interest and applicable
late fees associated with a $2 million loan that iGames has refused to repay. The
Minnesota action was transferred to this Court and was consolidated with this action.

In August of 2004, before the actions were consolidated, Chex moved for
summary judgment on its claim that iGames breached the Note. (See C.A. No. 04-CV-
0885 D.L 39.) On October 1, 2004, after the actions were consolidated, iGames filed its
brief in opposition to Chex's motion for summary judgment. (See C.A. No. 04-CV-180
D.I. 49.) In that brief, iGames argued that the Note's provision regarding "Interest" is
ambiguous with respect to how interest was to be calculated and when interest payments
were due. (See Id. at 16.) Specifically, iGames' representations to this Court included the
following: "In this case, the Note does not provide a payment due date and provides an
alternative method of payment that raises significant factual issues concerning the timing
and amount of the payments." (/d. at 16.)

On October 13, 2004, Chex filed its reply brief in support of its motion for

summary judgment. (See C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.I. 51.) In its reply brief, Chex argued

 

' The facts of this case have been presented to this Court in previously filed
motions. Only those facts relevant to the Motion at issue will be addressed herein.

* Chex brought the action in Minnesota because the Note contained a forum-
selection clause dictating that all disputes arising out of the Note would be brought in the
appropriate courts of the State of Minnesota.
Case 1:04-cv-00180-KAJ Document 108 Filed 03/28/2005 Page 6 of 14

that the Note's "Interest" provision clearly required iGames to make certain interest
payments on or before certain dates. (See id. at 5.) On November 12, 2004, during the
hearing on Chex's prior motion, this Court found that there were "material issues of fact
with respect to a subsequent oral modification and material issues of fact with respect to
how interest was to be calculated. [iGames] raised enough of a scent of factual dispute
on those points to convince [the Court] ...." (See C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.L 63 at 27
(Hearing Transcript).)

Although Chex has consistently taken the position that the Note unambiguously
required iGames to make clearly defined interest payments on clearly defined dates, in
the event that this Court would agree with iGames' arguments that the language of the
Note is unclear and ambiguous, Chex sought the expertise of a Certified Public
Accountant and Certified Financial Planner to offer an opinion regarding the financial
obligations of iGames under the Note.

On January 26, 2005, the parties exchanged initial expert reports. Chex and
Equitex, Inc. ("Equitex") submitted an expert report by Thomas John Shopa, CPA, CFP.
(See C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.I. 104 Ex. F (Dmec Aff? Ex. F).) As Mr. Shopa states, he
was asked, among other things, to "consider the financial and other obligations of iGames
in conjunction with a Term Loan Note resulting from a $2 million loan from Chex
Services to iGames in January 2004." (See id. Ex. F at 1.)

Based on Mr. Shopa's experience and expertise in the financial and accounting

industries, Mr. Shopa determined that the terms of the Note required iGames to make

 

* References to the "Drnec Aff." refer to the Affidavit of James E. Drnec, Esquire
in Support of Chex Services, Inc.'s and Equitex, Inc.'s Motion to Exclude Expert
Testimony previously submitted in this matter. (C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.1.102.)
Case 1:04-cv-00180-KAJ Document 108 Filed 03/28/2005 Page 7 of 14

interest payments on specific dates as well as profit sharing payments due when the
information regarding those profit sharing obligations became available. (See id. Ex. F at
5.) In doing so, Mr. Shopa specifically analyzed the following language of the Note's
"Interest" provision:

For the period ending February 1, 2004, the borrower shall
pay to the Lender interest on the outstanding Term Loans at
the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum, calculated on
the basis of a 360-day year and counting the actual number
of days elapsed.

* Ok

In addition, in lieu of interest, the Borrower shall, on a
monthly basis, pay to the Lender an amount equal to 50%
of the Operating Income of the Borrower's Available
Money, Inc. subsidiary ("Available Money") (which for the
period ending February 1, 2004 shall be reduced by the
amount of interest paid under the previous sentence)... .

(See id. Ex. F at 5.) This language of the Note is the very same language that iGames
argued is ambiguous while opposing Chex's prior summary judgment motion. (See C.A.
No. 04-CV-180 D.I. 62 at 15-16 (iGames' prior Brief in Opposition to Summary
Judgment).)

Based on Mr. Shopa's financial expertise, he immediately recognized the financial
obligations that the Note created. He stated:

This arrangement is similar in nature to a lease, which calls
for a fixed monthly rent payment and the payment of
additional "percentage rent" typically based upon sales
revenue. In such instances, the monthly rent is payable on
the first day of the month with payment of the additional
"percentage rent" due as soon as the information to
calculate the percentage rent becomes available.
Case 1:04-cv-00180-KAJ Document 108 Filed 03/28/2005 Page 8 of 14

(C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.I. 104 (Drmec Aff. Ex. F at 5).) Thus, after Mr. Shopa analyzed
several other aspects related to the financial obligations of iGames under the Note, Mr.
Shopa stated:

Our analysis indicates that iGames was obligated to pay
$20,833 and $24,167 of accrued interest to Chex Services
as of February 1, 2004 and March 1, 2004. The 10-day
grace period for these payments would be February 11 and
March 11, 2004, but no payments were received.
Consequently, overdue accrued interest totaled $45,000 as
of March 11, 2004.

(/d. Ex. F. at 7.) Because these financial obligations exist, Mr. Shopa provided further
analysis regarding these financial obligations of iGames. Mr. Shopa stated:

The Term Loan Note indicates that the failure of iGames to
"pay any installment of principal or interest of fee payable
hereunder or any obligation within 10 days following the
date when due" constitutes an "Event of Default".

We have been informed by counsel that iGames did not
make any payment on the Term Loan Note since inception.
This is clearly an "Event of Default" as defined by the
agreement.

OK

I also conclude that iGames was not in compliance with the
provisions of the Term Loan Note, which constituted an
Event of Default as of March 12, 2004 when the Stock
Purchase Agreement was terminated by Equitex and Chex
Services. iGames owed Chex Services $45,000 of interest
payment per the Term Loan Note as of March 11, 2004
(including a 10 day grace period).

(Ud. Ex. F. at 7, 23.)
iGames filed a motion and brief' to preclude, in part, the testimony of Mr. Shopa.

(See C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.I. 99-100 (iGames' Br.).) iGames is attempting to preclude a

 

* iGames' brief contains numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations, many of
which have nothing to do with the issue of admissibility of Mr. Shopa's testimony.
Case 1:04-cv-00180-KAJ Document 108 Filed 03/28/2005 Page 9 of 14

very small portion of Mr. Shopa's testimony, by merely "barring him from testifying that
iGames on March 12, 2004 was in default of its obligations under the Note." (Id. D.I.
100 at 9.)

On one hand, iGames argues it was not in default of its obligations under the Note
because the plain language of the Note did not obligate iGames to make any interest
payments before March 12, 2004. (id. at 4.) On the other hand, iGames argues that it
was not in default because the due dates for the interest payments were postponed by an
alleged oral agreement. (/d.) Interestingly, iGames never explains why the parties
purportedly entered into the alleged oral agreement to postpone the due dates for interest
payments if the plain language of the Note did not obligate iGames to make any interest
payments in the first place. Indeed, iGames positions are contradictory. There would be
no need to enter an "oral agreement that postponed payments" if no payments were due.
iGames' curious and contradictory positions suggest that iGames understood that the Note
required payments of interest before March 12, 2004, and that iGames merely invented
the imaginary oral agreement? in an attempt to withstand Chex's prior summary judgment
motion.

Importantly, iGames states that "[c]entral to this dispute is the issue of whether,
when, and how iGames was obligated to make interest payments under the Note." (Jd. at
3.) Thus, Mr. Shopa's testimony directly addresses those factual issues that iGames

considers the central issues in this case.

 

iGames' misrepresentations have been sufficiently addressed in Chex and Equitex's prior
submissions to this Court and need not be addressed again in relation to this motion.

> It should be noted that the alleged oral agreement is sharply disputed. Chex has
consistently argued that there was no oral agreement to postpone interest payments due
under the Note.

ARGUMENT
I. STANDARD FOR ADMISSIBILITY OF EXPERT TESTIMONY
"Motions to exclude evidence are committed to the court's discretion." Chemipal,
Ltd. v. Slim-Fast Nutritional Foods Int'l, Inc., 350 F. Supp. 2d 582, 587 (D. Del. 2004).
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides as follows:

If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will
assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may
testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1)
the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the
testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,
and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods
reliably to the facts of the case.

Fed. R. Evid. 702. Under applicable Third Circuit precedent,0x00B0 when a contract term is not
defined in the parties' contract and the parties dispute the intended meaning of the term,
an expert witness may properly testify as to the expert's interpretation of the contract
language. See Buford v. Wilmington Trust Co., 841 F.2d 51, 55 (3d Cir. 1988).

Il. MR. SHOPA'S TESTIMONY IS ADMISSIBLE

In this case, iGames itself argues that "the Note on its face does not contain a due
date for any payments" and that the parties "dispute the nature of iGames' obligations
under the Note's `Interest' provision... ." (See C.A. No. 04-CV-180 D.I. 100 at 4
(1Games' Br.).) Thus, applying the applicable law to the scenario that iGames itself sets

forth demonstrates that an expert witness may properly testify as to the expert's

 

0x00B0 In its opening brief, iGames never cites any authority from the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals or from the District of Delaware. Apparently when conducting research
for its motion, iGames somehow overlooked the binding precedent that is directly
contrary to iGames' argument, namely the Third Circuit's decision in Buford v.
Wilmington Trust Co., 841 F.2d 51, 55 (3d Cir. 1988).
