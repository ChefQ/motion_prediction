v.
URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC. d/b/a

_________________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
STAY ALL PROCEEDINGS PENDING TRANSFER DECISION BY THE
JUDICIAL PANEL ON MUTIDISTRICT LITIGATION [D.E. 10]
Plaintiff, Crystal Ramirez, by and through the undersigned counsel and pursuant to
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rules for the Middle District of Florida,
requests the entry of an Order denying Defendant’s Motion to Stay All Proceedings
Pending Transfer Decision by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation [D.E. 10], and
states:
I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff brings this collective action for overtime wages pursuant to the Fair Labor
Standards Act ("FLSA"), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. D.E. 7. This action is brought on behalf

1

of Assistant Department Managers (“ADMs”) employed by Anthropologie across the
United States. Id.
In February 2012, Anthropologie reclassified ADMs as non-exempt. Id. Until the
February 2012 reclassification of ADMs as non-exempt, Anthropologie misclassified
Plaintiff and the other similarly situated ADMs as exempt. Id. This lawsuit seeks to
recover for the ADMs nationwide the overtime wages they are owed between July 2010
(the date three years preceding the filing of this lawsuit) and February 2012 (the date the
ADM position was reclassified). Id.
Importantly, this instant case does not seek relief on behalf of any position other
than the ADMs. D.E. 7. Nor does the instant case seek relief for anyone outside of the
period between July 2010 and February 2012. D.E. 7. In addition, the instant case only
asserts that the ADMs were misclassified prior to February 2012 – it does not assert any
off-the-clock claims or other claims. D.E. 7. Finally, the instant case is brought pursuant
to the FLSA only, and no state or other law.
Notwithstanding the limited scope of this case, Anthropologie has requested that
the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) transfer and consolidate this case
with four other actions involving different positions, different claims, different stores and
different laws. D.E. 10-1. However, this case is not proper for multidistrict litigation
(“MDL”), as it involves a discreet claim for the misclassification for a specific position -ADMs employed at Anthropologie -- for a limited period of time.

2

Significantly, August 20, 2013, the Honorable Magistrate Judge James Orenstein
denied Defendant’s request for a stay in McEarchen v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., Civil
Action No. 13-cv-03569 (E.D.N.Y.). The instant case and McEarchen, along with three
other cases, are the subject of the Motion to Transfer pending before the J.P.M.L. Thus,
Judge Orenstein’s Order1 should be persuasive to this Honorable Court, as it is on allfours.
For all these reasons, Anthropologie’s Motion to Stay must be denied.
II. LEGAL STANDARDS FOR A STAY PENDING THE JPML’S DECISION
ON ANTHROPOLOGIE’S MOTION FOR MDL TRANSFER
While a district court has the discretionary authority to stay litigation pending the
outcome of a related proceeding in another forum, Jozwiak v. Stryker Corp., 2010 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 8103, *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 11, 2010) (citing, CTI-Container Leasing Corp.
v. Uiterwyk Corp., 685 F. 2d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir. 1982)), under Rule 2.1(d) of the
JPML’s Rules of Procedure, a motion to the JPML requesting transfer and consolidation
does not affect pretrial proceedings before the district court:
The pendency of a motion, order to show cause, conditional transfer order
or conditional remand order before the Panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407
does not affect or suspend orders and pretrial proceedings in any pending
federal district court action and does not limit the pretrial jurisdiction of
that court. An order to transfer or remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407
shall be effective only upon its filing with the clerk of the transferee district
court.

JPML R. 2.1(d).

“In other words, a district judge should not automatically stay

discovery, postpone rulings on pending motions, or generally suspend further rulings
upon a parties’ motion to the MDL Panel for transfer and consolidation.” Jozwiak, 2010
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8103, *5 (citations omitted).
The party moving “for a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in
being required to go forward[;] if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he
prays will work damage to some one else,” the request for stay should be denied. Landis
v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936) (emphasis added); see also,
Jowziak, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8103 (denying motion to stay pending determination of
MDL transfer motion); Guerrero v. Target Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81005, *3
(S.D. Fla. June 7, 2012) (same); Wheeler v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 2012 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 61727 (S.D. Ga. April 18, 2012) (same).
When considering a motion to stay a case pending a motion to the JPML to
transfer and consolidate, the district court should consider three factors: (1) potential
prejudice to the non-moving party; (2) hardship and inequity to the moving party if the
action is not stayed; and (3) the judicial resources that would be saved by avoiding
duplicative litigation if the cases are in fact consolidated. Jowziak, 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 8103, at *5 (citations omitted). As applied to the instant case, each of these
factors weighs against a stay.

III. ANTHROPOLOGIE HAS NOT
ENTITLEMENT TO A STAY

AND

CANNOT

DEMONSTRATE

A. Plaintiff Will Be Substantially Prejudiced By A Stay
Regarding the first factor, a stay will substantially prejudice the rights of the FLSA
putative collective action members in this case because their FLSA statute of limitations
continues to run until and unless they file consents to join with the Court. Parilla v.
Allcom Construction Services LLC, 688 F.Supp2d 1347, 1349, n. 5 (M.D. Fla. 2010).
Inasmuch as a MDL proceeding will take several months before issuance of a decision,
much less completion of the transfer and consolidation of cases, a stay would simply
cause the running of the statutes of limitations of the putative collective actions.
Indeed, this is the precise reasoning relied upon by Judge Orenstein in his decision
to deny the same request for stay in McEarchen, pending in the Eastern District of New
York:
ORDER denying [12] Motion to Stay -- The motion for a stay is denied.
Unlike the cases upon which defendant relies, a stay in the instant case
would delay consideration of whether and how to notify similarly situated
non-party employees, if any, of their potential right to opt in to this putative
collective action. Such delay would prejudice any such potential opt-in
plaintiffs by limiting the available remedy should they establish liability.
The denial of a stay is without prejudice to the defendant's right to renew
the motion in the event the parties to this case stipulate either to the
dissemination of a notice to potential opt-in plaintiffs or to the tolling of the
statute of limitations with respect to such persons. Ordered by Magistrate
Judge James Orenstein on 8/20/2013. (Orenstein, James)2

2 Judge Orenstein’s Order denying the Motion to Stay is a Docket Text Entry only, with no
attached document or docket number.

5

In the instant case, the delay and resulting prejudice described by Judge Orenstein
especially would erode or extinguish the claims of the putative members of the collective
class, which are limited to a specific period – August 2010 to February 2012. Indeed,
Anthropologie’s request to the JPML, along with this Motion to Stay, likely are
motivated, at least in part, by the advantages of delay in this particular case.

See

generally, In re Bank of America Wage & Hour Employment Litigation, 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 11913 (D. Kan. Oct. 10, 2012) (recognizing running of statute of limitations in
FLSA cases as having effect on stays pending a decision by JPML). Because this
particular case is more narrow in temporal scope -- based upon the February 2012
reclassification -- it is more susceptible to the erosion of the statute of limitations.
Notably, none of the cases cited by Anthropologie involved FLSA collective
actions where the statute of limitations was continuing to erode. D.E. 10 at 7. Further,
Anthropologie’s contention that a stay would benefit “all parties” [D.E. 10 at 7],
completely disregards the fact that the delay caused by a stay prejudices the putative
members of the collective class by eroding (and in some cases extinguishing) their statute
of limitations. Alternatively, if the Court decides to grant a stay, then it also should toll
the statute of limitations to protect the claims of the putative members of the collective
class. In re Bank of America Wage & Hour Employment Litigation, 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 11913 (D. Kan. Oct. 10, 2012).
In addition, the mere “speculation as to the resolution of the MDL Motion does
not support staying this case.” Jowziak , 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8103, at *8. Thus,
6

Anthropologie’s expressed confidence about the JPML’s decision on its transfer request
[D.E. 7 at 3] – however misplaced – is completely irrelevant. Wright Transportation v.
Pilot Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116806, *5 (S.D. Ala. Aug. 19, 2013) (“the mere
possibility that this action might be subject to consolidation by the JPML is insufficient
grounds to stay the action at this time.”) (citations omitted).
B. There Will Be No Hardship Or Inequity To Anthropologie If The Case
Is Not Stayed
Regarding the second factor, contrary to Anthropologie’s contentions, the instant
case is not similar to and does not overlap with the four cases pending in California and
New York. While Anthropologie makes the sweeping pronouncement that the “core
allegations” of all five cases involve the denial of overtime payments [D.E. 10 at 3], the
actual allegations in these five cases demonstrate that they are separate and distinct in
terms of the positions, the parties, the claims, and the law involved:
• First, two of the cases are not misclassification cases, but rather off-theclock cases brought on behalf of hourly employees, not ADMs. Moore v.
Urban Outfitters Wholesale, Inc., d/b/a Anthropologie and Does 1 through
10, No. 13-cv-2245 (N.D. Cal.); Berry v. Urban Outfitters Wholesale, Inc.,
Susie Sieler and Does 1 through 100, No. 13-cv-2628 (N.D. Cal.).
• Second, unlike the instant case, these off-the-clock cases are brought under
California law, not the FLSA.

7

• Third, one of these off-the-clock cases (Berry) asserts claims against a
different store, Urban Outfitters, not Anthropologie.
• Fourth,

the

other

misclassification

case

is

not

brought

against

Anthropologie but Urban Outfitters and involves claims on behalf of a
different position -- Department Manager (not ADMs). McEarchen, et al.,
v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., No. 13-cv-3569 (FB)(JO) (S.D.N.Y.).
• Fifth, a California-only department manager case is brought under
California law, not the FLSA, and also is brought against a different store,
Urban Outfitters. Abdulhaqq, et al. v. Urban Outfitters and Does 1 through
100, No. 13-cv-3184 (N.D. Cal.).
Thus, the instant case involves (1) a different position than the other cases, in that
none of those cases are on behalf of ADMs; (2) a different store than some of the other
cases, in that the claims here are against Anthropologie, not Urban Outfitters; (3)
different claims than some of the other cases, in that this is a misclassification case, not
an off-the-clock case; and (3) different law than some of the other cases, in that this case
is based solely on the FLSA and not California law. Based upon these stark differences,
there is no threat of duplicative work or an inconsistent verdict. Guerrero v. Target
Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81005, at *3; see also, Wheeler v. Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61727 (S.D. Ga. April 18, 2012).
Indeed, even if the cases were consolidated (which Plaintiff vigorously opposes),
based upon the difference in the positions, stores, claims and law, the cases necessarily
8

would have to proceed on independent discovery tracks. Therefore, denying a stay and
allowing the instant case to proceed while the JPML is considering Anthropologie’s
request, would not result in hardship or inequity to Anthropologie because whatever
discovery is conducted here can be used in any MDL. Jowziak, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
8103, at *10. Relatedly, where, as here, a case is in its initial stages, there is little
prejudice to Anthropologie if the action is not stayed. Id.
C. Not Staying The Case Will Not Cause Duplicative Effort
Regarding the third factor, because the five cases involve different positions,
different stores, different claims and different law, allowing discovery to proceed in this
case will not result in duplication of effort.

See, Part III.C,

supra.

Under these

circumstances, the conservation of judicial resources does not support a stay. Id. at *11.
IV. CONCLUSION
For all these reasons, Plaintiff, Crystal Ramirez, requests the entry of an Order
denying Defendant’s Motion to Stay All Proceedings Pending Transfer Decision by the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation [D.E. 10]. This case should be permitted to
proceed, because as a practical matter the case will require unique discovery tailored to
the particular position, claims, and stores. In addition, the delay caused by the stay would
severely prejudice the putative members of the collective class whose statute of
limitations continues to run, thereby rendering a stay antithetical to the remedial goals of
the FLSA. See generally, Flecha v. Neighbors Moving Services, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
67244 (S.D. Fla. March 6, 2013) (denying stay of discovery pending outcome of motion
9

regarding arbitration because the delay caused by the stay would be contrary to the
remedial purposes of the FLSA).
