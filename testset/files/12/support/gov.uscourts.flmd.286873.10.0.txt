actions involve allegations about unpaid overtime pay and related penalties resulting from
Urban Outfitters’ alleged violations of wage and hour laws. See Motion and Brief to the
JPML attached as Exhibit “A” to the accompanying Declaration of William R. Horwitz.1

While the application to the JPML is pending, this Court should stay all proceedings
in this action to conserve the Court’s and parties’ resources, avoid duplicative litigation, and
prevent inconsistent rulings.
BACKGROUND
Within the past four months, a total of five separate but overlapping wage and hour
class and collective action lawsuits have been filed against Urban Outfitters. On August 9,
2013, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, Urban Outfitters moved for an order centralizing in the
Northern District of California, for pretrial coordination, all related pending and yet-to-be
filed federal court wage and hour lawsuits. Specifically, Urban Outfitters is aware of, and
has sought consolidation of, the following related federal class and collective action lawsuits
arising from alleged wage and hour violations:
a.

Alexander Moore, et al. v. Urban Outfitters Wholesale, Inc., d/b/a
Anthropologie, et al., Case No. 13-cv-02245 (N.D. Cal.)

b.

David Berry, et al. v. Urban Outfitters Wholesale, Inc., et al., Case No.
13-cv-02628 (N.D. Cal.)

c.

Shakora Abdulhaqq, et al. v. Urban Outfitters, et al., Case No. 13-cv03184 (N.D. Cal.)

d.

Jeffrey McEarchen, et al. v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., Civil Action No.
13-cv-03569 (E.D.N.Y.)

e.

Crystal Ramirez v. Urban Outfitters, Inc. d/b/a Anthropologie, Civil
Action No. 13-cv-01074 (M.D. Fla.)

In the above actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others, are suing
Urban Outfitters and a corporate affiliate (and, in one case, an individual defendant). In all
of the cases, plaintiffs raise similar factual allegations and seek similar relief.

On July 17, 2013, plaintiffs Crystal Ramirez and Matthew McDermott filed a
Complaint against Urban Outfitters in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Florida. On July 26, plaintiff Ramirez filed an Amended Complaint that did not include
McDermott as a plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s claims against Urban Outfitters in this case turn on questions similar to
those raised by the other class and collective action lawsuits that are the subject of the
pending Section 1407 application to the JPML. The core allegation in all these cases is that
Urban Outfitters supposedly denied employees overtime payments. More specifically, all of
the plaintiffs allege that Urban Outfitters employed classes of individuals within the past four
years or less in retail clothing stores in California or throughout the country and, pursuant to
uniform policies and practices, denied these individuals overtime pay.
Plaintiff Ramirez has also asserted virtually identical claims under the Fair Labor
Standards Act for: (1) unpaid overtime; and (2) inadequate wage and hour records. Plaintiff
Ramirez further alleges that Urban Outfitters’ “unlawful conduct was and is pursuant to its
centralized, company-wide policy, pattern, and/or practice of attempting to minimize labor
costs by violating the FLSA.” (Am. Compl. ¶31).
Because this case raises common questions of alleged fact and because transfer will
promote judicial economy and the convenience of the parties and witnesses, Urban Outfitters
anticipates that the JPML will issue a Transfer Order, transferring and centralizing this case,
as well as all related filed or yet-to-be-filed wage and hour class actions against Urban
Outfitters (and corporate affiliates), for pretrial coordination. Accordingly, Urban Outfitters

respectfully requests that this Court stay all proceedings in this matter pending the Panel’s
decision.
ARGUMENT
This Court has the inherent power to stay proceedings “pending the outcome of a
related proceeding in another forum.” Jozwiak v. Stryker Corp., No. 09-1985, 2010 WL
147143, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 11, 2010) (citing CTI-Container Leasing Corp. v. Uiterwyk
Corp., 685 F.2d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir. 1982)). This power to stay is “incidental to the power
inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of
time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. North Am. Co., 299 U.S.
248, 254 (1936).
In exercising its discretion, a court must “weigh competing interests and maintain an
even balance.” Landis, 299 U.S. at 254–55. When determining whether a stay is warranted
pending transfer by the JPML, courts consider three factors: (1) potential prejudice to the
non-moving party; (2) hardship and inequity to the moving party if the action is not stayed;
and (3) the judicial resources that would be saved by avoiding duplicative litigation if the
cases are in fact consolidated. Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (C.D. Cal.
1997) (citing Am. Seafood v. Magnolia Processing, Inc., Nos. 92-1030, 92-1086, 1992 WL
102762, at *1-2 (E.D. Pa. 1992)). In this case, all three factors favor a stay.
A. A Stay will Further Judicial Economy
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the JPML may transfer and centralize actions involving
one or more common questions of fact when doing so “will be for the convenience of parties
and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.” (Emphasis

added). Absent a stay, this Court may be called upon to render decisions on both procedural
and substantive issues that may be inconsistent with decisions reached in the related cases or,
if the JPML grants the pending motion, by the transferee court in this matter. A stay of these
proceedings will conserve judicial resources and ensure uniform decisions across all related
filed and yet-to-be filed wage and hour class actions against Urban Outfitters. See In re
Plumbing Fixture Cases, 298 F. Supp. 484, 491-92 (J.P.M.L. 1968) (“The purpose of Section
1407 … is to eliminate the potential for conflicting contemporaneous pretrial rulings by
coordinate district and appellate courts in multidistrict related civil actions.”). The purpose
of Section 1407 would therefore not be served if, notwithstanding a motion for MDL
coordination of these cases, this Court allowed this matter to proceed.
Staying these proceedings will serve judicial economy because of the increased
efficiency and coordinated pretrial case management available in MDL proceedings. A
district court should not waste time “familiarizing itself with the intricacies of an action that
will be coordinated for pretrial management before a transferee judge.” Rivers, 980 F. Supp.
at 1360; U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Royal Indem. Co., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17837, at *6 (N.D.
Tex. Sept. 23, 2002) (granting motion to stay because “if the MDL Motion is granted, all of
the Court’s time, energy, and acquired knowledge regarding this action and its pretrial
procedures will be wasted.”).

Courts commonly stay actions when the litigants have

petitioned the JPML for coordinated treatment because it “can increase efficiency and
consistency, particularly when the transferor court believes that a transfer order is likely and
when the pending motions raise issues likely to be raised in other cases as well.” Bonenfant

v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-60301-CIV, 2007 WL 2409980, at *1 (S.D. Fla. July
31, 2007) (citing Manual for Complex Litigation § 22.35 (4th ed. 2004)).
Here, Plaintiff’s claims share common alleged questions of fact and law with the
wage and hour actions against Urban Outfitters awaiting possible centralization by the JPML.
Pretrial proceedings in these cases, including discovery and class certification proceedings,
will focus on the common factual and legal allegations pled in each of the five actions and
will necessarily overlap. A stay of these proceedings pending transfer of the actions against
Urban Outfitters will ensure that the Court’s and parties’ efforts are not unnecessarily
duplicative.
B. The Potential Prejudice to Urban Outfitters from Denial of a Stay Far
Surpasses the Potential Prejudice to Plaintiffs from the Grant of a Stay
Absent a stay, Urban Outfitters would endure substantial hardship from duplicative
discovery requests and potentially inconsistent rulings. If the Court does not stay these
proceedings, Urban Outfitters will also be exposed to the risk of unnecessary proceedings
and substantial and unnecessary expenditures of its resources.
Specifically, Urban Outfitters is subject to discovery in five nearly identical class
actions and discovery is therefore almost certain to overlap. For example, the plaintiffs in all
five actions allege that Urban Outfitters denied employees overtime payments. As a result,
the plaintiffs in all five actions will likely propound interrogatories and request similar
documents relating to Urban Outfitters’ company policies and procedures for payment of
overtime.

Urban Outfitters could also be required to produce the same witnesses for

depositions in multiple different cases. Responding to discovery and conducting motion
practice in all five nearly identical actions would be burdensome and substantially prejudicial

to Urban Outfitters.

See Am. Seafood, 1992 WL 102762, at *2 (holding that “[t]he

duplicative motion practice and discovery proceedings demonstrate that judicial economy
and prejudice to the defendants weigh heavily in favor of [a] stay.”) (citations omitted).
On the other hand, the risk of prejudice to plaintiff is minimal. The only potential
impact that a stay may have on plaintiff is the possibility that, after this case is delayed
briefly pending the JPML’s decision, the JPML denies the application. Flores v. McKesson
Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109130, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2013). This possibility
cannot seriously be characterized as prejudice that might justify pushing this litigation ahead
pending the JPML’s decision. See Arthur-Magna, Inc. v. Del-Val Fin. Corp., No. 90-4378,
1991 WL 13725, at *1 (D.N.J. Feb. 4, 1991) (“[E]ven if a temporary stay can be
characterized as a delay prejudicial to plaintiffs, there are considerations of judicial economy
and hardship to defendants that are compelling enough to warrant such a delay.”). At this
point in the litigation, plaintiffs have expended limited resources, discovery has not begun,
and plaintiffs cannot establish any additional prejudice resulting from a stay. See Milrot v.
Apple Inc., No. 10-61130, 2010 WL 3419699, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 27, 2010) (granting
motion to stay pending a decision by the JPML on transfer of the case when the “instant
action is not procedurally advanced.”)
On balance, therefore, all parties and the Court benefit from a brief stay.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendant Urban Outfitters respectfully requests that the
Court enter an order granting this motion to stay pending the JPML’s decision on the motion
for Section 1407 transfer and centralization.
