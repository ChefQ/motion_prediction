Civil Action No. 2007-CV-279

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY ON PROTECTIVE ORDER
The recent opinion by Judge Folsom shows exactly why the depositions of Wojcicki,
Brin, and Page are justified here:
·

In that case, the dispute revolved around one unsolicited email Mr. Brin received.
Order at 2. Here, Google has admitted that these executives are actively involved
in the products. Indeed, Ms. Wojcicki is the lowest-level employee who has
supervision over the accused products, and has been designated as Google’s
corporate witness on this product before. She has also claimed to come up with
the idea for the accused product. Messrs. Page and Brin also are actively involved
and make key decisions. Indeed, Mr. Brin has claimed credit with inventing this
“billion dollar opportunity.” Here, at least for Mr. Brin and Ms. Wojcicki, they
have claimed credit for inventing the accused product. It is difficult to think of
something more relevant. Nobody else but themselves can testify to this.

·

In that case, Mr. Brin submitted a sworn declaration. Order at 3. Here, of course,
plaintiffs have nothing from any of these witnesses except for Ms. Wojcicki’s

Indeed, Google’s

corporate representatives could not answer questions about these executives’
roles.
·

In that case, the Court explicitly stated that the plaintiff should “be permitted to
depose a 30(b)(6) representative of Defendant regarding Mr. Geller’s 2001 email
and regarding what procedures, if any, Defendant had at the time for handling emails of this sort. After that discovery is completed, Plaintiff can, if appropriate,
re-notice a deposition of Mr. Brin.” Order at 6. Here, of course, Function Media
has tried and failed to obtain the information by other means.

In short, even a cursory read of the Order makes clear how different this case is from that
one – where the entire dispute centered around an unsolicited email Plaintiffs sent and where Mr.
Brin actually submitted a declaration. The case at bar is thus more similar to the Northern
District of California case discussed in the briefing, Google v. American Blind & Wallpaper
Factory, Inc., 2006 WL 2578277 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 6, 2006), where Google’s home district
permitted the deposition because of Mr. Page’s unique knowledge and that the “policy change”
was the result of Mr. Page’s concern. The same is true here, even more so for Wojcicki and Brin
since they both claim credit for the accused system and Ms. Wojcicki is the lowest-level
employee with supervision over it.
