SHAWN SMITH,
Plaintiff,
Vv.
WAVERLY PARTNERS, LLC's
WAVERLY PARTNERS, LLC, and MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE
ALLIEDBARTON SECURITY 50(b) AND RULE 59
SERVICES, LLC d/b/a HRPLUS,
Defendants.

 

NOW COMES Defendant Waverly Partners, LLC, by and through counsel, and
moves the Court pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for
judgment as a matter of law. In the alternative, Defendant moves the Court for a new trial
pursuant to Rule 59. Accordingly, Defendant shows unto the Court as follows:

1. At the close of evidence in the trial of this matter, Defendant moved the

Court, pursuant to Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for
judgment as a matter of law on the issues of contract formation and breach;

and agency of co-Defendant AlliedBarton, which Motion the Court denied.

However, at the filing of this Motion, the Court has not yet entered a final
judgment in this matter.
3, Defendant renews its Rule 50(a) Motion, pursuant to Rule 50(b), and

respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment for Defendant as a
matter of law on the grounds, set forth in greater detail in the accompanying
Memorandum, that there was no evidence at trial to support (1) the
existence of a contract between Plaintiff and Defendant in which Defendant
agreed to obtain a background check limited solely to Plaintiffs "past
employment"; (2) that Defendant breached any such contract; and (3) the
Jury's consequent finding that Defendant was liable for Plaintiffs damages.
Defendant further respectfully requests that the Court conditionally grant a
new trial on all issues should this judgment for Defendant be overturned
upon appeal.

In the alternative, Defendant prays for a new trial on the grounds that the
jury's verdict was against the clear weight of evidence and would constitute
a miscarriage of justice, pursuant to Rule 59.

Defendant separately prays for a new trial, pursuant to Rule 59, on the
following additional grounds, also set forth in greater detail in the

accompanying Memorandum:

a. failure of the jury to follow the Court's instructions;

B. undue prejudice arising from Plaintiffs emotive and extraneous
testimony;

C. confusion arising from the immaterial issue of agency of
AlliedBarton;

Page 2
d. unforeseeability of Plaintiff's damages; or
e. any reason not stated in this Motion that would justify a new trial of
this matter.

WHEREFORE, Defendant prays the Court for an Order granting entry of
judgment as a matter of law for Defendant and dismissing, with prejudice, Plaintiff's
breach of contract claim. Alternatively, Defendant prays the Court for an Order granting
a new trial on all issues.

This 18" day of October, 2012.
