DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER
JURISDICTION OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
Defendants State of Vermont, State of Vermont Agency of Administration and Jeb
Spaulding (collectively, the “State”), hereby move pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for
dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, pursuant to Fed.
R. Civ. P. 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings. As explained in detail in the following
incorporated Memorandum of Law, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Second Amended
Complaint (Doc. 13) because Plaintiffs’ claim against the State under the Fair Labor Standards
Act (“FLSA” or the “Act”) is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Background
Plaintiffs represent a class of current and former State employees who are or were
members of the judiciary, supervisory, non-management and corrections bargaining units
represented by the Vermont State Employees Association (“VSEA”). Second Amended
Complaint (“2d Am. Compl.”) ¶ 1. Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to time and one half
overtime pay under the FLSA, but receive only straight-time overtime pay under the collective-

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 2 of 17

bargaining agreements negotiated by the VSEA and the State. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. Specifically, Plaintiffs
presently argue that they are not exempt from the FLSA’s overtime provisions because they are
not paid on a “salary basis.” Id.
Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit in January 2010 in Vermont Superior Court. The State
removed the case to this Court on February 8, 2010. On November 16, 2012, more than two and
a half years after the case was removed, the parties met to discuss a number of remaining
discovery issues implicated by Plaintiffs’ Third Set of Interrogatories and Requests to Produce,
including Interrogatory #17, which requested information related to any potential sovereign
immunity defense. Stipulation of Facts (“Fact Stip.”) ¶ 2 (a copy of the Fact Stip. is attached as
Exhibit A); id. Ex. 1, at 3. At this meeting, the parties discussed the issue of sovereign
immunity, and the State’s counsel indicated that the State felt sovereign immunity had been
waived and thus, the State did not intend to assert the defense. Id. ¶ 2. Plaintiffs summarized
this conversation in a letter dated November 17, 2011. Id. Ex. 1, at 3.
The State responded to Plaintiffs’ Third Set of Interrogatories and Requests to Produce
on March 19, 2012. Id. ¶ 5. In response to Interrogatory 17, asking whether the State intended
to “rely upon the defense of sovereign immunity,” the State responded that it had “removed the
claim to federal court” and “[a]ccordingly,” did “not intend to assert 11th Amendment
immunity,” or that it was “otherwise immune from the FLSA in this action.” Id. Ex. 2 at 7.
Approximately two and a half months later, however, prior to the then-existing deadline for
summary judgment motions, and after a change in assigned counsel, the State amended its
response to Interrogatory 17. The amendment withdrew the State’s previous response and stated
that the State is, in fact, “entitled to sovereign immunity for suits brought under the Fair Labor
Standards Act in either state or federal court and accordingly, intend[s] to assert a sovereign

2

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 3 of 17

immunity defense.” Id. Ex. 3 at 2.
On June 7, 2012, the State moved to amend its Answer to the Second Amended
Complaint to assert an affirmative defense of sovereign immunity. Def.’s Mot. to Amend their
Answer to Pl.’s 2d Am. Compl. (the “Motion to Amend”) (Doc. 104). Plaintiffs opposed this
motion (the “Opposition to Motion to Amend”), arguing in part that the State had waived any
sovereign immunity defense by (1) stating during discovery that it did not intend to raise the
defense; (2) removing the case to federal court; and (3) express statutory language found at 21
V.S.A. § 384(b)(7). Opp. to Mot. to Amend (Doc. 106) at 8-10. The State filed a Reply
addressing these arguments on June 28, 2012. Def.’s Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of its Mot. to
Amend (“Reply in Supp. Mot. Amend”) (Doc. 110).
The Court held a hearing on the Motion to Amend on July 3, 2012. During the hearing,
the Court denied the Motion to Amend as futile on the ground that the sovereign immunity
defense need not be raised in an Answer. Mot. to Amend Hr’g Tr. (“Hr’g Tr.”) at 31 (Doc. 115).
However, the Court allowed Plaintiffs 90 days to conduct additional discovery on the issue of
whether the State had waived sovereign immunity. Id. at 31-32. The Court also afforded the
State an additional 30 days to file a dispositive motion on the sovereign immunity issue. Id. at
32. After the hearing, the Plaintiffs requested, and the State made available, a substantial
additional volume of discovery Plaintiffs believed was necessary to determine whether the State
had waived sovereign immunity through acceptance of federal grants.
A dispute arose, however, as a result of Plaintiffs’ request to discover the State’s legal
research materials. See Pl.’s Mot. to Compel (Doc. 116); Def.’s Opp. to Mot. to Compel (Doc.
117). In light of the dispute, the Court allowed the parties additional time to file dispositive
motions on the sovereign immunity issue. Specifically, at an October 24, 2012 hearing to

3

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 4 of 17

resolve the discovery dispute, the Court directed the parties to file any dispositive motions on the
sovereign immunity issue on or before November 26, 2012. Minute Entry for Proceedings Held
October 24, 2012 (Doc. 121).

Legal Standard
The Supreme Court has observed that a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) “may be raised by a party, or by a court on its own
initiative, at any stage of the litigation.” Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506 (2006); see
also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (“If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.”). Were this not so, however, the present motion
still would be timely as a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) (permitting motion to be made “[a]fter the pleadings are closed”).
Thus, if the Court determines for any reason that a Rule 12(b)(1) motion is not appropriate at this
stage of the litigation, the State requests that its motion be treated as one made under Rule 12(c).
Cf. Baldessarree v. Monroe-Woodbury Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 11-2835-cv, 2012 WL 4039986 (2d
Cir. Sept. 14, 2012) (analyzing parties’ jurisdictional motion as one brought under Rule 12(b)(1),
“and, alternatively, for judgment on the pleadings,” pursuant to Rule 12(c)).
In deciding motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1)
or for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), courts employ the same legal standard used
to analyze motions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Hayden v. Paterson, 594 F.3d 150,
160 (2d Cir. 2010). However, “[w]hen reviewing a complaint for subject matter jurisdiction, a
court is allowed to consider extrinsic evidence and is not limited to the information contained in
the pleadings.” Taite v. Shinseki, No. 5:10-cv-270, 2011 WL 2411436, at *2 (D. Vt. June 14,
2011) (citing Kamen v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 791 F.2d 1006, 1011 (2d Cir. 1986)). Ultimately,
4

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 5 of 17

the burden is on the party invoking federal jurisdiction to establish that jurisdiction. Id.

Argument
In Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), the Supreme Court held that the common law
doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes an action under federal law against a non-consenting
state in state court unless Congress has explicitly abrogated the state’s immunity pursuant to an
appropriate constitutional grant of authority. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 59; Alden, 527
U.S. at 754. The Court reasoned that allowing a suit under federal law against a non-consenting
state in its own courts would undermine “our federalism[, which] requires that Congress treat the
States in a manner consistent with their status as residuary sovereigns and joint participants in
the governance of the Nation.” Alden, 527 U.S. at 748. The Court further explained how a
contrary rule would upset the federal-state balance:
A general federal power to authorize private suits for money
damages would place unwarranted strain on the States’ ability to
govern in accordance with the will of their citizens. Today, as at
the time of the founding, the allocation of scare resources among
competing needs and interests lies at the heart of the political
process. While the judgment creditor of a State may have a
legitimate claim for compensation, other important needs and
worthwhile ends compete for access for the public fisc. Since all
cannot be satisfied in full, it is inevitable that difficult decisions
involving the most sensitive and political of judgments must be
made. If the principle of representative government is to be
preserved to the States, the balance between competing interests
must be reached after deliberation by the political process
established by the citizens of the State, not by judicial decree
mandated by the Federal Government and invoked by the private
citizen.
Id. at 750. Against this principle, the Court looked to the “history, practice, precedent, and the
structure of the Constitution” and concluded that “the States retain immunity from private suit in

5

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 6 of 17

their own courts, an immunity beyond the congressional power to abrogate by Article I
legislation.” Id. at 754.
Thus, the Alden decision makes clear that the FLSA does not abrogate state sovereign
immunity. Alden, 527 U.S. at 754. Accordingly, in order to sustain their FLSA claim against the
State, Plaintiffs must show that the State unambiguously waived its sovereign immunity. See,
e.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Exp. Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675
(1999) (recognizing that sovereign immunity may be waived). It is clear, however, that waiver
may not be implied lightly. See id. at 682 (noting that courts “indulge every reasonable
presumption against waiver” of fundamental constitutional privileges such as sovereign
immunity); Richardson v. New York State Dep’t of Corrs., 180 F.3d 426, 448 (2d Cir. 1999) (test
for determining whether waiver of sovereign immunity has occurred is a “stringent one”).
During the course of this litigation, Plaintiffs have advanced several theories under which they
believe the State has waived sovereign immunity in this case. As explained in detail below,
however, Plaintiffs’ theories are unavailing. The State has not waived its sovereign immunity.
Thus, Plaintiffs’ FLSA claim should be dismissed.

I.

THE STATE DID NOT WAIVE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY THROUGH
STATEMENTS MADE DURING DISCOVERY.
Plaintiffs have argued on several occasions that counsel for the State waived the State’s

sovereign immunity during discovery by suggesting on several occasions – including in a
subsequently-amended written discovery response – that the State believed it already had waived
immunity and therefore did not intend to raise the issue. See Background, supra; see also Opp.
to Mot. to Amend at 8-9. As explained below, however, sovereign immunity cannot be waived
by statements made during discovery, and even were such waiver possible, the statements at

6

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 7 of 17

issue would not evidence any intent on the part of the State to waive immunity.

A.

The State Cannot Waive – And Has Not Waived – Sovereign Immunity Through
Its Statements In Discovery.

Sovereign immunity is a fundamental aspect of state sovereignty protected by the
Constitution. See N. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Chatham City, 547 U.S. 189, 193 (2006) (immunity is a
“fundamental aspect” of state sovereignty); College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 682 (“State
sovereign immunity . . . is constitutionally protected.”). Moreover, the Supreme Court has held
that a sovereign immunity “waiver may not be implied,” Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651,
1658 (2011), and will only be found in an express statutory declaration. See Edelman, 415 U.S.
at 673; Sossamon, 131 S. Ct. at 1658 (“[A] State’s consent to suit must be unequivocally
expressed in the text of the relevant statute.”); see also Jacobs v. State Teachers Retirement Sys.
of Vt., 174 Vt. 404, 408, 816 A.2d 517, 521 (2002) (sovereign immunity waiver “must be
accomplished expressly by statute”).1
Thus, sovereign immunity is sufficiently jurisdictional that it “can be raised at any stage
of the proceedings,” and even for the first time on appeal. Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740,
745 n.2 (1998); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 678 (1974); see also McGinty v. New York,
251 F.3d 84, 94 (2d Cir. 2001) (collecting Second Circuit cases); Richardson, 180 F.3d at 449
(noting that while sovereign immunity “differ[s] from other jurisdictional bars, the law remains
clear that it is jurisdictional enough that it need not be raised in the trial court.”).2 Thus, the

1

As explained in further detail below, see Part III, infra, a state may also waive its Eleventh
Amendment immunity by voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court. That principle is not at
issue here, however, because the State is not relying on immunity from federal court jurisdiction under the
Eleventh Amendment.
2

Courts in two federal circuits have suggested that waiver may be possible where a state waits until
trial to raise a sovereign immunity defense in order to circumvent an adverse merits decision. See, e.g.,
Kermode v. Univ. of Miss. Med. Ctr., NO. 12-60010, 2012 WL 5688987, at *5 (5th Cir. Nov. 16, 2012);
Hill v. Blind Industs. & Servs. of Md., 179 F.3d 754, 762 (9th Cir. 1999). Of course, the decisions

7

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 8 of 17

State’s discovery statements could not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity. As a result,
the Court need not reach Plaintiffs’ arguments as to their effect.
Even were waiver through discovery statements possible, however, the statements at
issue would not establish waiver. Nothing about the statements in either Plaintiffs’ November
17, 2011 letter or the State’s March 2012 interrogatory responses suggests that the State
affirmatively agreed to waive its immunity. Those statements show only that at the time they
were made, the State did “not intend to assert” sovereign immunity because of its mistaken belief
that sovereign immunity was not available because of 21 V.S.A. § 384(b)(7), and because the
State had removed the case to federal court.3 See, e.g., Fact Stip. Ex. 1 at 3. In other words, any
fair reading of the statements at issue suggests only that the State was expressing a legal
assessment of its position, not voluntarily relinquishing its rights as a sovereign. See College
Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 682 (“The classic description of an effective waiver of a constitutional
right is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. . . . Courts
indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.”);
Carvajal v. Artus, 633 F.3d 95, 105-06 (2d Cir. 2011) (party’s mistaken legal concession did not

conflict with the Second Circuit’s characterization of sovereign immunity as a jurisdictional issue that can
be raised at any time in the proceedings. See Ruffin v. Deperio, 97 F. Supp. 2d 346, 358 (W.D.N.Y.
2000) (declining to apply Hill, noting that “the Second Circuit has treated sovereign immunity as a limit
on the federal courts’ subject matter jurisdiction” (citing Altantic Healthcare Benefits Trust v. Googins, 2
F.3d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1993)). Even were the Fifth and Ninth Circuit’s decisions applicable, however, neither
of those cases found a waiver where – as here – the State raised sovereign immunity at summary
judgment, rather than during trial. This is significant because prior to summary judgment, the court will
not have issued a final merits decision which could be unfairly circumvented by a state’s raising
sovereign immunity.
As explained in detail in Parts II & III, infra, the State’s initial legal assessment of these factors was
incorrect. The State was not – and is not – barred from asserting sovereign immunity either by section
384(b)(7) or by its removal of the case to federal court.
3

8

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 9 of 17

constitute voluntary waiver).4 Thus, even if assistant attorneys general were capable of waiving
the State’s sovereign immunity through discovery statements (which they are not), the statements
at issue do not constitute such a waiver.

B.

Plaintiffs Have Not Established Any Equitable Basis For Finding A Waiver Of
Sovereign Immunity.

Plaintiffs have similarly failed to provide any authority to support the theory that
equitable principles can be used to defeat a state’s invocation of sovereign immunity, and in light
of the principles discussed above, the Court should find that equitable waiver is not possible.
Even were equitable relief available to Plaintiffs, however, the State’s discovery statements
cannot form the basis of an equitable waiver of sovereign immunity. To establish an equitable
claim, Plaintiffs would have to show that (1) they reasonably relied on the State’s
representations; and (2) they were prejudiced by that reliance. See Kosakow v. New Rochelle
Radiology Assocs., 274 F.3d 706, 725 (2d Cir. 2001); see also Hr’g Tr. at 18 (considering the
possibility of an equitable claim “where [the state] makes a representation of waiving sovereign
immunity and [Plaintiffs] rely on it to [their] prejudice”).
Here, Plaintiffs are not entitled to equitable relief for several reasons. First, it is well
established that a party may not base an equitable claim on the opposing party’s articulation of a
legal position. As explained above, the State’s discovery statements were, at most, an expression
of the State’s legal assessment that sovereign immunity had been waived, and not an affirmative
attempt to prospectively waive sovereign immunity. Plaintiffs cannot rely on the State’s
4

Indeed, parties regularly are permitted to refine and alter their legal positions during discovery in the
absence of prejudice to the opposing party. See Capital Motor Lines v. Detroit Deisel Corp., 799 F.
Supp. 2d 11, 14-16 (D.D.C. 2011) (original discovery response disclaiming affirmative defense did not
waive defense where the response was subsequently amended and amendment did not prejudice opposing
party); Hart v. Farwell, No. 3-05-cv-00139-LRH(VPC), 2007 WL 2049845, at *4 n.4 (D. Nev. July 12,
2009) (same); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e) (requiring party to supplement and amend discovery responses).

9

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 10 of 17

expression of its legal position to support an equitable waiver claim. See, e.g., Kregos v.
Associated Press, 3 F.3d 656, 661 (2d Cir. 1993) (“[R]elying on the legal opinion of another’s
attorney is unreasonable when both parties are aware adverse interests are being pursued.”). 5
Second, Plaintiffs cannot show any prejudice resulting from the State’s actions that
would justify granting equitable relief. There can be no question that sovereign immunity is a
legal issue that can be raised at any time during the course of the proceedings, and certainly for
the first time at summary judgment. See Richardson, 180 F.3d at 449 (sovereign immunity may
be raised for the first time on summary judgment); McGinty, 251 F.3d at 90 (resolving sovereign
immunity waiver issue that had been decided sua sponte by the district court, noting that the
issue was “predominantly of a legal nature”); Steward v. North Carolina, 393 F.3d 484, 487 (4th
Cir. 2002) (question of sovereign immunity waiver is a “legal question” appropriate for decision
on motion to dismiss). Thus, sovereign immunity requires no fact discovery, and the State’s
reassessment of its position on the issue leaves Plaintiffs exactly where they would have been
had sovereign immunity never been discussed.
Third, even if Plaintiffs could demonstrate that the sovereign immunity waiver inquiry
turns on questions of fact, any claim to prejudice remains illusory because Plaintiffs cannot
identify any information they have been forced to proceed without. Prior to the November 2011
discussion, Plaintiffs’ only request for information on the sovereign immunity defense took the
form of a request for information about the factual basis for such a defense. See Fact Stip. Ex. 2,
at 7. As explained above, however, the State has no “factual basis” for the defense aside from
See also Johnson v. Berry, 228 F. Supp. 2d 1071, 1076 (E.D. Mo. 2002) (“The assertion of one in an
adverse position concerning the comparative rights of the two parties cannot support equitable [relief].”);
Coggins v. County of Nassau, 615 F. Supp. 2d 11, 23 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (statements based on party’s legal
interpretation of relevant statute could not serve as basis for equitable estoppel); RCN Telecom Servs. v.
Deluca Enters., 413 F. Supp. 2d 464, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (estoppel did not apply “[b]ecause the alleged
misrepresentation involved a legal opinion”).
5

10

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 11 of 17

the fact that the State is a sovereign entity – a fact Plaintiffs already knew. Id. Ex. 3, at 2.
Moreover, Plaintiffs have since been provided ample time to conduct additional discovery they
believed necessary to rebut the State’s sovereign immunity defense. Thus, the State’s discovery
statements decidedly did not prevent Plaintiffs from gathering any information to which they
would otherwise have been entitled or from presenting any argument they would otherwise have
made on the sovereign immunity issue.
The only conceivable effect the State’s statements had was to cause a brief delay (relative
to the overall length of time the case has been pending) in summary judgment briefing. This
brief delay alone is not sufficient to show prejudice. See Stichting Ter Berhartiging Van de
Belangen v. Schreiber, 407 F.3d 34, 45 (2d Cir. 2005) (delay alone is insufficient to show
prejudice). Therefore, even were equitable relief available to Plaintiffs (and again, it is not), the
State’s discovery statements could not justify an order precluding the State from asserting its
immunity.

II.

THE STATE DID NOT WAIVE ITS SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY BY STATUTE.
Plaintiffs have argued that the State should be barred from raising sovereign immunity in

this case because the State has “expressly consented” to suit under the FLSA. See Opp. to Mot.
to Amend at 9-10. To prevail on this claim, Plaintiff must point to statutory language waiving
sovereign immunity “by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from
the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.” Edelman, 415 U.S. at 673;
see also Sossaman, 131 S. Ct. at 1658 (“[A] waiver of sovereign immunity will be strictly
construed . . . in favor of the sovereign.”); see also Jacobs v. State Teachers Retirement Sys. of
Vt., 174 Vt. 404, 408, 816 A.2d 517, 521 (2002) (sovereign immunity waiver “must be
accomplished expressly by statute”). Plaintiffs assert that such a waiver can be found at 21
11

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 12 of 17

V.S.A. § 384(b)(7), which exempts “State employees who are covered by the U.S. Federal Fair
Labor Standards Act” from State overtime laws. Any fair reading of that statute, however, does
not support the construction Plaintiffs advance.
First, the plain language of section 384(b)(7) is completely silent on the issue of the
State’s consent to suit under the FLSA. This is significant, because the Vermont Legislature
uses clear and unequivocal language when it intends to waive the State’s immunity from suit.
For example, the Vermont Tort Claims Act – which waives the State’s sovereign immunity from
certain tort claims – expressly provides that the State “shall be liable” for some torts committed
by state employees. See 12 V.S.A. § 5601(a). Indeed, the Vermont Supreme Court has
recognized that a sovereign immunity waiver will not occur “unless immunity is expressly
waived by statute.” Sabia v. State, 164 Vt. 293, 298, 669 A.2d 1187, 1191 (1995); see also
Jacobs, 174 Vt. at 408, 816 A.2d at 521. Section 384(b)(7) contains no clear or express language
waiving immunity from suit under the FLSA. Thus, the plain language of section 384(b)(7) does
not expressly waive the State’s sovereign immunity, and under both federal and state law, waiver
cannot be simply implied. See Kane v. Lamothe, 2007 VT 91, ¶ 6, 182 Vt. 241, 244, 936 A.2d
1303, 1306-07 (quoting Sabia, 164 Vt. at 298, 669 A.2d at 1191); Sossaman, 131 S. Ct. at 1658
(“A State’s consent to suit must be ‘unequivocally expressed’ in the text of the relevant statute.”
(emphasis added)).
Second, section 384(b)(7) does not evidence a waiver of sovereign immunity from
private FLSA suit by “overwhelming implication.” Edelman, 415 U.S. at 673. To the contrary,
the most reasonable interpretation of section 384(b)(7) is the one suggested by the statute’s plain
language: the provision simply recognizes that at least some state employees are covered by the

12

Case 2:10-cv-00032-wks Document 122 Filed 11/26/12 Page 13 of 17

FLSA – and, therefore, protected by the federal Department of Labor.6 The statute then uses this
fact to define an exemption from State overtime laws. In other words, section 384(b)(7), like the
other exemptions enumerated in section 384(b), is simply definitional. This eminently
reasonable construction of the statute forecloses any finding that it was intended to be a
sovereign immunity waiver. Nothing about the statute suggests that the Legislature intended to
relinquish the State’s sovereign right to immunity from private suit.
At least one federal appeals court recognized this distinction in rejecting an argument
very similar to Plaintiff’s position. In Williams v. Oklahoma Department of Human Services,
122 Fed. Appx. 958 (10th Cir. 2004), the court held that an Oklahoma law “stating that it was the
policy of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services ‘to comply fully with the provisions of
the Fair Labor Standards Act’” did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity. Id. at 959. In
reaching this conclusion, the court noted that “[t]he issue in this case is not whether Oklahoma
has agreed to comply with the FLSA; the issue is whether Oklahoma has agreed its employees
may sue to enforce their FLSA claims.” Id. Thus, the court concluded that the language at issue
simply “compel[led the state] agency to adopt employment policies in accordance with the
FLSA, not to permit the state to be sued in federal court to enforce the federal act.” Id. at 960.
The same analysis is appropriate here. At most, section 384(b)(7) can be read as a
simple acknowledgment that the FLSA applies to at least some state employees. Nothing in the
statute, however, suggests that the Vermont Legislature intended to subject the state treasury to
6

It is well established that the states have no immunity from suits instituted by the federal
government. See Alden, 527 U.S. at 755 (“In ratifying the Constitution, the States consented to suits
brought by other States or by the Federal Government.”). Moreover, it is clear that the U.S. Department
of Labor has jurisdiction to enforce the FLSA against the States. See, e.g., Gallo v. Essex Cty. Sheriff’s
Dept., No. 10-10260-DPW, 2011 WL 1155385, at *6 n.6 (D. Mass. Mar. 24, 2011) (“While the doctrine
of state sovereign immunity bars private lawsuits against the states for damages under the FLSA, it does
not bar enforcement by the federal Department of Labor.”). Therefore, it makes perfect sense that the
State would recognize its obligation to comply with the FLSA while at the same time preserving its
sovereign immunity from private suits filed under the Act.

private suit under the Act. Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot show that section 384(b)(7) waives the
State’s sovereign immunity “by the most express language or by such overwhelming
implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.”
Edelman, 415 U.S. at 673; see also Sossaman, 131 S. Ct. at 1659 (“[W]here a statute is
susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, we will not
consider a State to have waived its sovereign immunity.”); United States v. Nordic Village, 503
U.S. 30, 37 (1992) (other “plausible” readings of statute foreclosed interpretation as a sovereign
immunity waiver).7

III.

THE STATE DID NOT WAIVE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY BY REMOVING THIS
CASE TO FEDERAL COURT.
In the Second Amended Complaint and in their Opposition to the Motion to Amend,

Plaintiffs argue that the State is precluded from raising sovereign immunity because the State
removed this case to federal court. This argument is based on a misreading of Lapides v. Board
of Regents of University System of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613 (2002), where the Supreme Court held
that a state may not “achieve [an] unfair tactical advantage[]” by asserting Eleventh Amendment
immunity from federal court jurisdiction after removing a state claim from which it had waived
its immunity in state court. Id. at 621; see also id. at 622 (“[T]he rule governing voluntary
invocations of federal jurisdiction has rested upon the problems of inconsistency and unfairness
that a contrary rule of law would create”). Notably, the Lapides court explicitly limited its
holding to situations where a state’s sovereign immunity has been abrogated or waived in its own
courts. Id. at 617-18 (declining to address “the scope of waiver by removal in a situation where
the State’s underlying sovereign immunity from suit has not been waived or abrogated in state
7

While Nordic Village involved a claim of sovereign immunity by the federal government, the
Supreme Court has held that the standards for finding statutory waiver are the same for state and federal
sovereign immunity purposes. Sossaman, 131 S. Ct. at 1658 n.4.

court.”).
As the First Circuit recently recognized in a case very similar to this one, the principle
announced in Lapides does not apply when the state removes a claim from which it was immune
in either federal or state court. In Bergemann v. Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management, 665 F.3d 336 (1st Cir. 2011), the court recognized that the Lapides doctrine is
predicated on avoiding the unfairness of allowing a state to circumvent a waiver of immunity in
its own courts by removing the case to federal court and then claiming Eleventh Amendment
immunity from federal jurisdiction. Id. at 341. Accordingly, the court held that where – as here
– a state’s sovereign immunity defense is “equally robust in both the state and federal court,” the
state does “not waive its immunity by removing the action to federal court.” Id. at 342-43.8
In this action, the State neither abrogated nor waived its immunity from suit in state
courts. Pivotally, the State is relying not on Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal
jurisdiction, but rather on its substantive sovereign immunity from a private FLSA action. See
Alden, 527 U.S. at 730 (discussing distinction between Eleventh Amendment immunity and the
underlying sovereign immunity “inher[ing] in the system of federalism established by the
Constitution.”); Stewart, 393 F.3d at 487-88 (same); see also Alden, 527 U.S. at 754 (holding

As the Bergemann court observed, the federal courts of appeals are not entirely in accord on this
issue. Bergemann, 665 F.3d at 342. The Fourth and District of Columbia Circuits agree with the First
Circuit and hold that removal does not constitute waiver in circumstances like the present. Stewart, 393
F.3d at 490; Watters v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 295 F.3d 36, 42 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The
Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits appear to read Lapides somewhat more broadly, though these decisions
do not turn on the State’s substantive sovereign immunity in either federal or state court, but rather on
Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal forum. See Board of Reg. of the Univ. of
Wisconsin Sys., 653 F.3d 448 (7th Cir. 2011) (holding sovereign immunity waived where state filed claim
in federal court, but reading Lapides broadly); Embury v. King, 361 F.3d 562 (9th Cir. 2004) (analyzing
only Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal jurisdiction); Estes v. Dep’t of Trans, 302 F.3d 1200
(10th Cir. 2002) (same). The Third and Fifth Circuits have taken a somewhat different approach, holding
that removal of federal claims generally waives only immunity from suit and not immunity from liability.
Bergemann, 665 F.3d at 342; Lombardo v. Pa. Dep’t of Public Welfare, 540 F.3d 190 (3d Cir. 2008);
Meyers v. Texas, 410 F.3d 236 (5th Cir. 2005). This issue appears to be one of first impression in the
Second Circuit.

that the FLSA does not abrogate state sovereign immunity in state courts). Therefore, the State
is immune from suit in both state and federal court, and did not gain any unfair tactical advantage
by removing Plaintiffs’ claims to federal court. See Bergemann, 665 F.3d at 342 (applying
Lapides in these circumstances would present states with a “Morton’s Fork: remove the claim to
federal court and waive immunity or litigate the federal claim in state court regardless of its
federal nature.”). Thus, considerations of “inconsistency and unfairness” that formed the basis of
the Lapides decision actually support allowing the sovereign immunity defense in this case.
Accordingly, the Court should reject any claim that the State waived its sovereign immunity
through removal.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the State respectfully requests that the Court grant its Motion
and dismiss Plaintiffs’ FLSA claim on the ground that it is barred by the doctrine of sovereign
immunity.
