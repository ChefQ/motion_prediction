XYMOGEN’S MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT
INVALIDITY CONTENTIONS

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 2 of 12

I.

INTRODUCTION
Defendant XYMOGEN, Inc. (“XYMOGEN”) hereby seeks leave to amend or

supplement its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions for U.S. Patent No. 8,491,888 (“the ’888
patent”). New evidence supporting invalidity of the ’888 patent obtained through discovery,
confirmed by the Court’s recent claim construction of the term “non-crystalline,” have
significantly expanded the scope of Xymogen’s defenses and counterclaims. This is information
that XYMOGEN did not know, and could not have known, last November, when the deadline for
final invalidity contentions came. In light of this, and as explained further below, good cause
exists to permit XYMOGEN to amend its contentions. Further, Plaintiffs Thorne Research, Inc.
and Softgel Formulators, Inc. (together, “Plaintiffs”) will not be prejudiced by permitting
XYMOGEN to amend its contentions. Therefore, XYMOGEN’s motion for leave to amend or
supplement should be granted.
II.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
This action commenced when Plaintiffs filed their complaint against XYMOGEN on

August 22, 2013, alleging infringement of the ’888 patent. (Dkt. 2). Xymogen filed its answer
and counterclaim on January 16, 2014. (Dkt. 11). On February 6, 2014, Plaintiffs filed their
reply to Xymogen’s counterclaims. (Dkt. 16).
Soon thereafter, the parties’ counsel met and conferred, and the parties jointly submitted
their Attorneys’ Planning Report and Proposed Scheduling Order on March 11, 2014. (Dkt. 17).
On the basis of that Planning Report and Proposed Scheduling Order, on March 12, 2014,

2

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 3 of 12

Magistrate Judge Furse entered the Scheduling Order currently governing this case. (Dkt. 19).
By subsequent stipulation, the fact discovery cut-off was set for June 12, 2015. (See Dkt. 28). 1
Under the Scheduling Order, the Final Infringement Contentions were due August 14,
2014; the Final Unenforceability and Invalidity Contentions were due August 28, 2014; and the
Final Non-Infringement Contentions were due September 11, 2014. (Id. at 3). Certain deadlines
set out in the Scheduling Order were modified, based on joint motions by the parties. (See Dkt.
Nos. 21-22 and 27-28). The deadline for the Final Unenforceability and Invalidity Contentions
was extended to September 12, 2014, and ultimately to November 26, 2014. (Dkt. 27). In
accordance with the Scheduling Order, XYMOGEN served its preliminary invalidity contentions
on June 9, 2014. (See Declaration of Scott Oliver, submitted herewith, at ¶ 3). However,
XYMOGEN did not serve final invalidity contentions because, at the time the final invalidity
contentions were due, it formed the belief that no amendments from the preliminary invalidity
contentions were necessary. (Oliver Decl., ¶ 5).
Evidence that came to light through depositions taken by Xymogen in January and
February 2015 – after the current deadline for Xymogen to serve its final invalidity contentions
had passed – proved that the ’888 patent may be invalid. Specifically, deposition testimony
provided in January and February 2015 revealed information that: (a) put into question the true
inventors of the ’888 patent under 35 U.S.C. §102(f); (b) suggested the ’888 patent may be

Plaintiffs have also moved to de-designate certain documents produced by XYMOGEN, which
XYMOGEN designated as privileged. (Dkt. 110). XYMOGEN opposed that motion on
November 20, 2015. (Dkt. 119). The parties agreed that Plaintiffs would have until January 8,
2016 to file a reply. (Dkt. 121, 122). The parties have also stipulated to an extension of
deadlines for motions for summary judgment to ten days after the Court rules on Plaintiffs’
pending motion on de-designation. (Dkt. 114).

invalid under the on-sale bar set out in 35 U.S.C. §102(b), and (c) indicated there was a
deliberate violation of the best mode requirement under 35 U.S.C. §112(a). (Dkt. 40 at 2).
The Court handed down its Markman order on October 8, 2015. (Dkt. 106). The Court
construed “non-crystalline” as “no CoQ10 crystals are visible by light microscope at
magnifications of 640X,” and “carrier oil” as “an oil that carries CoQ10 molecules across the
absorption cells in the intestine, increases the volume of the dose, and increases the overall
surface area from which the CoQ10 can be absorbed.” (Dkt. 106 at 6, 9). This confirmed
XYMOGEN’s theories of invalidity developed through discovery in the early part of 2015.
The parties have since met and conferred to attempt to reach an agreement as to
amendment of the parties’ contentions. (Oliver Decl., at ¶ 6). These attempts have proved
unsuccessful. (Id. at ¶ 7).
III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Utah Local Patent Rule 3.4 provides, “a party may amend its … Final Non-infringement,

or Unenforceability and Invalidity Contentions only by order of the court upon a showing of
good cause and absence of unfair prejudice to opposing parties, made no later than fourteen (14)
days of the discovery of the basis for the amendment….”
The good cause inquiry first considers whether the moving party has been diligent in
moving to amend, and then considers the prejudice to the accused infringer should the motion be
granted. See O2 Micro Int’l Ltd. v. Monolithic Power Sys., Inc., 467 F.3d 1355, 1367-68 (Fed.
Cir. 2006).

ARGUMENT
A.

XYMOGEN Has Been Diligent in Moving to Amend

Good cause exists for the Court to grant XYMOGEN leave to amend for two reasons.
First, XYMOGEN has been diligent in developing its invalidity case, including through
discovery and through the Markman process. Second, XYMOGEN has diligently sought to meet
and confer with Plaintiffs on the possibility of one or both parties stipulating to the amendment
of their respective contentions following the entry of the Court’s Markman order in October
2015.
1)

XYMOGEN Diligently Developed Its Invalidity Case Through Discovery

XYMOGEN diligently pursued its case through discovery from November 2014 through
to the close of fact discovery in June 2015. As outlined in XYMOGEN’S motion to amend the
scheduling order (Dkt. 40), new theories of invalidity only came to light during the depositions
of Messrs. Trevor Jones and Robin Koon on January 21 and February 12, 2015, respectively. In
particular, Mr. Jones’s testimony suggested – for the first time – that the ’888 patent is likely
invalid because the named inventors were not, in fact, the first inventors of the claimed subject
matter of the ’888 patent. While XYMOGEN had suspected that this was true from the outset,
and while the true inventor had testified about his invention, Jones was the first corroborating
witness on these facts. (Dkt. 40 at 3-4; Exh. A (Jones Dep. Tr. at 7:1-21; 15:6-17:20 and 23:324:6)). Mr. Koon’s testimony likewise suggested – for the first time – that a CoQ10 formulation
that embodies at least some of the claims of the ’888 patent was shipped to a third-party entity in
the U.S. in 2002-2003. (Dkt. 40 at 4-5; Exh. B (Koon Dep. Tr. at 104:18-108:5; 117:15-17);
Exh. C (Steele Dep. Tr. at 103:5-104:20)). Mr. Koon also testified that a crucial step in making a
5

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 6 of 12

crystal-free CoQ10 product was known by Mr. Steele and Mr. Koon, but that the pair made the
deliberate decision to omit that information from the ’888 patent application, in violation of the
best mode requirement under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 112. (Dkt. 40 at 5-6; Exh. B (Koon Dep. Tr.
at 160:20-162:5). XYMOGEN was diligent in developing these theories of invalidity through
additional depositions that were noticed for March and April 2015. (Oliver Decl., at ¶ 3).
Numerous district courts have granted motions for leave to amend invalidity contentions,
where new theories or proofs of invalidity only emerge during discovery. See, e.g., Oleksy v.
General Elec. Co., 2013 WL 3944174, *2-*5 (N.D. Ill. 2013) (granting accused infringer leave
to amend invalidity contentions to add a prior use anticipation defense, the court concluding that
the accused infringer did not learn of the prior use until a deposition during the course of
litigation, and therefore its delay in bringing motion to amend did not show a lack of diligence);
Prism Technologies, LLC v. AT & T Mobility, LLC, 2014 WL 656794, *1-*2 (D. Neb. 2014)
(grating motion to supplement invalidity contentions to add new prior art that was only obtained
through discovery, and was not available from a traditional prior art search); Helsinn Healthcare
S.A. v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., 2013 WL 3336859, *4-*6 (D.N.J. 2013) (granting accused
infringer leave to amend its invalidity contentions to add new contentions regarding a previously
pleaded on-sale bar defense and to add a new improper inventorship defense following receipt of
plaintiff’s document production during discovery).
In addition, the theories of invalidity that XYMOGEN first identified in early 2015
depended on the Court’s construction of the term “non-crystalline” in October 2015. Under the
Court’s construction, “non-crystalline” means “no CoQ10 crystals are visible by light
microscope at magnifications of 640X.” (Dkt. 106 at 4). This construction went against

6

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 7 of 12

XYMOGEN’s proposal, that “non-crystalline” should mean “lacking crystals.” (Id.) Numerous
district courts have granted leave to amend invalidity contentions where the court issues a claim
construction order that does not adopt the movant’s proposed construction. For example, in
Celgene Corp. v. Natco Pharma Ltd., the district court affirmed the magistrate’s order permitting
accused infringer to amend its invalidity contentions and add defenses under 35 U.S.C. § 112,
where the amendment was sought 23 days after the court had issued its claim construction order
adopting the plaintiff’s proposed construction for a particular claim term. 2015 WL 4138982,
*3-*5 (D.N.J. 2015). The district court judge in that case held that the applicable local patent
rule was broad enough to apply in cases where the court adopted a claim construction position
that was different from the movant’s position. Id. Similarly, in Radware Ltd. v. F5 Networks,
Inc., the court granted leave to amend invalidity contentions based on court's claim construction,
allowing the accused infringer to add a new § 112 defense and supplemental claim charts based
on previously disclosed prior art references. 2014 WL 3728482, *3 (N.D. Cal. 2014). See also
Ferring B.V. v. Watson Laboratories, Inc., 2013 WL 2325111, *2 (D. Nev. 2013) (granting
accused infringer leave to amend its invalidity contention due to the court's claim construction
order); and see LPR 3.4 (“An example of a circumstance that may support a finding of good
cause, absent undue prejudice to the non-moving party, includes a claim construction by the
court different from that proposed by the party seeking amendment.”)
Indeed, in this case, the Court’s construction has – for the first time – confirmed
XYMOGEN’s invalidity theories. That is, the CoQ10 formulation that was shipped in 20022003 may not have been “non-crystalline” under XYMOGEN’s proposal, but does satisfy the
Court’s construction, and therefore it falls within the terms of the on-sale bar under 35 U.S.C.

7

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 8 of 12

§102(b). Similarly, the step that was deliberately omitted from the ’888 patent application dealt
with a method for making crystal-free CoQ10 that falls within the Court’s construction of “noncrystalline,” and therefore, the failure to disclose this crucial step confirms the violation of the
best mode requirement under 35 U.S.C. § 112 and therefor limits the remedies available to the
Plaintiffs. Therefore, in accordance with the guidance of the case law, leave to amend should be
granted, and XYMOGEN should be permitted to amend or supplement its invalidity contentions.
2)

XYMOGEN Has Been Diligent in Its Meet and Confer Efforts

XYMOGEN acknowledges that more than 14 days have passed since the Court’s
Markman order. However, XYMOGEN submits that this delay is due to attempts to obtain a
stipulation rather than bring another motion before the Court. After the Court entered its
Markman order, XYMOGEN has sought to meet and confer with Plaintiffs to seek a stipulation
on the amendment of the invalidity contentions. (See Oliver Decl., at ¶ 6). A stipulation could
have avoided the need for the present motion. See West v. Jewelry Innovations, Inc., 2009 WL
152136, *2–*4 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (parties’ stipulation to permit reciprocal amendments of
preliminary infringement and invalidity contentions provide good cause of the accused infringer
to amend its invalidity contentions) (citing Atmel Corp. v. Authentec, Inc., 2008 WL 276392, at
*3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2008)).
However, a stipulation was not forthcoming. XYMOGEN received Plaintiffs’ final
answer on this issue, refusing to stipulate to allow XYMOGEN to amend its contentions, on
December 14, 2015. (See Oliver Decl., at ¶ 7). Under these circumstances, a flexible approach
in determining whether to grant leave to amend should be adopted. See, e.g., United
Therapeutics Corp. v. Sandoz, Inc., 2013 WL 7902649, *5-*6 (D.N.J. 2013) (granting leave to
8

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 9 of 12

amend invalidity contentions, the court holding that the timing of bringing the motion to amend –
three months after the discovery of additional prior art – was “not offensive, given the host of
considerations that re-shaping an invalidity case might invoke.”) Indeed, significant periods of
delay have been excused, where the accused infringer has otherwise demonstrated diligence in
preparing its case. For example, in Motio, Inc. v. Avnet, Inc., the court granted the accused
infringer leave to amend its invalidity contentions even though there had been delay in
discovering the prior art system, and 17 months had passed since the court had issued its claim
construction order. 2015 WL 5952530, *2-*5 (E.D. Tex. 2015). The court found that the
reference was not well-known and could have “paramount” importance to the case, and that
therefore, patentee could not argue that the reference was unimportant.
The same is true here: the information discovered through the deposition testimony of
Messrs. Jones and Koon was not known to XYMOGEN until January and February 2015, and
was developed through further depositions noticed for March and April 2015 -- well after the
deadline to serve the final invalidity contentions had passed. This testimony is of paramount
importance to XYMOGEN’s case; indeed, any one of these theories could on its own support a
finding of invalidity of the ’888 patent. But the viability of these defenses was not known until
the Court entered its Markman order on October 8, and XYMOGEN then sought a stipulation
from Plaintiffs to an amendment of its invalidity contentions (and Plaintiffs’ infringement
contentions) in light of this ruling. Under these circumstances, XYMOGEN was diligent in
pursuing its theories of invalidity, and any perceived delay in bringing the present motion should
be excused.

B.

Plaintiffs Will Not Be Unduly Prejudiced by the Proposed Amendment

Plaintiffs will not be unduly prejudiced by allowing XYMOGEN to amend or supplement
its contentions.

Plaintiffs have had notice of XYMOGEN’s potential new theories of invalidity

since at least March 2015, when XYMOGEN moved to amend the scheduling order. (Dkt. 40).
Further, as of the date of the instant motion, expert discovery has not yet begun, the trial date has
not been set, and motions for summary judgment have not yet been briefed. There can be no
undue prejudice to Plaintiffs in these circumstances. See, e.g., Celgene, 2015 WL 4138982 at
*3-*5 (finding no adverse prejudice resulted from allowing amendment because expert reports
had not yet been exchanged, fact discovery could be reopened for the limited purpose of
conducting discovery on the new invalidity contentions, a trial date had not been set, and
additional expenses in amending responses to invalidity contentions did not constitute undue
prejudice); Lexar Media, Inc. v. Pretec Electronics Corp., 2007 WL 1170633, *1 (N.D. Cal.
2007) (granting accused infringer’s motion to amend its invalidity contentions on the basis that
there is no prejudice where the patentee was on notice of the possible defenses during the claim
construction briefing and the patentee failed to show how it would have conducted discovery
differently if the new invalidity allegations had been in the case earlier). Indeed, given evidence
that Plaintiffs continue to seek, it is highly likely that Plaintiffs will at some point seek to amend
their infringement contentions. That they will not stipulate now is presumably an attempt to gain
some tactical advantage.
V.

CONCLUSION
The purpose of the parties’ respective contentions is to prevent unfair surprise--to lay

each party’s cards on the table about their respective infringement and invalidity theories, so that
10

Case 2:13-cv-00784-TS-PMW Document 123 Filed 12/31/15 Page 11 of 12

summary judgment can be orderly, and trial is predictable. XYMOGEN is confident in its
invalidity theories and plans to present them to the Court at summary judgment. Under these
circumstances--and in light of the Court’s recent Markman ruling and evidence discovered after
the original deadline had passed, good cause exists to allow XYMOGEN to amend its invalidity
contentions, and no prejudice will result to Plaintiffs. XYMOGEN respectfully requests that this
motion for leave be granted.
