Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 5 of 25

Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Discovery (“Motion”), which is long on rhetoric and short
on any meaningful explanation as to why the subject discovery is proper and necessary, should
be denied. Reduced to its essence, the Motion seeks to compel Bank of America (“BANA”) to
produce voluminous data and documents falling into three categories, all of which are of
questionable relevance, facially overbroad and unduly burdensome, and, perhaps more
fundamentally, not described with the reasonable particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 34.1
Satisfying Plaintiffs’ Motion would require BANA to spend millions of dollars toward the
collection, processing, and review of these data and documents when the case has yet to be
certified as a class and where the discovery sought does nothing to satisfy Plaintiffs’ burden at
class certification to establish that the claims and defenses as to the 56 named plaintiffs are
“common” or “typical” and otherwise meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.
First, Plaintiffs seek to compel BANA to produce all email and attachments (together,
“email”) authored by, received by, and/or copied to any one of 24 proposed custodians at any
time since January 1, 2009 (well before HAMP was even announced) containing any one of 274
proposed search terms (including, for example, multiple derivatives of several expletives).
Although Plaintiffs describe this demand as “specific” and “targeted,” it is anything but. To the
contrary, if such production were ordered, it would easily cost $3 to $6 million dollars and take
tens of thousands of hours to complete. Such a production is, by definition, unduly burdensome
and unwarranted, especially at this pre-certification stage of the litigation and where large
portions of the requested email has marginal, if any, relevance to the actual issues. Indeed, in a
similar HAMP MDL against another defendant involving the same Plaintiffs’ counsel, Judge
1

In meet and confer correspondence, BANA asked Plaintiffs to provide additional information
about exactly what Plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs refused Defendants’ requests, choosing instead to
press this Motion.

1

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 6 of 25

Stearns recently denied plaintiffs’ motion to compel production of similar email. See In re
JPMorgan Chase Mortg. Modification Litig., Case No. 11-md-02290, Order on Pls.’ Mot. to
Compel Produc. of Docs., at 1-2, Dkt. No. 87, (D. Mass. Jun. 1, 2012) (Stearns, J.) (“Chase
HAMP MDL Order”). This Court should do the same.
Second, Plaintiffs’ request that BANA produce significantly more IR2 data (data reported
to the Treasury Department over the past three-plus years) than it already has produced should
similarly be denied. Judge Stearns denied the Chase HAMP MDL plaintiffs’ motion to compel
the production of any IR2 data on the grounds that such data was not relevant, overly broad, and
unduly burdensome. See id. Again, this Court should not hesitate to follow this authority and
conclude that Plaintiffs’ complaint that BANA has not produced more IR2 data rings hollow.
Beyond this, the Court should deny the Motion, because the additional data Plaintiffs seek either
does not exist, will not permit Plaintiffs to discern the information they purport to seek and
would be unduly burdensome for Defendants to produce.
Third, Plaintiffs seek to compel BANA to produce virtually all data and documents,
many categories of which are vague and ambiguous and which Plaintiffs have steadfastly refused
to explain or clarify, relating to each of 3,000 randomly-selected loans. As an initial matter, the
information Plaintiffs demand grossly exceeds the scope of the discovery request upon which
they claim their demand is based and, therefore, there is no basis for an order compelling its
production. Moreover, even as to the data and information Defendants understand Plaintiffs to
seek, the production would be unduly burdensome, requiring thousands of hours and hundreds of
thousands of dollars to complete. This is, of course, the very result the production of a sample is
designed to avoid. Apart from these issues, Plaintiffs’ Motion on this topic is unnecessary and
premature. BANA has agreed, in general terms, to produce reasonable data and documents as to

2

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 7 of 25

each of the 3,000 loans. It is not, however, willing to comb all of its paper and electronic records
looking for every piece of information, no matter how immaterial or inconsequential, relating to
3,000 loans as Plaintiffs’ non-targeted Motion contemplates. Nor should it have to guess as to
the particular information and documents Plaintiffs seek. Rather, as Rule 34 requires, Plaintiffs
must describe what they seek with reasonable particularity. They have failed to do so.
ARGUMENT
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure protect against unwarranted fishing expeditions
such as those Plaintiffs invite this Court to authorize by the Motion. “[T]he party seeking
discovery information over an adversary's objection has the burden of showing [the
information's] relevance.” Cutter v. HealthMarkets, Inc., No. 10-11488-JLT, 2011 WL 613703,
at *2 (D. Mass. Feb. 10, 2011) (quotations and citation omitted). In addition, discovery – even if
relevant – should be denied if “the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its
likely benefit.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(iii); see, e.g., Amorim Holding Financeria S.G.P.S.,
S.A. v. C.P. Baker & Co., No. 09-10641-DPW, 2011 WL 5879433, at *1-2 (D. Mass. Nov. 22,
2011). Application of these principles here requires that Plaintiffs’ Motion be denied.
I.

PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR EMAIL SHOULD BE DENIED.
Plaintiffs’ demand that BANA produce e-mail and attachments, authored by, received by,

and/or copied to any one of 24 custodians2 since January 1, 2009 that contains any one of 274
search terms completely disregards Rule 26(b)(2)(B)’s instruction that parties need not produce
discovery of email from sources “not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost,”

2

BANA was not able to locate any information regarding three of Plaintiffs’ 24 proposed
custodians: “Sean Peirce,” “Christina Racelly,” and “Ken Feltch.” See Daniel Decl., ¶ 4 n.1.
With respect to proposed custodian “Ken Feltch,” BANA believes that Plaintiffs intended to
refer instead to Patricia Feltch, as her name has been disclosed to Plaintiffs in discovery as a
person with knowledge about loan modifications. Id.

3

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 8 of 25

and Rule 26(b)(2)(C)’s limitations. See Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth), § 11.446 (Rule
26(b)(2) “should be used to discourage costly, speculative, duplicative, or unduly burdensome
discovery of computer data and systems”). Indeed, in the Chase HAMP MDL, Judge Stearns
denied a comparable request for all email brought by the same counsel representing Plaintiffs
here as “overbroad, excessively burdensome, and likely to delay the progress of the litigation
without conferring any corresponding benefit in terms of shaping plaintiffs’ case.” See Chase
HAMP MDL Order at 2. The same conclusion applies here. Indeed, based on BANA’s
conservative estimates, implementing Plaintiffs’ demand could cost well over $6 million and
require as much as 100,000 hours or more of time to complete. See Decl. of Robert M. Daniel in
Supp. of Def.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Compel (“Daniel Decl.”), ¶¶ 5, 16-18.
A.

PLAINTIFFS’ PROPOSAL WOULD IMPOSE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON BANA THAT IS
NOT JUSTIFIED AT THIS PRE-CERTIFICATION STAGE OF THE LAWSUIT

As an initial matter, the process of simply collecting the 24 custodians’ email to make it
available for review is itself unduly burdensome and time-consuming. Rule 26(b)(1)(B)
explicitly limits initial discovery of email to information that is “reasonably accessible.” See,
e.g., Conference of Chief Justices, Guidelines for State Trial Courts Regarding Discovery of
Electronically-Stored Information, Guideline 1(B) (August 2006) (defining “accessible”
information as “electronically-stored information that is easily retrievable in the ordinary course
of business without undue cost and burden”).

See Daniel Decl., ¶¶ 6-9, 11.

4

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 9 of 25

The collection costs, however, are the tip of the iceberg. BANA will incur significant
costs to search and review the restored email. See, e.g., The Sedona Principles: Best Practices
Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Production (“Sedona
Principles”) 2nd edition, June 2007,Comment 2.b. (“Costs cannot be calculated solely in terms of
the expense of computer technicians to retrieve the data but must factor in other litigation costs,
including the interruption and disruption of routine business processes and the costs of reviewing
the information [and the] burdens on information technology personnel and the resources
required to review documents for relevance, privilege, confidentiality, and privacy.”).

. Id. ¶¶ 17-18. Based on the results of this “test run,” the conclusion is inescapable
that the email production Plaintiffs seek to compel would impose an undue and unjustified
burden on BANA and substantially delay the progress of this case. This provides sufficient
grounds to deny the Motion. See, e.g., McPeek v. Ashcroft, 202 F.R.D. 31, 34 (D.D.C. 2001)
(full restoration of email unnecessary based upon a “test run” for a single custodian).
B.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO JUSTIFY THE INCREDIBLE BURDEN THEY SEEK TO
IMPOSE

Rule 26(b)(2)(C) requires the Court to determine if “the burden or expense of the
proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in
controversy, the parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the
importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.” Given the multi-million dollar cost and
burden to BANA of implementing Plaintiffs’ proposal, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that it will
provide a commensurately incredible benefit. They have not done so. Nor could they, given the
large number of custodians and search terms with no real connection to the matters at issue.
1.

PLAINTIFFS’ PROPOSED CUSTODIANS AND SEARCH TERMS ILLUSTRATE THE
OVERBROAD AND BURDENSOME NATURE OF THEIR REQUEST.

Although Plaintiffs claim that their demand for email is “targeted” and “limited,” nothing
could be farther from the truth. The number of proposed custodians – 24 –
See Daniel Decl., at
¶¶ 2 &10. Yet Plaintiffs have made no attempt to justify the large number of custodians or to
explain why they need email from any given custodian on the list, let alone all of them.

6

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 11 of 25

Similarly, the number of proposed search terms – 274 –
. Id..4
Plaintiffs claim that they “tailored their proposed search terms to target only documents
referencing HAMP that are likely to have relevant information,” but their list includes several
categories of terms that have no conceivable relevance to the lawsuit or are so broad that they
will capture nearly all of each custodian’s documents.5 See Pls.’ Mem. In Supp. of Mot. to
Compel Discovery (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 5. A few examples illustrate BANA’s point.
Profanity. Plaintiffs seek to compel BANA to search for emails containing profane
words (and derivatives of these words). This, of course, cannot reasonably be said “to target
only documents referencing HAMP that are likely to have relevant information.” The only result
of searching for such terms will be the wasted effort of reviewing email that has nothing to do
4

Highlighting the unreasonable nature of their demand, Plaintiffs apparently view 24 custodians
and 274 search terms as only a starting point. See Decl. of Tyler Weaver in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot.
to Compel (“Weaver Decl.”), Ex. 6 at 2, Dkt. No. 128 (D. Mass. July 23, 2012) (stating that six
months after production of the initial email, Plaintiffs will provide additional 20 custodians and
additional search terms).

5

BANA raised these concerns to Plaintiffs, but received no substantive response. See Weaver
Decl., Exs. 7-9; Decl. of James McGarry In Supp. of Opp’n to Mot. to Compel (“McGarry
Decl.”), Ex. A. For example, on June 11, 2012, Plaintiffs informed BANA they would provide a
list of proposed custodians and search terms for email searches, noting that BANA would find it
too voluminous and unacceptable. McGarry Decl., ¶¶ 3, 14. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ claim that
BANA “repeatedly rebuffed” their request for email “[w]ithout explanation or justification,”
(Pls.’ Mem. at 2, 4) after receiving Plaintiffs’ request for proposed custodians and search terms,
BANA responded by explaining that the proposal was, in fact, untenable because the number of
proposed custodians and proposed search terms were (a) unlikely to reduce the amount of email
that would need to be reviewed and (b) not calculated to lead to relevant, admissible evidence,
and identifying specific examples of each type of problematic search term. Weaver Decl., Ex. 7.
Plaintiffs responded not by “invit[ing] BOA to make a counterproposal” (Pls.’ Mem. at 4), but
rather declaring that “we are at an impasse on this issue” and proceeding with the filing of this
Motion despite BANA’s good faith efforts to reach a compromise. Weaver Decl., Exs. 7-9,
McGarry Decl., Ex. A. This failure to meet-and-confer in good faith compels denial of
Plaintiffs’ Motion. See, e.g., Aponte-Navedo v. Nalco Chem. Co., 268 F.R.D. 31, 40-41 (D. P.R.
2010); Contracom Commodity Trading Co. v. Seaboard Corp., 189 F.R.D. 456, 459-60 (D. Kan.
1999).

7

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 12 of 25

with the litigation, but will no doubt embarrass the users of such language. Plaintiffs include as
many as 17 terms that fall into this category.
Non-Case Specific Terms. Plaintiffs also seek to compel emails containing non-case
specific, common words (e.g., “class action,” “breach,” “massive,” “unprecedented,” “jail,”
“prison,” “confuse,” and “database!”) that are so broad that the vast majority of resulting hits
will be irrelevant or minimally relevant to the facts at issue in this litigation.
Overly-Broad Case Terms. Even where Plaintiffs have attempted to tie a search term to
an issue in the case, they have done so in such a broad and overreaching manner as to ensure that
virtually every e-mail ever authored or received by any of the proposed custodians will be
captured and require review. Indeed, as demonstrated above, application of Plaintiffs’ proposed
search terms to the
. Id. ¶¶ 16 & 17.
sent or received by a custodian as potentially
responsive can hardly be said to be targeted and specific.
Given the prohibitively high number of custodians and the overbroad search terms, the
email production Plaintiffs seek to compel is patently unreasonable. Even without accounting
for Judge Stearns’ denial of Plaintiffs similar request in the Chase HAMP MDL, the cases
Plaintiffs cite compel no different conclusion; indeed, they counsel in favor of denying the
Motion. For example, although Plaintiffs claim that, in a substantially-similar multi-district
litigation, the Central District of California compelled CitiMortgage, Inc. to “produce emails
using the exact same protocol that Plaintiffs proposed to” BANA (Pls.’ Mem. at 4), the
circumstances are much different here. First, CitiMortgage “provided no evidence at all as to the
burden it allegedly would suffer in responding to” the discovery at issue (see Weaver Decl., Ex.

8

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 13 of 25

15 at 6), whereas BANA has provided the detailed declaration of Robert Daniel explaining the
estimated prohibitive cost and burden of the requested search. See Daniel Decl. Second, despite
CitiMortgage putting in no burden evidence at all, the court ordered far fewer custodians and
search terms than Plaintiffs seek here. See Weaver Decl., Ex. 15 at 9.
The other cases Plaintiffs cite in support of their claim that their proposal “is in line with
the standard practice for searching for, and producing electronic documents” (see Pls.’ Mem. At
8) are similarly inapposite. See Adair v. EQT Prod. Co., Nos. 10-cv-37 & 10-cv-41, 2012 WL
2526982,, at *2, 5 (W.D. Va. Jun. 29, 2012) (parties agreed to eight custodians); Walker v. Asset
Mktg Sys. Ins. Servs., 2012WL 827010, at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 9, 2012) (email ordered as to
search of servers, not from custodians’ historical documents).
2.

NONE OF PLAINTIFFS’ PROFFERED REASONS JUSTIFY THE PROTOCOL.

Without any on-point authority to support it, Plaintiffs next claim that the emails they
seek to compel are somehow necessary and appropriate because (1) BANA employees allegedly
“testified that they could not provide substantive testimony on key issues without seeing copies
of their emails” (Pls.’ Mem. at 3, 6-7); (2) it will uncover evidence relevant to Plaintiffs’ badfaith and unfair-practices claims (id. at 7-11); and (3) it will result in the production of relevant
internal BANA reports (id. at 11-13). None of these purported justifications supports Plaintiffs’
demand that BANA conduct millions of dollars of electronic discovery encompassing tens of
thousands of hours of effort at this pre-certification stage of the lawsuit.
a.

No BANA employee has testified that they could not provide
substantive testimony without seeing their old email.

In support of their claim that BANA employees are unable to provide substantive
testimony without reviewing their emails, Plaintiffs cite to the deposition testimony of three of
the 24 custodians from whom Plaintiffs seek email – Lourdes Duarte, Jinja Martin, and Elizabeth

9

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 14 of 25

Smith, only one of which was a 30(b)(6) witness, despite Plaintiffs’ suggestion otherwise. But
Plaintiffs grossly mischaracterize the testimony of these witnesses. Ms. Smith did not testify, as
Plaintiffs claim, that she “cannot recall what happened in meetings to formulate [BANA]’s
HAMP policies without seeing related documents that came via email.” Pls.’ Mem. at 3, 6-7. To
the contrary, she testified that certain meetings “may have” resulted in emails and that she did
not recall what “specific” emails, if any, were generated, and thus could not testify to the
“specific content” of these emails. Weaver Decl., Ex. 11 at 64:1-15. Similarly, Ms. Duarte did
not testify, as Plaintiffs claim, that she “cannot recall what inquiries she made of colleagues
regarding the ability to locate data without having her emails in front of her.” Pls.’ Mem. at 3, 7.
Rather, her testimony was that she did remember her inquiries, including what she had asked her
colleagues. Weaver Decl., Ex. 12 at 77-81. That she could not remember the “exact words” or
“specific verbiage” she had used in her inquiries does not mean she did not recall them and
provide testimony about them. See id. And, finally, Ms. Martin did not testify, as Plaintiffs
claim, that she
. Pls.’ Mem. at 6. Rather she testified that she had

. Weaver
Decl., Ex. 10 at 92:2-93:9. But, since she testified about the issue she had identified, Plaintiffs
charge of lack of memory is unsupported. Thus, while Plaintiffs’ claim that they need email
from 24 custodians because BANA employees cannot provide substantive testimony, the cited
testimony does not support the argument.

10

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 15 of 25

b.

Plaintiffs’ “evidence” of BANA’s purported “scheme to
wrongfully deny mortgage modifications” does not justify the
burden of their proposal.

Plaintiffs next attempt to obscure the defects in their argument to compel production of
email by pointing to testimony from two employees of BANA’s vendors that Plaintiffs claim
evidence some sort of scheme by BANA to “fraudulently” deny HAMP modifications. BANA,
of course, denies the existence of any such scheme. But, as relevant to the Motion, the purported
existence of such a scheme provides no legitimate basis for Plaintiffs’ request, because it does
not and cannot change the fact that the request will cost millions of dollars and consume tens of
thousands of hours. And, more fundamentally, the record reveals that Plaintiffs have grossly
mischaracterized the cited testimony in a failed attempt to support the Motion.
First, as to Christopher Orris (“Orris”), an employee of one of BANA’s third-party
vendors, Urban Lending Solutions (“Urban”), Plaintiffs’ repeated insinuation that Orris testified
that

group from July 2010 through January 2012, Orris

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 16 of 25

183:15-184:5, 185:13-19). Viewed in this context, the testimony that Plaintiffs cite adds nothing
to the resolution of this Motion.6
Second, Plaintiffs’ claim that the declaration of Bert Sheeks (“Sheeks”), a former Urban
employee, constitutes evidence that BANA directed, or knowingly allowed, contractors to
fraudulently deny HAMP modifications to homeowners who were entitled to them is similarly
incorrect. Pls.’ Mem. at 8. Nothing in Sheeks’ statement suggests that BANA directed or
knowingly allowed Urban to engage in any “fraudulent” activity. Weaver Decl., Ex. 14.
Moreover, neither Sheeks’ apparent belief that his job was to find any pretext to justify closing a
file or his opinion that requests for homeowners to provide missing documents were “often
suspect” support a conclusion that Urban engaged in any “fraudulent” activity.
Apart from these issues, and even if Plaintiffs’ characterization of the testimony of Orris
and Sheeks were correct, it would not support imposing the undue burden of Plaintiffs’ proposal
upon BANA. Nowhere in the Motion do Plaintiffs explain why their 24 proposed custodians
should be expected to have emails regarding BANA’s relationships with Urban or other vendors.
Similarly, their proposed search terms are obviously not “narrowly targeted” to identify email
focusing on these relationships. Plaintiffs’ invocation of some “evidence” that is arguably
relevant to their claims cannot justify the burdensome fishing expedition they demand.
3.

The Existence of Potentially Relevant Reports Does Not Justify
Imposition of Plaintiffs’ Burdensome Email Requests.

As a final attempt to justify compelling the review and production of almost all email of
24 custodians, Plaintiffs cite deposition testimony regarding the existence of several different
types of internal BANA reports (e.g., “control reports,” “pipeline reports,” and “MHA summary
6

In addition, further demonstrating the overreach of Plaintiffs’ proposal, Orris began working at
Urban in July 2010 (see id. at 6:14-20), after all but a handful of the named plaintiffs allege they
had completed their trial periods, and he testified that
(see 94:12-17; 189:23-190:6).

reports”) that may be attached to such emails. Pls.’ Mem. at 12. But this effort gets them
nowhere. Even assuming that these reports were relevant, their existence would not justify
Plaintiffs’ demand for email. If Plaintiffs want these reports, they should simply propound a
discovery request specifically asking for them instead of demanding that BANA undertake a
multi-million dollar search reviewing email to find them. This is particularly true where BANA
has already provided Plaintiffs with samples of many reports and identified the existence and
subject matter of numerous others. See McGarry Decl., Ex. C.
II.

PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING BANA TO PRODUCE
ADDITIONAL IR2 DATA SHOULD BE DENIED.
BANA has produced voluminous IR2 data,
, for customers seeking HAMP

modifications and comprising all information BANA had reported to the Treasury Department as
of the time of BANA’s production – March 2012. See McGarry Decl., ¶ 12. Apparently
unsatisfied, Plaintiffs now ask this Court to compel BANA to provide more IR2 data, including
(a) “any periodic summary data that were provided to the Treasury;” or (ii) “data sufficient to
identify when each borrower in the IR2 database received a denial letter, if any.” Pls.’ Mem. at
15.7 This Court should decline this request for several reasons.

7

Plaintiffs erroneously assert that, in February, this Court ordered BANA to produce all IR2
Data. See Pls.’ Mem. at 13. As the record confirms, the Court issued no such order. Indeed,
Plaintiffs did not serve discovery seeking IR2 Data until after they had filed the motion to
compel that was the subject of the Court’s February order. See McGarry Decl., Ex. D.(Pls.’
Second Req. for Produc. Of Docs., Req. No. 4). After BANA’s March 2012 production of this
data, Plaintiffs’ counsel was apparently so satisfied with this production that it highlighted
BANA’s production in its unsuccessful motion to compel production of IR2 Data in the Chase
HAMP MDL. See Chase HAMP MDL, Case No. 11-md-2290, Decl. of Kevin Costello in Supp.
of Pls.’ Mot. to Compel Produc. of Docs., ¶ 8, Dkt. No. 75 (D. Mass. May 24, 2012).

A.

THIS COURT SHOULD FOLLOW JUDGE STEARNS’ ORDER PRECLUDING
DISCOVERY OF IR2 DATA

First, while Plaintiffs avoid even mentioning it, Judge Stearns already has rejected a
Motion to compel IR2 data in the Chase HAMP MDL. Chase HAMP MDL Order at 2. In
denying Plaintiffs any IR2 data, Judge Stearns rejected arguments to compel substantively
similar data to those advanced by Plaintiffs here. Chase HAMP MDL, Pls.’ Mot. to Compel
Produc. of Docs., ¶2, Dkt. No. 74 (D. Mass. May 24, 2012). But Plaintiffs have made no attempt
– none – to explain why this Court should not follow Judge Stearns’ ruling, choosing instead to
ignore it. BANA has already provided more than enough IR2 data. The Court should deny the
request for more.
B.

PLAINTIFFS SEEK DATA THAT DOES NOT EXIST.

Second, the additional data Plaintiffs seek does not exist, and, even if it did, it would be
unduly burdensome for BANA to produce. As to “periodic summary data” provided to the
Treasury Department, and although it is not entirely clear what Plaintiffs mean by the term,

(“Bridges Decl.”), ¶ 5.

. Id. ¶¶ 7-8. This is so for many reasons as articulated in the Bridges
Declaration submitted herewith.8
C.

REQUIRING BANA TO REVIEW AND PRODUCE DATA FROM EACH OF ITS
UPLOADS TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT WOULD IMPOSE AN UNDUE
BURDEN.

Apart from the fact that the date of any HAMP denial or adverse action letter cannot be
“reversed engineered” from a review of each upload to the Treasury Department, the uploads
themselves comprise significant volumes of data the collection and production of which would
involve substantial time and expense and present significant technological challenges. Id. ¶ 9.

See id. ¶ 9-10.

8

To the extent Plaintiffs seek the date of HAMP adverse action letters to particular customers,
BANA can provide such information through the loan sampling process. See Decl. of Michael
Sunlin in Supp. of Def.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Compel (“Sunlin Decl.”), ¶ 5. However, since
Plaintiffs elected to press the issue in this Motion and in the context of IR2 data, BANA responds
in turn as to the issue presented to the Court.

III.

THE COURT SHOULD DENY PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL WITH
RESPECT TO THE SAMPLE OF 3,000 LOAN FILES AND DIRECT
PLAINTIFFS TO MEET AND CONFER IN GOOD FAITH ON THIS TOPIC.
A.

THE MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS’ DEMAND EXCEEDS
THE SCOPE OF THE RELEVANT REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION.

In December 2011, Plaintiffs moved to compel (the “December 2011 Motion”) – and in
February 2012, the Court orally ordered – BANA to produce information regarding a sample of
loan files in response to one of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. Critically, the Court ordered the
parties to meet and confer over the amount of data sought, recognizing that the original requests
were overly broad and unduly burdensome. See McGarry Decl., ¶ 12. Now, Plaintiffs seek to
bootstrap the Court’s February order into an order compelling BANA to produce data and
documents that far exceeds the scope of the initial discovery request, let alone any attempt to
comply with the Court’s order by actually narrowing the sampling information.
Plaintiffs’ Document Request No. 2 sought 10 categories of “Loan Level Account data”
for each loan in a randomly-selected sample. See Weaver Decl., Ex. 16. Therefore, the scope of
the December 2011 Motion – and the Court’s February order – was necessarily limited to these

9

As an “alternative remedy” to the production of additional IR2 data, Plaintiffs suggest that the
Court order BANA “to make a computer or server available which contains all of the databases
which contain information about when borrowers received notice that they would not be
provided a permanent modification, and allow Plaintiffs to designate a database expert to review
the data.” Pls.’ Mem. at 15. However, “even with a protective order in place, court-ordered
inspections of computer systems should be used sparingly.” Sedona Principles, Comment 10.b.
“Courts should guard against undue intrusiveness resulting from inspecting or testing such
systems.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 34 Committee Note (2006); see also In re Ford Motor Co., 345 F.3d
1315, 1317 (11th Cir. 2003) (granting mandamus to prevent implementation of district court
order allowing inspection of databases as abuse of discretion). Here, Plaintiffs provide no
justification for their extraordinary demand for access to BANA’s proprietary databases in
contravention of BANA’s data security policies. In the absence of such a demonstration, the
Court must deny Plaintiffs’ demand for access out-of-hand.
16

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 21 of 25

10 categories of “Loan Level Account data.” Pls.’ Mem. in Sup. of Mot. to Compel at 3 n.3,
Dkt. No. 92 (Dec. 2, 2011). In June, however, Plaintiffs demanded BANA produce 25 “data
points” – including such vague, ambiguous and overly broad items as “all notations” concerning
documents “related to the TPP,” “all waterfall outcomes,” “any and all underwriting data,” “any
pre-foreclosure analysis,” “all inline QA results,” and “all FAQ 1222 analysis” – and four
categories of documents for each loan in the sample. Weaver Decl., Ex. 4 at 2-3. As even a
cursory comparison demonstrates, these 25 “data points” encompass a much larger amount of
information than the 10 categories of “Loan Level Account data” sought by Document Request
No. 2. See Comparison of Records Sought By Req. for Produc. No. 2 Against “Data Points”
Sought by Pls.’ June 14, 2012 Letter (attached to this Opposition as Exhibit A).
Notwithstanding the vast expansion of their demands, Plaintiffs now move to compel
production of these 25 “data points,” relying heavily on the Court’s February order, but
conveniently neglecting to remind the Court of the much narrower scope of the discovery request
that the February order concerned and the Court’s direction that the parties meet to narrow,
rather than expand, the sampling information to be produced. See Pls.’ Mem. at 16. There is
simply no basis for a motion to compel or an order compelling production of the 25 “data points”
and four categories of documents for 3,000 loans because Plaintiffs have never served formal
discovery seeking them.
B.

THE MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE SOME OF THE INFORMATION
PLAINTIFFS SEEK, TO THE EXTENT BANA UNDERSTANDS PLAINTIFFS’
DEMANDS, DOES NOT EXIST OR WOULD BE UNDULY BURDENSOME TO
PRODUCE.

The Motion should also be denied because some of the “data points” Plaintiffs seek, to
the extent BANA understands them, do not exist or would be unduly burdensome for BANA to
produce for each of 3,000 loans. For example, Plaintiffs seek “all exceptions codes” for each

17

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 22 of 25

loan. See Weaver Decl., Ex. 4 at 2. However,

See Decl. of Michael Sunlin in Supp. of
Def.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Compel (“Sunlin Decl.”), ¶ 14. Without additional clarification of or
context for this “data point,” BANA cannot ascertain the information that Plaintiffs seek,
determine whether it exists, or, assuming it exists, determine the process for and the costs of
gathering it. Id. ¶¶ 12-14. The same holds true for a number of the other “data points.” Id.
¶¶ 12-16.
Even for those “data points” that do exist, the costs of producing many of them for each
of 3,000 loans is prohibitive.10 Id.¶ 6. For example, Plaintiffs demand “the date and amount of
any payments made pursuant to a TPP.” While BANA is willing to provide Plaintiffs with
payment histories for each of these 3,000 loans, Plaintiffs are demanding that BANA generate
the date “in an excel spreadsheet that allows [Plaintiffs] to manipulate the order of records as
needed,” or in essence, do Plaintiffs’ work for them. See Weaver Decl., Ex. 4 at 3. This data,
however, cannot be generated in the manner Plaintiffs are requesting.

See Sunlin Decl., ¶ 7.

Id.

10

To the extent BANA understands the “data points” Plaintiffs seek,
See Sunlin Decl., ¶ 5.
18

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 23 of 25

Id.
Similarly, it would be unduly burdensome for BANA to produce the documents Plaintiffs
have demanded for each of 3,000 loans.

See Declaration of
Lourdes Duarte In Support of Def.’s Opp’n to Mot. to Compel, ¶ 4.

Id. ¶ 6;
see also Sunlin Decl., ¶ 8.
Duarte Decl., ¶ 5. Given the burden of production of these “data points” and
documents would impose upon BANA, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied.
C.

THE MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO
MEET AND CONFER IN GOOD FAITH ON THIS TOPIC.

Notwithstanding the overreach of Plaintiffs’ Motion, BANA has agreed to produce
information regarding each of a randomly-selected sample of 3,000 loan files. However, BANA
has, to date, been unable to produce this data set because, notwithstanding the Court’s clear
instructions, Plaintiffs have refused to provide adequate explanation of the information they
want. See McGarry Decl., Ex. E at 17:25-18:9; 19:16-22.11
Instead, by letter dated June 14, 2012, Plaintiffs demanded that BANA produce 25 “data
points” and 4 categories of documents for each of the 3,000 loans by no later than June 29,
11

During a March 27, 2012, status conference, the Court directed Plaintiffs to tell BANA the
“precise data” they wanted and to “be very specific in terms of . . . the data for the sample ,”
See, e.g., id. at 17:25-18:9. The court emphasized that “the burden really should be on
[Plaintiffs], to begin with, certainly given what [Plaintiffs] have already discovered, to tell
[BANA] what [Plaintiffs] want.” See id. at 19:16-22.

19

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 137 Filed 08/20/12 Page 24 of 25

2012.12 Plaintiffs invited BANA to specify any points requiring clarification. Id. at 3. Because
many of the requested “data points” and document categories were vague, ambiguous or overly
broad, BANA accepted Plaintiffs’ invitation and asked for clarification. Id., Ex. 5. Plaintiff
refused to provide the invited clarification, arguing their request was “fully understandable” and
declared that the parties had reached an impasse. See McGarry Decl., Ex. F. BANA urged
Plaintiffs to reconsider their refusal to provide clarification (id. Ex. G), but Plaintiffs instead filed
their Motion.
Rule 34 requires Plaintiffs to describe with reasonable particularity the information or
categories of information to be produced. As discussed above, Plaintiffs have failed to do this.
Nor have Plaintiffs responded to BANA’s requests for clarification. Because Plaintiffs failed to
meet-and-confer in good faith on this topic, their Motion should be denied. See, e.g., AponteNavedo, 268 F.R.D. at 40-41; Contracom Commodity Trading Co., 189 F.R.D. at 459-60.
CONCLUSION
For all of the reasons above, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel should be denied.

Dated: August 20, 2012

Respectfully submitted,
Bank of America, N.A., for itself and as
successor by merger to BAC Home Loans
Servicing, L.P.,
By their attorneys,

Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion (Pls.’ Mem. at 16-17; Weaver Decl., ¶ 5), there was no
discussion of the specific information Plaintiffs wanted during the parties’ June 11, 2012
conference call. See McGarry Decl., ¶ 15. Although BANA was prepared to discuss its systems
and databases and the data contained therein during this call, Plaintiffs obviated the need for this
discussion by stating that they would provide BANA with a “master list” of elements to be
included in the sample, and the parties moved on to other topics without further discussion. Id.
