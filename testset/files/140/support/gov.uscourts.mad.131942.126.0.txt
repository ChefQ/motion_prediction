This Document Relates To:
ALL ACTIONS
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY

Plaintiffs respectfully move the Court pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37(a),
34(b), and Local Rule 37.1(b)(III), for entry of an order compelling the Defendants, Bank of
America, N.A. and BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, (collectively, “BOA”) to produce
documents relevant to class certification and to Plaintiffs’ claims in this case. The documents
Plaintiffs seek include materials this Court previously ordered BOA to produce, but which still
have not been fully produced.
In support of this Motion, Plaintiffs rely on their contemporaneously submitted
memorandum in support and the Declaration of Tyler Weaver and the exhibits attached thereto
(Exhibits 10-13 to be filed under seal pending Court approval). Plaintiffs also state that the
parties have engaged in a series of discovery conferences required by Local Rule 37.1, but were
unable to reach an agreement as to the items Plaintiffs seek to compel.
Specifically, the parties have reached an impasse on the following document requests:
(1) Electronic documents, including email, based on a targeted search for relevant electronic
documents, which BOA still refuses to even perform in this case; (2) Data BOA has withheld

that is necessary to complete the dataset that BOA provided to the Treasury Department as
produced in response to the Court’s ruling of last February; and (3) Specific data and documents
for a randomly selected sample of borrower account files, which the Court compelled last
February.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion and
compel BOA to produce the documents described herein.
