I. Pivotal’s Response Does Not Clearly Deny Hidden Profit, Nor Does it
Deny it Can Pay More than $9 Million.

3

The parties sell this settlement, along with attorneys’ fees with a 3.4 lodestar

4
5

multiplier, on the premise that $9 million is the most Pivotal could afford. Otherwise,

6

there is no sensible explanation for a less than 0.1% recovery on $5 billion in class

7

damages (excluding treble damages).1

8
The Fayer declaration and unaudited financial records only support that

9
10

tremendous discount if the Court indulges Pivotal every benefit of the doubt. As the

11

Dance Academy explained, “general and administrative expenses”, “operating

12
13
14
15

expenses”, and “professional fees” are stated in such broad terms as to hide
substantial profit. Even though it was class counsels’ duty to scrutinize this
information, they do not address the issue in their motion.

16
Pivotal responds that this is just speculation. Dkt. 130, at 14. Indeed, the Dance

17
18

Academy, the rest of the class, this Court, and even class counsel can only speculate

19

as to Pivotal’s financial condition with the bare-bone records submitted. Only Pivotal

20
21
22

can confirm or deny if these expenses encompass large salaries to principals designed
to give the appearance of a loss.

23

The parties attempt to dismiss this argument by suggesting the Dance Academy

24
25

has the burden of proving Pivotal can afford to pay more. But the parties, not the

26

Dance Academy, are the ones who shoulder the burden of establishing the fairness,

27
1

28

Dance Academy relies on the detailed analysis in its objection of why Jones would
not inevitably result in summary judgment on vicarious liability. Dkt. 112, at 1-2, 711 (citing Jones v. Royal Administration Services, Inc., 866 F.3d 1100 (9th Cir.
2017), opin. amended and superseded, 887 F.3d 443 (9th Cir. 2018).

1

reasonableness, and adequacy of their proposed settlement. Ohayon v. Hertz Corp.,

2

No. 5:11-CV-01662 EJD, 2012 WL 4936058, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 16, 2012) (citing

3

Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 959 (9th Cir.2003)). It is their obligation to

4
5

demonstrate that their pretext for settling for a miniscule fraction of class damages is

6

reasonable.

7

Rather than denying hidden profit outright, Pivotal cryptically replies that

8
9

“even if some portion of these categories of expenses included such items (which is

10

not the case), the dollar amounts at issue are not significant enough to materially

11

affect the conclusion that the settlement amount is fair and reasonable given Pivotal’s

12
13

financial situation. . . .” Dkt. 130, at 14 (emphasis added). What does Pivotal mean by

14

“some portion of these categories”? If it denies that “some portion” of these

15
16

categories include such items, does that mean other portions of these categories

17

include them? If the Dance Academy’s allegations are untrue, Fayer should have

18

submitted a declaration under oath clearly and unequivocally denying them. Pivotal’s

19
20
21
22

ambiguous response only heightens the need for detailed financial records that
accurately reflect the company’s financial status.
Further, a cursory look at Fayer’s declaration reveals that the dollar amount of

23
24

the categories identified by the Dance Academy (paragraph 3, lines 15-16; paragraph

25

5, lines 5-6) could substantially improve the settlement. Far more would appear

26

available to the class. Significantly, Pivotal’s motion fails to affirmatively state that it

27
28

cannot afford to pay more. Pivotal just states the obvious; that it “could not possibly
pay anything close to the statutory exposure [of $17 billion] in this case.” Dkt. 130, at
2

1

3. That potentially leaves millions on the table that could have been secured for the

2

class.

3

One of the opinions cited by class counsel, Rinky Dink, Inc. v. World Business

4
5

Lenders, LLC, illustrates the type of reliable financial data that would confirm

6

inability to pay a larger amount. No. C14-0268-JCC, 2016 WL 3087073, at *2 (W.D.

7

Wash. May 31, 2016). As class counsel noted, the court in Rinky Dink approved a

8
9

“settlement providing class members a fraction of their statutory damages because the

10

defendants’ financial condition meant ‘they are unable to pay a larger settlement

11

amount.’” Dkt. 127, at 9 (citing Rinky Dink, 2016 WL 3087073, at *2). The defendant

12
13

in Rinky Dink produced tax returns, audited and unaudited profit and loss statements,

14

balance sheets, income statements, and a UCC financing summary.” Id. at *3; see

15
16

also No. C14-0268-JCC, Dkt. 79, at 3. Only then was the court “satisfied that, based

17

on Defendants’ financial condition, they are unable to pay a larger settlement

18

amount.” Rinky Dink, 2016 WL 3087073, at *2.

19
20

Those are the types of records which class counsel should have insisted on

21

before agreeing to a more than 99.9% discount on class damages. This Court should

22

not approve the settlement without more than the conclusory statements and bare-

23
24
25
26
27

bones unaudited financial records justifying the settlement amount.
II. Pivotal’s Current Financial Status is Highly Relevant.
The parties are also mistaken that the Court need only consider Pivotal’s
financial status at the time of the agreement. Rule 23 does not say a district court may

28
approve a settlement if it was fair, reasonable, and adequate at the time it was formed.
3

1

Instead, the court must find, at the final approval hearing, that the settlement “is fair,

2

reasonable, and adequate.” FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(2) (emphasis added). That reading

3

corresponds with the district court’s “continuing duty to act on behalf of the class.”

4
5

Teague v. Bakker, 213 F. Supp. 2d 571, 576 (W.D.N.C. 2002); Goldenberg v.

6

Marriott PLP Corp., 33 F. Supp. 2d 434, 440 (D. Md. 1998) (“the Court has

7

a continuing duty to act as a fiduciary to the members of the class”); see also In re

8
9
10
11

Volkswagen "Clean Diesel" Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prod. Liab. Litig., 895 F.3d
597, 610 (9th Cir. 2018).
The parties cite no authority for their belief that the only relevant time period is

12
13

when the deal was consummated. Dkt. 127, at 20. On the other hand, counsel for the

14

Dance Academy found an opinion in this District specifically contemplating the

15
16

settlement’s fairness both at the time it was executed, and at the time of the fairness

17

hearing. In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., No. 13-MD-02420-YGR, 2017

18

WL 6497597, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2017) (“Based on the record at

19
20

the time of the settlement, the Court had no reason to believe that the settlement terms

21

and amount for these defendants were not fair and reasonable, nor does it have reason

22

to doubt the fairness and reasonableness now”).

23
24

The question of Pivotal’s financial status should not be a snapshot in time. If

25

Pivotal can now afford millions or tens of millions more, why should this court rule

26

that a settlement for less than 0.1% of class damages is fair, reasonable, or adequate?

27
28

Class counsels’ claim that “it is highly unlikely that the company’s financial

4

1

condition has drastically improved” is rank speculation. Dkt. 127, at 20. They do not

2

offer any reason for the Court to believe that to be true.

3

Further, the unaudited financial information, current through August 31, 2017,

4
5

was even out of date at the time of the January 31, 2018 amended settlement, not to

6

mention the forthcoming October 5, 2018 fairness hearing. This Court should not

7

grant final approval without demanding more detailed and current records.

8
9

Class counsel actually propose that more current records should not be

10

produced because they would have to be disclosed to the entire class, and in that

11

event the class members would have no opportunity to comment upon them. Dkt.

12
13

127, at 20 (“Nor would it make any sense for Pivotal to produce its current financials

14

given that the information would not be available to the class and they would have no

15
16

opportunity to comment upon it.”). This is the first time class counsel have shown

17

any interest in the class accessing Pivotal’s records (they actually argued against it in

18

the July 13, 2018 hearing),2 which the Dance Academy has advocated from the

19
20

outset. The notion that it would be inconvenient for the parties is not good enough.

21

More detailed and current records should be produced and disclosed to the class.

22

Notice should re-issue to allow time for class members to review the documents and

23
24

assert any objections.

25
26

Audio available at Dkt. 116. Dance Academy has requested the transcript from this
hearing, but it is not available at the time of filing this response. Dkt. 131.

III. Class Counsel are Not Entitled to $2.25 Million for Their Limited
Work and Poor Results.

1
2

Considering that the class members recoup less than 0.1% of their damages, the

3
4

case was on file less than a year before settling,3 and class counsel invested just 1,294

5

hours, $2.25 million in attorneys’ fees is far too much. That is particularly so

6
7
8

considering there is little reason to believe the parties’ primary justification for the
settlement—i.e., that Pivotal could pay no more than $9 million.

9
10
11
12
13

The parties dress up the net $5.5 million to the class by estimating “an average
payment of $142.91” to anyone who bothered to file a claim. Dkt. 127, at 1. But that
number has only grown because far fewer class members (2%) filed claims than the
parties anticipated (10%). Dkt. 70, at 16; Dkt. 91, at 7. Yes, some courts have

14
15

approved settlements with similarly low claim rates. But, 2% is a poor turnout, even

16

for a consumer class action. Ferrington v. McAfee, Inc., No. 10-CV-01455-LHK,

17

2012 WL 1156399, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 6, 2012) (discussing “the prevailing rule of

18
19

thumb” for claims rates “with respect to consumer class actions is 3-5%”); In re TJX

20

Cos. Retail Sec. Breach Litig., 584 F.Supp.2d 395, 404 (D. Mass. 2008) (“It is not

21

unusual for only 10 or 15% of the class members to bother filing claims.”); Dkt. 112,

22
23

at 14.

24
25

Class counsel rely on Bayat v. Bank of the W., No. C-13-2376 EMC, 2015 WL
1744342, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2015), which upheld a comparable per-claimant

26
27

recovery ($151) in a TCPA case. Dkt. 127, at 10. Considering the similarities in the

28
3

Dkt. 71-1, at 1-2 (explaining that suit was filed on September 26, 2016 and the
parties reached an agreement to settle on September 25, 2017).
6

1

cases, Bayat is instructive on fees. See also Dkt. 112, at 17-18. The net recovery for

2

each class member here ($2.89)4 is nearly identical to Bayat ($2.85). Bayat, 2015 WL

3

17744342, at *5.

4
5

Class counsel sought 25% of the fund, which would have produced a 2.76

6

lodestar multiplier. Id. at *8. The court elected to employ the lodestar method because

7

the percentage method “would yield windfall profits for class counsel in light of the

8
9

hours spent on the case.” Id. at 8-9 (citing In re Bluetooth Headsets Prods. Liab.

10

Litig., 654 F.3d 935, 942 (9th Cir. 2011)). The court could not justify the 2.76

11

multiplier “in light of the relatively limited class relief obtained[.]” Id. (citing Hensley

12
13

v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 431 (1983); In re HP Inkjet Litig., 716 F.3d 1173, 1178-

14

79 (9th Cir. 2013)). Specifically, just as in this case, “[t]he monetary relief is less than

15
16
17

1% of the full potential verdict value [and even less here], and less than 2% of the
class will receive any monetary value.”5 Id.

18
19
20

As such, the court allowed a 1.5 multiplier, which amounted to 13.5% of the
common fund. Id. at *9-10 (citing Kranson v. Federal Express Corp., No. 11–cv–

21

5826–YGR, 2013 WL 6503308, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 11, 2013) (awarding 1.5

22

multiplier); Trulsson v. Cnty. of San Joaquin Dist. Attorney's Office, No. 2:11–cv–

23
24

02986 KJM DAD, 2014 WL 5472787, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2014) (same); Powell

25

v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 569 F.Supp. 1192, 1204 (N.D. Cal. 1983) (same); White v.

26

City of Richmond, 559 F.Supp. 127, 134 (N.D. Cal. 1982) (same)). Although Dance

27
28

4
5

$5.5 million % 1,900,000 = $2.89.
37,970 claims filed among 1,902,283 members = 1.99% claims rate.
7

1

Academy believes class counsel should be held to their lodestar, in no case should

2

they be permitted anything beyond the fees allowed in Bayat. Certainly, the 3.4

3

multiplier should not be seriously entertained.

4
5

Even then, the actual multiplier is likely much higher than 3.4. Class counsel

6

dedicated a significant portion of their billing to mediation and settlement rather than

7

litigation. See e.g., Dkts. 103-2, 105. The fact “that a substantial portion of the

8
9

requested fees were incurred after the settlement was reached at the mediation” “casts

10

doubt on the value to the class of the billed hours.” See Manner v. Gucci Am., Inc.,

11

15-CV-00045-BAS(WVG), 2016 WL 6025850, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 13, 2016)

12
13

(emphasis original). Class counsels’ actual lodestar is likely much lower than the

14

$663,640.50 represented, which means the real multiplier necessary to reach $2.25

15
16

million is probably even greater than the already high 3.4 multiplier.

17

Class counsel attempt to whittle down the multiplier based on anticipated work,

18

including attending the final approval hearing, working with the settlement

19
20

administrator, and responding to class members. Dkt. 127, at 25. The Court should

21

not consider anticipated work as part of its lodestar inquiry. See 7-Elevent, Inc. v.

22

Etwa Enter., 2013 WL 2947112, at *5 (D. Md. Jun. 12, 2013) (“Plaintiff has not

23
24

identified any authority that would entitle it to an award of ‘anticipated legal fees and

25

costs,’ nor is the court aware of any”); Nat’l Alliance for Accessability v. Hull Storey

26

Retail Group, No. 2012 WL 3853520, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Jun 28, 2012) (“The law is

27
28

settled that in calculating the lodestar, the Court must use ‘the number of hours
reasonably expended on the litigation,’ and the movant ‘should submit evidence
8

1

supporting the hours worked” (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 and adding

2

emphasis)).

3
4

IV. Dance Academy’s Objection is in Good Faith and the Parties’ Ad
Hominem Attacks Should be Disregarded.

5

Perhaps nothing illustrates the poor relief offered in this settlement and the

6
7

overreaching request for attorneys’ fees more than the parties’ pages of personal

8

attacks on Dance Academy’s counsel. Obviously, ad hominem attacks are not legal

9

argument. Worse, the ones here are based on misrepresentations and half-truths.

10

Pivotal alleges that the Dance Academy’s objection should be questioned

11
12

because its counsel never approached class counsel about accessing the Fayer

13

declaration. As noted by this Court during the July 13, 2018 hearing, 6 that request

14
15

would have been futile.
Nor is the Dance Academy’s objection somehow improper because it was filed

16
17

on the deadline for filing objections. Obviously, the class notice failed to specify that

18
19
20
21

timely objections filed on the day of the deadline would be regarded as made in bad
faith. Class members should be free to wait until the end of the objection period to
gather as much information as possible to make an informed choice on the settlement.

22
23

If the parties wanted objections sooner, they should have set the deadline earlier.
There is also nothing improper about one of Dance Academy’s out-of-state

24
25

counsel, who was specifically disclosed in the objection, not appearing in favor of

26
27

local counsel’s appearance. This is consistent with the American Bar Association’s

28

(ABA) opinion regarding the unbundling of legal services and the ability of an
6

Supra n. 1.
9

1

attorney to provide limited representation of a client. 7 “Lawyers generally are

2

permitted to limit the scope of their representation of a client pursuant to Rule

3

1.2(c).”8 The Garber case referenced by Pivotal, while having admittedly harsh

4
5

words for Mr. Bandas, initially involved assistance of a pro se litigant.9 And even in

6

that case, the court declined to enter sanctions.

7

There is no evidence that Dance Academy’s objection is anything but

8
9

meritorious. While Dance Academy did echo some of the Court’s concerns

10

articulated during the fairness hearing (which the parties somehow construe as

11

inappropriate), it made several unique arguments, some of which were embraced. For

12
13

example, Dance Academy identified that $107,625 of class counsels’ lodestar was

14

unsubstantiated (Dkt. 112, at 3 n.6), and class counsel responded by submitting a

15
16

declaration from Matthew McCue substantiating his lodestar. Dkt. 126. Though the

17

Court denied Dance Academy’s request to unseal the Fayer declaration, it still

18

ordered the parties to disclose it to Dance Academy’s counsel. Dkt. 123. This, in turn,

19
20

allowed Dance Academy to serve as the sole voice of dissension to the parties’

21

collaborative position that these records establish Pivotal could pay no more.

22

Obviously, Dance Academy has voiced valid concerns with the settlement.

1

Otherwise, class counsel and Pivotal paint misleading accounts of Mr.

2

Hanigan’s and Mr. Bandas’ prior representation of other class members in other

3

cases. No court has ever found that “Mr. Hanigan’s objections lack merit because

4
5

[his] motivation is to extract a fee rather than to improve the settlement for the benefit

6

of the class.” Dkt. 127, at 18. As explained previously through sworn testimony, Mr.

7

Hanigan has never filed a baseless objection, nor has he ever been sanctioned for

8
9

having done so. See Chambers v. Whirlpool Corp., et al., No. 8:11-cv-01733, Doc

10

382-2 (C.D. Cal.). He receives hourly compensation for his work on all objections

11

and has never received financial benefit from settling an objection or an appeal of an

12
13
14
15
16

objection. Id.
The parties attack Mr. Hanigan as a “serial objector” based on dicta from a
single opinion that is, frankly, mistaken. See Chambers v. Whirlpool, No. 8:11-cv-

17

01733, 2016 WL 9451360, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2016). In Whirlpool, the district

18

court declined to impose sanctions, and the appeal from that valid objection is

19
20

pending before the Ninth Circuit with briefing complete. See Chambers, No. 8:11-cv-

21

01733-FMO, Dkt. 394 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2017) (denying sanctions motion);

22

Chambers, No. 16-56666 (9th Cir.). Elsewhere, district courts have rejected that label

23
24

as applied to Mr. Hanigan, and have insisted on sticking to the merits. See e.g.,

25

Jeffrey A. Thomas v. Dun & Bradstreet Cred. Corp., 2:15-cv-03194-BRO, Dkt. 80, at

26

37 n.11 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2017) (casting aside the professional objector label and

27
28

finding merit in the arguments advanced on behalf of Hanigan’s client); Edwards v.
Nat’l Milk Prod. Fed., 4:11-cv-04766-JSW, Dkt. 478, at 14 (N.D. Cal. June 26, 2017)
11

1

(“The parties briefed extensively which objectors are or are not so-called, quote,

2

‘professional objectors,’ unquote. The Court does not need to hear argument on these

3

issues. The Court wishes to hear, rather, substantive discussion of the settlement and

4
5

the merits of the pending motions and objections today, and not ad hominem or

6

personal attacks on the people making various arguments.”).

7

While the parties cherry pick cases where courts have gone along with the

8
9

“serial objector” narrative, they leave out the numerous instances in which clients of

10

Mr. Bandas and Mr. Hanigan have succeeded in overturning unfair settlements and

11

excessive fee awards. See, e.g., In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant

12
13

Discount Antitrust Litig., 12-4671-CV, 2016 WL 3563719, at *12 (2d Cir. June 30,

14

2016) (Mr. Bandas’ client was part of an effort in which the court “vacate[d] the

15
16

district court's certification of the class, reverse[d] approval of the settlement, and

17

remand[ed] for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion”); Eubank v.

18

Pella Corp., 753 F.3d 718 (7th Cir. 2014) (reversal of an unfair and

19
20

even

“scandalous” settlement on grounds raised in objection asserted by Mr. Bandas’

21

client); Litwin v. iRenew Bio Energy Sols., LLC, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 328, 333 (Cal.

22

App. 2d Dist. 2014), as modified (May 29, 2014) (reversal of final approval of

23
24

settlement based on a due process arguments advocated by Mr. Bandas’ client). Less

25

than a year ago, a client of Mr. Bandas and Mr. Hanigan succeeded in reducing

26

excessive fees sought by class action attorneys by $6.7 million. In re Lithium Ion

27
28

Batteries Antitrust Litig., 4:13-md-02420-YGR, Doc. 2005 (Oct. 27, 2017) (reducing
fees), Doc. 1906 (objection advocating fee reduction adopted). A few months earlier,
12

1

one of Mr. Bandas’ clients assisted in returning $4.3 million in excessive fees to the

2

class members. See Edwards v. National Milk Prod. Fed., 11-04766, Doc. 485, at 12,

3

19 (N.D. Cal. June 26, 2017); Doc. 441 (objection of Ira Conner Erwin). Another one

4
5

of their clients successfully prosecuted an objection to an excessive fee request in

6

Dun & Bradstreet, 2-15-CV-03194, Doc. 70, at 1, 6-11 (objection), Doc. 80 (order

7

awarding fees). The district court specifically “agree[d] with several of the objections

8
9
10
11

made by” Mr. Bandas’s and Mr. Hanigan’s client, and reduced fees from 30% to
27%. Id. at 37–38, 42.
Clearly, courts have recognized the validity of objections asserted by clients of

12
13

Mr. Bandas and Mr. Hanigan. Granted, some have taken the torch from class counsel.

14

But, “[m]erely characterizing . . . attorneys as ‘professional objectors’ without

15
16

specifying what, exactly, they have done that is either in bad faith or vexatious, is not

17

enough.” Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., 2011 WL 5873383, No. 09 CV

18

10035(HB) (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2011). Of course, it illogical to conclude an objection

19
20
21
22
23

is either proper or improper based on outcomes involving other clients in other cases,
especially when those outcomes are mixed.
CONCLUSION
Class counsel and Pivotal are clearly motivated to push this deal through. Class

24
25

counsel by $2.25 million and Pivotal by a whopping 99.9% discount on potential

26

damages. The Court should demand more than what has been presented concerning

27

Pivotal’s claimed financial limitations. Approval should not be granted on the

28
evidence before the Court. Further, as a matter of transparency, Dance Academy re13

1

urges its request to unseal Fayer’s declaration and accompanying exhibits. Even if the

2

settlement is nevertheless approved, class counsel should not be awarded anything

3

approaching $2.25 million considering the limited relief offered in this settlement and

4
5

the 3.4 lodestar multiplier.
