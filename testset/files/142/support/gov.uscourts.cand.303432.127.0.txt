I. INTRODUCTION

2

Plaintiff Abante Rooter and Plumbing, Inc. moves for final approval of the $9 million

3

settlement with defendant Pivotal Payments Inc. The Court granted preliminary approval of the

4

settlement on March 28, 2018. The Settlement Administrator, Epiq, mailed notice to class

5

members, reaching approximately 95.2% of the class by first class mail. Class members have

6

now had an opportunity to consider the settlement and choose whether to file a claim to receive a

7

portion of the settlement fund or to opt out. A total of 37,970 class members filed valid claims

8

and will receive approximately $22.73 per telemarketing call, resulting in an average payment of

9

$143.91 if the settlement is approved. Forty-seven class members opted out and only two class

10

members objected to the settlement. One objector is represented by lawyers who courts have

11

characterized as “professional objectors” and are known for filing objections “in an attempt to

12

throw a monkey wrench into the settlement process and to extort a pay-off.” Garber v. Office of

13

Comm’r of Baseball, No. 12-cv-03704 (VEC), 2017 WL 752183, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27,

14

2017).

15

All the factors that courts consider support final approval of the settlement. Continued

16

litigation is risky given the challenges Plaintiff faces in proving vicarious liability and may result

17

in nothing at all for class members. The settlement ensures that class members are compensated

18

without delay and eliminates the risk of loss at summary judgment or trial, as well as the very

19

real possibility that Pivotal would not be able to pay a damages award given its financial

20

condition. The parties devoted sufficient time to motion practice and discovery before

21

negotiating the settlement to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their claims and defenses,

22

and Class Counsel, who have successfully litigated many TCPA cases, fully support the

23

settlement. That only two class members objected to the settlement, raising issues that had

24

previously been identified by the Court and were addressed by the parties before the Court

25

granted preliminary approval, further supports final approval of the settlement.

Plaintiff requests that the Court certify the settlement class for settlement purposes,
overrule the objections, and approve the settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate.

II. BACKGROUND
A.

5

Plaintiff’s claims.
Pivotal provides merchant processing services to businesses nationwide. Plaintiff alleges

6

that Pivotal hired EPLJ, a business operated by Gordon Rose, to make calls by automatic

7

telephone dialing system (“ATDS”) to market its credit card processing services. The recipients

8

of these calls, including Plaintiff, did not consent to receive them. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 20-21. Plaintiff

9

alleges he received multiple calls on its cell phones made by EPLJ on Pivotal’s behalf. Id. ¶¶ 22-

10

72. Plaintiff never consented to receive the calls. Id. ¶¶ 73-74. Plaintiff filed a proposed class

11

action complaint on September 26, 2016, alleging that Pivotal violated the TCPA’s prohibition

12

of calls to cell phones using an ATDS or artificial or prerecorded voice, that the persons and

13

entities who made the calls were acting on Pivotal’s behalf, and that Pivotal and these persons

14

and entities acted knowingly or willfully. Id. ¶¶ 91-97. Plaintiff sought damages of $500 for

15

every illegal call and sought to treble those damages because of Pivotal’s alleged knowing or

16

willful violations of the TCPA. Id.

17

B.

18

The litigation and settlement negotiations.
The parties litigated for a year before commencing settlement negotiations. After Plaintiff

19

defeated Pivotal’s motion to dismiss, ECF No. 27, the parties engaged in targeted discovery.

20

Plaintiff served interrogatories and two sets of requests for production on Pivotal. Murray Decl.

21

¶ 4. Plaintiff also pursued third-party discovery from the entity that placed the calls, EPLJ, and

22

its principal, Gordon Rose, obtaining calling records documenting the calls Plaintiff maintains

23

EPLJ placed on Pivotal’s behalf. Id. ¶ 6. Pivotal, EPLJ, and Mr. Rose produced approximately

24

17,000 pages of documents, which Plaintiff’s counsel reviewed and analyzed. Id. ¶¶ 4, 6.

25

When Pivotal indicated that it planned to move for summary judgment as to its alleged

vicarious liability for the calls made by EPLJ, the parties briefed the issue of whether Plaintiff

7

should be able to file its motion for class certification first. ECF No. 55. The Court ruled that

8

Pivotal could file its summary judgment motion, ECF No. 58, and the parties stipulated to a

9

briefing schedule for summary judgment to be followed, if necessary, by a class certification

10

hearing. ECF No. 60.

11

The parties mediated with Bruce Friedman, Esq. of JAMS on August 31, 2017. Mr.

12

Friedman has extensive experience mediating TCPA cases, including cases involving vicarious

13

liability allegations like this one. Murray Decl. ¶ 10. During the mediation, Pivotal told

Plaintiff’s counsel that it was uninsured and did not have the money to fund a large settlement.

The parties also submitted mediation briefs, detailing the strengths of their respective

Plaintiff’s motion without prejudice on December 1, 2017. ECF No. 78. During the hearing, the

Court raised several issues concerning the proposed settlement: (1) whether the settlement

amount was adequate in light of Pivotal’s exposure; (2) whether a “claims-made” procedure was

4

appropriate; (3) whether Class members who received more calls should receive a greater

The settlement class is defined as:

13

All individuals, entities and persons to whom: (a) EPLJ or Gordon Rose
made one or more non-emergency telephone calls; (b) allegedly on
Pivotal’s behalf; (c) promoting credit card processing services, other
services, or goods of any kind; (d) to their cellular telephone number;
(e) through the use of an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial
or prerecorded voice; and (f) at any time in the period from April 15, 2016

The proposed settlement class.

SA § 1.4. The proposed settlement class is limited to individuals to whom EPLJ and Mr. Rose
placed calls in an attempt to generate new business for Pivotal. The class period commences on
April 15, 2016, which is the date the contract between EPLJ and Pivotal was executed and ends
on September 2, 2016, the approximate date Pivotal’s relationship with EPLJ concluded.
2.

The settlement fund.

The proposed settlement requires Pivotal to pay $9,000,000 to distribute to participating
class members and to pay the attorneys’ fee award, service award, and settlement administration
costs. SA § 10.1. After payment of the attorneys’ fee award, service award, and settlement
administration costs approved by the Court, the settlement fund will be distributed to all class
members who submit timely and valid claim forms using the following formula:

27
PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL
OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES - 4
CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

Net Settlement Fund (i.e., the Gross Settlement Payment less the Settlement
Administration Expenses, the Fee Award and the Service Award) divided by
the total calls received by Participating Class Members that submitted timely
and valid Claim Forms as set forth in EPLJ’s records multiplied by the total
calls received by each Participating Class Member (NSF/total claimant calls x
individual claimant’s total calls = Individual Settlement Payment).

See SA § 11.2. This formula ensures that class members who allegedly received more calls will

America, a charity dedicated to furthering the interests of consumers including preventing
telemarketing abuse. Murray Decl. ¶ 14.

The Court’s preliminary approval order.
The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on March 28, 2018. The Court

IV. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY

2

Settlements are favored, particularly in the class action context. In re Syncor ERISA

3

Litig., 516 F.3d 1095, 1101 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[T]here is a strong judicial policy that favors

4

settlements, particularly where complex class action litigation is concerned.”). Courts recognize

5

that a settlement approval hearing should not “reach any ultimate conclusions on the contested

6

issues of fact and law which underlie the merits of the dispute, for it is the very uncertainty of

7

outcome in litigation and avoidance of wasteful and expensive litigation that induce consensual

8

settlements.” Rodriguez v. West Publ’g Corp., 563 F.3d 948, 964 (9th Cir. 2009).

9

Proposed class action settlements are not effective unless approved by the Court. Fed. R.

10

Civ. P. 23(e). There is a three-step procedure for approval of class action settlements:

11

(1) preliminary approval of the settlement; (2) dissemination of notice of the settlement to class

12

members; and (3) a “fairness hearing” at which class members may be heard and evidence and

13

argument concerning the fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of the settlement may be

14

presented. Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) §§ 21.632–21.634 (2017). The first two

15

stages are complete. The Court must now determine whether the settlement is “fundamentally

16

fair.” Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1026 (9th Cir. 1988). The Court must consider

17

whether the settlement “is fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).

18

A.

The settlement satisfies the criteria for final approval.

19

The Ninth Circuit has established a list of factors for courts to consider when evaluating

20

whether a proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate: (1) the strength of the plaintiffs’

21

case; (2) the risk, expense, complexity, and likely duration of further litigation; (3) the risk of

22

maintaining class action status throughout the trial; (4) the benefits offered in the settlement;

23

(5) the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings; (6) the experience and

24

views of counsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant; and (8) the reaction of the class

25

members to the proposed settlement. In re Online DVD-Rental Antitrust Litig., 779 F.3d 934,

26

942, 944 (9th Cir. 2015). Each of these factors favor approval of the proposed settlement.

1.

The strength of Plaintiff’s case.

Plaintiff believes it has a winnable case. Plaintiff obtained an affidavit from Mr. Rose
stating that Pivotal approved a business plan authorizing EPLJ to use pre-recorded messages
asking individuals if they were interested in Pivotal’s payment processing and merchant account
services products, and that the pre-recorded telemarketing campaign made calls using an
automatic telephone dialing system. Murray Decl. ¶ 6. Mr. Rose stated that EPLJ made “cold
calls” targeted at businesses and that EPLJ therefore did not have any evidence that any of the
recipients of the calls consented to receiving the pre-recorded message. Id.
That said, Plaintiff faced a serious risk that it would lose on summary judgment,
recovering nothing for the Class. The Ninth Circuit recently affirmed summary dismissal of two
TCPA cases, finding that the defendants could not be held vicariously liable for telemarketing
calls made by third parties. See Jones v. Royal Admin. Servs. Inc., 887 F.3d 443 (9th Cir. 2018);
Kristensen v. Credit Payment Servs., 879 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2018). In Jones, the Ninth Circuit
held that a company could not be held liable for calls that a third-party telemarketer placed on a
theory of “actual authority” unless the plaintiff presents evidence of a written or oral
communication from the principal to the agent either telling the agent what to do or consistent
with the principal’s general statement of what the agent is supposed to do. Jones, 887 F.3d at
449. Pivotal adamantly asserts that it never authorized EPLJ to send prerecorded messages to cell
phones. To the contrary, Pivotal maintains that its contract with EPLJ required EPLJ to be
responsible for complying with the TCPA. ECF No. 95 at 17. Although the parties interpret this
contractual provision differently, Plaintiff faced the real risk that the Court would side with
Pivotal, resulting in dismissal of the case and zero recovery for the Class.
In Kristensen, the Ninth Circuit affirmed summary dismissal of a TCPA action where the
plaintiff alleged that the defendant was liable for a lead generator’s calls on a ratification theory.
Ratification requires a principal to have knowledge of material facts about an agent’s unlawful
act, and nevertheless accept the benefits of that act. Kristensen, 879 F.3d at 1014. Knowledge of
legal telemarketing activities does not suffice to establish ratification’s knowledge element. Id. at
PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL
OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES - 7
CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

1

1015 (noting that “knowledge of otherwise commonplace marketing activity is not the sort of red

2

flag that would lead a reasonable person to investigate whether the agent was engaging in

3

unlawful activities”). Pivotal insists that it did not know EPLJ was violating the TCPA by

4

placing prerecorded message calls to potential customers’ cell phones. Pivotal says that Rose

5

assured Pivotal that he was scrubbing for cell phones using proprietary technology. If the court

6

accepts Pivotal’s version of the facts, Plaintiff’s ratification theory of liability would fail.

7

Mr. Rose’s company was the telemarketer in another TCPA case where the court granted

8

a motion to dismiss on vicarious liability grounds. See Naiman v. TranzVia LLC, No. 17-cv-

9

4813-PJH, 2017 WL 5992123, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 4, 2017). In Naiman, the plaintiff sued a

10

payment processing company similar to Pivotal for prerecorded calls allegedly placed in

11

violation of the TCPA by Arris, another telemarketing company run by Mr. Rose. In dismissing

12

the case, the court noted that the contract between the parties put Arris in sole control of the

13

messages it sent to generate leads for TranzVia as well as the process that Arris used to audit the

14

data before providing it TranzVia. Naiman, 2017 WL 5992123, at *13. The court also observed

15

that the contract made Arris fully responsible for complying with the applicable law. While there

16

are ways to distinguish this case, it further demonstrates the challenges in proving Pivotal’s

17

vicarious liability for its telemarketers’ TCPA violations. See ECF No. 91 at 16-19 (discussing

18

Jones and Kristensen); see also ECF No. 95 at 9-18 (discussion of vicarious liability in Pivotal’s

19

memorandum in support of preliminary approval).

20

Even if Plaintiff could overcome the pretrial risks that remain, it would still need to

21

prevail at trial and, if successful, prevail on an inevitable appeal that could take several years. It

22

is also unlikely that Pivotal could pay a judgment in the amount of its total liability. Pivotal faced

23

a potential judgment of $5,796,836,000 if it lost at trial (11,593,672 calls x $500 per call). With

24

trebling, Pivotal’s exposure would have exceeded $17.4 billion. As discussed in Plaintiff’s

25

renewed motion for preliminary approval, there is a significant risk that Pivotal could not pay a

26

judgment of this magnitude—or anything even remotely close to it. See ECF No. 91 at 14-16; see

27
PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL
OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES - 8
CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

1

also ECF No. 95 at 2. Evidence that a defendant cannot pay a larger settlement or judgment

2

supports settlement approval. See Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1295 (9th

3

Cir. 1992) (courts consider whether the defendant can pay a large judgment or a larger

4

settlement); see also Rinky Dink, Inc. v. World Business Lenders, LLC, No. C14-0268-JCC, 2016

5

WL 3087073, at *2 (W.D. Wash. May 31, 2016) (approving settlement providing class members

6

a fraction of their statutory damages because the defendants’ financial condition meant “they are

7

unable to pay a larger settlement amount”).

9

Litigating this case to trial would be both expensive and risky. Discovery was still in

10

process when the parties negotiated the settlement. Had litigation continued, Plaintiff would have

11

to complete written discovery and depositions. Plaintiff had not yet moved for class certification,

12

and would have had to prepare expert reports and other evidence to support the motion. Pivotal

13

would likely move for summary judgment and might persuade the Court that it should not be

14

held vicariously liable for the alleged telemarketing violations. If Plaintiff defeated Pivotal’s

15

summary judgment motion, it would then have had to move for class certification, which is

16

discussed below. Assuming a class was certified, the next step would be trial. Trials are always

17

inherently risky, and a victory may be short-lived when followed by an appeal.

18

The settlement provides prompt relief for class members and avoids the risk and expense

19

of continued litigation. See Rodriguez, 563 F.3d at 966; Nat’l Rural Telecomm’ns Coop. v.

20

DirecTV, Inc., 221 F.R.D. 523, 526 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (“The Court shall consider the vagaries of

claims. The settlement fund will be used to pay the costs of notice and settlement administration,

11

attorneys’ fees and costs, and a service award to Plaintiff. Once these amounts are paid, the

settlement fund will be distributed to all class members who submitted a valid claim form. If the

2

TCPA action of approximately $97 per class members).

3

The cash payments also compare favorably to the potential damages of $1,500 per class

4

member, which puts Pivotal’s total exposure at over $17 billion. The proposed settlement is

5

reasonable and of fair value given the significant litigation risks Plaintiff faces in continuing to

6

litigate. The amounts are also reasonable given the high litigation costs and fees that would likely

7

engulf any amounts class members could recoup if they litigated their claims on an individual

8

basis. The costs of obtaining discovery from Pivotal, hiring an expert to opine about whether the

9

calling equipment constitutes an “ATDS” under the TCPA, and proving their entitlement to

10

damages would quickly exceed any individual class member’s potential recovery. The settlement

11

is also fair and adequate given Pivotal’s financial condition, which precludes it from paying a

12

larger settlement. See Reickborn v. Velti PLC, No. 13-cv-03889-WHO, 2015 WL 468329, at *6

13

(N.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2015) (finding the defendants’ financial condition “highlights the

14

reasonableness of the settlement amount”).

15

The settlement provides class members with cash payments now and eliminates the risk

16

of later payments at a reduced rate due to higher costs and losses in the course of litigation—and

17

the risk of no payment at all. “The proposed settlement need not be ideal, but it must be fair and

18

free of collusion, consistent with a plaintiff’s fiduciary obligations to the class.” Dyer v. Wells

19

nearly 1.9 million class members—most of whom received direct notice of the settlement—only

2

47 chose to opt out and two objected. Azari Decl. ¶ 24. This response supports final approval of

3

the settlement. See, e.g., Churchill Village, L.L.C. v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 577 (9th Cir.

4

2004) (affirming district court’s approval of class settlement with 45 objections and 500 opt outs

5

for a class of approximately 90,000 notified class members).

6

A total of 37,970 class members filed valid claims, or approximately 2% of the class.

7

Azari Decl. ¶ 25. While Plaintiff expected a larger number of claims to be filed, as one court

8

explained, the number of claims made is “irrelevant to the underlying issue; to wit, whether the

9

proposed settlement agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Casey v. Citibank, N.A., No.

10

12–cv–00820, 2014 WL 4120599, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Aug.21, 2014). Courts have approved

11

settlements with similar claims rates. See, e.g., In re Online DVD, 779 F.3d at 944-45 (affirming

12

approval of settlement where 1,183,444 of 35 million class members—less than 3.4%—filed

13

claims); Poertner v. Gillette Co., 618 F. App’x 624, 625-26, 630-31 (11th Cir. 2015) (affirming

14

approval of settlement where only 55,346 of 7.26 million class members—less than 1%—filed

15

claims); Moore v. Verizon Commc’ns Inc., No. C 09–1823 SBA, 2013 WL 4610764, at *8 (N.D.

16

Cal. Aug. 28, 2013) (granting final approval of class action settlement with 3% claims rate);

17

Touhey v. United States, No. EDCV 08-01418-VAP (RCx), 2011 WL 3179036, at *7-8 (C.D.

18

Cal. July 25, 2011) (approving a settlement with a 2% claims rate); Perez v. Asurion Corp., 501

19

F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1377, 1384 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (approving settlement where 118,663 out of

20

approximately 10.3 million class members submitted claims, for a claim rate of approximately

21

1.2 percent); see also Keil v. Lopez, 862 F.3d 685, 696-97 (8th Cir. 2017) (“a claim rate as low as

22

3 percent is hardly unusual in consumer class actions and does not suggest unfairness”). Even

23

those class members who chose not to file a claim benefitted from the opportunity to do so.

See Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S. 472, 480 (1980) (“Their right to share the harvest of the

The settlement is the product of arm’s-length negotiations.
“Before approving a class action settlement, the district court must reach a reasoned

3

judgment that the proposed agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by, or

4

collusion among, the negotiating parties.” Class Plaintiffs, 955 F.2d at 1290. When a settlement

5

is the product of arm’s-length negotiations conducted by capable and experienced counsel, the

6

court begins with a presumption that the settlement is fair and reasonable. See William B.

7

Rubenstein, 4 Newberg on Class Actions § 13:45 (5th ed. 2018); In re High-Tech Emp. Antitrust

8

Litig., No. 11-cv-2509-LHK, 2013 WL 6328811, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 30, 2013). This settlement

9

is the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties and their counsel, who are highly

10

experienced in litigating these types of cases, and was negotiated with the assistance of an

11

experienced and well-respected mediator. See Betorina v. Randstad US, L.P., No. 15-cv-03646-

12

EMC, 2017 WL 1278758, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 6, 2017) (“[T]he assistance of an experienced

13

mediator in the settlement process confirms that the settlement is non-collusive.”).

14

C.

15

The notice program complied with Rule 23 and due process.
The class notice program approved by the Court and implemented by Epiq satisfied the

16

requirements of Rule 23 and due process. Rule 23 provides that “[t]he court must direct notice in

17

a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.” Fed. R. Civ. P.

18

23(e)(1). When the class is certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the notice must also be the “best notice

19

practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be

20

identified through reasonable effort.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). To comply with constitutional

21

due process standards, the notice must be “reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to

22

apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present

23

their objections.” Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).

24

The Court approved the postcard notice in its preliminary approval order. ECF No. 100 at

26

the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections” and

4

for class members to object and the final approval hearing. See Chavez v. PHC Corp., No. 13-cv-

5

01797-LHK, 2015 WL 581382, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 11, 2015) (“Notice is satisfactory if it

7

Epiq mailed the Court-approved postcard notice by first-class mail to 1,750,564 class
members. Azari Decl. ¶ 14. EPLJ produced associated names and addresses for approximately

10

526,000 of the telephone numbers that appear on the calling records, and Epiq performed reverse

11

look-ups on the remaining numbers. Id. ¶¶ 12-13. When postcards were returned as

12

undeliverable without a forwarding address, Epiq used a third-party lookup service to find an

13

updated address to re-send the postcard. Id. ¶ 16. As of August 28, 2018, only 92,125 postcard

14

notices were returned as undeliverable for which Epiq was unable to obtain a more current

15

address. Id. Epiq estimates that the notice program reached approximately 95.2% of class

16

members. Id. ¶ 17.

17

Epiq established a settlement website with detailed information about the settlement. Id.

18

¶ 18. The website address was printed on all notices. Id. Located at https://pivotaltcpa.com/, the

19

website had 81,811 unique visitors as of August 28, 2018. Id. ¶¶ 18, 20. The website lists

20

important dates and class members’ rights and options, included frequently asked questions and

21

key documents from the case like the settlement agreement and motion for attorneys’ fees, and

22

allowed class members to submit an online claim. Id. ¶ 18-19. The long form notice was posted

23

on the website, and also mailed to any class member who requested it. Azari Decl. ¶¶ 15, 18. The

24

website (and notice) also provided a toll-free number that class members could call to reach a

25

24-hour automated phone system with recorded answers to frequently asked questions. Id. ¶ 21.

26

The toll-free number had received 5,295 calls as of August 28, 2018. Id. Class members were

also able to call a different toll-free number to reach Class Counsel with any questions they had

2

about the settlement. Class Counsel received approximately 1,450 calls and devoted nearly 200

3

hours to responding to class members’ questions and concerns. Murray Decl. ¶ 17.

4

D.

The Class should be finally certified for settlement purposes.

5
6

In its Preliminary Approval Order, the Court provisionally certified the following Class
for settlement purposes:
All individuals, entities and persons to whom: (a) EPLJ or Gordon Rose
made one or more non-emergency telephone calls; (b) allegedly on
Pivotal’s behalf; (c) promoting credit card processing services, other
services, or goods of any kind; (d) to their cellular telephone number; (e)
through the use of an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or
prerecorded voice; and (f) at any time in the period from April 15, 2016 up
through and including September 2, 2016.

13

ECF No. 100 at 2-3. Plaintiff demonstrated in its motion for preliminary approval that the Rule
23 requirements are satisfied:
•

14
15

Celano v. Marriott Int’l Inc., 242 F.R.D. 544, 548-49 (N.D. Cal. 2007).
•

16

on common evidence and can be resolved for all Class members at one time. See, e.g.,

18

Kristensen v. Credit Payment Servs., 12 F. Supp. 3d 1292, 1306 (D. Nev. 2014).
•

20

Whitaker v. Bennett Law, PLLC, No. 13-3145, 2014 WL 5454398, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Oct.

22

24
25

Typicality is satisfied because Plaintiff’s claims arise from the same course of alleged
conduct by Pivotal and are based on the same legal theories as the Class’s claims. See

21

23

Commonality is satisfied because the central questions in this case—whether Pivotal is
vicariously liable for calls made by EPLJ and whether the calls violated the TCPA—turn

17

19

Numerosity is satisfied because the Class includes approximately 1.9 million people. See

27, 2014).
•

Adequacy is satisfied because Plaintiff has no conflicts of interest with other Class
members, has demonstrated its commitment to the Class, and is represented by counsel
who are experienced in litigating class action cases and TCPA claims in particular.

CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

•

1

Predominance is satisfied because the overarching common question of whether Pivotal

2

is vicariously liable for the calls placed by EPLJ and Mr. Rose can be resolved using the

3

same evidence for all Class members and is exactly the kind of predominant common

4

issue that makes certification appropriate. See Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 136 S.

5

Ct. 1036, 1045 (2016). The other elements of Plaintiff’s claims can also be proven with

6

common evidence, including whether EPLJ and Mr. Rose used an automatic telephone

7

dialing system or a pre-recorded message to place calls to cell phones, and whether

8

Pivotal or EPLJ and Mr. Rose acted willfully.
•

9

Superiority is satisfied because classwide resolution is the only practical method of

10

addressing the alleged telemarketing violations of millions of Class members with

11

modest individual claims. See Local Joint Exec. Bd. of Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v.

12

Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 F.3d 1152, 1163 (9th Cir. 2001).

13

Plaintiff now requests that the Court finally certify the Class for settlement purposes.

14

E.

15

Class Counsel’s request for an award of attorneys’ fees should be granted.
Class Counsel filed a motion for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs on May 25, 2018,

16

requesting a fee at the Ninth Circuit’s benchmark rate of 25% of the settlement fund, which

17

amounts to $2,250,000 and includes Class Counsel’s unreimbursed litigation costs. ECF No.

18

102. The motion also requests a $2,000 service payment for Plaintiff. For the reasons discussed

19

in that motion, the request for attorneys’ fees and a service payment should be granted.

20

F.

The two objectors offer no reason to deny final approval.

21

Only two class members objected to settlement: Bruce Ebneter and Nancy Hightower of

22

Route 42 Dance Academy. ECF Nos. 111, 112, 125 (A third class member, Rich Baker of Rich

23

Baker Plumbing, filed the postcard notice he received with the Court. ECF No. 110. Class

24

Counsel left five voice mails for Mr. Baker but received no response. Murray Decl. ¶ 18.)

25
26

Ms. Hightower is represented by Timothy Hanigan and Christopher Bandas, who are
“professional” objectors to class action settlements. Garber v. Office of Comm’r of Baseball, No.

2

fall within a class of attorneys called “professional objectors.” Professional objectors are

3

attorneys who ‘file stock objections to class action settlements’—objections that are ‘[m]ost

4

often ... nonmeritorious’—and then are ‘rewarded with a fee by class counsel to settle their

5

objections.” (alterations in original) (citation omitted)); Chambers v. Whirlpool Corp., No. SA

6

CV 11-1733 FMO, 2016 WL 9451360, at *1 & n.2 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2016) (objectors were

7

represented by Hanigan and Bandas). Mr. Bandas states that he “does not presently intend on

8

making an appearance for himself or his firm.” ECF No. 112 at 4. This is apparently one of Mr.

9

Bandas’s usual tactics, as it previously prevented a court from sanctioning his conduct. Garber,

10

2017 WL 752183, at *5-6 (finding, where Bandas “refused to enter a notice of appearance in this

11

case” and instead “orchestrated other attorneys … ‘to appear’ on the various filings that Bandas

12

drafted or prepared behind the scenes,” that the court did not have jurisdiction to sanction him

13

even though these “machinations were designed to avoid his professional responsibilities to the

14

Court” and there was “strong indicia of his bad faith”); see also Chambers, 2016 WL 9451360,

15

at *1 n.2 (Bandas “does not presently intend on making an appearance for himself or his firm”).

16

“[W]hen assessing the merits of an objection to a class action settlement, courts consider

17

the background and intent of objectors and their counsel, particularly when indicative of a

18

motive other than putting the interest of the class members first.” Chambers, 2016 WL 9451360,

19

at *2 (citation omitted); see also In re Gen. Elec. Co. Sec. Litig., 998 F. Supp. 2d 145, 156

20

(S.D.N.Y. 2014) (finding that an objector’s “relationship with Bandas, a known vexatious

21

appellant, further supports a finding that [the objector] brings this appeal in bad faith”).

22

Numerous courts have concluded that Mr. Bandas’s and Mr. Hanigan’s objections lack merit

23

because their motivation is to extract a fee rather than to improve the settlement for the benefit of

24

the class. See, e.g., Garber, 2017 WL 752183, at *6 (“This court joins the other courts

25

throughout the country in finding that Bandas has orchestrated the filing of a frivolous objection

26

in an attempt to throw a monkey wrench into the settlement process and to extort a pay-off.”);

(KSC), 2013 WL 5275618, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2013) (striking objection after an

5

evidentiary hearing because “Mr. Bandas was attempting to pressure the parties to give him

6

$400,000 as payment to withdraw the objections and go away” and “was using the threat of

7

questionable litigation to tie up the settlement unless the payment was made”); In re Cathode

8

Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., 281 F.R.D. 531, 533 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (“Bandas routinely

represents objectors purporting to challenge class action settlements, and does not do so to

10

effectuate changes to settlements, but does so for his own personal financial gain; he has been

12

The Court should overrule Ms. Hightower’s objection. She is represented by two

13

professional objectors, one of whom has employed his usual tactic of not entering an appearance

14

to evade sanctions. The objection contributes nothing new to the Court’s evaluation of the

15

settlement because it merely raises issues previously identified by the Court and addressed by the

16

parties before the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.

17

1.

18

Both objectors challenge the sufficiency of the settlement. Mr. Ebneter says that he

19

21

No. 111. Mr. Ebeneter is expected to receive a payment of approximately $272.76, which

22

equates to $22.73 per call. Azari Decl. ¶ 25.

23

Ms. Hightower contends that the $9 million settlement fund is inadequate given Pivotal’s

24

potential exposure should Plaintiff prevail at trial on appeal. This is an issue the Court raised at

25

the initial preliminary approval hearing. ECF No. 81 at 2:20-4:25. Ms. Hightower dismisses the

26

challenges that Plaintiff faces in proving its TCPA claims, claiming that defendants will almost

1

always settle. But Class Counsel have litigated many TCPA class actions and know that

2

settlement is not a foregone conclusion. They have lost TCPA cases at class certification and on

3

summary judgment. ECF No. 103 ¶ 23; ECF No. 105 ¶ 26; ECF No. 106 ¶ 15.

4

Ms. Hightower offers a superficial analysis of the factors outlined in Jones, 887 F.3d at

5

450, that ignores the evidence in the record. For example, the first factor examines “the control

6

exerted by the employer.” Id. Ms. Hightower concludes that “Pivotal did assert some control

7

over EPLJ.” ECF No. 112 at 10. But that same finding was insufficient in Jones, where the court

8

explained that “Royal did not have the right to control the hours the telemarketers worked nor

9

did it set quotas for the number of calls or sales the telemarketers had to make.” 887 F.3d at 451.

10

The same is true in this case. Ms. Hightower also argues that telemarketers “entire existence

11

depends on companies requesting their services” in an effort to show that Pivotal and EPLJ are

12

not engaged in distinct occupations. ECF No. 112 at 11. But as the Ninth Circuit explained in

13

Jones, the real inquiry is whether the telemarketer is “an independent business, separate and

14

apart from” the company that hires it. 887 F.3d at 452. EPLJ and Pivotal are separate businesses

15

in distinct occupations. Ms. Hightower, of course, could have opted out and pursued an

16

individual claim against Pivotal if she was convinced that she could prove Pivotal’s vicarious

17

liability and obtain greater damages.

18

Ms. Hightower says that the financial data Pivotal supplied is unpersuasive and out of

19

date. However, the relevant timeframe for determining Pivotal’s financial situation is when the

20

deal was consummated, not some later time period. Nor would it make any sense for Pivotal to

21

produce its current financials given that the information would not be available to the class and

22

they would have no opportunity to comment upon it. As it stands, Mr. Fayer signed his

23

declaration on January 26, 2018 and it includes information about the company’s finances for the

24

last several years, including how the company was doing financially at the time the settlement

25

was reached. That is all that is relevant. Regardless, it is highly unlikely that the company’s

26

financial condition has drastically improved in the intervening period. Ms. Hightower’s

OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES - 20
CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

1

conclusory arguments offer no basis to question the financial information that Pivotal provided

2

in a sworn declaration. See Torisi v. Tucson Elec. Power Co., 8 F.3d 1370, 1376 (9th Cir. 1993)

3

(rejecting challenges to evidence of the defendant’s financial condition because the objector

4

“offers nothing but conclusory argument to the contrary”).

5

Ms. Hightower also reiterates her argument that Mr. Fayer’s declaration should be

6

unsealed. The parties briefed this issue at length, see ECF Nos. 121 & 122, and the Court ruled

7

that it was appropriate to seal the confidential financial information in the declaration. ECF No.

8

123. Ms. Hightower makes no new points in her supplemental objection.

9
10

2.

As the Court previously recognized, it was appropriate to use a claims process.

Ms. Hightower argues that payments should have been mailed directly to class members.

11

This is also an issue the Court raised at the initial preliminary approval hearing. ECF No. 81 at

12

4:14-23. In their renewed motion for preliminary approval, Plaintiff pointed out that submitting a

13

claim required minimal effort, since the class member had only to enter a name, physical

14

address, email address, contact telephone number, the telephone number that received the call,

15

and provide a signature. ECF No. 92-1 Ex. 1. The parties also ensured that mechanisms were in

16

place to encourage the filing of claims. See Schulte v. Fifth Third Bank, 805 F. Supp. 2d 560, 591

17

(N.D. Ill. July 29, 2011) (observing that the proposed claim form was “not unduly burdensome,

18

long, or complex” and the parties’ “use of a settlement website and toll free number suggests that

19

the claims process was designed to encourage—not discourage—the filing of claims”).

20

When no notice has previously been sent to the class (as it would be if, for example, the

21

class was previously certified) and class members’ contact information has not been verified as

22

current, courts recognize that a claims process is appropriate. See, e.g., In re Uber FCRA Litig.,

23

No. 14-cv-05200-EMC, 2017 WL 2806698, at *8 (N.D. Cal. June 29, 2017); Braynen v.

24

Nationstar Mortg., LLC, No. 14-CV-20726, 2015 WL 6872519, at *14 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 9, 2015).

25

Using a claims process ensures that settlement funds are not sent out to unverified addresses,

26

which would be both inefficient and unnecessarily expensive. See In re Uber, 2017 WL

2806698, at *8 (“In short, the overall recovery of the class would likely be lessened for a highly

2

uncertain benefit, given the likelihood that much of the available contact information is

3

outdated.”). Indeed, the Settlement Administrator estimated that sending checks directly to class

4

members would add more than a million dollars to the anticipated cost of the notice program.

5

ECF No. 93 (Azari Decl.) ¶ 21 (the cost of administration would increase from $1,231,675 to

$2,241,000). Numerous courts have recognized that “there is nothing inherently objectionable”

7

about a claims-submission process, especially when it ensures that only verified class members

*9 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2012) (overruling objection that the defendants knew who everyone in the

10

class is and thus could simply send everyone cash, noting that courts “routinely approve claims-

11

made settlements,” and citing cases); see also In re Online DVD, 779 F.3d at 944–945

12

(approving settlement where cash component of settlement was divided among claimants).

13

Ms. Hightower cites Rodriguez v. Kraft Foods Group, Inc., but the settlement in that case

14

did not involve a claim process. No. 1:14-cv-1137-LJO-EPG, 2016 WL 5844378, at *3, 8 (E.D.

15

Cal. Oct. 4, 2016). In the other cases she cites courts granted final approval despite low claim

16

rates. See Eastwood v. S. Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., No. 3:11-CV-3075, 2014 WL 4987421, at

17

*3-5 (W.D. Ark. Oct. 7, 2014) (approving settlement despite disappointment with the low claims

18

rate, and noting that “some responsibility for class participation should be laid at the feet of the

19

class members themselves”); Larsen v. Trader Joe’s Co., No. 11-cv-06188, 2014 WL 3404531,

20

at *1-2 (N.D. Cal. July 11, 2014) (approving settlement of claims of all persons who purchased

21

products labeled as “all natural” even though only 59,830 class members filed claims).

Finally, Ms. Hightower objects to the amount of requested attorneys’ fee, another issue

The requested attorneys’ fees, which include umreimbursed costs, are reasonable.

24

the Court raised at the initial preliminary approval hearing. ECF No. 81 at 5:16-20. Plaintiff

25

addressed the appropriateness of the percentage-of-the-fund method and the 25% benchmark for

26

the fee award in this case, as well as the factors courts consider in deciding whether the

CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

1

benchmark should be adjusted, in its motion for attorneys’ fees. See ECF No. 102. Plaintiff

2

inadvertently omitted Mr. McCue’s detailed time records and has since filed them. See ECF No.

3

126; see also Murray Decl. ¶ 19. While it did not include the time records, the declaration Mr.

4

McCue filed in support of the motion summarized the hours he dedicated to this litigation and

5

described the work he performed. See ECF No. 106 (McCue Declaration).

6

Ms. Hightower argues that the fee should be adjusted downward or be limited to Class

7

Counsel’s lodestar. But the fact that Pivotal could not afford a greater settlement does not

8

warrant reducing the fee award. Pivotal’s financial situation made the litigation even more risky

9

for Class Counsel, who faced the prospect of no recovery for their work. Class Counsel had to

10

vigorously pursue class members’ claims while remaining mindful of their time and expenses—

11

in fact, Ms. Hightower recognizes that Class Counsel were able to translate their substantial

12

experience with these types of cases into a restrained approach that kept their total hours

13

relatively low. Class Counsel ultimately achieved a recovery that will pay approximately

14

$143.91 to each class member who filed a claim, justifying a fee award at the Ninth Circuit’s

15

benchmark of 25% of the common fund.

16

Plaintiff cited cases in which courts have awarded fees at or above the Ninth Circuit’s

17

25% benchmark in TCPA settlements. ECF No. 102 at 15-16. That Ms. Hightower is able to cite

18

cases in which courts awarded a reduced fee does not demonstrate that an adjustment is

19

warranted in this case. Moreover, in the cases she cites the courts identified “special

20

circumstances” that supported a reduction. Six Mexican Workers v. Ariz. Citrus Growers, 904

21

F.2d 1301, 1311 (9th Cir. 1990) (noting that a lodestar recovery may be used “when special

22

circumstances indicate that the percentage recovery would be either too small or too large in

23

light of the hours devoted to the case or other relevant factors” but approving a fee of 25% of the

24

common fund); see also Bayat, 2015 WL 1744342, at *9 (awarding a fee of class counsel’s

25

lodestar plus a 50% multiplier where counsel spent only 621 hours litigating the case); Rose v.

26

Bank of Am. Corp., No. 5:11-cv-02390-EJD, 2014 WL 4273358, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2014)

(settlement resolved six separate cases litigated by a total of 18 attorneys); Michel v. WM

2

Healthcare Solutions, Inc., No. 1:10-cv-638, 2014 WL 497031, at *17 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 7, 2014)

3

(awarding a percentage of the fund but adjusting it downward after considering the factors the

4

Sixth Circuit uses to evaluate fee awards and noting that the quality of counsel’s work was

5

“ordinary at best” given the many errors in the settlement process); Malta v. Fed. Home Loan

6

Mortg. Corp., No. 10-cv-1290-BEN-NLS, 2013 WL 12095060, at *1 (S.D. Cal. June 21, 2013)

7

(class counsel sought only 22.5% of the common fund, and the court awarded that amount);

8

Arthur v. Sallie Mae, Inc., No. 10-cv-00198-JLR, 2012 WL 4076119, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Sept.

9

17, 2012) (district court did not explain why it awarded a fee of 20% of the common fund instead

10
11

of the 25% benchmark after praising counsel and the settlement).
Ms. Hightower’s advocacy of the lodestar method ignores the many advantages of the

12

percentage-of-the-fund method recognized by courts and commentators. See, e.g., In re Rite Aid

13

Corp. Secs. Litig., 396 F.3d 294, 300 (3d Cir. 2005) (the percentage method “is generally favored

14

in common fund cases because it allows courts to award fees from the fund ‘in a manner that

15

rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for failure’” (citation omitted)); Alan Hirsch, et al.,

16

Awarding Attorneys’ Fees and Managing Fee Litigation, 82-83 (Federal Judicial Center 3d ed.

17

2015) (the percentage method “helps ensure that the fee award will simulate marketplace rates,

18

since most common fund cases are handled on a contingency basis” and “unlike the lodestar

19

method, the percentage method provides incentives to plaintiff’s counsel to settle the case early

20

and avoid racking up litigation fees”); William B. Rubenstein, Why the Percentage Method?, 2

21

Class Action Attorney Fee Digest 93 (March 2008) (“[U]nder the percentage method, counsel

22

has an interest in generating as large a recovery for the class as possible, as her fee increases with

23

the class’s take, while keeping her hours to the minimum necessary to do the job effectively.”).

24

She also ignores the negative incentives created by the lodestar method. See Vizcaino v.

25

Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043, 1050 n.5 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[I]t is widely recognized that the

26

lodestar method creates incentives for counsel to expend more hours than may be necessary on

27
PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL
OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS;
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES - 24
CASE NO. 3:16-CV-05486-JCS

1

litigating a case so as to recover a reasonable fee, since the lodestar method does not reward

2

early settlement”); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 121 (2d Cir. 2005)

3

(the lodestar method “create[s] an unanticipated disincentive to early settlements, tempt[s]

4

lawyers to run up their hours, and compel[s] district courts to engage in a gimlet-eyed review of

5

line-item fee audits” (alterations in original) (citation omitted)).

6

In a case like this one, where Class Counsel were faced with a financially challenged

7

defendant and difficulties in proving the merits, the percentage-of-the-fund method will

8

appropriately reward Counsel’s efficiency and skill, as well as the risk they undertook. Class

9

Counsel also do not seek separate reimbursement of their expenses, which total more than

10

$50,000. And since filing their fee motion, Class Counsel have devoted hundreds of additional

11

hours to this litigation, including responding to class member inquiries, preparing this motion,

12

and addressing Ms. Hightower’s objections to the sealing of Pivotal’s financial information and

13

to the settlement. Class Counsel will attend the final approval hearing and will continue to work

14

with the Settlement Administrator on implementing the settlement and to respond to class

15

member inquiries. By the time the case has concluded, Class Counsel’s lodestar will exceed the

16

$663,640.50 they had incurred as of late May and the multiplier will be much lower. None of the

17

cases Ms. Hightower cites supports use of the lodestar method or a reduced multiplier,

18

particularly since courts “routinely enhance[] the lodestar to reflect the risk of non-payment in

19

common fund cases.” Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1051; see also id. at 1051 n.6 (collecting cases in

20

which courts awarded multipliers up to 4). In Landsman & Funk, P.C. v. Skinder-Strauss

21

Associates, for example, the Third Circuit affirmed a fee award of one-third of the $625,000

22

common fund, which represented a 2x multiplier. 639 F. App’x. 880, 883 (3d Cir. 2016).

V. CONCLUSION
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court certify the settlement class, overrule the
objections, and approve the settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate.
