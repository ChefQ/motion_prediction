OBJECTION TO MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h), class members Peter A. Spitalieri, Trustee w/t/d
6/10/88, and 771 Freedom Street LP, both of 1140 Terex Road, Hudson, OH 44236,
hereby submit this objection to Lead Plaintiffs' Application For An Award Of Attorneys'
Fees And Expenses ("Fee Application") that was filed on July 24, 2008. Peter A.
Spitalieri purchased 710 shares of Veritas stock on January 23, 2004, and held all 710
shares as of the close of trading on July 2, 2004. 771 Freedom Street LP purchased 465
shares of Veritas stock on January 23, 2004, and held all 465 shares as of the close of

trading on July 2, 2004.!

I. Class Counsel Failed to Direct Notice of Its Fee Motion to Class
Members in a Reasonable Manner.

The Notice of Pendency And Proposed Settlement of Class Litigation ("Notice")
fails to provide the information required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23centh)
provides:

(1) Motion for Award of Attorney Fees. A claim for an award of attorney fees
and nontaxable costs must be made by motion under Rule 54(d)(2), subject to
the provisions of this subdivision, at a time set by the court. Notice of the
motion must be served on all parties and, for motions by class counsel,
directed to class members in a reasonable manner.

(2) Objections to Motion. A class member, or a party from whom payment is
sought, may object to the motion.

 

` Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1.2 {(b), this response has been filed within
10 days of the filing of Class Counsel's Fee Application. While the Fee
Application was never properly served on class members pursuant to Rule
23(h} (1), counsel for objectors downloaded it from PACER on July 24,
2008.
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 ~~ Filed 07/29/2008 Page 2of13

The right granted by this rule is the right to object to "the motion," not to the amount of
fees requested by the motion. Therefore, logically, objections to the motion cannot be
due prior to the time the motion is filed.

The Notice requires that any objections to the settlement or to class counsel's
attorney's fees must be filed by June 30, 2008, long before Class Counsel filed its Fee
Application. Pursuant to Rule 23{h)(2) and Local Rule 7.1.2(b), each class member,
including the two undersigned objectors, has the right to object to Class Counsel's fee
motion within ten days of its filing. The Notice does not provide any information to class
members about when the fee motion would be filed or how they could obtain a copy of it.
The Notice states only that Class Counsel intends to request fees "not to exceed 30%" of |
the Settlement Fund. It does not state when, where or how Class Counsel would be
making its request, or inform class members how they can obtain knowledge of the
request. It does not provide the basis for the requested fee award, such as Class
Counsel's reasonable lodestar, or the fee negotiated by Lead Plaintiffs at the
commencement of this case, i.e., the relevant information that would permit class
members to make an informed consideration of the fee request.

Merely filing the Fee Application with the Court, without notice to the class of
when the motion is filed or how it can be accessed, is not "direct[ing notice] to class

members in a reasonable manner." FRCP 23(h)(1).
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 ~~ Filed 07/29/2008 Page 3of 13

The method followed in this case results in the procedural anomaly of requiring
objections to the fee motion to be filed before the motion itself has been filed. This could

not have been the intent of the Court, and objectors presume that the Court approved
that portion of the Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement And Providing For

Notice, which was clearly drafted by the Parties and presented to the Court for signature,
by mistake and without focusing on the absurd and illogical result that flows from it.
IL 30% Of The Settlement Fund Is An Excessive Attorney's Fee.

A 30% fee request in the context of a routine securities fraud case in which the
Defendant issued a restatement and the SEC conducted an investigation is astonishing
and completely out of scale to fee awards in similar cases, at least since the era of fee
moderation was ushered in by the PSLRA and cases like In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES
Litig., 243 F.3d 722 (3d Cir. 2001). The reason for such a large fee request is perhaps
explained by the relative weakness and inadequacy of the two Lead Plaintiffs, both of
whom are individuals who presumably lack the sophistication or motivation to
adequately monitor Lead Counsel.

This Circuit has held that the PSLRA "ig designed to infuse lead plaintiffs with
the responsibility (and motivation) to drive a hard bargain with prospective lead counsel
and to give deference to their stewardship." In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201,
220 (3d Cir. 2001). "[C]ourts should afford a presumption of reasonableness to fee
requests submitted pursuant to an agreement between a properly-selected lead plaintiff

and properly-selected lead counsel." Id.
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 ~~ Filed 07/29/2008 Page4of13

Instead of fulfilling their duties pursuant to the PSLRA, the two lead plaintiffs
here, Tay Siew Choon and Mark Leonov, have acted more like pre-Reform Act lead
plaintiffs who were manipulated by class counsel and could not effectively monitor the
lawyers on behalf of the absent class members.

Lead plaintiffs were often unsophisticated investors who held small
claims, and, according to some reports, they were sometimes paid
"bounties" by lead counsel in exchange for their "services." In such
situations, it was unlikely that the lead plaintiff had undertaken a
meaningful counsel selection process; indeed, it was suspected that lead
counsel generally selected the lead plaintiff rather than vice versa.
Moreover, there was generally little reason to believe that the lead plaintiff
had the incentive or inclination to engage in aggressive bargaining over
lead counsel's fee, or that a typical lead plaintiff could be counted on to
engage in meaningful monitoring of lead counsel's performance.

Id. at 255. One indication of the Lead Plaintiffs' relative weakness vis a vis their counsel
is the fact that they elected to retain three "Co-Lead Counsel" firms, rather than selecting
the least expensive or more efficiently staffed of the three, something that would have
saved the class a great deal of money.
The inherent inefficiency of a Co-Lead Counsel arrangement was noted by the
Third Circuit in In re: Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., 404 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 2005).
In particular, the filing of multiple complaints each alleging the same facts and
legal theories will not result in fee awards for each firm that files a complaint:
such copycat complaints do not benefit the class, and are merely entrepreneurial
efforts taken by firms attempting to secure lead counsel status.
| W]e conclude that representation of individual class members - and, in
particular, monitoring of the progress of the litigation on behalf of those

members - is not compensable out of the class' common recovery. All of
the appellant firms here claim that they monitored the class action, but
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 Filed 07/29/2008 Page 5of13

none can show that this monitoring independently increased the recovery
of the class.

Id, at 181. Having a multitude of firms performing duplicative and redundant work
simply runs up the bill at the expense of the class, leading to a lower net recovery for
class members. The Lead Plaintiffs here should have taken advantage of the fact that
there were three firms vying for the position of lead counsel by holding an auction or
otherwise soliciting the lowest percentage fee bid. It is inconceivable that, had the Lead
Plaintiffs thus fulfilled their duty to the class, the winning bid would have been 30%.

Not only is there no presumption of reasonableness attached to the fee request
submitted by Co-Lead Counsel, there is an inherent presumption of unreasonableness as a
result of the Lead Plaintiffs' complete failure to attempt to obtain the lowest price for the
legal services necessary to pursuing this litigation.

The Second Circuit recently announced the general principle, albeit in a different
context, that "a reasonable, paying client wishes to spend the minimum necessary to
litigate the case effectively," and that "the district court (unfortunately) bears the burden
of disciplining the market, stepping into the shoes of the reasonable, paying client, who
wishes to pay the least amount necessary to litigate the case effectively." Arbor Hill
Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass'n. v. Albany, 493 F.3d 110, 112-118 (2d Cir,
2007). In Arbor Hill (a case on which retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor sat by
designation), the Second Circuit emphasized that this proposition - that a reasonable

paying client wishes to pay the least amount necessary - is true whether the fees are paid
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 Filed 07/29/2008 Page 6of13

by the defendant pursuant to a fee-shifting statute, or by the plaintiff class pursuant to the
common fund doctrine. Minimization of attorney's fees is the goal of every client who
has not been promised a share of the attorney's fees.

This truism - that every reasonable, paying client wishes to pay the least amount
of attorney's fees necessary - clearly did not obtain in this case, presumably because the
two Lead Plaintiffs were too unsophisticated to understand their role under the PSLRA
and how to effectively discharge it. Once they permitted the "Co-Lead Counsel"
arrangement, they opened the door to redundant and duplicative billing that has had the
effect of running up the lodestar and making the outrageous fee of 30% of the fund
appear
"reasonable" under a lodestar cross-check.* Co-Lead Counsel should not benefit from
having clearly taken advantage of their clients at the counsel selection stage, and failing
to inform their clients of their duty to select the least expensive counsel in order to
minimize attorney's fees.

In light of the sorry record in this case, it may be questioned whether individual
investors can ever be "adequate" lead plaintiffs in the post-Reform Act world. They

hardly ever actively bargain over fees with the counsel who selected them to be their

 

* The requested maltiplier of 1.52 appears less reasonable, however,
when one divides $4.22 million by 8200 hours and comes up with an
average hourly rate of $514/hour. That is perhaps a reasonable rate for
a partner, but the average rate presumably represents billing by
numerous associates, paralegals, contract attorneys and support staff,
who should be billed out at rates of $150-$400/hour. If the average
rate ls $514, then either the partner rates are unreasonable, or junior
attorneys and support staff were billed at exorbitant rates.
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 Filed 07/29/2008 Page/7 of 13

ticket into the litigation, and invariably they agree or acquiesce to far higher percentage
fees than those obtained by institutional investors.

Had Objectors Spitalieri and 771 Freedom Street negotiated a fee agreement with
Lead Counsel at the outset of this case, the maximum percentage that they would have
agreed to is 20%, because they would have expected a recovery in excess of $50 million,
and would have expected that that could be achieved for less than $10 million in lodestar.
If Lead Counsel had come to them after settling for $21.5 million and asked for a 50%
fee increase, Objectors would have questioned why such a modest result warranted a fee
increase, rather than a possible decrease.

The purpose of negotiating a fee ex ante at the beginning of a case is to protect
both parties from unanticipated results. [If Lead Counsel had recovered $100 million, for
example, in damages, then their 20% fee agreement would have yielded fees of $20
million, commensurate with an outstanding result. If, as they did here, they recovered
only $21.5 million, they should receive fees of only $4.3 million, essentially their
lodestar. To permit otherwise would sever the interests of Lead Counsel from the
interests of the Class, and permit Lead Counsel to receive a rich fee when the settlement
they achieved is less than a reasonable lead plaintiff would have anticipated at the filing
of this case. If Lead Counsel is permitted to recommend to its clients a settlement that is

only a fraction of what the clients anticipated at the time they entered into the fee

 

? Indeed, Lead Counsel have offered no evidence that the Lead Plaintiffs
ever approved or negotiated the requested fee of 30%, or that Lead
Plaintiffs are even aware of the amount of the fee that has been
requested.
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 Filed 07/29/2008 Page 8of 13

agreement, but at the same time demand a fee percentage that is more than what was
thought reasonable at the time the case was filed, thus preserving Lead Counsel's
expected recovery at the expense of the class', the entire purpose of the Reform Act's
requirement that fee agreements be negotiated ex ante is thwarted.

Co-Lead Counsel should receive no more than $4.3 million in fees, or 20% of the
Settlement Fund, the amount that would have been a reasonable percentage fee at the
inception of this case, and the one that an institutional investor would undoubtedly have
negotiated,

Because (1) an adequate, sophisticated, institutional shareholder would have
negotiated a contingent attorney's fee of no greater than 20% at the inception of this case,
based upon projected damages, Veritas' restatement, and the SEC investigation, as well
as average percentage fees negotiated in other PSLRA cases since 2001; and (2) the
Court may not overrule a fee agreement negotiated by an adequate lead plaintiff and
impose upon the class a fee that is greater than one the lead plaintiffs have agreed to, see
In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201 (3d Cir. 2001), this Court should defer to the
hypothetical fee agreement that an adequate lead plaintiff would have negotiated at the
beginning of this litigation, and award a fee of no more than 20%. To do otherwise
would penalize the class for Lead Plaintiffs' inadequacy.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should require supplemental notice to the

Class before ruling on Class Counsel's Fee Application, give Class Members a
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document138 Filed 07/29/2008 Page Qof13

reasonable opportunity to respond to Class Counsel's Fee Application pursuant to Rule

23(h)(2), and award Class Counsel a reasonable attorney's fee of no more than 20% of the

settlement fund
