I. INTRODUCTION
In direct violation of this Court's order with regard to timing and foundation, and without the

slightest factual or legal basis to do so, professional objectors' counsel, Edward Cochran
("Cochran") and John Pentz ("Pentz"), appear on the eve of the final fairness hearing objecting to a
fee request for the sole purpose of extracting a fee for themselves. See Objection to Motion for
Attorney's Fees (the "Objection") (D.I. 138). Individually and together, these two objectors' counsel
have made a career out of such eleventh hour tactics in dozens of class actions.' Recently, in one
such matter where the two appeared, Judge Marbley of the Southern District of Ohio noted that:

class actions also attract those in the legal profession who subsist

primarily off of the skill and labor of, to say nothing of the risk borne

by, more capable attorneys. These are the opportunistic objectors.

Although they contribute nothing to the class, they object to the

Settlement, thereby obstructing payment to lead counsel or the class

in the hope that lead plaintiff will pay them to go away.

Unfortunately, the class-action kingdom has seen a Malthusian

explosion of the opportunistic objectors, which now seem to
accompany every major securities litigation.

include: In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38386 (S.D. Ohio May 5,

In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38386, at *9-10 (S.D. Ohio May 5,
2008) (emphasis added). Nonetheless, because the objection was filed late in contravention of the
Court-ordered requirements of the notice, and because it is otherwise substantively defective in that
it neither provides proof of the objectors' standing nor follows the proper notice of intention to
appear procedures, it must be stricken.

Even assuming the objection was not untimely and defective, Cochran and Pentz's objection
would still merit scant attention because it manifests a supreme ignorance of the facts of the case, a
misinterpretation of the relevant law, and because it stands alone as the only objection having been
filed after the dissemination of nearly 221,000 Notices of Pendency. Moreover, calling the co-lead
plaintiffs weak, unsophisticated, and ineffective, not only demonstrates the objectors' obliviousness
to the record but could not be further from reality. Lead Plaintiffs Tay Siew Choon ("Tay") and
Mark Leonov ("Leonov'") are both very sophisticated and successful investors in their own right who
took their role as lead plaintiffs quite seriously. Indeed, the two spent hundreds of hours of their own
time deeply involved in the litigation from its inception through the mediation and settlement
process. Their respective declarations attest to their exemplary efforts in this regard.

Cochran and Pentz claim that if their clients were lead plaintiffs, they would have litigated
the matter differently and negotiated a better deal up front. (Objection at 7). This begs the question of
where those clients were at the onset of the litigation. There was ample notice of the actions and
deadlines for lead plaintiff motions. Indeed, at least a dozen firms published news releases around
that time." However, neither Cochran nor Pentz, nor their clients Spitalieri and 771 Freedom Street,

stepped forward to represent the class' interests; Tay and Leonov, and a number of other lead

 

Many of the past PSLRA-mandated press releases can still be obtained through a simple

movants, did. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth herein, the objection should be stricken

and/or overruled.

I. THE COCHRAN/PENTZ OBJECTION SHOULD BE STRICKEN
AS UNTIMELY AND DEFECTIVE

A. Objection is Untimely

This Court directed that any objections to the settlement or fee application were to be filed on
or before June 30, 2008. The Notice of Pendency (``Notice''), which advises class members of the
fee and expense application and the amount thereof, states unequivocally the deadline for filing such
objections. See Notice at 14. The objectors here, by their own admission, willfully ignored the
directive of the Court and as such their objection should be stricken.

Contrary to what the objectors argue, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) specifically states a fee
application is heard "`at a time the court sets" and that "[n]otice of the motion must be served on all
parties" with notice directed to "class members in a reasonable manner." Here, the details of the fee
application, including the maximum amount sought, were contained in the Notice disseminated to
the Class. The formal motion, directed to the parties in the litigation, which accompanied the papers
in support of the fee application was not required to be served on individual absent class members
and as such objectors' reliance on Local Rule 7.1.2 (b) is misplaced. Further, contrary to the
representations of the objectors, there is no requirement in Rule 23(h) that requires notification of
"when the motion is filed or how it can be accessed" and no authority is provided for such
proposition. (Objection at 2). Accordingly, the objection is defective.

B. Objectors Failed to Provide Proof of Membership in the Class

Additionally, the Notice clearly states that anyone objecting to any aspect of the settlement,

 

internet search.

 
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document 139 _~ Filed 07/30/2008 Page5of8

including the request for attorneys' fees and expenses, must provide "proof of membership in the
Class including the type of Veritas securities and amount you held on April 23, 2003 and the type of
Veritas securities and amount you purchased or acquired and sold between April 23, 2003 and July 6,
2004." See Notice at p. 14. Here, the objectors provide no proof that they are actual Class Members
with standing to challenge any aspect of the settlement or fee and expense request. Accordingly, the
objection is defective.

C. Objectors Failed to Provide Notice of Intent to Appear

The objectors state that they will present their objection to the Court at the final approval
hearing on July 31, 2008. However, the Notice specifically instructs that any class member intending
to appear at the hearing for the purpose of objecting must mail or deliver their "notice of intention to
appear ... such that it is received no later than June 30, 2008." See Notice at 15. Again, the
objectors failed to comply with this mandate and, as such, the Objection is defective.

TI. COCHRAN/PENTZ OBJECTION SHOULD BE OVERRULLED
AS LEGALLY AND FACTUALLY FLAWED

The uniformly positive reaction of the Class to the Fee Application is the strongest evidence
that the request is fair and reasonable. See, e.g., In re Ravisent Techs., Inc. Sec. Litig., 2005 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 6680, at *39-40 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 19, 2005); In re Cell Pathways, Inc. Sec. Litig. IT, 2002
USS. Dist. LEXIS 18359, at *24 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 23, 2002); In re Rent-Way Sec. Litig., 305 F. Supp.2d
491, 502 (W.D. Pa. 2003); Jn re Aetna Inc. Sec. Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, at *48 (E.D. Pa.
Jan. 4, 2001); In re Charter Commc'ns, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14772, at *59 (E.D.
Mo. Jun. 30, 2005); In re Xcel Energy, Inc. Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 364 F. Supp.2d 980, 996
(D. Minn. 2005). The number and quality of the objections enables a court to gauge the reaction of a

class to a request for an award of attorneys' fees. In re Xcel, 364 F. Supp.2d at 996, 998. Here,

4

 

 
Case 1:04-cv-00831-SLR Document 139 Filed 07/30/2008 Page6eof8

nearly 221,000 Notices were disseminated, fully describing the settlement and the anticipated fee
request, and there was not a single objection filed within the deadline to do so -- and only the late-
filed Cochran/Pentz objection thereafter. For this reason alone, the objection should be overruled as
it belies the overwhelming will of the Class. See, e.g., Datatec Sys., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87428,
at *9 (D.N.J. Nov. 28, 2007) (lack of objections from the class members "weighs strongly in favor"
of approval of the settlement); see also In re Elec. Carbon Prods. Antitrust Litig., 447 F. Supp.2d
389, 399 (D.N.J. 2006)(same).

Without any legal authority to support the argument, Cochran/Pentz assert that a 30% fee is
excessive and that Plaintiffs' counsel should be limited to their lodestar. (Objection at 7). However,
this is not the law of the Third Circuit where the percentage of recovery method is the preferred
approach for determining attorneys' fee awards in common fund cases. See In re Warfarin Sodium ,
212 F.R.D. at 261; In re GMC Pick-up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 821 (3d
Cir. 1995); In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 256 (Gd Cir. 2001). Even if the Court were to
undertake a lodestar cross-check, the multiplier of approximately 1.52 is exceedingly reasonable and
falls near the bottom or below the range of multipliers typically awarded in comparable cases.

The main argument put forth by Cochran/Pentz is that the Lead Plaintiffs Tay and Leonov are
unsophisticated and uninvolved individuals who did not properly monitor the litigation or counsel.
(Objection 4-8). This absurd argument, based entirely on conjecture, could not be further from the
truth. As detailed in Plaintiffs' Fee Application and their respective declarations, Messrs Tay and
Leonov were intimately involved throughout the litigation and gave extraordinary efforts in that

regard, dedicating hundreds of hours over four years. Unlike the objectors, Messrs Tay and Mr.

Leonov stepped forward to protect the interests of the class at the beginning and remain involved and

engaged to this day. For Cochran/Pentz to sit on the sidelines and then unfairly and unfoundedly

disparage these Lead Plaintiffs, for the sole purpose of delaying payment to the Class and extracting

a fee for themselves, is reprehensible.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Cochran/Pentz objection should be stricken and/or overruled.
