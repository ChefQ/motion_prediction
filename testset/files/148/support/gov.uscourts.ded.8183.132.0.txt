HARWOOD FEFFER LLP

FIRM DESCRIPTION

The law firm of Harwood Feffer LLP ("Harwood Feffer" or the "Firm")
specializes in complex, multi-party litigation with an emphasis on securities class
actions, shareholder derivative and ERISA litigation. The Firm also handles more
general complex commercial litigation involving allegations of breach of contract,
breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and negligence, as well as titigation involving
consumer fraud, anti-competitive conduct, and other commercial claims.

Harwood Feffer is dedicated to prosecuting socially useful actions in the
most efficient manner and with the highest level of professional competence. The
structure of the Firm allows us a far greater degree of independence, flexibility,
and satisfaction than a large firm environment, without sacrificing the quality of
representation necessary to successfully litigate complex actions throughout the
country. The Firm maintains an excellent reputation -- among both the plaintiffs'
and defense bars. Our adversaries and co-counsel know that we take a case to
trial, if necessary, to achieve a satisfactory result for our clients.

Harwood Feffer has been acknowledged by courts and by its peers to be one
of the leaders in the plaintiffs' shareholder advocacy bar. In this regard, we have
developed new law in the areas of tender offers, fiduciary duty of corporate
insiders to public shareholders in mergers and takeovers, and general principles
of required disclosure to shareholders and institutional investors in public
companies.

As aresult, the Firm has been designated as lead, co-lead or special counsel
in numerous complex cases and other actions involving shareholder rights and
corporate governance. In the vast majority of such actions, the Firm's skill and

expertise has led to the recovery of substantial monetary and equitable benefits
for investors, stockholders, corporations, and partnerships. By way of example,
the following litigated actions, in which the Firm served in a leadership capacity,
were all brought to highly successful conclusions: 1) In re First Capital Holdings
Corporation Financial Products Securities Litigation, MDL 901 (C.D.Cal.)
(restoration of over $1 billion in insurance policies and benefits); 2) In re Royal
Dutch/Shell Transport ERISA Litigation, (D.N.J.) (creation of settlement fund of $90
million plus implementation of structural relief); 3) In re Prudential Bache Energy
income Partnerships Securities Litigation, MDL 880 (E.D.La.) (creation of settlement
fund in excess of $90 million); 4) In re }WP Inc. Securities Litigation, (S.D.N.Y.)
(creation of settlement fund in excess of $37 million); 5) Morse v. McWhorter,
(M.D. Tenn.)(creation of a settlement fund of $49.5 million on behalf of investors
in Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.); 6) In re BankOne Securities Litigation, (N.D.
Ill.) (creation of a $45 million settlement fund); and 7) Sidney Morse, et al. v.
Abbott Laboratories, et al., (N.D. Ill.) (creation of a $14.1 million settlement fund
following a jury verdict for plaintiffs).

Courts have often recognized the Firm's skill in class actions. For example,
in In re Electro-Catheter Securities Litigation, Judge Nicholas Politan of the District
of New Jersey stated:

[Clounsel in this case are highly competent, very skilled
in this very specialized area and were at all times during
the course of the litigation that | participated in, which
was perhaps the major part of the Court litigation here,
always well prepared, well spoken, and knew their stuff
and they are a credit to their profession. They are the
top of the line.

ERISA Litigation, (D.N.J.), Judge Bissell stated:

the Court knows the attorneys in the firms involved in
this matter and they are highly experienced and highly
skilled in matters of this kind. Moreover, in this case it
showed. Those efforts were vigorous, imaginative and
prompt in reaching the settlement of this matter with a
minimal amount of discovery .... So both skill and
efficiency were brought to the table here by counsel, no
doubt about that.

Likewise, Judge Hurley stated in connection with In re Olsten Corporation
Securities Litigation, 97 CV-5056 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2001), wherein a settlement

been excellent." Mr. Harwood was tead attorney in Meritt v. Eckerd, 86 Civ. 1222
(E.D.N.Y. May 30, 1986), where then Chief Judge Weinstein observed that counsel

value "in the order of $20 Million Dollars." Mr. Harwood prosecuted the Hoeniger
v. Aylsworth class action litigation in the United States District Court for the

bore very significant fruit in the face of serious questions as to ultimate success
on the merits."

Mr. Harwood recently served as lead counsel in Morse v. McWhorter,
(Columbia/HCA Healthcare Securities Litigation) (M.D. Tenn.), in which a settlement
fund of $49.5 million was created for the benefit of the Class, as well as In re Bank
