RESUME OF
ROSENTHAL, MONHAIT & GODDESS, P.A.

Rosenthal, Monhait & Goddess, P.A. devotes a substantial portion of its practice to
commercial and corporate litigation, particularly the representation of stockholders in derivative and
class actions, primarily in Delaware courts. [Illustrative of the cases in which the firm has
participated are the following:

(1) In the Matter of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., 945 A.2d 1123 (Del.
2008). The firm was Delaware counsel to minority shareholders of a securities exchange who
challenged investment transactions as unfairly dilutive of their interests. Shortly before trial, the
parties agreed on a settlement valued at more than $90 million. The Court of Chancery approved
the settlement, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed.

(2) In re UnitedGlobalcom Inc. Shareholders Litigation, Del. Ch., C.A. No.
1012-VCS (2008). The firm participated in the representation of former shareholders of United
Globalcom Inc. who challenged the fairness of consideration they received in a merger orchestrated
by UGC's controlling shareholder. After extensive litigation, the parties agreed to a settlement,
approved by the Court of Chancery, which produced a $25 million cash fund for distribution to the
former shareholders.

(3) Wilmington Trust Company v. Tropicana Entertainment, LLC, et al., Del. Ch.,
C.A. No. 3502-VCN (2008). The firm served as Delaware counsel to Wilmington Trust Company,

motions for partial summary judgment, the Court awarded partial summary judgment in favor of the

Indenture Trustee as to certain issues regarding an event of default under the Indenture.

defendants' motions for summary judgment, completion of merits and expert discovery and almost
all pre-trial preparation, the parties reached an agreement to settle the action for an all cash payment
of $52 million, which, after the payment of attorneys' fees and expenses, was distributed to the
holders of TCI's A shares unaffiliated with defendants.

(5) Miron v. Microsoft Corporation, Del. Ch., C.A. No. 1149-CC. The firm
substituted for initial counsel in the prosecution of claims brought on behalf of former senior
executives and employees of a software company concerning treatment of their stock options after
a change in company ownership and management. After reconceiving the theory of the case and
filing a brief in opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, the firm and plaintiffs
participated in a mediation which produced a confidential settlement.

(6) Craig Davis v. Parris H. Holmes, Jr., et al. and New Century Equity Holding,
Corp., Del. Ch., C.A. No. 638-N (2006). The firm was Delaware counsel to shareholders who
brought an action alleging derivative claims of mismanagement and waste, and seeking the
appointment of a custodian. After substantial litigation and mediation, the parties reached (and the
Court approved) a settlement resulting in the creation of a settlement fund of $3,200,000, which,
after payment of plaintiffs' counsel's fees and expenses, was distributed to the company's common
stockholders as a dividend. The settlement also provided the company and its stockholders with

additional benefits, including the elimination of certain monetary obligations of the company.
