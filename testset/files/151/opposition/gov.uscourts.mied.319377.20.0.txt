STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED
Whether the Court should dismiss as misjoined certain claims and parties in
this one consolidated lawsuit to be refiled as nine actions in nine separate districts
across the country, or, in the alternative, transfer those claims and parties to proceed
as nine separate lawsuits, purportedly for the convenience of the parties and
witnesses. The Valero Companies’ claims present common issues of fact and law
and arise from the same series of transactions and occurrences, thereby satisfying
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20 (permissive joinder). In addition, significant
judicial efficiencies and convenience to the courts and the parties are preserved by
proceeding with this case, as filed, in a single trial in the Valero Companies’ properly
chosen venue.
The Valero Companies’ Answer: No, this Court should not dismiss or transfer
the claims or parties

INTRODUCTION
The Valero Companies, six wholly-owned subsidiaries of Valero Energy
Corporation, filed this lawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the
Government incurred CERCLA liability as an operator of 12 refinery sites during
World War II. In its Motion, the Government moves to dismiss as misjoined all
Plaintiffs other than MRP Properties Company, LLC, and all claims asserted by
Plaintiffs relating to sites located outside of Michigan, to be refiled as nine separate
actions across the country. In the alternative, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404, the
Government moves to sever all claims relating to sites located outside of Michigan
and transfer the claims to eight other districts, again dividing this single litigation
into nine separate actions, purportedly for judicial economy and the convenience of
the parties and witnesses.
The Government’s Motion must be denied for two reasons. First, Plaintiffs
are appropriately joined pursuant to Rule 20 (permissive joinder). The Valero
Companies assert, among other common allegations, a common theory of CERCLA
liability arising from the Government’s national policy of control over the entire
refining industry during World War II. The Government incurred liability because
it subjected each of the refineries to the same national plan and policies of control as
executed by the Petroleum Administration for War (“PAW”). Moreover, each site
presents common issues of fact relating to Government control and involvement at

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 12 of 36

Pg ID 171

the refineries and common issues of law relating to the proper standard for the
Government’s liability as an operator of the refineries. Second, the Government
does not, and cannot, meet its heavy burden for severance and transfer under § 1404.
Maintaining a single action is clearly more efficient and convenient for the parties,
particularly in this expert-driven, historical contamination case. Severance would
create significant repetition and inefficiencies, waste party and court resources, and
prejudice the Valero Companies. As such, the Motion must be denied.
BACKGROUND
In its Motion, the Government fundamentally misconstrues the facts and
allegations in the First Amended Complaint by stating:
The allegations in the First Amended Complaint have one common
theme: that immediately prior to and during World War II, the United
States operated or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at the
twelve refineries, and therefore is responsible for a portion of the
cleanup costs incurred at these sites. This theory is where the
commonalities end.
ECF No. 13 at 1-2.
In fact, this is where the commonalities begin. The Valero Companies are
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation. See ECF No. 5. The
Valero Companies’ claims are brought against a single defendant, the Government,
a common operator of all the refineries, and arise from the Government’s stated
national policy of control over the refineries.
Administrator of PAW during World War II, stated:

The demands for refined products under today’s conditions—demands
which are on the must list—so disrupt normal operation, and
transportation shortages so complicate movement, that it is clearly
impossible to go along without scheduling from a central source the
operating practice of each refinery. . . . Such a thing as a completely
free economy is no longer possible, for obvious reasons. Refinery
operation must be geared to production, transportation, and wardemand programs, and be guided from Washington.
Exhibit A at p. 39. The Government’s national policy of control arose pursuant to
the same statutory authority. See ECF No. 4 at ¶¶12-20. And the Government
exercised its control over the Valero Companies’ refineries in a common, core
manner, “by controlling and directing the following, inter alia, at the refinery level:
(i) the allocation—by type and amount—of crude oil and other feed stocks, without
which a refinery could not run; (ii) the procurement priorities to obtain services,
equipment and parts required to keep refineries operating; (iii) the types and
specifications of the war-related products to be manufactured; (iv) the levels of
production for each of those products; (v) the price of the products and the profits
made; and (vi) to whom the products would be sold within the Governmentcontrolled supply chain.” ECF No. 4 at ¶ 22.
Although some elements of the case are indeed site-specific, such as sitespecific cleanup costs and certain specific instances of additional control over a
refinery, the Valero Companies will address these limited issues with common
company representatives and experts across all the refineries. Because the lawsuit
involves contamination stemming from World War II operations, the case will
3

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 14 of 36

Pg ID 173

inherently be expert-intensive and common experts will be retained for all 12 sites.
See Exhibit B, Gravel Affidavit. The Valero Companies also have some common
officers who will likely testify in this case. See Exhibit C, George Affidavit.
The Valero Companies properly joined in bringing this single lawsuit in the
Eastern District of Michigan because it makes good sense to do so. Litigating nine
fundamentally similar lawsuits in nine separate districts across the country, as the
Government asks this Court to do, unnecessarily increases the costs of pursuing
common claims by creating repetition and inefficiency for the courts and the parties.
Thus, the Motion must be denied.
ARGUMENT
I.

Joinder Is Appropriate Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20.
While the Government accurately recites the general rules of permissive

joinder under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20 (“Rule 20”), it conveniently
ignores the purposes of Rule 20 and the strong judicial preference to join, rather than
sever, claims and parties.
“Under the Rules, the impulse is toward entertaining the broadest possible
scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties; joinder of claims, parties and
remedies is strongly encouraged.” United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S.
715, 724 (1966). “‘The purpose of [Rule 20] is to promote trial convenience and
expedite the final determination of disputes, thereby preventing multiple lawsuits.
4

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 15 of 36

Pg ID 174

Single trials generally tend to lessen the delay, expense and inconvenience to all
concerned.’” Patrick Collins, Inc. v. John Does 1-21, 282 F.R.D. 161, 166 (E.D.
Mich. 2012) (quoting Mosley v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.2d 1330, 1332 (8th Cir.
1974)). “The permissive joinder rule is to be construed liberally in order to promote
trial convenience and to prevent multiple disputes.” Patrick Collins, Inc. v. John
Does 1-21, 286 F.R.D. 319, 321 (E.D. Mich. 2012) (citation omitted).
Here, the Valero Companies allege, among other common facts and legal
theories, that the Government incurred CERCLA liability when it operated the
Valero Companies’ refineries as part of a systematic national policy of wartime
refinery industry control. ECF No. 4 at ¶¶ 21-28. Taken as true, as the Court must
do at this stage, the Valero Companies clearly satisfy the requirements of Rule 20,
particularly given the strong judicial preference for joinder outlined above.
A.

Plaintiffs’ Claims Arise Out of the Same Series of Transactions and
Occurrences.

The Valero Companies are properly joined under Rule 20(a)(1)(A) because
their claims arise out of the same series of transactions and occurrences. In this
District,
Transaction is a word of flexible meaning. It may comprehend a series
of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness
of their connection as upon their logical relationship.[] Therefore, Rule
20 would permit all reasonably related claims for relief by or against
different parties to be tried in a single proceeding.

5

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 16 of 36

Pg ID 175

Patrick Collins, Inc., 282 F.R.D. at 167 (citations omitted). Whether litigation arises
from the same transactions or occurrences depends on the factual background of a
claim. Proctor v. Applegate, 661 F.Supp.2d 743, 779 (E.D. Mich. 2009).
The underlying facts of this case, and the series of transactions giving rise to
the Valero Companies’ claims, are common across all the refineries. The Valero
Companies allege that the Government developed a highly coordinated national
policy of control over the entire refining industry to meet wartime production needs
and shortages. ECF No. 4 at ¶¶ 12-20. The Government executed that national
policy by authorizing PAW to operate each of the refineries. Id. PAW carried out
its broad authority by controlling and directing virtually every aspect of the
refineries’ operations. Id. at ¶¶ 21-28.
The Government’s own case law demonstrates joinder is appropriate in this
case. The Government relies on two cases in arguing for misjoinder under Rule 20:
Proctor v. Applegate, 661 F.Supp.2d 743 (E.D. Mich. 2009) and Coughlin v. Rogers,
130 F.3d 1348, 1350 (9th Cir. 1997). The Government cites both cases for the
proposition that plaintiffs who “allege that a defendant ‘subjected them to the same
or similar treatment’” are nevertheless misjoined “where the details of and reasons
for the alleged treatment vary from plaintiff to plaintiff.” ECF No. 13 at 6.
Proctor does not support the Government’s position. It involved the joinder
of five individual prisoners with claims against more than 40 different defendants
6

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 17 of 36

Pg ID 176

across multiple unrelated prisons in a civil rights case. There, the court relied on
another case noting “the pervasive impracticalities associated with multiple-plaintiff
prisoner litigation, which militates against permissive joinder even if it were
otherwise allowed by Rule 20(a).” Proctor, 661 F.Supp.2d at 780 (citing Boretsky
v. Corzine, 2008 WL 2512916, *4 (D.N.J. 2008)). “[P]risoners are ‘not in the same
situation as other non-prisoner joint plaintiffs; prisoners’ circumstances make joint
litigation exceptionally difficult.’” Id. (quoting Boretsky, 2008 WL 2512916 at *6).
The court further noted the prisoner-specific legislative requirement for the
exhaustion of administrative remedies in finding joinder was inappropriate. Id.
(citation omitted). Unlike Proctor, this case involves the permissive joinder of
refining companies that share a common parent, subject to the normal, liberal
applications of Rule 20.
Coughlin is equally distinguishable. In Coughlin, 49 plaintiffs made “the
mere allegation of general delay,” which the court found was “not enough to create
a common transaction or occurrence.” 130 F.3d at 1350. In the next paragraph,
which the Government ignores, the court stated:
Plaintiffs do not allege that their claims arise out of a systematic pattern
of events and, therefore, arise from the same transaction or occurrence.
Plaintiffs do not allege a pattern or policy of delay in dealing with all
applications and/or petitions by the INS. Rather, Plaintiffs merely
claim that, in specified instances, applications and petitions have not
been addressed in a timely manner. . . . Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims are not
sufficiently related to constitute the same transaction or occurrence.
7

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 18 of 36

Pg ID 177

Id. (citation omitted). Unlike the plaintiffs in Coughlin, the Valero Companies
allege that the Government incurred liability at each of the refineries precisely
because there was a systematic, nationwide plan and policy of refinery control
during the relevant wartime period. ECF No. 4 at ¶¶ 12-28. In other words, the
Valero Companies allege the precise standard Coughlin articulates supports joinder
under Rule 20.
The Supreme Court and other courts have also held that claims arising from
state-wide and company-wide policies are all considered to arise out of the same
transaction or occurrence. See, e.g., United States v. Mississippi, 380 U.S. 128, 14243 (1965) (holding that joinder of registrars who denied African-Americans the right
to vote was proper because the complaint charged that they were doing so as part of
a state-wide policy); Mosley v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.2d 1330, 1333-34 (8th Cir.
1974) (reversing district court and holding that claims arising from a company-wide
policy designed to discriminate against individuals arises out of the same transaction
or occurrence); Hohlbein v. Heritage Mut. Ins. Co., 106 F.R.D. 73, 78-79 (E.D. Wis.
1985) (holding that four plaintiffs could join in one action against a former employer
because the claim was based on a company-wide policy). Thus, claims arising from
actions undertaken pursuant to a policy are considered to be of the same transaction
or occurrence. Therefore, the Valero Companies’ claims arise out of the same
transaction and occurrence, satisfying the first prong under Rule 20.

Pg ID 178

Plaintiffs’ Claims Present Common Questions of Law and Fact.

The Valero Companies are properly joined under Rule 20(a)(1)(B) because
their claims present common questions of law and fact.

FED. R. CIV. PROC.

20(a)(1)(B) (joinder is appropriate when “any question of law or fact common to all
plaintiffs will arise in the action”) (emphasis added). In its Motion, the Government
attempts to limit the commonalities among the Valero Companies’ claims and
allegations to “the basic common fact that all of the refineries sold petroleum
products to the United States during World War II . . . .” ECF No. 13 at 10. The
Government’s reading of the First Amended Complaint is more than a bit narrow.
In fact, the First Amended Complaint is replete with numerous common issues
of fact that this Court will need to evaluate. The Valero Companies, all whollyowned subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, brought claims against a single
defendant, the Government.

The Valero Companies’ claims arise from the

Government’s express national policy of control over the refineries during World
War II, which was executed by PAW pursuant to the same statutory authority. See
ECF No. 4 at ¶¶ 12-20. PAW exercised its control over the Valero Companies’
refineries in a common, core manner, by controlling and directing, among other
things, what was produced, how much was produced, to whom products were sold
and at what price. Id. at ¶ 22. In doing so, the Government’s control of the Valero
Companies’ refineries was pervasive and absolute. Id. at ¶ 23 (“Perhaps the only
9

Pg ID 179

thing the Government did not do was to manually turn the levers and valves at the
refineries.”). While the Government’s national policy, and its execution of that
policy, impacted all of the refineries in the same manner, even the more specific
allegations raised in the First Amended Complaint have significant overlap. For
example, the same wartime product restrictions on motor gasoline production that
significantly limited refinery profits and product runs applied to all of the refineries.
Id. at ¶¶ 33, 41, 48, 72, 87, 116 and 122. Ultimately, the First Amended Complaint
alleges that the Government is liable as an operator under CERCLA through
substantially the same set of facts at each of the refineries.
Additionally, as the Government reluctantly acknowledges, common issues
of law will also arise in this litigation. See ECF No. 13 at 9, 24 (discussing CERCLA
and “an overlapping legal theory”). For example, the Court will need to apply the
appropriate legal standard for CERCLA operator liability to the Government’s
control of the refineries. See United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51 (1998); United
States v. Township of Brighton, 153 F.3d 307, 316 (6th Cir. 1998) (“[M]ere
regulation does not suffice to render a government entity liable, but actual operation
(or ‘macromanagement’) does.”). Simply stated, this is a CERCLA case,1 and the
Court will need to apply federal CERCLA law to the claims in this case.

The Government argues that this case, as filed, is “unwieldy” or “unmanageable.”
ECF No. 13 at 14. The Government deliberately exaggerates the complexity of this
CERCLA litigation. It is not uncommon for CERCLA litigation to include far more
1

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 21 of 36

Pg ID 180

In its Motion, the Government goes to great lengths to point out the subtle
differences among the Plaintiffs and their refineries, while ignoring the obvious
commonalities set forth in the First Amended Complaint.

For example, the

Government states that “each refinery is alleged to have produced a different
assortment of petroleum products[,]” ECF No. 13 at 8, but ignores that the
Government required the production of such products and mandated even the minute
details of their production at each refinery. In other words, the differences raised by
the Government are the result of the refineries following the Government’s own
mandates issued pursuant to one coordinated national plan.
More importantly, the distinctions raised by the Government do not render
joinder improper. Not all claims in the First Amended Complaint must satisfy Rule
20, as joinder is appropriate if “at least one claim . . . arises out of the same
transaction or occurrence and presents questions of law or fact common to all[.]”
Green v. Callahan, No. 2:14–CV–11453, 2014 WL 1652335, *2 (E.D. Mich. April
23, 2014) (citing Proctor, 661 F.Supp.2d at 778); FED. R. CIV. PROC. 20(a)(1)(B)
(joinder is appropriate when “any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs

parties and a far broader scope than the current action. Moreover, in this case, the
Valero Companies pursue only the portion of costs attributable to the Government’s
operation of the refineries during the relevant time period, i.e., the Government’s
fair share. Accordingly, the Government’s concern with other hypothetical
potentially responsible parties, to the extent they might exist, is irrelevant to the issue
of joinder at the outset of this litigation.
11

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 22 of 36

Pg ID 181

will arise in the action”) (emphasis added).2 Accordingly, the Valero Companies
and their claims are appropriately joined in this case under Rule 20.
C.

Dismissal of Plaintiffs and Claims Is Inappropriate.

Dismissal of certain Plaintiffs and claims is not appropriate in this case simply
because the permissive joinder standard of Rule 20 has been satisfied. Even if the
requirements of Rule 20 were not satisfied, dismissal of Plaintiffs and claims relating
to sites not based in Michigan would be inappropriate because dismissal would result
in actual harm to the Valero Companies.
The Government notes that courts may drop misjoined parties from a litigation
if it is “without ‘gratuitous harm to the parties,’ such as where the dismissed parties
‘lose the ability to prosecute an otherwise timely claim’ or where dismissal is with
prejudice.” ECF No. 13 at 13 (citation omitted). Then, the Government downplays
the impact dismissal would have on the Valero Companies, arguing that “[n]othing
in the Amended Complaint suggests that the statute of limitations will have run since
the filing of the initial complaint on any of Plaintiffs’ claims if the misjoined
plaintiffs and their claims are dismissed and those plaintiffs are required to file
elsewhere.” ECF No. 13 at 13-14.

For example, the Government erroneously suggests allegations of ownership
liability at one site, the Houston Refinery, in addition to allegations of operator
control, are relevant to the issue of permissive joinder. ECF No. 13 at 9.
2

12

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 23 of 36

Pg ID 182

In making this argument, the Government ignores the series of tolling
agreements that it entered into with certain of the Valero Companies in April 2016.
The tolling agreements expired in April 2017, just days after this case was filed.
Accordingly, if the Court grants the Government’s requested relief, the Valero
Companies could become exposed to new statute of limitations issues potentially
rendering otherwise timely claims untimely. In other words, if dismissed, the Valero
Companies could potentially lose months of statute-of-limitations protections.
Clearly, the protections of the tolling agreements are of value to the Valero
Companies, even if the Government does not agree.
II.

Transfer Is Inefficient and a Waste of Party and Judicial Resources.
In the alternative, the Government moves to sever and transfer the Valero

Companies’ claims relating to refineries located outside Michigan under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1404(a). In articulating a standard for transfer, the Government fails to mention
its heavy burden as the moving party. “The burden is on the moving party to
establish the need for a change of forum.” Sullivan v. Tribley, 602 F.Supp.2d 795,
799 (E.D. Mich. 2009) (citation omitted). “This burden is a heavy one and requires
the moving party to show that the balance of factors weighs strongly in favor of
transfer.” Steelcase, Inc. v. Smart Technologies, Inc., 336 F.Supp.2d 714, 719 (W.D.
Mich. 2004) (citation omitted). Accordingly, the Government must show “by a
preponderance of the evidence, that fairness and practicality strongly favor
13

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 24 of 36

Pg ID 183

transfer[.]” See Performance Contracting, Inc. v. DynaSteel Corp., No. 12-10165,
2012 WL 1666394, *1 (E.D. Mich. May 9, 2012).
“In deciding a motion to transfer venue, the Court must determine whether the
action could have been brought in the proposed transferee district, whether a transfer
would promote the interests of justice, and whether a transfer would serve the
parties’ and witnesses’ convenience.” Performance Contracting, 2012 WL 1666394
at *3.3 “Factors to be considered include: (1) the convenience of witnesses; (2) the
location of relevant documents and relative ease of access to sources of proof; (3)
the convenience of the parties; (4) the locus of the operative facts; (5) the availability
of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses; (6) the relative means
of the parties; (7) the forum’s familiarity with the governing law; (8) the weight
accorded the plaintiff’s choice of forum; and (9) trial efficiency and the interests of
justice, based on the totality of the circumstances.” Id. (citations omitted). “To
establish these factors, parties should support their assertions with citations to the
record; conclusory allegations of a party will not suffice.” Thomas v. Home Depot,
U.S.A., Inc., 131 F.Supp.2d 934, 937 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (citation omitted).

Due to the broad venue provision of CERCLA, it is true that this case could have
been brought in other districts, but the Eastern District of Michigan makes the most
sense. The most sites of the 12 Valero Companies’ refineries are located in Michigan
and joinder serves judicial economy by avoiding repetition while keeping the
litigation together in the district where the most sites are located.
3

14

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 25 of 36

Pg ID 184

In its Motion, the Government makes only conclusory and vague assertions
that do not, and cannot, satisfy its heavy burden to show that the balance of these
factors “weighs strongly in favor of transfer.” In fact, dividing this action into nine
separate cases would significantly complicate the litigation as a whole and
substantially raise costs for both parties due to repetition and inefficiency, regardless
of where the actions are refiled. In this expert-intensive historical contamination
case, the Valero Companies’ common experts will need to issue duplicative reports,
give duplicative depositions, and travel to multiple districts to give, at least in part,
identical testimony in nine separate actions. Exhibit B, Gravel Affidavit, at ¶ 9. In
addition, the Valero Companies share officers with knowledge of corporate history
and remediation work that would be duplicative in multiple districts. Exhibit C,
George Affidavit, at ¶¶ 3-6. Discovery and motions practice will almost certainly
be duplicative and wasteful, particularly at the outset of proceedings. Separate
litigation will tie up nine courts in nine districts, which cannot be a superior method
to proceeding with one focused litigation effort in the district where the most sites
in the First Amended Complaint are located.
A.

The Convenience of Witnesses Weighs Against Transfer.

“A party seeking to transfer a case should specify the key witnesses and the
nature of their testimony.” Performance Contracting, 2012 WL 1666394 at *4.
“Only when the [c]ourt is armed with such information can it properly assess the
15

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 26 of 36

Pg ID 185

convenience of the witnesses.” New World Systems Corp. v. Jones, No. 06-11603,
2009 WL 996954, *5 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 14, 2009). Because the Government has
failed to present the name and specific testimony of a single witness, this factor
weighs against transfer. Id. at *6 (“[W]ithout a specific list of witnesses’ names and
an outline of what material testimony the witnesses would provide, this Court cannot
properly assess the convenience of the witnesses. The convenience of witnesses
factor does not weigh in Defendants’ favor.”).
Conversely, the Valero Companies have identified multiple witnesses that
would benefit from a single litigation. The Valero Companies have retained the
services of FTI Consulting, Inc. A.J. Gravel is an expert witness that will provide
material testimony as to, inter alia, the historical contamination at the various
refineries, the source of that contamination, Government control, damages
modeling, and other relevant information.

See generally, Exhibit B, Gravel

Affidavit. Forcing the Valero Companies’ shared expert to travel to and appear in
nine different districts is unduly cumbersome, duplicative, expensive, impractical
and inconvenient.

Additionally, Tim George is a Vice President whose

responsibilities include managing the environmental liabilities of the Valero
Companies and who oversees the remediation work being conducted across all of
the Valero Companies’ refineries in the First Amended Complaint. See Exhibit C,
George Affidavit, at ¶¶ 2-3. Forcing the Valero Companies’ shared remediation
16

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 27 of 36

Pg ID 186

personnel to appear in nine different districts is similarly inconvenient, burdensome
and expensive. Given the inconvenience that multiple litigations would present for
the common key witnesses shared by the Valero Companies across all 12 sites, this
factor weighs strongly against transfer.
B.

The Location of Relevant Documents and Relative Ease of Access
to Sources of Proof Weighs Against Transfer.

The Government argues that “the parties will need to examine documents
concerning the history of operations at each refinery and the costs that Plaintiffs have
incurred in cleaning up the sites, and the United States expects that most such
documents will be located at the respective refineries, at Plaintiffs’ corporate offices,
or in the offices of the state regulators overseeing cleanup efforts.” ECF No. 13 at
19 (emphasis added). Quite simply, the Government has not yet identified any
evidence that would render transfer appropriate, to the extent it may exist at all. See
Central Transport Intern., Inc. v. Alcoa, Inc., No. 06-CV-11913-DT, 2006 WL
2844171, *4 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 29, 2006) (“Although both parties generally state that
their choice of forum allows for ease of access to relevant documents, neither party
discloses to the court with any specificity either the number of documents or their
relevance to this case. Thus, the court is unable to adequately weigh this factor.”).
“Moreover, access to documents is a less significant factor in this ‘era of
photocopying, fax machines, and Federal Express.’” Id. (citation omitted). “As a
result, ‘this factor should thus be limited to the extent that the files could not be
17

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 28 of 36

Pg ID 187

produced in the alternative forum.’” Performance Contracting, 2012 WL 1666394
at *5 (citation omitted).
The relative ease of access to sources of proof during litigation “is highly
contingent upon the location of the [p]laintiff’s principal place of business.” New
World Systems Corp., 2009 WL 996954 at *6. The Valero Companies share a
corporate headquarters and principal place of business at One Valero Way in San
Antonio, Texas. Moreover, the bulk of the evidence and available historical records
are currently hosted electronically and available in any forum. See Exhibit B, Gravel
Affidavit, at ¶ 6; Exhibit C, George Affidavit, at ¶ 4. Producing documents in one
action would be favorable to producing documents in nine separate actions where
much of the evidence applies to multiple sites. The costs of document production
and discovery would undeniably decrease if transfer is denied. As such, this factor
weighs against transfer.
C.

The Convenience of the Parties Weighs Against Transfer.

“[T]ransfer is not appropriate if the result is simply to shift the inconvenience
from one party to another.” Sullivan, 602 F.Supp.2d at 800 (citation omitted). The
Government must clearly demonstrate that litigating nine separate actions is more
convenient for both parties and not just the Government. This is simply not the case.
As the Government reluctantly concedes, it is uniquely ubiquitous and may
be found anywhere in the United States. ECF No. 13 at 17 n.2. This renders the
18

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 29 of 36

Pg ID 188

Government better-suited to litigate nine similar, contemporaneous actions in nine
districts across the country. The Government has legal counsel in every district of
every state. Meanwhile, the Valero Companies have obtained counsel licensed to
practice in the Eastern District of Michigan and would need to obtain new counsel
in the eight additional districts to which the Government seeks transfer. See Central
Transport Intern., 2006 WL 284471 at *3 (considering location of counsel in finding
convenience of the parties factor neutral). Moreover, the Government faces no real
burden in litigating this single action in the Eastern District of Michigan. Even if
transfer is granted, the Government will still need to litigate in Michigan.
Simply put, this action would be more convenient if tried as a single case by
avoiding the costs associated with duplicitous appearances, discovery, and motions
practice. As such, this factor weighs against transfer.
D.

The Locus of Operative Facts Is, at a Minimum, Neutral.

The Government strongly argues that the locus of operative facts supports
transfer because of the refineries’ locations. Given the historical nature of this case,
however, the location of the refineries is not a significant factor. For example, the
Government raises the issue that the refineries’ locations serve as an expected
location of sources of proof. ECF No. 13 at 19. But, in reality, evidence and sources
of proof are available in a central filing system in San Antonio and others are
currently available electronically, having been collected from archives and records
19

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 30 of 36

Pg ID 189

repositories across the country. See Exhibit B, Gravel Affidavit, at ¶ 6; Exhibit C,
George Affidavit, at ¶ 4.
Similarly, the Government argues that litigation near the refineries’ locations
serves local interests because that is “where all of the contamination at issue is
located and where any harm associated with that contamination will be
experienced.” ECF No. 13 at 19, 21. This is a red herring. This case is not about
unaddressed contamination or who will perform cleanup that may impact local
concerns. The Valero Companies have performed, or are performing, required
cleanups. This case is about requiring the Government to pay its fair share—and no
more—of the costs incurred by the Valero Companies.
In addition, where a “case involves events that have occurred in a number of
states,” the importance of this factor is diminished and should receive only slight
weight, even if a key event occurs in a particular forum. Central Transport Intern.,
2006 WL 2844171 at *3. Such is the case here. The Government exercised control
over the nation’s refineries from Washington DC, PAW regional district offices in,
for example, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas, and at the refineries themselves.
Evidence of that control, as discussed above, is currently available electronically. In
any event, the action, as a whole, was brought in the district where the most operative
facts for the most sites exist. As such, this factor weighs against transfer, though it
may be of diminished weight.
20

E.

Pg ID 190

The Availability of Process to Compel the Attendance of Unwilling
Witnesses Is Neutral.

“[T]he only relevant witnesses under this factor are non-party witnesses.”
Performance Contracting, 2012 WL 1666394 at *7. The Government has failed to
specifically identify any non-party witnesses that are unwilling or unable to testify
in the Eastern District of Michigan. In fact, the Government fails to specifically
identify any witnesses at all. As a result, the Government has not met its burden and
this factor is neutral. Id. (“Because Defendants have not identified any witness who
resides outside the 100–mile subpoena limit of this Court and who is unwilling to
incur the burden of traveling to Michigan to testify, they have not met their burden
of demonstrating that this factor weighs in favor of transferring the case[.]”); see
also Thomas, 131 F.Supp.2d at 940 (holding that defendant did not show this factor
weighed in favor of its motion when defendant named a witness, but made no
showing that the witness was necessary or unwilling to voluntarily testify).
F.

The Relative Means of the Parties Weighs Against Transfer.

The Government is uniquely capable of and advantaged by litigating multiple
lawsuits anywhere in the country.

The Government maintains attorneys and

significant resources in every district in the United States. The Valero Companies
do not. To the extent that the Government has the means to more easily litigate nine
actions in nine districts at the same time, this factor weighs against transfer.

21

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 32 of 36

G.

Pg ID 191

The Forum’s Familiarity with Governing Law Is Neutral.

When claims are based on federal law, “both forums are equally familiar with
the governing law.” William M. Yarbrough Foundation v. Garcoa Laboratories,
Inc., No. 1:11-CV-907, 2013 WL 4068176, *7 (W.D. Mich. Aug 12, 2013). Because
the Valero Companies bring a CERCLA cost recovery action here, this factor is
neutral. It is important to note, however, that transfer of this single action to nine
separate districts creates a substantial risk of non-uniform decisions across
applications of common federal law.
H.

The Weight Accorded Plaintiffs’ Choice of Forum Is Substantial
and Weighs Against Transfer.

A plaintiff’s choice of forum is normally entitled to substantial weight in the
transfer analysis. “[U]nless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the
plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.” Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert,
330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947). This presumption “may be overcome only when the
private and public interest factors clearly point towards trial in the alternative
forum.” Performance Contracting, 2012 WL 1666394 at *8 (citations omitted).
Here, Plaintiffs have chosen the Eastern District of Michigan because it is the most
convenient forum for the parties as the home forum for the most sites in the First
Amended Complaint. As such, there is a significant tie between Plaintiffs and the
selected forum and it is entitled to substantial deference.

22

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 33 of 36

Pg ID 192

Moreover, where Congress expresses an intent to broaden the venue options
available to a plaintiff or class of plaintiffs in order to further the purposes of a
statute, a plaintiff’s choice of venue “must be afforded a heightened level of
deference, beyond the usual deference afforded plaintiffs under § 1404(a) analysis.”
Winnett v. Caterpillar Inc., 2006 WL 1722434, *5 (M.D. Tenn. June 20, 2006); see
also Abbott v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 2007 WL 844903, *2 (S.D. Ill. Mar. 20, 2007)
(interpreting an identical “may be found” venue provision in a class action as
affording increased deference to plaintiff’s choice of forum due to Congressional
intent to broaden venue options). Here, Plaintiffs’ choice of forum is actually
entitled to more deference than normal, not less or none as the Government contends.
I.

Trial Efficiency and the Interests of Justice Weigh Heavily Against
Transfer.

The Government argues that because the standard for CERCLA liability is
site-specific, “it is unlikely that there are meaningful efficiencies to be gained by a
trial of all of Plaintiffs’ claims before one court in a single action.” ECF No. 13 at
22. The Government overlooks a number of commonalities across all claims that
would be unnecessarily duplicated in each of the nine actions if transfer were
granted.
First, the claims allege a common theory of liability stemming from a national
policy of wartime Government control of the refineries. All evidence that applies to
this nationwide plan would need to be reproduced in discovery nine times if the
23

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 34 of 36

Pg ID 193

Government’s relief is granted. Other discovery requests are likely to be repetitive
for each claim as well. Motion practice will likely be duplicative, particularly at the
outset of litigation. Moreover, the Valero Companies and the Government will need
to present common experts and other witnesses in each case. Ultimately, the
Government cannot reasonably argue that these are not meaningful efficiencies. See
Orton v. Johnny’s Lunch Franchise LLC, No. 10-cv-11013, 2012 WL 2115841, *1
(E.D. Mich. June 8, 2012) (“[A]s a matter of preserving scarce judicial resources,
the Court is loath to prolong bifurcated litigation of similar claims and issues in
separate courts. Doing so taxes the courts as well as the parties, causing the needless
waste of time and financial resources”).
The interests of justice also weigh heavily against transfer. If the Court
transfers these nearly identical cases to nine districts, there is a serious risk of nonuniform applications of CERCLA law. See Distributing Corp. of Am. v. Deere &
Co., No. 87-3332, 1987 WL 61946, *2 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 16, 1987) (“The most
persuasive consideration, however, is the fact that the action now pending in the
Western district involves issues of fact and law that are quite similar to those
involved in this case” and “consolidation will facilitate more efficient discovery in
both actions, will save time and money on the part of witnesses, will avoid
duplicitous litigation, and will avoid the risk of inconsistent results.”); Orton, 2012
WL 2115841 at *1 (“Dual litigation also creates the risk of inconsistent
24

1:17-cv-11174-TLL-PTM Doc # 20 Filed 09/22/17 Pg 35 of 36

Pg ID 194

judgments.”). Rather than trying the same and similar issues multiple times in
multiple districts, this court should maintain the instant action in the Eastern District
of Michigan.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Valero Companies respectfully request that the
Court deny the Government’s Motion to Dismiss Misjoined Plaintiffs and Claims
or, in the Alternative, to Sever and Transfer Claims.
