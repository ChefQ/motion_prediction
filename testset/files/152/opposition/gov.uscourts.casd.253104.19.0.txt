INTRODUCTION
Defendants ask this Court to either dismiss plaintiff Veoh Networks, Inc.'s complaint (which

3

arose as a direct result of threats of litigation from Defendants relating to the application and

4

interpretation of the Copyright Act), or disturb Veoh's choice of venue in the Southern District,

5

(where Veoh is headquartered and its key witnesses are located). While the Defendant media giants'

6

desire to obtain a tactical advantage over Veoh is clear, Defendants' motion ("Motion"), couched

7

largely in the language of various irrelevant news reports, should be rejected. It is without support in

8

fact or law, and amounts to little more than a press release.

9

Winston & Strawn LLP

Document 19

Clearly, Veoh's dispute with Defendants is not hypothetical, vague, or imaginary as

10

Defendants intimate. Indeed, Defendants have now made good on their July 2007 threat against

11

Veoh, filing an action in the Central District on September 4, 2007, one month after Veoh filed the

12

present action.1

13

Defendants alternatively seek to transfer Veoh's action to the Central District, despite failing

14

to satisfy the evidentiary burden required before transfer can even be considered. Defendants have

15

not shown that they would be inconvenienced by litigating in the Southern District, have not

16

identified with the necessary particularity any witness who would be inconvenienced by litigating in

17

the Southern District, have not bothered to provide a status report on the actions it wishes to

18

consolidate this matter with, and have not identified a single document that would be available in

19

Los Angeles, but not San Diego.

20

Veoh's complaint is proper as and where filed. The facts and law clearly support permitting

21

Plaintiff to obtain declaratory relief as set forth in Veoh's complaint in the Southern District, the

22

venue selected by Veoh. That selection should not be disturbed.

In copyright litigation (also involving the safe harbor provided by Section 512(c) of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") at issue in this case), currently pending in the

10

Northern District of California, Io Group, Inc. v. Veoh, Inc., Case No. 06-3926 (N.D. Cal. filed June

11

23, 2006), all of the depositions of Veoh's employees, as well as Plaintiff's 30(b)(6) deposition of

12

Veoh, were taken in San Diego, California, and all of those witnesses were based at and lived near

13

Veoh's San Diego headquarters. Id., ยถ 6.2

14

Likewise, nearly all of the relevant documentary evidence regarding Veoh's operations is

15

maintained either electronically or at its San Diego headquarters. The majority of Veoh's technology

16

equipment used to carry out business operations is located at or near its San Diego headquarters.

17

(Fitzgerald Decl., ยถ 7.) Veoh also houses servers at a third-party data center in El Segundo,

18

California, but that data is electronic and equally accessible to Veoh in San Diego or Los Angeles.

19

Id. Veoh's Los Angeles office maintains minimal technology equipment beyond the computer

20

equipment necessary for the employees located in Los Angeles. (Fitzgerald Decl., ยถ 7.)

21

B.

Veoh's Policies Prohibiting Infringement

22

While Defendants go to great lengths in their Motion to paint Veoh as a haven for copyright

23

infringement (relying entirely on Internet blog and news reports misleadingly quoted out of context),

24

nothing could be further from the truth. As shown above, Veoh has always made compliance with

25

copyright laws a top priority. Veoh has always strictly prohibited the use of its website or software

26

in connection with any inappropriate content and Veoh has always terminated access to such content

27

when it becomes aware of it. No one, including UMG, can dispute that is the case. While Veoh has

28

2

Fact discovery has closed in that case. (Calkins Decl. ยถ 4 and Exh. C.)

always had and enforced a rigorous DMCA policy, Veoh goes far beyond what the DMCA requires

2

in order to keep infringing works off of Veoh.

3

Winston & Strawn LLP

Document 19

Defendants' cheap shots at Veoh have no basis in fact, are irrelevant to Defendants' motion,

4

and are more appropriate to one of Defendants' press releases than to a motion to dismiss or transfer

5

venue.

6

C.

Defendants' Threats of Litigation and Veoh's Declaratory Relief Action

7

Veoh first learned of Defendants' assertion that Veoh's network was "massively infringing"

8

Defendants' copyrights at a July 2007 meeting between the parties.3 Fitzgerald Decl., ยถ 9. At that

9

meeting, Defendants refused to identify which of Defendants' copyrights were at issue yet

10

maintained that Veoh was liable and specifically threatened litigation against Veoh for the purported

11

infringement. Id. Defendants did not say when or where such litigation would be commenced. Id.

12

Had Defendants identified specific infringements, Veoh would have promptly terminated access to

13

that content in accordance with Veoh's policies. Defendants consistently refused.

14

Left in the untenable position of being faced with impending litigation over unidentified

15

content and unidentified copyrights, Veoh sought declaratory relief in this Court to obtain relief from

16

the threat of litigation which Defendants might have initiated the next day, the next week, or never.

17

Indeed, Veoh's position is precisely the situation contemplated under the Declaratory Judgment Act.

18

Defendants' attempts to deny Veoh the opportunity to obtain declaratory relief in the forum Veoh

19

selected must be rejected.

20

The irony here is that Defendants attempt to defeat a declaratory relief action as to Veoh's

21

entitlement to safe harbor (in part based on lack of knowledge of any infringement) by claiming that

22

Veoh does not know the infringements that Defendants are asserting. Such circular reasoning would

23

turn the DMCA on its head, as Veoh's lack of knowledge is absolutely fundamental to its entitlement

24

to safe harbor.

25
26
27
28

Section 512(c) of the DMCA provides safe harbor to qualifying service providers like Veoh
3

In their Motion Defendants point out that the parties agreed to treat the July 2007 meeting as a Rule
408 settlement discussion. While Rule 408 limits the introduction at trial of evidence regarding
settlement negotiations, Rule 408 does not require exclusion of evidence of such discussions when
offered for other relevant purposes, as here, to demonstrate Defendants' threats of litigation and
refusal to identify specific infringements.

1

from liability for monetary relief and limits injunctive relief for infringing user submitted material if

2

the service provider meets the safe harbor's requirements. With the DMCA safe harbor, Congress

3

carefully balanced the rights and responsibilities of content providers and Internet service providers.

4

While Veoh has always fully lived up to its obligations, Defendants have refused to provide Veoh

5

with the basic information (required by the DMCA) that would allow Veoh to identify and terminate

6

access to works infringing Defendants' copyrights. Instead Defendants apparently take the position

7

that they can simply ignore the careful balance Congress created in enacting the DMCA safe harbor

8

and shift all the burden for policing their copyrights onto Veoh and other service providers.

D.

Defendants' Other Lawsuits And Pending Actions

10

Defendants are no strangers to litigation, having litigated copyright infringement suits

11

throughout the United States, often outside the Central District of California. See, e.g., UMG

12

Recordings, Inc. et al v. Bertelsmann, A.G. et al, 222 F.R.D. 408 (N.D. Cal. 2004); UMG

13

Recordings, Inc. v. Hummer Winblad Venture Partners (In re Napster Copyright Litig.), 2007 U.S.

14

Dist. LEXIS 25175 (N.D. Cal. 2004); UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc. (In re Napster

15

Copyright Litig.), 92 F. Supp. 2d 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Defendants have filed hundreds of lawsuits

16

against individuals for copyright infringement, including many outside of the Central District of

17

California. (Calkins Decl., ยถ 2 and Exh. A).

18

About a year ago, on October 16, 2006, Defendants filed copyright infringement suit against

19

two Internet Service Providers in Los Angeles, California. See UMG Recordings, Inc., et al v.

20

Grouper Networks, Inc., et al, C.D. Cal., CV06-6561; UMG Recordings, Inc., et al v. Bolt, Inc., et

21

al, C.D. Cal., CV06-6577. A month later, Defendants filed suit against MySpace. See UMG

22

Recordings, Inc., et al v. MySpace, Inc., et al, C.D. Cal., CV06-07361. Those three cases have been

23

consolidated, and are well under way with fact discovery set to close in less than six months.

24

(Calkins Decl. ยถ 3 and Exh. B.) The expert witness disclosure period is set to open in that case in

25

less than three months. Id.

26

As revealed in the Motion, Defendants alternatively seek to transfer Veoh's action to the

27

Central District in an effort to consolidate Veoh's present action with Defendants' three existing,

28

year-old matters in that Court. On its face such a tactic makes no sense as the Section 512(c) safe

harbor issue, central to Veoh's action involves a highly factually specific examination of a particular

2

company's knowledge of allegedly infringing material, a particular company's practice regarding

3

processing notices of infringement and how a particular company handles specific infringing

4

material. See 17 U.S.C. ยง512(c). These facts, fundamental to any case involving Section 512(c),

5

will necessarily be unique to each matter, and what the individual defendants in Defendants' pending

6

Central District cases know or knew, do or have done is irrelevant to Veoh's case. Veoh should not

7

be dragged into unrelated, aged litigation for Defendants' convenience.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
A.

Veoh is Entitled to a Declaratory Judgment of its Rights

Veoh, faced with a very real controversy, is entitled to a judicial determination in the form of

11

declaratory judgment. When determining whether or not a controversy exists, "[b]asically, the

12

question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a

13

substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and

14

reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment." MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 127

15

S. Ct. 764, 771 (2007) (quoting Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273

16

(1941)). The Court in MedImmune "further re-affirmed that an 'actual controversy' requires only that

17

a dispute be "definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal

18

interests." Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., 482 F.3d 1330, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2007)

19

(emphasis added).

20
21

1.

Veoh's Dispute is Definite and Concrete

Defendants disingenuously hold out Veoh's lack of knowledge of any activity or material on

22

its system that purportedly infringes UMG copyrights as evidence that Veoh's dispute is not "definite

23

and concrete." (Motion, 10:24 -25 โ 11:1-2). Veoh's lack of knowledge of any infringing material

24

on its system, however, is a fundamental element under the DMCA safe harbor set forth at 17 U.S.C.

25

ยง 512(c) and critical to the ultimate adjudication Veoh seeks through its Complaint.

26

Defendants similarly assert that Veoh's Complaint is not "definite and concrete" because

27

Defendants "ha[ve] not provided any information about the alleged infringement." (Motion, 11:2-3).

28

As Defendants well know, Defendants refused Veoh's requests that Defendants identify the allegedly

1

infringing material while continuing to threaten litigation. While Defendants now attempt to

2

advantage themselves through their own refusal to provide information, this fact only further frames

3

the dispute as the question of whether or not Defendants gave Veoh notice of the alleged

4

Veoh's Dispute Arises Under the Copyright Act Over Which This Court
Has Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction

Veoh's action is for declaratory relief for non-infringement of copyright and entitlement to
9
safe harbor pursuant to Section 512(c), a matter necessarily arising under the Copyright Act. Section
10
1338 gives the federal district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under
333 South Grand Avenue
Los Angeles, CA 90071-1543

copyright laws.
12
28 U.S.C. Section 1338 provides:
13
14
15
16

(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil
action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant
variety protection, copyrights and trademarks. Such jurisdiction
shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent, plant variety
protection and copyright cases.

17

28 U.S.C. ยง 1338 (a).

18

As the Court in Vestron, Inc., v. Home Box Office, Inc., 839 F.2d 1380 (9th Cir. 1988) in

19

analyzing whether federal jurisdiction existed concluded: "An action arises under the federal

20

copyright laws if โฆ the complaint is for a remedy expressly granted by the Act, โฆ or asserts a claim

21

requiring construction of the Act, โฆ or, โฆ where a distinctive policy of the Act requires that federal

22

principles control the disposition of the claim." Id., at 1381. "Our test sets forth three independent

23

grounds for sustaining federal jurisdiction in copyright cases. If any of these three grounds is

24

satisfied, the federal courts have jurisdiction." Id.

25

Veoh's action for declaratory relief for non-infringement of copyright and entitlement to safe

26

harbor pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง512(c) at a minimum satisfies the first and second grounds articulated

27

by the Vestron court, and likely satisfies all three. As such, Veoh's action under the Copyright Act is

28

clearly within this Court's exclusive jurisdiction.

Defendants attempt to argue that Veoh's Complaint should be dismissed because Veoh does
not identify any registered copyright in dispute as required to maintain an action for copyright
infringement. (Motion, 11:12-13). But Veoh is not claiming copyright infringement, Veoh is
seeking declaratory relief arising under the Copyright Act. There is no reason Veoh's Complaint
should identify "even one registered copyright in dispute as required by 17 U.S.C. ยง 411"4 and no
authority for the notion that Veoh's Complaint for declaratory relief should be dismissed for not
containing such identification. Veoh is simply not bound by pleading requirements for causes of
action not pled. Defendants' purported authority does not hold otherwise.5

Defendants Have Failed to Meet Their Burden To Justify Transfer

Defendants alternatively seek a transfer, but have failed to sustain the burden of justifying a
transfer. "For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may
transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought." 28
U.S.C. ยง 1404(a). Section 1404(a) "is intended to place discretion in the district court to adjudicate
motions for transfer according to an 'individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and
fairness.'" Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 29 (1988) (quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack,
376 U.S. 612 (1964)).

19
20

Whether Or Not Veoh Has Met Pleading Requirements for a Copyright
Infringement Action is Irrelevant as Veoh's Complaint is for Declaratory
Relief, Not Copyright Infringement.

The burden is on the moving party to show that "the convenience of parties and witnesses"
and "interest of justice" requires transfer to another district. Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v.
Savage (9th Cir. 1979) 611 F2d 270, 279; Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. NFL (C.D.
Cal. 1981) 89 F.R.D. 497, 499, aff'd (9th Cir. 1984) 726 F2d 1381. A transfer will not be ordered if
the result is merely to shift the inconvenience from one party to another. The party seeking the
transfer has the burden of demonstrating that trial in the district where the action is pending will

17 U.S.C. ยง 411 sets forth the prerequisites for a plaintiff to maintain an action alleging
infringement of copyright. 17 U.S.C. ยง 411. Indeed, it only makes sense that before a plaintiff may
sue another for copyright infringement, the plaintiff must first show that he or she is the rightful
copyright owner with standing to bring the action.

Veoh Is Entitled to Its Choice of Forum

A plaintiff's choice of forum is accorded substantial weight in proceedings under ยง 1404(a).

7

"The defendant must make a strong showing of inconvenience to warrant upsetting the plaintiff's

8

choice of forum." Gherebi v. Bush, 352 F.3d 1278, 1302 (9th Cir. 2003); Decker Coal Co. v.

9

Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 843 (9th Cir.1986). "Transfer should not be granted if

10

the effect is simply to shift the inconvenience to the party resisting the transfer." Gherebi, supra, at

11

1303. Further, there is a "strong 'presumption in favor of plaintiff's choice of forums.'" Id. (citing

12

Gulf Oil Corp v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947).) "This presumption must be taken into account

13

when deciding whether the convenience of the parties--rather than the convenience of respondent--

14

requires a transfer." Gherebi, supra, at 1303. (italics in original).

15

In light of the deference properly given to Veoh's choice of forum, Defendants bear a heavy

16

burden of demonstrating that the other factors justify departing from it. Courts should not order a

17

transfer unless the "convenience" and "justice" factors strongly favor venue elsewhere. Securities

18

Investor Protection Corp. v. Vigman (9th Cir. 1985) 764 F.2d 1309, 1317. Defendants have failed to

Transfer to The Central District from the Southern District Would
Promote Neither Justice Nor Convenience

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a), "[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the

1189-1190 (S.D. Cal. 2007).
25
Here, Defendants have failed to sufficiently identify considerations of convenience or justice

that would justify disturbing Veoh's choice of forum. The interests of justice favor keeping the
27
action in this Court. And Defendants' claims of party and witness convenience fall short as they

The Interests of Justice Do Not Favor Transfer

District courts have broad discretion in determining venue motions. The "interest of justice"

7

is a factor in both ยง 1406(a) and ยง 1404(a) motions. Arley v. United Pacific Ins. Co., 379 F2d 183,

8

185 (9th Cir. 1967); Casarez v. Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Co., 193 F3d 334, 339 (5th Cir.

9

1999).

10

Defendants argue that transfer of Veoh's declaratory relief action to the Central District is in

11

the "interests of justice" because "two courts will need to study the case law relating to the DMCA".

12

Motion at 20. This of course does not justify transfer to the Central District. A number of courts

13

outside the Central District have considered the issue of Section 512(c) safe harbor. There are

14

currently cases pending in this District (DIVX, Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc. et al, No. 07-cv-01753

15

(S.D. Cal. filed Sept. 6, 2007), in the Northern District of California (Io Group, Inc. v. Veoh, Inc.,

16

Case No. 06-3926 (N.D. Cal. filed June 23, 2006)), and in the Southern District of New York

17

(Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., No. 07 CV 02103 (S.D.N.Y. filed March 13, 2007)) in

18

which online video sites have asserted safe harbor pursuant to Section 512(c). Other courts outside

19

the Central District have issued opinions addressing entitlement to Section 512(c) safe harbor. See,

20

e.g., Corbis v. Amazon, 351 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1103-04 (W.D. Wash. 2004) (granting 512(c) safe

Defendants Cannot Establish Any Party or Witness Convenience
Warranting Transfer

Determination of a party and witness "convenience" and "interest of justice" is within the
25
court's discretion. Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 29-30 (1988). Here, Defendants

have failed to point to any countervailing witness or party convenience factors that outweigh Veoh's

choice of forum and outbalance the substantial public interests that counsel against transfer,

particularly given that Veoh's headquarters and nearly all of its relevant witnesses and documentary

Indeed, "convenience of witnesses is often the most important factor in a ยง 1404(a) transfer

4

motion." Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 472 F. Supp. 2d 1183, 1193 (S.D. Cal.

In Bohara v. Backus Hosp. Med. Ben. Plan, 390 F. Supp. 2d 957, 963 (C.D. Cal. 2005), the

12

Court held that unsupported arguments identical to those set forth by Defendants here were

13

insufficient to support transfer:

14

Weighing the factors of the convenience to witnesses and access to

15

evidence, Defendant argues that all of the witnesses and documents

16

concerning the claim handling or the determination of Plaintiff's

17

administrative appeal are located in Connecticut. However, the Court

18

agrees with Plaintiff that this argument is insufficient to support

19

transfer in this case for several reasons. First, if the transfer is for the

20

convenience of witnesses, defendant must name the witnesses it wishes

21

to call, the anticipated areas of their testimony and its relevance, and

22

the reasons why the present forum would present a hardship to them.

Like the unsuccessful movant in Bohara, Defendants here fail to make a showing, instead

5

"supporting" their motion with insufficient "mere conclusory allegations." Defendants have not

6

identified with any specificity any of their own witnesses, where their witnesses are located, the

7

nature of their testimony, or the importance of the testimony. Defendants have similarly failed to

8

identify any third party witnesses, and indeed have done nothing more than speculate regarding

9

where a few select members on Veoh's board (who would likely not be witnesses in any event) and

10

two employees are "based." The naked fact of where these individuals are located does not help

11

Defendants in any event, absent a showing that a drive to San Diego would present a real and actual

12

hardship, particularly where these are Veoh's witnesses.

13

14

Defendants Fail to Provide Any Admissible Evidence Supporting
Transfer

Setting aside for the moment the oddity of Defendants' attempt to contradict Veoh itself
15
regarding what is most convenient for Veoh, Defendants' purported evidence in "support" of transfer
16
amounts to nothing more than a collection of conclusory allegations, hearsay, strained interpretations
17
of website pages, and reference to a deposition of Veoh's Chief Scientist Dr. Ted Dunning, taken
18
earlier this year in San Diego. (Defendants' Exh. P to Declaration of Benjamin Glatstein ("Glatstein
19
Decl.")). Defendants also strangely try to drag in Veoh's Terms of Use between Veoh and its users,
20
a contract to which Defendants do not claim to be parties to in the first place and which is therefore
21

entirely irrelevant to the inquiry at hand.6

22
For example, Defendants hold out the fact that Veoh's agent for service of process in
23
California is the widely used CT Corporation System at 818 West Seventh Street., Los Angeles,
24
California and attach a page from the California Secretary of State's Business Portals site.
25
(Defendants' Exh. O to Glatstein Decl.). Defendants fail to point out to the Court however, that that
26
very same page, Exhibit O, also identifies Veoh's business address as 7220 Trade Street, #115, San
27
6

28

Veoh's TOU is solely between Veoh and its users for claims arising from the TOU or a user's use
of Veoh.

P to the Glatstein Decl. as evidence that "the witnesses and documents relating to Veoh's DMCA

defense are located in the Central District." (Motion 22:27 โ 23:1). A review of Defendants' Exhibit

Veoh's Headquarters, Witnesses, and Documents are in San Diego

While Defendants exert much energy attempting to attach a nefarious purpose to Veoh's
selection of the Southern District, the fact remains that the Southern District, where Veoh is

10

headquartered and where the vast majority of its employees, witnesses, and documents are located, is

11

far more convenient for Veoh. (Fitzgerald Decl., ยถยถ 3-9.) The fact that most of Veoh's relevant

12

witnesses are located in San Diego is pointedly illustrated by the fact that in copyright litigation

13

involving the DMCA safe harbor at issue in this case, all of the depositions of Veoh's employees, as

14

well as Plaintiff's 30(b)(6) deposition of Veoh, were taken in San Diego, California, and all of those

15

witnesses were based at and lived near Veoh's San Diego headquarters. (Fitzgerald Decl., ยถ 6.)

16

Defendants simply ignore the mountain of obvious and legitimate reasons supporting Veoh's

17

selection of the Southern District, ignore information contained in Defendants' own exhibits (e.g.

18

Exh. O to Glatstein Decl.), and instead focus on irrelevant or insignificant facts like where

19

Defendants "believe" select board members, who are unlikely to be witnesses in this action in any

20

event, are "based," and Veoh's TOU, which, as discussed above, is not a contract Defendants are a

21

party to and in fact, has nothing to do with Defendants. Importantly, Defendants have made no

22

showing whatsoever that any witness who happens to be located in Los Angeles would be unable to

23

make the easy two hour drive to San Diego if necessary to testify in the Southern District, and have

24

made no showing that any document available in Los Angeles would be unavailable in San Diego.

25

Indeed, Defendants ask this Court to view a drive from Los Angeles to San Diego as an

26

insurmountable barrier to access, when of course it is nothing more than a simple day trip.

litigation against Bolt, Grouper, and MySpace, is entirely without support. To allow Defendants to

uproot and lump Veoh and all future DMCA plaintiffs into the Central District merely because

3

Defendants previously filed copyright infringement cases that also implicate Section 512(c), would

4

set an untenable precedent and wreak havoc on the well established law that a plaintiff's choice of

5

forum is to be accorded substantial weight.

6

Winston & Strawn LLP

Document 19

As set forth above, there are cases pending in various courts throughout this state and the

7

country, which implicate Section 512(c) safe harbor; indeed, DIVX, Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc. et

8

al, No. 07-cv-01753 is currently pending in the Southern District. Arguments that another district

9

court is "more familiar" with a particular area of federal law and therefore a more appropriate forum

10

for the litigation fall flat as all federal judges are presumed to be equally competent in federal

11

question cases. Cargill Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 920 F. Supp.144, 148 (D. Colo.

12

1996); see, Textile Mills Securities Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 314 U.S. 326, 328

13

(1941).

14

The Section 512(c) safe harbor factual inquiry, which will be a central issue in this litigation,

15

is also highly factually specific as to what knowledge a company has of allegedly infringing

16

material, and how each individual company processes notices of infringement and handles specific

17

infringing material. See 17 U.S.C. ยง512(c). Those are the critical facts to be discovered and

18

examined. Defendants' pending Central District cases deal with different companies led by different

19

management with different policies, whose facts on the above critical issues will necessarily be

20

different. What discovery in the Central District reveals about what defendant Bolt, MySpace or

21

Grouper knew or did or what their policies are, is entirely irrelevant to what Veoh, or Defendants,

22

knew or did in this matter. There is no reason Veoh should be folded into and bogged down in

23

unrelated litigation on unrelated facts in cases much further along in the litigation calendar than the

24

present matter.

25

IV.

26

CONCLUSION
Defendants' contention that this action should be dismissed for lack of an actual case or

27

controversy between the parties is a meritless legal strategy. Defendants have likewise utterly failed

28

to meet their burden of showing that this action should be transferred to the Central District. Veoh's
