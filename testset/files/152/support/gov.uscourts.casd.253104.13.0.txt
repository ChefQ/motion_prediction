MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2 I.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

3

In its complaint, Veoh Networks, Inc. ("Veoh") purports to sue some of the record and

4 music publishing companies within the Universal Music Group ("UMG") - the world's largest
5 music company - for declaratory relief. Veoh seeks a judicial declaration that it is entitled to
6 blanket and permanent, retrospective and prospective, immunity under Section 512(c) of the
7 Copyright Act for its "video sharing" service. However, in its haste to forum shop and wage a
8 publicity campaign, Veoh has failed to properly invoke this Court's jurisdiction.
9

Indeed, although Veoh purports to seek a declaration for non-infringement of copyright, it

10 does not identify even one specific copyrighted work in dispute. Just as a complaint for
11 infringement must allege the existence of at least one registered copyright for jurisdiction to
12 attach, it only makes sense that a complaint seeking a declaration of non-infringement must do so
13 as well. Otherwise, jurisdiction would attach differently for plaintiffs and defendants - and that
14 has never been the law. Moreover, this is not the only reason that the Court lacks subject matter
15 jurisdiction over Veoh's complaint. Veoh's description of the purported "dispute" is so nebulous
16 (indeed, Veoh does not identify a single specific act that is alleged to constitute infringement), that
17 its complaint fails to satisfy the "case or controversy" requirement necessary to support federal
18 subject matter jurisdiction. At best, Veoh's complaint amounts to a request for an advisory
19 opinion.
20

However, even if Veoh could cure its subject matter jurisdiction problems, its complaint

21 should still be dismissed since Veoh filed this case for improper and tactical purposes including to
22 facilitate a publicity campaign aimed to combat the public perception that Veoh is a "piracy23 dependent company,"1 to improve its negotiating leverage with UMG, and to forum shop - none
24 of which are permissible uses of the Declaratory Judgment Act.

Alternatively, if the case is not dismissed outright, it should be transferred pursuant to 28

2 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to the Central District of California where it can be coordinated with several
3 related and pending lawsuits involving overlapping and identical issues of law and fact that have
4 been ongoing for almost a year - and where UMG sued Veoh on September 4, 2007. The Central
5 District is not just the most convenient, efficient, and logical forum to resolve any copyright
6 disputes between the parties, Los Angeles also happens to be the exclusive forum that Veoh itself
7 has selected, and which it contractually imposes upon the public, to adjudicate claims against
8 Veoh. Veoh furthermore also handles claims of copyright infringement in Los Angeles, where
9 Veoh's Senior Manager of Copyright Compliance and many of Veoh's top executives are based.
10 Veoh's attempt to avoid litigating in its own exclusive forum of choice, and where its own
11 copyright compliance operations are based, could not be a more telling sign of the improper
12 tactical purposes animating Veoh's preemptive suit in this Court.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A.

15

UMG's Infringement Battles With "File-Sharing" Mass Infringers.
Since 1999, with the advent of the infamous Napster service, UMG, the rest of the music

16 industry, and other major copyright owners have had to deal with the phenomenon of the piracy of
17 their copyrighted works online through the use of "peer-to-peer" (also known as "p2p") file18 sharing networks. Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks operate by connecting users' computers over
19 the Internet and enabling the users to download or "share" copies of files from one another.
20

In a series of copyright infringement suits litigated all the way to the United States

21 Supreme Court, UMG and other major copyright owners have succeeded in obtaining injunctive
22 relief and monetary damages against Napster (and its investors) and many other major peer-to23 peer file-sharing services that followed in Napster's wake including Kazaa, Scour, Bearshare,
24 Aimster, iMesh, and Grokster.2 During the same timeframe and against the backdrop of these
25 legal successes, lawful online sales of music through legitimate retailers, such as the iTunes store,

have grown significantly, and many new opportunities have developed to license music and music

2 videos online through legitimate services that respect copyright.

B.

UMG's Three Pending Actions In The Central District Of California Against

4

"Video Sharing" Sites.

5

Recently the Internet has witnessed the proliferation of websites featuring video that can be

6 "streamed" over the Internet, including most notably the Internet website called YouTube. Some
7 of these sites are popularly referred to as "video sharing" sites, because they enable "file-sharing"
8 of videos, and it is said that they feature "user-generated content." In reality, however, much of
9 the content on "video sharing" sites consists of professionally made audiovisual works, including
10 music videos featuring UMG's copyrighted works. These videos are not "generated" by the video
11 file-sharing site users in any sense other than the user "generates" unauthorized copies.
12

The "video sharing" sites present new opportunities for copyright owners, such as UMG, to

13 license their works for digital display and distribution. UMG has entered into licenses granting
14 rights to a number of websites to display UMG's music videos over the Internet, including most
15 prominently a deal UMG struck with YouTube in late 2006. UMG's licensed music videos are
16 among the most watched content on YouTube, where in a very short period of time they have been
17 viewed over 246 million times, and is the most popular "channel" on the entire YouTube site,
18 attesting to both to the popularity of UMG's copyrighted works and their value in drawing the
19 public to "video sharing" sites.
20

Some "video sharing" sites have, unfortunately, chosen to exploit music and music videos

21 featuring UMG's copyrighted works without obtaining the right to do so, without paying, and in
22 willful violation of UMG's rights under the copyright laws. In late 2006, in the face of growing
23 infringement of its works on "video sharing," websites, UMG filed separate actions in the Central
24 District of California against Grouper, Bolt and MySpace, three companies that operate or sponsor
25 "video sharing" to illicitly profit from mass infringement of UMG's copyrights in sound recordings
26 and musical compositions. See Glatstein Declaration, Exs. A, D, G (respective complaints).3 The

three suits raise many overlapping issues of fact and law, for example: Grouper, Bolt, and

2 MySpace each encouraged the public to upload thousands of infringing videos to their websites
3 without using filters or people to screen them for copyright infringement; each has reproduced,
4 displayed and distributed thousands of copies of music videos that infringe copyrights owned by
5 UMG; and UMG has alleged each of these "video sharing" defendants (as well as their corporate
6 parents) is liable for direct infringement and indirect infringement of UMG's copyrights. Id. The
7 defendants have responded with similar defenses, and in particular each has given prominence to a
8 purported affirmative defense under the safe harbor provision of the "Digital Millennium
9 Copyright Act" (the "DMCA") codified in Section 512(c) of the Copyright Act.4
10

UMG's first-filed action, brought against Grouper, was assigned to Judge A. Howard Matz.

11 UMG's subsequently filed actions against Bolt and MySpace were transferred to Judge Matz as
12 "related cases." All three cases are being overseen by a single Magistrate Judge, Honorable
13 Andrew J. Wistrich. Because of the factual and legal overlap, Judge Matz ordered coordination of
14 discovery among the cases. Glatstein Decl. Ex. J (3/1/2007 Amended Civil Minutes). Under
15 Judge Matz's coordination order, Magistrate Judge Wistrich's determinations with respect to
16 specific discovery disputes bind other parties as to "all overlapping or jointly applicable discovery
17 disputes, including not only document requests but also issues arising out of depositions,
18 interrogatories and requests for admission." Id. (emphasis in original). Additionally, to reduce the
19 likelihood witnesses would be burdened by multiple depositions, Judge Matz ordered defendants
20 to "undertake good faith efforts to coordinate" discovery with one another. Id.

The Veoh "Video Sharing" Service.
Veoh is a video "file-sharing" company that has chosen to exploit the copyrighted works of

2

3 others without paying. Following in the ignominious footsteps of Napster, Veoh created and
4 operates a peer-to-peer service that Veoh and its users have used extensively for copyright
5 infringement. Veoh also operates a "video sharing" website (www.Veoh.com), where members of
6 the public are invited to upload, display and "share" videos, similar to the websites of the three
7 defendants in the pending suits in the Central District. It is widely known and has been widely
5
8 reported that Veoh has "copyright infringing material aplenty on its site."

Veoh first achieved notoriety as a repository for hard core pornography, "drawing outsized

9

10 attention from bloggers and other Internet users for its willingness to host racy videos that other
11 sites prohibit." Veoh Cleans Up Its Act, But Some Users Cry Foul, Wall Street Journal
12 (6/29/2006). However, after repeatedly "sharing" infringing copies of full length pornographic
13 motion pictures, Veoh was sued by a producer of pornographic movies and Veoh pulled its "adult"
6
14 content - over 15% of the total content its was "sharing" with the public. Id.

More recently, Veoh has been in the news as a "hard core infringer,"7 that eschews even

15

16 the most basic safeguards against infringement that have been adopted by other video sharing
17 sites. As a recent New York Times article explained:
18

[T]he major media companies think the firm [Veoh], backed by Time Warner and

19

Michael Eisner, takes a cavalier attitude toward keeping copyrighted material off its

20

service. They complain that Veoh imposes no time limits on uploaded clips and

21

will not embrace digital fingerprinting technology to filter out copyrighted-

22

material.

3 reason: those safeguards work, and if employed would reduce the number of infringing works on

In late July 2007, respective representatives of UMG and Veoh held a meeting to discuss

6 UMG's investigation into Veoh's unauthorized use of UMG's copyrighted works. The parties
7 agreed the meeting would be treated as a settlement discussion covered by Rule 408 of the Federal
8 Rules of Evidence. The meeting did not result in any agreement and UMG continued its

Veoh's Tactical Suit And Litigation In The Press.
Shortly after the July meeting, on August 9, 2007, Veoh filed this declaratory judgment

12 suit naming as defendants precisely the same UMG entities that are plaintiffs in the three
13 infringement actions in the Central District (though these are by no means all the entities that
14 comprise the Universal Music Group). That is no coincidence; Veoh's counsel plainly studied
15 UMG's pleadings in the Central District and just listed the UMG plaintiffs in those actions as
16 declaratory defendants in this suit. Veoh's justification for bringing a federal lawsuit against UMG
17 is a purported "dispute" with UMG that Veoh summarizes in eight sentences notable for the dearth
18 of information they actually provide. See generally Veoh Complaint ff 61-67.
19

According to Veoh, at some unspecified time in "late July," some unspecified person

20 "threatened Veoh with the prospect of litigation at some point in the future." Id. Iffl 61-62. UMG
21 allegedly accused Veoh of "massively infringing upon UMG's copyrights" and furthermore,
22 "[ijncluded in UMG's threats of litigation were indications that UMG was, or is currently,
23 investigating the alleged infringement." Id. Tff 62, 64. Beyond the apparently threatening
24 "investigating," however, Veoh fails to identify any specific UMG work at issue or any specific
25 act by Veoh at issue. UMG allegedly provided no specifics: "UMG has not provided any

3 and "UMG has not stated with any particularity a level of damages suffered due to the alleged
4 infringement." Veoh Complaint fflf 65- 67. Elsewhere in it Complaint, Veoh is emphatic that
5 Veoh has no independent knowledge regarding any infringement: "Veoh does not have
6 knowledge of any activity or material on its system that is infringing alleged UMG copyrights and
7 is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringing activity is apparent," id. ^ 29;
8 "Veoh has no actual knowledge nor is aware of any facts suggesting that infringing activity is
9 apparent." id. 178; Veoh "lack[s] knowledge regarding any alleged infringement." Id. ^ 84.
10

Veoh, in sum, professes complete ignorance about any basis for any claim as to any UMG

11 copyright. The ballyhooed "threat" that purportedly justified a federal suit reduces to UMG
12 accusing Veoh of being an infringer - which, as the articles cited above show, is an allegation
13 Veoh has heard many times before from other content owners - and "indications" that UMG is
14 "investigating alleged infringement." Nothing in Veoh's nebulous description explains Veoh's
15 race to the courthouse or its dramatic, unsupported assertion that "without concrete knowledge of
16 its rights or the likelihood of future litigation, Veoh cannot operate effectively as a business." Id.
17 If 66. The nebulous "threat" and Veoh's emphatic lack of any knowledge about its alleged
18 infringement is of course not sufficient to invoke federal court jurisdiction. Veoh's contrary
19 conclusion - that litigation against UMG is a business imperative without which Veoh "cannot
20 operate" - is a non sequitur.
21

The truth about the real reasons Veoh rushed to file this action soon emerged, however,

22 when simultaneous with filing suit Veoh issued a press release entitled "Veoh Takes Action To
23 Protect Rights of Copyright Complaint [sic] Companies Offering Innovative Online Content
24 Solutions." Veoh's new CEO, Mr. Steve Mitgang, called numerous reporters to spin the story,

Veoh's CEO, Mitgang, was forthcoming in explaining to one reporter that "the reason

6 owners to put best practices in place."11 In other words, "the reason" Veoh took its action against
7 UMG had nothing to do with UMG's purported "threat." Rather, "the reason" for the suit was to
8 get publicity for Veoh's message that Veoh is a "white-hat company."12 Indeed, regarding UMG,
9 Veoh's CEO stated, "I still hope to work constructively with Universal,"13 i.e., no hard feelings,

25 environment of hardcore copyright piracy. Putting the big picture aside, Veoh's CEO, moreover,
could not even get his facts straight about the lawsuit, stating, for example, that "We're not suing

UMG's Suit Against Veoh.
Veoh's preemptory suit left UMG with no choice but to take action. UMG intensified its

2

3 investigation into Veoh and its activities. UMG carefully analyzed Veoh's operations and
4 collected evidence confirming that Veoh is engaging in the rampant direct and indirect
5 infringement of thousands of UMG's works. UMG then prepared and has just filed a Complaint
6 against Veoh in the Central District of California. See Glatstein Decl. Ex. K (UMG Recordings,
7 Inc., et al. v. Veoh Networks, Inc., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV 07-5744 GW (RCx) (filed 9/4/2207).
8 UMG concurrently filed a related case notice and it expects that like the three earlier-filed actions,
9 it will be assigned to Judge Matz. Glatstein Decl. Ex. L.
The plaintiffs in UMG's suit against Veoh are copyright owners that UMG's pre-filing

10

11 investigation determined have copyrighted works that are being infringed by Veoh. The plaintiffs
12 include the companies pursuing the co-pending suits against Grouper, MySpace and Bolt (UMG
13 Recordings, Inc., Universal Music Corp., Song of Universal, Inc., Universal-Polygram
14 International Publishing, Inc., Rondor Music International, Inc.). In addition, three other UMG
15 publishing companies (Universal Music - MGB NA LLC, Universal Music - Z Tunes LLC, and
16 Universal Music - MBG Music Publishing, Ltd.) have asserted claims against Veoh for
17 infringement of their works. Id. These entities were not named as declaratory defendants by
18 Veoh, which apparently conducted no pre-filing investigation of its own.
UMG's Complaint properly puts in controversy an actual dispute that is ripe for

19

20 adjudication. It describes in detail the basis for UMG's claim that Veoh is a direct and indirect
21 infringer of thousands of UMG's copyrights. Veoh can no longer profess ignorance. In
22 responding to UMG's complaint, Veoh will have the opportunity to address the actual issues in
23 dispute between the parties.

8 must not be nebulous or contingent but must have taken on fixed and final shape so that a court

10 some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them."' United States v. Arnold, 678 F. Supp.

13 (E.D. Cal. 2003) (the "Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the increased likelihood that
14 declaratory judgment actions will fall outside Article III."). Moreover, because Veoh seeks a
15 declaration under the Copyright Act, Veoh must a further threshold subject matter jurisdiction

17 instituted until registration of the copyright claim has been made" with the Copyright Office. 17

Veoh's Complaint fails to meet both Article Ill's case or controversy requirement and the

21 advisory opinion should be dismissed on these two independent grounds.

Veoh Fails To Identify A "Precisely Framed" or "Definite And Concrete" Dispute.

Veoh should have done its homework before suing. Veoh could, for example, have
easily have used Veoh's own search tools to locate UMG works on Veoh's website, Veoh.com,
where there are thousands of UMG copyrighted works to be found. Veoh could have used the
public records of the Copyright Office to obtain registration numbers. But actually investigating
the infringement of UMG works would have forced Veoh to act against its policy of turning a
blind eye and demolished Veoh's incredible claim it is completely ignorant of any infringement.
The alternative would have been for Veoh to just pick one or two UMG copyright registrations as
examples of works that may or may not be in dispute, but that, of course, would have just
highlighted the extent to which Veoh is seeking an advisory opinion.

3 be required to scrutinize every aspect of Veoh's business and all of Veoh's conduct to negate the
4 possibility that Veoh is a direct, contributory, or vicarious infringer (and ruling out Veoh's
5 inducing infringement) as to any UMG copyright. Veoh's request for a wide-ranging declaration
6 divorced from any specific dispute is an extreme example of a impermissible request for an
7 advisory opinion. See Coalition for a Healthy California v. F.C.C., 87 F.3d 383, 386 (9th Cir.
8 1996) (dismissing declaratory judgment complaint where the plaintiff was "not seeking ... to
9 resolve a specific dispute ... federal courts have never been empowered to render advisory
10 opinions") (citation omitted).
11

Veoh further requests that the Court declare that "Veoh, as a host of third-party web-based

12 content, is entitled to safe harbor pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)." Veoh Complaint ^f 5. Section
13 512(c) of the DMCA provides an affirmative defense. See Corbis Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 351
14 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1098-99 (W.D. Wash. 2004) (DMCA is affirmative defense). Veoh's attempt to
15 obtain a broad declaration about its anticipated this affirmative defense in the factual vacuum of
16 Veoh's pleading similarly invites an advisory opinion .17 Contrary to Veoh's suggestion, Section
17 512(c) does not accord some sort of blanket immunity from infringement liability to which a
18 company may be "entitled" or not. To the contrary, the DMCA safe harbor under Section 512(c)
19 applies only to specific activities of companies that qualify as "service providers" — namely
20 "storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or
21 operated by or for the service provider" (and only then if the "service provider" meets all the other

conduct in dispute, it is not possible to determine whether analysis of Section 512(c) is warranted

2 at all, much less applicable to some unspecified Veoh conduct with respect to an unspecified
3 UMG work.
4

The misguided nature of Veoh's attempt to obtain an advisory ruling on an affirmative

5 defense without reference to a specific claim of infringement can be further appreciated when one
6 leaves the abstraction of Veoh's nebulous Complaint, and considers instead the particular acts of
7 infringement alleged by UMG in its Complaint. Among other things, UMG alleges that Veoh
8 operates a Napster-like peer-to-peer network called "Veohnet" that is used to facilitate copyright
9 infringement; Veoh distributes free software to facilitate copyright infringement; Veoh reformats
10 videos to so they can be downloaded more easily to a variety of platforms; Veoh provides the
11 public with free downloads of videos on demand. This Veoh conduct, alleged by UMG as part of
12 the basis for its claims, has nothing remotely to do with "storage at the direction of a user," or the
13 DMCA safe harbor provisions.
14

In sum, Veoh is not entitled to any advisory opinion, whether framed as a wide-ranging

15 request concerning all of Veoh's conduct and all of UMG's copyright, or a request for an opinion
16 about the hypothetical applicability of a single affirmative defense. Veoh's complaint should be
17 dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
18 IV.

VEOH'S TACTICAL SUIT SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS AN ABUSE OF THE

19

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT

20

Even if Veoh's pleadings were sufficient to articulate a "case or controversy," the Court

21 should still dismiss Veoh's Complaint as a matter of its discretion because Veoh filed it for an
22 improper tactical purposes. The exercise of jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action is
23 discretionary. 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (the Court "may declare the rights and other legal relations...");
24 Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277,286 (1995) (the Declaratory Judgment Act provides
25 "conferfs] on federal courts unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the

2 other party to the courthouse") (quotation marks and citations omitted). For that reason, courts
3 decline to exercise jurisdiction over declaratory judgment matters if they appear to have been file
4 for tactical purposes.

For example, in EMC Corp. v. Norand Corp., 89 F.3d 807 (Fed. Cir. 1996), overruled in

6 part on other grounds, Medlmmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., — U.S. —, 127 S. Ct. 764 (2007), the
7 declaratory judgment plaintiff "had taken the step [of filing suit] because its management 'thought
8 it was in their interest to protect themselves first and continue discussions.'" Id. at 809 (quoting
9 plaintiffs attorney). The district court concluded and the Federal Circuit agreed that "to allow a
10 declaratory judgment action to proceed under such circumstances would encourage parties who
11 were negotiating with patentees to use the declaratory judgment procedure to improve their
12 bargaining positions." Id. at 810.
13

This disapproval of tactical, premature declaratory judgment filings accords with the

14 decisions of other courts that "it would be inappropriate to reward—and indeed abet—conduct
15 which is inconsistent with the sound policy of promoting extrajudicial dispute resolution, and
16 conservation of judicial resources." Davox Corp. v. Digital Systems Intern., Inc., 846 F. Supp.
17 144,148 (D. Mass. 1993); see also, e.g., Bausch & Lomb Inc. v. Alcide Corp., 684 F. Supp. 1155,
18 1160 (W.D.N.Y. 1987) (refusing to exercise jurisdiction); Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v.
19 Schneider, 435 F. Supp. 742, 747 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (staying first-filed action) ("[a]s federal court
20 calendars become increasingly burdened, attorneys should exercise a correspondingly increased

In its rush to create good buzz about Veoh as a "white-hat" company, Veoh brought suit

25 prematurely. According to Veoh, it did not know the basis for an infringement claim and UMG
26 stated that it was "investigating" Veoh - nothing more. Veoh's CEO apparently did not think that
27 the discussions with UMG were over, and he made a point of telling a reporter "I still hope to

work constructively with Universal."18 Veoh apparently hoped that filing its Complaint would

2 improve its bargaining position vis-a-vis UMG in a negotiation.
3

As shown by Veoh's "serving" a press release in tandem with launching the suit, its

4 immediate "bold move" update of Veoh's Wikipedia entry and numerous calls Veoh's CEO put in
5 to reporters, Veoh brought suit not because of the need to remove any "Damoclean threat of
6 impending litigation," but rather as a public relations move. Again, in the words of Veoh's
7 CEO, "the reason Veoh took this action is because the company wanted the courts, content owners
8 and others to know that it is compliant with DMCA and Fair Use rules and has been working with
9 content owners to put best practices in place."20 Notably absent in this explanation is any mention
10 of UMG's supposed "threat." Veoh's message to the "courts,[21] content owners and others" is
11 rather Veoh's "white-hat company" theme. What "the company wanted" the world "to know"
12 includes issues that are not even part of Veoh's preemptory Complaint, e.g., that Veoh is allegedly
13 compliant with the "fair use rules" and that it is working "to put best practices in place."
14

The tactical nature of Veoh's suit is further revealed when one considers Veoh's choice of

15 venue; specifically, its decision to evade the Central District of California. Even ignoring the
16 efficiencies and cost-savings that would be derived from filing in the Central District where the
17 related litigation with overlapping and identical issues has been underway for nearly a year, the
18 Central District, specifically Los Angeles, is Veoh's own forum of choice. Veoh's Terms of Use

6 component of Veoh's theory of why it is not liable to UMG: "the TOU agreement contained on
7 Veoh.com protects Veoh from any claims for violation of copyright... Because all registered
8 users ofVeoh.com must electronically accept the TOU, Veoh is not liable for content posted by
9 registered users." Veoh Complaint f| 73-74; see also id. |f 35-38,44 (citing TOU). Veoh's flight
10 from its own exclusive forum of choice - Los Angeles - to file this preemptory suit could not be
11 more telling that its choice of forum was driven by tactical considerations.
12

Forum shopping, and using a declaratory judgment suit to improve bargaining leverage and

13 as a vehicle to spin positive press, are wholly improper uses of the Declaratory Judgment Act.
14 The exercise of jurisdiction under the circumstances at bar would reward tactical behavior and
15 create an incentive to file a declaratory judgment action for purposes wholly unrelated to the
16 declaration of the litigants' rights.22 The Court should not reward Veoh's tactics, but it rather
17 should decline to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction and dismiss on that second independent

It understates matters to say this case could have been brought in the Central District. But

7 for tactical maneuverings it should have been brought there. While dismissal outright is

10 convenience of the parties and witnesses.

12

Veoh Could Have Brought, And Should Have Brought, Its Action in the Central
District.

13

A transfer is only proper to a district where the action "might have been brought." 28

14 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Veoh could have brought its action in the Central District of California for three
15 independently sufficient reasons: First, UMG was subject to personal jurisdiction in the Central
16 District, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(l), 1391(c); second, a "substantial part of the events or omissions
17 giving rise to the claim occurred" in the Central District, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2); and third, "a
18 substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated" in the Central District, 28
19 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2). A transfer to the Central District meets the first requirement of 28 U.S.C.
20 § 1404(a). As noted, moreover, Los Angeles, is also Veoh's own chosen exclusive forum for
21 adjudicating matters concerning TOU that Veoh contends is central to its defense and to resolve
22 disputes concerning the Veoh services that will front and center in any litigation concerning
23 Veoh's infringing activities.

The Interest of Justice Favors Transfer to Facilitate Coordination with UMG's
Pending Actions Against Other "Video-Sharing" Services.

2

A transfer is proper where—as here—it is "in the interest of justice." 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).

3

4 The "interest of justice" analysis requires that courts consider the superior forum for '"ensuring
5 speedy trials, trying related litigation together, and having a judge who is familiar with the
6 applicable law try the case.'" Amazon.com v. Cendant Corp., 404 F. Supp. 2d 1256,1261 (W.D.
7 Wash. 2005) (quoting Heller Financial, Inc., v. Midwhey Powder Co., 883 F.2d 1286,1293 (7th
8 Cir. 1989)). The interest of justice analysis may be an independently sufficient basis for transfer:
9 '"Consideration of the interest of justice, which includes judicial economy, may be determinative
10 to a particular transfer motion, even if the convenience of the parties and witnesses might call for a
11 different result.'" Id. (quoting Regents of the University of California v. Eli Lilly and Company,
12 119 F.3d 1559, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
Transfer to the Central District is in the interest of justice because it will allow

13

14 coordination with UMG's pending actions against Grouper, Bolt, and MySpace. As the Supreme
15 Court explained, "[t]o permit a situation in which two cases involving precisely the same issues
16 are simultaneously pending in different District Courts leads to the wastefulness of time, energy
17 and money that § 1404(a) was designed to prevent." Continental Grain Co., 364 U.S. at 26; see
18 also Heller Financial, Inc., 883 F.2d at 1293 (courts should consider the benefit from "trying
19 related litigation together, and having a judge who is familiar with the applicable law try the
20 case").
Facilitating coordination of related cases within a single district precisely tracks the policy

21

22 rationale behind § 1404(a) as articulated by the Supreme Court in Van Dusen and Continental
23 Grain Co. Accordingly, transfer to a district with a pending, related case is a frequently-cited and
24 independently sufficient basis for a transfer. See also A.J. Industries, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court for

For example, mA.J. Industries, 503 F.2d at 389, the Ninth Circuit upheld a district court's

4 transfer order based in part on the existence of a pending, related action in another district. The
5 A. J. Industries Court explicitly rejected the contention that anything less than complete
6 consolidation was necessary before granting a transfer motion: "[E]ven the pendency of an action
7 in another district is important because of the positive effects it might have in possible
8 consolidation of discovery and convenience to witnesses and parties." Id. (emphasis added)
9 (citing Schneider v. Sears, 265 F. Supp. 257 (S.D.N.Y. 1967)). As Schneider explains,
10

There is a strong policy favoring the litigation of claims in the same tribunal in

11

order that: (1) pretrial discovery can be conducted more efficiently; (2) the

12

witnesses can be saved time and money, both with respect to pretrial and trial

13

proceedings; (3) duplicitous litigation can be avoided, thereby eliminating

14

unnecessary expense to the parties and at the time serving the public interest; (4)

15

inconsistent results can be avoided.

16 256 F. Supp. at 266-27. See also Durham Products, 537 F. Supp. at 1244 ("litigation of related
17 claims in the same tribunal is strongly favored because it facilitates efficient, economical and

19 inconsistent results") (emphasis added; citation and quotation marks omitted).
20

Similarly, Republic of Bolivia, 39 F. Supp. 2d at 1008, involved one of several actions by

21 various foreign governments against tobacco companies. In that case, the district court sua sponte
22 transferred the action from Texas to the District of Columbia, explaining that transfer would allow
23 for consolidation with six other pending actions by other foreign governments against tobacco

1 2439197 (S.D. Cal. 2005) (explaining that the interest of justice "strongly" favors transfers from

2 S.D. Cal. to S.D.N.Y. where similar litigation was pending).
3

Veoh's decision to file in the Southern District rather than the Central District despite the

4 detriment to overall judicial economy caused by inefficient, parallel litigations, was motivated by
5 tactical considerations that are antithetical to the interests of justice. As but a few examples of the
6 predictable inefficiency likely to result from Veoh's forum choice: two courts will need to
7 familiarize themselves with the copyright law applicable to websites; two courts will need to study
8 the case law relating to the DMCA; two courts will need to familiarize themselves with the
9 technical operation of "video sharing" sites; two courts will need to learn about the music industry
10 in general, and UMG in particular, in order to resolve issues relating to copyright ownership and
11 damages; two courts will need to hear motions for protective orders by third-parties, and third12 parties will need to bring two such motions. In short, the parallel, uncoordinated litigation of
13 similar actions with overlapping and some instances identical issues in the Southern District and
14 Central District would result in a certain but preventable waste of judicial resources, and the
15 parties' and non-parties' time and money. Accordingly, the interest of justice strongly favors
16 transfer to the Central District.
17

Finally, some courts consider relative docket congestion, measured by the median number

18 of months from filing to trial, as part of the transfer analysis, reasoning that the interest of justice
19 is served by a transfer to a relatively less congested district. See Saleh, 36 F. Supp. 2d at 1167
20 (comparing median time from filing a suit until trial in S.D. Cal. and E.D. Va., and transferring to
21 the latter). According to the most recent Annual Report of the Director: Judicial Business of the
22 United States Courts, the median time interval between filing and trial in the Southern District is
23 33.0 months, while the median time interval between filing and trial in the Central District is 21.3
24 months, a difference of over one year, or approximately 55% longer. Glatstein Decl. Ex. U (2006
25 Annual Report of the Director). The facts that the Central District is relatively less congested
26 further militates in favor of transfer. It also further belies any pretense by Veoh that it brought suit
27 to obtain a speedy resolution of an actual controversy rather than for tactical purposes.

Convenience of the Witnesses and Parties Favor Transfer.
To evaluate the convenience associated with a transfer, courts consider, (i) the convenience

2

3 of the parties; (ii) convenience of the witnesses; and (iii) ease of access to evidence. Decker Coal
4 Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 843 (9th Cir. 1986). In short, this prong requires
5 consideration of '"all... practical problems that make a trial easy, expeditious and inexpensive.'"
6 Id (citing and quoting Gulf Oil Corp. v Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947)). These factors weigh
25
7 strongly in favor of a transfer to the Central District.

The location of evidence in the Central District favors transfer.26 In re Horseshoe

8

9 Entertainment, 305 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir. 2002) (location of books and records weighs in favor
10 of transfer). Veoh identifies Los Angeles as one of its two principal offices, and many of its
27
11 employees work there, including its Senior Manager - Copyright Compliant, Stacie Simons. See

12 Glatstein Decl. Ex. HH. In particular, the Veoh's website identifies seven members of Veoh's
13 executive team, all of whom are likely to have relevant knowledge concerning Veoh's operations,
14 including for example Veoh's knowledge of widespread infringement on Veoh.com, Veoh's
15 decision to not to use filters to screen for copyright infringement, and Veoh's business reasons for
16 engaging UMG in copyright litigation. Based on publicly available information, UMG believes
17 that at least three of Veoh's top executive team members are based in Los Angeles. Glatstein
18 Decl. Exs. Q, R, S & T (Messrs. Bilger, Eisner, and Metzger). Furthermore, Veoh's Senior

Of course, as explained above, if the "interest of justice" overwhelmingly favors
transfer—as it does here—the Court may transfer the case even if the convenience of the parties
20 militates against transfer. Amazon.com, 404 F. Supp. 2d at 1261 (quoting Regents of the University
21 of California, 119 F.3d at 1565).
26

For both the UMG and Veoh witnesses residing in the Central District, litigation in the

22 Central District will plainly be more convenient. Whether it impossible for these witnesses to

Manager of Copyright Compliance, the Veoh executive who is specifically responsible for

2 handling copyright infringement notices is apparently based in Los Angeles. Glatstein Decl. Ex.

4 Veoh operates computer servers in the Central District that are used to make unauthorized
5 "transcoded" copies of infringing videos uploaded to Veoh. See Glatstein Declaration, Ex. P.

What makes the Central District more than just "convenient" for Veoh is the fact that Veoh

10 itself has chosen to make the Central District the forum for litigation of disputes concerning
11 Veoh's services and where it handles infringement claims and takes service of lawsuits. As
12 already noted, Veoh requires as a condition of using its services that its users agree to submit to
13 the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Los Angeles to resolve any issues about its TOU and the
14 Veoh services. Glatstein Decl. Ex. M (Veoh Terms of Use). According to Veoh, its TOU will be
15 a key element in Veoh's defense, and Veoh's services will obviously be the focal point a copyright
16 infringement suit, hi addition, Veoh directs the public to send notices concerning copyright
17 infringement to its location in Los Angeles, where Veoh's Senior Manager of Copyright
18 Compliance is based. See Glatstein Decl. Ex. N (Veoh Copyright Policy) (requiring that DMCA
19 notices be sent to Ms. Stacie Simmons in Los Angeles, CA, Veoh's Senior Manager for Copyright
20 Compliance). The infringement notices sent to Veoh, Veoh's policies and practices relating to
21 such notices and how they are infringement claims are handled by Veoh, are highly relevant to
22 Veoh's claimed defense under the DMCA. For example, in order for an entity to be eligible for
23 the DMCA safe harbors, it must "respond[] expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the

Ex. P (Dunning Depo.). In addition, Veoh's agent for service of process is located in the Central

2 District, meaning that Veoh itself anticipates and expects to respond to suit in the Central District.
3 Glatstein Decl. Ex. O (California Secretary of State filing). The Central District, in sum, is not
4 just "convenient" for Veoh, in the sense that it is one of the principal locations in which its
5 witnesses and records are locates, it the forum Veoh has chosen to make singularly important for
6 copyright claims and litigation.
7

The Central District is also the more convenient forum for litigation because transfer

8 would enable discovery coordination between this action, and UMG's cases against MySpace,
9 Grouper, and Bolt. The same reasoning that prompted Judge Matz to order discovery coordination
10 as among Grouper, MySpace and Bolt suits would apply to the Veoh action as well. There are
11 likely many witnesses in common as between the pending Central District litigations and the Veoh
12 suit, including third party witnesses, and coordination reduces the risks that witnesses will be
13 subject to multiple depositions. Among others, the following third parties are implicated by
14 discovery in the pending Central District cases, and it seems will likely discovery from them will
15 be relevant too in litigation between UMG and Veoh:
16

•

Providers of Advertising Services. The defendants' financial interest in the

17

infringement is a common element in the cases. See, e.g. 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(l)(B)

18

(safe harbor not available if there is "financial benefit directly attributable to the

19

infringing activity").Third party Google sells advertising to many "video sharing"

20

websites shown in connection with infringing content, and Google's agreements

21

have been a subject of discovery in the Central District and motion practice.

22

Google also provides advertising services to Veoh and it is therefore likely that it

23

will be a subject to discovery in UMG's action against Veoh.

24

•

UMG Licensees. All the defendants have sought discovery of UMG's licenses on

25

the purported basis they are relevant to damages. In addition to defendants

26

document requests to UMG seeking those licenses, Grouper has served eight

27

document subpoenas on third parties it believes have license agreements with

28

UMG, including Apple, America On-Line, YouTube, and Best Buy, among others.

See Glatstein Decl. Exs. V through CC (Grouper document subpoenas). Veoh is

2

likely to seek discovery relating to UMG's agreements too.

3

•

Filtering Companies. Veoh contends that it is implementing "state of the art

4

technologies that include filtering," In light of this allegation, Veoh's

5

communications and dealings with third party filtering companies will be a subject

6

of discovery in UMG's claim against Veoh. Defendants dealings with third parties

7

that provide filtering solutions have been the subject of discovery in the Central

8

District actions. See Glatstein Decl. Exs. DD through GG (UMG subpoenas).

9

Third parties who may have relevant evidence in all of the related cases, including but not

10 limited to providers of advertising (e.g., Google), UMG licensees (e.g., YouTube), and filtering
11 companies (e.g., Audible Magic), will all be unnecessarily inconvenienced by parallel,
12 uncoordinated litigation in two separate courts, before two separate judges. The coordination of
13 discovery that can be facilitated by transfer will reduce the likely burdens on third parties, thereby
14 serving the interests of justice.
15

Litigation in the Central District would also, of course, be more convenient for UMG's

16 witnesses as well, UMG's records and witnesses are located in the Central District, which is why
17 UMG has pursued the related actions there. As is evident, for example, from the witnesses UMG
18 identified in its Rule 26 disclosures in the Grouper, Bolt, and MySpace actions, not only are there
19 many witnesses located in the Central District, but their testimony is highly relevant to the parties'
20 claims and defenses. See Glatstein Decl. Ex. II (MySpace Rule 26 disclosures). Saleh v. Titan
21 Corp., 361 F. Supp. 2d 1152,1161 (S.D. Cal. 2005) (court should evaluate the number of
22 witnesses and the importance of their testimony).
23

In addition to witness overlap, the Veoh action will likely involve substantial and

24 sometimes identical discovery and legal issues with the pending Central District cases as is readily
25 evident by a comparison of the pleadings. Compare UMG's Complaint against Veoh (Glatstein
26 Decl. Ex. K) with UMG's Complaints Against Grouper, Bolt and MySpace (Id. Exs. A, D and G);
27 and compare Veoh's Complaint with Answers of Grouper, Bolt and MySpace (Id. Exs. B, E, and
28 H). Transfer and coordination makes it more likely those discovery and legal issues will only

need to be resolved one time by one judicial officer. This benefits overall judicial efficiency (as

2 noted above), but also benefits the parties and third-parties, who must only bring their issues to the
3 court one time for a single determination.
4

In sum, it is fair to say the Central District is overwhelmingly the most logical and

5 convenient forum for the parties, third parties, and taking into account judicial economy and the
6 interests of justice. Veoh's perceived tactical £idvantage in initiation litigation in the Southern

7 District, thereby avoiding Veoh's own exclusive forum of choice, is entitled to no weight.
8 Accordingly in the event the Court chooses not dismiss Veoh's action, it should be transferred to
9 the Central District.
10 VI.

CONCLUSION

11

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant UMG's motion to dismiss or, in the

12 alternative to transfer this action to the Central District of California.
