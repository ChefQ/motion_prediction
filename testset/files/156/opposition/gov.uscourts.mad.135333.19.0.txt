Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 6 of 25

Introduction
Defendant Samsung Telecommunications America, LLC (“STA”) hereby opposes
plaintiff Amy Rothbaum’s (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Rothbaum”) Motion for Leave to Amend her
Complaint in this action a second time (the “Motion to Further Amend”).
This is a putative nationwide class action commenced by a single claimant, Ms.
Rothbaum, involving allegedly defective “smartphones.” Plaintiff already has amended her
Complaint once as of right.

STA recently moved to dismiss the Plaintiff’s Amended

Complaint (“A.C.”) under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on multiple, independent grounds. Rather
than respond to STA’s Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff filed the present Motion to Further Amend
and attached a proposed Second Amended Complaint (“S.A.C.”). Plaintiff’s proposed Second
Amended Complaint, however, suffers from the same legal failings as her existing Amended
Complaint and, if allowed, would be subject to dismissal on the same grounds. Thus, the
Plaintiff’s Motion to Further Amend is futile and should be denied for the reasons discussed
more fully below.
Procedural Background
Ms. Rothbaum claims to be the owner of an STA “Captivate” Galaxy S smartphone,
which she reportedly purchased from an AT&T store in Holyoke, Massachusetts, in October
2010.

Smartphones are essentially handheld computers that also function as mobile

telecommunication devices.

Ms. Rothbaum alleges that her STA smartphone is defective

because it purportedly shuts down at random times. Ms. Rothbaum further alleges that STA’s
express warranty regarding her smartphone has “failed of [its] essential purpose,” even though
Ms. Rothbaum never has provided STA, as opposed to AT&T, with proper notice or the
opportunity to inspect, repair or replace her smartphone. Rather, Ms. Rothbaum immediately

-1-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 7 of 25

commenced this federal court action against STA under Massachusetts and Texas law seeking
certification of a nationwide class “of all persons who purchased a new Samsung Phone
manufactured, distributed, or sold by Samsung in the United States.”

Plaintiff’s original

Complaint was filed on March 24, 2011. She subsequently filed an Amended Complaint,
which incorporates various new allegations and claims, as of right on April 7, 2011.
On June 30, 2011, STA filed a Motion to Dismiss the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint
as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Plaintiff’s claims against STA are
fatally flawed. Even assuming that Ms. Rothbaum’s Samsung smartphone is “defective” (an
allegation that STA otherwise disputes), she never gave notice to STA, or sought any remedy
from STA, before filing suit. Thus, there is no factual basis for her conclusory allegation that
the contractual remedies offered by STA have “failed of [their] essential purpose.”

STA

stands ready to provide the Plaintiff with a fully functioning replacement smartphone pursuant
to its standard, express warranty. This is a complete remedy. Ms. Rothbaum does not have
any additional claims or rights under either Massachusetts or Texas law at the present time,
and STA respectfully submits that the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint should be dismissed in
its entirety.
After Ms. Rothbaum commenced this litigation, she sent a demand letter to STA under
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A describing the difficulties that she allegedly has
experienced with her Galaxy S smartphone and demanding relief. Consistent with its express
warranty, STA promptly responded by offering to provide the Plaintiff with a “new, fully
functioning replacement” smartphone. See pages 8-9, infra.
Ms. Rothbaum never responded to STA’s offer of a fully functioning replacement.
Instead, she filed the present Motion to Further Amend her Amended Complaint to add yet

-2-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 8 of 25

another claim against STA under Chapter 93A based on essentially the same facts as previously
alleged. At the same time, the Plaintiff filed a Motion to Extend the Time to Respond to
STA’s Motion to Dismiss until after the Court has ruled upon her Motion to Further Amend.1
STA now opposes Ms. Rothbaum’s Motion to Further Amend, which does not, as she
claims, render “moot” the arguments raised in STA’s Motion To Dismiss. See Plaintiff’s
Motion To Extend Time, ¶ 4. To the contrary, the various deficiencies in the Plaintiff’s
existing claims are not cured in her proposed Second Amended Complaint. Furthermore, the
Plaintiff’s proposed claim under Chapter 93A suffers from the same deficiencies as the
Plaintiff’s existing claims and would be subject to dismissal on the same grounds, as well as
other, additional grounds.

For these reasons, which are addressed more fully below, the

Plaintiff’s Motion to Further Amend is futile and should be denied.
The Relevant Standard
A motion for leave to amend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) may be denied where the
proposed amendment would be futile. See, e.g., Fisher v. C.R. Bard, Inc., No. 94-11324,
1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 823 (D. Mass. Jan. 3, 1996) (Wolf, J.) (granting defendant’s motion
to dismiss and denying plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to add a Chapter 93A claim on
grounds of futility); see also Brown v. Bank of America Corp., No. 10-11085, 2011 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 36235 (D. Mass. Mar. 31, 2011) (denying leave to amend on grounds of futility);
House of Clean, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., No. 07-10839, 2011 U.S. Dist
LEXIS 37298 (D. Mass. Apr. 5, 2011) (same).
As the Plaintiff’s own motion papers acknowledge, “futility” in this context “means
that the complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be

No. 17).

granted.” Plaintiff’s Memorandum In Support Of Motion For Leave To Amend (“Pl. Mem.”)
at 4; see also Abraham v. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, 533 F.3d 114, 117 (1st Cir.
2009) (affirming that leave to amend would have been futile and was properly denied);
Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.2d 617, 623 (1st Cir. 1996) (same); Boston & Me.
Corp. v. Hampton, 987 F.2d 855, 868 (1st Cir. 1993) (same).
A complaint fails to state a claim when it does not “contain sufficient factual matter,
[if] accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949
(2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). A claim must
rest on allegations of fact, not conclusory assertions. See SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436,
442 (1st Cir. 2010) (en banc). In considering a motion to dismiss or a motion to amend, the
court is entitled to rely on its experience in identifying pleadings “that, because they are no
more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950.
The court also “may disregard bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious
epithets.” Klein v. MHM Correctional Services, Inc., No. 08-11814, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
83818, at *6 (D. Mass. Aug. 16, 2010) (Wolf, J.).
A court further “may consider documents incorporated by reference in the complaint”
in resolving a motion to dismiss. Bedi v. Hewlett-Packard Co. and Staples, Inc., No. 0712318, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102672, at *2-3 (D. Mass. Nov. 17, 2008); see also Klein,
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83818, at *6 (a document “merges into the pleadings” where the
“factual allegations are expressly linked to – and admittedly dependent upon” the document).
Likewise, the court is free to consider operative legal documents that are “central to plaintiff’s
claim.” Klein, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83818, at *6 (citing Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 34 (1st Cir. 1993)).

Where an affirmative defense is “clear on the face of the plaintiff’s pleadings,” the
complaint fails to state a claim and should be dismissed. Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC, 244
F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Moreover, in light of
the Supreme Court’s decision in Twombly, “[c]laims in a complaint need not only be possible
but also plausible.” Stiegele v. Bailey, No. 05-10677, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86469, at *3
(D. Mass. Aug. 23, 2007) (Wolf, J.).
The Plaintiff’s Allegations
Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint adds little to the factual allegations of
her existing Amended Complaint. The central allegations of the Second Amended Complaint
are essentially unchanged. For the convenience of the Court, STA summarizes the Plaintiff’s
primary allegations in footnote 2, below.2

2

Plaintiff’s primary factual allegations, which STA accepts as true solely for purposes of its Motion to
Dismiss and for purposes of this Opposition, are as follows:
Smartphones are mobile telecommunication devices that also provide “advanced computing ability and
wireless internet connectivity.” Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 13. Modern smartphone handsets “have many of the
features possessed by computers,” including sophisticated “operating system (‘OS’) . . . software, consisting of
programs and data, that runs on computers and manages computer hardware resources and provides common
services for efficient execution of various application software.” Id.
Samsung’s “Galaxy S” family of smartphones utilize the “Android” operating system. Proposed S.A.C.,
¶ 14. Different models of Samsung’s Galaxy S smartphones are sold by different independent wireless service
providers, such as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon, according to their own terms and conditions. Id., ¶ 15.
The “Captivate” model, sold by AT&T, is one such model. Id. To date, more than 14 million Samsung Galaxy
S smartphones of the various types have been sold around the world, including more than one million in the
United States. Id., ¶¶ 18-19.
Plaintiff Amy Rothbaum, a New York resident, allegedly acquired a Samsung Galaxy S Captivate
smartphone from an AT&T store in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on October 16, 2010. Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 43.
Plaintiff thereafter encountered problems with her Captivate smartphone. Id., ¶ 44. She claims that her
smartphone suffers from what she terms a “Random Shut Down Defect,” which purportedly causes the handsets
to “power off, completely, when the Samsung Phones are in the ‘Standby’ mode.” Id., ¶¶ 22, 44-45. (The
“standby” mode means that the handset is not in use. Id., ¶ 22.) Plaintiff also claims that, when she “notified
AT&T of the [alleged] defect” in her Captivate, she received, from AT&T, another Samsung Captivate that
purportedly suffered from the same condition. Id., ¶ 46.

-5-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 11 of 25

In addition to the central allegations of her Amended Complaint, which are repeated in
her proposed Second Amended Complaint, the Plaintiff now proposes: (1) to assert that she
“purchased her phone separate and apart from any service contract with AT&T” (Proposed
S.A.C., ¶ 7); (2) to allege that STA sells additional models of its Galaxy S smartphones for
use with carriers Verizon, U.S. Cellular, and Cellular South (id., ¶ 25); (3) to quote seven
more anonymous Internet postings concerning these three models of STA smartphones (id.,
¶ 30(e)-(g)); and (4) to recharacterize, in a conclusory and inaccurate fashion, STA’s response
to the Plaintiff’s recent Chapter 93A demand letter (id., ¶ 66). As explained below, these
additional allegations do not cure the deficiencies in the Plaintiff’s existing claims for breach of
warranty, nor are they enough to sustain the Plaintiff’s proposed new claim against STA under
Chapter 93A. Accordingly, the Court should deny the Plaintiff’s Motion to Further Amend for
the reasons that follow.

On the basis of her particular experience with Samsung’s Galaxy S Captivate model smartphone, as well
as 32 anonymous Internet posts from other purported users of Galaxy S smartphones, Ms. Rothbaum assumes and
claims that all Samsung Galaxy S smartphones suffer from the same “Random Shut Down Defect,” which
purportedly “prevents the Samsung Phones from being used for their intended purpose.” Proposed S.A.C., ¶¶
20, 30, 44-50.
Plaintiff further claims that STA is “aware of” and “admits” the pervasive “Random Shut Down Defect”
alleged in her Complaint, citing a purported “internal service bulletin” that she apparently found on the Internet.
Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 32 (“On December 20, 2010, Samsung published an internal service bulletin that boldly
admitted that ‘some Captivate devices may experience power-off when in the standby mode.’”). A copy of that
“bulletin” is appended to this Memorandum as Exhibit A. See Bedi, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102672, at *2-3;
Klein, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83818, at *6.
On its face, however, the “internal service bulletin” cited by the Plaintiff was issued by AT&T, not
STA. Among other things, the document begins by referring to the other party as “Manufacturer(s): Samsung.”
See Exhibit A. It also describes AT&T as the “Company,” and it is directed to various categories of AT&T
distributors (i.e., “Company Owned Retail,” “Dealers,” and “Direct Fulfillment”). Id. Furthermore, if
customers reportedly experience an issue, it directs AT&T’s distributors to “please exchange their device.” Id.
AT&T’s bulletin also explicitly states that there is only a “small group of Samsung i897 Captivate devices which
may experience” the issue described, and that “[m]ost customers are not expected to see an issue.” Id. (emphasis
added).
Nowhere in her Complaint does Ms. Rothbaum allege that she ever gave notice to, sought a remedy
from, or even communicated with, STA before commencing this legal action.

Argument
I.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO FURTHER AMEND HER COMPLAINT SHOULD
BE DENIED AS FUTILE BECAUSE THE REVISED ALLEGATIONS OF HER
PROPOSED SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT DO NOT CURE THE LEGAL
DEFICIENCIES IN HER EXISTING CLAIMS.
Plaintiff has supported her Motion to Further Amend with a bare-bones Memorandum

(Docket No. 14, filed July 13, 2011) which completely ignores the various fatal deficiencies in
her existing claims that are identified in STA’s pending Motion to Dismiss. STA’s Motion to
Dismiss (Docket No. 12, filed June 30, 2011) demonstrates that the Plaintiff’s claims for
breach of implied warranty are, on their face, legally deficient and subject to dismissal as a
matter of law. Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint, however, does not cure these
deficiencies. Instead, it only highlights the extent to which the Plaintiff is unable to allege
facts sufficient to support her claims as set forth below.
A.

Plaintiff’s Claim For Breach of Warranty Under Mass. General Laws
c. 106 Still Would Fail As A Matter Of Law.

Plaintiff’s claim for breach of implied warranty fails for multiple reasons, as
demonstrated in STA’s Memorandum In Support Of Its Motion To Dismiss (“Mem. In Support
Of MTD”) at pages 5-15. The proposed Second Amended Complaint does not materially alter
the allegations of Count I, and does not cure the various deficiencies that undermine this claim.
1.

STA Still Was Not Given Proper Notice And An Opportunity To
Resolve The Plaintiff’s Claim.

Ms. Rothbaum first made contact with STA when she filed her original Complaint on
March 24, 2011, having never before informed STA that she was experiencing difficulties with
her STA smartphone. Plaintiff’s factual allegations make clear that, before filing suit, she
provided notice to AT&T, but not to STA. See Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 45 (“Plaintiff notified
AT&T”), ¶ 46 (“On March 1st, 2011, Plaintiff went to the AT&T store to inform
-7-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 13 of 25

AT&T . . . .”). Plaintiff, however, has chosen to sue STA, not AT&T. Massachusetts law
requires her to give proper notice and an opportunity to cure to STA before doing so. See
STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD, pages 8-9. Plaintiff’s failure to give STA notice and an
opportunity to cure makes it impossible, as a matter of both logic and law, for her to sustain
her allegation that STA’s standard contractual remedies necessarily have “failed of their
essential purpose.” A.C., ¶ 65; Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 65. Her allegation to that effect in both
her Amended Complaint and her proposed Second Amended Complaint is, therefore,
implausible and conclusory, and does not state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
Iqbal, supra at 4; Tambone, supra at 4.
Plaintiff’s proposed allegation that she recently sent STA a demand letter under
Chapter 93A (Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 66) does not change this result for at least two reasons.
First, under Massachusetts warranty law, Ms. Rothbaum was required to give notice to STA
before bringing suit, so that STA would have an opportunity to resolve her claim by “normal
settlement through negotiation” and without need of litigation. See Ralph Nugent v. Popular
Market, Inc., 353 Mass. 45, 50 (1967); see also STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD, page 9.
Plaintiff’s decision to shoot first and give notice later improperly and unfairly deprived STA of
that opportunity.
Second, STA actually has offered Ms. Rothbaum a “fully functioning replacement”
smartphone for her allegedly defective unit, which is, in fact, a complete remedy for her
alleged loss. See page 15, infra. On May 17, 2011, the Plaintiff sent a demand letter to STA,
which purported to notify STA of a claim under Chapter 93A. Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 66. STA
responded promptly. Plaintiff alleges that STA’s response was inadequate. Id. The proposed
Second Amended Complaint expressly relies upon STA’s response letter.

-8-

It is therefore

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

appropriate for the Court to examine the document in assessing the sufficiency of the proposed
complaint.3 A copy of STA’s response to Ms. Rothbaum’s demand is attached as Exhibit B.
STA wrote:
Samsung is prepared to provide her immediately with a new, fully
functioning replacement Galaxy S Handset in accordance with the terms
of Samsung’s limited product warranty.
Exhibit B, page 3 (emphasis added). As a matter of logic, the Plaintiff cannot seek a warranty
remedy, spurn the remedy when it is offered, and then sue for failure to provide it. See
Uchitel v. Tripler & Co., 434 N.Y.S.2d 77, 81 (N.Y. App. Term 1980) (“Case law has held
that where a buyer unreasonably refuses to permit a seller to exercise his right to cure, no
breach of warranty action premised on the defect sought to be cured may be maintained.”);

The “Internal Service Bulletin” On Which The Plaintiff Heavily Relies
Still Refutes, Rather Than Supports, The Central Allegations Of Her
Complaint.

In both her Amended Complaint and her proposed Second Amended Complaint, the
Plaintiff relies upon a so-called “internal service bulletin,” dated December 20, 2010, for the
proposition that STA “admits to having knowledge of the Random Shut Down Defect” in all of
its Galaxy S smartphones. See A.C., ¶ 32; Proposed S.A.C., ¶ 32. Because this “internal
3
See Bedi, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102672, at *2-3 (“[I]n considering the merits of a motion to dismiss,
the court may consider documents incorporated by reference in the complaint.”); see also Klein, 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 83818, at *6 (Wolf, J.) (a document “merges into the pleadings” where the “factual allegations are
expressly linked to – and admittedly dependent upon” the document).

-9-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

service bulletin” is expressly relied upon by the Plaintiff, STA submitted a copy to the Court in
support of its pending Motion To Dismiss. See STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD, pages 1213 and Exhibit A thereto. Another copy is attached to this Opposition as Exhibit A for the
Court’s convenience.
Upon examination, the “internal service bulletin” cited by the Plaintiff refutes, rather
than supports, the Plaintiff’s allegations against STA. For example, the document, on its face,
purports to be issued by AT&T, not by STA. See Exhibit A.4 It also expressly states that
there is only a “small group of Samsung i897 Captivate devices which may experience” a
problem with their smartphones, and that “[m]ost customers are not expected to see an issue.”
Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the purported “service bulletin” actually contradicts, and renders
impermissibly conclusory, the Plaintiff’s assertion that all STA Galaxy S handsets suffered
from a known defect. Cf. Proposed S.A.C., ¶¶ 1-2, 63, 72, 75, 86; see also Griffin v.
Schneider, No. 93-1253, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 15147, at *7-8 (1st Cir. June 24, 1993)
(unpublished) (upholding dismissal where the claim asserted “[a] purely conclusory statement,
contradicted by the very facts described in plaintiffs’ complaint”). Nothing in the Plaintiff’s
proposed Second Amended Complaint addresses or resolves this fatal deficiency.
3.

Plaintiff Still Has Not Alleged Sufficient Facts To Bring Her AT&T
Transaction Within The Scope Of The UCC.

STA further demonstrates in its Motion to Dismiss that the UCC, upon which the
Plaintiff’s primary claims against STA are based, simply does not govern the Plaintiff’s
purchase of her Galaxy S smartphone. See Mem. In Support Of MTD, pages 13-15. Plaintiff
4

Among other things, the “internal service bulletin” begins by referring to the other party as
“Manufacturer(s): Samsung.” See Exhibit A. It also describes AT&T as the “Company,” and it is directed to
various categories of AT&T distributors (i.e., “Company Owned Retail,” “Dealers,” and “Direct Fulfillment”).
Id. Furthermore, if customers reportedly experience an issue, it directs AT&T’s distributors to “please exchange
their device.” Id.

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

obtained her smartphone at an AT&T store. AT&T typically provides smartphones as part of
a package of telecommunications services.

Id. at 13 (citing AT&T Mobility, LLC v.

Concepcion, 131 S. Ct. 1740 (2011)). A transaction that is predominantly for services is not
subject to the UCC. Id. at 14 (citing Sebago, Inc. v. Beazer East, Inc., 18 F. Supp. 2d 70 (D.
Mass. 1998) (Wolf, J.)). Thus, the Plaintiff does not have a cognizable claim against STA
under the UCC. Id.
Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint contains one new allegation that
attempts to bring her claims within the scope of the UCC. Paragraph 7 is augmented by a
vague allegation that “Ms. Rothbaum purchased her phone separate and apart from any service
contract with AT&T.” No specifics are provided as to what arrangement the Plaintiff actually
entered with AT&T. Because the Plaintiff has inserted this ambiguous phrase in response to
the argument raised by STA’s earlier Motion to Dismiss, the Court may infer that the Plaintiff
is unwilling to plead specific facts that address it. An ambiguous allegation is not sufficient to
state a plausible claim. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (“a plaintiff's obligation to provide the
‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions”); see also
Ocasio-Hernandez v. Fortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) (“In resolving a motion
to dismiss, a court . . . should begin by identifying and disregarding statements in the
complaint that merely offer ‘legal conclusion[s] couched as . . . fact[].’”) (quoting Twombly).
The Court is entitled to disregard the Plaintiff’s new, unclear allegation unless and until
the Plaintiff clarifies precisely what she acquired from AT&T. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555;
Ocasio-Hernandez, 640 F.3d at 12. If the Plaintiff entered into a contract with AT&T to
provide telecommunications services in conjunction with her STA smartphone, then her

transaction is predominantly a purchase of services and is not governed by the UCC. Sebago,
18 F. Supp. 2d at 85.
B.

Plaintiff’s Putative Class Claims Still Are Subject To Dismissal.

STA’s Motion To Dismiss also establishes that the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint does
not plead a valid warranty claim on behalf of any class because, among other things, the
members of the putative class also have not provided STA with the required notice and
opportunity to cure. See STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD, pages 8-10.
The allegations of the Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint do not remove
this fatal flaw.

While the Plaintiff attempts to expand her proposed class definition by

including three additional models of STA’s Galaxy S smartphones, and by incorporating seven
more anonymous Internet postings pertaining to those models, the Plaintiff still has not alleged
(nor can she allege) that the individual members of the putative class have given STA proper
notice of their claims, and an opportunity to cure, in advance of filing suit. See, e.g., Drobnak
v. Andersen Corp., 561 F.3d 778, 785 (8th Cir. 2009) (dismissing class action based on
individual class members’ failure to provide required notice); In re Ford Motor Co. Speed
Control Deactivation Switch Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 05-1718, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62483,
at *17 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 24, 2007) (rejecting class action claim because “Plaintiff failed to
provide individual notice to Defendants of the alleged defect”).
Lacking any valid claim on behalf of a defined class, this case does not sustain federal
jurisdiction. See STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD, pages 15-17; see also Avritt v. Reliastar
Life Ins. Co., No. 07-1817, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51524, at *3-4 (D. Minn. June 18, 2009)
(jurisdiction under CAFA does not exist once it is determined that the complaint does not state

a class claim). Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint does not overcome the lack of
federal court jurisdiction.
C.

Plaintiff’s Claim For Breach Of Warranty Under Texas Law Still Fails For
The Simple Reason That Texas Law Does Not Govern.

STA has moved to dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for breach of the implied warranty
under Texas law for the simple reason that the State of Texas bears no reasonable relationship
to the Plaintiff’s transaction. See STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD, pages 17-18. Plaintiff is
a New York resident who allegedly purchased her STA smartphone from an AT&T store in
Holyoke, Massachusetts. Proposed S.A.C., ¶¶ 7, 43. Massachusetts choice-of-law analysis,
which is guided by the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, does not support the
application of Texas law to that transaction. See, e.g., Faherty v. CVS, No. 09-12102, 2011
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23547 (D. Mass. Mar. 9, 2011). Nothing in the Plaintiff’s proposed Second
Amended Complaint changes this analysis or the expected result.
For the foregoing reasons, all of the Plaintiff’s existing claims will remain subject to
dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) regardless of whether the Court grants the Plaintiff’s
Motion to Further Amend. Accordingly, the Court should deny that Motion as futile.
II.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO FURTHER AMEND HER COMPLAINT SHOULD
BE DENIED AS FUTILE BECAUSE THE ALLEGATIONS OF HER PROPOSED
SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT HER
PROPOSED CLAIM UNDER CHAPTER 93A.
Plaintiff also seeks to add an additional claim under Mass. General Laws Chapter 93A

based on essentially the same facts that underlie her present claims.

Plaintiff’s proposed

Chapter 93A claim necessarily fails, however, for many of the same reasons articulated in
Section I, supra, as well as for the additional reasons set forth below.

-13-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

A.

Filed 07/27/11 Page 19 of 25

Plaintiff Cannot Recover Under Chapter 93A For Breach Of Warranty.

The first branch of the Plaintiff’s proposed Chapter 93A claim alleges breach of the
implied warranty. See Proposed S.A.C., ¶¶ 73-74. This claim mirrors and is interconnected
with the Plaintiff’s existing claim for breach of warranty under Mass. General Laws c. 106, as
asserted in Count I of her Amended Complaint. Plaintiff’s claim for breach of warranty under
Massachusetts law is subject to dismissal for the reasons set forth in Section I(A), supra.
Where a Chapter 93A claim and a breach of warranty claim are “interconnected,” the
deficiencies that warrant dismissal of one claim “also warrant dismissal” of the other. See
Iannacchino v. Ford Motor Co., 451 Mass. 623, 635 (2008). Thus, the Plaintiff’s proposed
Chapter 93A claim based upon STA’s purported breach of warranty is doomed to fail along
with Count I of the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint.5
B.

Plaintiff Cannot Recover Under Chapter 93A Based On STA’s Purported
Failure To Disclose A So-Called “Random Shut Down Defect.”

The second branch of the Plaintiff’s proposed Chapter 93A claim alleges a knowing
failure by STA to disclose what the Plaintiff describes as a “Random Shut Down Defect” that
purportedly is present in all Galaxy S smartphones. See Proposed S.A.C., ¶¶ 72-75. Once
again, the Plaintiff’s claim is based on conclusory assertions that are not sustained by the

5

This result not only is legally correct, it also is logically correct. As partial justification for her
Chapter 93A claim, the Plaintiff cites Section 3.08(2) of the Attorney General’s regulations, which states:
It shall be an unfair and deceptive act or practice to fail to perform or fulfill any promises or
obligations arising under a warranty.
940 C.M.R. 3.08(2). Plaintiff cannot sustain the assertion that STA “fail[ed] to perform or fulfill any promises
or obligations arising under a warranty,” however, when the Plaintiff’s own pleadings establish that STA never
was provided with an opportunity, prior to suit, to do so.
Moreover, when the Plaintiff eventually did make a demand for relief upon STA after commencing this
lawsuit, STA promptly responded by offering to provide the Plaintiff with a “new, fully functioning replacement”
smartphone pursuant to its standard warranty. See page 9, supra. Once again, STA cannot logically be said to
have “fail[ed] to perform or fulfill any promises or obligations arising under a warranty” when the record clearly
establishes that it has expressly offered to do exactly that.

-14-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

factual allegations of the Complaint.

Filed 07/27/11 Page 20 of 25

As such, the Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended

Complaint fails to state a valid claim against STA under Chapter 93A for at least three reasons.
First, where a product is sold in millions of units, it is not at all surprising that some
units may not function properly, and that some consumers will be dissatisfied as a result.6 An
alleged failure to disclose the potential for a problem does not give rise to a Chapter 93A
violation, however.

“The Massachusetts courts have made clear that a seller’s failure to

disclose a potential problem, rather than an actual, known problem, does not amount to a
violation of Chapter 93A.” L.B. Corp. v. Schweitzer-Mauduit Int’l, 121 F. Supp. 2d 147, 154
(D. Mass. 2000) (Ponsor, J.); see also Underwood v. Risman, 414 Mass. 96, 100 (1993)
(Chapter 93A does not require disclosure “because of a suspicion or a likelihood, rather than
knowledge”).
Second, STA’s prompt response to the Plaintiff’s belated Chapter 93A demand letter
affirms that STA’s warranty program makes available to Ms. Rothbaum a complete remedy for
her alleged harm.

Plaintiff alleges that her STA product has not functioned as intended.

Ms. Rothbaum does not allege any personal injury or harm to other property; she alleges only
an economic loss. In a case where such a claim is recoverable, the measure of damages is the
difference between the actual value of the (non-compliant) product and the value paid for the
(supposedly compliant) product. Iannacchino, 451 Mass. at 631; see also Aspinall v. Philip
Morris Cos., Inc., 442 Mass. 381, 399 (2004). STA has offered to provide a “new, fully
functioning replacement” for Ms. Rothbaum’s Captivate. See Exhibit B, pages 3, 5; see also
6

Plaintiff alleges that 14 million Galaxy S smartphones have been sold. S.A.C. ¶ 19. Yet, the Plaintiff
bases her allegation that all Galaxy S smartphones are defective on a total of just 32 selected, anonymous Internet
complaints. Id., ¶¶ 30, 40. The flaws in the Plaintiff’s statistical analysis are obvious. Moreover, the so-called
“internal service bulletin,” which is expressly relied upon by the Plaintiff, explicitly states that there is only a
“small group of Samsung i897 Captivate devices which may experience” the issue described, and that “[m]ost
customers are not expected to see an issue.” Exhibit A (emphasis added).

-15-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

page 9, supra.

Filed 07/27/11 Page 21 of 25

This offer provides the full value of her alleged measure of damages.

Accordingly, there is no conceivable basis for an additional recovery by the Plaintiff under
Chapter 93A. See, e.g., Towner v. Bennington Constr. Co., No. 00-33B, 2005 Mass. Super.
LEXIS 534 (Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 12, 2005) (no violation of Chapter 93A could be found
where defendants made offers to cure, and plaintiff refused to accept the offer).
Third, a Chapter 93A plaintiff, like most other claimants, has an obligation to mitigate
his or her damages. See Burnham v. Mark IV Homes, 387 Mass. 575, 584 (1982). “The
general rule with respect to mitigation of damages is that a plaintiff may not recover for
damages that were avoidable by the use of reasonable precautions on his part.” Id. Where a
complete remedy is available, and the Plaintiff has chosen to spurn it, the Plaintiff is harmed as
a result of her own tactics, not as a result of the Defendant’s conduct. Thus the Plaintiff’s
tactical decision not to seek or accept a new fully-functioning replacement smartphone from
STA breaks the causal connection between any alleged violation committed by STA and the
alleged harm suffered by the Plaintiff, which precludes the Plaintiff from obtaining a recovery.
See, e.g., Iannacchino, 451 Mass. at 631 (recovery under Chapter 93A requires a causal
connection between the alleged violation and the alleged harm); Hershenow v. Enter. Rent-ACar Co., 445 Mass. 790, 802 (2006) (same); Markarian v. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co.,
202 F.R.D. 60, 68-69 (D. Mass. 2001) (Wolf, J.) (same).
C.

Plaintiff Cannot Recover Under Chapter 93A When Effective Relief Is
Available Without Need Of Litigation.

Lastly, the Plaintiff’s proposed claim under Chapter 93A is subject to dismissal as
completely unnecessary.

Contrary to the Plaintiff’s hyperbolic and conclusory assertions,

effective relief for the harm alleged by the Plaintiff (i.e., an improperly functioning

-16-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 22 of 25

smartphone) is available, without need of litigation, from at least two sources. Cf. Pl. Mem.
at 2.
First, Ms. Rothbaum and others who purchased from AT&T may look to the exact
same arbitration remedy that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on April 27, 2011 in
Concepcion. As the Supreme Court explained, AT&T’s arbitration agreement is “‘quick, easy
to use’ and likely to ‘promp[t] full or . . . even excess payment to the customer without the
need to arbitrate or litigate.’” Concepcion, 131 S.Ct. at 1745, 1753 (upholding provision
barring class action proceedings in AT&T customer agreement).7
Second, Ms. Rothbaum and other consumers have available the remedies offered under
STA’s express limited warranty, including repair or replacement of their allegedly
malfunctioning devices. See Exhibit B.8 If a consumer is experiencing a problem, STA needs

7

AT&T’s standard terms and conditions provide for repair and replacement of a defective wireless
device. If the customer is not satisfied, the customer may complete and submit a one-page Notice of Dispute form
posted on AT&T’s website. Concepcion, 131 S. Ct. at 1744. If, within 30 days, AT&T does not offer to settle
the claim or the dispute is not otherwise resolved, the customer may initiate an arbitration proceeding. Id. If the
arbitrator awards to the customer more than AT&T had proposed in the last written settlement offer, then the
customer may be awarded a $10,000 minimum recovery and twice the amount of the customer’s attorney’s fees.
Id. As the Supreme Court affirmed, AT&T’s arbitration agreement is “‘quick, easy to use’ and likely to
‘promp[t] full or . . . even excess payment to the customer without the need to arbitrate or litigate’ . . . [and it
provides] ‘a substantial inducement for the consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration.’” Id. at 1745, 1753
(emphasis in original). The full terms of AT&T’s standard customer agreement can be found online at
http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/articles-resources/wireless-terms.jsp.
8

STA’s full express warranty is posted online, and it is stated in a booklet that comes with the product.
The Court may consider the operative legal documents that are “central to plaintiff’s claim,” where their contents
are not in dispute. Klein, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83818, at *6 (citing Watterson, 987 F.2d at 3-4 ). We do not
expect there will be a dispute about the wording of Samsung’s express warranty. The terms of the express
warranty may be useful to the Court by way of background. They state, in part, as follows:
SAMSUNG TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMERICA, LLC (“SAMSUNG”) warrants to the
original purchaser (“Purchaser”) that SAMSUNG’s phones and accessories (“Products”) are
free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for the period
commencing upon the date of purchase and continuing for the following specified period of time
after that date: Phone: 1 Year. . . .

-17-

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 19

Filed 07/27/11 Page 23 of 25

to hear from that person directly so that STA will have an opportunity to resolve the person’s
claim by “normal settlement through negotiation,” an opportunity that is required by
Massachusetts law. See Nugent, 353 Mass. at 50; see also Delano Growers’ Cooperative
Winery v. Supreme Wine Co., 393 Mass. 666, 675 (1985); STA’s Mem. In Support Of MTD,
pages 9, 15.
Plaintiff has made a tactical decision to evade the AT&T arbitration remedy, and then
to spurn STA’s offer of a “fully functioning replacement” as provided by the warranty, in her
haste to commence expensive and time-consuming litigation. As the Supreme Court held in
Concepcion, however, the Plaintiff is not entitled to spurn available remedies in order to
further her wish to initiate a class action. This litigation is entirely meritless and unnecessary.
Nothing in the Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint makes it less so.
Conclusion
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff’s Motion To Further Amend her existing
Amended Complaint against STA should be denied.

During the applicable warranty period, SAMSUNG will repair or replace, at SAMSUNG’s sole
option, without charge to Purchaser, any defective component part of Product. To obtain
service under this Limited Warranty, Purchaser must return Product to an authorized phone
service facility in and adequate container for shipping, accompanied by Purchaser’s sales
receipt. . . . All other repaired/replaced Product will be warranted for a period equal to the
remainder of the original Limited Warranty on the original Product or for 90 days, whichever is
longer.
. . . .THIS LIMITED WARRANTY SHALL NOT EXTEND TO ANYONE OTHER THAN
THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER OF THIS PRODUCT AND STATES PURCHASER’S
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. . . .
