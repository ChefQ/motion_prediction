UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
AMY ROTHBAUM, individually and on
behalf of all others similarly situated,

CASE NO.: 11-CV-10509-MLW

Plaintiff,
vs.
SAMSUNG TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AMERICA, LLC,
Defendant.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR
LEAVE OF COURT TO FILE HER SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Amy Rothbaum (“Plaintiff”) respectfully requests leave of Court to file
the [Proposed] Second Amended Class Action Complaint annexed to her Motion as
Exhibit 1 (the “SAC”). As explained herein, Plaintiff’s request for leave complies with
the liberal standards under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (“Rule 15(a)”). Accordingly, Plaintiff
respectfully requests that this Court grant Plaintiff leave to file the SAC.
Introduction
On March 24, 2011, Plaintiff commenced this action on behalf of herself and all
persons who purchased a new Samsung Phone manufactured, distributed, or sold by
Samsung Telecommunications America, LLC (“Samsung”) (the “Class”).

Plaintiff

originally defined the “Samsung Phones” as the following Smartphones that are
manufactured by Samsung under the Galaxy S Smartphone family: Captivate™,

1

Filed 07/13/11 Page 2 of 6

Vibrant™, Fascinate™, and Epic 4G™.1 On April 7, 2011, Plaintiff filed the Amended
Complaint on behalf of the Class as defined above.
On May 17, 2011, pursuant to section 9 of the Massachusetts Consumer
Protection Act (“MCPA”), M.G.L. c. 93A, Plaintiff sent a demand letter to Samsung (the
“Demand Letter”), detailing Samsung’s violations of the MCPA. Plaintiff demanded that
Samsung provide relief to her and all Class members. On June 16, 2011, Samsung
responded to the Demand Letter in writing stating that Samsung would not meet the
demands set forth in the Demand Letter. In particular, Samsung stated that it would not
provide any relief for the millions of Class members who have been damaged by
Samsung’s unfair and deceptive business practices. Furthermore, Samsung stated that it
only would provide to Plaintiff a replacement Samsung Phone, which suffers from the
same defect as Plaintiff’s current Samsung Phone.
Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks to amend her complaint to assert an allegation,
individually, and on behalf of the Class for violations of the MCPA and to include the
additional Samsung Phones referenced in footnote 1 herein.
Argument
I.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND
SHOULD BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO RULE 15(A)
A. The Rule 15(a) Standard
Rule 15 of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure establishes a liberal standard for

allowing a party to amend its pleadings. Boston Scientific Corp. v. Radius Int'l, L.P., No.
06-10184, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36012, at *3 (D. Mass. May 2, 2008) (citing FED. R.
CIV. P. 15(a) ("[L]eave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.”).
1

Plaintiff’s continuing investigation has revealed that the Samsung Phones also include the
following models: the Mesmerize™, the Showcase™, and the Continuum™.

2

Under this standard, Courts generally permit the amendment of pleadings “unless the
opposing party makes a showing of undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice, or futility.”
Id. at **3-4 (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) and Resolution Trust Corp.
v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994)).
B. Samsung Cannot Show Undue Delay, Bad Faith, Undue Prejudice, or Futility
Plaintiff seeks to amend her complaint in order to add an MCPA claim and three
Smartphone models to the class definition. Defendant cannot show that any of these
changes are unduly prejudicial, futile, or made after undue delay or made in bad faith.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file the amended complaint should be
granted.
1.

Undue Delay

Plaintiff has not unduly delayed the filing of this motion because she makes this
motion less than three months after filing her amended complaint and only one month
after sending the Demand Letter pursuant to the MCPA claim. See O’Donnell v. Robert
Half Intern., Inc., 429 F. Supp. 2d 246, 251 (D. Mass. 2006) (finding no undue delay or
prejudice where litigation was “in the early stages and . . . not nearly ready for trial”); cf.
Human Res. Dev. Press, Inc. v. Ikon Office Solutions, Inc., 246 F.R.D. 82, 86 (D. Mass.
2007) (denying Rule 15(a) motion when Plaintiff made the motion twenty months after
filing its first amended complaint); Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of P.R., 156 F.3d 49, 52
(1st Cir. 1998) (denying Rule 15(a) motion when filed fifteen months after initial
complaint and over a year after the first amendment); Palmer v. Champion Mortg., 465
F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming denial of a motion to amend that was filed over

3

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 14

Filed 07/13/11 Page 4 of 6

fifteen months after commencement of the action and more than nine months after initial
amendment).
2.

Undue Prejudice

In light of the fact that Plaintiff makes this motion before discovery has even
begun, the proposed amended complaint would not prejudice Defendant. See O’Donnell,
429 F. Supp. 2d at 251; Ikon Office Solutions, Inc., 246 F.R.D. at 87 (holding that the
addition of a new claim after discovery has ended could prejudice the defendant); Hayes
v. New England Millwork Distributors, Inc., 602 F.2d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 1979) (holding an
amendment to the complaint would be prejudicial when parties had already completed
discovery).
3.

Bad Faith

Plaintiff’s motion is not made in bad faith because Plaintiff merely seeks to assert
an additional claim and to expand the number of phones in the Class.
4.

Futility

Under Rule 15(a), “[f]utility means that the complaint, as amended, would fail to
state a claim upon which relief could be granted."

Abraham v. Woods Hole

Oceanographic Inst., 553 F.3d 114, 117 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Glassman v.
Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 623 (1st Cir. 1996)); Boston & Me. Corp. v.
Hampton, 987 F.2d 855, 868 (1st Cir. 1993) ("[I]f the proposed amendment would be
futile because, as thus amended, the complaint still fails to state a claim, the district court
acts within its discretion in denying the motion to amend."); see also Savoy, 139 F.R.D.
at 267 (D. Mass. 1991) (“A proposed amendment is futile if it serves no ligitimate
purpose or is without legal merit.”).

Case 1:11-cv-10509-MLW Document 14

The addition of Plaintiff’s MCPA 93A claims would not be futile because the
initial complaint, as well as the proposed SAC, allege sufficient facts to state a MCPA
claim on behalf of Plaintiff and the Class. In any event, it is clear that Defendant will
move to dismiss the SAC, if Court grants Plaintiff leave to file the SAC, thus it would be
more efficient to address any issue regarding any alleged futility in connection with
Defendant’s anticipated motion to dismiss once all issues are fully briefed by both
parties.
Furthermore, leave to amend is regularly granted when a plaintiff seeks to add
MCPA claims. See, e.g., Cabana v. Forcier, 200 F.R.D. 9, 13 (D. Mass. 2001); Valerio
v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 716 F. Supp. 2d 124, 126 (D. Mass. 2010); Masciarelli v. Richard J.
Boudreau & Assocs., LLC, 529 F. Supp. 2d 183, 184 (D. Mass. 2007).
Courts also have permitted plaintiffs to amend their complaints to expand the
class definition. E.g., Bruce v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co., No. CV 09-6588, 2010 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 65779, at **10-13 (C.D. Cal. June 10, 2010) (permitting Plaintiff to file a
third amended complaint and expand the class from only California purchasers to
purchasers of 24 states); Hundt v. DirectSat USA, LLC, No. 08 C 7238, 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 50544, at **7-8 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2010) (holding that expanding the scope of the
class and adding defendants to the action would not be futile or prejudicial).
Thus, Plaintiff should be permitted to assert her rights under the MCPA and
expand the scope of the Class.
Conclusion
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend her complaint should be granted.
