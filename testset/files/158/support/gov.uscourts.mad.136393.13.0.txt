DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENAS

Defendant John Doe hereby files this motion to quash any and all subpoenas for production of
documents or duces tecum served by the Plaintiffs in the above captioned case, and as grounds therefor

avers as follows:

1. Plaintiff Improperly Joins Dozens of Individual Defendants Based on Entirely Disparate
Alleged Acts.

The Plaintiff has attempted to join at least 38 individual Defendants in this single action and an
additional 9 in nearly identical Civil Action No. 11-cv-10801. In doing so, there is significant risk of
creating an unfair process that denies individual justice to those being sued. Federal courts deciding file
sharing copyright infringement cases have repeatedly rejected such mass joinder of individuals. As one

court noted:

Comcast subscriber John Doe | could be an innocent parent whose internet access was
abused by her minor child, while John Doe 2 might share a computer with a roommate
who infringed Plaintiffs' works. John Does 3 through 203 could be thieves, just as
Plaintiffs believe, inexcusably pilfering Plaintiffs' property and depriving them, and their
artists, of the royalties they are rightly owed.

In BMG Music v. Does 1-203, the lawsuit was severed against all but the first defendant. This

language has been quoted approvingly in a number of other similar file sharing lawsuits. See West

Coast Productions, Inc., v. Does 1-353, No 3:10-cv-00094-JPB -JES (N.D. W. Va. Dec. 16, 2010), ECF
No. 45, RJN Ex. A. In that case, a motion to quash a subpoena was filed by one of the involved ISPs,
Time Warner Cable. The facts of that case were much the same as they are here, with the Plaintiff
claiming infringement of one of its works by a number of Doe defendants using the BitTorrent file
sharing protocol. The Court held that all defendants except the first Doe were improperly joined,
severed the remaining defendants from the action, and quashed the subpoenas to ISPs seeking to
identify those defendants.

The cases above are not isolated. It is possible to find nearly identical orders issued in district
courts around the country hearing similar cases. See Combat Zone, Inc., v. Does 1-1037, No. 3:10-cv-
00095-JPB -JES (N.D. W. Va. Dec. 16, 2010), ECF No. 71; see also Combat Zone, Inc., v. Does 1-245,

16, 2010), ECF No. 44.

These courts recognized that Rule 20 requires parties should not be joined unless the claims

against them arise from a single transaction or a series of closely related transactions:

Persons . . . may be joined in one action as defendants if: (A) any right to relief is

asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out

of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any

question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 20. Thus, for the defendants to be correctly joined in a lawsuit these three conditions
must be met: (1) the right to relief must be "asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the
alternative"; (2) the claim must "aris[e] out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of
transactions or occurrences"; and (3) there must be a common question of fact or law for all the
defendants. /d.

Courts have found that infringement of the same work by numerous defendants is not a
sufficient basis for joinder. See ThermaPure, Inc. v. Temp Air, Inc., No. 10-CV-4724, 2010, at *4 (N.D.
Ill. Dec. 22, 2002). Here, the court held that "Rule 20(a)'s requirement for a common transaction or

occurrence is not satisfied where multiple defendants are merely alleged to have infringed the same

patent or trademark." Jd.
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 3 of 9

Using a similar method for committing an illegal activity is likewise an insufficient basis for
joinder. See e.g., Nassau County Ass'n of Ins. Agents, Inc. v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 497 F.2d 1151,
1154 (2d Cir. 1974) (the court refused to allow 164 different companies to be joined on the basis of
using the same method to cheat agents, with the attempted joinder described as "a gross abuse of
procedure').

On the same basis as the above decisions, joinder of defendants using allegedly similar behavior
to commit copyright infringement on the Internet has been repeatedly rejected. For example, the
District Court for the Western District of Texas rejected the arguments of a recording industry plaintiff
that attempted to join 254 defendants accused of illegally downloading its music, stating:

The claim is against each defendant is individual, based on individual acts of each
defendant, and if proven, will result in unique damage claims. The defendants are not
properly joined under Rule 20.

UMG Recordings, Inc., et al. v. Does 1-51, No. A-04-CA-704 LY (W.D. Tex. Nov. 17, 2004), (RJN
Exhibit B) (the court dismissed all but the first of the defendants in the action).

In LaFace Records, LLC v. Does 1-38, No. 5:07-CV-298-BR, 2008 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 27, 2008),
the court severed a lawsuit alleging the defendants had used the same ISP as well as the same file
sharing networks to infringe the plaintiff's copyright in the same way. The court explained that
"committing the same type of violation in the same way does not link defendants together for purposes
of joinder." /d. at *2. Similar orders have been issued in BMG Music v. Does 1-4, No. 3:06-cv-01579-
MHP, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53237, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. July 31, 2006), Interscope Records v. Does 1-
25, No. 6:04-cv-197-Orl-22DAB, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27782 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1, 2004), Twentieth
Century Fox Film Corp. v. Does 1-12, No. C-04-04862 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2004).

In supporting its argument for joinder in this action, the Plaintiff makes a claim of "a massive
conspiracy" among the Defendants to infringe its copyrighted work. Complaint at J 152. This claim
relies extensively on discussion of the technical aspects of the BitTorrent file sharing protocol as
constituting a "swarm", and asserting that this type of computer communication joins defendants
together. However, Plaintiff's claims are substantively the same as many of the above cited cases also
involving the BitTorrent protocol. Other courts have rejected attempts to distinguish BitTorrent based
file sharing as a unique situation. See Lightspeed v. Does 1-1000, No. 1:10-cv-05604 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 3,
2011). Here the court said:

...the plaintiff argues that this case is distinguishable because BitTorrent involves more
than "`merely committing the exact same violation in the same way' or using the same

3

 
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 4 of 9

ISP as was alleged in those cases." Plaintiff's Opposition, Dkt. #45 at 13. But this
statement ignores that the BitTorrent protocol is a peer-to-peer file sharing system, which
was at issue in the LaF ace Records case. Thus, the court finds the plaintiff's attempt to
distinguish its case from the others cited above unpersuasive and that Rule 20(a)(2)(A)

has not been satisfied.
Td.

Even if the requirements for permissive joinder under Rule 20(a)(2) had been met, this court
would nonetheless have broad discretion to refuse joinder under Rule 21 in the interest of avoiding
prejudice and delay, ensuring judicial economy, or safeguarding the principles of fundamental fairness.
See, e.g., Intercon Research Assocs., Ltd. v. Dresser Indus, Inc., 696 F.2d 53, 57-58 (7th Cir. 1982)
(citing Desert Empire Bank v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 623 F.2d 1371, 1375 (9th Cir. 1980)) ("[A] trial court
must... determine whether the permissive joinder of a party will comport with the principles of
fundamental fairness."); see also Acevedo v. Allsup's Convenience Stores, 600 F.3d 516, 521 (Sth Cir.
2010); Morris v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 37 F. Supp. 2D 556, 580-81 (E.D.N.Y.1999), and Coleman
v. Quaker Oats, 232 F.3d 1271, 1296 (9th Cir.2000)).

The joining of thirty-eight unrelated defendants in a single action may be more convenient and
less expensive to file for the Plaintiff, but the established principles of joinder must nonetheless apply.
Other courts considering mass copyright infringement matters have noted and rejected similar tactics as
attempts to avoid paying multiple filing fees. See, e.g., General Order, UMG Recordings, Inc., et al. v.
Does 1-51, No. A-04-CA-704 LY (W.D. Tex. Nov. 17, 2004, (RJN Exhibit B) (ordering severance of
254 defendants sued in four cases before it, and noting that: "[t]he filing fees for the recent four cases

totaled $600, whereas the filing fees for 254 separate cases would have been $38,100."').
2. Plaintiff Has Not Made the Requisite Prima Facie Case for Each Defendant.

Importantly, the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient prima facie evidence to show that any of
the John Doe Defendants infringed the Plaintiff's copyrighted work. In the Declaration of Malte
Dinkela, the Plaintiff offers only general and conclusory assertions by its agent. The declaration
explains that said agent "has licensed a proprietary technology that provides an effective means of
detecting the unauthorized distribution of movies and other content over P2P networks". Dinkela Decl.
at {| 7. No evidence has been entered in support of such generalized claims beyond the word of Malte

Dinkela, nor does the remainder of the declaration provide sufficient documentation to independently

verify the accuracy of the methodology.

 
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 5 of 9

In part, Dinkela documents that as part of Excubitor's investigative process:

...we obtain the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of a user offering the file for download.
Although users' IP addresses are not automatically displayed on the P2P networks, any
user's IP address is readily identifiable from the packets of data being exchanged. ... We
also collected other publicly available information that is designed to help Plaintiff
identify the infringer. ... We then created evidence logs for each user and stored all this

information in a database.
Dinkela Decl. at [22-23

Plaintiff only summarily provides a list of IP Addresses, Hit Dates, ISPs, and Estimated Cities for each
Defendant in the case. See Dinkela Decl. at Exhibit A. The declaration merely suggests that further
evidence has been gathered for each Defendant while failing to actually provide such. With this meager
evidentiary showing, Plaintiff does not meet its prima facie burden for purposes of expedited discovery.

Instead of the generalized and conclusory showing made to date, Plaintiff must present specific
evidence resulting from its investigation, for each Defendant. At a minimum, it must present competent
evidence of how the proprietary technology upon which it relies actually functions. Further, it must
fully document the investigative methodology used to a degree of completeness that would actually
allow Defendants (and the Court) to evaluate and potentially argue against the Plaintiff's conclusions.
Absent this, Defendants who believe they have been falsely accused of downloading the pornographic
work in question have no clear method to rebut the Plaintiff's arguments.

A requirement of specific evidence for each defendant would be consistent with the
requirements set forth by other courts in similar cases. Other courts have found that the prima facie
burden was met with the submission of computer screen shots showing the IP address of each
defendant, copies of data or computer screen shots showing the activities of the "proprietary
technology" used, and data to show that the downloaded movie was the same as the Plaintiff's original
work, for each of the defendants in the case. See, e.g., Elektra Ent. Group, Inc, 2004 WL 2095581, at
*4. This evidence, if it exists, would already be available to the Plaintiff prior to discovery and should
thus have been provided as part of its prima facie showing. See Dendrite Int'l, Inc. v. Doe No. 3,775
A.2d 756 (N.J. App. 2001), at 769-70 (presenting allegations of a link between Defendant's posts and
stock prices without proof of causation was not sufficient to survive the heightened discovery standard
provided by the First Amendment).

Further, even if we are to assume that Plaintiff has been completely accurate in its list of IP
addresses through which they claim infringement occurred, little method has been presented as to how

Plaintiff intends to discover the individual who was using that IP address at the time of infringement.
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 6 of 9

Plaintiff's instant subpoenas will provide it with only the contact information of the persons on record
with the ISPs for the accounts associated with these IP addresses. Any number of individuals may have
access to this account. Another court noted that such complaints often ignore the fact that "IP
subscribers are not necessarily copyright infringers. ... The infringer might be the subscriber, someone
in the subscriber's household, a visitor with her laptop, a neighbor, or someone parked on the street at
any given moment." VPR Internationale v. Does 1-1017, 2:11-cv-02068-HAB -DGB #15 (C.D. Ill. Apr
29, 2011)

The Plaintiff does further state in its memorandum in support of the motion that it may seek to
"depose and and/or issue interrogatories to the Internet subscriber identified by each ISP in order to
determine whether or not they are the proper defendant in this action". In this statement, the Plaintiff
makes it appear that they have satisfied the concerns expressed in VPR Internationale v. Does 1-1017
while actually suggesting a scenario that amounts to a practical impossibility. Suppose that an example
in the VPR case held true and the actual copyright infringer could be found to be a neighbor of one of
the identified IP subscribers. Home computer networking equipment is typically not equipped with the
kind of logging functions that would have preserved any evidence of this event, especially given that
some of the alleged infringements are said to have occurred as long as six months before the issuance
of this complaint. The IP subscriber is thus likely to possess no further evidence related to the
infringement that could be discovered through said depositions or interrogatories.

However, should there be a lack of further evidence found in discovery, this does not prove the
innocence of the IP subscriber either. Said individual may very well have infringed the Plaintiff's work
but proceeded to deny doing so. Given the lapse of time between the alleged incidents and the issuance
of this complaint, any tangible evidence of the event may have long since been intentionally or
unintentionally destroyed. Thus, the evidence that the Plaintiff claims to seek may very well be
nonexistent and unrecoverable even by the most extensive of discovery procedures.

How then would the Plaintiff intend to proceed in identifying the proper defendants in this
action? They have presented no credible strategy for obtaining evidence of infringement beyond that
which they already possess and the IP subscriber information sought in the instant subpoena to ISPs.
Given that Plaintiff has not yet even conclusively met its prima facie burden for further discovery, it is
highly unlikely that this alone would be sufficient to succeed at trial.

Indeed, given the significant challenges faced by the Plaintiff, one can find very few examples

where cases of this type have been litigated successfully. It may be that Plaintiff's best and in some
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 7 of 9

cases only path to prevail in this action is for the IP subscriber to simply admit responsibility. As will
be discussed in the following section, Plaintiff may be in a strong position to coerce Defendants to do

so regardless of the actual strength of its evidence.

3. Plaintiff is attempting to use the discovery process only to unmask and coerce pretrial

settlements from IP subscribers.

It must be emphasized that the work in question in this case, "Down on the Farm", is in fact a
gay pornographic production. While such works are no less entitled to copyright protection than others,
the potential effect on the defendants in this action calls for extreme caution before revealing their
identities.

While we cannot know for certain how the Plaintiff intends to proceed, there is a common
course of action that has been repeated throughout many of the above cited file sharing cases. Should
Plaintiff succeed in identifying the IP subscribers the likely course of action is to contact each of the
individuals and demand a monetary payment for settlement of the claims in question. Although the
damages claimed in this action amount to at least $150,000 per defendant, settlement demands could be
made for as little as several hundred to several thousand dollars. Once given this payment the Plaintiff
would proceed to amend its complaint to dismiss the associated Defendants.

If Defendants do not capitulate to the demands of the Plaintiff they would likely then be named
specifically in this lawsuit. Identification as a party in this lawsuit amounts to a public accusation that
the Defendant has downloaded and viewed gay pornography. Clearly, at a minimum, this would be a
source of embarrassment for many of the Defendants. The implications with respect to the sexual
orientation and habits of the Defendants may further cause significant reputational harm and intrusion
upon their privacy. As such, the Court must proceed with caution before allowing the Defendants to be
unmasked.

Should a Defendant wish to fight the Plaintiff's claims he would have to overcome not only this
potential harm but the potentially high cost of hiring counsel to litigate the matter. Even if Defendant
believes himself to be innocent of the claims, many would view a settlement offer for some few
thousand dollars from the Plaintiff as comparatively attractive. The Hon. Harold A. Baker, in denying
interlocutory review of a dismissal of a similar case in the Central District of Illinois, pondered:

Orin Kerr, a professor at George Washington University Law School, noted that whether

you're guilty or not, "you look like a suspect." Could expedited discovery be used to

7
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 8 of 9

wrest quick settlements, even from people who have done nothing wrong? The
embarrassment of public exposure might be too great, the legal system too daunting and
expensive, for some to ask whether VPR has competent evidence to prove its case.

VPR Internationale v. Does 1-1017, 2:11-cv-02068-HAB -DGB #15 (C.D. Ill. Apr 29, 2011)

In this situation, one must ask whether the Plaintiff's quest for information is primarily an effort
to use the judicial process to coerce settlements before the flaws in its case can be revealed. This
strategy would be consistent with many other lawsuits filed by media producers against tens of
thousands of individuals. Porn industry representatives have shown that they are keenly aware of their
power for coercion in these cases. The company Pink Visual, which had recently held a retreat with
other industry representatives to discuss content protection, stated in an interview with Agence France

Presse:

"Tt seems like it will be quite embarrassing for whichever user ends up in a lawsuit about
using a popular shemale title," Vivas said, using a term that refers to a person who has
female features but male genitalia. "When it comes to private sexual fantasies and
fetishes, going public is probably not worth the risk that these torrent and peer-to-peer
users are taking."

Porn Titans Come Together to Expose Pirates, THE INDEPENDENT (Sept. 27, 2010)

http://www. independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/porn-titans-come-together-to-expose-
pirates-2090786.html.

Some copyright lawyers have echoed the idea that such cases are primarily an effort to coerce
John Doe defendants to quickly settle. One commenter stated "I would suppose that most people would
want to settle rather than being named in a lawsuit of this nature." (John Council, Adult Film
Company's Suit Shows Texas Is Good for Copyright Cases, TEXAS LAWYER, Oct. 4, 2010)

This lawsuit must rest on the merits of the Plaintiff's claims against each individual Doe
defendant, not the risk of public exposure of these claims. At a minimum this Court should require that

Plaintiff resolve the cited evidentiary shortcomings before being allowed further discovery.
Conclusion

The Plaintiff certainly has every right to seek redress for its allegations of copyright
infringement, but it must follow the procedures and due process requirements applicable to all civil
litigation. Disregard for these procedures would further disenfranchise the Defendants who are now at
risk of having their identities exposed and then finding that a settlement is more economically feasible

than presenting a defense against this action, even if they may have broken no laws or may have other
Case 1:11-cv-10802-WGY Document 13 Filed 06/21/11 Page 9 of 9

meritorious defenses against Plaintiff's claims. The interests of justice are not served if this Court
allows its discovery mechanisms to be used as part of a shakedown against anonymous Internet
subscribers.

Defendant John Doe therefore respectfully urges this court to quash the Plaintiff's subpoenas on
the grounds that (1) it has improperly joined many individual defendants together without meeting the
joinder requirements of Rule 20, (2) it has not provided sufficient evidence to the Court to make its
required prima facie case against each of the individual Defendants, and (3) it will likely use
information from these subpoenas as part of a campaign to coerce settlements from IP subscribers

without clear evidence of the subscriber's actual responsibility.
