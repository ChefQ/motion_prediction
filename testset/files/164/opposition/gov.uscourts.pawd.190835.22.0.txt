PLAINTIFFS' MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiffs, by and through their undersigned counsel, respectfully submit this

Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss filed by WHAM-a, Inc., ("WHAM-O").
1. Introduction

This is a cause of action for Defendant WHAM-a's false marking of its FrisbeeCI Flying
Disc and Pro Classic FrisbeeCI as patented in violation of 35 U.S.C. § 292, a qui tam statute.

This matter is now before the Court on WHAM -0' s Motion to Dismiss ("Motion") this case

based on arguments that (i) Plaintiffs have set forth an inadequate pleading under Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure ("FRCP") 9(b) and 12(b)(6), (ii) Plaintiff FLFMC, LLC
("FLFMC") lacks Article III standing, and (iii) finally, that Section 292(b) violates the

Appointments and Take Care Clauses of Article II of the Constitution. Each of these
asserted grounds for dismissal lacks merit, and the Motion should be denied.

First, in support of its Motion seeking dismissal for inadequate pleading, WHAM-O

argues that Plaintiff FLFMC has not adequately alleged WHAM-O's intent to deceive the

public with particularity. However, in United States ex reI. FLFMC, LLC, ex reI. v. Ace
Hardware Corp., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45453 (W.D. Pa. May 7, 2010), this Court denied

842560.1

Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 22

Filed 07/14/10 Page 2 of 16

an analogous motion to dismiss in which the defendant there raised the same FRCP 9(b) and

12(b)(6) issue presented by WHAM-O in the present Motion. In FLFMC v. Ace, this Court

held that allegations similar to those made against WHAM-O in this case were sufficient
under the pleading standards as enunciated in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544

(2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009). Ace, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45453.

at *8. Moreover, in this case, the allegations regarding WHAM-a's intent to deceive are

even more apparent than the allegations made against the defendant in FLFMC v. Ace,
because in addition to the allegations that WHAM -0 continued marking and advertising its
FrisbeeCI Flying Disc twenty-five years after the expiration of one patent, Plaintiff FLFMC

also alleges that WHAM -0 marked and advertised its Pro Classic FrisbeeCI with a second
patent number that did not cover the product. Accordingly, WHAM-O's motion under FRCP
9(b) and 12(b) (6) must be dismissed.

WHAM-O argues next that FLFMC lacks Article III standing because FLFMC has
not alleged any direct injury and it cannot sue based solely upon the government's

generalized sovereign right to have Section 292 obeyed. As noted by the Supreme Court in

Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex reI. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765
(2000), an alleged violation of the false marking statute itself constitutes a sufficient injury

to the United States to provide standing for FLFMC. Plaintiff FLFMC has alleged that
WHAM-O violated Section 292 by marking, mismarking and/or advertising its FrisbeeCI

Flying Disc and Pro Classic FrisbeeCI Disc with patent numbers which either expired
twenty-five years ago or never applied to the product with the intent to deceive the public.
Complaint, irir 16, 17, 19, and 20. Such injury having been pled, Plaintiff FLFMC now

properly invokes the standing of the United States as the assignee of its claims against

-2-

842560.1

Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 22

Filed 07/14/10 Page 3 of 16

WHAM-a. Accordingly, the portion of WHAM-O's Motion seeking dismissal based upon
a lack of Article III standing must be dismissed

Finally, WHAM-a's assertions that Section 292 is unconstitutional - because it
violates the "Take Care" and "Appointments" Clauses of Article II of the United States

Constitution - are equally without merit. The Appointments Clause does not apply to
Section 292 because it does not create "officers" as described within that clause, and is thus

inapplicable. Further, Section 292 does not violate the Take Care Clause because, inter
alia, its enactment by the First Congress and its long history strongly supports its
constitutionality. For the reasons that follow below, WHAM-O's arguments in support of its
Motion are unsupported by the facts or the law, and its Motion must be denied.
11. PlaintiffFLFMC Has Sufficiently Pled WHAM-O's Intent To Deceive

1. PlaintiffFLFMC is not required to plead intent to deceive with paricularity.
WHAM-O argues that plaintiff FLFMC's Complaint should be dismissed because it fails

to meet the heightened pleading standards of FRCP 9(b) with respect to WHAM-a's intent to
deceive. In support of its argument, WHAM-O directs this Court to the decision in Juniper

Networks v. Shipley, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40978 (N.D. CaI. May 13, 2009). Juniper,
however, is not controllng in this District, and there are conflcting views on whether or not a
false marking claim is subject to the heightened pleading requirements of FRCP 9(b). See, e.g.,

Third Party Verification, Inc. v. Signaturelink, Inc., 492 F. Supp. 2d 1314, 1327 (M.D. Fla.
2007) ("There is no case law that has required the Rule 9 level of pleading to claims for false
marking."); Song v. PIL, LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38874 at 4 (N.D. IlL. Apr. 14, 2010)
("cours are split on (whether claims under § 292 are subject to the heightened pleading

requirements ofFRCP 9(b))."). More importantly, in FLFMC v. Ace, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

-3-

842560.1

Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 22

Filed 07/14/10 Page 4 of 16

45453, this Cour held that Plaintiff FLFMC's similar allegations there were sufficient under
FRCP 8(a), in spite of defendant's arguments that FRCP 9(b) applied.

Furher, Plaintiffs should not be required to plead with particularity in this case,
especially at this stage, given the nature of a false marking claim and Plaintiffs' lack of access to

the required information. Evidence which has been deemed relevant to the defendant's requisite
intent, in most cases, comes directly from the defendant or its agents. See, e.g., DP Wagner Mfg.
v. Pro Patch Sys., 434 F. Supp. 2d 445, 456-458 (S.D. Tex. 2006) (proffering the deposition

testimony of the defendant's President in support of its motion for sumar judgment on its
false marking claim.); Smith Welding Equip. Corp. v. Pearl, 21 F.R.D. 196, 197 (W.D. Pa. 1956)

(proffering affidavits of company offcials in support of its motion to dismiss defendant's false
marking counterclaim.). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Complaint should not be held subject to FRCP
1
9(b), and WHAM -0' s Motion to Dismiss on this ground should be denied.

2. Plaintiffs' complaint is suffcient to satisfy the standards set forth in FRCP 8(a).

WHAM-O also alleges that Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to adequately plead WHAM-a's

intent to deceive under the default standards of FRCP 8(a). Curiously, WHAM-O makes no
reference to this Cour's decision in FLFMC v. Ace, although it is directly on point. In FLFMC
v. Ace, Plaintiff FLFMC similarly alleged that the defendant continued to mark a product with a

well-expired patent, implying that the item was patented with the intent to deceive. Defendant
filed a motion to dismiss arguing, inter alia, that Plaintiff FLFMC failed to adequately plead the

To the extent WHAM-O suggests that Plaintiffs' are required to plead with particularity because some
courts have required such pleading under the false claims act, the Third Circuit, in u.s. ex reI. Schmidt v. Zimmer.
Inc., 386 F.3d 235, 242 n.9 (3d Cir. 2004), noted that "defects as to particularity (in a complaint under the False
Claim Act) could be cured easily by amending the complaint to specify the precise (J reports that were alleged
to be false." (emphasis added). Thus, even if

this Cour were to apply the heightened pleading standards of

the false

claims act in this case, the fact that Plaintiffs have identified the precise patents, products, and the entity responsible
for the false marking, arguably, would be sufficient.

defendant's intent to deceive. In response, this Cour, after a thorough analysis of the Supreme
Cour's decisions in Twombly and Iqbal, held:

the allegations of the complaint, when taken as tre, allows the Cour to draw a
reasonable inference that (defendant) was at least complicitous in the alleged false
marking of the (product) in violation of 35 U.S.C. § 292, a qui tam statute, and
that the complaint, although not overly detailed, meets the standards enunciated in
Twombly and Iqbal.

2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45453, at *7-*8.

Thus, in this case, Plaintiffs are only required to allege the existence of a
misrepresentation by WHAM-a, coupled with sufficient evidence that the misrepresentation was

made with knowledge of its falsity2. Clontech Labs., Inc. v. Invitrogen Corp., 406 F.3d 1347,
1352 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (such allegations are "enough to warrant drawing the inference that there
was fraudulent intent.").

These required elements are set forth in the Complaint. First, FLFMC alleges "the fact of

misrepresentation" by identifying the FrisbeeCI Flying Disc, marked with u.s. Patent No.
3,359,678 ("the '678 patent"), being sold by WHAM-O twenty-five years after the expiration of

the patent. Complaint, irir 6, 8-13. Additionally, FLFMC alleges another misrepresentation by
identifying the Pro Classic FrisbeeCI Disc as being mismarked with Patent No. 3,354,678 ("the

'4,678 patent") and being sold by WHAM-a. Complaint irir 12, 14, 16, 19. Second, FLFMC
alleges that WHAM-a's misrepresentations "imply(ed) that the items were patented" and that

WHAM-O did so "for the purpose of deceiving the public." Complaint irir 16, 17, 19, 20.

2 WHM-O attempts to suggest that more is required at this stage by referencing a portion of

the Federal Circuit's
opinion in Pequignot v. Solo Cup Co. which states that "knowledge that a marking is false is insufficient to prove
intent if (Defendant) can prove that it did not consciously desire the result that the public be deceived." Pequignot

v. Solo Cup Co., 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 11820 (Fed. Cir. June 10,2010). (emphasis added). That decision,

however, is inapposite because it is addressing the burden of proof required at the summary judgment stage, rather
than what constitutes a suffcient pleading. Moreover, it is well settled that "(t)he mere assertion by a part that it
did not intend to deceive wil not suffice to escape statuory liabilty." Clontech Labs.. Inc. v. Invitrogen Corp., 406

F. 3d 1347, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

WHAM-O's repeated sale and advertisement of

Filed 07/14/10 Page 6 of 16

the mismarked Pro Classic FrisbeeCI Disc, and

its repeated sale and advertisement of the FrisbeeCI Flying Disc marked with a patent number
that expired twenty-five years ago, coupled with its purchase by and independence from Mattei
(Complaint, irir 8-10), are enough to "warant drawing the inference that there was fraudulent

intent." Clontech Labs., 406 F.3d at 1352. Accepting Plaintiffs' allegations as true, this Cour
can reasonably infer that WHAM-O falsely marked its frisbees with the intent to deceive.

Furher, WHAM-a's intent to deceive can be inferred from the significant length oftime

that the FrisbeeCI Flying Disc has been marked with the number of an unenforceable patent.3

The present case is not a matter of a false marking suit filed one day after the expiration of a
patent; WHAM-O obtained independence from Mattei in 1997, thirteen years after the patent at

issue here expired. Complaint ir 10. Reasonable due dilgence by the investors who purchased
WHAM-O should have revealed that WHAM-O was marking the FrisbeeCI Flying Disc with an

expired patent number. WHAM-a's continued use of the patent thirteen years after it became
independent, and nearly twenty-five years after the patent at issue expired, clearly is suffcient to

create the inference of WHAM-a's intent to deceive the public. Accordingly, WHAM-a's
Motion to Dismiss on this ground also should be denied.
III. Plaintiff FLFMC Satisfies All Requirements For Article III Standing
1. It is well-settled that qui tam plaintiffs have article III standing.

In Vermont Agency, 529 U.S. 765 (2000) the Court made clear that Plaintiff FLFMC

has standing to pursue this action. After properly identifying § 292 as a qui tam statute, 529

3 See DP Wagner Mfg. v. Pro Patch Svs., 434 F. Supp. 2d 445, 452 n.3 (S.D. Tex. 2006) ("The patent marking

statute (35 U.S.c. § 287) requires marking only with the patent number. Because issue date is not given, the
expiration date cannot readily be determined. Therefore, a strong case can be made for finding culpable
mismarking when a person intentionally continues to mark articles with the number of an expired patent.") quoting
Chisum on Patents, § 20.037(7(c)(vii), at 20-657.

842560.1

Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 22

Filed 07/14/10 Page 7 of 16

U.S. at 769 n.1, the Court went on to address the standing requirements under such qui tam
statutes. The Court concluded that the plaintiff relator need not demonstrate a direct injury

to himself in order to proceed with the qui tam action. Instead, the United States' injury
suffices to confer standing. Id. at 772-778. Such injury may take the form of "the injury to

(the United States') sovereignty arising from violation of its laws and the proprietary injury
resulting from the alleged fraud." Id. at 765. A qui tam statute effects a "partial assignment"

from the government to the qui tam relator, which thereby confers standing upon the relator
to file suit. Id. at 773.

Although the Court's holding was limited to qui tam relator plaintiffs under the
Federal Claims Act, numerous courts have held that qui tam plaintiffs bringing a § 292
claim also have Article III standing. See e.g., Juniper Networks v. Shipley, 2010 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 24889, *17 (N.D. Ca. 2010), quoting Vermont, at 773-74 (Analyzing a motion to

dismiss in a false marking case and noting "in qui tam actions, the injury need not be
suffered by the relator; injury in fact to the United States is sufficient."); Pequignot v. Solo
Cup Co., 640 F. Supp. 2d 714, 717 (E.D. Va. 2009) ("First, at least facially, by allowing
'any person' to sue for false marking, § 292(b) confers standing on anyone to sue,

regardless of whether he or she has been personally affected by the false marking... .").

Moreover, there is a breadth of authority, pre-dating Vermont, holding that a qui tam

§ 292 plaintiff has Article III standing. See, e.g., Patents: False-Marking Litigation, 26 Fed.
Proc. L. Ed. § 60: 1239 ("Any person may sue for the penalty provided by the false-marking

statute, and a party need not have suffered any special or private injury from the act alleged

as constituting a violation of the act in order to sue to recover the penalty. "); Am. Jur. 2d,
Patents, § 1087 (same); Fear v. Horner Sales Corp., 10 F.R.D. 25, 27 (W.D. Pa. 1950)

(plaintiff "brings (the false-marking action) as informer and need not show that he has been
injured by the acts of

the defendant"); Calderwood v. Mansfield, 71 F. Supp. 480,481 (D.C.

CaI. 1947) ("(I)njury to private interest is not pertinent.").
The Supreme Cour's decision in Vermont Agency and its progeny are dispositive. By its

express terms, § 292 effects an assignment of the United States' claims to the qui tam plaintiff,

and, thus, Plaintiff FLFMC must only demonstrate that the United States has suffered a
constitutionally cognizable injur. As described below, WHAM-a's violation of § 292 plainly

constitutes an injur in fact to the United States, and thus Plaintiff FLFMC has standing to
pursue this action.
2. Plaintiffs' allegations are suffcient to establish the United States' injur in fact.

WHAM-O contends that without an allegation of injur in fact, Plaintiff FLFMC fails to
establish an interest of

the United States that is assignable to a qui tam plaintiff. To the contrary,

however, "(t)he actual or threatened injury required by Ar. III may exist solely by virtue of

statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of

which creates standing." Warh v. Seldin, 422 U.S.

490, 500 (1975); Vermont Agency, 529 U.S. at 773. In determining whether there is injur in
fact, "(a)t the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's

conduct may suffce, for on a motion to dismiss (the cour) 'presume(s) that general allegations

embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claims.'" Luian v. Defenders of

Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (citations omitted). This Cour specifically addressed this

same issue in FLFMC v. Ace, and held that "it would be premature to decide (defendant's)
standing and other issues at this early stage of the proceedings, without allowing plaintiff an

opportunity to develop the record through the discovery process." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
45453 at *8.

Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 22

Notwithstanding the above, WHAM-O argues that under Stauffer v. Brooks Brothers,
must plead and establish an

Inc., 615 F. Supp. 2d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), a qui tam relator plaintiff

injur in fact to the United States to have standing. WHAM-O's reliance upon Stauffer is

misplaced for the following reasons. First, the Stauffer decision is not controllng in this District,

and this Cour previously declined to adopt its rationale in FLFMC v. Ace. Additionally,

insisting that a qui tam relator plaintiff under § 292 must establish injur in fact to the United
States - beyond the clearly recognized injur in fact resulting from WHAM-a's violation of

the

statute - is contrar to the Federal Circuit's controlling interpretation of the statute. Forest

Group, Inc. v. Bon Tool Co., 590 F.3d 1295, 1302-1303 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (identifying false

markings as causing injur by, inter alia, deterring innovation and stiflng competition;
dissuading potential competitors from entering the market; deterring scientific research; and also

as causing unecessary investment in design around and costs incured in analyzing the validity
or enforceability of a patent; "these injuries occur each time an article is falsely marked')
(emphasis added). Thus, insofar as the Federal Circuit has interpreted Congress' intent in

enacting the statute to prevent injuries to the public, and the statute permits "any person" to bring

such an action, a violation of the statute itself is the only injury a qui tam relator plaintiff need
allege.

Finally, the Stauffer rationale is also not controllng because the District Cour decision

has been appealed to the Federal Circuit. Furher, as a result of the District Cour's holding in
Stauffer, the United States attempted to intervene to, "defend the statute and the governent's
interest in seeing (§ 292) enforced." Stauffer v. Brooks Brothers, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

51166 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 15,2009). Moreover, it is noteworthy that, although it has been over

a year since the Stauffer decision was issued, no other cour has adopted the Southern District of
false marking suits fied4.

New York's reasoning - despite a significant increase in the number of

As the Cour in Vermont Agency observed, the injur to the United States' sovereignty
arising from the violation of its laws unquestionably gives rise to an Aricle III injur to the

Governent. 529 U.S. at 771. Plaintiff FLFMC has alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that

WHAM-O violated § 292 and fuher has requested a declaration of said violation within its
prayer for relief. See Complaint, irir 6-8, 12-14, 16, 17, 19,20. Presuming Plaintiffs' pleadings
are true, as this Court is required to do, and recognizing violations of the laws of the United

States, themselves, as being an injury to the United States, Plaintiff FLFMC has sufficiently
alleged that the United States has suffered injury in fact for purposes of Aricle III standing.

Therefore, under the Supreme Court's decision in Vermont Agency and its progeny, an

alleged violation by WHAM-O of Section 292 is sufficient to establish an injur in fact for
Aricle III standing. See also, "Brief of the United States As Intervenor Defending The

Constitutionality Of 35 U.S.C. § 292" ("U.S. Brief') at 10-11, (arguing §292 qui tam relators

have Aricle III standing in accordance with Vermont Agency, for a sovereign, rather than
propriety, injur to the Governent.) (Attached hereto as Ex. "A"). Accordingly, WHAM-O's

Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to establish an injur in fact must be
denied.
3. The iniur in fact provides the necessary nexus between marking and har.

marking on the products at issue to any har, Plaintiff FLFMC has failed to meet the causation

and redressability requirements of Ar. III standing. Again, WHAM-O's argument misses the

mark and ignores the fact that §292 assigns the governent's injury to a relator, who then
attempts to redress said injur by bringing a qui tam action.

As previously noted, the Supreme Cour in Vermont Agency held that injur to the
United States' sovereignty due to a violation of its laws is a cognizable injury. 529 U.S. at 771.
Thus, in this case, Plaintiffs' allegation that WHAM-O falsely marked its frisbees in violation of

§ 292 is sufficient to establish a nexus between WHAM-a's wrongful conduct and the alleged
injur. Put another way, the causation is inherent in the offending act. Lastly, there is not

redressability issue because "(t)he qui tam action is for redress of an injur to the governent"
Stalley v. Methodist Healthcare, 517 F.3d 911, 917 (6th Cir. 2008), and as such, the Cour,

consistent with the action taken in Ace should not grant WHAM -0' s Motion to Dismiss for lack
of standings.

4. PlaintiffFLFMC has prudential standing to bring this action.
WHAM-O argues that FLFMC lacks prudential standing because it is merely asserting a

generalized right to have Section 292 obeyed. WHAM-a's argument lacks merit. First, §292
specifically provides that "any person" may bring this action and it is well settled that an
"explicit grant of authority to bring suit 'eliminates any prudential standing limitations and

significantly lessens the risk of unwanted conflct with the Legislative Branch.'" FEC v. Atkins,

524 U.S. 11, 20 (1998) (dismissing defendant's prudential standing challenge and noting
"Congress has specifically provided in FECA that "any person who believes a violation of this
5 To the extent WHAM-O suggests Plaintiff FLFMC must allege more facts regarding injur to the public or
competition to establish Ar. II standing, dismissal of this case at this stage would not be the appropriate action.

Rather, Plaintiff FLFMC should be provided an opportity to develop more information through discovery. See
FLFMC v. Ace, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45453.

Act.. has occured, may fie a complaint with the Commission." § 437g(a) (1)), quoting, Raines
v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811,858 n.3 (1997).

Moreover, as previously stated, the Supreme Cour's decision in Vermont Agency and its

progeny establishes that § 292, by its express terms, effects an assignment of the United States'
claims to the qui tam plaintiff. In Sprint Communs. Co., L.P. v. APCC Servs., 554 U.S. 269, 128

S. Ct. 2531, 2545 (U.S. 2008), the Supreme Cour held that a plaintiff bringing an action based

upon a third-pary's injur, which was subsequently assigned to the plaintiff, establishes
prudential standing because plaintiff "in other words, (is) asserting first-pary, not third-party,
legal rights." Accordingly, Plaintiff FLFMC has satisfied the prudential standing requirement
and WHAM -0' s Motion on this ground must be denied.

IV. Section 292(b) Does Not Violate Article II of the Constitution
1. Section 292 does not violate the Appointments Clause.

WHAM-O asserts that Section 292 violates the Appointments clause because its vests
a private party, as opposed to the Executive Branch, with the primary responsibility for

conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating public rights.
WHAM-a's argument is incorrect because qui tam relators under §292 are not "officers" as
defined by that clause.
The Appointments Clause provides, in part, that "Congress may by Law vest the

Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the

Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments." U.S. Const. Art. II, § ci. 2. It is well
settled, that the term "officer" as used in the Appointments Clause "embraces the ideas of
tenure, duration, emolument, and duties, and the latter were continuing and permanent, not

occasional or temporary." United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511-12, 25 L. Ed. 482

(1878). None of

Filed 07/14/10 Page 13 of 16

these "ideas" are present in Section 292.

More directly, a Section 292 relator's position is without tenure, duration, continuing
emolument, or continuous duties. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Appointments Clause is

inapplicable. See Auffmordt v. Hedden, 137 U.S. 310, 327, 34 L. Ed. 674, 11 S. Ct. 103
(1890) (noting, "(the merchant appraiser's) position is without tenure, duration, continuing

emolument, or continuous duties, and he acts only occasionally and temporarily. Therefore,

he is not an 'officer' within the meaning of the clause of the constitution referred to. "); See

also, Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp., 252 F.3d 749, 757-58 (5th Cir. 2001) (en banc)
(holding the FCA's qui tam provisions do not violate the Appointments Clause because qui

tam relators are not officers of the United States.); United States ex reI. Taxpayers Against
Fraud v. General Elec. Corp., 41 F.3d 1032, 1041 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding Appointments

power);U.S. Brief, Ex. A at 24-28. (same).
2. Section 292 does not violate the Take Care Clause of Art. II.

WHAM-O argues next that Section 292 violates the Take Care Clause because it does not

contain sufficient safeguards to ensure that the Governent maintains sufficient control over the
litigation pursued under Section 292 by a qui tam relator. In support of its argument, WHAM-O

relies heavily upon the decision of the United States Cour of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in
United States ex reI. Kelly v. Boeing Co., 9 F.3d 743 (9th Cir. 1993), which held that the False

Claims Act (FCA), another qui tam statute, did not violate Ar. II because the FCA contains a
number of procedural safeguards that provide the Executive oversight and controL. There is no
need, however, for this Cour to look to the Ninth Circuit for any guidance on this issue, because

of the long history of the Cour's enforcement of qui tam actions and the more recent district

cour decisions in Zoio Solutions, Inc. v. Stanley Works, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46407 (N.D. Il.

May 12, 2010) and Pequignot v. Solo Cup Co., 640 F. Supp. 2d 714 (E.D. Va. 2009), both of
which specifically addressed and rejected the precise arguments raised by WHAM-O. Indeed,
although WHAM-O contends that the Governent lacks control over Section 292 actions, it fails

to acknowledge that the governent, on at least six occasions, has intervened solely to defend
the constitutionality of Section 292. See Ex. A, and "Supplemental Brief Of The United States
As Intervenor Defending The Constitutionality Of 35 U.S.C. § 292" ("U.S. Supp. Brief."), at p.
1. (Attached hereto as Ex. "B").

The District Court in Solo Cup rejected the exact argument advanced by WHAM-O for the

following reasons. First, the Cour in Solo Cup noted: that the long history of qui tam statutes

was "highly persuasive as to their constitutionality" because "(i)t is unlikely that the framers

would have written a Constitution that outlawed this practice, and then immediately passed
several qui tam laws that unconstitutionally encroached on Executive Power." 640 F.Supp. at
727. See also, U.S. Brief, Ex. A, pgs. 5-10 (providing a detailed discussion of

the history and

enforcement of qui tam actions); Kinglsey Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U.S. 436, 441 (1957)
(acknowledging Congress' option to use qui tam actions as a means to deter proscribed conduct.)
Additionally, in Solo Cup the District Cour held that "it is not necessary for S292(b) to

meet the demanding standard applied by the Supreme Cour in Morrison to withstand an Aricle

II challenge, given that the intrusion of &292(b) into the Executive Branch power is minor in

comparison6." 640 F.Supp. at 727 (citing Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp.. 252 F.3d 749,
755 (5th Cir. 2001) (en bane) (holding that "the Morrison control test.. is simply not dispositive
6 Specifically, the cour in Solo Cup noted that unlike the prosecutor in Morrison, a § 292 relator pursues a civil
action, not a criminal one; the relator under § 292(b) must do so at his own expense; and that § 292(b) does not bar
the governent from initiating its own action, criminal or civil, to enforce the substantive false marking provisions
of § 292(a). Solo Cup, 640 F. Supp. 2d at 726-727.

of (a challenge to the FCA), as it involves an entirely different lawsuit and requires entirely

different control mechanism.")).

Lastly, the Solo Cup court recognized that:

(D)espite the lack of control mechanisms in § 292(b) itself, the
Executive Branch is not without the ability to assert its interests in
a § 292(b) qui tam action. The clerks of federal cours are required
to notify the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark
Offce of any patent suits within one month of their filing. See 35
U.S.C. § 290. The United States may intervene in a qui tam action,

either as of right, see Fed. R Civ. P. 24(a)(2), or with a cour's
permission, see Fed R. Civ. P. 24(b). ... Finally, the United States
may apply for a protective order if the relator's action interferes
with a governent investigation or prosecution. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(c).

Id. at 727-728; See also, U.S. Brief, Ex. A, at 23-25, fn. 11 (listing additional safeguards); U.S.

Supp. Brief, Ex. B. at 7-8 (arguing that certain statutes and FRCPs provide the governent with
"adequate and necessary tools" to exert control over a §292 action.).

Similarly, in Zoio Solutions, Inc. v. Stanley Works, the District Cour for the Northern

District of Ilinois, sua sponte, rejected the same Aricle II argument presented by WHAM-O
stating that the Federal Circuit, in Bon Tool, effectively answered and rejected the defendant's

argument because "the Federal Circuit ... would have been obligated to raise and address (a
subject matter jurisdictional problem) sua sponte. In a sense, then, that cour's failure to speak

of any potential problem of unconstitutionality could be viewed as confirming the validity of the

statute." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46407, *6 (N.D. IlL. May 12, 2010). Likewise, the Federal
Circuit declined to raise any issues with Section 292 and Ar. II in the Solo Cup appeal, even

though the issue was specifically addressed by the district court. Solo Cup, 2010 U.S. App.
LEXIS 11820 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Accordingly, WHAM-a's Motion to Dismiss must be denied as
to WHAM-O's constitutional arguments as welL.
