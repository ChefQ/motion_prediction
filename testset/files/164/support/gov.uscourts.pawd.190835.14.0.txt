MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS
I. INTRODUCTION

This putative gui tam action under the False Patent Marking statute, 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 292
("0x00A7292") should be dismissed for the following independent reasons:

A. Plaintiff FLFMC, LLC ("Plaintiff") was required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and Bell
Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) ("Twombly"), to state with particularity facts giving
rise to a strong inference that Wham-O acted with the intent to deceive the public. The cases
hold that a plaintiff has a "high bar" to prove such intent to deceive and that a defendant's mere
knowledge that a product is marked with an expired patent is insufficient. Plaintiff's sparse and
conclusory "information and belief" complaint is insufficient.

B. Plaintiff lacks both constitutional and prudential standing and cannot carry its
burden to meet the constitutional minimum of standing under either a facial or factual challenge
to subject matter jurisdiction. Facially, Plaintiff alleges no injury or harm. A newly formed
entity, it simply cannot plead any set of facts showing that it has suffered a "concrete and
particularized" injury, nor does it or can it allege such an injury was inflicted on the United

States. Thus, it cannot withstand a factual challenge as well. Plaintiff cannot establish
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 2 of 17

prudential standing because a qui tam plaintiff cannot sue based only on the government's
generalized sovereign right to have 0x00A7292 - a criminal statute - obeyed.

C. Section 292(b) is unconstitutional because it presumes that a plaintiff could
enforce the rights of the United States government, without its participation or supervision. The
Constitution, under Article II's "Take Care" and "Appointments" clauses, requires the Executive
Branch, through the Attorney General, to retain control over all litigation commenced with the
government as the real party in interest. Accordingly, 0x00A7292(b) cannot survive constitutional
scrutiny. Plaintiff has no injury in fact and seeks to enforce only the "sovereign's interest" in a
criminal statute, without basic safeguards or controls to ensure government oversight.

II. LEGAL ARGUMENT

A. The Complaint Must Be Dismissed As Plaintiff Has Failed To Plead Its
Claim With Specificity.

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), this Court is required to dismiss the complaint in the
absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory. Marangos v. Swett, 341 Fed.
Appx. 752, 755 (3d Cir. 2009).

To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient
factual matter, accepted as true, to "state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face." [Twombly], at 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.
Ed. 2d 929. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff
pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.
Id., at 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929. The plausibility
standard is not akin to a "probability requirement," but it asks for
more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.
Ibid. Where a complaint pleads facts that are "merely consistent
with" a defendant's liability, it "stops short of the line between
possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief." /d., at 557,
127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (brackets omitted).

Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 8. Ct. 1937, 1949-50 (U.S. 2009). Accordingly, "[t]hreadbare recitals of

the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. . .
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 3 of 17

Id., at 1950. The Court is not required to accept as true "bald assertions, unwarranted inferences,
or sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations." Jn re Rockefeller Ctr.
Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002).

Moreover, the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) apply to the case at bar.

The false marking statute is a fraud-based claim, which is subject
to the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
9(b). See Berson v. Applied Signal Technology, Inc., 527 F.3d 982,
987 (9th Cir. 2008) ("[p]laintiffs must `state with particularity facts
giving rise to a strong inference' that defendants acted with the
intent to deceive....") (emphasis added); see also Vess v. Ciba-
Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103-04 (9th Cir. 2003) (claims
that are "grounded in fraud" or that "sound in fraud" are subject to
Rule 9(b)). . .conclusory allegations that [the defendant]
"knew" his reference to the patents was "false" are thus
insufficient to plead an intent to deceive under section 292(a).

Juniper Networks v. Shipley, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40978 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2009) (emphasis
added).

Plaintiff ignores the requirements articulated in Zwombly and Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) by
failing to "state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference" that Wham-O acted with
the intent to deceive or with deliberate recklessness as to the possibility of misleading the public.
See Institutional Investors Grp. v. Avaya, Inc., 564 F.3d 242, 267 (3d Cir. 2009).

As recently confirmed by the Federal Circuit in Pequignot v. Solo Cup Co.,

The bar for proving deceptive intent here is particularly high, given
that the false marking statute is a criminal one, despite being
punishable only with a civil fine. See S. Rep. No. 82-1979, 1952
U.S.C.C.A.N. 2394 (1952) ("This is a criminal provision."); see
also Clontech [Labs., Inc. v. Invitrogen Corp.], 406 F.3d [1347],
1352 [(Fed. Cir. 2005)] (`The statute supplies a civil fine.").
Because the statute requires that the false marker act "for the
purpose of deceiving the public," a purpose of deceit, rather than
simply knowledge that a statement is false, is required. 35 U.S.C.
0x00A7 292(a). ... Thus, mere knowledge that a marking is false is
insufficient to prove intent if Solo can prove that it did not
consciously desire the result that the public be deceived.
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 4 of 17

---- F.3d ----, 2010 WL 2346649 at *6 (Fed. Cir. June 10, 2010).
Here, Plaintiffs sparse 20 paragraph complaint alleges only that:
16. After November 1, 1985, Defendant or its agents marked
upon, affixed to, or used in advertising in connection with items,
including at least the Frisbee(R) Flying Disc, phrases referring to the
`678 patent, implying that the item was patented.

17. Defendant or its agents did so for the purpose of deceiving
the public.

(Compl., J] 16-17).' These conclusory allegations, made without any underlying facts from
which the Court may reasonably infer that Wham-O acted with the requisite state of mind, are
insufficient under Rule 8, let alone the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). See Jn Re
Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1418 (3d Cir. 1997) (`While state of mind
may be averred generally, plaintiff must still allege facts that show the court their basis for

399

inferring that the defendants acted with `scienter.'"). Rather, they are precisely the "formulaic
recitation of the elements of a cause of action [that] will not do....". Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1965.

B. The Action Should Be Dismissed As This Court Lacks Subject Matter
Jurisdiction.

1. Standing In Federal Court
"[N]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of
government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or
controversies." Common Cause vy. Pennsylvania, 558 F.3d 249, 258 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting
DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 341 (2006)). "Ifa dispute is not a proper case or
controversy, the courts have no business deciding it." /d. at 258 (citation omitted). That case or

controversy requirement is satisfied "only where a plaintiff has standing." Sprint Comme 'ns Co.

 

' Plaintiff repeats identical averments in Paragraphs 19 and 20 as to the `4,678 patent.

4
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 5 of 17

v. APCC Servs., Inc., 128 0x00A7. Ct. 2531, 2535 (2008). Standing has both constitutional and
prudential components. Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 128 (2004). Simply put, standing to
sue in federal court is a threshold issue for a plaintiff to bring suit, an "irreducible constitutional
minimum," and the burden of every plaintiff in federal court to prove. Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).

2. Plaintiff Lacks Facial and Factual Standing to Bring This Action.

Plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing and because it is an issue of subject matter
jurisdiction it cannot be waived. Revell v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 321 Fed. Appx. 113, 116;
Storino v. Borough of Point Pleasant Beach, 322 F.3d 293, 296 (3d Cir. 2003)). This Court is
authorized to dismiss a lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1);
Fields v. Pa. Dep't of Corr., 2006 WL 1285030 at *1 (E.D. Pa. May 5, 2006). In determining
whether Plaintiff has standing, the Court "must consider its specific allegations and the relief
which it seeks." Revel/, 321 Fed. Appx. at 116 (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95,
105-06 (1983).

Additionally, the Court must distinguish between facial and factual challenges to its
subject matter jurisdiction. Fields, WL 1285030 at *1 (citing Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &
Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977)). "In a facial attack, a defendant argues that the
plaintiff did not properly plead jurisdiction" whereas "a `factual' attack asserts that jurisdiction is
lacking on the basis of facts outside of the pleadings." Fields, WL 1285030 at *1 (citing Smolow
v. Hafer, 353 F. Supp. 2d 561, 566 (E.D. Pa. 2005) and Mortensen, 549 F.2d at 891). As
explained by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania:

In a facial attack, a defendant argues that the plaintiff did not
properly plead jurisdiction, and the Court must consider the

allegations in the complaint as true. However, a "factual" attack
asserts that jurisdiction is lacking on the basis of facts outside of
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 6 of 17

the pleadings, and it invokes the Court's authority to consider any
affidavits and other evidence submitted. For both categories of
attack, a plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction.
Smolow, 353 F. Supp. 2d at 566 (internal citations omitted). Plaintiff fails to satisfy subject

matter jurisdiction for facial and factual reasons.

(a) Plaintiff Does Not Have Constitutional Standing to Bring This
Lawsuit.

In order to have constitutional standing, a plaintiff must adequately establish:

(1) an injury in fact (i.e., a "concrete and particularized" invasion
of a "legally protected interest"); (2) causation (.e., a "fairly
traceable" connection between the alleged injury in fact and the
alleged conduct of the defendant); and (3) redressability (i.e., it is
"likely" and not "merely speculative" that the plaintiff's injury will
be remedied by the relief plaintiff seeks in bringing suit).
Sprint Comme 'ns Co., 128 8. Ct. at 2535.
(i) Plaintiff Has Not and Cannot Plead an Injury-in-Fact.
The first requirement - an injury in fact - is the "hard floor of Article III jurisdiction that
cannot be removed by statute." Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1152 (2009);
Stauffer v. Brooks Bros., 615 F. Supp. 2d 248, 253-54 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (dismissing with
prejudice a false marking complaint because the relator (a lawyer) failed to establish standing)."
A qui tam plaintiff tries to vindicate the government's rights, provided it has itself suffered an
injury in fact causally connected to the defendant that is likely to be redressed by the court.
Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex. rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 774 (2000).
Plaintiff must thus allege "an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete

and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical." Lujan, 504 U.S.

at 560. Because "[federal] judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against

 

* The Brooks Brothers decision, which is consistent with the well-developed body of law addressed in this Brief, is
currently before the Federal Circuit. See Stauffer v. Brooks Bros., Inc., App. Docket Nos. 09-1428, -1430, -1453.

Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 7 of 17

injury to the complaining party,... [federal jurisdiction] can be invoked only when the plaintiff
himself has suffered some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal
action." Newark Branch, NAACP vy. Harrison, 907 F.2d 1408, 1412-18 (internal citation omitted)
(quoting Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 (1973)).

The Brooks Brothers decision is compelling and analogous to the events giving rise to
this lawsuit. There, a patent attorney filed suit against Brooks Brothers for alleged false patent
marking of bow-ties with an expired patent in violation of 0x00A7292. 615 F. Supp. 2d at 250. The 40
page complaint failed to allege with any specificity an actual injury to any individual competitor,
to the market for bow ties, or to any aspect of the United States economy. /d. at 255.

Noting that plaintiff's allegations were made largely on "information and belief' with no
factual support (id., at 252), the Court held that plaintiff failed to allege a "cognizable injury in
fact to the United States or such an injury to the public that has been assigned to him by the
government, and therefore held that he lacked constitutional standing to bring a claim under
0x00A7292." Id. at 255. Even gui tam plaintiffs "must satisfy the `irreducible constitutional minimum'
of standing." /d. at 253 (citing Vermont Agency, 529 U. S. at 771)). The court reasoned that
plaintiffs alleged injury was insufficient to establish an injury-in-fact to the public and therefore,
he did not have standing to bring suit on behalf of the United States. /d., at 255:

That some competitor might somehow be injured at some point, or
that some component of the United States economy might suffer

some harm through defendants' conduct, is purely speculative and
plainly insufficient to support standing.

Id. Because plaintiff failed to establish that Brooks Brothers' alleged "conduct caused an actual
or imminent injury in fact to competition, to the United States economy, or the public that could
be assigned to him as a qui tam plaintiff or be vindicated through this litigation," plaintiff lacked
standing to proceed. /d., at 256.

The facts here are even more compelling. The complaint there was 40 pages long

7
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 8 of 17

whereas Plaintiff's complaint is barely four; and, unlike Plaintiff who has not alleged injury, the
Brooks Brothers plaintiff made generalized assertions that competition in the marketplace had
been quelled by false marking. However, Plaintiff has not alleged any injury to itself or even to
a competitor. Indeed, it is factually impossible for Plaintiff to contend that it was injured by
Wham-O's alleged conduct when Plaintiff had only existed for 61 days at the time that it filed
this lawsuit (FLFMC, LLC was created January 29, 2010). See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 566
("Standing is not `an ingenious exercise in the conceivable ... [but] requires ... perceptible harm."
(citations omitted)). Plaintiff also does not allege any injury to the United States resulting from
the alleged false marking, demonstrating that it does not have standing to bring this case.
Plaintiff may rely upon the Pequignot v. Solo Cup Co., 640 F. Supp. 2d 714 (E.D. Va.
2009)* decision which intimated that a gui tam plaintiff might have standing under 0x00A7292 based
solely on an alleged violation of the law. Solo Cup, 640 F. Supp. 2d at 720. However, the Court
did not address in detail the standing issue. Rather, the court in Solo Cup focused on whether: (1)
0x00A7292 was a qui tam statute; and (2) 0x00A7292 violated Article II of the constitution. /d., at 720-728.
Solo Cup's passing reference to standing when ruling on other issues does not cure
Plaintiff's lack of standing here. Moreover, the Solo Cup court's comment actually conflicts
with the Supreme Court decisions and other authority discussed above. Solo Cup's reasoning
incorrectly interpreted the United States Supreme Court's discussion of gui tam standing under

the False Claims Act in the Vermont Agency case.

The Court in Solo Cup contended that Vermont Agency did not distinguish sovereign
injury from proprietary injury when it actually did. /d., at 724, n.15. The Supreme Court
reasoned that "the injury to its sovereignty arising from the violation of its laws (which suffices

to support a criminal lawsuit by the Government) and the proprietary injury resulting from the

 

> The Solo Cup court ultimately granted summary judgment in Solo Cup's favor holding that the plaintiff could not
show that Solo Cup acted with the intent to deceive. See Pequignot v. Solo Cup Co., 646 F. Supp. 2d 790 (E.D. Va.
2009). The Federal Circuit recently affirmed in part and vacated in part the district court's decision to grant
summary judgment in favor of the Solo Cup. --- F.3d ----, 2010 WL 2346649 (Fed. Cir. June 10, 2010).
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 9 of 17

alleged fraud" are different concepts. Vermont Agency, 529 U. S. at 771. Importantly, according
to the Supreme Court, only the proprietary injury could be assigned to a private party for
constitutional standing purposes. /d. at 773 ("effecting a partial assignment of the Government's
damages claim"). However, Vermont Agency did not hold that a sovereign injury could be
assigned to a private party for constitutional standing purposes. The Brooks Brothers court noted
that specific fact when it also distinguished the So/o Cup decision:

Even assuming that a violation of the United States' "sovereign
interest" in seeing the law followed could be an assignable interest
potentially vindicated by a qui tam action, in order for section 292 to
be violated, a defendant must not only have falsely marked an
unpatented article but must have done so "for the purpose of deceiving
the public." 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7292. Accordingly, .. .absent an alleged injury
in the form of deception to the public, a plaintiff has not alleged a
violation of the law, and therefore there exists no corresponding harm
to the United States' "sovereign interest." Thus, allegations such as
plaintiff's that a defendant improperly marked an unpatented article as
patented, standing alone, neither alleges a violation of section 292 nor
pleads an injury in fact to the sovereign interest of the United States
assignable to a gui tam plaintiff. Moreover, the Court doubts that the
Government's interest in seeing its laws enforced could alone be an
assignable, concrete injury in fact sufficient to establish a qui tam
plaintiff's standing. See FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 24, 118 S. Ct.
1777, 141 L. Ed. 2d 10 (1998) (An "abstract" harm such as "injury to
the interest in seeing that the law is obeyed ... deprives the case of the
concrete specificity" necessary for standing) (collecting cases).

Brooks Brothers, 615 F. Supp. 2d at 254, n.5.

The purported violation of 0x00A7292 here is the precise type of sovereign injury which does
not seek to redress or deter acts of alleged financial fraud. Therefore, plaintiff's bringing 0x00A7292
actions do not enjoy the same type of gui tam standing as a plaintiff under the FCA. Section 292
invokes the Government's sovereign interest where the FCA protects the proprietary interest. As
such, plaintiffs bringing lawsuits under the FCA (such as those in Vermont Agency) have
standing without injury to themselves because they are protecting the proprietary interest of the
United States. However, plaintiffs bringing 0x00A7292 claims invoke (at best) only the sovereign

interest and therefore must meet the regular standing requirements which include injury-in-fact.

9
Case 2:10-cv-00435-AJS Document 14 Filed 07/02/10 Page 10 of 17

0x00A7292(b) does not confer standing on those without injury. As such, FMFLC cannot circumvent
Article HI standing by merely characterizing the action as "gui tam." See, e.g., United States ex
rel. Berge v. Bd., of Trustees, 104 F.3d 1453, 1458 (4th Cir. 1997) (stating that the government,

as the real party in interest under the FCA, must still have suffered an injury in fact.).
(ii) Plaintiff Cannot Establish Causation or _a_Redressable
Remedy.

Since Plaintiff has not (and cannot) establish an injury-in-fact to itself or the United
States, the standing analysis need not go further. Indeed, Plaintiff cannot establish a causal link
between an injury-in-fact and redressability because no injury-in-fact exists under the standing
analysis. For the same reason, Plaintiff cannot show that a remedy is likely to redress the alleged
injury - the third prong of the constitutional standing analysis - because it would still lack
standing as the remedy that it seeks (monetary penalties plus costs and attorney's fees) would not
redress any alleged harm resulting from false marking. Rather, Plaintiff is attempting to profit
from a perfect storm: a relatively forgotten statute coupled with a recent favorable decision from
the Federal Circuit providing for large potential windfall financial recoveries.

(ii) Plaintiff Cannot Demonstrate Prudential Standing.

Even if Plaintiff could meet its burden of establishing constitutional standing, it must also
demonstrate prudential standing. Plaintiff must show that: (1) it asserts its own rights, not those
of third parties; (2) its claim is not a general grievance shared equally and generally by all or a
large class of citizens; and (3) its injury is within the zone of interests the statute or common law
claim intends to protect. E/k Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004).

The Supreme Court has routinely "refrained from adjudicating `abstract questions of
wide public significance' which amount to `generalized grievances,' pervasively shared and most
appropriately addressed in the representative branches." Valley Forge Christian Coll., 454 U.S.
464, 475 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499-500 (1975)). See also Massachusetts v.
