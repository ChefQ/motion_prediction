NOTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION

TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1, defendant Wham-O, Inc.
("Wham-O") submits this Notice of Constitutional Question.

Wham-O is challenging the constitutionality of the gui tam provisions of 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7
292. Specifically, Wham-O asserts that, as drafted, 35 U.S.C. 0x00A7 292(b) violates the "Take Care"
and "Appointments" clauses of Article II of the United States Constitution as it fails to provide
for the necessary supervision of the gui tam litigant who is purporting to enforce a criminal
statute on behalf of the government.

Wham-O has asserted the above constitutional challenge in connection with its Motion to
Dismiss the Complaint filed in the above captioned matter. A copy of the Motion to Dismiss is

attached hereto as Exhibit "A".

Respectfully submitted,
BABST, CALLAND, CLEMENTS & ZOMNIR, P.C.
