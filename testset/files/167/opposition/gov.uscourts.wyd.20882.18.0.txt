INTRODUCTION

This case arises out of a contract entered into by Plaintiff Georgia-Pacific and
Defendant Diversified, whereupon Diversified would provide vehicles and drivers to pick up
and transport materials from Georgia-Pacific. Defendant Wilshire Insurance Company, Inc.
("Wilshire") provided insurance coverage for Diversified, whereupon Georgia-Pacific was
to be named an additional insured under Diversified's policy.

On May 5, 2006, Diversified arranged for one of its carriers, R. Waltman
Trucking, to transport a load from the Georgia-Pacific facility in Lovell, Wyoming. Truck
driver Richard Waltman fell from his truck while tarping his load at the Lovell facility.
Subsquently, Richard Waltman and R. Waltman Trucking sued Georgia-Pacific for
negligence. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Georgia-Pacific tendered the defense and
requested indemnity from Diversified. Diversified denied that tender and request.

Georgia-Pacific filed a declaratory judgment action against Defendants
Diversified and Wilshire for their failure to defend and indemnify Georgia-Pacific. In
response to the Complaint, Wilshire filed an Answer and Diversified filed a motion to
dismiss.' Diversified asserts it does not owe indemnity or a defense to Georgia-Pacific since
Waltman alleges Georgia-Pacific was negligent. Diversified goes onto assert, without any

factual or legal basis, whatsoever, that Georgia-Pacific was negligent and caused the injuries

 

' Wilshire filed a notice of joinder in Diversified's motion to dismiss, but did not submit any legal or factual
basis to dismiss the individual claims asserted against it.

to Waltman. Instead of providing any factual or legal basis, Diversified simply relies on
Waltman's Complaint, which alleges only negligence against Georgia-Pacific. Apparently,
Diversified did not, or refused to consider, the Answer of Georgia-Pacific which denied
negligence, and affirmatively asserted that it did not owe a duty to Waltman, the employee
of an independent contractor injured in the performance of his job. Further, Diversified
ignored Boswell v. CETCO, 236 F.R.D. 682 (D. Wyo. 2006), where the United States
District Court for the District of Wyoming specifically held that an owner/operator is not
required to provide fall protection to an independent truck driver tarping his load.

Diversified's argument that it does not owe Georgia-Pacific indemnity for its
own negligence fails if Georgia-Pacific did not owe a duty to Waltman and, therefore, was
not negligent. Diversified asks this Court to ignore Boswell and Wyoming premises liability
case law, and find as a matter of law that Georgia-Pacific was negligent. The Court cannot
do that. However, the Court can find, applying Boswell and the litany of other Wyoming
cases, that Georgia-Pacific did not owe a duty to Waltman and, therefore, was not negligent.
Consequently, Diversified must indemnify Georgia-Pacific.

In addition to the duty to indemnify, Diversified has a separate independent
duty to defend Georgia-Pacific, regardless of negligence. In denying the tender of defense,
Diversified has breached that term of the contract. Further, Diversified was required to
obtain appropriate levels of insurance and require its carriers to obtain appropriate levels of

insurance. Diversified breached the contract when it failed to ensure R. Waltman Trucking

had the proper insurance. Since discovery has not been conducted, it is unclear whether
Diversified obtained the appropriate levels of insurance for itself, naming Georgia-Pacific as

an additional insured of the policy, or if it misrepresented the same to Georgia-Pacific.
BACKGROUND

On March 23, 1999, Georgia-Pacific, Corporation', entered into a Contract
Carriage and Brokerage Agreement ("Contract") with Diversified Transfer and Storage, Inc.
See Exhibit A attached to Complaint. In that Contract, Diversified agreed to provide
transportation services for the shipment of products for Georgia-Pacific. The Contract set
forth numerous provisions regarding the duty to defend, indemnify, and to obtain insurance.
In turn, Diversified sub-contracted with numerous independent trucking companies,
including R. Waltman Trucking, for the services required under the Contract.

On or about May 5, 2006, Diversified arranged for R. Waltman Trucking to
haul a shipment from the Georgia-Pacific Lovell, Wyoming facility. On that day, Richard
Waltman, an independent contractor truck driver for R. Waltman Trucking, went to the
Lovell plant to pick up a shipment. After being loaded in the plant loading area, Waltman
pulled his truck into an adjacent dirt parking lot to tarp his load. Sometime during the
tarping of his load, Waltman fell off his truck injuring himself.

Georgia-Pacific tendered Waltman's claim to Diversified for indemnification

and defense under the terms of the Contract. Diversified denied the tender. Georgia-Pacific

filed suit asking this Court to determine the rights of the parties under the contract. Georgia-
Pacific also brought claims against Wilshire Insurance for coverage under the Diversified
insurance policy. Wilshire filed a joinder in the motion to dismiss, but has not provided any

legal argument regarding the specific claims asserted against it.

UNDISPUTED FACTS

On May 5, 2006, Richard Waltman, a long haul truck driver, arrived at the
Georgia-Pacific Wallboard Plant in Lovell, Wyoming. Deposition of Richard Waltman at
67, 72. Waltman, an independent contractor, was driving truck for his son's company, R.
Waltman Trucking. See Waltman Complaint at 98, attached as Exhibit B to the Complaint.
After arriving, Waltman checked in at the front office where he picked up his picking ticket
and bill of lading. /d. at 67, 72. Waltman parked his truck in the dirt parking lot adjacent to
the loading area of the plant and checked in with the forklift operator. Jd at 68, 70.
Waltman provided the forklift operator with his picking ticket and bill of lading. /d. In the
meantime, Waltman waited for his turn to be loaded. /d. at 72-3.

When it was his turn, Waltman backed his truck into one of the three loading
bays to be loaded. /d. at 73. After his truck was loaded, Waltman pulled his truck out of the
loading area into a dirt parking lot adjacent to the loading area to tarp his truck. /d. at 77.
The dirt parking lot, also known as the "tarping area," is a vacant area with no structures.
Waltman testified that tarping is part of his job as a truck driver. Jd at 29-31. Waltman
owned the tarps, straps, and cords used in tarping his load. /d. at 32, 33, 39. In fact,
Waltman carries his own ladder with him for tarping. /d. at 48. In the words of Richard
Waltman, "[i]f there's no fall protection, then you have to use a ladder or something to
climb up on." /d. at 48. No one from Georgia-Pacific helped, supervised, assisted, or

observed Waltman tarping his load. /d. at 30-1, 128. Further, as Georgia-Pacific is not in the

business of driving trucks, no one told Waltman how to tarp his load. /d. at 128. No one at
Georgia-Pacific provided Waltman with any training or equipment. /d. at 128.

While tarping his truck, Waltman fell and seriously injured himself. See
Waltman Complaint at { 23. There were no witnesses to the incident. Sometime later that
afternoon Waltman was found in the cab of his truck with significant injuries.

ARGUMENT

A. Standard of Review

The standard of review in considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is
whether "[a]ecepting the complaint's allegations as true, standing alone, is legally sufficient
to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." pound.F.W. v. St. Stephen's Indian High
School, 264 F.3d 1297, 1303 (10th Cir. 2001). For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the
Court must accept as true the allegations contained in the Complaint, including the
allegation that "Mr. Waltman's injuries and damages were caused at least in part by his own
negligence and/or that of Defendant Diversified." Complaint at 94. Further, the Court must
accept as true Georgia-Pacific's denial of negligence. See Georgia-Pacific's Answer at J] 7,
14, attached as Exhibit C to the Complaint.

Motions to dismiss are usually confined to the pleadings. Mangels v. Pena,
789 F.2d 836 (10th Cir. 1986). But, when a party includes depositions and other materials
pertinent to resolution of the motion, the court may convert a motion to dismiss to a motion
for summary judgment. Price v. Phifpot, 420 F.3d 1158, 1167 (0th Cir. 2005). In this case,
Plaintiff has submitted deposition testimony in opposition to the motion to dismiss and will
be filing a motion for partial summary judgment. Thus, the Court should convert the motion

to dismiss to a motion for partial summary judgment. When such a conversion occurs, the
