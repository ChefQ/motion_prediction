MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF DEFENDANT, DIVERSIFIED TRANSFER AND STORAGE'S
MOTION TO DISMISS

Comes now, Defendant, Diversified Transfer and Storage, Inc. (hereinafter ""DTS"), and
respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss pursuant to F.R.C.P.
Rule 12(b)(6).

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff, Georgia-Pacific's (hereinafter "G-P'") entire claim against DTS is premised on

DTS' alleged contractual obligation to indemnify and defend G-P against the personal injury

claims of Richard Waltman and R. Waltman Trucking (Civil No. 09-cv-280D). However, the

claims in that lawsuit only allege negligence by Georgia-Pacific, whereas the contract between
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 14 _ Filed 06/16/10 Page 2 of 14

G-P and DTS specifically excludes claims arising from G-P's negligence. As DTS has no
contractual obligation to indemnify or defend G-P from claims arising from G-P's own

negligence, G-P's claim for contractual indemnification from DTS must be dismissed.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Though "all well-pleaded allegations in the ...complaint are accepted as true and viewed
in the light most favorable to the non-moving party" Stidham v. Peace Officer Standards and
Training, 265 F.3d 1144, 1149 (10" Cir. 2001) quoting Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf &
Blind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10" Cir. 1999)). ... However, [it] need not accept ... conclusory

allegations as true". Moffett v. Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., 291 F3d 1227, --- (10" Cir.

2002).

ISSUE
The only issue before the Court is whether under the contract between the parties,
Defendant, DTS is required to defend and indemnify Plaintiff, G-P for claims arising and
alleging G-P's sole negligence. The issue can be decided as a matter of law, and the Court need

not look beyond the Complaint and Exhibits to make its determination.

ARGUMENT
Though not controlling, both the trial and appellate courts of Tennessee reviewed the
exact same G-P contractual language and almost identical factual scenario in Georgia-Pacific,
LLC, et al, v. Swift Transportation Corporation, W2008-00344-COA-R3-CV (Tenn. App., 2008)

(attached), and found:
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 14 _ Filed 06/16/10 Page 3 of 14

"This appeal involves the indemnity and insurance provisions of a contract which

must be interpreted according to Georgia law. The trial court found that the

defendant had no duty to indemnify or insure the plaintiff for a claim based on

plaintiff's own negligence. We affirm."

The Tennessee courts began by examining the language of the contract, which is exactly
the same as the language in the contract at issue here. (Plaintiff's Exhibit A) \n the Tennessee
case, a Swift driver was injured while on G-P's premises, and sued for injuries proximately
caused by G-P's negligence. In the underlying Waltman case at issue here, Mr. Waltman was
injured while tarping a load on G-P's premises, and he asserts that his injuries were proximately
caused by G-P's negligence. As here, G-P brought an action against Swift based on the
indemnification provisions of the contract.

The contracts require application of Georgia law, so the Tennessee courts looked to Ryder

Integrated Logistics, Inc. v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 281 Ga. 736, 642 S.E.2d 695

 

(2007) and Service Merchandise Co. v. Hunter Fan Co., 274 Ga. App. 290, 617 S.E.2d 235
(2005). The Tennessee court noted that under Georgia law:

"Public policy is reluctant to cast the burden of negligent actions upon those who
are not at fault. Thus it is well established in Georgia that contractual indemnities
do not extend to losses caused by indemnitee's own negligence unless the contract
expressly state that the negligence of the indemnitee is covered. The words of the
contract will be scruntized closely to discover whether such an intent is actually
revealed in them and every presumption is against such intention. In the absence
of explicit language to the contrary, courts will not interpret an indemnity
agreement as a promise by the indemnitor to save the indemnitee harmless on
account of the latter's own negligence. Georgia courts never imply an agreement
to indemnify another for one's own negligence in the absence of express
language."

Ryder 737-38, 642 S.E.2d at 697 (citing Allstate Ins. Co. v. City of Atlanta, 202 Ga. App. 692,
693, 415 S.E.2d 308 (1992)).

But as the Tennessee courts found, citing the G-P contractual language which is identical

to the case at bar:
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 14 _ Filed 06/16/10 Page 4 of 14

"The parties' indemnity agreement did not expressly state that it covered the
negligence of the indemnitee, G-P, as required under Georgia law. The to the
contrary, the contract expressly stated that the hold harmless and indemnification
provisions "shall not apply to the extent that the action giving rise to the
claims was caused by any act or omission of G-P". (Emphasis added)

As shown by the Talbot Certificate of Insurance (Plaintiff's Exhibit D), DTS fulfilled its
contractual requirements by directing Talbot to add G-P as an additional insured on DTS'
Commercial General Liability policy. Talbot issued the Certificate showing G-P as an additional
insured. Whether Talbot actually added G-P to the policy is not known by DTS. However,
whether G-P is an "additional insured" or not is irrelevant to its claims for indemnification, as
there was no contractual obligation to insure G-P for its own negligence. The Tennessee courts
also addressed G-P's claims under the contractual insurance requirements, as here, and stated:

We also conclude that the insurance provision does not require
Swift Transportation to indemnify G-P for the negligence claim.
As in Service Merchandise, the contract did not require Swift
Transportation to insure against G-P's own negligence, and the
requirement that Swift Transportation name G-P as an additional
insured did not create an independent basis that would require
indemnification for G-P's own negligence. /d. At 297 617 S.E.2d
at 241. Swift Transportation agreed to obtain a commercial
general liability policy "covering the risks incident to this
Agreement." However Swift Transportation had assumed all risks
occurring in the performance of the Agreement except for the risk
of death or injury "when caused by the negligence of G-P, its
agents and employees." (Emphasis in original)

 

 

"In sum, although an additional insured can be covered for its own
negligence, we find nothing in this contract to require such
coverage. The parties' contract set forth various risks assumed by
Swift Transportation and obligated Swift Transportation to obtain
an insurance policy to cover risks incident to the agreement. There
is nothing in the contract to indicate an agreement that Swift
Transportation would obtain insurance against G-P's own
negligence."
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 14 Filed 06/16/10 Page 5 of 14

Plaintiff asserts that DTS breached the contract by failing to have all carriers name G-P as
an additional insured on their CGL policies. However, that allegation is contradicted by the
contract itself, which does not require additional insured status on carrier's CGL, but only on
auto liability insurance policies. (Plaintiff's Exhibit A, Appendix A). The Court is entitled to
ignore all of Plaintiff's conclusory allegations that "such policies would have provided insurance
coverage for Plaintiff for the Waltman claims.", as again, there was no contractual requirement

for DTS or the underlying carriers to insure G-P against its own negligence.

CONCLUSION
The underlying Waltman case is exclusively premised on allegations of G-P's negligence.
However, as in the Swift case, DTS was not contractually required to indemnify G-P for claims
arising from G-P's own negligence, nor was DTS required to insure G-P against its own
negligence, nor was DTS required to have underlying carrier's insure G-P for its own
negligence. Therefore, Plaintiff's complaint against Defendant should be dismissed.

I. Facts & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Swift Transportation Corporation ("Swift Transportation") entered into a series of contracts
with Georgia-Pacific Corporation ("G-P"), whereby Swift Transportation would provide vehicles
and drivers for the transportation of G-P's property. The contract provided that it was to be
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia. The contract contained the following
relevant provisions':

7. CARRIER [Swift Transportation] agrees to assume all risks growing out of or
occurring in the performance of this Agreement by CARRIER, its agents or
employees for:

(a) any and all injury or damage arising out of performance of this
Agreement to (1) the property and premises of G-P, (2) the property and
premises of any other person, and (3) any property or equipment used or to
be used or incorporated in the performance of this Agreement.

(b) any death or injury to any person or persons, whether or not employed
by the CARRIER, however caused, occurring during the performance of this
Agreement or upon the premises where this Agreement is being performed,
except when caused by the negligence of G-P, its agents and employees.

(c) CARRIER further covenants and agrees, and it hereby binds itself, at
its own sole cost and expense, to defend, save harmless and indemnify G-P
from and against any and all manner of suits, claims, judgments, demands,
costs, attorneys' fees, charges, debts, dues, liabilities, and payments of money
of any sort or nature whatsoever on account of injury to or the death of
persons or loss of or damage to property in any manner whatsoever, arising
out of or predicated upon the operation of trucks of or by CARRIER, its
agents or employees, or the conduct of the business of CARRIER, or the
transportation and handling of goods by CARRIER, its agents or employees
whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, provided that this hold
harmless and indemnity shall not apply to the extent that the action giving
rise to the claim was caused by any act or omission of G-P.

8. CARRIER agrees to obtain insurance covering the risks incident to this
Agreement, including Worker's Compensation and all other types of insurance as are
currently required by 49 CFR Part 387 or such future state, local or federal
regulations as may be implemented from time to time. CARRIER shall obtain such
insurance and any additional insurance specified in Appendix A in the amounts

 

Both parties stated at oral argument that paragraph 7(c) should have been listed as a separate paragraph rather
than a subsection.

-2-
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 14 Filed 06/16/10 Page 9 of 14

specified in Appendix A. All insurance policies are to be written by reliable, solvent,
and reputable insurance companies.

Appendix A to the contract provided:
CARRIER agrees to obtain and maintain at its own cost, during the term of this
Agreement, insurance covering the risks incident to this Agreement with the
following minimum limits:

i. Workers' Compensation with statutory limits;
il. Employer's Liability with $100,000 per occurrence;
lil. Commercial General Liability insurance, covering bodily injuries and death

and property damage, Independent Contractors, Personal Injury, Contractual
with limits of $500,000 per occurrence and $1,000,000 in the General
Aggregate;

iv. Automobile Liability, covering owned, non-owned, hired, and other vehicles,
with a combined single limit of $750,000 per occurrence. For a motor carrier
involved in the transportation of material which the DOT identifies as
hazardous, the requirement is $5,000,000.

v. Cargo Liability covering damage to or loss of cargo or freight transported on
behalf of G-P with limits of $50,000 per occurrence.

In the event that federal or state law or regulation requires more extensive liability
coverage than the limits listed above, CARRIER shall procure and maintain such
additional coverage at its expense.

CARRIER shall be responsible for payment of any and all deductibles from insured
claims under its policies. Carrier shall cause G-P to be named as an additional
insured on its Commercial General Liability and Automobile Liability policies. The
coverage afforded under any insurance policy obtained by CARRIER pursuant to this
Appendix shall be primary coverage regardless of whether or not G-P has similar
coverage. Evidence of insurance, including where applicable the fact that G-P has
been named as an additional insured, shall be filed with G-P before CARRIER
transports any freight for G-P, including renewals thereof. Policies shall neither be
canceled nor changed without at least ten (10) days prior written notice to G-P.
Swift Transportation initially maintained a commercial general liability insurance policy, but it later
elected to become self-insured, and it notified G-P of its decision without objection.

On or about November 22, 2004, a Swift Transportation driver, David Sprouse, made a
delivery at one of G-P's truck terminals in Louisiana and was allegedly injured when he fell down
a stairway. Mr. Sprouse and his wife subsequently filed a lawsuit in a federal district court against
G-P, alleging that Mr. Sprouse's injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of G-P.
Specifically, their complaint alleged that G-P was negligent in failing to warn Mr. Sprouse that its
concrete stairs and landing were cracked and broken, and failing to provide adequate lighting and
handrails on the stairway.
Case 2:10-cv-00083-NDF Document 14 _ Filed 06/16/10 Page 10 of 14

G-P tendered the defense to Swift Transportation, claiming that it was entitled to a defense
and indemnification under the indemnity and insurance provisions in the contract. Swift
Transportation declined to defend or indemnify G-P because the claim was based on the negligence
of G-P. G-P' then filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and specific performance in chancery
court, seeking an order that would require Swift Transportation to defend, hold harmless, and
indemnify G-P for losses arising from the Sprouse litigation. At some point after the complaint was
filed, G-P settled the Sprouse litigation out of court. G-P continued to assert that it was entitled to
indemnification from Swift Transportation because it settled the Sprouse claim for an amount less
than the $500,000 limit of the contractually required commercial general liability insurance policy.
Of course, no such policy existed because Swift Transportation elected to become self-insured.
According to G-P, however, the contract's insurance provision obligated Swift Transportation to
provide coverage to G-P for any liability up to $500,000.

Swift Transportation filed a motion to dismiss G-P's complaint for failure to state a claim,
asserting that, pursuant to the contract, it had no duty to indemnify G-P because the action giving
rise to the claim was caused by an act or omission of G-P. Swift Transportation claimed that the
insurance provision only protected G-P in the event that G-P was sued for injury or death on account
of Swift Transportation's negligence. G-P then filed a motion for summary judgment. Following
a hearing on both motions, the trial court ruled that Swift Transportation had no duty to defend,
indemnify, or insure G-P for claims arising out of G-P's own negligence.' Accordingly, the court
entered an order denying G-P's motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in
favor of Swift Transportation.'

II. ISSUES PRESENTED
G-P has timely filed its notice of appeal and presents the following issue for review: whether
the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Swift Transportation and denying G-
P's motion forsummary judgment. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the chancery
court.

Ul. STANDARD OF REVIEW

The interpretation of a contract is a matter of law. Guiliano v. Cleo, Inc., 995 S.W.2d 88,
95 (Tenn. 1999). We review a trial court's conclusions of law de novo with no presumption of

 

The complaint was filed by Georgia-Pacific, LLC, f/k/a Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and by Georgia-Pacific
Corrugated, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific, LLC, which now owns the facility where
Mr. Sprouse was injured. For ease of reference, we will refer to the plaintiffs collectively as G-P.

The final order states, "Both sides agree that GP and Swift operated as if Swift continued to carry commercial
general liability insurance and that its self insurance status is of no consequence to the issues before the court."

The final order also states that Swift Transportation's motion to dismiss was treated as one for summary
judgment because the court considered matters outside of the pleadings.
