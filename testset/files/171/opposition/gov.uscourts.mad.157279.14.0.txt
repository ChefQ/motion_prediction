SANFORD MEEKINS

Government's Response to Motion to Continue Final Revocation Hearing

Sanford Meekins has been convicted of fraud twice and the Petition for Revocation is
based, in part, on his involvement in a purported business with another felon, also previously
convicted of fraud. According to the presentence report, Meekins similarly sought emergency
treatment in November, 2008, prior to pleading guilty in January, 2009, to the wire fraud for
which he is presently on supervised release.

The government has requested that defense counsel provide a doctor's letter establishing
Meekins's diagnosis, describing his prognosis, and confirming Meekins's likely course of
treatment. The doctor's letter both will enable the government to respond appropriately to the
request for a postponement, and create a more reliable and complete factual record on which the
Court can evaluate the request.

Respectfully submitted,

Date: July 29, 2015 Carmen M. Ortiz
