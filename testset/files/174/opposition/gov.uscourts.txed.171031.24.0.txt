INTRODUCTION
Defendant Ruiz Food Products, Inc. (“Ruiz Foods”) seeks to transfer the case from this

Court, which undeniably can exercise personal jurisdiction over it and in which venue is proper,
to a location in which Ruiz Foods does not even have a physical presence and is not registered to
do business.

Ruiz Foods then incongruously proceeds to accuse MacroPoint of “forum

shopping.” What Ruiz Foods mischaracterizes as forum shopping is expressly permitted under
the law, namely, the right of a party to choose a venue that is statutorily authorized and
consistent with the Civil Rules. What is not permitted, however, is “judge shopping,” which is
exactly what Ruiz Foods seeks to accomplish through its Motion to Transfer or, in the
Alternative, Stay Pending Related Litigation (“Motion to Transfer”).
Ruiz Foods cannot dispute that it is subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas, or that
MacroPoint, LLC’s (“MacroPoint”) action could have been brought in this Court. Rather, Ruiz
Foods wants to overrule MacroPoint’s choice of forum under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), on the
purported grounds that (1) previously there was an action in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Ohio (now on appeal) between MacroPoint and a defendant not a party
to this case and involving different patents; albeit on the same type of technology, and (2) that
same third party, more than two months after MacroPoint filed this case, filed a declaratory
judgment action for patent invalidity and non-infringement against MacroPoint on the same
patents that are at issue in this case. The fact remains, however, that MacroPoint was undeniably
the first to file, and under well-settled Fifth Circuit caselaw, its choice of forum should not be
disturbed.
Ruiz Foods has failed to meet its substantial burden to prove that the private and public
interest factors weigh in favor of a convenience transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 1404(a). Ruiz

1

Foods also has failed to show that the proceedings should be stayed as an exception to the firstto-file rule. Accordingly, Ruiz Foods’ Motion to Transfer should be denied.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
MacroPoint filed this action for infringement of United States Patent No. 9,429, 659 (the

“‘659 Patent”) and United States Patent No. 8,275,358 (the “‘358 Patent”) (collectively, the
“Patents”) on August 30, 2016. [ECF No. 1]. While Ruiz Foods is headquartered in California,
it also has a manufacturing facility in Denison, Texas, which is located in the Eastern District of
Texas. [ECF No. 13 at 3]. Ruiz Foods ships food products from this facility throughout the
United States. [Id.]. The company also monitors the locations of vehicles and food products
shipped from its Denison, Texas facility through freight monitoring software it acquired. [Id. at
3 – 4]. Ruiz Foods, however, has no offices in Ohio. [See ECF No. 13 at 3]. It is not even
registered to do business in the state. [See Exhibit A - Declaration of James Fisher at ¶ 2].
On November 4, 2016, more than two (2) months after MacroPoint filed the present
action, a company by the name FourKites, Inc. (“FourKites”), which competes with MacroPoint
in providing freight monitoring software to customers throughout the United States, filed an
action against MacroPoint in the Northern District of Ohio, Case No. 1:16-cv-02703-CAB,
seeking a declaratory judgment that the Patents are invalid and not infringed, and also asserting
claims for false advertising; false affiliation, connection or association under the Lanham Act;
tortious interference; and deceptive trade practices under Ohio law. In addition, MacroPoint and
FourKites are involved in an appeal at the Federal Circuit, Case No. 16-1286, in which
MacroPoint appealed the dismissal by a different judge in the Northern District of Ohio of a
previous patent infringement action that it brought against FourKites – Case No. 15-cv-1002.
The patents at issue in the prior Ohio case and on appeal are not the same patents that
MacroPoint is asserting against Ruiz Foods in this infringement action.
2

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 7 of 18 PageID #: 296

On November 21, 2016, this Court entered a Scheduling Order, setting dates for the
scheduling conference, the Markman hearing, and the trial. [ECF No. 17]. The current case in
Ohio, however, has not proceeded at all since FourKites filed its claims for declaratory
judgment. MacroPoint’s response to the complaint is not due until January 4, 2017. [See Exhibit
B]. No other dates have been set in that case. By that time, MacroPoint already will have served
its infringement contentions in this case pursuant to the Court’s recent order. [See id.].
III.

LAW AND ARGUMENT
A.

The First-to-File Rule Compels Maintenance of the Action in Texas.

There is no dispute that this patent infringement action against Ruiz Foods was filed
about two months before a declaratory judgment action involving the Patents was filed against
MacroPoint by a different party in Ohio. The first-to-file rule is a well-established doctrine of
comity among federal courts. Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Micron Semiconductor, Inc., 815 F.
Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993). It provides that when actions involving similar parties and
issues are filed in two different courts, the court in which the first suit was filed should proceed
to judgment. Id. When two actions that sufficiently overlap are filed in different federal district
courts, one for infringement and the other for declaratory relief, the declaratory judgment action,
if filed later, generally is to be stayed, dismissed, or transferred to the forum of the infringement
action. Merial Ltd. v. Cipla Ltd., 681 F.3d 1283, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
In determining whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the court must consider two factors:
1) whether the actions involve substantially similar issues; and 2) which of the two courts should
hear the case. Texas Instruments, Inc., 815 F. Supp. at 997. “As to the first inquiry, all that need
be present is that the two actions involve closely related questions or common subject matter, or
that the core issues substantially overlap. The cases need not be identical to be duplicative.” Id.
Moreover, complete identity of the parties is not necessary. Innovative Automation, LLC v.
3

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 8 of 18 PageID #: 297

Audio Video & Video Labs, Inc., No. 6:11-CV-234 LED-JDL, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114503, at
*30 (E.D. Tex. May 30, 2012) (citing Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603
(5th Cir. 1999)). As to the second factor, “[t]he Fifth Circuit adheres to the general rule that the
court in which an action is first filed is the appropriate court to determine whether subsequently
filed cases involving substantially similar issues should proceed.” and “whether the second suit
filed must be dismissed, stayed or transferred and consolidated.” Sutter Corp. v. P& P Indus.,
Inc., 125 F.3d 914, 920 (5th Cir. 1997) (internal quotations omitted).
Ruiz Foods completely fails to recognize, or even mention, the first-to-file rule, but it
compels maintenance of this action in Texas.

MacroPoint filed the present action for

infringement of the Patents more than two months before FourKites filed its action against
MacroPoint in Ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that the Patents are not infringed by Four
Kites, are invalid and are unenforceable. Even though Ruiz Foods is not a party to the Ohio
action and was not referred to in the action, both cases involve the common subject matter of the
‘659 Patent and the ‘358 Patent. As this action was filed first, and the two cases involve the
same Patents, the first-to-file rule requires that this Court maintain the action and deny the
Motion to Transfer.
B.

Considerations of Section 1404 Favor Maintenance of the Action in Texas.

In patent cases, the courts apply “the general rule favoring the forum of the first-filed
case, ‘unless considerations of judicial and litigant economy, and the just and effective
disposition of disputes, requires otherwise.’” Electronics for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle, 394 F.3d
1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Here, the consideration of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) counsels that this
action should be maintained in Texas. For a transfer to be proper, the moving party must show
“good cause” to transfer, and this “significant burden” is met when the moving party shows that
“the transferee venue is clearly more convenient” than the chosen forum. Texas Data Co.,
4

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 9 of 18 PageID #: 298

L.L.C. v. Target Brands, Inc., 771 F. Supp. 2d 630, 639 (E.D. Tex. 2011) (quoting In re
Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 314 (5th Cir. 2008) (emphasis supplied)).
When determining if transfer is appropriate under Section 1404(a), courts in this district
“consider[] several private and public interest factors, none of which are given dispositive
weight.” Texas Data, 771 F. Supp. 2d at 639. Private interests are “(1) the relative ease of access
to sources of proof; (2) the availability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of
witnesses; (3) the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical problems
that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.” Id. (citing Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at
315). The public interests are: “(1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion;
(2) the local interest in having localized interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the
forum with the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems of
conflict of laws [in] the application of foreign law.” Id. It is not enough to justify transferring
this case from a plaintiff’s chosen forum if even a factor or two weigh in favor of transfer. See
Texas Data, 771 F. Supp. 2d at 639 (“The court’s analysis in Volkswagen II reflected the
importance of the plaintiff’s choice of venue, as the court issued a writ of mandamus to transfer
venue in that case only after it found that four of the eight Gilbert factors weighed in favor of
transfer and no factors weighed against transfer.”).
Here, the private and public interests support maintaining the action here in the Eastern
District of Texas. Ruiz Foods has not met its significant burden of proving that the balance of
factors weighs strongly in favor of transfer and that the transferee district is clearly more
convenient.
1.

No Legitimate Judicial Economy Factor Exists.

The law requires that motions to transfer “be decided based on the situation which existed
when suit was instituted,” not the situation as the time when the court rules. In re EMC Corp.,
5

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 10 of 18 PageID #: 299

501 F. App’x 973, 976 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (internal citations omitted). As such, considerations of
judicial economy arising after the filing of a suit are not weighed a part of the transfer analysis.
Id. Here, because the FourKites action against MacroPoint was not pending at the time that the
present case was filed, it cannot be considered as part of the judicial economy analysis. Without
the current Ohio case as part of the analysis, Ruiz Foods has no support for its argument that
judicial economy weighs in favor of transfer.1
While a court may transfer an action under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), “[f]or the convenience
of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice . . . to any other district or division where [the
action] might have been brought,” as the Supreme Court has noted, the transferee district must
have been able to assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant independent of the defendant’s
consent. See Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U.S. 335, 343-44 (1960); Affymetrix, Inc. v. Synteni, Inc.,
128 F. Supp. 2d 192, 194 n.1 (D. Del. 1998). The moving party bears the burden of proving that
the action “properly could have been brought in the first instance in the transferee district.” 17
James Wm. Moore, et al. Moore’s Federal Practice § 111.12[3] (3d ed. 2016) (citing Waste
Distillation Tech. v. Pan Am. Res., 775 F. Supp. 759, 762 (D. Del. 1991)). Ruiz Foods has not
met this burden. The assertions of patent infringement in this case are not based on Ruiz Foods’
engagement of or relationship with distributors in Ohio. [See ECF No. 1 at 6-9; 11-14]. Ruiz
Foods has neither a physical presence in Ohio nor a registration to do business in Ohio. [ECF

1

Even if the current Ohio case is considered as part of the judicial economy analysis, it does not
weigh in favor of transfer. The current Ohio case involves different patents (and hence different
patent claims) than the prior Ohio case that is now on appeal. In fact, the ‘358 Patent has no
familial relationship whatsoever to any of the prior patents at issue. [See ECF No. 1 at Exhibit
B]. And, while the ‘659 Patent is related to prior patents, the claims of the ‘659 Patent are
distinct and independent of the other patent claims. [See ECF No. 1 at Exhibit A]. Moreover,
the current Ohio case, is presently pending before a different judge than the prior case between
MacroPoint and Four Kites, or even the first case that MacroPoint had brought for infringement
of any of its patents. See fn. 2.

6

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 11 of 18 PageID #: 300

No. 13 at 3; Exhibit A at ¶ 3]. Further, it does not appear that Ruiz Foods has ever been sued in
the state or federal court in Ohio or has ever brought suit against another party in any courts in
Ohio. [Exhibit A at ¶4]. In fact, even though it could have been, Ruiz Foods is not a party to the
declaratory judgment action in Ohio. [ECF No. 13 at Exhibit G].
Moreover, Ruiz Foods’ argument that judicial economy is a reason to transfer this action
to Ohio is nothing more than an attempt at judge shopping to move this litigation into a specific
court to try to take advantage of the rulings by a specific judge in one of the prior cases filed in
Ohio. Judge shopping, however, is not permitted in this Circuit. In a prior case arising out of the
Tyler Division of the Eastern District of Texas, the Fifth Circuit held in no uncertain terms that
while forum shopping is permissible, judge shopping is not, holding that “parties clearly have no
right to a judge of their choice.” McCuin v. Tex. Power & Light Co., 714 F.2d 1255, 1261-62
(5th Cir. 1983). Ruiz Foods cannot simply disguise its attempt at judge shopping under the claim
that judicial economy favors transfer.2
2.

Ease of Access to Sources of Proof.

In determining access to sources of proof, the Federal Circuit has opined that courts must
assume that the majority of relevant evidence will come from the accused infringer. In re
Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009). As a result, the location where the
defendant’s documents are kept is taken into account when determining a motion to transfer.
2

In the current Ohio case, FourKites has moved to transfer the Ohio case to the same judge who
provided FourKites with a favorable decision on the other MacroPoint patents in Case No. 1:15cv-1002. However, what Ruiz Foods failed to tell this Court is that the prior case between
MacroPoint and FourKites was not the only case that was previously filed asserting infringement
of MacroPoint patents in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Prior to the
FourKites case that is currently on appeal, MacroPoint sued Salebug.com, LLC and Pegasus
TransTech Corporation in the same Ohio court (Case No. 1:14-cv-00312). That case was
assigned to yet a different third judge in the Northern District of Ohio. FourKites, however, did
not seek to transfer its case to that other judge. Hence, Ruiz Food’s argument for judicial
economy is either a misleading and thinly veiled judge shopping attempt or pure speculation.

7

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 12 of 18 PageID #: 301

Innovative Automation, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114503, at *23. Here, Ruiz Foods indicates that
its principal place of business is in Dinuba, California. [ECF No. 13 at 3]. Ruiz Foods also has a
manufacturing facility from which it ships food products in Denison, Texas, which is located in
this judicial district. [Id.]. And because the Patents are directed to monitoring the locations of a
vehicle or freight carried by a vehicle, and providing consent to obtain location information for
such vehicles or freight, it is plain that shipments that are made from Ruiz Foods’ facility in
Denison, Texas would be relevant to, and that information concerning those shipments could
demonstrate infringement of, the Patents. Thus, it would be fair to assume that responsive
information from Ruiz would come from both California and Texas. There is at least some
evidence relative to Ruiz Foods’ infringement of the Patents located in this judicial district.
Thus, this factor does not favor transfer.
Furthermore, Ruiz Foods’ argument that the bulk of the evidence will come from
FourKites is inapposite. FourKites, which is located in Chicago, Illinois, is not a party to this
case. Its location is not relevant to the venue analysis. Even taking into account FourKites’
location, access to FourKites’ evidence does not favor transfer since it is located outside of both
the Eastern District of Texas and the Northern District of Ohio.
3.

Availability of Compulsory Process.

This factor will weigh in favor of transfer if the majority of non-party witnesses are
located in the venue to which the defendant has moved to transfer. Innovative Automation, 2012
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114503, at *26. Ruiz Foods insists that the majority of non-party witnesses
who will testify will be FourKites witnesses. [ECF No. 13 at 10]. As noted above, Four Kites is
located in Chicago, Illinois – not in the venue to which Defendant has requested transfer. If Ruiz
Foods’ contention is true, then the Northern District of Ohio does not have absolute subpoena
power over the majority of the non-party witnesses. In fact, the only third-party witness over
8

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 13 of 18 PageID #: 302

which the Northern District of Ohio would have such power is the prosecuting attorney of the
Patents. On the other hand, any shippers that pick up freight from Ruiz Foods’ Denison, Texas
facility and would have information concerning Ruiz Foods’ monitoring of vehicle or freight
locations, or about providing consent to obtain location information likely would be within the
subpoena power of this Court for purposes of trial. Thus, this factor also does not weigh in favor
of transfer.
4.

The Cost of Attendance for Witnesses.

The cost of attendance for witnesses likewise does not weigh in favor of transfer. Just as
Ruiz Foods’ evidence is in Texas, or closer to Texas than Ohio, so are its witnesses. This forum
is absolutely more convenient for any employees of the Ruiz Foods facility in Denison, Texas
that may testify at trial. Any difference in convenience regarding travel between California and
Tyler, Texas or Cleveland, Ohio that Ruiz Foods claims for its employees in California is in
practice minimal at best. Witnesses readily could fly to both locations and in both cases would
likely not be able to avoid overnight stays. Furthermore, any claim that MacroPoint witnesses
will be inconvenienced in Texas is mooted by the fact that MacroPoint selected this forum.
The idea that the FourKites witnesses, whom Ruiz Foods claims will be the majority of
its witnesses, would be able to fly in and out of the trial location in one day is simply unrealistic.
In reality, it is far more likely that interested witnesses would arrive at the location of the trial at
least the day before their testimony so that they can prepare with counsel. Whether the trial is in
Cleveland, Ohio or Tyler, Texas, any FourKites witness would likely not be able to avoid
overnight stays. Thus, the convenience of attendance for potential FourKites witnesses is not
distinct enough to weigh in favor of transfer.
At best, this factor is neutral in the transfer analysis.

9

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 14 of 18 PageID #: 303

5.

The Public Interest Factors.

The public interest factors also are neutral at best. Both this Court and the Northern
District of Ohio have the same type of interest in protecting patent rights in the United States.
While the Northern District of Ohio may have some interest in resolution of this case, the people
of East Texas also would have a vested interest in the outcome of this case. Ruiz Foods has a
manufacturing facility in this district from which it ships products that are monitored in a manner
that violates the Patents. As Ruiz Foods’ points out, “the local interest factor is strong when ‘the
cause of action calls into question the work and reputation of several individuals residing in or
near that district and who presumably conduct business in that community.’” [ECF No. 13 at 13,
citing In re Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2009)]. Here, the shipping
activities of Ruiz Foods in Denison, Texas are at least called into question by this patent
infringement lawsuit. Thus, the local interest in the Eastern District of Texas is at least as strong
as the local interest in the Northern District of Ohio. As Ruiz Foods point out, the remaining
public interest factors are neutral and have no weight in the transfer analysis.
Ruiz Foods has not met its significant burden of proving that the balance of private and
public interest factors weighs strongly in favor of transfer and that the transferee district is
clearly more convenient.

Ruiz Foods thus cannot override MacroPoint’s choice of forum.

MacroPoint’s choice of forum should remain undisturbed and the Motion to Transfer must be
denied.
C.

The Motion to Stay, in the Alternative, Should be Denied.

While it is true that a district court has the inherent authority to stay proceedings as part
of its power to control the disposition of causes on its docket, a stay is not appropriate in this
case. See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). Moreover, while the court in
Soverain Software LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 356 F. Supp. 2d 660 (E.D. Tex. 2005) did set forth
10

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 24 Filed 12/12/16 Page 15 of 18 PageID #: 304

factors that a court should consider in determining whether to impose a stay in the context of a
stay pending proceeding before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, even those factors favor
proceeding with this matter, not staying it. If this case is stayed, MacroPoint would be prevented
from protecting itself against a direct infringement of the Patents by a direct infringer – Ruiz
Foods – which it is entitled to do under 35 U.S.C. § 271(a). Soverain certainly does not stand for
the proposition that the “first to file rule” should be ignored and a case stayed under the
circumstances of this case. As previously discussed, see supra Section III.A., the first-to-file
rule requires this action to remain in this Court, and such a finding is not affected by the
customer-suit exception.
1.

The Customer-Suit Exception Does Not Apply.

Ruiz Foods asserts that the so-called “customer-suit exception” to the first-to-file rule
applies and justifies overriding MacroPoint’s choice of forum. Ruiz Foods is wrong. The
customer-suit exception is a very narrow exception to the first-to-file rule in patent cases. In
determining whether to apply the customer-suit exception, a court must apply the principles of
efficiency and judicial economy and consider three relevant factors: (1) whether the customer in
the earlier filed suit is merely a reseller; (2) whether the customer agrees to be bound by any
decision in favor of the patent owner; and (3) whether the manufacturer is the only source of the
infringing product. Tegic Commc’n Corp. v. Board of Regents of Tex. Univ. of Tex. Sys., 458
F.3d 1335, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2006).
When the relevant factors are considered in the present case, it is clear that the customersuit exception does not apply. Critically, Ruiz Foods is not a mere reseller of an infringing
product.3 Ruiz Foods is a direct infringer of the Patents. A customer, like Ruiz, who utilizes a

In fact, MacroPoint had no need to even mention FourKites in the Complaint because Ruiz
Foods is accused of directly infringing MacroPoint’s Patents. [See ECF No. 1 at pp. 6-9; 11-14].

product as part of its own services, rather than simply reselling the product, directly infringes the
patent. See Innovative Automation, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114503 at *42-43. In this
case, Ruiz Foods is directly infringing the Patents in violation of 35 U.S.C. § 271 by monitoring
the locations of a vehicle or freight carried by a vehicle, and providing notice and receiving
consent to obtain location information for shipments that are made at least from Ruiz Foods’
facility in Denison, Texas. As Ruiz Foods is not a party to the Ohio declaratory judgment action,
the disposition of the case in Ohio would not resolve questions of direct infringement by Ruiz
Foods in the Texas case. Thus, it is plain that the customer-suit exception does not apply.

A Discretionary Stay Should be Denied.

A discretionary stay also is not appropriate. The patents at issue in MacroPoint’s appeal
of the prior Ohio case in the Federal Circuit are not the same patents at issue in the present case.
In fact, the ‘358 Patent has no familial relationship whatsoever to any of the prior patents at
issue. And, while the ‘659 Patent is related to those patents, the claims of the ‘659 Patent are
distinct and independent of the other patent claims. The ‘659 Patent is still considered valid even
if patents related to it are not. See, 35 U.S.C. § 282 (“A patent shall be presumed valid. Each
claim of a patent (whether in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be
presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims . . . ”).
Moreover, this Court has already issued a Scheduling Order setting the dates for the
Markman hearing and the trial. This case is proceeding and there is no just reason to delay it
pending resolution of MacroPoint’s appeal in the prior Ohio case, especially because any
decision from the appeal will not be determinative of the validity or infringement of the Patents
in this case. Accordingly, there is no reason to stay the proceedings pending the decision in the
Federal Circuit, and this Court should deny Ruiz Foods’ motion to stay this action.
