INTRODUCTION
This is a case of forum shopping and gamesmanship. MacroPoint is an Ohio company.

Last year, it sued non-party FourKites in the Northern District of Ohio for infringement of five
related patents.2 MacroPoint lost. The Ohio Court found MacroPoint’s patents invalid under 35
U.S.C. § 101 and dismissed its complaint against FourKites.3
Now, MacroPoint has sued Ruiz Foods—a customer of FourKites—for infringement of
two substantially related patents. The first, the ’659 patent, belongs to the same patent family and
is substantively the same as the patents already invalidated by the Ohio Court. The second, the
’358 patent, belongs to a different patent family, but nevertheless relates to the same subject
matter and technology as the patents that the Ohio Court already addressed and invalidated. Both
of these patents are also at issue in the Ohio Court in a case FourKites recently filed.
This case belongs in the Northern District of Ohio. Ohio is MacroPoint’s home—and it
first chose that home court to sue FourKites for alleged infringement of patents that were, to its
undoubted disappointment, invalidated there. While understandable that it may want to try a new
jurisdiction to address its patents a second time, the fact remains that Ohio is the location of all
the evidence related to the conception and reduction to practice of the alleged invention of the
patents-in-suit. In addition to MacroPoint itself, its primary legal counsel, the inventor of these
patents, and the prosecuting attorneys all reside in Ohio. Most importantly, the Ohio Court is
already intimately familiar with MacroPoint and the subject matter of the patents-in-suit, and the
Ohio Court will be adjudicating the issues of validity and infringement in the suit between
FourKites and MacroPoint related to the FourKites technology at issue. Ruiz Foods is

United States Patent Nos. 8,604,943; 9,070,295; 9,082,097; 9,082,098; and 9,087,313.

MacroPoint’s appeal of that decision is currently pending, with oral argument scheduled for December 6, 2016.
See Case No. 16-1286 (Fed. Cir.).

headquartered in California; indeed, the only connection to this district is one Ruiz Foods
processing facility in Denison. The gravity of this case, however, is squarely in Ohio.
Alternatively, the Court should stay this case pending resolution of the underlying
FourKites-MacroPoint litigation. FourKites supplies the technology that MacroPoint alleges
infringes the ’659 patent and ’358 patent. FourKites, not Ruiz Foods, has a paramount interest in
adjudicating whether the claims of the ’659 patent and ’358 patent are valid and infringed by its
technology. Under the customer-suit exception, this case—brought against one of FourKites’
customers, which has a far lesser interest in the ultimate adjudication of the FourKitesMacroPoint dispute—should wait to proceed while the supplier-suit, which will likely be
dispositive of any claims or defenses in this case, moves forward. This case also should wait for
resolution of MacroPoint’s appeal of the Ohio Court’s prior decision because the Federal
Circuit’s resolution of that appeal will inevitably inform the Court and the parties’ positions in
this litigation.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

This Case Is In Its Infancy.

This case is in its early stages. MacroPoint filed its complaint on August 30, 2016. Dkt.
#1. Ruiz has not answered, having instead filed a motion to dismiss on November 7, 2016, for
insufficient service of process. Dkt. # 10. No scheduling conference has been set, no docket
control order has been entered, and no Markman or trial dates have been assigned.
B.

The Parties Have Negligible Connections to Texas.
1.

MacroPoint is an Ohio company.

MacroPoint is a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the
State of Ohio, with a principal place of business at 6050 Oak Tree Boulevard, Suite 150,
Cleveland, Ohio. Dkt. # 1 at ¶ 4. MacroPoint’s CEO, Bennett H. Adelson, resides in Highland

2

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 9 of 22 PageID #: 97

Heights, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland. Ex. A.
Mr. Adelson is the sole named inventor of the patents-in-suit. Exs. A, B. The ’358 patent,
entitled “Providing notice and receiving consent to obtain location information of a mobile
device,” and the ’659 patent, entitled “Machine or group of machines for monitoring location of
a vehicle or freight carried by a vehicle,” are both generally directed to tracking freight. Id. The
prosecuting attorney, Luis Carrion, works out of the Cleveland, Ohio office of Renner, Otto,
Boisselle & Sklar, LLP. Ex. C.
2.

Ruiz Foods is a California company.

Ruiz Foods is a California corporation with a place of business in Dinuba, California. Ex.
D at ¶ 3. Dinuba is home to Ruiz Foods’ headquarters and its 300,000 sq. ft. main manufacturing
facility. Id. All of Ruiz Foods’ executives responsible for handling of transportation and logistics
functions work out of the Dinuba, California office. Id. at ¶ 4. Ruiz Foods’ primary decisionmaking, such as whether to partner with a particular technology vendor, is conducted at its
headquarters in California. Id. All of the documents relevant to such decision making with
respect to the handling of transportation and logistics functions resides in California. Id.
In addition to its main manufacturing facility in Dinuba, California, Ruiz Foods has
additional manufacturing facilities in Tulare, California, Denison, Texas, and Florence, South
Carolina. Id. at ¶ 3. Ruiz Foods’ Denison facility is solely a food product manufacturing facility.
Id. at ¶ 5. Ruiz Foods does not conduct executive-level decision-making relating to
transportation and logistics in Denison. Id. No employees or documents relevant to such decision
making work at the Denison facility. Id.
Ruiz Foods does not make freight tracking technology. Id. at ¶ 6. In fact, until Ruiz
Foods began using FourKites for freight tracking services, Ruiz Foods did not use freight
tracking technology. Id. FourKites’ freight tracking services are not located on any particular
3

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 10 of 22 PageID #: 98

computer in Ruiz’s possession; rather, Ruiz Foods uses the FourKites freight tracking services
from its headquarters in California by way of a cloud-based platform to track freight throughout
the United States. Id.
3.

FourKites is an Illinois Company.

FourKites is a Delaware corporation with a place of business in Chicago, Illinois. Ex. E.
FourKites is an innovative provider of real-time supply chain visibility and logistics solutions.
Ex. F. On information and belief, FourKites makes strategic business decisions about
developing, marketing, selling, and distributing software solutions from its headquarters in
Chicago. Id. On information and belief, FourKites’ executives and documents, including those
related to its relationship with Ruiz Foods, are located in Chicago. Id.
C.

MacroPoint First Chose Its Home Forum—Ohio—To Pursue Its Patent
Claims Against FourKite’s Technology.

This case is a proxy-fight in a broader dispute between MacroPoint and FourKites, which
supplies the technology that forms the basis for MacroPoint’s allegations in this case.
FourKites makes and sells freight tracking products and services. Ex. F. In 2015,
MacroPoint sued FourKites, in its home forum of the Northern District of Ohio, for infringing
five of its other patents.4 See dkt. # 16, Case No. 15-cv-1002 (N.D. Ohio). FourKites moved to
dismiss those claims on the grounds that those patents were invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Dkt.
# 16, Case No. 15-cv-1002 (N.D. Ohio). While that motion was pending, MacroPoint and
FourKites engaged in significant discovery based on the schedule entered in that case. See Dkt. #
15, Case No. 15-cv-1002 (N.D. Ohio). The schedule required service and response to written
discovery, document production, service of infringement, non-infringement, and invalidity

4

In 2014, MacroPoint also used the Ohio Court to assert one of those patents against SaleBug.com, LLC et al. See
Case No. 14-cv-312 (N.D. Ohio). That suit, which is now dismissed, did not concern FourKites’ freight tracking
products and services.

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 11 of 22 PageID #: 99

contentions, and the exchange of Markman disclosures. Id.
The parties also educated the Ohio Court about the technology underlying the asserted
patents. All told, MacroPoint and FourKites filed more than seven hundred pages worth of briefs
and exhibits. Dkt. ## 6, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, Case No. 15-cv-1002 (N.D. Ohio). MacroPoint’s
filings included two expert reports, totaling more than one hundred pages, that allegedly
explained the technology underlying the asserted patents. Dkt. ## 21-3, 24-1, Case No. 15-cv1002 (N.D. Ohio).
D.

MacroPoint Was Unsuccessful, and Its Patents Were Invalidated by the Ohio
Court.

On November 6, 2015, the Ohio Court granted FourKites’ motion to dismiss and entered
an order finding all of the claims of the asserted patents invalid. Dkt. # 26, Case No. 15-cv-1002
(N.D. Ohio). In a detailed, fourteen page memorandum opinion and order, the Ohio Court
analyzed the asserted patents under both the two-step Alice standard, as well as the earlier
machine-or-transformation test, and determined that the asserted patents were limited to
unpatentable subject matter. Dkt. # 25, Case No. 15-cv-1002 (N.D. Ohio). MacroPoint’s appeal
of that decision is currently pending. See Case No. 16-1286 (Fed. Cir.).
E.

The FourKites-MacroPoint Dispute Regarding the ‘659 and ‘358 Patents is
Now Also Pending in Ohio.

On November 4, 2016, FourKites sued MacroPoint in the Ohio Court. FourKites’ claims
include requests for declaratory judgments that the ’659 patent and ’358 patent are invalid and
not infringed. See Ex. G. Additionally, however, FourKites’ claims also include several business
torts, including for violations of the Lanham Act, deceptive trade practices and unfair
competition and tortious interference. Id.

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
A.

Transfers under Section 1404(a).

Section 1404(a) provides that “[f]or the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the
interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division
where it might have been brought.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). The goals of § 1404(a) are to prevent
waste of time, energy, and money, and also to protect litigants, witnesses, and the public against
unnecessary inconvenience and expense. Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 616 (1964). The
party seeking transfer of venue must show good cause for the transfer. In re Volkswagen of
America, Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 315 (5th Cir. 2004).
A threshold question is “whether the judicial district to which transfer is sought would
have been a district in which the claim could have been filed.” In re Volkswagen AG, 371 F.3d
201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004). Once met, the question turns in balancing public and private factors
relating to the convenience of parties and witnesses as well as the interest of particular venues in
hearing the case. Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. Bell Marine Serv., Inc., 321 F.2d 53, 56 (5th Cir.
1963). The private factors include: (1) access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of
compulsory process; (3) the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical
problems. Id. The public factors include: (1) court congestion; (2) the local interest; (3) the
familiarity with the governing law; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflicts of
laws or in the application of foreign law. Id.
B.

Stays of Litigation and the Customer-Suit Exception.

A district court has the inherent authority to stay proceedings. “[T]he power to stay
proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the
causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”
Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). In deciding whether to stay litigation pending

6

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 13 of 22 PageID #: 101

other proceedings, courts typically consider: (1) whether a stay will unduly prejudice or present a
clear tactical disadvantage to the nonmoving party, (2) whether a stay will simplify the issues in
question and trial of the case, and (3) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has
been set. Soverain Software LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 356 F. Supp. 2d 660, 662 (E.D. Tex.
2005).
“When a patent owner files an infringement suit against a manufacturer’s customer and
the manufacturer then files an action of noninfringement or patent invalidity, the suit by the
manufacturer generally take[s] precedence.” In re Nintendo of Am., Inc., 756 F.3d 1363, 1365
(Fed. Cir. 2014). “This ‘customer-suit’ exception to the ‘first-to-file’ rule exists to avoid, if
possible, imposing the burdens of trial on the customer, for it is the manufacturer who is
generally the ‘true defendant’ in the dispute.” Id. “[A] primary question is whether the issues and
parties are such that the disposition of one case would be dispositive of the other.” Katz v. Lear
Siegler, Inc., 909 F.2d 1459, 1463 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
IV.

ARGUMENT
A.

The Court Should Transfer This Case to the Northern District of Ohio.
1.

MacroPoint Could Have Sued Ruiz Foods in Ohio.

There can be no genuine dispute that suit could have been brought in the Northern
District of Ohio. MacroPoint alleges that Ruiz Foods infringes the patents-in-suit by “us[ing]
machines or groups of machines to monitor location of vehicles carrying freight of Ruiz or
location of freight or location of both vehicles and freight as part of its day-to-day business
operations.” See, e.g., dkt. # 1 at ¶ 5. As MacroPoint alleges, Ruiz Foods “operate[s] trucks or
other vehicles to deliver freight . . . to various distributors or retailers.” Id. Ruiz Foods’
distributors include sixteen locations in the State of Ohio. Ex. H. Therefore, as Ruiz Foods would
have been subject to personal jurisdiction in Ohio at least under a specific jurisdiction theory,

7

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 14 of 22 PageID #: 102

this case could have been brought in the Northern District of Ohio. See, e.g., Software Rights
Archive, LLC v. Google, Inc., 2:07-CV-511-CE, 2010 WL 2950351, at *2 (E.D. Tex. July 22,
2010).
2.

The Public & Private Factors Strongly Favor Transfer.
a.

Judicial Economy and the Risk of Inconsistent Adjudication
Weigh Overwhelmingly in Favor of Transfer.

This case should be transferred to the Northern District of Ohio so that a single court,
which is already familiar with the subject matter of the patents-in-suit, can preside over the
parties’ related claims and defenses. The purpose of § 1404(a) “is to prevent the waste of time,
energy and money and to protect litigants, witnesses and the public against unnecessary
inconvenience and expense.” Van Dusen, 376 U.S. at 616. “Such concerns can be alleviated by
transferring a case to . . . a district familiar with the patent-in-suit.” ColorQuick, L.L.C. v.
Vistaprint Ltd., No. 6:09-CV-323, 2010 WL 5136050, at *7 (E.D. Tex. July 22, 2010); see also
In re Vicor Corp., 493 Fed. App’x 59, 61 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“[T]he existence of multiple lawsuits
involving the same issues is paramount consideration when determining whether a transfer is in
the interest of justice.”); ComCam Int’l, Inc. v. Mobotix Corp., No. 2:13-CV-798, 2014 WL
4229711 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2014) (“Where multiple and parallel lawsuits in two different
jurisdictions are contemplated, judicial economy weighs heavily in the Court’s transfer
analysis.”).
The significant overlap between this case and the FourKites-MacroPoint dispute in Ohio
strongly favors transfer. See Invitrogen Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., No. 6:08-CV-112, 2009 WL
331891, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 9, 2009). The patents-in-suit concern the same subject matter and
technology that was previously litigated in the Ohio Court. Compare, e.g., Exs. A, B with Ex. I.
Indeed, one of the two patents is from the same family as those invalidated patents. Ex. A.

8

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 15 of 22 PageID #: 103

Where there has been “a prior suit based on closely related patents” and the transferee Court has
experience with the subject matters of the parties’ dispute, judicial economy weighs in favor of
transfer. See Kinetic Concepts, Inc. v. Medela AG, No. 2:07-CV-187, 2008 WL 112120, at *2
(E.D. Tex. Jan. 9, 2008).
The case for transfer is even stronger in the present circumstances. Not only are the
patents-in-suit closely related to the invalidated patents, but the pending FourKites-MacroPoint
dispute also concerns the patents-in-suit. Ex. G. That is, the Ohio Court will be presiding over
the exact same questions of infringement and validity as would be considered in this case. Thus,
not only would transfer promote judicial economy, but it would also eliminate the risk of
inconsistent adjudication that arises when overlapping cases proceed in parallel. See, e.g., WiLAN Inc. v. Apple, Inc., Case No. 6:11-cv-453, Dkt. # 225, slip op. at 4 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 14,
2012) (granting motion to transfer because it would “allow one judge to more efficiently resolve
the common issues, reduce duplicative work on the part of the Court and the parties, and reduce
the risk of inconsistent adjudications”).
These factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer.
b.

Access to Sources of Proof Favors Transfer.

The evidence and witnesses relevant to the claims and defenses in this case are more
easily accessible in the Northern District of Ohio than in the Eastern District of Texas.
While “the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer,” In re
Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009), this case is not the usual case.
MacroPoint’s allegations are not based on anything that Ruiz Foods made, sold, or offered for
sale. Dkt. # 1 at ¶ 22. Rather, MacroPoint claims that Ruiz Foods infringes the patents-in-suit by
using freight tracking products and services developed by FourKites. Id. Thus, “the bulk of the
relevant evidence” will be coming from FourKites, which is located in Chicago, and not from
9

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 16 of 22 PageID #: 104

Ruiz Foods. Likewise, the witnesses who will testify as to the design and operation of the
underlying accused technology will be FourKites witnesses, not Ruiz Foods witnesses. Ex. F.
The remaining party witnesses—MacroPoint’s employees and the named inventor—all
reside in Ohio, far closer to the Northern District of Ohio than to this Court. Ex. J. Third-party
witnesses, such as the prosecuting attorney Luis Carrion, are also located in Ohio. Ex. C.
In contrast, Ruiz Foods is aware of no relevant evidence or witnesses located in this
district. Ex. D at ¶ 5. Although Ruiz Foods has a food manufacturing facility in Denison, its
headquarters, including the personnel who would have been responsible for any decisions
relevant to this case and all their related documents, are located in California. Id. at ¶ 4. Any
difference in the relative ease of accessing these sources from the Northern District of Ohio or
this district will be negligible and far outweighed by the far improved access to the evidence in
FourKites’ and MacroPoint’s possession. Id.
c.

Transfer Would Increase the Availability of Compulsory
Process to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses.

This factor favors transfer because the Northern District of Ohio has absolute subpoena
power over at least some third-party witnesses, whereas this Court has absolute subpoena power
over none. The availability of compulsory process weighs in favor of transfer when the
transferee district would have “absolute subpoena power,” i.e., subpoena power for both
depositions and trial, over more third-party witnesses than the transferor district. In re HoffmannLa Roche Inc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The focus of this factor is on witnesses for
whom compulsory process to attend trial might be necessary. See Phoenix Licensing, L.L.C. v.
Gen. Motors, LLC, No. 2:13-CV-1093, 2015 WL 1431906, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2015).
Ruiz Foods is not aware of any third-party witnesses over which this Court has absolute
subpoena power. The Northern District of Ohio, however, would have absolute subpoena power

10

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 17 of 22 PageID #: 105

over the prosecuting attorneys. See, e.g., In re Acer Am. Corp., 626 F.3d 1252, 1256 (Fed. Cir.
2010) (citing location of prosecuting attorneys as fact favoring transfer); Nidec Motor Corp. v.
Broad Ocean Motor LLC, No. 2:15-CV-443, 2016 WL 776986, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 29, 2016)
(same). Thus, this factor weighs in favor of transfer because the Northern District of Ohio has
absolute subpoena power over at least some third-party witnesses.
d.

Northern District of Ohio is More Convenient for Most
Witnesses.

The Northern District of Ohio is more convenient for the inventor, MacroPoint’s
witnesses, and anticipated third-party witnesses. “The convenience of the witnesses is probably
the single most important factor in a transfer analysis.” In re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338,
1342 (Fed. Cir. 2009). While this factor considers all parties and witnesses, the convenience to
non-party witnesses is afforded greater weight. See NovelPoint Learning LLC v. LeapFrog
Enterprises, Inc., 6:10-CV-229, 2010 WL 5068146, at *6 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2010).
The FourKites-MacroPoint dispute is pending in Cleveland, Ohio. Ex. K. MacroPoint and
the third-party prosecuting attorney Luis Carrion are also in Cleveland. Ex. C. The inventor, Mr.
Adelson, resides in Highland Heights, Ohio—a suburb approximately ten miles from Cleveland.
Ex. A. In contrast, it is 981 miles from Cleveland to the courthouse in Tyler, Texas. Ex. L.
Cleveland is also more convenient for the third-party FourKites witnesses. The distance
from Chicago to Cleveland is approximately 350 miles. Ex. M. The distance could be driven in
as little as six hours. Id. The distance from Chicago to Tyler is approximately 900 miles. Ex. N.
To drive that distance would take at least thirteen hours. Id. Furthermore, there are numerous
direct flights between Chicago and Cleveland which take about an hour and fifteen minutes,
thereby allowing witnesses to avoid overnight stays. In contrast, there are no direct flights from
Chicago to Tyler and it would be virtually impossible for a Chicago area witness to travel to

11

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 18 of 22 PageID #: 106

Tyler and return to Chicago on the same day. Ex. O See Volkswagen, 371 F.3d at 205 (observing
that overnight stays increase the time that witnesses need to be away from home).
These differences are not insignificant. Cleveland witnesses could easily attend trial
without incurring any travel or lodging expenses, and without being away from their homes.
FourKites witnesses could attend trial, without staying overnight in Cleveland. In contrast, these
witnesses could not attend trial in Tyler without at least a half-day of travel each way, and at
least a one night—more likely a two night—stay. This represents not only additional costs in
terms of airfare and hotels, but also time away from family and from their respective businesses.
Ruiz Foods’ witnesses will be inconvenienced regardless. Dinuba is located outside
Fresno, California. Ex. P. Whether these witnesses travel to Tyler or Cleveland, they will incur a
day of travel each way, and need to stay overnight at least two days. Exs. Q, R. While Tyler may
be closer than Cleveland, practically speaking the differences in convenience are negligible, and
far outweighed by the gains in convenience for the MacroPoint witnesses and, most importantly,
the non-party FourKites and Ohio witnesses.
e.

The Northern District of Ohio Has a Significant Local Interest
in the Resolution of this Case.

MacroPoint is a Cleveland, Ohio company, and first chose its home forum—the Northern
District of Ohio—to assert its patents against the FourKites technology. While it failed, and
many of its patents have already been invalidated, it must have no doubt believed that the people
of its home forum, and not the people of the Eastern District of Texas, were those who have a
vested interest in the outcome of this litigation. Indeed, “[j]ury duty is a burden that ought not to
be imposed upon the people of a community which has no relation to the litigation.”
Volkswagen, 371 F.3d at 206. The local interest factor is strong when “the cause of action calls
into question the work and reputation of several individuals residing in or near that district and

12

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 19 of 22 PageID #: 107

who presumably conduct business in that community.” Hoffman-La Roche, 587 F.3d at 1336.
The Eastern District of Texas has no localized interest in this dispute. Although Ruiz
Foods has a food manufacturing facility in Denison, the allegedly infringing activities—
monitoring the location of vehicles carrying freight of Ruiz or location of freight or location of
both vehicles and freight as part of its day-to-day business operations—is done throughout the
country and supervised from its headquarters in California. Ex. D at ¶ 4–6. Thus, the Eastern
District of Texas has “no more or less of a meaningful connection to this case than any other
venue.” TS Tech, 551 F.3d at 1321.
f.

The Remaining Factors Are Neutral.

The speed with which a case can come to trial and be resolved may be relevant to
transfer. In re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (discussing district court’s
crediting of Federal Judicial Caseload Statistics). To the extent median time interval to trial is
relevant, the 2015 Federal Judicial Caseload Statistics indicates that the median time interval to
trial in the Eastern District of Texas is 22.1 months, which is negligibly different than the
Northern District of Ohio’s time to trial of 22.2 months. Ex. S. Ultimately, this is the “most
speculative” factor. Promote Innovation LLC v. Leviton Mfg. Co., No. 2:10-CV-235, 2011 WL
672663, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 17, 2011). Finally, there should be no dispute that both the Eastern
District of Texas and the Northern District of Ohio are equally familiar with and capable of
applying the governing patent laws, and that there exist no unnecessary conflicts of law to be
resolved. Therefore, each of these factors is neutral.
B.

Alternatively, This Case Should Be Stayed.

To the extent the Court finds this case should not be transferred, it should be stayed
pending the resolution of the FourKites-MacroPoint dispute under the customer-suit exception
and resolution of MacroPoint’s appeal of the Ohio Court’s invalidity decision.
13

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 20 of 22 PageID #: 108

1.

This Is a Classic Customer-Suit Situation.

After first suing—and losing—to the supplier of the technology at issue here, namely
FourKites, MacroPoint came to this Court to sue a customer/user of the same technology.
FourKites, however, has filed an action in the same court that already has addressed
MacroPoint’s patents and its technology, the Northern District of Ohio. The suit seeks, among
other things, declaratory judgments of non-infringement and patent invalidity for the same
patents-in-suit. Ex. G. As the supplier of the allegedly infringing products and services,
FourKites’ suit should “take precedence” because it is the “‘true defendant’ in the dispute.”
Nintendo, 756 F.3d at 1365.
The issues in this case are duplicative of, and subsumed by, the issues presented in the
FourKites-MacroPoint dispute. In disposing of the FourKites-MacroPoint dispute, the Ohio
Court will resolve the primary questions in this case—whether the patents-in-suit are valid and
whether the use of FourKites’ freight tracking products and services infringe any of their claims.5
Ex. G. In such a situation, “it is clear that there was no need to proceed with” this action because
the one in Ohio “may suffice.” In re Google Inc., 588 Fed. App’x 988, 990 (Fed. Cir. 2014).
“The only potential results of adjudicating these cases in parallel fashion would be . . . wasteful
and unnecessary litigation . . . [or] conflicting decisions.” Id.
Accordingly, to the extent that the Court decides against transfer, the Court should stay
this customer suit pending resolution of the FourKites-MacroPoint dispute.
2.

A Discretionary Stay is Also Appropriate.

Finally, at a minimum, the Court should stay these proceedings pending resolution of
MacroPoint’s appeal of the Ohio Court’s prior decision. A stay will not cause any prejudice
5

Ruiz Foods agrees to be bound by the Ohio Court’s determination of whether the patents-in-suit are valid and
whether the use of FourKites’ freight tracking products and services infringes any of their claims.

14

Case 6:16-cv-01133-RWS-KNM Document 13 Filed 11/11/16 Page 21 of 22 PageID #: 109

because this case is at its inception—discovery has not even begun, let alone been completed,
and no trial date or Markman hearing has been set. Rather than prejudice a party, a stay will
benefit everyone, including the Court, because the Federal Circuit’s decision will inevitably
inform the Court and the parties’ positions in this case. If the case is not stayed, and the parties
proceed in parallel with that appeal, then work will need to be redone and resources wasted in
light of the Federal Circuit’s reasoning. Therefore, the Court should exercise its discretion and its
inherent authority to control its docket by entering a stay in this case pending resolution of the
MacroPoint appeal.
V.

CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Defendant Ruiz Foods Products, Inc. prays the Court enter an order

granting this motion and transferring this case the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio, or in the alternative, staying this case pending resolution of FourKites, Inc. v.
MacroPoint, LLC, Case No. 15-cv-2703 (N.D. Ohio) and resolution of MacroPoint, LLC v.
FourKites, Inc., Case No. 16-1286 (Fed. Cir.), and for all other relief that it deems just and
proper.
