PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THE
THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”), by and through undersigned counsel and
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and 16(b) hereby moves for entry of an order granting Plaintiff
leave to amend the Third Amended Complaint against the remaining Defendant, Michael
Harrison, and in support thereof states:
1.

Fed. R. Civ. P. (15)(a) provides that “a party may amend its pleading only with . .

. the court’s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.” Id. “[A] party
seeking to amend a pleading after the date specified in a scheduling order must first show ‘good
cause’ for the amendment under Rule 16(b); then, if good cause is shown, the party must
demonstrate that the amendment is proper under Rule 15.” Midland Nat. Life Ins. Co. v. Ash
Fin. Holdings Grp., Inc., 2007 WL 1749222, at *3 (N.D. Ind. 2007) (granting motion for leave to
amend after court’s scheduling deadline where discovery and investigation was necessary to
determine validity of the proposed amendment and therefore plaintiff could not have met the
court imposed deadline.) A motion under Rule 15 should be granted in the absence of “undue

1

delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, prejudice, or futility.” Id., citing Barry Aviation Inc. v. Land
O'Lakes Mun. Airport Comm'n, 377 F.3d 682, 687 (7th Cir.2004).
2.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) states that the court may modify a scheduling order “for

good cause and with the judge’s consent.” Id. “Good cause depends primarily on ‘the diligence
of the party seeking amendment.’” Durden v. Semafore Pharm., Inc., 2011 WL 2118952 (S.D.
Ind. 2011) quoting Trustmark Ins. Co. v. Gen. & Cologne Life Re of Am., 424 F.3d 542, 553 (7th
Cir.2005).

“The ‘good cause’ standard is met if the party promptly moves to amend the

pleadings after learning facts which provide the basis for the amendment.” Bridgeport Pain
Control Ctr., Ltd. v. Cutera, Inc., 2009 WL 510888 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (granting motion for leave to
amend under Rule 16(b)(4) where “the proposed amendment [would] not materially change the
complexion of the case or alter the legal basis under which [Plaintiff] seeks relief.”)
3.

Here, the discovery process has revealed the necessity for Plaintiff to conform its

pleadings to be consistent with its trial strategy, which has been shaped and determined by the
course of discovery. As the case has progressed with trial approaching, Plaintiff’s analysis of the
case has allowed it to gain a better understanding of how the case will be tried and the pleadings
should be consistent therewith.
4.

Specifically, as a result of discovery and the progression of the case, Plaintiff has

decided not to pursue its claim for contributory infringement, to seek statutory damages in lieu of
actual damages, and has concluded that it will introduce evidence of additional infringements for
the purpose of proving that Defendant committed the originally identified infringements.
5.

Granting Plaintiff leave to amend the Third Amended Complaint is in the parties’

and the Court’s best interest since an accurate operative complaint will be consistent with the
issues that will be presented at trial. And, allowing Plaintiff to join the additional infringement

2

claims against Defendant is in his best interest and the interest of judicial economy, since
Plaintiff would otherwise be required file a separate case against the same Defendant for those
additional infringements which will already be used as evidence in this case.
6.

Pursuant to this Court’s Scheduling Order of July 9, 2013, the deadline to amend

the pleadings was August 30, 2013.

CM/ECF 110, at p. 2 (“No later than August 30, 2013 –

Any party who wants to amend its Complaint, Answer, or other pleading must file a motion
requesting permission to do so.”). Subsequent to the amendment deadline, and as a result of
recent developments and discovery issues, Plaintiff has changed its trial strategy. Obviously,
Plaintiff could not have amended the Complaint to be consistent with a strategy not yet in
existence prior to the amendment deadline.
7.

To explain, this case started with eleven Defendants. It now appears that Plaintiff

will only be trying the case against one of them. The reduction in the number of Defendants
makes the election to receive statutory damages more palatable.
8.

Ultimately, the proposed amendments are relatively minor and the basic nature of

the allegations in the case relating to BitTorrent copyright infringement of Plaintiff’s works
remains the same.
9.

Plaintiff has been diligent in the prosecution of this case but could not have

predicted the course of the litigation and discovery.
10.

Granting the instant Motion will not prejudice any party and will instead provide

the parties and the Court with a clean updated version of the operative complaint.
11.

This motion is made in good faith and not for any improper purpose such as

undue delay.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC, respectfully requests entry of an order:
