INTRODUCTION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

2

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States Government’s power to

3

apprehend foreign nationals suspected of terrorism-related activities outside of the conventional

4

judicial process has greatly expanded under the Bush and Obama administrations’ extraordinary

5

rendition program. This expansion of the United States’ power has been justified by the rationale

6

that “enemy combatants” who are taking affirmative steps to commit violent acts against United

7

States citizens are subject to the rules of war and not entitled to judicial process. In the context of

8

individuals suspected of nonviolent violations of the United States’ criminal laws, however, the

9

Government’s power to conduct extraterritorial apprehensions of foreigners is significantly limited

10

by United States law, extradition treaties, and general principles of international law. Respecting

11

the rights of these individuals, and the sovereignty of the nations where they reside or travel, is

12

absolutely critical to maintaining the United States’ position in the world as a country that stands

13

as a moral beacon, a symbol of freedom, and a nation that respects the rule of law. Furthermore,

14

our commitment to these principles lends authority and credibility to government efforts to protect

15

United States citizens abroad who might be subject to the persecution or spurious claims of a foreign

16

country.

17

Defendant Roman Seleznev is a young Russian national who is accused of engaging in

18

“hacking” activities ultimately leading to alleged financial losses in the Western District of

19

Washington. He has no criminal record and no ties to this country. This past summer, while on a

20

vacation with his family to the Maldives, nearly 9,000 miles away from Seattle, Mr. Seleznev was

21

abducted – literally – by United States Secret Service agents acting with what appears to be zero

22

lawful authorization by the Maldivian government. Mr. Seleznev was separated from his family,

23

handcuffed, bundled onto a private jet (chartered by the agents), then flown to the United States

24

territory of Guam – nearly ten hours away – for his initial appearance on this matter.

Case 2:11-cr-00070-RAJ Document 132 Filed 04/07/15 Page 3 of 37

1

After Mr. Seleznev’s abduction, the United States quickly issued press releases lauding its

2

“state-of-the-art investigative techniques” and its ability to bring “cyber crooks” to justice. 1 Russia

3

quickly lashed out – in the press, and in official statements – calling the U.S. operation a

4

“kidnapping” and a “gross violation of the laws of any civilized state and international law.” 2 Media

5

reports followed the subsequent diplomatic posturing and fallout in the Maldives, the Russian

6

Federation and the United States. Amidst all this, Mr. Seleznev – a man with no known criminal

7

record who is accused of purely economic crimes – languishes in a jail in a country that he did not

8

choose to enter voluntarily, and to which he was not lawfully extradited. Whether this stands is a

9

question of the utmost importance.

10

The truth of the matter is that the United States, in its zeal to apprehend Mr. Seleznev,

11

abandoned its commitment to the rule of law. It did so by: (i) violating United States law

12

prohibiting the execution of arrest warrants on foreign soil; (ii) circumventing the fundamental legal

13

protections Maldivian law provides to those lawfully within its territory; and (iii) disregarding

14

international agreements the United States has signed with Russia, Interpol, and the United Nations.

15

The United States’ conscious decision to overrun at least three separate bodies of substantive

16

law – in addition to further weakening our nation’s image overseas and potentially jeopardizing the

17

safety and liberty of our citizens traveling or residing abroad – hopelessly taints this prosecution,

STATEMENT OF FACTS

4

A.

Mr. Seleznev is Indicted in absentia in 2011.

5

Defendant Roman Seleznev is a 30-year-old citizen and resident of the Russian Federation

6

(“Russia”) with only a limited grasp of the English language and no significant ties to the United

7

States. 3

8

On March 3, 2011, Mr. Seleznev was indicted, under seal, in the Western District of

9

Washington on numerous counts of Bank Fraud, Intentional Damage to a Protected Computer,

10

Obtaining Information from a Protected Computer, Possession of Fifteen or More Unauthorized

11

Access Devices, Trafficking in Unauthorized Access Devices, and Aggravated Identity Theft

12

relating to allegations of computer “hacking” and credit card theft. 4 A Superseding Indictment was

13

returned two weeks later, also under seal, and a now Second Superseding Indictment, issued on

14

October 10, 2014, currently represents the Government’s accusations against Mr. Selevnez. 5 Other

15

than several Orders granting limited unsealing of the Indictment at the United States’ request – for

16

the purpose of attempting to lawfully arrest and extradite Mr. Seleznev to the United States to stand

17

trial – there was no action in the case until the summer of 2014. 6

the Maldives to Expel Mr. Seleznev.

Since the time the United States obtained Mr. Seleznev’s initial indictment, it has known he
20
was in Russia. Internal Secret Service reports produced by the United States indicate that the Secret

Service was aware that Mr. Seleznev resided in Russia as early as March 2013, but deliberately

2

avoided taking action under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the United States and

3

Russia. 7

4

At some undisclosed point in June of 2014, through undisclosed means, the United States

5

became aware that Mr. Seleznev planned to travel on a vacation with his family to the Republic of

6

the Maldives (“the Maldives”), and initiated efforts to apprehend him there. On July 3, 2014, Secret

7

Service Special Agent Dan Schwandner traveled to the Maldives to determine whether Mr.

8

Seleznev was indeed present there and, if so, to see what the United States’ “options would be

9

regarding the possible turning over of Mr. Seleznev to U.S. authorities.” 8 Because the United States

10

has not signed an extradition treaty with the Maldives, the United States had no right to demand

11

that the Maldives arrest Mr. Seleznev and transfer him to the Secret Service’s custody; rather, they

12

were duty-bound to pursue the matter through diplomatic channels and Maldivian law.

13

On July 3, 2014, the United States Embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka sent a diplomatic note

14

to the Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the “removal” of Mr. Seleznev “by way of

15

deportation, expulsion, or other means available under the laws of the Maldives.” 9 The letter made

16

it clear that the United States was requesting the Maldives’ assistance on a purely voluntary basis,

17

and closed by noting that “[w]hile the United States would appreciate the assistance of the Maldives

18

in returning SELEZNEV to the United States, because of limitations imposed by U.S. law, we

19

would not be in a position to guarantee reciprocity in the event of the Maldives’ interest in our

Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the United States of America.”

similarly deporting or expelling someone to the Maldives.” 10 The United States has never produced

2

any correspondence from the Maldives Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorizing Mr. Seleznev’s

3

abduction.

4

On July 4, 2014, United States Secret Service Special Agent David Iacovetti met with

5

authorities from an unspecified branch of the Maldivian government and apparently requested that

6

they assist him in apprehending Mr. Seleznev. 11 Internal Secret Service emails produced by the

7

United States show that State Department Assistant Regional Security Officer D. Michael

8

Lashinsky also requested the assistance of Maldives Police Service Commissioner Hussain Waheed

9

in “coordinating the expulsion” of Mr. Seleznev with Maldives Attorney General Uz Mohamed

10

Anil. 12 In a set of incomplete emails from July 4, 2014 with the subject “Final Op Plan – USSS,”

11

Mr. Lashinsky told Mark Smith, another State Department official from the embassy in Colombo,

12

that “[w]e’re waiting on the judge to issue the court order/warrant” and that he was “[b]eing told

13

the warrant will be done at 9.” 13 According to Special Agent Schwandner’s testimony, the

14

Maldivian police requested a copy of an Interpol “Red Notice” late in the evening on July 4, 2014

15

before they would proceed with expelling or arresting Mr. Seleznev. 14 The request for an arrest

16

warrant was apparently denied: the United States has never produced any warrant or order from a

17

Maldivian court expelling Mr. Seleznev or authorizing his abduction.

18

At 8:34 p.m. on the evening of July 4, 2014, Mr. Smith sent an image file titled

1

has never explained who “hussainusham” is, or why United States officials were coordinating Mr.

2

Seleznev’s abduction with him or her. Mr. Smith’s contact with hussainusham or anyone bearing a

3

similar name is omitted from the Secret Service’s Investigative Report of the incident, 16 and the

4

only evidence that has been produced indicates this individual was either not associated with the

5

Maldivian government, or was a Maldives official who was acting outside of the scope of his

6

authority in coordinating the abduction. 17 The individual responded from a “gmail.com” email

7

address, as opposed to the “@police.gov.mv” or “@foreign.gov.mv” domains reflected in other

8

communications, and in response to a curious email from Mr. Smith on July 14, 2014 (nine days

9

after Mr. Seleznev’s abduction) requesting “that list of names” for his “counterparts back in DC,”

10

hussainusham responded “I’m not in a position to authorize to share the list.” 18

11

Based on the evidence produced to date – or, more accurately, the lack thereof – it is

12

apparent that the abduction of Mr. Seleznev was not authorized by civil authorities in the Maldivian

13

government and was never approved by any Maldivian judicial authority, and not for lack of effort

14

on the part of the United States. Instead, it appears that when the United States was unable to secure

15

timely permission to arrest Mr. Seleznev through proper diplomatic or legal channels, it simply

16

disregarded the Maldives’ sovereign rights, and concocted a scheme to kidnap Mr. Seleznev using

17

means outside the Maldivian legal system.

2

his family returned to Malé from the island on which they had been staying by way of a sea plane

3

and shuttle bus to catch their return flight to Moscow. 20 Unbeknownst to Mr. Seleznev, he was

4

being trailed by Secret Service Special Agent Iacovetti. 21

5

When Mr. Seleznev entered the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport in Malé, he and his

6

family proceeded to the security checkpoint where he was detained by two men he did not recognize

7

and who were not members of the Maldivian police force. They directed Mr. Seleznev to a side

inspection area. 22 According to an eyewitness account, Maldivian police officers were in the

9

vicinity but did not speak to Mr. Selezenev or participate in his arrest in any way. 23

10

Mr. Seleznev was led into a small room with a couch where he was separated from his

family, who were directed into an adjacent room separated by a partial glass door. 24 As soon as Mr.

Seleznev was separated from his family, the United States government agents “rushed” him. 25 One

13

of the agents threw him to the couch and shouted that he was a United States Secret Service agent

and Mr. Seleznev was under arrest. 26 When Mr. Seleznev asked why he was under arrest, the agent

demanded that he be permitted to contact legal counsel, and asked that the men who were arresting

him contact the Russian embassy. 28 Neither request was honored. 29

3

Mr. Seleznev was ordered to empty his pockets, and the agents seized his belongings,

including a laptop, an iPad, and an iPhone. 30 The agents also searched his family’s luggage. Mr.

5

Seleznev’s mug shot was taken. 31 One of the agents ordered Mr. Seleznev to give him his hands,

and Mr. Seleznev was handcuffed. 32 At one point while Mr. Seleznev was being arrested, the door

separating him from his family was opened and he informed his family through the open door that

he was being detained. The agents shouted that Mr. Seleznev was not allowed to talk to anyone and

abruptly shut the door. 33

10

Mr. Seleznev was then led through the airport terminal to a “VIP area” set aside for

passengers traveling by private jet. 34 In an effort to conceal Mr. Seleznev’s arrest from others in the

airport, the agents draped a t-shirt over the handcuffs that bound his wrists and would have clearly

13

indicated to any observer that he was under arrest. 35 Mr. Seleznev was led to another small room,

14

where his passport was stamped with a standard exit stamp (as opposed to those used to mark the

passports of those who are expelled from the country). 36 Mr. Seleznev, still handcuffed, was then

Mr. Seleznev’s initial appearance in the United States District Court for the District of Guam

4

was assigned to United States District Judge Frances Tydingco-Gatewood. The United States first

5

appeared on July 7, 2014, and Mr. Seleznev’s initial appearance was continued at his request on

6

July 14, 2014. 46 On July 21, 2014, Mr. Seleznev filed a Motion to Discharge and Release Defendant

7

Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(A), arguing that the circumstances of Mr. Seleznev’s arrest

8

constituted a fatal defect in the institution of the criminal proceedings against him within the

9

meaning of Rule 12. 47 Mr. Seleznev moved to continue the hearing on his motion to dismiss on

10

July 29, 2014, arguing that the factual basis for the motion, in the absence of any discovery, was

11

woefully incomplete. 48 Judge Tydingco-Gatewood set the argument on Mr. Seleznev’s motion to

12

continue on the same date as the argument on his motion to dismiss – and his initial appearance –

13

and a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5 hearing was conducted for July 31, 2014. 49

14

At the hearing, the United States presented a very different picture of the events that

15

transpired on July 5. According to the testimony of Special Agent Schwandner, he and Special

16

Agent Iacovetti arrived at the Malé airport on the morning of the July 5 and waited in the Maldivian

17

Tourist Police station, where “[a]t approximately 10:20 a.m., the Maldivian tourist police brought

18

Mr. Seleznev and his traveling party into the tourist police station, where he was asked by Special

19

Agent in Charge, Iacovetti, if he would please take a seat on the sofa.” 50 Special Agent Schwandner

20

was adamant that he did not “arrest” Mr. Seleznev in the Maldives, but that the “arrest” instead took

AUTHORITY AND ARGUMENT

The Court Should Dismiss the Indictment and Release Defendant Pursuant to
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(3)(A).

The circumstances of Mr. Seleznev’s abduction – in which United States agents directly and
4
knowingly violated the law of the United States, the law of the Maldives, and generally-applicable
5
principles of international law – constitutes a “defect in the institution” of this proceeding that
6
deprives the Court of jurisdiction over this matter. Accordingly, the case must be dismissed under
7
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(3)(A). Mr. Seleznev’s motion is proper
8
because a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction may be made “at any time while the case is
9
pending” and a motion to dismiss based on a defect in the institution of the proceedings must be
10
made “by pretrial motion if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the motion can
11
be determined without a trial on the merits.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2), 12(b)(3). Judge Tydingco12
Gatewood’s ruling on Mr. Seleznev’s prior motion to dismiss in the District of Guam explicitly
13
recognized this, noting that the “decision on Seleznev’s motion shall not preclude him from
14
reasserting the same allegations at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington
15

for further consideration by that court, based on full discovery.” 59 As stated above, the limited

16
discovery that has been provided by the United States since Judge Tydingco-Gatewood’s ruling –
17
particularly disclosure of email traffic between agents and their Maldivian contacts – although not
18
comprehensive, has nonetheless raised more questions about the legality of this prosecution than it
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

59

Exh. 13, Guam Decision and Order at 6-7 (emphasis supplied). Judge Tydingco-Gatewood also noted her
intent to permit Mr. Seleznev to re-bring his motion no less than four times on the record at the Guam
Proceeding. See Exh. 6, Guam Transcript at 23:10-20, 61:4-8, 69:5-12. Mr. Seleznev expects the United States
may attempt to argue that the instant Motion is improper notwithstanding Judge Tydingco-Gatewood’s
without-prejudice ruling. This argument directly contradicts the position taken by the United States in the
Guam proceeding, where the government argued no less than three times that Judge Tydingco-Gatewood
should defer ruling on Mr. Seleznev’s motion to the Western District of Washington. See, e.g., Exh. 6, Guam
Transcript at 18:25-19:6, 26:7-14, 26:19-24. Given the fact that the United States was able to obtain a denial
of Mr. Seleznev’s motion in Guam based in part on its own assertions that the Western District of Washington
was the proper venue, it would be improper for the United States to now take the position that the District of
Guam was the proper place to decide the issue. The Government should be estopped from doing so here.

has answered, and an evidentiary hearing is necessary to resolve them. 60 As the facts appear, the

only proper remedy for Mr. Seleznev is dismissal.

B.

4

The Indictment against Mr. Seleznev Must be Dismissed if the Circumstances
Surrounding His Apprehension Violated Due Process.

United States courts adhere to the so-called “Ker/Frisbie doctrine,” which provides
5
generally that “the manner by which a defendant is brought to trial does not affect the government’s
6
ability to try him.” United States v. Matta-Ballesteros, 71 F.3d 754, 762 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing Ker
7
v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436, 444 (1886) and Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519, 522 (1952)). The
8
reasoning behind the Ker/Frisbie doctrine is that “due process of law is satisfied when one present
9
in court is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprized of the charges against him and after
10
a fair trial in accordance with constitutional safeguards.” United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504
11
U.S. 655, 662 (1992) (citing Frisbie, 342 U.S. at 522). However, there are two well-established
12
exceptions to this rule: “[T]he Ker/Frisbie doctrine does not apply, and a court is deprived of
13
jurisdiction over an extradited defendant, if either: (1) the transfer of the defendant violated the
14

applicable extradition treaty, 61 or (2) the United States government engaged in ‘misconduct of the

15
most shocking and outrageous kind’ to obtain his presence.” United States v. Anderson, 472 F.3d
16
662, 666 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Matta-Ballesteros, 71 F.3d at 762-64).

20

Absence of an Extradition Treaty Cannot Excuse Violations of Other
Prevailing Laws under the First Ker/Frisbie Exception.

The first prong of the test for whether an arrest and extradition on foreign soil is unlawful is
whether the abduction in question constituted a violation of the applicable extradition treaty. That

21
60

22
23
24
25

To date, discovery received from the Government includes a paucity of documents related to the issues
raised in this Motion. The defense believes that other discovery exists and, contemporaneous with this
Motion, is filing a motion seeking an order compelling discovery. We expect that the Government is in
possession of and will need to produce more information about that nature and circumstances of Mr.
Seleznev’s abduction. The defense reserves the right to supplement the record of facts and exhibits related
to this Motion based on subsequent disclosures received from the Government or ordered by the Court.

61

The United States does not have an extradition treaty with the Maldives.

issue has been at the heart of the inquiry in several of the other cases analyzing the Ker/Frisbie
doctrine and whether actions such as those taken here are legally permissible. See, e.g. United

2

States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655 (1992). However, in this case, that issue has been

3

addressed in a merely cursory fashion, when it has been addressed at all. See, e.g. United States v.

4

Seleznev, Mag. Case No. 14-00056, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109999 (D. Guam, Aug. 7, 2014). This

5

is not because the actions of the United States Secret Service were obviously in compliance with

6

the applicable extradition treaty. Rather, it is because there is no applicable extradition treaty. Id. at

7

*5-6. The lack of an extradition treaty should not, however, give the United States Government the
authority to act in any way it so chooses. To the contrary, the lack of an extradition treaty should

8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

necessitate a much more thorough inquiry into the conduct of the United States Government
officials and the conduct of the Secret Service agents in this case should be treated in the same way
that conduct directly contravening an extradition treaty is treated.
An extradition treaty is a negotiated agreement between two countries through which one
nation may request that the other detain criminals wanted in the first county and send them to that
country for trial. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 939 F.2d 1341, 1349-50 (9th Cir. 1991)
(“Under accepted principles of international law, in the absence of an extradition treaty there is no
general obligation of nations to surrender persons sought by another nations, although a nation
may surrender such individuals as a matter of comity and discretion.”), vacated on other grounds

16

by 505 U.S. 1201 (1991). While it may contain limitations on what process is necessary and what

17

crimes are extraditable, it is first and foremost, an enabling document which gives the requesting

18

party rights that it would not otherwise have. Id. (“Nations enter into extradition treaties in order to

19

impose such legal obligations on one another under appropriate conditions.”); see also Alvarez-

20

Machain, 504 U.S. at 664-65 (1992) (“The Treaty thus provides a mechanism which would not
otherwise exist, requiring, under certain circumstances, the United States and Mexico to extradite

21

individuals to the other country, and establishing the procedures to be followed when the Treaty is

22

invoked.”) (emphasis supplied). It is not a limiting agreement curtailing the otherwise unfettered

23

right of a nation to invade the territorial sovereignty of another country and kidnap an individual

24

for the purpose of conducting criminal proceedings against him. However, that is precisely how

1

the Government had the court in Guam view extradition treaties and it will presumably ask this
Court to do the same.

2

It would be nonsensical to contend that, when a suspect is located in a country with which

3

the United States does not have an extradition treaty, officials of the United States Government are

4

less circumscribed in their ability to apprehend such an individual. Factor v. Laubenheimer, 290

5

U.S. 276, 286-87 (1933) (“[T]he principles of international law recognize no right to extradition

6

apart from treaty. While a government may, if agreeable to its own constitution and laws,

7

voluntarily exercise the power to surrender a fugitive from justice to the country from which he
has fled, and it has been said that it is under a moral duty to do so, the legal right to demand his

8
9

extradition and the correlative duty to surrender him to the demanding country exist only when
created by treaty.”). In the absence of a treaty providing procedure, the United States must comply

10

with domestic law and follow the proper protocols to obtain custody of an individual suspected of

11

a crime.

12
13
14
15

The leading case on whether a prohibition against forcible abduction can be read into an
extradition treaty is the Alvarez-Machain case decided by the Supreme Court in 1992. 504 U.S.
655. In its holding, the Court declined to read an implied prohibition against bypassing the
procedures outlined in the treaty and forcibly kidnapping a suspect into the applicable extradition
treaty between the United States and Mexico. Id. at 665-66. In doing so, it reasoned that the

16

Mexican government was aware of the doctrine established in Ker long before entering into the

17

treaty and, although it considered including a prohibition against kidnapping of suspects in the

18

treaty, it chose not to do so. Id. Therefore, the Court concluded that such a prohibition could not be

19

inferred. Id. At first glance, that may appear to support the Government’s argument because the

20

holding was that prohibitions on forcible abductions must be explicit in the treaty to be applicable.
However, it must be viewed in a different light when considering a country with which the United

21
22

States does not have such a treaty.
The Maldives never consciously entered into an agreement with the United States that

23

ignored the Ker-Frisbie doctrine as the Mexican government did. It never entered into any

24

agreement. Therefore, the proper analysis is one in which all possible prohibitions are still valid.

25

Thus, the only source that can be relied upon for outlining the necessary extradition procedures is

1

Maldivian law which certainly forbids kidnapping including the conduct of the Secret Service
agents here. Unless the Government can show that the Maldives was aware of the Ker-Frisbie

2

doctrine and somehow exempted kidnappings masquerading as valid extraditions from their

3

definition of kidnapping, it cannot rely on the lack of an extradition treaty to support an argument

4

that it did not violate the first prong of the test.
The fact that the absence of an extradition treaty does not give a nation carte blanche to

5
6
7

kidnap a suspect located in another country is further established by the manner in which the
United States treats requests for extradition by countries with which it does not have a treaty
providing process to do so. While United States law does allow extradition to nations with which it

8
9

lacks a treaty, Congress has legislated strict limitations on how a request for such an extradition
can be handled. The United States will only extradite individuals to such countries if the crimes of

10

which they are accused are crimes of violence and the Attorney General has certified in writing

11

that the foreign government has provided him with evidence that the crimes would be crimes of

12

violence under United States law and are not political in nature. 62 18 U.S.C. § 3181(b). Clearly,

13
14
15

under United States law, foreign officials would be committing illegal acts if they came to this
country and kidnapped someone they suspected of a crime, as would any state, local, or federal
government official who allowed them to do so without going through the proper legal channels. If
we have such an expectation of other nations, we cannot act as though the lack of a treaty means

16

that we are allowed to do whatever we want. That is not the American way and it must not be

17

sanctioned by this Court.
ii.

18
19
20
21

Shocking and Outrageous Government Conduct is Prohibited by the
Second Ker/Frisbie Exception.

The second exception to the Ker/Frisbie doctrine was first summarized in the Second
Circuit’s decision in United States v. Toscanino, 500 F.2d 267 (2d Cir. 1974). The defendant in
Toscanino was convicted of smuggling heroin into the United States from Uruguay, and appealed

22
23
24
25

62

It is significant that the United States only allows extradition to nations with which we lack an extradition
treaty for individuals accused of crimes of violence. Thus, if the tables were turned, the United States would
not have granted an extradition request from the Maldives in a case such as this, even if a request were
properly lodged. Perhaps that is why the Maldives balked at the United States’ request, prompting this
unauthorized and unlawful response.

his conviction on the ground that the circumstances under which he was brought into United States

2

custody, in which he was subjected to brutal physical abuse, violated due process principles. Id. at

3

269-70. While recognizing that the defendant’s conviction would normally be permissible under

4

the Ker/Frisbie doctrine, the Toscanino court relied on subsequent Supreme Court cases expanding

5

the reach of the Due Process clause of the Constitution to conclude that the doctrine had since

6

“eroded” and been “weakened.” Id. at 273-74 (citing, inter alia, Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165

7

(1952). The Toscanino court also relied on the Supreme Court’s recent observation that “we may

8

some day be presented with a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so

9

outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial

10

processes in order to obtain a conviction.” Id. at 274 (citing United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423,

11

431-32 (1973)). The court ultimately concluded that due process “require[s] a court to divest itself

12

of jurisdiction over the person of a defendant where it has been acquired as the result of the

13

government’s deliberate, unnecessary and unreasonable invasion of the accused’s constitutional

14

rights” and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing regarding the defendant’s allegations. Id.

15

at 275. 63

16

Since the Toscanino decision was handed down, the Ninth Circuit has consistently affirmed

17

the validity of the exception to the Ker/Frisbie doctrine that it set forth. See United States v. Valot,

18

625 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir. 1980) (recognizing “the exception to the Ker-Frisbie doctrine created

19

by the Second Circuit” and noting that “where the defendant alleges governmental conduct of the

20

most shocking and outrageous kind . . . due process [is] violated and the court [is] required to divest

21

itself of jurisdiction”); see also United States v. Struckman, 611 F.3d 560, 571 (9th Cir. 2010)

22

(“Where the government’s conduct to obtain a defendant’s presence is so shocking and outrageous

23
24
63

25

On remand, the district court found that Toscanino had not presented credible evidence that United States
agents were directly involved in his abuse and reinstated his conviction. 398 F.Supp. 916 (E.D. N.Y. 1975).

While the primary factor that drove the Second Circuit to recognize the “outrageousness”

exception in Toscanino was the physical abuse of the defendant, courts around the country have

since broadened the Toscanino inquiry to include the degree to which the United States respects the

District Columbia, for example, the court relied in part on the fact that the host nation had prior

8

notice of, and had even cooperated with, the United States’ plan, noting that “the DEA actually

9

worked with the Panamanian government to secure custody of Mr. Torres-Garcia, making its

10

conduct less shocking . . . .” United States v. Torres-Garcia, No. 05-267(RMC), 2007 WL 1207204,

11

at *4 (D. D.C. April 24, 2007). In contrast, the government acts more “outrageously” when it

12

kidnaps a defendant sub rosa or in violation of the stated wishes of the host nation. See, e.g.,

13

Toscanino, 500 F.2d at 270 (noting allegation that “the Uruguayan government claims that it has

14

no prior knowledge of the kidnapping nor did it consent thereto and had indeed condemned this

15

kind of apprehension as alien to its laws”).

16

The Ninth Circuit in particular has trended toward examining factors that focus less on the

17

treatment of the defendant and more on the conduct of the United States as it bears on the

18

government’s coordination with the host nation and respect for its laws. See United States v.

19

Anderson, 472 F.3d 662, 667 (2006) (noting defendant’s allegation that United States agents “may

20

have misled Costa Rica into believing Anderson had an unserved prison sentence in North

21

Carolina.”). In a more recent case, the court noted the government’s “quite disturbing” and

22

“considerably troubling” conduct in making “flat misstatements to Panamanian authorities” to

23

obtain custody of the defendant. United States v. Struckman, 611 F.3d 560, 574 (2010). Though the

24

court concluded that the misstatements were essentially “harmless” because they were made after

We are not prepared to say that blatant lies to a foreign government that induce
the foreign government to transfer a defendant to the United States when it
otherwise would not could never amount to conduct so shocking and outrageous as
to violate due process and require dismissal of pending criminal proceedings in the
United States. In this case, though, the district court found that O’Brien’s
misrepresentations came after the Panamanians had already decided to cooperate
with the United States in returning Struckman and had issued the resolutions. So
the Panamanians did not rely on these misrepresentations for that purpose.
Id. (emphasis supplied).

8
As the United States will assuredly point out, the Toscanino exception is narrow; indeed,
9
the undersigned was unable to locate any case law since Toscanino in which a court divested itself
10
from jurisdiction over a case because of the government’s misconduct. And as the United States
11
will also point out, it is true that Mr. Seleznev was not subjected to the type of physical brutality
12
that compelled the Second Circuit to recognize the exception. It is equally true, however, that Mr.
13
Seleznev’s case differs from those of other defendants who have attempted to invoke the Toscanino
14
exception in three absolutely crucial respects. First, United States agents were directly and
15
personally responsible for Mr. Selezenv’s abduction. Second, those agents were acting in knowing
16
violation of United States law, the law of the Maldives, and international law when they arrested
17
Mr. Seleznev – a Russian citizen lawfully present in the Maldives pursuant to a tourist visa – and
18
secreted him onto a chartered jet bound for Guam. In the context of the Ninth Circuit’s evolving
19
perception of the Toscanino exception, this egregious behavior should not be tolerated in the
20
absence of national security concerns, let alone from agents pursuing a suspect in a non-violent,
21
financial crime. And third, after failing to obtain permission to act from the Maldivian court system,
22
Secret Service Agents went much farther in subverting Maldivian authority by taking action
23
anyway. The apparent facts behind Mr. Seleznev’s apprehension compel the Court to provide a

C.

The United States’ Conduct in Abducting Mr. Seleznev Was Shocking and
Outrageous, and Requires Dismissal of this Action.

As set forth below, the United States’ conduct in abducting Mr. Seleznev in plain view of
5
his family by Secret Service agents acting in knowing violation of United States law, the law of the
6
Maldives, and international law meets the Toscanino standard for “outrageous” government
7
conduct and requires dismissal of the indictment.
8
9

i.

United States Government Agents Were Personally and Directly
Responsible for Mr. Seleznev’s Abduction.

10

The first aspect of Mr. Seleznev’s abduction that sets it apart from other abductions that

11

have been tacitly accepted by the federal courts is that it was carried out solely by United States

12

agents. As noted in note 66, supra, after the Second Circuit’s remand in Toscanino, the District

13

Court rejected the defendant’s argument and reinstated his conviction on the ground that the

14

defendant had failed to show that United States agents were involved in his abduction:

15
16
17
18

Assuming all the allegations of the affidavit to be true, there is no claim of
participation by United States officials in the abduction of torture of the defendant.
The defendant has not submitted any credible evidence which would indicate any
participation on the part of United States officials prior to the time the defendant
arrived in this country. Nor is there any evidence which shows that the abduction
was carried out at the direction of United State officials.
Toscanino, 398 F. Supp. at 917 (emphasis supplied). The involvement of United States agents is

19
thus a necessary precondition for dismissal under the exception that was applied in Toscanino, and
20
the degree of involvement by United States agents goes directly to the outrageousness of the
21
government’s conduct. Since the Toscanino decision was handed down, courts have rejected
22
challenges where the United States agents were involved in the defendant’s apprehension, but in
23
nearly every case, the agents were working with the approval and support of local authorities. See,

2

v. Matta-Ballesteros, 71 F.3d 754, 761 (9th Cir. 1995) (rejecting defendant’s argument that

7

truck who allegedly abducted Yousef from the Honduran prison were U.S. Government agents or

8

people working at the behest of the U.S. Government”). It is a very different thing for a defendant

9

to be abducted by police in a different country and handed over to the United States, than it is for a

10

defendant to be personally abducted by a team of United States agents running amok in a foreign

11

nation.

12

That is exactly what happened in this case. As shown by the facts set forth in Section II,

13

supra, and in the supporting exhibits, the Secret Service initially attempted to secure the cooperation

14

of the Maldivian police force and courts in obtaining custody over Mr. Seleznev, but when their

15

efforts fell through, they simply took matters into their own hands. There is no evidence that the

16

Maldivian government formally arrested or expelled Mr. Seleznev. Instead, according to a sworn

17

statement by a disinterested eyewitness, a Maldivian hotel worker who was waiting for guests to

18

arrive, and as corroborated by Maldivian news media reporting on the incident, Maldivian agents

19

did not speak to Mr. Seleznev and did not participate in his abduction in any way. 64 The fact that it

20

was United States Secret Service agents who directly – and independently – committed the flagrant

21

violations of law set forth below is shocking on its face and should compel the Court to exercise its

22

supervisory authority and dismiss this prosecution.

The Secret Service Knowingly Violated United States Law in
Abducting Mr. Seleznev.

2

The Secret Service agents who abducted Mr. Seleznev from the Malé airport on July 5 did

3

so not only directly but also in flagrant and knowing violation of United States laws concerning the

execution of arrest warrants; the statutory scope of the agents’ authority; and Department of Justice

6

a.

7

Mr. Seleznev’s Extraterritorial Arrest Violated the Law
Governing the Execution of Arrest Warrants and the Secret
Service’s Enabling Statute.

8

Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4, an arrest warrant may be executed “within the

9

jurisdiction of the United States or anywhere else a federal statute authorizes arrest.” Fed. R. Crim.

10

P. 4(c)(2). 65 This rule not only prohibits the execution of arrest warrants outside of the territorial

11

jurisdiction of the United States, but also provides that courts lack jurisdiction to issue warrants that

12

will be executed outside of the United States. See Alvarez-Machain v. United States, 331 F.3d 604,

13

641 (9th Cir. 2003) (“The district court that issued Alvarez’s arrest warrant had no jurisdiction to

14

issue a warrant for an arrest in Mexico.” (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(2)), rev’d on other grounds,

15

Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (2004) (holding there is no common law

16

federal claim for an arrest that violates general principles of international law)). It is beyond

17

question that the Secret Service agents arrested Mr. Seleznev outside of the jurisdiction of the

18

United States.

19

As this Court is aware, an “arrest” is defined extremely broadly and “occurs when a law

20

enforcement officer, through coercion, physical force, or a show of authority, in some way restricts

21

the liberty of a person.” Hopkins v. Bonvicino, 573 F.3d 752, 773 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation

22

omitted). “A person's liberty is restrained when, taking into account all of the circumstances

25

The clause of Rule 4 authorizing the execution of arrest warrants wherever statutorily authorized was added
to the rule in 2002 to reflect the recent enactment of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, Pub. L. No.
106-523. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 4 advisory committee’s note. It is undisputed that the Secret Service’s actions
in abducting Mr. Seleznev were not statutorily authorized.

surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person

2

that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.” Id. (internal

3

quotation omitted). Here, Mr. Seleznev’s abduction in the Malé airport bears every hallmark of an

4

arrest: Special Agent Schwandner testified that once his encounter with Mr. Seleznev began, Mr.

5

Seleznev was not free to walk away, was placed in Agent Schwandner’s handcuffs, did not have a

6

choice about whether to board the jet, and did not board the jet voluntarily. 66 Even the press releases

7

issued by the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security state that the Secret Service

8

“arrested” Mr. Seleznev on July 5, 2014 – before he arrived in Guam on July 6. 67 Making his

9

misconduct even more flagrant, Agent Schwandner knew he had no authority to make the arrest,

10

and misrepresented the nature of his interaction with Mr. Seleznev at the motion hearing before

11

Judge Tydingco-Gatewood:

12

Q:

Okay. So he’s in your custody at that point, right? You’ve handcuffed him?

13

A:

That is the beginning of the point where he is being turned over from the
Maldivian authorities to the U.S.

Q:

And he was still on – and geographically, he was –

A:

But he’s not technically under arrest. He’s not under arrest by the U.S.
authorities at that time, though. I have no authority in the Maldives. 68

14
15
16
17

This wordplay is telling. Secret Service Agents clearly knew that arresting of Mr. Seleznev

18

in the Maldives would be improper without formal legal process from that country. If they believed

19

their actions were proper, they would have been frank with the court about the true nature of those

20

actions. But they clearly were not, indicating that they knew their actions were improper and feared

21

that being honest about them would lead to dismissal of the charges.

Furthermore, the Secret Service agents’ actions were ultra vires. The Secret Service

2

enabling statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3056, provides that “officers and agents of the Secret Service are

3

authorized to – (A) execute warrants issued under the laws of the United States.” 18 U.S.C. §

4

2035(c)(1). Thus, because the warrant was not properly executed, the agents were acting outside

their scope of authority. The only remedy for these knowing violations of United States law is

dismissal.

Mr. Seleznev’s Abduction Violated Department of Justice
Guidelines for the Extraterritorial Apprehension of Criminals.

The United States Attorneys’ Criminal Resources Manual (the “Manual”) is a set of
9
guidelines, policies, and protocols promulgated by the Department of Justice to guide United States
10
Attorneys and other Department of Justice employees in the exercise of their duties. Chapter 9-15
11
of the Manual, “International Extradition and Related Matters,” provides guidelines for the
12
apprehension of suspected criminals located outside of the United States. Formal extradition of
13
suspects is plainly Department of Justice’s preferred approach: Chapter 9-15 begins by noting that
14
extraterritorial apprehension “is subject to foreign policy considerations” and requires that
15
“prosecutors should consult OIA [the Office of International Affairs] for advice on any matter
16

relating to extradition before taking any action in such a case.” Manual § 9-15.100. 69 Section 9-

17
15.610 of the Manual, “Deportations, Expulsions, or other Extraordinary Renditions,” permits
18
Department of Justice employees to undertake abductions such as Mr. Seleznev’s but only after
19
advance approval from Department of Justice and the Office of International Affairs:
20
Due to the sensitivity of abducting defendants from a foreign country, prosecutors
may not take steps to secure custody over persons outside the United States (by
government agents or the use of private persons, like bounty hunters or private
investigators) by means of Alvarez-Machain type renditions without advance
approval by the Department of Justice. Prosecutors must notify the Office of
International Affairs before they undertake any such operation. If a prosecutor
anticipates the return of a defendant, with the cooperation of the sending State and

by a means other than an Alvarez-Machain type rendition, and that the defendant
may claim that his return was illegal, the prosecutor should consult with OIA before
such return. 70

1
2

To date, the United States has not produced any documentation showing that the Secret
3
Service or the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington made such a
4
request to either the Department of Justice or OIA. And though the United States initiated a request
5
for Mr. Seleznev to be expelled, it is clear that such a request was never granted.
6
For one, the United States has not produced any documents reflecting any form of expulsion,
7
warrant, or authorization to arrest made by the Maldivian government. Second, Agent Schwandner
8
testified that he took Mr. Seleznev into custody prior to him reaching the immigration desk at the
9
Malé airport, and that Mr. Seleznev’s passport was stamped in the “VIP area” after he had already
10

been handcuffed and had his property seized. 71 The immigration desk is the first point where

11
Maldivian authorities would have run Mr. Seleznev’s information and learned that he had been
12
flagged for expulsion. Indeed, Mr. Seleznev’s passport bears a normal exit stamp from the
13
Maldives. Based on the defense’s investigation, when an individual is expelled from the Maldives,
14
their passport is given a different stamp clearly indicating they have been expelled and may not
15
return.
16
Reason dictates that there was no need for the Maldives to “expel” Mr. Seleznev because
17
he was, in essence, literally attempting to effect his own expulsion by boarding his scheduled flight
18
back to Russia. The United States’ assertion that Mr. Seleznev was expelled by the Maldives prior
19
to his illegal arrest in the Malé is not supported by any evidence and is simply not credible. The
20
Secret Service should be held accountable for violating the Court’s arrest warrant rules, its own
21
statutory authority, and Department of Justice’s own standards in abducting Mr. Seleznev

The Secret Service Knowingly Violated the Law of the Maldives in
Abducting Mr. Seleznev.

2

The moment before he was arrested by the Secret Service, Mr. Seleznev was lawfully

3

present in the Maldives which had filed no criminal charges against him and which had not ordered

4

his arrest under Maldives law. Had he been arrested under Maldives law, Mr. Seleznev would have

5

been entitled to certain fundamental legal protections including the right to counsel, the right to

6

consular access, and the right to be brought before a Maldives court within 24 hours of his arrest to

7

determine the lawfulness of his detention. 72 Moreover, under Maldives law, given that Maldives is

8

not a party to any extradition treaty with the United States, if expelled following a judicial

9

proceeding, Seleznev would have been returned to his home jurisdiction of Russia and not to the

10

United States.

11

Mindful that Mr. Seleznev would have been entitled to these legal protections under

12

Maldives law and that his expulsion would result in his return to Russia (where he was headed

13

immediately prior to his arrest), the Secret Service agents took physical custody of Mr. Seleznev in

14

a deliberate circumvention of the legal protections afforded under the local law of the Maldives.

15

This makes the United States’ conduct in abducting Mr. Seleznev even more outrageous and

16

compels a finding that this prosecution cannot stand. See, e.g., Toscanino, 500 F.2d at 270 (noting

17

that host country “had indeed condemned this kind of apprehension as alien to its laws” in reaching

18

holding).

20

The Secret Service Knowingly Violated International Law in
Abducting Mr. Seleznev.

In addition to the foregoing violations of United States and Maldivian law, the Secret

Service violated international law when it contravened the terms of the purported Red Notice,
22
ignored its treaty obligations with Russia, and violated a United Nations covenant.

The United States Violated its Representations to Interpol in
Abducting Mr. Seleznev Without Obtaining his Extradition or
the Permission of the Maldivian Government.

The International Criminal Police Organization, a.k.a. Interpol, is an international non3
governmental organization that facilitates international police cooperation and coordination; there
4

are over 190 member nations of Interpol, including the Maldives, Russia, and the United States.73

5
Red Notices are described in the United States Attorneys’ Manual as “the closest instrument to an
6

international arrest warrant in use today.” 74 Further guidance, in the form of the prosecutor’s

7
Criminal Resources Manual, advises that when a person whose name is listed in an Interpol Notice
8
comes to the attention of the police abroad, the country that sought the listing is notified through
9
10

Interpol and can request provisional arrest and/or file a formal request for extradition. 75 Red Notices
are intended to be used for “extradition or similar lawful action.” 76

11
The Interpol Red Notice purportedly provided to Maldivian authorities in order to secure
12
their permission to arrest Mr. Seleznev in the Malé airport contains an affirmation, endorsed by the
13
United States in requesting that the Red Notice be issued, that “[t]he country at the request of which
14
the present notice has been published has given assurances that extradition will be sought upon
15
arrest of the person, in conformity with its national laws and/or the applicable bilateral and
16

multilateral treaties.” 77 This provision requires the United States to comply with its own laws, the

17
law of the Maldives, and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the United States and Russia.
18
It prohibits the type of illegal abduction Mr. Seleznev has suffered, and should compel the Court to
19
exercise its supervisory power and dismiss the prosecution against him.

The United States Violated its Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty
with Russia when it Abducted Mr. Seleznev from a Third-Party
Host Nation.

The United States and Russia are parties to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (the
3
“MLAT”), which is intended to “broaden and deepen American-Russian cooperation to prevent and
4
fight against crime” and “reaffirm[] their determination to enhance legal assistance in criminal
5

matters.” 78 The MLAT is a self-executing treaty 79 that enables the Attorney General to coordinate

regarding each country’s duties in responding to requests made pursuant to the treaty, requiring that

12
It is undisputed that the United States could have, but did not invoke the MLAT in an effort

to obtain custody of Mr. Seleznev lawfully in this case. Secret Service communications produced

by the United States indicate that the government believed it could do so under the terms of an
15

MLAT, 82 had already issued requests for information regarding Mr. Seleznev to Russia and the

confidentiality of their investigation. 83 Moreover, as noted above, the Russian Foreign Ministry

2

explicitly accused the United States of ignoring the MLAT and resorting to the forcible kidnapping

3

of a Russian citizen. 84 While the MLAT is not an extradition treaty per se, it is a formal agreement

4

that provides the United States a mechanism for cooperating with Russia in criminal prosecutions,

5

and it behooves the United States to make a good faith effort to act within its strictures – hence

6

Russia’s public outrage over Mr. Seleznev’s abduction. 85

7

Mr. Seleznev anticipates that the Government will argue that attempting to use the MLAT

8

to secure custody of Mr. Seleznev would have been futile and that the agents were therefore justified

9

in bypassing it. However, it is not the province of the Government to assume that acting lawfully

10

through a treaty would be futile and, therefore, other solutions outside of the law need to be

11

explored. The law does not allow a party to skip steps because the party assumes they will not work.

12

Even assuming that the extrajudicial means employed here were lawful – which they were not – the

13

United States still would have needed to exhaust the remedies available to it before claiming that

14

those remedies would be ineffective. As the Government has provided no indication that it

15

attempted to use the MLAT but was rebuffed, an argument that such action would have been futile

16

should be given little to no weight.

The United States Violated the United Nations International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights when it Abducted Mr.
Seleznev.

In addition to the foregoing violations of international agreements, the United States
3
violated international law when it abducted Mr. Seleznev. The United Nations International
4
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the “ICCPR”) is a widely-accepted international accord
5
that requires signatory countries to observe basic civil political rights of individuals regardless of
6
their citizenship. The ICCPR was ratified by the United States Senate in 1999, see 138 Cong. Rec.
7
S4781-01 (April 2, 1992), and both Russia and the Maldives have also ratified the covenant. While
8
the ICCPR is not “self-executing” in that it does not provide individuals of member nations with a
9
private cause of action for violation of its terms, see, e.g., Serra v. Lappin, 600 F.3d 1191, 1196-97
10
(9th Cir. 2010), the nations that have signed and ratified it do have an obligation to observe its
11
terms.
12
The United States’ action in abducting Mr. Selezenev directly contravenes several
13
provisions in the ICCPR. For one, Article 9 of the ICCPR provides that signatory nations may only
14
deprive someone of their liberty “in accordance with such procedure as are established by law,”
15
and requires that anyone who is deprived of their liberty “shall be entitled to take proceedings before
16
a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and
17

order his release if the detention is not lawful.” ICCPR Art. 9 Cl. 1, 4. 86 The Secret Service violated

18
this provision when it arrested Mr. Seleznev without authority under either United States law or the
19
law of the Maldives, then immediately secreted him out of the country for the purpose of avoiding
20
judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention. Article 13 of the ICCPR goes one step further
21
and provides that aliens who are lawfully in another country may not be expelled without having
22
their case reviewed unless their presence implicates national security issues:
23

ICCPR, including Articles 9 and 13 cited herein (attached as Exhibit 23).

expelled therefrom only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law
and shall, except where compelling reasons of national security otherwise require,
be allowed to submit the reasons against his expulsion and to have his case
reviewed by, and be represented for the purpose before, the competent authority or
a person or persons especially designated by the competent authority.” 87

4

Here, it is clear that the United States violated Article 13 of the ICCPR by proceeding with Mr.

5

Seleznev’s abduction in the absence of a valid order of expulsion from the Maldives government.

6

The only remedy for these flagrant violations of international law is dismissal.

Mr. Seleznev’s Illegal Abduction Weakens the United States’ Image on the
Global Stage and Sets a Bad Precedent for Protecting United States Citizens
in the Future.

9

As important as the actual legal issues surrounding the treatment of Mr. Seleznev are the

10
11

D.

perhaps unanticipated geopolitical ramifications it is likely to bring to bear. There can be no
denying that in recent years the United States’ global image has suffered substantially, and we

12
13
14

have a difficult road ahead of us in the eyes of many to get back to the position where we belong as
the world’s foremost bastion of liberty and freedom. Kidnapping foreign citizens abroad and

15

violating the territorial interests of other countries sets our country farther back on that road. As

16

noted above, the arrest of Mr. Seleznev was an international incident sparking public outcry

17

against the United States in Russia, the Maldives, and elsewhere.

18

Mr. Seleznev’s abduction sets a terrible precedent that will put United States citizens

19
traveling or residing in other countries at greater risk. The Government obviously believes that the
20
21

charges against Mr. Seleznev are sound, and it will no doubt claim that it would only undertake

22

this type of extraordinary action in a case in which it was sure of the defendant’s guilt. Other

23

nations, however, may have different opinions about what should be illegal, or may set lower

thresholds than those purportedly followed by the United States. If a foreign government were to

2

apprehend a United States citizen forcibly in a foreign country without permission or based simply

3

on acquiescence from that nation’s authorities, there would certainly be public outcry in this

4

country, particularly if the arrest was based on questionable evidence or actions that most

5

Americans think should not be illegal. But allowing Mr. Seleznev’s arrest to stand would give

6

other nations an example to point to in order to justify such conduct and would leave the United

7
States on morally shaky ground in challenging such conduct. If this Court allows this indictment to
8
9

stand, what is to stop an intelligence agency from Syria, Iran, or another country with whom the

10

United States does not always see eye-to-eye, from abducting a United States citizen in the

11

Maldives and charging him with blasphemy or some other charge that the United States may or

12

may not find dubious?

13
14

America is a nation in which we respect the rule of law and respect the rights of all
individuals even if they are not citizens or even if they are accused of the most heinous of conduct.

15
16
17

Our criminal justice system is not based on the notion of “the ends justify the means” and, while its
name contains the word “secret,” the Secret Service is not meant to be a secret police force. There

18

can be no question here that United States government agents used dubious means to apprehend

19

Mr. Seleznev, actions more in line with those of a secret police force than an arm of the United

20

States Government. Allowing this arrest to stand would only take this country further down that

21

road. As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, one of the legitimate reasons why a court can exercise

22
its supervisory powers to order dismissal of a prosecution is to “deter future illegal conduct.”

It is not only proper but necessary for a court to step in and stop such activity so that such conduct

to other countries and individuals. Other courts may have been reluctant to do so but this Court is

VI.

CONCLUSION

As set forth above, the United States knowingly and directly violated three separate bodies
of substantive law when it abducted Mr. Seleznev from the Malé airport and brought him to the

15
16
17

United States. As the Ninth Circuit has clearly stated, an extraterritorial arrest may be found to be
so shocking and outrageous that it violates due process principles – even in the absence of physical

18

abuse – if the United States flagrantly disregards the sovereignty of the host nation. The United

19

States’ decision to go through with Mr. Seleznev’s abduction even after the apparent denial of its

20

request for expulsion; the fact that the abduction was carried out solely by United States agents;

21

and the fact that those agents were acting in knowing violation of United States law, Maldivian

22
law, and international treaties and covenants all set this case apart from early cases rejecting
23
24

challenges to extraterritorial abductions based on a narrower reading of Toscanino. The Court

For these reasons and those set forth above, Mr. Seleznev respectfully asks the Court to:

1.

Decline to exercise jurisdiction over this matter and thereby terminate the
prosecution;

2.

Dismiss the pending Indictments;
