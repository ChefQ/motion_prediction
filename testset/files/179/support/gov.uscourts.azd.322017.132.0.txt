THE COURT’S MARCH 10,
2009 ORDER

The Honorable David G. Campbell

Introduction

23
24

Plaintiffs Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (“Blizzard”)

25

hereby respectfully request this Court to enter an order compelling Defendants MDY

26

Industries, LLC (“MDY”) and Michael Donnelly (“Donnelly”) to deposit certain funds

27

presently located in various accounts belonging to MDY and Donnelly into escrow

28

pursuant to this Court's March 10, 2009 order (the “Order”). Dkt. No. 116.

Background
After granting summary judgment in Blizzard's favor, this Court entered a
$6,000,000 million stipulated damages judgment on September 29, 2008 for Counts I, II,

4
5

and III of Blizzard's counterclaims and third-party complaint. Dkt. No. 95. Following

6

trial on the remaining claims, this Court entered an order in Blizzard's favor on two of its

7

DMCA claims, and requested briefing as to entry of a permanent injunction, possible stay

8

of that injunction, and what bond should be imposed to protect Blizzard's rights pending

9

appeal. Dkt. No. 108 at 22. Following that order, on March 3, 2009, the parties agreed to

10
11
12
13
14
15

an increased $6,500,000 million judgment to reflect damages incurred since September
29, 2008. Dkt. 114.
On March 10, 2009, this Court entered an Order addressing, among other issues,
the proper security MDY and Donnelly should post to stay execution of the judgment
pending appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d). The Court ordered that in

16
17

lieu of a full bond for the $6.5 million judgment MDY and Michael Donnelly “place all

18

present and future profits obtained from the sale of Glider or other operations of MDY,

19

including all monies set aside by MDY and Donnelly from the commencement of this

20

suit, in an escrow account approved by Blizzard” and to “report its monthly income and

21

expenses to Blizzard during the pendency of the appeal.” Dkt. No. 116 at 9, 10. In the

22
23

order, the Court stated that, “Donnelly also testified at trial that while he has not set aside

24

a separate reserve to satisfy the monetary judgment, he has not spent any profits from the

25

sale of Glider since this litigation began.” Id. at 8. The Court also retained jurisdiction to

26

resolve any disputes related to enforcement of the order. Id. at 10.

Pursuant to the Order, Blizzard's counsel sent a financial disclosure form to
counsel for MDY and Donnelly on March 24, 2009. (Ex. A, Ltr. fr. S. McGee to P.
Rupprecht & L. Venable dated 3/24/2009). MDY and Donnelly responded with

4
5

completed financial disclosure forms on April 2, 2009. (Ex. B, Ltr. fr. P. Rupprecht to S.

6

McGee dated April 2, 2009). In that response, Donnelly disclosed a personal investment

7

account that he stated was funded with special distributions paid to him by MDY. Id. In

8

addition, Donnelly disclosed the following personal accounts that were funded with his

9

salary from MDY, which he acknowledged was paid solely from revenues generated by

10
11
12

Glider sales (Id. & Ex. C, Letter from Philip Rupprecht to S. McGee dated April 21,
2009):1

13

• A checking account at DSFCU;

14

• A savings account at DSFCU;

15

• A money market account at DSFCU; and

16

• An E*trade investment account.2

17
18

MDY revealed that it has:

19

• Three checking accounts at Chase Bank with balances of $24,653.63;

20

$65,796.17, and $2,489.00;
21

• Two savings accounts with balances of $100.20 and $3,822.15; and

22
23
24
25
26
27
28

1

Donnelly also disclosed one additional personal savings account, and an
automobile titled in his name for which he paid cash. During subsequent
negotiations, MDY’s counsel noted that the car was paid for with salary received
from MDY, but that the savings account was funded with proceeds from the sale of
real property purchased prior to the creation of MDY. (See Ex. C).
2

Donnelly claims that he funded approximately half of the balance of this account
before beginning work at MDY, and the remaining half with salary from MDY. (Ex.
C).
-3-

1
2

• A PayPal account with $ 2,015.58.
Id. To date, MDY and Donnelly have placed only the proceeds of Donnelly’s personal

3

investment account into escrow.
4
5

Blizzard believes that MDY and Donnelly have construed the Court’s March 10,

6

2009 Order too narrowly and that the funds in certain MDY and Donnelly accounts, as

7

well as the title for the car Donnelly purchased with funds generated by Glider sales,

8

should be escrowed. The parties have attempted to resolve their differences without

9

success, and thus Blizzard requests that the Court issue an Order clarifying whether the
10
11

funds described herein should be escrowed under the Court’s March 10, 2009 Order.

12

Argument

13

In the course of the parties’ negotiations, MDY and Donnelly have taken the

14

position that only the funds in Donnelly’s personal investment account should be

15

escrowed, arguing that "the Order makes reference in several places to Mr. Donnelly's
16
17

testimony about profits being set aside during the pendency of the case. In that

18

testimony, Mr. Donnelly was referring to an investment account which he still has and

19

over which there is no dispute. Therefore, our view is that the Order requires Mr.

20

Donnelly to transfer the investment account only to the designated escrow agent.” (Ex.

21

D, Letter from P. Rupprecht to S. McGee dated March 27, 2009). MDY and Donnelly
22
23

contend that the funds in the additional MDY and Donnelly accounts are not profits from

24

the Glider business, claiming that “profits” are only “extraordinary distributions in the

25

past” paid to Donnelly, and that all funds from such distributions were put in Donnelly’s

26

investment account. (Ex. E, April 29, 2009 Email from P. Rupprecht to S. McGee). As

27

to its accounts, MDY claims that because the Court's order contemplates future
28
-4-

1

operations, it must have “some level of cash reserves” and thus Blizzard is not entitled to

2

monies deposited into the MDY accounts that have not yet been distributed.3 (Ex. D).

3

As to Donnelly’s other personal accounts (and car title), Donnelly asserts that accounts

4
5

funded from “salary” paid to him by MDY should not be subject to escrow because those

6

funds also do not constitute “profits” of MDY. (Ex. E). Blizzard respectfully submits

7

that MDY’s arguments should be rejected as contrary to this Court’s order because they

8

place form over substance and provide MDY and Donnelly with complete control over

9

whether funds derived from the sale of Glider -- the unlawful activity enjoined by this

10
11

Court -- constitute “profit” and thus are subject to escrow. The Order requires MDY and

12

Donnelly to secure Blizzard’s interest in its judgments against them in order to stay

13

execution of the judgment, and MDY and Donnelly’s interpretation of the Court’s Order,

14

if correct, would subvert that interest.

15

MDY’s narrow construction of the meaning of “profits” is inconsistent with this

16
17

Court’s order and creates the potential for manipulation. Profit is the “excess of the

18

selling price of goods over their cost.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 992

19

(11th ed. 2007). Money is profit unless it is being used to pay a cost of Glider sales—in

20

other words, an expense that has been accrued (such as rent through the end of its lease).

21

If the money cannot be allocated to an expense, or cost, then it is profit. Instead of

22
23
24

accepting the ordinary definition of “profit,” MDY has taken a position that, if accepted,
would place the determination of whether money is “profit” solely within its control.

25
26
27
28

3

MDY’s request for a stay of this Court’s injunction pending was denied by the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on April 21, 2009. (Ex. F, Order dated April 21,
2009). Accordingly, by MDY’s own admission, all MDY operations have been shut
down as it is enjoined from selling its only product. (Ex. G, Donnelly forum
posting).
-5-

1
2
3

First, Donnelly’s attempt to distinguish funds based on the account into which he
elected to deposit them is untenable. Accepting MDY and Donnelly’s argument that only
funds that Donnelly chose to place in his investment account are “profits” would allow

4
5

MDY and Donnelly to control whether money constitutes “profit” simply by choosing

6

not to deposit it into that financial account. This Court, however, did not limit the money

7

MDY must deposit into escrow to a specific account Donnelly controls. Instead, the

8

order focuses on the source of funds by requiring deposit of “all profits obtained from the

9

sale of Glider or other operations of MDY, including all monies set aside by MDY and

10
11

Donnelly since commencement of this suit...” Dkt. No. 116 at 9 (emphasis added). In

12

fact, this Court's order recognizes that no specific account contains the monies at issue:

13

“Donnelly also testified at trial that while he has not set aside a separate reserve to

14

satisfy the monetary judgment he has not spent any profits from the sale of Glider since

15

this litigation began.” Dkt. No. 116 at 8. Thus, if the funds are profits of MDY’s

16
17

business, MDY and Donnelly must deposit them into escrow regardless of the account in

18

which they currently reside, unless they are being used to pay a current operating

19

expense.

20
21

Second, this Court should reject MDY and Donnelly’s argument that profits are
only those amounts paid to Mr. Donnelly as irregular or “extraordinary” distributions,

22
23

rather than salary, because it too would allow MDY and Donnelly to exercise control

24

over whether money constitutes profit simply by whether they paid, or pay, Donnelly a

25

“salary” rather than having paid, or paying, the same money as a “distribution.”

26

Donnelly is the sole individual partner of MDY, and has identified his salary from MDY

27

as the source of the money in the checking, savings, money market and E*trade accounts

28
-6-

1

described above. He claims that this money is “salary” rather than “profit,” but cannot

2

escape the fact that if MDY did not pay its controlling partner a salary, then that same

3

amount would have been distributed to Donnelly (or retained by MDY) as profit.

4
5

Accordingly, there is no practical difference for purposes of this Court’s order between

6

money MDY paid to Donnelly as a “salary” and money paid to Donnelly as a

7

“distribution.” Accepting Donnelly’s interpretation of this Court’s order would place the

8

determination of whether money is profit solely in MDY and Donnelly’s hands by

9

allowing them to convert “profits” into “operating expenses” merely by declining to

10
11

distribute those profits to Donnelly or by choosing to pay those profits to Donnelly as a

12

“salary.” Donnelly’s ability to pick and choose which of his funds must secure

13

Blizzard’s judgment pending appeal is particularly inappropriate given the fact that

14

Blizzard has obtained a $6.5 million judgment against Donnelly personally. As a result,

15

all Glider revenues Donnelly identified as being paid to him by MDY—via salary or a

16
17
18
19
20
21

distribution—are profit and should be placed in escrow, as should the title to the
automobile Donnelly purchased with money he was paid by MDY.
Likewise, accepting MDY’s representations that the funds in its operating
accounts do not constitute profit would render this Court’s order nearly meaningless with
regard to MDY’s accounts, as MDY could prevent money from becoming profit simply

22
23

by retaining it in its operating account and not distributing it to Donnelly (except via

24

“salary”)—a choice entirely within its (and Donnelly’s) control. Blizzard agrees that

25

under the ordinary definition of “profit” MDY may retain some cash in order to pay

26

expenses MDY had accrued as of the date of the Order, provided it submits

27

documentation supporting those expenses. At this stage, however, those expenses should

28
-7-

1

be limited. The Ninth Circuit has denied MDY’s request to stay the permanent injunction

2

pending appeal. (Ex. F). MDY has stated publicly that it would be shutting down

3

following the ruling. (Ex G). Nonetheless, MDY claims that it must retain over $90,000

4
5

in its operating accounts to pay expenses. It is unclear what justification MDY has for

6

retaining any amount given that MDY will soon cease to exist. As such, the full amount

7

contained in MDY’s operating accounts should be placed into escrow.

8
9

Even prior to the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, however, much of MDY’s disclosed
expenses of $39,690 per month appeared to be discretionary and not currently accrued.

10
11

For instance, the largest amount of monthly expenses was $29,350.00 in salaries. Ex. B.

12

A large portion of that salary amount ($12,800) is Donnelly’s own $153,600 annual

13

salary, which for the reasons stated above should be treated as profit for purposes of this

14

Court’s order. Id. Donnelly’s salary aside, MDY has no product line other than Glider,

15

which it cannot, under this Court’s order, continue to sell. MDY thus has no need to

16
17
18
19
20
21

spend money on employees to maintain a product it is unable to sell. Indeed, MDY has
acknowledged publicly that it is for all intents and purposes defunct.
Blizzard is mindful of the consequences of terminating employees and winding
down businesses in the current economic climate, but this Court should not allow MDY
to subvert this Court’s order by distributing Glider profits that this Court has ordered

22
23

placed into escrow to protect Blizzard’s rights. If MDY wishes to continue to fund

24

salaries and other expenses, it may do so by obtaining financing or capital from sources

25

other than the sale of Glider—such as bank financing or venture capital funds—but as the

26

Court's order makes clear it cannot do so by re-appropriating profits.

27
28

1

CONCLUSION

2

For the foregoing reasons, Blizzard respectfully requests that this Court order

3

MDY to make an accounting of unpaid, but presently owed expenses, and deposit into

4
5

escrow the balance of the MDY accounts at Chase Bank and PayPal after subtracting

6

those expenses. Likewise, Blizzard respectfully requests that the Court order Michael

7

Donnelly to deposit the balance of his DSFCU checking, savings, money market accounts

8

and half of his E*trade financial account into escrow, and to place the title to his

9

automobile in escrow. In the alternative, Blizzard asks this Court to provide it with a writ

10
11

of execution under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 70 so that it may compel Chase,

12

Paypal, DSFCU and E*trade Bank to transfer those funds in to escrow.
