PLAINTIFF'S OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS

20
Defendant Check Recovery Systems has filed its Motion to (1) Dismiss for Lack
21
of Jurisdiction; (2) Transfer Case to Pending Bankruptcy Court Adversary Proceeding; and (3)
22
Stay All Proceedings Pending Resolution of Bankruptcy Court Adversary Proceeding.
23
Defendant’s Motion is baseless. This Court has jurisdiction of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
24
Act (“FDCPA”) claim of Plaintiff Brandy Hunt pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1692k(d). The Adversary
25
Proceeding filed by Defendant has been decided by the Bankruptcy Court in favor of Brandy
26
Hunt.

ARGUMENT
A.

THIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION
OVER PLAINTIFF’S FDCPA CLAIMS.

3
On December 5, 2005, Brandy Hunt filed the Class Action Complaint alleging
4
Defendant Check Recovery System violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C.
5
§§1692 et seq. (“FDCPA”), by adding interest to the amount it sought to collect. “[T]he
6
Legislature has created a mandatory recovery scheme that does not provide for additional
7
collection of interest.” Palmer v. Stassinos, 348 F.Supp.2d 1070, 1083 (N.D.Cal. 2005).
8
Jurisdiction over this FDCPA claim resides with this Court pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1692k(d).
9
Defendant argues:
10
11
12

This Court has no jurisdiction to hear this case because resolution of this
case will require this Court to determine the balance due on the underlying debt.
The determination of the balance due on the underlying debt will necessarily be
determined in the pending Adversarial matter by the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Northern District of California.

13
Defendant’s Memorandum, page 3. Defendant is wrong.
14
As the Ninth Circuit has stated: “a debtor has standing to complain of violations
15
of the Act, regardless of whether a valid debt exists.” Baker v. G. C. Services Corp., 677 F.2d
16

775. 777 (9th Cir. 1982). Thus, the determination of the “balance due on the underlying debt” as

17
Defendant suggests has no bearing on Plaintiff’s FDCPA claim.
18
Furthermore, Defendant’s Adversary Proceeding has been adjudicated in favor of
19
Brandy Hunt.

DEFENDANT’S BANKRUPTCY COURT LAWSUIT WAS
FRIVOLOUS AND DISMISSED BY THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE
On September 29, 2005, Ms. Hunt filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of

23

the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of

24

California, Case No. 05-33473. In Schedule B of her voluntary petition,1 she listed a possible

Case 4:05-cv-04993-SBA

1

claim against Check Recovery Systems, Inc. for violation of the FDCPA, statutory damages for

2

which she valued at $1,000.00. The claim was listed as exempt at Schedule C. Creditors are

3

allowed 30 days from the meeting of creditors to object to an exemption. Fed. R. Bankr. P

4

4003(b). After 30 days have elapsed, all objections, if any, are waived and if none have been

5

timely brought, the claim of exemption is allowed. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U.S. 638,

6

639 (U.S. 1992). Once the debtor's exemption is allowed, the exempt property is no longer

7

property of the estate. In re Reed, 940 F.2d 1317, 1321 (9th Cir. 1991).

8
9

On November 9, 2005, the bankruptcy trustee, in her report, concluded that "there are no
assets to administer for the benefit of creditors."

10

Since there was no objection to the exemption claim against Defendant for its violation of

11

the FDCPA, and since the trustee's report showed no assets to administer, Plaintiff filed her class

12

action complaint in this court on December 5, 2005. Defendant filed a complaint 11 days later

13

in the bankruptcy court, seeking to bar the discharge of a dishonored check for $137.11 issued by

14

Ms. Hunt, along with a motion to bar her complete discharge (Exhibit I to Defendant's motion).

15

Plaintiff responded to that action with a 12(b)(6) motion which the bankruptcy court judge

16

treated as a motion for summary judgment in Ms. Hunt's favor. The judge described Defendant's

17

Complaint as borderline frivolous. The filing fee of $200.00 to bring a lawsuit to recover a

18

$137.11 check demonstrated a lack of merit in filing the Complaint. Likewise, more than a

19

dishonored check is required to prove a fraud claim in the bankruptcy court. In re Trevisan, 300

20

B.R. 708 (Bankr. E. D. Wis. 2003)(internal quotations omitted).

21

Nonetheless, Defendant, being defeated in the bankruptcy court, persists in seeking to

22

dislodge this consumer action brought to recover damages for Defendant's unlawful conduct in

23

gouging consumers by imposing unlawful charges on consumers who seek to redeem their

24

checks.

25

The Defendant's argue that Plaintiff is not the proper party to bring this action, and it

26

should be brought by the bankruptcy trustee. Defendant is wrong. Rule 17(a), as relevant here,

27

provides:

No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a
reasonable time has been allowed after objection for
ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or
substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification,
joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the
action had been commenced in the name of the real party in
interest.

CONCLUSION

Defendant’s Motion must be denied as this Court has jurisdiction of Plaintiff’s
8
FDCPA claims.
