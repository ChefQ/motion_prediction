The reason for this request is that the basis of pending

Act is that Defendant IMPERIAL MERCHANT SERVICE, a California

15

corporation, doing business as CHECK RECOVERY SYSTEMS, incorrectly

16

sued herein as CHECK RECOVERY SYSTEMS, INC. sent Plaintiff a

17

collection notice for a returned check that included a charge of

18

$35.00 for a returned check under the authority of California Civil

19

Code Section 1714 and a charge for interest on a common count for

goods, wares, and merchandise. In this lawsuit, Plaintiff claims

proceedings under 28 U.S.C. 157(b)(2)(I). Therefore, this Court no

3

longer has jurisdiction to determine whether interest can be

4

imposed on this debt. If this Court does not have jurisdiction to

5

determine whether interest can be imposed on this debt, this Court

6

does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the pending Complaint for

violation of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

This Court has no jurisdiction to hear this case because
resolution of this case will require this Court to determine the
balance due on the underlying debt. The determination of the

5

balance due on the underlying debt will necessarily be determined

6

in the pending Adversarial matter by the United States Bankruptcy

7

Court for the Northern District of California. Therefore, this

8

Court must either:

9

(1) Dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction;
