V
CONCLUSION

2
This Court has no jurisdiction to hear this case because
3
resolution of this case will require this Court to determine the
4
balance due on the underlying debt. The determination of the
5
balance due on the underlying debt will necessarily be determined
6
in the pending Adversarial matter by the United States Bankruptcy
7
Court for the Northern District of California. Therefore, this
8
Court must either:
9
(1) Dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction;
10
(2) Transfer this case to the United States Bankruptcy Court
11
for the Northern District of California to be heard in Adversary
12
Case

authority of 28 United States Code 157 ad General Order No. 24 of

the United States District Court for the Northern District of
15
California;
16
(3) Enter an order staying all proceedings in this case until
17
there is a final resolution of Adversary Case Number 05-3499 now
18
pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
19
District of California.
