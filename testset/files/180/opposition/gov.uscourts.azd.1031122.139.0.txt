vs.
Thomas Mario Costanzo,

CR-17-00585-PHX-GMS
GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO
MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE
EXPANSION AT TRIAL OF
REGULATORY BASES

Defendant.

19
20

The Government does not intend to expand the regulatory bases beyond those cited

21

in its Response to the Motion for Bill of Particulars. (Doc. 117.) Thus, the Government

22

has no objection to the Court granting the pending motion in limine regarding expansion

23

at trial of regulatory bases. (Doc. 133.)

24

I.

Introduction and background.

25

The five money laundering counts set for trial in this case are money laundering

26

sting charges which allege, conjunctively, that Costanzo engaged in a financial transaction

27

for two purposes: to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership and

28

control of the undercover agents’ drug money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(3)(B);

Case 2:17-cr-00585-GMS Document 139 Filed 03/06/18 Page 2 of 4

1

and with the intent to avoid a transaction reporting requirement that any financial institution

2

would have been obligated to undertake, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(3)(C). The

3

pending motion in limine (Doc. 133) deals only with the second way Costanzo is alleged

4

to have laundered the money at issue here. Specifically, Subsection C states that it is money

5

laundering when a person intending “to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under

6

State or Federal law” conducts or attempts to conduct a financial transaction involving

7

property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, or property used to

8

conduct or facilitate specified unlawful activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(3)(C). “To prove

9

a violation of this section, the Government must prove (1) that the defendant conducted or

10

attempted to conduct a financial transaction, (2) with the intent to avoid a transaction

11

reporting requirement, and (3) that the property involved in the transaction was represented

12

by a law enforcement officer to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.” United

13

States v. Nelson, 66 F.3d 1036 1040 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Breque, 964

14

F.2d 381, 386-87 (5th Cir. 1992)). That means, in order to find Costanzo guilty at trial, the

15

jury does not have to find a violation of a specific regulation—it simply has to find that

16

Costanzo attempted to work around those regulatory concepts.

The evidence will show that Costanzo intended to help the undercover agents
avoid the regulatory reporting requirements mentioned in the response to the
motion for bill of particulars.
There is ample evidence that Costanzo intended to help the undercover agents work

around the regulatory concepts mentioned in the response to the motion for bill of
particulars. The Government need not mention additional regulatory bases. At trial, the
Government intends to present general evidence about Currency Transaction Reporting
(CTR) requirements, Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) requirements, and Know Your
Customer (KYC) requirements. The government will then introduce recorded statements
made by Costanzo showing that he intended to help the undercover agents avoid those
requirements. For example, when Costanzo told an undercover agent that “radar goes off,
the bells go off” if the undercover agent were to deposit more than $10,000. (Meeting on

March 20, 2015.) Or when Costanzo tells another undercover agent that “dealing with

2

[him] is one way” to keep what he is doing from being discovered because “[Costanzo]

3

do[es]n’t say anything to anybody,” along with “that’s why you are paying me.” (Meeting

4

on October 7, 2015.) The government also plans to introduce Costanzo’s own statements

5

about reporting requirements, for example, when he tells the third undercover agent that

6

“if you take out more than $3,000, they fill out what’s called [a] SAR” and then goes on to

7

explain that SAR stands for “Suspicious Activity Report.” (Meeting on November 16,

8

2016.) During that same meeting, he tells the third undercover agent, “I don’t even wanna

9

know people’s real name.” (Meeting on November 16, 2016.) The statements above, along

10

with others, will be introduced at trial to show that Costanzo intended to help the

11

undercover agents avoid the regulatory concepts mentioned in the response to the bill of

12

particulars. The Government will not present regulations other than those that have already

13

been noticed. See Doc. 117.

14

III.

Conclusion.

15

The Government will not expand the regulatory bases beyond those mentioned in

16

the Response to the Bill of Particulars. (Doc. 117.) The Court should, accordingly, grant

17

the motion in limine. (Doc. 133.)

18

Respectfully submitted this 6th day of March, 2018.
