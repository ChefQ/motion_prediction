MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE EXPANSION AT TRIAL OF THE
REGULATORY BASES ASSERTED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS
RESPONSE TO THE DEFENSE MOTION FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS
Thomas Mario Costanzo respectfully moves this Court for an order prohibiting
the government from expanding the regulatory bases upon which it has represented it will
seek conviction for the remaining counts of the present indictment (Counts 3-7). To wit:
 31 C.F.R. § 1010.310, Reports of transactions in currency;
 31 C.F.R. § 1010.311, Filing obligations for reports of transactions in currency;
 31 C.F.R. § 1010.312, Identification required;
 31 C.F.R. § 1010.320, Reports of suspicious transactions;
 31 C.F.R. § 1010. 410, Records to be made and retained by financial institutions;
 31 C.F.R § 1020, Rules for Banks;
 31 C.F.R. § 1020.220, Customer identification requirements for banks, savings
associations, credit unions, and certain non-Federally regulated banks;
 31 C.F.R. § 1021, Rules for Casinos and Card Clubs.
See Dkt. 117 at page 2, lines 12-19.
As grounds in support of this request, Mr. Costanzo states:
1. The purpose of a bill of particulars is threefold: A) to aid the defense in preparing for
trial, B) to eliminate surprise at trial, and C) to protect against double jeopardy. United
States v. Burt, 765 F.2d 1364, 1367 (9th Cir. 1985).
2. In trial preparations since February 1, 2018, when Dkt. 117 was filed, the defense has
relied on the government representations made therein.
3. In Dkt. 117, the government asserts that it intends to rely on some 44 federal
regulations: the six set forth in 31 C.F.R. §§ 1010.310-312, 320, 410, and 1020.220;
and §§ 1020 and 1021, which together contain approximately 39 regulations.
4. In the grand jury transcript and legal colloquy relevant to the remaining charges in the
present indictment, there is scant reference to federal transaction reporting
requirements.

5. It is the position of the defense that expansion of the regulatory bases asserted by the
government in Dkt. 117 will constitute a fatal variance or constructive amendment of
the indictment, considering the testimony offered by S.A. Ellsworth and legal
colloquy, both previously disclosed by the government in this case. See, e.g., United
States v. Ward, 747 F.3d 1184, 1189-93 (9th Cir. 2014)
a. A variance involves a divergence between the allegations set forth in the
indictment and the proof offered at trial. Where this divergence acts to
prejudice the defendant's rights, the conviction must be reversed. Id., see also
United States v. Tsinhnahijinnie, 112 F.3d 988, 989 (9th Cir.1997).
b. A constructive amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment
are altered, either literally or in effect, by the prosecutor or a court after the
grand jury has last passed upon them. Id.; see also Stirone v. United States, 361
U.S. 212 at 586 (1960) (quoting Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 10 (1887)
(overruled on other grounds) “If it lies within the province of a court to change
the charging part of an indictment to suit its own notions of what it ought to
have been, or what the grand jury would probably have made it if their attention
had been called to suggested changes, the great importance which the common
law attaches to an indictment by a grand jury, as a prerequisite to a prisoner's
trial for a crime, and without which the constitution says ‘no person shall be
held to answer,’ may be frittered away until its value is almost destroyed.”).
6. Given the surfeit of federal regulations regarding financial reporting requirements
notice of the specific regulations the government alleges Mr. Costanzo intended to
evade is necessary to assure both Mr. Costanzo’s Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial
and his Sixth Amendment right to effective representation of defense counsel. Should
the government be permitted to enlarge upon the representation made, it is the position
of the defense that Mr. Costanzo’s rights will have been substantially prejudiced and
constitute reversible error.
