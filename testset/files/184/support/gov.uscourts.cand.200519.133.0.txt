NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION

2

TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD HEREIN:

3

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on June 25, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. (in connection with the

4

claim construction hearing scheduled in this matter), or as soon thereafter as may be heard, in the

5

courtroom of the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte, Defendant SenoRx, Inc. (“SenoRx”) will and

6

hereby does move for partial summary judgment that claims 1 and 8 of U.S. Patent No.

7

6,482,142 (the “’142 patent”) are invalid for failure to comply with the provisions of 35 U.S.C.

8

§§ 101 and 112.

9

SenoRx requests the Court hold claims 1 and 8 of the ’142 invalid on the grounds that, as

10

a matter of law, they are inoperable and not enabled since the radiation source recited in claim 1

11

cannot simultaneously be “within” the claimed outer surface and “spaced apart” from the

12

claimed volume defined by that surface. As claim 8 depends from claim 1, it incorporates all of

13

claim 1’s limitations (and flaws as to operability and enablement) as a matter of law.

14

SenoRx brings the present motion for summary judgment because SenoRx believes that

15

by resolving this pure legal issue (as a matter of claim construction), the Court can dispose of all

16

issues regarding these claims. This motion is made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Civil Local

17

Rule 56-1, and Judge Whyte’s Standing Orders. SenoRx bases its motion upon this Notice of

18

Motion and Motion; the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities In Support

19

Thereof; and the Declaration of Adam Harber In Support of SenoRx’s Motion For Partial

20

Summary Judgment of Invalidity.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
This Court is familiar with the claims and prosecution history of the ’142 patent, having

3

addressed them in its order denying Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. See Order

4

Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“PI Order”) at 13-19. In the preliminary

5

injunction proceedings, as here, SenoRx argued that claim 1 of the ’142 patent is invalid because

6

claim 1 requires an impossible configuration. In its PI Order, this Court stated that SenoRx’s

7

argument “does raise some significant question regarding whether the claim drafter made a

8

mistake that may be fatal to the claim,” id. at 16, and found “it to be a very close call as to

9

whether SenoRx has made a substantial showing that the claim is vulnerable to an assertion of

10

invalidity,” but declined to decide invalidity on the record before it. Id.; see also id. at 21

11

(“There remains a question whether claim 1 of the ’142 patent is invalid as indefinite, given the

12

ambiguity regarding the ‘volume’ versus ‘surface’ distinction set forth above with regard to the

13

limitation requiring the radiation source to be ‘located so as to be spaced apart from the

14

apparatus volume’ defined by the outer surface.”) The answers to the questions raised by the

15

Court in its PI Order, as discussed below, mandate a finding that claim 1, and claim 8 that

16

depends from claim 1, are invalid.

17

SenoRx has submitted its Markman brief relating to the construction of the critical

18

“apparatus volume” limitation of claim 1 simultaneously with this brief, and will not readdress

19

claim construction here. As the undisputed record plainly demonstrates, claim 1 is inoperable

20

and not enabled under the proper claim construction of “apparatus volume.” Therefore, this

21

Court should enter summary judgment of invalidity of claim 1 and dependent claim 8.

ARGUMENT

7

A.

8

Operability and enablement are “closely related” questions. In re Swartz, 232 F.3d 862,

9

A Claim Must Be Operable and Enabled To Be Valid.

863 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101 mandates that any patentable

10

invention be useful and, accordingly, the subject matter of the claim must be operable. See

11

Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 977 F.2d 1555, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Utility

12

is a question of fact. In re Cortright, 165 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The enablement

13

requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1 requires that the specification adequately discloses to one

14

skilled in the relevant art how to make the claimed invention without undue experimentation.

15

See Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk, A/S, 108 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Lack of

16

enablement is a question of law, based on underlying factual inquiries. See Nat'l Recovery

17

Techs., Inc. v. Magnetic Separation Sys., Inc., 166 F.3d 1190, 1194 (Fed. Cir. 1999). “If a patent

18

claim fails to meet the utility requirement because it is not useful or operative, then it also fails to

19

meet the how-to-use aspect of the enablement requirement.” Process Control Corp. v.

an expandable outer surface defining a three-dimensional apparatus
volume configured to fill an interstitial void created by the surgical
extraction of diseased tissue and define an inner boundary of the
target tissue being treated;

2
3

6

a radiation source disposed completely within the expandable outer
surface and located so as to be spaced apart from the apparatus
volume, the radiation source further being asymmetrically located
and arranged within the expandable surface to provide
predetermined asymmetric isodose curves with respect to the
apparatus volume.1

7

See Ex. 1 (’142 patent), Claim 1 (emphases added).2 The claim thus first introduces a number of

8

components of the claimed apparatus (the expandable outer surface, the three-dimensional

9

apparatus volume, the interstitial void/surgical cavity, and the target tissue), and explains their

4
5

10

relationship to each other. The claim then introduces a further component – the radiation source

11

– and describes where the radiation source is located relative to the other components of the

12

device so as to achieve the desired result of asymmetric dosing.

13

The first element of the claim clearly states that the three-dimensional apparatus volume is

14

defined by the expandable outer surface of the claimed apparatus, i.e., it is the three-dimensional

15

region of space within the expandable outer surface. The second element requires that the

16

radiation source is: 1) inside the expandable outer surface, and 2) spaced apart from the apparatus

17

volume. If claim 1 is construed according to its plain meaning, the claim is inoperable and not

18

enabled because it is impossible for the radiation source to be within the outer surface and, at the

19

same time, also to be “located so as to be spaced apart from the apparatus volume” defined by the

20

outer surface. See Raytheon Co. v. Roper Corp., 724 F.2d 951, 956 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (“Because it

21

is for the invention as claimed that enablement must exist, and because the impossible cannot be

22

enabled, a claim containing a limitation impossible to meet may be held invalid under § 112.

23
24
25
26
27

1

Claim 8 further requires: “The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the expandable outer surface is
sufficiently rigid to deform the target tissue into the shape of the expandable outer surface,
causing the predetermined asymmetric isodose curves to penetrate into the target tissue to a
prescribed depth.”

Moreover, when a claim requires a means for accomplishing an unattainable result, the claimed

2

invention must be considered inoperative as claimed and the claim must be held invalid under

3

either § 101 or § 112 of 35 U.S.C.”).

4

There is no factual dispute about this conclusion; it rests solely on claim construction. As

5

claim construction is a matter of law to be decided by the Court, Markman v. Westview

6

Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 388 (1996), summary judgment of non-enablement and

7

inoperability should be entered if the Court adopts SenoRx’s proposed construction, which is

8

discussed at pages 18 to 23 of SenoRx’s Markman brief submitted herewith.

10

C.

Plaintiffs Cannot Rewrite Claim 1 To Preserve Its Validity.

“It is a ‘bedrock principle’ of patent law that ‘the claims of a patent define the invention.’”

11

Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (citation omitted).

12

“Because the patentee is required to ‘define precisely what his invention is’” in the claims, “it is

13

‘unjust to the public, as well as an evasion of the law to construe [the claims] in a manner different

14

from the plain import of [their] terms.’” Id. (quoting White v. Dunbar, 119 U.S. 47, 52 (1886)).

15

The Patent Act’s requirement that a patentee “particularly point[] out” and “distinctly claim[] the

16

subject matter” of his invention, 35 U.S.C. § 112, “‘guard[s] against unreasonable advantages to

17

the patentee and disadvantages to others arising from uncertainty as to their [respective] rights.’”

18

Athletic Alternatives, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., Inc., 73 F.3d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quoting Gen.

19

Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 369 (1938)) (alteration in original). Thus,

20

patent claims serve a critical public policy: “‘to apprise the public of what is still open to them.’”

21

Id. (quoting McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U.S. 419, 424 (1891)). When the “issued patent contains

22

clear structural limitations, the public has a right to rely on those limits in conducting its business

23

activities.” Sage Prods., Inc. v. Devon Indus., Inc., 126 F.3d 1420, 1425 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The

24

legitimate and reasonable construction of claims serves the same interest; if patent claims could be

25

construed to mean virtually anything – even the opposite of a plain definition contained therein, as

26

Plaintiffs’ arguments would have it – the public notice function of patents would be eviscerated.

27

See White v. Dunbar, 119 U.S. at 51 (the claims are not “a nose of wax, which may be turned and

twisted in any direction”).
Thus, it is well-settled law that neither Plaintiffs nor this Court may rewrite the claims

3

through claim construction, even in the face of a flaw in the claim that renders it invalid.

4

“[C]ourts may not redraft claims, whether to make them operable or to sustain their validity.”

5

Chef Am. v. Lamb-Weston, Inc., 358 F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Even “a nonsensical result

6

does not require the court to redraft the claims.” Process Control, 190 F.3d at 1357. In other

7

words, the Federal Circuit has instructed courts to construe the claims in accordance with their

8

plain meaning and other intrinsic evidence, as appropriate, and then to let the chips fall where they

9

may. This is exactly what the Federal Circuit has done in a number of cases, even when this

10

means that the preferred embodiment is not within the scope of the claims, cf., Vitronics Corp. v.

11

Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and even when this results in

12

invalidity.

13

For instance, in Allen Engineering Corp. v. Bartell Industries, Inc., 299 F.3d 1336, 1348-

14

49 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Federal Circuit held certain claims invalid, refusing to rewrite them even

15

in light of a patent specification that clearly was to the contrary. The claim in Allen contained a

16

limitation of a “gear box [pivoting] only in a plane perpendicular to said biaxial plane.” Id. at

17

1349. The description in the patent, on the other hand, described the structure in contrary terms,

18

stating that the “gearbox . . . cannot pivot in a plane perpendicular to the biaxial plane.” Id. Much

19

as Plaintiffs do here, Allen argued that one of skill in the art would understand that the term

20

“perpendicular” in the claim should be read to mean “parallel” in light of the description of the

21

preferred embodiments of the invention in the specification, which were all parallel. Id. The

22

Federal Circuit, however, rejected Allen’s attempts to twist the plain meaning of the claim

23

language based on the embodiments disclosed in his specification: “Allen stretches the law too far.

24

It is not our function to rewrite claims to preserve their validity.” Id.

25

In Chef America, the claim concerned a method of making dough products involving

26

heating an oven to a temperature between 400° F and 850° F. 358 F.3d at 1372. The claim,

27

however, recited “heating the resulting . . . dough to a temperature in the range of about 400° F to

1

850° F,” instead of the oven. Id. (emphasis added). This temperature, the Federal Circuit noted,

2

would burn the dough to “a crisp.” Id. The Federal Circuit refused to read “dough” to mean

3

“oven,” stating that the “ordinary, simple English words [in the claim,] whose meaning is clear

4

and unquestionable” trumped the nonsensical result. Id. at 1373. The words in the claim “mean

5

exactly what they say. The dough is to be heated to the specified temperature.” Id.

6

The same result is required here. The ordinary, simple English words in claim 1 of the

7

’142 patent make clear that the expandable surface defines the apparatus volume; it is plainly not

8

the case, despite Plaintiffs’ attempts to contort the ordinary meaning of the language, that the

9

apparatus volume and surface are the same thing. They are different. The ordinary, simple

10

English words of claim 1 also make clear that the apparatus volume “fill[s]” the “void created by

11

the surgical extraction of diseased tissue.” Thus, the limitation that the radiation source be

12

“located so as to be spaced apart from the apparatus volume” means that the radiation source is

13

located outside of the expandable outer surface. In this way – and only in this way – do the words

14

of the claim “mean exactly what they say.” Chef Am., 358 F.3d at 1373. Had Plaintiffs here

15

wanted claim 1 to read “a radiation source disposed completely within and spaced apart from the

16

expandable outer surface” (essentially their current construction of the “spaced apart” limitation),

17

they clearly could have drafted or amended the claim to so read. In fact, Plaintiffs said exactly

18

that in claim 9 of the ’142 patent. See Ex. 1 (’142 patent), claim 9 (“an expandable outer surface .

19

. . defining a three-dimensional apparatus volume configured to fill an interstitial void created by

20

the surgical extraction of diseased tissue and define an inner boundary of the target tissue being

21

treated; a radiation source disposed completely within and spaced apart from the expandable outer

22

surface . . . .”). However, they chose not to in claim 1, and, as in Chef America, must be held to

23

the consequences.

24

The same result was reached in Process Control. As here, the claim in Process Control

25

explicitly defined a term that, given the term’s definition, meant the claim recited an impossibile,

26

nonsensical limitation. Process Control, 190 F.3d at 1357. The Federal Circuit rejected the

27

patentee’s request to construe the term in accordance with the specification or in accordance with

1

what was intended to have been claimed. Id. at 1356-57. Instead, the Federal Circuit held that

2

the claim language trumped any other evidence allegedly supporting a contrary construction:

3

The district court’s attempt to use the written description to
circumvent the plain language of the claim and the clear definition
of the disputed claim language found therein was inappropriate. . . .
[W]e do not permit courts to redraft claims. . . . Where, as here, the
claim is susceptible to only one reasonable construction, the canons
of claim construction cited by [the patentee] are inapposite, and we
must construe the claims based on the patentee’s version of the
claim as he himself drafted it.

4
5
6
7

Id. at 1357 (emphasis added). As a result, the court in Process Control invalidated the claim as
8
inoperable, holding that it recited an impossibility. Id. at 1359 (“[W]hen an impossible
9
limitation, such as a nonsensical method of operation, is clearly embodied within the claim, the
10
claimed invention must be held invalid.”).
11
The Northern District of California recently cited Process Control in a case raising the
12
exact question at issue here. In Applera Corp. v. Illumina, Inc., No. C-07-02845, 2008 WL
13
501391 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2008), the court recognized that the specification was inconsistent
14
with the claims, but nonetheless held that:
15
After much study of the specification, the undersigned judge is of
the view that the inventor, patent counsel, and the examiner all made
a drafting error. While it is tempting to just fix it up in the claim
construction process, that temptation would be dangerous course, for
it should be up to the PTO in the first instance to amend claims.

16
17
18

Id. at *5. Similarly, Plaintiffs here should not be allowed to rewrite their claims and escape
19
invalidity.
20
The Court in its PI Order suggested claim 1 could be read to require that the apparatus
21
volume defines the inner boundary of the target tissue to be treated, and that this created an
22
ambiguity in the claim that might distinguish Process Control. PI Order at 15-16. In particular,
23
the Court reasoned that it is undisputed that the outer surface of the balloon touches the target
24
tissue; therefore the claim in referring to the “apparatus volume” defining the inner boundary of
25
the tissue could be equating the surface and the volume. Id. at 15. Respectfully, the Court’s
26
conclusions do not follow from its premise.
27

1

boundary of the target tissue and the apparatus volume being a distinct and separate structure from

2

the outer surface (and defined by that surface). The first element of claim 1 recites, on the Court’s

3

reading, that the apparatus volume (1) fills the void created by surgical extraction of diseased

4

tissue and (2) defines an inner boundary of the target tissue being treated. When devices of this

5

type are used, however, these two functions are interrelated and are essentially two sides of the

6

same coin. When the apparatus volume fills the void left by surgical removal of diseased tissue,

7

the device’s balloon is completely inflated and in contact with the inner boundary of the target

8

tissue. As a result, for all practical purposes, the inner boundary of the target tissue is the same as

9

the outer boundary of the void left after tissue has been removed – both are the edge of the cavity

10

that has been filled by the volume. Accordingly, by filling the void left by the surgical extraction

11

of tissue, the apparatus volume also is necessarily defining an inner boundary of the target tissue

12

to be treated – where the “filling” of the void stops, the “defining” of the boundary necessarily

13

begins. Thus, there is no inconsistency between the plain meaning of “apparatus volume” and the

14

apparatus volume defining the inner boundary of the target tissue.

15

Moreover, as discussed in SenoRx’s Markman brief, another plausible reading of the claim

16

is that the expandable outer surface, and not the apparatus volume, defines the inner boundary of

17

the target tissue. But either way, this possible ambiguity does not affect the plain definition of

18

apparatus volume in the claim, and has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Whether the

19

boundary of tissue to be treated is defined by the volume or by the surface, the claim plainly states

20

that the surface defines the volume, and that they are not the same thing.

21

For these reasons, it is respectfully submitted that Process Control governs the result here,

22

and Plaintiffs should be precluded from redrafting their claim through the claim construction

23

process to avoid inoperability and invalidity.

24
25

CONCLUSION
Since the radiation source of claim 1 cannot simultaneously be “within” the outer surface

26

and “spaced apart” from the volume defined by that surface, claim 1 is inoperable and invalid.

27

As claim 8 depends from claim 1, it too should be declared invalid for the same reasons.
