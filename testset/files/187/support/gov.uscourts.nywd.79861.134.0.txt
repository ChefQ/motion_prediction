PLAINTIFF'S MOTION AND NOTICE OF MOTION TO SET DELAYED BRIEFING
SCHEDULE

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Plaintiff Paul Ceglia will and hereby does move the
Honorable Leslie G. Foschio for an order setting a delayed briefing schedule for Defendants'
Accelerated Motion to Compel Compliance with Paragraph 5 of the August 18 Order (Doc. No.
128) (Motion to Compel). Such an order would preserve judicial resources because District
Judge Arcara's rulings on Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's August 18, 2011 Order (Doc. No.
131) (Objections) may render Defendants' Motion to Compel moot. Additionally, Defendants
are in no position to oppose this request given their recent egregious conduct.

Pursuant to L.R. Civ. P. 7(a)(1), Plaintiff hereby states his intention to file and serve reply
papers.
