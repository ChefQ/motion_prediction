IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO
Honorable Marcia S. Krieger
Civil Action No. 14-CV-02182-MSK-KLM
UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
R2 CAPITAL GROUP, LLC,
RAST INVESTOR GROUP, LLC,
MADIGAN ENTERPRISES, INC.,
BULLETPROOF VEST, INC.,
RYAN TOMAZIN,
RYAN MADIGAN, and
RANDELL A. VEST,
Defendants.

JOINT MOTION FOR CONSENT ORDER OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION AND
OTHER RELIEF AGAINST RYAN TOMAZIN AND RAST INVESTOR GROUP, LLC

Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) and Defendants Ryan Tomazin and RAST Investor Group, LLC,
(collectively, the “Tomazin Defendants”) respectfully move the Court to enter the attached
Consent Order of Permanent Injunction and Other Statutory Equitable Relief Against Ryan
Tomazin and RAST Investor Group, LLC.
D.C.COLO.LCivR 7.1(a) Statement
In October 2016, and again in January 2017, counsel for Plaintiff CFTC conferred with
counsel for Defendants Ryan Madigan, Madigan Enterprises, Inc. and R2 Capital (the “Madigan
Defendants”) , in an attempt to bring this Motion as unopposed. Although the parties reached a

Case 1:14-cv-02182-MSK-KLM Document 134 Filed 01/19/17 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 5

consensus on the majority of content in the proposed Consent Order, Paragraphs 29, 42(d), 64 line
5, and 66 remain in dispute: Plaintiff asserts that these paragraphs do not affect the Madigan
Defendants’ liability because paragraphs 17 of the Consent Order specifically states that the
Consent Order does not affect other parties liability; it is Plaintiff’s understanding that the
Madigan Defendants believe that these paragraphs may affect their liability.
I.
INTRODUCTION
This civil enforcement action arises out of the operation of a fraudulent investment scheme
involving the futures and foreign exchange markets, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Accordingly, on November 4, 2014, Plaintiff CFTC filed its First Amended Complaint against the
Tomazin Defendants, the Madigan Defendants, and others, for Permanent Injunction, Civil
Penalties, and Other Equitable Relief, for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7
U.S.C. §§ 1-26 (2012), and the Commission’s Regulations (“Regulations”) promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1-190.10 (2013). (#38)
In 2015, in the Southern District of New York, Defendant Ryan Tomazin pleaded guilty to,
and was sentenced for, his participation in the fraudulent investment scheme and the criminal
violation of Commodity Exchange Act. See https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founder-andmanaging-partner-investment-firm-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court.
Plaintiff CFTC and the Tomazin Defendants have now reached an agreement in the instant
civil enforcement action wherein the Tomazin Defendants have agreed to the entry of the attached
proposed Joint Consent Order. Accordingly, Plaintiff and Defendants Tomazin and RAST, and
their attorneys, have signed their consent on the last page of the attached proposed Consent Order.

II.
ARGUMENT
The proposed Consent Order has no impact on the remaining Madigan Defendants because
it does not refer to the Madigan Defendants’ conduct, and it contains the following language:
The Findings and Conclusions in this Consent Order are not binding on any other
party to this action. Nothing in the Findings and Conclusions in this Consent Order
may be used to establish, reduce, increase, eliminate or in any way affect the
liability of any of the remaining Defendants in this action who are not parties to this
Consent Order.
Attached proposed Consent Order, Paragraph 17.
The entry of the proposed Consent Order will lead to a partial resolution of this matter as to
the Tomazin Defendants, without affecting the liability of the remaining non-settling defendants.
Therefore the proposed Consent Order is consistent with, and will lead to, “the just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination” of this action, in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
Defendants Tomazin and RAST respectfully request that the Court grant this Joint Motion and
enter the attached Consent Order.
