GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO

CR-17-00585-PHX-GMS

Costanzo’s motion to preclude any mention of Tor or the dark net by the government

21

during the entire trial is too broad and should be denied.

While the government

22

acknowledges that—in the wrong context—mention of the dark net or Tor could

23

potentially be prejudicial, a brief mention of those subjects to provide context, background,

24

or to rebut claims made by Costanzo or his witnesses is appropriate and supported by the

25

rules of evidence. Additionally, if granted, Costanzo’s motion would place the government

26

at an unfair disadvantage because it would allow the defense witnesses to freely talk about

27

Tor or the dark net with no opportunity for the government to rebut or respond to that

28

evidence.

I.

Introduction and Background.

2

Costanzo is charged with engaging in five separate financial transactions for two

3

purposes: to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership and control of the

4

undercover agents’ drug money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(3)(B); and with the

5

intent to avoid a transaction reporting requirement that any financial institution would be

6

required to make, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(3)(C). The government has the

7

burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Costanzo acted with the intent to either

8

conceal the nature and source of the dirty money or to otherwise avoid federal transaction

9

reporting requirements. In all of the transactions charged here, Costanzo provided bitcoin

10

in exchange for money represented to be drug proceeds.

11

As mentioned in previous pleadings, this undercover operation began back in 2015,

12

when federal law enforcement began looking closely at peer-to-peer bitcoin exchangers

13

offering their services on a website called localbitcoins.com. (Doc. 79, at 3.) That scrutiny

14

was based on concerns about bitcoin being used to further illegal activity. (Doc. 79, at 7.)

15

That illegal activity included traditional money laundering, but it also included money

16

laundering specifically related to drugs and other contraband being sold on the dark net.

17

(Doc. 79, at 9.)

18

II.

Potential Uses At Trial.

19

Mention of the dark net or Tor at trial would be limited at trial to a few situations—

20

none of which violate the rules of evidence or unfairly prejudice Costanzo. As detailed

21

below, the only potential times when those topics would come up is for background on

22

how this investigation began, to explain the training and experience of a few witnesses, or

23

to rebut or impeach Costanzo or his witnesses. It is also important to bring up during voir

24

dire to determine whether any potential jury members have specialized knowledge or

25

training that could impact their ability to be fair and impartial, or impact their duty to rely

26

solely on the evidence presented at trial.

27

A.

28

It is well-established that agents may explain the origins of an investigation. See,

To Provide Background About The Investigation.

e.g., United States v. Wahchumwah, 710 F.3d 862, 871 (9th Cir. 2013) (denying a

2

confrontation clause claim seeking to preclude complaints by third parties that prompted

3

investigation); United States v. Hassan, 742 F.3d 104, 137 (4th Cir. 2014) (affirming

4

admission of agent’s testimony about information received that explained the origins of the

5

investigation); United States v. Mohamud, 941 F.Supp.2d 1303, 1313 (D. Or. 2013) (“A

6

jury may hear some background information on why a criminal investigation began.”); see

7

also United States v. McLean, 138 F.3d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir. 1998) (“Evidence, not part

8

of the crime charged but pertaining to the chain of events explaining the context, motive

9

and set-up of the crime, is properly admitted if linked in time and circumstances with the

10

charged crime, or forms an integral and natural part of an account of the crime, or is

11

necessary to complete the story of the crime for the jury.”); United States v. Feldman, No.

12

8:14-CR-521-T-27AEP, 2016 WL 3002418, at *5 (M.D. Fla. May 20, 2016) (“The

13

evidence that was admitted simply provided an explanation of why law enforcement

14

targeted pain clinics in general and this Defendant in particular”) (“It provided factual

15

context for the investigation of Defendant and his pain clinic and was necessary to explain

16

why law enforcement sent undercover agents into his medical practice”) (“Evidence

17

describing the rising epidemic of prescription drug abuse and the manner by which the

18

abusers acquired prescription narcotics . . . was certainly relevant to put this case in its

19

proper perspective.”). A brief mention of the dark net is necessary here to put the

20

investigation in context and to explain why federal agents were looking into peer-to-peer

21

exchangers like Costanzo. This type of background and context is particularly important

22

if the defense plans to make arguments to the jury similar to the arguments made back in

23

January before this Court, when defense counsel used strong terms to criticize the

24

government’s investigation in this case. (RT 1/4/18, at 35.) Testimony regarding what

25

prompted this investigation, including use of bitcoin by dark net vendors, is relevant and

26

necessary to explain the origins of this investigation and does not “insinuate the existence

27

of nefarious activity that is confusing,” mislead the jury, or “seek[] to cast aspersions about

28

Mr. Costanzo by association.” (Doc. 135, at 4.)

B.

2

Mention of Tor and the dark net might also come up while agents are providing

3

testimony about their training and background. Many of the witnesses scheduled to testify

4

at trial are part of a joint task force responsible for the investigation of dark net vendors

5

and local drug traffickers who use the dark net to obtain drugs to sale in Arizona. Virtual

6

currency and the dark net go hand in hand. For many of the dark net marketplaces, bitcoin

7

is the only payment method accepted. As such, much of the agents’ training and experience

8

includes training and presentations on the dark net. To exclude the mere mention of an

9

agent’s area of training or expertise because the subject matter can sometimes have a

10

negative connotation is asking too much and is not supported by the rules of evidence. The

11

mere mention of a detective’s training and experience in homicide cases shouldn’t prevent

12

that same detective from mentioning that specialized training and experience during a

13

robbery or burglary trial. It is the same as saying an FBI agent who has experience on the

14

Joint Terrorism Task Force shouldn’t be allowed to mention that training or experience

15

when testifying at a felon in possession of a firearm trial. The mere fact that an agent has

16

training in one area has nothing to do with Costanzo’s character. The exclusion of the

17

agents’ training is not logical and Costanzo cannot establish that the mere mention of

18

specialized training or experience, along with its probative value, is substantially

19

outweighed by unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, delay, or any other reason set forth

20

in Rule 403.

To Provide Information About The Training and Experience of Agents.

21

C.

22

If Costanzo testifies at trial, his knowledge of the dark net and the presence of Tor

23

on his electronic devices could be used to impeach or rebut his testimony. Likewise, if

24

Costanzo’s witnesses at trial attempted to assert that he never used encryption, Tor, or the

25

dark net, the evidence showing that he is familiar with those topics would certainly be

26

relevant to rebut that testimony. Additionally, the argument in Costanzo’s own motion

27

seems to cut against itself. It asks this Court to prevent any mention of Tor—or the fact

28

that it was found on several of his electronic devices—because it would be unfairly

To Rebut or Impeach Costanzo or His Witnesses.

-4-

Case 2:17-cr-00585-GMS Document 140 Filed 03/06/18 Page 5 of 6

1

prejudicial or improper character evidence, but at the same time it argues that many

2

respected people use the Tor browser and that not many people use Tor anymore because

3

“it could no longer provide the degree of anonymity sought by users.” (Doc. 135, at 5.)

4

The bottom line is that mention of the dark net or Tor may be relevant to rebut or impeach

5

Costanzo or his witnesses and the Court should not make a blanket ruling prior to trial

6

excluding any mention of these topics before the defense witnesses have even testified.

7
8

To Ensure That Jurors Do Not Have Specialized Knowledge That Could
Impact Their Ability to be Fair and Impartial.

9

Finally, mention of the dark net is important for voir dire—which is why the

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

D.

government has asked the Court to consider making that inquiry during jury selection.
(Doc. 130, at 4.) As mentioned above, it is important to find out whether potential jury
members have specialized knowledge or training that could impact their ability to be fair
and impartial, or impact their duty to rely solely on the evidence presented at trial.
Alternatively, if the current question of, “Have you ever accessed the dark net?” might
seem too prejudicial or invasive, that question could be softened to “Have you heard about
the dark net?” 1
III.

Conclusion.

18

For the reasons set forth above, Costanzo’s motion to preclude any and all mention

19

of Tor or the dark net by government attorneys or agents is simply too broad. Those two

20

subjects are not character evidence, are relevant to limited parts of the trial and can be

21

presented in ways where any potential prejudice, confusion, or delay does not substantially

22

outweigh the probative value. Thus, the motion should be denied.

The Court may also direct the jury in voir dire away from imputing dark net
suspicions onto Costanzo as to the charged transactions. For example, the Court could
introduce the question by saying, “You may also hear about the use of the dark net to
anonymize purchases made with virtual currency. To be clear, the defendant did not use
the dark net in any of his transactions or communications with undercover agents.”
