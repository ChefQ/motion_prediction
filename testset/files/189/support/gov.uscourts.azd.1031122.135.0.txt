Thomas Mario Costanzo, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully

17

moves this Court moves for an order prohibiting the government and/or its witnesses from

18

introducing evidence and/or making arguments regarding Darknet(s) and/or The Onion

19

Router (Tor). Mr. Costanzo urges that this remedy is appropriate as neither of the

20

contested items is relevant to the charged offenses, FRE 401, 402. To the extent that either

21

of the contested items is relevant, it is more prejudicial than probative, confuses the issues,

22

and/or misleads the jury, FRE 403. Additinally, the introduction of either or both

23

contested items would amount to impermissible character evidence, FRE 404(a)(1).

MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT FROM
GOVERNMENT COUNSEL AND/OR WITNESSES REGARDING
DARKNET & THE ONION ROUTER (Tor)
Thomas Mario Costanzo respectfully moves this Court for an order
prohibiting the government from introducing evidence and/or making argument
regarding Darknet(s) and/or The Onion Router (Tor). It is the position of the defense
that such evidence and/or argument is not relevant, not probative, amounts to improper
character/propensity evidence, confuses the issues, misleads the jury, and/or is a waste
of time. FRE 401, 402, 403, 404(a)(1).

9

Relevant provisions of the Federal Rule of Evidence

10

1. “Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable

11

than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in

12

determining the action.” Rule 401.

13
14

2. Rule 402 provides that: “Relevant evidence is admissible unless any of the following

15

provides otherwise: the United States Constitution; a federal statute; these rules; or

16

other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.”

17
18

3. Rule 403 provides that “The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative

19

value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair

20

prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or

21

needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.”

22
23

4. Rule 404(a)(1) provides that “Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is

24

not admissible to prove that one a particular occasion the person acted in accordance

25

with the character or trait.”

Introduction of Evidence, Argument, or Testimony Regarding Darknet(s) and/or
The Onnion Router (Tor) Will Violate the Above-Cited Federal Rules of Evidence.

2
3

1. Preclude all evidence, argument, or testimony by government counsel or
witnesses as to DARKNET(s).

4
5

The government has noticed in proposed voir dire, Dkt. # 130, that it wishes

6

to inquire of potential jurors in this case whether they have ever “visited the dark net.”

7

This question is far more complicated than it appears:

8

 A Darknet is “a network built on top of the internet…designed specifically for

9

anonymity.”1 There can be more than one network overlay and thus there are

10

any number of darknets…it’s just an anonymous network.2 One such network

11

overlay/darknet is Tor, a browser built expressly for anonymity…only Tor has

12

been far less than anonymous since 2013.3 The darknet options suggested in

13

2014 as replacements to the compromised Tor network—were 12P, Freenet,

14

and GNUnet.4 Given that the article referenced was penned in 2014, those

15

darknets have likely gone the way of Tor and been replaced with some new

16

darknet(s)—four years is an eternity in technologic time.
 Dark Web refers to websites on a darknet.5 The dark web of a darknet cannot

17

be accessed by a search engine or user without permission.6 Just as there can be

any number of darknets, it follows that each darknet may have its own distinct

1

dark web(s).

2

 Deep Web is also not accessible via a search engine, and requires a direct link

3

to access.7

4
5

 Surface Web is the portion of the World Wide Web that is readily available

6

and accessible to the general public and searchable with standard web search
engines.8

This is all very complicated, confusing, and has absolutely nothing to do with the five
money laundering counts in the present indictment.
Of note in this regard is the grand jury testimony of SA Ellsworth. When

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

asked by AUSA Konti whether it was alleged that Mr. Costanzo had “any involvement
with the dark net [sic],” he replied “[n]ot selling anything on the dark net [sic].” See
Dkt. # 83-2 at page 22, lines 10-14. When asked to testify how the undercover agents
came to meet Mr. Costanzo, Ellsworth responded “[a] cold contact off
LocalBitcoins.com.” Id. at lines 7-9. As regards the government’s investigation of Mr.
Costanzo and subsequent sting, there is simply no nexus to a darknet, rendering this
term and all its negative connotations irrelevant. FRE 401, 402.
Reference to “the dark net” by the government serves no purpose but to

18
19
20
21

insinuate the existence of nefarious activity that is confusing, misleading to the jury, and
seeks to cast aspersions about Mr. Costanzo by association. FRE 403, 404(a)(1).
Reference to darknets or “the dark net” should thus be precluded on these grounds, both
in voir dire and throughout the upcoming trial.

22

2. Preclude evidence, argument, or testimony by government counsel or
witnesses as to the Tor browser.

23

25

The government has provided notice to defense counsel that it intends to elicit
testimony and/or offer evidence regarding the presence of The Onion Router (Tor) on

one or more of the electronic devices seized from the home of Mr. Costanzo in April
2017.9 Tor was briefly discussed above in relation to the explanation of Darknet. Of
note, reports that by 2014, usage of Tor had dropped dramatically because it could no
longer provide the degree of anonymity sought by users.10
That Tor was discovered on devices seized from Mr. Costanzo does not tend

5
6
7
8
9

to make any fact relevant to his guilt or innocence in this case more or less probable.
FRE 401. The implicit message, however, of the government’s desire to offer this
evidence is once again the insinuation that the presence of the Tor browser is an
indicator of nefarious activity and familiarity with “the dark net.” FRE 403, 404(a)(1).
This characterization ignores the multitude legitimate uses and users of the

10
11
12
13
14
15

Tor network.11 Journalists, researchers, activists, and whistleblowers, as well as regular
people trying to protect themselves from unwanted advertising, marketing, and even
identity thieves are among the users of Tor.12 The defense does not dispute that there are
those who would use anonymous or semi-anonymous networks for illicit purposes, but
there are clearly those who use it to protect their privacy, which is not a crime.13 Of note
here, the government has no evidence that there was an illicit purpose for the Tor

16
17

purportedly found on devices seized from Mr. Costanzo. There is no nexus and no
relevance to Tor in the instant case at the upcoming trial of Mr. Costanzo.14

The defense has moved to exclude recently disclosed digital discovery, which would
