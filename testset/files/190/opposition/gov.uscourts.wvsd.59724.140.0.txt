PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO FOLA’S MOTION FOR
PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND IN SUPPORT OF THEIR
CROSS-MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON COUNT
ONE OF THEIR FOURTH AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT
Introduction
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs file this
memorandum in opposition to Fola Coal Company, LLC’s (Fola’s) motion for summary
judgment and in support of Plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment and a permanent
injunction on Count One of their Fourth Amended and Supplemental Complaint. Plaintiffs
contend that the Defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) violated its obligations
under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to
provide adequate public notice and comment and to involve the public in its environmental
impact analysis when the Corps issued an individual permit under § 404 of the Clean Water Act
(CWA) to Fola Coal Company, LLC (Fola) for its Ike Fork No. 1 and No. 2 Surface Mines.
Facts
On April 13, 2005, the Corps issued a public notice of its proposed issuance of an
individual § 404 permit to Fola to place fill material in 32,731 linear feet of streams in the

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 2 of 17

Sycamore Run, Ike Fork, and Lily Fork watersheds of Buffalo Creek near Gilboa in Nicholas and
Clay Counties in West Virginia in conjunction with the construction of eleven valley fills for the
Ike Fork No. 1 and Ike Fork No. 2 Surface Mines. Buffalo Creek is a tributary of the Elk River.
Public Notice, Pl. PI Ex. 1 (maps omitted), AR Vol. 1, Tab 8. 1 The notice stated that the
applicant had not submitted a Compensatory Mitigation Plan (CMP) to compensate for impacts
of the stream-filling activities. Id., p. 3. The notice also did not contain any conceptual
description or statement about Fola’s mitigation plan. Based on this extremely limited
information, Plaintiffs submitted comments opposing the issuance of this permit prior to the May
14, 2005 close of the 30-day public comment period. OVEC Comments, AR Vol. 2, Tab 14;
Corps Permit Evaluation and Decision Document (DD), p. 129, Pl. PI Ex. 2A-2E, AR Vol. 6,
Tab 35.
On November 2, 2004, four months before this public notice, the Corps informed Fola
that in order to process its request for an individual § 404 permit, Fola would have to submit a
CMP and an Environmental Information Document (EID) to the Corps. Pl. PI Hearing Ex. 16;
Corps PI Hearing Ex. 1, AR, Vol. 2, Tab 6. The letter stated that the information in these two
documents “provides the factual basis for the Corps to make the aforementioned conclusions
[that the project is consistent with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines and is not contrary to the
public interest] to facilitate final IP decisions” and “is required in order to process an IP request.”
Id., p. 2. Thus, the CMP and EID were essential to process Fola’s permit.
Fola submitted its initial Compensatory Mitigation Plan (CMP) to the Corps in October
2006 and a supplemental CMP in December 2007, more than two years after the close of the

Except for Pl. Ex. 16, which was submitted at the October 22-24, 2008 hearing, all exhibits referenced in this brief
were previously submitted in support of Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.

comment period. DD, p. 27; AR Vol. 3; AR Vol. 4, Tab 23; AR Vol. 6, Tab 30. The initial
CMP contains 65 pages, not counting its seven appendices, and the supplemental CMP and its
three appendices contain an additional 146 pages. AR Vol. 3; AR Vol. 4, Tab 23. Fola
submitted its revised EID to the Corps in January 2007. AR Vol. 5, Tab 26. The EID contains
276 pages, and its appendices contain hundreds of additional pages. Id. Thus, the CMP,
supplemental CMP, and EID total over 487 pages.
The Corps provided copies of Fola’s EID and CMP on January 25, 2007, and November
3, 2006, respectively, to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. EPA, WVDEP, WV Division of
Natural Resources, WV Division of Culture and History, and the federal Office of Surface
Mining for review and comment. DD, p. 11. The Corps stated that “[t]he mitigation proposal
has been thoroughly reviewed by this office and the state resource agencies and it has been
determined that successful implementation of the plan would adequate compensate for
unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources.” DD, Appendix J, p. 8, Pl. PI Ex. 3. The Corps did
not make either the EID or the CMP available to the public for review and comment before it
issued Fola’s permit.
On March 5, 2008, nearly three years after the public notice, the Corps issued an
individual § 404 permit to Fola for the two Ike Fork Mines, authorizing Fola to place fill material
in 33,143 linear feet of streams in the Sycamore Run, Ike Fork, and Lily Fork watersheds in
conjunction with the construction of ten valley fills. Permit, Pl. PI Ex. 4, AR Vol. 6, Tab 36.
Seven of the 18 Special Conditions in this permit are based on the CMP. Id., Nos. 12-18.
Special Condition 12 incorporates the entire CMP by reference.
The permit was accompanied by a 144-page Decision Document with eleven appendices
3

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 4 of 17

totaling an additional 201 pages. Pl. PI Ex. 2, AR Vol. 6, Tab 35. The DD contains twenty
pages describing Fola’s mitigation plan, and forty pages describing environmental impacts. Id.,
pp. 18-38, 38-78. None of this material was contained in the Public Notice. The Corps made no
other efforts to involve the public in its analysis of these issues before its decision was issued. In
its response to public comments, the Corps criticized Plaintiffs’ comments as being “very general
in form” and containing “little specific content” about Fola’s project. DD, p. 129.
According to the Corps’ DD, “[t]he proposed valley fill construction would permanently
eliminate approximately 261 acres of in-stream, riparian and upland forest habitat within the
designated footprints of Valley Fills 1, 2 and 3 at Ike Fork No. 1 Surface Mine and Valley Fills 17 at Ike Fork No. 2 Surface Mine.” DD, p. 81. The valley fills would bury 28,258 feet of
streams. DD, p. 2. “[M]ost biological activity would be essentially eliminated within the
footprints of the proposed valley fills and mine through areas.” DD, p. 118. “The discharge of
pollutants, which is dredged or fill material, and the associated impacts of the overall project,
would result in losses of wildlife habitat, as well as eliminate many functions presently
performed by the headwater stream systems of the Buffalo Creek watershed.” Id. at 133.
The Corps used its interim Functional Assessment Approach for High Gradient Streams
(FAAHGS) and its “best professional judgment” to measure the structure and function of
impacted and mitigated streams. DD, pp. 25-26, 113; id., App. J, pp. 4, 8, 10, 12. To attempt to
mitigate the stream loss from valley filling, the Corps approved Fola’s CMP that would require it
to create 36,416.5 linear feet of stream channels on previously mined areas in the Laurel Fork
watershed. DD, p. 25; id., App. J, p. 10. The Corps stated that “[s]tream mitigation is relatively
new and evolving science and has the risk of failure that is inherent in efforts with limited
4

Filed 04/15/09 Page 5 of 17

experience or history.” DD, p. 36.
The Corps found that past, present, and future actions in the cumulative impact area
related to the Fola mine have impacted or will impact 66.8% of the streams in the Lily Fork
watershed and 20.8% of the streams in the Buffalo Creek watershed. DD at 84, 109; id., App. H
pp. 13-14, Pl. PI Ex. 5.
The Fola Ike Fork No. 1 and No. 2 Surface Mines will mine and disturb coal and
overburden with elevated levels of selenium, which will cause selenium discharges into nearby
streams. The Corps erroneously assumed that Fola’s Material Handling Plan addresses selenium.
DD, App. J, pp. 20-21. In fact, it does not and only addresses “potentially acid producing
materials.” DD, p. 109; Pl. PI Ex. 6. Recent WVDEP stream sampling downstream from
adjacent mines in the same and nearby watersheds shows that selenium levels in streams in those
watersheds exceed state water quality standards. Pl. PI Ex. 7.
The Corps concluded that the impacts of the Fola project would be insignificant and
therefore no environmental impact statement was required. The Corps’ determination of
insignificance rested on its repeated statements that “the proposed compensatory mitigation is
adequate to off-set impacts to aquatic resources proposed for impact,” the “compensatory
mitigation, as proposed, is sufficient to offset unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources,” and
“[t]he losses would be appropriately compensated for via the applicant's revised compensatory
mitigation plan and post-mining revegetation plan.” DD, pp. 79, 84, 86, 133.
On October 31, 2008, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction,
based in part on its finding that Plaintiffs had raised a substantial question whether the Corps had
complied with notice procedures under the CWA and NEPA. Document #77, pp. 7-8. The
5

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Court stated that:
The Corps relied on mitigation measures in the issuance of a FONSI for the Ike Fork
permits. These measures were not mentioned, much less explained, in the public notice.
Rather, they were described, in detail, in a Compensatory Mitigation Plan, Supplemental
Compensatory Mitigation Plan, and Environmental Decision Document submitted after
the close of the public comment period.
Id. at 8. The Court concluded that “Whether the public was involved to the extent required by
law is fair grounds for litigation and deserves more deliberate inquiry.” Id.
Argument
I.

The Corps Violated the CWA and Its CWA Regulations on Public Notice
The Corps violated the CWA by issuing a public notice on Fola’s permit application

without first obtaining and reviewing Fola’s EID and CMP because that application was not
complete, and the public could not meaningfully comment on it. Under the Corps’ regulations,
an application is complete “when sufficient information is received to issue a public notice.” 33
C.F.R. § 325.1(d)(10), as amended by 73 Fed. Reg. 19670 (April 10, 2008). That definition of
completeness specifically cross-references the Corps’ public notice regulation, which provides
that a public notice must contain “sufficient information to give a clear understanding of the
nature and magnitude of the activity to generate meaningful comment.” 33 C.F.R. § 325.3(a)
(emphasis added). Required information includes “available information which may assist
interested parties in evaluating the likely impact of the proposed activity, if any, on factors
affecting the public interest.” Id. § 325.3(a)(13) (emphasis added). Thus, a permit application is
not complete unless and until it contains sufficient information on the nature, magnitude, and
impacts of the proposed activity. If that information is not yet available, the application is not
complete and the public notice cannot be issued.
6

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 7 of 17

Fola argues that because the Corps’ regulations do not specifically require submission of
the EID or CMP, or even a brief mitigation statement, prior to the issuance of the public notice,
no such obligation exists. Fola SJ Mem. 6. Fola also argues that the fact that the Corps later
amended its regulations to require permit applications and public notices to require a description
of proposed mitigation shows that such a description was not required under the rules in force
when Fola’s application was submitted. Id.; see 33 C.F.R. §§ 325.1(d)(7), 332.4(b).
However, the regulatory language requires a common sense evaluation of what
information is necessary to clearly understand a project’s impacts. By that standard, Fola’s
application was not complete without its EID and CMP, and the public notice could not be issued
without them. The EID and CMP were necessary for a clear understanding of the nature,
magnitude, and likely impacts of Fola’s proposed Ike Fork No. 1 and No. 2 Surface Mines. The
table of contents for the EID shows that it contains over 60 pages analyzing alternatives, actions
to minimize environmental effects, and factual determinations under the 404(b)(1) guidelines.
AR, Vol. 5, Tab 26. It also contains nearly 200 pages analyzing the affected environment and
environmental impacts. Id. Similarly, Fola’s CMP tries to measure stream losses and describes a
plan for mitigating and offsetting those losses. Pl. PI Ex. 13, 14. The CMP was central to the
Corps’ decision to grant the Fola permit. The Corps’ decision document devotes nearly forty
pages to discussing the CMP in great detail. DD, pp. 38-78.
The “clear understanding” requirement in the Corps’ public notice regulation embodies
the fundamental principle of administrative law that, “in order to have a ‘meaningful’
opportunity to comment, one must be aware of the information the agency finally decides to rely
on in taking agency action.” National Asphalt Pavement Ass’n v. Train, 539 F.2d 775, 779 n. 2
7

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 8 of 17

(D.C. Cir. 1976). Under this regulation, the Corps must “present for public scrutiny the rationale
and pivotal data underlying its proposed action before the close of the comment and hearing
period.” National Wildlife Federation v. Marsh, 568 F. Supp. 985, 994-96 (D.D.C. 1983).
“[W]ithout pivotal data and information, public comment cannot be meaningful.” Friends of the
Earth v. Hall, 693 F. Supp. 904, 948 (W.D. Wash. 1988).
The courts in the Marsh and Hall cases each found that activities under § 404 permits
were illegal because the Corps violated these public participation requirements. In Marsh, the
court enjoined activities under a § 404 permit because the Corps relied on an important report
that was prepared after the close of the public comment period. 568 F. Supp. at 994-96. In Hall,
the court enjoined the Navy from proceeding with a project with a § 404 permit because the
Corps failed to disclose a monitoring plan that “was the centerpiece of the Corps’ mitigation
plan.” 693 F. Supp. at 938. Similarly, in this case, Fola’s EID and CMP contain pivotal data and
information that must be submitted for public comment before the Corps can make its decision to
grant a permit.
Fola relies heavily on Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Wood, 947 F. Supp.
1371, 1381 (D. Or. 1996). Fola SJ Mem. at 8-9. In that case, the court approved the Corps’
failure to allow supplemental comment on the applicant’s alternatives analysis and mitigation
plan. In doing so, the court provided no analysis of the importance of that information or the
completeness of the applicant’s application, and merely noted that the plaintiffs had had an
opportunity for comment on similar issues earlier in the process. Id. at 1381.
The Wood decision is not inconsistent with the two decisions cited by Plaintiffs which
require the Corps to “present for public scrutiny the rationale and pivotal data underlying its
8

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 9 of 17

proposed action before the close of the comment and hearing period.” Marsh, 568 F. Supp. at
994-96; Hall, 693 F. Supp. at 948. In Wood, the court found that the Corps had received public
comment on the data (even though it had not been officially submitted for public notice) and
addressed those comments, 947 F. Supp. at 1381, which was not true in Marsh or Hall and is not
the case here. Even if Wood were inconsistent with Marsh or Hall, these two decisions are more
persuasive and, to the extent that Wood is inconsistent with them, it was wrongly decided,
particularly in view of the significant precedent that has interpreted similar provisions requiring
meaningful notice consistently with Marsh and Hall. See, e.g., Am. Radio Relay League v. FCC,
524 F.3d 227, 236-40 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 475 F.3d 83, 111-13 (2d Cir.
2007); Indep. U.S. Tanker Owners Comm. v. Lewis, 690 F.2d 908, 924-26 (D.C. Cir. 1982); U.S.
Lines v. FMC, 584 F.2d 519, 534-35 & n.44 (D.C. Cir. 1978).
Alternatively, even assuming arguendo that Fola was not required to submit its EID and
CMP prior to the issuance of the initial public notice, those documents were sufficient to trigger
the need for a supplemental notice when they were later submitted. When the Corps receives
new information that “is a change in the application data that would affect the public’s review of
the proposal,” it must issue “a supplemental, revised or corrected public notice.” 33 C.F.R. §
325.2(a)(2). Here, the EID and CMP together devote over 487 pages to environmental impact
analysis and mitigation, while documents available at the time of the public notice contained
nothing whatsoever on these topics. A shift from no impact analysis and no mitigation plan to a
lengthy EID and CMP discussing those topics is a sufficient change affecting the public’s review
to require a supplemental notice.
While Fola cites two cases that have upheld Corps decisions not to issue a supplemental
9

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 10 of 17

public notice, neither of those cases involved a data gap as large as the one represented by the
EID and CMP in this case. Fola SJ Mem. at 9; B&B P’ship v. U.S., 133 F.3d 913, 1997 WL
787145, at *6-*7 (4th Cir. 1997) (unpublished) (alleged failure to submit the applicant’s plan
modification for supplemental comment); Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 450 F.
Supp.2d 503, 535-36 (D.N.J. 2006) (alleged failure to allow supplemental comment on data
submitted with the applicant’s response to public comments). In contrast, the 487-plus pages
comprising Fola’s EID and CMP contain all of Fola’s environmental analysis and the central
basis for the Corps’ decision.
Finally, Fola argues that Plaintiffs had sufficient information to prepare meaningful
comments because those comments were “extensive” and of “considerable length.” Fola SJ
Mem. at 7-8, 10. In fact, however, Plaintiffs’ comments were extensive and lengthy despite the
lack of sufficient information, not because the information was sufficient. In its response to
public comments, the Corps criticized Plaintiffs’ comments as follows:
The comments are very general in nature and contain little specific content regarding the
applicant’s proposed project referenced in Public Notice 200400967. . . . Most of these
comments are general in nature and do not appear to apply specifically to the referenced
project. The use of comments relating to a NWP 21 is not applicable here since Fola has
applied for a Section 404 CWA IP. Since an IP requires a much more rigorous agency
review, a substantial amount of project specific support information must be provided to
the Corps so as to allow a project specific review in accordance with NEPA and 40 CFR
230 review process. The Corps uses this process to evaluate the project specific
information and determine whether the project's impacts are significant or not and present
their findings. The NEPA guidelines stipulate the Corps carefully consider the probable
direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed activity. Speculative, unsupported
or unsubstantiated impacts are not considered probable and, since most of the ACEE
comments contain little, if any, information regarding specific impacts associated with the
proposed activities, such comments do not fall in the required probable category for
consideration by the Corps.
DD, pp. 129-30 (emphasis added). Thus, Fola’s argument—that Plaintiffs’ comments were
10

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 11 of 17

meaningful—is flatly inconsistent with the rationale used by the Corps in its response to
comments—that Plaintiffs’ comments could not even be considered because they lacked projectspecific information. Of course, the reason Plaintiffs’ comments could not be more specific was
because the public notice gave them nothing specific to work with. The Corps’ public notice
therefore violated its regulations.
II.

The Corps Violated NEPA Public Participation Requirements
The NEPA regulations require the Corps to “involve environmental agencies, applicants,

and the public, to the extent practicable, in preparing” environmental assessments. 40 C.F.R. §
1501.4(b). This regulation has been interpreted to mean that “[a]n agency, when preparing an
EA, must provide the public with sufficient environmental information, considered in the totality
of circumstances, to permit members of the public to weigh in with their views and thus inform
the agency decision-making process.” Bering Strait Citizens for Responsible Dev. v. U.S. Army
Corps of Eng’rs, 524 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2008).
The Corps violated NEPA by not circulating Fola’s EID and CMP to the public before
making its decision. There is no doubt that it was practicable for the Corps to do so, since it
circulated both documents to other government agencies. DD, p. 11. The obvious reason why
the Corps circulated the EID and CMP was because those documents were necessary to allow
other agencies to evaluate Fola’s project.
According to the Corps’ own guidance document on EIDs, “[t]he goal of [the
environmental impacts] section [of the EID] is to provide sufficient information for the Corps to
determine if the environmental impacts of the project are in compliance with the Section
404(b)(1) Guidelines or contrary to the public interest.” Corps NEPA Guidance Document, Pl.
11

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 12 of 17

PI Ex. 10, p. 6. The guidance document evaluates each of the public interest factors under the
Guidelines and identifies numerous gaps where additional information is needed in the EID to
comply with NEPA. Id. at 6-21. The Corps therefore relies on the applicant’s EID to assure
NEPA compliance.
Similarly, the CMP was the centerpiece of the Corps’ determination of insignificant
effects under NEPA. The Corps’ determination of insignificance rested on its repeated
statements that “the proposed compensatory mitigation is adequate to off-set impacts to aquatic
resources proposed for impact,” the “compensatory mitigation, as proposed, is sufficient to offset
unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources,” and “[t]he losses would be appropriately compensated
for via the applicant's revised compensatory mitigation plan and post-mining revegetation plan.”
DD, pp. 79, 84, 86, 133.
Fola misstates Plaintiffs’ NEPA claim as a demand that the Corps had to circulate its
Environmental Assessment for public comment before it was issued. Fola SJ Mem. 11. All of
the cases Fola cites are limited to that issue. Id. Plaintiffs have not raised such a claim. Instead,
their argument is that the Corps must provide sufficient environmental information prior to the
release of the EA so that the public can participate meaningfully in the NEPA process. The
Ninth Circuit’s decision in Bering Strait directly supports Plaintiffs’ argument.
Fola also argues that the Corps’ notice contains sufficiently detailed information to meet
its NEPA obligations, and that Plaintiffs’ extensive comments demonstrate that it understood the
mitigation issues. Fola SJ Mem. 11-12. However, Plaintiffs’ lack of access to over 487 pages of
the EID and the CMP during the public comment period violated NEPA requirements and denied
Plaintiffs a meaningful opportunity to comment. Furthermore, by rejecting Plaintiffs’ comments
12

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 13 of 17

as too general, the Corps’ response to those comments demonstrates that its dissemination of
information was inadequate and failed to provide a sufficiently specific picture of the action the
Corps was proposing to take. The Corps’ selective circulation of documents to agencies but not
to the public also violates the NEPA regulation which expressly grants “environmental agencies,
applicants, and the public” equal rights of access to the environmental assessment process. 40
C.F.R. § 1501.4(b).
As the court stated in Marsh, “if the public is not apprised of the rationale behind a
proposed decision, or if the public is informed of the rationale only after the close of the
comment and hearing period, then the agency cannot be said to have provided a realistic
opportunity for public hearings or meaningful comments.” 568 F. Supp. at 993. As the court
quoted from U.S. Lines, 584 F.2d at 540:
Only when the public is adequately informed can there be any exchange of views and any
real dialogue as to the final decision. And without such dialogue any notion of real public
participation is necessarily an illusion.
568 F. Supp. at 993. The Corps therefore violated the CWA and NEPA by issuing an inadequate
public notice and failing to circulate the EID and CMP for public review prior to its decision.
Plaintiffs were forced to prepare their public comments in the dark, raising only general
objections in anticipation of what they believed the Corps might do based on past experience.
Then the Corps sat back and reviewed a mountain of undisclosed information, relied upon this
information as the basis for its resulting permit decision, and only released the information when
it issued the permit accompanied by a lengthy decision document. Absent judicial intervention to
enforce the law, this makes a mockery of the public participation requirements of the CWA and
NEPA. It also resembles trial by ambush, where one side resists all discovery and then unleashes
13

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 14 of 17

all of its material on the eve of trial.
The Court is also prejudiced by the Corps’ violations. The purpose of having robust
public comments and the agency’s reasoned response to those comments is to ventilate the issues
in the administrative record. “The agency’s explanation must simply enable a reviewing court ‘to
see what major issues of policy were ventilated by the informal proceedings and why the agency
reacted to them the way it did.’” State of S.C. ex rel. Tindal v. Block, 717 F.2d 874, 886 (4th
Cir. 1983); see Am. Radio Relay League, 524 F.3d at 236-37 (quoting Sierra Club v. Costle, 657
F.2d 298, 334, 397-98 & n. 484 (D.C. Cir.1981) (“Public notice and comment regarding reliedupon technical analysis, then, are “[t]he safety valves in the use of . . . sophisticated
methodology.”)). The reviewing court can then determine if the agency’s decision was arbitrary
and capricious based on that record. Here, the Corps’ violations have prevented the development
of such a record, and have left it as a one-sided statement of the Corps’ position. No public
participation has actually occurred because there “was no opportunity for a real dialogue or
exchange of views.” U.S. Lines, 584 F.2d at 540. The Corps has stacked the deck in its favor by
suppressing meaningful public input.
III.

Plaintiffs’ Claim Regarding Selenium Impacts Is Not a Public Notice Claim
Fola’s characterizes Plaintiffs’ claim concerning selenium impacts as a public notice

issue. Fola SJ Mem. 12-13. However, as Plaintiffs explained in their preliminary injunction
briefs, that issue relates to Plaintiffs’ claim that the Corps inadequately considered cumulative
impacts. Pl. PI Mem. 17-18, Document #37; Pl. PI Reply Mem. 18-21, Document #56. Fola
specifically excluded non-public-notice claims from its motion for partial summary judgment.
Fola SJ Mem. 2. The selenium issue is therefore not within the scope of Plaintiffs’ public notice
14

Case 3:08-cv-00979 Document 140

Filed 04/15/09 Page 15 of 17

claims or Fola’s current motion, and it is premature to reach this issue.
Conclusion
For these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny Fola’s motion for
partial summary judgment, grant Plaintiffs’ cross-motion for partial summary judgment, issue a
permanent injunction against the Corps ordering it to vacate the § 404 permit for the Fola Ike
Fork No. 1 and Ike Fork No. 2 Surface Mines, and remand that permit to the Corps to correct its
violations.
