STATEMENT OF NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Federal Insurance Company ("Federal") filed a Motion for Summary Judgment to
which the City of Newark ("the City") filed an answering brief and Federal filed a reply.
The Court denied Federal's Motion by written Memorandum and Order dated April 5,
2006.
Federal has filed a Motion for Reconsideration and Reargument. This is the

City's Answering Brief.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
The Court properly denied Federal's Motion for Summary Judgment. Federal
simply restates its previous arguments and requests a different result. Federal misled the
Court in its request to file its Motion for Summary Judgment and relies in its Motion for
Reargument upon deposition testimony which has been clarified and which very much
indicates a factual dispute. Federal's heavy reliance on witness testimony is an admission
that the dispute is factual in nature and, as the Court has already ruled, summary

judgment is inappropriate. Federal's Motion for Reconsideration should be denied.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The City incorporates herein by reference its Statement of Facts set forth in its

Answering Brief to Federal's Motion for Summary Judgment.

Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 137 Filed 05/03/2006 Page 5of7

ARGUMENT

Federal bases its Motion for Reconsideration on the argument that the Court failed
to consider certain elements of Federal's Motion for Summary Judgment, notwithstanding
the detailed Memorandum issued by the Court explaining its decision which serves as
proof that the Court devoted significant time reviewing the issues. Federal simply repeats
the same arguments and the same caselaw and requests a different result. Federal
includes repeated citation to the testimony of the City's 30(b)(6) designee Caroi Houck
thereby essentially admitting that the dispute is fact-based. The Court correctly ruled that
materia] facts are in dispute and that summary judgment is inappropriate.

The Court should note that Federal requested leave to file its Motion for Summary
Judgment, writing to the Court on February 2, 2006: "Federal's motion is based entirely
on the law, the contracts and written communications among the parties. Deposition
testimony will not add to or subtract from the relevant facts necessary for the Court to
resolve Federal's summary judgment motion..." Notwithstanding the representation that
no discovery was needed to support its motion, Federal relies heavily on fact witness
testimony taken after leave was granted and to which the City has not had the opportunity
to rebut as discovery is ongoing.

The unilateral use of the Deposition of Carol Houck in a motion for summary
judgment, and a subsequent decision relying upon same, will effectively nullify all
further discovery with regards to the factual issues presented by her testimony. (See
Clark v. Tarrant County, 798 F.2d 736, 746 (5" Cir. 1986), wherein the Court states that
the "purpose of the Rule 56 notice requirement is that the summary judgment may not be

used to cut off discovery").
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 137 Filed 05/03/2006 Page 6of7

And as to the so-called admitted "facts," Federal argues yet again that the
November 21, 2003 letter cannot both satisfy the performance bond and the construction
contract. Federal quotes a statement by Carol Houck procured on the third day of her
testimony. Ms. Houck was asked if she believed the November 21, 2003 letter satisfied
the seven-day notice requirement of the contract (not Federal's performance bond) to
which she replied "I don't believe so." It is reliance on this quote that Federal believes
entitles it to summary judgment on its performance bond. However, Ms. Houck clarifies
in her Errata Sheet:

Further, my reply on line 9 is incorrect if it suggests that the November 21,

2003 letter was not the seven-day notice letter. My reply, "I don't believe

so" would reflect my understanding that the November 21, 2003 letter was

not the only effort made by Newark to put both Durkin and the Surety on

notice. I believe that the November 21, 2003 letter was one of the seven-

day notices as were the February 3 and February 4, 2004 letters.

Exhibit A. The point is, there still exists a dispute of fact with respect to the November
21, 2003 letter. In its Memorandum on the import of the November 21, 2003 letter and a
related letter written on February 3, 2004, the Court correctly stated that "whether the
content of those letters actually fulfilled the City's obligations is a question for the
factfinder."

Motions for reconsideration are to be granted sparingly. Karr v. Castle, 768
F.Supp. 1087, 1090 (D.Del.1991). The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is not to
"rehash arguments already briefed." Dentsply Int'l. Inc. v. Kerr Mfg. Co., 42 F.Supp.2d
385, 419 (D.Del.1999). (See also Exhibit B, Abu-Jamal v. Horn, No. CIV. A. 99-5089,
2001 WL 1609761, at *9 (E.D.Pa.2001) "A motion for reconsideration is not to be used

as a means to reargue matters already argued and disposed of or as an attempt to relitigate

a point of disagreement between the Court and the litigant.") Yet Federal does exactly
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 137 Filed 05/03/2006 Page 7 of 7

that; rehashes the arguments that have already been briefed and decided by the Court.
The Motion for Reconsideration should not be granted. In ruling that the issue is one of
material fact and not controlling law, certification pursuant to 28 USCA 0x00A7 1292(b) is also
inappropriate.
CONCLUSION

WHEREFORE, for the reasons as stated above, Defendants City of Newark, its
Mayor and Council Members, request this Honorable Court for an Order DENYING
Federal's Motion and for an Order finding Federal in default of its Bond.
