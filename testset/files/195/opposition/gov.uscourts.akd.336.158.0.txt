Objection the Summary Judgment

~ Come now Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes ("the Hymes") with this

Renewed Opposition to Summary Judgment at Docket 139 under the law of necessity

Pleading into a territorial court, being the United States District Court noting that the

Hymes have filed their Pleading into a District Court of the United States arising under

Article III of the Federal Constitution in all Cases in Law and Equity exercising the

judicial Power of the United States under the Authority of the United States.Jennifer D.

Auchterlonie ("Auchterlonie") who represents "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"

("USA") as an unknown Plaintiff presumably as found in 48 U.S.C. 1406f, ie. "United

States of America, scilicet, the President of the United States;" and, "United States of

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document158 ~~ Filed 12/21/2007 Page 2 of 26

_ America, ss, the President of the United States." The USA from disclosure as to it's true
identity has been protected by Judge Beistline ("Beistline") who is a mere employee of the
Government of the United States per his Form 61 under Beistline's signature and not an
Officer of the United States arising under the Federal Constitution Article 2 Section 2
Clause as plead already in this instant Case and of course not affirmed or denied any by
Auchterlonie, the USA or Beistline.
Auchterlonie has also refused to disclose if she is an attorney or counselor-at-law
in any of the several States or in the United States, it's territories or possessions,
therefore the presumption is that Auchterlonie is not an attorney licensed to
practice in of the courts of the United States arising under Article III of the Federal

Constitution.

which to date is undetermined as to which "United States" that Auchterlonie
purports that this "United States" might be of the three existing per the Supreme
Court of the United States. Beistline has protected Auchterlonie from disclosing
same. The Hymes therefore are denied the right to even determine the moving
parties in this instant case as according to the holdings in Hooven & Allison Co. v.
Evatt, 324 U.S. 652, 671, 672 (1945).

The United States District Court ("USDC"), being a mere territorial court with the.
appearance of an Article III Court of the United States, is not a District Court of

the United States arising under Article III in all Cases in Law and Equity exercising
the judicial Power of the United States under the Authority of the United States,

2

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document158 ~~ Filed 12/21/2007 Page 3 of 26

The Pleading of Docket 153, with all attachments, is incorporated in total into this
Pleading. This has not been ruled upon by Beistline.

If the creation of the purported evidence from the ether by the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") was in actual evidence, then the Hymes have absolutely no means _
to defend against same in the USDC territorial court in Alaska. The IRS just has
any party in the world input data into some computer and then some IRS
"employee" just signs and magically there is no defense to the "created"
appearance of evidence.

According to Auchterlonie's Summary Judgment pleading at Docket 139,
Auchterlonie invokes the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 803(8). Without Rule
803(8)'s essential elements, Federal Rule of Evidence 902(1) is precluded.

Rule 803(8), to wit:

(8) Public records and reports. Records, reports, statements, or data
compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A)
the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to

duty imposed by law_as to which matters there was a duty to report,
excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers

and other law enforcement personnel, or (C) in civil actions and
proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings

resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law,
unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of
trustworthiness. [Emphasis added]
_ As the Hymes have plead over and over that Auchterlonie's actions by, through
and for the USA, United States and the IRS are not in compliance with the statutory "laws
of Congress" as found the public records of the CODE of including, but not limited to 26

U.S.C, et seq.

Auchterlonie's proffering of the 4340 Report is untrustworthy and in reality totally
3
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document158 ~~ Filed 12/21/2007 Page 4 of 26

`in violation of the mandates of 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7805, 5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 552(a)(1) and
substantive regulations that have the force and effect of law as found in the public
records of the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR").
Auchterlonie purports to use the hearsay evidence Rule 803(8) to create the
presumption of evidence. The crucial issue admissibility is whether the information
lacks trustworthiness Sage v. Rockwell International Corp., 477 F.Supp. 1205, |
1206-1207 (D.C. N.H. 1979).
Hearsay evidence is inadmissible in summary judgment proceedings to the same
extent that it is inadmissible in a trial. See Eisenstadt v. Centel, 113 F.3d 738, 742
(7" Cir. 1997). If a Trial by Jury can be accomplished by Form 4340s, there is no
reason to have any witnesses present.

incompetent and inadmissible especially if first hand knowledge of facts can be

obtained. In the adjudged decision of the Supreme Court of the United States of

the well settled rule pronounced in Donnelly v. United States, 228 U.S. 243, 276-

277 citing Queen v. Hepburn, 7 Cranch 290, 295, to wit:

**461 Queen y, Hepburn (1813) 7 Cranch, 290, 295, 3 L. ed. 348, 349,

was a suit in which the petitioners claimed freedom, and certain depositions
"were rejected by the trial court as hearsay, This court, speaking through

Chief Justice Marshall, said:

`These several opinions of the court [meaning the trial court] depend on
one general principle, the decision of which determines them all. It is
this: that hearsay evidence is incompetent to establish any specific fact,
which fact is in its nature susceptible of being proved by witnesses who

Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document158 ~~ Filed 12/21/2007 Page 5 of 26

speak from. their own knowledge. . . .It was very justly observed by a
great judge [FN4] that `all questions upon the rules of evidence are of
vast_importance to all orders and degrees of men; our lives, our liberty,
and our property are all concerned in the support of these rules, which
have been matured by the wisdom of ages, and are no revered from their
antiquity and the good sense in which they are founded.' Qne of these
rules is that `hearsay' evidence is in its own nature inadmissible. That
this species of testimony supposes some better testimony which might be
adduced in the particular case is not the sole ground of its exclusion. It

intrinsic weakness, its incompetency to satisfy the mind of the existence
of the fact, and the frauds which might be practised under its cover,
combine to support the rule that hearsay evidence _is_ totally
inaddmissible._. . . The danger of admitting hearsay evidence _is
sufficient to admonish courts of justice against lightly yielding to the

*277_ introduction of fresh exceptions to_an_ old and well-established
rule, the value _of which is felt and acknowledged by all. If the

circumstance that the eyewitnesses of any fact be dead should justify the

introduction of testimony to establish that fact from hearsay, no man could

feel safe in any property, a claim to which might be supported by proof so

easily obtained: ---This- court is not-inclined-to-extend-the exceptions -_---___-- ---
further than they have already been carried.' .

Auchterlonie affidavit is self-serving and is of no value in a summary judgment.

See Chambers v. Stern, 64 S.W. 3d 737, 742 (Sup. Ct Ark 2002); Owsiak v. Kimco

Corp.,
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document158 ~~ Filed 12/21/2007 Page 6 of 26

Auchterlonie attempts to use hearsay evidence exemption of Rule 803(8) to deny
the Hymes a Trial by Jury and examples of the revered computer Form 4340 with a
signature of some mere employee purportedly and a seal is from Docket 139 Exhibit A for
Donald Louis Hymes as an Offer of Proof, being Attachment 1 with other Forms 4340
from Docket 139 being Exhibits B, C and D not included. As an example as an Offer of
Proof of one of the two Notices of Federal Tax Lines filed against Donald Louis Hymes
of Exhibits S and T of Docket 139, the Hymes have included Exhibit S, being
Attachment 2.

Rita MariNa Hymes submits as an Offer of Proof of Auchterlonie's revered Form
4340 from Docket 139 Exhibit J, being Attachment 3. Exhibit L, M and N are not
included. As an example as an Offer of Proof of a NFTL Rita MariNa Hymes submits
from Docket 139 Exhibit U, being Attachment 4.

So one of many essential elements of this revered self-serving Form 4340, that is
proffered by Auchterlonie and her machinations, is the question, is it "trustworthy"
as it includes these NOTICES OF FEDERAL TAX LIENS? |

Upon inspection of one of the "Notices of Federal Tax Liens" ("NFTL"), noting as
a matter of law that there does not exist a "Federal Tax Lien" which on it face makes is
a false security at a minimum.

So the question becomes: are the "NFTLs, being Attachment 2 and Attachment
4 in the revered Form 4340s "trustworthy" or are they a total fraud?

Auchterlonie is bound by the statutory authority of the "laws of Congress" as

found the CODE of in particularly Title 26 of the United States Code ("U.S.C.") that are

neither "Laws of the United States" or even the ruse of "positive law" and Title 26 CFRs
that are substantive regulations with the statutory authority of Congress's CODE.
Statutory Authority of Congress in 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7805 for Regulations for IRS

Under the statutory authority of Congress in 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7805 is mandate to
prescribe all needful rules and regulations in relation to the internal revenue, to
wit:

_ Authorization.--Except where such authority is expressly given by this
title to any person other than an officer or employee of the Treasury
Department, the Secretary shall prescribe all needful rules and
regulations for the enforcement of this title, including all rules and
regulations as may be necessary by reason of any alteration of law in
relation to internal revenue. {Emphasis added]

In prescribing the rules and regulations for the administration of the internal
revenue, the regulations must effectuate the will of Congress as expressed by statute.

The pronouncement by the Supreme Court of the United States in the adjudged
decision of Dixon v. United States, 381 U.S. 68, 74 (1965) is that a regulation can not
alter a statute and the statute must carry into the effect the will of congress expressed by
the statute and if it does not do this, it is a mere nullity, to wit:

Indeed, long before the tax year here in question this Court had made it
clear that: `The power of an administrative officer or board to administer a
federal statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is not
the power to make law * * * but the power to adopt regulations to
carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute. A
regulation which does not do this, but operates to create a rule out of
harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity.' Manhattan General
Equipment Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, 297 U.S. at
134, [FN7] 56 S.Ct. at 400. .
* OR OK

'The statute defines the rights of the taxpayer and fixes a standard by which
such rights are to be measured. The regulation constitutes only a step in
the administrative process. It does not, and could not, *75 alter the
statute. [Emphasis added]

Service Com'n of City of New York, 463 U.S. 582, 616 (1983); Ernst & Ernst, 425 U.S.
185, 213 (1976); U.S. v. Larionoff, 431 U.S. 864, 873 (1977); Legal Environmental
Assistance Foundation, Inc. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 118 F.3d 1467,
1473 (11 Cir. 1997).

In the adjudged decision of the Jn re Managed Care Litigation, 135 F.Supp.2d
1253, 1271.(11" Cir. 2001) citing Dixon, supra. Ibid at 1271 and in Managed Care at
1271, Stewart v. Berstein,.769 F.2d 1088, 1093 (5" Cir. 1985; "[T]he federal regulations
can not themselves create a cause of action; this is a job for the legislature"; "[N]o implied
private right of action can be found from regulations standing alone" citing Sandoval v.
Hagan, 7 F.Supp.2d 1234, 1256 n.20 (N.D.Ala. 1998).

It seems quite clear that the statutory authority to promulgate regulations is
posited in 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7805 for the IRS; and, that the regulations must put into effect the
will of Congress or the regulation is a nuiiity.

Court is to Assure that 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7805 IRS Regulations
Fall Within Congressional Mandate

The Court does not sit as a committee to perfect the administration of tax laws and
the Court is only to assure that the Commission's regulation fall within his authority to
implement the Congress's mandate; and, this is found in the adjudged decision of the
Supreme Court in United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 306-307 (1967), to wit:

But we do not sit as a committee of revision to *307 perfect the
administration of the tax laws. Congress has **450 delegated to the
Commissioner, not to the courts, the task of prescribing `all needful rules
and regulations for the enforcement' of the Internal Revenue Code. 26
U.S.C. s 7805(a). In this area of limitless factual variations `it is the
province of Congress and the Commissioner, not the courts, to make
the appropriate adjustments.' Commissioner v. Stidger, 386 U.S. 287,
296, 87 S.Ct. 1065, 1071, 18 L.Ed.2d 53. The rule of the judiciary in
cases of this sort begins and ends with assuring that the
8

 
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document158_~ Filed 12/21/20070x00B0 Page 9 of 26

Commissioner's regulations fall within his authority to implement the
congressional mandate in some reasonable manner. [Emphasis
added]

See U.S. v. Carwright, 411 U.S. 546, 550 (1973); Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U.S.
741, 749-751 (1969); Bob Jones Univ. v. U.S. Goldsboro Christian Schools, Inc., 461
U.S. 574, 596 (1983).

In the adjudged decision of United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532
U.S. 200 (2001) it was held, to wit:

The Court does not **1436 sit as a committee of revision to perfect the
administration of the tax laws. United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299,
306-307, 88 S.Ct. 445, 19 L.Ed.2d 537. Instead, it defers to the
Commissioner's regulations as long as they implement the
congressional mandate in a reasonable manner. /d., at 307, 88 S.Ct.
445. [Emphasis added]

In the adjudged decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in CIR. v.
Portland Cement Co. of Utah, 450 U.S. 156, 157 (1981) it was held "This Court
customarily defers to Treasury Regulations that "implement the congressional mandate in
some reasonable manner." United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 307, 88 S.Ct. 445, 450
(1967). See also CLR. ibid at 169.

In the adjudged decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in National
Muffler Dealers Assoc. Inc. v. United States, 440 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1979) citing
Correll, supra. and the Court also pronounced at 477, to wit:

We do this because "Congress has delegated to the [Secretary of the
Treasury and his delegate, the] Commissioner [of Internal Revenue],
not to the courts, the task of prescribing `all needful rules and
regulations for the enforcement' of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 -
U.S.C. B 7805(a)." United States v. Correll, 389 U.S., at 307, 88 S.Ct. at
449, That delegation helps ensure that in "this area of limitless factual
variations," ibid., like cases will be treated alike. It also helps guarantee
that the rules will be written by "masters of the subject," United States v.
Moore, 95 U.S. 760, 763, 24 L.Ed. 588, 589 (1878), who will be
9
 

Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document 158-~ Filed 12/21/2007 Page 10 of 26

responsible for putting the rules into effect. [Emphasis added]

It seems quite clear that the Court does not sit as a committee to perfect the -
administration of the tax laws: and, the IRS is to promulgate regulations under the
statutory authority of Congress; and, the Courts exercise review over the IRS actions.

The IRS is to Administer the Tax Laws with Regulations only in Title 26 of the
CFRs

The IRS has in the procedural regulation of 26 CFR 0x00A7 601.101 stated that it will
administer regulations only contained in Title 26 of the CFRs "The regulations relating to
the taxes administered by the Service are contained in Title 26 of the Code of Federal
Regulations."

Therefore any regulations contained in Title 27 are irrelevant and only regulations
contained in Title 26 of the CFRs have any bearing on the internai Tax Laws of the United
States.

Statutory Authority and Mandate of Congress in 5 U.S.C. 552(a) to the IRS and
other Agencies to Publish Substantive Regulations in the Federal Register and if not
so Published, a person's Rights can't be Affected. |

Congress mandates to agencies to publicize in the Federal Register various
information so the public has timely notice and the most important of the regulations are
the substantive regulations in 5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 552(a)(1)(D) and if not so published a person's
rights can't be affected, to wit:

(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law,

and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability

formulated and adopted by the agency; and

(E) each amendment, revision, or repeal of the foregoing.
