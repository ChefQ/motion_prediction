and the courts of the United States are to take judicial notice. This holding is found in the
adjudged decision of Caha v. United States, 152 U.S. 211, 221, 222 (1894), to wit:

But we are of opinion that there was no necessity for a formal introduction
in evidence of such rules and regulations. They are matters of which courts
of the United States take judicial notice.

[T]he rules and regulations prescribed in pursuance of such authority
become a mass of that body of public records of which the courts take
judicial notice.

On judicial notice, see also Lilly v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., 317 U.S. 481,
488 (1943) and The United States v. Heschmaker, 63 U.S. 392, 405 (1859).

The courts are to give public acts legal effect, and this is held in the adjudged
decision of Armstrong v. United States, 80 U.S. 154, 156 (1871), to wit:

This was a public act of which all courts of the United States are bound to
take notice, and to which all courts are bound to give effect.

Regardless of whether the sovereign is de jure or de facto, determinations by the
executive or legislative branch binds the judges, even if not formally put into evidence, and
this is held in the adjudged decision of Jones v. United States, 137 U.S. 202, 212, 214
(1890), to wit:

Who is the sovereign, de jure or de facto, of a territory, is not a
judicial, but a political question, the determination of which by the
legislative and executive departments of any government conclusively
binds the judges, as well as all other officers, citizens, and subjects of
that government. This principle has always been upheld by this court, and
has been affirmed under a great variety of circumstances. Gelston v. Hoyt,
3 Wheat. 246, 324; U. S. v. Palmer, Id. 610; The Divina Pastora, 4 Wheat.
52; Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 307, 309; Keene v. McDonough, 8 Pet.
308; **84Garcia v. Lee, 12 Pet. 511, 520; Williams v. Insurance Co., 13
Pet. 415; U. S. v. Yorba, 1 Wall. 412, 423; U. S. v. Lynde, 11 Wall. 632,
638.

All courts of justice are bound to take judicial notice of the territorial

extent of the jurisdiction exercised by the government whose laws they

administer, or of its recognition or denial of the sovereignty of a foreign
power, as appearing from the public acts of the legislature and
executive, although those acts are not formally put in evidence, nor in
accord with the pleadings. U. S. v. Reynes, 9 How. 127; Kennett v.
Chambers, 14 How. 38; Hoyt v. Russell, 117 U. S. 401, 404, 6 Sup. Ct.
Rep. 881; Coffee v. Groover, 123 U. S. 1, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1; State v.
Dunwell, 3 R. I. 127; State v. Wagner, 61 Me. 178; Taylor v. Barclay, and
Emperor of Austria v. Day, above cited; 1 Greenl. Ev. B 6. [Emphasis
added]

Therefore, the Court shall take judicial Notice of all public records, adjudged
decisions of all the courts, and documents, whether cited in this specific document or not.

Therefore the Hymes will be filing in a very extensive pleading on the issues of
material/genuine facts presuming that an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will
probably be required, including also that 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 132 establishes that the United
States District Court is merely a territorial Court dressed up to appear as an Article III
court, according the public records. It, therefore, exercises no judicial Power of the
United States under the Authority of the United States arising under Article III.

The Hymes incorporate all of their unrebutted affidavits, to date, in this instant
case into this Pleading as issues of material facts.

The Hymes have the secured right to have all of the issues "adjudicated on the
merits."

In the adjudged case of Lambert v. Blodgett, 393 F.3d 943, 969 (9" Cir. 2004), it
was held that "adjudicated on the merits" means substance and not procedural, to wit:

(1) phrase "adjudicated on the merits" means a decision finally resolving

the parties' claims that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,

rather than on a procedural, or other, ground;

And further, ibid at 968 citing Neal v. Puckett, 239 F.3d 683, 696 (5" Cir. 2001)

3
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document150 ~~ Filed 10/09/2007 Page4of5

"defining adjudication on the merits as referring "to whether a court's disposition of the
case was substantive as opposed to procedural." " [Emphasis added]

Therefore out of necessity, the Hymes are filing this Document with the right to
amend which will be forthcoming and also using the 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1746 out of necessity in

this Pleading.
