DEFENDANTS

HINDS COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI’S
MEMORANDUM OF AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED COMPLAINT
Comes now Hinds County, Mississippi, by and through counsel, and pursuant to
Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and submits its Memorandum of
Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss. In support of the same, the moving
defendant would show unto the Court as follows:
INTRODUCTION
This suit arises out of Plaintiff’s former employment with the Hinds County
District Attorney’s Office and her subsequent termination therefrom. Am. Compl.,
CM/ECF Doc. No. 1-1. Plaintiff asserts claims against Defendants District Attorney Smith
and Hinds County, Mississippi for racial and gender discrimination under Title VII,
retaliation under Title VII, violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, civil
conspiracy, First and Fourteenth Amendment claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983, discharge
in violation of public policy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of
privacy. Id.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
According to Plaintiff, she began her career as an ADA in the Twenty-First
Judicial District – Holmes, Humphreys, and Yazoo Counties – and was recruited by
Defendant Smith to work for him as an ADA in Hinds County. Am. Compl., ¶ 19.
Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint asserts that she had a stellar record as an ADA with the
Hinds County District Attorney’s Office; however, during her tenure there she
admittedly utilized the District Attorney’s letterhead for personal reasons. Id. at ¶ 26-28.
In particular, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint concedes that she wrote to a self-storage
facility regarding past due fees which she owed, wherein she misrepresented to the
storage facility that it was the State of Mississippi who owed the money – not Plaintiff –
and that she was awaiting approval from the State to render payment. Id. Plaintiff
admitted to composing this letter on letterhead belonging to the Office of the District
Attorney. Id. Plaintiff also admits that she had a criminal history of writing bad checks.
Id. at ¶ 54-60.
Nevertheless, according to Plaintiff, District Attorney Smith routinely gave her
verbal affirmation for her efforts as an ADA. Trouble purportedly began for her when
she complained about fellow employees smoking in the Hinds County Courthouse. Id.
at 7. The State Fire Marshall investigated the allegations and, per the Plaintiff “issued a
warning regarding the smoking….” Id. at 8.
Plaintiff alleges that after she complained about the smoking she was subject to
vandalism of her name tag at her designated parking space, an anonymous phone call,
2

and an anonymous letter about her writing “bad checks.” Id. at 9-10. In addition,
Plaintiff contends that after having reported the smoking violations, a Hinds County
District Attorney’s Office Investigator handed her a letter of termination effective
January 9, 2014. Id. at 14-15. Afterwards, Plaintiff allegedly learned that Defendant
Smith disclosed to her cohorts that she was terminated for writing bad checks and for
having written the letter regarding her personal arrearages on office letterhead. Id. at ¶
78.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs this Motion inasmuch
as a responsive pleading has already been filed. CM/ECF Doc. No. 5; see e.g., Jones v.
Greninger, 188 F.3d 322, 324 (5th Cir.1999); Robertson v. Mullins, 2:12CV57-MPM-DAS,
2013 WL 1319759, at *1 (N.D. Miss. Mar. 26, 2013)(same). The standard for addressing a
motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is the same as that for
addressing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). In re Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co.,
624 F.3d 201, 209–10 (5th Cir. 2010). Thus, to survive moving Defendants’ Motion,
Plaintiff’s Complaint must provide the grounds for entitlement to relief—including
factual allegations that when assumed to be true "raise a right to relief above the
speculative level." Cuvillier v. Sullivan, 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007)(quoting Bell Atl.
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553-56 (2007)). The complaint must allege "sufficient
factual matter…to state a claim that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570. "A claim has
facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the
3

reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. at 556.
A court should not accept "threadbare recitals of a cause of action's elements, supported
by mere conclusory statements," which "do not permit the court to infer more than the
mere possibility of misconduct." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949-50 (2009). As
outlined below, the Plaintiff’s state law claims are due to be dismissed.
ARGUMENT
As explained in detail herein below, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint fails to state
a claim against Hinds County and is due to be dismissed.
I.

FEDERAL CLAIMS
A.

Title VII Race, Sex & Retaliation

First, Plaintiff asserts that she was discriminated against by Hinds County based
on her race and sex. In addition, she contends that she was retaliated against for
engaging in a protected activity under Title VII. Am. Compl., p. 20-21. "Title VII prohibits
an employer from discriminating' against any individual with respect to his
compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. " Nasti v. CIBA Specialty Chems.
Corp., 492 F.3d 589, 593 (emphasis added).
Plaintiff’s employer in this case was not Hinds County. Title VII defines an
employer as “a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or
more employees ... and any agent of such a person....” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). Included in
this definition are “governments, governmental agencies, [and] political subdivisions.”
4

42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a). The term “employee” is subsequently defined as “an individual
employed by an employer....” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f). This definition contains an important
exception: the term “employee” “shall not include any person elected to public office
in any State or political subdivision of any State by the qualified voters thereof, or
any person chosen by such officer to be on such officer's personal staff, or an
appointee on the policy making level or an immediate adviser with respect to the
exercise of the constitutional or legal powers of the office. The exemption ... shall not
include employees subject to the civil service laws of a State government, governmental
agency or political subdivision. Id. (emphasis added); see also Paxton v. Bearden, 783 F.
Supp. 1011, 1015 (N.D. Miss. 1992).
The Hinds County District Attorney, Robert S. Smith, is an elected State official.
See Brooks v. George County, Mississippi, 84 F.3d 157, 168 (5th Cir. 1996). Furthermore, it is
well-settled that a “district attorney’s office in the State of Mississippi is considered an
arm of the State.” Burnett v. Hinds Cty., Miss. ex rel. Bd. of Sup'rs, 2015 WL 5785562, at *2
(S.D. Miss. Sept. 11, 2015). District Attorney Smith was elected by the voters of Hinds
County and, by statute, chooses his staff members such as Plaintiff.

Furthermore,

District Attorney Smith is authorized to remove staff members such as the Plaintiff, not
Hinds County. See, Miss. Code Ann. § 25-31-6 (staff members may be removed by
D.A.); Miss. Code Ann. § 25-31-8 (district attorney, not the board of supervisors, “shall
be authorized to assign the duties of any employees). Because Mr. Smith is not a
County official nor is the Hinds County District Attorney’s office a county office, Hinds
5

County is not Plaintiff’s “employer” insofar as Title VII is concerned. Plaintiff’s Title VII
claims for race and gender discrimination, as well as retaliation, must be dismissed
because Hinds County never employed Plaintiff.
B.

Civil Conspiracy

Although she fails to cite to a specific statute, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint
asserts that Smith and “[t]he defendants” acted “in concert and engaged in a conspiracy
designed to harass, threaten and intimidate the Plaintiff.” Regardless of whether
Plaintiff is asserting a conspiracy under Section 1983 or Section 1985, she has failed to
assert factual allegations sufficient to state a claim that is plausible on its face against
Hinds County and, as such, this claim must be dismissed.
C.

1983—First Amendment & Due Process

Plaintiff also asserts constitutional claims under Section 1983 for alleged
violations of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. A local government, like
Hinds County, can be held liable under Section 1983 for violating a citizen’s
constitutional rights only if “the governmental body itself ‘subjects’ [that] person to a
deprivation of rights or ‘causes’ a person ‘to be subjected’ to such deprivation.” Connick
v. Thompson, 131 S. Ct. 1350, 1359 (2011). Governmental entities are “responsible only for
[their] own illegal acts” and are “not vicariously liable under § 1983 for [their]
employees’ actions.” Id. Thus, there is no respondeat superior liability under Section 1983;
rather, the key to municipal liability is demonstrating that the deprivation of a
constitutional right was inflicted pursuant to an official policy or custom of the
6

municipality in question. Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Serv., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). Simply
put, the unconstitutional conduct asserted “must be directly attributable to the
municipality through some sort of official action or imprimatur.” Piotrowski v. City of
Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir. 2001).
Here, to establish liability against Hinds County, the Plaintiff must demonstrate
(1) an official policy or custom, of which (2) a policymaker can be charged with actual
or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional violation whose “moving force” is
that policy or custom. Rivera v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist, 349 F.3d 244, 247-249 (5th Cir.
2003). A “policy or custom” can be either (1) a policy statement, ordinance, regulation,
or decision that is officially adopted and promulgated by the municipality's lawmaking
officers or by an official to whom the lawmakers have delegated policy-making
authority; or (2) a persistent, widespread practice of city officials or employees, which,
although not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common
and well settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.
McGregory v. City of Jackson, 335 Fed. Appx. 446, 448-449 (5th Cir. 2009).
The Plaintiff must also demonstrate a link between the policy and the
constitutional violation, and the policy must be maintained with “objective deliberate
indifference” to a constitutionally protected right. Lawson v. Dallas County, 286 F.3d 257,
263 (5th Cir. 2002).

A municipality acts with objective deliberate indifference if it

promulgates a policy or custom despite the “known or obvious consequences that
constitutional violations would result.” Piotrowski, 237 F.3d at 567.
7

Deliberate

indifference of this sort is a stringent test, and “a showing of simple or even heightened
negligence will not suffice” to prove municipal culpability. Id. at 579.
Plaintiff asserts that District Attorney Smith violated her First Amendment rights
when he terminated her employment purportedly for complaining about a “breach of
the security of the check unit computer.” Am. Compl., p. 21. Regardless of whether
Plaintiff has pled a claim for a First Amendment violation, such a claim cannot be made
against Hinds County as these are not even allegations that any Hinds County policy
was the moving force behind the incidents about which Plaintiff complains. Again,
District Attorney Smith is a State employee NOT a County employee. Because the
district attorney and the district attorney’s office are “considered an arm of the State of
Mississippi,” Hinds County can have no liability for Smith’s alleged conduct. High v.
Pearl River County Dist. Attorney, 2012 WL 5450065, at *2 (S.D. Miss. November 7, 2012).
D.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (the “CFAA”) Title 18 U.S.C. §
1030(a)(5)(A).

Plaintiff also asserts that District Attorney Smith allowed the retrieval and
misappropriation of Plaintiff’s personal confidential data in violation of the CFAA. Am.
Compl., p. 21. District Attorney Smith is not a County official and Hinds County cannot
be held responsible for his alleged conduct. Brooks v. George County, Mississippi, 84 F.3d
157, 168 (5th Cir. 1996).

8

II.

STATE CLAIMS
A.

Mississippi Tort Claims Act.

Claims for monetary damages against a political subdivision in Mississippi
arising out alleged tortious conduct, are governed exclusively by the Mississippi Tort
Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. § 11-46-1, et seq. City of Tupelo v. Martin, 747 So. 2d 822,
826 (Miss. 1999). Under the MTCA, sovereign immunity is waived for the State of
Mississippi and its political subdivisions; however, this waiver is subject to numerous
limitations, restrictions and exceptions.
1.

Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy.

Plaintiff asserts a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.
Mississippi is an employment-at-will state to the extent that it follows the common-law
rule that one may be terminated at the will of the employer, thus meaning that “either
the employer or the employee may have a good reason, a wrong reason, or no reason
for terminating the employment contract.” DeCarlo v. Bonus Stores, Inc., 989 So. 2d 351,
354 (Miss. 2008)(citing Kelly v. Miss. Valley Gas Co., 397 So.2d 874, 875 (Miss. 1981)). The
two exceptions to employment-at-will rule are as follows: (1) an employee who refuses
to participate in an illegal act shall not be barred by the common law rule of
employment at will from bringing an action in tort for damages against his employer;
(2) an employee who is discharged for reporting illegal acts of his employer to the
employer or anyone else is not barred by the employment at will doctrine from bringing
action in tort for damages against his employer. DeCarlo, 989 So. 2d at 355.
9

Again, Hinds County was not Plaintiff’s employer, nor does it employ Defendant
Smith, and, as such, it cannot be held liable for Defendant Smith’s discharge of Plaintiff.
Further, the MTCA has not waived sovereign immunity for conduct arising out of the
illegal acts of governmental entities’ employees. See Miss. Code Ann. § 11-46-5(2).
2.

Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.

Plaintiff claims that she suffered an intentional infliction of emotional distress as
a result of Smith’s conduct. More specifically, Plaintiff asserts his conduct was such to
“evoke outrage and revulsion…[and was] malicious, willful, wanton, grossly careless,
indifferent and/or reckless.” Am. Compl. , p. 24.
The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that torts which require proof of malice
as an essential element are excluded from the MTCA. See Weible v. USM, 89 So.3d 51, 64
(Miss Ct. App. 2011)( Zumwalt v. Jones County Bd. of Supervisors, 19 So. 3d 672, 688-89
(Miss. 2009)). Furthermore, even claims for which malice is not a necessary element of
proof “fall outside the MTCA if the plaintiff alleges that the defendant(s) acted with
malice.” Delaney v. Miss. Dept. of Public Safety, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9600 (S.D. Miss.
2013). Here, Plaintiff asserts malice and, as such, her claim is wholly barred by the
MTCA.
In addition to the above, Hinds County can have no liability for Smith’s conduct
as he is not an employee of Hinds County but, rather, is a State employee.

10

3.

Invasion of Privacy.

In Mississippi, the tort of invasion of privacy is comprised of four distinct and
separate sub-torts: (1) the intentional intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion of
another; (2) the appropriation of another's identity for an unpermitted use; (3) the
public disclosure of private facts; and (4) holding another to the public eye in a false
light. Plaxico v. Michael, 735 So. 2d 1036, 1039 (Miss. 1999).
Here, the Plaintiff fails to provide allegations explaining her invasion of privacy
claim; however, any of the above sub-torts would necessarily involve conduct outside
the course and scope of an employee’s employment. Thus, even were Smith a Hinds
County employee, the County can have no liability for an invasion of privacy claim as it
has not waived sovereign immunity for the same. See Miss. Code Ann. § 11-46-5(2).
In addition, because Smith is not an employee of the County but, rather is a State
employee, Hinds County can have no liability for this claim.
CONCLUSION
For all of the reasons stated and authorities cited hereinabove, as well as in
Hinds County’s Motion to Dismiss, the Plaintiff’s claims against the County are due to
be dismissed.
