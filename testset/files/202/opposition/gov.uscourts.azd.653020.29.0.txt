Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 29 Filed 03/26/12 Page 2 of 15

Intervention should be denied because applicants have not satisfied the second and forth
requirement for intervention as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), that is,
the applicant must claim a `significantly protect-able' interest relating to the property or
transaction which is the subject of the action and the Applicants! interests are not adequately
represented by the parties to the action. In this case, the Federal Defendants adequately represent
Applicants' interests and the Applicant has not demonstrated a protect-able interest relating to the
legality of the Defendant's actions under NEPA or any other law. The only issue at hand, is
whether the Northern Arizona Withdrawal (NAW) was properly conducted under NEPA.
Movant Intervenor's environmental and cultural interests have nothing to do with whether the
NAW is legal, which is the sole and only issue to be decided by the Court.

Intervention should be denied because Applicants have failed to demonstrate a
significantly protect-able interest and to demonstrate that the Federal Defendants will not make
the same arguments as Applicants and have thus failed the second and forth prong of the four

rule test for intervention as of right.

BACKGROUND

Plaintiffs' lawsuit concerns the unlawful withdrawal and closure of 1 million acres of land
in Northern Arizona as described by Defendant Salazar's Record of Decision ("ROD") for the
Northern Arizona Proposed Withdrawal ("NAPW'") signed on January 9, 2012.

In the 1984 Arizona Wilderness Act, Congress, inter alia, designated over 250,000 acres

of federal land on or near the Arizona Strip in northern Arizona as wilderness and released about

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 29 Filed 03/26/12 Page 3 of 15

600,000 acres of land in the same area for multiple use, including uranium mining. Pub. L. 98-
406, Title III, 98 Stat 1485 (August 28, 1984).

This portion of the Act was the result of historic compromise between environmental
groups, uranium mining interests, the livestock industry, and others. See, e.g., The Northern
Arizona Mining Continuity Act of 2011: Hearing on H.R. 3155 Before the H. Subcomm. on
National Parks, Forests and Public Lands (November 3, 2011) (Statement of Sen. John
McCain), available at
http://naturalresources.house.gov/UploadedFiles/McCainOpening 1 1.03.11.pdf.

On July 21, 2009, Defendant Salazar proposed to withdraw from location and entry under
the Mining Law approximately 633,547 acres of public lands and 360,002 acres of National
Forest System lands on and near the Arizona Strip for up to 20 years. 74 Fed. Reg. 35,887-88
(July 21, 2009). A substantial portion of these lands were made available for multiple uses,
including mining, under the compromise that resulted in the 1984 Arizona Wilderness Act.

The Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 designated lands not set aside for wilderness, were
to be administered under the "multiple use doctrine" and were open to mineral entry under the
Mining Law. The Congress specifically recognized the NAP W area had a high potential for
uranium production and encouraged the staking of claims and the mining of uranium on these
lands. The southern parcel of the NAPW area is in the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab
National Forest and has been managed under the multiple use doctrine and was open to mineral
entry under the Mining Law.

The NAPW area lands were never designated to be managed for their wilderness
characteristic as the Arizona Wilderness Act makes clear that multiple use activities could be

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 29 Filed 03/26/12 Page 4 of 15

conducted up to the boundaries of designated wilderness areas and that buffer zones were not to
be created.

The Defendant used his withdrawal authority under Section 204(c) of the Federal Land
Policy Management Act to unilaterally impose his will, at the behest of environmental groups
such as the Applicants, in contradiction to the express intent of Congress as expressed by the
Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984. Because the proposed withdrawal was a major Federal action,
the Defendant had to comply with the requirements of NEPA and so ordered an EIS be written to
inform a withdrawal decision.

The resultant EIS is the foundation of Plaintiffs complaint. Although the FEIS does not
conform to the requirements of NEPA on so many levels, it is clear to see that the EIS was
manipulated to provide some modicum of cover for the Defendant to justify a withdrawal.
However, this attempted cover was achieved by unlawfully ignoring the requirements of NEPA
and by violating the establishment clause of the Constitution. The FEIS, even as written, does not
provide sufficient rationale for the Defendant's ROD, such that this decision cannot be
considered anything but arbitrary and capricious under the APA.

Prior to January 20, 2009, the Department of the Interior's position regarding the land in
the "NAPW" area was consistent with the Arizona Wilderness Act. After this time, the new
Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, at the admitted urging and lobbying of the Applicants and
various other supportive legislators (for example Rep. Grijalva) decided to propose a withdrawal
for the NAPW lands despite there being no evidence that current laws and regulations were

inadequate to protect the environmental and cultural values of these lands.

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 29 Filed 03/26/12 Page 5 of 15

The Applicants and their supporters worked hand in hand with the Defendant to actualize
the proposed withdrawal process. Although the FEIS for the NAPW provides no justification for
choosing Alternative B, a complete withdrawal, the Defendant chose this alternative anyway. The
Defendant's rationale for choosing the preferred alternative was not based on the facts or science
in the Draft EIS, but was in response to the comments submitted (part of the Draft EIS process)
as a result of an email campaign orchestrated by the Applicants. In essence, the Defendant took a
vote. Tallying those emailed form letters that supported a complete withdrawal, and then
"deciding" on the preferred alternative in the Applicant's favor.

The Defendant deferred to Applicant's and their supporter's desires for a total withdrawal
(Alternative B), even though substantive comments submitted demonstrated that the Draft EIS
was not in compliance with NEPA and did not support Alternative B as the preferred alternative.

The Final EIS was published on October 26, 2011 with very little modification as a result
of the comments received. The comments submitted by Plaintiff and others were ignored and
dismissed without substantive analysis as required by NEPA. The Defendant demonstrated, by
this action, a single minded commitment to a predetermined path toward a withdrawal as desired
and lobbied for by the Applicants.

ARGUMENT
APPLICANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO INTERVENE AS OF RIGHT
The party seeking intervention bears the burden of showing the requirements for
intervention are met. Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810,
820 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting importance of "nonconclusory allegations" and supporting
evidence). An applicant to intervene as of right must demonstrate (1) the application is

"timely;" (2) "the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which
is the subject of the action;" (3) the applicant's interest "may as a practical matter" be
"impair[ed] or impede[d];" and (4) "the applicant's interest is [not] adequately represented
by existing parties." Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).

Plaintiffs does not dispute that the Applicants' Motion is timely. However, as
detailed below, Applicants have not carried their burden to intervene as of right. The Applicant
has not demonstrated a protect-able interest relating to the legality of the Defendant's actions
under NEPA or any other law, and that the Federal Defendants cannot or will not adequately
represent the Applicants' interests.

A. Applicant's Interests are Fabricated and Exaggerated

Applicants' have fabricated and exaggerated their claims to the point that it is difficult to
separate their actual protect-able interests from their blatant misinformation campaigns.
Applicants state in their motion to intervene that the withdrawal was to prevent the impacts of
unrestrained uranium exploration and mine development and that the relief that Plaintiff seeks
would lead to unlimited staking of new claims.

Uranium exploration and mining is hardly unrestrained. Exploration beyond casual use
requires a Plan of Operation and exploration drilling requires an Environmental Assessment (EA)
or an EIS. Approval of a Mining Plan of Operation would require an individual EIS for a specific
project given today's circumstances. There are a host of State and Federal requirements and
permits to meet and acquire. This is hardly unrestrained development. After the Arizona
wilderness Act of 1984 was passed, mining claims for uranium peaked at about 27,000 in
number. As of 2009, there were just over 10,000 mining claims located within the three

segregation parcels. Currently there are about 3,000 mining claims. Compared to the activities
that existed when the lands defined in the NAPW area were first being explored, current activity
is downright sedate. Applicants claim that there will be massive claim staking is a fabrication.
Massive claim staking would only enlarge the coffers of the BLM, as only a very few claims
would ever be explored beyond geochemical and geophysical means. Mining claims do not equal
exploration disturbance or operating mines.

Applicants claim their interests may be impaired given the well-documented and
damaging impacts of uranium mining. This is false for breccia pipe uranium mining. Implying
that uranium mining issues in other areas or regions outside the NAPW area are relevant to
breccia pipe mining is deceitful and calls their claim for impairment of their interests into
question. The NAPW EIS does not support a claim that past mining in accordance with current
laws, regulations, and reclamation requirements poses more than a negligible environmental
affect.

Applicants use words like threaten, create a risk, potentially, could have the potential to
cause, etc., to describe the impairments of their interests. This word usage indicates that "fear of
risk" from uranium exploration and mining is the impairment of their interests. However, fear of
the supposed risk does not equate to there actually being a substantial risk. Applicants use these
words to exaggerate their supposed interests.

Applicants at page 4 of their memorandum in support of motion to intervene state that
"Uranium mining also threatens to transform portions of the region`s wild landscapes into
industrial zones with webs of roads and power lines, mine facilities and drill rigs, and hundreds
of thousands of truck trips. Such development would fragment and disturb habitat and sensitive

areas, including nesting areas for the endangered California condor, calving and fawning grounds
for mule deer, elk, and antelope, and critical big-game winter range. See FEIS at 4-140 - 4-144.
Noise, pollution, visual disturbance, and roads would also diminish the area`s high degree of
naturalness and outstanding opportunities for solitude and primitive forms of recreation. See id.
at 4-227 - 4-236. These impacts make it difficult for the lands to be protected by Congress as
wilderness (emphasis added). Past and renewed uranium mining already has impacted long-time
visitors to the region by disturbing the area`s uncommon natural beauty and solitude. See, e.g.,
Clark Decl. 4] 20- 28; McKinnon Decl. {ff 11-12, 17.

The NAPW EIS found the above described impacts to the lands in the NAPW to be
minimal. Characterizing the use of 1300 acres of land spread out over 20 years and 1 million
acres of land as an industrial zone is taking hyperbole a bit far into the realm of deceit. The lands
in question are multiple use lands, meaning many different uses and that users must share use of
the land. These lands are not managed for solitude. Wilderness areas are. The Applicants claim
that the supposed impacts would " make it difficult for the lands to be protected by Congress as
wilderness." Except, Congress has already specified these land to be multiple use and open to
mineral entry (uranium mining) by passing the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984. To suggest or
imply that there is support for overturning this Act in Congress is deceitful.

Applicants at page 6 of their memorandum in support of motion to intervene state "With
the Proposed Intervenors` support, in March 2008 Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva
introduced legislation to permanently withdraw over one million acres surrounding the Park from|
new mining claims...... The lands proposed for protection in Rep. Grijalva`s bill are the very
same lands DOI ultimately withdrew in January 2012." Continuing on page 7 "In the context of

this political and legal pressure, DOI changed course.....In July 2009, DOI announced a proposal
to withdraw the one million acres identified in Rep. Grijalva`s legislation from mineral entry for
20 years....."

The DOI changed course because the Obama Presidency started in January of 2009 and a
new Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, was chosen to lead the DOI. The course change was a
political one, and the new Secretary, at the urging of Rep. Grijalva and the Applicants, initiated a
two year segregation of the NAPWA so that Defendant could make a subsequent withdrawal of
these lands from the Mining Law. The Applicants have worked hand in glove, ying and yang,
with the Defendant to ensure that these lands were indeed withdrawn.

The Applicants' fabricated and exaggerated claims make it difficult to separate their
actual protect-able interests from their overblown rhetoric, however the issue at hand is not
whether Movant Intervenors have an interest in the NAPW area lands for their environmental
and cultural resource interests, but whether their interests are "significantly protect-able
interests." Movant Intervenor's environmental and cultural interests have nothing to do with
whether the NAW was legal, which is the sole and only issue to be decided by the Court.

Movant Intervenors use Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg to support the
proposition that courts "construe Rule 24(a) liberally in favor of potential intervenors" and
decision are based "primarily on practical considerations." 268 F.3d 810, 818 (9th Cir. 2001).
Similar to Forest Conservation Council, movant intervenors were granted intervention of right
because they held contracts and owned projects affected by the decision. In this case, the
Applicant Contractors were allowed intervention, because the City could not be expected to
adequately represent and safeguard the Applicant Contractors contractual rights. Here, Movant

Intervenors hold no such contractual rights or property rights, and once again, Movant
Intervenors environmental and cultural resource protection interests do not add to whether the
DOI properly followed NEPA.

B. Movant Intervenors Interest are Adequately Represented

Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) requires "(1) the motion must be timely; (2) the applicant must
claim a `significantly protectable' interest relating to the property or transaction which is the
subject of the action; (3) the applicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may
as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant's
interest must be inadequately represented by the parties to the action." Wilderness Society v.
U.S. Forest Service, 630 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 2011). Movant Intervenors do not have a
significantly protect-able interest, and if a significantly protect-able interest is found, Movant
Intervenors fail to demonstrate that their interests are inadequately represented by the
Defendants.

Movant Intervenors' claim Defendants will not adequately represent their "focused
interests on environmental and cultural resource protection," because Defendants are "required
to represent a broader view than the more narrow, parochial interests' of the applicant
organizations and their members." Memo. in Supp. of Mot. of Grand Canyon Trust et al. to
Intervene as Defendants, Docket 15, at 15, March 12, 2012. Movant Intervenor's state, "the
Proposed Intervenors' interests focus more narrowly on environmental and cultural resource
protection of the Grand Canyon region," rather than the broad multiple use mandate Defendants

are bound by in FLPMA. Jd.
