Case No. 3:11-cv-08171-PCT-FJM

MOTION OF
GRAND CANYON TRUST
ET AL. TO INTERVENE AS
DEFENDANTS
(MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
FILED CONCURRENTLY)

Case 3:11-cv-08171-DGC Document 14 Filed 03/12/12 Page 2 of 4

1

Grand Canyon Trust, the Havasupai Tribe, Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra

2

Club, and National Parks Conservation Association (collectively, “Proposed

3

Intervenors”) hereby move for leave to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to Federal

4

Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), and permissively pursuant to Rule 24(b).

5

As explained more fully in the memorandum in support of this motion, filed

6

concurrently, the Proposed Intervenors meet the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ standard

7

for intervention as of right: (1) this application is timely; (2) the Proposed Intervenors

8

claim an interest relating to the property which is the subject of this action; (3) the

9

Proposed Intervenors’ interests may, as a practical matter, be impaired by this litigation;

10

and (4) the Proposed Intervenors’ interests are not adequately represented by the existing

11

parties. See Wilderness Soc’y v. U.S. Forest Serv., 630 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 2011)

12

(en banc); Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). The Proposed Intervenors also meet the tests for

13

permissive intervention.

14

A copy of Proposed Intervenors’ proposed answer is filed herewith, as required by

15

Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c). The proposed answer is attached to the memorandum in support of

16

this motion as Exhibit 16.

17

The Proposed Intervenors move to intervene to represent the interests of their

18

members, whose goals include protecting the natural, biological, and recreational

19

resources of one million acres of largely public land adjacent to Grand Canyon National

20

Park from, among other things, the damaging impacts of unrestrained uranium mining.

21

These impacts are likely to occur if the Court grants the relief sought by the Plaintiff in

22

this case.

23

Counsel for the Proposed Intervenors contacted counsel for the Federal

24

Defendants and contacted the pro se plaintiff Mr. Yount to determine their position on

25

this motion. Federal Defendants will not oppose the motion; Mr. Yount intends to

26

oppose.
