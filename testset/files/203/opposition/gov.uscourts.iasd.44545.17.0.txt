PLAINTIFF PELLA CORPORATION’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT LIBERTY
MUTUAL INSURANCE’S MOTIONS (1) FOR STAY OF PROCEEDINGS AND (2) TO
EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR FILING RESPONSIVE PLEADINGS OR OTHER
PAPERS

Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (“Liberty”) has moved for a stay of this
litigation pending a decision on the appeals (the “Pella I Appeals”) that the parties have taken
from certain of the Court’s rulings in Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Pella Corp. and Pella
Windows and Doors, Inc., Case No. 07-cv-00508-JEG-CFB. On August 18, 2011, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued its decision on the Pella I Appeals.
Accordingly, Liberty’s motion for a stay of this matter is now moot.
In a separate motion, Liberty requested twenty-one (21) days to file responsive pleadings
in this case running from either (i) “the date the stay of proceedings is lifted” or (ii) “the date the
stay of proceedings is denied.” Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company’s Motion to
Extend the Due Date for Filing Responsive Papers or Other Pleadings at 2-3. Plaintiff has no
