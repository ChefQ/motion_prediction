Case No: 4:11-cv-00273-JAJ-RAW
DEFENDANT LIBERTY MUTUAL
INSURANCE COMPANY’S
CONTESTED MOTION TO EXTEND
THE DUE DATE FOR FILING
RESPONSIVE PLEADINGS OR
OTHER PAPERS

_______________________________________________________________________
Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 7 and LR 7, Defendant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
(“Liberty Mutual”), hereby moves to extend the due date for its responsive pleadings or other
papers, stating as follows:
1.

Pella Corporation filed its complaint (“Pella’s complaint”) in this action on June

7, 2011.
2.

On June 20, 2011, Liberty Mutual filed an Agreed Motion for Extension of Time

for Defendant to Move or Plead in Response to Plaintiff’s Complaint (Doc. # 2), which requested
a thirty-day extension of time until August 5, 2011 for Liberty Mutual to move or plead in
response to Pella’s complaint.
3.

The Court granted Liberty Mutual’s Agreed Motion for Extension of Time on

June 21, 2011 (Doc. # 3).
4.

Liberty Mutual is contemporaneously filing a Motion for Stay of Proceedings,

which requests this Court to stay this action until the Eighth Circuit issues its decision in the case
captioned Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Pella Corp. and Pella Windows and Doors, Inc., Case

Case 4:11-cv-00273-JEG -CFB Document 14

Filed 08/05/11 Page 2 of 4

No. 07-cv-00508 (“Pella I”). Pella I was argued before the Eighth Circuit on February 15, 2011,
and a decision by the Eighth Circuit is expected in the near future.
5.

The filing of a motion to stay proceedings alone does not automatically allow the

moving party to defer the filing of responsive pleadings. However, given the issues before the
Eighth Circuit that will no doubt impact how the instant action is framed, until the Eighth Circuit
renders a decision in Pella I, Liberty Mutual will be prejudiced by having to file its responsive
pleadings or papers in this action at this time.
6.

Specifically, Liberty Mutual will be prejudiced because the Eighth Circuit ruling

in Pella I directly affects how Liberty Mutual may answer the complaint here, which affirmative
defenses Liberty Mutual may plead in response to Pella’s complaint, whether Liberty Mutual
will file any compulsory counterclaims and/or whether Liberty Mutual will move to dismiss this
action. Without the benefit of the Eighth Circuit’s decision in Pella I, Liberty Mutual does not
currently possess the information it needs in order to appropriately respond to this complaint.
7.

Furthermore, judicial economy is best served by extending the due date of Liberty

Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers until Pella I is decided so that the Court and parties will
not be required to review and respond to filings that may be rendered moot by or be amended
based upon the Eighth Circuit’s ruling in Pella I.
8.

Liberty Mutual therefore respectfully requests that the Court stay the due date of

Liberty Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers as follows:
a.

Stay the due date of Liberty Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers until
the Court decides Liberty Mutual’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings; and

b.

If the Court grants Liberty Mutual’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings, stay
the due date of Liberty Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers until
twenty-one (21) days from the date the stay of proceedings is lifted; or

If the Court denies Liberty Mutual’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings, stay
the due date of Liberty Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers until
twenty-one (21) days from the date the stay of proceedings is denied.

Alternatively, if the Court denies this motion, Liberty Mutual requests that the

Court enter an Order which states that Liberty Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers are not
deemed late and that Liberty Mutual will have twenty-one (21) days from the date this motion is
denied to file its responsive pleadings or papers.
10.

Counsel for Liberty Mutual sought concurrence in this motion from counsel for

Pella, which was denied.
WHEREFORE, Liberty Mutual respectfully requests that this Court stay the due date for
Liberty Mutual’s responsive pleadings or papers as set forth herein.
