O'NEILL AND CAROLINA ACQUISITION LLC'S RESPONSE IN
OPPOSITION TO AIG'S MOTION TO STRIKE AND/OR LIMIT
REPORT, REBUTTAL REPORT AND TESTIMONY OF DEFENSE
EXPERT DAVID PEDRICK

 

Defendants, J. Brian O'Neill and Carolina Acquisition LLC ("O'Neill'"), pursuant to S,
D, Fla. L.R. 7.1 submit the following response in opposition to the Motion of Plaintiff, AIG
Centennial Insurance Company ("AIG") to Strike and/or Limit Report, Rebuttal Report and
Testimony of Defense Expert David Pedrick:

I. INTRODUCTION

On December 23, 2010 this Court denied AIG's Motion to Amend its Answers and
Affirmative Defenses, [D.E. 139]. This Court rejected AIG's newfound affirmative defenses
including, (among others), that "O'Neill and Carolina are judicially estopped from denying that
the M/Y Bryemere's loss is attributable to an inherent lack of structural integrity in the
construction of the vessel; and that O'Neill and Carolina are judicially estopped from denying

that M/Y Bryemere's loss is attributable to unseaworthiness" as untimely pled. - [Id].

CASE NO.: 09-60551 CIV-ZLOCH

Dissatisfied, AIG re-asserts its judicial estoppel arguments through a motion to strike/and or
limit testimony, as well as prematurely challenging and seeking to impeach the credibility (albeit
with great futility) of AIG's former expert. The grounds for relief asserted in AIG's motion bear
a marked similarity to the grounds asserted in its previous motion to amend. Consistent with its
prior ruling, the Court should deny AIG's motion entirely. [D.E. 139]. Alternatively, even if the
Court were to consider the subject matter of AIG's motion, this Court should find that AIG's
motion is groundless.
I. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES

A, AIG Grossly Mischaracterizes David Pedrick's Expert Testimony in the
HMY Case and in this Case, '

Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked at the court's discretion. New
Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001). The doctrine is designed to prevent parties
from making a mockery of justice by inconsistent pleadings. American Nat'l Bank of
Jacksonville y. Federal Dep. Ins. Corp. 710 F.2d 1528, 1536 (11th Cir. 1983) (internal citation
omitted). The factors that inform application of the doctrine include (1) "whether the present
position is `clearly inconsistent' with the earlier position; (2) whether the party succeeded in
persuading a tribunal to accept the earlier position, so that the judicial acceptance of the
inconsistent position in a later proceeding creates the perception that either court was misled; and
(3) whether the party advancing the inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage on

the opposing party." New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750-751.

 

' AIG's argument that David Pedrick's deposition testimony in the present action
conflicts with his prior testimony in the HMY case was also raised in its Motion for Summary
Judgment against Bank of America [D.E. 112] and in its Motion to Strike or Dismiss for Fraud
on the Court [D.E. 146]. Accordingly, as AIG's arguments overlap O'Neill incorporates by
reference Defendants' Omnibus Response to AIG's Motion for Summary Judgment, and
O'Neill's Response to AIG's Motion to Strike and/or Dismiss for Fraud on the Court.

CASE NO,,; 09-60551 CIV-ZLOCH

AIG cannot satisfy the first element. AIG's cutting, pasting, and juxtaposing of various
excerpts of Pedrick's expert testimony rendered in Carolina Acquisition, LLC v. HMY Yacht
Sales Inc, et al. Case no. 07-61738-CIV-Zloch (the "HMY case") and during his December 8,
2010 expert witness deposition in this case, followed by significantly mischaracterized
representations of this testimony in no way -establishes inconsistency. Rather, Pedrick's
testimony, augmented by additional information as applied to disparate issues proves the
opposite.

i. Pedrick's Testimony in the HMY Case And In the Present Action Are
Consistent

AIG claims that Pedrick testified in the HMY case that al] defects and damages found in
Bryemere existed prior to April 2007 and in this case reversed his opinion, concluding that all
damages and defects suddenly occurred on July 2, 2007 during the vessel's delivery voyage from

Florida to Rhode Island. This is simply untrue." The sum and substance of Pedrick's testimony

 

throughout the scope of his retention in both cases has been and continues to be that latent
defects discovered on Bryemere, (particularly, hull thinness and length of outboard girders)
existed since the vessel's construction, [see generally, D.E. 140-3, 114-8, 153-1, D.E. 114-7]; the
thinness of Bryemere's hull bottom provided inadequate support to the vessel's hull bottom [D.E.
140-3]; while the vessel was in operation, the insufficiently supported hull bottom gradually
fatigued and weakened over a long period of time, David Pedrick HMY Case Trial Testimony,
April 15, 2010 pp. 29-14-22; p. 36:2-21; [153-1 6-12, 420]; cyclic and excessive
hydrodynamic loading bearing upon unusual stress points in the hull bottom caused gradual

fatigue and weakening of Bryemere's inadequately supported hull bottom and topsides which,

 

* AIG both in questioning of witnesses and in its papers purposely confabulates defect
with resulting damage. The two are both legally and factually distinct as its own Policy
confirms.

CASE NO.: 09-60551 CIV-ZLOCH

when coupled with the shortness of the girders, eventually caused cracks, delamination, rupture
of the fuel tank brackets, and sudden catastrophic failure of the hull during the vessel's delivery
voyage from Florida to Rhode Island [D.E. 153-1 90x00A76-12]; (Pedrick Dep. 61:18-66:19, 198:5-16,
Dec. 8, 2010. )

The consistency in Pedrick's testimony is clear in the very excerpts AIG quotes. For
example, AIG cites the following testimony from the HMY case:

Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether this condition that you have now
described existed before April 2007 when Carolina Acquisition bought the
boat?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is your opinion?

A. Well, this something that happened over a period of time. And this is repetitive

type of phenomenon that brings this level of destruction. So, this is something
that had been going on for a period of time in the boat.

eR OF

Q. And the delamination, is this a problem?

A. Yes. The consequence of this is that what you have is a delaminated structure as
I was describing yesterday. It no longer works as an integral stiff unit, it works
as a series of flexible individual plies that aren't getting support from one
another. And it basically just means it is weaker, it will break more easily, And
in this case, as wave action, both directly applied from the outside of the boat and
also just the forces of this 50-ton boat has a lot of intertial forces within itself and
works on that. And once the peeling action starts, it's something that just keeps
spreading and getting worse and it can lead to a fracture or a rupture of the
topsides, and, again, exposes the boat to sinking and the consequences of that.

[David Pedrick HMY Case Trial Testimony, April 15, 2010 pp. 29-14-22; p. 36:2-21, D.E. 140
Ex. E]. [emphasis supplied] Pedrick testified that the damages witnessed in July 2007 by the
delivery crew and by him in September, 2007 must have "happened over a period of time." [Jd]

He specifically describes the delamination of the hull bottom as a "peeling action" that "just

Case 0:09-cv-60551-WJZ Document 174 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/24/2011 Page 5 of 22
CASE NO.: 09-60551 CIV-ZLOCH

keeps spreading and getting worse" over time caused by "wave action" and other "intertial
forces" applied from the outside and within the vessel -a process he estimates began "taking
place prior to April 2007." [Id.] He presages his testimony here by stating "and it can lead to a
fracture or rupture of the topsides," which is what happened after O'Neill purchased Bryemere.
During his expert deposition in this case, Pedrick's testimony focused more specifically on the
timing and structural point of catastrophic failure of the vessel's hull, stating:

. [Present action]

Q. Just for clarity, I'm talking about the delamination in the way of the master
stateroom port and starboard that we have been talking about. That was not a
sudden event was it?

MS. MOORE: Object to the form.
MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question

A. It appears that the catastrophic failure was a sudden event. There's no way of
knowing the degree to which there may or may not have been voids beforehand.
All we know is that it was -there was nothing that was observably wrong with
that skin through all the - through the [pre-purchase sea] trial, and that also
when the crew took the boat -again, I think L.J. said that they were all over it
looking at things. This passageway was the place where they were frequently
going in and out. So there was nothing happening in that area that caught
anybody's eye, including those who were looking for things.

ok Ok

Q. Can you tell me, is it your opinion as we sit here today, that the delamination in
the hull topsides of this vessel started, began after Mr. O'Neill purchased the
vessel?

MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question.

MS. MOORE: Same objection.

THE WITNESS: I can't say when the smallest sign of it would have started. What
I can say is it went from an unobserverable level, whatever amount of delamination
may or may not have been there, that it was not observable until there was
catastrophic failure en route.

97282, 1
Case 0:09-cv-60551-WJZ Document 174 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/24/2011 Page 6 of 22
CASE NO.: 09-60551 CIV-ZLOCH

Q. You used the term "catastrophic failure." What does that mean?
A. That means a rupture that causes substantial loss of structural integrity.

Q. So would it be accurate to say that the delamination had at that point advanced to
the point where it became substantial and observable?

MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question.

MS. MOORE: Object to the form

A: The delamination had reached a point where the inner skin had fractured away

from the core [over] such a large area that the sandwich panel was no longer acting

as a sandwich panel. It was acting as two independent skins. So that catastrophic

failure occurred when the two skins no longer could function effectively together.
(Pedrick Dep. 147:3-16; 196:15 - 197:7). Pedrick simply opined that the hydrodynamic loading
or "wave action" caused fatigue and gradual weakening of the vessel's hull bottom and topsides

and eventually resulted in its catastrophic failure -- meaning observable structural failure of the

hull bottom to the point where the inner skin had fractured away from the core over such a large

 

area that the sandwich panel was no longer acting as a sandwich panel. Jd.

When describing events causing the Bryemere's fuel tank brackets to fracture, Pedrick's
collective testimony reflects a similar process to that of the deterioration of the hull bottom-
namely, gradual fatigue followed by catastrophic release or failure. For instance, in both cases,
Pedrick confirms that the weakening of the fuel tank brackets occurred over a long period of
time:

[HMY case testimony]
Q. Now, looking at the bracket, you can't tell when exactly that fracture, that long

fracture that you described, and you drew a line down, you can't tell when that
occurred, can you?

A. Precisely, no, But over a period of - a long period of time, this was something that
would have taken many, many days and at least tens if not more than that of hours of
running. This was a very long term thing.

CASE NO.: 09-60551 CIV-ZLOCH

[Present Action]
Q. (BY MR. ANDERSON) Do you have any opinions as to whether the motion of
those tanks and flexibility of the bottom was something that had been going on for
some time?
A. I think that the magnitude of whatever was going on, that I believe these
retaining brackets were installed to cure, was something that evidently had been
going on during the prior ownership.
Q. (BY MR. ANDERSON) The type of problems that you're talking about here
that ultimately resulted in the damage to the girder and the fracture of the bracket,
those conditions are something that takes a long time to develop? ... .
THE WITNESS: In the particular matter of this boat and these brackets, there's
evidence that it was going on at least prior to the purchase by Mr. O'Neill. And by
what amount of time, I don't know
[Pedrick HMY Case Trial Testimony pp. 58:21 59:21, D.E 140 Ex. EJ; (Pedrick Dep. 73:19 -
74:21) (emphasis added). However, when estimating the point in time in which the catastrophic
failure of the fuel tank brackets occurred, Pedrick opined during his expert deposition:

Q. AsJ understand your testimony, it's your opinion at this point that the failure of the
forward brackets on either the port and starboard tanks occurred sometime after the
vessel left Florida?

MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question.
MS. MOORE: Join in the objection

A. The catastrophic failure of those brackets, I think without question, occurred just a
very short time before they were noticed aboard [in July 2007].

(Pedrick Dep., 12/18/10, 198:5-16.) Again, there is no inconsistency in Pedrick's testimony
concerning the structural failure of the Bryemere's fuel tank brackets, The aluminum brackets
welded to the sides of the fuel tanks on the Bryemere were attached to the outboard longitudinal
girders. (Pedrick Dep. 68: 15-18). These short outboard girders, coupled with Bryemere's thin

topsides, caused excessive cyclic hydrodynamic loads to be thrust on the fuel tanks, via the

97282 1
- Case 0:09-cv-60551-WJZ Document 174 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/24/2011 Page 8 of 22

CASE NOQ.: 09-6055 1 CIV-ZLOCH

 

outboard fuel tank brackets port and starboard. [D.E. 153-1 9]. "Over a long period of time" the
welds attaching the fuel tank brackets to the girders gradually weakened, and finally ruptured
suddenly during Bryemere's voyage to Rhode Island. [Pedrick HMY Case Trial Testimony pp.
58:21 59:21]; [D.E. 153-1 910]. The effect of their rupture was an immediate loss of structural
support in the Byremere's topsides with the force of hydrodynamic rotational deflections at the
chine increasingly substantially, which in turn caused substantial flexing and cracking in the hull
and significantly increased the rate of delamination. [D.E. 153-1 911-12]. Pedrick's testimony
in the HMY case and here contemplates a sequence of events explaining the process underlying
the progressive deterioration of the vessel's hull structure to the point a failure occurred causing
it to manifest. In no way does his prior testimony suggest that all delamination found in the hull
or the complete fracture of the fuel tank brackets existed prior to April 2007; that incipient
delamination and fracturing suddenly occurred in July 2007; or, that the defects causing the
damage did not pre-exist the April, 2007 purchase.

ii. AIG Mischaracterizes Pedrick's Testimony Concerning The Overall State of
Deterioration of the Bryemere.

AIG's interpretation of Pedrick's testimony concerning the overall state of deterioration
of the Bryemere set forth in the HMY case and in the present action is also inaccurate. AIG cites
the following testimony from the HMY case and expert witness deposition to show that
Pedrick's views concerning the state of deterioration of the vessel are inconsistent:

[HMY Case Testimony]

Q. Assume that the boat had not been pulled out of the water [once it reached
Rhode Island] and that the boat was actually being used going out 100 miles
offshore. Do you have an opinion as to what would have happened with the

"Double Billed"?

A. Well, this boat was in a state of deterioration that was pretty well advanced. And
the greatest risk that I see in it is the bottom panel, that is the watertight barrier

between there and the deep blue sea, is in the process of breaking. The cracks on
the outside. There where was the breaking away of his partial longitudinal girder
on the inside. There were things moving around the girder and the tanks were
moving around. There was a lot of force and flexion going on in that area.

* ok &
[This Case]

Q. Was BRYEMERE in a state of deterioration that was pretty well advanced at the
time she was purchased by Mr. O'Neill?

MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question. Asked and answered.
MS. MOORE: Same
THE WITNESS: It's been established by Mr. Price that was not the case.

Q. At the time BRYEMERE was purchased, did she pose a genuine risk of breaking
in the bottom and flooding and sinking at the time she was purchased?

MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question

 

MS. MOORE: Same objection
A. To the same way as I answered previously, there was no knowledge that there was
a condition posing unseaworthiness, but that in her original construction, she did have
these elements that were a disaster waiting to happen.
{Pedrick HMY Case Trial Testimony p. 38:19 - 39:6; D.E. 140 Ex. 3]; (Pedrick Dep. 206:1-20.)
Neither Pedrick's HMY case testimony nor his expert witness deposition testimony stand for the
proposition AlG proposes. Pedrick's testimony in the HMY case indicating that the state of
deterioration of the Bryemere was "pretty well advanced" as of September, 2007 when he saw

her in no way indicates that this state of deterioration existed since the time O'Neill purchased

the vessel in April 2007.0x00B0 Pedrick's expert witness deposition testimony merely conveys his

 

* To suggest otherwise is to infer that O'Neill voluntarily spent over two million dollars
purchasing a vessel, while noticing substantial flexing in the hull bottom with water-bed like
movement appearing in the starboard passageway: which none of the myriad people aboard
Bryemere prior to April, 2007 saw either.

acknowledgement that Tom Price and Bryemere's crew found the vessel to be structurally sound,
and therefore were unaware of the vessel's structural defects or state of deterioration until the
catastrophic failure occurred. Accordingly, Pedrick's testimony does not constitute a change of
opinion, and AIG's judicial estoppel claim must be denied.
B. Pedrick's Anticipated Expert Testimony Meets Daubert Requirements

The admissibility of expert testimony is `governed by Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 592 (1993) and Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides:

If scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact

to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as

an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify

thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon

sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and

methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to

the facts of the case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702. In Daubert, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 702 to require federal judges
to perform a "gatekeeper" role to ensure "that any and all scientific testimony or evidence
admitted is not only relevant but reliable." Daubert, 509 U.S, at 594-95. In the Eleventh Circuit,
the proponent of expert testimony must show that: (1) the expert is qualified to testify about the
matters he intends to address; (2) the methodology used by the expert to reach his conclusions is
sufficiently reliable; and (3) the expert's testimony will assist the trier of fact, through the
application of scientific, technical, or specialized expertise, to understand the evidence or
determine a fact in issue, See US. v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2004). AIG's

motion does not challenge Pedrick's expertise or qualifications, Instead, AIG claims Pedrick's

expert opinions are based on insufficient data and lack scientific foundation.
