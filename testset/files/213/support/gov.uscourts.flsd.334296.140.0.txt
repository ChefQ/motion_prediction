applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and files its Motion to Strike and/or Limit the
Report, Rebuttal Report and Testimony of Defense Expert David Pedrick on behalf. of
Defendants, J. Brian O'Neill and Carolina Acquisition LLC based upon (1) the doctrine of
judicial estoppel; and (2) the unreliability of certain opinions under the standards adopted in
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 (1993); Kumho Tire Co, v. Carmichael,
526 U.S. 137 (1999), and in support of thereof states as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

Defendants' expert David Pedrick has rendered written and verbal opinions in this case
which are, im every way, diametrically opposite to the opinions he rendered in sworn testimony
in a matter formerly pending before this Court: Carolina Acquisition, LLC v. HMY Yacht Sales,
Inc. et al, Case No. 07-61738-CIV-ZLOCH (hereinafter "HMY Litigation"). In the HMY
Litigation, Carolina Acquisitions LLC successfully sued the selling broker of BRYEMERE, then
known as DOUBLE BILLED, for negligently misrepresenting the condition of the vessel which
was found to have serious structural deficiencies.

In support of its position in the HMY Litigation, Carolina Acquisitions LLC presented
two (2) days of testimony from David Pedrick, a Naval Architect and Marine Engineer, who

identified the numerous structural deficiencies in the vessel and damage to the vessel these

deficiencies caused. Most importantly, Mr. Pedrick testified, at great length, that all of these
defects and damages existed prior to the purchase of the vessel in April 2007.

Now, Carolina Acquisitions LLC presents Mr. Pedrick as an expert witness in this case
and seeks to have Mr. Pedrick render opinions that all of the structural deficiencies were hidden,
could not have been detected by a reasonably careful and thorough inspection of the vessel and
that all of the damages caused by the deficiencies occurred after the purchase of the vessel and,
conveniently, during the policy period for the policy of marine insurance which is the subject of
this litigation. Such conduct by Carolina Acquisitions LLC and David Pedrick should not and
must not be tolerated by this Court.

Moreover, the factual and technical basis upon which Mr. Pedrick is offering his new
opinions and/or changes in his previous opinions lack a sufficient scientific basis under Daubert
and as such, his testimony must be stricken.

H. ARGUMENT

CENTENNIAL issued a policy of marine insurance for a vessel known as BRYEMERE
for a policy period beginning April 19, 2007 and continuing through April 19, 2008 at 12:01 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time (hereinafter the "Policy"). (Policy, Exhibit "A"; Declarations Page,
Exhibit "B"). The Policy provides insurance coverage for physical loss or damage to a yacht
owned by the named insured on the declarations page. (Policy, Ex. "A"). The Policy further
excludes coverage for manufacturing and latent defects, but does provide limited coverage for
damage caused by latent defects. /d. The Policy further requires that any physical loss or
damage giving rise to a claim under the Policy must occur during the Policy Period. Jd.

a, The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents Mr. Pedrick from changing his

testimony as to his expert opinions

Contrary to their position taken in the HMY Litigation, Defendants, J. Brian O' Neill and
Carolina Acquisition LLC, now contend that the brackets on the port (left) and starboard (right)
outboard (outer) sides of the port and starboard forward fuel tanks on BRYEMERE fractured in
July 2007 and the hull topsides delaminated (separation of inner fiberglass skin from foam core
material) in July 2007 sometime after Mr. O'Neill purchased the vessel through HMY. See
David Pedrick's December 5, 2010 report attached hereto as Exhibit "C". Defendants further
contend these damages were caused by hidden defects in the vessel for which the Policy provides

coverage. /d.

. CASE NO.: 09-6055 1-CIV-ZLOCH

Their sole support for these allegations is their expert Naval Architect and Marine
Engineer, David Pedrick. Mr. Pedrick was deposed on December 8, 2010. This Court heard
testimony from Mr. Pedrick in the HMY Litigation just eight (8) months ago - on April 14 and
15, 2010 - regarding the numerous structural deficiencies in the vessel and resulting damages.
Mr. Pedrick's testimony in this case and testimony in the HMY Litigation are completely at odds
and cannot be reconciled.

"[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in
maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed,
assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in
the position formerly taken by him." Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689 (1895). This rule,
known as judicial estoppel, "generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on
an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase." Pegram
v, Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 227, (2000); see also New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 744
(U.S. 2001).

In the HMY Litigation, J. Brian O'Neill and Carolina Acquisitions LLC used the
testimony of David Pedrick to establish that at the time Mr. O'Neill purchased the vessel, it was
in an advanced state of deterioration, unseaworthy, structurally unsound and had been damaged
as a result of that lack of structural integrity such that HMY knew or should have known of the
true condition of the vessel and negligently misrepresented the condition of the vessel to Mr.
O'Neill. In the instant case, J. Brian O'Neill and Carolina Acquisitions LLC are using the
testimony of the same witness, who has done no new investigation or analysis and discovered no
new facts, to establish there was no reason to believe there were any problems with the vessel
because a reasonably careful and thorough inspection would not have revealed the condition of
the vessel and the damage caused by the structural deficiencies all occurred after Mr. O'Neill
purchased the vessel. Their respective position in the two cases is the classic definition of trying
to have it both ways.

Here, the presentation of Mr. Pedrick as an expert witness in the HMY Litigation to
support the breadth of the defects and damages existing prior to Carolina's purchase of the
vessel and the presentation of Mr. Pedrick as an expert witness in this case to support the

allegation damages occurred after Carolina's purchase is simply untenable and quintessential

judicial estoppel. Mr. Pedrick's testimony cannot be relied upon under Daubert or any standard
and his testimony must be stricken accordingly.
In the HMY Litigation, Pedrick testified, without qualification, that the broken fuel tank

foundations occurred prior to April 2007 and not after April 2007:

Q: In your opinion, was the "Double Billed" seaworthy prior to April 2007?

A No.

Q: Why do you say that?

A

Well, these problems that I have been describing existed before. They
weren't sudden. It happened over a period of time. And the flexing had
spread cracks over a period of time. We found that the foundations,
aluminum foundations that hold the fuel tanks-the fuel tanks are welded
in aluminum boxes. They carry these tanks in the area of interest, vary
approximately 300 gallons of fuel which weighs more than a ton. So when
tanks are full, each of them has a ton of mass that's going up and down in
the boat. The foundations, the forward foundations on these tanks had
broken on both sides of the boat. So these were things that happened
over a long period of time. They weren't just in the relatively few
running hours that happened after April 2007.

HMY Trial Testimony of David Pedrick, April 14, 2010, pp. 46:15 - 47:8, Ex. "D" (emphasis
added).

Mr. Pedrick continued to discuss and describe the problems with the fractured fuel tank
brackets during his HMY Trial Testimony on April 15, 2010. In his testimony of April 15, 2010,
beginning at Page 27, Line 6 and continuing to Page 29, Line 13, Ex. "D", Mr. Pedrick uses a
photograph of a fractured fuel tank bracket to describe the fracture of the bracket and the
tremendous forces that caused tank movement and the fracture of the fuel tank brackets. He then
testifies:

Q: Do you have an opinion as to whether this condition that you have
now described existed before April 2007 when Carolina Acquisition
bought the boat?

A: Yes,

Q: And what is your opinion?

A: Well, this something that happened over a period of time. Any this is
repetitive type of phenomenon that brings this level of destruction. So, this
is something that had been going on for a period of time in the boat.

added).

CASE NO.: 09-6055 1-CIV-ZLOCH

In a continuing response to the question of whether the condition of the fractured fuel
tank brackets he described existed before April 2007, Mr. Pedrick then testifies, at length, from
Page 29, Line 22 of his HMY trial testimony to Page 31, Line 3, as to other observations he
made that indicated the problem with excessive tank movement had been going on for some
time. Mr. Pedrick then concludes his response to the question as to when the condition of the fuel
tank brackets he described existed by testifying:

So, this was really, this photograph is an example of part of what was going on.
There was other evidence in the boat of this movement that had been going on
for a significant length of time and that would have included prior to the sale.
HMY Trial Testimony of David Pedrick, April 15, 2010, pp. 31:6-9, Ex. "E" (emphasis added).
In the HMY Litigation, although Pedrick testified that the fracture had occurred before
April 2007, Pedrick also testified that he was unable to tell precisely when the fracture occurred
but that the fuel tank brackets fractured as a result of a long term condition in the vessel:

Q: Now, looking at that bracket, you can't tell when exactly
that fracture, that long fracture that you described, and you
drew a line down, you can't tell when that occurred, can
you?

A: Precisely, no. But over a period of-- a long period of time.
This was something that would have taken many, many
days and at least tens if not more than that of hours of
running. This was a very long term thing,

~ HMY Trial Testimony of David Pedrick, April 15, 2010, pp. 58:21 - 59:2, Ex. "E" (emphasis
added),

In the instant case, Pedrick has now stated on page three of his report of June 18, 2010
that, rather than something that was not sudden that he could not tell precisely when it occurred
other than it was before April 2007, the fuel tank brackets fracture was a "...sudden, catastrophic
fracture.." that occurred off Ocean City, Maryland in July 2007 and confirmed that changed
opinion in his deposition testimony:

A! The catastrophic failure of those brackets, I think without.
question, occurred just a very short time before they were
noticed aboard [in June 2007].

See June 18, 2010 report attached hereto as Exhibit "G"; Deposition Testimony of David
Pedrick, December 8, 2010, p. 198:13-17, Ex. "F".

In the HMY Litigation Pedrick also testified, at length, from Page 33, Line 18 to Page 36,
Line 1, regarding what delamination is and the process of the slow delamination of the inner skin
from the foam core material on the hull's topsides of BRYEMERE. He then testified:

Q: And the delamination, is this a problem?

A: Yes. The consequences of this is that what you have is a
delaminated structure, as I was describing yesterday. It no
longer works as an integral stiff unit, it works as a series of
flexible individual plies that aren't getting support from one
another, And it basically just means it is weaker, it will
break more easily. And in this case, as wave action, both
directly applied from the outside of the boat and also just
the forces of this 50-ton boat has a lot of intertial forces
within itself and works on that. And once the peeling
action starts, it's something that just keeps spreading
and getting worse and it can lead to a fracture or a
rupture of the topsides and, again, exposes the boat to
sinking and the consequences of that.

Q: And the condition that you have described and we see
on this photograph, as with the other defects and
deficiencies in the structure of the boat, is this also
something that had taken place prior to April 2007
when Carolina Acquisition bought the boat?

A: Yes.

Trial Testimony of David Pedrick, April 15, 2010, p. 36:2-21, Ex. "E" (emphasis added).

In his deposition on December 8, 2010, Mr. Pedrick reversed his sworn testimony at trial,
offering for the first time new opinions as to when and why the hull topsides delaminated. He
first testified, starting at Page 121, Line 13 , of his deposition:

....But what I think happened here, and it's certainly curious, that the
problems with the bottom became catastrophic at apparently the same time
as the problems that became apparent in the topsides. So because both of
them were deficient and that the catastrophic failure of both of them
occurred within such a narrow time frame, it seems me that there were
issues with the--probably the bottom framing first causing the tank
brackets to rupture. That once the tank brackets ruptured and that allowed
the bottom to flex more than it had ever been permitted before, that could
have been the trigger that then caused the topsides to let go.

Q: Is that something that you can state within a reasonable degree of
engineering probability or is that just sort of an untested theory?

MR DRURY: Objection to the form of the question.

CASE NO.: 09-6055 1-CIV-ZLOCH

A: That's my best estimate as an engineer trying to understand how these
occurrences happened to appear so close together.

Deposition Testimony of David Pedrick, December 8, 2010, p. 121:13-122:8, Ex. "F". He then
later stated that the delamination was a catastrophic and sudden event:

Q: Just for clarity, I'm talking the delamination in the way of
the master stateroom port and starboard that we have been
talking about. That was not a sudden event, was it?

MS. MOORE: Object to the form.
MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question.

A: It appears that the catastrophic failure was a sudden
event. There's no way of knowing the degree to which
there may or may not have been voids beforehand.

Deposition Testimony of David Pedrick, December 8, 2010, p. 146:21-147:6, Ex. "FP",

Pedrick's reversal of opinions continues and extends beyond just the damages Carolina
and O' Neill seek in this litigation. In the HMY Litigation Pedrick testified before this very Court
as to the advanced state of deterioration the vessel was in:

Q: Assume that the boat had not been pulled out of water and
that the boat was actually being used going out 100 miles
offshore. Do you have an opinion as to what would have
happened with the "Double Billed"?

AD Well, this boat was in a state of deterioration that was
pretty well advanced. And the greatest risk that I see in it
is the bottom panel, that is the watertight barrier between
there and the deep blue sea, is in the process of breaking.
The cracks on the outside. There where was the breaking
away of this partial longitudinal girder on the inside.
There were things moving around the girder and the
tanks were moving around. There was a lot of force and
flexion going on in that area.

Trial Testimony of David Pedrick, April 15, 2010, p. 38:19 - 39:6; 40:14-41:7, Ex. "E"
(emphasis added).

In deposition he states just the opposite:

CASE NO.: 09-60551-CIV-ZLOCH

Q: Was BRYEMERE in a state of deterioration that was pretty
well advanced at the time she was purchased by Mr.
O'Neill?

MR. DRURY: Object to the form of the question. Asked
and answered.

MS. MOORE: Same.

THE WITNESS: It's been established by Mr. Price that that was
not the case.
Deposition Testimony of David Pedrick, December 8, 2010, p. 206:1-8, Ex. "F".

Mr. Pedrick has clearly reversed his prior testimony in deposition and wil! perjure
himself should he testify as set forth in his reports and depositions given in this case. Carolina's
presentation of him as an expert in the HMY litigation and in this case on the same issue but with
different opinions rises to the level of a fraud on this Court. Such conduct cannot be tolerated
and Mr. Pedrick's testimony must be stricken.

b. Mr. Pedrick's testimony also fails to meet Daubert requirements

In a complete about-face from the position he advocated in the HMY litigation prosecuted
successfully by Defendant Carolina against, infer alia, the yacht broker who sold the boat, David
Pedrick now proposes to opine that no one, presumably including HMY, had any reason to think
BRYEMERE was not structurally sound and seaworthy until the alleged catastrophic failures of
the tank brackets and hull topsides during the first voyage under Carolina's ownership,
somewhere in the vicinity of Ocean City, Maryland. Mr. Pedrick now is of the opinion that not
only did the tank bracket failure and hull topside delamination occur after April 2007 but that a
reasonably careful and thorough inspection of the yacht prior to Carolina's purchase would not
have revealed any reason to be concerned about the seaworthiness or structural integrity of W/Y
BRYEMERE. (Deposition Testimony of David Pedrick, December 8, 2010, p. 65:21-p. 67:1, Ex.
"F"),

Significantly, Mr. Pedrick did not offer any new facts or any new research, new
engineering studies, new analysis, new investigation that he has undertaken between his
testimony in the HMY trial and his deposition to provide any explanation or justification for his
radical changes in opinion. Indeed, the entire basis for his new opinions rests completely on

information that he knew at the time he testified to the contrary in the HMY Litigation.

CASE NO.: 09-60551-CIV-ZLOCH

Mr. Pedrick's departure from his opinions in the HMY Litigation begins with his June 18,
2010 Report of Principal Observations, Analysis and Repair Processes. (Please find attached a
copy of Defendants' expert disclosure document and Mr. Pedrick's report attached hereto as Ex.
"G'). On Page sixteen of his report Mr. Pedrick states, in part (emphasis supplied):

General Conclusions

The motor yacht "Bryemere" appeared to be a sound and
satisfactory sportfishing yacht as of the time of purchase by Mr.
O'Neill in March 2007. It was not until the vessel made its open-
ocean delivery voyage from Florida to Rhode Island ~ a distance
of more than 1000 nautical miles - that sudden, catastrophic
damage occurred, revealing numerous flaws in the materials of
the vessel's construction. "Bryemere" had substantial defects that
could not have been reasonably foreseen by normal means of
observation, even by experienced marine professionals. ...

In my opinion as an experienced naval architect and marine
engineer of recreational marine craft, the motor yacht "Bryemere"
had unforeseen and unforeseeable defects that revealed themselves
only by the occurrence of catastrophic structural failure when
under way in the open ocean. Only then was it apparent that the
vessel lacked structural seaworthiness and should be condemned
from use until damaged areas are repaired corrective measures are
incorporated.

On December 8, 2010, his most recent deposition in this case, Mr. Pedrick for the first
time, revealed a truly remarkable basis for his new conclusion that M/yen BRYEMERE had
undergone a sudden, catastrophic failure of her fuel tank brackets apparently near Ocean City,
Maryland. Although his report attributes the information to the Captain, in his deposition, his
source becomes L.J. Gallagher who, in reporting his observation of the yacht's fuel tanks'
movement two months after the voyage, displayed an "emotional seriousness".

Q. (BY MR. ANDERSON) Let me get this straight. Did you or
did you not just say that there was a catastrophic failure of
those brackets sometime just prior to somebody noticing the
tank movement?

A. That's what I said.

Q. Okay. So tell me what the factual basis of that opinion is.

A. The factual basis of the opinion was the description that I was
given when I was called in on the project back in September,
early September of 2007 ... and I was asking questions about

what happened here, principally L.J. Gallagher described the
failure at the time.
Q. And tell me what Mr. Gallagher described to you as
specifically as you can recall.
A. That they were running the boat up in the vicinity of Ocean
City, Maryland, and that very suddenly there was -- that the
tanks and he -- as [ recall and what he was telling me at the
time, were that the tanks were moving violently, and that the
topsides inner skin was -- what they could see was panting
inboard.
Now, you used the term "violently." Is that this his word or is
that your word?
That is my word, recalling the emotional seriousness that he
had at the time.
Emotional seriousness?
MR. DRURY: Objection no question pending.
This was a pretty disturbing situation to be on a boat where
that was happening. So, yes, he had been deeply concerned,
let me say, he and his shipmates, when that happened. ... So it
was my understanding from the way the situation was
described to me, that this was a very sudden and very
disturbing experience for them.

Deposition Testimony of David Pedrick, December 8, 2010, p. 199:6-p. 200:24, Ex. "F".

Q: And youre basing this opinion as to whether this
catastrophic failure occurred on the emotional intensity
with which L. J. Gallagher described the experience?

MS MOORE: Objection to the form.
MR. DRURY: Objection to the form.

A: No. That's not what I'm basing it on. I'm basing it on his --
the facts that he stated to me, and they were stated with a
level of obvious distress experiencing it.

Q. Again, tell me what those facts are, because I'm still trying
to get them.

A, The facts are ---

Q. The facts.

A. The facts that he described to me, were that they were near
Ocean City, Maryland, and there was something going on
below that drew their attention, and then they were alarmed
by a sense that - the tanks moving and the topsides inner
skin being visibly
panting inboard.
