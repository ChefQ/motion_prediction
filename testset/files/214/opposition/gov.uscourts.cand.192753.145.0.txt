Confronted with an incontestable motion asserting that the collective action and class
claims in Plaintiffs Fourth Cause of Action are issue precluded, Plaintiffs seek to avoid or delay a
ruling on that motion by asking the Court to take off calendar Defendant s pending Motion for
Partial Summary Judgment (Fourth Cause of Action

Collective Action and Class Claims)

1 ( Defendant s Motion ) set for hearing on October 3, 2008 at 9:00 a.m. Alternatively, Plaintiffs
2 seek to postpone the hearing date and briefing on Defendant s Motion until after the Court issues a
3 ruling regarding Plaintiffs pending Motion to Sever and Transfer the Claims of Plaintiff Smith to
4 the District of Oregon.

However, the Court should consider all of the pending motions concurrently, as detailed in

6 Defendant s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for Partial Summary
7 Judgment (Fourth Cause of Action

Collective Action and Class Claims), Dckt. 133

8 ( Defendant s Memorandum ). Deferring consideration of Defendant s Motion would further
9 reward Plaintiffs forum shopping. In the February 13, 2008, Stay Order, this Court recognized

DAVIS WRIGHT TREMAINE LLP

10 that Plaintiffs were forum shopping. See Stay Order, Dckt. 73. ( Defendant argues vehemently
11 that plaintiffs are engaged in forum shopping by pursuing this action, and all indications are that
12 this is true ).
13

Plaintiffs mistakenly assert that the Court should defer or avoid addressing Defendant s

14 Motion because issue preclusion is a complicated question that will occupy considerable Court
15 time. On the contrary, issue preclusion here is uncomplicated and indisputable. As set forth in
16 Defendant s Memorandum, the Sales and Service Manager ( SSM ) misclassification
17 collective/class action asserted in the Second Amended Complaint is the exact collective claim
18 fully litigated and rejected by the Oregon District Court in McElmurry and Mrazek v. U.S. Bank
19 National Association, Case No. 04-CV-00642. Plaintiff s Administrative Motion does not
20 contend otherwise. Plaintiffs are plainly issue precluded from bringing a class claim that has
21 already been rejected, and there is no justification to delay that determination or have the issue
22 decided in Oregon. Plaintiffs acknowledge in their Second Amended Complaint, Â¶ 46(A) that,
23
24

The forum is convenient to the parties, class members, and potential witnesses.
Granting Defendant s Motion and dismissing the collective action and class claims in the

25 Fourth Cause of Action is not only consistent with this Court s jurisdiction, but will also exclude
26 from the case issues not properly before any court because they are precluded. In addition, a
27 ruling on the motion will inform the Court s decision regarding the propriety of transfer, not
28

supplant it.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs administrative motion to take off calendar or, in the alternative, to

2 continue the hearing date of Defendant s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Fourth Cause of
3 Action

Collective Action and Class Claims) should be denied.
