Summary Judgment Re: Claim Four from the Court’s calendar and postpone briefing on Defendant’s

2

motion pending a decision on Plaintiff’s Motion to Sever and Transfer Plaintiff Kelly’s Claim or,

3

alternatively, to postpone the hearing date and briefing until after a decision on the motion to sever and

4

transfer. Plaintiff requests that if the Court grants a continuance of the hearing date, that the date be

5

determined at the Case Management Conference scheduled for October 3, 2008.

I.

PLAINTIFF’S REASONS FOR THE CONTINUANCE
Plaintiffs have motions pending before this Court for hearing on October 3, 2008. These

8

motions seek to sever and transfer the cases for Dennis Ramos and Kelly Smith. Defendant seeks

9

partial summary judgment against Plaintiff Smith’s collective and class claims. Defendant has set that

10

motion to also be heard on October 3, 2008.

11

Defendant asks for judgment on Smith’s class and collective claims based on the Oregon

12

District Court’s decision in McElmurry and Mrazek v. US Bank National Association, No. 04-642-HA

13

(2008). Whether the Court should apply issue preclusion in this case is a complicated question that

14

will occupy considerable Court time. To maximize judicial efficiency, Defendant’s motion should be

15

heard by the same Court that hears Smith’s case. It is unhelpful to bifurcate Plaintiff Smith’s case.

16

This Court should first decide whether to sever and transfer the case and allow the motion to be heard

17

by the U.S. District Court of Oregon if this Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Sever and Transfer.

II.

19

PLAINTIFF’S EFFORTS TO OBTAIN STIPULATION
On September 2, 2008, Plaintiff’s counsel, Jose Mata, contacted Defendant’s counsel, Judith

20

Droz Keyes, by email and asked her to stipulate to this motion. On September 3, 2008, Ms. Keyes

21

responded that Defendant would not stipulate to this motion because Defendant believes that the Court

22

should not grant Plaintiff’s Motion to Sever and Transfer and that – in any event – the Court should

23

hear Defendant’s summary judgment motion first.

24

III.

25

SUBSTANTIAL HARM OR PREJUDICE
If the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Sever and Transfer, Defendant’s motion for summary

26

judgment can be dealt with most efficiently by the Oregon District Court.

SCHEDULE OF CASE

2

This is the first setting for Defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment. The effect of

3
4

modifying the schedule will be that whichever District Court hears the case will also hear the motion.
For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the hearing date of Defendant’s

5

Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Re: Claim Four be removed from the Court’s calendar or be

6

continued.
