UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

In re: Bank of America Home Affordable
Modification Program (HAMP) Contract
Litigation

Civil Action No. 1:10-md-02193-RWZ

DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE
ORDER REGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) and the Stipulated Protective Order
(“Protective Order”) [Dkt. No. 56] entered in this case on May 16, 2011, defendant Bank of
America, N.A. (“BANA”), for itself and as successor by merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing,
LP, hereby respectfully moves the Court for a further protective order affirming its designation
of portions of the deposition testimony of BANA employees Tawnya Schoolitz and Jinja Martin,
and Urban Lending Solutions (“Urban”) employee Christopher Orris as confidential (the
“Designated Testimony”).1 The Designated Testimony contains confidential commercial
information of BANA and Urban, and its public disclosure would subject BANA to annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.
In support of this Motion, BANA relies on its contemporaneously submitted
Memorandum in support, as well as the Declarations of Seth M. Goldstein, Mark L. McElroy,
and Carole Richter, and the supporting exhibits thereto (to be filed under seal). Defendant
further states that the parties have attempted to resolve the dispute over the Designated
Testimony in accordance with the Protective Order and Local Rule 7.1, but were unable to reach
an agreement.

The specific portions of each deposition transcript designated as confidential are listed in Exhibit A to BANA’s
Memorandum in Support of Its Motion For a Protective Order Regarding Confidential Information.
