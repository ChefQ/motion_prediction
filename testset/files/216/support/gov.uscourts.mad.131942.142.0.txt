Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 4 of 16

In this and virtually every civil case involving a commercial enterprise, the Court enters a
Protective Order early in the litigation so that the parties may freely engage in discovery related
to confidential and proprietary business information without risk of public disclosure of such
information until it passes the Court’s standards of relevance and admissibility at the time of
trial. In re San Juan Star Co., 662 F.2d 108, 114-15 (1st Cir. 1984). The Court entered such an
Order here. Stipulated Protective Order (“Protective Order”) [Dkt. No. 56]. Bank of America
(“BANA”) seeks the Court’s assistance to prevent Plaintiffs’ attempts to turn the very purpose of
the Protective Order on its head.
Most blatantly, Plaintiffs seek to lift BANA’s confidentiality designations related to the
testimony of an employee of Urban Lending Solutions (“Urban”), a third-party vendor that
performs services for BANA. Urban provides those services under a strict confidentiality
agreement. Urban’s employee, in turn, is bound by his own confidentiality agreement with
Urban to keep his work for Urban, and therefore BANA, confidential. Plaintiffs compelled the
testimony of Urban’s employee under Rule 45. Plaintiffs now seek to abuse the subpoena power
of Rule 45 by making public the compelled testimony of Urban’s employee despite his
obligation to Urban, Urban’s to BANA and BANA’s designation of such testimony under the
Protective Order. To stop Plaintiffs’ transparent effort to subject BANA and Urban to
competitive harm and embarrassment, BANA seeks a further protective order to keep from
public disclosure the portions of the transcripts of the depositions of Urban employee
Christopher Orris, as well as BANA employees Tawnya Schoolitz and Jinja Martin.1
Because the designated testimony contains confidential commercial information of
BANA and Urban, public disclosure of which would subject BANA and Urban to competitive
1

The portions of each transcript that BANA has designated as confidential and that Plaintiffs challenge are listed in
Exhibit A, attached hereto.

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 5 of 16

harm and embarrassment, and BANA reasonably relied on the Protective Order when it provided
the relevant testimony or did not move to quash the subpoena seeking the testimony, the Court
should grant the Motion.
BACKGROUND
In April 2009, BANA agreed to participate in the Home Affordable Modification
Program (“HAMP”), a nationwide loan modification program for eligible customers and
participating investors. Plaintiffs’ primary claim here alleges that BANA failed to provide
permanent loan modifications to borrowers under a breach of contract theory based on the
existence of Trial Period Plans under HAMP. See Third Amended Consolidated Class Action
Complaint [Dkt. No 93], at ¶¶ 126-33, 528-44. Plaintiffs also allege generally that BANA failed
to administer HAMP properly, including aspects of HAMP with respect to which BANA
employed the services of third-party vendors, including Urban. Id. passim.
Given Plaintiffs’ allegations, it has been obvious from the start of this litigation that there
would be discovery of BANA’s confidential commercial information. BANA, recognizing that
it would be required to give Plaintiffs at least some access to this information to afford them a
full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims, took steps to protect against public disclosure of
this information. It secured Plaintiffs’ agreement to, and the Court entered, the Protective Order,
which permits BANA to designate information as Confidential and restricts disclosure of such
designated information to specified groups of people that are personally involved in the
litigation. With such protections in place, BANA has been willing to produce certain
information that it would otherwise not have been willing to produce and refrained from taking
steps to prevent certain discovery that it would otherwise have taken, thereby encouraging the
just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of the matter.

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 6 of 16

Plaintiffs deposed Schoolitz, Martin, and Orris2 on May 9, 2012, May 24, 2012, and May
31, 2012, respectively. Pursuant to the Protective Order, BANA designated portions of the
transcript of each witness as confidential. Id. Exs. D-F. On July 11, 2012, Plaintiffs challenged
each and every designation in all three transcripts. Id. Ex. G. On July 18, 2012, BANA
responded in writing. Id. Ex. H. Thereafter the parties attempted to resolve the dispute in
accordance with Local Rule 37.1. At the conclusion of their telephonic conference, BANA
agreed to review and possibly narrow its designations, id. Ex. I, and did so on August 1, 2012, id.
Ex. J. Two hours later, Plaintiffs reaffirmed their position that none of the designated testimony
was entitled to protection. Id. Ex. K.3 Pursuant to Paragraph 15 of the Protective Order, BANA
now moves for a further protective order to keep the portions of the Schoolitz, Martin and Orris
transcripts it has designated as confidential from public disclosure.
ARGUMENT
THE DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS WERE PROPERLY DESIGNATED AS
“CONFIDENTIAL” AND SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE.
The Protective Order is “intended to protect from disclosure documents and information
the parties deem to be confidential.” Protective Order at 1. The parties agreed, and the Court
ordered, that each party “shall have the right to designate any material” containing “information
that is proprietary or sensitive to the Producing Party and is not otherwise in the public domain”
as “Confidential Information,” which the Protective Order defines as “confidential commercial
or financial information, trade secrets, personal information, or other confidential information

2

Orris was deposed pursuant to a subpoena issued by Plaintiffs’ counsel and dated May 11, 2012, a copy of which
Plaintiffs did not provide to BANA until May 17, 2011, two weeks before the noticed date. See Goldstein Decl.,
Ex. L.
3

Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ belief that none of the designated testimony was entitled to protection, they withdrew
their challenge to the designated testimony of Lourdes Duarte and to portions of the designated testimony of Jinja
Martin. See Goldstein Decl., Ex. K.

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 7 of 16

entitled to a protective order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c).” Protective Order
¶¶ 1-2. Rule 26(c) provides, in turn, that “[t]he court may, for good cause, issue an order to
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or
expense, including . . . (F) requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on court order;
[or] (G) requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial
information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way.” As demonstrated below,
good cause exists to prohibit public disclosure of the portions of the Schoolitz, Martin and Orris
transcripts that BANA has designated as confidential.
A.

The Designated Testimony Contains Confidential Commercial Information.

To administer a program as complicated as HAMP, BANA, of course, developed a large
number of internal policies, practices and procedures. In addition, BANA has used the services
of third-party vendors, including Urban, to perform certain tasks in connection with its
administration of HAMP.

1.

BANA and Urban Have Taken Steps To Maintain The Confidentiality
Of This Information.

BANA and Urban have taken steps to protect information concerning their procedures
and processes from disclosure to third parties. See, e.g., Bank of New York, 171 F.R.D. at 144.

6

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 10 of 16

McElroy Decl., Ex. A at 36-37).
This provision protects not only BANA, but also Urban, which competes with other third-party
vendors for business from BANA and other entities, by preventing BANA from discussing
Urban’s procedures with other vendors.

Id.

See
Declaration of Carole Richter (“Richter Decl.”), ¶ 2, Ex. A at 2.A.4

In connection with this litigation, BANA sought, and the Court entered, the Protective
Order, allowing it to keep information about, inter alia, its own proprietary processes and the

4

Richter Decl., Ex. A at 1.A.

7

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 11 of 16

services Urban and other vendors perform for BANA from public disclosure. BANA reasonably
relied on the Protective Order in producing documents, producing witnesses for deposition,
permitting these witnesses to answer certain questions at deposition, and refraining from moving
to quash or seeking other relief in connection with subpoenas issued by Plaintiffs to third parties.
If BANA were unable to rely upon the Protective Order to prevent disclosure of its confidential
information to the public, it would have to approach discovery in this action in an entirely
different way. See, e .g., Martindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 295 (2nd Cir.
1979) (observing that protective orders are vitally important to “‘secur[ing] the just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination’ of civil disputes . . . by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence
that might conceivably be relevant”); see also Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir.
1986) (noting that “rather than facilitate an efficient and complete exploration of the facts and
issues, a public right of access would unduly complicate the process,” and “require the court to
make extensive evidentiary findings whenever a request for access was made, and this could in
turn lead to lengthy and expensive interlocutory appeals”); Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita
Elec. Indus. Co., 529 F. Supp. 866, 911-12 (E.D. Pa. 1981) (“The overriding purpose of a
protective order is to facilitate the communication of information between litigants. To
accomplish that end, it may be necessary to limit speech by parties and their counsel outside the
court.”).
2.

Plaintiffs Will Suffer No Harm If The Designated Information
Remains Confidential.

Plaintiffs’ deliberate effort to sidestep the confidentiality agreements between BANA and
Urban and between Urban and Orris and their failure to respect BANA’s designations pursuant
to the Protective Order have nothing whatsoever to do with Plaintiffs’ ability to litigate this case.
Instead, plaintiffs’ efforts are rather transparently designed to harm BANA and Urban by

8

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 12 of 16

publicly exposing their confidential information and potentially damaging their reputations.
Unlike BANA and Urban, however, who will suffer harm if BANA’s designations are not
affirmed, Plaintiffs will suffer no harm if the designations are affirmed. Such affirmation will
make no difference to either Plaintiffs’ ability to pursue their claims or the strength or weakness
of the claims themselves. Plaintiffs will remain free to obtain BANA’s confidential information
and to use this information in support of their claims. Indeed, it appears the only reason
plaintiffs now contest these confidentiality designations is because they hope to harm and
embarrass BANA by disseminating information about its internal procedures, including as they
are seen through the eyes of a disgruntled employee of one its vendors.5 See Goldstein Decl.,
Ex. G (“While Bank of America’s use of Urban Settlement Services may be a fact about which
Bank of America is embarrassed, it is not confidential.”). Rule 26(c), however, was designed to
protect against precisely this type of maneuver. See In re San Juan Star Co., 662 F.2d 108, 11415 (1st Cir. 1984).
B.

Disclosure Of The Designated Testimony Would Subject BANA To
“Annoyance, Embarrassment, Oppression, Or Undue Burden Or Expense.”

The Supreme Court has long recognized that “pretrial discovery by depositions and
interrogatories has a significant potential for abuse,” because “[t]here is an opportunity . . . for
litigants to obtain - incidentally or purposefully - information that not only is irrelevant but if
publicly released could be damaging to reputation and privacy,” and that “[t]he government
clearly has a substantial interest in preventing this sort of abuse of its processes.” Seattle Times
Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 34-35 (1984). In so doing, the Court noted that “pretrial
depositions and interrogatories are not public components of a civil trial,” “were not open to the

5

Goldstein Decl., Ex. C at 97:16-25, 100:5-16.

9

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 13 of 16

public at common law and, in general, they are conducted in private as a matter of modern
practice.” Id. at 33 (citations omitted); see also Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368,
396 (1979) (Burger, C.J., concurring) (“[I]t has never occurred to anyone, so far as I am aware,
that a pretrial deposition or pretrial interrogatories were other than wholly private to the litigants.
A pretrial deposition does not become part of a ‘trial’ until and unless the contents of the
deposition are offered in evidence.”). Because “[m]uch of the information that surfaces during
pretrial discovery may be unrelated, or only tangentially related, to the underlying cause of
action,” the Court determined that “restraints placed on discovered, but not yet admitted,
information are not a restriction on a traditionally public source of information.” Id.
Unsurprisingly, the First Circuit similarly concluded in San Juan Star, 662 F.2d 108,
114-15, recognizing that “[d]uring discovery, information is produced through compulsion,” and
that “discovery rules are liberal, giving parties broad power to gather information.” Id. As a
result,
a deponent may be obliged to reveal information that will not be admissible at trial.
Unlike evidence at trial, it has not passed the strict threshold tests of relevance and
admissibility, yet it has been compelled by dint of legal process. The information
revealed may be irrelevant, prejudicial, or pose and undue invasion of an individual
privacy.
Such undigested matter, forced from the mouth of an unwilling deponent, is hardly
material encompassed within a broad public “right to know.”
Id. at 115. As a result, Rule 26(c)(1) gives a court the power to “deny access to information
altogether by preventing discovery upon a showing of any ‘good cause’, specifically including
but not limited to such relatively innocuous possibilities as ‘annoyance, embarrassment,
oppression or undue burden or expense.’” Id. at 114. Reasoning thus, the Court of Appeals
affirmed an order barring any party from revealing the contents of deposition testimony so as to
preserve the defendants’ right to a fair trial in light of the potential for adverse publicity. Id. at

10

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 14 of 16

117; see also Anderson, 805 F.2d at 6 (1986) (“Seattle Times has foreclosed any claim of an
absolute public right of access to discovery materials.”).
Here, the designated testimony of Orris is unrelated or only tangentially related to
Plaintiffs’ underlying causes of action. Much – perhaps all – of it would not be admissible
because it is irrelevant, prejudicial or constitutes impermissible lay opinion. For example,
Plaintiffs’ claims are based on the allegation that they completed their HAMP Trial Period Plans
and were entitled to a permanent modification or a denial by or before June 2010. See Third
Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint [Dkt. No 93], passim. Because Orris did not
begin working at Urban until July or possibly September of 2010 (see Goldstein Decl., Ex. C. at
5:15-6:20; Richter Decl., ¶ 2), his testimony is of very limited relevance to Plaintiffs’ claims. In
addition,
Goldstein Decl.. Ex. C. at 181:5-9,
182:6-8.
Id. at 23:19-24:3, 35:5-36:19, 83:886:24, 123:18-124:1.
Notwithstanding the limited relevance of Orris’s knowledge, Plaintiffs’ counsel insisted
on eliciting testimony on topics about which Orris had no personal knowledge and that have no
possible relevance to Plaintiffs’ claims.

Case 1:10-md-02193-RWZ Document 142 Filed 08/24/12 Page 15 of 16

Allowing the designated portions of the testimony of Orris, Martin and Schoolitz into
the public record at this stage, when there is a very real possibility that they would not be
deemed admissible at trial, violates the principles behind Rule 26(c). See San Juan Star, 662
F.2d at 115 (“If the trial judge were required to allow virtually full publicity of utterances forced
from the mouth of an unwilling deponent, even if irrelevant or inadmissible, he might well refuse
to allow the discovery to proceed at all when the interests of a fair trial or personal privacy are
seriously threatened.”); accord Zenith Radio Corp., 529 F. Supp. at 912 (noting that courts “have
a general responsibility to do justice,” and “ must seek to protect from unwarranted harm parties
whose rights may ultimately be vindicated at trial.”). Accordingly, because BANA has
demonstrated good cause and reasonable reliance on the Protective Order, this Court should
grant the Motion and enter an order protecting the designated portions of the Schoolitz, Martin
and Orris depositions from public disclosure.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, for all of the foregoing reasons, BANA respectfully requests that the
Court grant the Motion.
