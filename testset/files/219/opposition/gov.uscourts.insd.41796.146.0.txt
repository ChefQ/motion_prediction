DEFENDANT MICHAEL HARRISON’S BRIEF IN RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER
______________________________________________________________________________
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) and this Court’s December 9, 2013 Briefing Schedule,
Defendant Michael Harrison (“Harrison”), by undersigned counsel, moves this Court for entry of
an order denying Plaintiff Malibu Media LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) Motion for a Protective Order. This
Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion for the reasons set forth in detail more fully below.
I.

LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) provides that “[t]he court may, for good cause,

issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue
burden or expense, including one or more of the following: … (G) requiring that a trade secret or
other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be
revealed only in a specified way[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).
The movant bears the burden of showing good cause and must establish good cause with
a particular and specific demonstration of fact, as distinguished from stereotyped and conclusory

statements. Directory Concepts, Inc. v. Fox, et al., No. 1:08-CV-225 at 1-2 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 16,
2008). “Merely asserting that a disclosure of the information could harm a litigant’s competitive
position is insufficient; the motion must explain how.” Id. at 2 (citing Shepard v. Humke,
IP011103-C-H/K, 2003 WL 1702256, at *1 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 28, 2003 (citing Baxter Int’l, Inc. v.
Abbott Labs., 297 F.3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2002)).
“The ‘good cause’ standard requires a balancing of the public and private interests
involved.” Cook Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp., 206 F.R.D. 244, 246 (S.D. Ind. 2001) (citing
Citizens First Nat’l Bank of Princeton v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 943 (7th Cir. 1999);
Cumberland Packing Corp. v. Monsanto Co., 184 F.R.D. 504, 505, 506 (E.D.N.Y. 1999); In re
Eli Lilly & Co., Prozac Products Liability Litigation, 142 F.R.D. 454, 456 (S.D. Ind. 1992). The
public has an interest in what goes on at all stages of a judicial proceeding including the pretrial
discovery stage. Id.; See Cincinnati Ins. Co. at 946 (“Most cases endorse a presumption of
public access to discovery materials”); See Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009)
(“Many of our decisions – as well as decisions from other circuits – speak broadly about a
‘presumption of public access to discovery materials’”); See also Bond at 1076, 1077 ([the
presumptive right of access] “simply refers to the general right of the public to access material
contained in court files and the limited right of litigants under the First Amendment to
‘disseminate information discovered in advance of trial,’” citing Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,
467 U.S. 20, 34 (1984)), (explaining that third parties have a First Amendment right to receive
information from parties and their attorneys who wish to disseminate it, i.e., from “willing
speakers.”).
A protective order may authorize the parties to restrict public access to properly
demarcated categories of legitimately confidential discovery documents if the judge is satisfied

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 146 Filed 12/16/13 Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 972

that: (1) the parties know what the legitimate categories of protectable information are and are
acting in good faith in deciding which parts of the discovery information qualify; and, (2) makes
explicit that any party and any interested member of the public may challenge the designation of
particular documents. Cook, Inc. at 247; See Directory Concepts at 2 (citing MRS Invs. v.
Meridian Sports, Inc., 2002 WL 193140 at *1 (S.D. Ind. Feb. 6, 2002) (“[A] protective order
must extend only to ‘properly demarcated categor[ies] of legitimately confidential
information.’”); See Id. (“A court may not enter a protective order that gives the parties carte
blanche to decide which information to protect[,]” citing Cincinnati Ins. Co. at 945; See also Id.
(The judge is the “primary representative of the public interest in the judicial process” vested
with the duty of balancing the public’s interest against the “property and privacy interests of the
litigants.”). The Court’s evaluation of a proposed protective order “focuses on whether the
parties have identified legitimate categories of protectable information, whether they sufficiently
understand the parameters of those categories, and whether they will act in good faith in making
designations within those categories.” Id.
The proponent of a proposed protective order must first show the information sought to
be protected “meet[s] the definition of trade secrets or other categories of bona fide long-term
confidentiality.” Baxter Int’l, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 297 F.3d 544 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing as
examples Grove Fresh Distributors, Inc. v. Everfresh Juice, Co., 24 F.3d 893 (7th Cir. 1994); In
re Continental Illinois Securities Litigation, 732 F.2d 1302 (7th Cir. 1984)). To qualify as a trade
secret, the information must be economically and competitively valuable and the value must
derive from the secrecy of the information, and the holder must show reasonable efforts to
maintain the information’s secrecy. Cook, Inc. at 248; See IDX Systems Corp. v. Epic Systems
Corp., 285 F.3d 581, 583 (7th Cir. 2002). “The value of the information to the holder must

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 146 Filed 12/16/13 Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 973

constitute a positive economic advantage; prevention of embarrassment and injury to reputation
or public image is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access to information.” Cook, Inc.
at 248 (citing Republic of the Philippines v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 949 F.2d 653, 663 (3rd.
Cir. 1991); Joint Stock Society v. UDV North America, Inc., 104 F.Supp.2d 390, 403, 404-05 (D.
Del. 2000).

“Proponents of protective orders must make particularized showings of the

competitive harm likely to result from the disclosure of protected information.” Cook, Inc. at 248
(citing Republic of the Philippines, 949 F.2d at 663); See IDX Systems Corp. at 547 (“[U]nless
the plaintiff engages in a serious effort to pin down the secrets a court cannot do its job… The
claim that a contract or other agreement is, by its terms, confidential and that, if made public,
could harm the party’s competitive position is not a legal justification for secrecy in litigation.”);
See Baxter, 297 F.3d at 546 (The assertion that secrecy is justified because the discovery
requested consists of commercial documents won’t do.).
In order for non trade secret business information to be protected from public disclosure,
the movant must show that the category qualifies as legitimately protectable information and
show that specific competitive harm is threatened; that is, specifically show how disclosure will
harm a business’ competitive standing. Cook, Inc. at 248, n. 2, 248-49 (citing Cumberland
Packing 184 F.R.D. at 506 (“Needless to say a party is more likely to be able to establish such
good cause if it presents to the court a discrete category of documents and explains why those
documents should be sealed.”)) The category of "non-public information" is too vague. Cook,
Inc. at 248. “If [non-public] means only that the information is not available to the general
public, then it is insufficient because the information must be kept secret from and not be readily
ascertainable by potential competitors.” Id. “Moreover, the confidential information must give
the holder an economic advantage and threaten a competitive injury – business information

whose release harms the holder only because the information is embarrassing or reveals
weaknesses does not qualify for trade secret protection.” Id.
II.

ANALYSIS
This Court should deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of a Protective Order because

Plaintiff’s proposed protective order fails to meet the legal requirements set forth above.
A.

PLAINTIFF’S PROTECTIVE ORDER DOES NOT GIVE ANY INTERESTED MEMBER
OF THE PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE THE DESIGNATION OF
PARTICULAR DOCUMENTS.

While Plaintiff’s protective order gives the parties the right to challenge the designation
of particular documents, it fails to provide any interested member of the public the right to
challenge the designation of particular documents. See Dkt. 143-1 at 4, ¶ 10. As a result, this
Court cannot be satisfied with Plaintiff’s protective order. See Cook, Inc. at 247.
B.

PLAINTIFF’S PROTECTIVE ORDER CANNOT SATISFY THE COURT THAT THE
PARTIES KNOW WHAT A TRADE SECRET IS.

Plaintiff’s motion states “Defendant seeks Plaintiff’s confidential proprietary business
information and trade secrets,” but the term “trade secret(s)” is completely absent from
Plaintiff’s proposed protective order; so is a definition of trade secrets. See Dkt. 143-1 at 1-7.
This Court cannot be satisfied that Plaintiff knows what a trade secret is:
[T]he Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has had ‘no objection to an order that allows the
parties to keep their trade secrets (or some other properly demarcated category of
legitimately confidential information) out of the public record, provided the judge (1)
satisfies himself that the parties know what a trade secret is and are acting in good faith in
deciding which parts of the record are trade secrets[.] Directory Concepts at 2; See Cook,
Inc. at 247.
C.
PLAINTIFF’S PROTECTIVE ORDER CANNOT SATISFY THE COURT THAT THE
PARTIES KNOW WHAT THE LEGITIMATE CATEGORIES OF CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION ARE AND ARE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH IN DECIDING WHICH PARTS OF
THE DISCOVERY INFORMATION QUALIFY AS PROTECTABLE.

	  

5	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 146 Filed 12/16/13 Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 975

Plaintiff’s protective order seeks to protect “confidential information.” See Dkt. 143-1 at
1, ¶ 1. According to the proposed protective order:
Confidential information shall include without limitation customer lists, and such other
documents deemed by counsel for either party to be confidential and which consists of
information which has not been made public and which concerns or relates to the
processes, operations, type of work, or apparatus, or to the production, type and volume
of sales, shipments, purchase, transfers, identification of customers, inventories, amount
or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any persons, firm partnership,
corporation, or other organization, the disclosure of which information may have the
effect of causing harm to the competitive position of the person, firm, partnership,
corporation, or to the organization from which the information was obtained.
The definition of confidential information is overly broad and vague and there are not
properly demarcated categories of information enabling the parties, the Court, or anyone else to
know what qualifies as legitimately confidential information. It is even more difficult to grasp
how information designated as confidential deserves protection if the disclosure of which “may
have the effect of causing harm to the competitive position of the person…” In order to qualify
as legitimately confidential information, the disclosure must result in specific competitive harm.
If it might cause harm, how is it legitimately confidential information? Plaintiff effectively
grants itself carte blanche discretion to designate any document in discovery as “Confidential –
Attorney’s Eyes Only” or “Confidential – Outside Attorney’s Eyes Only” under its proposed
blanket protective order.

This Court cannot be satisfied that the parties know what the

legitimate categories of protectable information are.
If the parties do not know what the legitimate categories of protectable information are,
this Court cannot be satisfied that the parties are acting in good faith in deciding which parts of
discovery information qualify as protectable information.
D.
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FAILS TO ESTABLISH GOOD CAUSE BECAUSE NO
PARTICULARIZED SHOWING IS MADE OF HOW THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION
CONSTITUTES A POSITIVE ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; HOW THE
VALUE OF THE INFORMATION ARISES FROM ITS SECRECY AND THAT REASONABLE

EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXERTED TO MAINTAIN ITS SECRECY; AND HOW DISCLOSURE
WILL RESULT IN SPECIFIC COMPETITIVE HARM.
Plaintiff ‘s Motion for Entry of a Protective Order states that “Plaintiff has good cause for
a protective order because disclosure or dissemination of such information will not only impair
Plaintiff’s ability to compete in the market, but will also expose Plaintiff and its employees to
harassment.”
Plaintiff argues that its financial information (tax records) “should be protected from any
unwarranted dissemination” because the information is “of a highly private and personal nature”
[Dkt. 144-1 at 2]. This is not a proper legal basis upon which to qualify the information as
legitimately confidential information. See Cook, Inc. at 248 (“[B]usiness information whose
release harms the holder only because the information is embarrassing or reveals weaknesses
does not qualify for trade secret protection.”)
Plaintiff states that confidential proprietary business information and trade secrets are
contained in its articles of organization, articles of incorporation, shareholder agreements,
shareholder voting agreements, buy-sell agreements, employment contracts, and agreements
between Plaintiff and employees who monitor the online security of Plaintiff’s websites [Dkt.
143 at 3]. Plaintiff argues that “[i]f this information is disseminated to the public, Plaintiff’s
competitors will have direct access to sales and revenue information, expense information,
corporate strategies, investor funding and relations, marketing strategies, as well as several other
aspects relating to Plaintiff’s business.” And “public disclosure of the information Defendant
requests could severely impair Plaintiff’s ability to compete in the marketplace and will intrude
on the confidential rights and communications of Plaintiff, its employees, and affiliates.”
Plaintiff has only asserted that the information is not known to the public or its
competitors, and that it “will intrude on confidential rights and communications.” This “is

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 146 Filed 12/16/13 Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 977

insufficient because the information must be kept secret by reasonable efforts from and not be
readily ascertainable by potential competitors. Moreover the confidential information must give
the holder an economic advantage and threaten a competitive injury.” See Cook, Inc. at 248.
Plaintiff has failed to establish good cause because Plaintiff has merely asserted that disclosure
could harm its competitive position.
Finally, Plaintiff argues that good cause exists because Plaintiff, its employees and
affiliates will be subject to annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and
expenses pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) [Dkt. 143 at 3-4]. Plaintiff claims that anti-copyright
blogs and websites “often encourage individuals to harass Plaintiff, its employees, and affiliates
in order to discourage Plaintiff from filing suits against individuals that have infringed its
copyrights,” and that “several of Plaintiff’s counsels have received death threats and other
harassing letters and emails” [Dkt. 143 at 1]. This is still insufficient because Plaintiff does not
“describe a category or categories of information and show that substantial privacy interests
outweigh the presumption of public access to discovery material.” See Cook, Inc. at 249. Even
assuming Plaintiff’s claims are true, Plaintiff does not make a particularized showing of how the
susceptibility to “similar threats, annoyance, embarrassment, and harassment” relates to the
disclosure’s impact on Plaintiff’s competitive position in the marketplace.
IV.

CONCLUSION
Harrison arguments set forth above show that this Court cannot be satisfied with

Plaintiff’s proposed protective order and that Plaintiff cannot establish good cause for the entry
of a protective order. For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court should enter an order deny
Plaintiff’s Motion for a Protective Order; and for all other relief just and proper in the premises.
