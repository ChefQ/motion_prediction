PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ENTRY OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b) and 26(c), Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
moves for entry of the Protective Order attached hereto as Exhibit A, in order to protect against
disclosure or dissemination of its responses to Defendant’s discovery requests.
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff has initiated this action against Defendant, Michael Harrison (“Defendant”)
alleging copyright infringement of its movies through the BitTorrent protocol. On October 10,
2013, Defendant propounded his First Set of Requests for Production. In his request, Defendant
seeks information of a highly personal and private nature, along with Plaintiff’s confidential
proprietary business information and trade secrets. Plaintiff has good cause for a protective
order because disclosure or dissemination of such information will not only impair Plaintiff’s
ability to compete in the market, but will also expose Plaintiff and its employees to harassment.

Plaintiff’s counsel has conferred with Defendant’s counsel in a good faith effort to
resolve this dispute without Court action; however Defendant’s counsel has advised that he does
not consent to the order. See Exhibit B.
For the foregoing reasons, as set forth below, Plaintiff moves for the entry of a Protective
Order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c).
II.

ARGUMENT
a. Defendant’s Discovery Requests Seek Financial Information Of A Highly
Private and Personal Nature

Defendant’s discovery requests seek Plaintiff’s financial records which are highly private
and personal. Specifically, Defendant requests Plaintiff’s tax returns. These documents contain
the rates and amount at which Plaintiff pays its models, vendor, and employees. Tax records are
traditionally protected by a protective order in litigation. See e.g. Flores v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,
2013 WL 1091044 (D. Neb. Mar. 15, 2013) (“As with Plaintiff's medical records, her tax records
will be subject to a protective order maintaining the confidential nature of those documents”);
Maddow v. Procter & Gamble Co., Inc., 107 F.3d 846, 853 (11th Cir. 1997) (“The district court
held that the tax records would reveal income information not contained in W–2 forms and that
the information would be protected by the Protective Order entered into by the parties.”).
Because of the highly personal and private information contained in these records, Plaintiff
should
b. Defendant’s Discovery Seeks Information Regarding Plaintiff’s Trade Secrets,
Confidential Research, Development, and Commercial Information
Defendant seeks Plaintiff’s confidential proprietary business information and trade
secrets. As an example, Defendant requests Plaintiff’s “articles of organization, articles of
incorporation, operating agreements, shareholder agreements, shareholder voting agreements,

2

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 143 Filed 12/06/13 Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 951

buy-sell agreements, [and] employment contracts.” In addition, Defendant seeks agreements
between the Plaintiff and employees who monitor the online security of Plaintiff’s websites. If
this information is disseminated to the public, Plaintiff’s competitors will have direct access to
sales and revenue information, expense information, corporate strategies, investor funding and
relations, marketing strategies, as well as several other aspects relating to the inner workings of
Plaintiff’s business. This information includes litigation strategies and attorney-client privileged
information.
The consequences of publically disclosing confidential commercial business information
can significantly damage a producing party’s business.
[D]isclosure of Highly Confidential Business Information would enable a
competitor to target the producing party’s customers and potential customers,
undercut the producing party’s pricing, mimic the producing party’s successful
business plan, and the disclosure of Proprietary Personnel Information would
enable a competitor to evaluate the producing party’s workforce, determine the
identity of the best employees of the producing party in the specific geographical
areas, obtain contact information for those employees, and lure employees away
from the party by offering a slightly higher salary or slightly better benefit.
See Directory Concepts, Inc. v. Fox, 2008 WL 5263386 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 16, 2008) (finding good
cause to grant a motion for a protective order for the discovery of trade secrets, highly
confidential business information, and proprietary personnel information). Equally, in this case,
public disclosure of the information Defendant requests could severely impair Plaintiff’s ability
to compete in the marketplace and will intrude on the confidential rights and communications of
Plaintiff, its employees, and affiliates.
c. Defendant’s Discovery seeks Information That If Publicly Disseminated Will
Subject Plaintiff’s Employees to Harassment
Plaintiff has good cause for a protective order because if this information is provided to
the public, Plaintiff, its employees and affiliates will be subject to annoyance, embarrassment,

oppression, or undue burden and expense pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). Indeed, Plaintiff is
aware of anti-copyright blogs and websites that follow cases by Plaintiff and disseminate defense
strategies and other information. Often these blogs and websites encourage individuals to harass
Plaintiff, its employees and affiliates in order to discourage Plaintiff from filing suits against
individuals that have infringed its copyrights. Several of Plaintiff’s counsels have received death
threats and other harassing letters and emails. Plaintiff has legitimate fear that if the information
of its employees and affiliates is provided and disseminated to the public, Plaintiff, its employees
and affiliates will be susceptible to similar threats and experience annoyance, embarrassment,
and harassment.
III.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Malibu Media, LLC respectfully requests that this Court grant
its Motion and enter the attached Protective Order to allow the parties to exchange their
confidential information.
Respectfully submitted,
