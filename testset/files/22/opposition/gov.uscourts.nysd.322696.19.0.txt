SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION OF
ALLISON ARMOUR FOR APPOINTMENT AS LEAD PLAINTIFF
AND APPROVAL OF SELECTION OF COUNSEL

Case 1:08-cv-02788-LAP

This class action alleges that Deutsche Bank deceptively marketed auction rate securities
to investors as risk-free, cash-equivalent alternatives to money-market funds, when they were in
fact complex, long-term financial instruments. Those securities became illiquid on February 13,
2008, after Deutsche Bank and all other major broker-dealers abruptly withdrew their “support”
for the $330 billion auction rate securities market. State and federal regulators are now
conducting several probes into the collapse of the market. In April 2008, Deutsche Bank
received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General as part of an investigation into the
disclosures Deutsche Bank and other broker-dealers made to investors about the safety and
liquidity of auction rate securities.
On May 16, 2008, class member Allison Armour filed a timely motion, pursuant to the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B), for her appointment as
Lead Plaintiff and approval of her selection of counsel. No other Class member filed a motion
for appointment.
Ms. Armour satisfies the criteria for appointment as Lead Plaintiff. In her motion, Ms.
Armour demonstrated that she purchased $2,675,000 of auction rate securities from Deutsche
Bank during the Class Period. Presently, Ms. Armour holds $2,500,000 of illiquid auction rate
securities. “As the only movant for appointment as lead plaintiff, [Ms. Armour] has the largest
financial interest in the relief sought . . . .” Koppel v. 4987 Corp., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12340,
*25 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 1999).
As described in her previously filed motion, Ms. Armour also satisfies the typicality and
adequacy requirements for appointment as Lead Plaintiff, as set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 78u4(a)(3)(B)(iii). Ms. Armour is typical in that her claims and the claims of all other Class
members arise out of their purchases of auction rate securities from Deutsche Bank during the
Class Period as a result of Deutsche Bank’s materially false and misleading statements and
omissions about the liquidity and risk characteristics of those securities and the auction market.
Ms. Armour is an adequate Class representative because her interests are aligned with those of
other Class members, and there is no evidence of any antagonism between their interests. In

addition, Ms. Armour has selected competent and experienced counsel to prosecute the claims in
this case and to serve the interests of the Class. Accordingly, Ms. Armour is the presumptive
“most adequate plaintiff” under the PSLRA. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii).
For the reasons stated herein and in her moving papers, Ms. Armour respectfully requests
that this Court: (1) appoint her as Lead Plaintiff pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i); and
(2) approve her selection of counsel pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(v).
