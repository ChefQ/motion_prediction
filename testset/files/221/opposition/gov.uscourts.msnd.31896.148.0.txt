THIRD PARTY PLAINTIFF JOYCE MA’S MEMORANDUM BRIEF IN
SUPPORT OF HER OPPOSITION TO THE THIRD PARTY
DEFENDANTS’ SECOND MOTION TO DISMISS

COMES NOW, Third Party Plaintiff Joyce Ma, the individual ("Ma"), and,
by counsel, respectfully submits her Memorandum of Points and Authorities in
Support of her opposition to the Second Motion to Dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b)(6) by Third Party Defendants collectively shown herein as (“Shawn”).
1. THE LEGAL BASIS

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 2 of 9 PageID #: 831

1.

Motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure "are viewed with disfavor and are rarely granted." Kocurek v.
Cuna Mut. Ins. Soc'y, No. 10-51042, 2012 WL 201866, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 24,
2012) (citing Gregson v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir. 2003)).
"The ultimate question in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is whether the complaint states a
valid claim when all well-pleaded facts are assumed true and are viewed in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff." Lone Star Fund V (US), L.P. v. Barclays
Bank PLC, 594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches
Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)). A complaint must include "a short and
plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." FED. R.
CIV. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief
that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,570, 127 S.
Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The court must not evaluate the likelihood of
the claim's success, but instead ascertain whether the plaintiff has stated a legally
cognizable claim that is plausible. Lone Star Fund, 594 F.3d at 387 (citing Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.662, 129 S. Ct. 1937,1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)).
2.

Rule 1.4 of Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct provides that

“[a] lawyer shall … promptly comply with reasonable requests for information” by
client.

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 3 of 9 PageID #: 832

3.

ABA Model Rule 1.16(d) provides that, upon termination of

representation, “a lawyer shall take steps . . . to protect a client’s interests . . . [and
surrender] papers and property to which the client is entitled.”
4.

Where a client “had reason to know his attorneys acted negligently,”

the statute of limitations began to run. Hymes v. McIlwain, 856 So.2d 416, 419
(Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
2. STATUTE OF LIMITATION
A. SINCE MA DISCOVERED THE NEGLIGENCE WHEN POWERTRAIN
FILED THE INSTANT CASE, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION BEGAN TO
RUN NO EARLIER THAN MAY 3, 2011.
5.

In this second motion to dismiss, Shawn claims that Mississippi’s

three-year statute of limitations for attorney malpractice claims had long since run
before suit was filed.
6.

Ma agrees with Shawn that where a client “had reason to know his

attorneys acted negligently,” the statute of limitations began to run. Hymes v.
McIlwain, 856 So.2d 416, 419 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
7.

Ma thought that her do-no-harm agreement with Powertrain, with the

involvement of Shawn, was properly done. She has no legal expertise to recognize

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 4 of 9 PageID #: 833

the significance of not putting the agreement in writing, of the potential conflict
between Powertrain and her, as Powertrain might think that she, the individual,
was in the stream of commerce of selling the subject engines to Powertrain, and of
the conflict of interests of the Shawn-Powertrain relation and the Shawn-Ma
relation.
8.

The essence of the “do-no-harm contract between Ma and the

Plaintiff, Powertrain, was that Powertrain was obligated not to file the instant
lawsuit against Ma. That is what the Third Party Defendants, Shawn and
Shawn/Coulson, represented to Ma. However, the Third Party Defendants, Shawn
and Shawn/Coulson never memorialized that agreement for Ma’s benefit. The
earliest time that Ma knew or had reason to know that Shawn and Shawn/Coulson
acted negligently was on May 3, 2011, or soon thereafter, when she was served the
summons of the instant case (Doc. No. 2) and subsequently realized that the do-noharm agreement was negligently done.
B. SHAWN MISCHARACTERIZED MA’S LANGUAGE
9.

In many places in Shawn’s second motion to dismiss, Shawn stated

that Ma alleged that the conflict was “clear and obvious.”

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 5 of 9 PageID #: 834

10.

For instance, on page 3, Shawn stated that “Ma alleges that the

conflict of interest was ‘clear and obvious’ at the May 2, 2005 deposition. She
insists:
“22. When the Third Party Defendants offered to represent Powertrain
in the Honda case, they knew or should have known the clear and
obvious conflict of interest….” (Doc. No. 145 at 3)
11.

Clearly, by “they,” Ma meant “the Third Party Defendants,” i.e.,

Shawn, not Ma herself. It is a mischaracterization to allege that Ma meant here that
the conflict was “clear and obvious” in general, or that it is “clear and obvious” to
Ma, in particular. Ma only alleged that the aforementioned significances (¶ 7) are
“clear and obvious” to Shawn, the attorney.
12.

Therefore, Shawn’s statement that “Ma alleges that the conflict of

interest was ‘clear and obvious’” is a mischaracterization of what Ma actually
alleged.
C. MA HAS PROPERLY ALLEGED SHAWN’S BREACH
13.

Shawn claimed that “William Shawn ‘turn[ed] over all of said records

to one client only, Powertrain.’ Significantly, Ma makes no allegation about what
documents that Ma may have sought, and no allegation that William Shawn’s

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 6 of 9 PageID #: 835

transmission of the documents to Powertrain caused her any damage of any kind.”
(Doc. No. 145 at 4)
14.

It appears that if Shawn has turned over all documents to Powertrain.

Therefore the preciseness of Ma’s document request to Shawn is irrelevant.
15.

As to the issue of damages, one of the damages is that Ma is exposed

to this lawsuit. Had the do-no-harm promise been properly handled by her
lawyers, the Third Party Defendant, by memorializing the promise in writing, Ma
would not be in this lawsuit.
D. MA REQUESTS THE COURT FOR LEAVE TO AMEND ITS ANSWER TO
POWERTRAIN’S AMENDED COMPLAINT
16.

Shawn pointed out that Ma stated in her Answer to Powertrain’s

amended complaint (Doc. No. 84):
59. Ma has never formed any contract with Powertrain.
60. All of Powertrain’s claims are barred because there has been no
contract between Ma and Powertrain.
17.

While emphasizing that the Answer is not part of the third party

complaint to be examined pursuant to Lone Star Fund and that the do-no-harm

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 7 of 9 PageID #: 836

promise is clearly stated in the Answer, Ma hereby requests the leave of the Court
to amend the First Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 84) as follows:
59. Ma has never formed any contract with Powertrain to sell the
subject engines.
60. All of Powertrain’s claims are barred because there has been no
contract between Ma and Powertrain to sell the subject engines.
(Exhibit A)

3. THE HONDA CASE IS ONLY MARGINALLY RELEVANT TO THE
INSTANT CASE
18.

Shawn has attached many excerpts from the Honda case as exhibits to

their Motion. The purpose of these exhibits is to point out many alleged apparent
discrepancies between Ma’s knowledge during that time and her claims now.
Those matters are, however, irrelevant to Ma’s Amended Third Party Complaint as
demonstrated below.
19.

First, Shawn represented Ma in the do-no-harm agreement period,

before any other lawyer entered the scene. Therefore, the other lawyers were not
involved in the matter of the do-no-harm agreement.

Case: 1:11-cv-00105-GHD-DAS Doc #: 148 Filed: 02/20/14 8 of 9 PageID #: 837

20.

Second, it is entirely normal for Best Machinery & Electrical, Inc., the

employer, to take care of the Honda case for Ma, the employee, when she was sued
for company business. Therefore, it is entirely possible that Ma was only
nominally engaged in the Honda case, e.g., the decisions of filing any papers and
engaging any attorneys were made by others. All statements made by Ma and cited
by Shawn, when viewed under that light, are coherent, reasonable, and only
marginally relevant to this case.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Ma respectfully requests the Court to deny the Third Party
Defendants’ Second Motion to Dismiss. Alternatively, Ma respectfully requests
leave from the Court to amend the Third Party Complaint.
In addition, Ma hereby requests the leave of the Court to amend her Answer
to Powertrain’s First Amended Complaint. (Exhibit A)
