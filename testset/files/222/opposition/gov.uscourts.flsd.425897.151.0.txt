UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO. 13-CV-22841-GRAHAM/SIMONTON

THE COLLECTION, LLC,
Plaintiff,
vs.
INTREPID INSURANCE CO.,
Defendant.
_________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
Plaintiff The Collection, LLC (“The Collection”) hereby files this Response in
Opposition to Defendant, Intrepid Insurance Co.’s (“Intrepid” or “Insurer”) Motion for
New Trial. (DE 146.) The Motion should be denied in its entirety as the jury verdict in
this case was consistent with and amply supported by the evidence in this case, and
Intrepid’s claims of error are incorrect.
I.

Factual Background

This case was presented to the jury over a four day trial focused primarily on the
issue of the intent of Scott Newcomb, who was the owner and operator of Newcomb
Motors. This Court had ruled in advance on the parties’ cross summary judgment
motions that the issue of Newcomb’s intent was the critical issue to assess Intrepid’s
liability under the applicable insurance Policy. (DE 105, at 4-5.) The Court’s ruling in this
regard essentially adopted the position advocated by the Insurer (see DE 70), and the
jury was so instructed without objection from the Insurer. (See DE 138, at 8: “In order for

the ‘deception’ coverage at issue to apply to The Collection’s claimed loss, Plaintiff must
demonstrate that Scott Newcomb Motors or its principal Scott Newcomb acted with
criminal intent to steal from The Collection.”).
Here,

quite

testimony,

substantial

circumstantial evidence was presented of Newcomb’s criminal intent. This evidence
included evidence regarding bad checks written to The Collection, federal bank fraud,
misrepresentations to The Collection regarding Newcomb’s intent, and Newcomb’s
misrepresentations to others, including Newcomb’s bank. In addition, direct evidence of
intent was appropriately presented in the form of Newcomb’s invocation of his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked directly about his intent to
steal from The Collection.1
Now, in its Motion for a new trial, Defendant argues, once again, that
Newcomb’s Fifth Amendment invocation should not have been presented to the jury.
(Mot. at 2.) In addition, Defendant argues that this case should never have been
presented to the jury at all. (Id. at 6.) The first argument should be rejected on the same
grounds the Court rejected it when initially presented. Precedent from the Eleventh
Circuit and elsewhere permits an adverse inference here. The second argument should
be rejected as it has been waived and is unavailing in any event.
Preliminarily, it bears noting that Intrepid raises no issue whatsoever with any of
the Court’s jury instructions. Nor does Intrepid assert that the jury’s verdict in this case
1

Intrepid’s citation to Newcomb’s testimony regarding his overall gestalt (“I never
intentionally took anything,” Newcomb dep. at 43:15-22) is irrelevant because (1)
Newcomb refused to answer specific questions about his dealings with The Collection,
id. at 43:23-44:3 & 45-64, and, (2) the jury was free to discredit Newcomb’s general
denial of bad intent regardless.

Case No. 13-CV-22841-GRAHAM/SIMONTON

(that Scott Newcomb acted with criminal intent to steal from The Collection) was not in
accord with the weight of the evidence.
Indeed, the jury’s decision was supported by evidence introduced at trial
including: (1) Newcomb’s false statements to The Collection with respect to the ongoing
success of his business; (2) Newcomb’s federal charge and conviction for bank fraud
based in large part on the creation of fictitious invoices from The Collection presented to
his bank in order to fraudulently obtain loan proceeds exceeding $1 million, which his
insolvent business could never repay; (3) Newcomb’s submission of worthless checks
to The Collection for payment of vehicles at a time when his bank account was
overdrawn, “on hold,” and where he had no ability to repay legitimately his overdrawn
account; (4) Newcomb’s subsequent false statements to The Collection; (4) the
statement from the federal prosecutor to the Virginia Federal District Court based on the
federal investigation that Newcomb had “stolen” cars from The Collection; and (6) the
Western District of Virginia’s Court finding that The Collection was a “victim” under the
federal Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3663 as a “direct and proximate”
consequence of Newcomb’s conduct.
In addition to this overwhelming evidence, the jury properly heard Newcomb’s
invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to
direct questions at his videotaped deposition regarding his intent to steal from The
Collection, including his knowledge that the checks he gave The Collection were
worthless. (See DE 112-1, at 59, 55.)

II.

ARGUMENT

In its motion, Intrepid makes two arguments. First, Intrepid argues that the Court
committed reversible error in allowing Plaintiff’s designations of the testimony of Scott
Newcomb, in which Newcomb asserted his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to
avoid self-incriminating answers, to be heard by the jury. Second, Intrepid argues that a
jury should not have been impaneled to rule on the case at all. The arguments lack
merit.
A.

Standard of Review.
When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the court must determine “if in [its]

opinion, ‘the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence ... or will result in a
miscarriage of justice, even though there may be substantial evidence which would
prevent the direction of a verdict.’” Ins. Co. of N. America v. Valente, 933 F.2d 921, 92223 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting Hewitt v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 732 F.2d 1554, 1556 (11th
Cir.1984)). “[T]o assure that the judge does not simply substitute his judgment for that of
the jury ... we have noted that new trials should not be granted on evidentiary grounds
unless, at a minimum, the verdict is against the great-not merely the greater-weight of
the evidence.” Valente, supra, at 923 (quoting Hewitt, 732 F.2d at 1554). The judge
must protect against manifest injustice in the jury’s verdict, but it is not the judge’s role
to assess credibility where conflicting testimony has been presented during the trial. Id.
at 1558-59. Instead, the judge must defer to the jury on the weight to be given to each
witness’s testimony. Id. Furthermore, in order to merit a new trial, any error in
evidentiary rulings “must have affected ‘substantial rights.’” Haygood v. Auto–Owners
Ins. Co., 995 F.2d 1512, 1514–15 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)).

B.

Evidence of Newcomb’s Assertion of the Fifth Amendment.
Notably, Intrepid, not Plaintiff, pursued the deposition of Scott Newcomb (see DE

25, Defendant’s Motion to Depose a Federal Prisoner), and designated portions of his
testimony after the deposition was concluded. (DE 117, Defendant’s Designations as to
Deposition of Scott Newcomb.) Intrepid also advised the jury at voir dire (with Plaintiff’s
agreement) that Newcomb’s assertion of the Fifth Amendment would be presented
before the jury as evidence. Defendant’s introduction of portions of Newcomb’s
testimony may be deemed a waiver of its objection. Cf. Rojas v. Richardson, 703 F.2d
186, 189 (5th Cir. 1979).
Assuming arguendo that the issue was preserved by Defendant, the Court’s
ruling allowing Newcomb’s testimony was in accordance with the recent Eleventh Circuit
decision in Coquina Inv. v. TD Bank, NA, 760 F. 3d 1300, 1310-11 (11th Cir. 2014),
which also provided the Court with the jury instruction given in this case to guide the
jury’s consideration (without objection by Intrepid). The Eleventh Circuit’s Coquina case
clearly grants to this Court discretion to permit the inference. Ironically, Coquina is
based on the same Second Circuit case relied upon in the one case cited in the
Insurer’s new trial motion, Kontos v. Kontos, 968 F.Supp. 400 (S.D. Ind. 1997).
Intrepid’s arguments are off the mark because Plaintiff never argued any adverse
inference against Intrepid from Newcomb’s testimony; instead, as the Court’s jury
instruction made very clear, the only inference that the jury may have drawn was
against Newcomb, the individual asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege. (DE 138, at
10: “[W]here a witness has refused to answer questions or testify by invoking his or her

5

Case 1:13-cv-22841-DLG Document 151 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/11/2014 Page 6 of 9
Case No. 13-CV-22841-GRAHAM/SIMONTON

Fifth Amendment right, you may, but you need not, draw a negative inference against
the witness.”)(emphasis added).
Cases uniformly allow a fact-finder in a civil context to draw a negative inference
from the assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege against the person who has said, in
essence, that a truthful answer would tend to incriminate him.

E.g., Baxter v.

Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 319 (1976) (prevailing rule allows adverse inferences to be
drawn against parties to civil actions who assert the privilege); Cerro Gordo Charity v.
Fireman’s Fund American Life Ins. Co., et al., 819 F.2d 1471 (8th Cir. 1987). The Cerro
Gordo decision is particularly relevant since a non-party witness’ Fifth Amendment
invocation found appropriately admitted in that cast precisely because the witness’
intent was relevant, just as in the present case, to establishing coverage under an
insurance policy.
The issue in this case under the Court’s rulings was the presence or absence of
criminal intent in Scott Newcomb, and his deposition directly addressed that relevant
issue. The Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the evidence before the jury
under the legal guidance of the Coquina case.2
C.

Jury Trial was Properly Held and Any Objection Was Waived Long Ago.
In its initial pleading in this case, Plaintiff demanded a jury trial. (DE 9 at 3).3

While Intrepid once suggested that the jury on its declaratory claims should only be

2

Intrepid also asserts that Newcomb waived the Fifth Amendment privilege by
answering some questions at his deposition. However, Intrepid never moved to compel
answers nor did it previously suggest the privilege invocation was improper. This
argument has been waived.
3
The Collection’s Counterclaim became the guiding complaint when the parties were
realigned by Court order.
6

Case No. 13-CV-22841-GRAHAM/SIMONTON

advisory (Ans., DE 12 at 5), the Court dismissed the declaratory judgment claim as
duplicative and unnecessary, (DE 18), thus mooting Intrepid’s argument. Intrepid did not
again suggest (until now) that the Court should be the fact-finder as to any issues; it did
not move to strike Plaintiff’s jury demand.
To the contrary, in the parties’ Scheduling Stipulation, entered in response to an
Order from the Court that the parties specify whether the trial was jury or non-jury (DE
14 at 2 ¶6), the parties jointly recited: “The Collection has requested a jury trial on all
issues so triable.” (DE 16 at 3.) Intrepid did not disagree with this position or suggest a
different procedure was required. Again, no motion to strike jury demand or other
objection was ever filed by Intrepid. Further, any request for non-jury trial was
abandoned (at the latest) by Intrepid at trial, where no request was made of the Court to
rule on any issues.

Plainly, a new trial cannot be granted on an issue waived by

Intrepid here. Richardson v. Bombadier, 2005 WL 3087864 *7(M.D. Fla. 2005)(“[T]he
moving party may not raise objection to alleged errors for the first time in a motion for
new trial”).
In any case, while the issue was not raised before, Plaintiff was entitled to a jury
trial on the factual issue of Newcomb’s intent under the United States Constitution and
the Rules of Civil Procedure. Dairy Queen Inc v. Wood, 360 U.S. 469 (1962); Beacon
Theatres Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959); In re Atlas Roofing Corp. Prods.
Liability Litig., ___ F.Supp. 2d ___, Case No. 13-2495, 2014 WL 1908735 (N.D. Ga.
May 12, 2014). In In re Atlas Roofing, the court explained that framing a claim as one
for declaratory judgment does not abridge a party’s right to a jury trial if one would have
been available otherwise: “A litigant is not necessarily deprived of a jury trial merely
7

Case No. 13-CV-22841-GRAHAM/SIMONTON

because it is a party to a declaratory judgment action … if there would have been a right
to a jury trial on the issue had it arisen in an action other than one for declaratory
judgment, then there is a right to jury trial in the declaratory judgment action.” Id.
at 6 (quoting Northgate Homes, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 126 F.3d 1095, 1098-99 (8th Cir.
1997)) (emphasis added). The Insurer’s argument is simply not well-taken.
D.

The Alleged Errors Are Harmless.
Even if the Court were to consider possible error, Intrepid cannot establish either

that there was a miscarriage of justice or that the issue prejudiced its substantial rights.
The record of Newcomb’s criminal intent was overwhelming, and in all likelihood the jury
would have reached the same result in the absence of Newcomb’s deposition. The
verdict in this case was in accordance with the law, the facts, the Policy, and justice,
and therefore there is no reason for this Court to reject it.
WHEREFORE, Intrepid’s motion for new trial should be denied.
