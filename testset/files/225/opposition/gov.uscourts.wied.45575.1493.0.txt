UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO APPLETON PAPERS INC.’S
MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE COURT’S DISMISSAL OF ITS CLAIMS FOR
RELIEF UNDER CERCLA SECTION 107

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 1 of 12 Document 1493

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO APPLETON PAPERS INC.’S
MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE COURT’S DISMISSAL OF ITS CLAIMS FOR
RELIEF UNDER CERCLA SECTION 107 1

API convinced this Court that its sole obligation regarding the Lower Fox River and
Green Bay Superfund Site is an indemnity obligation owed to NCR. To support its argument,
API represented to the Court that it had been “funding 60% of the cleanup costs on the basis of
its indemnity arrangement with NCR” and that it had no intention of “shirking its
60% indemnity.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 287 at 2, 15. With all of that established for
present purposes, API has no independent right to seek response costs from other potentially
responsible parties (“PRPs”) under CERCLA Section 107. As a party that has made payments
on an indemnity obligation owed to NCR, it is black letter law that API’s exclusive remedy
against third parties is a potential subrogation right to join NCR in pursuing whatever claims
NCR may have against those third parties. In late 2012, the Court granted API leave to assert a
new claim to preserve its possible subrogation rights against the Whiting case defendants. E.D.
Wis. Case No. 08-cv-16, Dkt. 1437 at 8-9. There is no basis for allowing API to press claims of
its own under CERCLA Section 107, however, as sought by API’s reconsideration motion.

Appleton Papers Inc. (“API”) has never asserted any claims against the United States in this case.
NCR Corporation (“NCR”) asserted claims against the United States in a complaint in a related action,
consolidated with this case, captioned NCR Corp. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., et al., No. 08-cv-895 (E.D.
Wis.). See E.D. Wis. No. 08-cv-895, Dkt. 31. Menasha Corp. also pursued third-party claims against the
United States in this case for some time, but Menasha sought and was granted leave to dismiss those
claims voluntarily in April 2011. See E.D. Wis. No. 08-cv-16, Dkt. 1114.
The United States nonetheless has an interest in the proper resolution of the issues raised by
API’s motion. Among other things, the outcome could affect counterclaims that API asserted against the
government in United States and the State of Wisconsin v. NCR Corp., et al., No. 10-cv-910 (E.D. Wis.).
In that case, the Court dismissed API’s CERCLA Section 107 counterclaims against the government
Plaintiffs based on the Court’s rulings in this case and other decisions such as Solutia, Inc. v. McWane,
Inc., 726 F. Supp. 2d 1316 (N.D. Ala. 2010). See E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 171.

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
The Court is quite familiar with the complicated history of this case and the government’s
related enforcement case, so we will not dwell on most of the details. Some of the facts
concerning API’s relationship to NCR deserve renewed emphasis, however, because of their
bearing on API’s latest motion.
Through a set of agreements and an arbitration award that was entered as a judgment in
the Southern District of New York, API must fund 60% of all costs that API and NCR are
required to bear for this Site. In 2011 and 2012, API and the government litigated over whether
the agreements and arrangements between API and NCR established: (1) an assumption of direct
CERCLA liability by API (as argued by the government); or (2) only a partial indemnity
obligation that API owed to NCR (as argued by API). API made three key points in advancing
its argument.
First, API insisted that its sole obligation concerning this Site was as NCR’s indemnitor.
API said:
“Any private financial arrangement between API and NCR is in the nature of an
indemnity, which does not impose successor liability on API or make API liable
under CERCLA.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 197 at 1.
“The sole obligation of API regarding the Fox River contamination is as a partial
indemnitor . . . to NCR.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 197 at 16.
“The Court confirmed this in its July 28, 2011 Order Denying Renewed Motion
For Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. 193, where the Court stated: ‘Appleton Papers
did not pollute itself, but signed an agreement stating it would indemnify NCR for
certain environmental liability,’ thus recognizing that API’s obligation is in the
nature of an indemnity arising from the 1998 Settlement Agreement.” E.D. Wis.
No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 197 at 17 n.7.
Second, API made clear that its cost-share payments for the ongoing remediation work at
the Site were being made as indemnity payments. API said:
“API is funding 60% of the cleanup costs on the basis of its indemnity
arrangement with NCR.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 287 at 2.
2
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 3 of 12 Document 1493

Until at least early 2012, API was providing that funding through payments into the limited
liability company that held the actual agreements with the remediation contractors. See
E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 92-12, Dkt. 141, Dkt. 152, Dkt. 287 at 2.
Third, API emphasized that a ruling in its favor on the CERCLA liability question would
have no impact on API’s status or responsibilities as NCR’s partial indemnitor. API said:
“A ruling by this Court that API did not assume NCR’s Fox River liabilities will
not affect API’s indemnification obligations to NCR.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910,
Dkt. 197 at 16 n.6.
“API is not shirking its 60% indemnity.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 287 at
15.
This Court ultimately accepted API’s arguments and held that “it is not a liable party
under CERCLA,” reasoning that, “[a]t most, as the arbitrators found, API agreed to indemnify
NCR for a portion of such liability.” E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 349 at 6, 9. That is now the
law of the case in the enforcement action and in this action. And API cannot deny or avoid the
necessary implications of the indemnity finding that it sought and obtained.2
As shown below, an indemnitor has no rights against third parties regarding its indemnity
payments aside from subrogated rights, and subrogated rights are derivative and cannot be
expanded beyond the rights and remedies that the indemnified party is entitled to pursue. The
case law confirms that those general subrogation principles apply to parties that have provided
indemnity for environmental cleanup costs; they cannot pursue independent, non-subrogation
claims under CERCLA. Because this Court correctly held that NCR could only maintain
contribution claims under CERCLA Section 113(f), and cannot assert claims under Section

2

See David v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689 (1895) (“Where a party assumes a certain position in a
legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his
interests have changed, assume a contrary position.”). See also New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742,
749 (2001) (quoting and applying the judicial estoppel rule announced in Wakelee); In re Cassidy, 892
F.2d 637, 641 (7th Cir. 1990) (same).

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 4 of 12 Document 1493

107(a)(4)(B), the most that API can do is join NCR in pursuing subrogated claims for
contribution if the Court’s prior finding that NCR deserves no contribution recovery is altered or
reversed on appeal.
ARGUMENT
1.

Under Subrogation Principles, API has no Independent Claims Under
CERCLA Against Third Parties for Recovery of Monies Paid as NCR’s
Indemnitor.

As the Supreme Court noted long ago, “[s]ubrogation is a normal incident of indemnity
insurance.” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Moses, 287 U.S. 530, 542 (1933). “Subrogation simply means
substitution of one person for another; that is, one person is allowed to stand in the shoes of
another and assert that person’s rights against a third party.” US Airways, Inc. v. McCutcheon,
133 S. Ct. 1537, 1546 n.5 (2013) (internal quotation omitted). In a typical indemnity situation,
“[s]ubrogation involves the substitution of the insurer . . . to the rights of the insured.’” Id.
(internal quotation omitted). It “is an exclusively derivative remedy which depends upon the
claim of the insured and is subject to whatever defenses the tortfeasor has against the insured.”
Great Am. Ins. Co. v. United States, 575 F.2d 1031, 1034 (2d Cir. 1978).
The subrogation doctrine incorporates a critical limitation on the types of claims that an
indemnitor can bring against third parties for recovery of its indemnity payments. Because the
indemnitor, as subrogee, merely “steps into the shoes of the one whose claim or debt it has
covered,” the indemnitor “can only enforce rights the latter could enforce.” Aetna Cas. & Surety
Co. v. Chi. Ins. Co., 994 F.2d 1254, 1257 (7th Cir. 1993).3 For example, the Great American

3

Accord Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Gen’l Star Indemnity Co., 183 F.3d 578, 583 (7th Cir. 1999)
(the “insurer (the subrogee) acquires no greater or lesser rights than those of the insured (the subrogor).”);
Certain Underwriters of Lloyd’s v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am., 909 F.2d 228, 232 (7th Cir. 1990)
(“A subrogee, however, acquires no greater or lesser rights than those possessed by the subrogor.”);
Lee R. Russ, Couch on Insurance § 224:180 (3d ed. 2012) (“Since a subrogee stands in the shoes of its
subrogor, a subrogated insurer has no greater rights against a third party than those of the insured, and its
claims are subject to all defenses the third party could have asserted against the insured.”).

4
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 5 of 12 Document 1493

Insurance case cited above involved an insurer’s suit against the United States for recoupment of
insurance payments for damage to its insureds’ property allegedly allowed by government
employees. Great Am. Ins., 575 F.2d at 1032-33. The district court and the Second Circuit both
held that the insurer’s exclusive remedy was a derivative right of subrogation to pursue the
insured’s potential claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Id. at 1034-35 (“the authorities
and the cases unanimously hold that the insurer’s recovery is premised exclusively upon
subrogation”); accord Rock Island Bank v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co., 692 F.2d 1100, 1106 (7th
Cir. 1982) (citing and quoting Great Am. Ins). Applying well-established subrogation principles,
the Second Circuit found that it was “not difficult” to conclude that the indemnitor could have no
broader, independent rights or remedies against the United States for recoupment of the
indemnity payments. Great Am. Ins., 575 F.2d at 1032, 1034-35.
The same basic rules of subrogation apply when the indemnitor has only provided partial
indemnity, such as by paying the full amount due except for a deductible borne by the insured.
As the Seventh Circuit has explained:
[A]n insurer who pays a part of the loss of its insured is only partially subrogated
to the insured’s rights. 6A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane,
Federal Practice and Procedure § 1546 (2d ed. 1990). In such a case, “both
insured and the insurer ‘own’ portions of the substantive right and should appear
in the litigation in their own names.” [United States v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co.,
338 U.S. 366, 381 (1949)] . . . . Thus, if an insured brings suit against a
tortfeasor, the insurer who is partially subrogated may intervene in the action to
protect its pro rata share of the potential recovery. 6A Wright, Miller & Kane
§ 1546.
Krueger v. Cartwright, 996 F.2d 928, 932 (7th Cir. 1993). As a partial indemnitor that is obliged
to reimburse 60% of NCR’s costs for this Site, API may deserve to remain involved in this case
– including any appeal – to protect its interest in a share of any potential recovery on NCR’s
contribution claims under CERCLA Section 113. But API has no separate and independent
claims against other PRPs that it can pursue on its own under CERCLA Section 107.

2.

CERCLA Does Not Broaden the Claims that API Can Assert.

Several cases have made clear that CERCLA does not expand the universe of available
claims for recovery of indemnity payments beyond those that the indemnitor is entitled to assert
as a subrogee.
In California Department of Toxic Substances Control v. City of Chico, the court
considered whether an insurer for a set of affiliated PRPs could assert its own non-derivative
claims to recover response costs under Section 107(a)(4)(B) “as an innocent party under
CERCLA.” 297 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1231 (E.D. Cal. 2004). Much like API is attempting to do
here, the indemnitor in City of Chico alleged that it had made significant outlays for “response
costs for which it bears no responsibility,” glossing over the fact that its payments were owed
under an indemnity relationship with certain PRPs. Id. at 1232. But the court saw through that
façade and limited the indemnitor to claims that it could bring as a subrogee of its insureds. Id.
at 1233-36. In reaching that outcome, the court emphasized that “in a subrogation action, [the
indemnitor] cannot divorce itself from its insured’s status as a PRP.” Id. at 1234. Just like the
insurer in City of Chico, API may have subrogation rights that derive from contribution rights
that NCR may possess, but API cannot assert non-derivative claims of its own, including claims
to recover response costs under Section 107(a)(4)(B).
Another district court endorsed and applied the City of Chico court’s reasoning in
American International Specialty Lines Insurance Co. v. United States, No. C 04-01591 CRB,
2005 WL 680159 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2005) (“AISLIC”). In that case, an insurer for the current
owner of land sued the United States directly under CERCLA, alleging that the property had
been contaminated when it was previously owned by the Navy. Id. at *1. The insurer in AISLIC
seemed to concede that that it could only assert claims as a subrogee of its insured, but the court

6
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 7 of 12 Document 1493

still underscored the rule that an insurer seeking to recover sums it paid on behalf of its insured
“may recover under CERCLA only through a subrogation action.” Id. at *3-4.4
In another recent case, the Ninth Circuit took a step beyond City of Chico and AISLIC in
considering the interplay between two separate CERCLA provisions that reference subrogation
rights. See Chubb Custom Ins. Co. v. Space Sys./Loral, Inc., 710 F.3d 946, 952-72 (9th Cir.
2013). First, CERCLA Section 112(c)(2) provides that:
Any person, including the [EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund], who pays
compensation pursuant to this chapter to any claimant for damages or costs
resulting from a release of a hazardous substance shall be subrogated to all rights,
claims, and causes of action for such damages and costs of removal that the
claimant has under this chapter or any other law.
42 U.S.C. § 9612(c)(2). Second, CERCLA Section 107(e)(2) includes a “savings clause” that
preserves potential subrogation claims:
Nothing in this subchapter . . . shall bar a cause of action that an owner or
operator or any other person subject to liability under this section, or a guarantor,
has or would have, by reason of subrogation or otherwise against any person.
Id. at § 9607(e)(2).
The Chubb court held that the requirements of CERCLA Section 112 narrow
indemnitors’ subrogation rights under CERCLA – and effectively preclude potentially broader
common law-based equitable subrogation claims – notwithstanding the savings clause in Section
107(e)(2). 710 F.3d at 960-72. But this Court does not need to reach that question to resolve

4

In both City of Chico and AISLIC the courts actually dismissed the indemnitors’ subrogation
claims because they were unripe under the common law “made-whole” doctrine. Id. at *4; City of Chico,
297 F. Supp. 2d at 1236-37. Under that timing rule, an insurer “may not enforce a right to subrogation
until the insured has been fully compensated, that is, has been made whole.” City of Chico, 297 F. Supp.
2d at 1236; cf. Drinkwater v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 714 N.W. 2d 568, 571 (Wis. 2006) (“The madewhole doctrine in Wisconsin has deep and firm roots.”). If applied here, the made-whole doctrine might
preclude API’s pursuit of subrogation claims, because API apparently has not even reimbursed NCR for
its share of the cleanup costs that NCR incurred last year. See E.D. Wis. No. 10-cv-910, Dkt. 790 at 4 n.2
(“At present, API’s unpaid obligation to NCR for 2012 remediation is approximately $40 million.”).

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 8 of 12 Document 1493

API’s reconsideration motion.5 As the Chubb court recognized, even under the common law
equitable subrogation doctrine, “[a]n important limit to the right of subrogation is that it is a
purely derivative right – meaning that the subrogee succeeds to rights no greater than those of the
subrogor.” Id. at 957. Here, API could not bring Section 107 claims even under equitable
subrogation principles, because this Court has correctly ruled that NCR cannot bring Section 107
claims and because API can have no greater rights than its subrogor. The Court should deny
API’s reconsideration motion for that reason and for the related reasons detailed herein.
