U.S. PAPER'S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO APPLETON
PAPERS' MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE COURT'S DISMISSAL OF ITS
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF UNDER CERCLA § 1071
INTRODUCTION
API's motion should be denied because API has demonstrated no manifest error or
significant change in law or fact that would justify reconsideration. API's asserted basis — the
Court's determination that API is not liable under CERCLA — does not change API's liability as
NCR's indemnitor. As NCR's indemnitor, API has no CERCLA 107 claim because it did not
incur CERCLA response costs. API provided no basis to ignore its own allegations in its Eighth
Amended Complaint (Dkt. 1438) and its earlier statements to this Court in the Enforcement
Action2 that its payments were made due to its indemnity obligations to NCR. For those
payments, API stands in NCR's shoes and is bound by the Court's decision that NCR cannot
recover them from the defendants. Because API has never alleged it paid more than its

ARGUMENT
I.

API HAS PRESENTED NO BASIS TO RECONSIDER DISMISSAL OF ITS
CERCLA 107 CLAIM.
Motions for reconsideration are disfavored. Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese

Sales, Inc., 906 F.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir. 1990). Such a motion must be based on a manifest
error of law or fact or a significant change in law or fact. Id. API has presented neither. API
suggests that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Bernstein v. Bankert, 702 F.3d 964 (7th Cir. 2012)
provides a circumstance to warrant reconsideration of this Court's dismissal of its Section
107 Claim. But API does not assert that Bernstein significantly changed the law. In fact,
Bernstein favorably cited the very decision API now seeks to have reconsidered. See Bernstein,
703 F3d at 982-83.
API's sole basis for its motion is this Court's determination in the Enforcement Action
that it was not a liable party under CERCLA Section 107. But as API itself asserted to convince
this Court to dismiss it from the Enforcement action, that finding did nothing to change API's
obligation to indemnify NCR for 60% of NCR's CERCLA liability.
When API moved for summary judgment in the Enforcement Action, it told this Court:
"The sole obligation of API regarding the Fox River Contamination is as a
partial indemnitor (jointly and severally with BAT) to NCR pursuant to the
1998 Settlement Agreement, which does not impose CERCLA liability on API
or make API liable to the Government at all." EA Dkt 197 at p. 16-17.3
In the accompanying footnote, API also stated:

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 2 of 8 Document 1494

"A ruling by this Court that API did not assume NCR's CERCLA liabilities will
not affect API's indemnification obligations to NCR. Those obligations arise
under the 1998 Settlement Agreement . . . ." Id. at n.6.
API reaffirmed its position as NCR's indemnitor in its Eighth Amended Complaint, alleging a
subrogation right should NCR have a claim against Certain Defendants. As discussed next, API
stands in NCR's shoes concerning the payments required by its indemnity obligations and its
right to recover them has been fully litigated. Because API has not even attempted to assert that
it has paid more than its indemnity obligations require, it has not met its burden to demonstrate a
significant change of fact as a basis for reconsideration.

II.

AS NCR'S INDEMNITOR, API HAS NO REMAINING CERCLA CLAIMS
AGAINST U.S. PAPER OR THE OTHER DEFENDANTS.
API has no recoverable CERCLA costs or damages under either CERCLA Section 107

or CERCLA Section 113(f) because it is out of pocket nothing beyond what it contractually
obligated itself to pay, and that obligation was reduced to a final, binding judgment nine months
before the government even issued its Section 106 Order. The federal judgment confirmed an
arbitration panel's 2005 decision that API owes 60% of NCR's environmental obligations arising
from PCB contamination of the Lower Fox River under its 1998 Settlement Agreement with
NCR. EA Dkt. 197 at 7; Dkt. 144-3. API failed to support its motion with evidence that it has
paid any sum in excess of its pre-existing indemnity obligations. API cannot recover its
payments as NCR's indemnitor because it stands in NCR's shoes, and NCR's CERCLA claims
have been fully litigated and rejected.
An indemnitor stands in the shoes and therefore has no greater rights than its indemnitee.
Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Federal Express Inc., 136 F.2d 35, 38 (6th Cir. 1943); Advanced
Ground Systems Engineering Inc. v. RTW Industr. Inc., 388 F.3d 1036, 1042 (7th Cir. 2004).
Because NCR has been determined to be 100% liable and has no right of recovery against

3
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 3 of 8 Document 1494

U.S. Paper and the other defendants, see Whiting Dkt. 795, API has no right of recovery against
U.S. Paper and the other defendants either. It is not true, as API argues, that it has no recourse if
it cannot pass its obligations onto U.S. Paper and the other defendants. Like U.S. Paper and the
other defendants, API's recourse is against the party that was found 100% responsible for the
ensuing PCB pollution--NCR. But API settled its claims against NCR years ago, and, as NCR's
indemnitor, it has no claims against U.S. Paper and the other defendants. It would be inequitable
to allow API to recover from U.S. Paper and the other defendants in these circumstances. The
Court should deny API's motion to reconsider.
As NCR's contractual indemnitor, API lacks standing to recover its payments under either
Sections 107 or 113 of CERCLA. See Calif. Dept. of Toxic Substances Control v. City of Chico,
297 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1233 (E.D. Cal. 2004); Chubb Customer Ins. Co. v. Space Sys./Loral, Inc.,
710 F.3d 946 (9th Cir. 2013). In City of Chico the Court dismissed an insurer's CERCLA
Section 107 and 113 claims because it was not a PRP and "[the insurer] did not incur any
response costs; rather it has indemnified [a PRP] for [its] response costs. Its involvement with
the . . . Site is exclusively in its capacity as [the PRP's] insurer." Id. at 1232. The Ninth Circuit
came to the same conclusion in Chubb, holding that an insurer who reimbursed its insured for
response costs did not have standing to bring a Section 107 claim because it had not incurred its
own response costs. Because API's sole obligation regarding the Fox River contamination was
in its capacity as NCR's indemnitor, API is not a "person" who incurred response costs under
CERCLA Section 107. So, like any other insurer or indemnitor, API has no CERCLA claims.
API argues that it must be allowed to recover under § 107(a) if injustice is to be avoided.
API is wrong. It would be unjust to let API use CERCLA to shift its own contractual indemnity
obligations to U.S. Paper and the other defendants. API offered no authority that allowed an
indemnitor like API to assert a claim under Section 107 of CERCLA after the indemnitee's

4
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 4 of 8 Document 1494

CERCLA claims have been litigated and rejected. As NCR's indemnitor, API paid 60% of
NCR's CERCLA liabilities and seeks to shift that portion of NCR's CERCLA liability to the
comparatively innocent PRPs even though, as indemnitor, API has no contribution or
indemnification claim against them because it stands in the shoes of a vastly more culpable PRP.
Allowing API to use Section 107 in that manner would create injustice, not avoid it.
API argues that it paid because of the Section 106 Order, not because of its indemnity
obligation and the federal judgment that required those payments. API relies heavily on the
Seventh Circuit's decision in Bernstein v. Bankert, 702 F.3d 964 (7th Cir. 2012), to argue that a
CERCLA 113 claim is not triggered by the Section 106 Order and therefore no statutory
triggering event has occurred to provide it with a CERCLA 113 claim that would preclude its
107 claim. But the 2001 Consent Decree (and extensions) and the enforcement actions brought
against API to lodge them provided the statutory trigger under CERCLA Section 113. API, sideby-side with NCR, litigated their 113 claim to its conclusion and lost. The Court found that the
allocation applicable to NCR (including API's 60% share) is 100%.
API is not being candid when it asserts its payments were made pursuant to the
Section 106 Order. API did not receive the Section 106 Order until November of 2007. By that
time, API already knew that its settlement with NCR (as confirmed by a federal judgment)
required it to pay 60% of NCR's CERCLA obligations, and it already had begun paying them.
By the time it received the Section 106 Order, API had already:
•

Paid response costs and natural resource damages ("NRDs") through its
agreement with the State of Wisconsin in January 1997 (Compl., Dkt. 1 at ¶¶ 1415).

•

Paid response costs and NRDs under its 2001 consent decree with NCR and the
government (Compl., Dkt. 1 at ¶ 16).

5
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 5 of 8 Document 1494

•

Extended its obligations under the 2001 Consent Decree through a December
2005 consent decree (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 16).

•

Contributed funds for remedial work under the March 2004 consent decree among
Georgia-Pacific, NCR and the government (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 19).

•

Contributed funds for remedial work under the 2006 Phase I consent decree
signed only by NCR and U.S. Paper (Dkt. 1, ¶ 20).

All of that work was done and all of those payments were made prior to the November 2007
Section 106 Order that API now claims compelled it to incur those costs. In the end, the
argument is a red herring because API was and is obligated to pay 60% of NCR's CERCLA
liability in any event, and it never has claimed to have paid a penny more. It cannot recover any
of those payments or any subsequent payments because it stands in NCR's shoes and NCR
cannot recover any of it due to its overwhelming culpability.
API took great pains to align itself as NCR's indemnitor when it sought to avoid
CERCLA Section 107 liability. API argued in its brief in support of its motion for summary
judgment in the Enforcement Action that the "sole obligation of API regarding the Fox River
contamination is as a partial indemnitor (jointly and severally with BAT) to NCR pursuant to
the 1998 Settlement Agreement." (EA Dkt. 197 at pp. 16-17, emphasis added). See also EA
Dkt. 138-1 at p. 9 ("API's obligations to NCR under the 1998 Settlement Agreement are,
therefore, analogous to those of an indemnitor. As a matter of law, an agreement to indemnify
does not render the indemnitor a liable party under CERCLA in its own right.") API also
pointed to Judge Zuidmulder's decision in Columbia Casualty v. Appleton Papers, Inc., Brown
County Case No. 05-CV-36, to say that it had already been judicially determined that the 1998
Settlement Agreement and 2005 arbitration decision were not an assumption of liability, but
rather a cost-sharing arrangement between NCR and API, in the event that either of them was,

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 6 of 8 Document 1494

eventually, determined to be liable parties under CERCLA" (EA Dkt. 143 at p. 21, emphasis
added). API repeatedly assured this Court that any ruling by the Court that API did not assume
NCR's liability would not affect its indemnification obligations to NCR since those obligations
arose under the 1998 Settlement Agreement (EA Dkt. 124-1 at pp. 16-18; EA Dkt. 197, p. 16
n.6). This Court accepted API's argument, finding it is merely NCR's indemnitor and dismissing
the government's CERCLA claims against API. (EA Dkt. 349). Having represented itself to this
Court as NCR's indemnitor to avoid Section 107 liability, API cannot now say otherwise. See
New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001) (A party that succeeds in maintaining a
certain position in a legal proceeding may not, simply because its interests have changed, assume
a contrary position in the same case or in a separate lawsuit, particularly where it would
prejudice the other party involved. This rule of judicial estoppel "prevents a party from
prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to
prevail in another phase.") So, API must be held to its prior position and this Court's finding
based on that position — API's "sole obligation" regarding the Fox River contamination is and
always has been as NCR's indemnitor.4

III.

EVEN IF API HAD A CERCLA CLAIM, IT WOULD BE LIMITED TO A
SECTION 112 SUBROGATION CLAIM THAT IS NO LONGER VIABLE
SINCE NCR IS 100 PERCENT LIABLE.
API brought its CERCLA Section 112 claim in its Eighth Amended Complaint. NCR has

no prospect of a recovery to which API would be subrogated in light of the determination that
NCR is 100 percent culpable and not entitled to recover from U.S. Paper and the other
defendants. Acknowledging that position, API stipulated to dismissal of that claim as part of the

4

Having filed its Eighth Amended Complaint seeking subrogation claims under CERCLA Section 112 and common
law, API has reconfirmed its position as NCR's indemnitor.

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 7 of 8 Document 1494

stipulated judgment filed in this case (Dkt. 1481 and 1481-1 at 4). API has no further CERCLA
claims.

CONCLUSION
API has not provided a proper basis for reconsideration of the Court's dismissal of its
CERCLA 107 claim. API has presented no manifest error or significant change in law or fact.
In any event, API has incurred no recoverable CERCLA costs and therefore has no CERCLA
claims against U.S. Paper and the other defendants. API's payments were required as NCR's
indemnitor, regardless of its own CERCLA liability. Because API stands in NCR's shoes and
NCR has no claim against U.S. Paper and the other defendants under either Sections 107 or 113,
API has no such claims either and its motion to reconsider dismissal of its CERCLA 107 claim
should be denied.
