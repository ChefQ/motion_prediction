COMPANY, et al.,
Defendants.
GEORGIA-PACIFIC’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF APPLETON
PAPERS INC.’S MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE COURT’S DISMISSAL
OF ITS CLAIMS FOR RELIEF UNDER CERCLA § 107

INTRODUCTION
This Court was correct in dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim. As a potentially liable
party, API had a claim for contribution under CERCLA § 113. Neither this Court’s subsequent
finding of non-liability nor any intervening case law suggest reversal of this Court’s prior
conclusion that API’s claim for contribution under CERCLA § 113 precludes it from bringing a
claim for cost recovery under CERCLA § 107. Having pursued to finality its CERCLA § 113
claim, API has no claim under CERCLA § 107, and the only form of relief available to it under
CERCLA is § 106(b) – which API is already pursuing in a parallel matter. Moreover, API
cannot have a CERCLA § 107 claim because API has not itself incurred any response costs.
Rather, API is contractually obligated to indemnify NCR for 60% of the response costs NCR
incurs at the Fox River Site. It would be unjust – and would give API an enormous windfall – if
API could continue to re-litigate the same issues under CERCLA in an attempt to use the statute

to shift its own indemnity obligations to innocent parties who were among the casualties of
NCR’s culpable behavior.
ARGUMENT

I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
API has moved for reconsideration of the Court’s August 8, 2008 decision and order

granting Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss API’s CERCLA § 107 claims. Dkt. #1489. A motion
for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) serves a very limited function:
“to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.” See
Rothwell Cotton Co. v. Rosenthal & Co., 827 F.2d 246, 251 (7th Cir. 1987). “A manifest error is
not demonstrated by the disappointment of the losing party. It is the wholesale disregard,
misapplication, or failure to recognize controlling precedent.” Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.
v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC, 2013 WL 494073, *1 (E.D. Wisc. Feb. 7, 2013)
(Griesbach, J.) (quoting Oto v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 224 F.3d 601, 606 (7th Cir. 2000). “A
further basis for a motion to reconsider would be a controlling or significant change in the law or
facts since the submission of the issue to the Court.” Neal v. Honeywell, Inc., No. 93–1143,
1996 WL 627616, at *3 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 25, 1996) (quotation omitted). Furthermore, “[m] otions
for reconsideration [of interlocutory orders] generally are not encouraged.” Johnson v. City of
Kankakee, No. 04–2009, 2007 WL 1431874, at *1 (C.D.Ill. May 11, 2007) (quoting Wilson v.
Cahokia Sch. Dist. # 187, 470 F.Supp.2d 897, 913 (S.D.Ill. 2007)).

II.

API HAS A CERCLA § 113 CLAIM THAT IT HAS FULLY PURSUED IN
THIS CASE
API claims to have incurred costs complying with the UAO issued by the government on

November 13, 2007. In 2008, API sought to recover those costs under either CERCLA § 107 or

2
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 2 of 12 Document 1495

CERCLA § 113, the cost recovery and contribution provisions of CERCLA. This Court granted
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the CERCLA § 107 claim on the basis that any payments made
by API that exceeded its responsibility were recoverable under § 113(f) and therefore API could
not use §107 to recover those costs. Dkt. #227 at 13. There was no manifest error of law or fact
in this Court’s decision dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim. When API filed the Whiting
case, it had a § 113 claim, and it litigated that claim to finality. Regardless of any later finding of
non-liability, API had a contribution claim that it litigated through a final allocation.
This Court’s finding of non-liability in the Enforcement Case does not impact this
Court’s decision in this case dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim. Section 113 does not
require a party to be liable. Rather, CERCLA § 113 is available to any party “who is liable or
potentially liable” under CERCLA for response costs. 42 U.S.C. § 9413(f); see also United
States v. Atl. Research Corp., 551 U.S. 128, 138-139 (U.S. 2007) (“§ 113(f)(1) permits suit
before or after the establishment of common liability.”) As this Court explained in its order
dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim, “there is no requirement that [proof of common
liability] take the form of a prior judicial determination of liability.” Dkt. 227 at 14. API was a
potentially liable party when it filed its complaint, and remains potentially liable to this day. No
final judgment has been entered for this Court’s order on non-liability, and that order is subject
to appeal.
Opinions decided after this Court’s dismissal of API’s CERCLA § 107 claim support this
Court’s prior decision. API relies heavily on the Seventh Circuit’s recent decision in Bernstein
v. Bankert, 702 F.3d 964, 978-80 (7th Cir. 2012). Bernstein does not support API’s argument for
reconsideration because this Court’s order dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim was
consistent with the reasoning in Bernstein. In Bernstein the Seventh Circuit evaluated costs

3
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 3 of 12 Document 1495

incurred under two separate Administrative Orders separately to determine whether CERCLA §
113 had been triggered for both “buckets” of costs. 702 F.3d at 985. The Seventh Circuit
concluded that CERCLA § 113 had been triggered for one bucket but not for the other, and that
the plaintiff therefore had a CERCLA § 107 claim for one group of costs and a CERCLA § 113
claim for another group of costs. Like the Bernstein court, this Court considered whether each
“bucket” of costs alleged by API could be recovered under CERCLA § 113. This Court did not
conclude that, because the 2001 Consent Decree had triggered a right to contribution under
CERCLA § 113, any costs incurred by API at any time were recoverable only under CERCLA §
113. See Dkt. 227 at 13 (“If, on the other hand, some of their payments can not be recovered
under 113(f), then their § 107(a) claim survives.”). This Court concluded that the 2001 Consent
Decree triggered a 113 claim for any payments API made to discharge their potentially common
liability at the site. Dkt. #227 at 14. Bernstein does nothing to change that analysis. Indeed,
Bernstein only reinforces this Court’s decision by holding that a cost recovery action is
unavailable where a contribution action exists. 702 F.3d at 978-80.1
Because API has a valid CERCLA § 113 claim, this Court’s prior order dismissing its
CERCLA § 107 claim must stand. Indeed, this Court has repeatedly considered, evaluated, and
rejected API’s misplaced attempts to assert a CERCLA § 107 claim given the procedural posture
of this matter. In its July 5, 2011 Order dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim against
Georgia-Pacific in the Enforcement Case, for example, the Court explained that “I have
addressed at length the reasons why a PRP in the position of API and NCR cannot bring a § 107
claim against other PRPs” and noted that although “these matters have already been litigated at

The Bernstein court was well aware of this Court’s decision dismissing API’s CERCLA § 107 claim, and
cited the opinion favorably. 702 F.3d at 983.

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 4 of 12 Document 1495

great length . . . Nothing of substance has changed.” See Enforcement Action (“EA”), Dkt #171,
at 2-3. API should not be allowed to re-litigate an issue that has already been properly decided
by this Court. See, e.g., United States v. Menominee Tribal Enterprises, 2009 WL 1373952, *1
(E.D. Wisc. May 15, 2009) (Griesbach, J.) (denying motion for reconsideration and noting that
“[f]ederal district courts have hundreds of civil and criminal cases that require attention, and a redo of a matter that has already received the court’s attention is seldom a productive use of
taxpayer resources because it places all other matters on hold.”); Securities and Exchange
Commission v. Wealth Management, LLC, 2012 WL 2589319, *2 (E.D. Wisc. July 3, 2012)
(Griesbach, J.) (denying motion for reconsideration because“[a]llowing a do-over now would
waste judicial resources and would not serve the interests of justice.”).

III.

API HAS NOT INCURRED RESPONSE COSTS UNDER CERCLA § 107
Even if this Court were to conclude that API did not have a CERCLA § 113 claim, API

has no claim under CERCLA § 107 because it has incurred no response costs. Throughout its
brief, API ignores this basic pre-requisite to recovery. Instead, API jumps ahead to the argument
that, because it does not have a claim under CERCLA § 113, it must have a claim under
CERCLA § 107. API is wrong. API is out of pocket nothing beyond what it contractually
obligated itself to pay. In its 1998 Settlement Agreement with NCR, API obligated itself to pay
a portion of NCR’s costs arising from PCB contamination of the Lower Fox River. API did not
contractually agree to clean up the polluted site, nor did it agree to perform the actual cleanup.
In what API describes as a “private financial arrangement between API and NCR” that is “in the
nature of indemnity,” API agreed only to a contractual allocation of costs related to the cleanup
of the Fox River – an allocation that would be applied irrespective of API's actual liability at the
Site. EA Dkt. #197 at 1. That obligation was reduced to a final, binding judgment in February
2007 – nine months before the government even issued its Section 106 Order – when a federal

5
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 5 of 12 Document 1495

court confirmed an arbitration panel’s 2005 decision that API is obligated to reimburse NCR for
60% of its cleanup costs at the Fox River. EA Dkt. #197 at 7; EA Dkt. 144-3.
API’s status as NCR’s indemnitor has already been established by this Court. EA Dkt.
#349. API took great pains to describe itself as NCR’s indemnitor when it sought to avoid
CERCLA § 107 liability in the parallel enforcement case. API asserted in its brief in support of
its motion for summary judgment that the “sole obligation of API regarding the Fox River
contamination is as a partial indemnitor (jointly and severally with BAT) to NCR pursuant to
the 1998 Settlement Agreement.” EA Dkt. 197 at pp. 16-17, emphasis added. See also EA Dkt.
138-1 at p. 9 (“API’s obligations to NCR under the 1998 Settlement Agreement are, therefore,
analogous to those of an indemnitor. As a matter of law, an agreement to indemnify does not
render the indemnitor a liable party under CERCLA in its own right.”) API also pointed to
Judge Zuidmulder’s decision in Columbia Casualty v. Appleton Papers, Inc., Brown County
Case No. 05-CV-36, to say that it had already been judicially determined that the 1998
Settlement Agreement and the 2005 arbitration decision were not an assumption of liability, but
rather represent a cost-sharing arrangement between NCR and API, in the event that either of
them were, eventually, determined to be liable parties under CERCLA” EA Dkt. 143 at p. 21,
emphasis added. API repeatedly assured this Court that any ruling that API did not assume
NCR’s liability would not affect its indemnification obligations to NCR since those obligations
arose under the 1998 Settlement Agreement. EA Dkt. #124-1 at pp. 16-18; EA Dkt. #197, p. 16
n.6). Having represented itself to this Court as NCR’s indemnitor to avoid CERCLA § 107
liability, API cannot now say otherwise. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749
(2001) (A party that succeeds in maintaining a certain position in a legal proceeding may not,
simply because its interests have changed, assume a contrary position in the same case or in a

6
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 6 of 12 Document 1495

separate lawsuit, particularly where it would prejudice the other party involved. This rule of
judicial estoppel “prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and
then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.”) So, API must be held to
its prior position – its “sole obligation” regarding the Fox River contamination is and always has
been as NCR’s indemnitor.
As an indemnitor, API has not itself incurred response costs and cannot bring a CERCLA
§ 107 claim. As the Supreme Court has said:
§ 107(a) permits recovery of cleanup costs but does not create a right to
contribution. A private party may recover under § 107(a) without any
establishment of liability to a third party. Moreover, § 107(a) permits a PRP to
recover only the costs it has “incurred” in cleaning up a site. 42 U.S.C. §
9607(a)(4)(B). When a party pays to satisfy a settlement agreement or a court
judgment, it does not incur its own costs of response. Rather, it reimburses other
parties for costs that those parties incurred.
Atl. Research Corp., 551 U.S. at 139 (emphasis added). Here, it is clear that API is paying
pursuant to its settlement with NCR. EA Dkt. 197 at pp. 16-17 and EA Dkt. 138-1 at p. 9.
The Ninth Circuit recently upheld the dismissal of a CERCLA § 107 claim brought by an
insurer who, like API, had paid for environmental cleanup costs pursuant to a private agreement.
Chubb Custom Ins. v. Space Systems/Loral, Inc., 710 F.3d 946 (9th Cir. 2013). In Chubb, the
insurer had reimbursed its insured for $2.4 million dollars in environmental response costs
incurred by its insured in cleaning up a contaminated site. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the
insurer had no standing to bring suit under CERCLA 107(a) because it did not itself incur any
costs of response related to the removal or remediation of a polluted Site. Id. at 952-53, 962.
Because the insurer was only obligated pursuant to the agreement to reimburse the insured for
cleanup costs (not to conduct the cleanup), the insurer had not itself incurred response costs

7
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 7 of 12 Document 1495

within the meaning of CERCLA § 107. Id. at 962.2 The court concluded that, just as a PRP does
not incur its own costs of response by reimbursing other parties’ response costs, the insurer had
not incurred response costs “solely by virtue of reimbursing [the insured’s] response costs.” Id. at
964. So too here, where API as indemnitor has only reimbursed NCR for response costs NCR
incurred.
API acknowledges that, as an indemnitor, it is not liable for response costs under
CERCLA, but only contractually responsible for those costs pursuant to an independent
agreement. EA Dkt. # 197. Therefore, API, who has only reimbursed response costs pursuant
to contract, has not itself incurred response costs. See Chubb, 710 F.3d at 962. Likewise, in
Calif. Dept. of Toxic Substances Control v. City of Chico, 297 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1233 (E.D. Cal.
2004), the court dismissed an insurer’s CERCLA §§ 107 and 113 claims because it was not a
PRP and “[the insurer] has not incurred any response costs; rather it has indemnified [a PRP]
for [its] response costs. Its involvement with the . . . Site is exclusively in its capacity as [the
PRP’s] insurer.” Id. at 1232 (emphasis added). Because API’s sole obligation regarding
payment for cleanup of the Fox River contamination was in its capacity as NCR’s indemnitor,
API has not incurred response costs under CERCLA § 107. So, like any other insurer or
indemnitor who has not incurred response costs, API has no claim under CERCLA § 107.
Indeed, the sole basis for API’s argument that it has a CERCLA § 107 claim is that it
does not have a CERCLA § 113 claim. But API did have a CERCLA § 113 claim. It litigated
and lost that claim along with NCR. Furthermore, in each of the cases cited by API in support of

2

Although in Chubb, the insurer reimbursed the insured for cleanup costs after the cleanup was completed,
the timing of the payments is irrelevant. Neither the agreement nor the arbitration award to which API is bound
specify the manner in which payment is to be made, and neither obligate API to pay vendors directly. The manner
in which API opted to structure its payment is irrelevant to the ultimate fact that – as API has repeatedly argued API’s only obligation was to indemnify NCR for response costs incurred by NCR.

8
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 8 of 12 Document 1495

its argument, there was no dispute that the party permitted to bring a CERCLA § 107 claim (due
to the absence of a § 113 claim) had itself incurred costs of response. See API Br., Dkt. # 1490,
at 8-9; Bernstein v. Bankert, 702 F.3d 964 (7th Cir. 2012) (response costs were incurred for work
undertaken pursuant to Administrative Orders on Consent); Solutia, Inc. v. McWane, Inc., 726
F.Supp.2d 1316 (N.D. Ala. 2010) (plaintiff incurred response costs by conducting cleanup work
itself); Morrison Enterprises, LLC v. Dravo Corp., No, 08-CV-3142, 2009 WL 4330224 (D,
Neb. Nov. 24, 2009) (same); W.R. Grace & Co. – Conn. v. Zotos Int’l, Inc., 559 F.3d 85 (2d Cir.
2009) (plaintiff PRP itself incurred costs by investigating and remediating the site); Ford Motor
Co. v. Mich. Consol. Gas Co., No. 08-CV-13503, 2009 WL 3190418 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 29, 2009)
(plaintiffs incurred costs by conducting response activities). That is not the case here, where API
as indemnitor has not itself incurred response costs.
API’s citations to this Court’s prior opinions are similarly irrelevant. When this Court
first dismissed API’s CERCLA § 107 claim in August 2008, it did so because CERCLA § 113
was available to API. Dkt. 227 at 11. At that time, API alleged that it was jointly and severally
liable with the other PRPs and the effect of API's status as NCR's indemnitor was not before the
Court. API eventually asserted its indemnitor status. In April 2012, this Court concluded in the
enforcement action that API is not liable under CERCLA for Fox River costs. EA Dkt. 349; API
Br. at 6. API’s briefing of its motion for non-liability under CERCLA clearly asserted that its
only obligation for Fox River costs was in its capacity as NCR’s indemnitor pursuant to a private
agreement. See supra at 6-7. In light of API’s position as indemnitor, this Court must now
conclude that API cannot have a CERCLA § 107 claim because it has not itself incurred
response costs.

IV.

API’S RELIEF UNDER CERCLA IS TO PURSUE REIMBURSEMENT
FROM THE SUPERFUND UNDER § 106(B)(2)(C)
If API has, as it claims, incurred response costs as an innocent party, its remedy is

reimbursement from the Superfund under CERCLA § 106(b)(2). Section 106(b)(2) allows any
person who has complied with an administrative order issued by EPA or another federal agency
under section 106(a) of CERCLA to petition for reimbursement of the reasonable costs incurred
in complying with the order, plus interest. 42 U.S.C. § 9606(b)(2). To establish a claim for
reimbursement, a petitioner must demonstrate it was not liable for response costs under
CERCLA § 107(a).
The Seventh Circuit has expressly recognized CERCLA § 106(b)(2) as the appropriate
mechanism for relief for a party wrongfully forced to incur response costs. Employers Ins. v.
Browner, 52 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir. 1995) (identifying CERCLA § 106(b)(2) as an available
route of recovery for an allegedly innocent party to recover cleanup costs incurred under a
government order); see also Kelley v. EPA, 15 F.3d 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (recognizing the
ability of parties who have incurred response costs to seek reimbursement under CERCLA §
106(b)(2)). No party is more aware of this avenue of relief than API, who has already petitioned
EPA for reimbursement of response costs.
On June 8, 2012, API filed with the Environmental Appeals Board a Petition for
Reimbursement of Costs under CERLCA § 106(b)(2)(C) seeking reimbursement of $174 million
in costs. EA Dkt. #436 at Ex. 1. API’s Petition was dismissed without prejudice as not ripe for
review on December 18, 2012, because this Court’s order on non-liability was subject to revision
before entry of final judgment or reversal on appeal. Id. at 5. If API truly believes that it was
wrongfully forced to incur response costs in compliance with the EPA’s 2007 UAO, it can re-

10
Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 05/13/13 Page 10 of 12 Document 1495

assert that claim before the Environmental Appeals Board when the matter is ripe for review.
API is in no way precluded from re-filing its Petition when the matter is ripe for review. Id. at 7.

CONCLUSION
API has already fully prosecuted the CERCLA § 113 claim that this Court held in 2008
was available to it. Neither this Court’s order on non-liability nor any intervening case law
changes that. API cannot have a CERCLA § 107 claim because, as an indemnitor, API has
merely reimbursed NCR for response costs and stands in the shoes of NCR. API cannot now
claim that it has, in fact, itself incurred response costs and is entitled to a claim under CERCLA §
107. Permitting a CERCLA § 107 claim here would allow API to shift its own contractual
obligations to other parties, who the court has here concluded should not be responsible for any
of the costs of cleaning up the Fox River Site. The proper mechanism for API to seek relief is a
petition for reimbursement under CERCLA is § 106(b)(2), which API is already pursuing.
