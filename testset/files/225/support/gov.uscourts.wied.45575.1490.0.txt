MEMORANDUM OF PLAINTIFF APPLETON PAPERS INC.
IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE COURT’S DISMISSAL
OF ITS CLAIMS FOR RELIEF UNDER CERCLA § 107
Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. (“API”), by its undersigned counsel, respectfully
submits this Memorandum in support of its motion to reconsider the court’s dismissal of
its claims for relief under CERCLA § 107.
INTRODUCTION
This motion is prompted by the Court’s March 29, 2013 decision in the
Enforcement Action (Case No. 10-C-910) which dismissed API’s CERCLA § 107 crossclaims in that action. EA Dkt. 787.1 In its decision, the Court acknowledged the unique
circumstances presented here, where API was named as a liable party in the 106 Order,
compelled to incur more than $100 million in remediation costs pursuant to that Order,
and then was found to have no liability under CERCLA. The Court correctly observed
that “these are unique procedural circumstances that other courts have not addressed.”

Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 1 of 22 Document 1490

To date, this Court has not squarely addressed the proper remedy for a party in
API’s position. The Court dismissed API’s original § 107 claims in Whiting in August
2008 — long before the Court ruled on April 10, 2012, that API has no CERCLA
liability. EA Dkt. 349 (“No Liability Decision”). The motions to dismiss API’s § 107
cross-claims in the Enforcement Action, filed just a few weeks after the No Liability
Decision was rendered, seemed to present an opportunity to consider the question, and
the parties’ briefs addressed the merits of the issue. In its March 29 decision, however,
the Court declined to address the issue because it concluded the matter should be
addressed in Whiting: “Simply put, the fact that there happens to be another, later-filed
civil action involving the same parties does not give a party license to restate claims that
have been addressed in the earlier-filed action.” Dkt. 787 at 2. The Court continued that:
“If circumstances warrant revisiting any decisions in Whiting, API may move for
reconsideration on that basis in the other case,” i.e., in Whiting. Id. API believes that the
No Liability Decision and CERCLA case law developments, including a recent Seventh
Circuit decision, have created just such circumstances. Therefore, following the guidance
of the Court and to ensure the issue is preserved for appeal (since it has not been squarely
addressed in either pending action), API now brings this motion.
CERCLA §§ 107 and 113 provide remedies to parties in different procedural
postures. United States v. Atlantic Research Corp., 551 U.S. 128, 138 (2007). If a party
has incurred response costs pursuant to one of the triggering events under § 113(f), then
the party can pursue contribution for such costs. Id. If not, then the party is entitled to
pursue a § 107 cost recovery claim. Id. at 139. This Court has embraced those principles
in its earlier decisions addressing API’s § 107 claims, stating that the “operative

-2Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 2 of 22 Document 1490

principle” is that “§ 107(a) is available to recover payments only in cases where § 113(f)
is not.” Dkt. 227 at 11.
Here, the Government issued a 106 Order to API and subsequently sued API to
enforce that Order (and for other relief). Based on recent CERCLA case law interpreting
§ 113(f), it is now clear that it was only the filing of the Government’s lawsuit in 2010
that triggered a right to pursue contribution for costs related to the 106 Order. The
Government alleged facts in the Enforcement Action which, if proven, meant that API
had a common liability to clean up the Lower Fox River under the 106 Order.
The Government, however, failed to prove such allegations and the Court ruled
that API has no CERCLA liability. EA Dkt. 349. The statutory trigger for a § 113(f)
claim was thus dismissed against API. Since API was determined to have no CERCLA
liability, its 106 Order costs could not be the subject of a contribution claim since they
did not result from payment of a disproportionate share of a common liability. As a
result, API’s remedy for the costs it has incurred in complying with the 106 Order lies
under § 107. As this Court has stated:
[P]arties who do not have access to § 113(a) [sic] . . . because they are
completely innocent and do not share common liability with any PRPs . . . must
be allowed to recover under § 107(a) if injustice is to be avoided.

Dkt. 227 at 12.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
In February 1996, the United States Fish & Wildlife Service designated API as a
potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for PCB contamination in the Lower Fox River. In
July 1997, API received a special notice letter from the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) which invited API, along with other PRPs, to make a good
faith offer to undertake the remedial investigation of the Lower Fox River.

In August 2001, the United States and the State of Wisconsin filed a civil action
under CERCLA §§ 106 and 107 in the Eastern District of Wisconsin seeking entry of a
consent decree (“2001 Consent Decree”) they had negotiated with API and NCR. United
States of America and State of Wisconsin v. Appleton Papers Inc. and NCR Corporation,
Case No. 01-C-0816 (“2001 Civil Action”). 2001 Dkt. 1.2 In the 2001 Consent Decree,
NCR and API agreed, among other things, to pay a prescribed amount to fund certain
discrete response actions and natural resource damages restoration projects in order that
“knowledge gained can be utilized in selecting and implementing future response action
projects and restoration projects”:
This Consent Decree is intended to advance the following purposes: providing
interim funding for response action projects and natural resource damage
restoration projects at the Site; acquiring knowledge from projects performed
under this Consent Decree, so that knowledge gained can be utilized in
selecting and implementing future response action projects and restoration
projects; providing partial reimbursement of past natural resource damage
assessment cost for the Site paid by DOI; and providing an opportunity for the
parties to focus on negotiations concerning potential resolution of the
Defendants’ alleged liability for the Site, as well as their potential counterclaims.

2001 Dkt. 13, ¶ 4 (emphasis added).3
The 2001 Consent Decree was entered in December 2001 and, after an extension
(id., Dkt. 17, ¶ 4), terminated by its terms on December 9, 2006. Id., ¶ 40.
In November 2007, the United States issued a Unilateral Administrative Order
pursuant to CERCLA § 106 (“UAO” or “106 Order”) which ordered eight parties,
including API, to implement the Government’s remediation plan for OUs 2-5 of the
Lower Fox River. Dkt. 149, ¶ 54. The Government asserted that the parties named in the

API did not admit any CERCLA liability in the 2001 Consent Decree. 2001 Dkt. 13, ¶ J
(“. . . the Defendants do not admit any liability arising out of the transactions or occurrences alleged in the
complaint.”). API also reserved the right “to bring contribution and other actions against persons who are
not Parties to this Consent Decree to recover those amounts paid hereunder.” Id., ¶ 36.

106 Order were liable under CERCLA for PCB contamination in the Lower Fox River.
The Government alleged that API was liable as a successor to Appleton Coated Paper
Company and Combined Paper Mills.
API and NCR filed this action in January 2008. API asserted claims under
CERCLA §§ 107 and 113 against defendants that included parties named in the
106 Order. Dkt. 149. At the time the action was filed, CERCLA § 113(h) barred judicial
review in the Whiting action of “any order issued under section 9606(a) of this title,”
which included allegations in the UAO that API was liable under CERCLA.4
In August 2008, this Court granted a motion to dismiss API’s § 107 claim, ruling
that the sole CERCLA remedy available to API was a claim for contribution under § 113.
Dkt. 227. In 2009, following the Supreme Court’s decision in Burlington Northern &
Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, 556 U.S. 599 (2009), API and NCR sought leave to
file an amended § 107 claim.

The Court in November 2009 denied the motion,

reiterating that a claim for contribution under § 113 was the sole CERCLA remedy
available to API and NCR. Dkt. 751.
In December 2009, the Court ruled that API and NCR were not entitled to
contribution and entered summary judgment against them. Dkt. 795.
In October 2010, the Government commenced an action in which it sought,
among other things, an injunction compelling API and the other parties named in the
106 Order to comply with its requirements (“Enforcement Action”). EA Dkt. 30, ¶¶ 129132. The filing of the Enforcement Action lifted the statutory bar on judicial review of
4

While CERCLA § 113(h) barred direct judicial review in Whiting of the allegation in the
106 Order that API was liable under CERCLA, API never conceded its liability under CERCLA in the
Whiting Action, as this Court has expressly ruled. Dkt. 1139 at 1 (“Appleton Papers is correct that there
was no basis to conclude that it had ‘conceded’ its liability in this action”).

-5Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 5 of 22 Document 1490

the 106 Order and allowed API to challenge the Government’s assertion that API was
liable under CERCLA. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(h)(2). In its Answer, API denied any
liability under CERCLA. EA Dkt. 65, ¶ 54. API also asserted counterclaims against the
Government and a cross-claim against Georgia Pacific seeking relief under CERCLA
§ 107. Id. at 40-58.5 The claims were premised, in part, on API’s defense that it was not
liable under CERCLA. Id. at 46, ¶ 45.
In January and February 2011, Georgia Pacific and the Government filed motions
to dismiss API’s cross-claims and counterclaims. EA Dkt. 83, 106. API opposed the
motions, in part, on the ground that API would be entitled to sue under § 107 if the Court
determined that it has no CERCLA liability. EA Dkt. 96, 119. In May 2011, while the
motions were pending, API filed § 107 cross-claims against remaining Defendants in the
Enforcement Action.

EA Dkt. 163.

By a subsequent stipulation, the deadline for

responding to the cross-claims was extended until May 2012. EA Dkt. 166.
In July 2011, the Court granted the motions to dismiss API’s counterclaims
against the Government and cross-claims against Georgia Pacific in the Enforcement
Action. EA Dkt. 171.
On April 10, 2012, the Court granted API’s motion for summary judgment in the
Enforcement Action, holding that API is not liable under CERCLA for Fox River costs.
EA Dkt. 349. Based on that decision, the Court subsequently dismissed all CERCLA
counterclaims asserted against API in Whiting. Dkt. 1437 at 7 (“It would make little
sense to proceed with CERCLA counterclaims in this action against API after having
concluded that API is not liable under CERCLA.”).
5
API and the other defendants in the Enforcement Action had stipulated to defer the deadline for
the filing of cross-claims. EA Dkt. 72.

-6Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 6 of 22 Document 1490

In May 2012, the Defendants in the Enforcement Action against whom API had
asserted cross-claims in May 2011 filed motions to dismiss such claims. EA Dkt. 412,
418. API opposed the motions on the ground that it was entitled to relief under § 107
because it did not share common liability with other parties as a result of the No Liability
Decision and that it should be allowed to pursue § 107 claims in the Enforcement Action
because its § 107 claim in Whiting had been dismissed. EA. Dkt. 432.
On March 29, 2013, the Court granted the motion to dismiss API’s cross-claims
in the Enforcement Action, stating in part:
API is right that these are unique procedural circumstances that other courts have
not addressed. But the question is why these duplicate contribution-style claims
should be allowed in a subsequent enforcement action when they have already
been addressed in an earlier contribution action that remains open. . . . Simply
put, the fact that there happens to be another, later-filed civil action involving the
same parties does not give a party license to restate claims that have been
addressed in the earlier-filed action. If circumstances warrant revisiting any
decisions in Whiting, API may move for reconsideration on that basis in the other
case.

Dkt. 787 at 2.
ARGUMENT
I.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT.
The Court should reconsider its dismissal of API’s CERCLA § 107 claims in

Whiting with respect to costs incurred in connection with the 106 Order. The law is
settled that a party who incurs response costs must be permitted to sue under § 107 if it
cannot sue under § 113(f). An essential element of a § 113(f) contribution claim is
common liability under CERCLA. An allegation of common liability in an action under
CERCLA §§ 106 or 107 suffices to trigger the right to sue under § 113 at the pleading
stage because if the allegations are proven there would be common liability. However,
the right to pursue contribution is extinguished if a party is later adjudicated to have no

-7Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 7 of 22 Document 1490

liability under CERCLA. This follows from the fact that shared liability for the same
injury is the sine qua non of a common law claim for contribution, and Congress, by
basing CERCLA’s contribution rights upon common law principles, could not have
intended that § 113(f) would encompass claims where the essential element of common
liability is lacking.
Accordingly, the Court should reconsider and vacate its prior dismissal of API’s
§ 107 claims and permit API to pursue recovery of costs incurred in complying with the
106 Order.
II.

A PARTY WHO INCURS RESPONSE COSTS MUST BE PERMITTED
TO SUE UNDER § 107 WHEN IT CANNOT SUE UNDER § 113(f).
A party that incurs response costs but cannot sue under § 113(f) is permitted to

sue under § 107. Solutia, Inc. v. McWane, Inc., 726 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1341 (N.D. Ala.
2010) (“[C]osts may be recovered under § 107(a) notwithstanding that they may have
been ‘compelled’ under an administrative order or settlement with the government where
that order or settlement does not give rise to contribution rights under § 113(f)(3)(B)”),

under § 107(a) if it is foreclosed from bringing a claim under § 113(f).”), aff’d, 638 F.3d

In Solutia, Inc. and Morrison Enterprises, LLC, the courts ultimately concluded that the
claimants had a remedy under § 113(f) under the particular facts presented. In W.R. Grace & Co. and Ford
Motor Co., the parties asserting CERCLA § 107(a) claims had incurred costs in response to state
(footnote continued on next page)

-8Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 8 of 22 Document 1490

This black letter rule, the Seventh Circuit has held, is grounded in “the plain terms
of the statute”:
Where a person has been subjected to a civil action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 9606 or
9607(a), he may attempt to recover his expenditures through a contribution suit
under 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(1). Where a person has resolved his liability to the
United States, or to a state, for some or all of a response action or for some or all
of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement,
he may attempt to recover his expenditures in a contribution suit pursuant to
42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(3)(B). If neither of those triggers has occurred, a
plaintiff does not have a claim for contribution under CERCLA. That does
not mean he has no remedy, however. Any time a person has incurred
“necessary costs of response . . . consistent with the national contingency
plan[,]” CERCLA provides for a § 9607(a)(4)(B) cost recovery action. These
are the plain terms of the statute.

Bernstein v. Bankert, 702 F.3d 964, 976 (7th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) (petition for
rehearing pending). In Bankert, the Seventh Circuit held that a party who incurred costs
pursuant to an administrative consent order which, by its terms, had not yet triggered a
right to contribution under § 113(f)(3)(B), could assert a § 107 claim to recover such
costs. Id. at 983.7
This Court has reached similar conclusions.

In its August 2008 decision

dismissing API’s § 107 claims, the Court ruled that the “operative principle” is that:
. . . § 107 is available to recover payments only in cases where § 113(f) is not. In
cases where a claim for contribution can be asserted under § 113(f), § 107(a)
cannot be used.

Dkt. 227 at 11 (footnote omitted).8 The Court further stated:

(footnote continued from prior page)
administrative cleanup orders, but the courts found that the orders did not give rise to contribution claims
under § 113(f). In both cases, the courts held that the response costs were recoverable under § 107(a).
7

The petition for rehearing in Bankert addresses when a party to an administrative settlement has
resolved its liability for purposes of § 113(f)(3)(B). It does not challenge the principle that a party who has
incurred response costs but cannot sue under § 113(f) has a right to pursue cost recovery under § 107.
8
Courts bar use of § 107 when a remedy under § 113(f) is available in order to maintain the
“procedural distinctiveness of the remedies”:

(footnote continued on next page)

-9Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 9 of 22 Document 1490

It thus follows that the question whether Plaintiffs have a claim under § 107(a)
depends on whether any of the payments they seek to recover are recoverable
under § 113(f). If all of the payments they now seek to recover are recoverable
under § 113(f), their § 107(a) claims should be dismissed. If, on the other hand,
some of the payments cannot be recovered under § 113(f), then their § 107(a)
claim survives.

Id. at 13 (emphasis added). The Court explained that a party who has incurred response
costs but cannot satisfy the statutory triggers necessary for maintaining a contribution
action must be allowed to sue under § 107 to prevent injustice:
[P]arties who do not have access to § 113(a) [sic] . . . because they are
completely innocent and do not share common liability with any PRPs . . . must
be allowed to recover under § 107(a) if injustice is to be avoided.

Id. at 12.
Therefore, if API cannot maintain a § 113(f) contribution claim in light of the No
Liability Decision, it is entitled to pursue recovery of its response costs under § 107.
III.

API CANNOT MAINTAIN AN ACTION UNDER § 113(f) FOR ITS 106
ORDER COSTS BECAUSE IT HAS NO COMMON LIABILITY.
A.

Common Liability Is An Essential Element Of A Contribution Claim
Under § 113(f).

In Atlantic Research, the Supreme Court held that a party must share common
liability under CERCLA with other parties in order to sue under § 113(f):

(footnote continued from prior page)
The other justification usually offered for limiting a plaintiff to one form of CERCLA
action—the procedural distinctness of the remedies—is more compelling. As the Second
Circuit has observed, “[t]o allow [a qualifying contribution plaintiff] to proceed under
§ 9607(a) would in effect nullify the SARA amendment and abrogate the requirements
Congress placed on contribution claims under § 9613.” Niagara Mohawk, 596 F.3d at
128. . . . We agree with the sentiments expressed by the Second Circuit. Through SARA,
Congress intentionally amended CERCLA to include express rights to contribution,
subject to certain prerequisites. If § 9607(a) already provided the rights of action
contemplated by the SARA amendments, then the amendments were just so many
superfluous words. The canons of statutory construction counsel against any
interpretation that leads to that result.
Bankert, 702 F.3d at 979. The “procedural distinctiveness” of CERCLA’s remedies is maintained where a
party without a remedy under § 113(f) is permitted to sue under § 107.

-10Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 10 of 22 Document 1490

Section 113(f) explicitly grants PRPs a right to contribution. Contribution is
defined as the “tortfeasor’s right to collect from others responsible for the same
tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share, the
shares being determined as a percentage of fault.” Black’s Law Dictionary 353
(8th ed. 2004). Nothing in § 113(f) suggests that Congress used the term
“contribution” in anything other than this traditional sense. The statute
authorizes a PRP to seek contribution “during or following” a suit under § 106 or
§ 107(a). 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(1). Thus, § 113(f)(1) permits suit before or
after the establishment of common liability. In either case, a PRP’s right to
contribution under § 113(f)(1) is contingent upon an inequitable distribution
of common liability among liable parties.

551 U.S. at 138-39 (emphasis added). When common liability under CERCLA cannot be
shown, a claim for contribution under § 113(f) fails as a matter of law:
[W]hen there is no question that joint liability is lacking, a necessary element to
establish contribution cannot be proven. The claim for contribution must then, as
a matter of law, fail.

In re Reading Co., 115 F.3d 1111, 1124 (3rd Cir. 1997), abrogation on other grounds
recognized in Agere Sys., Inc. v. Advanced Envtl. Tech. Corp., 602 F.3d 204, 220 (3rd Cir.
2010.9
In Reading Co., the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a § 113(f) claim where
the parties did not share common liability under CERCLA:
. . . § 113(f) uses the term contribution in its traditional, common law sense.
This means that CERCLA contribution, like common law contribution,
requires some form of joint liability. See . . . Restatement (Second) of Torts
§ 886A(1) (1977) (“when two or more persons become liable in tort to the same
person for the same harm, there is a right of contribution among them, even
though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them”).
CERCLA § 113(f) captures the requirements of joint liability in its statutory
language: “Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is
liable or potentially liable under section 9607(a) of this title, during or following
any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this
9

See also Morrison Enterprises, LLC v. Dravo Corp., 638 F.3d 594, 603 (8th Cir. 2011):

The term “contribution” has its traditional meaning of a “tortfeasor’s right to collect from
others responsible for the same tort after the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her
proportionate share, the shares being determined as a percentage of fault.” Atl. Research,
551 U.S. at 138 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed. 2004)). The “right to
contribution under § 113(f)(1) is contingent upon an inequitable distribution of common
liability among liable parties.” Id. at 139.

title.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f). . . . Contribution, by its own definition, requires a
common liability for the same injury. For example, the Uniform Contribution
Among Tortfeasors Act provides “where two or more persons become jointly or
severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property or for the same
wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though
judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.” Uniform
Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (1955 Revised Act) § 1, 12 U.L.A. 194. We
read the language of § 113(f) as adopting the same traditional sense of
contribution. . . .
Because § 113(f)(1) reflects the traditional concept of contribution, its
language does not permit contribution among liable parties who do not have
a common derivation of liability.

Id. at 1124 (emphasis added).
A CERCLA contribution claim was also dismissed for lack of common liability in
United States v. Washington State Department of Transportation, 665 F. Supp. 2d 1233
(W.D. Wash. 2009).

After the United States sued a state transportation agency

(“WSDOT”) under CERCLA to recover response costs, WSDOT asserted a CERCLA
contribution counterclaim seeking to recover, among other things, amounts WSDOT paid
to satisfy a state court judgment on a nuisance claim brought by property owners whose
land was damaged by contamination. Id. at 1236. The court dismissed the contribution
claim with respect to amounts paid under the state court judgment, ruling that “CERCLA
limits claims for contribution by restricting recovery to the portion of ‘common liability’
that stems from the same § 9606 or § 9607(a) action.” Id. at 1241. See also Trinity
Indus. v. Chicago Bridge & Iron Co., 867 F. Supp. 2d 754, 761 (W.D. Pa. 2012)
(dismissing § 113(f) claim because “Trinity and CBI do not share common liability
arising from a CERCLA action.”).
B.

API Does Not Share Common Liability With Other Parties For The
Fox River Contamination.

The Court’s determination in the No Liability Decision that API is not liable
under CERCLA forecloses any claim that API shares CERCLA liability with other
-12Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 12 of 22 Document 1490

parties with respect to the Lower Fox River. Without common liability for the same
harm, a claim for contribution fails as a matter of law. See Reading Co., 115 F.3d at
1124 (“[W]hen there is no question that joint liability is lacking, a necessary element to
establish contribution cannot be proven. The claim for contribution must then, as a
matter of law, fail.”).
The filing of the Enforcement Action satisfied, at least for a time, the statutory
trigger under § 113(f)(1) for asserting a CERCLA contribution claim since “§ 113(f)(1)
permits suit before or after the establishment of common liability.” Atlantic Research,
551 U.S. at 138-39. As this Court has recognized, unproven allegations of liability may
be sufficient to trigger the right to plead a contribution claim. Dkt. 751 at 6. However,
once the allegations have been dismissed on their merits, they can no longer support a
claim for contribution. As Atlantic Research makes clear, “a PRP’s right to contribution
under § 113(f)(1) is contingent upon . . . common liability.” 551 U.S. at 138-39.
Here, the adjudication that API is not liable under CERCLA eliminated the
essential element for contribution — common liability. The ruling transformed API’s
status from that of a PRP with a right to recover only amounts in excess of its fair share
of the common harm to that of an innocent party with a right to recover all response costs
it had incurred complying with the 106 Order. Contribution is simply inapplicable
because the essence of contribution is fairly allocating shared liability:
Contribution under § 9613(f)(1) is “contingent upon an inequitable distribution of
common liability among liable parties.” Atlantic Research, 551 U.S. at 138.
Therefore, contribution awards are based on a balancing of equities and an
understanding that parties should be held responsible only for their fair share.

WSDOT, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 1240. After the No Liability Decision, API’s claim does not
fit such a contribution structure. There are no equities to balance and no fair share to be

-13Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 13 of 22 Document 1490

determined Since API does not have access to § 113(f) because it does not share
common liability with any PRPs, as this Court has already established in the Enforcement
Action, API must be allowed to recover under § 107. Accordingly, the Court’s prior
ruling to the contrary should be reconsidered and vacated.
IV.

THIS COURT’S PRIOR RULINGS DO NOT SUPPORT A CONCLUSION
THAT API’S SOLE REMEDY IS UNDER § 113(f).
The Court has addressed API’s right to assert § 107 claims twice previously in

this case, in August 2008 (Dkt. 227) and November 2009 (Dkt. 751). API is respectful of
the time and effort the Court has devoted to this challenging issue. See, e.g., Agere Sys.,
602 F.3d at 218 (“[N]avigating the interplay between § 107(a) and § 113(f) remains a
deeply difficult task.”); United States v. NCR Corp., 688 F.3d 833, 844 (7th Cir. 2012)
(“The Supreme Court has . . . left some aspects of this issue up in the air.”). However,
the Court’s prior rulings were made years before the No Liability Decision and the
Seventh Circuit's recent decision in Bernstein v. Bankert. In light of those developments,
the prior rulings do not provide a sound basis to deny API the right to pursue a claim
under § 107. It is appropriate to reconsider the issue now, before the entry of a final
judgment, so the Seventh Circuit will have the benefit of this Court’s analysis based upon
the current situation.
A.

The 2001 Civil Action Did Not Trigger A Right To Contribution With
Respect To Costs Incurred Pursuant To The 106 Order.

In its August 2008 Decision, the Court held that the filing of the 2001 Civil
Action triggered API’s right to seek contribution under § 113(f) with respect to any and
all Fox River-related response costs subsequently incurred:
By its plain terms, § 113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution claim “during or
following any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section
9607(a) of this title.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2) [sic]. Plaintiffs were first sued by

-14Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 14 of 22 Document 1490

the EPA in August of 2001, and so they have been free to assert such a claim
since at least that time.

***
This would include not only payments made pursuant to the consent decree
filed in the civil action instituted against them on August 21, 2001, but also
any other payments they made to discharge their common liability under
§ 107(a) before or after that time. Thus, they have no need to resort to
§ 107(a). Whatever amounts they are entitled to recover must be recovered under
§ 113(f).

Dkt. 227 at 13-14 (emphasis added).
Pursuant to the 2001 Civil Action, a consent decree was entered that required API
and NCR to pay prescribed amounts for specific projects. None of these payments were
used to fund activities mandated by the 106 Order that the Government issued six years
later in 2007. Therefore, the 2001 Civil Action action did not trigger any right to
contribution with respect to costs that were outside the matters addressed in the 2001
Consent Decree, including costs incurred to satisfy the 106 Order. See WSDOT, 665 F.
Supp. 2d at 1241 (“CERCLA limits claims for contribution by restricting recovery to the
portion of ‘common liability’ that stems from the same § 9606 or § 9607(a) action.”).
The CERCLA statutory scheme contemplates contribution under § 113(f)(1) only
for the cost of work or funding that is the subject of the litigation. Under § 113(g)(3), any
contribution claims related to the costs paid pursuant to the 2001 Civil Action had to be
asserted within three years “after . . . entry of a judicially approved settlement with
respect to such costs or damages.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(g)(3)(B). If the 2001 Civil Action
triggered API’s right to contribution with respect to costs incurred pursuant to the
106 Order, then the statute of limitation on the claim would have expired years before the
106 Order was issued. Statutes may not be interpreted to produce such nonsensical
results. That is why § 113(f)(1) can only trigger a right to contribution with respect to

-15Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 15 of 22 Document 1490

costs associated with the matters addressed in the predicate civil action for which those
costs are in issue.
This interpretation is confirmed by the Seventh Circuit’s recent decision in
Bernstein v. Bankert, where the Court of Appeals ruled that there must be a separate
event triggering contribution rights for each source of response costs. In Bankert, the
plaintiffs (“Trustees”) asserted a § 107 claim to recover costs incurred under a 1999
Administrative Order by Consent (“AOC”) and a separate 2002 AOC. The defendants
moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs’ only remedy for costs incurred
under either AOC was a § 113 contribution action and that the statute of limitations for
such an action had expired. The district court agreed and dismissed the claims. 702 F.3d
at 971-72.
The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court’s decision and held in pertinent
part that plaintiffs could pursue a § 107 cost recovery claim for costs incurred under the
2002 AOC, but not for costs incurred under the 1999 AOC. Id. at 984. The Seventh
Circuit analyzed the proper CERCLA remedy (§ 107 or § 113(f)) for the 1999 and 2002
AOCs separately, even though the parties themselves had not done so:
We recognize that neither party appears to have considered splitting the Trustees’
claim in the way that we do now. But the removal actions called for by the
AOCs were temporally discrete projects. If that were not the case, the EPA
would not have been able to certify the first action’s completion before the
second action had even been selected. They need not be treated as an
indivisible whole. The removal action contemplated by the 1999 AOC was
completed years ago, and supports a contribution action.

Id. (emphasis added). Thus, because the costs arose from “temporally discrete projects”
involving separate orders, the parties’ rights had to be determined on an order-by-order
basis, even though both orders involved work at the same site. Consequently, the fact
that contribution was available for the 1999 AOC costs did not compel the conclusion

-16Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 16 of 22 Document 1490

that the same was true of the 2002 AOC. Rather, the court held that the right to
contribution must be analyzed separately with respect to each order giving rise to costs.
Like the 1999 and 2002 AOCs in Bankert, the 2001 Consent Decree and the
106 Order were temporally discrete. The 2001 Consent Decree was entered six years
before the 106 Order was issued. Moreover, obligations under the 2001 Consent Decree
were separate and distinct from the obligations under the 106 Order. Indeed, the Record
of Decision that specified the remedy that the 106 Order sought to implement had not
even been issued at the time the 2001 Consent Decree was entered. Money paid under
the 2001 Consent Decree was used to fund certain limited “test” remediation projects,
remedial design, and natural resource restoration projects while the 106 Order dealt
exclusively with remediation of OUs 2-5. The 2001 Civil Action thus did not address
costs API would incur under the 106 Order since no remedy for OUs 2-5 had even been
selected in 2001. Dkt. 265, ¶ 58.
Therefore, the Court should reconsider its conclusion that the 2001 Civil Action
permits API to recover costs related to the 106 Order under § 113(f).
B.

The Fact That API Incurred Costs Under Compulsion Pursuant To
The 106 Order Did Not Trigger A Right To Contribution Under
§ 113(f).

In its November 2009 decision, the Court did not rely upon the 2001 Civil Action
as the basis for its conclusion that API’s remedy was under § 113(f). Instead, the Court
held that contribution is available when a party “has been ‘compelled’ or ‘coerced’ to
discharge the liability to the injured party.” Dkt. 751 at 5 (quoting Michael Hernandez,
Cost Recovery or Contribution?: Resolving the Controversy Over CERCLA Claims
Brought By Potentially Responsible Parties, 21 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 83, 103-04 (1997)).

-17Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 17 of 22 Document 1490

The Court explained that “[i]t is enough that the party be subject to some compulsion to
pay ― here, the government’s § 106 Order.” Id. at 5. The Court further stated:
As noted in previous rulings, Plaintiffs were subject to a § 106 administrative
order. That order triggered their right under § 113 to bring a contribution
action and seek payment from other PRPs for any costs they incurred that they
allege were more than their fair share.

Id. at 6 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that “contribution . . . is open to any
person who has undertaken remedial action in response to a governmental order, which is
exactly the scenario we have here.” Id.
The Court’s ruling that the availability of contribution turned on whether the costs
in question were compelled by a government order should be reconsidered in light of the
Seventh Circuit’s recent decision in Bankert. In Bankert, the defendants (the Bankerts)
argued that the plaintiffs could have sued under § 113(f) to recover costs incurred under
the 2002 AOC, even though the statutory trigger for contribution under § 113(f)(3)(B)
had not been satisfied, because the costs at issue had been compelled by the AOC.
702 F.3d at 981-82. The Seventh Circuit rejected the argument:
What the Trustees have done, with respect to the work called for by the 2002
AOC, is incur costs of response consistent with the national contingency plan, as
is required to file a cost recovery action under § 9607(a). The Bankerts offer no
persuasive reason why such an action cannot be maintained. Their argument
focuses primarily on a distinction between voluntary and compelled costs:
they claim that the Supreme Court drew a new line in the sand in Atlantic
Research and that, going forward, a cost recovery action is available only to
plaintiffs who incurred costs voluntarily. Compelled costs, on the other hand,
may only be recovered through a contribution action. Since the Trustees were
“compelled” to clean up the site by the administrative settlement process, the
Bankerts argue that they were limited to a contribution action. There are three
significant problems with this argument.

Id. at 981 (italics in original; bold emphasis added).

The Court of Appeals then

addressed each of the three problems. The court first found that “the Bankerts’ argument
. . . has no basis in the text of the source case,” i.e., Atlantic Research. Id. Rather, the
Seventh Circuit noted that the Supreme Court in Atlantic Research “explicitly left open
-18Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 18 of 22 Document 1490

the possibility that parties who were ‘compelled’ to incur costs ― including parties who
incurred costs subsequent to government settlements ― might proceed under § 9607(a)
nonetheless.” Id. at 982.
The Seventh Circuit’s second problem with the Bankerts’ argument was that there
was no legal authority to support it. Id. at 982. The court explained:
The cases they cite which did hold that PRPs who incurred cleanup costs under
government settlements were bound to pursue a contribution claim did so
because the statutory triggers for contribution claims were met, not because the
costs were compelled as opposed to voluntary. . . . In short, not a single one of
these cases treated the voluntary/compelled costs dichotomy as dispositive.

Id. at 982-83 (emphasis added).
Finally, the court found that the Bankerts were “asking us to impose a
requirement that appears nowhere in the statutory text” and that “arguably violates
fundamental rules of statutory construction.” Id. at 983.
The Bankert analysis undermines the basis for the November 2009 decision. The
Seventh Circuit rejected the notion that the availability of contribution turned on whether
the costs in question were compelled by a government order. Instead, the Court of
Appeals held that the right to contribution is determined strictly by whether a trigger
specified in the text of § 113(f) has been satisfied.
Here, as of November 2009, no statutory trigger in § 113(f) had been satisfied.
The fact that the Fox River 106 Order purported to compel API to incur costs did not
trigger a right to contribution. In Bankert, the EPA had issued a § 106 Order in 1996
(702 F.3d at 970), but that did not trigger a contribution claim under § 113(f)(1) for costs
incurred under either the 1999 or 2002 AOCs. Rather, the Seventh Circuit held that there
was no right to contribution for the 2002 AOC and that a contribution claim arose under

-19Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 19 of 22 Document 1490

§ 113(f)(3)(B) with respect to the 1999 AOC only because EPA had certified that all
work required under that order had been completed. 702 F.3d at 979-80.
Further, the text of § 113(f) undermines any claim that the Fox River 106 Order
triggered a right to contribution. The 106 Order was not a “settlement” that might trigger
contribution rights under § 113(f)(3)(B). Nor was it a “civil action” under CERCLA
§§ 106 or 107 that satisfied the requirements of § 113(f)(1). Numerous courts have held
that a 106 Order is not a civil action under CERCLA §§ 106 or 107, and thus does not
trigger a right to contribution under § 113(f)(1). See, e.g., Pharmacia Corp. v. Clayton
Chem. Acquisition LLC, 382 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1091 (S.D. Ill. 2005) (rejecting an
argument that a 106 Order was a civil action, stating: “[T]his Court finds based on the
Supreme Court’s discussion of CERCLA in Cooper and CERCLA itself, an
administrative order does not qualify as a civil action. Therefore, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under Section 113(f)(1) . . .”); Raytheon Aircraft
Co. v. United States, 435 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1142-43 (D. Kan. 2006); Blue Tee Corp. v.
ASARCO, Inc., No. 03-5011, 2005 WL 1532955, *3-4 (W.D. Mo. June 27, 2005);
Ermhart Indus. v. New England Container Co., 478 F. Supp. 2d 199, 203 (D.R.I. 2007).
In light of Bankert, it is now clear that, as of November 2009, no event had
occurred which triggered the right to contribution for 106 Order costs. Consequently, the
Court should reconsider its ruling in that decision that the Fox River 106 Order triggered
a right to pursue contribution under § 113(f).
V.

THE CIRCUMSTANCE WARRANT RECONSIDERATION OF THE
COURT’S PRIOR RULINGS.
In its March 29 Decision, the Court observed:
. . . [A]s Glatfelter notes, any awkwardness resulting from [the timing of the No
Liability Decision] was a function of API joining or instituting a contribution

-20Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 20 of 22 Document 1490

lawsuit long before its liability was ever on the table. That is, the entire premise
of API’s contribution action was some sort of common liability, yet now it wants
to avoid CERCLA liability (which it has successfully done) and maintain an
action under CERCLA.

EA Dkt. 787 at 2 (italics in original). Respectfully, Glatfelter’s arguments prompting
these observations warrant a brief response.
First, API’s original complaint asserted claims under both § 107 and § 113(f).
This lawsuit became solely an action for contribution only after the Court dismissed
API’s § 107 claims in 2008 and denied API’s request to re-plead a § 107 claim in 2009.
Second, the fact that this action was commenced “long before [API’s] liability
was ever on the table” is not the result of inaction or omission on the part of API.
Instead, any delay in putting API’s liability “on the table” was the result of CERCLA
§ 113(h), which prevents a party in API’s position from obtaining immediate judicial
review of unfounded allegations in a 106 Order. API challenged its liability under
CERCLA at the first opportunity.
Third, API can hardly be faulted for bringing this action when it did in 2008. As
a result of the Government’s issuance of the 106 Order in November 2007, API was
being compelled to spend enormous sums of money to comply with a government order
which, at that time, was unchallengeable, even though API maintained it had no liability
under CERCLA, as this Court later determined. The filing of this lawsuit was the only
legal avenue then available to API to obtain some recompense from the liable parties.
Finally, the suggestion that API is attempting to have its cake and eat it too (“yet
now [API] wants to avoid CERCLA liability . . . and maintain an action under
CERCLA”) is unwarranted. As this Court has recognized, a party without liability under
CERCLA (i.e., an innocent party) who has been compelled to incur response costs “must

-21Case 2:08-cv-00016-WCG Filed 04/19/13 Page 21 of 22 Document 1490

be allowed to recover under § 107(a) if injustice is to be avoided.” Dkt. 227 at 12. In
short, CERCLA permits a party to maintain (and establish) its non-liability under
CERCLA, as API has done, and still exercise the relief CERCLA affords to innocent
parties through § 107.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Appleton Papers Inc. respectfully requests that
the Court reconsider and vacate its prior rulings that dismissed API’s § 107 claims. API
further requests that the Court grant it leave to file an amended complaint that amends its
§ 107 claim to reflect present circumstances.
Dated this 19th day of April, 2013.
