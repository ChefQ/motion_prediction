PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO
SET ASIDE DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT ALOHA
PLASTIC SURGERY, LLC. FILED DECEMBER 30, 2011
Plaintiffs HAWAIIAN ART NETWORK, LLC and VINCENT
K. TYLOR (hereafter “Plaintiffs”), respectfully submit their memorandum
of law in opposition to Defendant ALOHA PLASTIC SURGERY, LLC’S
(hereafter “Defendant APS”) Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment Against
Defendant Aloha Plastic Surgery, LLC Filed December 30, 2011 (Doc. #
15).
Defendant APS fails to show good cause for the default to be
set aside. Much of the argument supporting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default
Judgment (Doc. # 12) also serves as a basis for denying Defendant APS’s
motion, and will not be repeated here. Defendant APS has not provided any
factual basis for the court to conclude that its failure to retain counsel and
answer the complaint was not intentional, or that there are any meritorious
defenses to Plaintiff’s claims. Nor can Defendant APS assure the court that
Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced by further delay if Defendant APS carries
through with its threats to simply bankrupt the LLC.
I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Defendant APS and Dr. Michael Pasquale (hereafter “Dr.

Pasquale”) have been aware of the claims in this action since the beginning
2

Case 1:11-cv-00722-JMS-KSC Document 17 Filed 04/23/12 Page 3 of 11

PageID #: 113

of September 2011. Plaintiffs’ counsel and Dr. Pasquale exchanged several
lengthy emails between September 13 and September 16, 2011. In emails
on September 13, 14 and 15, Plaintiffs’ counsel recommended that Dr.
Pasquale consult with legal counsel, (Decl. of Counsel ¶ 8). On September
15, Plaintiffs’ counsel requested that Dr. Pasquale no longer communicate
directly with Plaintiffs’ counsel, but have his attorney contact Plaintiffs’
counsel. A true and correct copy of the email exchange on September 15,
2011 is attached as Ex. A (Decl. of Counsel ¶ 9).
On Friday September 16, 2012 Dr. Pasquale advised Plaintiffs’
counsel that he was leaving on a two month trip over the weekend and
requested that Plaintiffs’ counsel wait to file any action until after Dr.
Pasquale’s return on November 20, 2011. A true and correct copy of the
email is attached Ex. B.

Plaintiffs’ counsel honored that request and filed

this action on December 1, 2011. Dr. Pasquale was served on December 3,
2011. (Decl. of Counsel ¶ 4).
On December 5, 2011, Dr. Pasquale made six posts to a website

As soon as I get a chance I will give more info and hopefully
find a way to get everyone together to counter this. I am
looking for an attorney who will go after this and willing to pay

scam etc now or legitimate.
***
(Decl. of Counsel ¶ 11).
On January 3, 2012, after 5 p.m. Plaintiffs’ counsel received a
telephone call from a man identifying himself as Michael Pasquale, who said
he had received a copy of the Entry of Default and that he was requesting
that Plaintiff set it aside. Plaintiffs’ counsel requested that Dr. Pasquale
have Aloha Plastic Surgery’s counsel contact him to discuss the matter. Dr.
Pasquale indicated that he was contemplating filing counterclaims and had
contacted various attorneys but that he hadn’t found a suitable lawyer to do
so. He said that he wasn’t sure whether he was going to hire a lawyer.
Plaintiff’s counsel informed him that he could not represent the corporation
in court unless he was licensed to practice law (Decl. of Counsel ¶ 7).
Nevertheless, on Friday, January 6, 2012, Dr. Pasquale filed
what he characterized as “Defendants request to court for: Set Aside Default
Judgment request by Plaintiff” (Doc. # 8) on behalf of Aloha Plastic Surgery
LLC. On Monday January 9, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike based
upon Local Rule 83.1 (Doc. No. 9). The Court granted that motion by order

4

Case 1:11-cv-00722-JMS-KSC Document 17 Filed 04/23/12 Page 5 of 11

PageID #: 115

dated January 10, 2010 (Doc. # 10). The “motion” filed by Dr. Pasquale
also fell far short of providing any substantive basis to set aside the default.
On February 9, 2012, Dr. Pasquale emailed counsel for
Plaintiffs suggesting why he had not bothered to retain counsel to defend
this action:
Basically Aloha Plastic Surgery has no real assets. So I am thinking
you may want to take the LLC as payment. I may form another
cooperation (sic) with my wifes (sic) money probably less expensive
than to hire a lawyer in which case you may be welcome to what ever
(sic) is left and sell it from the LLC.
As far as me, I have about 2000 in a checking account. Everything
else is in my wife’s trust and she owns it. She has nothing to do with
this so up to you.
A true and correct copy of the February 9, 2012 email received by Plaintiffs’
counsel from Dr. Pasquale is attached as Ex. C (Decl. of Counsel ¶ 12). Dr.
Pasquale went on to request another settlement offer so he could “make a
decision what to do about this.” Plaintiffs made a settlement offer to resolve
the matter on the same day and did not receive any response (Decl. of
Counsel ¶13).
On February 14, 2012, Plaintiffs’ counsel received a telephone
call from attorney Robin Melchor, indicating that she would be representing
Aloha Plastic Surgery in this matter and requesting additional time to
evaluate the claim before Plaintiffs filed a motion for default judgment. On

PageID #: 116

February 22, 2012, Plaintiffs’ counsel called Robin Melchor, who said that
she had not yet had a chance to evaluate the claim. Plaintiff’s counsel
requested that she respond by Friday, February 24, 2012. Plaintiffs’ counsel
had no further communication from Robin Melchor, until she made an
appearance at the Rule 16 conference on March 23, 2012. (Decl. of Counsel
¶ 14).
II.

ARGUMENT
Under FRCP 55(c), the court has broad discretion in deciding whether

to set aside a default: "[t]he court may set aside an entry of default for good
cause shown [,]" See Brady v. United States, 211 F.3d 499, 504 (9th Cir.
2000). The Ninth Circuit has identified three factors that the court should
consider in determining whether good cause exists to set aside an entry of
default: "(1) whether [the defendant] engaged in culpable conduct that led to
the default; (2) whether [the defendant] had a meritorious defense; and (3)
whether reopening the default judgment would prejudice [the plaintiffs]."
Franchise Holding II, LLC v. Huntington Restaurant Groups, Inc., 375 F.3d
922, 925-26 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing TCI Group Life Ins. Plan v. Knoebber,
244 F.3d 691, 696 (9th Cir. 2001)).
The party seeking to set aside default bears the burden of
establishing that these factors favor setting aside the default. Franchise

Holding II, LLC, 375 F.3d at 926. The court may deny a motion to set aside
an entry of default if the moving party fails to show that any one of the three
factors has not been satisfied: "This tripartite test is disjunctive," Cassidy v.
Tenorio, 856 F.2d 1412, 1415 (9th Cir. 1988); Fruean v. Bank of New York
Mellon, et al., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80527, (USDC Hi, July 22, 2011).
A.

Culpable Conduct

"[A] defendant's conduct is culpable if he has received actual or
constructive notice of the filing of the action and intentionally failed to
answer." TCI Group, 244 F.3d at 697 (emphasis in original) (quoting Alan
Neuman Productions, Inc. v. Albright, 862 F.2d 1388, 1392 (9th Cir. 1988)).
The Ninth Circuit has limited the kind of intentional conduct that may be
considered culpable under FRCP 55(c) determinations: "in this context, the
term 'intentionally' means that a [defendant] cannot be treated as culpable
simply for having made a conscious choice not to answer; rather to treat a
failure to answer as culpable, the [defendant] must have acted with bad faith,
such as an 'intention to take advantage of the opposing party, interfere [*8]
with judicial decision-making, or otherwise manipulate the legal process.'"
U.S. v. Signed Personal Check No. 730 of Yubran S. Mesle, 615 F.3d 1085,
1092 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing TCI Group, 244 F.3d at 697).

There is no issue as to service of process or as to whether
Defendant APS had actual notice of the Complaint and Summons in this
case. There is no legitimate issue that Defendant APS chose not to retain
counsel until more than a month and a half after its answer was due. Dr.
Pasquale’s stated misunderstanding of the summons does not explain why he
waited another month and a half after learning that he was not entitled to
practice law without a license to retain counsel. Nor does it explain why
counsel waited six weeks more to move to set aside the default after being
retained.
In Mesle, 615 F.3d at 1093, the Ninth Circuit held that the district court
erred where it found the defendant's conduct to be culpable because he had
actual or constructive notice of the filing of the action and failed to answer,
without the district court analyzing whether that failure was intentional.
Here, an analysis of Defendant APS’s actions show that Dr. Pasquale has
acted with an intention of interfering with judicial decision-making, and
otherwise manipulate the legal process, with the apparent ill-advised purpose
of driving up the cost of the litigation for the opposing party, while
threatening to bankrupt his plastic surgery LLC. His January 9, 2012 email
quoted above leads to no other plausible conclusion.

Meritorious Defenses
Even if Defendant APS can persuade the court that it did not

"intentionally" fail to retain counsel and answer the Complaint due to bad
faith, such as an "intention to take advantage of the opposing party, interfere
with judicial decision-making, or otherwise manipulate the legal process"
(TCI Group, 244 F.3d at 697), it still falls far short of demonstrating any
meritorious defenses that would justify moving forward with this case on the
merits.
The Ninth Circuit has held that in order to demonstrate the
existence of a meritorious defense, the moving party must show more than
mere conclusory allegations, and "must present specific facts that would
constitute a defense," if the litigation is permitted to proceed against the
moving defendant. TCI Group, 244 F.3d at 700 (quoting Madsen v. Bumb,
419 F.2d 4, 6 (9th Cir. 1969)). "A mere denial without facts to support it is
not enough to justify vacating a default or default judgment." Franchise
Holding, 375 F.3d at 926 (quoting Madsen, 419 F.2d at 6) (internal citations
omitted). Although the burden on the party moving to vacate a default
judgment "is not extraordinarily heavy” TCI Group, 244 F.3d at 700,
Defendant APS has failed to assert any facts to sustain the absurd litany of
defenses that Defendant APS asserts at page 6 of its Memorandum in
9

Case 1:11-cv-00722-JMS-KSC Document 17 Filed 04/23/12 Page 10 of 11

Support of Motion (Doc. # 15-1). Defendant APS does not explain how any
of the facts it does recite would constitute a defense to the copyright
infringement claims, nor is any defense raised to the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C §1202(a) claim (false copyright management
information). The Court can spare Defendant APS’s counsel the inherent
problems under Rule 11 FRCP of attempting to assert these defenses,
without any factual basis, by simply denying the motion to set aside the
default.
C.

Prejudice to Plaintiffs

In order to determine whether setting aside default would be prejudicial
to a plaintiff, a court must look at whether the plaintiff's ability to pursue his
claim will be hindered. TCI Group, 244 F.3d at 701. "To be prejudicial, the
setting aside of a judgment must result in greater harm that simply delaying
resolution of the case." Id. Rather, the hindrance must be a tangible harm
such as loss of evidence, increased difficulties of discovery, or greater
opportunity for fraud or collusion. Id.
Here relief from the entry of default would not prejudice Plaintiffs’
ability to prove its case on the merits because Plaintiffs’ claims are not time
sensitive; "[t]he mere fact that the nondefaulting party will be required to
prove his case without the inhibiting effect of the default upon the defaulting

party does not constitute prejudice which should prevent a reopening."
BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (Haw. 1976)).
It will, of course, increase the cost of the litigation. Provided that Defendant
APS is prepared to pay the additional award of attorneys fees necessitated by
its pursuit of spurious defenses, there may be no prejudice to Plaintiffs from
the added costs. However, if Dr. Pasquale uses the opportunity of further
delay to set up his plastic surgery practice under a new entity in his wife’s
name, as he suggested was his intent, prejudice to Plaintiffs is clear.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons Plaintiffs respectfully request that

Defendant APS’s Motion to Set Aside Default Against Aloha Plastic
Surgery, LLC, Filed December 30, 2011, be denied.
