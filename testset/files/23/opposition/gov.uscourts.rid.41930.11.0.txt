MEMORANDUM OF PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO SUBMIT
SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY
Defendant, PNC Bank, National Association, (“PNC”), through its attorneys, has moved
to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
On September 9, 2017, Plaintiff filed Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Submit Supplemental
Authority in Further Reply to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (“Plaintiff’s Motion to
Supplement”). [Doc. No. 10]. This memorandum is submitted in opposition to that motion.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Supplement cites no legal precedent for supplementing the record
here, is not well-founded and should be denied. Consistent with that denial, this Court should not
take notice of the two “text orders” referred to in the Motion to Supplement.
First, this Court has inherent authority to control its docket and to determine the appropriate
briefs that litigants can file in support of and in opposition to motions brought before the Court.
Allowing parties to supplement briefs with “authority” weeks after briefing has been completed
simply does not comport with the orderly consideration of motions.
Second, while the presentation of truly new binding “authority” issued after the completion
of briefing could be justified to avoid wasting the Court’s (and the parties’) resources in reaching

1

a decision that might be later reversed in light of the “authority,” that justification is not present
here. Initially, there is nothing new about the “authority.” Both orders referred to in the Motion to
Supplement were issued in July of this year, approximately one month after PNC Bank filed its
reply memorandum on June 19, 2017. [Doc. No. 7]. Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel was the attorney
of record in both cases, and obviously had notice of the issuance of the “text orders” long before
September 9. Presumably, Plaintiff’s delay in bringing these to the Court’s attention discloses
much about Plaintiff’s own opinion about the value of these orders.
Even more significantly, however, neither of the “text orders” is truly “authority” here. The
issue of whether the face-to-face meeting requirement is incorporated into Plaintiff’s mortgage
contract is a matter of Rhode Island contract law. A federal district court opinion on the issue,
while potentially of some persuasive value, is simply not controlling here. Thus, the referenced
“text orders” are neither new nor authority, and there is no efficiency justification for allowing the
record here to be supplemented by including them in the decision before this Court.
As a substantive matter, however, even if this Court were to permit the record to be
supplemented by the inclusion of these two “text orders,” they are of little persuasive value here.
First, as noted above, they are simply the non-binding opinion of a single federal district court
judge. As noted in PNC’s briefing, there are other courts throughout the nation that have decided
that incorporation is proper – and a minority of whom have also not limited their decisions to
defensive uses – under the particular state law at issue in those cases. So PNC Bank has fully
disclosed the existence of cases contrary to the majority position. These two additional nonbinding cases simply do not tip the scales.
Second, as persuasive authority, Judge McConnell’s text orders are not helpful here. Had
Judge McConnell gone into detail in his decisions to discuss the incorporation issues, addressing

2

for example the policy rationale for limiting the application of the incorporation to defensive
actions and why he chose to reject the majority rule in those cases, a consideration of the “text
orders” might be warranted. Had Judge McConnell reviewed any Rhode Island law and grounded
his decision on such law, a more extensive review of the “text orders” might be warranted.
However, the fact that Judge McConnell chose to issue the briefest of orders on the matter without
citing to any precedent strongly suggests that any substantial reliance on those decisions is
unwarranted.
Therefore, this Court should deny the Motion to Supplement. If, however, the Court
determines that the record should include these two orders, they should be seen for what they are,
non-binding orders of very limited persuasive value.
