PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO SUBMIT SUPPLEMENTAL
AUTHORITY IN FURTHER REPLY TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Pursuant to DRI LR 7(b)(3), Plaintiffs request leave of this Court to submit
supplemental authority in further reply to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiffs
request leave for the sole purpose of providing the Court notice of two recently issued
decisions by this Honorable Court in Ferreira et al v. Ditech Financial LLC et al, CA#
1:17-cv-00115-M-LDA and Peralta v. U.S. Bank National Association, 1:17-cv-00263M-PAS.
In Ferreira Rhode Island District Court Judge John J. McConnell, Jr. on July 10,
2017 denied a motion to dismiss on identical allegations as this case and held that “At the
12(b)(6) stage, following the appropriate standard of review of assuming all plausible
facts in the complaint as true (and disregarding any extraneous evidence submitted that is
out of the complaint), the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have alleged a cause of action for
breach of contract under Paragraph 9(d) of the mortgage contract”. In Peralta Judge
McConnell on July 31, 2017 again denied a motion to dismiss on identical allegations as

this case and held that “the Plaintiff has set forth plausible allegations to support a breach
of contract claim for violation of paragraph 9(d), through its failure to comnply with
HUD regulation 24 CFR 203.604(b)” These decisions by Judge McConnell not only
confirms this Honorable Court’s agreement with the holdings Plaintiffs cite in their
memorandum of law in support of their Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss but
also rejects the Defendant’s positions and arguments in response.

The Plaintiffs

respectfully request that this Court’s review of their Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss include these most recent issued decisions by this Court.
Respectfully submitted,
Plaintiffs,
By their attorney,
