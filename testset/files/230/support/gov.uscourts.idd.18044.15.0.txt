Civil No. CIV 05-355-S-MHW

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiff St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company ("St. Paul"), pursuant to Rule 56 of

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1 of Civil Practice before the United

States District Court for the District of Idaho, respectfully requests that this Court grant summary

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT - 1

 
 

Case 1:05-cv-00355-MHW Document 15 Filed 08/28/06 Page 2 of 5

judgment in its favor on al] Counts of its Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory Judgment.
In support of this Motion, St. Paul states as follows:

1. St. Paul has no duty to defend or indemnify Defendant, Aspen Realty, Inc., d/b/a
Coldwell Banker Aspen Realty ("Aspen") against a lawsuit filed by Robert Bafus and Renae
Bafus (the "Bafuses") because the allegations contained in the underlying complaint do no fall
within the coverage of the Real Estate Professional Services Liability Protection Policy issued to
Aspen under Policy No. GL00639156, effective March 27, 2005 through March 27, 2006 (the
"Policy'").

2. The Bafuses filed the underlying action, entitled Robert Bafus and Renae Bafus,
Individually and as members and Representatives of a Class of Similarly Situated Persons v.
Aspen Reality, Inc. d/b/a Coldwell Banker-Aspen Realty, et al., Case Number 04-121-C-BLW in
the United States District Court for the District of Idaho (The "Bafus Litigation"), and that case
is pending at this time.

3, In the Bafus Litigation, the Bafuses seek the return of commissions Aspen
charged them in the sale of real property. The Bafuses claim that Aspen violated 0x00A71 of the
Sherman Antitrust Act (Count I) and the Idaho Competition Act, LC. 0x00A70x00A748-101, et seg. (Count
ID) by restraining trade and engaging in illegal tying and price-fixing, allowing Aspen to create a
monopoly position.

4. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment should be
entered in favor of St. Paul on all counts of its Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory
Judgment because the pleadings, discovery and admissions on file show that there is no genuine

issue of material fact and that St. Paul is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

Case 1:05-cv-00355-MHW Document 15 Filed 08/28/06 Page 3 of 5

5. Specifically, St. Paul does not owe a duty to defend Aspen for the following
reasons:

a. In the pending Complaint in the Bafus Litigation, the Bafuses allege only
claims for violations of antitrust and restraint of trade laws, and the Policy
excludes coverage for loss that results from actual or alleged violations of
such laws;

b. The Bafuses' clarm was first made against Aspen no later than
December 2000, long before St. Paul provided insurance coverage to
Aspen, and therefore does not constitute a claim first made during the
policy period;

Cc. Any loss from the Bafus Litigation would result from Aspen's fees,
commissions or other charges for its services, and the Policy does not
afford coverage for such loss; and

d. Aspen knew about the wrongful acts alleged in the Bafus Amended
Complaint before March 27, 2001, when St. Paul first provided
professional services liability protection to Aspen, and the Policy does not
cover loss that results from such acts.

6. Because St. Paul does not owe any duty to defend Aspen in the Bafus Litigation,
it does not owe a duty to indemnify Aspen for any resulting settlement or judgment in that suit.

7. Moreover, because St. Paul does not owe any duty to defend Aspen in the Bafus
Litigation, St. Paul is entitled to reimbursement from Aspen for any amounts that Aspen requests
St. Paul pay on behalf of Aspen for the defense of the Bafus Litigation.

8. In further support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, St. Paul submits its
separate Rule 56.1(A)(3) Statement of Uncontested Material Facts, its Memorandum of Law in
Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, and the Affidavit of Christopher J. Bannon and

attached exhibits. Each of these is incorporated by reference herein in further support of St.

Paul's Motion for Summary Judgment.
