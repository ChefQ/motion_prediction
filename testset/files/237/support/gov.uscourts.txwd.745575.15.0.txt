I.

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF RELIEF REQUESTED
The sole issue presented by this Motion is whether Plaintiff has met his lenient showing

for this Court to conditionally certify this case as a collective action under the Fair Labor
Standards Act (“FLSA”) and authorize notice of this suit to workers similarly situated to
Plaintiff. Plaintiff does not seek a ruling on the merits.
Rory Dyson, (“Plaintiff”) is a former flow tester of Stuart Petroleum Testers, Inc. and
Scott Yariger (hereinafter collectively “Defendants”). Defendants are located in multiple states
including Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana serving energy companies nationwide. Defendants
employ their workforce to monitor and maintain oil and gas wells. The Plaintiff is a flow tester
employed by the Defendants to monitor such oil and gas wells, manifolds, and other equipment
used in the oilfield.1 Plaintiff and Class Members regularly work over forty hours a week.2 In
fact, Plaintiff typically worked a twelve-hour shift, seven days a week, but required to be onsite
24 hours a day; a schedule that produces over 44 hours of overtime a workweek.3
The Defendants misclassify their employees as independent contractors.4

This

classification scheme permitted Defendants to substantially reduce their labor costs.
Consequently, they fail to pay their employees the federally mandated overtime rates. Instead,
Defendants compensate all the flow testers with “straight time” for overtime hours worked, that

is, Defendants did not compensate their employees one-and-one-half times their regular rate as
required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).5
Plaintiff seeks to recover his unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, attorneys’ fees,
costs, and interests. Plaintiff also seeks to represent all similarly situated employees, current and
former, of the Defendants who were subjected to the same illegal compensation practices during
the three (3) years prior to filing this original complaint.
In a conditional certification case, an interested employee must “opt-in” by filing a
written consent to join. See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). In order to decide whether to exercise their
rights and opt-in to this case, the class of similarly situated employees needs to be informed of
the pendency of this action and be provided with the appropriate documentation to allow them to
participate. In the same vein, in order to provide this information to the other misclassified
employees, Plaintiff will require that Defendants produce a list of those employees and their
contact information.
For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiff requests that this Court order Defendants to
produce a list of their employees (flow testers) (including names, dates of employment,
addresses, emails, phone numbers, social security numbers, and dates of birth), conditionally
certify this case as a collective action under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), and authorize the sending of the
attached Notice6 and Consent Form7 to all employees misclassified as independent contractors
who were employed by Defendants at any time during three years prior to this case being filed,
April 13, 2012, to present. The proposed notice is intended to educate Defendants’ employees of
their rights and to enable them to join this litigation by signing the consent form and returning it

to Plaintiff’s counsel. Further, Plaintiff asks the Court to rule on this motion urgently as the
statute of limitation is running on the claims of class members who have not yet joined this
lawsuit.
III.

CONDITIONAL CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE GRANTED AT THIS TIME
Plaintiff and Class Members were employees of Defendants, not independent contractors,

and, therefore, entitled to the overtime wage protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act
(“FLSA”).

Defendants disagree, but that issue is not before the Court at this time.8 The sole

issue is whether Plaintiff has satisfied his lenient burden of showing that other employees are
similarly situated to warrant sending out class notice advising such employees of their right to
join this lawsuit.
The merits of the case are not to be considered with respect to the determination of
conditional certification.9 Some employers attempt to defeat class notice by arguing the merits
of the underlying FLSA violation instead of focusing on the common practice that applies to the
employees. The law states otherwise and such attacks are flawed. “[E]ven if Plaintiffs’ claims
turn out to be meritless or, in fact all Plaintiffs turn out not to be similarly situated, notification at
this stage, rather than after further discovery, may enable more efficient resolution of the
underlying issues in the case.” See Krueger v. New York Tel. Co., No. Civ. A. 93 CIV. 0178
(LMM), 93 CIV. 0179 (LMM), 1993 WL 276058, at *2 (S.D. N.Y. July 21, 1993); see also
Harper v. Lovett’s Buffet, Inc., 185 F.R.D. 358, 365 (M.D. Ala. 1999) (“subsequent discovery
8

Dreyer v. Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., CIV.A. H-08-1212, 2008 WL 5204149 (S.D.
Tex. Dec. 11, 2008) (“This argument fails because exemptions are merits-based defenses to an
FLSA claim.”).
9

Walker v. Honghua Am., LLC, 870 F. Supp. 2d 462, 465 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (“Indeed, as
discovery usually has not been conducted at this stage, courts do not review the underlying
merits of the action in determining whether to conditionally certify.”).
3

may reinforce or undermine” the preliminary finding of similarly situated). Thus, it is at the
second stage, and not the initial conditional certification stage that a court can look into possible
defenses and individual differences between plaintiffs.10 Plaintiff does not have the benefit of
any discovery at this time. The analysis at this early stage is that the putative class members
share similarities in job responsibilities and were subject to a similar pay provision. The merits
of the case are considered during the second stage.

Nevertheless, Plaintiff has a strong

likelihood to succeed on the merits of his underlying case.11
A. The standard for granting conditional certification in a collective action is
“lenient” and substantially lower than the standard for a Rule 23 class
action.
i. Section 216(b) only requires Plaintiffs be similarly situated.
Plaintiff seeks conditional certification and court-facilitated notice in this collective
action pursuant to section 216(b) of the FLSA. See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). Unlike a Rule 23 class
action in which prospective claimants must opt-out, conditional certification of a collective
action under section 216(b) requires similarly situated employees to affirmatively opt into the
litigation. Roussell v. Brinker Intern., Inc., Nos. 09–20561, 10–20614, 2011 WL 4067171 (5th
Cir. Tex. Sept. 14, 2011) (citing Sandoz v. Cingular Wireless LLC, 553 F.3d 913, 916 (5th Cir.
2008)). The FLSA’s collective action mechanism allows for efficient adjudication of similar
claims so that “similarly situated” employees whose claims are often small, may join together

10

Id. at 466 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (“At the second stage of the analysis, the defendant moves to
‘decertify’ the conditionally-certified class. The court then must make a factual determination as
to whether the employees are similarly situated; if it so finds, the collective action may
proceed.”) (internal citations omitted).

and pool their resources to prosecute their claims. See Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling, 493
U.S. 165, 170 (1989).
ii. The courts in this district apply a two-stage certification process.
With respect to the standard for conditionally certifying a collective action, this Court
stated that it generally uses the two step approach as described in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp., 118
F.R.D. 351 (D.N.J.1987).12 The first stage in determination is the “notice stage.” At this stage,
the Court inquires as to whether Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence that similarly situated
plaintiffs exist. Hayes v. Laroy Thomas, Inc., 2006 WL 1004991, *2 (E.D. Tex. 2007) (Citing
Haynes v. Singer Co., 696 F.2d 884, 887 (11th Cir. 1983)); Mooney v. Aramco Servs. Co., 54
F.3rd 1207, 1213-14 (5th Cir. 1995)). The Court makes this determination and decides whether
notice should be given to potential class members based only on the pleadings and any affidavits
which have been submitted by the Plaintiff. Beall v. Tyler Technologies, Inc., 2009 WL 1766141
(E.D.Tex. June 23, 2009). The Beall Court held:
The standard requires nothing more than "substantial allegations that the putative
class members were victims of a single decision, policy, or plan." . . . Notice is
appropriate if the court concludes that there is some factual nexus which binds the
named plaintiffs and potential class members together as victims of a particular
alleged policy or practice.
Id. at *2 (emphasis added) (citing Mooney, 54 F.3d at 1214). At the second stage, the Court reexamines the class after notice, time for opting-in, and discovery have taken place. If it finds the
class is no longer made up of similarly situated persons, it may decertify the class.
iii. Plaintiff’s burden at the first stage has been described as “fairly
lenient.”

McCloud v. McClinton Energy Group, L.L.C., 7-14-CIV-120, 2015 WL 737024, at *2 (W.D.
Tex. Feb. 20, 2015); see also, Mateos v. Select Energy Servs., LLC., 977 F.Supp.2d 640, 643
(W.D. Tex. 2013).

At the “notice stage,” the plaintiff bears the burden of showing there are other employees
“similarly situated.” Id; H & R Block, Ltd. v. Housden, 186 F.R.D. 399, 400 (E.D.Tex. 1999).
This burden, however, is very low and has been described as “fairly lenient.” Hayes, 2006 WL
1004991 at *7; Mooney, 54 F.3d at 1214. At the notice stage, the inquiry by the court is
considerably less rigorous than the court's initial inquiry under the Rule 23 approach. Ryan v.
Staff Care, Inc., 497 F.Supp.2d 820, 824 (N.D.Tex. 2007) (citing Mooney, 54 F.3d at 1214).
Further, the “similarly situated” requirement of § 216(b) is less stringent than the “similarly
situated” requirement of Rules 20 and 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Ryan, 497
F.Supp.2d at 825 (citing Grayson v. K Mart Corporation, 79 F.3d 1086, 1096 (11th Cir. 1996)).
Moreover, [t]he Fifth Circuit has also stated that ‘[t]here is a fundamental, irreconcilable
difference between the class action described by [Rule 23] and that provided for by [Section
216(b) ],’ i.e., the ‘opt out’ procedure for class members under Rule 23 as opposed to the ‘opt in’
procedure under Section 216(b).”13
Further, in order to determine whether there are “similarly situated” class members, some
courts have found it helpful to see if plaintiffs demonstrates: “(1) there is a reasonable basis for
crediting the assertion that aggrieved individuals exist; (2) those aggrieved individuals are
similarly situated to the plaintiff in relevant respects given the claims and defenses asserted; and
(3) those individuals want to opt in to the lawsuit.”14 Several courts have found that a “plaintiff
need not prove evidence of the third element” which is that “those individuals want to opt in to

the lawsuit.”15 Therefore, at the notice stage, the district court’s broad discretion is constrained
in favor of the fairly lenient similarly situated standard of the FLSA afforded to Plaintiff.16
Although the degree to which potential opt-in plaintiffs must be similarly situated has not
been precisely defined, courts agree that “Plaintiffs need only show that their positions are
similar, not identical.” Hayes 2006 WL 1004991 at *6 n. 3; Page, 2013 WL 4782749 *6 (S.D.
Tex. Sept. 6, 2013) (citing Yaklin v. W–H Energy Servs., Inc., No. C–07–422, 2008 WL
1989795, at *2 (S.D.Tex. May 2, 2008)). “The court should satisfy itself that there are other
employees of the defendant who are ‘similarly situated’ with respect to their job requirements
and pay provisions.” Allen v. McWane, 2006 WL 3246531 at *2 (E.D.Tex. Nov. 7, 2006).
“Notice is appropriate when a court concludes that there is a factual nexus that binds the named
plaintiffs and potential class members as victims of a particular alleged policy or practice.”
Allen, 2006 WL 3246531 at *2 (citing Villatoro v. Kim Son Restaurant, L.P., 286 F.Supp.2d 807,
810 (S.D.Tex. 2003)). Further, Plaintiff must show that the potential opt-in plaintiffs have
similar “identifiable facts or legal nexus . . . so that hearing the cases together promotes judicial
efficiency.” Marsh v. Butler County Sch. Sys., 242 F.Supp.2d 1086, 1093 (M.D. Ala. 2003)
(citing Sheffield v. Orius Corp., 211 F.R.D. 411, 416 (D. Or. 2002)).
In a case granting class notice, a Texas court held: [T]he court need not find uniformity in

B. Plaintiff and the proposed Class are similarly situated and conditional
certification should be granted.
Plaintiff and the class members are a cohesive group of workers with similar job
responsibilities and are paid in the same manner, hourly without regard for overtime.17 Plaintiff
worked more than 40 hours in a workweek as flow testers for Defendants.18 In fact, Plaintiff
regularly worked well over 80 hours per week.19

Plaintiff is an hourly paid non-exempt

employee who worked as a flow tester to monitor and maintain oil and gas wells for Defendants’
customers around the country.
Defendants paid Plaintiff the same hourly rate for both regular and overtime hours
worked.20 The FLSA requires the employer to compensate its employees for all of their hours
worked at the one-and-one-half the regular rate of pay for overtime hours.21 If employees work
more than forty hours in a work week, the employer must pay them the overtime premium (one
and one-half times the regular hourly rate) based on the effective hourly rate.22 The named

Plaintiff regularly worked more than forty hours per week.23 Defendants violated the overtime
laws.
Defendants likewise failed to pay overtime to other similarly situated workers throughout
Texas areas.24 Defendants paid these flow testers an hourly rate without regard for overtime.25
That is, even when class members worked over forty hours in a workweek, they still received
compensation at the same rate they were compensated when working less than forty hours in a
workweek.26
Defendants hired and fired, issued pay, supervised, directed, disciplined, scheduled and
performed all other duties generally associated with that of an employer with regard to the
Plaintiff and Class Members.27 In addition, Defendants instructed Plaintiff and Class Members
regarding when, where, and how they were to perform their work.28 The work Plaintiff and Class
Members performed was an integral part of the Defendants’ business.29 The named Plaintiff and
the proposed Class are similarly situated in the following relevant respects:

assigned to all flow testers including separators, pipe, light plants, and
manifolds.42
Plaintiff has declared that the above is true. Given this evidence, the Court should find
that Plaintiff has shown there is a reasonable belief that the proposed class of flow testers is
similarly situated to Plaintiff.43
C. Other flow testers want to opt-in to this lawsuit.
Even though most courts do not require a showing that at least a few individuals seek to
join the lawsuit,44 here the Plaintiff has provided evidence of such interest. Currently, one class

reasons for this. First, as already stated, this element is not a statutory requirement at this stage.
Second, this element has not been required, or even discussed, by any higher court opinion that
this court has been able to find or to which the parties have cited. Rather, the Fifth Circuit’s
discuss ion of the Lusardi approach only requires, at the first stage, that “putative class members’

member has joined this litigation and written a declaration in support of conditional
certification.45 In the declaration of opt-in Alvin Garvey and of the named Plaintiff, Rory Dyson,
they state that they believe additional flow testers would join if the Court intervened and

THE PROPOSED NOTICE IS TIMELY ACCURATE AND INFORMATIVE.
THE NOTICE SHOULD BE SENT VIA REGULAR MAIL AND EMAIL.
Plaintiff’s proposed court-approved notice (see Ex. A) to the potential opt-ins is “timely,

accurate, and informative,” as required. Hoffmann-La Roche, 493 U.S. at 172. It provides
accurate notice of the pendency of the action and of the opportunity to opt in. Potential opt-ins
are advised that they are not required to participate. Plaintiff request that Defendants be ordered
to produce within ten (10) days of the granting of this Motion in an electronic format such as an
excel spreadsheet, the names, all known addresses, all phone numbers (home, mobile, etc.), dates
of birth, all known email addresses (work and personal), social security numbers, and dates of
employment for all the class members employed from three years prior to the filing of this
lawsuit to the present.48 Such information allows Plaintiff to confirm current addresses and/or to

Further, Plaintiff proposes that the notice and consent forms be mailed by first class mail

counsel requests that it be permitted to hire a third party class action administration company to
conduct the actual mailing of the notice and forms if it deems appropriate.
The benefits50 of sending notice in a conditional certification case “depend on employees
receiving accurate and timely notice concerning the pendency of the collective action, so that
they can make informed decisions about whether to participate.”51 The point of sending out
Notice to Class Members is for them to receive it, become aware of the pending litigation, and
make a decision regarding joining the case. Sending email notice only increases the chance of
the class members receiving and reading the notice. The federal court system is based on an
electronic case filing system and email notice precisely because it is an affordable, instantaneous,
and reliable way for important legal issues to be communicated to large groups of people.

Exhibit “G” (example of a Right Signature executed form).

59

In Texas under the Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 322 et. al. (Vernon), the law recognizes the
validity of electronic signatures. Specifically, it states that a “signature may not be denied legal
effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. §
322.007 (Vernon). Further, it proceeds to state that “if a law requires a signature, an electronic
signature satisfies the law.” In this instance, the FLSA requires a plaintiff to file a written
consent form in order to join the lawsuit. See 29 U.S.C.A. § 216 (West) (”No employee shall be
a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party
and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.”); See also, 29 U.S.C.A. §
256 (West). Consequently, Texas law allows for the use of electronic signatures to be used to
execute FLSA consent forms.

counsel who will, in turn, file same with the Court, just as if such document had been received

Recently, two courts in the Fifth Circuit have approved the use of online electronic
signature opt-in forms.61 See White v. Integrated Elec. Tech., Inc., 2013 WL 2903070 (E.D. La.
June 13, 2013); Jones v. JGC Dallas LLC, 2012 WL 6928101 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 29, 2012). Both
Jones and White permitted this method of response over the objection of the Defendant. Even
more recently, the Western District of Pennsylvania noted that this method of joining a collective
action appropriate. See Bland v. Calfrac Well Servs. Corp., 2013 WL 4054594 (W.D. Pa. Aug.

Finally, Plaintiff requests that class members be given 60 days to opt into the lawsuit.62
Such amount of time is reasonable, and will not delay the proceedings. Further, Plaintiff request
that a second notice go out thirty days prior to the deadline to opt-in, but only to those
individuals who have not opted in to the lawsuit.

CONCLUSION

At this pre-discovery, preliminary stage, Plaintiff has adduced sufficient factual basis
from which this Court can determine that similarly situated plaintiffs exist. Thus, the Court
should grant Plaintiff’s Motion and provide Plaintiff with the discovery requested, conditionally
certify the case, and allow the Plaintiff to send out Notice. The case should be certified with
respect to:
All current and former hourly-paid workers classified as independent
contractors who performed work for Defendants associated with monitoring
and maintaining oil and gas wells throughout the United States during the
three-year period before the filing of this Complaint up to the date the Court
authorizes notice.
