Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 20 Filed 11/21/13 Page 5 of 18 PagelD #: 240

Plaintiff Bradley Tankiewicz respectfully submits this Memorandum of Law in
Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss made by Defendant United Service Workers Union Local
74 ("Local 74"), dated October 11, 2013, based on Defendant Local 74's violation of 0x00A7 301 of
the Labor Management Relations Act (""LMRA"), 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 185. Defendant Local 74's
Motion should be denied in all respects as Plaintiff has properly stated a cause of action.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff began working for Defendant Pinelawn in May 2005 as a Driver/Maintenance
Worker. (Compl. { 28). Plaintiff satisfactorily performed his duties for more than six years.
(Compl. 0x00A7 30). On or about July 9, 2010, Plaintiff sustained a work-related injury. (Compl. |
30). Plaintiff tore his rotator cuff and suffered an inguinal hernia while lifting a casket. Id. He
filed for worker's compensation benefits and was out of work for the next eleven months.
(Compl. { 34). Despite two corrective surgeries, Plaintiff continued to suffer extreme pain,
especially when coughing, bending over or lifting heavy objects. (Compl. 0x00A70x00A7 35-37). Plaintiff
also suffered continual swelling and pain in his testicles. Id.

On or about Spring 2011, Plaintiff advised Defendant Pinelawn he wished to return to
work. (Compl. { 38). Defendant Pinelawn refused to allow Plaintiff to return to work until he
could demonstrate that he was 100% healed or had "no restrictions." (Compl. J 39). On or
about June 2011, Plaintiffs doctors provided him with a note authorizing him to return to work
without restrictions. (Compl. 0x00A7 40).

Upon Plaintiff's return to work, Defendant Pinelawn began a campaign of harassment
and intimidation against Plaintiff on the basis of his physical disabilities and in retaliation for
taking extended leave. (Compl. 42). On Plaintiffs first day back to work, Defendant Pinelawn

assigned him the physically arduous task of tamping graves. (Compl. ] 43). Plaintiff

 
 

 

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 20 Filed 11/21/13 Page 6 of 18 PagelD #: 241

complained to Defendant Pinelawn that operating the tamping machine was very difficult and
aggravated his disabilities. (Compl. J 44). Defendant Pinelawn ignored Plaintiffs complaints
and refused to assign Plaintiff duties consistent with his physical limitations. (Compl. 45).
Defendant Pinelawn also began to excessively scrutinize Plaintiff's work performance. (Compl.
4 46). Over the next year, Defendant Pinelawn issued more than 60 written performance write-
ups to Plaintiff for trivial or non-existent infractions. Id.

On or about September 2012, after months of arduous physical labor, Plaintiff began to
experience severe pain in his lower back. (Compl. 0x00A7 47). Plaintiff's chiropractor determined his
back strain was directly caused by operating the tamping machine. (Compl. 4 49). Nevertheless,
Defendant Pinelawn refused to relieve Plaintiff of this duty. (Compl. 951).

On or about November 2012, Defendant Pinelawn discovered one of its bulldozers had
been intentionally destroyed in a fire. (Compl. 52). Defendant Pinelawn purportedly
conducted an internal investigation. (Compl. 0x00A7 53). Plaintiff denied knowledge of or
participation in the incident. (Compl. 4 55). Without any evidence whatsoever, Defendant
Pinelawn's investigators told Plaintiff they "had reason to believe that he was involved."
(Compl. { 55). On or about December 2012, Defendant Pinelawn sent Plaintiff a letter stating it
had "identified the person responsible for the arson." (Compl. 0x00A7 56).

Between December 2012 through January 2013, Defendant Pinelawn continued its
campaign of harassment against Plaintiff. On or about December 2012, Defendant Pinelawn
suspended Plaintiff for three days because he dumped top soil five minutes early. (Compl. { 57).
Defendant Pinelawn has no rule prohibiting employees from arriving early to dump top soil.

Plaintiff filed a grievance with Defendant Local 74 regarding the suspension. (Compl. 0x00A7 58). On

 
 

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 20 Filed 11/21/13 Page 7 of 18 PagelD #: 242

or about January 2013, Defendant Pinelawn denied Plaintiff his Christmas bonus. (Compl. [ff
59-60).

On March 21, 2013, Plaintiff called Defendant Pinelawn to report that he was suffering
intense lower back pain and was unable to work. (Compl. 0x00A7 61). On March 22, 2013, Plaintiff
again called Defendant Pinelawn to report that he was ill and unable to work. (Compl. 4 62).
Plaintiff sought treatment from his chiropractor who determined he was physically unable to
work. (Compl. { 63). Plaintiff faxed to Defendant Pinelawn a doctor's note stating Plaintiff was
"under doctor's care until Monday, March 25, 2013." (Compl. 0x00A7 63-64). That afternoon,
Plaintiff's supervisor - George Molna - called Plaintiff at home and told him it was "mandatory"
that he come to work the next day, Saturday, March 23, 2013. (Compl. J 65). On March 23,
2013, Defendant Pinelawn's owner - Justin Locke - called Plaintiff's cellphone and left a
message which stated: "You have been terminated as of today. We believe you had prior
knowledge of the bulldozer arson." (Compl. 0x00A7 66).

On or about April 2013, Plaintiff filed a formal grievance with Defendant Local 74
regarding his unlawful discharge. (Compl. 0x00A7 72). On or about April 23, 2013, Defendant Local
74 held a grievance meeting regarding Plaintiff's December 2012 suspension. (Compl. 4 73). At
the conclusion of the grievance meeting, Plaintiff asked Mike Herron, the Shop Steward, the
status of his grievance regarding his discharge. (Compl. J 75). Herron told Plaintiff "I'll get
back to you." Id. To date, Defendant Local 74 has failed to pursue a grievance on behalf of
Plaintiff regarding his discharge. (Compl. 0x00A7 76).

Defendant Local 74's conduct toward Plaintiff is arbitrary, discriminatory and/or with
malice and in bad faith. (Compl. { 77). Plaintiff had a meritorious grievance in that there was

absolutely no evidence he had any prior knowledge of the incident, Defendant Local 74 was

 

 
 

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 20 Filed 11/21/13 Page 8 of 18 PagelD #: 243

aware of Plaintiff's grievance, and the union has acted arbitrarily in failing to process the
grievance. (Compl. 7 78). Defendant Local 74 failed in its duty of fair representation to Plaintiff
by failing to press Plaintiffs meritorious claims in a reasonable and adequate manner. (Compl. {
79). Defendant Local 74 has caused injury to Plaintiff by denying him the benefits of the CBA.
(Compl. 0x00A7 80).

In addition, Defendant Pinelawn breached the CBA by discharging Plaintiff without just
cause. (Compl. { 86).

ARGUMENT
POINT I
LOCAL 74'S MOTION TO DISMISS MUST BE DENIED AS PLAINTIFF HAS
ALLEGED FACTS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT HIS BREACH OF THE DUTY OF
FAIR REPRESENTATION CLAIM

Dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is
proper only where plaintiff has not alleged "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face." See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 55 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974
(2007). Procedure requires only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleader is entitled to relief." Fed Rule Civ. P. 8(a)(2); see also Streit v. Bushnell, 424 F.Supp.2d
633, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (explaining that in reviewing a complaint for legal sufficiency for the
purposes of adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court's point of departure is Rule 8(a)(2)).
Thus, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the test is not whether a plaintiff is likely to prevail ultimately,
but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support his claims. See Chance v.
Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 701 (2d Cir. 1998).

In order to be facially plausible, a complaint cannot make merely "a formulaic recitation

of the elements of a cause of action," but must allege facts that raise a right of relief above the

 
 

(ll RAN sce oR ts Nia anh GE

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 20 Filed 11/21/13 Page 9 of 18 PagelD #: 244

speculative level on the assumption that all allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful
in fact). See Bell Atlantic, 550 U.S. at 555. The Second Circuit has interpreted the foregoing
language to "requir[e] a flexible `plausibility standard,' which obliges a pleader to amplify a
claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to
render the claim plausible," rather than to mandate a "universal standard of heightened fact
pleading." See Clergeau v. Local 1181, Amalgamated Transit Union, AFL-CIO, 2008 WL
3334035, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2008).

In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must accept the factual allegations in the
complaint as true, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in the plaintiff's favor. See Emergent
Capital Inv. Mgmt., LLC v. Stonepath Group, Inc., 343 F.3d 189, 194 (2d Cir. 2003). Clearly,
the standard to be applied by a court in ruling upon a motion to dismiss places a heavy burden on
the moving party in light of the liberal pleading standards of the Fed. R. Civ. P. As set forth
below, the allegations of Plaintiff's complaint set forth sufficient facts to allow him the
opportunity to offer evidence in support of his breach of the duty of fair representation claim
against Local 74.

POINT I

PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED FACTS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT LOCAL 74'S
CONDUCT WAS ARBITRARY, DISCRIMINATORY AND IN BAD FAITH

"It has long been established that an individual employee may bring suit against his
employer for breach of a collective bargaining agreement." See DelCostello v. Int'] Bhd. Of
Teamsters, 461 U.S. 151, 163, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2290 (1983). An employee ordinarily "is
required to attempt to exhaust any grievance or arbitration remedies provided in the collective
bargaining agreement" before filing suit, however, and therefore may only sue his employer

under Section 301 if the employee's union has also "breach[ed] its duty of fair representation" to

5

 
 

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 20 Filed 11/21/13 Page 10 of 18 PagelD #: 245

the employee. See DelCostello, 462 U.S. at 163-64; see also Dougherty v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co.,

 

902 F.2d 201, 203 (2d Cir. 1990). To prevail on such a "hybrid 0x00A7 301/duty of fair representation
claim," the plaintiff "must demonstrate both (1) that [the employer] breached its collective
bargaining agreement and (2) that [the union] breached its duty of fair representation. See
Sanozky, v. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 415 F.3d 279, 282 (2d Cir. 2005);
see also DelCostello, 462 U.S. at 164-65 (outlining the two claims and identifying them as
"inextricably interdependent"). Thus, although the plaintiff need not name both the employer
and the union as defendants, the plaintiff must prove fault by both in order to succeed against
either. See Carrion v. Enterprise Ass'n Metal Trades Branch Local Union 638, 227 F.3d 29, 33
(2d Cir. 2000); see also DelCostello, 462 U.S. at 165 ("The employee may . . . sue one defendant
and not the other; but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one, the other, or
both.").
It is well established that a union has a duty to represent fairly all employees subject to
the collective bargaining agreement. See Spellacy v. Airline Pilots Ass'n Int'l, 156 F.3d 120,
126 (2d Cir. 1998), citing Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. ONeill, 499 U.S. 65, 74, 111 S.Ct. 1127,
1134 (1991). The Supreme Court has explained the basis for the duty of fair representation as
follows:
The duty of fair representation exists because it is the policy of the
National Labor Relations Act to allow a single labor organization
to represent collectively the interests of all employees within a
unit, thereby depriving individuals in the unit of the ability to
bargain individually or to select a minority union as their
representative. In such a system, if individual employees are not to
be deprived of all effective means of protecting their own interests,
it must be the duty of the representative organization to serve the
interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward

any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and
honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct.
