PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This memorandum of law is submitted on behalf of defendant United Service Workers
Union Local 74 (hereinafter “Local 74”) in support of its motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).
The complaint should be dismissed as against Local 74 for failure to state a claim, as
plaintiff does not sufficiently allege that Local 74 violated its duty of fair representation in this
matter, or that defendant Pinelawn Cemetery (“Pinelawn”) violated the applicable collective
bargaining agreement by terminating plaintiff’s employment. Additionally, leave to amend the
complaint or re-file should be denied by the Court as the deficiencies in plaintiff’s complaint
cannot be cured, therefore, any amendment or re-filing of the claim against Local 74 would be
futile.
FACTS 1
Defendant Local 74 is a labor organization representing certain employees of defendant
Pinelawn Cemetery (“Pinelawn”). (Doc. 1, Compl. ¶¶11-12) Local 74 and Pinelawn are
signatories to a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”), which, inter alia, sets the terms and
conditions of employment of employees such as plaintiff. (Id. ¶9; CBA between Local 74 (or its
predecessor unions) and Pinelawn, a copy of which is annexed as Exhibit “A” to the Declaration
of Zachary Harkin, Esq.) 2 Plaintiff is an individual previously employed by Pinelawn and
represented by Local 74 pursuant to the CBA. (Id.)

1

The properly alleged facts contained in the complaint are deemed true only for purposes of this motion.

2

Consideration of the CBA as part of the instant Rule 12(b)(6) motion is appropriate because it is
incorporated by reference in plaintiff’s complaint. See Hoy v. Inc. Village of Bayville, 765 F.Supp.2d
158, 163 (E.D.N.Y. 2011)(stating that a court may consider, inter alia, documents that are incorporated
by reference in the complaint on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss).

1

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 16 Filed 10/11/13 Page 7 of 18 PageID #: 129

On or about March 23, 2013, plaintiff was terminated from his employment with
Pinelawn for having prior knowledge of a suspected act of arson that destroyed a bulldozer
belonging to Pinelawn and failing to warn Pinelawn or contact law enforcement regarding same.
(Id. ¶66; March 26, 2013 termination letter, a copy of which is annexed as Exhibit “B” to the
Declaration of Zachary Harkin, Esq.) 3 Plaintiff’s termination was also based on the fact that
Pinelawn believed he lied to Pinelawn’s investigators when he denied any knowledge of the
incident in question, and plaintiff’s extremely poor work record and disciplinary history. (March
26, 2013 termination letter, Ex. “B” to Harkin Decl.) On April 3, 2013, Local 74 grieved this
termination on behalf of plaintiff. (Id. ¶72; April 3, 2013 grievance letter, a copy of which is
annexed as Exhibit “C” to the Declaration of Zachary Harkin, Esq.) 4 On or about April 23,
2013, plaintiff, Local 74, and Pinelawn attended a grievance meeting regarding a prior
disciplinary incident from December 2012. (Compl. ¶73) At this meeting, Local 74
representative Mike Herron advised plaintiff that he would get back to him regarding his April 3,
2013 termination grievance. (Compl. ¶75) Local 74 declined to proceed to arbitration with
respect to plaintiff’s April 3, 2013 termination grievance. (Compl. ¶76)
Under the CBA, Pinelawn must have just cause to discipline or terminate covered
employees. (CBA, Harkin Decl. Ex. “A”) The CBA does not give an individual employee the
right to an arbitration hearing regarding his or her termination, does not entitle the employee to

3

Consideration of the March 26, 2013 termination letter as part of the instant Rule 12(b)(6) motion is
appropriate because the termination letter is incorporated by reference in the complaint, and integral to the
complaint and relied upon therein. See Hoy v. Inc. Village of Bayville, 765 F.Supp.2d at 163 (allowing
consideration of “documents ‘integral’ to the complaint and relied upon in it, even if not attached or
incorporated by reference”).
4

Consideration of the April 3, 2013 grievance letter as part of the instant Rule 12(b)(6) motion is
appropriate because the grievance letter is incorporated by reference in the complaint, and integral to the
complaint and relied upon therein. See Hoy supra.

reinstatement or back pay, and does not provide an individual employee with a reasonable time
to prepare a defense. (Id.) The only parties to the CBA and arbitration agreement found therein
are Local 74 (or its predecessors) and Pinelawn. (Id.) Under the CBA and controlling legal
authority, only Local 74 has the authority to arbitrate grievances arising under the CBA. (Id.) 5
ARGUMENT
POINT I
STANDARDS APPLICABLE ON THIS RULE 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS
To survive a motion to dismiss, the proposed amended complaint “must contain sufficient
factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,
550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007)). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff
pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is
liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id., citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955.
“[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.”
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. at 1950. “The complaint must be enough to raise a right to relief
above the speculative level.” Scroxton v. Town of Southold, 2010 WL 1223010, at *3
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2010) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955). “[W]here the wellpleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the
complaint has alleged-but it has not ‘show[n]’-‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Iqbal, 556
U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. at 1950, quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2). A complaint that merely
asserts “‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement’” fails to comply with Rule

5

“[I]t is of course well-established that a disaffected employee has no absolute right to have her grievance
taken to arbitration.” Smith v. Drug, Chem., Cosmetic, Plastics & Affiliated Indus. Warehouse
Employees Local 815, 943 F.Supp. 224, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 1996)(citing Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 191, 87
S.Ct. 903, 917 (1967)).

3

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 16 Filed 10/11/13 Page 9 of 18 PageID #: 131

8. Id., quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557. The general rule that a court must accept as true all
the allegations in the complaint does not apply to legal conclusions. U.S. v. Bonanno Organized
Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, 879 F.2d 20, 27 (2d Cir. 1989) (“[L]egal conclusions,
deductions or opinions couched as factual allegations are not given a presumption of
truthfulness.” [citations omitted]).
Applying the above principles to the instant action, plaintiff has failed to allege facts that
cross the “line from conceivable to plausible” and the complaint must be dismissed in turn.
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. The complaint is replete with allegations that are nothing more than
conclusory statements completely devoid of sufficient factual enhancement. As such, the Court
should not accept as true the allegations in the complaint that are of a conclusory nature. (See,
e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 77, 78) Plaintiff’s remaining allegations do not plausibly establish a hybrid
Section 301/fair representation cause of action, as he does not plausibly allege a claim for breach
of the duty of fair representation by Local 74, or breach of the CBA by Pinelawn. Accordingly,
the action against Local 74 should be dismissed in its entirety.
It is also important to note the apparent “artful” pleading of plaintiff’s complaint in
determining the instant motion to dismiss. Plaintiff makes some factual allegations up to a certain
point in the complaint, and then resorts to legal conclusions and generalized statements (e.g. from
the date of his termination moving forward) with respect to matters upon which it is believed
plaintiff had specific knowledge. Local 74 submits that plaintiff’s “cherry picking” of factual
allegations should be considered in deciding the instant motion to dismiss, especially with respect
to whether the documents submitted by Local 74 herein can be considered under Rule 12(b)(6)
standards.

POINT II
PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A HYBRID LMRA SECTION 301/BREACH
OF THE DFR CLAIM
Plaintiff’s alleges a breach of the duty of fair representation by Local 74 as part of his
hybrid Section 301/fair representation claim against Local 74 and Pinelawn. 6 It is well settled
that “[t]o prevail on a hybrid § 301/fair representation claim, a plaintiff must not only show that
his discharge was contrary to the contract, but must also demonstrate breach of duty by his
union.” Giglio v. Buonnadonna Shoprite, LLC, 2009 WL 3150431, *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 25,
2009). Thus, in order to properly allege a hybrid Section 301/fair representation claim against
either Local 74 or Pinelawn, plaintiff must properly allege a breach of Local 74’s duty of fair
representation, and a violation of the applicable CBA by Pinelawn in connection with his
termination from employment.
As explained below, plaintiff has not properly alleged either component of his hybrid
Section 301/fair representation claim. Accordingly, the complaint should be dismissed as to
Local 74.
A.

Plaintiff fails to state a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation

Whether plaintiff has made out a proper breach of the duty of fair representation claim is
the threshold analysis in determining if plaintiff has asserted a valid Section 301/fair
representation claim. Jordan v. Viacom Outdoor Group, 475 F.Supp.2d 440, 444 (S.D.N.Y.
2007). In the case at bar, plaintiff fails to properly allege the fair representation aspect of his
hybrid claim, therefore, this claim must be dismissed.

6

Hybrid § 301/fair representation suits are governed by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations
Act (29 U.S.C. § 185) and the implied duty of fair representation under the National Labor Relations Act
(29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.). Carrion v. Enter. Ass’n, Metal Trades Branch Local Union 638, 227 F.3d 29,
33 (2d Cir. 2000).

5

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 16 Filed 10/11/13 Page 11 of 18 PageID #: 133

To establish a breach of the duty of fair representation by a union, a plaintiff must
establish: (1) “that the union’s actions or inactions are either arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad
faith,” and (2) “a causal connection between the union’s wrongful conduct and their injuries.”
Llanos v. Brookdale Univ. Hosp. & Med. Center, 2011 WL 809615, *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2011)
(internal quotations omitted).
In crafting the duty of fair representation standard, courts have recognized that judicial
review of union action in enforcing the collective bargaining agreement “must be highly
deferential, recognizing the wide latitude that [unions] need for the effective performance of their
bargaining responsibilities.” Spellacy v. Airline Pilots Assoc. International, 156 F.3d 120, 126
(2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Gvozdenovic v. United Airlines, Inc., 933 F.2d 1100, 1106 (2d Cir.
1991) (internal citations omitted)), cert. denied 526 U.S. 1017, 119 S.Ct. 1251 (1999).
As such, the difficult standard necessary to state a breach of the duty of fair
representation claim was recited by this Court as follows:
“A union does not breach its duty of fair representation when it ‘fails to
process a meritless grievance, engages in mere negligent conduct, or fails
to process a grievance due to error in evaluating the merits of the
grievance.’ “ Soto v. ECC Indus., Inc., No. 05–CV–4764, 2007 U .S. Dist.
LEXIS 80603, at *15 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 31, 2007). Moreover, “a union's
failure or refusal to pursue a grievance on its own does not constitute a
breach of the duty of fair representation unless that failure or refusal may
be fairly characterized as so far outside of a wide range of reasonableness
that it is wholly irrational or arbitrary.” Vera v. Saks & Co., 424 F.Supp.2d
694, 706 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (citations omitted), aff'd 2006 U.S.App. LEXIS
30620 (2d Cir.2006).
Giglio v. Buonnadonna Shoprite, LLC, 2009 WL 3150431, at *5.
In this case, plaintiff’s complaint fails to allege facts supporting a DFR claim. Plaintiff
alleges he was terminated by Pinelawn on March 23, 2013 because Pinelawn believed plaintiff
had prior knowledge of a suspected act of arson that destroyed Pinelawn property, and failed to

6

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 16 Filed 10/11/13 Page 12 of 18 PageID #: 134

warn Pinelawn or contact law enforcement beforehand. (Compl. ¶66, March 26, 2013
termination letter, Ex. “B” to Harkin Decl.) Plaintiff’s termination was also based on the fact
that Pinelawn believed he lied to Pinelawn’s investigators when he denied any knowledge of the
incident in question, and plaintiff’s extremely poor work record and disciplinary history. (March
26, 2013 termination letter, Ex. “B” to Harkin Decl.) In or around April 2013, plaintiff alleges
he “filed a formal grievance” with Local 74 regarding his termination by Pinelawn. (Compl. ¶72)
On April 3, Local 74 representative Mike Herron filed a grievance with Pinelawn regarding the
March 23, 2013 termination on behalf of plaintiff. (April 3, 2013 grievance letter, Ex. “C” to
Harkin Decl.) Plaintiff alleges he spoke with Local 74 representative Mike Herron in person on
April 23, 2013 regarding his April 3, 2013 termination grievance. (Compl. ¶¶73, 75) When
plaintiff inquired regarding the status of his pending grievance, Herron stated that “I’ll get back
to you.” (Id. ¶75) Plaintiff then concludes his allegations by asserting that Local 74 failed and/or
refused to pursue a grievance on his behalf regarding his termination of employment. (Id. ¶¶75,
82)
The above-pled facts do not amount to a valid breach of the duty of fair representation
claim against Local 74. In the complaint, plaintiff’s allegations that Local 74’s failure/refusal to
pursue his termination grievance was “arbitrary, discriminatory, and/or with malice and in bad
faith” are conclusory and without factual support. Moreover, plaintiff’s allegation that Local 74
“acted arbitrarily” in failing to process his “meritorious grievance” is also merely a threadbare
restatement of the applicable legal standard that is supported only with conclusory statements
and suppositions. Where, as in this case, plaintiff has not alleged any actual facts in support of
his fair representation claim, dismissal of the claim is warranted. See Semper v. New York
Methodist Hosp., 786 F.Supp.2d 566, 585-586 (E.D.N.Y. 2011)(dismissing fair representation

7

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 16 Filed 10/11/13 Page 13 of 18 PageID #: 135

claim where “[p]laintiff fail[ed] to make any claim regarding the manner in which or reasons
behind the Union’s failure to process her grievance.”); Llanos v. Brookdale Univ. Hosp. & Med.
Center, 2011 WL 809615, at *3 (granting Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss fair representation
claim where plaintiff failed to allege facts as to why his grievance was meritorious, or why the
union’s refusal to arbitrate was arbitrary or in bad faith)
As in the above-cited cases, plaintiff in the case at bar cannot defeat the instant motion to
dismiss by simply reciting the applicable duty of fair representation standards and baldly
claiming that his grievance was meritorious and that Local 74’s refusal to arbitrate said grievance
was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith. Under controlling legal authority, a union’s
conduct is only arbitrary if, “in light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of the union’s
actions, the union’s behavior is so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational.”
Llanos, 2011 WL 809615, at *3 (citing Sanozky v. Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace
Workers, 415 F.3d 279, 283 (2d Cir. 2005)). In order to establish a union acted in bad faith, it
must be alleged that the union acted “with an improper intent, purpose, or motive.” Spellacy v.
Airline Pilots Ass’n, 156 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 1998). “To be discriminatory, a union’s actions
must be invidious or unlawful.” Nicholls v. Brookdale Univ. Hospital and Medical, 2005 WL
1661093, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. July 14, 2005)(internal quotations omitted), aff’d 204 Fed.Appx. 40
(2d Cir. 2006), see also Moore v. Roadway Express, Inc., 2008 WL 819049, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.
Mar. 25, 2008) (“[D]iscrimination occurs when it favors some of its members at the expense of
others without legitimate purpose.”).
Plaintiff’s allegations clearly do not satisfy this highly deferential standard. In the
complaint, plaintiff admits that Pinelawn notified him that he was being terminated due to his
apparent knowledge of criminal activity that resulted in the destruction of Pinelawn property.

8

Case 2:13-cv-03914-JS-ARL Document 16 Filed 10/11/13 Page 14 of 18 PageID #: 136

(Compl. ¶66) Moreover, plaintiff’s March 26, 2013 termination letter further specifies the
multiple reasonable grounds upon which Pinelawn based its decision to discharge plaintiff. (Ex.
“B” to Harkin Decl.) Plaintiff also admits in his complaint that a grievance meeting was held
with respect to a prior suspension he had received, and that Local 74 represented him at that
meeting. (Compl. ¶¶73-74) Additionally, plaintiff’s complaint alleges that a grievance was filed
regarding his termination in April 2013. (Compl. ¶72) In fact, the grievance plaintiff refers to
was filed by Local 74 at grievant’s request. (April 3, 2013 grievance letter, Ex. “C” to Harkin
Decl.) The complaint then simply alleges that Local 74 failed/refused to pursue his grievance
further. Accordingly, the validly alleged facts in the complaint are insufficient to state a claim
for breach of the duty of fair representation by Local 74. 7
Finally, plaintiff fails to demonstrate the necessary causal connection between Local 74’s
alleged wrongful conduct and his injuries of “past and future lost wages and benefits, [and] past
and future physical and emotional distress.” (Compl. ¶ 87) Vaughn v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n,
Intern., 604 F.3d 703, 709 (2d Cir. 2010) (after establishing that the union’s actions or inactions
are arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith, plaintiffs must then “demonstrate a causal
connection between the union’s wrongful conduct and their injuries”, quoting Spellacy, 156 F.3d
at 126), aff’d 377 Fed.Appx. 88 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Sim v. New York Mailers’ Union
Number 6, 166 F.3d 465 (2d Cir. 1999) (DFR claim must fail for failure to demonstrate a causal
connection).

7

Plaintiff’s allegations that Local 74 denied “him the benefits of the CBA, including his right to arbitrate
his termination and his right to restoration to the damage of Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at
trial” are also conclusory and unsupported by factual claims. Plaintiff does not specify or allege the CBA
provisions in question that give him these rights. Further, the CBA does not actually provide plaintiff
with any of these rights. (Ex. “A” to Harkin Decl.)

Based on the foregoing, plaintiff fails to state a claim against Local 74 for breach of the
duty of fair representation. His hybrid Section 301/fair representation claim should be dismissed
as a result.
B.

Plaintiff fails to state a claim for breach of the CBA by Pinelawn

As set forth above, in order to make out a hybrid Section 301/fair representation claim, a
plaintiff must prove that the union breached its duty of fair representation, and “that the
employer breached a collective bargaining agreement.” White v. White Rose Food, 237 F.3d
174, 178-79 (2d Cir. 2001). Accordingly, “[t]he plaintiff may sue the union or the employer, or
both, but must allege violations on the part of both.” Id.
In this case, plaintiff has failed to allege actual facts that support his bald conclusion that
his grievance was meritorious. For this reason, plaintiff also fails to state a claim against
Pinelawn for a breach of the CBA. In the absence of allegations of a meritorious grievance, it
logically follows that the complaint also lacks viable factual allegations of the breach of the
CBA. Thus, plaintiff’s breach of the CBA claim under LMRA Section 301 is also insufficient as
a matter of law, and dismissal of the entire hybrid Section 301/fair representation claim is
required.
POINT III
THE COURT SHOULD DENY PLAINTIFF LEAVE TO AMEND THE
COMPLAINT OR RE-FILE AGAINST LOCAL 74
If dismissal as to Local 74 is granted pursuant to the above arguments, leave to amend the
complaint or re-file against Local 74 should be denied. Plaintiff’s complaint is a cherry picking
of the few facts that could be construed in favor of plaintiff’s meritless claims. The remaining
facts that are not in the complaint, and which Local 74 believes plaintiff to be aware of, further
bolster the reasonable and permissible nature of the conduct of Local 74 and Pinelawn. As such,

any amendment or re-filing would similarly be deficient and dismissible under Rule 12(b)(6).
See Chepilko v. City of New York, 2010 WL 3926186, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2010) (“‘An
amendment to a pleading will be futile if a proposed claim could not withstand a motion to
dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).’” quoting Dougherty v. Town of N. Hempstead Bd. of Zoning
Appeals, 282 F.3d 83, 88 (2d Cir. 2002)), report and recommendation adopted, 2010 WL
3909211 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010); Lucente v. International Business Machine Corp., 310 F.3d
243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002) (same); Amna v. New York State Dept. of Health, 2009 WL 6497844
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 2009) (recommending denial of motion for leave to amend where plaintiff’s
proposed second amended complaint fails to state a claim), report and recommendation adopted,
2010 WL 2076015 (E.D.N.Y. May 20, 2010).
The deficiencies in plaintiff’s complaint cannot be cured, and any future amendment or
re-filing would be futile and should be denied. See Heller v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 331
Fed.Appx. 766, 768, 2009 WL 1448977, at *1 (2d Cir. 2009) (“[A] district court need not grant
leave to amend if it can rule out any possibility, however unlikely it might be, that an amended
complaint would succeed.”); Health-Chem Corp. v. Baker, 915 F.2d 805, 810 (2d Cir.1990)
(“[W]here, as here, there is no merit in the proposed amendments, leave to amend should be
denied.”).
