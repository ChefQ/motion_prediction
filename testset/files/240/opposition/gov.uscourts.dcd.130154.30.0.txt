MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
SINCLAIR’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND SEALING

FACTS
In certain exhibits to the Opposition of mzmolly and Democratic Underground to Sinclair’s
Motion to Compel Disclosure of mzmolly’s identity, DN 12, efiled on Wednesday, April 30, 2008,
documents used to establish Sinclair’s criminal record contained his birth date. One document also
contained his social security number. The filing of these unredacted documents violated Local Civil
Rule 5.4(f). The data had been submitted by consulting counsel in Florida and Colorado with record
requests to the various state authorities because Sinclair was known to have used over a dozen
aliases, and counsel wanted to make sure that the response was complete. In addition, the birth date
appeared in the reprints of two publicly available web pages from Pueblo County, Colorado and
Pasco County, Florida, which showed outstanding warrants for Sinclair’s arrest in those two
locations. Copies of those web pages were also submitted as Exhibits. It was unquestionably an
error to include this information unredacted, and lead counsel for mzmolly and Democratic
Underground, Paul Alan Levy, has apologized to Sinclair for the error. Levy Affidavit ¶ 2.
Sinclair took no action to have this information redacted or removed from the Court’s

PACER web site on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, April 30 to May 2. Instead, in the early
morning of Saturday, May 3 – when the Clerk’s office was closed and nothing could be removed
from the Court’s PACER site until Monday morning – Sinclair filed a motion to sanction Mr. Levy
and to seal all exhibits pending further review of the Opposition and all supporting exhibits to make
sure that they did not contain personally identifying information in violation of the Local Rules. DN
15; Levy Affidavit ¶ 4. Sinclair’s counsel, Mr. Sibley, made no effort to consult with Mr. Levy
before filing that motion, id., which indeed contains no Certificate of Conference. Also on Saturday
morning, Sinclair undertook to publicize the fact that his social security number could be found on
the Court’s PACER web site by posting that fact on his blog. Levy Affidavit ¶ 3 and Exhibit A.
Sinclair identified the document number containing the information, and gave instructions to his
readers that they could access the information simply by registering for PACER and paying 8 cents
per page for documents they wanted to download. Id.1
Mr. Levy first learned of the erroneous filing on Saturday, when he saw an email calling his
attention to Sinclair’s blog post informing the public how it could obtain his social security number,
Levy Affidavit ¶ 3, and then saw Sinclair’s motion. He immediately looked through exhibits to
identify any other documents, in addition to the one cited by Sinclair, that might contain the
1

The motion mistakenly implies that Public Citizen issued a press release about the filing of
the Opposition to the Motion to Compel, and posted the offending documents on its web site.
Motion at 2 and n.1. In fact, although a press release was issued when counsel first served Rule 45
objections on Mr. Sibley, there has been no press release about the case since. Moreover, until the
Opposition to the Motion to Compel was filed, Sinclair consistently posted every development in
this case on his blog. Hence his complaint about “litigat[ing] this matter in the press” is hard to
fathom.
The Memorandum in Opposition to Sinclair’s motion to compel is indeed posted on the
Public Citizen web site, as is every major brief on the issue of Internet anonymity (and most other
issues) filed by Public Citizen over the past eight years. However, none of the supporting affidavits
and exhibits in this case has been posted on the Public Citizen web site.

forbidden information, and prepared hand-redacted versions of those documents by placing labels
reading “redacted” over the birth date and social security sumber where they appeared. Id. ¶ 5. He
attempted to contact the Court’s ECF help desk by telephone and email, even calling the Court’s
weekend emergency number to learn whether there were any personnel who could take the
unredacted documents down from the Court’s PACER site. He was told that there were no personnel
to perform that task until Monday morning. Id. ¶ 6.
On Monday morning, Mr. Levy contacted the ECF help desk when it first opened. The
Clerk’s Office personnel told Mr. Levy that he would have to file a motion to get the documents
replaced, but that, in the meantime, they would remove the links to the documents from the PACER
site. Id. ¶ 8. Mr. Levy then drafted a Motion to Substitute Documents and tried to contact Mr.
Sibley to get his consent to the motion to substitute. Mr. Sibley was not available. Meanwhile, Mr.
Levy continued to review the Opposition and supporting exhibits to ensure that all references to
Sinclair’s birth date and social security number had been redacted. Id. ¶ 9. He discovered two more
references to the birth date – on two pages in a single exhibit that had been downloaded into PDF
from publicly available “wanted” web sites, showing warrants for Sinclair’s arrest that are still
outstanding. He had Public Citizen staff redact those documents as well, using Adobe Acrobat to
remove the forbidden data and substitute the word “redacted” in each of the two PDF’d web pages.
Id. ¶ 10. He added those documents to his draft motion, and called the ECF help desk to report the
need to redact one more exhibit. Again, the Clerk’s Office removed the link to that Exhibit from the
Court’s PACER site within minutes of the request. Id.
Mr. Levy finally reached Mr. Sibley to ask him to concur in the Motion to Substitute
Documents. Mr. Sibley angrily refused to consent. He said that he had discovered that Sinclair’s

birth date had been published in various places on the Internet; that he was printing those pages and
would be filing a further motion with the Court; that Mr. Levy had better consent to seal all
documents pending his review of the entire filing; and that if not, “you can do as you damn please.”
Id. ¶ 12; DN 19. After delivering these remarks, Mr. Sibley hung up the telephone as Mr. Levy was
trying to respond. Had Mr. Sibley not hung up, Mr. Levy would have told him that he had
conducted a preliminary review and believed that he had found all relevant mentions, and that the
Clerk’s Office had already removed those documents from public access on the PACER site. Id. ¶
12; DN 19.
Later on May 5, Mr. Sibley filed a “supplement to motion to sanction,” asserting that an
exhibit to the Opposition had, in fact, been posted on the Internet, and requesting a sanction of
$100,000 plus “attorney fees for drafting this supplement.” DN 18. Once again, there was no
attempt to confer before filing this motion, and no certificate of conference was provided. Mr. Levy
filed his Motion to Substitute Documents later that date. DN 19. On May 6, Sinclair opposed the
motion to substitute on the ground that Mr. Levy should be required to certify that the identifying
date did not appear in any of the other exhibits, and that pending such a certification, the entire filing
in opposition to his motion to compel should be sealed. DN 20. If Mr. Sibley was unaware when
he filed this document that the relevant documents were no longer publicly available, it is only
because, the day before, he hung up during Mr. Levy’s attempted pre-filing conference before Mr.
Levy could inform him of that fact.2
On May 6, 2008, Sinclair posted to his blog a claim that documents revealing his birth date

The PACER Service Center has advised that it is capable of providing statistical data
showing how many times, and when, any given document was viewed on PACER, but that its policy
is not to supply such information except in response to a grand jury subpoena.

and social security number had been displayed in a YouTube video. Sinclair embedded the video
in that page of his blog. Derke Affidavit ¶ 5. However, when a user clicks on the video, he gets a
message that the video has been removed by its user. The document that appears on the screen of
the video on Sinclair’s web page is too blurry to read any of its content. Sinclair asserts on this blog
page that he has downloaded the video from YouTube and placed it on a CD for filing with the
Court. Id. ¶ 8. A member of the public, Joshua Ray Derke, has submitted an affidavit asserting that
he viewed the video during the short time it was available on YouTube and that, although the text
accompanying the video asserted that Sinclair’s information could be seen on the video, in fact that
video was too small, and the text too blurry, for a viewer to be able to see any such information. Id.
¶ 3.
On May 8, 2008, Sinclair filed a second supplement to his motion for sanctions (again
without any effort to confer or certificate of conference). The motion asserted as fact that an “exhibit
filing which contained Plaintiff’s social security number and date of birth information was posted
on the YouTube.com website . . . and has already been downloaded by an unknown number of
persons.” The brief gave a URL (which was hyperlinked in the brief). However, no supporting
affidavit supports any of these factual assertions (and as the Derke affidavit shows, by May 8 the
unreadable video had been removed days before). Once again, Sinclair asked for a sanction of
$100,000 “including attorney fees for drafting this supplement.”
On May 13, 2008, mzmolly’s reply in support of her motion to substitute documents
contained a certification by Mr. Levy that, as redacted, none of the pages filed in DN 12, including
supporting exhibits, contained Sinclair’s birth date or social security number. DN 28. The attached
Levy Affidavit further confirms that fact. ¶ 12.

ARGUMENT
Counsel for mzmolly and Democratic Underground acknowledge that three exhibits filed in
support of the Opposition to Sinclair’s Motion to Compel Discovery identifying mzmolly were filed
without redaction of personal information about Sinclair which, under Local Rule 5.4(f), should have
been filed with redactions. However, none of the relief sought by Sinclair in his motion should be
granted, for the following reasons.
1. First, the motion was filed without any effort to confer with opposing counsel, as required
by Local Rule 7(m):
counsel shall discuss the anticipated motion with opposing counsel, either in person
or by telephone, in a good faith effort to determine whether there is any opposition
to the relief sought and, if there is opposition, to narrow the areas of disagreement.
Nor does the motion contain the requisite certificate of conference. Regrettably, the pursuit of
motions either without any effort to confer, or based on a purported conference that simply goes
through the motions, because his counsel apparently regards an attempt to discuss the issues to
narrow the dispute as “playing games,” DN 23-2, ¶ 3, has become a pattern for Sinclair in this case.
Denial of his motion for failure to confer may well be an effective way to cure that habit.
2. Perhaps Sinclair will argue that the exposure of his information on the Court’s PACER
web site created an emergency requiring the filing of his motion without conferring. That argument
would fail, however, because as a practical matter, filing a consent motion will always achieve faster
relief than filing an opposed motion. Indeed, as the attached Levy affidavit reveals, a simple call by
Mr. Levy to the ECF help desk at the Clerk’s Office resulted in the almost immediate removal of the
public link to the documents in question from the Court’s PACER site. And when Mr. Levy
attempted to discuss the problem with Sinclair’s counsel by telephone on Monday, May 5, Mr. Sibley
-6-

hung up on him rather than letting Mr. Levy tell him that the public filings on the PACER site had
already been removed. Levy Affidavit ¶ 12. Thus, even assuming that protecting his own privacy
was the real purpose of Sinclair’s motion, filing without consent was not an effective way to achieve
that objective.
3. Turning to the merits, the need for the remedy of temporarily sealing the entire set of
materials filed in support of the Opposition to the Motion to Compel has been mooted because the
certification that the remaining unredacted documents do not contain the information proscribed by
Rule 5.4(f) has already been made, first in the Reply in Support of Motion to Substitute Documents,
DN 28, and now confirmed in the attached Levy Affidavit. The only ground given for the temporary
sealing is the absence of such a certificate. Both the common law and the First Amendment
guarantee the public’s right of access to court documents, and Sinclair does not submit any evidence
that unredacted personal information remains on PACER, that might justify an exception to those
requirements.
4. Mr. Levy’s prompt efforts to cure his mistake, once it was called to his attention,
undercuts the claimed need for sanctions. On Saturday, May 3, after the mistake was called to his
attention, he attempted to get the documents removed from the PACER site, but no personnel were
present who could do that. Levy Affidavit ¶ 6. On Monday morning, May 5, he promptly obtained
such action through calls to the ECF help desk, while presenting a motion to the Court to substitute
redacted filings.
5. Moreover, the record indicates that Sinclair’s real objective was not to protect his privacy,
but to attack his adversary. First, although the mistaken filing was made on April 30 – and Sinclair
stated that evening on his blog that he had reviewed both the brief and its supporting materials, supra
-7-

Page 8 of 11

n. 1 – Sinclair not only made no effort to confer as required by the local rules, but he waited until
the early hours of Saturday morning to file his motion seeking sealing and sanctions, at a time when
it would be more than 48 hours until the documents could be removed from the PACER site. At the
same time, he posted a notice on his own blog, identifying one of the documents in question – the
one document revealing his social security number – by specifying its Docket Number (12-14) and
telling anybody reading his blog how to obtain it from the PACER site, that is, by registering for
PACER and then paying 8 cents per page. These are not the actions of an individual seeking to
guard his privacy. It is, rather, the action of someone trying to create more controversy regardless
of any threats to his privacy, which is quite consistent with his actions throughout this case.
6. Finally we come to the YouTube video that purportedly reveals both his social security
number and his birth date by displaying documents downloaded from PACER.

We say

“purportedly” because there is, in fact, no evidence that these numbers were displayed on YouTube.
We have only the unsworn say-so of his counsel, who signed the May 8 “supplemental opposition”
that so asserts. DN 21. Undersigned counsel have never seen the actual YouTube video, and we
cannot say whether Mr. Sibley saw it while it was on YouTube. However, the Derke Affidavit,
submitted by a member of the public who did see it (and who urged Google to take it down), avers
that the video was too small and too blurry to read the words or numbers. ¶ 3. The embedded
YouTube video image on Sinclair’s blog, cited in the Levy and Derke affidavits, confirms this
statement – it is certainly too blurry for undersigned counsel to read (although counsel acknowledges
that, at his age, his eyes are not so sharp as they used to be). See Levy Affidavit, Exhibit D.
There are further reasons to question the truth of the implicit assertion that the information

-8-

Document 30

Filed 05/19/2008

was visible on YouTube.3 Sinclair claims, on his blog, that he downloaded the video from YouTube,
so that he could burn it onto a CD and file it in this Court. Derke Affidavit ¶ 8. However, he has
not made any such filing. It is quite possible that he has not filed this document because it would
not support his position. He might also be concerned that a forensic examination of the file might
reveal that the video in his possession was not downloaded from YouTube, but rather is the original
video that was then uploaded to YouTube.4 In any event, under the Best Evidence Rule, the
document itself is the best evidence of its contents, and because Sinclair claims to have the original,
the Court should not accept Sinclair’s unsworn characterization of its contents, but should rather
require the filing of the original document that was, according to Sinclair, downloaded from
YouTube. Federal Rules of Evidence, Rules 1002, 1003.
7. Moreover, apart from the many reasons to question the accuracy of Sinclair’s claims that
widespread Internet posting of his personal information resulted from the filings in this case, the fact
remains that Sinclair’s birth date remains available to the public on the Internet even apart from those
filings, as described in the Levy and Derke affidavits. Indeed, two of the documents submitted in
support of the Opposition were themselves found on the Internet, and although the filings themselves
are now redacted, the originals remain online (with birth date information displayed); one of these

3

DN 21 only asserts that exhibits containing the numbers were displayed on YouTube. It
never states that the numbers were discernible.
4

The forensics expert consulted by undersigned counsel indicated that although it is possible
to download a YouTube video (in violation of YouTube’s Terms of Service), instead of just
watching it, YouTube deliberately makes that technically quite difficult (because its business model
is based on viewers using its web site and seeing advertising). If the video was only on YouTube
for a short time (and the Derke Affidavit so suggests), it is less likely that Sinclair could have
successfully downloaded the electronic file, making it more likely that whatever he has is the original
video that was uploaded to YouTube, and not a file downloaded from it. In the event Sinclair ever
files the CD with the Court, we are prepared to make a proper showing on these issues.

documents has been discussed on Sinclair’s own blog. Moreover, the Levy and Derke affidavits
reveal that Sinclair has himself been rather careless in repeatedly displaying his birth date on the
Internet, in ways that would be obvious to any regular Internet user, Levy Affidavit ¶¶ 13, 15, and
by the posting of materials on his own blog in a manner that allows more perceptive users to discern
both his birth date and his social security number. Id. ¶ 14; Derke Affidavit ¶¶ 6, 7. 5
CONCLUSION
The motion for temporary sealing and for monetary sanctions should be denied.

The Derke and Levy affidavits are being submitted to the Court unredacted, with a consent
motion to file under seal. Redactions have been made in the efiled versions to conceal on-line
locations referenced in this brief, which is written in a somewhat conclusory form on this point so
that, consistent with the First Amendment principle of maximizing public access to court records,
only the affidavits need be redacted.
