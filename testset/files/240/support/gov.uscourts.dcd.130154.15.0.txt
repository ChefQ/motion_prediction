UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Lawrence Sinclair,
Case No.: 1:08-cv-00434-HHK
Plaintiff,
MOTION TO SANCTION ATTORNEY
PAUL ALAN LEVY AND TO SEAL
EXHIBITS PENDING FURTHER REVIEW
AND CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE

vs.
TubeSockTedD, mzmolly and
OWNINGLIARS,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/

Plaintiff, Lawrence Sinclair, by and through his undersigned counsel and pursuant to the
anomalous authority of this Court and LCvR 5.4(f)(1) and (3), moves (i) to sanction Paul Alan Levy,
counsel for mzmolly and Democraticunderground.com, and (ii) to temporarily seal exhibits filed by
Mr. Levy pending his review and certification of compliance with LCvR 5.4(f), and for grounds in
support thereof states:
LCvR 5.4(f)(1) and (3) “Privacy Requirements” unequivocally states: “The following
personal identifiers shall be excluded, or redacted where inclusion is necessary, from all
electronically filed documents unless otherwise ordered by the Court . . . Social Security numbers.
If an individual's Social Security number must be included in a pleading, only the last four digits of
that number should be used . . . Dates of birth. If an individual's date of birth must be included in a
pleading, only the year should be used.”
In blatant and callous disregard of this Local Rule, Attorney Paul Alan Levy filed D.E. #1214, at page 3 an exhibit which contained both Plaintiff’s social security number and date of birth
without the requisite redactions.

Moreover, in the spirit of self-promotion which Mr. Levy seems to relish1, his Response has
been posted on Mr. Levy’s law firm’s website and thus presumably been repeatedly copied and
spread irretrievably across the world-wide web. Moreover, as this Court knows, PACER is
available to all upon simple registration.
Additionally, Plaintiff has not yet completed a thorough review of Mr. Levy’s five hundred
(500) page exhibit filed in support of his response to Plaintiff’s motion to compel, hence there may
be other improper disclosures in those exhibits by Mr. Levy that have not yet been located. As such,
Plaintiff seeks an order sealing those exhibits pending a review and certification of compliance with
LCvR 5.4(f) by Mr. Levy personally – as he signed the initial pleading – to insure there are no other
breaches of this Court’s Rules.
WHEREFORE, for the reasons aforesaid, Plaintiff requests that this Court immediately (i)
seal all exhibit filed by Mr. Levy in this matter pending review by Mr. Levy of other breaches of the
Local Rules and (ii) significantly sanction – including attorney fees for drafting this motion – Mr.
Levy for his reckless breach of this Court’s Rules on litigant’s privacy.
