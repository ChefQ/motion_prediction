PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO
RESPOND TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL AND TO CONTINUE
HEARING SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 30, 2014 AT 11:00 AM
Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”), moves for the entry of an order allowing
Plaintiff a brief two (2) week extension to respond to Defendant Michael Harrison’s
(“Defendant”) Motion to Compel and continuing the hearing scheduled for January 30, 2014 at
11:00 AM, and in support states:
1.

On January 9, 2014, Defendant moved to compel responses to his Request for

Production. Pursuant to this Court’s Scheduling Order, Plaintiff’s response is due today, January
23, 2014, and a hearing is scheduled for January 30, 2014 11:00 AM [CM/ECF 152].
2.

Defendant’s Motion to Compel raises intricate issues which Plaintiff is also

briefing in connection with several other cases. As such, Plaintiff’s response will be substantial
and requires additional time within which to research and write a substantive brief.
3.

Plaintiff respectfully requests an additional two (2) weeks within which to

complete its Response to Defendant’s Motion to Compel, up to and including February 6, 2014.

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 153 Filed 01/23/14 Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 1095

Further, Plaintiff requests the hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Compel, which is scheduled for
January 30, 2014 at 11:00 AM, be continued until after Plaintiff has filed its response.
4.

Plaintiff attempted to confer with Defendant regarding the relief requested herein,

but Defendant did not answer Plaintiff’s call nor respond to Plaintiff’s voicemail as of the time of
this filing.
5.

This request is made in good faith and not made for the purpose of undue delay.

6.

None of the parties would be prejudiced by the granting of the extension of time,

and said extension would not interfere with any case management deadlines because they were
all suspended by the Court on January 2, 2014 [CM/ECF 149].
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the time within which it has to respond
to Defendant’s Michael Harrison’s Motion to Compel be extended until February 6, 2014.
Plaintiff further requests that the telephonic hearing scheduled for January 30, 2014 be continued
to a later date, as the Court’s schedule may permit. A proposed order is attached for the Court’s
convenience.
