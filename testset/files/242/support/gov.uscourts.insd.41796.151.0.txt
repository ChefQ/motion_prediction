DEFENDANT MICHAEL HARRISON’S BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
COMPEL DISCOVERY
______________________________________________________________________________
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, S.D. Ind. L.R. 37-1, and S.D. Ind. L.R. 71(b)(2), Defendant Michael Harrison (“Harrison”), by and through undersigned counsel,
respectfully moves this Court to enter an order granting Harrison’s Motion to Compel Discovery
and the relief requested therein, and submits this Brief in Support of his Motion. This Court
should grant Harrison’s Motion and the relief requested therein for the reasons set forth and
explained more fully below.
I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND.
On December 3, 2013, a Local Rule 37-1 Conference was held before Magistrate Judge

Mark J. Dinsmore to discuss discovery disputes at Harrison’s request. Pursuant to the Court’s
December 5, 2013 Minute Order: (1) Plaintiff was ordered to provide any information it agreed
to produce in its response to Harrison’s Request for Production of Documents on or before
December 13, 2013; (2) Plaintiff was ordered to file either an agreed protective or disputed
motion for protective order regarding Harrison’s Request Nos. 1 and 2; and (3) Harrison was

	  

1	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 992

authorized to file a motion to compel with regard to all remaining disputed issues as those issues
became ripe [Dkt. 142].
On December 6, 2013, Plaintiff moved for a protective order, the scope of which
included items requested by Harrison’s Request No. 7, which Plaintiff was ordered to provide by
December 13, 2013 pursuant to the Court’s December 5, 2013 Order [Dkts. 143 & 144].
Plaintiff agreed to produce discovery in response to Harrison’s Request for Production
(“Request”) Nos. 7, 10, 13, 19, 21, and 23. Plaintiff provided discovery for Harrison’s Request
Nos. 10, 13, and 19, which was mainly in the form of electronically stored information. Plaintiff
has not provided discovery for Harrison’s Request Nos. 7, 21, and 23, and Plaintiff refuses to
provide discovery for Request Nos. 6 and 9.
II.

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that if a party fails to

obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the court may issue further just orders under Rule
37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vii). Rule 37(b)(2)(C) provides that “instead of or in addition to the orders
above, the court must order the disobedient party, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was
substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.” Fed. R. Civ. P.
37(b)(2)(C).
A party may move for an order to compel discovery after the movant has conferred in
good faith or attempted to confer with the party failing to make discovery in an effort to obtain it
without court action. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a); S.D. Ind. L.R. 37-1(a). The motion may be
made if a party fails to provide discovery or respond that inspection will be permitted – or fails to

	  

2	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 993

permit inspection – as requested under Rule 34. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(3)(B)(iv). An incomplete
response must be treated as a failure to respond. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4).
Barring substantial justification, a court must order the party whose conduct necessitated
the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant’s reasonable
expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney’s fees, caused by the party’s failure
to obey the order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).

ANALYSIS
A.

THIS COURT SHOULD ENTER AN ORDER COMPELLING PLAINTIFF TO PRODUCE
DISCOVERY FOR HARRISON’S REQUEST NOS. 7, 21, AND 23, AND REQUIRING
PLAINTIFF TO PAY HARRISON’S REASONABLE EXPENSES, INCLUDING
ATTORNEY FEE’S, CAUSED BY PLAINTIFF’S FAILURES; AND ISSUE FURTHER
JUST ORDERS PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vii) FOR
PLAINTIFF’S FAILURE TO OBEY THE DISCOVERY ORDER.

This Court should enter an order compelling Plaintiff to produce discovery for Harrison’s
Request Nos. 7, 21, and 23, and requiring Plaintiff to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to provide discovery and
failure to obey the Court’s December 5, 2013 Discovery Order; and, issue any further just orders
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vii) for Plaintiff’s failure to obey the Court’s
Discovery Order.
HARRISON’S REQUEST NO. 7.
Harrison’s Request No. 7 seeks:
Copies of any and all contracts, modifications of and amendments to contracts, bills of
sale, purchase orders, receipts, invoices, billing statements, and the like memorializing or
reflecting any agreement or other arrangement, and the like between you, any and all
parent, sister, subsidiary, affiliated, or otherwise related entities of you, X-Art, X-Art
affiliates and X-Art affiliated programs (collectively, “you”) and any and all individuals
or entities related to your inquiring, negotiating, hiring, rewarding, retaining, employing,
or otherwise arranging to compensate those individuals or entities regarding the online
security of your websites, the unauthorized reproduction of hard copies and/or digital
copies your copyrighted works, and/or to otherwise create, develop, implement, or

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 994

maintain any sort of technological securities, safeguards, protective measures,
mechanisms, and the like to cease, prevent, or curtail the online infringement of your
copyrighted works. Def.’s Req. Prod. Docs. No. 7 (October 10, 2013); See Exhibit A.
Plaintiff’s Response to Harrison’s Request No. 7 provides: “Plaintiff will produce any
documents in its possession, custody, or control deemed responsive to this request.” Pl.’s Resp.
Prod. No. 7 (Nov. 11, 2013); See Ex. A. This Court’s December 5, 2013 discovery order
required Plaintiff to produce all documents responsive to Harrison’s Request No. 7.
Nevertheless, Plaintiff moved for a protective order with respect to the discovery it agreed to
produce in its Response to Harrison’s Request No. 7.
Plaintiff waived any objection to producing discovery for Harrison’s Request No. 7.
While the Seventh Circuit has held that the district court must consider relevant objections
regardless of the timeliness of the objection, Cont'l Ins. Co. v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage
Corp., 59 F.Appx. 830, 839 (7th Cir. 2003), such objections are limited to the delinquent party’s
objection based on an inability or incapacity to produce the requested documents. See Slabaugh
v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., et al., No. 1:12-cv-01020-RLY-MJD at 1-2 (S.D. Ind. Sept.
5, 2013). “[U]nless the delinquent party is incapable of producing the requested responses or
documents, an unreasonable delay in a response to interrogatories or requests for production
constitutes a waiver of any objection.” Id. at 2.
Here, Plaintiff’s Motion for Protective Order regarding production of discovery for
Request No. 7 is clearly not indicative of an inability or incapacity to produce the requested
documents. Plaintiff waived any objection, failed to produce the documents it agreed to produce,
and disobeyed the Court’s December 5, 2013 Discovery Order.
This Court should enter an order compelling Plaintiff to provide the discovery for
Harrison’s Request No. 7, denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Protective Order as to Harrison’s

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 995

Request No. 7, and order Plaintiff to pay Harrison’s reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).
HARRISON’S REQUEST NO. 21.
Harrison’s Request No. 21 seeks:
Copies of any and all documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things
evidencing statistics and the like for the number of times paying subscribers or other
authorized paid users of online website services provided by you, any and all parent,
sister, subsidiary, affiliated, or otherwise related entities of you, X-Art, X-Art affiliates
and X-Art affiliated programs (collectively, “you”) have viewed the copyrighted work,
“Pretty Back Door Baby,” through your online website services. Def.’s Req. Prod. No. 7.
See Ex. A.
Plaintiff’s Response to Harrison’s Request No. 21 states: “Plaintiff will produce a
document, if it exists, which contains the number of views of ‘Pretty Back Door Baby’ from
subscribers on its website.” Pl.’s Resp. Prod. No. 21; See Ex. A.
On December 12, 2013, Counsel for Plaintiff informed Counsel for Harrison by email
that, in response to Harrison’s Request No. 21, no documents exist evidencing the number of
times subscribers viewed the movie “Pretty Back Door Baby” on the X-Art website. See Exhibit
B.
Harrison’s request is not limited to the production of documents. Harrison’s request
expressly includes production of any and all electronically stored information, as well. Plaintiff
alleges that it is the operating entity for the X-Art website business owned by a trademark
holding company named Click Here, LLC, which is owned entirely by Brigham and Colette
Field. Pl.’s Resp. Interrog. No. 2 (Dec. 3, 2013); See Exhibit C. Plaintiff alleges that it employs
security professionals to maintain and protect the security of the X-Art website business. Pl.’s
Resp. Interrog. No. 7; See Ex. C. Based on these facts, it is reasonable to assume that Plaintiff’s
operation of the X-Art website business is as sophisticated as Plaintiff’s erotica, and that

	  

5	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 996

electronically stored information exists evidencing the number of views of “Pretty Back Door
Baby” by virtue of Plaintiff’s ordinary business operations as the operating entity for the X-Art
website; and, that Plaintiff is capable of producing said electronically stored information.
Plaintiff is well aware that the Federal Discovery Rules require more than just the simple
production of documents. Indeed, that fact was directly communicated to Counsel for Plaintiff
by Magistrate Judge Mark J. Dinsmore when Plaintiff’s Response to Request No. 21 was
discussed during the Local Rule 37-1 Conference on December 3, 2013. Plaintiff has never
stated that electronically stored information for Request No. 21 does not exist or that Plaintiff
does not possess electronically stored information responsive to Request No. 21. Plaintiff has
only stated that no documents responsive to Request No. 21 exist.
This Court should enter an order compelling Plaintiff to produce electronically stored
information evidencing the number of times “Pretty Back Door Baby” has been viewed by
subscribers of the X-Art website, and order Plaintiff to pay Harrison’s reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure pursuant to Fed.
R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).
HARRISON’S REQUEST NO. 23.
Harrison’s Request No. 23 seeks:
Copies of any and all documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things
evidencing or containing information relating in any way to the media access control
(“MAC”) addresses for each and every IP Address designated on Exhibit A of Plaintiff’s
Third Amended Complaint. Def.’s Req. Prod. No. 23; See Ex. A.
Plaintiff’s Response to Request No. 23 states: “Notwithstanding the foregoing objections
and without waiving same, Plaintiff will produce all documents in its possession, custody or
control deemed relevant to this request as it pertains to Defendant Michael Harrison, if any such

	  

6	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 997

documents exist.” Pl.’s Resp. Prod. No. 23; See Ex. A. Plaintiff did not provide the documents it
agreed to produce in Response to Request No. 23 by December 13, 2013.
On January 7, 2014, Counsel for Harrison emailed Counsel for Plaintiff informing
Plaintiff that Harrison had still not received the discovery Plaintiff agreed to produce in its
Response to Request No. 23. On January 7, 2014, Counsel for Plaintiff replied that no such
documents exist containing the MAC address as to Harrison. See Exhibit D. However, as
discussed above, the Federal Discovery Rules and the express language of Harrison’s requests
seek information contained in more than just documents.
This Court should enter an order compelling Plaintiff to produce all electronically stored
information for Request No. 23, and ordering Plaintiff to pay Harrison’s reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by Harrison as a result of Plaintiff’s failure, pursuant to Fed.
R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).
B.

THIS COURT SHOULD ENTER AN ORDER PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF
CIVIL PROCEDURE 37(a) COMPELLING PLAINTIFF TO PRODUCE DISCOVERY
FOR HARRISON’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NOS. 6 AND 9, AND ORDERING
PLAINTIFF TO PAY HARRISON’S REASONABLE EXPENSES, INCLUDING
ATTORNEY’S FEES, INCURRED IN MAKING THIS MOTION.

This Court should enter an order compelling Plaintiff to produce discovery for Harrison’s
Request Nos. 6 and 9, and requiring Plaintiff to pay Harrison the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred in making this Motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A).
HARRISON’S REQUEST NO. 6.
Harrison’s Request No. 6 seeks:
Copies of any and all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things,
including but not limited to technical and data reports, for each IP Address listed on
Exhibit A of Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint relating to the identification of those
IP Addresses as infringing IP Addresses of your copyrighted work, “Pretty Back Door
Baby,” and the alleged BitTorrent “swarm” that those IP Addresses participated in and

	  

7	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 998

which formed the basis of your contributory copyright infringement claims against any
and all individuals in this case. Def.’s Req. Prod. No. 6; See Ex. A.
Plaintiff’s Response to Request No. 6 provides:
Plaintiff has elected not to pursue its claim for contributory copyright infringement. In
light of the foregoing, Plaintiff objects on the basis that the request seeks documents that
are neither relevant nor likely to lead to admissible evidence. Plaintiff objects on the
basis that this request is overbroad insofar as it seeks information which would evidence
third party infringements as opposed to just Defendant’s infringements. Plaintiff avers
that the information requested herein is not in its possession, custody, or control, but
rather in IPP International UG’s possession, custody or control. Further, IPP International
UG charges a fee to third parties for extracting data from its servers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing objections and without waving the same, Plaintiff will produce the PCAP files
which demonstrate that a computer using Defendant’s IP Address connected to IPP
International UG’s servers and delivered a piece of a computer file that contains a copy
of each of the copyrighted works at issue in this case as evidenced by a unique
cryptographic hash value. Pl.’s Resp. Prod. No. 6; See Ex. A.
1.

Relevancy.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) allows for broad discovery and parties may obtain
discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claims or defenses.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). Relevant information need not be admissible at trial if the discovery
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(c).
Harrison’s request seeks discovery relevant to Plaintiff’s claims and Harrison’s defenses,
and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence even if
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend the Third Amended Complaint is granted. Plaintiff’s
Fourth Amended Complaint would maintain a claim of direct copyright infringement against
Harrison for the copyrighted work, “Pretty Back Door Baby” [See Dkt. 130-2].

Plaintiff’s

objection that the request is overbroad contradicts its relevancy objection by indicating that the
requested information actually shows infringing activities specifically committed by Harrison of
a copyrighted work that would remain at issue. The requested discovery contains the dates,

	  

8	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 999

times, and lengths of the alleged infringing BitTorrent transactions between Harrison and the
settling defendants. It has the potential to help Harrison identify additional defense witnesses
and discredit Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s witnesses through impeachment uses at trial. Plaintiff’s
relevancy objection is completely without merit.
2.

Overbroad.

Plaintiff’s objection that the request is overbroad insofar as it seeks information which
would evidence third party infringements as opposed to just Harrison’s infringements is an
equally invalid objection. Each of Plaintiff’s complaints allege that IPP Limited monitored,
detected, and logged the communications, interactions, digital handshakes, passing along of
computer instructions, uploading and downloading, and other forms of transmission that
occurred between Harrison and the settling defendants in a BitTorrent Swarm [See Dkt. 1 at 6, ¶
33; Dkt. 38; Dkt. 54; Dkt. 59 at 6, ¶ 38]. Plaintiff’s objection indicates that the requested
information shows Harrison’s specific infringing activities of a copyrighted work that will
remain at issue, and the request is specifically limited to information evidencing the uploading
and downloading that occurred between Harrison and the settling defendants of only that work in
this action only.
3.

Possession, Custody or Control.

Plaintiff’s argument that the requested information is not in its possession, custody, or
control, but rather in the possession, custody or control of IPP International UG is not a valid
argument.
“It is the burden of the requesting party to prove that the producing party has the ability
to obtain the documents in question.” Slabaugh v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., No. 1:12-cv01020-RLY-MJD at 3-4 (S.D. Ind. Sept. 5, 2013) (citing Stella v. LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics

	  

9	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 1000

USA, Inc., No. 07 C 6509, 2009 WL 780890 (Mar. 23, 2009). When a producing party has
already produced information it acquired from an entity with whom it has a legally recognized
relationship, the producing party’s ability to obtain similar documents is not at issue and “it is
not necessary to defer to factors to postulate the closeness of the relationship[.]” See E.g.,
Slabaugh at 4. A party that demonstrates its ability to obtain the requested information and
documents is in “control” of the materials requested. Id.
Plaintiff has produced and displayed sufficient control over other documents and
electronically stored information evidencing Harrison’s alleged infringing activity; namely: IPP
International UG PCAP files allegedly showing Harrison connected to IPP International UG’s
servers and delivered computer file pieces of five of Plaintiff’s copyrighted works; and, IPP
International UG generated Technical Reports allegedly documenting the same [See Dkt. 134-1 –
134-6].
Additionally, Harrison’s Request No. 19 sought: “[a] copy of the fully playable digital
motion picture of “Pretty Back Door Baby” that correlates with/to the Unique Hash Number and
was reassembled by your investigator.” Def.’s Req. Prod. No. 19; See Ex. A. Plaintiff’s
Response to Request No. 19 provided: “Plaintiff will produce all documents in its possession,
custody or control deemed responsive to this request.” Pl. Resp. Prod. No. 19; See Ex. A.
Plaintiff complied with the Court’s December 5, 2013 Discovery Order and produced the
information. This Court should note that Plaintiff stated in its Rule 26(a) Disclosures that IPP
Limited possessed “[c]opies [of the copyrighted work] reassembled by infringers” and that said
copies “may be obtained from IPP Limited.” See Exhibit E at 2, ¶ 5.1
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  It is also worth noting that Plaintiff’s Rule 26(a) Disclosures expressly state: “Other peer
infringers that participated in the subject swarm – Possess information that they received as
pieces of the subject movies from other peers in the swarm.” See Ex. E at 2, ¶ 6.
	  

10	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 1001

The exact nature of Plaintiff’s legal relationship with IPP International UG is unknown at
this time because Plaintiff’s Answers to Harrison’s First Set of Interrogatories temporarily
stonewalled Harrison’s attempts to ascertain such information. However, Harrison does know
the following: (i) Plaintiff’s attorney, M. Keith Limpscomb, “negotiated the terms of Plaintiff’s
agreement with IPP International UG” and that “Plaintiff and IPP International UG have an oral
agreement that was formed approximately 2.5 years ago,” Pl.’s Resp. Interrog. No. 4, 5; See Ex.
C; (ii) IPP International UG more than likely has a financial interest in the outcome of this
litigation “entitled to a small portion of the proceeds from the resolution of this case in
consideration for the services it provided,” and may be “a fact witness who will testify that its
technology detected that a person using Defendant’s IP address was downloading and
distributing Plaintiff’s copyrighted works.” See Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe, No. 1:13-cv06312, Dkt. 24-5 at 1-2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 2014); See Exhibit F at 1-2.
4.

Rule 11(b) Question.

If IPP International UG is to receive proceeds in consideration for the services it has
already provided; and if the requested information is not in the possession, custody or control of
Plaintiff or its attorneys; and in order to obtain it Plaintiff must pay a fee to IPP International UG
to extract this information from its servers (i.e., provide additional services), on what basis did
Plaintiff form the factual contentions of its complaint to institute and conduct the instant
litigation? See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b).
This Court should compel Plaintiff to produce all documents, electronically stored
information, and tangible things responsive to Harrison’s Request No. 6, and order Plaintiff to
pay Harrison the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in making this motion
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A).

HARRISON’S REQUEST NO. 9.
This Court should enter an order compelling Plaintiff to produce any and all DMCA
notices by Plaintiff from January 1, 2012 to August 1, 2012 because Plaintiff’s DMCA notices
are not inaccessible because of undue burden or cost.
Harrison’s Revised Request No. 9 requests:
Copies of any and all DMCA takedown notices issued by you and/or any and all
individuals or entities acting on your behalf from January 1, 2012 to August 1, 2012.
Def.’s Rev. Req. Prod. No. 9; See Exhibit G at 5.
Plaintiff’s Revised Response to Request No. 9 provides:
Defendant revised his request to limit the time period in which Plaintiff sent DMCA
takedown notices to April 1, 2012 through August 1, 2012. Plaintiff stands by its original
objections and response to Request No. 9. However, Plaintiff will produce a weekly
summary evidencing the volume of DMCA notices that it sent for the time period
Defendant specified, April 1, 2012 through August 1, 2012. Pl.’s Rev. Resp. Prod. No. 9;
See Exhibit H at 5.
Plaintiff’s Response to Request No. 9 provides:
Plaintiff objects on the basis that this request is unduly burdensome. Indeed Plaintiff
sends hundreds, if not thousands, of DMCA notices a month. Plaintiff will produce a
weekly summary evidencing the volume of DMCA notices that it sends. Pl.’s Resp. Prod.
No. 9; See Ex. A.
In order to alleviate any confusion regarding the time period of Harrison’s Request No. 9,
Harrison provides the following information. On November 19, 2013, Counsel for Harrison
emailed Counsel for Plaintiff seeking confirmation in writing of the agreements reached
regarding the parties’ disputed discovery issues. Counsel for Harrison did not receive a response
from Counsel for Plaintiff. On November 21, 2013, Counsel for Harrison emailed Counsel for
Plaintiff advising that Harrison sought all DMCA notices sent by Plaintiff from January 1, 2012
to August 1, 2012 instead of April 1, 2012 to August 1, 2012. On November 26, 2013, Counsel
for Harrison emailed Counsel for Harrison seeking written confirmation of the agreement

	  

12	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 1003

reached on November 19, 2013 and receipt of Counsel for Harrison’s November 21, 2013 email.
On November 26, 2013, Counsel for Plaintiff emailed Counsel for Harrison stating, “Gabe, your
11-21-13 email has been presented to my client for discussion and approval[.]” See Exhibit I.
Harrison rightly seeks DMCA notices sent by Plaintiff for the period January 1, 2012 to August
1, 2012.
1.

Public Accessibility of Plaintiff’s DMCA Notices.

Google makes DMCA notices it receives available for viewing by linking to Chilling
Effects (chillingeffects.org) at the bottom of its search page results. Neither Bing nor Yahoo
allow the viewing of DMCA notices by linking to the actual DMCA notices, but Yahoo may
submit DMCA notices it receives to Chilling Effects for public viewing. Twitter submits a large
number of DMCA notices to Chilling Effects, as well.
Harrison has used Google and the Chilling Effects website to obtain a number of DMCA
notices sent by Plaintiff, but as is apparent from the Chilling Effects archive, Plaintiff either did
not send any DMCA notices prior to April 4, 2012, or Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and others did
not submit DMCA notices sent by Plaintiff prior to April 4, 2012 to Chilling Effects. See Exhibit
J.
2.

Plaintiff’s DMCA Notices Contain Extremely Valuable Information.

Plaintiff’s DMCA notices contain important detailed information such as specifically
named and targeted allegedly infringing URLs identified by Plaintiff. This sort of detailed
information – indicative of Plaintiff’s motives and efforts to remove infringing content, among
other things – cannot be culled from “a weekly summary evidencing the volume of DMCA
notices sent by Plaintiff.” That in itself is reason enough to compel Plaintiff’s production of the
requested DMCA notices, but examining a series of DMCA notices sent by Plaintiff’s Online

	  

13	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 151 Filed 01/09/14 Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 1004

Marketing Manager to Twitter from June 19, 2012 to July 23, 2012 should convince this Court
that, in any event, good cause exists to order Plaintiff’s production of all DMCA notices for the
requested period not available for public viewing by Harrison on chillingeffects.org.
3.

Plaintiff’s DMCA Notices to Twitter as Examples.

From June 19, 2012 to July 23, 2012, Plaintiff’s Online Marketing Manager sent a series
of DMCA notices to Twitter. See Ex. J. Plaintiff’s Online Marketing Manager sent these DMCA
notices because Twitter users were “distributing updates from X-Art without permission by
removing them from the members area” and tweeting “links to another website where the
infringing material is made available for display or download.” See e.g. Exhibit K. These
removals from the X-Art “members area” included “full length videos and images from XArt.com.” See Ex. K. Plaintiff’s June 25, 2012 and July 3, 2012 DMCA notices to Twitter show
that these removals and tweeted links occurred with respect to at least two of the additional
copyrighted works Plaintiff seeks to place at issue in this case. See Exhibit L at 1; See Exhibit K
at 5. And in its July 10, 2012 notice to Twitter, Plaintiff’s Online Marketing Manager provides
that a tweet was linking to a complete site rip of the X-Art website. See Exhibit M at 2. This
information calls into question the mechanisms and amount of care Plaintiff used in securing XArt.com and protecting its copyrighted works, and the credibility of Plaintiff’s website security

Production of DMCA Notices for the Requested Period Is Not Unduly
Burdensome.

The objecting party bears the burden of proving that a discovery request is improper. See
Slabaugh at 2 (citing e.g., Janssen v. Howse, 09-CV-3340, 2011 WL 2533809 (C.D. Ill. June 27,
2011); Cunningham v. Smithkline Beecham, 255F.R.D. 474, 478 (N.D. Ind. 2009); BASF
Catalysts LLCv. Aristo, Inc., 2:07-CV-222, 2009 WL 187808 (N.D. Ind. Jan. 23, 2009)).

The above discussion shows that Plaintiff’s undue burden objection is not valid because
Plaintiff would only have to produce DMCA notices not already accessible to Harrison. Since
Google is the most popular and widely used search engine, it is likely that the vast majority of
DMCA notices Plaintiff sent for the requested period were to Google. Other search engines and
social media sites provide links to DMCA complaint forms for online processing, making the
submission and retention of DMCA complaint forms more convenient for copyright owners. The
above discussion also shows that weekly summaries of the volume of DMCA notices Plaintiff
sends would hinder Harrison’s ability to obtain extremely valuable information relevant to
Harrison’s defenses and the subject matter of the action. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). The
month-long Security “Tweach” of X-Art.com revealed by the DMCA Notices sent by Plaintiff to
Twitter is just one example of the importance to Harrison of the specific content contained the
DMCA notices sent by Plaintiff.
This Court should compel Plaintiff to produce all DMCA notices for the requested period
that are not available for public viewing by Harrison on chillingeffects.org, and order Plaintiff to
pay Harrison the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in making this motion
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A).

CONCLUSION
"[T]he scope of discovery should be broad in order to aid in the search for truth."

Slabaugh at 1 (citing Kodish v. Oakbrook Terrace Fire Prot. Dist., 235 F.R.D. 447, 450 (N.D.
Ill. 2006) in turn citing to Tice v. American Airlines, Inc., 192 F.R.D. 270, 272 (N.D.Ill.2000),
and citing United States v. White, 950 F.2d 426, 430 (7th Cir.1991) in support of the
proposition). This Court should exercise its broad discretionary power over discovery matters,
