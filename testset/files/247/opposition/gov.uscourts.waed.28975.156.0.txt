CR-96-100-RHW
United States’ Response To
Defendant’s Motion For Early
Release From Supervised
Release

Plaintiff, United States of America, by and through James A. McDevitt,
United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, and Ronald W.
Skibbie, Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington,
submits the following Response To Defendant’s Motion For Early Release From
Supervised Release.
The United States would oppose Defendant’s request for early release from
Supervised Release. The facts underlying the Defendant’s original conviction, as
well as her violation of Supervised Release, raises concerns that the Defendant will
commit further fraudulent acts. For reasons of community safety, the United States
recommends that the Defendant serve out her entire term of Supervised Release.
DATED January 4, 2005.
