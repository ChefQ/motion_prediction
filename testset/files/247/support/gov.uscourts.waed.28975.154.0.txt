) SUPERVISED RELEASE

UNITED STATES of AMERICA _)

COMES NOW, Carrie Lee Aenk, Movant, pro se, before this Honorable Court and moves this
Court to grant this MOTION FOR EARLY RELEASE FROM SUPERVISED RELEASE for the
following reasons:

CASE HISTORY

Movant was found guilty of Bank Fraud on October 10, 1996 for a crime committed sometime
in August, 1993., Movant spent her 33 month period of incarceration at FCI Dublin, California
and at Turner House Community Corrections Center in Spokane, Washington., Movant began her
five year term of Supervised Release on September 4, 1998.,

Movants Supervised Release was revoked approx. two years later due to allegations with no
evidence to substantiate the allegations., Movant absconded from Supervised Release and was
found guilty of absconding and attempting to obtain new identity using another's name and social
security., (See Judgement in a Criminal Case for Revocation of Supervised Release).,

Movant spent her 21 month period of incarceration at Geiger Correctional Facility and Turner
House Community Corrections, both in Spokane, Washington., Movant began her 39 month term

of Supervised Release on February 8, 2003.,
Case 2:96-cr-00100-RHW Document 154 _ Filed 01/03/05

REASONS FOR MOTION

1) Movant has in her possession a cassette taped conversation of Movant and a man named
Eric Wright., Recorded on said cassette tape, Mr. Wright has made a confession as to setting
Movant up for the 1993 original crime of Bank Fraud., (See Exhibit "A").,

2) Movant has in her possession a cassette taped conversation of Movant and her grand-
mother, Verna Weber, clearly signifying that Mr. Wright was bragging about setting Movant up
and working with the FBI., (See Exhibit "B").,

3) Movant has four exams left in order to finish her training and receive her Diploma as a
Veterinary Assistant and Movant wishes to seek employment working with animals.,

4) With her education, Movant is considering relocating to another State, yet would like to
begin a new life and occupation without Supervised Release.,

5) Movant has considered petitioning the Court to re-open Movants cased based on newly
discovered evidence yet even though Missouri is a one person consent tape recorded State,
Movant is unsure if the taped conversation is admissible in Court under this Courts jurisdiction.,

6) In the Monica Lewinski case of the taped telephone conversation over State lines,
during the President Clinton scandal:

a) Monica Lewinski lived in a one party consent State

b) The opposition lived in a two party consent State

c) The Court ruled that the tapes were admissible

Yet if Monica Lewinski would have lived in a two party consent State and the opposing party
had lived in a one party consent State, the tapes would not have been admissible.,

7) Eric Wright lives in the State of Missouri which is a one party consent State.,

8) Eric Wright has made his confession of setting the Movant up for the original 1993

a
Case 2:96-cr-00100-RHW Document 154 _ Filed 01/03/05

crime known throughout the Wright family (Movants relatives) and has verbally apologized, yet
Mr. Wright's apology negates the fact that Movant spent prison time and Supervised Release
time, which qualifies as "in custody" for a crime that Movant did not commit., US v SPAN, 75
F3d 1383 (1996-9th Cir), "Defendants who had received sentences of probation met "in custody"
requirement for jurisdiction of court..."

THEREFORE based on the foregoing reasons, Movant respectfully urges this Honorable Court
to grant this MOTION FOR EARLY RELEASE FROM SUPERVISED RELEASE.,

SO SIGNED this 3" day of January, 2005, under the mandates of HAINES vs KERNER, 92
S.Ct. 595, "Allegations of pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than attorneys.",
and served upon parties of interest: AUSA Ronald Skibby, 920 Riverside, Spokane, Washington,
99210 and U.S. Probation Officer Richard Law, P.O. Box 306, Spokane, Washington, 99210-
0306, and placed within the mail reciprocal at the U.S. Post Office in downtown Spokane,
Washington.,

Respectfully Submitted,

Ones: Henk
