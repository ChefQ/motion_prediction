UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

ROGER ROUSSEAU
Defendant.
/

THE GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT ROUSSEAU’S MOTION FOR BILL OF PARTICULARS
The United States, by and through the undersigned Trial Attorney, hereby opposes
Defendant Rousseau’s Motion For Bill of Particulars. [See DE #154]. Because the indictment
and discovery in this case puts Defendant Rousseau on notice of the charges against him, allows
him to prepare for trial, and enables him to plead double jeopardy in the event of a later
prosecution for the same offense, his Motion should be denied.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On July 11, 2013, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of Florida returned a 13count indictment, charging seven defendants – including Defendant Rousseau – with conspiracy
to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, and making false statements related to health care
matters. Defendant Rousseau was charged in Counts 1-3 of the indictment with conspiracy to
commit health care fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1349: Count 1) and health care fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1347:

1

Case 1:13-cr-20505-RNS Document 160 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2013 Page 2 of 7

Counts 2-3). The statutory maximum sentence Defendant Rousseau faces for these crimes is 30
years’ imprisonment.
From approximately July 2004 through approximately February 2011, Defendant
Rousseau served as the Medical Director and attending psychiatrist for Health Care Solutions
Network (“HCSN”), a defunct community mental health center that purported to provide
intensive mental health treatment, known as partial hospitalization program (“PHP”) treatment,
to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in Miami, Florida and Hendersonville, North Carolina.
The fraud scheme centered on the admission of ineligible Medicare and Medicaid
beneficiaries and the routine fabrication of their HCSN PHP medical records. In Miami, HCSN
paid illegal health care kickbacks to owners of assisted living facilities (“ALF”) to induce them
to refer patients to HCSN’s PHP. The residents of the ALFs consisted of elderly patients, many
of whom suffered from a type of dementia, typically Alzheimer’s disease, as well as mental
retardation, which prevented them from benefitting from PHP services. HCSN also paid illegal
health care kickbacks to induce Miami-Dade County hospitals to refer patients to HCSN.
Medicare data revealed that Defendant Rousseau was the rendering physician for more than 95%
of the patients who were admitted into HCSN’s PHP. Specifically, Defendant Rousseau was the
attending physician for 1,057 of the 1,106 patients admitted into HCSN-EAST’s PHP from
November 16, 2004 through February 11, 2011.
Medicare requires that, to qualify for the PHP benefit, the services must be reasonable
and necessary for the diagnosis or active treatment of the individual’s condition. The program
must be reasonably expected to improve or maintain the condition and functional level of the
patient and to prevent relapse or hospitalization. Thus, PHP services are not appropriate for

2

Case 1:13-cr-20505-RNS Document 160 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2013 Page 3 of 7

patients with progressive dementia and other cognitive deficits. The program must have been
prescribed by a physician, furnished under the general supervision of a physician, and delivered
under an established plan of treatment that met Medicare requirements.

The false claims

submitted to Medicare and Medicaid by HCSN were supported by the routine fabrication of PHP
medical records related to (1) PHP patient admissions, (2) treatment, and (3) extension of PHP
treatment, in order to maximize HCSN’s billing.
Since May 2012, thirteen co-conspirators, including HCSN personnel and assisted living
facility owners, have pleaded guilty for their respective roles in the HCSN scheme and each of
these co-conspirators are cooperating with the government. In total, HCSN fraudulently billed
Medicare and Medicaid approximately $63,745,275, from which HCSN received payments
totaling approximately $28,092,283.
ARGUMENT
I.

LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f) provides as follows:
The court may direct the government to file a bill of particulars.
The defendant may move for a bill of particulars before or within
10 days after arraignment or at a later time if the court permits.
The government may amend a bill of particulars subject to such
conditions as justice requires.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f).

A bill of particulars “supplements an indictment by providing the

defendant with information necessary for trial preparation.” United States v. Anderson, 799 F.2d
1438, 1441 (11th Cir. 1986). “Generalized discovery, however, is not an appropriate function of
a bill of particulars and is not a proper purpose in seeking the bill.” Id. “To allow the bill of
particulars to serve as a wholesale discovery device would actually frustrate the federal

3

Case 1:13-cr-20505-RNS Document 160 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2013 Page 4 of 7

discovery rule.” Id. at 1442. Whether to grant a bill of particulars is within the discretion of the
Court. See United States v. Cole, 755 F.2d 748,760-61 (11th Cir. 1985); United States v. Colson,
662 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir. 1981).
As the Eleventh Circuit explained, the purpose of a bill of particulars is to “inform the
defendant of the charge against him with sufficient precision to allow him to prepare his defense,
to minimize surprise at trial, and to enable him to plead double jeopardy in the event of a later
prosecution for the same offense.” Cole, 755 F.2d at 760. Indeed, “a bill of particulars is not
required where the information sought has already been provided by other sources, such as the
indictment and discovery, and it is not designed to compel the government to detailed exposition
of its evidence or to explain the legal theories upon which it intends to rely at trial.” United
States v. Roberts, 174 Fed. Appx. 475, 477, 2006 WL 827293, *2 (11th Cir. 2006). Nor is a
defendant entitled to a bill of particulars with respect to the defendant’s own conversations and
actions. See Cole, 755 F.2d at 760-61 (noting that defendants “could hardly have been surprised
by the government’s proof at trial” by testimony regarding conversations the defendant
participated in and activities that he witnessed).
II.

DEFENDANT ROUSSEAU’S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED
The government respectfully submits that the indictment and the discovery discussed

above has “inform[ed] [Defendant Rousseau] of the charge[s] against him with sufficient
precision to allow him to prepare his defense, to minimize surprise at trial, and to enable him to
plead double jeopardy in the event of a later prosecution for the same offense.” Cole, 755 F.2d at
760. The indictment itself tracks the language of the statute, an important factor in the Court’s
consideration. Id. Further, the government’s discovery efforts have been significant. For

4

Case 1:13-cr-20505-RNS Document 160 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2013 Page 5 of 7

instance, on July 31, 2013, the government produced 15 CDs, corresponding to the government’s
first response to the standing discovery order. A cover letter accompanied this production,
identifying the materials contained on each CD and inviting all parties to review evidence housed
at the Health Care Fraud Facility in Miramar, Florida. The government also agreed to produce a
preliminary exhibit list in October and to meet with counsel to highlight materials it believes are
important in this case.
On September 9, 2013, counsel for the government and counsel for Defendant Rousseau
met for the first time to discuss the case and address any issues surrounding discovery. The
government provided counsel with the names of cooperators who routinely fabricated HCSN
patient medical records with Defendant Rousseau and proffered information regarding the
government’s proof as to the counts charged against Defendant Rousseau in the indictment.
Additionally, the government, as promised, identified materials it believed were relevant to its
prosecution of Defendant Rousseau, significantly limiting the universe of documents for counsel
to review to prepare for trial.
The government also produced indices to Defendant Rousseau and his co-defendants
related to HCSN PHP patient and administrative records, and agreed to provide law enforcement
interview reports (i.e., FBI 302s and HHS-OIG OI3s) sixty days before trial. To the extent
Defendant Rousseau seeks a Bill of Particulars requiring the government to identify “the
particular patient records” which defendant Rousseau falsified over the course of the seven year
criminal fraud conspiracy, any such request should be denied. The defendant is not entitled to
use a bill of particulars “to determine in advance the government’s proof.” Elso, 2010 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 144563 at *84 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2010). Nevertheless, Defendant Rousseau and the

5

Case 1:13-cr-20505-RNS Document 160 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/25/2013 Page 6 of 7

other co-defendants will know sufficiently in advance of trial the documents and information the
government intends to rely upon to prove its case.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons listed above, the government respectfully requests that Defendant
Rousseau’s Motion for Bill of Particulars be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
