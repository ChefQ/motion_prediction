UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.
ROGER ROUSSEAU,
Defendant.
______________________________/

DEFENDANT ROUSSEAU’S MOTION FOR BILL OF
PARTICULARS AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendant, ROGER ROUSSEAU, M.D., through undersigned counsel and
pursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, respectfully
moves this Court for the entry of an order directing the government to provide
him with a bill of particulars.
I.
INTRODUCTION
DR. ROUSSEAU is charged for alleged participation in a $63 million
Medicare fraud scheme that spanned seven years. DR. ROUSSEAU is charged
with conspiracy to commit health care fraud by way of widespread allegations
that DR. ROUSSEAU and his six (6) co-defendants falsified and fabricated medical
records to support claims for services that were not medically necessary and
were not provided.1 Although DR. ROUSSEAU treated thousands of patients over
the course of his employment at Health Care Solutions Network of Florida,
(hereinafter “HCSN-FL”) the Indictment fails to identify any patient files or

medical records he purportedly falsified or fabricated. The Indictment does not
specify which patient files contain his “blind” signature. The Indictment therefore
fails to provide DR. ROUSSEAU with any information of which patient files the
government may use against him at trial.

We respectfully request a bill of

particularity for the following allegations contained in the Indictment:
5.
Roger Rousseau, Doris Crabtree, Angela Salafia,
Liliana Marks, Ruben Busquets, Alina Fonts, Blanca Ruiz and their
co-conspirators falsified, fabricated, altered, and caused the
alteration, falsification and fabrication of HCSN medical records to
support claims for PHP services that were not medically necessary
and were not provided at HCSN-FL.2
The Indictment fails to state with particularity the specific acts DR.
ROUSSEAU is accused of committing. Each of the alleged co-conspirators named
in the Indictment played a very different role within their employment at HCSNFL. These individuals are doctors, nurses, social workers, and administrators.
Each saw patients and created patients notes with respect to their individual
duties at HCSN-FL.

Therefore, it is highly improbable that each and every

individual co-defendant falsified, fabricated, altered or caused to be altered
patient files in the same broad manner. Accordingly, knowing which specific
allegations apply to DR. ROUSSEAU is critical to the preparation of his case.
Despite these very serious allegations, the government has failed to
identify the particular patient records DR. ROUSSEAU allegedly falsified or
fabricated. Without such specificity, it is impossible for DR. ROUSSEAU to know
which patient records require his investigation.

received treatment that was allegedly unnecessary should be identified to DR.
ROUSSEAU, so he may make his own assessment.
The discovery in this case is incredibly extensive and voluminous. There
are over 150 boxes of evidence seized pursuant to search warrants being held at
the FBI Miramar Healthcare Facility (hereinafter Miramar facility), filling an entire
storage unit. In addition, there are approximately 180 boxes of patient records,
administrative documents and billing records related to HCSN operations. The
government has extensive electronic evidence, and is in possession of thirteen
imaged hard drives containing approximately 2.5 Terra Bytes (TB) imaged from
twelve devices, including those of cooperators in the investigation. Many files
located on the hard drives cannot be opened by defense counsel or the
government. The government has expressed that they will not make any effort
to recover these files. Many of these files were contained on the devices of codefendants who have cooperated in the case in exchange for a shorter
sentence. It is possible that these files were destroyed in order to avoid selfincrimination.
It is impossible for DR. ROUSSEAU to guess which patient records may
have been falsified, fabricated or altered so as to be used by the government at
trial against him.

He cannot be expected to find these particulars in the

hundreds of boxes containing thousands of patient records. This subjects DR.
ROUSSEAU to unfair surprise at trial. He seeks to have the government identify
the subject patient files to enable him to prepare an adequate defense.

6.
Roger Rousseau signed what he knew to be false,
fabricated and altered medical records without ever reviewing the
material, and, in most instances, without ever meeting the patient. 3
The government alleges that DR. ROUSSEAU signed falsified, fabricated, or
altered records without ever reviewing the material or examining the patient.
This accusation does not identify the means with which they concluded that DR.
ROUSSEAU knowingly signed falsified, fabricated or altered records, nor how it
was determined that these records were in fact falsified, fabricated or altered. In
several instances, DR. ROUSSEAU’S signature was forged without his knowledge
or consent. It should be stated with particularity precisely which patients DR.
ROUSSEAU allegedly did not examine, and which documents he blindly signed.
Unless such patients and records are identified, he will not be able to recall any
details about those patients that may exonerate him in this case. He should
have the opportunity to view the patient files in question and determine whether
he did in fact examine the patient, or whether his signature was forged on a
falsified or fabricated record. If the government is relying on the testimony of
alleged co-conspirators that allege that DR. ROUSSEAU blindly signed documents,
the government should identify the co-conspirator making the statements in
addition to the patients’ files mentioned in such testimony.

9.
Roger Rousseau, Doris Crabtree, Angela Salafia,
Liliana Marks, Ruben Busquets, Alina Fonts, Blanca Ruiz and their
co-conspirators submitted and caused to be submitted claims to
Medicare and Medicaid in an approximate amount of $63 million for
PHP services that were not medically necessary and were not
provided at HCSN-FL or HCSN-NC.4
The Indictment fails to state with any specificity whether DR. ROUSSEAU
administered services that were not medically necessary, and the manner in
which it was concluded that these services were not medically necessary.
Furthermore, DR. ROUSSEAU’S role in the submitting of fraudulent claims is not
evident from the broad language contained in the Indictment.

There are

thousands of patients for whom HSCN-FL billed Medicare and referenced DR.
ROUSSEAU as the attending physician, resulting in millions of dollars worth of
claims.
DR. ROUSSEAU was not in charge of billing Medicare for patient claims.
Additionally, he was not the only attending physician. If specific patient claims
are not identified, we cannot know whether the patients in question received the
appropriate and necessary treatment and whether Medicare was correctly billed
for the services rendered. Knowing which specific patient claims were deemed
“medically unnecessary” by the government is essential in the preparation of DR.
ROUSSEAU’S defense.

10.
Roger Rousseau, Doris Crabtree, Angela Salafia,
Liliana Marks, Ruben Busquets, Alina Fonts, Blanca Ruiz and their
co-conspirators caused the transfer and disbursement of illicit
proceeds derived from a fraudulent billing scheme into and out of
HCSN’s, PCN’s, and Procare’s various bank accounts to themselves
and to others.5
DR. ROUSSEAU’S role within HCSN-FL did not involve the distribution of
funds.

He did not have control of the above-mentioned accounts. His sole

responsibility was to provide care to his patients.

The government has not

produced any evidence of particular transactions in which DR. ROUSSEAU is
shown to be directly responsible for the transfer or disbursement of illicit
proceeds derived from a fraudulent billing scheme. There do not appear to be
any checks or wires disbursed from HCSN-FL’s corporate accounts in which DR.
ROUSSEAU provided a signature of authorization. We respectfully request that
the government provide DR. ROUSSEAU with specific evidence of his involvement
in the disbursement of illegal funds from HCSN-FL accounts.
II.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a district court
to “direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars, and the broad discretion to
decide whether a bill of particulars is appropriate rests solely in the district
court.”6 “The purpose of a bill of particulars is to inform the defendant of the
charge against him with sufficient precision to allow him to prepare his defense,
to minimize surprise at trial, and to enable him to plead double jeopardy in the

Case 1:13-cr-20505-RNS Document 154 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/10/2013 Page 7 of 9

event of a later prosecution of the same offense.”7 A bill of particulars, though
prohibited from being used as a general discovery device, may be used to
supplement an indictment “by providing the defendant with information
necessary for trial preparation.”8
The Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Bortnovsky provided an
excellent instruction for the propriety of a bill of particulars. The indictment in
Bortnovsky charged the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud the
government by submitting false and inflated insurance claims to the Federal
Emergency Management Administration (“FEMA”) and New York Property
Insurance Underwriting Association for burglary losses. However, the indictment
failed to identify which of the burglaries claimed were the ones the government
intended to prove were fraudulent.

Instead, the government produced over

4,000 documents in discovery. The Second Circuit held that defendants were
hindered in preparing their defense and determined that a bill of particulars was
appropriate. The court additionally stated:
“While we commend the government for cooperating in the turning
over of documents prior to trial, we do not look with favor on the
manner in which the government conducted the prosecution…The
government did not fulfill its obligation by merely providing
mountains of documents to defense counsel who were left
unguided as to which documents would be proven falsified or which
of some fifteen burglaries would be demonstrated to be staged.”
Applying the court’s reasoning in a Medicare fraud prosecution with over
200,000 pieces of paper in hundreds of boxes and files, relating to 2,000
Medicare claims, the court in United States v. Nachamie directed the

Colson, 662 F.2d at 1391.

government to identify which claims were allegedly false and why, despite the
indictment’s general specification of five ways in which the claims were falsified.9
The Eleventh Circuit has similarly applied the reasoning in Bortnovsky.
For example, in United States v. Sampson, the court observed that in the case of
fraud…it is critical that the government identify in the indictment…the specific
fraudulent documents, and the fraudulent statements within the documents.” 10
The court found that a bill of particulars was required so that the defendant may
aptly defend the charges against him. Applying this court’s reasoning to the
instant case, DR. ROUSSEAU’S request is not only reasonable but necessary to his
defense.

The government cannot inundate DR. ROUSSEAU with hundreds of

boxes containing thousands of patient records of a seven year operation, and
expect him to locate those records he allegedly falsified. Vague accusations not
linked to any specific patients can be readily challenged as unreliable and
unsubstantiated.11
Furthermore, it would be impossible for DR. ROUSSEAU to identify whether
he ever examined a patient without knowing the patient’s name and viewing his
medical record. Identification of the patients at issue, and identification of which
documents and/or records were allegedly falsified, is essential to the preparation
of DR. ROUSSEAU’S defense.

Without such information, DR. ROUSSEAU is

susceptible to unfair surprise and has a significant disadvantage at trial.
Therefore, as precedent has established, the government must identify the

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing arguments, the defendant ROGER ROUSSEAU, M.D.
respectfully requests this Court direct the government to provide a bill of
particulars as specifically requested in this motion, and any other such relief it
deems appropriate.
