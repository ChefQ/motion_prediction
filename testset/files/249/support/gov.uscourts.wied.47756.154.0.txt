IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ex rel. TODD HEATH,
oe Civil Case No. 2:08-CV-00876-LA
Plaintiff-Relator, (Lead Case No. 2:08-CV-00724-LA)
v. Judge Lynn Adelman
WISCONSIN BELL, INC.,
Defendant.

 

MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), Defendant, Wisconsin Bell, Inc., moves
for judgment on the pleadings as to the second amended complaint filed by Plaintiff-Relator, Todd
Heath, because Heath cannot plausibly allege that Wisconsin Bell's allegedly false statements
regarding "lowest corresponding price" were material to the government's reimbursement
decisions under the E-Rate program. Judgment on the pleadings is also appropriate on all of
Heath's claims based on Wisconsin Bell's alleged conduct before October 16, 2002 because the
False Claims Act's six-year statute of limitations bars those claims. The grounds for this motion

are set forth more fully in the accompanying memorandum of law.
