INTRODUCTION
AB’s request for bifurcation “on the issue of standing” attempts to mislead the Court

3

into concluding that the resolution of a jurisdictional question would avoid the need to try

4

this case to a jury. It will not. AB’s request to bifurcate misrepresents the triable issues —

5

AB’s seven state-law claims — and in so doing ignores the fact that Defendants have a

6

right to have AB’s state-law claims (and other issues in this case) tried to a jury.

7

First, AB cannot legitimately challenge Solexa’s standing to bring its infringement

8

counterclaims (and therefore the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims).

9

Standing to bring patent infringement claims only requires that one held legal title to the

10

patents-in-suit when one filed the claims. Solexa has held legal title in the patents-in-suit

11

since 1995, when Dr. Macevicz assigned the application underlying the patents-in-suit to

12

Lynx (Solexa’s predecessor). AB cannot dispute that Solexa holds legal title to the patents-

13

in-suit, so it recasts its request for a bench trial on its state-law claims as a “question of

14

standing” in a strained attempt to analogize this case to DDB Techs., L.L.C. v. MLB Ad-

15

vanced Media, L.P., 2008 WL 375202 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 13, 2008). But DDB addressed the

16

right to a jury trial on the issue of jurisdictional standing, not on state-law claims that seek

17

monetary damages, which is what AB brings here. The holding in DDB is not relevant to

18

the present question of a bifurcated bench trial because there is no legitimate issue of juris-

19

dictional standing here. AB’s “standing” argument is a red herring that should be rejected.

20

Second, a bifurcated bench trial on AB’s state-law claims would deny Defendants

21

their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial on those claims. AB seeks money damages as

22

a remedy for its state-law claims. DDB did not change the long-standing Supreme Court

23

case law that holds that where a party seeks a remedy at law — money damages — its op-

24

ponent is entitled to a jury trial. Because AB seeks damages under its state-law claims, De-

25

fendants are entitled to a jury trial on those claims, and holding a bifurcated bench trial on

26

those claims over Defendants’ objections would constitute reversible error.

27
28

Third, holding a trial in May is not reasonable or logistically feasible. The current
schedule calls for fact discovery to continue through May 30, and expert discovery to begin

1

on May 30 and end on July 7.1 Although Defendants served AB with discovery requests

2

regarding the issues raised by AB’s state-law claims more than four months ago, AB has

3

thus far refused to produce discovery regarding those claims. Even if this Court were to or-

4

der AB to comply with its discovery obligations immediately, it would be unfair to require

5

Defendants to process that discovery in time for a trial in May. Moreover, Defendants in-

6

tend to retain experts and rely on their testimony to address important aspects of the central

7

question in AB’s state-law ownership case: whether Dr. Macevicz’s claimed inventions

8

were “related to” AB’s business or its actual or reasonably anticipated research or devel-

9

opment in 1994-95, or resulted from his work at AB. It would not be fair or logistically

10

feasible for Defendants to have to begin and complete expert discovery on these issues in

11

the less than one month that would remain after AB provides discovery on these issues.

12

Defendants have proceeded in this case under the reasonable expectation that they

13

would have until May 30 to complete this fact discovery, and that they would not have to

14

begin expert discovery until May 30. It is not reasonable or feasible to require the parties to

15

complete fact discovery, find and retain experts, prepare expert reports, complete expert

16

discovery, conduct a pre-trial conference, and be ready for a trial on AB’s seven state-law

17

claims by May 12. Moreover, as this Court has recognized, holding a “preliminary” jury

18

trial on the state-law claims could result in two juries having to learn about the background

19

technology, the inventions, and the patents, which would be wasteful of this Court’s, the

20

juries’, and the parties’ time and resources.
Finally, preparing for a jury trial beginning May 12, or at any time prior to the

21
22

scheduled September trial date, would likely require the parties to delay or abandon their

23

efforts to prepare the patent infringement and validity issues for trial in September 2008,

24

which could significantly delay the ultimate resolution of this case and increase the time

25

and resources expended by the Court and the parties to resolve this case.
The Court should deny AB’s motion and permit the parties to complete fact and ex-

II.

ARGUMENT

5

A.

6

AB characterizes the patent ownership issue in this case as a “threshold issue of sub-

7

ject matter jurisdiction that must be resolved before deciding any other aspect of the case.”2

8

Citing DDB, AB argues that Defendants have no “right to a jury trial regarding the Inven-

9

tion Agreement and its effect on standing.”3

10

Jurisdictional standing is not at issue in this case

In its Motion, AB seeks a bifurcated trial only on the issue of standing. The question

11

of standing, however, is an easy one which does not require a trial. Jurisdictional standing

12

is determined “‘as of the commencement of suit.’”4 To have standing to bring infringement

13

claims, a party like Solexa need only have held legal title to the patents-in-suit when it filed

14

those claims.5 Solexa has had legal title to the patents-in-suit since Dr. Macevicz assigned

15

the patent application underlying those patents to Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. (a predecessor of

16

Solexa) on August 31, 1995.6 AB does not and cannot dispute any of this. Thus, jurisdic-

17

tional standing is not at issue here because Solexa had standing when it filed its counter-

18

claims for infringement, and therefore this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over

19

Solexa’s counterclaims.

Defendants are entitled to a jury trial because AB seeks money damages

punitive damages) as a remedy for its state-law claims against one or more Defendants, i.e.,
for interference with contract,8 aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,9 constructive
fraud,10 conversion,11 and unfair competition.12 AB also seeks “profits or income” from one
or more Defendants under its theory of constructive trust.13 AB pled these claims for damages as elements of its state-law claims.
The Court may not bifurcate a trial on AB’s state-law claims from a trial on AB’s
demands for damages as a remedy under those claims. In Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 508 (1959), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected this approach. In
Beacon Theatres, the Court addressed the importance of the order in which legal and equitable claims are to be tried in one suit. While recognizing that “the same court may try both
legal and equitable causes in the same action,” the Supreme Court held that “only under the
most imperative circumstances ... can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through
prior determination of equitable claims.”14 The Court held that it was reversible error to
conduct a bench trial on an equitable claim, thereby precluding a jury trial on the legal
claims, when the equitable claim involved factual issues that were “common” to the legal
claims.
The Supreme Court addressed the issue again in Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369

contract claim against Dairy Queen.15 The breach-of-contract claim sought equitable relief

2

(an injunction) and a legal claim for monetary damages.16 The trial court refused to grant a

3

jury trial on plaintiffs’ breach-of-contract claim. The Supreme Court held that to be re-

4

versible error because “the factual issues related to the question of whether there has been a

5

breach of contract…are common” to the equitable and legal claims for relief.17 Thus,

6

“[w]hen an action calls for the adjudication of legal rights, the trial court must honor the

7

jury demand, whether or not equitable issues are also present.”18

8

Each of AB’s requests for equitable relief on its various state-law claims expressly

9

includes a request for money damages.19 Consequently, there can be no dispute that AB’s

10

state-law claims request legal as well as equitable relief. Because AB seeks monetary dam-

11

ages as a remedy for its state-law claims, Defendants are entitled to a jury trial on those

12

claims. Under the holdings in Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen, the Court cannot resolve

13

the factual disputes underlying AB’s state-law claims without a jury.
Even if it seemed more efficient to sever AB’s state-law claims under Fed. R. Civ.

14
15

P. 42(b), “these considerations are insufficient to overcome the clear command of the Sev-

16

enth Amendment.”20 Indeed, before a court orders bifurcation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b),

“the court must preserve any federal right to a jury trial.” Here, there is no way to avoid

2

violating the Supreme Court’s prohibition against dividing up the legal and equitable por-

3

4

AB grounds its arguments on one case, DDB Techs., L.L.C. v. MLB Advanced Me-

7

dia, L.P., 2008 WL 375202 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 13, 2008). DDB, however, did not address the

8

right to a jury trial on any claim of ownership of a patent or on the types of substantive

9

state-law claims that AB is asserting here. DDB does not answer the question now before

10

the Court: can AB’s state-law claims (e.g., breach of contract and unfair competition) be

11

resolved by the Court when AB seeks monetary damages as a remedy for those claims?

12

DDB Techs. v. MLB Advanced Media does not address the question here

The defendant in DDB moved to dismiss DDB’s patent infringement complaint for

13

lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the ground that the inventor’s employment agreement

14

constituted “an automatic assignment” of the patent-in-suit.21 If the employment agreement

15

constituted an automatic assignment, and the invention fell within the scope of the agree-

16

ment, the patent was automatically assigned to a third party, Schlumberger.22 In that cir-

17

cumstance, DDB would not have owned the patent at the time it filed the complaint, so it

18

would have lacked jurisdictional standing to assert its infringement claim, which was the

19

only claim at issue in DDB.

20
21

In DDB, after a brief hearing, the district court found that the employment agreement constituted an automatic assignment because it stated that the employee “‘agrees to

22
23
24
25
26
27
28

would be unduly burdensome and rejecting “the notion that there is some necessary inconsistency between the desire for speedy justice and the right to jury trial”).

to grant and does hereby grant” all rights in future inventions); Speedplay, Inc. v. Bebop,
Inc., 211 F.3d 1245, 1253 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (automatic assignment where the contract provided that employee’s inventions within the scope of the agreement “shall belong exclusively to [employer] and [employee] hereby conveys, transfers, and assigns to [employer]
... all right, title and interest in and to Inventions”).

and does hereby grant and assign’ all rights in future inventions.”23 The district court also

2

concluded that the invention, computer-simulated baseball games, fell within the scope of

3

the agreement because it was “‘suggested by’ and ‘related to’” the inventor’s work for

4

Schlumberger.24 DDB therefore lacked standing to assert its infringement claim when it

5

filed its complaint, and the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.25

On appeal, the question was whether DDB was “entitled to a jury trial on the juris-

7

dictional issue of standing,”26 not whether DDB was entitled to a jury trial on the types of

8

state-law claims (e.g., breach of contract and unfair competition) brought by AB here. The

9

Federal Circuit held that the district court did not have to wait until after a jury trial on the

10

merits of the patent infringement claim to resolve the jurisdictional issue.27 However, the

11

Federal Circuit was careful to point out that while “DDB has no right to a jury trial on the

12

issue of standing, there of course remains a right to jury trial on other appropriate issues in

13

the case [i.e., substantive claims seeking damages].”28
This case and DDB both involve questions of ownership of a patent, but the similar-

14
15

ity ends there.
First, it is undisputed that Solexa holds legal title to the patents-in-suit, and AB has

16
17

never argued that Dr. Macevicz’s Employee Invention Agreement constituted an automatic

18

assignment of the type at issue in DDB. The “threshold issue of subject matter jurisdiction”

19

that was present in DDB is not at issue in this case.
Second, AB’s purported “standing” issue is wholly derivative of AB’s seven sub-

20
21

stantive state-law claims (e.g., breach of contract, conversion, and breach of fiduciary

22

duty). The Court could grant equitable relief to AB (by transferring ownership of the pat-

ents-in-suit to AB) only if AB were to prevail on those substantive state-law claims. Only

2

after those two things were to occur — which Defendants believe unlikely — would Solexa

3

lack standing to bring, and would the Court lack subject-matter jurisdiction over, the in-

4

fringement counterclaims. In contrast, DDB did not address the question of whether a party

5

has a right to a jury trial to resolve substantive state-law claims.
Third, as discussed above, AB seeks monetary damages under its seven state-law

6
7

claims.29 DDB did not address the right to a jury trial on claims that involve monetary dam-

8

ages.
AB’s attempt to analogize this case to DDB mischaracterizes its substantive state-

9
10

law claims as presenting “a threshold issue of standing.” Although AB never explicitly

11

states which claims it wants to bifurcate, there is no doubt that the issues for trial are not

12

simply a question of jurisdictional standing as was the case in DDB.

13

D.

14

Defendants are entitled to a jury trial despite AB’s mischaracterization
of its state-law claims as presenting an issue of “standing”

As explained in section II.A, supra, Solexa has standing to sue AB for infringement

15
16

of the patents-in-suit because Solexa holds legal title to those patents. Even if there were

17

triable issues on the issue of “standing,” Defendants would still be entitled to a jury trial

18

because “the jurisdictional issue and substantive claims are so intertwined the resolution of

19

the jurisdictional question is dependent on factual issues going to the merits” of AB’s state-

20

law claims.30 Here, unlike in DDB, AB’s state-law claims are based on the very same facts

21

that AB argues present an issue of “jurisdictional standing.”

22

DDB involved a straightforward claim of patent infringement, and the question be-

23

fore the Federal Circuit was whether the issue of infringement and DDB’s standing to as-

sert its claim of infringement “so intertwined with the substantive federal patent law gov-

2

erning DDB’s infringement claims” that a jury would need to resolve the factual issues un-

3

derlying the infringement issue to resolve the question of standing.31 The DDB court held

4

that they were not so intertwined as to prevent the resolution of jurisdictional standing on a

5

Rule 12(b)(6) motion.32

6

Here, the comparison is not between AB’s “jurisdictional standing” issue and

7

Solexa’s patent infringement claim, but between the “standing” issue and AB’s seven state-

8

law claims. What AB refers to as a trial on “standing” is actually a trial on the same state-

9

law claims for which the Defendants have a right to a jury trial.33 Thus, the factual issues

10

are not only “intertwined,” they are identical. Defendants’ right to a jury trial on AB’s

11

state-law claims cannot be set aside by labeling the issue as one of “standing.”
As the Federal Circuit explicitly noted in DDB, although DDB had “no right to a

12
13

jury trial on the issue of standing, there of course remains a right to jury trial on other ap-

14

propriate issues in the case.”34 Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), which requires the preservation

15

of the right to a jury trial, Defendants have a right to a jury trial on the merits of AB’s sub-

16

stantive state-law claims in addition to the issues that relate to monetary damages based on

17

those claims.35

Even if the Court finds AB’s arguments for bifurcation persuasive in the abstract,

AB’s request to hold a trial in May on all of its state-law ownership claims is not reason-

response to Defendants’ long-standing requests regarding the state-law claims, and has in-

dicated that it does not intend to produce such discovery. Moreover, Defendants intend to

7

“related to” AB’s business or its actual or reasonably anticipated research or development

8

in 1994-95, or resulted from his work at AB. Defendants have proceeded in this case under

9

the reasonable expectation that they would have until May 30 to complete fact discovery,

10

and that they would not have to begin expert discovery until May 30. Given AB’s intransi-

12

these issues up by more than four months, before fact discovery is scheduled to close.

14

AB has refused to provide discovery regarding the claims for
which it now seeks an early trial

A trial on AB’s state-law ownership issues in May is not reasonable or feasible pri15

marily because AB has thus far refused to provide discovery regarding an issue at the very
16

core of its state-law ownership claims and Defendants’ affirmative defenses thereto:
17

whether AB’s “business” or its “actual or demonstrably anticipated research or develop18

ment” in 1994-95 “related to” Dr. Macevicz’s novel sequencing-by-ligation inventions.37
19

Although Defendants first requested discovery regarding AB’s state-law claims more than
20

four-and-a-half months ago,38 AB has produced essentially nothing in response to those re21

quests, despite Defendants’ repeated correspondence and conferences with AB’s counsel.39

See Dkt. No. 32, Case Management Order, at 2-3.
Under the terms of the Employee Invention Agreement, Dr. Macevicz’s inventions

AB’s responses to Defendants’ discovery requests40 show that AB has deliberately ob-

2

structed Defendants’ access to the documents necessary to fully develop their affirmative

3

defenses to AB’s state-law claims, by asserting improper objections41 and by refusing to

4

obey this Court’s explicit Orders regarding the conduct of discovery.42

5

For example, AB has produced only a handful of documents having anything to do

6

with its “business” or its “actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development” in

7

1994-95. AB has not stated that such documents do not exist, it has simply refused to pro-

8

duce them. AB has also not produced any documents related to its acquisition of Agencourt

9

Personal Genomics in 2006. This has deprived Defendants of the ability to demonstrate that

10

AB’s “business” and its “actual or reasonably anticipated research or development” had

11

nothing to do with sequencing-by-ligation technology until AB sought to acquire such

12

technology through its acquisition of Agencourt in 2006.
Even where AB has produced documents, its production is far from complete. For

13
14

example, AB has not produced a single e-mail relating to any of its business or research

15

and development endeavors. With regard to the issue of AB’s actual and constructive no-

16

tice of the patents-in-suit, AB has provided only one redacted patent search result, despite

17

the fact that AB’s in-house counsel, Dr. Bortner, admitted that AB conducted patent

Exh. B (AB’s Response to Illumina and Solexa’s First Set of Document Requests).
AB objected to each of Requests 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, & 18 variously as, inter alia, “cumulative,” “vague,” “overly broad,” and “unduly burdensome,” and stated variously that it
would produce only non-privileged “documents sufficient to show,” “documents that it currently expects to rely upon,” or, simply “responsive documents,” rather than all documents
in its possession. AB’s response violates the Court’s Supplemental Order to Order Setting
Initial Case Management Conference, which states that “[a] burden or overbreadth or similar objection shall not be a valid reason for withholding requested materials actually known
to counsel or a party representative responsible for the conduct of the litigation.” (Dkt. No.

42 AB has not provided “promptly after production, confirm[ation] in writing that they
have produced all such materials so described that are locatable after a diligent search of all
locations at which such materials might plausibly exist.” Id. at 3-4. AB has also not provided a “written list . . . setting forth in detail each specific source and location searched[
which identifies] by name and position[] all persons conducting the search and their areas
of search responsibility” or “a list describing the specific source for each produced item . . .

searches in the field of DNA sequencing technology for various purposes, such as deter-

mining if AB had freedom to operate, keeping track of competitors, and searching prior art,

including patent databases, when evaluating invention disclosures.43 Defendants are enti-

5

only to affirmative defenses such as the statute of limitations, but also to the merits of AB’s

6

claim that Dr. Macevicz’s inventions fell within the scope of AB’s business or research and

7

development efforts in 1994-95.
Even if AB were to immediately produce the discovery that it has improperly with-

held, it would not be fair to require Defendants to review all of this discovery, take fact

10

depositions, prepare expert reports, and complete expert discovery regarding these materi-

als in the few weeks between that point and the beginning of May. Granting AB’s request

12

for an early trial on its state-law ownership claims under these circumstances would only

13

reward AB for its improper discovery gamesmanship.

14
15

It is not reasonable or feasible to require Defendants to begin and
complete expert discovery in time for a trial in May

A separate trial on AB’s state-law claims in May, or any time prior to the scheduled
16

trial date, is not reasonable or feasible because Defendants will rely on expert testimony to
17

describe and contrast the DNA sequencing that was used in AB’s business in 1994-95
18

(“Sanger” sequencing) with the novel sequencing-by-ligation technology invented by Dr.
19

Macevicz. The technical differences are central to Defendants’ defense that the Macevicz
20

inventions did “not relate to the business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
21

development of” AB at that time.44 Expert testimony is needed to both explain the two dif22

ferent sequencing technologies, to describe the inventions, and to describe the technology
23

embodied in AB’s commercial products at that time.

It is not reasonable to force Defendants to obtain the missing discovery from AB, re25

7

A separate trial on AB’s state-law claims in May will necessarily cause significant

8

inefficiencies for the subsequent proceedings. Rather than holding a hasty trial before the

9

close of fact discovery, it would be far more efficient to allow the parties to complete dis-

10

covery according to the current schedule and proceed to trial on infringement and any of

11

AB’s state-law claims that survive Defendants’ pending motion for summary judgment on

12

the statute-of-limitations issue.

13

A trial on all issues beginning on September 29 is more efficient

First, an early trial on ownership would be inefficient because, regardless of its out-

14

come, it would necessitate a departure from the current trial schedule. A trial in May on the

15

ownership issues would necessarily disrupt the current case schedule because the tremen-

16

dous amount of labor and money necessary to bring a case to trial would have to be ex-

17

pended in less than five weeks, even if the Court issued an Order simultaneously with AB’s

18

filing of its reply on the instant motion on April 1. Without question, preparation for an

19

early trial would disrupt and displace the orderly completion of fact and expert discovery

20

and motion practice contemplated by the current schedule, thereby producing significant

21

inefficiencies.

22

Second, bifurcating the trial will likely just create the need for two trials. There is

23

little doubt that one trial is more efficient than two. Indeed, there is likely to be significant

24

overlap between witnesses at both trials, regardless of the outcome on the ownership is-

AB has not carried its burden to show that the efficiency, if any, to be gained by immedi-

11

AB’s motion to bifurcate should be denied because bifurcation of AB’s state-law

prejudicing Solexa. Although this Court has broad authority to “order a separate trial of any

claim” in the interest of “convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be

15

conducive to expedition and economy,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), AB bears “the burden of

16

proving that bifurcation is justified given the facts in this case.”48 Because AB has failed to

17

“present sufficient facts to show that bifurcation will promote judicial economy or that no

18

party will be prejudiced by the bifurcation,”49 AB’s motion to bifurcate should be denied.

For example, Dr. Macevicz would likely have to testify regarding the state-law claims

8

AB has not shown that bifurcation will avoid prejudice to AB

9

To show that bifurcation is warranted, AB must show that bifurcation would avoid

prejudice to AB.50 AB argued that an early trial would save AB from having to argue that

11

the Macevicz patents, patents AB contends it owns, are invalid and unenforceable.51 This

12

argument is nonsensical; AB has already publicly taken the positions it now tells the Court

13

that bifurcation would allow it to avoid.

14

On November 7, 2007, in its First Amended Complaint, AB asserted that the pat-

15

ents-in-suit are invalid and unenforceable.52 The same day, AB said the same thing in its

16

Second Amended Reply to Solexa’s Counterclaims.53 Then, on November 19, 2007, AB

17

served its Preliminary Invalidity Contentions, in which it again asserted that the patents-in-

18

suit are invalid and unenforceable. Having made these public statements, AB has every rea-

19

son to go forward with a trial on the merits of its invalidity and unenforceability conten-

20

tions.54 Because bifurcation will not avoid any “prejudice” to AB from having to repeat and

21

defend arguments it has already made, AB cannot show that bifurcation is necessary to

22

avoid prejudice, and its motion should be denied.

CONCLUSION
AB’s motion, framed as a motion to bifurcate the issue of “jurisdictional standing,”

3

actually seeks a bench trial on AB’s seven state-law claims, each of which involves a claim

4

for monetary damages. AB’s affirmative claims for monetary damages preclude separating

5

the issues that must be tried to a jury (i.e., AB’s claims for monetary damages) from the

6

factual inquiries underlying AB’s substantive state-law claims. For this reason alone, the

7

Court should deny AB’s motion to bifurcate. AB’s motion should also be denied because it

8

would be neither reasonable nor logistically feasible to hold a trial in May, and there is a

9

substantial likelihood that holding such a “preliminary” trial in May will necessitate in-

10

creased expenditures of time and resources by the Court, the juries, and the parties as com-

11

pared to holding a single trial on all remaining issues in September.
