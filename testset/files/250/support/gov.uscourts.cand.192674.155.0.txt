MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

I.

3

On February 13, this Court issued an order inviting the parties to brief “whether the issue

INTRODUCTION

4

of ownership is for the judge or for the jury.” (Order Re Issue of Ownership of Patent, Docket

5

No. 131, at 1.) On the very same day, the Federal Circuit, addressing what it called an issue of

6

first impression, answered the Court’s question: In cases interpreting whether an employment

7

agreement obligates an inventor to assign an invention to his employer, there is no right to a jury

8

trial on the issue of standing. DDB Techs., L.L.C. v. MLB Advanced Media, L.P., No. 2007-1211,

9

2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 3086, at *15-*17 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 13, 2008). As acknowledged by

10

Defendants, a determination that the patents at issue belong to AB under the Invention Agreement

11

would deprive them of standing for their federal patent law claims. (See Docket No. 114, at 4-5.)

12

Under DDB, that determination is for the Court, not the jury.

13

In the same February 13 Order, the Court also inquired “whether the issue of ownership of

14

the patents should be severed.” (Docket No. 131, at 1.) Bifurcation is appropriate here because

15

Illumina’s lack of standing is a threshold issue of subject matter jurisdiction that must be resolved

16

before deciding any other aspect of the case. If the Court finds that Illumina does not have

17

standing, then (1) there is no jurisdictional basis for any further inquiry into any of the claims

18

raised by the parties with respect to issues of patent infringement, willfulness, damages,

19

invalidity, and unenforceability, and (2) because of the lack of federal court jurisdiction, any

20

remaining claims could be remanded back to state court for resolution.

21

Bifurcation of standing is highly efficient, because if the Court concludes that AB owns

22

the patents, it will moot the expensive, and potentially unnecessary, trial of the infringement,

23

willfulness, damages, invalidity, and unenforceability case. Standing can be decided without

24

considering any of the extensive evidence relating only to infringement, willfulness, damages,

25

invalidity, and unenforceability of the patents. AB therefore requests that, subject to the Court’s

26

calendar, a bench trial on standing be set during May 2008 and the infringement, willfulness,

27

damages, invalidity, and unenforceability trial, if necessary, remain set for September 29, 2008.

II.

2

The issues, evidence, and witnesses regarding the Invention Agreement are a small

3

fraction of the issues regarding whether the patents are valid and infringed, and if so, the amount

4

of damages. The principal issues on the Invention Agreement are whether Macevicz was

5

obligated to assign the inventions, whether Illumina was a bona fide purchaser for value, and

6

whether the statute of limitations applies. These are very different from the issues of whether

7

AB’s SOLiD™ system infringes the patents, the amount of any damages due to the infringement,

8

and whether the patents are invalid in light of the prior art.

9
10
11

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A.

The Ownership Dispute
1.

Macevicz’s Obligation To Assign The Inventions To AB

The first issue regarding standing is whether AB’s former Senior Patent Counsel, Dr.

12

Stephen Macevicz, breached his Employee Invention Agreement (the “Invention Agreement”).

13

The Court found that AB “has a strong case on the merits” of its claim that Macevicz was

14

required to assign the patent application to AB. (Docket No. 88, at 6, 10-11.)

15

In 1992, Macevicz signed the Invention Agreement, in which he promised to assign his

16

inventions to AB. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 1 ¶ 2.) The only exception was for inventions that were

17

developed entirely on his own time and without company resources, and were unrelated to AB’s

18

business. Macevicz further agreed that if he believed the invention fell within the exception, he

19

would promptly disclose, in writing, what the invention was and the grounds for his belief that it

20

fell within the exception. (Id. ¶ 7.)

21

While working for AB, Macevicz invented what he described as a method of DNA

22

sequencing by ligation. On April 17, 1995, he filed a patent application entitled “DNA

23

Sequencing By Parallel Oligonucleotide Extensions,” (Wilson Decl. Ex. 4.) Although the

24

invention was squarely within AB’s line of business, he did not disclose it to his supervisor,

25

Michael Hunkapiller, or anyone else at AB. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 2 at 104:24-105:7; 106:5-107:23;

26

173:10-174:4.) Four months later, on August 7, 1995, Macevicz left AB. Three weeks later, on

1

August 31, 1995, he purported to assign the patent application to Lynx.1 (Wilson Decl. Ex. 8.)

2

That application led to the three patents at issue in this case.

3

Macevicz argues that he “didn’t consider these inventions to be a part of the AB

4

business.” (Id. at 107:7-8.) The Invention Agreement, however, covers inventions that “relate to

5

the business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development” of AB. (Wilson

6

Decl. Ex. 1 ¶ 2(c)(i).) Moreover, the Invention Agreement required him to promptly disclose, in

7

writing, the inventions and the grounds for his belief that he did not use any AB resources

8

developing the inventions and that they did not relate to AB’s business, which he admitted he

9

never did.

10
11

2.

Illumina’s BFP Defense

Illumina claims to be a bona fide purchaser for value. To qualify as a BFP, Illumina will

12

have to show that it (1) acquired an interest in the patents (2) by paying valuable consideration (3)

13

to the legal title holder (4) without notice of an outstanding equitable claim or title on the patent.

14

See FilmTec Corp. v. Allied-Signal Inc., 939 F.2d 1568, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (citing Hendrie v.

15

Sayles, 98 U.S. 546, 549 (1879)).

16

Illumina claims that its predecessor, Lynx, paid Macevicz for the patent application.

17

Lynx, however, paid Macevicz nothing for the application. Illumina’s corporate designee, Kathy

18

San Roman, testified that Illumina is not aware of any compensation being provided to Macevicz

19

for the application. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 5 at 76:14-25.) Even when value is paid, a BFP must

20

purchase “without notice” of an outstanding equitable claim or title. AB contends that Lynx

21

cannot be a BFP because Macevicz’s knowledge of his obligation to assign the patent application

22

to AB is imputed to Lynx. As an officer of Lynx when he assigned the application, he “would

23

clearly be on notice of the provisions of his own contract.” FilmTec, 939 F.2d at 1574.

24
25

AB also contends that Lynx had more than enough information to put it on inquiry notice.
Sam Eletr, the CEO of Lynx, negotiated with Macevicz to assign the application. (Wilson Decl.

26
1

27

Lynx merged with Solexa in 2005. (Docket No. 55, ¶ 2.) Illumina acquired Solexa in
January 2007. (Id.) The three entities are referred to collectively herein as “Illumina.”

Document 155

Page 8 of 18

1

Ex. 2 at 123:1-124:6.) Eletr was also a founder of AB and was familiar with AB’s policies

2

concerning employee inventions. The same law firm, Cooley Godward, worked for both Lynx

3

and AB at that time, handled the spin-off of Lynx, and drafted Lynx’s employee invention

4

agreement, which is identical to AB’s Invention Agreement. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 5 at 22:14-25:6,

5

60:4-16 & 142:18-22.) And Lynx was a spin-off of AB, so Eletr and others knew that DNA

6

sequencing was within AB’s line of business. They also knew that Macevicz conceived of and

7

reduced to practice his invention while employed by AB.

8

3.

Illumina’s Statute Of Limitations Defense

9

Illumina also argues that AB’s rights to the patents are barred by the statute of limitations.

10

This issue, which is currently before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment, has little

11

to do with the issues of infringement, invalidity, or inequitable conduct. Macevicz admits that he

12

owed AB a fiduciary duty (Wilson Decl. Ex. 2 at 23:8-23), which means that AB would have a

13

duty to investigate his wrongdoing only if it became aware of facts that would make a reasonably

14

prudent person suspicious. See Miller v. Bechtel Corp., 33 Cal. 3d 868, 875 (1983). The issues,

15

evidence and witnesses regarding (1) AB’s lack of actual notice, (2) the absence of information

16

creating a duty of inquiry until February 2006, and (3) the legal effect of Macevicz’s fiduciary

17

duty, are a fraction of the issues, evidence and witnesses on the infringement, willfulness,

18

damages, invalidity, and inequitable conduct issues.

19
20

B.

The Infringement, Willfulness, Damages, Invalidity, And
Unenforceability Case

The infringement issues involve only whether AB’s SOLiD™ system meets the claim
21
limitations as construed by the Court. For example, all of the asserted claims in the ’341 and ’597
22
patents require determining the identity of at least one target nucleotide within each cycle. The
23
Court held that “identifying” a nucleotide means “within each cycle determining the identity of a
24
base in the target polynucleotide.” AB’s SOLiD™ system does not determine the identity of a
25
base within each cycle. Claim 1 of the ’341 patent also requires that the “initializing
26
oligonucleotide probe” be hybridized to a “target polynucleotide.” The Court held that although
27
the specification teaches that the initializing oligonucleotide probe is hybridized to the known

Page 9 of 18

1

region, the claim requires that it be hybridized to the target region. (Docket No. 133, at 8-10.) In

2

the SOLiD™ system, the initializing oligonucleotide probe hybridizes to the known region, not

3

the target region.

4

Claim 1 of the ’119 patent requires a probe with a cleavable bond of a particular formula.

5

The formula “—OP(==O)(O—)NH” means that there must be nitrogen atom (N) in the particular

6

location claimed. Illumina does not dispute that the probes used in the SOLiD™ system use a

7

sulfur atom (S) in place of the required nitrogen atom, but contends that AB’s probes infringe

8

under the doctrine of equivalents.

9

AB has also disclosed several prior art references that anticipate or render the asserted

10

claims obvious. AB further asserts that the patents are unenforceable due to Macevicz’s failure to

11

disclose material prior art to the patent examiner.

12
13

C.

Trial Of The Ownership Case

The ownership case will involve analysis of events that took place primarily in 1992

14

through mid-1995, when Macevicz worked for AB, as well as the period shortly after he left AB.

15

Macevicz will be the main witness on the relevant issues. AB anticipates that it will also offer the

16

testimony of current and former AB employees, including Macevicz’s former supervisor Michael

17

Hunkapiller, and the AB employee who first learned of the Macevicz patents, Scott Bortner. Dr.

18

Hunkapiller left AB several years ago and has minimal knowledge about the SOLiD™ system

19

that Illumina accuses of infringement. (Wilson Decl. ¶ 10.) AB does not yet know what

20

testimony will be offered by Illumina. Its testimony will, though, necessarily be focused on AB’s

21

business and the actions of AB, Illumina and Macevicz during the 1990s. While Defendants may

22

argue that an understanding of AB’s business is relevant to both the Invention Agreement and

23

patent sides of this litigation, there are two significant differences. First, the infringement part of

24

the case is directed at the current time frame, while the standing part of the case is not. The

25

Invention Agreement trial will address the scope of AB’s business during the early to mid-1990s.

26

By contrast, to resolve the patent issues, the jury will need to understand the details of AB’s

27

SOLiD™ system, which was first placed in 2007.

6

Case 3:07-cv-02845-WHA

1

Document 155

Filed 03/12/2008

Page 10 of 18

Second, the two sides of the case require different types of knowledge about AB’s

2

business. On the Invention Agreement issues, the key inquiry concerns the overall breadth of

3

AB’s business, at a high and general level, in the early to mid-1990s. The patent issues, on the

4

other hand, will also require jurors to learn about a specific product – one particular aspect of

5

AB’s current business – in great depth and detail to be able to conduct an element-by-element

6

infringement analysis.

7

Illumina’s primary affirmative defense is that Lynx was a bona fide purchaser for value.

8

The evidence on this defense will focus on Lynx’s acquisition in 1995 of the patent application

9

that spawned the Macevicz patents, many years before what is now known as the SOLiD™

10

system was invented. This will have little relevance to the question of whether the SOLiD™

11

system infringes the Macevicz patents, or whether the patents are valid or enforceable.

12

Illumina’s other affirmative defense is based on the statute of limitations. The evidence

13

on this defense will focus on whether AB became aware of facts that would make a reasonably

14

prudent person suspicious of Macevicz before it obtained actual knowledge of the Macevicz

15

patents and started this litigation in 2006. This too will have little relevance to the question of

16

whether the SOLiD™ system infringes the Macevicz patents, or whether the patents are valid.

17
18
19
20

AB anticipates that the Invention Agreement case will take about two or three days to try
to the Court, and that the parties could be ready for trial as early as May 8, 2008.
D.

Trial Of The Infringement, Willfulness, Damages, Invalidity, And
Unenforceability Case

The infringement case will require an analysis of AB’s SOLiD™ system. The system
21
originated at Agencourt Personal Genomics in Massachusetts, which AB acquired in 2006. The
22
first system was placed with customers in June 2007. To explain the detailed operation of the
23
system, including its chemistry and software, AB expects to offer the testimony of several AB
24
scientists who have worked on developing the system. AB also expects to offer the testimony of
25
at least one technical expert.
26
The invalidity case will involve an analysis of the prior art, which AB expects will be
27
handled primarily by technical experts. The unenforceability case involves Macevicz’s

1

knowledge of prior art references which he did not disclose to the Patent Office. The witnesses

2

are expected to be technical and PTO experts, as well as Macevicz.

3

The patent damages case will involve evidence concerning lost profits and determination

4

of a reasonable royalty under the Georgia-Pacific factors. Other witnesses will include AB and

5

Illumina sales and marketing people regarding AB’s and Illumina’s sales and other financials, and

6

experts on damages issues.

AB anticipates that trial of the infringement, willfulness, damages, invalidity, and

III.

ARGUMENT
A.

Illumina Has No Right To A Jury Trial On The Effect Of The
Invention Agreement On Standing.

Standing is a jurisdictional issue that must be resolved by the court before proceeding with
12
any other aspect of this case. See Ortho Pharm. Corp. v. Genetics Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 103213
33 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (“[B]efore a federal court can consider the merits of a legal claim, the person
14

(citations omitted). The Federal Circuit’s recent decision in DDB Technologies, 2008 U.S. App.
16
LEXIS 3086, is dispositive on Defendants’ lack of right to a jury trial regarding the Invention
17
Agreement and its effect on standing. In DDB, brothers David and Daniel Barstow were the
18
named inventors on three patents relating to a method for generating a computer simulation of a
19
live event and a fourth patent relating to a method allowing a viewer to search for information
20
about a live event. Id. at *2. The brothers formed DDB Technologies (“DDB”) and purported to
21
assign their patents to that company. Id.
22
During the time David Barstow (“Barstow”) was filing his patent applications and
23
purporting to assign them to DDB, he was working as a computer scientist for Schlumberger
24
Technology Corporation. Barstow and Schlumberger had an invention agreement that required
25
Barstow to promptly disclose his inventions to his employer:

2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 3086, at *3-*4.2
Ten years after Barstow left Schlumberger, DDB filed suit against MLB Advanced Media
(“MLB”) alleging patent infringement. MLB purchased whatever interest Schlumberger owned
in the patents, and moved to dismiss the case based on its claim of ownership through the
Barstow-Schlumberger invention agreement. Id. at *6-7.
The district court held a hearing, weighed the facts in dispute, and found that the patents
fell within the scope of Barstow’s employee invention agreement. Id. at *8. The district court
held that it lacked jurisdiction because DDB could not sue a co-owner of the patent, and therefore
lacked standing. Id.
On appeal, DDB argued that the district court should not have dismissed the case on
jurisdictional grounds without first having a jury trial on the merits as to whether the employee
invention agreement required assignment of the patents. Id. at *15. The Federal Circuit first

The Invention Agreement in DDB provided for “automatic assignment,” while the AB
Invention Agreement imposes an obligation to assign. Automatic assignment was one ground on
which the district court in DDB held that the defenses of waiver, estoppel, and statute of
limitations were not available to DDB, which the Federal Circuit affirmed, but played no role in
the Federal Circuit’s analysis of the jury trial issue.

clarified the issue of what law controls. It held that because the question of a patentee’s right to a

2

jury trial implicates patent law, its resolution is governed by the law of the Federal Circuit, not the

3

regional circuits. Id. at *15-*16. It also stated that “the right to a jury trial on disputed

4

jurisdictional facts that also implicate the merits of plaintiff’s cause of action is an issue of first

5

impression for this court.” Id. at *16. Thus, to the extent that any earlier decisions from other

6

circuits are inconsistent with DDB, they are not controlling.

7

The Federal Circuit noted that district courts should consider “the degree of

8

intertwinement of jurisdictional facts and facts underlying the substantive claim [to] determine

9

the appropriate procedure for resolution of those facts.” Id. at *16. Applying that standard to

10

DDB, the Federal Circuit held that “the interpretation of the employment agreement, which

11

depends in part on state contract law and in part on this circuit’s law regarding patent assignment

12

clauses, is not so intertwined with the substantive federal patent law governing DDB’s

13

infringement claims and [MLB]’s invalidity counterclaims that dismissal on jurisdictional

14

grounds would be inappropriate.” Id. at *16-*17. Therefore, it held that “DDB has no right to a

15

jury trial on the issue of standing.” Id. at *17.

16

The same minimal degree of intertwinement is present here. Defendants’ standing

17

depends on interpretation of the Invention Agreement, Macevicz’s actions during the early to

18

mid-1990s, and Illumina’s assertions that it is a BFP and that the statute of limitations has run.

19

The substantive federal law issues on which the Defendants would be entitled to a jury trial

20

revolve around whether the SOLiD™ system infringes the Macevicz patents, the amount of any

21

damages, whether the patents are valid, and whether they are unenforceable. There is little

22

intertwinement between the two sets of issues.

23

The minimal intertwinement between the substantive patent law issues and the ownership

24

issues is further illustrated by Illumina’s affirmative defenses. Its primary defense appears to be

25

that Lynx was a BFP and its successors, Solexa and Illumina, inherited that status. To qualify as

26

a BFP, Illumina has the burden of showing that Lynx (1) acquired an interest in the patents (2) by

27

paying valuable consideration (3) to the legal title holder (4) without notice of an outstanding

28

equitable claim or title on the patent. See FilmTec, 939 F.2d at 1573 (citing Hendrie v. Sayles, 98

U.S. 546, 549 (1879)); Fitzgerald v. Terminal Dev. Co., 11 Cal. App. 2d 126, 133 (Ct. App.

2

1936). The resolution of each of these prongs does not involve any analysis of AB’s SOLiD™

3

system. In fact, consideration of the SOLiD™ system in resolving these claims would be

4

impossible because it did not even exist at the time.

5

Similarly, Illumina’s defense based on the statute of limitations has little, if any,

6

intertwinement with the substantive patent issues. This defense involves (1) AB’s lack of actual

7

notice, (2) the absence of information creating a duty of inquiry until February 2006, and (3) the

8

legal effect of Macevicz’s fiduciary duty. These are distinct from the issues of infringement,

9

damages, invalidity, or inequitable conduct.

11

There Should Be A Bench Trial On Standing Before Proceeding With
The Infringement, Invalidity, And Inequitable Conduct Issues.

The issue of standing must be decided first. Ortho Pharm., 52 F.3d at 1032-33. AB
12
proposes that the Court hold a bench trial on standing beginning as early as May 8, 2008 and
13
continuing for two to three days, which should be sufficient time for the parties to present all of
14
their evidence and testimony on this issue. An early bench trial will avoid any delay and preserve
15
the existing September 29 date for the trial on the patent infringement, damages, willfulness,
16
invalidity, and inequitable conduct issues, if still necessary.
17
1.

18

Standing Is A Threshold Issue To Be Decided First.

Illumina’s lack of standing is a threshold subject matter jurisdiction issue that must be
19

resolved before proceeding with any other aspect of the case.3 See id. The Court may hear

20
evidence and weigh facts as necessary to determine jurisdiction. See Kahn v. Gen. Motors Corp.,
21
77 F.3d 457, 459 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (“The ownership of patent property is a matter of law, the
22
decision of which may entail underlying factual inquiries.”); Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d
23
1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987). If the Court finds that Illumina does not have standing, then there is
24
no jurisdictional basis for any further inquiry into any of the claims raised by the parties with
25
respect to issues of patent infringement, willfulness, damages, invalidity, and unenforceability,
26
3

27

Illumina agrees that if the Court rules for AB on the ownership claims, then Illumina no
longer has standing to sue. (Docket No. 114 at 4-5.)

and the remaining claims should be resolved in state court. See Propat Int’l Corp. v. RPost, Inc.,

An Early Bench Trial On Standing Will Promote Efficiency.

Bifurcation is appropriate when a separate trial will promote efficiency or avoid prejudice.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b) provides in pertinent part:
The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or
when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy,
may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim,
or third party claim, or of any separate issues or of any number of
claims . . . .

10

Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b). “Under Rule 42(b), the district court has broad discretion to bifurcate a

11

trial to permit deferral of costly and possibly unnecessary proceedings pending resolution of

12

potentially dispositive preliminary issues.” Jinro Am. Inc. v. Secure Invs., Inc., 266 F.3d 993, 998

13

(9th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added).

14

Bifurcating the issue of Illumina’s standing to sue for an early bench trial has precisely

15

this benefit. It may dispose of Illumina’s infringement allegations and thus avoid wasting the

16

time and resources of the Court, the jury, and the parties in trying the issues of infringement,

17

damages, willfulness, invalidity, and inequitable conduct. See Kahn v. Gen. Motors Corp., 865 F.

18

Supp. 210, 215 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (“If [plaintiff] does not own the patent, the parties will have

19

saved the substantial cost of preparing for and conducting the trial on the infringement issues.”);

20

F & G Scrolling Mouse L.L.C. v. IBM Corp., 190 F.R.D. 385, 390 (M.D.N.C. 1999) (“At times, a

21

special issue may be found to merit its own separate trial, such as patent ownership . . . .”).

22

a.

23

The standing issues are a fraction of the issues to be
decided at an infringement trial.

A separate trial on standing is also more efficient. As discussed above, the issues to be
24
tried on standing are a fraction of the issues to be tried in the infringement, damages, invalidity,
25
and unenforceability case. Defendants’ standing depends on interpretation of the Invention
26
Agreement and its application to events occurring in the early to mid-1990’s, while the patent case

is about a specific product that was not launched until 2007, which will be the subject of days of

2

expert testimony irrelevant to standing.

3

Both standing and the patent case require some knowledge of technology. For standing,

4

this is knowledge about the scope of AB’s business in 1995, and a general understanding of DNA

5

sequencing. For the patent case, this will be a detailed understanding of the patents and the

6

asserted claims, at an element-by-element level, and a detailed understanding of the complex

7

SOLiD™ system as it works today. These subject areas are so different that trying them together

8

will likely confuse matters rather than clarify them.

9

The damages and invalidity cases are also separate from the standing issues. The

10

invalidity case requires comparing the scope of the asserted claims to what was taught by the prior

11

art. The damages issues involve recent financial data. Neither of these subject areas overlaps

12

significantly with the issue of Macevicz’s obligation to assign the invention to AB.

13

b.

14

The standing case will involve a fraction of the witnesses
involved in the infringement case.

The witnesses who will testify regarding standing are also a fraction of the witnesses who
15
will testify regarding infringement. In addition to the different fact witnesses described above,
16
there will be extensive expert witness testimony that will be essential to the infringement,
17
damages, invalidity, and inequitable conduct case but irrelevant to standing.
18
The only witnesses who AB believes will have testimony potentially relevant to both
19
standing and the patent case are Macevicz, Michael Hunkapiller (the named inventor on a prior art
20
patent), and Vincent Powers (the patent attorney who prosecuted the patents for Lynx, and later
21
worked for AB). But the subject matter of their testimony concerning standing will be but a
22
fraction of their testimony in the patent case. Illumina acknowledges this, and took the position
23
that depositions of witnesses to date would cover only ownership issues, not infringement.
24
(Wilson Decl. Ex. 7 at 81:11-82:9.) Illumina even objected when AB questioned Dr. Powers
25
about subjects that Illumina thought were related to enforceability. (Id. at 80:6-82:9.)
26
Aside from these limited exceptions, the witnesses who will testify regarding standing will
27
not testify regarding infringement, damages, invalidity, and unenforceability issues, and those

who will testify regarding infringement, damages, invalidity, and unenforceability issues will not

2

testify regarding standing. The parties could readily expedite the completion of any remaining

3

discovery relating to standing there might be so that a bench trial on standing could commence as

4

early as May 8, 2008.

5
6

c.

The potential savings of judicial resources is significant.

Standing is much simpler than the patent case. It can be tried in about two to three days,

7

as opposed to Illumina’s estimate of eight days to try all of the issues in the case. (Docket No. 26,

8

at 15.) (AB believes that ten days is a more realistic estimate.) A bench trial on standing has the

9

potential to resolve this litigation much more quickly than a jury trial on infringement. Trying all

10

of the issues in a single jury trial, by contrast, would require the jury to sit through the

11

presentation of witnesses, testimony, and other evidence that may be mooted by the resolution of

12

the standing issue. This is inefficient, regardless of how the Court rules on standing. If AB wins

13

on standing, the inefficiency is the greatest, since the infringement, damages, willfulness,

14

invalidity, and inequitable conduct portions of the trial will have been unnecessary.4 Kahn, 865

15

F. Supp. at 215 (holding that a single trial on ownership and infringement would be

16

“unreasonable and wasteful”). But even if Illumina wins on standing, there is still inefficiency

17

because the jury will have had to sit through a trial that was longer than necessary to resolve the

18

jury issues.

19

Bifurcation avoids these inefficiencies. If AB wins on standing, the federal case will be

20

over and significant judicial resources will have been saved. In fact, under AB’s proposed

21

schedule this case could be completely resolved in May. If AB does not win on standing, the jury

22

trial will be more focused and shorter. Id. (“If [plaintiff] prevails on the title issue, the half-day

23

trial will not have been in vain, and the parties can prepare for the final showdown.”).

24
25
26
27

4

The district courts have discretion in how to decide inequitable conduct. See Hebert v.
Lisle Corp., 99 F.3d 1109, 1114 (Fed. Cir. 1996). A court may decide the issue itself, submit
special interrogatories to the jury on the facts relating to materiality and intent, or instruct the jury
to find and weigh the facts of materiality and intent and decide the ultimate question of
inequitable conduct.

Bifurcation is fair because otherwise AB will have to
attack its own patents.

Finally, resolving standing quickly and first will prevent the prejudice to AB from having
to take “accused infringer” positions against its own patents at trial. This avoids putting AB in
the unfair position of having to attack the validity and enforceability of patents it owns. Although
this factor alone has not led the Court to order bifurcation previously, it is another factor weighing
in favor of bifurcation now that standing is ready for decision and the Federal Circuit has clarified
that defendants have no right to a jury trial on standing.

CONCLUSION

AB respectfully requests that the issue of standing be set for an early bench trial, and that
the remaining issues be bifurcated and remain set for trial on September 29, 2008.
