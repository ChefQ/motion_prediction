Opposition to Motion to Vacate

INTRODUCTION
MDY’s motion to vacate the permanent injunction imposed under 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(2) hinges on a nonsensical contention—that enforcing the judgment on a
claim they lost on appeal would be “inconsistent” with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion.
On the contrary, the Ninth Circuit spoke, in no uncertain terms, to the precise issue

Case 2:06-cv-02555-DGC Document 161

raised by MDY here when it held: “We affirm the district court’s entry of a

2

permanent injunction against MDY to prevent future § 1201(a)(2) violations.” MDY

3

Indus., LLC v. Blizzard Entmt., Inc., 629 F.3d 928, 954 (9th Cir. 2010) as amended

4

on denial of rehearing by 2011 WL 538748 (9th Cir. Feb. 17, 2011) (“MDY”).

5

Under the rule of mandate doctrine, this Court is bound to sustain the injunction it

6

granted and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

7

Further, MDY’s purported basis for disregarding the rule of mandate (that

8

MDY has a § 1201(f) defense) was also explicitly addressed, and rejected, by the

9

Ninth Circuit. MDY, 629 F.3d at 954 n.19. Beyond even the specific affirmance of

10

the injunction, this secondary ruling is now also the law of the case binding this

11

Court.

12

Finally, even accepting MDY’s bizarre interpretation of the law of the case

13

doctrine, MDY’s own motion plainly demonstrates that the Ninth Circuit correctly

14

deemed their 1201(f) argument waived. Specifically, MDY acknowledges that

15

“neither party raised § 1201(f) at summary judgment…” (MDY Mot. at 4:1-2). That

16

admission is fatal. This Court had not held that MDY was a copyright infringer prior

17

to ruling on the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment, and MDY’s failure to

18

raise its (meritless 1) § 1201(f) argument at that time precludes it from doing so now,

19

after the DMCA issues have been fully litigated through summary judgment, a bench

20

trial, cross-appeals, and finally a petition for panel rehearing that yielded an amended

21

opinion specifically addressing MDY’s prior failures to raise the affirmative defense.

22

In short, the DMCA case against MDY is over. The appellate court has spoken,

23

and MDY has abandoned further appellate review to an en banc or higher Court.

24

Accordingly, the Court should deny MDY’s frivolous motion, affirm the permanent

Although MDY’s motion is clearly barred by the rule of mandate and law of the
case, for the sake of preserving its substantive arguments on the § 1201(f) issue,
Blizzard addresses the issue in brief in Section III herein. As that discussion shows,
MDY’s choice not to assert § 1201(f) at any prior point in the proceedings was a
rational one, as MDY plainly cannot claim it is entitled to the § 1201(f) defense.

ARGUMENT
I.

The Rule of Mandate Compels Entr y of a Per manent Injunction
Against MDY on the § 1201(a)(2) Claims.

5

The rule of mandate doctrine provides as follows:

6

When a case has been once decided by this court on appeal, and remanded to
the [district court], whatever was before this court, and disposed of by its
decree, is considered as finally settled. The [district court] is bound by the
decree as the law of the case, and must carry it into execution according to the
mandate. That court cannot vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than
execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent
error, upon any matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to
settle so much as has been remanded.... But the [district court] may consider
and decide any matters left open by the mandate of this court....

United States v. Thrasher, 483 F.3d 977, 981-982 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing In re
Sanford Fork & Tool Co., 160 U.S. 247, 255-56 (1895)). The Ninth Circuit
addressed the permanent injunction against MDY unequivocally, stating: “We affirm
the district court’s entry of a permanent injunction against MDY to prevent future
§ 1201(a)(2) violations.” MDY, 629 F.3d at 954. As the quoted language makes
clear, the issue of entry of the permanent injunction was not left open. 3 It was
affirmed. Accordingly, under long settled law, the rule of mandate means that this
Court court cannot review or revise the Ninth Circuit’s affirmance of the permanent
injunction, it may only execute it. Given the Ninth Circuit’s clear direction, even if
2

25

Blizzard did not oppose MDY filing a motion requesting oral argument after it had
already filed its motion to vacate, but respectfully submits that MDY’s substantive
motion is plainly foreclosed by controlling law and thus that no oral argument is
necessary.

28

Any suggestion that the Ninth Circuit “left open” the entry of the injunction against
MDY under § 1201(a)(2) is absurd. The Ninth Circuit’s opinion made clear which
issues it remanded for determination by this Court, such as Michael Donnelly’s
personal liability under § 1201(a)(2). MDY, 629 F.3d at 958 n.25.

an argument somehow existed that MDY had not had a previous opportunity to raise

2

(not the case here), this Court would have no discretion to entertain it or disturb the

3

injunction. As such, this Court must dismiss MDY’s motion and immediately enter

the permanent injunction against it and allow Blizzard to begin enforcing its

5

II.

7

MDY Waived Any Defense or Ar gument Under § 1201(f).
A. The Ninth Cir cuit’s Rejection of MDY’s § 1201(f) Ar gument is Law
of the Case.

8

MDY’s contention that entry of the permanent injunction would be

9
10

“inconsistent” with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion is preposterous given that the

11

appellate court not only affirmed entry of the § 1201(a)(2) judgment, but explicitly

12

rejected the exact argument MDY posits here for excusing its liability. Following the

13

Ninth Circuit’s issuance of its opinion, MDY petitioned the panel for rehearing,

14

claiming that the Ninth Circuit had “overlooked or misapprehended a critical subpart

15

in 17 U.S.C. § 1201…” that MDY had not previously cited, discussed, or argued

16

either in this Court or on appeal, namely § 1201(f). The Ninth Circuit addressed this

17

argument and amended the opinion to state explicitly that:
For the first time in its petition for rehearing, MDY raises the
applicability of Section 1201(f) and the question whether
Glider is an “independently created computer program” under
that subsection and thus exempt from the coverage of Section
1201(a). Because this argument was not raised to the district
court or presented in the parties’ briefs on appeal, we decline
to reach it. With this amendment, the plaintiffs-appellants’
petition for panel rehearing is DENIED. No further petition
for rehearing will be entertained. 4

18

Thus, the Ninth Circuit has already made clear that rejecting the § 1201(f)

24

27
28

defense and affirming § 1201(a)(2) liability are entirely consistent. It is MDY’s
4

MDY, 629 F.3d at 954 n. 19. MDY then filed its now-withdrawn petition for
rehearing en banc, in which it argued that the panel opinion wrongly decided that
MDY had waived the 1201(f) issue. (Petition for Rehearing En Banc, Ninth Circuit
Dkt. No. 72; March 3, 2011).

requested relief that is patently inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion. More

2

significantly, the Ninth Circuit’s rejection of MDY’s argument binds this Court as

3

the law of the case. “A trial court may not, however, reconsider a question decided

4

by an appellate court. ‘When matters are decided by an appellate court, its rulings,

5

unless reversed by it or a superior court, bind the lower court.’” United States v.

7

R.R., 329 U.S. 607, 612 (1947). Only the en banc court of the Ninth Circuit had the

8

authority to revisit the panel’s determination of the § 1201(f) issue, which MDY

9

seemingly acknowledged in its subsequently withdrawn petition challenging the

10

panel’s waiver determination. Having withdrawn the petition, the issue is foreclosed.

11

B. MDY Waived the § 1201(f) Defense Even Under its Own Distor ted
View of the Law of the Case.

22

Undeterred by long-standing precedent and unbound by logic, MDY seeks to
avoid the obvious result of the Ninth Circuit’s decision by offering its own bizarre,
and unsupported, construction of the “law of the case” doctrine. Under its novel
theory, MDY posits that it should be permitted to raise an issue now if it “could not
have raised [it] at trial,” and specifically asserts that this Court’s determination of the
copyright issue at summary judgment somehow relieved it of its responsibility to
assert the 1201(f) defense as an alternative basis of relief at trial (despite the appellate
court’s ruling to the contrary). The argument is moot. Even if a hypothetical litigant
could benefit from this dubious proposition, MDY cannot.
MDY had numerous opportunities both before and after this Court held it was a

23

copyright infringer to raise the 1201(f) argument and did not. MDY’s insincerity in

24

contending otherwise is underscored both by the record on appeal—where MDY

25

demonstrated it was well aware it could argue in the alternative for outcomes

26

dependent on reversal of the copyright decision—and worse by MDY’s own

27

admission in the present motion that it neglected to raise the issue at summary

28

judgment, before any determination had been made on the copyright or DMCA

issues.

2

Had § 1201(f) offered MDY a viable defense, it could and should have raised it

3

at each of the following stages of the proceedings. When it did not, it waived the

4

argument.

5

MDY failed to plead 17 U.S.C. § 1201(f) as an affirmative defense. Failure to

6

plead an affirmative defense results in waiver. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (“In responding to

7

a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense”);

8

Enlow v. Salem-Keizer Yellow Cab Co., Inc., 389 F.3d 802, 819 (9th Cir. 2004)

9

(“Failure to plead an affirmative defense therefore results in a waiver of that

10

defense.”) 5

11

thus MDY’s failure to plead it in response to Blizzard’s counterclaims results in

12

waiver. Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc., 381 F.3d 1178, 1204

13

(Fed. Cir. 2004) (“§ 1201(f) is an affirmative defense”); Davidson & Associates v.

14

Jung, 422 F.3d 630, 642 (8th Cir. 2005) (treating § 1201(f) as an affirmative

15

defense).

Courts have uniformly treated § 1201(f) as an affirmative defense, and

16

MDY failed to raise § 1201(f) in its motion for summary judgment or in

17

response to Blizzard’s motion for summary judgment. MDY is correct that “[i]n its

18

motion for summary judgment, MDY did not, and had no obligation to, raise

19

§1201(f).” Although not obligated to raise any issue, MDY is bound by the clearly

20

established consequences of that choice. Failure to raise an argument or affirmative

21

defense on summary judgment results in waiver. See Heffelfinger v. Elec. Data Sys.

Doctors Co., 299 F.Supp.2d 1131, 1154 (D.Haw.2003) (“Failure to raise issues in

5

issue of infringement was open and subject to cross-motions for summary judgment

6

by the parties. If § 1201(f) were a viable issue, it was ripe. MDY waived § 1201(f)

7

by not raising it.

8

MDY failed to offer any evidence at trial on the DMCA claims, even as a

9

proffer, supporting an affirmative defense under § 1201(f). It is black letter law

10

that issues abandoned before the district court are waived. Harik v. Cal. Teachers

11

Ass'n, 326 F.3d 1042, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (issues abandoned before district court are

12

waived and will not be considered on appeal); Pye v. Mitchell, 574 F.2d 476, 480

13

(9th Cir. 1978) (appellate court will not review issues conceded below). MDY’s

14

claim that the determination it was a copyright infringer prior to trial rendered

15

§ 1201(f) irrelevant ignores the record. This Court held on summary judgment that

16

MDY had infringed Blizzard’s copyright by loading its code into RAM in excess of

17

its license. MDY Indus., LLC v. Blizzard Entm't, Inc., CV-06-2555-PHX-DGC, 2008

18

WL 2757357 at *10 (D. Ariz. July 14, 2008). This Court, however, rejected

19

Blizzard’s DMCA claim based on access to the code and reserved for trial the issue

20

of MDY’s liability under 1201(a)(2) as to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements. Id.

21

at *13. Significantly, unlike the Ninth Circuit’s ultimate disposition, this Court

22

required at trial that Blizzard demonstrate access and subsequent copying of those

23

non-literal elements to state a claim under (a)(2) (i.e., the “infringement nexus” under

24

Chamberlain). MDY could have argued in the alternative that if Blizzard could not

25

meet the infringement element, then it was insulated by § 1201(f), to preserve the

26

issue in the event that either this Court or the appellate court ruled that the

27

“infringement nexus” was not required. MDY made no such argument, nor any

28

proffer of evidence to substantiate an “interoperability” or “reverse engineering”

defense. Again, MDY waived § 1201(f).

2

MDY failed to argue a § 1201(f) defense in its opening (or any subsequent)

3

brief on appeal. MDY did not argue that § 1201(f) applied in its opening brief on

4

appeal, which it could have even under its interpretation of the law of the case

5

doctrine, because it asked the Ninth Circuit to overturn this Court’s ruling that it was

6

a copyright infringer. See Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., 244 F.3d 1167, 1182 (9th Cir.

7

2001) (failure to comply with Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9), results in waiver);

8

See Mendoza v. Block, 27 F.3d 1357, 1363 (9th Cir.1994) (failure to raise an issue in

9

an opening brief results in waiver of the issue on appeal). Had it not already waived

10

a potential § 1201(f) defense by failing to raise it in the district court, MDY could

11

have raised it to the Ninth Circuit, because the Ninth Circuit could (and in fact did)

12

reverse this Court’s ruling on copyright infringement. MDY understood that.

13

Indeed, MDY made other “alternative” arguments in its brief dependent on the Ninth

14

Circuit’s rejection of this Court’s copyright ruling, including arguing that “[i]f it is

15

legal to sell Glider under the Copyright Act, then Blizzard shouldn’t be able to urge

16

that selling to any intended user is an act of tortious interference.” (MDY First Br.

17

on Cross App. at 42). The record is clear that MDY recognized, as any appellant

18

would, the obligation to argue the implications of reversal of one claim on other

19

issues in the case. Thus, MDY knowingly waived § 1201(f) by not addressing it in

20

its opening brief.

III.

Section 1201(f) Does Not Excuse MDY’s DMCA Liability
Setting aside the Ninth Circuit’s mandate affirming the judgment and its ruling

23

that MDY waived the § 1201(f) issue, MDY’s thirteenth hour argument that

24

§ 1201(f) provides it safe harbor has no substantive merit. The lack of merit is no

25

doubt reflected in MDY’s rational choice not to assert it among the myriad bases on

26

which it challenged DMCA liability over the course of this litigation. Section

27

1201(f) is inapplicable for at least the following four reasons:

28

MDY contracted away any § 1201(f) rights. Even if § 1201(f) could

1

potentially be relevant under similar factual circumstances, MDY waived its reverse

2

engineering rights pursuant to a valid contract it has not challenged. All versions of

3

the WoW EULA relevant to this case stated that:
Subject to the license granted hereunder, you may not, in
whole or in part, …. reverse engineer … the Game ….Failure
to comply with the restrictions and limitations contained in
this Section [] shall result in the immediate, automatic
termination of the license granted hereunder and may subject
you to civil and/or criminal liability.

(Blizzard Stmt. of Facts in Supp. of Its Mot. for Sum. J., Ex. 22 at 2 (emphasis

9

added); see also Id. Ex. 21 at 3; Ex. 23 at 3). The Eighth Circuit held that a party

10

contracts away its § 1201(f) rights by assenting to a provision containing the exact

11

same language contained in a different Blizzard EULA. Davidson & Assoc. v. Jung,

12

422 F.3d 630, 639 (8th Cir. 2005) (“By signing the TOUs and EULAs, Appellants

13

expressly relinquished their rights to reverse engineer.”); see also Bowers v. Baystate

14

Techs, Inc., 320 F.3d 1317, 1325-26 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“[P]rivate parties are free to

15

contractually forego the limited ability to reverse engineer a software product under

16

the exemptions of the Copyright Act[,]”). Even here the Ninth Circuit held that “the

17

Copyright Act’s preemption clause usually does not affect private contracts.” MDY,

18

629 F.3d at 957. MDY never challenged the enforceability of the EULA below, and

19

in fact, the Ninth Circuit held that “a valid contractual relationship exists between

20

Blizzard and its customers based on the operative EULA and TOU.” MDY, 629 F.3d

21

at 955. Accordingly, MDY in fact waived its § 1201(f) defense by assenting to the

22

WoW EULA. 6

23
24
6

25
26
27
28

Indeed, MDY’s breach of the EULA condition precluding reverse engineering
would plainly constitute copyright infringement under the Ninth Circuit’s copyright
infringement analysis in this very case because the reverse engineering prohibition is
both contained in the EULA’s articulation of express limitations and MDY’s copying
of WoW code in breach of that provision would clearly implicate Blizzard’s
exclusive right to limit reproduction of that code. MDY, 629 F.3d at 937-42. As an
infringer, of course, MDY is not entitled to 1201(f) protection.

Section 1201(f) addresses code interoperability and has no bearing on MDY’s

2

unlawful access to the dynamic non-literal elements. The key term under § 1201(f),

3

“interoperability,” “means the ability of computer programs to exchange information,

4

and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.”

5

17 U.S.C. § 1201(f)(4). The scope of these exemptions is expressly limited to

6

“computer programs” and does not authorize circumvention of access controls that

7

protect other classes of copyrighted works, such as movies. Universal City Studios,

8

Inc. v. Reimerdes, 82 F. Supp. 2d 211, 217-218 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). The Ninth

9

Circuit’s DMCA ruling was based on access to the dynamic, expressive presentation

10

of the non-literal audio-visual work, not the WoW software code or computer

11

program itself (i.e. the literal elements), and thus § 1201(f) is inapplicable.

12

MDY’s 1201(f) argument cannot be squared with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion.

13

Somewhat ironically, it is MDY’s reading of § 1201(f) that is irreconcilable with the

14

Ninth Circuit’s thoughtful discussion of the independent bases for and distinction

15

between §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1). The Ninth Circuit held that (a)(2) “create[s] a

16

distinct anti-circumvention right under § 1201(a) without an infringement nexus

17

requirement.” MDY, 629 F.3d at 952. If the Court were to accept MDY’s conclusory

18

statement that “MDY responded by modifying Glider to avoid detection so that

19

Glider could continue to operate with WoW” as sufficient to establish the (f)(1)

20

defense, the defense would be available to all (a)(2) defendants who were not also

21

copyright infringers and thus (a)(2) and (b)(1) would collapse in the very manner the

22

Ninth Circuit’s holding rejected. (MDY Mot. at 7).

23

MDY never made the requisite showing of necessity. MDY’s breezy assertion

24

that it is “beyond dispute that Glider is independently created software for

25

interoperable use with another software program” notwithstanding, MDY never

26

offered evidence sufficient to meet its burden to establish the 1201(f) affirmative

27

defense (which is not surprising given it never asserted it). Namely, MDY did not

28

demonstrate that its circumvention was “necessary” to reverse engineer the WoW

software for interoperability. On the contrary, the record demonstrates that MDY

2

had unfettered access to WoW code and did not need to circumvent any access

3

control measure to develop the Glider program and ensure its interoperability with

4

the WoW code. 7

Indeed, the Librarian of Congress's rulemaking on Anti-Circumvention makes

6

clear that he believes that interoperability and reverse engineering should not be

7

interpreted as broadly as MDY urges, otherwise it would be unnecessary to

8

specifically exempt (because § 1201(f) would not otherwise protect) “[v]ideo games

9

accessible on personal computers and protected by technological protection measures

10

that control access to lawfully obtained works, when circumvention is accomplished

11

solely for the purpose of good faith testing for, investigating, or correcting security

12

flaws or vulnerabilities” 37 C.F.R. § 201.40(4) (emphasis added). Plainly, Glider

13

was not designed for any of the exempted purposes.

The legislative history MDY cites is relevant to a much narrower point. Rep. Bliley
was addressing playability problems of media such as CDs or DVDs in consumer
products and engaging in circumvention necessary to make older copy-protected
discs playable on new equipment. 144 Cong. Rec. E2138 (daily ed. Oct. 13, 1998)
(statement of Rep. Bliley). In fact, it is unclear whether his remarks refer to
§ 1201(f) or § 1201(c), which directly addresses the “playback” problem. Id.
