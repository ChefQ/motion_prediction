MICHAEL DONNELLY, an individual

20

Third-Party Defendant.

21

The Court must vacate the DMCA section of its permanent injunction. Anything

22
23

less would be inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit’s Opinion.

24

As the Ninth Circuit explained, MDY has never been a copyright infringer.1 This

25
26

newly-minted law of the case means that MDY is once again entitled to safe harbor for its

Case 2:06-cv-02555-DGC Document 157

§1201(a)(2) violation of the DMCA. Under section 1201(f), the DMCA provides safe

2

harbor for a defined subset of §1201(a)(2) violators. Violators who are also copyright

3

infringers are not eligible.2 Because the Court declared MDY a copyright infringer at

4
5
6

summary judgment, the safe harbor could not protect MDY until the Ninth Circuit
reversed.

7

Once the Ninth Circuit changed the law of the case by holding that MDY was

8
9

never a copyright infringer, §1201(f) again offers safe harbor. As described more fully

10

below, safe harbor under §1201(f) applies here because MDY was never a copyright

11

infringer and because MDY’s (a)(2) violation arose from circumvention “for the purpose

12
13

of enabling interoperability” between Glider and World of Warcraft (“WoW”).3 If MDY

14

is not liable under the DMCA despite its (a)(2) violation, the Court must vacate the

15

DMCA section of its permanent injunction.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

19
20

I.

21
22

MDY could not have raised §1201(f) at trial because §1201(f) was not
available as a safe harbor once the Court declared MDY a copyright infringer
at summary judgment.
MDY initiated this suit as a declaratory judgment action to establish that its Glider

23
24

sales do not infringe any of Blizzard’s rights, including any rights under the DMCA.4 In

25

its motion for summary judgment, MDY did not, and had no obligation to, raise §1201(f).

Blizzard could have raised the §1201(f) issue at summary judgment, but it did not.

2

Instead, Blizzard expressly sought summary judgment only on the anti-trafficking

3

portions of the DMCA, specifically §1201(a)(2) and §1201(b)(1).5 The Court granted

4
5
6

partial summary judgment on the §1201(a)(2) and §1201(b)(1) issues, and conducted a
trial on the remaining DMCA issues.6

7
8
9

Because the Court declared MDY a copyright infringer at summary judgment, that
ruling became the law of the case.7 And § 1201(f) precludes a copyright infringer from

10

protection under the §1201(f) safe harbor.8 Thus, MDY could not have raised §1201(f) at

11

trial. As a result, the safe harbor under §1201(f) was not available as a remaining DMCA

12
13

issue at trial.9 And even if MDY could have raised §1201(f) at trial, the Court’s trial

14

decision lost any preclusive effect once the Ninth Circuit vacated it and remanded for

15

“further proceedings consistent with [its] opinion.”10

review of actual trial court rulings.11 Given that neither party raised §1201(f) at summary
judgment, and that MDY could not have raised it at trial, the Ninth Circuit had no
opportunity to review §1201(f) directly. Although MDY urged the Ninth Circuit to reach

4
5

§1201(f) under the doctrine of in pari materia or via the Chamberlain/Lexmark line of

6

cases, the Ninth Circuit declined. Instead, the Ninth Circuit expressly stated that its

7

opinion did not reach the §1201(f) issue because neither party had raised it below.12

8
9

Thus, the Ninth Circuit left §1201(f) for this Court to decide on remand.13

10

Against this procedural backdrop, now is the time for the Court to consider

11

§1201(f). Not only did MDY have no opportunity to assert its protection under §1201(f)

12
13

between summary judgment and the Ninth Circuit reversal, but this Court has yet to

14

consider the applicability of §1201(f). Given the controlling law of this case, the Court

15

can only conclude that MDY has no liability under the DMCA. Even though the Ninth

16

Circuit held that MDY violated §1201(a)(2), something MDY cannot challenge here,

17
18

§1201(f) provides safe harbor for MDY’s §1201(a)(2) violations.

II.

21

When a circumvention device is used to enable interoperability without
copyright infringement, the plain language of § 1201(f) excludes liability
under § 1201(a)(2).

22

Under §1201(f), a person may circumvent a protection measure and distribute the

23

circumvention means if the circumvention’s purpose is to enable an independent software

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may

measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure,

The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1),

“Interoperability” is defined in § 1201(f)(4) as the ability of a computer program to

exchange and use information.

18

Congress spoke directly as to the critical importance of third parties overcoming

19

technological measures that prevent software they create from interoperating with other

20
21

programs without fear of being liable under § 1201(a):
Achieving interoperability in the consumer electronics environment will be
a critical factor in the growth of electronic commerce. Companies are
already designing operating systems and networks that connect devices in
the home and workplace. In the Committee’s view, manufacturers,
consumers, retailers, and professional servicers should not be prevented
from correcting an interoperability problem or other adverse effect resulting

… with our Committee’s encouragement, the conferees explicitly stated
that makers or servicers of consumer electronics, telecommunications, or
computing products who took steps solely to mitigate a playability problem
(whether or not taken in combination with other lawful product
modifications) shall not be deemed to have violated either section 1201(a)
or section 1201(b). Without giving them that absolute assurance, we felt
that the introduction of new products into the market might be stifled, or
that consumers might find it more difficult to get popular legitimate
products repaired.17

Additionally, the Senate Judiciary Committee report on the DMCA explains the

11
12
13

policy underlying Section 1201(f). It states that this exception was “intended to allow
legitimate software developers to continue engaging in certain activities for the purpose

14
15

of achieving interoperability to the extent permitted by law prior to the enactment of this

16

chapter” and that “[t]he purpose of this section is to foster competition and innovation in

17

the computer and software industry.”18

18

Thus, the plain language of the § 1201(f), as well as the congressional intent

19
20

pertaining to the statute, support the conclusion that by circumventing a protection

21

measure to enable two software programs to work together without violating the

22

Copyright Act a person does not violate the DMCA even if the person is liable under §

1201(a).

MDY’s Glider software falls under the § 1201(f) exception.
A violator of §1201(a)(2) must satisfy two elements before the safe harbor of

§1201(f) attaches: (1) the violator cannot infringe any copyrights, and (2) the

4
5

circumvention that gave rise to the (a)(2) violation must have been for the purpose of

6

enabling an independent software program to interoperate with another program. Neither

7

element is open to dispute here.

8

With respect to the first prong, the Ninth Circuit has ruled that MDY’s Glider

9
10
11

software does not infringe or facilitate an infringement of Blizzard’s copyrighted works.19
With respect to the second, it is beyond dispute that Glider is independently created

12
13
14
15
16
17

software for interoperable use with another software program, World of Warcraft
(WoW). In fact the Ninth Circuit recognized that MDY developed Glider for no other
purpose than to interoperate with WoW and that Glider has no commercial use
independent of WoW.20 Indeed, as the Court acknowledged, when Blizzard launched

18

Warden “MDY responded by modifying Glider to avoid detection” so that Gilder could

19

continue to operate with WoW.21 Furthermore, Blizzard never offered, nor can it offer

20
21

any evidence to refute MDY’s sworn statement that it “continuously updates Glider’s

22

ability to avoid detection from Warden only because MDY must maintain Glider’s

23

interoperability with WoW.”22 Hence, MDY’s Glider software falls under the

The Ninth Circuit affirmed that MDY violated §1201(a)(2). Notwithstanding this
violation, this Court must vacate its injunction without further delay because §1201(f)
