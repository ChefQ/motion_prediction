SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF NO
INEQUITABLE CONDUCT
Case No. CV 1:08-cv-00177-BLW

DEFENDANT VOLKSWAGEN’S SUPPLEMENT TO ITS OPPOSITION
TO 55 BRAKE’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF
NO INEQUITABLE CONDUCT - 1

Case 1:08-cv-00177-BLW Document 179

Filed 12/16/10 Page 2 of 7

During the December 8, 2010 hearing on 55 Brake’s motion for summary
judgment of no inequitable conduct, the parties and the Court discussed whether the foreign
patent-office documents that 55 Brake withheld from the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO) could, as matter of law, be material information. Footnote 7 on page 7 of 55
Brake’s reply brief (Doc. 176) suggested this issue for the first time in the briefing. Defendant
Volkswagen Group respectfully submits this supplemental brief to further respond on this issue
and to provide the Court with additional evidence of materiality: a reexamination order and
rejection issued by the United States patent office after the summary judgment hearing, on
December 10, 2010.
Foreign patent-office documents are not as a class and as a matter of law immaterial to
United States prosecution, because a reasonable U.S. examiner might want to consider them
when examining a corresponding U.S. application. See, e.g., Inverness Med. Switzerland GmbH
v. Acon Labs., Inc., 323 F. Supp. 2d 227, 249 (D. Mass. 2004). For example, in the Inverness
case, the court held that a revocation of a European counterpart patent for obviousness under the
European Patent Convention was likely material, stating that “a reasonable patent examiner
would have considered information that a combination of four prior art references invalidated the
patent in Europe.” Id.
The Inverness court reached this conclusion based on the reasoning in Dayco Prods., Inc.
v. Total Containment, Inc., 329 F.3d 1358, 1367–68 (Fed. Cir. 2003), in which the Federal
Circuit held that other patent examiners’ rejections of substantially similar claims are material
information in the inequitable-conduct context. The Federal Circuit reaffirmed that holding in

McKesson Info. Solutions, Inc. v. Bridge Med., Inc., 487 F.3d 897, 919–25 (Fed. Cir. 2007) and
again in Larson Mfg. Co. of S.D., Inc. v. Aluminart Prods. Ltd., 559 F.3d 1317, 1337–39 (Fed.
Cir. 2009).
The Dayco court explained the rationale for its holding this way: “Patent disclosures are
often very complicated, and different examiners with different technical backgrounds and levels
of understanding may often differ when interpreting such documents. Although examiners are
not bound to follow other examiners’ interpretations, knowledge of a potentially different
interpretation is clearly information that an examiner could consider important when examining
an application.” 329 F.3d at 1368. As the Inverness holding confirms, this reasoning applies
equally well to foreign patent documents as to U.S. documents, particularly when, as here, it is
PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) rejections for “lack of novelty” that were withheld, meaning
that all of the elements of the claimed invention were found in a single prior-art document.
(During her deposition, 55 Brake’s patent counsel, asked whether the PCT novelty standard is
“radically different” from the U.S. standard, admitted that “novelty is similar, in my experience,
in many countries.” Doc. 168, Ex. 2 at 129:22–130:8.)
The potential importance of such documents, and the correctness of the Dayco reasoning,
is illustrated by events in this case. As 55 Brake noted in its arguments, the Deitchman prior-art
patent was cited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office early in the prosecution of 55 Brake’s
patent application. However, the U.S. examiner never issued a rejection based on, or any explicit
analysis of, the Deitchman patent. While the original U.S. prosecution proceeded, the European
office issued the search report and rejection that were discussed during last week’s hearing; those

documents did analyze the Deitchman patent, and found that it described all the elements of 55
Brake’s claim 27. As discussed at the hearing, 55 Brake abandoned claim 27 in Europe but
continued to argue for its patentability in the U.S., ultimately obtaining allowance of the ’587
patent without ever disclosing the European examiner’s analysis of the Deitchman patent as it
related to 55 Brake’s claimed invention.
Now, at Volkswagen Group’s request, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is
reexamining the ’587 patent. And on December 10, the PTO ruled that the Deitchman patent
does anticipate 55 Brake’s claims (in particular, issued claims 7, 9, 10, 26, and 40; issued claim 9
corresponds to application claim 27), just as the European examiner had determined (the
December 10 documents are attached as Exs. A and B to this letter; the Deitchman discussion is
on pp. 9–10 of Ex. A and pp. 5–6 of Ex. B). The reexamination examiner noted that while the
Deitchman patent was in the file of the original prosecution, “the relevance of these references to
the patentability of the claims was not discussed” (Ex. A at 10 and Ex. B at 6). Had 55 Brake
disclosed the European documents during the initial prosecution, instead of withholding them,
the relevance of Deitchman might well have been discussed and the asserted claims of the ’587
patent never been issued; the withheld documents were, in this case, highly material.1

The German-language Semmler application was not submitted to the U.S. PTO in
connection with the reexamination, but the European patent documents (which discuss it in
connection with claim 1, which is not asserted in this case) are similarly highly material as they
relate to the Semmler application. As argued in the briefing and at the hearing, the Semmler
application was misleadingly described by 55 Brake to the U.S. examiner during prosecution,
even while 55 Brake withheld the European patent-office documents that analyzed the Semmler
application, like the Deitchman patent, as being “of particular relevance” to the claims (Ex. 6 to
VWGoA’s opposition brief at 55-Brake 001372–73) and as describing all of the elements of 55
Brake’s claim 1 (Ex. 7 to VWGoA’s opposition brief at 55-Brake 006481).
