INTRODUCTION

2

Plaintiff Malibu Media, LLC is one of the most prodigious litigants in the nation, filing over

3

4000 copyright lawsuits in the course of the last few years. Notably – with the limited exception of

4

one instance where Plaintiff was forced to participate in a “bellwether trial”, none of these cases has

5

made it to trial. Perhaps this is not surprising, as Plaintiff’s litigation strategy does not seek a ruling

6

on the merits, but is instead (in the words of a federal judge) “essentially an extortion scheme”

7
8
9

designed to leverage the high cost of federal litigation and the embarrassment associated with adult
films into dubious settlements. See Malibu Media, LLC v. John Does 1-10, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

10

89286 at *9 (C.D. Cal. June 27, 2012). When Plaintiff encounters a determined Defendant, it will

11

seek to escape via the backdoor, in an effort to avoid the statutory costs and attorney fees available

12

to a prevailing defendant in a copyright action. Defendant herein has interposed a counterclaim for

13
14

declaratory relief, seeking to barricade the back door. Plaintiff – perhaps unsurprisingly – now seeks
dismissal of this counterclaim in order to clear a potential escape path. For the reasons set forth

15
16

herein, Defendant respectfully requests that Plaintiff’s Motion to Dismiss be denied.

ARGUMENT

19

Plaintiff’s Motion to Dismiss Defendant’s Counterclaim cites two main rationale for why the

20

Court should dismiss Defendant’s claim for a declaratory judgment, including that failure to do so

21

would “confuse a jury,” and that answering Defendant’s four paragraph counterclaim would create

22
an undue burden on the Plaintiff. Plaintiff goes on to argue that the counterclaim is unnecessary,

23
24

“because the Court will decide the common copyright infringement issue unless the parties settle or

25

Plaintiffs withdraw their complaint.” See ECF No. 16 at 4. This begins to get at the real issue in

26

dispute.

of California and is intimately familiar with their tactics - recently examined and denied a nearly

2

identical Motion to Dismiss Defendant’s Counterclaim. See Malibu Media, LLC v. John Doe

Subscriber Assigned IP Address 76.126.99.126, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80003 (N.D. Cal. June 20,

4

2016). A copy of Judge Alsup’s Order is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. The Northern District agreed

5

with Malibu Media that it had the authority to dismiss the counterclaim if it so chose, but nonetheless

6

denied Plaintiff’s motion. The Court’s rationale was persuasive, and Defendant urges the Court to

adopt it herein. Specifically, Judge Alsup noted that:
“Malibu Media argues that permitting defendant's counterclaim to proceed
would require it to file an answer in which it would deny all the allegations and
refer back to the complaint. This will, however, impose a negligible burden.
Malibu Media also contends the declaratory judgment counterclaim would
confuse a jury. Not really, however, a jury would never need to know that the
case involves an affirmative claim of infringement and a declaratory judgment
counterclaim of non-infringement. The jury could render one verdict resolving
both claims. Malibu Media will suffer no prejudice.
Malibu Media's motion seems more like a gimmick designed to allow it an
easy exit if discovery reveals its claims are meritless. Section 505 of Title 17
of the United States Code provides that a "prevailing party" may be awarded
attorney's fees in a copyright infringement action; however, when a copyright
plaintiff voluntarily dismisses a claim without prejudice, the defendant is not a
prevailing party. Cadkin v. Loose, 569 F.3d 1142, 1150 (9th Cir. 2009). Absent
defendant's counterclaim, if events reveal that this case is meritless, Malibu
Media could voluntarily dismiss its affirmative claims without prejudice under
Rule 41(a)(2), seeking to avoid an award of attorney's fees. If, however,
defendant's counterclaim remains alive, he will be able to press his
counterclaim.
Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. C 15-04441 WHA, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
80003, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal. June 20, 2016).

22

Defendant herein has little to add to Judge Alsup’s observations. Defendant indeed seeks to

23

prevent Malibu Media from seeking an “easy exit” after it has finally determined to its satisfaction

24

that the Defendant is neither liable for infringement, nor likely to pay simply to make this matter go

25

away. Defendant likewise agrees that the purported rationale for Plaintiff’s motion – the prevention

26
of jury confusion – is a feigned concern that is easily remedied by a proper instruction.
