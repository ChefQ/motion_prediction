PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT VIRGINIA COLLEGE, LLC, ITS
PARENT DEFENDANT EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA, AND ITS
AFFILIATE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND FINANCE, LLC'S
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER AND ENTRY
OF A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
COMES NOW PLAINTIFF VC MACON GA, LLC, by and through counsel, and
responds to Defendant Virginia College, LLC, its Parent Defendant Education Corporation of
America, and Its Affiliate New England College of Business And Finance, LLC's Emergency
Motion for the Appointment of A Receiver And Entry of A Temporary Restraining Order And
Preliminary Injunction as follows.
I.

Equity Begets Equity

There are a number of recognized traditional maxims of equity, several of which are
applicable to the case at bar, namely: (1) equity follows the law 1, (2) one who comes into equity
must come with clean hands, (3) one who seeks equity must do equity 2, and (4) equitable
remedies are given as a matter of grace or discretion, not of right. Slater v. U.S. Steel Corp., 820

Also, see, OCGA § 23-1-6 "Equity is ancillary, not antagonistic, to the law; hence, equity follows the law where
the rule of law is applicable and follows the analogy of the law where no rule is directly applicable."
2
Also, see, OCGA § 23-1-10 "He who would have equity must do equity and must give effect to all equitable rights
of the other party respecting the subject matter of the action."

F.3d 1193, 1248 (11th Cir. 2016), reh'g en banc granted, opinion vacated (Aug. 30, 2016), on
reh'g en banc sub nom. Slater v. United States Steel Corp., 871 F.3d 1174 (11th Cir. 2017), citing
1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 2.3(4) n.7 (2d ed.1993) at FN 207.
It is axiomatic that equity demands that "[one] who seeks equity must do equity." Alps S.,
LLC v. Ohio Willow Wood Co., 808CV1893T35MAP, 2013 WL 12164771, at 2 (M.D. Fla.
Mar. 19, 2013). A diligent creditor shall not needlessly be interfered with in the prosecution of
his legal remedies. O.C.G.A. § 23-1-22.
In the present action, Plaintiff is the landlord of the current Virginia College location in
Macon, Georgia. Additionally, the principals of Plaintiff are also the principals of the owner of
the property currently housing the Virginia College location in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Neither
Plaintiff nor its principals are large national real estate holding companies. Instead the principals
are 2 individuals from Mississippi who are themselves indebted to lenders in reliance upon the
representations made by Defendants as an inducement to enter leases in Macon, Georgia and
Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Should Plaintiff and its counterpart in Baton Rouge not be promptly
made whole by Defendants, it is very likely that their next stop is bankruptcy court.
Defendants' motion is grounded in equity. In a highly unusual move, Defendants seek the
appointment of a Receiver to preside over Defendants' own affairs. Defendants essentially admit
they are incapable of managing their affairs and paying their debts as they come due. Plaintiff
suggests that Defendants' current financial difficulties are self-inflicted. Plaintiff directs the
Court's attention to Docket # 19-2 (the "Puffer Decl.") in the Northern District of Alabama,
CAFN 18-cv-01698-AKK styled Education Corporation of America, et al. v. U.S. Department of
Education (the "Alabama action"). In ¶¶13-14 and Exhs. D-E of the Puffer Decl., the declarant
shows that Defendants "have sufficient available cash, budgeted for that purpose, to make these

{00166613 1 }

-2-

Case 5:18-cv-00388-TES Document 20 Filed 11/13/18 Page 3 of 10

[lease] payments." Also, see, p. 22 of the Puffer Decl. where Defendants acknowledge cash on
hand in the amount of $17,722,107.63 as of October 15, 2018. In other words, Defendants
intentionally withheld lease payments to Plaintiff, which Plaintiff suggests is a strategy or tactic
to extract concessions. See, p. 15 of Docket # 19-1 (the "Swartzwelder email") in the Alabama
action, where Swartzwelder 3 admits "One aspect of this strategy has been to delay certain rent
payments while we continue our negotiations [with landlords]." The fact that Defendants failed
to pay rent when money was available coupled with the fact that Defendants intentionally
withheld payment was a strategy to pressure Plaintiff suggests unclean hands on the part of
Defendants.
Moreover, for unexplained reasons there is evidence indicating that cash on hand
belonging to Defendant Virginia College is actually held by Monroe Capital, who according to
Defendants is part of the aggregation of lenders who will bid for the assets of ECA as the
"Stalking Horse" once a Receiver is appointed. See, p. 9 of Docket # 2 of the Alabama action
(the "Alabama Emergency Motion"). Also, See, p. 22 of the Puffer Decl. where Defendants
acknowledge cash on hand in the amount of $17,722,107.63 as of October 15, 2018. These facts
inexorably give rise to alter ego questions. Money belonging to Virginia College, and by
extension owed to Plaintiff, is in the possession of a party who ultimately may be part of the
purchasing group after debts and obligations have been wiped away. Defendants need to clean
their hands as part of and as a condition to their request for relief from this Court.
II.

Plaintiff's Support is Conditioned

Nevertheless, as mentioned during the TRO hearing on November 6, 2018 Plaintiff
supports Defendants' request for appointment of a Receiver upon several conditions outlined
below.

Roger L. Swartzwelder is the EVP, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for ECA.

a.

Approval of Restructuring Plan
To date Plaintiff has seen no Restructuring Plan. Plaintiff cannot agree to

any plan sight unseen.
b.

Plaintiff Cannot Be Afforded Lesser Rights Than Under Bankruptcy
As the Court has astutely observed, Defendants are effectively debtors-in-

possession and seek bankruptcy protection without actually filing a bankruptcy petition.
In other words, they want the benefits of bankruptcy without the burden. Plaintiff cannot
agree to such a one-sided result. In fact, in some respects Plaintiff would be better off in
bankruptcy. For example, the enforcement of post-petition claims or the enforcement of
claims through an adversary proceeding. A trustee or debtor-in-possession ("DIP") has
the authority under Section 365, in the exercise of business judgment and subject to court
approval, to assume or reject an executory contract or unexpired lease (except as
provided in Sections 765 and 766). An executory contract or lease must be assumed or
rejected in its entirety. In order to assume an executory contract, the DIP must provide
adequate assurance (as set forth in Section 365(f)(2)) of future performance whether or
not there has been a default in the debtor’s performance of the executory contract or
lease. Any party to the contract or lease can seek relief from the court to compel the DIP
or the trustee to assume or reject the contract or lease.
If there has been a default in the trustee’s or DIP’s performance of an executory
contract or lease, the trustee or DIP may only assume the executory contract or unexpired
lease under Section 356(b)(1) if the trustee or DIP: (a) with certain exceptions noted
below, cures or provides adequate assurance of prompt cure of the default; (b)
compensates the other party for any actual pecuniary loss resulting from such default; and

{00166613 1 }

-4-

Case 5:18-cv-00388-TES Document 20 Filed 11/13/18 Page 5 of 10

(c) provides adequate assurance of future performance under the contract or lease. There
is no requirement to cure a default or provide adequate assurance of cure with regard to:
(1)

Any default involving breach of a provision relating to the insolvency or

financial condition of the debtor before the commencement or closing of the case or any
provision relating to the appointment of a trustee or custodian; 4 or
(2)

Payment of any penalty rate provided for under the lease or satisfaction of

any provision relating to a default arising from any failure of the debtor to perform nonmonetary obligations under the executory contract or unexpired lease, if the default is
impossible for the trustee or DIP to cure upon assumption of the lease. However, if the
default involves failure to operate on the leased premises in accordance with the lease,
the default must be cured upon assumption and the trustee or DIP must compensate the
other party to the lease for its actual pecuniary loss. 5
In the present action Defendants are essentially asking this Court to ignore these
provisions by not requiring Defendants to bring current any past due balance. Likewise,
Defendants are asking this Court to allow them to unilaterally terminate its leases with Plaintiff
without regard to the impact upon Plaintiff. Furthermore, Defendants are asking this Court to
allow them to remain in possession, but without any recourse in favor of Plaintiff in the event of
an occurrence giving rise to liability. For example, if Defendants allowed hazardous materials
on-site or if Defendants failed to pay ad valorem taxes or maintain the property. In other words,
Defendants are requesting the Court to modify or substitute terms of the leases that would
effectively allow Defendants to affirm and at the same time reject the leases on a schedule that is

11 U.S.C. §§ 365(b)(2)(A)-(C).
11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(2)(D).

{00166613 1 }

Case 5:18-cv-00388-TES Document 20 Filed 11/13/18 Page 6 of 10

convenient only to Defendants and without being required to surrender possession of the
premises as required under 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(4). Plaintiff cannot agree with this result.
However, Plaintiff can agree to a condition that requires Defendants to immediately
affirm the leases with the contemporaneous requirement that all past due amounts immediately
be brought current. Plaintiff also requests that it be allowed to enforce the terms and conditions
of the lease through litigation, if necessary.
c.

Plaintiff Must Be Afforded a Commercially Reasonable Buyout

11 U.S.C.A. § 502 provides in part: …
(b) Except as provided in subsections (e)(2), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this section, if
such objection to a claim is made, the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine
the amount of such claim in lawful currency of the United States as of the date of the
filing of the petition, and shall allow such claim in such amount, except to the extent that-…
(6) if such claim is the claim of a lessor for damages resulting from the
termination of a lease of real property, such claim exceeds—
(A) the rent reserved by such lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one
year, or 15 percent, not to exceed three years, of the remaining term of such lease,
following the earlier of-(i) the date of the filing of the petition; and
(ii) the date on which such lessor repossessed, or the lessee surrendered, the
leased property; plus
(B) any unpaid rent due under such lease, without acceleration, on the earlier of
such dates;….
The schools in Macon and Baton Rouge are "Teach Out" schools. This means
Defendants intend to close these schools and simply return the keys at a time unilaterally
chosen by Defendants and, of course, in a manner and schedule that is inconsistent with
the terms of the leases. Plaintiff has been informed the closing will occur sometime in
2019, most likely in late Spring. Unlike the "Go Forward" schools, Plaintiff and its

{00166613 1 }

-6-

Case 5:18-cv-00388-TES Document 20 Filed 11/13/18 Page 7 of 10

principals face the task and expenses of re-letting and incurring unplanned if not
substantial build-out to reconfigure the Macon and Baton Rouge properties.
It is customary in a commercial lease setting when a tenant wishes an early
termination for the tenant to negotiate and pay an early termination or buy-out fee among
other possible things. The expiration date for both leases involved in this action is
December 31, 2015; however, Defendants have offered no early termination fee.
Moreover, the date that Defendants plan to vacate the Macon and Baton Rouge locations
is undetermined. Plaintiff and its principals have been informed it could be anywhere
between late Spring and mid-Autumn 2019. At best, there would still be 5 years
remaining under the leases for which Defendants intend to simply avoid. As the Court is
aware, Defendants believe they will be profitable as early as January 2019. Additionally,
the Court is also aware that Defendants intend to sell the Go Forward schools debt-free as
part of the Restructuring Plan. The unfairness and inequity is indisputable.
Plaintiff can agree to and hereby requests a condition that requires Defendants to
pay an early termination fee equal to the greater of one (1) year from the date of the
Order appointing the Receiver or six (6) month from the date Defendants vacate the
premises.
d.

Plaintiff Should Be Awarded Attorney's Fees as a Condition

Finally, Plaintiff should be awarded attorney's fees as a condition for appointment
of the Receiver for 2 reasons. First, Defendants have not acted in good faith. Defendants
want to cram down concessions it could not obtain through negotiation. Defendants
offered a take it or leave it proposal that was not commercially reasonable. See, p. 91,

{00166613 1 }

Docket # 1-1. Second, the leases provide for the recovery of attorney's fees. See, ¶24(e),
p. 41 and ¶24(e), p. 72, Docket # 1-1.
