Crim. No. 05-40026-FDS

GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR COMPLEX CASE DESIGNATION
The United States, by and through Michael J. Sullivan, and
Michael D. Ricciuti and B. Stephanie Siegmann, Assistant United
States Attorneys for the District of Massachusetts, hereby moves
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(8)(B)(ii) that this Court
designate this case as complex for purposes of the Speedy Trial
Act, and find that it is unreasonable to expect adequate
preparation for pretrial proceedings and for the trial itself
with the time limits established by 18 U.S.C. §3161.
Additionally, the government requests that the time period for
automatic discovery be extended from 28 days to a period of 60
days from the date of arraignment.

In support of this motion,

the government states the following:
1.

The Indictment, filed on May 11, 2005, charges the

defendants with engaging in a scheme to conceal material
information, and conspiring with themselves and other unindicted
co-conspirators to defraud the government, over a ten-year period
of time;
2.

Discovery will entail making historical documents as

well as declassified information available to the defense.
Additionally, the government has obtained, and expects to obtain,
evidence from other districts, for review for purposes of
discovery;
3.

Two separate searches of the records of Care

International, Inc., were conducted in 2001 and 2003.

Thousands

of pages of documents and other materials were seized during both
of these searches, which the government expects to make available
to the defendants’ counsel during discovery;
4.

The government anticipates discovery in this case may

implicate classified information, which must be handled pursuant
to the Classified Information Procedures Act.

Accordingly, the

government will request security clearances for counsel for the
defendants.

The government may also seek to have further

information declassified for use in the prosecution of this case;
5.

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(8)(B)(ii), this case is

so complex given the nature of the prosecution and the types of
materials that may have to be reviewed and/or made available in
discovery, that is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation
for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within the time
limits established by the Speedy Trial Act;
6.

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(8)(A), the ends of

justice served by not fixing a trial date within the time limits
established by the Speedy Trial Act outweigh the best interest of
the defendants and the public in a speedy trial.

the period by which the government must produce automatic
discovery to 60 days from the date of arraignment of the
defendants.
