MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF THE A IM DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS

Defendants, A I M Investments, Ltd.,! A IM Advisors, Inc., A 1M Capital Management,
Inc., INVESCO Institutional (N.A.), Inc., Mark H. Williamson and Robert H. Graham, submit
this Memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss the Complaint in this action.

I. INTRODUCTION

The claims in this case are as meritless as they are simple. Defendants A I M Advisors,
Inc., A I M Capital Management, Inc. and INVESCO Institutional (N.A.), Inc., (collectively "the
Adviser Defendants") are investment advisers alleged to be responsible for the management of
the A IM group of approximately 70 mutual funds known as the A I M Funds. Defendants
Williamson and Graham are trustees of the A I M Funds." For simplicity, these defendants are
collectively referred to as the "A I M Defendants." The Adviser Defendants are responsible for

management of the A I M group of mutual funds (the "A I M Funds"). (Compl. ff 11, 13).

 

' "A IM Investments, Ltd." is a non-existent entity and is thus not subject to suit.

2 say
Messrs. Williamson and Graham are referred to as "Interested Trustees" because they are officers of one or

more of the Adviser Defendants. The trustees who are "not interested" or independent are separately represented
and are simultaneously moving to dismiss.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF THE A IM DEFENDANTS'MOTION TO DISMISS -- Page 1
DC-708736 v5
Case 3:05-cv-00073-P Document 17 Filed 05/18/05 Page6of16 PagelD 101

The Plaintiffs are two individuals who each claim to have "owned one of the Funds" --
although they never hint at which Fund either owns. (Compl. { 10). Plaintiffs allege that they
have been damaged because the Adviser Defendants failed to cause certain -- again unspecified
-- AIM Funds to participate in the distributions from settlement funds created in class actions
involving securities of publicly-traded companies. The complaint lists over 130 class action
settlements, but makes no effort to identify which A I M Fund should have participated in which
settlement.

Plaintiffs allege five causes of action, purportedly on behalf of a class composed of all
shareholders of all A I M Funds. Three claims are based on federal law: Sections 36(a), 36(b),
and 47(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("ICA"), respectively. The other two claims
are for breach of fiduciary duty (Count I) and negligence (Count II) under state common law.

The Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety for the following reasons:

(1) The Complaint fails to establish that Plaintiffs have standing. Plaintiffs allege
that they each own shares in only one unidentified A I M Fund but there is no allegation that
these Funds or, indeed, any group of Funds, were eligible to participate in the settlements and
failed to do so. Any injury to Plaintiffs is therefore purely speculative and will not support
standing under Article III.

(2) Assuming that Plaintiffs may have standing to bring any claims relating to any
one Fund, the claims they have asserted are entirely derivative; that is, they are asserted for
injuries to the Funds. Therefore, except for Count IV, the claim under ICA Section 36(b), they
must be dismissed for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1 and applicable state law
governing derivative claims, which require, among other things, that plaintiff make demand on

the board of trustees or plead the reasons for failure to make such a demand.
Case 3:05-cv-00073-P Document17 Filed 05/18/05 Page7of16 PagelD 102

(3) The Count III claim under ICA Section 36(a) fails to state a claim in that there is
no express or implied private right of action under that section.

(4) The Count IV claim under ICA Section 36(b) fails to state a claim. Federal courts
uniformly hold that Section 36(b) is limited to a particular issue -- excessive advisory fees. This
issue is completely absent from the complaint, which makes no mention of fees at all.

(5) The Count V claim under ICA Section 47(b), which allows derivative claims for
rescission of contracts that violate the ICA, fails because it does not allege that the making or
performance of the Funds' investment advisory contracts involved a violation of any provision of
the ICA and because Plaintiffs lack standing.

Il. ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT

Plaintiffs' injuries and the conduct allegedly causing those injuries are alleged only in
broad and conclusory terms. Plaintiffs allege that all Defendants acted improperly when they
"failed to ensure that the Funds participated in (or opted out of)" more than 100 class action
settlements. (Compl. 75.) "If the Defendants had submitted Proof of Claim forms on behalf of
the Funds in these cases .. ., the settlement funds would have increased the total assets held by
the Funds, and such increase would have been allocated immediately to the then-current
investors[.]" (Compl. 925.) Plaintiffs allege that A I M Funds were eligible to participate in
such settlements, although Plaintiffs fail to identify the Funds or settlements. Plaintiffs
nonetheless purport to advance claims on behalf of "all persons who owned one of the Funds at
any time between January 10, 2000 through January 10, 2005 and who suffered damages
thereby." (Compl. J 6.) Although Plaintiffs also allege only that they each "owned one of the
Funds" (Compl. 4 10.), they claim they may sue on behalf of shareholders in all A I M Funds
because the Funds are managed by the same Advisers and have the same directors, similar

contracts and allegedly follow the "same policy and custom."

II. ARGUMENT
A. Plaintiffs Lack Standing To Assert Claims.

The allegations make it clear that any injury to Plaintiffs is entirely speculative. Plaintiffs
make no claim to own shares of any identified fund that was eligible to participate in any of the
listed class actions. They do not even allege that any identified A I M Fund owned any of the
securities involved in these settled lawsuits. To have standing to sue in federal court, a plaintiff
must allege that he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is "concrete and particularized" and
not "conjectural or hypothetical." Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint simply fails to allege any
"particularized" injury. Indeed it is so vague as to the Plaintiffs' ownership of shares in a Fund
and that Fund's eligibility to participate that it does not present an actual controversy. In order to
satisfy Article III's "case or controversy" requirements, a party invoking the court's authority
must "show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the
putatively illegal conduct of the defendant ...." Franchise Tax Bd. of California v. Alcan
Aluminum Ltd., 493 U.S. 331, 335 (1990) (quoting Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans
United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 US. 464, 472 (1982) (internal quotation
marks, citations omitted)).

Plaintiffs make no concrete or particularized claim of injury here. Instead they speculate
that because a number of A I M Funds would appear to be eligible to invest in securities that are
the subject of the listed class actions, the Funds "had valid claims in many if not all" of the class
actions, and failed to file proofs of claims. (Complaint 0x00A7 24). Plaintiffs essentially admit their
injury is speculative: All of these allegations are made on "information and belief." Speculation
is not enough. Indeed, it is not enough for a plaintiff to allege that it is likely or even statistically

probable that he or she is with the class eligible to bring suit. See Krim v. PC Order, 402 F.3d
Case 3:05-cv-00073-P Document 17 Filed 05/18/05 Page9of16 PagelD 104

489, 497 (Sth Cir. 2005) (holding that a high statistical probability that plaintiff purchased shares
covered by registration statement was not sufficient to create standing under Section 11 of the
Securities Act). The Complaint should therefore be dismissed in its entirety.

B. Plaintiffs' Claims Are Derivative And Must Be Dismissed for Failure To
Comply With Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1.

The claims in Counts I, II, If, and V must be dismissed because they are derivative
claims -- claims for injury to the Funds that belong to the Funds, not direct claims that may be
asserted by shareholders in class actions -- and Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the demand
requirement in such cases. The derivative nature of the claims is plain from the face of the
Complaint. Plaintiffs claim that the assets of the Funds were diminished because the Defendants
did not participate in certain class action settlements. (Complaint 0x00A7 25.) Thus, the alleged harm
is an injury to the Funds. Such quintessentially derivative claims belong to the Fund, not its
individual shareholders. Plaintiffs may not pursue such relief on behalf of a Fund unless they
first make demand on its board, or allege valid reasons for not doing so.

1. Plaintiffs' Claims Are Derivative

The question of whether a plaintiff's claims involving a registered investment company
are direct or derivative is governed by the law of the state in which the relevant business entity
was organized. Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 108-09 (1991); Lapidus
v. Hecht, 232 F.3d 679, 682 (9" Cir. 2000). The A I M Funds are organized as Delaware
statutory trusts. Accordingly, Delaware law governs.'

To determine under Delaware law whether a cause of action is derivative or direct, the

Court must evaluate the nature of the wrong alleged and the relief that Plaintiffs would be

 

3 A court may take judicial notice of information in publicly available filings, like fund annual reports filed

with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See www.sec.gov.
Case 3:05-cv-00073-P Document 17 Filed 05/18/05 Page10of16 PagelD 105

entitled to if they prevailed. See Kramer v. Western Pacific Industries Inc., 546 A.2d 348, 352
(Del. 1988). The Delaware Supreme Court has recently confirmed that to be direct "[t]he
stockholder's claimed direct injury must be independent of any alleged injury to the
corporation." Tooley v. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., 845 A.2d 1031, 1039 (Del. 2004).
See Smith v. Waste Management, Inc., No. 04-20380, 2005 WL 873329, at *3 (5 Cir. April 15,
2005) (citing Tooley). A claim is derivative unless plaintiff can "demonstrate . . . that he or she
can prevail without showing an injury to the corporation." Jd.

Here there is no question that any injury alleged in the Complaint is an injury to an entity
-- a Fund that did not receive a distribution in a class action settlement. According to the
allegations in the Complaint, the A I M Funds owned the securities; and subject to the class
action settlements, the A I M Funds had the right to participate and the Funds' assets were
diminished in the event that a claim was not filed. (Complaint 7 25.) Indeed, it is difficult to
imagine a clearer example of a claim that belongs to an entity and that a shareholder may only
pursue through a derivative claim on behalf of that entity.*

2. Plaintiffs Have Failed to Comply with Rule 23.1

Delaware law requires that prior to bringing a derivative claim on behalf of an entity, the
shareholder must first make a demand on the board to take action." See, e.g., Tooley v.

Donaldson, 845 A.2d 1031, 1036 (Del. 2004); Beam v. Stewart, 845 A.2d 1040, 1048 (Del.

 

` With respect to the claim under section 47 of the ICA, in which plaintiffs seek to have the Funds'

investment contracts rescinded, the statutory text itself makes plain that plaintiffs' only cause of action (if any) is
derivative. See Lessler v. Little, 857 F.2d 866, 874 (1* Cir. 1988) ((["Plaintiff| appears to have overlooked the plain
language of the very statutory section he invokes. Section 47(b)(1) declares that contracts entered into in violation
of the other provisions of the Investment Company Act are `unenforceable by either party." 15 U.S.C. 0x00A7 80a-
46(b)(1). [Plaintiff] is not a party to the Narragansett-Monarch contract, nor does his complaint assert a derivative
action on behalf of Narragansett, which is a party. [Plaintiff] proceeds solely on his own behalf as a shareholder and
on behalf of others similarly situated. As our previous decisions have made clear, a shareholder such as [plaintiff]
lacks standing to pursue on his own claims properly belonging to the corporation.").

0x00B0 The requirements for maintaining a derivative action on behalf of a Delaware statutory trust are essentially

the same as those for maintaining a derivative claim on behalf of a corporation. Compare Del. Code. Ann. tit 12
0x00A73816 and Del. Ch. Rule 23.1.
