1

I.

THE COURT MAY TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE OF DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED
BY REFERENCE IN THE PLEADING (CATEGORIES 1-2)

2
3

Where a document is incorporated by reference in a complaint, but is not physically attached,

4

the entire document may be considered by the court if it is central to the claim and no party questions

5

its authenticity. See Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 2006); In re Silicon Graphics Inc.

6

Securities Litigation, 183 F.3d 970, 986 (9th Cir. 1999) (“[the incorporation by reference doctrine]

7

permits a district court to consider documents ‘whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose

8

authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the [plaintiff's] pleading,’”

9

quoting Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994)); In re CNET Networks, Inc., 483 F.

10

Supp. 2d 947, 953-954 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (“documents referenced in [] complaint … are the proper

11

subjects of judicial notice”); In re Cornerstone Propane Partners, L.P., 355 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1076-

12

1077 (N.D. Cal. 2005).
Categories 1-2 above seek judicial notice of documents and information referenced in Psystar’s

13
14

counterclaims and are central to the claims asserted by Psystar. True and correct copies of the

15

documents and information are attached (or submitted manually in the case of Exhibit B) for the

16

Court’s review and judicial notice.

17

II.

THE COURT MAY TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE OF NEWS ARTICLES REPORTING
FACTS GENERALLY KNOWN (CATEGORIES 3-5)

18
19

Courts may take judicial notice of newspaper articles demonstrating that certain facts are

20

generally known. See, e.g., Washington Post v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 282, 291-292 (D.C. Cir. 1991)

21

(holding that under Rule 201, facts were generally known as a result of news articles). Moreover,

22

because numerous market studies cited in news articles have reported Apple’s general market share

23

figures, Apple’s market share in personal computer market is capable of accurate and ready

24

determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. See Fed. R.

25

Evid. 201; Ritter v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 58 F.3d 454, 458-459 (9th Cir. 1995) (district court did not

26

abuse its discretion by taking judicial notice of facts generally known and reported in newspaper

27

articles or “capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot

28

reasonably be questioned”); County of Santa Clara v. Astra USA, Inc., 2006 WL 1344572, 2 (N.D.
APPLE INC’S REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE IN SUPPORT OF APPLE INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS PSYSTAR’S
COUNTERCLAIMS, Case No. CV 08-03251 WHA

2

1

Cal. 2006) (finding that “[j]udicial notice of news articles from The Wall Street Journal and the

2

Associated Press is proper when the matter of which “notice is taken is ‘capable of accurate and ready

3

determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.’”); Plevy v.

4

Haggerty, 38 F. Supp. 2d 816, 820-821 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (taking judicial notice of press releases and

5

news articles where the contents of the press releases and news articles were “capable of accurate and

6

ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned”).

7

Categories 3-5 above seek judicial notice of news articles from The New York Times and The

8

Wall Street Journal generally discussing Apple’s market share in the personal computer market.

9

Apple’s market share is capable of accurate and ready determination and has been reported in

10

numerous news articles. True and correct copies of two articles found in The New York Times and one

11

article found in The Wall Street Journal are attached for the Court’s review and judicial notice.
