PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR RULE 11 SANCTIONS
Plaintiff Marc Carter respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the Motion
for Rule 11 Sanctions filed by Defendant CBE Group, Inc. (“CBE” or “Defendant”). (Doc. No.
16).
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Marc Carter does not owe Defendant a penny. His misfortune here is his last name -- 46th
most common in the United States -- which he shares with 362,548 Americans.1 In his
Complaint, Marc Carter seeks redress for Defendant’s violations of Sections 1692d and 1692f of
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), and a similar Texas state law, arising from
repeated debt collection calls Defendant made to him at his home in Texas after he informed
Defendant that it had the wrong number and that the calls should stop. (Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 6-12).
After Plaintiff served his complaint, Defendant acknowledged that it made 41 calls to
Plaintiff after he first instructed Defendant to stop the calls. At the same time, Defendant argued
that the lawsuit was “baseless” and the calls should be excused, out of hand, because Defendant
kept calling Plaintiff having associated his number with a series of four different debtors with the

last name Carter. Thus, the theory goes, Defendant should be left scot-free to harass Marc Carter
or anyone similarly named, so long as it continues to do so for some other account belonging to
one of the 362,548 some odd Carters.
Defendant misconstrues the procedural application of Rule 11. In the Fifth Circuit, a
district court must apply the “snapshot” rule: sanctions under Rule 11 may not be imposed
“merely for the eventual failure of a claim; rather, sanctions are to be applied only where, at the
time of the filing, the position advocated is unwarranted.” Matta v. May, 118 F.3d 410, 415 (5th
Cir. 1997) (emphasis added); see also F.D.I.C. v. Calhoun, 34 F.3d 1291, 1300 (5th Cir. 1994)
(“Our precedent does not allow the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions merely for the eventual
failure of factual and legal arguments ... sanctions are to be applied where, at the time of the
filing, such arguments were unwarranted.”). Rejecting this binding precedent, Defendant argues
for sanctions here based on submissions it made to Plaintiff after service of the Complaint was
made. Under the snapshot rule, those submissions are not to be considered in determining
whether the Complaint has a reasonable basis in fact and law. Nevertheless, as set forth herein,
Plaintiff’s Complaint is sound and stands muster even in the face of Defendant’s submissions
regarding the call history to Plaintiff’s phone number. There is legitimate legal support for
Plaintiff’s claims, even if they are based on mistaken identity and Defendant errantly having his
phone number associated with four other people named Carter.
Here, contrary to Defendant’s arguments, the legislative history of the FDCPA and case
law support Plaintiff’s claims, even if Defendant made the calls because of mistaken identity, as
it argues. To this end, the legislative history of the FDCPA supports Plaintiff’s position that his
FDCPA claims may be based on repeated calls made to him that were intended for other people
with the last name Carter:

This bill also protects people who do not owe money at all. In the
collector's zeal, collection efforts are often aimed at the wrong
person either because of mistaken identity or mistaken facts. This
bill will make collectors behave responsibly towards people with
whom they deal . . . Certainly a person who has a common name
and is being hounded by a debt collector because of the debts of
another person deserves the protection this legislation will offer.
In far too many cases debt collectors do not even bother to double
check common names before beginning collection efforts.
H.R. Rep. 95–131, at 8 (1977)
Similarly, in Kerwin v. Remittance Assistance Corp., 559 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (D. Nev.
2008), the plaintiffs’ claims under Section 1692d of the FDCPA withstood the defendant’s
summary judgment motion where the defendant’s phone calls were made due to mistaken
identity on three different accounts with similar names to each other; but none of which were
accounts for the plaintiffs. The first account was for a person named “Sharon Coldwell.” After
the plaintiffs informed the defendant that it dialed the wrong number and to stop calling, the
defendant then called for a person named “Greg Coldwell.” Again, the plaintiffs informed the
defendant it had the wrong number and to stop calling. Thereafter, the defendant called the
plaintiffs for a person named “Greg Colwell.” Id. at 1120-21. The defendant proffered the
excuse that because its automated dialing software could not sort by phone number, it could not
remove the plaintiffs’ phone number from its system except in an account-by-account fashion.
Removing the plaintiffs’ phone number from one account did not affect other accounts with the
same phone number. Id. at 1121. On these facts, the Kerwin court found that under Section
1692d(5) of the FDCPA, there was a genuine issue as to whether the defendant’s repeated phone
calls constituted intentional abuse. Id. at 1124.
Significantly, the defendant made only a handful of phone calls to the plaintiffs in
Kerwin. In contrast, here Defendant made 41 calls to Plaintiff after he first informed Defendant

3

Case 4:13-cv-02083 Document 17 Filed in TXSD on 12/31/13 Page 4 of 12

that it had the wrong number. Accordingly, contrary to Defendant’s argument, the number and
nature of its phone calls to Plaintiff here do not render Plaintiff’s FDCPA claims groundless and
sanctionable.
ARGUMENT
I.

The Standard for Determining a Rule 11 Motion

Rule 11 sets forth, in pertinent part:
(b) REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT. By presenting to the court a
pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing,
filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or
unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable under the circumstances:
(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as
to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the
cost of litigation;
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are
warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for
extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for
establishing new law;
(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support
after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or
discovery; and
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the
evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based
on belief or a lack of information.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1)-(4).
The purpose of Rule 11 is to “deter baseless filings in district court.” Cooter & Gell v.
Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 393, 110 S. Ct. 2447, 110 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1990). “With respect to
a legal contention, an argument is not frivolous if the claims, defenses, and other legal
contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,
4

Case 4:13-cv-02083 Document 17 Filed in TXSD on 12/31/13 Page 5 of 12

modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.” Downstream Envtl.,
L.L.C. v. Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Auth., 2006 WL 3246348, at *1 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 7, 2006)
(citing Rule 11(b)(2)). Here, Plaintiff’s legal contentions are warranted by existing law; as they
are grounded both in the legislative history of the FDCPA and applicable case law. (See pp. 1-2,
supra).
The Fifth Circuit has adopted the “snapshot” rule. “Rule 11 liability is assessed only for
a violation existing at the moment of filing.” Marlin v. Moody Nat'l Bank, N.A., 533 F.3d 374,
380 (5th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added). “Rule 11 does not impose a continuing obligation on
attorneys, only a standard of good faith and reasonable investigation as of the date the legal
documents are signed.” Thomas v. Capital Sec. Servs., Inc., 836 F.2d 866, 884 (5th Cir. 1988)
(en banc). See also Connect Insured Tel., Inc. v. Qwest Long Distance, Inc., 2012 WL 3150957,
at *3 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 3, 2012) (Any facts that the party learned after it made the filing that
triggered the Rule 11 motion “could not affect the merits of the motion.”) (citing Marlin, supra,
and Thomas, supra).
In the instant case, Defendant completely ignores the “snapshot” rule in contending that
the Complaint is now sanctionable because of the call records it produced after service of the
Complaint. To wit, the Fifth Circuit in Skidmore Energy, Inc. v. KPMG, 455 F.3d 564 (5th Cir.
2006), set forth as follows:
Prior to the Thomas “snapshot” rule, attorneys in this Circuit had a
continuing obligation to review and reevaluate their positions as
the litigation developed; a document that initially satisfied Rule 11
might later become the basis for sanctions if new facts were
discovered or circumstances changed such that there was no longer
a good faith basis for the earlier filing. Thomas’s “snapshot” rule
ensures that Rule 11 liability is assessed only for a violation
existing at the moment of filing.
Id. at 570 (citation, internal quotations and footnote omitted).

II.

The FDCPA Protects Non-Debtors from Calls Based upon Mistaken Identity

Defendant argues that the Complaint is baseless and sanctionable because Defendant
called Plaintiff, in succession, on four different accounts with the last name Carter, none of
which were for Plaintiff, and stopped making calls on each account once Plaintiff informed
Defendant that the phone number was incorrect. While this argument should be dismissed out of
hand because of the “snapshot” rule, Plaintiff’s claims are still grounded in existing law, and thus
not sanctionable, even in light of the self-defeating call records and attempted excuse Defendant
has submitted.
As discussed above, Congress, in enacting the FDCPA, specifically intended to curb the
type of phone calls Defendant made here that are “aimed at the wrong person either because of
mistaken identity or mistaken facts” and/or “a person who has a common name and is being
hounded by a debt collector because of the debts of another person.” (See pp. 2-3, supra).
Plaintiff’s Complaint also finds support in Kirwin, 559 F.Supp.2d at 1124 (a genuine issue of
material fact existed with respect to claimed violation of Section 1692d of the FDCPA where
debt collector continued to call plaintiff, in succession, on three different accounts with names
similar to each other after the plaintiff informed Defendant it had the wrong number). (See p. 3,
supra, for further factual discussion of Kirwin).
Plaintiff’s claims under the FDCPA are further supported by the remedial nature of the
Act. See Hamilton v. United Healthcare of La., 310 F.3d 385, 392 (5th Cir. 2002) “Congress ...
has legislatively expressed a strong public policy disfavoring dishonest, abusive, and unfair
consumer debt collection practices, and clearly intended the FDCPA to have a broad remedial
scope.”).

Here, Defendant was a serial abuser of calling Plaintiff on the different accounts after
Plaintiff informed Defendant it had the wrong number. According to Defendant’s own
contentions, it called Plaintiff 41 times after calling on the first Carter account and being
informed that it had the wrong number on or about March 12, 2013. Sixteen of these 41 calls
came after Plaintiff again informed Defendant that it had the incorrect number on or about May
6, 2013, while Defendant was calling on the second Carter account it obtained. Indeed,
Defendant was so persistent in its calls to Plaintiff and ignoring of Plaintiff’s instructions to stop
calling, that it made its next call to Plaintiff (on the third Carter account it obtained) just 5 days
later on May 11, 2013.2 On or about this date, Plaintiff informed Defendant for the third time
that it had the wrong number, yet Defendant still made 15 (of the 41) calls to Plaintiff thereafter,
between June 7, 2013 and June 24, 2013 (on the fourth Carter account it obtained). (See Doc.
No. 16-1, at ¶¶ 8-13). And Marc Carter is not alone: another consumer, with a common last
name, recently filed a similar lawsuit against CBE. See Johnson v. CBE Group, Inc., Civil
Action No. 3:13-cv-00631 (W.D.N.C. 2013).3
The absence of care on CBE's part for citizens' privacy and the record of harassment here
establish Plaintiff’s claims of a harassing and abusive telephone campaign from Defendant. In
Kirwin, supra, the Defendant did not escape liability merely by showing that its phone system
did not allow it to pull the plaintiffs’ phone number from multiple accounts of other people that it
mistakenly associated with their number. In the instant case, this case will proceed to the
discovery phase so Plaintiff can inquire about how it came to be that Defendant repeatedly called

2

Defendant obtained this third Carter account on May 4, 2013 (Doc. No. 16-1 at ¶ 12); a date
which overlaps with the timeframe in which Defendant was still making calls to Plaintiff on the
second Carter account it obtained (April 12, 2013 – May 6, 2013). Id. at ¶ 10.

Case 4:13-cv-02083 Document 17 Filed in TXSD on 12/31/13 Page 8 of 12

him even after he informed Defendant that it had the wrong number. See, e.g., Quantlab
Technologies Ltd. (BVI) v. Godlevsky, 719 F. Supp. 2d 766, 781-82 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (“[R]ule 11
must not bar the courthouse door to people who have some support for a complaint, but need
discovery to prove their case.”) (quoting Kraemer v. Grant County, 892 F.2d 686, 689 (7th Cir.
1990) (other citation omitted).
Discovery, for example, may show that Defendant was willfully negligent in
implementing a phone system that could not remove or detect Carter's phone number from
multiple accounts with people sharing his last name. As the court in Bank v. Pentagroup Fin.,
LLC, 2009 WL 16064203 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2009), ruled, a violation for Section 1692d of the
FDCPA can be shown by the defendant’s negligence, even where there is no intent to annoy,
harass or oppress the plaintiff:
Though it is true that one of the enumerated means of violating the
anti-harassment prohibition is the making of telephone calls “with
intent to annoy, abuse or harass,” § 1692d(5), the list of specified
violations is explicitly not exhaustive; it is not intended to “limit[ ]
the general application” of the provision's sweeping prohibition of
conduct “the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or
abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt.” A
debt collection program that negligently misplaces numerous calls
to a single wrong number could plausibly have the natural
consequence of harassment or abuse.
Id. at *5.
The odds of Plaintiff randomly receiving 41 calls from one debt collector on four
unrelated accounts are so slim to be near nonexistent. Defendant has not explained how it could
allow these mistaken calls to occur repeatedly and Plaintiff cannot explain it either without the
benefit of discovery. Far from being a frivolous Complaint, Plaintiff’s lawsuit is one that should
continue onto the discovery phase.

III.

Unanswered Calls May be Violative of the FDCPA

Defendant also argues, in part, that Plaintiff’s claims are baseless and frivolous because
only 2 of the 42 calls were answered. (Doc. No. 16 at p. 9). To the contrary, whether an
unanswered call is a “communication” under the FDCPA is an issue of triable fact.. See, e.g.,
Meadows v. Franklin Collection Service, 414 Fed. Appx. 230, 234-35 (11th Cir. 2011) (The
court specifically rejected a defendant debt collector’s claim that its calls were not harassing,
under the FDCPA, because the plaintiff did not answer them.); Cerrato v. Solomon & Solomon,
2012 WL 6621339, at *4–6 (D. Conn. Dec.18, 2012) (unanswered calls constituted
“communications” under the FDCPA where the debt collector’s name and telephone number
appeared on caller identification display).
IV.

The Volume of Calls by Defendant is Evidence of Intent to Harass Plaintiff

Defendant also wrongly contends that Plaintiff’s claims are baseless because “[t]here is
no evidence suggesting that CBE was calling Plaintiff with the intention of harassing him.”
(Doc. No 16 at p. 9). Plaintiff’s claim under Section 392.302(4) of the Texas Debt Collection
Act (“TDCA”), similar to his claim under Section 1692d(5) of the FDCPA, sets forth that: “a
debt collector may not oppress, harass, or abuse a person by ... causing a telephone to ring
repeatedly or continuously, or making repeated or continuous telephone calls, with the intent to
harass a person at the called number.” Tex. Fin. Code § 392.302(4). Contrary to Defendant’s
contention, the requisite intent required of this Texas statute, as well as Section 1692d(5) of the
FDCPA, is supported by the repeated and continuous calls Defendant made to Plaintiff after
Plaintiff demanded that the calls stop supports his claim. See, e.g., McCartney v. CitiFinancial
Auto Credit, Inc., 2010 WL 5834802, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 14, 2010) report and
recommendation adopted, 2011 WL 675386 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 16, 2011). Defendant’s intent to

9

Case 4:13-cv-02083 Document 17 Filed in TXSD on 12/31/13 Page 10 of 12

bombard Plaintiff with calls is further demonstrated by the fact that at one point Defendant had
two Carter accounts with Plaintiff’s phone number at the same time, was told to stop, and
stopped on one but not the other account (see p. 7 and fn. 2, supra). As such, Plaintiff’s claims
are not devoid of a reasonable legal basis that would warrant dismissal of his Complaint or any
other sanctions under Rule 11.
V.

A Non-debtor May Have a Claim under Section 1692f of the FDCPA

Defendant also wrongly contends that Plaintiff’s Complaint is sanctionable because
Plaintiff’s claims under Section 1692f of the FDCPA are frivolous because Defendant “was
attempting to collect debts on accounts for individuals other than Plaintiff with the last name
Carter.” (Doc. No. 16 at p. 14). To the contrary, the FDCPA does not protect consumer debtors
alone; certain of its provisions can and do apply to others affected by unlawful collection
activity. See, e.g., Todd v. Collecto, Inc., 731 F.3d 734, 738 (7th Cir. 2013) (“courts have
stressed that § 1692d is not a protection just for consumers but for any person mistreated by a
debt collector”, “the reach of § 1692f is readily apparent, and we conclude that anyone aggrieved
by a debt collector’s unfair or unconscionable collection practices can fall within the provision’s
zone of interest”); Rawlinson v. Law Office of William M. Rudow, LLC, 460 F. App’x 254, 258
(4th Cir. 2012) (“at least three of the FDCPA provisions relied on by Rawlinson contain no
limitation as to who may invoke them. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692d, 1692e, 1692f” (emphasis in
original)); Eley v. Evans, 476 F. Supp. 2d 531, 533 (E.D. Va. 2007) (construing FDCPA as
meaning that “any aggrieved party may bring an action” under Sections 1692e or 1692f, even if
that aggrieved party is not a debtor). Thus, Defendant’s argument about Plaintiff’s status as a
non-debtor does not support its motion for sanctions.

10

VI.

Plaintiff May Claim Injunctive Relief under Texas State Law

Defendant also makes the argument that Plaintiff is subject to sanctions because his claim
for injunctive relief under Texas law is groundless. To the contrary, Plaintiff finds reasonable
legal support for this claim for relief right in the very language of the Texas statute at issue. To
wit, Section 392.403(a)(1) of the TDCA sets forth: “A person may sue for injunctive relief to
prevent or restrain a violation of this chapter.” Here, Defendant has already called Plaintiff’s
phone number on four different accounts for people with the last name Carter. As such, Plaintiff
has a reasonable basis for requesting injunctive relief under this Texas statute to prevent
Defendant from continuing to call him.
CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, Defendant’s Motion should be denied in its entirety. Plaintiff’s
claims are well grounded in the policy considerations shown in the legislative history and the
case law about protecting non-debtors victimized by debt collection calls because of mistaken
identity and/or common last names. Defendant’s practice, if left unchecked, could overwhelm
people with such common names as Magistrates Smith and Johnson of this bench. Plaintiff
further requests leave to move for fees incurred in responding to Defendant's frivolous motion.
