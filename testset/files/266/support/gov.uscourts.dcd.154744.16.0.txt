Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 6 of 52

Defendant Larry Craig spent more than $216,000 that contributors gave to his U.S.
Senate campaign committee on personal legal expenses he incurred in an effort to withdraw his
guilty plea to a misdemeanor count of disturbing the peace in Minnesota. In denying defendants’
motion to dismiss, this Court correctly held that Craig’s alleged spending “falls squarely” within
the Federal Election Campaign Act’s prohibition on converting campaign funds to personal use.
FEC v. Craig for U.S. Senate, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2013 WL 1248271, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 28,
2013). This Court also found that no advisory opinion of the Federal Election Commission
would excuse defendants’ misuse of campaign funds. Id. at *7-12. Defendants have now
admitted the factual allegations of the Complaint and “the remaining issues are defendants’
liability as a matter of law and the factual and legal determinations that enable the Court to
determine the appropriate remedy.” (Joint Local Rule 16.3 Report ¶ 1(2) (Docket No. 13).)
The Commission now moves for summary judgment. The Court should hold that
defendants’ misuse of funds violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b) and impose appropriate civil remedies.
Craig should be required to disgorge the funds he converted to prevent him from being unjustly
enriched by his wrongdoing. Defendants should also be required to pay a substantial civil
penalty to punish this violation and deter others. The violation allowed Craig to profit, while
injuring contributors to his committee, who were exercising their First Amendment right to
support Craig’s candidacy, not his wallet. Personal use violations also injure the public by
increasing the risk of corruption and the appearance of corruption among federal leaders, while
undermining the public’s confidence in government and the campaign finance system, which
deters participation in the political process. Finally, the Court should issue a declaration and a
permanent injunction to prevent similar future threats to the nation’s political system.

BACKGROUND
I.

The Parties
Plaintiff Federal Election Commission (“Commission” or “FEC”) is an independent

agency of the United States government with exclusive jurisdiction over the administration,
interpretation, and civil enforcement of the Federal Election Campaign Act (“FECA”), 2 U.S.C.
§§ 431-57. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 437c(b)(1), 437d(a), 437g. The Commission is authorized to
investigate possible violations of FECA, id. § 437g(a)(1)-(2), and to initiate civil actions in the
United States district courts to obtain judicial enforcement of FECA, id. §§ 437d(e), 437g(a)(6).
Defendant Larry Craig was a United States Senator from Idaho from January 1991 to
January 2009. (FEC’s Statement of Material Facts as to Which It Contends There Is No Genuine
Issue (“FEC Facts”) ¶ 4.) In 2007, Craig was a candidate for the United States Senate in the
2008 election, and he authorized defendant Craig for U.S. Senate (“Craig Committee”) to be his
principal campaign committee under 2 U.S.C. § 431(5)-(6). (FEC Facts ¶ 5.) Accordingly, the
Craig Committee was authorized to receive campaign contributions and make expenditures on
Craig’s behalf. Id.; see 2 U.S.C. § 432(e)(1)-(2). Craig is a defendant in this matter in his
personal capacity and in his official capacity as treasurer of the Craig Committee. (FEC Facts
¶ 6.)1
II.

Craig’s Arrest, Guilty Plea, and Legal Proceedings in Minnesota
On June 11, 2007, then-Senator Craig was arrested while using a restroom at the

Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where he was awaiting a scheduled flight to
Washington, D.C. (FEC Facts ¶ 7.) Craig was charged under Minnesota law with disturbing the
peace-disorderly conduct and interference with privacy. (Id. ¶ 8.) About two months later, on
1

On May 1, 2013, this Court entered a minute order granting defendants’ consent motion
to substitute Craig for Kaye O’Riordan as treasurer of the Craig Committee.
2

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 8 of 52

August 8, 2007, Craig pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct in Minnesota
state district court. (Id. ¶ 9.)
Craig subsequently retained the Washington, D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill &
Brennan (“Sutherland”) and the Minnesota law firm of Kelly & Jacobson (“Kelly”) in an effort
to withdraw his guilty plea. (FEC Facts ¶ 10.) On September 10, 2007, Craig filed a motion to
withdraw the guilty plea, which was denied on October 4, 2007. (Id. ¶ 13.) Craig appealed the
ruling to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which rejected the appeal on December 9, 2008. (Id.)
From October 29, 2007 through October 5, 2008, the Craig Committee paid at least $139,952 to
Sutherland and $77,032 to Kelly, for a total of at least $216,984, in connection with Craig’s
failed efforts to withdraw his guilty plea. (Id. ¶ 23.)
III.

The Senate Ethics Committee Proceedings
The United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics (“Senate Ethics Committee”)

conducted an inquiry into Craig’s conduct in connection with his arrest, guilty plea, and
subsequent conduct. (FEC Facts ¶ 25.) The Brand Law Group in Washington, D.C. — which
represents defendants in this matter — also represented Craig before the Senate Ethics
Committee. (Id. ¶ 26.) In a September 5, 2007, letter to the Senate Ethics Committee, Craig’s
counsel argued that the Senate Ethics Committee should not exercise jurisdiction over the matter
because Craig’s arrest and guilty plea was for “purely personal conduct unrelated to the
performance of official Senate duties.” (Id. (emphasis added).)
On February 13, 2008, the Senate Ethics Committee issued a “Public Letter of
Admonition” unanimously concluding that, among other matters, Craig had not complied with
Senate Rule 38.2, which requires Senate Ethics Committee approval of any payments for legal
expenses paid with funds of a principal campaign committee. (FEC Facts ¶ 27.) Specifically,

3

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 9 of 52

the Ethics Committee wrote:
[T]he Senate Ethics Manual states that “Members, officers or employees
may pay legal expenses incurred in connection with their official duties
with funds of a Senator’s principal campaign committee, but only if such
payment is approved by the Committee.” . . . It appears that you have
used over $213,000 in campaign funds to pay legal (and, apparently,
“public relations”) fees in connection with your appeal of your criminal
conviction and in connection with the preliminary inquiry before the
Committee in this matter. It appears that some portion of these expenses
may not be deemed to have been incurred in connection with your official
duties, either by the Committee or by the Federal Election Commission
(which has concurrent jurisdiction with the Committee on the issue of
conversion of a Senator’s campaign funds to personal use).
(Id. (emphasis omitted; second emphasis added).)
IV.

FEC Administrative Proceedings
On November 10, 2008, the Commission received an administrative complaint alleging

that Craig had violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b), the provision of FECA that bars the conversion of
campaign funds to personal use, by spending campaign funds to pay legal fees and expenses
incurred in connection with his arrest and conviction. (FEC Facts ¶ 28.) By letter dated
November 18, 2008, the Commission notified defendants that the administrative complaint had
been filed and provided defendants with a copy. Craig responded to the Commission
on December 2, 2008. FEC Facts ¶ 29; see 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(1). In that response, Craig
claimed that he did not violate FECA and that he acted in good faith on the basis of a letter from
his counsel, dated October 4, 2007, which Craig attached. (FEC Facts ¶ 29; see also id. ¶ 17.)
After reviewing the then-available information, on May 19, 2009, the Commission voted
5-0 (with one Commissioner recused) to find “reason to believe” that defendants had violated
2 U.S.C. § 439a(b). FEC Facts ¶ 30; see 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(1)-(2).
Following an investigation, briefing by the Commission’s General Counsel and
defendants, and a hearing, on February 7, 2012, the Commission voted 5-0 to find probable
4

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 10 of 52

cause to believe that defendants had violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b). FEC Facts ¶ 31; see 2 U.S.C.
§ 437g(a)(4)(A).
As FECA requires, the Commission then endeavored to correct the violations through
informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion for a period of not less than
30 days. FEC Facts ¶ 32; see 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(4)(A). Unable to secure acceptable
conciliation agreements, and having met each of the jurisdictional prerequisites to bringing suit,
on May 3, 2012, the Commission voted 5-0 to authorize this litigation against defendants. FEC
Facts ¶ 32; see 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6).
V.

Proceedings Before This Court
The Commission filed this action on June 11, 2012, pursuant to its authority under

2 U.S.C. §§ 437d(a)(6), 437g(a)(6)(A). (FEC Facts ¶ 33.) Defendants moved to dismiss the
Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on August 8, 2012. (See Defs.’ Mot.
to Dismiss (Docket No. 3).) After holding a hearing, the Court denied defendants’ motion on
March 28, 2013. (See Order (Docket No. 10).) The Court concluded that if the factual
allegations in the Complaint were assumed to be true, the Craig Committee’s “campaign funds
were converted to Senator Craig’s personal use,” and therefore the Commission had stated a
valid claim that defendants violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b). Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL
1248271, at *1; see also Mem. Op. at 2 (Docket No. 11).
On April 11, 2013, defendants filed an Answer in which they admitted the factual
allegations of the Commission’s Complaint. (Answer (Docket No. 12).). On April 19, 2013, the
parties filed a joint report pursuant to Local Civil Rule 16.3. (Joint Local Rule 16.3 Report
(Docket No. 13).) In that joint report, the parties stated that “Defendants do not dispute any of
the relevant facts regarding the violations alleged in this case,” and “it appears at present that the

5

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 11 of 52

remaining issues are defendants’ liability as a matter of law and the factual and legal
determinations that enable the Court to determine the appropriate remedy.” (Id. ¶ 1(2) (Docket
No. 13).)
The Court issued a scheduling order on April 26, 2013, directing the parties to complete
discovery by August 30, 2013, and setting a dispositive motion briefing schedule. (Scheduling
Order at 1 (Docket No. 14).) The Commission now moves this Court for an order granting
summary judgment against defendants. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (summary judgment is
appropriate if there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law”). If the Court concludes that defendants violated 2 U.S.C.
§ 439a(b), the Commission also requests that the Court order appropriate civil remedies against
defendants pursuant to 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B).
ARGUMENT
I.

DEFENDANTS SPENT MORE THAN $216,000 IN VIOLATION OF FECA’S
BAN ON CONVERTING CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO PERSONAL USE
Senator Craig and his campaign committee spent more than $216,000 in funds from

campaign contributors on then-Senator Craig’s personal legal expenses stemming from his
attempt to withdraw a guilty plea he entered following arrest in Minnesota for disturbing the
peace. In denying defendants’ motion to dismiss, this Court held that defendants’ alleged
spending “falls squarely” within FECA’s prohibition on converting campaign funds to personal
use. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *6. Since defendants have now admitted the
factual allegations of the Complaint, the Court should hold that defendants violated section
439a(b), which is a key part of FECA’s framework designed to prevent self-dealing by federal
office holders as well as promote confidence in government and the campaign finance system.
The defendants’ violation of FECA is not excused by any FEC advisory opinion. As this Court
6

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 12 of 52

has held, the advisory opinions defendants have cited are all materially distinguishable. Nor did
defendants rely in good faith on any of the opinions, as would be required for the opinions to
protect defendants. This Court should therefore grant summary judgment to the Commission.
A.

Defendants Converted Campaign Funds to Craig’s Personal Use

FECA permits the use of campaign funds for six purposes. See 2 U.S.C. § 439a(a)(1)-(6).
They include “ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with duties of [an]
individual as a holder of Federal office,” id. § 439a(a)(2), and any “lawful purpose unless
prohibited by” section 439a(b), id. § 439a(a)(6). However, section 439a(b) bars any person from
converting campaign funds to personal use. 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b)(1). That occurs where campaign
funds are “used to fulfill any commitment, obligation, or expense of a person that would exist
irrespective of the . . . individual’s duties as a holder of Federal office.” Id. § 439a(b)(2). The
Commission has explained that under this prohibition, campaign funds may be used for expenses
“caused by . . . the activities of an officeholder,” but may not be used for expenses that “would
exist . . . even if the officeholder were not in office.” Expenditures; Reports by Political
Committees, Personal Use of Campaign Funds, 60 Fed. Reg. 7862, 7863-64 (Feb. 9, 1995).
While some expenses, such as a home mortgage, are always deemed personal use, 2
U.S.C. § 439a(b)(2)(A), the Commission examines other expenses, such as legal expenses, on a
case-by-case basis, 11 C.F.R. § 113.1(g)(1)(ii)(A). In no case, however, are legal expenses
officeholder-related “merely because the underlying legal proceedings have some impact on . . .
the officeholder’s status,” as would be the case with charges for driving under the influence of
alcohol. 60 Fed. Reg. 7862, 7868. Campaign funds therefore may not be used for such personal
legal expenses. Id.

7

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 13 of 52

On March 28, 2013, this Court held that the now-admitted allegations of the FEC’s
Complaint stated a valid claim that defendants violated section 439a(b). Craig for U.S. Senate,
2013 WL 1248271, at *1. The Court explained that Craig’s Minnesota legal expenses were
personal and were not incurred in connection with his officeholder duties. Id. at *5-6. Craig
incurred his legal expenses as a result of being arrested for and pleading guilty to disturbing the
peace under Minnesota law. Id. at *5. “Neither the charge nor the underlying conduct had
anything to do with [Craig’s] performance of his official duties,” the Court explained. Id.
Indeed, Craig admitted this fact to the Senate Ethics Committee, where he contended that his
conduct was “purely personal” and “unrelated to the performance of official Senate duties.” Id.
at *6 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Craig has asserted that his legal expenses were not personal because he was arrested in
the midst of official travel from his home state of Idaho to Washington, D.C. Craig for U.S.
Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *5. But, as this Court pointed out, his legal expenses “were
neither incurred at the time of the travel nor necessitated by the travel.” Id. Craig’s legal
expenses were incurred months later — after Craig pled guilty, reconsidered that decision, and
then hired attorneys to help him try to undo it — making any purported link with Craig’s travel
“even more attenuated.” Id.
Because Craig’s duties did not cause his legal expenses, this Court explained that it was
irrelevant whether Craig’s decision to withdraw his plea was motivated by concern for political
or reputational status. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *6. In this respect, the Court
concluded, Craig’s expenses “are analogous to the legal expenses for other personal
transgressions such as driving while intoxicated that the Commission has determined will be
treated as personal.” Id.

8

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 14 of 52

Accordingly, this Court should hold that defendants violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b).
B.

No FEC Advisory Opinion Forecloses Sanctions Against Defendants for
Their Violations

In their motion to dismiss, defendants claimed that even if they were deemed to have
violated section 439a(b), they would nonetheless be immune from liability because they relied on
FEC advisory opinions that allegedly authorized spending materially similar to their own. This
Court rejected that argument, and it should do so again if defendants reassert it.
FECA shields certain persons from “any sanction” under FECA for “good faith reliance”
upon an FEC advisory opinion. 2 U.S.C. § 437f(c). To qualify for this immunity, however, a
person must (1) “rel[y] upon any provision or finding of an advisory opinion”; (2) be “involved
in any specific transaction or activity which is indistinguishable in all its material aspects from
the transaction or activity with respect to which such advisory opinion [was] rendered”; and (3)
“act[] in good faith in accordance with the provisions and findings of such advisory opinion.” Id.
§ 437f(c)(1)(B), (2).
1.

The Kolbe Advisory Opinion Is Materially Distinguishable from
Defendants’ Conversion of Campaign Funds to Personal Use

In this litigation defendants have relied primarily on FEC Advisory Opinion (“AO”)
2006-35 (Kolbe), but as this Court has already concluded, that reliance is misplaced. See Craig
for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *7-11. Then-United States Representative Jim Kolbe had
asked the FEC whether he could use campaign funds for legal expenses associated with a
preliminary inquiry by the Justice Department. FEC AO 2006-35 (Kolbe), 2007 WL 419188, at
*1 (Jan. 26, 2007).2 The preliminary inquiry concerned, in part, information Kolbe knew
regarding another member of Congress’s interaction with pages working at the House of
2

FEC AO 2006-35 (Kolbe) can also be found at http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/2006-

35.pdf.
9

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 15 of 52

Representatives. Id. at *2. To the extent Kolbe learned this information because Kolbe was an
officeholder, the FEC approved the request. Id.
The preliminary inquiry also concerned a “rafting trip to the Grand Canyon” that Kolbe
took in 1996. FEC AO 2006-35 (Kolbe), 2007 WL 419188, at *3. Because that trip was “an
official Congressional visit,” the Commission concluded that Kolbe’s legal expenses “in
responding to the inquiry into his trip” at that preliminary stage were permissible, officeholderrelated expenses under section 439a(a)(2) and not personal use under section 439a(b). Id. at *3.
The Commission, however, added an important caveat. It pointed out that the Justice
Department had not yet made the “details of the preliminary inquiry” public, and that it was
“possible that the scope of the inquiry could involve allegations not related to Representative
Kolbe’s duties as a Federal officeholder.” FEC AO 2006-35 (Kolbe), 2007 WL 419188, at *3.
The opinion warned that Kolbe would not be permitted to use campaign funds for the inquiry to
the extent it involved “other allegations, if any, that do not concern” Kolbe’s officeholder duties.
Id.
Nevertheless, defendants claimed that the Kolbe opinion approved the use of campaign
funds for an inquiry into any personal misconduct Kolbe may have engaged in during the official
trip. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *8. But as this Court observed, “the opinion
doesn’t say that at all.” Id. Instead, the test the Commission articulated is “whether the
particular subject of the legal inquiry that calls for the payment of legal fees ‘relates to’ or
‘concerns’ the Member’s campaign activities or duties as a federal office holder.” Id. (citing
FEC AO 2006-35 (Kolbe), 2007 WL 419188, at *2).
Defendants also claimed that the Kolbe opinion immunized their violation of section
439a(b) because of the Commission’s alleged awareness of certain underlying facts in the Kolbe

10

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 16 of 52

situation. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *9. Pointing to communications between
Kolbe’s representatives and FEC staff, defendants argued that the Commission “knew” when it
approved the Kolbe opinion that the Department of Justice was investigating allegations that
Kolbe engaged in personal misconduct with pages who accompanied him on the Grand Canyon
trip. Id. This Court, however, found defendants’ attempt to rely upon such pre-decisional
communications unavailing. Id. at *9-11. As the Court explained, the communications between
Kolbe and the FEC show, “[a]t most,” that the FEC knew that there was an inquiry into the
rafting trip, that the inquiry was in its early stages and its details were confidential, and “that
prosecutors had not designated Kolbe as a ‘target.’” Id. at *11. Kolbe’s interactions with pages
on the trip could have been “[o]ne possible — and unconfirmed — subject of the inquiry,” the
Court noted, but the inquiry also “could have been [about] Kolbe’s receipt of information about
another Congressman.” Id.
Accordingly, the Kolbe advisory opinion does not immunize defendants’ conversion of
campaign funds to Craig’s personal use in violation of section 439a(b).
2.

The Other Advisory Opinions Defendants Have Cited Are Also
Materially Distinguishable from Defendants’ Activities

No other FEC advisory opinion immunizes defendants’ violation of the personal use ban.
In their motion to dismiss, defendants argued that they relied upon three advisory opinions in
addition to Kolbe. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL 1248271, at *11-12. As this Court
concluded, however, each of those opinions is materially distinguishable. In FEC AO 1997-27
(Boehner), 1998 WL 108616 (Feb. 23, 1998)3 and FEC AO 2000-40 (McDermott), 2001 WL

136013 (Feb. 7, 2001),4 the Commission approved the use of campaign funds to pay for legal
fees where “the activities underlying the lawsuit arose out of [Boehner’s and McDermott’s]
performance of their official duties” as members of Congress. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013 WL
1248271, at *12.
In FEC AO 2005-11 (Cunningham), 2005 WL 2470825 (Sept. 26, 2005),5 the
Commission similarly approved the use of campaign funds for legal fees to respond to an
investigation into whether a member of Congress received benefits from a federal defense
contractor because of his position on a Congressional committee. Craig for U.S. Senate, 2013
WL 1248271, at *12. In contrast, nothing about Craig’s official duties caused the legal expenses
he incurred in trying to withdraw his guilty plea. Id.

Defendants Did Not Rely in Good Faith on Kolbe or Any Other FEC
Advisory Opinion

Kolbe and the other distinguishable advisory opinions that defendants have cited offer
them no protection from prosecution for an additional reason: Defendants did not rely in good
faith upon those opinions. Section 437f(c) offers “protection for good faith reliance” on an
advisory opinion. A person invoking that protection must have “relie[d] upon any provision or
finding of an advisory opinion” and have “act[ed] in good faith in accordance” with those
provisions and findings. 2 U.S.C. § 437f(c)(2).
After the Commission notified Craig of the administrative complaint in this matter, Craig
maintained that he had made a “good faith effort to ascertain the legality of using campaign
funds for these expenses” based on the advice from counsel he received in a letter dated October

4, 2007. (FEC Facts ¶ 17; see also id. ¶ 29.) That advice, however, did not rest upon the Kolbe,
McDermott, Boehner, or Cunningham advisory opinions. The October 4, 2007 letter does not
even mention the McDermott, Boehner, or Cunningham advisory opinions. (Id. ¶ 19.) The letter
did advise Craig that the Kolbe opinion allowed him to legally spend campaign funds for
representation before the Senate Ethics Committee. (Id. ¶ 18.) But in its next paragraph, the
letter stated that counsel had “found no directly applicable FEC opinions” on the separate issue
of whether Craig could legally spend campaign funds on his Minnesota legal expenses. (Id.)
And despite being aware of the Kolbe opinion, counsel further advised that the “FEC has
apparently never addressed legal expenses stemming from official travel.” (Id.) Instead, the
letter relied upon two provisions of the Constitution to incorrectly advise that Craig’s Minnesota
legal expenses were not personal use under section 439a(b). (Id. ¶ 20.) Thus, the letter reflects a
view that the Kolbe opinion and the other opinions had no bearing on whether Craig could spend
campaign funds on his Minnesota legal fees.
Defendants therefore did not in fact rely upon or act in good faith in accordance with the
Commission advisory opinions upon which they rely here. Thus, defendants cannot invoke those
opinions as a safe harbor under 2 U.S.C. § 437f(c)(2).

To pay for then-Senator Craig’s personal legal expenses, defendants used more than
$216,000 that donors contributed to Craig’s campaign committee. That act violated 2 U.S.C.
§ 439a(b), and no FEC advisory opinion excuses that violation. The Court should therefore grant
summary judgment for the Commission.

II.

DEFENDANTS SHOULD DISGORGE THE CONVERTED FUNDS AND PAY A
SIGNIFICANT CIVIL PENALTY FOR THEIR VIOLATION OF A CRITICAL
PART OF THE NATION’S CAMPAIGN FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE
If this Court concludes that defendants are liable for violating FECA’s personal use ban,

the Commission respectfully requests that the Court impose appropriate remedies against
defendants. Section 439a is important because it promotes ethical federal leadership as well as
public faith in government and the campaign finance system in particular.
FECA authorizes this Court to grant a “permanent or temporary injunction, restraining
order, or other order, including a civil penalty which does not exceed the greater of [$7,500] or
an amount equal to any contribution or expenditure involved” in the violation. 2 U.S.C.
§ 437g(a)(6)(B); see 11 C.F.R. § 111.24(a)(1).6 The Commission requests that this Court (1)
order Craig to disgorge the $216,984 he converted to his personal use and refund that amount to
the Craig Committee; (2) order Craig to pay a $70,000 civil penalty; (3) order the Craig
Committee to pay a $70,000 civil penalty; and (4) declare that defendants violated section
439a(b) and permanently enjoin them from violating that provision again. As discussed below,
these proposed remedies promote important interests, including preventing unjust enrichment,
deterrence, and punishment for injury to contributors.
A.

Disgorgement Would Prevent Craig from Being Unjustly Enriched by His
Conversion of Campaign Funds to Personal Use

This Court should order Craig to disgorge the $216,984 he converted to his personal use.
See 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B) (authorizing “other orders” to remedy FECA violations). The
primary purpose of disgorgement is “‘to make sure that wrongdoers will not profit from their
wrongdoing.’” SEC v. Whittemore, 691 F. Supp. 2d 198, 204 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting SEC v.

6

The first part of section 437g(a)(6)(B)’s civil penalty amount was adjusted for inflation
from $5,000 to $7,500. See 11 C.F.R. § 111.24(a)(1).

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 20 of 52

Tome, 833 F.2d 1086, 1096 (2d Cir. 1987)); see also SEC v. Bilzerian, 29 F.3d 689, 697 (D.C.
Cir. 1994) (explaining that disgorgement “deprive[s] the wrongdoer of his ill-gotten gain”
(internal quotation marks omitted)). It achieves this goal by “remedying the effects of past
conduct to restore the status quo,” and it is “measured by the amount of prior unlawful gains.”
United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 396 F.3d 1190, 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2005).
Officeholders who convert campaign funds to their personal use, as Craig did, unjustly
benefit since otherwise they would have had to use their personal funds or forego their purchases
altogether. Disgorgement eliminates that unjust benefit. See FEC v. Furgatch, 869 F.2d 1256,
1258 n.1 (9th Cir. 1989) (suggesting that where a defendant derives a “tangible benefit” from a
FECA violation, a court may consider “the desire to eliminate the benefit derived from the
violation” in ordering remedies under section 437g(a)(6)(B) (internal quotation marks omitted)).
For that reason, the Commission regularly requires respondents in the administrative
enforcement process to disgorge converted funds when conciliating personal use violations. See,
e.g., Conciliation Agreement, Matter Under Review (“MUR”) 5787 (Kalyn Free for Congress)
¶ VI.2 (requiring respondent who violated section 439a(b) to refund full amount of personally
used funds);7 Conciliation Agreement, MUR 5895 (Meeks for Congress) ¶ VI.4 (same);8
Conciliation Agreement, MUR 5962 (Istook for Congress) ¶ XII (same);9 Conciliation
Agreement, MUR 5372 (Campbell for Senate) ¶ VII (noting that respondents who violated
section 439a(b) had already refunded amount converted).10

Similarly, courts addressing criminal violations resulting from the personal use of
campaign funds have ordered — in addition to imprisonment — restitution, forfeiture, and other
financial penalties designed to remove any benefit the defendant may have received from the
violation. See, e.g., Judgment, United States v. Jackson, No. 13-cr-0058 (D.D.C. Aug. 19, 2013)
(Docket No. 56) (ordering former Congressman to forfeit any property derived from stolen
campaign funds, to pay a money judgment of $750,000, and to serve 30 months in prison for
conspiring to commit false statement, mail fraud, and wire fraud); Judgments, United States v.
Taff, 400 F. Supp. 2d 1270 (D. Kan. 2005) (No. 2:05-cr-20086, Docket Nos. 51, 52) (federal
candidate sentenced to 15 months in prison for section 439a violation and wire fraud, codefendant sentenced to five months in prison and $50,000 fine for wire fraud, where converted
campaign funds already returned to committee prior to sentencing); United States v. Henningsen,
387 F.3d 585, 588 (7th Cir. 2004) (explaining that the defendant was ordered to pay $7,370 in
restitution and sentenced to 33 months in prison for personal use of campaign funds in violation
of mail fraud statute); United States v. Pawlinski, 374 F.3d 536, 537 (7th Cir. 2004) (explaining
that the defendant was ordered to pay restitution of $39,324.03 and serve eight months in prison
for converting campaign funds to personal use in violation of mail fraud statute).11
Courts in this Circuit have also ordered disgorgement in other contexts where, as here, a
party wrongly profited from his or her violation of the law. See, e.g., Bilzerian, 29 F.3d at 697
(affirming order that defendant disgorge more than $33 million derived from committing
securities fraud); Whittemore, 691 F. Supp. 2d at 209-10 (ordering defendants to disgorge more
than $1 million obtained via securities fraud); SEC v. Levine, 517 F. Supp. 2d 121, 128, 141
11

The Department of Justice prosecutes criminal cases involving the stealing of campaign
funds either as “FECA crimes under 2 U.S.C. § 439a, or as mail or honest services frauds under
18 U.S.C. § 1341 and 1346.” Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses at
195 (7th ed. 2007), http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pin/docs/electbook-0507.pdf.
16

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 22 of 52

(D.D.C. 2007) (explaining that the “court possesses power to order the defendants to disgorge
fully the ill-gotten gains of their fraudulent activities,” and ordering defendants to disgorge more
than $217,000 in “unlawful profits”).
Craig admits that he used at least $216,984 in campaign funds from the Craig Committee
to pay the Sutherland and Kelly law firms for services related to withdrawal of his guilty plea.
(FEC Facts ¶ 23.) But for this violation of FECA, Craig would have had to pay for his legal
representation himself. Instead, Craig in effect obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars in free
legal services. This Court should order Craig to disgorge $216,984 to prevent him from profiting
from his wrongdoing and to restore the status quo, and order it refunded to the Craig
Committee.12

12

Alternatively, the Court could order that the converted funds be disgorged to the United
States Treasury, and there are substantial reasons for doing so given the Craig Committee’s
complicity in the violations and Craig’s control over Craig Committee funds. In this case,
however, the Commission recommends that Craig instead be ordered to refund the converted
funds to the Craig Committee. The Craig Committee has now spent virtually all its funds and
raising funds at this time is unlikely. FEC data shows that the Craig Committee had only
$614.74 in cash on hand as of July 15, 2013. See 2013 July 15 Quarterly Report for Craig for
U.S. Senate (July 15, 2013) at 2, http://images.nictusa.com/pdf/071/13020350071/
13020350071.pdf. A refund to the Craig Committee would thus enable it to pay a significant
civil penalty in this case, which is warranted given its use of funds in violation of section
439a(b), as explained below. See infra pp. 18-29. If anything less than the full authorized civil
penalty were ordered, the remaining portion of the funds refunded by Craig would be in the
Craig Committee’s control, which comes closer to restoring the status quo. Though the personal
use violations at issue here raise questions regarding whether the funds would be used in a
manner supported by the Craig Committee’s contributors, restoring the funds to the Craig
Committee at least allows for the possibility that its contributors could seek a refund from the
Craig Committee or demand that the Craig Committee contribute the funds to further candidates
and issues consistent with former-Senator Craig’s policy positions while in office. Of course, the
Craig Committee’s use of the funds would remain subject to 2 U.S.C. § 439a.

B.

A Substantial Civil Penalty Would Punish Defendants’ Violation, Deter
Future Violations, Promote Public Confidence in Government and the
Campaign Finance System, and Serve Other Important Interests

In addition to disgorgement, FECA authorizes this Court to impose a civil penalty in an
amount equal to the $216,984 in expenditures involved in each defendant’s violation (Craig and
the Craig Committee), for a total potential penalty of $433,968. See 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B).
The Commission, however, requests that the Court assess a $70,000 civil penalty against Craig
and a $70,000 civil penalty against the Craig Committee. When coupled with disgorgement,
civil penalties in these amounts would effectively punish defendants’ violation while deterring
future violations. These civil penalties would also reflect the serious nature of defendants’
violation — the theft of campaign funds for personal gain not only injures the contributors of
those funds, but also undermines the public’s confidence in government and the campaign
finance system. Furthermore, the requested civil penalties would vindicate the authority of the
FEC, in part by creating an incentive for parties to settle during the statutorily mandated
conciliation process and conserve court resources. Finally, defendants cannot show that they
attempted to comply with the law in good faith or that Craig is unable to pay a substantial civil
penalty.
1.

The Need to Deter Future Personal Use Violations at a Time When
Billions of Dollars Are Contributed to Federal Candidates

Civil penalties deter defendants and others from engaging in similar illegal activities. See
United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 231-32 (1975); SEC v. One or More
Unknown Traders in the Common Stock of Certain Issuers, 825 F. Supp. 2d 26, 33 (D.D.C.
2010); see also SEC v. Kenton Capital, Ltd., 69 F. Supp. 2d 1, 17 (D.D.C. 1998) (“[S]ubstantial
monetary penalties, in addition to the disgorgement of profits, [are] necessary for the deterrence
of securities law violations that otherwise may provide great financial returns to the violator.”
18

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 24 of 52

(internal quotation marks omitted)). To be an effective deterrent, a civil penalty must be large
enough so that potential violators will not regard it as “nothing more than an acceptable cost of
violation.” ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 231; see, e.g., Sands, Taylor & Wood v. The
Quaker Oats Co., 34 F.3d 1340, 1351 (7th Cir. 1994) (“There is no incentive to engage in . . .
licensing negotiations when the consequence of getting caught for trade piracy is simply to pay
what should have been paid earlier.”); United States v. St. Michael’s Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579,
588 (1st Cir. 1989) (“To have any real deterrent effect, the potential fine must be large enough to
have some real economic impact on potential violators.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
In this case, given the large amount of campaign funds that defendants converted to
Craig’s personal use, it is critical that the civil penalty be substantial enough to create a real
financial disincentive to violating section 439a(b). A civil penalty that is too low would fail to
deter others from violating the personal use ban in the future. Would-be violators could
reasonably determine that the chance that they may have to pay a minor civil penalty (if caught)
is an acceptable risk to take for the immediate benefit of personally using a relatively large
amount of campaign funds. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,
528 U.S. 167, 186 (2000) (“[I]t is reasonable for Congress to conclude that an actual award of
civil penalties does in fact bring with it a significant quantum of deterrence over and above what
is achieved by the mere prospect of such penalties.”). A small civil penalty for a violation of 2
U.S.C. § 439a(b) would amount to little more than a license fee or low-interest loan for the
personal use of campaign funds.
The need for deterrence of personal use violations is particularly great given the vast
amounts of money that are contributed to campaign committees. In the 2012 election cycle
alone, presidential and congressional candidates received more than $2.65 billion. Press Release,

19

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 25 of 52

FEC, FEC Summarizes 21-Month Campaign Activity of the 2012 Election Cycle (Jan. 30,
2013).13 At the conclusion of that election cycle, more than $423.8 million of those funds
remained unspent. See id. The amount of money received by campaign committees almost
invariably increases from election cycle to election cycle, and therefore there will always be
significant opportunity and temptation for those in control of those funds to abuse the generosity
of campaign contributors. In fact, in 2007, the Department of Justice reported that it had seen a
“dramatic rise” in the number of cases in which candidates and others “steal money that has been
contributed to a candidate . . . for the purpose of electing the candidate.” Department of Justice,
Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, 194-95 (7th ed. May 2007).14 And in 2012, the FEC
recommended that Congress expand FECA’s personal use ban to apply to all political
committees to stem the “growing problem” of the personal use of money contributed for political
purposes. FEC, Legislative Recommendations of the Federal Election Commission 2012 at 7
(May 10, 2012).15
Finally, this Court should impose a civil penalty with real deterrent impact because its
ruling would constitute particularly important authority for future violations of FECA’s personal
use ban. The vast majority of FECA violations are resolved during the statutorily mandated
conciliation process under 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(4)(A). As a result, as far as we are aware, a ruling
by this Court imposing remedies for a civil violation of 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b) would be the first of
its kind and thus an important indication of the sanctions would-be violators are likely to face in
court.

2.

Injury to Contributors to the Craig Committee

Defendants’ conversion of campaign funds injured contributors to the Craig Committee
to the same extent that it benefited Craig. The Court should consider that injury in determining
the civil penalty. The more than $216,000 that defendants converted from the Craig Committee
is equal to more than two-thirds of the total amount of contributions the Craig Committee
received in 2007 and 2008 ($318,180). (FEC Facts ¶ 24.) The Craig Committee received those
contributions from at least 107 individuals and 108 political committees. (Id.) The injury to
these contributors is not unlike injury from fraud: Their contributions were made for a legitimate
purpose, but the recipient used the funds for a different and illegitimate purpose.
The act of making a contribution is protected by the First Amendment. See Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 20-23 (1976). As the Supreme Court has explained, “[m]aking a contribution,
like joining a political party, serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.” Id. at 22. It also
“serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views.” Id. at 21. But
defendants took advantage of the Craig Committee contributors’ acts of affiliation with and
support for Craig — the candidate — and his political views. Defendants injured their
contributors when their funds were not used to advance those political views and the Court
should take that into account and assess a substantial civil penalty.
3.

Defendants’ Violations Undermined the Public’s Confidence in
Government and the Campaign Finance System

“[T]here is always harm to the public when FECA is violated.” FEC v. Am. Fed’n of
State, Cnty. and Mun. Emps.— P.E.O.P.L.E. Qualified, No. 88-3208, 1991 WL 241892, at *2
(D.D.C. Oct. 31, 1991). Congress enacted FECA to “‘promote fair practices in the conduct of
election campaigns for Federal political offices.’” McCutcheon v. FEC, 893 F. Supp. 2d 133,
134-35 (D.D.C. 2012) (three-judge court) (quoting Pub. L. No. 92-225, preamble, 86 Stat. 3, 3
21

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 27 of 52

(1972)), prob. juris. noted, 133 S. Ct. 1242 (2013). And the ban on personal use of campaign
funds is a key part of FECA’s statutory scheme. It serves at least two important interests that are
undermined by defendants’ violation.
First, the personal use ban helps prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption,
potential dangers which undermine confidence in government. Even when the funds given are
used for proper purposes, large contributions that are “‘given to secure a political quid pro quo
from current and potential office holders’” undermine the “‘integrity of our system of
representative democracy.’” EMILY’s List v. FEC, 581 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting
Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27). That system is threatened even further when federal candidates use
contributions to subsidize their own personal expenses, such as discretionary legal endeavors
unrelated to their campaigns for office. At the very least, it appears corrupt to the public when
candidates use contributions for their personal projects. And as the Supreme Court has
explained, “the avoidance of the appearance” of corruption is “critical” to prevent the public’s
“confidence in the system of representative Government” from being “eroded to a disastrous
extent.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Second, the personal use ban promotes confidence in the system of financing federal
election campaigns. As explained above, supra p. 21, citizens contribute money to political
campaigns believing that they are assisting a candidate’s bid for election and expressing general
support for the candidate and his or her views. When contributions are used instead for the
personal gain of the very people the public has entrusted with the levers of our government — in
this case, a United States Senator — the general public will view the collection of campaign
funds with greater skepticism. Indeed, the United States Senate itself has stated that the personal
use of campaign funds is “contrary to accepted morals . . . [and] the public trust expected of a

22

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 28 of 52

Senator.” U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics, Senate Ethics Manual at 155 (2003 ed.)
(internal quotation marks omitted).16 As a result of this breach of trust, citizens will be deterred
from participating in the political system and from exercising the First Amendment-protected
expression and affiliation that occurs when making a contribution to a candidate. A substantial
civil penalty should be imposed for this “injury to the public.” See FEC v. Comm. of 100
Democrats, 844 F. Supp. 1, 7 (D.D.C 1993); Furgatch, 869 F.2d at 1258 (same).
4.

Craig Profited from Defendants’ Violation

In determining an appropriate civil penalty under 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B), the Court
should also consider that Craig profited greatly from his FECA violation. See Furgatch, 869
F.2d at 1258, n.1. He converted more than $216,000 to purchase top-tier legal representation in
a discretionary effort to withdraw a guilty plea for disturbing the peace. The attorneys he hired
at Sutherland charged up to $650 per hour, while the Kelly firm charged $550 per hour. (FEC
Facts ¶¶ 10-12.) And because Craig was able to use campaign funds for these legal expenses, his
own funds remained available for other personal purchases and expenses.
In Furgatch, the Ninth Circuit affirmed an order that a defendant who violated FECA pay
a civil penalty under section 437g(a)(6)(B) that was essentially 100 percent of the amount of
involved in the violation ($25,000 penalty for $25,008 in expenditures), despite the fact that the
defendant derived no financial benefit from violating FECA’s reporting requirements. 869 F.2d
at 1258 n.1, 1264. The court noted, however, that where a defendant does profit, courts should
also consider “the desire to eliminate the benefit derived from the violation” as an additional
factor in the section 437g(a)(6)(B) civil penalty calculus. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

5.

The Need to Punish Defendants’ Serious Violations of Campaign
Finance Law

Civil penalties are intended, in part, “to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers.”
Gabelli v. SEC, --- U.S. ---, 133 S. Ct. 1216, 1223 (2013); see also Tull v. United States, 481
U.S. 412, 422 (1987) (explaining that penalties are “intended to punish culpable individuals,” not
to “restore the status quo”); see, e.g., Levine, 517 F. Supp. 2d at 141-42 (imposing a $200,000
civil penalty in addition to a $217,368.59 disgorgement order for securities fraud). Thus, a court
may impose civil penalties that are designed to “require retribution for wrongful conduct” based
on factors such as the seriousness of the violation and a lack of good-faith efforts to comply with
the law. Tull, 481 U.S. at 423.
Defendants’ violation of the FECA personal use ban warrants a substantial civil penalty.
As discussed in more detail above, Craig made a profit of more than $216,000 by personally
using funds that donors thought they were giving to the Craig Committee to be used for proper
political purposes. See supra p. 23. This improper use of campaign funds harmed Craig’s
contributors and the public, undermining faith in government and the political process. See
supra pp. 21-23. Defendants’ violation should therefore be punished in a significant way.
Imposition of a civil penalty in addition to ordering the disgorgement of funds is the only remedy
that serves the interest in punishment.
6.

The Importance of Vindicating the Authority of the Commission and
Encouraging Pre-Litigation Settlement

In determining the civil penalty under section 437g(a)(6)(B), this Court should also
consider “the necessity of vindicating the authority of the responsible agency.” Comm. of 100
Democrats, 844 F. Supp. at 7; see also Furgatch, 869 F.2d at 1258 (same). Congress has
enacted and amended FECA to promote the integrity of the federal electoral process, see

24

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 30 of 52

generally McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 117-32 (2003), and it is critical to respond to
defendants’ violation with a meaningful civil penalty to reinforce the importance of FECA and
the agency that enforces it.
In addition, if FECA penalties imposed after litigation are not generally higher than those
arrived at through the statutory procedure of voluntary conciliation, the Commission’s ability to
administer and enforce the statute through the conciliation process — which is the “preferred
method of dispute resolution under FECA,” FEC v. NRA, 553 F. Supp. 1331, 1338 (D.D.C.
1983) — will be undermined. A perverse incentive could be created for parties to forego
meaningful efforts at conciliation in favor of litigation to delay liability and achieve a lesser civil
penalty. Cf. Comm. of 100 Democrats, 844 F. Supp. at 7 (“Individuals must be deterred from
using the [FECA] conciliation process as a ruse and from using the courts as a mechanism for
delay.”). Such an outcome would increase the workload of courts, which benefit from FECA’s
policy of encouraging pre-litigation settlement. Substantial civil penalties for defendants’
violations are therefore further warranted for this reason, and civil penalties totaling $140,000
would constitute an amount that would encourage future violators to enter into conciliation
agreements with the Commission.
7.

Defendants’ Purported Good Faith Does Not Warrant Penalties
Below $70,000

Defendants’ discovery responses indicate that they contend that any civil penalty should
be mitigated because they allegedly acted “with a good faith belief that they were in compliance
with federal law and regulations.” (Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s First Request for Admission and First
Set of Interrogatories at 8, FEC Exh. 6.) Defendants did produce a contemporaneous letter from
counsel during the FEC’s enforcement process (see FEC Facts ¶¶ 17, 29), but the Commission is
not seeking the maximum civil penalty here. Defendants cannot make a showing of good faith
25

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 31 of 52

sufficient to lessen their penalty further than the amounts sought here, which are already reduced
more than two-thirds below the maximum.
First, defendants failed to request an advisory opinion from the Commission on whether
their spending would comply with FECA. (FEC Facts ¶ 16.) As discussed above, supra p. 1213, Craig argued to the Commission that he had made a good faith effort to determine the
legality of his spending based on an October 4, 2007 letter he received from counsel. (Id. ¶¶ 17,
29.) But Craig’s decision to rely on the equivocal opinion of his counsel does not establish good
faith here given that he could have obtained a definitive FEC advisory opinion. Cf. United States
v. Reader’s Digest Ass’n, Inc., 662 F.2d 955, 968 (3d Cir. 1981) (finding in the circumstances of
a particular administrative proceeding that the failure to seek an agency advisory opinion was
evidence of bad faith). Had defendants requested an advisory opinion, the Commission would
have been required to issue one in 60 days. See 2 U.S.C. § 437f(a)(1); see also FEC Facts ¶ 15.
Craig’s choice not to do so is particularly noteworthy given that his counsel’s advice letter
informed him that they had “found no directly applicable FEC opinions” regarding his proposed
use of campaign funds for his Minnesota legal fees. (FEC Facts ¶ 18.) That Craig nevertheless
spent more than $216,000 in campaign funds “does not prove good faith in view of [his] failure
to utilize the appropriate administrative mechanism for obtaining [FEC] advice.” Reader’s
Digest Ass’n, Inc., 662 F.2d at 968.
Second, when defendants converted these campaign funds, they were aware of the FEC’s
Kolbe advisory opinion, which indicates that spending such as Craig’s would be considered
personal use. (FEC Facts ¶ 22.) Indeed, the October 4, 2007 advice letter cites the Kolbe
opinion, although the letter then incorrectly states that on the topic of “legal expenses stemming
from official travel,” there are “no directly applicable FEC opinions.” (Id. ¶ 18.) To the

26

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 32 of 52

contrary, as explained above, the Kolbe opinion explained that an officeholder could “not use
campaign funds to pay for . . . legal expenses” relating to an inquiry into his official travel if that
inquiry “involve[d] allegations not related to [his] duties as a Federal officeholder.” FEC AO
2006-35 (Kolbe), 2007 WL 419188, at *3. Instead of heeding the Kolbe opinion, defendants
converted campaign funds, relying upon provisions of the Constitution that have nothing to do
with the use of campaign funds. (FEC Facts ¶ 20.)17 Defendants’ “ostrich-like, head-in-the-sand
behavior” does not constitute an entirely convincing good-faith attempt to comply with the law.
Metso Minerals, Inc. v. Powerscreen Int’l Distrib. Ltd., 833 F. Supp. 2d 333, 338 (E.D.N.Y.
2011).
Third, defendants’ shifting rationales for why they assert their actions complied with
FECA also weaken their claim of good faith. The October 4, 2007 advice letter indicates that, at
the time of the expenditures at issue here, defendants thought that spending was permissible due
to the Constitution and that there were “no directly applicable FEC opinions.” (FEC Facts ¶ 18.)
Before this Court, however, defendants have conceded that the Constitution’s application is
“irrelevant” (Defs.’ Reply to Commission’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 3
(Docket No. 7)) and instead argued primarily that “no principled distinction can be drawn
between the Kolbe matter and this case” (Mem. in Supp’t of Defs.’ Mot to Dismiss at 8 (Docket
No. 3-1)). Defendants’ changing arguments suggest post-hoc rationalizations, not good faith.

17

The October 4, 2007 advice letter claims that under the Constitution’s Qualifications
Clause and Speech or Debate Clause, Craig’s travel was “a necessary incident of his status as a
U.S. Senator” (Letter from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D. Herman, Brand Law Group to the
Honorable Larry E. Craig, United States Senate at 2 (Oct. 4, 2007), FEC Exh. 5 (emphasis
added)) — an incorrect assertion that defendants appear to have abandoned before this Court.
Compare Mem. in Supp’t of Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 5 (arguing that Craig’s “trip itself was
constitutionally required”) (Docket No. 3-1) with Defs.’ Reply to Commission’s Mem. in Opp’n
to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 3 (stating that the “actual application” of the Constitution “to this
matter is irrelevant”) (Docket No. 7).
27

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 33 of 52

Finally, defendants should receive no further reduction in penalties for purported good
faith because the potential remedies defendants face under section 437g(a)(6)(B) already reflect
credit for their state of mind.18 If held liable, defendants face total potential civil penalties based
on amounts equal to their expenditures — $433,968. See 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B). Had
defendants knowingly and willfully violated the personal use ban, however, they would have
been subject to a potential civil penalty twice as large — that is, $867,936. See 2 U.S.C.
§ 437g(a)(6)(C) (authorizing a civil penalty of “the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to 200
percent of any . . . expenditure involved”). The potential civil penalty in this case therefore
already reflects a reduction for defendants’ state of mind, and the Commission requests only less
than one third of each defendant’s potential liability. The Court therefore should not further
reduce the civil penalty further based on alleged good faith.
8.

Defendants Cannot Show That Craig Would Be Unable to Disgorge
the Converted Funds and Pay an Appropriate Civil Penalty

Defendants’ discovery responses suggest that they will also argue that it would be
difficult for Craig to disgorge the funds he converted to his personal use and to pay a civil
penalty. FEC Facts ¶ 34; see also Comm. of 100 Democrats, 844 F. Supp. at 7 (citing
“defendant’s ability to pay” as a civil penalty factor). The financial documentation Craig
provided in discovery, however, indicates otherwise.19
Craig is the co-owner of a Washington, D.C.-based political consulting firm. (FEC Facts
¶ 35.g.) His net worth is more than $685,000 (id. ¶ 41), and he owns at least $629,000 in assets
18

In Furgatch, 869 F.2d at 1259 n.2, 1264, the Ninth Circuit did indicate that courts may
consider a defendant’s intent in assessing a penalty within the range permitted for FECA
violations that are not knowing and willful, although the court went on to uphold a civil penalty
of essentially 100 percent of the amount in violation.
19

The Craig Committee has now spent virtually all of its funds, so it would be unable to
pay a substantial civil penalty without disgorged funds from Craig, unless the Committee were
able to raise funds. See supra p. 17 n.11.
28

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 34 of 52

that are either liquid or could be easily liquidated (id. ¶¶ 35.a, 35.c.i-v).20 Craig has more than
$450,000 in one retirement account. (Id. ¶ 35.c.i.) The strong state of Craig’s personal finances
undermines any claim that his disgorgement or civil penalty should be mitigated.
In addition, any difficulty Craig may have in paying for his violation would be caused at
least in part by how he chose to spend the proceeds of his lawbreaking. Craig used the campaign
funds he converted to buy services, the value of which cannot be recouped, as opposed to
property that could have been liquidated. Cf. Consent Order of Forfeiture at 2-3, United States v.
Jackson, No. 13-cr-0058 (D.D.C. Aug. 19, 2013) (Docket No. 56-1) (ordering former
Congressman to forfeit specific items of personal property he purchased with campaign funds).
And Craig’s use of campaign funds in 2007 and 2008 ensured that more than $216,000 of his
own funds remained available for additional personal spending. In 2010, Craig purchased a
5,000-square-foot house sitting on two acres of land, and he later obtained a $180,000 home
equity line of credit to remodel that house. (FEC Facts ¶ 35.b.) Also in 2010, he purchased a
second boat for more than $8,000 to add to the 42-foot yacht he bought for $100,000 in 2003.
(Id. ¶ 35.d.i-ii.) And Craig did so even though months before, in May 2009, the FEC had found
reason to believe that he violated the personal use ban, putting him on notice that he could face
significant financial liability in this case. (FEC Facts ¶ 30.) Craig should not be rewarded for
any illiquidity or alleged difficulty in paying for his violation that he brought upon himself.
*

*

*

In summary, this Court should order Craig and the Craig Committee to each pay a civil
penalty of $70,000.

20

The information Craig provided in discovery indicates his and his spouse’s financial
status as of August 13, 2013. (See FEC Facts ¶ 35 & n.2.)
29

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 35 of 52

C.

This Court Should Declare that Defendants Violated the Act and Issue a
Permanent Injunction

If the Court concludes that defendants violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b) by converting
campaign funds to personal use, the Court should issue a declaration to that effect and
permanently enjoin defendants from committing any future violations of section 439a(b). See 2
U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B). Although Craig is no longer a federal officeholder, he has not stated
that he will not run for federal office again, and he is still active as a political consultant in
Washington, D.C. (FEC Facts ¶ 35.g.) An injunction would only preclude defendants from
repeating the unlawful conduct involved in this case, see Reader’s Digest Ass’n, 662 F.2d at 96970, and therefore it would not interfere with any lawful future activities of defendants.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should (1) hold that defendants violated 2 U.S.C.
§ 439a(b) and grant summary judgment in favor of the Commission; and (2) order appropriate
remedies as the Commission has proposed under 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(B).

I.

BACKGROUND
1.

The Federal Election Campaign Act (“FECA”), 2 U.S.C. §§ 431-57, bars federal

candidates and officeholders from converting campaign funds to personal use. 2 U.S.C.
§ 439a(b).
2.

Plaintiff Federal Election Commission (“Commission” or “FEC”) is an

independent agency of the United States government with exclusive jurisdiction over the
administration, interpretation, and civil enforcement of FECA. (FEC’s Complaint for Civil
Penalty, Declaratory, Injunctive, and Other Appropriate Relief (“Compl.”) ¶ 6 (Docket No. 1);
Answer ¶ 5 (Docket No. 12).)
3.

The Commission is authorized to investigate possible violations of FECA, id. §

437g(a)(1)-(2), and to initiate civil actions in the United States district courts to obtain judicial
enforcement of FECA, id. §§ 437d(e), 437g(a)(6). (Compl. ¶ 5 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 5
(Docket No. 12).)
4.

Defendant Larry Craig was a United States Senator from Idaho from January

1991 to January 2009. (Compl. ¶ 6 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 6 (Docket No. 12).)
5.

In 2007, Craig was a candidate for the United States Senate in the 2008 election,

and he authorized defendant Craig for U.S. Senate (“Craig Committee”) as his principal
campaign committee under 2 U.S.C. § 431(5)-(6). (Compl. ¶¶ 6-7 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶¶ 67 (Docket No. 12).) Accordingly, the Craig Committee was authorized to receive campaign
contributions and make expenditures on Craig’s behalf. (Compl. ¶ 7 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 7
(Docket No. 12).)
6.

Craig is a defendant in this matter in his personal capacity and in his official

capacity as treasurer of the Craig Committee. (See Minute Order dated May 1, 2013.)

II.

CRAIG WAS ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR DISTURBING THE PEACE
AND HE PLEADED GUILTY TO THAT CHARGE TWO MONTHS LATER
7.

On June 11, 2007, Craig was arrested while using a restroom at the Minneapolis-

St. Paul International Airport, where he was awaiting a scheduled flight to Washington, D.C.
(Compl. ¶ 12 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 12 (Docket No. 12); Mem. in Supp’t of Defs’ Mot. to
Dismiss at 3 (Docket No. 3-1).)
8.

Craig was charged under Minnesota law with disturbing the peace-disorderly

conduct and interference with privacy. (Compl. ¶ 12 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 12 (Docket No.
12).)
9.

About two months after being charged, Craig pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor

count of disorderly conduct on August 8, 2007. (Compl. ¶ 12 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 12
(Docket No. 12).)
III.

CRAIG SPENT MORE THAN $216,000 IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON LEGAL
EXPENSES IN AN ATTEMPT TO WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA
A.

Craig Retained Attorneys in Washington, D.C. and Minnesota in an Effort to
Withdraw His Guilty Plea

10.

Craig subsequently retained the Washington, D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill

& Brennan (“Sutherland”) and the Minnesota law firm of Kelly & Jacobson (“Kelly”) in an
effort to withdraw his guilty plea. (Compl ¶ 13 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 13 (Docket No. 12).)
11.

Attorneys at Sutherland charged Craig as much as $650 per hour for work on

Craig’s effort to withdraw his guilty plea. (See, e.g., Invoice dated Oct. 26, 2007 from
Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan LLP to Larry Craig, FEC Exhibit (“Exh.”) 1.)
12.

Attorneys at the Kelly firm charged Craig as much as $550 per hour for work on

Craig’s effort to withdraw his guilty plea. (See, e.g., Invoice dated Sept. 27, 2007 from Kelly &
Jacobson to Larry E. Craig, FEC Exh. 2.)
2

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 41 of 52

13.

On September 10, 2007, Craig filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea in

Minnesota state district court, which was denied on October 4, 2007. (Compl. ¶ 14 (Docket No.
1); Answer ¶ 14 (Docket No. 12).) Craig appealed the ruling to the Minnesota Court of Appeals,
which rejected the appeal on December 9, 2008. (Compl. ¶ 14 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 14
(Docket No. 12).)
14.

Craig’s first expenditure in connection with his effort to withdraw his guilty plea

occurred on October 29, 2007, over four months after Craig’s trip and over two-and-a-half
months after his guilty plea. (See Invoice dated Oct. 26, 2007 from Sutherland, Asbill &
Brennan LLP to Larry Craig, FEC Exh. 1; 2007 Year-End Report for Craig for U.S. Senate (Jan.
31, 2008) at Schedule B, p. 7, FEC Exh. 3;1 Compl. ¶¶ 19-20 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶¶ 19-20
(Docket No. 12).)
B.

Craig Decided to Use Campaign Funds for His Minnesota Legal Fees on the
Basis of a Letter from Counsel, Without Requesting an FEC Advisory
Opinion and While Aware of the Kolbe Advisory Opinion

15.

FECA allows a person to submit a “written request concerning the application” of

FECA or any Commission regulation “with respect to a specific transaction or activity by the
person.” 2 U.S.C. § 437f(a)(1). In response, the Commission “shall render a written opinion
relating to such transaction or activity to the person” within 60 days. Id.
16.

None of the defendants sought an advisory opinion from the Commission

regarding whether Craig could legally spend campaign funds on his legal expenses arising from
his effort to withdraw his guilty plea. See FEC, Advisory Opinion Search Page,
http://saos.nictusa.com/saos/searchao (search for “Craig” in the “Requestor or AO Name” field
reveals no advisory opinions requested by or issued to defendants).

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 42 of 52

17.

In a letter to the Commission dated December 2, 2008, Craig stated that he “did

make a good faith effort to ascertain the legality of using campaign funds for” his Minnesota
legal expenses on the basis of an October 4, 2007 letter from his counsel at the Brand Law Group
(Letter from Larry E. Craig, United States Senator to Thomasenia P. Duncan, General Counsel,
FEC (Dec. 2, 2008), FEC Exh. 4), who are also his counsel in this litigation. Craig provided the
October 4, 2007 letter to the Commission. (See Letter from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D.
Herman, Brand Law Group to the Honorable Larry E. Craig, United States Senate (Oct. 4, 2007),
FEC Exh. 5.)
18.

The October 4, 2007 letter advises Craig that he could legally use campaign funds

to pay for his representation before the Senate Ethics Committee, based, in part, on the Kolbe
advisory opinion. (Letter from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D. Herman, Brand Law Group to
The Honorable Larry E. Craig, United States Senate (Oct. 4, 2007) at 1 (citing “FEC Advisory
Opinion (“AO”) 2006-35”), FEC Exh. 5.) The October 4, 2007 letter’s next paragraph states:
“Second, although we conclude that all expenses incurred for your legal representation in
Minnesota state court are also fully payable with campaign funds, we have found no directly
applicable FEC opinions.” (Id.) The October 4, 2007 letter also states that the “FEC has
apparently never addressed legal expenses stemming from official travel.” (Id. at 2.)
19.

The October 4, 2007 letter does not mention or rely upon FEC Advisory Opinions

1997-27 (Boehner), 2000-40 (McDermott), or 2005-11 (Cunningham). (See generally Letter
from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D. Herman, Brand Law Group to the Honorable Larry E.
Craig, United States Senate (Oct. 4, 2007), FEC Exh. 5.)
20.

To support its conclusion that Craig could use campaign funds to pay for his legal

representation in Minnesota state court, the October 4, 2007 letter relies upon two provisions of

4

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 43 of 52

the United States Constitution: Clause two of Article I, section three, and clause one of Article I,
section six. (Letter from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D. Herman, Brand Law Group to The
Honorable Larry E. Craig, United States Senate (Oct. 4, 2007) at 2, FEC Exh. 5.)
21.

In support of their motion to dismiss, defendants stated to this Court that the

“actual application” of the Constitution “to this matter is irrelevant.” (Defs.’ Reply to
Commission’s Mem. In Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss at 3 (Docket No. 7).) Defendants also
argued to this Court that “no principled distinction can be drawn between the Kolbe matter and
this case.” (Mem. in Supp’t of Defs’ Mot. to Dismiss at 8 (Docket No. 3-1).)
22.

Defendants were aware of the FEC’s Kolbe advisory opinion when they spent

campaign funds on Craig’s Minnesota legal expenses. (Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s First Request for
Admission and First Set of Interrogatories at 11, FEC Exh. 6.)
C.

The Campaign Funds That Craig Spent on His Minnesota Legal Expenses
Came from His Primary Campaign Committee, Craig for U.S. Senate

23.

From October 29, 2007 through October 5, 2008, the Craig Committee paid at

least $139,952 in campaign funds to Sutherland and $77,032 in campaign funds to Kelly in
connection with Craig’s failed efforts to withdraw his guilty plea. (Compl. ¶¶ 19-20 (Docket No.
1); Answer ¶¶ 19-20 (Docket No. 12).) Thus, defendants spent a total of at least $216,984 in
campaign funds from the Craig Committee on Craig’s effort to withdraw his guilty plea.
24.

The Craig Committee reported receiving $318,180 in total contributions in 2007

and 2008. See FEC, Candidate and Committee Viewer,
http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml (search for “C00115667” in the
“Partial Name, Partial ID or Complete Image Number” field reveals disclosure information for
Craig for U.S. Senate, including two-year summary information from 2000 to present). Those
contributions were made to the Craig Committee by at least 107 individuals and 108 political

committees. (Id.)
IV.

CRAIG ADMITTED TO THE SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE THAT HIS
ARREST WAS FOR PURELY PERSONAL CONDUCT UNRELATED TO HIS
OFFICEHOLDER DUTIES
25.

The United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics (“Senate Ethics

Committee”) conducted an inquiry into Craig’s conduct in connection with his arrest, conviction,
and subsequent conduct. (Compl. ¶ 16 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 16 (Docket No. 12).)
26.

The Brand Law Group in Washington, D.C. — which represents defendants in

this matter — also represented Craig before the Senate Ethics Committee. (Compl. ¶ 21 (Docket
No. 1); Answer ¶ 21 (Docket No. 12).) In a September 5, 2007, letter to the Senate Ethics
Committee, Craig’s counsel argued that the Senate Ethics Committee should not exercise
jurisdiction over the matter because Craig’s arrest and conviction was for “‘purely personal
conduct unrelated to the performance of official Senate duties.’” (Compl. ¶ 22 (Docket No. 1)
(quoting Letter from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D. Herman, Brand Law Group to the
Honorable Barbara Boxer, Chairwoman, Senate Select Committee on Ethics (Sept. 5, 2007),
FEC Exh. 7); Answer ¶ 22 (Docket No. 12).)
27.

On February 13, 2008, the Senate Ethics Committee issued a “Public Letter of

Admonition” unanimously concluding that, among other matters, Craig had not complied with
Senate Rule 38.2, which requires Senate Ethics Committee approval of any payments for legal
expenses paid with funds of a principal campaign committee. (Compl. ¶ 23 (Docket No. 1);
Answer ¶ 23 (Docket No. 12).) Specifically, the Ethics Committee wrote:
[T]he Senate Ethics Manual states that “Members, officers or employees
may pay legal expenses incurred in connection with their official duties
with funds of a Senator’s principal campaign committee, but only if such
payment is approved by the Committee.” . . . It appears that you have used
over $213,000 in campaign funds to pay legal (and, apparently, “public
relations”) fees in connection with your appeal of your criminal conviction
6

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 45 of 52

and in connection with the preliminary inquiry before the Committee in
this matter. It appears that some portion of these expenses may not be
deemed to have been incurred in connection with your official duties,
either by the Committee or by the Federal Election Commission (which
has concurrent jurisdiction with the Committee on the issue of conversion
of a Senator’s campaign funds to personal use).

(Feb. 13, 2008) (Select Committee on Ethics), http://www.ethics.senate.gov/downloads/

V.

THE COMMISSION FOUND PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT
DEFENDANTS VIOLATED FECA’S BAN ON PERSONAL USE
28.

On November 10, 2008, the Commission received an administrative complaint

alleging that Craig had violated FECA by spending campaign funds to pay legal fees and
expenses incurred in connection with his arrest and conviction. (Compl. ¶ 24 (Docket No. 1);
Answer ¶ 24 (Docket No. 12).) The complaint was designated by the Commission as Matter
Under Review (“MUR”) 6128 for administrative purposes. (Compl. ¶ 24 (Docket No. 1);
Answer ¶ 24 (Docket No. 12).)
29.

By letter dated November 18, 2008, the Commission notified defendants that the

administrative complaint had been filed and provided defendants with a copy. Craig responded
to the Commission on December 2, 2008. (Compl. ¶ 25 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 25 (Docket
No. 12).) In that response, Craig claimed that he did not violate FECA, and that he acted in good
faith on the basis of a letter from his counsel, dated October 4, 2007, which Craig attached.
(Letter from Larry E. Craig, United States Senator to Thomasenia P. Duncan, General Counsel,
FEC (Dec. 2, 2008), FEC Exh. 4; Letter from Stanley M. Brand and Andrew D. Herman, Brand
Law Group to the Honorable Larry E. Craig, United States Senate (Oct. 4, 2007), FEC Exh. 5.)
30.

After reviewing the then-available information, on May 19, 2009, the

Commission voted 5-0 (with one Commissioner recused) to find “reason to believe” that
7

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 46 of 52

defendants had violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b). (Compl. ¶ 26 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 26 (Docket
No. 12).) The Commission notified defendants of its reason-to-believe determination by letter
dated June 30, 2009. (Compl. ¶ 27 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 27 (Docket No. 12).) Defendants
responded by letter dated August 10, 2009. (Compl. ¶ 24 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 24 (Docket
No. 12).)
31.

Following an investigation, the Commission’s General Counsel notified

defendants by letter dated April 8, 2011, that the General Counsel was prepared to recommend
that the Commission find “probable cause” to believe that defendants violated 2 U.S.C.
§ 439a(b). (Compl. ¶ 28 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 28 (Docket No. 12).) The General Counsel
also provided defendants with a brief stating the position of the General Counsel on the legal and
factual issues of the case. (Compl. ¶ 28 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 28 (Docket No. 12).)
The defendants filed a response with the Commission dated April 25, 2011 (Compl. ¶ 24 (Docket
No. 1); Answer ¶ 24 (Docket No. 12)), and counsel for defendants appeared at a probable cause
hearing before the Commission on May 25, 2011 (see FEC’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to
Dismiss, Exh. B (Docket No. 5-2)). After reviewing the information available, on February 7,
2012, the Commission voted 5-0 to find probable cause to believe that defendants had violated
2 U.S.C. § 439a(b). (Compl. ¶ 29 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 29 (Docket No. 12).)
32.

The Commission notified all of the defendants of its February 7 findings by letter

dated February 22, 2012, and, as FECA requires, for a period of not less than 30 days,
endeavored to correct the violations through informal methods of conference, conciliation, and
persuasion. (Compl. ¶ 30 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 30 (Docket No. 12).) Unable to secure
acceptable conciliation agreements with the defendants, on May 3, 2012, the Commission voted
5-0 to authorize filing this suit against defendants. (Compl. ¶ 30 (Docket No. 1); Answer ¶ 30

8

Case 1:12-cv-00958-ABJ Document 16 Filed 09/30/13 Page 47 of 52

(Docket No. 12).)
33.

The Commission filed this action on June 11, 2012, pursuant to its authority under

2 U.S.C. §§ 437d(a)(6), 437g(a)(6)(A). (See Compl. (Docket No. 1).)
VI.

CRAIG CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT HE IS UNABLE TO DISGORGE
THE CONVERTED FUNDS OR PAY A CIVIL PENALTY
34.

Defendants intend to argue that it would be difficult or impossible for Craig to

disgorge the funds he converted to his personal use and to pay a civil penalty, if the Court were
to determine that defendants violated 2 U.S.C. § 439a(b). (Defs.’ Resp. to Pl.’s First Request for
Admission and First Set of Interrogatories at 5-7, FEC Exh. 6.)
35.
