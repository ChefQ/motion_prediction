demonstrate that The Deal purposefully and voluntarily directed its activities toward New

The Deal Solicited Dartmouth’s
Dartmouth's Subscription

As part of their jurisdictional discovery, Plaintiffs requested that The Deal describe in

detail the circumstances by which The Deal entered into its agreements with Dartmouth.

This continuing and active solicitation is exactly of the kind that demonstrates purposeful
availment. See Sinatra v. Nat’l

It is disingenuous for The Deal to now treat the Dartmouth subscription as a single
subscription, when it clearly saw it as a contract with, and gateway to, more than 7,000 New
Hampshire residents.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Defendants failed to cite a single case that supports their position that
Plaintiffs must show that someone in the forum saw the defamatory Articles.
Lest there be any mistake, the defamatory Articles remain in circulation in New
Hampshire as a result of The Deal’s
Deal's activities in the forum.

The damage to Plaintiffs in New Hampshire is therefore manifest and continuing.
