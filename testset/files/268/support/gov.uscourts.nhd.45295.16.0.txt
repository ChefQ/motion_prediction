CASE NO. 1:16-CV-00545
Hon. Joseph Normand Laplante

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), defendants The Deal LLC and
William Meagher (collectively, the “Defendants”), move to dismiss the complaint (the
“Complaint”) filed in the above-referenced action by plaintiffs Scottsdale Capital Advisors Corp.
and John Hurry (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) for lack of personal jurisdiction.
The Complaint contains no allegations that connect any of Plaintiffs’ New Hampshire tort
claims with New Hampshire. Since there are no specific and concrete allegations of contacts
between this lawsuit and New Hampshire, constitutional principles of Due Process preclude the
exercise of personal jurisdiction over Defendants in this case.
In support of their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants submit the annexed Memorandum of
Law, the Declaration of Eric Lundberg, the Declaration of William Meagher, with exhibits, and
the Declaration of John M. Browning, counsel for Defendants, with exhibits.
Wherefore, Defendants pray the Court to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety.
DATED: February 2, 2017
Respectfully submitted,
The Deal, LLC and William Meagher
By Their Attorneys:
SHAHEEN & GORDON, P.A.
