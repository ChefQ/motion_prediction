INTRODUCTION
In 1981, a New York resident named Keeton brought a libel suit in New Hampshire
against Hustler Magazine, Inc., located in Ohio. New Hampshire had no connection to the case
other than Hustler’s distribution of the libelous statements about Keeton to New Hampshire
residents. The U.S. Supreme Court held that New Hampshire had personal jurisdiction over the
case, and rejected Hustler’s arguments (the same arguments by the defendants in this action) that
there was no meaningful connection to New Hampshire. In Keeton v. Hustler, none of the
parties resided in the New Hampshire, and the magazine’s circulation in the state amounted to
less than one percent of its total circulation in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court still
upheld jurisdiction, holding that Hustler’s regular monthly sales in New Hampshire “cannot by
any stretch of the imagination be characterized as random, isolated, or fortuitous. It is, therefore,
unquestionable that New Hampshire jurisdiction over a complaint based on those contacts would
ordinarily satisfy the requirement of the Due Process Clause that a State's assertion of personal
jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant be predicated on ‘minimum contacts’ between the
defendant and the State.” Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770 (1984).
Defendants here are reprising the same arguments that the U.S. Supreme Court
unanimously rejected more than 30 years ago in Keeton v. Hustler, and Defendants’ arguments
should fail for the same reasons. In particular, Defendants’ argument that less than one percent
of their subscribers are in New Hampshire is of no consequence, because Defendants have
continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market, must therefore
reasonably anticipate being haled into court here in a libel action based on the contents of their
publication. Keeton, 465 U.S. at 781.

{00078077;1}

1

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 6 of 23

Similarly, Defendants’ argument regarding Plaintiffs’ purported lack of contacts with
New Hampshire also is without merit. A Plaintiff is not required to have “minimum contacts”
with New Hampshire in order for New Hampshire to assert personal jurisdiction over a
nonresident defendant. Id. at 779.
Defendants also make a number of extraneous and fanciful allegations regarding
Plaintiffs’ alleged motives for suing in New Hampshire, including claims that Plaintiffs are
seeking to “coerce Defendants into giving up their source[s]” and that Plaintiffs are trying to take
advantage of New Hampshire’s statute of limitations. These arguments are red herrings designed
to distract the Court from another of Keeton’s holdings: that “applying New Hampshire’s statute
of limitations to all aspects of this nationwide suit has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the
Court to adjudicate the claims. ‘The issue is personal jurisdiction, not choice of law.’” Id. at 778
(quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 254 (1958)).
Finally, personal jurisdiction also is present under the holding of Manufacturing Co. v.
Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119, 1124 (W.D. Pa. 1997) (“Zippo”). Defendants here sold
subscriptions to their online website in New Hampshire, and therefore entered into at least one
contract in New Hampshire. Defendants were “clearly doing business” in New Hampshire, and
its contacts were neither “fortuitous” nor “coincidental.” Id. at 1124, 1127. In fact, the object of
Defendants’ contract in New Hampshire was to transmit to New Hampshire the online news site
on which the defamatory articles that form the basis of this suit appeared. Id. at 1127.
In sum, Defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting
activities within New Hampshire. Consequently, there is no unfairness in calling them to answer
for those activities in the state.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

This Lawsuit
On December 6, 2013, an article written by Mr. Meagher appeared in Deal Pipeline, an

online publication of defendant The Deal, headlined “FBI, securities officials investigating
Scottsdale Capital, Alpine Securities, source says” (“December 6 Article”). (Motion, Meagher
Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. A). The December 6 Article falsely stated that Plaintiffs and their affiliated
companies were being criminally investigated and being investigated by securities regulators.
The December 6 Article further falsely stated that Plaintiffs engaged in favoritism towards
shareholders of a company named Biozoom, including by allowing them to trade in violation of
SCA policies and giving them special perks. The December 6 Article also falsely stated that
Plaintiffs ignored “red flags” with respect to Biozoom transactions.
On March 20, 2014, an article written by Mr. Meagher appeared in Deal Pipeline
headlined “SEC requests default judgment in $34M Biozoom pump-and-dump case” (“March 20
Article”). (Motion, Meagher Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. B). The March 20 Article falsely stated that
Plaintiffs and their affiliated companies were being investigated by the FBI, and were the targets
of criminal and securities investigations. The March 20 Article also falsely stated that Plaintiffs
were involved in a “pump and dump” scheme with Biozoom.1
On April 16, 2014, an article written by Mr. Meagher appeared in Deal Pipeline
headlined “FINRA focusing on money-laundering violations” (“April 16 Article”). (Motion,

“In a typical ‘pump and dump’ scheme, insiders inflate demand for a stock by disseminating
laudatory information about a company – information that is usually false. If the market reacts
favorably, the insiders cash in their shares before the market readjusts and the share price
collapses. Garvey v. Arkoosh, 354 F. Supp. 2d 73, 76 (D. Mass. 2005).

Meagher Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. C). The April 16 Article repeated the false claim that Plaintiffs and
their affiliated companies were under FBI investigation.
Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in New Hampshire on November 18, 2016, asserting causes of
action against Defendants for defamation, invasion of privacy—false light, intentional
interference with contractual relations, and tortious interference with prospective economic
advantage.
B.

Defendants’ Contacts With New Hampshire2
Defendant The Deal is a Delaware limited liability company that publishes print and

electronic publications concerning the financial sector, including The DealFlow Report
(“DealFlow”) and The Deal Pipeline (“Deal Pipeline”). Defendant Meagher is a staff writer and
associate editor at The Deal. (Susman Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1). Evidence proffered by Defendants,
and supplemented herein (based entirely on publicly available information and prior to any
jurisdictional discovery), demonstrates that Defendants purposefully injected themselves into
New Hampshire in order to reap an economic benefit.

2

Defendants improperly try to separate Mr. Meagher from The Deal, alleging that each
defendant’s contacts with the forum state should be assessed individually. (Motion at p. 14). As
an initial matter, the case Defendants cite for this proposition, Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783
(1984), concerned the “effects test,” and whether the defendant targeted the particular forum. Id.
at 789. As discussed infra, personal jurisdiction in this matter does not arise under Calder.
Second, courts in this district have routinely held that the author of a published work is treated
the same as the publisher for personal jurisdiction purposes. See e.g., Brother Records, Inc. v.
Harpercollins Publishers, 141 N.H. 322, 326-28 (1996) (authors of book are subject to personal
jurisdiction because they “are directly responsible for its content” and they “knew the book
would be distributed and sold nationally, and [] stood to profit from the sale of books in New
Hampshire.”); Gray v. St. Martin's Press, Inc., 929 F. Supp. 40, 48 (D.N.H. 1996) (“By
executing a contract with a national publisher for the national and international distribution of a
book with nationwide appeal, [defendant who authored book] should reasonably have anticipated
being haled into court in New Hampshire, a forum regularly served by [publisher] and one in
which the book was actually sold.”).
{00078077;1}

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 9 of 23

According to Defendants, Deal Pipeline is available on a subscription-only basis.
(Motion p. 6). These subscribers receive, among other things: “actionable, intraday coverage of
mergers, acquisitions and all other changes in corporate control to institutional investors, private
equity, hedge funds and the firms that serve them.” (Susman Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2). Subscribers also
receive “immediate access to our up-to-the-minute news, data and information. News, video,
webcasts, podcasts, events and whitepapers, [t]opical newsletters target[ing] specific niches to
form a holistic reach across the breadth of the deal community.” (Susman Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 3).
According to Defendants, articles on Deal Pipeline “sit behind a paywall and are
available only to authorized subscribers.” (Motion, Lundberg Decl. ¶ 10). The Deal assigns
authentication codes to their subscribers. (Motion, Lundberg Decl. ¶ 11). In addition to making
content available through Deal Pipeline, The Deal also distributes newsletters to their
subscribers. To be clear: the only way to access articles on Deal Pipeline is to enter into a
contract with The Deal.
According to Defendants, there were approximately 670 subscribers to Deal Pipeline
during the relevant timeframe, including one subscriber in New Hampshire, Dartmouth College.
(Motion, Lundberg Decl. ¶¶ 13, 14). Accordingly, at the time the defamatory articles were
published and distributed on Deal Pipeline, Defendants were in a contractual relationship with a
New Hampshire resident that expressly provided that resident with the defamatory articles.
ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standards for Challenges to Personal Jurisdiction
New Hampshire’s long arm statute confers jurisdiction over non-resident defendants who

themselves or through an agent commit a tortious act in New Hampshire. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §
510:4(I); Hugel v. McNell, 886 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989). The New Hampshire long-arm statute

{00078077;1}

5

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 10 of 23

is coextensive with the limits of personal jurisdiction set by the Due Process clause of the
Constitution. Weld Power Indus., Inc. v. C.S.I. Techs., Inc., 124 N.H. 121, 125 (1983).
“When a district court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction
without holding an evidentiary hearing, as in this case, the ‘prima facie’ standard governs its
determination.” United States v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd., 274 F.3d 610, 618 (1st Cir. 2001).
“In deciding whether the plaintiff has proved a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction,
the district court must draw all reasonable inferences arising from the proof, and resolve all
factual disputes, in the plaintiff’s favor.” Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins.
Co., 267 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).
Determining whether a plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts for a finding of specific
jurisdiction requires a three-part analysis: (1) whether the defendant’s contacts constitute
purposeful availment of the benefits and protections afforded by the forum’s laws; (2) whether
the claim that undergirds the litigation directly relates to or arises out of the defendant’s contacts
with the forum, and (3) the overall reasonableness of an exercise of jurisdiction in light of a
variety of pertinent factors that touch upon the fundamental fairness of an exercise of
jurisdiction. Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard Phillips Fund, 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir. 1999).
B.

This Court Has Personal Jurisdiction Over Defendants
1.

Defendants Purposefully Availed Themselves To Personal
Jurisdiction In New Hampshire.
a.

Defendants Purposefully Availed Themselves Under Keeton v.
Hustler

Pursuant to established personal jurisdiction cases, there is more than ample evidence
here of Defendants’ minimum contacts with New Hampshire. In Keeton v. Hustler, the U.S.
Supreme Court held that jurisdiction is proper over a publisher who “produces a national

{00078077;1}

6

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 11 of 23

publication aimed at a nationwide audience” with respect to a libel claim brought by a nonresident plaintiff. See also Burger King Corp. v. Rodzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 473 (1985)
(explaining that Keeton holds that a “publisher who distributes magazines in a distant state may
fairly be held accountable in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly
defamatory story”). This is true even where “only a small portion” of copies of the publisher’s
publication were distributed within the forum state. Keeton, 465 U.S. at 775.
In Keeton, a New York resident brought a libel suit in New Hampshire, against Hustler
Magazine, Inc., an Ohio corporation. A small number of copies of Hustler magazine (10,000 to
15,000 per month) were distributed in New Hampshire. Keeton, 465 U.S. at 772. This was less
than one percent (1%) of Hustler’s circulation at the time. Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 131
N.H. 6, 9 (1988). The United States Supreme Court held that Hustler’s “regular circulation” of
its publication in New Hampshire was sufficient to support assertion of jurisdiction. Keeton, 465
U.S. at 773-74.
The U.S. Supreme Court expressly found that such regular distribution could not “by any
stretch of the imagination be characterized as random, isolated, or fortuitous” and it was
“unquestionable that New Hampshire jurisdiction over a complaint based on those contacts
would ordinarily satisfy the requirement of the Due Process Clause that a State’s assertion of the
personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant be predicated on ‘minimum contacts’ between
the defendant and the State.” Id. at 774. Because Hustler was “carrying on a ‘part of its general
business’ in New Hampshire,” this was “sufficient to support jurisdiction when a cause action
arose out of the very activity being conducted.” Id. at 779-80.
In so finding, the Court said that New Hampshire had a “significant interest” in
redressing injuries that occurred within the state, including injuries in libel actions brought by

{00078077;1}

7

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 12 of 23

nonresidents against nonresidents. Id. at 776. “False statements of fact harm both the subject of
the falsehood and the readers of the statement.” Id. A state “may rightly employ its libel laws to
discourage deception of its citizens” and to address “the injury that in-state libel causes within
[the state] to a nonresident.” Id. “The communication of the libel may create a negative
reputation among the residents of a jurisdiction where the plaintiff’s previous reputation was,
however small, at least unblemished.” Id.
Based on Defendants’ substantial contacts with this forum through its subscriber(s), New
Hampshire has a legitimate interest in holding Defendants answerable to Plaintiffs’ claims based
upon the posting of the defamatory articles on Deal Pipeline. As in Keeton, New Hampshire has
a “significant interest” in redressing injuries that occur within the State, including injuries in this
libel action brought by nonresidents against nonresidents.
Defendants’ attempt to analogize its conduct to defendants who engaged in minimal
distribution in the forum state fails for another reason as well—Keeton did not establish a
threshold of subscribers (in either raw numbers or percentage of total subscribers) in the forum
state in order to exercise personal jurisdiction. In Keeton, Hustler’s distribution of between
10,000 and 15,000 of its magazine constituted approximately one percent (1%) of its total
circulation (Keeton, 131 N.H. at 9), and was sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over
defendant. Keeton, 465 U.S. at 774. Looking at raw numbers, the court in Wolfe v. Gooding &
Co., 2015 WL 917311 at *3 (D.N.J. Mar. 15, 2015) upheld personal jurisdiction under Keeton
based on the distribution of just 55 copies of a publication in the forum state.3 As the Court of

3

Defendants conflate the Keeton test with another case, Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984),
which holds that the plaintiff’s residence is a sufficient contact for specific jurisdiction in a libel
case, because the defamatory communication injured the plaintiff in the forum state. Plaintiffs
are not making a Calder claim here; Plaintiffs are not residents of New Hampshire. Plaintiffs are
{00078077;1}

8

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 13 of 23

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded, “mailing to regular subscribers, even though few,” may
amount to purposeful availment because such mailing “is not random or fortuitous and is not
even necessarily isolated.” Gordy v. Daily News, L.P., 95 F.3d 829, 833 (9th Cir. 1996).
Defendants entered into ongoing business relationship with a New Hampshire resident,
New Hampshire therefore has a significant interest in redressing the harm caused in the forum
that resulted from that relationship.
b.

Personal Jurisdiction Exists Under Zippo.

Personal jurisdiction is also present under the test enunciated by Zippo Manufacturing
Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119, 1124 (W.D. Pa. 1997) (“Zippo”). Under Zippo,
personal jurisdiction over the operators of interactive websites is determined by “examining the
level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the
Web site.” Id. “[T]he Zippo model does not supersede the traditional personal jurisdiction
analysis, it merely compliments [sic] it.” Eagle Coffee Co. v. Eagle Coffee International, Inc.,
2010 WL 481201 at *3 (D. Md. Feb. 4, 2010).
Zippo established a “sliding scale” test to evaluate a defendant’s contacts with a forum
state when the defendant’s only contacts are through a website. Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at 1124.
The Zippo test outlined three basic designations for contacts with the forum state: (1) Clearly
Doing Business: “If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction

making a Keeton claim (and a Zippo claim), which turns on the distribution of the defendant’s
publication in the jurisdiction, not the targeting of harm towards the plaintiff residing in the
jurisdiction. In their Motion, Defendants extensively discuss Reynolds v. InVivo Therapeutics
Holdings Corp., No. 16-CV-384-JL, 2016 WL 6997489 (D.N.H. Nov. 30, 2016), which is a
Calder case, not a Keeton case. Defendants do not cite any authority for the proposition that the
analysis in Reynolds applies to Keeton claims.
{00078077;1}

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 14 of 23

that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the Internet, personal
jurisdiction is proper.” (2) The Middle Ground: “occupied by interactive Web sites where a
user can exchange information with the host computer. In these cases, the exercise of jurisdiction
is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of
information that occurs on the Web site.” (3) Passive Website: “situations where a defendant
has simply posted information on an Internet Web site which is accessible to users in foreign
jurisdictions . . .[D]oes little more than make information available to those who are interested in
it, [so] it is not grounds for the exercise personal jurisdiction.” Id.
Over and over again, courts have consistently held that a subscription-based website falls
within the first category, and personal jurisdiction is proper. See e.g., Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at
1126; American Network, Inc. v. Access America/Connect Atlanta, Inc., 975 F. Supp. 494, 499
(S. D. N. Y. 1997); Sefton v. Jew, 201 F. Supp. 2d 730, 741 (W. D. Tex. 2001).
In Zippo, the defendant operated an online news service, which had three levels of
membership ranging from free/public information to exclusive subscription-only information.
Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at 1121. Defendant had approximately 140,000 paying subscribers, of
whom approximately 3,000 were located in Pennsylvania. Id. These subscribers entered into
contracts with defendant, for which they received a password to access defendant’s online news
services. Id. The court held that personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania was proper over
defendant because it purposefully availed itself of doing business in the forum. Id. at 1125-26.
[Defendant] was under no obligation to sell its services to
Pennsylvania residents. It freely chose to do so, presumably in
order to profit from those transactions. If a corporation determines
that the risk of being subject to personal jurisdiction in a particular
forum is too great, it can choose to sever its connection to the
state. If [defendant] had not wanted to be amenable to jurisdiction
in Pennsylvania, the solution would have been simple—it could
have chosen not to sell its services to Pennsylvania residents.
{00078077;1}

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 15 of 23

Id. at 1126-27.
The case of Conlin Enterprise Corp. v. SNEWS, LLC, 2008 WL 803041 (D. Utah March
24, 2008) is instructive. In Conlin Enterprise, the defendant published an online trade
newsletter, and the only thing that could be purchased on defendant’s website was a subscription
to the online trade newsletter. Id. Defendants were not Utah residents and had no Utah
employees, no place of business in Utah, no Utah bank accounts, no Utah phone or fax numbers,
no Utah mailing address, and no Utah agents. Id. There were however, sixty (60) subscribers to
the newsletter in Utah. The Court held that it could exercise personal jurisdiction over
Defendants because:
[Defendants] engaged in at least sixty commercial transactions in
Utah when individuals subscribed to [Defendants’] newsletter. . . .
Selling subscriptions to the newsletter is a commercial transaction.
. . . This is doing business in the forum state.
Id. at *6.
Paraphrasing Zippo, the court held:
[Defendant] repeatedly and consciously chose to process Utah
residents’ applications and to assign them passwords. [Defendant]
knew that the result of these contracts would be the transmission of
electronic messages into Utah. The transmission of these files was
entirely within its control. Defendant was under no obligation to
sell its services to Utah residents. If [defendant] had not wanted to
be amenable to jurisdiction in Utah, the solution would have been
simple – it could have chosen not to sell its services to Utah
residents.

Id. at *6 (internal quotes and citations omitted).
The holdings in Zippo and Conlin Enterprise are directly on point here: The Deal
repeatedly and consciously chose to process a New Hampshire resident’s application and to
assign it a subscription. The Deal knew that the result of this contract would be the transmission
{00078077;1}

11

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 16 of 23

of electronic messages into New Hampshire. The transmission of these files was entirely within
its control. The Deal was under no obligation to sell its services to a New Hampshire resident. It
freely chose to do so, presumably to make a profit from the transaction(s). If The Deal did not
want to be haled into court in New Hampshire, it could easily have chose not to sell its services
to a New Hampshire resident.
The Deal purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in New
Hampshire; it is therefore subject to personal jurisdiction in the state.

The Number of New Hampshire Subscribers Is Irrelevant

The gravamen of Defendants’ argument is that they only have one subscriber in New
Hampshire, and the exercise of personal is somehow “random” or “fortuitous.” This species of
argument has been made time and again by internet defendants trying to escape personal
jurisdiction in forums where they conducted business. Time and again, these arguments have
been rejected by the courts, because courts evaluate “the nature and quality of commercial
activity that an entity conducts over the Internet” not the quantity of the contacts. Zippo, 952 F.
Supp. at 1124.
In Zippo, the defendant argued that only two percent (2%) of its online news subscribers
were residents of the forum state. Id. at 1127. The Court was decisive in rejecting this
argument:
Defendant points to the fact that only two percent of its subscribers
are Pennsylvania residents. However, the Supreme Court has
made clear that even a single contact can be sufficient. McGee v.
International Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223 (1957). The
test has always focused on the “nature and quality” of the contacts
with the forum and not the quantity of those contacts.
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 320 (1945).
The Sixth Circuit also rejected a similar argument in CompuServe
when it wrote that the contacts were “deliberate and repeated even

{00078077;1}

12

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 17 of 23

if they yielded little revenue.” CompuServe, Inc. v. Patterson, 89
F.3d 1257, 1265 (6th Cir.1996).

Id. (emphasis added).
Similarly, in Sefton, defendants argued that their website did not target Texas residents
and that Texas residents represented only 1.86% of their subscribers. Sefton, 201 F. Supp. 2d at
740. The court found this argument “unpersuasive.” Id. “The minimum contacts test focuses
on the ‘nature and quality’ of the contacts with the forum, not the quantity of those contacts.” Id.
As discussed above, in Conlin Enterprise, the defendant published an online trade
newsletter with approximately 5,000 subscribers worldwide, of whom approximately 60 resided
in Utah – i.e., 1.2%. Conlin Enterprise, 2008 WL 803041*1. Again, the Court held that these 60
transactions constituted doing business in Utah. Id.
Here, Defendants had less than 670 subscribers worldwide, one of whom was in New
Hampshire. This one subscription was not random or fortuitous: The Deal deliberately and
repeatedly entered into a subscription contract with Dartmouth College, even if it yielded little
revenue. Defendants therefore cannot say that they did not target New Hampshire, because they
expressly, knowingly, entered into an ongoing contract with one of its residents.
Under both Keeton and Zippo, it is indisputable that Defendants conducted business in
New Hampshire and purposefully availed themselves of the benefits and protections afforded by
the New Hampshire’s laws. The Court should therefore exercise personal jurisdiction over
Defendants.

This Action Arises From Defendants’ New Hampshire Related
Activities

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims do not arise out of Defendants’ contacts with
New Hampshire. Nonsense. “The tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the offending
{00078077;1}

13

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 18 of 23

material is circulated. The reputation of the libel victim may suffer harm even in a state in which
he has hitherto been anonymous.” Keeton, 465 U.S. at 777 (citing Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 577A, Comment a (1977)).
Moreover, Defendants willingly and knowingly entered into a subscription contract with
a New Hampshire resident that provided New Hampshire residents with access to Deal Pipeline
– the subscription-based website and newsletter on which the defamatory articles appeared. As
the U.S. Supreme Court in Keeton held: “respondent is carrying on a ‘part of its general
business’ in New Hampshire, and that is sufficient to support jurisdiction when the cause of
action arises out of the very activity being conducted, in part, in New Hampshire.” Keeton, 465
U.S. at 779-80.
In Conlin Enterprise, the Court examined similar facts regarding an online subscriptionbased newsletter and similar causes of actions for defamation and interference with contractual
relations. Conlin Enterprise, 2008 WL 803041*7 The Court held:
The relevant contacts with Utah are the Internet subscriptions
through [defendant’s] website. The cause of action arises out of the
contacts with Utah because those Utah subscribers had access to
the purportedly defamatory article. Not only is the defamatory
article the source of the harm, its explicit purpose was to harm the
Plaintiffs who are Utah residents.
Id.
Plaintiffs’ contacts arise from Defendants’ New Hampshire related activities—a
subscription agreement between Defendants and a New Hampshire resident.4

Defendants’ attempt to analogize the facts of this case to Christian v. Barricade Books, Inc.,
No. CIV. 02-408-B, 2003 WL 21146168 (D.N.H. May 15, 2003) to argue a lack of relatedness to
New Hampshire fails because it ignores the ongoing business relationship Defendants have in
this jurisdiction. In Christian, the court found the relatedness requirement was not satisfied
because the one book that was shipped to the New Hampshire bookstore was not sold and was
returned to the defendant. Id. at *3. In other words, no sale was consummated and the defendant

3.

The Exercise Of Personal Jurisdiction In New Hampshire Is
Reasonable

The final prong for exercising personal jurisdiction over Defendants concerns whether
the exercise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable. Phillips Exeter Acad., 196 F.3d at 288. The
“reasonableness” prong exists to protect defendants against unfairly inconvenient litigation
(World–Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980)), and the exercise of
jurisdiction is reasonable if it does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial
justice.” Int'l Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at 316. When determining the reasonableness of a particular
forum, the Supreme Court has identified five “gestalt factors,” namely: “(1) the defendant’s
burden of appearing, (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff’s
interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining
the most effective resolution of the controversy, and (5) the common interests of all sovereigns in
promoting substantive social policies.” Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 209
(1st Cir. 1994) (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477). Defendants have the burden to show that,
in light of these factors, defending the suit in this court would be “so gravely difficult and

did not receive any profits from a New Hampshire resident. Defendants herein however, are in
fact receiving an ongoing economic benefit from a New Hampshire resident vis-à-vis their
subscription contract with Dartmouth. Defendants’ reliance on United States v. Swiss Am. Bank,
Ltd., 274 F.3d 610 (1st Cir. 2001) is similarly unavailing. There, the court found that relatedness
was not satisfied because the defendant, a foreign based bank, did not reach into the forum since
it did not call or write to the customer at issue. Id. at 622. Only after making this finding did the
court note that the funds at issue came from a foreign location rather than from the United States.
Id. Defendants’ reliance on this case again ignores the subscription agreement with Dartmouth
and the fact that they called and emailed Dartmouth to negotiate the agreement and continue to
perform “client service work” for Dartmouth via telephone phone and email. (Motion p. 5).
Based on these facts, the court in Swiss Am. Bank would have undoubtedly found that
Defendants reached into this forum regardless of where Dartmouth’s payments originate from.
{00078077;1}

15

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 20 of 23

inconvenient” that they would be at a “severe disadvantage” in comparison to the Plaintiffs.
Burger King, 471 U.S. at 478. Defendants have not met this burden.
New Hampshire has an interest in adjudicating this dispute. A State’s interest in
adjudicating a dispute extends to libel actions brought by nonresidents because libel harms both
the subject of the falsehood and the readers of the statement. Thus “New Hampshire may rightly
employ its libel laws to discourage the deception of its citizens,” even to remedy “the injury that
in-state libel causes within New Hampshire.” Brother Records, Inc., 141 N.H. at 328 (citing
Keeton, 465 U.S. at 776.
This principle applies to the facts of this case: That the parties have no apparent
connections to New Hampshire does not mean that Plaintiffs did not suffer injury in New
Hampshire. The defendants, all of whom had a direct hand in the writing and publication of the
defamatory articles must reasonably anticipate being haled into court in a libel action where
injury to the targeted plaintiffs can be expected to occur, which in this case included New
Hampshire. Buckley v. McGraw–Hill, Inc., 762 F. Supp. 430, 438–39 (D.N.H. 1991).
Plaintiffs’ interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief necessitates that the
matter be heard in New Hampshire. Perhaps not surprisingly, Defendants relegate their
argument regarding this factor to a single footnote. (Motion p. 25). This, however, may be the
most important of the gestalt factors. Because of New York’s draconian one-year statute of
limitations for libel (N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215(3)), Plaintiffs’ claims would be barred if brought there.
As is their right, Plaintiffs have brought their claims in New Hampshire because it is one of the
only jurisdictions in which they can obtain relief for their claims.

{00078077;1}

16

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 21 of 23

The facts and holding in Keeton are instructive. In Keeton, plaintiff’s claims were barred
by the statute of limitations in every single state except New Hampshire. Keeton, 465 U.S. at
773. The Supreme Court, rightfully, put the onus on defendant, holding:
Petitioner's successful search for a State with a lengthy statute of
limitations is no different from the litigation strategy of countless
plaintiffs who seek a forum with favorable substantive or
procedural rules or sympathetic local populations. Certainly
Hustler Magazine, Inc., which chose to enter the New Hampshire
market, can be charged with knowledge of its laws and no doubt
would have claimed the benefit of them if it had a complaint
against a subscriber, distributor, or other commercial partner.

Id. at 779.
Defendants’ burden of appearing in New Hampshire is a red herring. According to
Defendants, Defendants are based in California and New York, and it would supposedly impose
a burden to litigate in New Hampshire. (Motion at p. 24). However, even if Plaintiffs brought
this action in California or New York (or in Plaintiffs’ home state of Arizona), at least one of the
Defendants would be required to travel cross-country. “[D]efending in a foreign jurisdiction
almost always presents some measure of inconvenience, and hence this factor becomes
meaningful only where a party can demonstrate a special or unusual burden.” Sawtelle v.
Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381, 1395 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations and quotes omitted). When, as
here, one of the Defendants would be required to defend the action on the other side of the
country, the burden is neither special nor unusual.
The exercise of personal jurisdiction in New Hampshire is therefore reasonable.
C.

Jurisdictional Discovery is Warranted.
If the Court is at all inclined to dismiss (which would be unwarranted for the reasons

discussed herein), Plaintiffs should be entitled to conduct limited discovery regarding

{00078077;1}

17

Case 1:16-cv-00545-JL Document 18 Filed 02/16/17 Page 22 of 23

Defendants’ connections to New Hampshire. See Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd., 274 F.3d at 625 (“We
have long held that a diligent plaintiff who sues an out-of-state corporation and who makes out a
colorable case for the existence of in personam jurisdiction may well be entitled to a modicum of
jurisdictional discovery if the corporation interposes a jurisdictional defense.”). As one court
colorfully explained, such discovery is not a fishing expedition: “When the fish is identified, and
the question is whether it is in the pond, we know no reason to deny a plaintiff the customary
license.” Surpitski v. Hughes-Keenan Corp., 362 F.2d 254, 256 (1st Cir. 1966).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the instant motion be denied
in its entirety or, in the alternative, that Plaintiff be allowed the opportunity to conduct
jurisdictional discovery.
