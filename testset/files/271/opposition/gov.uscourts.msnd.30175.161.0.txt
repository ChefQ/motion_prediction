Case: 2:65-cv-00031-DMB-JMV Doc #: 161 Filed: 04/16/15 1 of 4 PagelD #: 2427

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI

GREENVILLE DIVISION
DIANE COWAN, et al. PLAINTIFFS
and
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PLAINTIFE-INTERVENOR
v. Civil Action No. 2:65-CV-00031-DMB

BOLIVAR COUNTY BOARD OF
EDUCATION, et al. DEFENDANTS

RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE PARTIES

Defendant Cleveland School! District (the "District") files this Response in Opposition to
Plaintiffs' Motion to Substitute Parties and, in support thereof, would show this Court as follows:

1, On February 29, 2012, the Court entered an order allowing Plaintiffs twenty (20)
days to file a motion to substitute real parties in interest under Rule 17(a). [Dkt. No. 38].

2. Plaintiffs timely filed their motion to substitute parties on March 20, 2012, and
the Court subsequently granted the motion on March 28, 2012. [Dkt. No. 40, 42, and 43].

3. More than two years later, and only four weeks prior to the May 18 hearing date
set by the Court, Plaintiffs have moved again to seek substitution of parties. Specifically,
Plaintiffs seek to withdraw two plaintiffs whose children graduated from the District in 2013 and
add a Plaintiff who has two children who attend the District, one of whom is a senior anticipated
to graduate next month.

4. For the reasons set forth herein, Defendants object to this second motion to
substitute parties.

5, First, the motion is untimely. By order of this Court, Plaintiffs have already filed

a motion to substitute parties by the deadline of March 20, 2012. The current motion, filed on

37766407 _] 1
Case: 2:65-cv-00031-DMB-JMV Doc #: 161 Filed: 04/16/15 2 of 4 PagelD #: 2428

April 14, 2015, does not meet the prior deadline to seek substitution of parties by March 20,
2012. Plaintiffs fail to explain why the two plaintiffs seeking to withdraw did not seek
withdrawal two years ago when their respective children graduated. Moreover, Plaintiffs fail to
explain while the Reverend Edward Duvall did not seek to be substituted previously in March,
2012, when his now-12" grade daughter was presumably in 9 grade. In fact, Plaintiffs named
Mr. Duvall as a witness, and Defendants took his deposition yesterday, April 15. There is no
explanation as to why Plaintiffs did not timely seek substitution, instead of waiting until the
eleventh hour.

6. Second, Defendants will suffer prejudice. The scheduling order and
modifications set out deadlines related to discovery and trial issues that have already come and
gone. The discovery deadline is next week on April 21, 2015, and a five day hearing is
scheduled to begin on May 18, 2015. [Dkt. No. 99, 117]. Now, with less than a week remaining
in discovery, Plaintiffs seek to add Reverend Duvall as a new party, thereby entitling him
exemption from the exclusionary rule at the May 18 hearing and to attorney-client privileges not
available to a non-party fact witness.

7. Third, Plaintiffs will not suffer any prejudice. The continuation of this case does
not require that Reverend Duvall become a party-plaintiff. The other plaintiffs are willing and
capable to continue this litigation, and the Court has previously found that those other plaintiffs
have standing. [Dkt. No. 43]. Moreover, Reverend Duvall may serve as a witness in the
proceeding. Plaintiffs suffer no prejudice by Reverend Duvall being a witness, not a party.

8. Fourth, Plaintiffs filed the current motion under Rule 17(a), which addresses real

parties in interest. However, Rule 25 governs substitution of parties. Plaintiffs have failed to

mention Rule 25 in their motion or provide any of the reasons listed in Rule 25 require
substitution of parties.

9, Ultimately, the current stage of this litigation is drawing to a close with a
discovery deadline in less than a week and a substantive hearing in approximately a month. Now
is not the time for new parties. The current parties are all willing and able to continue litigating
this case. Asa result, Plaintiffs' motion should be denied.

For all of these reasons, the District requests this Court deny the Plaintiffs' motion to

 

substitute parties.
Respectfully submitted,
CLEVELAND SCHOOL DISTRICT
