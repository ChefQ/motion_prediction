Case 2:08-cv-02561-EFM Document 162

Filed 04/11/11 Page 2 of 6

Waiting until almost two months before the start of trial (and on the eve of trial
preparations), defendants have requested a continuance of the trial in this matter,
currently set for June 14, 2011. The June 14, 2011 trial setting was set by the Court by
way of its Third Amended Scheduling Order dated July 21, 2010. See Order dated July
21, 2010 (ECF Doc. No. 88). Plaintiffs and their counsel have long anticipated this trial
setting and have scheduled around it accordingly. Defendants have not demonstrated
good cause for a continuance, nor have they even attempted to explain the reason for the
long delay in their request. Defendants’ Motion for Continuance should be denied, and
this case should proceed to trial as currently set on June 14, 2011.
Just two months before trial is to begin, defendants have requested a three month
continuance in this matter. The trial in this matter has been set since July 2010. The
reason given by defendants is that defendants’ associate counsel, Bryan Erman, is
expecting a child to be born on July 3, two weeks after trial is scheduled to be concluded.
However, as stated, this trial has been scheduled since July 21, 2010. See Order dated
July 21, 2010 (ECF Doc. No. 88). The June 14 trial setting has been reiterated time and
time again by the parties during their discussions and drafting of the Pretrial Order.
Moreover, it was specifically included in the Pretrial Order issued by the Court on
November 23, 2010. See Pretrial Order dated November 23, 2010 (ECF Doc. No. 134).
Finally, the trial date was also discussed during the Final Pretrial Conference taking place
on November 12, 2010.

Mr. Erman was extensively involved in the drafting and

discussions regarding the Pretrial Order, and in fact, was the only attorney present for
defendants (besides local counsel) at the Final Pretrial Conference. At no time did Mr.

Erman ever mention the due date of his child, which was most certainly known in late
2010.
Defendants’ counsel knew the due date of July 3 long before the recent filing of
their Motion. Indeed, utilizing simple math, the due date for Mr. Erman’s child’s birth
would have been known on approximately Oct. 3, or shortly thereafter. The due date
would most certainly have been known by the drafting of the Pretrial Order, as well as
the Final Pretrial Conference, which was held on November 12, 2010. At no time during
the drafting of the Pretrial Order, or at the Final Pretrial Conference, was a continuance
mentioned, nor the present alleged conflict.

The present alleged conflict was first

mentioned only recently, and immediately before the filing of Defendants’ Motion for
Continuance.1 To that end, defendants have not offered one explanation or reason as to
why such a long delay occurred in requesting a continuance. If the parties would have
been able to address this issue in the latter part of 2010, the parties could have workedout a reasonable solution to this pending issue. However, as a result of defendants’ delay
in notifying Plaintiffs and the Court of their intention to seek a continuance, alternative
options are simply not likely to exist. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion should be
denied.
While Plaintiffs certainly do not want to take away from the birth of Mr. Erman’s
child, the due date is July 3, 2011, which is two weeks after the bench trial is scheduled
to be concluded. Most likely, there will be plenty of time for Mr. Erman to return to
Dallas from Kansas City in the speculative event of the birth coming “a few days early,”
as argued by defendants. Defendants’ argument that it would be difficult to return to

Upon defendants’ request to Plaintiffs’ counsel for agreement to a continuance,
Plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to move the trial forward if the Court could accommodate such
a schedule. Defendants refused and insisted that the trial be moved to September.

Dallas from Kansas City after trial is somewhat confusing. With approximately 18, hourlong, non-stop flights a day from Kansas City to Dallas, it will be fairly easy for
defendants’ counsel to return to Dallas after the trial is concluded. In short, Mr. Erman
will be present in Dallas for the birth of his child, and there is no need for a continuance
of this matter. Finally, Mr. Erman is not the only attorney representing defendants in this
matter. On behalf of defendants, there are currently five (5) attorneys, from two different
firms, on the signature block. Bruce Collins is the lead defense attorney in this matter.
Mr. Collins, along with Mr. Erman and at least two other attorneys from the Carrington
Coleman firm in Dallas are defending this matter.

Carrington Coleman has

approximately 60 attorneys. If there is a true concern that Mr. Erman will not be able to
attend trial, there is plenty of time to utilize one of the associates currently working on
this matter, or to bring another attorney on-board before trial begins in this matter.
This case was first filed in November 2008, and trial has long been anticipated by
the parties. Since this matter has been set for trial since July 2010, Plaintiffs and their
counsel have accordingly prepared for the trial date and have scheduled around the trial
date. Defendants, however, also request the trial be continued to a date that is convenient
to their schedule, September 5, 2011, just after defendants’ lead trial counsel, Bruce
Collins, completes his scheduled summer vacation in late August. The Plaintiffs and
their counsel should not be delayed and forced to reschedule their calendars because
defendants waited until just two months before trial to request a continuance.
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that Defendants’
Motion for Continuance be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
