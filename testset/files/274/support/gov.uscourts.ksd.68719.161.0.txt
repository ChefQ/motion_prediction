TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT:
Defendants LSB Industries, Inc. (“LSB”) and Jack E. Golsen (collectively, “Defendants”)
respectfully move for a continuance of the trial setting in this action to ensure that Defendants’
counsel can be present for the birth of his child.
This action is currently set for the trial setting beginning June 14, 2011. The parties have
estimated that the trial will last five days. Pretrial Order (Doc. No. 134) ¶ 16(c). Therefore, the
trial will not likely conclude until the week of June 20.
Defendants’ counsel, Bryan Erman, has handled much of the discovery in this action and
will be one of the primary attorneys for Defendants at the trial. Mr. Erman’s wife is scheduled to
give birth to their first child on July 3 in Dallas, Texas — the week after the trial is scheduled to
conclude. Under the current schedule, it will be difficult for Mr. Erman to return from Kansas
City to Dallas in time to be present for the birth of his child should his wife give birth even a few
days early during the trial. Because of his extensive involvement with the litigation of this case,
Mr. Erman’s presence at the trial is necessary. Therefore, Defendants seek a continuance of the
trial setting. If it would fit the Court’s schedule, Defendants request that the trial be continued to
the week of September 5, 2011.1
While the trial setting for this action has been previously moved by the Court, this is
Defendants’ first request for a continuance. Plaintiffs have refused to agree to continue the trial
setting and have indicated that they intend to oppose this Motion.

Defendants’ counsel, Bruce Collins, has a vacation scheduled for August 19-28.
