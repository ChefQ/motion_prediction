CASE NO. 02:07-CV-333
Hon. David Folsom
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

DEFENDANT SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.’S
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF ABSTRAX, INC.’S MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE EVERINGHAM’S ORDER
GRANTING SUN’S RENEWED MOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE

Defendant, Sun Microsystems, Inc. (“Sun”) requests that the Court deny Plaintiff
Abstrax., Inc.’s (“Abstrax”) Motion for Reconsideration of Magistrate Judge Everingham’s
Order Granting Sun’s Renewed Motion for Change of Venue (“Abstrax’s Motion”). On August
28, 2009, this Court entered its Memorandum Opinion and Order (“Court’s Order”) granting
Sun’s motion and transferring the instant case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California. Abstrax filed its Motion on September 11, 2009.
As an initial matter, Abstrax’s Motion is improper as it identifies no significant errors of
fact or law and presents no new evidence, as required by this Court for a motion for
reconsideration. Furthermore, Abstrax incorrectly asserts that the Court relied on the location of
witnesses that the parties do not intend to call at trial. In its argument here, Abstrax arbitrarily
attempts to limit Sun’s potential witnesses and ignores that the majority of potential witnesses
identified by Sun are either in the Northern District of California or significantly closer to

California than Texas. Abstrax cannot overcome the Court’s determination that the transferee
forum is clearly more convenient.
In addition, Abstrax raises false concerns over judicial inefficiencies. Abstrax ignores
that the Court carefully considered judicial economy in its August 28, 2009, Memorandum
Opinion and Order (“Court’s Order”) granting Sun’s motion and transferring the instant case.
The Court specifically held that judicial economy had already been achieved. Furthermore,
many of the alleged judicial inefficiencies Abstrax seeks to remedy would potentially require a
joint Sun-Dell trial to resolve. However, Abstrax ignores that, regardless of the resolution of
Abstrax’s Motion, the Sun and Dell cases will proceed with separate trials. Abstrax’s arguments
here fail as the Court has already considered judicial economy concerns in rendering its decision
to transfer the instant case.
Abstrax’s improper Motion identifies no significant errors of fact or law and presents no
new evidence. Instead, Abstrax seeks to arbitrarily limit Sun’s potential witnesses and attempts
to re-argue matters the Court has clearly considered in deciding to transfer the instant case to the
Northern District of California. This Court should deny Abstrax’s Motion.

ARGUMENT
I.

Abstrax’s Motion for Reconsideration is Improper and Fails to Meet
the Legal Standard in this Court for Such Motions.
As an initial matter, Abstrax’s Motion is improper as it fails to “correct manifest errors of

law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.” MHL TEK, LLC v. Nissan Motor Co.,
Civil Action No. 2:07-cv-289, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13676, **10-11 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 23, 2009)
(citations omitted). This Court has held that “[a] motion to reconsider based on recycled
arguments only serves to waste the resources of the court.” Id. (citing State v. Sprint Comm. Co.,
899 F. Supp. 282, 284 (M.D. La. 1995)). Abstrax’s Motion merely restates or misrepresents

information of which the Court is already aware, and raises no new evidence relevant to the
Court’s Order.
Abstrax first argues that the Court placed undue reliance on the location of witnesses that
the parties allegedly do not intend to call. However, the Court was already apprised of the
location of these various potential witnesses at the time it rendered its Order. Abstrax asserts
that Sun’s preliminary witness list changes what witnesses are relevant to a venue transfer
determination. But, as discussed infra, this list was not final and Abstrax based its argument
principally on Sun’s “will call” witnesses and discounts Sun’s “may call” witnesses - the vast
majority of which reside either in the Northern District of California or significantly closer to
California than Texas. The location of these witnesses and Sun’s preliminary witness list do not
represent “manifest errors of fact or law” or “new evidence.” Thus, Abstrax’s argument here for
reconsideration is improper.
Abstrax also argues that inconsistent rulings may result if the Sun and Dell cases are tried
in different Courts. Again, Abstrax raises no new issue here that could serve as justification for a
motion for reconsideration. The Court carefully considered the existence of multiple lawsuits
involving the same issues in its Order. Notably, the Court stated that “[i]n the present case, as
indicated above, the existence of multiple lawsuits involving the same issues is negated by
the posture of the motion to change venue; the completion of the claim construction process;
and the lack of consolidation.”1 Court’s Order at 3 (emphasis added). As the Court specifically
addressed this point, Abstrax has not identified “manifest errors of fact or law” or “new
evidence.” Thus, again, Abstrax’s argument here for reconsideration is improper.
1 Sun notes that the Court, in its Order, cited the same point from the Fifth Circuit’s Volkswagen decision upon

which Abstrax relies. See Court’s Order at 3. More importantly, the Court specifically distinguished the instant
case over this citation from Volkswagen decision. Id. Yet again, Abstrax has raised no new issue to justify a motion
for reconsideration.

Abstrax Misrepresents Likely Witnesses At Trial, Location of Those
Witnesses, and Ignores That No Witnesses Are Located in the Eastern
District of Texas.

Abstrax incorrectly argues that the Court’s Order places “undue reliance on the location
of deposition witnesses that neither party intends to call ….” Abstrax’s Motion at 5. In fact,
Abstrax misrepresents what witnesses the parties intend to call and the impact of the locations of
those witnesses. In addition, Abstrax ignores that the Sun witness list, cited in Abstrax’s Motion,
is a preliminary list and not necessarily the final list for trial. See Abstrax’s Motion, Exh. 1.
Moreover, Abstrax conveniently ignores a key factor in the Court’s Order that no witnesses
reside in the Eastern District of Texas. See Court’s Order at 3.
In its Motion, Abstrax focuses on the four witnesses Sun has preliminarily identified as
“will call.” However, Sun also preliminarily identified an additional 12 witnesses as “may call”
– meaning Sun is considering calling these witnesses to testify at trial. Of these twelve
witnesses, all but two reside either in the transferee venue (the Northern District for California)
or reside significantly closer to California than Texas.2 Notably, two of Abstrax’s three experts
reside in California (one in the Northern District of California) and the two principals of Abstrax
were deposed by Sun, at Abstrax’s choice, in California and reside in Arizona – significantly
closer to California than Texas. Importantly, none of the witnesses identified by Sun or Abstrax
reside in the Eastern District of Texas. While Abstrax agrees that witness convenience is an
important factor in a venue transfer analysis, it obscures the fact that - consistent with the Court’s

2 This “may call” witness list includes former Sun employees, many of whom are within the subpoena power of the

Northern District of California. In its Motion, Abstrax incorrectly implies that Sun’s relationship with these
witnesses makes such subpoena power unnecessary. To the contrary, requiring a non-party witness to appear at trial
is a significant burden. This burden is greatly reduced for many potential witnesses by the transfer of this case to the
Northern District of California.

Order - the Northern District of California is a clearly more convenient forum for most potential
witnesses. See Abstrax’s Motion at 6; Court’s Order at 3.
Furthermore, the importance Abstrax attaches to the location of the four witnesses
preliminarily identified by Sun as “will call” is misplaced. These witnesses are Sun’s experts,
who are distinct from fact witnesses as Sun contracts with these experts to perform certain
functions including, if necessary, testifying at trial. Thus, expert witnesses are not surrendering
their time and leaving their employment for free as are fact witnesses. The potential fact
witnesses Sun may call – particularly the third parties – are of greater concern with regard to
convenience.
In its Order, the Court based its decision, in part, on the fact that “there are a substantial
number of material witnesses who reside in the transferee venue and none who reside in the
Eastern District of Texas.” Abstrax attempts to avoid this clear determination by the Court by
arbitrarily limiting the potential witnesses Sun may call at trial and ignoring that the Northern
District of California is a clearly more convenient forum. For this reason alone, this Court
should deny Abstrax’s Motion.

III.

Abstrax’s Concerns About Judicial Inefficiencies Are Misplaced as
This Court Has Determined that Judicial Economy “Has Already
Been Achieved.”
While Abstrax attempts to identify alleged inefficiencies from the transfer of the instant

case, Abstrax ignores that the Court has already determined that judicial economy has been
achieved and that the Sun and Dell cases were never consolidated. In its Order, the Court
directly addressed the issue of judicial economy:
[T]he claim construction opinion has already been issued, and fact discovery is nearly
complete. Moreover, Sun has agreed to be bound by this court’s claim construction

opinion upon transfer to California. The judicial economy flowing from maintaining
both cases in the Eastern District has already been achieved.
Court’s Order at 3-4 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court specifically addressed this issue and has
explained how judicial economy has been achieved. Moreover, some of the alleged
inefficiencies identified by Abstrax would potentially require a common Sun-Dell trial with
Abstrax to resolve. As the Court noted in its Order, the Sun and Dell cases were never
consolidated. See Court’s Order at 3. While Abstrax incorrectly states that the two cases were
“consolidated for all pretrial matters,” the Court, in fact, only set a common discovery schedule
and Markman proceeding. See Abstrax’s Motion at 2; Notice of Joint Proposed Docket Control
Order, Case No. 2:07-CV-221, Document No. 38, at 4, n.1. Thus, the Court has always
considered the Sun and Dell cases to be separate and – even if not transferred – would likely
have separate trials. Now, even if Abstrax were to prevail in its Motion, Sun could not
reasonably join a trial with Dell as the Abstrax / Dell matter is scheduled for trial in just three
weeks. Thus, regardless of the resolution of Abstrax’s Motion, the Sun and Dell cases will
proceed with separate trials – depriving Abstrax of many of the alleged judicial efficiencies it
seeks.
Abstrax also unnecessarily expresses concern over possible inconsistent rulings for
several motions, for which Sun was originally a party, that this Court has recently decided in the
Dell matter (since the Sun case was transferred). See Abstrax’s Motion at 9. While the Northern
District of California may decide some or all of these motions in the Abstrax / Sun matter, Sun is
confident that Abstrax will likely provide that Court with the decisions from the Eastern District
of Texas – thus, the transferee court will likely have the benefit of this Court’s decisions.
Abstrax’s arguments for judicial inefficiencies fail as the Court was fully aware of these

potential issues and carefully considered judicial economy in rendering its decision to transfer
the instant case.

CONCLUSION
For at least the foregoing reasons, Sun requests that the Court deny Abstrax’s Motion for
Reconsideration of Magistrate Judge Everingham’s Order Granting Sun’s Motion for
Reconsideration.
