I, M. Christopher Jhang, hereby declare as follows:

1. I am an attorney duly licensed to practice law in all of the courts of the State of
California and this Court, and am an attorney with the law firm of Perkins Coie LLP, counsel for
defendant Google Inc. ("Google") in this action. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 79-5(d), I submit
this declaration in response to Plaintiffs' Administrative Motion Pursuant To Civ. L.R. 79-5(d)
To File Under Seal Portions Of Plaintiffs' Supplemental Reply Memorandum Due To
Confidential Designations By Defendant Google Inc. ("Plaintiffs' Motion to Seal Document'),
filed with this Court on May 29, 2007 (Document Nos. 163-165). Ihave personal knowledge of
the facts set forth below except as to those matters stated on information and belief, and as to
those matters, I believe them to be true. If called upon to testify, I could and would testify
competently as to the matters set forth herein.

BASIS FOR SEALING OF GOOGLE'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

2. On or about March 2, 2007, Google and plaintiffs CLRB Hanson Industries, LLC,
d/b/a Industrial Printing, and Howard Stern ("Plaintiffs") executed and filed with the Court their
[Proposed] Stipulated Protective Order Regarding Confidential Information. On May 15, 2007,
the Court executed the parties' Stipulated Protective Order (with amendments). A true and
correct copy of the Court-executed Stipulated Protective Order is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

3. The Stipulated Protective Order provides two tiers of confidential designations.
The first tier covers information designated "Confidential," which the Stipulated Protective
Order generally describes as "those things that may be disclosed to the parties or their counsel
for the purposes of the litigation, but which must be protected against disclosure to third parties."
Stipulated Protective Order, | 4. The second tier covers information designated "Confidential -
Trade Secret/Attorneys' Eyes Only," which the protective order generally describes as "those
imformation or materials which are of a proprietary, business or technical nature that might
reasonably be of value to a competitor or potential customer of the party or nonparty holding the
proprietary rights thereto or might reasonably pose a commercial disadvantage to the producing

party and must be protected from disclosure." Id.

Case 5:05-cv-03649-JW Document174 Filed 06/01/2007 Page 3 of 4

4. On April 26, 2007, I sent Plaintiffs' counsel, Lester Levy and Michele Raphael, a
letter providmg Google's tailored confidentiality designations for the deposition transcripts of
Google employees Heather Wilburn, Shivakumar Venkataraman, and Michael Schulman. A true
and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

5. Google considers portions of Ms. Wilburn's deposition transcript to be
"Confidential" because they discuss, describe, or refer to Google's internal training materials or
internal guidelines used by Google's customer service representatives to respond to client
inquiries. None of these materials are available to the public. Except for these "Confidential"
portions, Ms. Wilburn's transcript has been designated by Google as non-confidential.

6. Google considers Mr. Venkataraman's deposition transcript to be "Confidential"
im its entirety because Mr. Venkataraman is a Google software engineer who primarily discussed
in his deposition Google's internal processes and information not available to the public. Mr.
Venkataraman discussed Google's proprietary technology related to its AdWords program, the
development of new technology, and the content of confidential documents Google produced to
Plaintiffs. No portions of his transcript have been designated "Confidential - Trade
Secret/Attorneys' Eyes Only."

7. Google considers most of Mr. Schulman's deposition transcript to be
"Confidential." Mr. Schulman is a Google software engineer who primarily discussed in his
deposition Google's internal processes and information not available to the public. For example,
Mr. Schulman discussed Google's proprietary technology related to its AdWords program,
mcluding the computer programming of the system for serving ads, and the content of
confidential documents Google produced to Plaintiffs. Google also considers a small portion of
Mr. Schulman's transcript to be "Confidential -- Trade Secret/Attorneys' Eyes Only" because
this portion pertains to Google's highly sensitive algorithms used for the AdWords program.

PLAINTIFFS'? MOTION TO SEAL DOCUMENT
8. On May 29, 2007, Plaintiffs filed their Motion to Seal Document, requesting to

For Partial Summary Judgment (`"Plaintiffs' Supplemental Reply Memorandum') because it

9. The redactions (1.e., sealmg as confidential documents) requested in Plaintiffs'
Motion to Seal Document, in connection with Plaintiffs' Supplemental Reply Memorandum,
include information and testimony that Google has designated confidential.
