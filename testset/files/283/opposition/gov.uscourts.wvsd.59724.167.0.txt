PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO INTERVENOR-DEFENDANT FOLA COAL COMPANY,
LLC’S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM NOVEMBER 24, 2009 ORDER

Relief from November 24, 2009 Order. The specific relief that Intervenor-Defendant Fola Coal
Company, LLC (“Fola”) seeks is for the Court to allow it “use of the valley fills on which Fola
previously has been permitted to conduct mining activity.” Fola’s Motion at 10. In support of its
motion, Fola asserts that, with regard to the fills whose continued use it seeks, “clearing and
grubbing has been completed, the existing streambeds have been removed, the substrate has been
collected and stockpiled, and SWROA structures have been constructed in the former stream
channels within each of these valley fills.” Id. at 4. Furthermore, Fola’s counsel has represented
to Plaintiffs’ counsel that, if permitted to continue using those fills, Fola can operate for 12
months or more. Plaintiffs understand that Fola intends to file an affidavit reflecting that 12month period with the Court as soon as practicable.

pending motion. Plaintiffs take this position with the expectation that Fola and the Army Corps
will work with all due speed to resolve the defects in Fola’s § 404 permit and that Fola will not
