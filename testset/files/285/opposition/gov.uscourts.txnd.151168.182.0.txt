PLAINTIFFS' RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR DISMISSAL, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PLEA IN
ABATEMENT
AND
PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANTS' PLEA IN ABATEMENT
AND
MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION
Comes now Plaintiffs Tsephanyah Hawkins and Yahchanan Hawkins responding
in opposition to Defendants' Motion for Dismissal, or in the Alternative, Plea in
Abatement ("Defendants' Filing"), and moving to strike Defendants' Plea in Abatement,
and requesting that the Court clarify the nature and character of Defendants' filing, as to

whether it is a pleading or a motion.

Concurrently with this response is a concurrently filed brief in support.
Case 1:05-cv-00184-C Document 182 Filed 11/06/06 Page2of5 PagelD 2515

Attached is a certificate of conference demonstrating that Plaintiffs have not been
able to reach Defendants' attorney.

By whatever its proper denomination, Defendants' Filing is beyond the discretion
of this Court to grant. This federal litigation involves federal rights of Plaintiffs that must
be adjudicated in federal court, and the state case involves no matter involving the
processes of state government. The parties of this litigation are plainly not the same as
the parties in the state litigation. This case does not involve the same issues or issues
controlled by those in the state litigation; therefore, this case should not be abstained
from, dismissed. stayed, or abated. If Defendants' Filing is construed as an amended
answer, it is late without leave of court, and it would erase Defendants' previous answer.
Moreover, Defendants didn't request leave of court to amend their answer pursuant to the
local rules. Also, the time to file amended answers ended pursuant to this Court's
Scheduling order, on March 15, 2006 at 3:00 p.m, That was over seven months before
Defendants filed Defendants' Filing.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

For the reasons stated above, and for the reasons detailed in the brief filed
concurrently with this response, these proceedings should not be abstained from, stayed,
abated, or dismissed. If Defendants' Filing is allowed as a "Plea in Abatement", that is to
say a special dilatory answer, Plaintiffs' request that it replace Defendants' live amended
answer and thus erase Defendants' previously pled denials, defenses, and admissions.
Defendants' are represented by licensed counsel and they are without excuse for their
frivolous filing of a Plea in Abatement in federal court. No extension of the time for

Defendants' to file amendments to their pleadings should be given.
Case 1:05-cv-00184-C Document 182 Filed 11/06/06 Page3of5 PagelD 2516

Whatever the decision, Plaintiffs request that the Court clarify the character and
effect of Defendants' filing so Plaintiffs will have the information necessary to act on that
filing, and so they can understand how Defendants' Filing has effected the nature of the
live pleadings in this case. Without such clarification, Plaintiffs will be unable to
ascertain Defendants' defenses, denials, and admissions, thus Plaintiffs will be unable to

ascertain the issues that remain. That would work a prejudice against them.
