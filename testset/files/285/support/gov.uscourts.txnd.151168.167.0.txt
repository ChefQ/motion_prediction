pleadings in that action are contained in the Appendix and are incorporated herein for all
purposes as if copied verbatim. Such suit by Hutchison is about the ownership of the software
that is utilized in the computerized court reporting systems that were sold by StenoScribe, Inc.,
now known as Courtroom Data Solutions, Inc., the ownership of Courtroom Data Solutions, Inc.,
an accounting regarding such business, and requests a money judgment due to the disparity of
money and property that Tsephanyah has received from such corporation versus what Hutchison
has received. ( See PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED ORIGINAL PETITION in Appendix,
Exhibit No. 1) In fact, in the DEFENDANT’S COUNTERCLAIM filed by Tsephanyah Hawkins
and Courtroom Data Solutions, Inc., they allege causes of actions for Tortious Interference with
Contracts, Misuse of Civil Process , and Misappropriation of Corporate Opportunities. (See
DEFENDANTS’ COUNTERCLAIM in Appendix, Exhibit No. 2)
2. The actions in the Texas State Litigation constitute the bases of most of the causes of action
alleged by the Plaintiffs in their Second Amended Complaint filed in this federal lawsuit
surrounding the sale of some computerized court reporting systems by StenoScribe, Inc., now
known as Courtroom Data Solutions, Inc. to the corporation now known as THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF REALTIME COURT REPORTERS, INC.
A majority of the original defendants have been dismissed, The Honorable Judge John
Weeks, The National Institue of Realtime Reporter’s, The South Carolina School of Court
Reporting, Inc., Victoria L. Carter, the Carter Law Offices, Marilynn Gardner, John Chistolini,
S.A.W. Solutions, Inc., Charles C. Self, Donald Anderson, Chistolini and Desimone, Inc., and
Whitten & Young, P.C. The only remaining defendants are Hutchison, StenoScribe, Inc,
VocEdit, Inc., and Norman Oster. One of the Plaintiffs was dismissed, that being Courtroom
Data Solutions, Inc.

3. All the facts in this case will certainly be litigated in the state court case. The time frame for
the causes of action alleged by the Plaintiffs in this case is from around June 2003 till present.
The time frame for the causes of action alledged in the state court proceedings is from 1997
through the present. It should be noted that Plaintiff Tsephanyah Hawkins specifically alleged a
cause of action in the state court action for misuse of civil process for the issuance of the
Temporary Restraining Order, which is one of his primary allegations here in this action. In
effect, now with the dismissal of most of the original defendants, this action amounts to a
removal action of the state court proceeding, which was filed first and is still pending.
4. A trial date has been scheduled for March 19, 2006, in the state court proceeding. (See
Appendix, Exhibit 3.)
5. The dismissal or abatement of this action would be an acceptable means of avoiding
unnecessary duplication of judicial machinery.
6. Any other required matters are set forth in the Brief in Support of this Motion.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendants Hutchison, StenoScribe, Inc., VocEdit,
Inc. and Norman Oster, pray that after the court considers this motion, that it be granted and that
this matter be dismissed without prejudice, or in the alternative, abated until the state court action
is completed.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,
