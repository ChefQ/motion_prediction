AT&T MOBILITY II, LLC, a Delaware limited Case No. C07-05463 WHA
hability company,
CAROLYN PESTANO'S OPPOSITION
Plaintiff, TO AT&T'S ADMINISTRATIVE

vs. MOTION TO FILE DOCUMENTS
UNDER SEAL

CAROLYN PESTANO, an individual,
(Civil L.R. 7-11)
Defendant.

 

 

I. INTRODUCTION

AT&T Mobility I, LLC (`AT&T') files an administrative Motion to Seal the following
documents filed in support of AT&T's pending dispositive motions: (1) the dealer agreement in place
between it and Viva Wireless, Inc. ("Viva'') (the "Dealer Agreement'), (2) the agreement pursuant to
which AT&T advanced certain funds to Viva (the "APA Agreement'), and (3) a release pursuant to
which AT&T's predecessor restructured residual payments due to Viva (the "SMF Release"). AT&T
does not make any particularized showing that the material it seeks to have sealed constitutes trade
secrets or is otherwise sealable. Nor does AT&T make any effort to narrowly tailor its request.
AT&T offers conclusory justifications for why the documents should be sealed in their entirety,
rather than redacted. AT&T's request is belied by the information freely available to the public and

by AT&T's own previous filings. AT&T's request should be denied.

II. DISCUSSION
In determining whether documents are appropriately sealed, courts distinguish between
"discovery documents," and documents "that influence or underpin the judicial decision." The latter
category of documents enjoys a presumptive right of public access, regardless of whether the parties

stipulate to their confidential nature. Baxter Int'], Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 297 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.

 

2002). The party seeking secrecy with respect to non-discovery documents must "make... a
particularized showing that disclosure will cause a clearly defined and serious injury... ." Pansy v.
Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 786 (3d Cir. 1994). Local Rule 79-5 tracks these principles -
and requires a request to seal to: (1) be narrowly tailored, and (2) demonstrate that the material sought
to be sealed is a trade secret, privileged, or otherwise entitled to protection under the law. See Civil
L.R. 79-5; see also commentary to Civil L.R. 79-5 (referencing "minimum redactions necessary to
protect sealable information") (emphasis added).

Here there is no dispute that the documents in question are non-discovery documents, given
that they are attached to AT&T potentially dispositive motions. Accordingly, they enjoy a
presumptive right of public access. In order to file them under seal, AT&T must make a
particularized showing that specific material is sealable and the harm that could flow from disclosure.
A. AT&T Does not Undertake a Particularized Showing

AT&T does not attempt a particularized showing with respect to specific portions of any of
the documents. It submits the declaration of its Senior Litigation Counsel (the Hennessy
Declaration), who generally avers that disclosure of any part of the Dealer Agreement would be
harmful because the entire agreement constitutes valuable, proprietary information. The Hennessy
Declaration further argues that disclosure of the Dealer Agreement would be harmful because it

would provide a "roadmap" of the relationship to AT&T's competitors. But the Hennessy

Declaration fails to identify any particular provisions of the Dealer Agreement which constitute

Case 3:07-cv-05463-WHA Document 26 Filed 01/28/2008 Page3of6

"proprietary information." Surely the miscellaneous provisions - such as the choice of law or the
arbitration provisions - do not constitute proprietary information. Nor do the general provisions
which allow AT&T to withhold a reserve (subject to an obligation to account to the dealer) - these
types of terms are likely a part of every dealer agreement. The same is true of the other two
documents. The Hennessy Declaration fails to articulate specifically what provisions of the APA
Agreement or the SMF Release should be treated as confidential and why their disclosure would
harm AT&T. This alone is a basis for denial of AT&T's request. See Civil L.R. 79-5.

B. AT&T Does not Demonstrate What Harm Could Flow From Disclosure

AT&T's purported justifications are so general that they should be viewed with skepticism.
Pestano, who was the principal of an AT&T dealer, testifies that certain specific provisions of these
agreements, such as compensation figures, were in practice treated as confidential. However, there is
no basis for treating the boilerplate terms, including dispute resolution provisions, as confidential.
(See Pestano Decl., 0x00A7 2.) An examination of each of the documents bears out this position.

L. The Dealer Agreement.

AT&T's argument that the Dealer Agreement should not be disclosed because it provides a
"roadmap" of the relationship between AT&T and the dealer is belied by the evidence. First, AT&T
filed an un-redacted version of a previously existing dealer agreement which has terms substantially
similar to the Dealer Agreement. The previous dealer agreement provides as much of a "roadmap" as
the Dealer Agreement. (See Pestano Decl., 0x00A7 2.) Second, one unrelated entity who is a party to a
current dealer agreement with AT&T has filed this agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission while redacting only portions of the agreement. The document is freely available (in
redacted form) online. (See Balasubramani Decl., Ex. B.) That agreement is marked (as is the Dealer
Agreement) as "Cingular Wireless Proprietary & Confidential." The fact that such an agreement was

publicly filed shows which portions of the dealer agreement were actually viewed as confidential by

AT&T and dealers (and by the SEC). The redacted version also shows how the Dealer Agreement
should be properly redacted. A comparison of the two documents is telling.

2. The APA Agreement.

With respect to the APA Agreement, the Hennessy Declaration avers that because the APA
Agreement was a "very unusual exception" made for Viva, disclosure would harm AT&T because
other dealers would "demand similar arrangements from AT&T ...." There are several problems
with this argument. First, Pestano's counterclaims, which were filed over 60 days ago, refer
extensively to the terms of the APA Agreement and quote from it. Any purported harm from
disclosure of the key terms would have already occurred. Second, and even more important, AT&T
itself freely disclosed (see Miguel Decl. (Dkt. 22), p. 32-35) the Personal Guaranty, which was an
attachment to, and an integral part of, the APA Agreement. AT&T's argument that the disclosure of
the APA Agreement would harm its interests is inconsistent with its own conduct. The Personal
Guaranty sets forth the key provisions of the APA Agreement - that AT&T advanced to Viva
$250,000 pursuant to that agreement. The remaining provisions of the APA Agreement are largely
boilerplate and cannot be trade secrets. Having disclosed its key provisions, AT&T cannot now argue
that the APA Agreement should be sealed entirely.

3. The SMF Release.

AT&T's arguments as to the SMF Release are similarly unavailing. The Hennessy
Declaration avers that since AT&T entered into releases with various other dealers, all having
"different terms," disclosure of the SMF Release could cause "discord" among the various dealers.
Conceivably there are a few critical terms of the SMF Release that could vary from dealer to dealer -
the amount of compensation owed and the timing of payment. The bulk of the other terms of the
SMF Release are general/boilerplate terms. With respect to the amount of compensation and the

timing of payment, those have already been disclosed, and are part of the record in this case. These,

along with the references in the SMF Release to an earlier dealer agreement, and the dispute
resolution provisions are all key terms that will likely be central to the Court's resolution of AT&T's
Motions. Accordingly, they should be a part of the public record.
Cc, AT&T Failed to Explore any Lesser Restrictive Alternatives

AT&T argues that it filed a blanket request because it would have been unworkable to come
to an agreement regarding particular portions of the documents since AT&T could not anticipate what
sections Pestano would refer to in opposition. (See Kohut Decl.) This is an untenable reason to file a
blanket request, and was caused by AT&T's failure to fully confer with counsel for Pestano. Indeed,
AT&T should have approached counsel for Pestano and tried to come to an agreement on the key
provisions which should be redacted from the agreements. Another alternative would have been to
confer with Pestano's counsel regarding the dispositive portions of the agreement and stipulate as to
their authenticity (thus obviating the need to attach the agreements). Pestano's counsel suggested
both of these options. (See Balasubramani Decl., [2 & 6.) Either of these alternatives would have
minimized the material sought to be sealed, and minimized the burden on the Court and the parties.

III. | CONCLUSION

AT&T's blanket request to seal should be denied. The documents contain discrete items of
sealable information, at best, which can easily be redacted. AT&T's purported justifications as to
why the documents should be sealed entirely are belied by its own conduct and the fact that at least
one of the documents is publicly available (in redacted form). Courts should not seal dispositive
provisions of documents lightly, and this instance AT&T's justifications fall well short of what is

necessary to obtain a blanket sealing order.
