Pursuant to Local Civil Rules 7-11, 79-5(b) and 79-5(c), Plaintiff AT&T Mobility II,

LLC ("AT&T Mobility"), respectfully requests that the following documents be filed under

seal:

Page 3, lines 4-6, 8-9, 12-13, 17-18 and page 6, lines 5-11 of the Memorandum
of Points and Authorities in Support of the Motion By AT&T Mobility II, LLC
To Compe! Arbitration Of Counterclaims Of Carolyn Pestano (scheduled to be
heard March 6, 2008) ("the Motion to Compe! Arbitration");

Page 4 at lines 16-25; page 5 at lines 6-8 and 25-28, page 6 at lines 1-6 and 10-
17; page 7 at lines 12-15, 21-22, and 24-28; and page 8 at lines 1-6 of the
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of the Motion By AT&T
Mobility II, LLC To Dismiss the First, Second, Fifth and Sixth Counterclaims
of Carolyn Pestano without Leave to Amend (scheduled to be heard March 6,
2008) ("the Motion to Dismiss").

The "Cingular Wireless Exclusive Dealer Agreement" between Viva Wireless,
Inc. and Cingular Wireless II, LLC (the "Dealer Agreement"), Exhibit B to the
Declaration of Marc Miguel filed in support of the Motion to Compel
Arbitration and Motion to Dismiss;

The "Settlement and Release Concerning Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 Total Subscriber
Base" (the "2/1/06 SMF Release"), Exhibit C to the Declaration of Marc
Miguel filed in support of the Motion to Compel Arbitration and Motion to
Dismiss; and

Pages 1-5 of the "Advance Payment Agreement," Exhibit D to the Declaration
of Marc Miguel filed in support of the Motion to Compel Arbitration and

Motion to Dismiss.

Good cause exists to seal the aforementioned documents and portions of documents in

that the Dealer Agreement contains a provision identifying certain information, including the

terms of the Dealer Agreement, as being Confidential Information and trade secrets of

Cingular Wireless II, LLC, precluding the parties to the Dealer Agreement from disclosing
such Confidential Information. [Dealer Agreement, 0x00A7 4.2.1]. Likewise, paragraph 4(b) of
the 2/1/06 SMF Release and paragraph 4 of the Advance Payment Agreement identify the
terms of those contracts to be Confidential Information. Further, as set forth in the
Declaration of Cynthia Hennessy, the Dealer Agreement, 2/1/06 SMF Release, and Advance
Payment Agreement, are agreements currently in use by AT&T Mobility, which AT&T
Mobility considers and treats as confidential and containing proprietary information, the
disclosure of which would negatively affect AT&T Mobility. [Hennessy Decl., at {93-5.]

This request is narrowly tailored to seal only the material for which good cause to seal
has been established.

For the foregoing reasons, AT&T Mobility, successor to Cingular Wireless II, LLC,
requests that these documents, and such portions of the Memoranda of Points and Authorities
in support of the Motion to Compel Arbitration and Motion to Dismiss that quote from these

documents, be filed under seal.
