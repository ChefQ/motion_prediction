MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

I.

3

INTRODUCTION

4

Plaintiff borrower defaulted on his loan, yet seeks through litigation to avoid his payment

5

obligations. Plaintiff breached his promise to repay the money he borrowed. Plaintiff alleges that

6

Defendants were “paid in full when [they] sold the loan involved to others…[and are] owed nothing

7

because they have been paid in full…” See Amended Complaint at 1:28-2:2.

8

allegation that Defendants were “paid in full when [they] sold the loan…,” he also curiously alleges

9

that Defendants failed to accept his “tender” of payment in full for the loan, and that this failure to

10

accept constituted Defendants’ agreement to Plaintiff’s purported cancellation of the loan. See

11

Amend. Compl. at 7:27-8:7. Plaintiff contends that he tendered payment for a residential mortgage

12

loan in full through a written “Notice of Fault” and related documents allegedly delivered to BOA

13

defendants and/or MERS. This contention is false. Plaintiff has not delivered an original, valid

14

payment instrument to Defendants. The Notice of Fault and related documents at issue in this case

15

are fraudulent documents without any legal validity.

BACKGROUND FACTS

Despite Plaintiff’s

18

On February 6, 2006, Aspen Mortgage LLC (“Aspen”) loaned Plaintiff $232,000.00 (“Loan

19

1”) to purchase the property located at 4316 Blushed Meadows Road, North Las Vegas, Nevada

20

89031, Parcel #124-31-210-062. Loan 1 was secured by a deed of trust on the property recorded in

21

the Clark County Recorder’s Office. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (“MERS”)

22

acted as nominee for Aspen and was the nominal beneficiary under the deed of trust. Ticor Title of

23

Nevada, Inc. (“Ticor”) was the trustee. Also on February 6, 2006, Aspen loaned Plaintiff an

24

additional $58,0000 secured by a second deed of trust on the property recorded in the Recorder’s

25

Office. MERS acted as nominee for Aspen and was the nominal beneficiary under the second deed

26

of trust. Ticor was the trustee. MERS assigned the beneficial interest in the loan to BAC and

27

substituted ReconTrust as Trustee. Countrywide serviced the loans.

1

Plaintiff defaulted on his loan, so ReconTrust executed and recorded a “Notice of Default

2

and Election to Sell.” Recontrust also executed and recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale. However,

3

to date, the Trustee’s Sale has not taken place. Plaintiff does not allege that he is current on his loan

4

payments.

5

Plaintiff alleges he paid off the loans in full by tendering copies of documents, without any

6

actual payment, to Defendants. Amend. Compl. at 7:27-8:7. The series of documents at issue in this

7

case are fraudulent documents without any legal validity. Plaintiffs’ alleged “tender” of payment is

8

not merely insufficient, but nonexistent.

9

Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment should be denied because Plaintiff has failed to

10

include any relevant facts or supporting evidence, and only relies on conclusory allegations

11

regurgitated from his previously-filed pleadings.

12

III.

13

LEGAL ARGUMENT

14

A.

Applicable Standard

15

Summary judgment is appropriate only when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to

16

interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no

17

genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of

18

law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In assessing a motion for summary judgment, the evidence, together with

19

all inferences that can reasonably be drawn there from, must be read in the light most favorable to

20

the party opposing the motion. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587

21

(1986); County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2001). The

22

moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and

23

the material lodged by the moving party must be viewed in the light most favorable to the

24

nonmoving party. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970). "'[A] material issue of

25

fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the differing

26

versions of the truth.'" Lynn v. Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n, 804 F.2d 1472, 1483 (9th Cir. 1986)

27

(quoting Admiralty Fund v. Hugh Johnson & Co., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982)). On those

28

issues for which it bears the burden of proof, the moving party must make a showing that is

“sufficient for the court to hold that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving

2

party.” Calderone v. United States, 799 F.2d 254, 259 (6th Cir. 1986); see also Idema v.

3

Dreamworks, Inc., 162 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1141 (C.D. Cal. 2001). "A mere scintilla of evidence will

4

not do, for a jury is permitted to draw only those inferences of which the evidence is reasonably

5

susceptible; it may not resort to speculation." British Airways Bd. v. Boeing Co., 585 F.2d 946, 952

6

(9th Cir. 1978); see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 596 (1993)

7

("[I]n the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla of evidence presented supporting a position

8

is insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true,

9

the court remains free... to grant summary judgment."). The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence

10

in support of the plaintiff’s position will be insufficient to establish a genuine dispute there must be

11

evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,

12

477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).

13

B.

Plaintiff Fails to Establish Any Facts in Support of Summary Judgment

14

Plaintiff’s Motion is merely a recitation of conclusory allegations and citations to irrelevant

15

and disimilar cases contained in his previous filings (see e.g. Amended Complaint and Plaintiff’s

16

Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss). Plaintiff has failed to include a single fact in support

17

of his Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby precluding entry of same in his favor. Summary

18

judgment is appropriate only when the facts are developed and not in dispute. Merely alleging

19

vague conclusions, i.e. that “[d]efendants cannot show ownership of the alleged Mortgage Loan”

20

(Motion, 1:22-23) without absolutely any factual or other evidence in support of this claim, does not

21

meet the standard required to grant a Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff has not included any

22

facts and evidence to show that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; in fact, he has not

23

included any facts or evidence at all.

24

Further, even if this Court were to take all of Plaintiff’s allegations as true, the Complaint

25

still fails as a matter of law for the reasons stated in Defendants’ pending Motion to Dismiss, which

26

are briefly summarized below.

Plaintiff’s Securitization Argument is Meritless

2

Plaintiff claims that Defendants “are not the owners and holders in due course of the

3

Mortgage in question …[t]hrough securitization of this loan which is an illegal action by the bank to

4

alter accounting as well as deriving income from numerous sales...” Motion at 1:22-26. Plaintiff’s

5

claims have been consistently rejected by courts. Securitization of a loan does not diminish the

6

underlying power of sale that can be exercised upon the trustor's breach. Hafiz v. Greenpoint

7

Mortgage Funding, Inc., 652 F.Supp.2d 1039, 1043 (N.D.Cal. 2009) (argument that power of sale is

8

lost upon sale to a loan pool is "unsupported and incorrect"); Benham v. Aurora Loan Services LLC,

9

No. C-09-2059 SC, 2009 WL 2880232, at *3 (N.D.Cal. Sept. 1, 2009) (same); see also Ritter v.

10

Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-624, 2010 WL 2342535, at *1-2 (D.Nev. June 4, 2010)

11

(argument that plaintiffs did not know owner of loan due to securitization did not entitle plaintiffs to

12

a temporary restraining order).

13

Plaintiff’s theory that securitization of his loan provides a basis for a claim invalidating the

14

loan or Defendants’ rights to service the loan remains meritless and should be rejected.

15

D.

Plaintiff Has Failed to Establish Any Fraud by Defendants

16

Plaintiff claims that “[d]efendant Bank’s pretense of authority to continue collection of the

17

mortgage payments, to foreclose, or attempt to foreclose, under the Trust Deed would be

18

fraudulent.” Motion at 3:1-2. Plaintiff fails to cite any facts or evidence in support of his claim that

19

Defendants’ actions constitute fraud. As discussed in Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff’s

20

claim appears to be partially based on the contention that Defendants wrongfully induced him to

21

enter into an agreement for the loan(s). Amend. Compl. at 8:13-14. However, Plaintiff does not

22

allege any facts stating that any individual Defendant owed him a duty to make disclosures to him

23

about his loan(s) and the risks of the lending transaction(s) he entered. Nor could he. Defendants

24

were not involved in the origination of the loan.1

25
26
27

1

As discussed in Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, even if any defendant was the originating lender, which they
are clearly not, it is settled law in Nevada (and elsewhere) that a lender owes no fiduciary duty to advise the borrower
about the propriety of the loan. See, e.g., Reed v. Countrywide Bank, FSB, Case No. 2:09-cv-00319, slip op. at 5-6 (D.
Nev. Mar. 23, 2009) (mortgage lender owes no fiduciary duty to borrower, and no “exceptional circumstances” exist in
such a situation to give rise to a “special relationship”); Hoskins v. Countrywide Home Loans, Case No. 2:09-cv-00166,
slip op. at 2 (D. Nev. Mar. 18, 2009); Yerrington Ford, Inc., v. GMAC, 359 F. Supp. 2d 1075, 1089 (D. Nev. 2004),

1

In addition, Plaintiff cannot prevail on a fraud theory because he ratified the loan contracts by

2

his conduct. “Generally, contract ratification is the adoption of a previously formed contract,

3

notwithstanding a quality that rendered it relatively void and by the very act of ratification the party

4

affirming becomes bound by it and entitled to all proper benefits from it.” Merill v. Demott, 113

5

Nev. 1390, 1396, 951 P.2d 1040 (1997) (quoting Shagun v. Scott Mfg. Co., 162 F. 209, 219 (8th Cir.

6

1908)).

7

Plaintiff has failed to establish any facts or evidence in order to meet the burden required to

8

grant his Motion for Summary Judgment. Simply alleging generic “fraud,” without any evidence in

9

support of same, falls far short of the standard requiring that he establish that no genuine issue of

10

material facts exists.

11

E.

Moving Defendants’ Need Not Produce the Original Note

12

1.

Plaintiff’s “Securitization” Argument is Meritless

13

As discussed above, Plaintiff’s claim that Defendants have been paid in full for the note

14

because the note was “sold” has been consistently rejected. Securitization of a loan does not

15

diminish the underlying power of sale that can be exercised upon the trustor's breach. See Hafiz

16

(N.D.Cal. 2009). Plaintiff’s claim should be rejected.

17

2.

Moving Defendants Have No Duty To Produce The Original Note

18

Plaintiff asserts that Defendants have no claim to the payments due on the loan because they

19

failed to produce the original note. See Amend. Compl. at 8:3-5. As “support” Plaintiff asserts that

20

“many cases before Supreme Courts [sic] of the United States..have stated that failure to provide the

21

original Deed of Trust Mortgage, Note and other related original documents is cause for relief with

22

prejudice in favor of the Plaintiff…” Motion at 2:2-4. It is unclear which Supreme Court cases

23

Plaintiff references, but the case Plaintiff cites stems from a bankruptcy decision holding MERS

24

lacked standing to initiate a motion for relief from the automatic stay. (Motion, 2:6-11, citing

25

Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems v. Lisa Marie Chong, Lenard E. Schwartzer, Bankruptcy

26

Trustee, et al., Case No. 2:09-CV-0661-KJD-LRL (2009)).

This case is inapposite because

27
28

overruled on other grounds by Giles v. GMAC, 494 F.3d 865 (9th Cir. 2007). Defendants did not have any relationship
with Plaintiff before the loans closed.
{LV018150;1}

6

Case 2:10-cv-01950-GMN -LRL Document 21

1

Plaintiff’s lawsuit does not challenge actions taken in bankruptcy court (where Rule 17 real-party-in-

2

interest principles apply), and because Plaintiff has not alleged that MERS sought to initiate the

3

foreclosure.

4

Defendants have no duty to produce the original note, and such production is not necessary to

5

establish their right to enforce the terms of the loan. See Dinsmore-Thomas at 4 (C.D.Cal. 2009)

6

(“the Court cannot see how Defendant is required to return the original note to Plaintiff in lieu of a

7

copy of the note”). This Court has passed on this theory many times – and repeatedly rejected it.

8

Plaintiff's theory that Defendants waive all their rights or somehow finalize “the Lender’s claim as

9

satisfied in full” because they did not produce “the original wet ink contract” is meritless, and

insufficient to support summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor.

11

IV.

12

CONCLUSION

13

Plaintiff has failed to meet the stringent burden required to grant summary judgment in his

14

favor. He has failed to present any facts or evidence in support of any of his claims. Even if this

15

Court takes all of the allegations contained in Plaintiff’s Complaint and Motion as true, all claims

16

still fail as a matter of law, as established in Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.

17
18
19

For these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the court deny Plaintiff’s Motion for
Summary Judgment in its entirety.
