ISSUES
1.

Whether the defendant in a contempt proceeding can challenge the
underlying order allegedly violated.

2.

Whether the defendant’s jurisdictional arguments have already been
addressed and rejected in the underlying proceedings.

3.

Whether the Court can decide issues of fact in a motion to dismiss.
STATEMENT OF MOST APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY

United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 294 (1947)
is the most appropriate case for Issue 1. United States v. Peter and Doreen
Hendrickson, No. 2:06-cv-11753-NGE, is the most appropriate case for Issue 2.
United States v. Ali, 557 F.3d 715, 719 (6th Cir. 2009) is the most appropriate case
for Issue 3.
BACKGROUND
On May 14, 2013, a federal grand jury returned an indictment that charged
the defendant with one count of criminal contempt, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
401(3). The indictment alleges that the defendant willfully disobeyed the May 2,
2007, Amended Judgment and Order of Permanent Injunction (“Amended
3

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJM Doc # 19 Filed 07/12/13 Pg 4 of 10

Pg ID 82

Judgment”) issued by District Judge Nancy Edmunds of the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan against the defendant in the case of United States
v. Peter and Doreen Hendrickson, case number 2:06-cv-11753-NGE-RSW.
On June 28, 2013, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.1
Trial is scheduled to commence on August 20, 2013.
ARGUMENT
Rule 12 of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to
“raise by pretrial motion any defense, objection, or request that the court can
determine without a trial of the general issue.” See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2).
In support of her motion to dismiss, the defendant argues that (1) the
Amended Judgment was an unlawful order; (2) the district court lacked jurisdiction
to issue the Amended Judgment; (3) compliance with the Amended Judgment was
impossible; and (4) she did not violate the Amended Judgment. The defendant’s
first two arguments fail to support dismissal of the indictment because the district
court had jurisdiction to issue the Amended Judgment and a contempt proceeding
is not the proper forum to otherwise challenge the validity of the Amended
The defendant did not seek the concurrence of the government prior to
filing her motion. See Local Rule 7.1(a).

Judgment. The defendant’s latter two arguments are questions of fact not
appropriately adjudicated in a motion to dismiss.
A.

A Defendant in a Contempt Proceeding Generally Cannot
Challenge the Underlying Order

A defendant generally is not permitted to challenge in a contempt
proceeding the underlying order allegedly violated. See United States v. United
Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 294 (1947) (“It is for the court of first
instance to determine the question of the validity of the law, and until its decision
is reversed for error by orderly review, either by itself or by a higher court, its
orders based on its decision are to be respected, and disobedience of them is
contempt of its lawful authority, to be punished.”). The Supreme Court explained
the rationale behind this principle in Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 68–69 (1948):
It would be a disservice to the law if we were to depart from the
long-standing rule that a contempt proceeding does not open to
reconsideration the legal or factual basis of the order alleged to have
been disobeyed and thus become a retrial of the original controversy.
The procedure to enforce a court’s order commanding or forbidding an
act should not be so inconclusive as to foster experimentation with
disobedience. Every precaution should be taken that orders issue, in
turnover as in other proceedings, only after legal grounds are shown and
only when it appears that obedience is within the power of the party
being coerced by the order. But when it has become final, disobedience
cannot be justified by re-trying the issues as to whether the order should
have issued in the first place.

Pg ID 84

Thus, the defendant’s arguments challenging the validity of the Amended
Judgment are not appropriately addressed by the Court. Whether the Amended
Judgment unlawfully forces the defendant “to testify falsely,” see Motion to
Dismiss at 13, or is an “inherently and dangerously unlawful” violation of her
constitutional rights, see Motion to Dismiss at 6, is beyond the Court’s purview.
Instead, such arguments should be (and have been) presented to District Judge
Edmunds in the proceedings that led to the injunction. The Court should reject the
defendant’s improper attempts to use her criminal case to collaterally attack the
Amended Judgment.
B.

The Defendant’s Jurisdictional Arguments Have Been Rejected
Repeatedly by the District Court and the Sixth Circuit

The narrow exception to the principle that the underlying court order cannot
be challenged in a contempt proceeding is when the court issuing the underlying
order lacked jurisdiction to do so. See Petition of Green, 369 U.S. 689, 692 (1962)
(holding that the defendant was entitled to a hearing that the state court that issued
an injunction was without jurisdiction to do so); Walker v. City of Birmingham,
388 U.S. 307, 315 (1967) (distinguishing Petition of Green while noting “that this
is not a case where the injunction was transparently invalid or had only a frivolous
6

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJM Doc # 19 Filed 07/12/13 Pg 7 of 10

Pg ID 85

pretense to validity”); see also Cherokee Exp., Inc. v. Cherokee Exp., Inc., 924
F.2d 603, 607 (6th Cir. 1991) (barring a collateral attack to the validity of the
underlying judgment so long as the underlying court was of “competent
jurisdiction”). The Court, however, should not entertain the defendant’s
jurisdictional arguments because the same arguments have already been presented
and rejected in the underlying proceedings.
Here, the defendant unsuccessfully argued against jurisdiction prior to
District Judge Edmunds issuing the Amended Judgment.2 See No. 2:06-cv-11753,
docket ##20, 21, 33 (district court orders). The defendant’s “numerous challenges
to the district court’s jurisdiction and judgment” were similarly rejected on appeal
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. See id., docket #37 (United
States v. Peter and Doreen Hendrickson, No. 07-1510, slip op. at 2–3 (6th Cir.
June 12, 2008) (unpublished) (characterizing the defendant’s arguments “as plainly
baseless tax protester arguments” and “patently meritless”)). The Sixth Circuit

See No. 2:06-cv-11753, docket #4 (Defendants Motion to Dismiss for
Lack of Jurisdiction [and Other Relief]); id., docket #13 (Defendants’ Reply to
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment); id., docket ##18, 19 (Defendants’
Response[s] to the Magistrate’s “Report and Recommendation”); id., docket #26
(Motion for Relief From Judgment); id., docket #27 (Defendants’ Motion for
Reconsideration).

also sanctioned the defendant and her husband in light of “the patent baselessness
of the Hendricksons’ assertions on appeal.” Id. at 4. In 2009, the Supreme Court
denied the petitions for certiorari and rehearing filed by the defendant and her
husband. See id., docket ##41 and 42.
Undeterred, the defendant continued to present the same arguments to the
district court, which the district court again rejected.3 See id., docket ##67, 71, 88
(district court orders). The Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of the
defendant’s motions to vacate the judgment, noting that it had previously rejected
many of the defendant’s arguments. See id., docket #91 (United States v. Peter
and Doreen Hendrickson, No. 10-1824, slip op. at 3–5 (6th Cir. Nov. 22, 2011)
(unpublished)).
The defendant now attempts to use a motion to dismiss to rehash the same
jurisdictional arguments that have already been rejected repeatedly by the district

See No. 2:06-cv-11753, docket #47 (Defendants’ Response to
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery); id., docket #51 (Defendants’ Response to
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants to Render Dictated Testimony); id.,
docket #56 (Defendant’s Response to the Magistrate’s “Report and
Recommendation”); id., docket #58 (Motion to Vacate Judgment); id., docket #66
(Defendant’s Response to Plaintiff’s Second Motion to Hold Defendants in
Contempt); id., docket #69 (Motion for Reconsideration); id., docket #82 (Motion
to Vacate Judgment).

court and two different Sixth Circuit panels. Her meritless arguments should once
again be denied.
C.

Questions of Fact Cannot Be Decided in a Motion to Dismiss

The defendant lastly argues that she did not violate the injunction and that
compliance with the injunction was impossible. Both arguments are questions of
fact not appropriately adjudicated by a court in a motion to dismiss. See, e.g.,
United States v. Ali, 557 F.3d 715, 719 (6th Cir. 2009) (“A motion under Rule 12 is
therefore appropriate when it raises questions of law rather than fact.”).
CONCLUSION
The government respectfully requests that the Court deny the defendant’s
motion to dismiss the indictment.
