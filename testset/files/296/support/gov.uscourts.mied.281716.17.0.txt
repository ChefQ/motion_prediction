MOTION TO DISMISS a are

/ hy Mo ms)
Doreen Hendrickson Moves this Honorable Court to dismiss the. indictment charging her

with one count of criminal contempt of court. Mrs. Hendrickson believes that the `circumstances
and particulars involved in this charge will shock the conscience of this Honotable Court. `The
courts involved in the underlying case have badly misapprehended the facts and the law and have
issued or upheld orders which are plainly violative of Mrs. Hendrickson's speech rights and right
to due process, are contrary to statute and are issued without jurisdiction, as well as being
impossible to comply with in any event. As will be made clear by the accompanying brief Mrs.
Hendrickson is not in violation of any lawful order in regard to her tax documents. The orders

involved in these charges should be considered void and of no force and effect, and the charges

against Mrs. Hendrickson should be DISMISSED with PREJUDICE.

Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss

Statement of the Issues

Defendant Doreen Hendrickson has been charged under 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 401(3) with one
count alleging her willful failure to comply with a lawful order. The order in question was issued
in May of 2007, by Judge Nancy Edmunds, who commanded Mrs. Hendrickson to swear that she
believes testimonial declarations dictated by the government. Mrs. Hendrickson was ordered to
treat this dictated testimony as if it were her own genuine and freely-made testimony, and to
accept any and all legal consequences for it, as well. She was threatened with incarceration if she
chose not to create this false "testimony".

The "testimony" to which Mrs. Hendrickson was ordered to falsely swear to be her own
comprises declarations on income tax returns that she believes her earnings and those of her
husband during the years 2002 and 2003 are the product of activities properly and legally subject
to the federal income tax. This dictated "testimony" contradicts her actual and already long-since
freely-made testimony as to what she really believes concerning these matters.

It is important to emphasize that Mrs. Hendrickson was not ordered to testify. Mrs.
Hendrickson was ordered to impeach her own freely-made testimony, replace it with words
commanded by the state, and affix her signature to those words falsely declaring them to be her
own. Mrs. Hendrickson was also enjoined from testifying freely and sincerely on tax-related

instruments in the future.

Controlling Authority

The primary controlling authorities involved in this case are the First and Fifth Articles of
Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and conscience
and due process of law, and 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 7402(a) (controlling federal court jurisdiction to issue
injunctions) and 26 U.S.C. 0x00A7 6020(b) (mandating government production of returns when a
return is deemed required, and that a filed return is incorrect, and specifying that such
government-produced returns are a complete statutory remedy for any government interest in a

return).
Background and Statement of Facts

Judge Edmunds issued the orders seeking to control and dictate Doreen Hendrickson's
testimony without ever having met Mrs. Hendrickson. Judge Edmunds had no personal
knowledge of the facts concerning the Hendricksons' earnings or activities; she had seen no
evidence contradicting Mrs. Hendrickson's freely-made testimony; and had not had so much as a
single hearing in the matter before issuing the orders at the government's request.

At the same time, and again at the government's request, Judge Edmunds enjoined Mrs.
Hendrickson from testifying freely on future tax return affidavits by specifying certain beliefs for
which Mrs. Hendrickson would be punished should their influence somehow be allegedly
detected in her testimony. The orders made to Mrs. Hendrickson thus introduce into America for
the first time the prospect of officially-proscribed beliefs, the alleged embrace of which will

result in criminal charges.
 

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJIM Doc#17 Filed 06/28/13 Pg6of28 PgID48

Mrs. Hendrickson DID produce "amended returns" concerning 2002 and 2003 containing
the content dictated by the government in June of 2010, after the government moved the court to
begin fining her daily until she did so. These returns contain the content dictated to Mrs.
Hendrickson by the government, and clearly indicated that Mrs. Hendrickson was producing
them under duress and that they do not reflect Mrs. Hendrickson's actual beliefs concerning the
legal character of her earnings.

Six months later the government complained to the court that these accurate instruments
could not be processed by the IRS and successfully used as evidentiary support for its allegation
that Mrs. Hendrickson owed taxes for 2002 and 2003. The court then ordered Mrs. Hendrickson
to produce new "amended returns" with the same content but with the facts that they were
produced under duress, are as dictated by the government, and are not reflective of what Mrs.
Hendrickson believes to be true, concealed from view.

Mrs. Hendrickson complied with that command as closely as an honest conscience would
allow. This time she simply referred on the "reasons for filing" line of the 1040X forms she
completed to an affidavit she submitted to the court on which she indicated the coerced and
dictated character of these new "returns".

The government was still unsatisfied, apparently unable to tolerate any hint in the tax-
agency record that these false instruments were anything but testimony freely-made by Mrs.
Hendrickson. The government filed a new motion asking the court to hold Mrs. Hendrickson in
contempt, in February of 2011. Mrs. Hendrickson filed a response challenging the motion, and

no ruling on that matter has ever issued in the ensuing two-and-a-half years.
 

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJIM Doc#17 Filed 06/28/13 Pg 7of28 PgID49

As will be shown, even leaving aside the fundamental invalidity of the deeply-corrupt
core notion of enforced orthodoxy and the punishment of inconvenient testimony, contrary to the
allegations of the indictment Mrs. Hendrickson did NOT base any filing on the proscribed view
spelled-out in Judge Edmunds injunction. Nor did Mrs. Hendrickson willfully violate any lawful
and valid order to create and subscribe "amended returns" or to swear to her own belief in the
content of testimony dictated to her by others. She should not be punished, or even

inconvenienced, for having testified truthfully according to the law and her conscience.
Argument

A. Mrs. Hendrickson did NOT defy the order actually given in making her testimony
concerning 2008, regardless of its validity

The indictment alleges that Mrs. Hendrickson testified on her tax-related instruments
based on the notions that "only federal, state or local government workers are liable for the
payment of federal income tax or subject to the withholding of federal income, social security
and Medicare taxes from their wages under the internal revenue laws" (notions that Mrs.
Hendrickson fully agrees to be frivolous and even nonsensical), and that she was enjoined from
testifying based on these notions. These notions are alleged to be what is presented in the book,
Cracking the Code- The Fascinating Truth About Taxation In America, authored by Mrs.
Hendrickson's husband.

However, Mrs. Hendrickson has read the book and knows and understands its contents.
She knows that these false and frivolous notions are NOT presented in Cracking the Code..... The

gratuitous government-serving assertion to the contrary is that of a bureaucrat who carefully
 

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJIM Doc#17 Filed 06/28/13 Pg 8of28 PgID50

excerpted a few phrases from the book and presented them out of context in a government filing
in the underlying case. What the book actually DOES point out, among other things, is that
capitations and other direct taxes-- insofar as they fall on revenue or the activities which produce
it-- are taxes on unspecialized revenues (or the unspecialized activities which produce them) and
require apportionment, per Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 and Article 1, Section 9 Clause 4 of the
United States Constitution, and that the United States Supreme Court and other authorities have
plainly stated on numerous occasions that this requirement remains fully in place today.
Therefore, whatever qualifies as "income" subject to the unapportioned "income tax" is
necessarily of a specialized character. The nature of that special character is irrelevant here-- it is
enough that what qualifies for the tax is distinguished in some way from the broad class of
revenue or revenue-producing activity.

Cracking the Code... goes on to observe that because what qualifies as "income" subject
to the tax is specialized, what is not specialized-- that is, revenue not distinguished in any fashion
from the mere exercise of every American's individual rights to trade and engage in any lawful
economic, remunerative or gainful activity-- does not qualify for the tax. This is axiomatic, and
also plainly incorporated into the body of tax law as written.

Mrs. Hendrickson's returns are not informed by the fabricated and frivolous notion
falsely ascribed to the book Cracking the Code... by the government's lawyers. Rather, they are
informed by her understanding that not all revenue qualifies as "income", and her belief that her

earnings are of no special character, and are, instead, simply the non-"income" product of her
  
 

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJIM Doc#17 Filed 06/28/13 Pg9of28 PgID51

exercise of every American's individual rights to trade and engage in any lawful economic,
remunerative or gainful activity (see Affidavit of Doreen Hendrickson attached).

Mrs. Hendrickson's filings are also informed by her belief that when completing a tax
form for the purpose of declaring over her own sworn signature what, if any, of her earnings
qualifies for reporting as "income" fo the best of HER knowledge and belief, she surely has an
absolute right (and indeed, an obligation) to be truthful. Not having based her testimony on the
frivolous and nonsensical notion that, "only federal, state or local government workers are liable
for the payment of federal income tax or subject to the withholding of federal income, social
security and Medicare taxes from their wages under the internal revenue laws", Mrs.
Hendrickson did not defy the order issued by the court.

B. Orders seeking to dictate or otherwise control Mrs. Hendrickson's testimony are
inherently and dangerously unlawful, and violate the US Constitution's First and Fifth
Amendments

If Mrs. Hendrickson has been commanded to refrain from basing her filings on spurious
nonsense falsely ascribed to Cracking the Code..., then she has complied, even without regard to
the fundamental impropriety of such a command. If, however, the order is taken as a command
that she testify to an effect (or based on a notion) preferred by the court or the government (such
as to declare a belief that her earnings are of the taxable variety, or to base her filings on the
notion that ALL earnings are of a taxable variety)-- or to not testify to an effect disfavored by the

court or the government (such as in any fashion that declares her belief that her earnings are
  
 

2:13-cr-20371-VAR-LJIM Doc#17 Filed 06/28/13 Pg 100f28 PgID 52

NOT of the taxable class), it is a transparently unlawful order regardless of the context in which
it is given.

When context and particulars are considered, such an order is even more obviously
unlawful. When asked on a tax form to declare and certify her beliefs concerning what, if any, of
her earnings qualify as reportable "income"-- and to exclude from that declaration those earnings
she believes do not so qualify-- Mrs. Hendrickson has an absolute right (and indeed, an
obligation) to be truthful in light of her understanding of the law. In light of our Constitutional
protections, and the plain reporting requirements of the income tax laws, what could be more
self-evident?

No person, and especially no American, can be lawfully made to swear to facts or
Opinions contrary to what she believes to be true. This is so fundamental a principle that
Congress is explicitly prohibited from transgression in the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution. Indeed, the Supreme Court has affirmed that no circumstance can validly
compromise this principle:

"As we stated in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 319 U.

S. 642 (1943), `If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no

official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion,

or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.'"
First Unitarian Church v. Los Angeles, 357 U.S. 545 (1958).

No valid government interest can be served by such an order. Any government interest

needing such coercion and control of testimony in blatant defiance of the "fixed star in our
