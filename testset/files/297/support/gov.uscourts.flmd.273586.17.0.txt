_________________________________________/
DEFENDANT ALLIED INTERNATIONAL CREDIT’S MOTION
TO DISMISS OR FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT
Defendant, ALLIED INTERNATIONAL CREDIT (“AIC”), pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6), moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint (Dkt. #13) filed by
Plaintiff, MARLENE BEAUDIN (“Beaudin”), or for a more definite statement pursuant to Rule
12(e), and as grounds therefor states:
I.

Standard on a Motion to Dismiss

A complaint may be dismissed if the facts as pled do not state a claim for relief that is
plausible on its face. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009) (explaining “only a
complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss”); Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 561-62, 570 (2007) (retiring the prior “unless it appears beyond doubt
that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts” standard). Factual allegations in a complaint “must be
enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 2 of 10 PageID 121

allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555
(internal citations and emphasis omitted). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff
pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is
liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. However, where a complaint pleads facts that are “merely
consistent with” a defendant’s liability, it “stops short of the line between possibility and
plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at
566). The well-pled allegations must nudge the claim across the line from the merely
“conceivable” to the “plausible.” Id. at 570.
Furthermore, a complaint must contain more than just a repetition of the elements of a
cause of action to survive a motion to dismiss. It has to allege facts. In Twombly, the Supreme
Court emphasized a complaint “requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic
recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Thus,
“threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory
statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663. Moreover, the “tenet that a court must accept
as true all of the allegations contained in the complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.” Id.
II.

Facts and Legal Argument Relating to AIC
A.

Beaudin’s Allegations Do Not Plausibly
Demonstrate a Violation of the FDCPA

This case involves alleged violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692, et seq., and related state and federal statutes.

Beaudin’s

allegations with respect to AIC do not demonstrate that it committed a violation of the FDCPA
or any other law, and therefore the Amended Complaint does not state a claim. Only four
paragraphs of the Amended Complaint deal solely with AIC. Dkt. #13 ¶¶ 38–41. The alleged
facts contained in those allegations do not surmount the high hurdle of Iqbal and Twombly.

2

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 3 of 10 PageID 122

Beaudin alleges the following as to AIC:1
(1)

In April 2012, AIC called Beaudin attempting to collect a debt. Dkt. #13 ¶ 38.

This is perfectly legal under 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(a) (allowing initial communications with debtor
in an attempt to collect a debt); see McVey v. Bay Area Credit Service, No. 4:10–CV–359–A,
2010 WL 2927388, at *2–3 (N.D. Tex. July 26, 2010) (even multiple phone calls per week
seeking payment of debt did not constitute harassment or abuse).
(2)

In April 2012, Beaudin sent a letter requesting AIC to validate the debt and cease

all communication presumably under 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(b). Dkt. #13 ¶ 39. This was certainly
her right to do but it says nothing about AIC’s liability under the FDCPA.
(3)

In April 2012, after Beaudin began to receive calls from AIC attempting to collect

a debt, she received a “debt collection letter” “attempting to collect the alleged debt.” Dkt. #13 ¶
40. The assertion that the letter complained of was a “debt collection letter” “attempting to
collect the alleged debt” is conclusory. Medrando v. CTX Mortg. Co., LLC, No. 6:12–cv–704–
ORL–37KRS, 2012 WL 2931293, at *4 (M.D. Fla. July 18, 2012) (“Plaintiff’s contention that
Defendants are, or were, attempting to collect on a debt to which they have ‘no legal, equitable,
or pecuniary interest’ is simply conclusory….”); Aniel v. T.D. Service Co., No. C 10–03185
JSW, 2010 WL 3154087, at *1 (N.D. Cal. August 9, 2010) (allegations that defendants were
attempting to collect a debt under the FDCPA were conclusory). The Court can ignore this
allegation. The contents of the letter are not described in any way and the Court need not credit
Beaudin’s conclusory description of the letter. The letter could have been perfectly legitimate.

1

It is interesting and somewhat curious that Beaudin alleges virtually the exact same allegations
against all three supposed debt collectors named in the Amended Complaint. This seems to
undermine the plausibility of Beaudin’s allegations.

3

Filed 08/24/12 Page 4 of 10 PageID 123

Furthermore, communications that are merely informational and do not demand payment
cannot be considered communications “in connection with the collection of any debt” under the
FDCPA and are therefore not unlawful. See e.g., Bailey v. Security Nat'l Serv. Corp., 154 F.3d
384, 388–89 (7th Cir. 1998) (noting that only communications “in connection with the collection
of any debt” fall under the ambit of the FDCPA); Gillespie v. Chase Home Finance, LLC, No.
3:09–cv–191–TS, 2009 WL 4061428, at *5 (N.D. Ind. Nov. 20, 2009) (holding that letters were
not the type of communications proscribed by FDCPA where the letters only advised the
mortgagors that their delinquent debts had been turned over to another department and stated that
options may be available to the mortgagors to resolve their delinquencies and save their homes
from foreclosure). The Court and AIC are left to speculate as to the contents of the letter.
Indeed, the letter could have been one allowed by 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(a)(1)-(5). Without more
well-pled facts describing what was in the letter, the Amended Complaint does not state a claim.
In short, Beaudin should provide a more definite statement and describe the contents of
the letter or, better yet, attach it to her complaint. See, e.g., Brooks v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, Civil
Action No. 11–67, 2011 WL 2710026, at *7 (E.D. La. July 12, 2011) (holding that plaintiffs’
allegation that they received “threatening letters,” but not stating the contents of the letters, were
conclusory and inadequate).
(4)

At some point (no date is specified) AIC allegedly failed to provide validation of

the debt and failed to cease unspecified communication with Beaudin. Dkt. #13 ¶ 41.
First, Beaudin’s claim that AIC failed to respond to her request for validation does not
violate the law. Dkt. #13 ¶ 41. Courts recognize the FDCPA allows a collection agency to
respond to a request for debt verification by ceasing all collection activity without verifying the
debt. See Smith v. Transworld Sys., Inc., 953 F.2d 1025, 1031–32 (6th Cir. 1992) (finding that

4

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 5 of 10 PageID 124

debt collector did not violate the FDCPA by failing to verify the consumer’s debt in response to
his request for verification because the debt collector ceased collection activity after receiving
the request); Jang v. A.M. Miller, 122 F.3d 480, 483 (7th Cir.1997) (holding that collection
agencies did not violate the FDCPA by not sending the requested verification because the
agencies ceased all collection activity after the consumer requested verification).
Second, Beaudin complains in paragraph 41 that after the validation request AIC failed to
comply with her request to cease all communication. Dkt. #13 ¶41. However, under limited
circumstances, the FDCPA does not prohibit further communication after a request by a debtor
to cease all communication.

The limited circumstances are described in 15 U.S.C. §

1692c(c)(1)–(3):
(c) CEASING COMMUNICATION. If a consumer notifies a debt collector in
writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt
collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not
communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt, except -(1) to advise the consumer that the debt collector’ further efforts are being
terminated;
(2) to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke specified
remedies which are ordinarily invoked by such debt collector or creditor; or
(3) where applicable, to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor
intends to invoke a specified remedy.
Id.
Nothing in Beaudin’s allegations explain the type of communication that AIC allegedly
sent her after she requested that all communication cease. The communication could have been
the type allowed by 15 U.S.C. § 1692c(c)(1)–(3) described above. The Court can only guess as
to the contents of the communication. The communication could have been permissible.
Far from alleging misconduct, these allegations give rise to an inference of permissible
conduct. Because Beaudin’s conclusory allegations are consistent with innocent conduct, they do

5

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 6 of 10 PageID 125

not pass the plausibility standard of Iqbal. See MediaXposure Ltd. v. Harrington, No. 8:11–CV–
410–T–TGW, 2012 WL 1805493, at *9 (M.D. Fla. May 17, 2012) (“The Supreme Court
indicated in Iqbal and Twombly that, where there is an alternative inference of permissible
conduct, allegations that are merely consistent with liability are insufficient.”). Where a
complaint pleads facts that are “merely consistent with” a defendant’s liability, it “stops short of
the line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678
(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 566). In applying the Twombly/Iqbal standard to a motion to
dismiss, courts have held that plausibility refers “to the scope of the allegations in a complaint: if
they are so general that they encompass a wide swath of conduct, much of it innocent, then the
plaintiffs ‘have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.’” See e.g.,
Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at
570).
All told, given the allegations in the Amended Complaint, the Court cannot determine
whether a violation of the statute even occurred. Each of the allegations is consistent with
innocent conduct—meaning that each allegation amounts to nothing as far as Twombly and Iqbal
are concerned. Of course, this also means the allegations in the aggregate mean nothing. As
Second Circuit Judge Calabresi once wrote in a different context, “The adding of zeros to zeros,
no matter how many, cannot amount to more than zero.” United States v. Martinez, 54 F.3d
1040, 1045 (2d Cir. 1995) (Calabresi, J. concurring).
There is perhaps no better example of a complaint that “stops short of the line between
possibility and plausibility” than this one. Beaudin cannot meet her burden under the relevant
pleading standard merely by presenting a meager assortment of conclusory allegations, each no
more consistent with misconduct than with innocence. To get past Iqbal and Twombly, Beaudin

6

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 7 of 10 PageID 126

must plead facts regarding the type of communication or misconduct engaged in by AIC that
violate the FDCPA (alleging with facts that the communications involved an attempt to collect a
debt, that they were not of the type contemplated by 15 U.S.C. § 1692c(c)(1)-(3), or that they
were not the type described in 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(a)(1)-(5)).
Furthermore, the allegations in the various Counts of the Amended Complaint add
literally nothing to “nudge” the claims against AIC “across the line from conceivable to
plausible.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. There are no facts alleged in the Counts; they merely
recite virtually verbatim the language from certain provisions of statutes alleged to have been
violated. Of course, “parroting” the words of a statute is entirely insufficient to state a claim.
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (a complaint “requires more than labels and conclusions, and a
formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”); see also Brooks v. Ross,
578 F.3d 574, 581 (7th Cir. 2009) (“We understand the Court in Iqbal to be admonishing those
plaintiffs who merely parrot the statutory language of the claims that they are pleading
(something that anyone could do, regardless of what may be prompting the lawsuit), rather than
providing some specific facts to ground those legal claims, that they must do more.”). In other
words, merely reciting the words of the statute is insufficient to provide the “showing” required
by Rule 8 and subjects such a defective complaint to dismissal. Id.
Beaudin’s Amended Complaint as it pertains to AIC should be dismissed, or she should
provide a more definite statement better describing with facts AIC’s alleged violation of the
FDCPA and the other statutes.
B.

Beaudin Improperly Lumps Defendants Together,
Requiring Dismissal or a More Definite Statement

Beaudin indiscriminately lumps all defendants together in all but Count III relating to J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank. Beaudin has thus failed to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.

7

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 8 of 10 PageID 127

Rule 8(a) requires that a complaint contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that
the pleader is entitled to relief,” and that each allegation be pleaded in a “simple, concise, and
direct” manner. Laing v. Cordi, No. 2:11–cv–566–FtM–29SPC, 2012 WL 2999700, at *3 (M.D.
Fla. July 23, 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although a complaint against multiple
defendants is usually read as making the same allegation against each defendant individually,
Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir.1997), factual allegations must give each
defendant “fair notice” of the nature of the claim and the “grounds” on which the claim rests.
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 561–62, 570 (2007). The Amended Complaint hardly
gives “fair notice” to any of the defendants of the claims against them.
A plaintiff’s “grouping” of defendants in a complaint requires dismissal or a more
definite statement. See Veltmann v. Walpole Pharm., 928 F. Supp. 1161, 1164 (M.D. Fla. 1996)
(condemning “a complaint [that] fails to separate each alleged act by each defendant into
individually numbered paragraphs” and noting that it “is virtually impossible to ascertain from
the Complaint which defendant committed which alleged act.”); Lane v. Capital Acquisitions &
Mgmt., Co., No. 04–60602, 2006 WL 4590705, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 14, 2006) (“By lumping all
the defendants together in each claim and providing no factual basis to distinguish their conduct,
the [ ] Complaint fails to satisfy the minimum standards of Rule 8.”).
A more definite statement is in order here. As an example, Beaudin does not offer any
factual allegations about false or misleading actions on the part of AIC, only that AIC made
certain phone calls without specifying the content, sent her a letter, failed to provide validation of
the debt, and failed to cease unspecified communications with her. Dkt. #13 ¶¶ 38-41. Again,
this is all consistent with lawful conduct. Yet, AIC is accused in unadorned, unsupported, and
conclusory allegations that it variously annoyed, oppressed, harassed, abused, and lied to

8

Case 6:12-cv-01084-GAP-TBS Document 17

Filed 08/24/12 Page 9 of 10 PageID 128

Beaudin, and even used an “automatic telephone dialing system” to collect a debt. See Counts III and IV-VI. Nowhere in the Amended Complaint are there any facts pled that would support
these accusations against AIC. Of course, these perfunctory allegations do not rise to the level
required by Twombly to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for dismissal. But in the unlikely
event that any other defendant engaged in this type of alleged behavior, Beaudin should be
required to distinguish among the defendants and describe with facts what acts each defendant
undertook to violate the various statutes pled. Lumping all the defendants together and cavalierly
accusing them of the exact same misdeeds as if the plaintiff were reciting the alphabet by rote is
simply not permissible.
III.

Conclusion

For the reasons stated above, the Amended Complaint should be dismissed or Beaudin
should be ordered to provide a more definite statement alleging facts for each cause of action that
plausibly state claims against AIC and the other defendants.
