INTRODUCTION

2

Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“Motion”) asks this Court to

3

dismiss Plaintiffs’ Eighth Claim for Relief insofar as that claim seeks statutory minimum

4

damages under the California Bane Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1) for the class and for Priscilla

5

Bunton, one of the five named plaintiffs. Defendant’s request for a dismissal of claims in this

6

Motion applies to these two, and only these two, specific claims. The sole basis presented in

7

support of the Motion is that plaintiffs failed to file a class government tort claim and Plaintiff

8

Bunton failed to file an individual claim with respect to these two specific damages claims as

9

required by Cal. Gov’t Code § 945.4 of the Government Tort Claims Act (“the Tort Claims

10

Act”). Although styled a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, Defendant’s Motion ignores the

11

allegations and requested relief in the First Amended Complaint.1 Both of defendant’s

12

arguments should be rejected by this Court for the following reasons:

13

1.

This civil rights case is brought by five named plaintiffs individually and

14

on behalf of a class of Antioch residents who have been and are being targeted by city officials

15

and the Antioch Police Department based on their race and their status as Section 8 tenants.

16

Because this class action case has been primarily brought to obtain declaratory and injunctive

17

relief for these residents to bring a halt to this discriminatory, unlawful, and unconstitutional

18

policy and practice, the lawsuit is not subject to the requirements of the Tort Claims Act, even

19

though the First Amended Complaint (“Complaint”) does include a prayer for statutory

20

minimum damages as an ancillary part of the overall relief. Therefore, any alleged inadequacies

21

in the tort claims filed by the other four named plaintiffs are immaterial.

22

2.

Even if this lawsuit were subject to the administrative claims

23
24
25
26
27

1

Defendant’s motion is not contemplated by the Case Management Order in this case and is
arguably a premature attempt to adjudicate the merits of this case prior to class certification.
Californians for Disability Rights v. Cal. Dept. of Transp., 249 F.R.D. 334, 345 (N.D. Cal. 2008)
(citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974)). See Case Management Order
(Doc. No. 26 (10/02/2008)). Given the allegations of the First Amended Complaint, the issue of
whether there has been compliance with the government claim’s statute raises issues of fact more
appropriately tested in a summary judgment motion, a motion which would likewise be
premature prior to the class certification determination.

requirements, plaintiffs complied with the requirements of the Tort Claims Act by filing claims

2

on behalf of the class, alleging an unlawful policy affecting other families like theirs (i.e.,

3

African-American Section 8 residents of Antioch). Since Plaintiff Bunton is a member of the

4

class, her damage claims are not barred by her lack of a claim.

5

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6

Defendant ignores the allegations of the First Amended Complaint, which must be

7

taken as true for purposes of this motion. See Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co.,

8

Inc., 896 F.2d 1542, 1550 (9th Cir. 1990). Plaintiffs allege that the City of Antioch and the

9

Antioch Police Department have engaged in a concerted campaign to reduce the African-

10

American Section 8 population and discourage any additional Section 8 families from moving to

11

Antioch. (First Amended Complaint ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs “charge that the City of Antioch

12

intentionally discriminates against African-American Section 8 households on the basis of their

13

race and/or source of income, and has pursued policies and practices that have an unjustified

14

adverse impact upon them.” (Id. at ¶ 3.) As victims of this campaign by defendant, Plaintiffs

15

allege that they have been subjected to a pattern of unlawful and discriminatory policies and

16

practices, including, among other things, the unwarranted and abusive investigations, unfounded

17

complaints to the Housing Authority in an attempt to have Section 8 vouchers revoked, and

18

threatening letters to landlords so as to influence landlords to evict Section 8 tenants. (Id. at ¶ 2).

19

Additionally, plaintiffs allege that they have been subject to a pattern and practice of illegal

20

searches of their homes. (Id. at ¶ 51.) Plaintiffs further allege that this pattern and practice of

21

unlawful conduct is ongoing and will continue unless enjoined by this Court. (Id. at ¶¶ 45-58,

22

143.) All plaintiffs allege they are current recipients of Section 8 benefits. (Id. at ¶¶ 59, 66, 74,

23

83, 90.) Four of the five plaintiffs allege they are current residents of Antioch, and the fifth,

24

plaintiff Payne, alleges she desires to move back in order to be closer to her disabled son’s

25

school. (Id. at ¶¶ 59, 66, 74, 83, 98.)2

26
27

2

Plaintiff Payne has moved back to Antioch since the filing of the First Amended Complaint.

As stated in the introduction of the Complaint, “This class action primarily seeks

2

to end the City’s discriminatory and unlawful policies and practices. This action also seeks

3

statutory minimum damages for the class, and additional damages for the named plaintiffs.”

4

(First Amended Complaint ¶¶ 4, 99 (“All damage claims made in [the Complaint] are incidental

5

to and secondary to the injunctive relief claims.”). Specifically, plaintiffs request injunctive

6

relief prohibiting defendant from:

7
8

1.

different basis from similarly situated non-class members;

9
10

2.

Engaging in, or seeking to engage in, unlawful and pretextual searches of

the homes of class members;

11
12

Disproportionately targeting class members for criminal investigation on a

3.

Handling disturbance or nuisance complaints concerning Section 8

households differently from non-Section 8 households;

13

4.

Communicating, in writing or otherwise, false or unlawfully obtained

14

information of criminal and nuisance activity about class members to the Housing Authority of

15

the County of Contra Costa or to class members’ landlords;

16
17

5.

Engaging in communications, written or otherwise, to class members’

landlords for the purpose of causing class members’ eviction; and

18

6.

Soliciting complaints about class members from their neighbors and

19

others.

20

(Id. at ¶ 2.) On behalf of the class, Plaintiffs only request monetary relief in the form of statutory

21

minimum damages under the California Bane Act. (Id. at 33 ¶ 4.)

22

Plaintiff Bunton alleges conduct by the Antioch police similar to that alleged on

23

behalf of the class. Bunton alleges that, in September 2006, officers arrived at her home to

24

discuss noise complaints about her household. (First Amended Complaint ¶ 84.) However, the

25

officers proceeded to search her home, even though Bunton refused to consent to the search and

26

the officers had no other lawful authority to do so. (Id. at ¶ 85.) The officers searched her entire

27

home, including drawers, and allegedly found men’s clothing and other men’s personal items.

28

(Id.) Although Ms. Bunton was fully compliant, the police nonetheless sent a letter to the

1

Housing Authority the day after this event alleging that Ms. Bunton had an unauthorized male

2

resident and that her household had received minor noise complaints, including noise from

3

children playing basketball in the evening. (Id. at ¶ 86.) As a result of this letter and an Antioch

4

police officer’s testimony, Ms. Bunton’s Section 8 benefits were terminated. (Id. at ¶ 87.) Her

5

benefits were later reinstated after a reviewing court found that the hearing officer’s findings of

6

fact were not supported by evidence in the record. (Id.) As a result of this conduct, “[Antioch’s

7

police] practices cause Ms. Bunton to fear contacting APD for any purpose and avoid inviting

8

individuals to her home because she might be subjected to further APD interference.” (Id. at ¶

9

89.)

10

The First Amended Complaint further states that Plaintiffs Williams, Scott,

11

Coleman, and Payne filed timely notices of claims for money damages against the City pursuant

12

to the Tort Claims Act and that “[e]ach notice alleged that the conduct was part of an illegal

13

policy and practice of discriminatory targeting of African Americans who participate in the

14

Section 8 Voucher Program in Antioch.” (First Amended Complaint ¶ 99; see, e.g., Tort Claim of

15

Mary Ruth Scott, Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Ex. B1 (“These actions were part of the

16

Department’s illegal policy and practice of discriminatory targeting of African-American families

17

like mine who participate in the federal Section 8 housing subsidy program in Antioch.”))

19

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) and motions to

20

dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) are “functionally identical,” and thus the

21

same standard of review applies to both. Dworkin v. Hustler Magazine Inc., 867 F.2d 1188,

22

1192 (9th Cir. 1989). In this Circuit, such a motion is “viewed with disfavor and is rarely

23

granted.” Gilligan v. Jamco Dev. Corp., 108 F.3d 246, 249 (9th Cir. 1997).

24

“A judgment on the pleadings is properly granted when, taking all the allegations

25

in the pleadings as true, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fairbanks

26

N. Star Borough v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 543 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal

27

quotation omitted). In determining a Rule 12(c) motion, the Court must accept the non-moving

28

party’s allegations as true and assume the moving party’s allegations, which the non-moving

party has denied, are false. See Hal Roach Studios, Inc., 896 F.2d at 1550. “Moreover, all

2

inferences reasonably drawn from these facts must be construed in favor of the responding

3

party.” Tong v. Capital Management Servs. Group, Inc., 520 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1147 (N.D. Cal.

4

2007) (citing Gen. Conference Corp. of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Seventh-Day Adventist

5

Congregational Church, 887 F.2d 228, 230 (9th Cir. 1989)).

ARGUMENT
I.

8

THIS LAWSUIT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CLAIMS REQUIREMENTS
OF THE GOVERNMENT TORT CLAIMS ACT

9

Defendant blithely assumes that this civil rights lawsuit is a case for “money or

10

damages” brought against a public entity within the meaning of Cal. Govt. Code § 945.4. (See

11

Motion at 4-5.) In doing so, it ignores both the allegations and overall thrust of plaintiffs’

12

complaint, and the case law setting forth the standards courts use to determine whether the non-

13

pecuniary aspects of lawsuits seeking equitable and monetary relief from government entities are

14

within the purview of the claims requirements of the Tort Claims Act. When this Court takes the

15

actual complaint and the relevant case law into account, it should rule that this lawsuit is not

16

subject to the Tort Claims Act’s claims requirements, and thus defendant’s arguments to dismiss

17

the damages claims of the class and Ms. Bunton must fail.
A.

19

The Government Tort Claims Act is Not Applicable to Cases in Which the
Primary Objective is to Obtain Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against
Unlawful Practices By a Government Entity.

20

Because Government Code § 945.4 makes filing a claim a prerequisite only to a

18

21

“suit for money or damages,” the requirement does not apply to cases brought “primarily” for

22

injunctive or declaratory relief, even though damages are also part of the relief sought. See Gatto

23

v. County of Sonoma, 98 Cal. App. 4th 744, 761 (2002).3 In Gatto, the court recognized that

24
25
26

3

See also, M.G.M. Const. Co. v. Alameda County, 615 F. Supp 149, 151 (N.D. Cal. 1985)
(“[T]he Court is persuaded . . . that the notice of claims provision should not apply . . . since the
primary relief sought is a declaration that the County's affirmative action program violates state
law” and “damages available . . . are relatively small.”); Lozada v. City and County of San
Francisco, 145 Cal. App. 4th 1139, 1166-68 (2006); Eureka Teacher’s Ass’n. v. Bd. of Educ.,
202 Cal. App. 3d 469, 474-75 (1988) (“Because . . . claim for backpay and fringe benefits was
incidental to her request for reemployment[, it]was not a claim for money or damages within the

1

both state and federal case law agree that Tort Claims Act claims requirements do not apply to

2

lawsuits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, where “the vindication of the present and

3

future rights of a large class of . . . persons was the primary purpose of the litigation, and the

4

money damages they also sought was merely incidental to that overreaching goal.” Id. at 761.

5

Courts have consistently held that the Tort Claims Act requirement does not apply

6

to lawsuits in which the chief purpose is to vindicate the civil rights of a group of persons by

7

bringing a halt to ongoing unlawful government practices. For example, in Indep. Hous. Servs.

8

of San Francisco v. Fillmore Center Assoc., 840 F. Supp. 1328 (N.D. Cal. 1993), the plaintiffs

9

sought declaratory and injunctive relief against a redevelopment agency’s unlawful conduct in

10

violation of state and federal civil rights laws that required developments to be accessible to the

11

disabled. The injunctive relief, which included an immediate cessation of funding while the

12

unlawful conduct continued, was coupled with a request for an award of damages. Id. at 1358.

13

The court found that administrative tort claims under the Tort Claims Act were not required:

14
15
16
17

While plaintiffs do seek damages, their request for an injunction
declaring that the Agency is in violation of the handicap access
laws and must comply with them in the future is of great weight
and not just ancillary to the request for damages. IHS’s potential
damages are small and particularly inconsequential compared to
the effect of the declarations it seeks.

18

Id. As in this case, the plaintiffs in Gibson v. County of Riverside, 181 F. Supp. 2d 1057 (C.D.

19

Cal. 2002), were individual residents suing on their own behalf and representing a class of

20

residents challenging local zoning laws involving age restrictions which directly affected their

21

households and their families. While the complaint sought compensatory and even punitive

22

Cases in which a government tort claim was required are consistent with this
analysis. For example, in Gatto, the court acknowledged that many state law civil rights cases
include claims for injunctive relief, but that such actions would not be exempted from the claims
requirements in cases “where the plaintiff does seek to recover damages from a public entity and
that is his or her chief purpose.” 98 Cal. App. 4th 744, 760 (emphasis in original). In Gatto, an
individual sued under the Unruh Civil Rights Act for being ejected from a county fair for
wearing a motorcycle club vest, and sought damages of $35,000, as well as injunctive and
declaratory relief. The court reviewed the complaint and determined that monetary damages
were the “primary purpose of the action.” Id. at 762. “Nothing in the record suggests Gatto ever
considered his interest in obtaining money damages subsidiary to his interest in injunctive relief.
Damages are the first thing mentioned in the title of his complaint and the prayer for relief . . . .”
Id. at 763. This is certainly in sharp contrast to the allegations in this case. Likewise, in City of
San Jose v. Superior Court, 12 Cal. 3d 447 (1974), the three individual plaintiffs sought
$500,000 in damages and the class members sought “recovery for the diminution in the market
value of their property . . . on theories of nuisance and inverse condemnation.” Id. at 453. There
is no indication that plaintiffs or the class sought injunctive relief.
The court in Lozada, 145 Cal. App. 4th at 1139, also determined that the claims
requirement applied because the damages claims were primary. The reasoning of the court
supports plaintiffs’ argument that the damages claims in this case are ancillary. The complaint in
Lozada was brought by an individual police officer who alleged that his state law procedural
rights were violated in the course of a departmental investigation. The court found that the
damages claim (including civil penalties amounting to $325,000) was “the primary focus of his
action” because of factors that are quite distinct from this case:

[T]he record does not indicate that he had any ‘transcendent
interest’ in injunctive or declaratory relief, beyond his ability to
obtain civil penalties and actual damages if the court found the
department to have acted with ‘malice.’ Lozada was never
suspended and so did not seek reinstatement. Nor did he
specifically seek reassignment or transfer through a mandamus
action or in his prayers for injunctive and declaratory relief . . . .
(citation omitted). [D]amages are the first thing mentioned in the
title and the prayer for relief of his first and second amended
complaints.

Id. at 1168-69; see also Loehr v. City of Ventura, 147 Cal. App. 3d 1071, 1081-82 (1983)
(concluding that the “primary purpose” of this individual wrongful termination case is
“pecuniary in nature,” and noting that even the claims for injunctive relief and mandamus “seek
recovery for loss of future earnings, emotional and mental distress, pain and suffering,
humiliation, and damage to reputation” in the amount of $1,000,000 in general damages and $2.5
million in punitive damages).
C.

Plaintiffs’ and Class’ Primary Purpose is to Obtain Injunctive and
Declaratory Relief Against Defendant’s Unlawful and Discriminatory
Policies and Practices and Thus, the Government Tort Claims Act
Requirements Do Not Apply.
This lawsuit is in sharp contrast to Gatto, Lozada, and Loehr. From the

“Introduction” of the Complaint, the allegations focus on defendant’s policy and practice of
“intentionally discriminat[ing] against African-American Section 8 households on the basis of
their race and/or source of income” and pursuing “policies and practices that have had an
unjustified adverse impact upon them.” (First Amended Complaint at 3.)
Defendant’s illegal policies and practices affect the plaintiffs and class members
in their daily lives. As current residents likely to be subjected to this unlawful conduct, it is
obvious that to these plaintiffs and class members obtaining injunctive and declaratory relief that
will bring a halt to these discriminatory and intimidating practices is “of great weight.” See
Indep. Hous. Servs. of San Francisco, 840 F. Supp. at 1358. Furthermore, whereas the
complaints in cases in which the Tort Claims Act requirements applied begin and end with an
emphasis on the damages claims, the complaint in this case is quite the opposite – it focuses
throughout on plaintiffs’ chief purpose to challenge and bring to an end the City’s “concerted

campaign to reduce the African-American Section 8 population and discourage Section 8

2

families from moving to Antioch.” (First Amended Complaint ¶ 2.) In contrast to Lozada,

3

where the plaintiff had stipulated that his complaint was for “primarily, money or damages,

4

while [his] claims for declaratory/injunctive relief were merely incidental,” 145 Cal. App. 4th at

5

1170, the Complaint here alleges as follows:

6
7
8

This class action primarily seeks to end the City’s discriminatory
and unlawful policies and practices. Secondly, this action seeks
statutory minimum damages for the class, and additional damages
for the named plaintiffs.

9

(First Amended Complaint ¶ 4.) Also, and again in contrast to Gatto, Lozada and Loehr, the

10

Prayer for Relief in the Complaint reflects plaintiffs’ chief purpose by focusing on the non-

11

pecuniary claims for relief and spelling out in detail the specific practices that plaintiffs seek to

12

enjoin. (First Amended Complaint at 32 ¶ 2(a-f).) Under pleading standards applicable to this

13

motion, these allegations alone are sufficient to defeat the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.

14

See Hal Roach Studios, Inc., 896 F.2d at 1550.

15

Plaintiffs and the class specifically allege an ongoing pattern or practice of

16

discrimination and otherwise unlawful conduct that falls disproportionately on African

17

Americans and seek to enjoin specific practices of the Antioch Police Department. (First

18

Amended Complaint ¶ 2.) For example, Plaintiffs make class-wide allegations that the Antioch

19

Police Department engages in unwarranted and disparately abusive investigations of minor

20

complaints against African-American Section 8 tenants (id. ¶ 47), sends letters to the Housing

21

Authority in an attempt to terminate Section 8 housing benefits (id.), searches homes without

22

consent or any other lawful authority (id. at ¶ 51), and solicits and encourages complaints from

23

neighbors against African-American, Section 8 households (id. at ¶ 53). Plaintiff Bunton

24

likewise alleges an ongoing course of intimidation and harassment by the Antioch Police

25

Department since she moved to Antioch to be closer to her mother and to provide better living

26

conditions for her children. (Id. at ¶¶ 83, 89.)

27

In contrast to cases finding that damages are the primary purpose of the action,

28

this very substantial request for injunctive relief is coupled with limited damage claims for the

class. The only class monetary relief sought is statutory minimum damages under the Bane Act.

2

See Cal. Civil Code § 52(a) (providing statutory minimum damages of $4,000). No class

3

compensatory or punitive damages are sought. Moreover, the proposed class includes future

4

class members who, by definition, do not have any current claims for damages and thus, whose

5

interest in the case would be solely for injunctive and declaratory relief. (First Amended

6

Complaint ¶ 17 (“Plaintiffs bring this action . . . on behalf of a class of all African-Americans

7

who . . . may hold . . . Section 8 housing vouchers, . . . and all members of their households who

8

. . . will reside in the City of Antioch.”) Furthermore, none of the plaintiffs’ claims, including

9

Ms. Bunton’s non-class claims, seeks punitive damages, also confirming their ancillary nature.

10

When their individual claims are viewed together with the class claims, the primary purpose of

11

the lawsuit is clearly not money damages.

12

Therefore, it is clear that this is a case where the chief goal of all the plaintiffs –

13

both the individual plaintiffs and the class members – is injunctive and declaratory relief. This is

14

simply not a lawsuit “for money or damages” within the meaning of Gov. Code § 945.4.

II.

16

THE ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS FILED BY PLAINTIFFS
ALLEGE CLASS CLAIMS FOR STATUTORY DAMAGES.

17

Even if this Court determines that this suit is covered by the Government Tort

18

Claims Act, the administrative claims filed by the four plaintiffs were in compliance with the

19

statutory requirements for claims on behalf of a class of similar individuals. Since Plaintiff

20

Bunton is a member of the alleged class, her damage claims are likewise in compliance with the

21

Tort Claims Act.

22

A.

Plaintiffs’ Government Tort Claims Allege a Class Claim.

23

Defendant’s motion ignores the actual language of the administrative claims filed

24

in this case to support its second argument – that none of the four claims “indicated in any other

25

way that the claims were brought on behalf of a class.” (Motion at 2.) While selectively quoting

26

language from the claims so as to be able to mischaracterize them as “diverse and

27

individualized” (id. at 2, 7), defendant studiously omits the identical language in each tort claim

28

that shows they are not: “These actions were part of the Department’s illegal policy and practice

of discriminatory targeting of African-American families like mine who participate in the federal

2

Section 8 housing subsidy program in Antioch.” Tort Claim of Mary Ruth Scott, Motion Ex. B1

3

(emphasis added); see also Tort Claims of Alyce Denise Payne, Santeya Danyell Williams, and

4

Karen Latreece Coleman, Motion Exs. B2-4. Each of these tort claims were incorporated by

5

reference in the Complaint. (First Amended Complaint ¶ 99.)

6

Although each of the four claims provides facts concerning the actions of the

7

Antioch police officers that caused each plaintiff’s injuries, such actions were alleged to be part

8

of a pattern and practice of unlawful conduct by the police. Thus, each claim made it very clear

9

that all these actions by police officers were part of an official policy and practice that targeted

10

not just the individual claimant but other African-American residents of Antioch who receive

11

Section 8 benefits. The test enunciated by the City of San Jose Court is “substantial compliance”

12

with the Tort Claims Act, and that test is met by an administrative claim that provides specific

13

information about the representative plaintiff “and then sufficient information to identify and

14

make ascertainable the class itself.” 12 Cal. 3d at 457.

15

The four claims filed in this case clearly meet the “substantial compliance” test by

16

identifying for the City a class of African-American residents of Antioch who receive Section 8

17

benefits. And, in fact, the language of the claims quoted above is even more detailed and

18

descriptive than if the claimants had simply added the phrase “on behalf of all others similarly

19

situated” after describing what happened to them, which even defendant concedes has been

20

found sufficient by courts to satisfy the Tort Claims Act requirements for class claims. (Motion

21

at 5 n.5.) See also California School Employees Ass’n v. Tustin Unified School Dist., 148 Cal.

22

App. 4th 510 (2007) (finding organization had complied with the Tort Claims Act by filing

23

complaint on behalf of one member and referencing its effects on other members even though

24

the organization did not use the “similarly situated” language). Administrative claims “need not

illegal conduct.

B.

3

Defendant Improperly Conflates the Requirements for the
Administrative Claims Procedure with the Requirements for Judicial
Class Certification in the Litigation.

4

Defendant also attempts to import class certification standards into the claim’s

5

exhaustion process in arguing that the claims fail to meet the “substantial compliance” test

6

because they “fail to establish a well-defined community of interest in questions of law and fact.”

7

(Motion at 7.) While it is true that the court in San Jose did find that there was an “insufficient

8

community of interest,” that conclusion had absolutely nothing to do with the sufficiency of the

9

administrative claims – rather, the Court was discussing at that point in its opinion the

10

requirements for class certification after a full evidentiary hearing before the trial court. San

11

Jose, 12 Cal. 3d at 458-63.

12

Throughout the Motion, defendant conflates the requirements for “substantial

13

compliance” in the claims procedure with the more exacting requirements for judicial class

14

certification in the litigation.4 Administrative claims “need not contain the detail and specificity

15

required of a pleading, but need only ‘fairly describe what [the] entity is alleged to have done.’”

16

Stockett, 34 Cal. 4th at 446 (quoting Shoemaker, 2 Cal. App. 4th at 1426)). Given that such

17

claims are filed by mail and often without the assistance of lawyers, courts have stressed that the

18

statutory claims requirements “should not be applied to snare the unwary.” Stockett, 34 Cal. 4th

19

at 446 (quoting Elias v. San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist., 68 Cal. App. 3d 70, 74

20

(1977)). Defendant’s argument that the administrative claims must provide “well-defined

21

communities of interest” flies in the face of the California Supreme Court’s admonition: “We do

22

not believe the claims statutes were intended to thwart class relief.” City of San Jose, 12 Cal. 3d

23

at 457.

24

If accepted, defendant’s standards for administrative class claims would make it

That defendant is conflating the requirements for a class claim under the Tort Claims Act with
the requirements for class certification of a federal case is confirmed by its incorporation of
legal arguments from its brief opposing class certification into its brief supporting its Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings (Motion at 7, n.7.)

1

foolhardy for a class claimant not to “lawyer up” in the pre-litigation period even before the

2

decision to litigate was made. Defendant’s arguments are utterly inconsistent with the

3

recognition by the City of San Jose Court that imposing a requirement of detailed information on

4

administrative class claims would “severely restrict the maintenance of appropriate class actions

5

– contrary to recognized policy favoring them.” Id. at 457 (emphasis added). Defendant’s

6

argument also contravenes the policy enunciated by courts – that the claims presentation statute

7

“should be given a liberal construction to permit full adjudication on the merits.” Minsky v. City

8

of Los Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 113, 123 (1974); see also Stockett, 34 Cal. 4th at 449; Smith v. County

9

of Los Angeles, 214 Cal. App. 3d 266, 280 (1989); Elias, 68 Cal. App. 3d at 74; Blair v. Super.

10

Ct., 218 Cal. App. 3d 221, 224-25 (1990).

11

In support of this argument that the administrative claim must establish “a well-

12

defined community of interest,” defendant relies on a single dated case – Eaton v. Ventura Port

13

Dist., 45 Cal. App. 3d 862 (1975). (Motion at 5-6). This case does not bear that freight. First, it

14

should be noted that in Eaton, the actual administrative claim was not included in the judicial

15

record, and on that basis alone the court held that plaintiffs were not in substantial compliance

16

with the Tort Claims Act. Id. at 868. Second, the allegations of that case, which involve

17

compensatory damage claims for a diffuse and diverse class, stand in stark contrast to the present

18

case, where the claim specifically alleges a pattern and practice of discriminatory conduct.

19

In any event, the allegations of the tort claims easily establish a community of

20

interest for the purposes of claim notice. Each claim identifies a pattern of conduct that affects

21

similarly situated African-American Section 8 families (“like mine”).

22
23
24

C.

Defendant Had Ample Notice and Opportunity to Investigate
Claims on a Class-Wide Basis.
The purposes of the claims presentation requirement are: 1) to provide sufficient

25

information to the government entity so that it can do an early investigation of the facts, 2) to

26

thereby provide an opportunity to settle claims before litigation, and/or 3) to provide the

27

government an opportunity to correct the condition or practices which give rise to the claim to

28

avoid future liability. San Jose, 12 Cal. 3d at 455; Lozada, 145 Cal. App. 4th at 1152. The

1

plaintiffs’ tort claims make it manifest that they have been injured by actions that are the official

2

policies and practices of the Antioch police, and that other African-American Section 8 families

3

(“like mine”) have been subjected to these illegal “discriminatory” policies and practices.

4

In the analogous context of pre-litigation administrative complaints of

5

discrimination under Title VII or the California FEHA, both state and federal courts have

6

recognized that such remedial statutes utilize “procedures designed for the unschooled, not for

7

the ‘sophisticated [and]’ the cognoscenti (citation omitted),” and thus, in determining the

8

sufficiency of the claim, the court looks to both the language of the claim and the “scope of the

9

. . . investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.”

10

Sandhu v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 26 Cal. App. 4th 846, 858-59 (1994) (quoting

11

Sanchez v. Standard Brand, 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970)); accord Oubichon v. North Am.

12

Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir. 1973). In Paige v. State of Cal., 102 F.3d 1035 (9th

13

Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit directly addressed whether an administrative claim “not explicitly

14

raising class claims could support a class action.” Id. at 1041. The Court held that the

15

administrative charges of discriminatory hiring practices by the California Highway Patrol,

16

raised by a single officer who was denied promotion and with no mention of a class, was

17

sufficient to support a subsequently filed class action complaint:

18

[A] claim of racial discrimination in the examination process that
determines eligibility for promotion would necessarily result in an
investigation of the CHP’s promotion practices, interview system,
and any pattern of racial discrimination that results from the
administration of the agency’s procedures.

19
20
21
22

Id. at 1042.
This reasoning fully applies to the claims, which did in fact explicitly inform

23

defendant that the claimants were challenging official policies and practices of the City and the

24

Antioch Police Department, and that others aside from the individual claimants were affected.

25

For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs respectfully request that defendant’s Motion
