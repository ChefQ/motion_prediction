Defendant City of Antioch moves this Court for a Judgment on the Pleadings to dismiss
the Eighth Claim for Relief in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint with regard to Plaintiff
Priscilla Bunton and the class. This motion is brought per FRCP 12(c) and (h)(2)(B) on the
grounds that it is apparent on the face of the pleading that Plaintiff Bunton and the class failed to
meet essential state tort claim requirements to seek statutory damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52.

I. ISSUES TO BE DECIDED
The issues to be decided in this motion and the short answers are as follows:
ISSUE No.1 Is Plaintiff Priscilla Bunton barred from seeking damages under Cal. Civil

Code 0x00A7 52 in this lawsuit per Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 945.4 for failure to file a government tort claim?

ANSWER Yes. Plaintiff Bunton did not file a government tort claim, thus, did not
meet the state tort claim requirements and is therefore barred from seeking statutory and/or actual
(and treble) damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52.

ISSUE No.2 Is the class barred from seeking damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52 in this
lawsuit per Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 945.4 for failure to file a government tort claim?

ANSWER Yes. The claims filed by Plaintiffs Williams, Payne, Scott and Coleman
were filed individually and not on behalf of "similarly situated" class members, thus barring the
class from seeking statutory damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiffs, five African-American Section 8 program participants, have brought this class
action against Defendant City of Antioch for alleged race discrimination in violation of several
constitutional and statutory federal and state rights'.

On July 3, 2007, Defendant City of Antioch received a government tort claim from
Plaintiff Scott; on September 14, 2007 from Plaintiff Payne; on September 26, 2007 from
Plaintiff Williams; and on December 12, 2007, from Plaintiff Coleman. (Exhibits B1-B4)'.
Plaintiff Bunton admittedly never submitted a government tort claim."

All four Plaintiffs were represented by Bay Area Legal Aid. All four claims were
submitted individually. (See Exhibit B1-B4: "7 am submitting this claim ... / suffered personal
injury, emotional distress ... / also suffered medical complications ... entitling my family and me
to punitive damages ... if litigated my claim would ...") (emphasis added.) None of the four
claims was submitted on behalf of "similarly situated class members" and/or indicated in any
other way that the claims were brought on behalf of a class. The claims were rejected.

Plaintiffs then filed their complaint on May 2, 2008, and the First Amended Complaint

 

' Plaintiffs' motion for class certification is pending concurrently herewith and set for the same hearing date. The
moving papers and Defendant's opposition discuss the factual allegations in great detail. To avoid undue repetition,
Defendant's respectfully refer to and incorporate herewith those factual allegations.

? All Exhibits are attached to the declaration of James V. Fitzgerald, III, filed concurrently herewith.

("FAC") on July 16, 2008. (Exhibit A). Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, as well
as statutory damages for the class and actual damages (trebled) for the individual Plaintiffs under
Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52. (Plaintiffs' Eighth Claim for Relief, Exhibit A). Plaintiffs seek damages
only under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52. (Exhibit A, 4 148.) The FAC further states that government tort
claims were filed by Plaintiffs Williams, Scott, Coleman and Payne. (Exhibit A, | 99.)
Defendants now seek to dismiss Plaintiffs' Eighth Claim with respect to Plaintiff Bunton
and the class pursuant to FRCP 12(c) and (h)(2)(B) because it is apparent on the face of the

pleading that they failed to meet vital government tort claim requirements.

ll. LEGAL ANALYSIS
A. Legal Standards

1. FRCP 12(c) and (h)(2)(B)
Under FRCP 12(c) and (h)(2)(B), a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be

made in a motion for judgment on the pleadings after an answer has been filed. Martorello v. Sun
Life Assurance Company of Canada, 2009 WL 1227011, *3 (N.D. Cal. May 1, 2009); (see also
Aldabe vy. Aldabe, 616 F.2d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.1980) (holding that Rule 12(h)(2) allows a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, raising the defense of failure to state a claim, even after an
answer has been filed. The case for adopting such a position is further strengthened where the
answer included the defense of failure to state a claim.).

When Rule 12(c) is used to raise a defense for failure to state a claim, "the motion for
judgment on the pleadings faces the same test as a motion under Rule 12(b)(6)." Martorello,
2009 WL 1227011, *3 (citing McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 810 (9th
Cir.1988), holding that dismissal is proper "only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under
any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the allegations."); see also Morgan v. County
of Yolo, 436 F.Supp.2d 1152, 1154-1155 (E.D. Cal. 2006), holding that judgment on the
pleadings is appropriate if, assuming the truth of all materials facts pled in the complaint, the
moving party is nonetheless entitled to judgment as a matter of law.)

Defendant has answered Plaintiffs' FAC and has raised the defense of failure to state a

claim in its answer. (See Defendant's 1. Affirmative Defense.) Further, as will be shown below,

Plaintiff Bunton and the class failed to meet prerequisite state tort claim requirements, thus
entitling the Defendant to a judgment as a matter of law. Defendant is therefore entitled to bring
this motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under FRCP 12(c) and (h)(2)(B).

2. The Court May Consider Judicially Noticed Matters

Judicially noticed documents may be considered along with the complaint in deciding a
Rule 12 motion. Morgan, 436 F.Supp.2d at 1155 ("In addition to considering the allegations of
the complaint, like a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) the court may also take into account materials to
which it can take judicial notice. A Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings may
consequently be granted if, after assessing both the complaint, plus matters for which judicial
notice is proper, it appears "beyond doubt that the [non-moving party] cannot prove any facts that
would support his claim for relief ...") (internal cites omitted); see also Barron v. Reich, 13 F.3d
1370, 1377 (9" Cir. 1994) (holding that "additional facts [may be] considered by the court [that]
are contained in materials of which the court may take judicial notice.")

Defendant requests the Court to take judicial notice of the government tort claims filed by
Plaintiffs Williams, Scott, Coleman and Payne (Exhibit B1-B4).* The authenticity of the claims
is undisputed (since they were filed by the Plaintiffs in this action) and the claims are public
records, which can be judicially noticed per FRE 201. As such, the government tort claims can
be properly considered in deciding this Rule 12 motion.

3. Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 945.4

"No suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity ... until a written
claim therefore has been presented to the public entity." Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 945.4, In other
words, actions for damages against public entities are preconditioned on the timely filing of a
proper claim. As the California Supreme Court has explained, "[t]imely claim presentation is not
merely a procedural requirement, but is, as we long ago concluded, `a condition precedent to
plaintiffs maintaining an action against defendant'." Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist., 42

Cal.4" 201, 209 (2007); citing State of California v. Superior Court (Bodde), 32 Cal.4th 1234,

1240 (2004), (quoting Williams v. Horvath, 16 Cal.3d 834, 842 (1976)) (emphasis added). Sec
also City of San Jose v. Superior Court, 12 Cal.3d 447, 452 (1974).

Further, it is well settled that claims statutes must be satisfied even in face of the public
entity's actual knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim. Such knowledge ~standing
alone- constitutes neither substantial compliance nor basis for estoppels. City of San Jose, 12
Cal.3d at 455. The purpose of this claim-filing statute is to give the public entity the opportunity
to investigate and negotiate settlement of claims, and thus avoid litigation. The filing of a claim 1s
not simply an exercise in paper work or a perfunctory condition precedent to instituting litigation.
There must be compliance with the requirements of the statute which will permit the government
to make a meaningful decision in allowing or disallowing the claim. Eaton v. Ventura Port
District, 45 Cal. App.3d 862, 867 (1975)

In the context of class actions, an administrative claim may be filed on behalf of a class if
the information presented in the tort claim is in "substantial compliance" with the statutory
requirements of Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 910. City of San Jose, 12 Cal.3d at 452. While it is not
necessary to file a claim individually for each purported class member, the class claim must
nonetheless provide "sufficient information to identify and make ascertainable the class itself" in
order to satisfy the claims statute. /d. at 457.0x00B0 The circumstances of the occurrence and a
description of the liability set forth in the class claim must "establish a well-defined community
of interest in questions of law and fact" so as "to portray [a] community of interest." Eaton., 45
Cal.App.3d at 869. Class claims containing "diverse and individualized" theories of liability or
factual scenarios underlying those theories do not meet this test. /d. The Court of Appeals in
Eaton declined class certification because the class claim did not substantially comply with the
claim statute; and the action was not maintainable as a class action because of the number, variety

and diversity of the individual plaintiffs' respective claims. ("The only common feature appearing

 

> Ata minimum, class claims should be submitted on the claimant's own behalf as well as "all others similarly
situated" class members. See, for instance, Dhuyvetter v. City of Fresno, 110 Cal.App.3d 659 (1980) (claim filed on
behalf of named property owners ... and "on behalf of all persons similarly adversely affected."); Craft v. County of
San Bernardino, 2006 WL 4941829 *4 (C.D.Cal. March 23, 2006) (claim filed on claimant's own behalf as well as
"all others similarly situated.")

unnamed, possess in common only a diversity of interest in fact and law. No discernable class can

be manufactured from this mixed bag of litigants." Jd.)

B. `The Eighth Claim under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A752 Should Be Dismissed
With Regard to Plaintiff Bunton and the Class Because They Did Not
File The Prerequisite State Tort Claim

1. Plaintiff Bunton's Damage Claim under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A752 Is
Barred as a Matter of Law Because She Did Not File a Tort Claim

Plaintiff Bunton admittedly failed to file a state tort claim against Defendants.0x00B0 That
failure is apparent on the face of the pleading. Her failure to comply with this mandatory
procedural requirement is fatal, in that she cannot maintain her claim for damages under Cal.
Civil Code 0x00A752 against Defendants. Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 945.4.

Further, per the California Supreme Court's ruling in San Jose, the fact that the other four
named Plaintiffs filed state tort claims cannot cure Plaintiff Bunton's failure. They did not file
their claims on behalf of Priscilla Bunton and the City's knowledge of the other claims -standing
alone- constitutes neither substantial compliance nor basis for estoppel with regard to the distinct
and separate state tort claim requirement for individual Plaintiff Bunton. City of San Jose, 12
Cal.3d at 455. See also Eaton, 45 Cal.App.3d at 867 (emphasizing that the filing of a claim is not
simply an exercise in paper work or a perfunctory condition precedent to instituting litigation
because the purpose of the claim-filing statute is to give the public entity the opportunity to
investigate and negotiate settlement of claims, and thus avoid litigation.)

In sum, it is apparent on the face of the pleading that Plaintiff Bunton admittedly failed to
meet a condition precedent to her maintaining an action against Defendant for damages under
Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52. Consequently, it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of
facts that could be proven consistent with Plaintiffs allegations because assuming the truth of all
materials facts pled in the complaint, the Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on

Plaintiff Bunton's Eighth Claim for Relief under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52, which must be dismissed.

2. The Class' Damage Claim under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A752 Is Barred as a
Matter of Law Because Plaintiffs Williams, Payne, Scott and
Coleman Filed Their State Tort Claims Only as Individuals And
Not On Behalf of "Similarly Situated"" Class Members

Based on the California Supreme Court's ruling in San Jose, an administrative claim may
only be filed on behalf of a class if the information presented in the tort claim is in "substantial
compliance" with the statutory requirements of Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 910, meaning that the class
claim must provide "sufficient information to identify and make ascertainable the class itself."
San Jose, 12 Cal.3d at 452, 457. The class claim must further establish a well-defined
community of interest and may not contain diverse and individualized factual scenarios. Eaton.,
45 Cal.App.3d at 869.

Plaintiffs' claims do not meet these requirements. First and foremost, no claim was ever
submitted on behalf of the class. It is apparent on the face of the pleading that Plaintiffs
Williams, Scott, Coleman and Payne only filed individual claims on their own behalf. (See
Exhibit A, 9 99, Exhibit B1-B4) The claims were not filed `on behalf of similarly situated
individuals," and do not, in any other way, indicate that a class claim was submitted. The claims
do not contain sufficient information, let alone a class definition, to identify and make
ascertainable a class to give the Defendant the opportunity to investigate and negotiate settlement
of claims on behalf of an entire class to perhaps avoid litigation. Again, the mere fact that four
individuals filed separate claims at separate times does not put the Defendant on notice of a class
claim. City of San Jose, 12 Cal.3d at 455 (the City's knowledge of the other claims constitutes
neither substantial compliance nor basis for estoppel.)

Further, Plaintiffs claims fail to establish a well-defined community of interest in
questions of law and fact. Rather, the claims contain diverse and individualized factual scenarios'
and, thus, do not meet the substantial compliance requirement of a class claim.

In sum, it is apparent on the face of the pleading that the named Plaintiffs failed to meet a

condition precedent on behalf of the putative class members to maintain a class action against

 

' The issue of individualized adjudication of Plaintiffs' claims is discussed in detail in Defendant's opposition brief to

relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with Plaintiffs
allegations because assuming the truth of all materials facts pled in the complaint, the Defendant
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the class' Eighth Claim for Relief under Cal. Civil

IV. CONCLUSION

In sum, it is apparent on the face of the pleading that Plaintiff Priscilla Bunton is barred
from seeking damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52 in this lawsuit per Cal. Gov't Code 0x00A7 945.4 for
failure to file a government tort claim. Likewise, it is also apparent on the face of the pleading
and the judicially noticed claims filed by Plaintiffs Williams, Scott, Coleman and Payne, that the
class is barred from seeking damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52 in this lawsuit per Cal. Gov't
Code 0x00A7 945.4 for failure to file a government tort claim. As such, Defendant respectfully asks
this Court to dismiss the Eighth Claim for Relief for damages under Cal. Civil Code 0x00A7 52 with

regard to Plaintiff Bunton and the class, per FRCP 12(c) and (h)(2)(B).
