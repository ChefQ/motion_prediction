BlueWave Healthcare Consultants, Inc. (“BlueWave”), and its sole co-owners and
officers, Robert Bradford Johnson (“Johnson”) and Floyd Calhoun Dent III (“Dent”)
(collectively, the “BlueWave Defendants”), have obtained over $240 million dollars that they
were not entitled to, in violation of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, et seq. They
contracted for commission-based payments from two client laboratories, Health Diagnostics
Laboratory (“HDL”) and Singulex, Inc. (“Singulex”), in exchange for promoting laboratory tests
that were reimbursed by Federal health care programs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute
(“AKS”), 42 U.C.S. § 1320a-7b(b)(1)(A). In addition, the BlueWave Defendants arranged for
illegal kickbacks in the form of process and handling fees to be paid to physicians who ordered
the laboratory tests and the routine waiver of the co-pays and deductibles owed by TRICARE
patients as well as caused the submission of false claims for medically unnecessary tests.
This is an application for relief under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act
(“FDCPA”), 28 U.S.C. § 3001, et seq. The United States is entitled to prejudgment remedies
under Subchapters B and D of the FDCPA. As detailed more fully below, the United States is
seeking limited prejudgment remedies against the BlueWave Defendants, namely liens (or writs
of attachment) on certain real estate, boats, and an airplane to preserve the Government’s interest
in those properties as well as a writ of garnishment for funds in three bank accounts. BlueWave
has no assets other than a bank account with less than $2 million, and therefore prejudgment
relief is essential.
INTRODUCTION AND LEGAL BACKGROUND
A.

The Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act
The FDCPA provides the exclusive civil procedures for the United States “to recover a

judgment on a debt[,]” 28 U.S.C. § 3001(a)(1), and to seek prejudgment remedies.

28 U.S.C. § 3001(a)(2). The FDCPA authorizes district courts to secure a debtor’s property
through several different means, see 28 U.S.C. § 3101, including attachment, 28 U.S.C. § 3102,
and garnishment, 28 U.S.C. § 3104, of real and personal property. The purpose of these
prejudgment remedies is to establish “security to satisfy such judgment, and interest and costs, as
the United States may recover on such claim” for a debt. 28 U.S.C. §§ 3102(b), 3105(a).
The United States is entitled to prejudgment remedies where it establishes: (1) the
probable validity of the claim for a debt; (2) the amount of the debt claimed; (3) that the debtor
has or is about to assign, dispose, remove, conceal, ill-treat, waste, or destroy property with the
effect of hindering, delaying, or defrauding the United States; and (4) that the requirements for
the prejudgment remedies sought have been satisfied. 28 U.S.C. § 3101. Because of the
quickness with which the debtor may dispose of property, the Court may issue the prejudgment
relief requested, without waiting for a response from the debtor, so long as the United States has
made its required showing. NLRB v. E.D.P. Med. Comp. Sys., Inc., 6 F.3d 951, 955-56 (2d Cir.
1993). The writs must be accompanied by a notice of prejudgment remedies signed by the Clerk
of Court. 28 U.S.C. § 3101(d). (Proposed Clerk’s notices are attached to this Application, and
Word versions will also be emailed to Chambers.) The notices inform the debtors that they are
entitled to a hearing within five days after the Clerk of Court receives the request, if the debtor
wishes that the hearing take place that quickly. Id.
The United States has brought this action under the False Claims Act (“FCA”),
31 U.S.C. § 3729, et seq. and common law. Amounts claimed as owing to the United States
under the FCA and common law are considered a “debt” that is subject to the FDCPA. The
FDCPA defines a “debt” to the United States as, among other things, an amount owing to the
United States on the account of a “fine, assessment, penalty, restitution, damages,” or “any other
-2-

source of indebtedness.” 28 U.S.C. § 3002(3)(B). Courts have previously held that claims under
the FCA, and associated common law claims, constitute a “debt” for purposes of the FDCPA,
and have granted prejudgment remedies in such cases. U.S. ex rel. Doe v. DeGregorio, 510 F.
Supp. 2d 877, 884 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (“Treble damages under the False Claims Act . . . constitutes
‘debt’” under the FDCPA); see also United States v. First Choice Armor & Equip., 808 F. Supp.
2d 68, 79 (D.D.C. 2011) (“[B]y alleging that the defendants submitted false claims and made
false statements under the FCA, the government sufficiently alleges the existence of a debt under
the FDCPA.”).
B.

The Debt Owed to the United States Pursuant to the False Claims Act
The United States’ Complaint asserts three counts under the FCA, all three of which

include AKS violations, as well as two common law counts. The AKS prohibits any individual
or entity from soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration to induce or reward any
person for referring, recommending or arranging for the purchase of any item or service for
which payment may be made under a Federal health care program. 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b). In
March 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“PPACA”), Pub.
L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (Mar. 23, 2010), the AKS was amended to provide expressly that
“a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of [the AKS] constitutes a false
or fraudulent claim for purposes of [the FCA].” 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(g) (as amended by § 6402
of PPACA). According to the legislative history of the PPACA, this amendment to the AKS was
intended to clarify “that all claims resulting from illegal kickbacks are considered false claims
for purposes of civil action under the False Claims Act . . . .” 155 Cong. Rec. S10854 (daily ed.
Dec. 21, 2010).
As to damages, the FCA, 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A) (2010), provides that a person is
-3-

liable to the United States Government for three times the amount of damages which the
Government sustains because of the act of that person plus a civil penalty for each instance in
which the person “knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for
payment or approval.” The Government’s damages are equal to the full amount that Medicare
paid on the false claims that were tainted by the kickback arrangement, because those claims
were not eligible for payment. In other words, compliance with the AKS is a precondition to
payment by Medicare and, as such, Medicare should not have paid anything on the claims
submitted by the BlueWave Defendants’ client laboratories that resulted from the kickback
arrangement. See United States v. Rogan, 517 F.3d 449 (7th Cir. 2008); see also U.S. ex rel.
Drakeford v. Tuomey, 976 F. Supp. 2d 776 , 778 (D.S.C. 2013) (affirming jury’s finding that
entire amount of Medicare reimbursement was government’s loss for violations of Stark Statute
and rejecting application of U.S. ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 352 F.3d
908, 923 (4th Cir. 2003)); U.S. ex rel. Freedman v. Soarez-Hoyos, 2012 WL 4344199, at *5
(M.D. Fla. 2012) (holding that “the amount of the Government’s damages resulting from the
payment of such claims [tainted by AKS violations] equals the full amount that Medicare
paid”). 1

1

The government acknowledges that there are FCA cases measuring damages differently. See,
e.g., Ab-Tech Constr., Inc. v. United States, 31 Fed. Cl. 429, 434 (Ct. Fed. Cl. 1994) (stating that
government’s damages for false claims relating to construction of automated data processing
facility were zero, because government received exactly what it paid for, despite false statements
that were made); Harrison, 352 F.3d at 923 (concluding that government did not incur any
damages from FCA violation based on contractor’s false statements regarding its conflict of
interest, because the value of work performed equaled the amount that the government paid).
Importantly, those cases arise outside of the Medicare context and they do not involve violations
of the AKS. Moreover, unlike Harrison, the government here did incur damages as a result of
the BlueWave Defendants’ conduct where the conduct induced claims for medically unnecessary
tests. While the government strongly opposes application of any alternate view of damages here,
it is of no consequence for purposes of the instant FDCPA action. Even assuming arguendo the
most conservative damages estimate for purposes of this action – that is, the amount of the
-4-

C.

The Anti-Kickback Statute
As set forth in the Complaint and as detailed infra, the United States alleges, inter alia,

that the BlueWave Defendants entered into Sales Agreements which, by virtue of their
compensation scheme, fall directly within the class of relationships prohibited by the AKS, 42
U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(1). This FDCPA Application focuses on the Sales Agreements because
those Agreements and the ensuing performance under those Agreements was blatantly unlawful
as explained herein, forming the predicate for the instant action.
The AKS makes it unlawful to knowingly and willfully “solicit or receive” any
remuneration “in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending
purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good . . . or item for which payment may be made in whole
or in part under a federal health care program.” 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(1)(B). The other side
of the same kickback – providing the remuneration – is likewise prohibited. See 42 U.S.C. §
1320a-7b(b)(2)(B) (making it unlawful to knowingly and willfully “offer or pay” any
remuneration “to any person to induce such person . . . to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or
recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good . . . or item for which payment may be
made in whole or in part under a federal health care program”).
The United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of
Inspector General (“OIG”) is tasked with protecting the integrity of Medicare, Medicaid, and
other HHS programs, and has offered interpretive guidance concerning marketing activities in
the context of the AKS. The OIG has explained that the AKS “is extremely broad. The types of
remuneration covered specifically include kickbacks, bribes, and rebates . . . . In addition,

kickback itself – damages to the United States are still nearly $60 million per individual and
$240 million for BlueWave (and that is before the trebling permitted under the FCA). Thus, the
instant action is warranted.
-5-

prohibited conduct includes not only remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients, but
remuneration also intended to induce the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any
good, facility, service, or item paid for by Medicare or State health care programs.” General
Comments, OIG, Notice of Final Rule, AKS Provisions of Medicare and State Health Care
Programs, 56 Fed. Reg. 35,952 (July 29, 1991).
Under the terms of the Sales Agreements at issue herein, the BlueWave Defendants
contracted to receive remuneration from client laboratories, HDL and Singulex, in return for
“arranging for” or “recommending” the ordering of HDL and Singulex laboratory tests. (HDL
and Singulex tests are products that are paid for in full or in part by Federal health care programs
within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(1)(B) to the extent such tests are performed on
Federal health care beneficiaries.) Pursuant to the HDL Sales Agreement, HDL appointed
BlueWave “as its independent contractor to perform certain sales services for” HDL, “including
the sale of various laboratory tests and services of [HDL] to physicians and medical groups.”
See Ex. 1 at ¶ 1. 2 More specifically, BlueWave agreed to “use its best efforts to maximize”
specific sales goals. Id. at ¶ 2. HDL paid BlueWave a monthly base fee, plus a “commission
equal to . . . [varying percentage] of the revenue collected by HDL from sales” in BlueWave’s
territory, thus varying with the volume and value of the referrals. Id. at ¶ 4. The HDL Sales
Agreement specifically stated that “[BlueWave] shall act as and be deemed to be an independent
contractor for all purposes of this Agreement.” Id. at ¶ 10. Between January 2010 and January
2015, BlueWave and HDL performed under the HDL Sales Agreement, and, by January 2015,

The BlueWave Defendants filed an Answer, ECF No. 92, which the United States recently
consented for them to amend, Consent Motion to Amend, ECF No. 138, based upon the United
States’ Motion to Strike Defendants’ Affirmative Defenses, ECF No. 108. The BlueWave
Defendants have admitted many of the allegations described above. See Answer ¶¶ 21, 25, 96,
98-99, 101-04, 106-08, 115, 122, 135-38.

BlueWave served as a large, independent sales and marketing force for HDL. Ex. 2 at ¶ 12
(BlueWave v. HDL, No. 5:15-cv-00884-MHH, Complaint (N.D. Ala. June 3, 2015) (“BlueWave
v. HDL II”) (BlueWave’s Amended Complaint in a lawsuit it filed against HDL); Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 2,
15, 17 (HDL v. BlueWave, No. 3:15-cv-030-REP, Complaint (E.D. Va. Jan. 13, 2015) (“HDL v.
BlueWave”).

The BlueWave Defendants executed and performed under a similar sales

agreement with Singulex.

Ex. 4.

The Agreements plainly fall within the purview of the

prohibition against such remuneration outlined in the AKS at 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(1)(B).
The BlueWave Defendants cannot avail themselves of the two potential safety valves
from the AKS’ blanket prohibition on transactions like those found in the Sales Agreements: (1)
the employee exception under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(3)(B), as interpreted by regulation at 42
C.F.R. § 1001.952(i) (the “Employee Safe Harbor”); and (2) the personal services safe harbor
found in 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d) (the “Personal Services Safe Harbor”). As described below,
neither applies to the Sales Agreements. Moreover, these carve outs and their regulatory history
provide further confirmation that the Sales Agreements not only fall outside the class of
relationships, but reflect the type of arrangement specifically identified as potentially abusive.
1. The Employee Safe Harbor
Given the breadth of the AKS, the Secretary of HHS was directed, in Pub. L. 100-93,
§ 14, 101 Stat. 688, 697 (1987), “to promulgate regulations specifying payment practices that
shall not be treated as a criminal offense.”

The Secretary did so, promulgating what are

commonly known as the Medicare “safe harbor” regulations, which are “entitled to the same
judicial enforcement accorded Congressional legislation.” West Allis Mem’l Hosp., Inc. v.
Bowen, 852 F.2d 251, 255-56 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1988). The applicable safe harbor regulations in
effect at the time the Sales Agreements were executed (and which are currently in effect) do not
-7-

afford any protection for these Agreements.
Subsection (b)(3)(B) of the AKS provides that the illegal remuneration provisions “shall
not apply to . . . any amount paid by an employer to an employee (who has a bona fide
employment relationship with such employer) for employment in the provision of covered items
or services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(3)(B). An “employee” is “any individual who, under the
usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the
status of an employee.” 26 U.S.C. § 3121(d)(2); see 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i) (“employee . . . has
the same meaning” as the Internal Revenue Code’s definition of “employee”).
The Sales Agreements explicitly state that the nature of the relationship between the
BlueWave Defendants and the client laboratories, HDL and Singulex, is not that of
employer-employee but rather of an independent contractor. Ex. 1 at ¶ 10 (“[BlueWave] shall
act as and be deemed to be an independent contractor for all purposes of this Agreement.”). As
such, the Employee Safe Harbor does not apply.
2. The Personal Services Safe Harbor
A second, potentially-applicable safe harbor is equally unavailing. Section 1001.952(d)
of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations sets forth a six-factor test to determine if
contracts, such as the Sales Agreements, fall outside the class of those prohibited by § 1320a7b(b)(1). Section 1001.952(d) provides, among other things, that:
As used in [42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(1)], “remuneration” does not include
any payment made by a principal to an agent as compensation for the
services of the agent, as long as the following six standards are met:
(5) The aggregate compensation paid to the agent over the term of the
agreement is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value in armslength transactions and is not determined in a manner that takes into
account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise
generated between the parties for which payment may be made in whole
or in part under Medicare ….
-8-

42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d) (emphasis added).
The Sales Agreements plainly fail this test in that the BlueWave Defendants’
compensation from BlueWave’s client laboratories was directly tied to the number of sales
generated on behalf of HDL and Singulex. That is, (1) there was no aggregate compensation
provided for under the Sales Agreements, (2) the compensation was not set in advance, and (3)
the compensation paid to the BlueWave Defendants was tied to the volume and value of referrals
to client laboratories. Therefore, the Personal Services Safe Harbor does not apply.
3. The HHS OIG Rule-Making Process
HHS OIG specifically considered the inclusion of marketing agreements with
independent contractors when promulgating the safe harbors, and specifically rejected safe
harbor protections for such agreements. In formulating the safe harbors, HHS OIG issued its
proposed rule on January 23, 1989, following its notice of intent to develop regulations issued
nearly two years earlier.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Fraud and Abuse OIG Anti-

Kickback Provisions, 54 Fed. Reg. 3088 (Jan. 23, 1989) (to be codified at 42 C.F.R. pt. 1001).
In its proposed rule describing the Employee Safe Harbor, the OIG stated:
This statutory exemption permits an employer to pay an employee
in whatever manner he or she chooses for having that employee
assist in the solicitation of Medicare or State health care program
business. The proposed exemption follows the statute in that it
applies only to bona fide employee-employer relationships. We
have decided to adopt the definition of employee from the Internal
Revenue Service set forth in 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2).
In response to the October 21, 1987 request for comments, many
commenters suggested that we broaden the exemption to apply to
independent contractors paid on a commission basis. We have
declined to adopt this approach because we are aware of many
examples of abusive practices by sales personnel who are paid as
independent contractors and who are not under appropriate
supervision. We believe that if individuals and entities desire to
pay a salesperson on the basis of the amount of business they
-9-

generate, then to be exempt from civil or criminal prosecution,
they should make these salespersons employees where they can
and should exert appropriate supervision for the individual’s acts.
Id. (emphasis added).

HHS OIG states that it is specifically not carving out independent

contractors because those kinds of relationships are more likely to engender abusive practices, in
part because such individuals are not supervised in the same manner as employees.
Approximately two years later, in 1991, HHS OIG issued the final rule on the AKS safe
harbors. Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; OIG AKS Provisions, 56
Fed. Reg. 35952 (July 29, 1991) (codified at 42 C.F.R. pt. 1001). Therein, HHS OIG expressed
its concern about arrangements such as the Sales Agreements in the context of discussing both
the Personal Services and the Employee Safe Harbors.

First, in considering the Personal

Services Safe Harbor, HHS OIG stated:
Comment: Four commenters sought specific protection for
commission sales arrangements between health care providers and
independent contractors.
Response: We see no reason, nor has any commenter claimed to
have provided one, for treating commission sales agreements
differently under these regulations from other types of contracts for
personal services performed by independent contractors.
Therefore, commission sales agreements must meet the conditions
of the safe harbor provisions governing personal services and
management contracts.
Id. Within the same rulemaking, HHS OIG went on to explain that such Agreements may be
abusive and are not protected under the Employee Safe Harbor.
Comment: Many commenters urged the OIG to extend this
exception to apply to independent contractors paid on a
commission basis. Two commenters asserted that the legislative
history of the statute makes clear that Congress intended to include
independent contractors in the employee exception. In support of
this contention, they quoted remarks made by Representative
Rostenkowski when the House was considering the MedicareMedicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977. (123
Cong. Rec. 30,280 (1977)).
- 10 -

Response: We continue to reject this approach because of the
existence of widespread abusive practices by salespersons who are
independent contractors and, therefore, who are not under
appropriate supervision and control. Although two commenters
asserted that they could achieve appropriate supervision and
control of independent contractors by including restrictive terms in
the contract, we cannot expand this provision to cover such
relationships unless we can predict with reasonable certainty that
they will not be abusive. We are confident that the employeremployee relationship is unlikely to be abusive, in part because the
employer is generally fully liable for the actions of its employees
and is therefore more motivated to supervise and control them.
Furthermore, we believe that Representative Rostenkowski’s
remarks do not reflect congressional intent in this case. His
comments related to the House version of the employee exception
that was rejected by the Conference Committee. Instead, Congress
passed the Senate version, which expressly limited the exception to
bona fide employment relationships (See H.Conf.Rep. No. 673,
95th Cong., 1st Sess. 41 (1977)). Consequently, we find no support
for the position that Congress intended to cover independent
contractors under this exception.
Id. (emphasis added). Accordingly, HHS OIG – consistent with the language of the statute – was
expressly concerned about sales agreements such as those entered into here and made a
deliberate choice to exclude them from the protection of the AKS safe harbors. The Sales
Agreements are illegal and are not saved by the safe harbor regulations.
4. OIG Advisory Opinions
HHS OIG has consistently reiterated its position since the adoption of the final safe
harbors in 1991. HHS OIG has rejected protection for commission-based sales agreements with
independent contractors in its advisory opinions.

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7d(b), the

Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General, is authorized to issue advisory
opinions on specific topics, including what constitutes prohibited remuneration under § 1320a7b(b), and whether any activity or proposed activity could result in imposition of sanctions or
- 11 -

exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs. See 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7d(b)(2).
First, in HHS OIG Advisory Opinion No. 99-3, posted March 23, 1999, the OIG stated
that:
[T]he Sales agents are in the business of recommending or
arranging for the purchase of the items or services they offer for
sale on behalf of their principals, typically manufacturers, or other
sellers (collectively, “Sellers”). Accordingly, any compensation
arrangement between a Seller and an independent sales agent for
the purpose of selling health care items or services that are directly
or indirectly reimbursable by a Federal health care program
potentially implicates the anti-kickback statute, irrespective of the
methodology used to compensate the agent. Moreover, because
such agents are independent contractors, they are less accountable
to the Seller than an employee. See 56 Fed. Reg. 35952, 35981
(July 29, 1991); 54 Fed. Reg. 3088, 3093 (Jan. 23, 1989). For these
reasons, this Office has a longstanding concern with independent
sales agency arrangements.
Id. (emphasis added).

In Advisory Opinion 99-3, OIG goes on to identify “several

characteristics of arrangements . . . that appear to be associated with an increased potential for
program abuse.” Specifically cited by HHS OIG were “compensation based on percentage of
sales,” “direct contact between the sales agent and physicians in a position to order items or
services that are then paid for by a Federal health care program,” and the “marketing of items or
services that are separately reimbursable by a Federal health care program . . . .” Id.

These

characteristics each apply to the Sales Agreements: the BlueWave sales representatives are paid
on a commission basis, there is direct contact with physicians by the BlueWave contractors, and
the laboratory tests are reimbursed separately by Federal health care programs. OIG’s concern
regarding “potential for program abuse” is borne out by these Sales Agreements, where
independent contractors solicited and received kickbacks from client labs in exchange for
arranging for referrals, and peddled a massive kickback scheme to physicians (in the form of
payment of process and handling fees) resulting in the submission of claims to Federal health
- 12 -

care programs for medically unnecessary laboratory tests. See Compl. ¶¶ 153-71., ECF No. 75
In 2010, the OIG issued a similar opinion, again rejecting such an arrangement. The OIG
stated:
Marketing fees paid on the basis of successful orders for items or
services are inherently subject to abuse because they are linked to
business generated by the marketer. Because the Requestor
receives a fee each time its marketing efforts are successful, the
Requestor’s financial incentive to arrange for or recommend the
Hospital’s sleep testing facility is heightened. The more test orders
the Requestor’s marketing efforts generate, the more fees the
Requestor receives.
HHS OIG Advisory Op. No. 10-23 (posted Nov. 4, 2010).
Here, the more test orders that the BlueWave Defendants generated, the more fees the
BlueWave Defendants received. See also HHS OIG Advisory Op. No. 98-1 (posted Mar. 25,
1998) (rejecting marketing arrangement with commission-based payments, noting significant
financial incentives increasing risk of abusive marketing and billing practices, opportunity to
unduly influence referral source, and no safeguards against fraud or abuse); cf. HHS OIG
Advisory Op. No. 98-10 (posted Sept. 8, 1998) (extending protection to the marketing
arrangement because, inter alia, sales agents had no direct contact with physicians and
manufacturer was not separately reimbursed by Federal health care programs). In sum, the longstanding position of HHS has been that agreements such as the Sales Agreements at issue herein
are inherently subject to abuse.
5. Case Law
Finally, several courts have held that contracts similar to the Sales Agreements are
unlawful under the AKS. In Joint Technology, Inc. v. Weaver, No. CV-11-846, 2013 WL
257075, at *1 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 23, 2013), the plaintiff, a durable medical equipment supplier,
hired defendant “as an independent [sales] agent to solicit referral business from various medical
- 13 -

providers and health clinics.” The durable medical equipment supplier argued at summary
judgment that the defendant sales representative was, in fact, an employee (and not a contractor),
which factual dispute the court resolved against the supplier, finding that the sales representative
was not an employee. Id. at *2. The Court in turn held that the agreement between the supplier
and the sales representative was void under the AKS, “because the Agreement provided for [the
supplier] to pay [the sales representative] commission based upon the volume of his sales and
because Medicare and Medicaid paid an average of 20% of [the supplier’s] total billings. In
other words, [the supplier] paid [the sales representative] to solicit Medicare or Medicaid
referrals.” Id. at *3. The district court’s decision was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, which held
that the parties’ agreement violated the AKS. Joint Tech., Inc. v. Weaver, 567 Fed. Appx. 585
(10th Cir. 2014). See also Zimmer, Inc. v. NuTech Med., Inc., 54 F. Supp. 2d 850 (N.D. Ind.
1999) (granting plaintiff manufacturer’s motion for summary judgment against defendant, who
marketed and distributed products, noting Advisory Opinion 98-1 – which had been submitted to
HHS OIG by the parties – finding that the agreement violated the AKS and was therefore illegal
and unenforceable); Nursing Home Consultants, Inc. v. Quantum Health Servs., Inc., 926 F.
Supp. 835, 837-44 (E.D. Ark. 1996) (granting defendant medical supplier’s motion for summary
judgment against plaintiff marking company, finding that the commission-based sales
arrangement is prohibited by the AKS and is not “saved by the ‘safe harbor’ regulations”); Med.
Dev. Network, Inc. v. Prof’l Respiratory Care, 673 So. 2d 565 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996)
(holding that commission-based sales agreement between durable medical equipment supplier
and marketing company was “void and unenforceable as a matter of law,” citing AKS).
In sum, courts as well as HHS OIG have repeatedly found commission-based sales
agreements with independent contractors to violate the AKS. HHS OIG made a conscious
- 14 -

choice to exclude such agreements from the AKS’ safe harbors due to the potential for program
abuse.

Finally, the plain language of the AKS precludes such arrangements.

The Sales

Agreements are unlawful.

ARGUMENT
A. Prejudgment relief is warranted because the United States has established the
probable validity of its claim of debt in the amount of at least $58 million for
Johnson and Dent individually and $240 million for BlueWave.
Where, as here, prejudgment relief is sought, the FDCPA states that the government
“shall include an affidavit establishing with particularity to the court’s satisfaction facts
supporting the probable validity of the claim for a debt and the right of the United States to
recover what is demanded in the application.” 28 U.S.C. § 3101(c)(1). This affidavit, which
may be made on information and belief, 28 U.S.C. § 3006, shall also state “specifically the
amount of the debt claimed by the United States and any interest or costs attributable to such
debt.” 28 U.S.C. § 3101(c)(2)(A). The court may consider the “totality of the circumstances”
when evaluating whether the government has established the probable validity of its claims.
DeGregorio, 510 F. Supp. 2d at 885 (citing United States v. Teeven, 862 F. Supp. 1200, 1218
n.24 (D. Del. 1992)). The United States is supporting this Application through the declaration of
Su Kim, Special Agent, HHS OIG, and the affidavit of Kendrick Bailey, Investigator, U.S.
Department of Justice, Civil Division; through the BlueWave Defendants filings and testimony
in other, related litigation; and through numerous documents produced by the BlueWave
Defendants.
Prejudgment relief is warranted in view of the strength of the United States’ FCA case.
The evidence is strong that the BlueWave Defendants violated the AKS by entering into and
performing under the Sales Agreements, arranging for kickbacks to physicians, and arranging for
- 15 -

medically unnecessary testing.
Johnson and Dent incorporated BlueWave in the State of Alabama on January 4, 2010,
and it was formed to act as the formal sales and marketing entity that would contract with HDL.
Ex. 5; Ex. 6 at ¶ 8. Johnson and Dent jointly co-own BlueWave; each has equal shares. Ex. 7
(Trial Tr. 853:21-22) 3; Ex. 8 at ¶ 7. 4 BlueWave’s business address is 307 Commercial Street,
S.E., Hanceville, Alabama, which consists of a 14,000 square foot lot containing a single family
residence and a garage. Ex. 5; Ex. 9 (appraised value of the property is $65,000 as of November
2015). BlueWave owns no real property and owns de minimis personal property in the form of
office furniture and equipment. Ex. 8 at ¶ 20. On September 21, 2012, Defendant Johnson sold
the property located at 307 Commercial Street, S.E., to Royal Blue Medical, Inc. (“Royal Blue”)
for $42,800. Ex. 9. Defendant Johnson incorporated Royal Blue in July 2007. Ex. 10. The
following corporate entities associated with Defendant Johnson also operate out of the 307
Commercial Street, S.E., address: Royal Blue, BlueWave, Blue Eagle Farming, LLC (“Blue
Eagle Farming”), H J Farming, LLC (“H J Farming”), Eagle Ray Investments, LLC (“Eagle Ray
Investments”), Cobalt Healthcare Consultants, Inc. (“Cobalt”), and Blue Smash Investments,
LLC (“Blue Smash Investments”). Exs. 5, 10-15.
The only commercial activity performed by BlueWave was done pursuant to the Sales
Agreements it entered into with HDL and Singulex. Ex. 8 at ¶¶ 17-18. The Sales Agreements
were terminated in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Id. at ¶ 17; Ex. 2 at ¶ 19. In April 2010,

- 16 -

Latonya Mallory (a named Defendant in the instant action and former CEO and co-founder of
HDL) on behalf of HDL, and Johnson and Dent, on behalf of BlueWave, executed a Sales
Agreement, which was dated January 4, 2010 (the same date as BlueWave’s incorporation),
wherein BlueWave would serve as HDL’s exclusive outside sales force in certain enumerated
states: Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina,
Louisiana and Texas. Ex. 1 at ¶ 1. The HDL Sales Agreement provided that, if BlueWave met
certain sales goals, BlueWave would “have a right of first refusal to expand the Territory into
other states in which [HDL] plans to do business.” Id. Pursuant to that Sales Agreement, HDL
appointed BlueWave “as its independent contractor to perform certain sales services for” HDL,
“including the sale of various laboratory tests and services of [HDL] to physicians and medical
groups.” Id. More specifically, BlueWave agreed to “use its best efforts to maximize” specific
sales goals. Id. at ¶ 2. In return, HDL agreed, inter alia, to pay physicians between $18-$21 in
process and handling fees and to provide zero balance billing for Medicare and Medicaid. Id. at
¶ 3. The HDL Sales Agreement stated that:
[BlueWave] shall act as and be deemed to be an independent
contractor for all purposes of this Agreement and shall not act, nor
shall [BlueWave] be deemed to be, an agent, employee or servant
of [HDL]. This Agreement is not intended to be one of hiring
under the provisions of any workers’ compensation or any other
law, and shall not be so construed. [BlueWave] has sole
responsibility for making any payment for local, state, federal or
international tax purposes.
Id. at ¶ 10. Also pursuant to the HDL Sales Agreement, HDL paid BlueWave a monthly base
fee, plus a “commission equal to. . . 13.8% of the revenue collected by HDL from sales” in
BlueWave’s territory. Id. at ¶ 4. After September 30, 2011, BlueWave was to be paid an
“Increased Commission” that was “equal to . . . 19.8% of the revenue collected by [HDL] from
sales” in the same territory. Id. The Agreement also conveyed shares in HDL to Johnson and
- 17 -

Dent as individuals.

Id.

Between January 2010 and January 2015, BlueWave and HDL

performed under the Agreement, and, by January 2015, BlueWave served as a large, independent
sales and marketing force to HDL. Ex. 2 at ¶ 12; Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 2, 15, 17.
On June 1, 2010, BlueWave, Johnson, and Dent executed a similar Sales Agreement with
Singulex. Ex. 4. This agreement named BlueWave as Singulex’s outside sales force. Id. at ¶ 1.
Pursuant to the Singulex Agreement, BlueWave was paid a monthly commission of 24% of
Singulex’s revenue collected from sales generated by BlueWave as BlueWave’s fee for
arranging for or recommending to doctors that they refer patients’ blood testing to Singulex. Ex.
4 at ¶ 5.
BlueWave has principally had three employees: Johnson is the President; Dent is the
Vice President; and there has been an office administrator (who was terminated in November
2013). Ex. 7 (Trial Tr. 927:22 – 928:4); Ex. 8 at ¶ 16. BlueWave made the decision to operate
using corporate entities or independent contractors when obtaining representation for the various
sale territories outlined in the Sales Agreements. Ex. 7 (Trial Tr. 927:22 – 928:4); Ex. 3 at ¶ 17.
BlueWave has, at various points in time, contracted with over 30 individuals who operated as
independent contractors to fulfill its obligations under the Sales Agreements. Ex. 6 at ¶ 22.
Defendant Dent himself signed an independent contractor agreement with BlueWave
effective April 1, 2011, in which BlueWave named Dent’s marketing company, HisWay of
South Carolina, Inc., as its representative in South Carolina, parts of North Carolina, and
Augusta, Georgia, to market and sell HDL and Singulex tests (“the HisWay Agreement”). Ex.
16. Pursuant to the HisWay Agreement, BlueWave paid HisWay a quarterly commission of 6%
of revenues collected from sales HisWay generated for HDL and 10% of revenues collected from
sales HisWay generated for Singulex. Id. at ¶ 4. Similarly, Defendant Johnson signed an
- 18 -

independent contractor agreement effective April 1, 2011, in which BlueWave named Johnson’s
marketing company Royal Blue as its representative in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, part of
Georgia, and the Florida panhandle to market and sell HDL and Singulex tests (“the Royal Blue
Agreement”). Ex. 17. Pursuant to the Royal Blue Agreement, BlueWave paid Royal Blue a
quarterly commission of 2% of revenues collected from sales Royal Blue generated for HDL and
3.33% of revenues collected from sales Royal Blue generated for Singulex. Id. at ¶ 4. The Sales
Agreements as well as the agreements between BlueWave and its sales force were structured
such that the more tests physicians ordered for their patients, the more money the BlueWave
Defendants as well as the sales representatives earned. See Ex. 2 at ¶ 7; Ex. 6 at ¶ 13.
BlueWave sales representatives, including Defendants Johnson and Dent, marketed the
HDL and Singulex laboratory tests pursuant to their agreements with BlueWave. Ex. 2 at ¶ 12;
Ex. 6 at ¶ 16. For instance, Defendant Johnson spent 85-90 percent of his time on direct sales for
BlueWave.

Ex. 7 (Trial Tr. 854:19-22, 855:1); see also id. (Trial Tr. 935:1-2 (Defendant

Johnson testified: “My job is to find accounts, target accounts, isolate accounts, work with the
reps, see where I can open accounts at.”)).

BlueWave sales representatives, including

Defendants Johnson and Dent, went to physicians’ offices and tried to convince them to order
HDL and Singulex laboratory tests. Ex. 6 at ¶ 28, 7 (Trial Tr. 954:11-14; 955:6-10). BlueWave
sales representatives used a variety of techniques, including showing physicians studies on the
clinical utility of the tests, pointing to the compensation the practice would receive from the
payment of process and handling fees, and stating that patients would not receive a bill. Ex. 6 at
¶ 28; see also Ex. 7 (Trial Tr. 935:11-18 (Defendant Johnson testified that he “look[s] for select
criteria on a physician before I talk to them,” including that the physician is “money hungry”)).
The BlueWave Defendants successfully marketed the HDL and Singulex tests; for instance, all
- 19 -

of Defendant Dent’s client-physicians switched from Defendant Berkeley to HDL when
Defendant Dent left Defendant Berkeley to start selling for HDL. Ex. 6 at ¶ 28. Notably, HDL
and Singulex paid significantly higher process and handling fees to physicians than Berkeley.
Compl. ¶¶ 78-79, 105, ECF No. 75.
Between 2010 and 2015, HDL paid BlueWave $223.9 million. Ex. 6 at ¶ 29. Singulex
paid BlueWave $24.5 million during the same period. Id. In turn, BlueWave paid its sales
representatives on a quarterly basis. Id. at ¶ 30. BlueWave tracked the number of samples
physicians ordered from HDL and Singulex, as well as which of the samples were attributable to
which sales representative. Id. Specifically, BlueWave paid HisWay $12 million and paid
Royal Blue $5.9 million. Id. In 2013 alone, Defendant Dent earned approximately $5 million
from HisWay. Id. BlueWave paid salaries to its two employees, Defendants Johnson and Dent;
they each received over $58 million from BlueWave for the period from 2010-2014.

Id.; see

also Ex. 8 at ¶ 16.
Both Sales Agreements have been terminated.

The Singulex Sales Agreement was

terminated in October 2014. Ex. 8 at ¶ 17. HDL terminated its Sales Agreement with BlueWave
on January 9, 2015. Ex. 2 at ¶ 19. BlueWave and HDL in turn cross-sued each other; BlueWave
sued HDL for over $180 million in the Northern District of Alabama for breach of contract while
HDL sued BlueWave in the Eastern District of Virginia seeking a non-compete injunction. See
Exs. 2-3. 5 In its Complaint, HDL averred that: “Based on its analysis and information obtained

5

Defendant BlueWave has filed two lawsuits against HDL, only one of which is pending.
Defendant BlueWave filed its first Complaint against HDL on January 9, 2015. See BlueWave
v. HDL, No. 5:15-cv-0030-HGD (N.D. Ala. 2015). Defendant BlueWave voluntarily dismissed
that action, which request was granted by the Court on April 2, 2015.
Id. (ECF No. 15).
Defendant BlueWave filed a subsequent lawsuit against HDL on May 28, 2015, for which HDL
has filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy and the Court has stayed those proceedings. See BlueWave
v. HDL II (ECF No. 4). HDL and BlueWave have resolved the lawsuit filed by HDL in the
- 20 -

from other sources, HDL concluded that certain provisions of the Sales Agreement posed a
potential risk of violating or potentially inducing the violation of Federal and state laws.” Ex. 3
at ¶ 3. Furthermore, HDL explained that it terminated the Agreement based upon its “concer[n]
that the sales agreement posed a risk of violating or inducing the violation of Federal and state
laws.” Id. at ¶ 26. For its part, Defendant BlueWave, in a separate lawsuit in the Northern
District of Alabama, described that: “HDL has now claimed that the Contract contains a
provision that poses a risk of violating federal or state laws.” Ex. 2 at ¶ 10. In its lawsuit,
Defendant BlueWave does not dispute HDL’s claim that the Sales Agreement was potentially
unlawful. 6 Rather, BlueWave argues that HDL did not comply with the Sales Agreement terms
governing what transpires when the contract is deemed unenforceable. Id. at ¶¶ 14-17.
Because the BlueWave Defendants “arranged for” and “recommended” laboratory tests
reimbursed by federal health care programs, they are liable under the AKS and, in turn, the FCA.
The United States has established the probable validity of its claim under the FDCPA.
B.

The BlueWave Defendants have concealed and disposed of property with
the effect of hindering or delaying recovery by the United States.
The United States is entitled to prejudgment remedies in this case because there is

“reasonable cause to believe that” the debtors “ha[ve] or [are] about to assign, dispose, remove,
conceal, ill treat, waste, or destroy property with the effect of hindering, delaying, or defrauding
the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 3101(b)(1)(B). Prejudgment remedies are also appropriate

In its Complaint, Defendant BlueWave states: “On information and belief, the Contract was
drafted or reviewed by the law firm of LeClair Ryan on behalf of HDL. Any illegality in the
contract should have been apparent to that firm at the time that the Contract was prepared.” Ex.
2 at ¶ 11. Defendant BlueWave offers no other response to the lawfulness of the contracts.
- 21 -

where the debtor “has or is about to convert the debtor’s property into money, securities, or
evidence of debt in a manner prejudicial to the United States with the effect of hindering,
delaying, or defrauding the United States.” Id. at § 3101(b)(1)(C).
The United States must only demonstrate that the Defendants’ actions have had the effect
of, inter alia, disposing of or concealing assets that would hinder the ability of the United States
to recover; the United States need not demonstrate that the Defendants intended to hinder the
United States. Teeven, 862 F. Supp. at 1214 n.12 (FDCPA “does not require the Government to
show that a debtor’s actions are fraudulent or secretive. Rather, the Government must provide
the Court with a reasonable cause to believe the Defendants have or are about to take actions
with regard to their properties that would have ‘the effect of hindering, delaying or defrauding
the United States.’ 28 U.S.C. § 3101(b). The statute contains no ‘intent’ requirement.”).
Defendants Johnson and Dent have concealed and disposed of assets, which will have the
effect of impeding or delaying the United States’ recovery. Since notice of the investigation –
particularly issuance of a HHS OIG subpoena to Defendant BlueWave on January 25, 2013 –
Defendants Johnson and Dent have operated to divest and conceal their personal interest in real
properties through corporate entities and family members. Some examples follow.
Defendant Dent
• Dent sold real property he purchased for approximately $1.6 million to his wife for $5 on
May 1, 2013, the very same day that he purchased it. Ex. 18 at ¶ 6; Ex. 19. He also sold a
nearby parcel of property, which he had purchased for approximately $2.7 million (just
days prior), to her for $5 on August 21, 2013. Id. at ¶ 7; Exs. 20-21.
• Defendant Dent’s wife, who has no previous corporations registered in South Carolina,
registered four corporations in that state in 2014. Ex. 18 at ¶ 9. Two of those entities now
hold property which had been originally purchased by Defendant Dent. Id.
• On February 20, 2014, Defendant Dent engaged in property reorganization which had the
effect of removing his name from the ownership records for many properties previously
titled in his name. Ex. 18 at ¶¶ 8, 10. First, Defendant Dent’s wife sold the above- 22 -

described $2.7 million property to one of her corporations for $5. Id. at ¶ 11; Exs. 20-21.
Defendant Dent in turn sold an additional six adjoining properties to his wife for $5. Ex.
18 at ¶ 10; Exs. 22-27. Finally, Dent also sold a nearby island to one of his wife’s new
corporate entities for $5. Ex. 18 at ¶ 8; Ex. 28. The result was that in less than six months
eight nearby or adjoining properties switched from being held in Defendant Dent’s name
to those of his wife or her corporations.
• In February of 2014, Defendant Dent’s wife, on behalf of one of her newly-formed
corporations, granted a life estate in one of the eight properties (previously in Defendant
Dent’s name) to what appear to be her parents for $5. Ex. 18 at ¶ 11; Ex. 19. Defendant
Dent’s wife did the same for a separate, nearby property in December of 2014 which now
has a life estate in it for Defendant Dent’s parents. Ex. 18 at ¶ 6; Ex. 21.
•

On July 19, 2014, Defendant Dent sold a property in Columbia, South Carolina, held in
his own name to CAE Properties for $5. Ex. 18 at ¶ 12; Ex. 29. The listed agent for
CAE Properties is Defendant Dent’s father. Id.; Ex. 30. Defendant Dent has at least two
companies that remain registered at this address, including Cobalt as well as a newlyformed Nevada company. Exs. 14, 18, 31.

Defendant Johnson
•

On June 23, 2014, Defendant Johnson, who previously was the sole owner of his home at
106 View Point Circle in Hanceville, Alabama, filed a warranty deed reflecting that he
and his wife were joint owners therein with rights of survivorship for $1. Ex. 18 at ¶ 16;
Ex. 32. On June 30, 2015, Defendant Johnson sold this property for $562,000, divesting
himself of one of only two real properties identified by the government held in his own
name as of 2015. Ex. 18 at ¶ 16; Ex. 32.

•

On April 5, 2013, Defendant Johnson sold a single family home in Blountsville, Alabama
for $390,000, again divesting one of the only real properties held in his name at that time.
Ex. 18 at ¶ 14; Ex. 33.

•

On August 9, 2013, Defendant Johnson through his corporation, Eagle Ray Investments,
purchased a condominium in the Gulf Shores valued at $873,400, placing a corporate
shield between him and a newly-acquired asset. Ex. 18 at ¶ 15; Ex. 34.

•

On September 21, 2014, Defendant Johnson sold his principal place of business,
307 Commercial Street, Hanceville, Alabama to his corporation, Royal Blue, for $42,800,
again removing property in his name and placing it behind a corporate entity. Ex. 18 at
¶ 18; Ex. 9.

•

Recently, on September 4, 2015, the title from “0” 15th Avenue, Attalla, Alabama was
transferred from Defendant Johnson’s corporation, Forse Investments, LLC (“Forse
Investments”), to “Ball, Duane & WF Adrian Ball” and on March 3, 2015, the title for
108 5th Avenue, Attalla, Alabama was transferred from Forse Investments transferred to
“Norman and Diane Chaviers.” Ex. 18 at ¶ 17, 19; Exs. 35-36. The mailing addresses
- 23 -

for both properties had been 307 Commercial Street (where Defendant Johnson’s other
companies are located), and that address did not change after the names on the titles were
changed. Ex. 18 at ¶ 17, 19; Exs. 35-36. In both instances, Defendant Johnson was
previously listed as the owner and the title linking the properties to him through his
corporations was removed; the mailing addresses demonstrate that the properties
nevertheless remain affiliated with his businesses. 7
Defendant Johnson also changed the listed agent on corporations that he incorporated,
operating to conceal his interest. On November 21, 2014, Defendant Johnson changed the
registered agent for five of his companies; those companies previously listed Defendant Johnson
and now publicly list his accountant. Ex. 18 at ¶ 20; see also Exs. 11-13, 15, 37. Of those, three
hold title to real property. Ex. 18 at ¶ 20 (The fourth company describes itself in its registration
statements also as a real estate investment firm. Id.; Ex. 15.) Public real property records now
show the corporations as owners and the public corporate documents show Defendant Johnson’s
accountant as the agent.
In addition to having sold and concealed these assets, Defendant BlueWave’s cash-onhand is routinely dissipated. In November of 2014, BlueWave’s bank account listed that it had
$181,840 available in cash. Ex. 6 at ¶ 33. In February 28, 2015, bank records show that
BlueWave had approximately $1.8 million in an account. Id. at ¶ 34. This is in contrast to
BlueWave’s reported gross income of $74 million in 2013. Id. at ¶ 31, Ex. 8. Defendant
BlueWave has represented to the United States that it has no ability to pay the damages in this
case. Ex. 6 at ¶ 32; Ex. 8.
Most troubling, Defendants Dent and Johnson incorporated as co-owners a new
healthcare marketing company, Cobalt, in January of 2013. Ex. 6 at ¶ 35; Ex. 14. Cobalt is
operated out of the same location as BlueWave. Id. A review of a bank account in Cobalt’s
7

If the government’s request for financial discovery is granted by the Court, the government
anticipates seeking information about whether these two properties were fraudulently conveyed
or are titled in the name of nominees.
- 24 -

name at Cadence Bank in Blountsville, Alabama shows that since 2013 BlueWave has deposited
$5.4 million into Cobalt’s account, along with another $4.6 million from Defendant Dent and
$1.275 million from Defendant Johnson personally. Id. at ¶ 36. Defendant Johnson has admitted
that when “some legal issues arose” regarding a previous corporation he had owned and
operated, Forse Medical, Inc., Defendant Johnson started a new company “to have a fresh new
company with no past issues.” Ex. 6 at ¶ 37. The assets being put into Cobalt are being taken
from the BlueWave Defendants, hindering the United States’ ability to recover. 8
As set forth above, the BlueWave Defendants have been rapidly disposing of or
concealing their assets. If prejudgment relief is not granted, there is a strong possibility that
there will be nothing left to recover at the end of the suit, and the BlueWave Defendants will
have disposed of or tied up their remaining assets, all with the effect of hindering the United
States’ recovery.
C. The amount of the debt owing to the United States.
The amount of the debt owing to the United States is at least $58 million for Johnson and
Dent individually and $240 million for BlueWave. The United States is seeking liens and
garnishment with the amount of security at approximately $16.7 million. 9

See Ex. 39

(declaration of undersigned counsel regarding the amount of security sought). As explained
8

The United States also notes concern that both Defendants Dent and Johnson have recently
opened new limited-liability partnerships in Nevada. Defendant Dent filed a certificate of
limited partnership for Helm-Station Investments, LP, and in turn registered a limited-liability
limited partnership, Helm-Station Investments, LLLP, on February 5, 2014. Ex. 31. Similarly,
Defendant Johnson filed a certificate of limited partnership for War-Horse Properties, LP, on
April 15, 2015, and then registered a limited-liability limited partnership, War-Horse Properties,
LLLP on the same day. Ex. 38.
9

This estimation is based upon the available real property assessment or sales price, whichever
is higher. The estimations for the assets are based upon information for similar boats available
online and from the county-assessed value of the airplane.
- 25 -

below, moreover, the prejudgment remedies sought should have little effect on Defendant
BlueWave’s current business since both Sales Agreements have been terminated and Defendant
BlueWave has no other operations. The amount sought is based on single damages available
under the FCA and common law, and is well below the amount of damages and penalties
available under the FCA and common law. The FCA imposes liability for treble damages, as
well as a minimum penalty of $5,500 and a maximum penalty of $11,000, for each false claim
submitted. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a), as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment
Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. § 2461 note. See 28 C.F.R. § 85.3(a)(9) (adjusting FCA penalties). See
United States v. United Techs. Corp., No. 3:99-cv-093, 2008 U.S. Dist. Lexis 61199, at *33
(W.D. Ohio Aug. 1, 2008) (awarding penalty for each invoice submitted), aff’d on liability, rev’d
on damages calculation, 626 F.3d 313 (6th Cir. 2010); Cantrell v. N.Y. Univ., 326 F. Supp. 2d
468, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (each invoice constitutes a false claim). The United States’ Complaint
alleges that the BlueWave Defendants conspired with and caused HDL and Singulex to submit
false claims to Medicare, resulting in at least $333 million in tainted reimbursement to HDL
alone. Compl. ¶ 119, ECF No. 75. Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that the BlueWave
Defendants received over $240 million in commission-based payments from client laboratories,
HDL and Singulex. Id. at ¶¶ 122, 193-94. Of those payments, between 2010 and 2013, Johnson
and Dent each received at least $58 million in illegal commission-based payments. Id. at ¶ 195;
Ex. 8 at ¶ 16.

The United States also seeks penalties on the tainted claims submitted to

Medicare. Id. at ¶¶ 31, 51, 55, 60. 10
The United States believes that the Court need not thoroughly analyze these factors at this
10

Although the FCA generally has a six-year statute of limitations, 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1), the
United States’ Complaint relates back to the date that the first relators filed their Complaint in
this action, which is July 15, 2011. 31 U.S.C. § 3731(c).
- 26 -

early stage of the proceeding, because the United States is only seeking prejudgment remedies of
$16.7 million, when damages under the FCA and common law total hundreds of millions of
dollars. As described above, the Defendants’ conduct is deliberate, repeated, and egregious. The
Defendants entered into blatantly illegal Sales Agreements which bore out the exact concerns
articulated by HHS OIG when commission-based sales representatives are not treated as
employees. That is, a massive kickback scheme ensued between the laboratory clients and the
BlueWave sales representatives to pay illegal process and handling fees to physicians, resulting
in hundreds of millions of dollars of payment from Federal health care programs, operating to
line the BlueWave Defendants’ pockets. See Compl. ¶¶ 153-71, ECF No. 75.
D.

Prejudgment remedies sought.
The United States seeks the prejudgment remedies of writs of attachment and

garnishment. Despite the egregious and pervasive nature of the Defendants’ conduct, the United
States is tailoring its request so that it will have a minimal effect on the BlueWave Defendants at
this stage of the proceeding.
1.

Writs of Attachment

The United States seeks writs against personal and real property held in the name of
Defendants Johnson and Dent as well as their family members and respective corporations. The
United States may seek a writ of attachment against “[a]ny property in the possession, custody,
or control of the debtor and in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt 11 interest . . . .” 28
U.S.C. § 3102(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also 28 U.S.C. § 3010(a) (“The remedies available to

11

The exemptions are found at 28 U.S.C. § 3014(a) and, briefly, concern certain property
exempt under the Bankruptcy Code as well as under various Federal and state homestead laws.
Defendant Johnson recently sold the real property at 106 View Point Circle in Hanceville,
Alabama, which was believed to be his homestead. Defendant Dent’s homestead is unknown.
- 27 -

the United States under this chapter may be enforced against property which is co-owned by a
debtor and any other person only to the extent allowed by the law of the State where the property
is located.”)

The FDCPA broadly defines “property” to “include . . . any present or future

interest, whether legal or equitable, in real, personal (including choses in action), or mixed
property, tangible or intangible, vested or contingent, wherever located and however held.” See
also Ex. 20 setting forth requirements of § 3102(b)). A writ of attachment merely serves as a lien
upon property subject to the writ, 28 U.S.C. § 3102(f)(1), and does not entitle the United States
to sell the property until further order of the Court. Id. at § 3102(d)(1). However, the lien
preserves the United States’ interest in the property and gives notice to creditors for the duration
of the suit. Id. at § 3102(f). The writ of attachment must provide a reasonable description of the
property to be attached. Id. at § 3102(c)(3)(E). The attached writs contain such information.
The below writs of attachment are sought against personal and real property held in the
name of (1) Defendant Johnson and his respective alter ego corporations, Royal Blue, Forse
Investments, and Blue Eagle Farming, as well as (2) Defendant Dent and his respective alter ego
corporations, his wife, her alter ego corporations, and life estates in relatives’ names.
Regarding properties titled in corporate names, attachment is appropriate because
Defendants Dent and Johnson as the debtors have a substantial interest in those real properties, as
that term is used in 28 U.S.C. § 3102(a)(1). That is, Defendants themselves have the required
interest through their corporations. Moreover, and in any event, these corporations are the alter
egos of the Defendants. In other FDCPA cases, courts have borrowed from the related tax lien
framework. See Ex.-Im. Bank of the U.S. v. Asia Pulp & Paper Co., 609 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir.
2010); United States v. Meux, 597 F.3d 835, 838 (7th Cir. 2010) (noting that a lien under the
FDCPA, with respect to an order of restitution, may attach to the same extent as under the tax
- 28 -

code); see also United States v. Fed. Res. Corp., No. 1:11-cv-00127, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
138489,at *9-10 (D. Idaho Oct. 9, 2015) (holding that “the relationship of a judicial lien [under
the FDCPA] to the real property it encumbers is similar to that of a tax lien”). In federal tax lien
enforcement actions, courts have determined that a corporation is an alter ego, nominee, or
instrument of the debtor under both Alabama and South Carolina law. 12

See Mama’s Enters.,

LLC v. United States, 883 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1135 (N.D. Ala. 2012) (declining to lift federal tax
liens on alter egos, finding that Alabama law has long provided that a corporation may be the
alter-ego of a person or another entity); United States v. Vito, No. 99-0630-RV-S, 2000 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 11258, at *2-3 (S.D. Ala. July 13, 2000) (imposing federal tax liens on real property
held in the name of defendant’s alter ego and/or nominee corporation).
An FDCPA writ of attachment may also be issued against property titled in the name of
another when the debtor is the true owner of the property. Again borrowing from the context of
tax liens, nominee liens focus on who the true beneficial owner of the property is. See United
States v. Alexander, No. 6:08-cv-03760-GRA, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40108 (D.S.C. Apr. 22,
2010) (enforcing nominee tax lien and observing that the Fourth Circuit “does not appear to have
adopted a test in determining whether to enforce a nominee lien”). The Court in Alexander went
on to apply a comprehensive six-factor analysis employed by other Circuits in determining
whether to enforce a nominee tax lien:
(1) whether inadequate or no consideration was paid by the
nominee; (2) whether the property was placed in the nominee’s
name in anticipation of a lawsuit or other liability while the
transferor remains in control of the property; (3) whether there is a

An interest in property is generally determined by the relevant state law under the FDCPA
Ex.-Im. of the U.S., 609 F.3d at 117; see also United States v. Kollintzas, 501 F.3d 796, 802-03
(7th Cir. 2007) (applying FDCPA to enforcement of criminal, rather than civil, judgment
requires reliance on state law to determine an “interest” in property.).

close relationship between the nominee and the transferor; (4)
whether they failed to record the conveyance; (5) whether the
transferor retained possession; and (6) whether the transferor
continues to enjoy the benefits of the transferred property.
Id. (citing and quoting Holman v. United States, 505 F.3d 1060, 1065 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007) and
Spotts v. United States, 429 F.3d 248, 251 (6th Cir. 2005)). See May v. A Parcel of Land, 458
F. Supp. 2d 1324, 1334-1341 (S.D. Ala. 2006) (attaching federal tax liens against real property
held by nominees, where husband transferred title to spouse and applying similar seven factor
analysis); see also United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 283 (2002) (“[I]n determining whether a
federal [taxpayer-debtor’s] state-law rights constitute ‘property’ or ‘rights to property,’ the
important consideration is the breadth of the control the [debtor] could exercise over the
property.”) (internal quotations and citations omitted). As described below, the property sought
to be attached is variously held in Defendants’ name, held through a corporate alter ego, or held
through a nominee.
a. Writs of Attachment – Personal Property
The United States seeks writs of attachment on an airplane owned by Defendant Johnson
through his corporation, Royal Blue, as well as four boats owned by Defendant Dent personally.
Defendant Dent has the requisite interest, where he is the named owner of the boats. The
airplane and boats are specifically described by manufacturer, descriptive information, title
number, and location of registration in the proposed writ that accompanies this Application.
As to Defendant Johnson’s nonexempt substantial interest in the plane, Defendant
Johnson incorporated Royal Blue on June 27, 2007, and is the only listed officer and agent. Ex.
10. He is also the owner. Ex. 6 at ¶ 19. Royal Blue is operated out of the real property from
which Defendant Johnson operates at least five of his other corporate alter egos. Exs. 5, 10-15.
Royal Blue has a bank account at Cadence Bank in Blountsville, Alabama, and Defendant
- 30 -

Johnson is the only signatory on that account. Ex. 6 at ¶ 38. Defendant Johnson most recently
paid the personal property tax levied on the airplane by Marshall County, Alabama from that
account. Exs. 40-41. Defendant Johnson also paid the City of Albertville, which is located in
Marshall County, Alabama, from that same account; the check memo describes that it is for:
“Brad Johnson hanger.” Ex. 42. Defendant Johnson routinely wrote checks to an aircraft
maintenance company located in Marshall County, Alabama. Ex. 43. Defendant Johnson is a
pilot. Ex. 44. Finally, Defendant Johnson had access to the plane and was the decision-maker
regarding whether to pay sales tax on the plane. Ex. 45. The United States has established that
Defendant Johnson through Royal Blue has a substantial interest in the airplane.
In this instance, the United States does not intend to take possession of the boats or the
airplane. Rather, the United States would merely make a UCC filing with the South Carolina
and Alabama Secretaries of State that gives notice to potential creditors of the United States’
interest in the property. Defendants Dent and Johnson would continue to possess and be able to
use the property.
b. Writs of Attachment – Real Property
The United States is also seeking writs of attachment for real property in which
Defendants Johnson and Dent have a substantial nonexempt interest.
1. Writs of Attachment – Real Property – Defendant Johnson
The United States seeks writs of attachment on forty-nine properties in which Defendant
Johnson has such an interest; one is held by the Defendant in his own name, one is held through
Eagle Ray Investments, seventeen are held by Blue Eagle Farming, and the remainder are held
through Forse Investments. Defendant Johnson has a substantial nonexempt interest within the
meaning 28 U.S.C. § 3102(a)(1) in the properties held by Eagle Ray Investments, Blue Eagle
- 31 -

Farming, and Forse Investments.
Defendant Johnson registered Forse Investments on November 20, 2003, listing the
purposes as: “[r]eal estate activities including but not limited to purchase and sell [sic] of real
estate; rental activities; and all other lawful business activities allowed under the State of
Alabama.” Ex. 37. He lists himself as the initial member and organizer, as well as the manager.
Id. Defendant Johnson registered Blue Eagle Farming on April 5, 2012, and is listed as the
initial member as well as registered agent. Ex. 11. Defendant Johnson registered Eagle Ray
Investments on September 28, 2012, listing himself as the organizer, sole manager, and
registered agent. Ex. 13.
Defendant Johnson treats his corporate alter egos interchangeably as himself and without
regard to corporate form. Defendant Johnson operates six businesses from 307 Commercial St.,
SE, Birmingham, Alabama (the 14,000 square foot lot containing a single family residence and a
garage): BlueWave, Royal Blue, Blue Eagle Farming, H J Farming, Eagle Ray Investments,
Cobalt and Blue Smash Investments. Exs. 5, 10-15. He operates Forse Investment out of a
location in Birmingham, Alabama. Ex. 37. On November 21, 2014, Defendant Johnson
authorized a change in registered agent from himself to his accountant on many of his
companies, including Forse Investments, Blue Eagle Farming, H J Farming, Eagle Ray
Investments, and Blue Smash Investments. Exs. 11-13, 15, 37.
Defendant BlueWave sent a Confidentiality Agreement to two of its independent sales
contractors in 2010, requiring confidentiality between the representatives and BlueWave, Royal
Blue, Forse Medical, Forse Investments, and Defendant Johnson; a 2012 version of the same
Agreement required confidentiality with BlueWave, Royal Blue, Johnson Farming, Inc., and
Forse Investments, which are collectively referred to as BlueWave.
- 32 -

Exs. 46-47.

These

agreements show that he treated these corporations as interchangeable with himself.
Defendant Johnson owns (or has owned) several real properties in and around the city of
Hanceville, which is located in Cullman County, Alabama, as described below. He has owned
these properties in his own name or through his corporate alter egos. In 2012, however, those
real properties were held only in his own name or through one of his companies, Forse
Investments. Defendant Johnson paid “water and sewer,” “Cullman gas” and “Cullman electric”
from his Royal Blue checking account.

See, e.g., Ex. 48.

Defendant Johnson owns two

properties in Albertville located in Marshall County, Alabama, through Forse Investments; he
pays the city of Albertville through his Royal Blue checking account. Ex. 42. Moreover, the
real property records for one of those properties, in the name of Forse Investments, showed that
Defendant Johnson individually paid the tax liability on the property in January of 2011. Ex. 33.
Finally, Defendant Johnson has routinely moved many of the properties between and
among his personal name and his various corporate alter egos, as described below. Defendant
Johnson is the signatory on the available deed documents which evidence the transfers. See, e.g.,
Exs. 9, 50.
The United States seeks writs of attachment on the following real properties, in which
Defendant Johnson has a substantial nonexempt interest:

Neither “Blue Eagle Farmings, LLC” nor “Blue Eagle Farms, LLC” is a registered
corporation with the Alabama Secretary of State. The use of “Farms” or “Farmings” as opposed
to “Farming” appears to be simply an entry error by the property clerk. All properties listed in
these names also have a mailing address of 307 Commercial St., SE, Hanceville, Alabama.

2. Writ of Garnishment
The United States may also seek writs of garnishment (except on earnings) as part of its
prejudgment remedies.

28 U.S.C. §§ 3101(c)(2), 3104.

See also Ex. 20 (setting forth

requirements of § 3104(a)). The court may issue a writ of garnishment against property “in
which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and which is in the possession, custody, or
control of a person other than the debtor . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 3104(a).
The United States seeks to issue one writ of garnishment to Cadence Bank for three
accounts. Defendant BlueWave has an account ending in 4230 that held approximately $1.8
million as of February 2015; Defendants Dent and Johnson are the only owners and signatories
on this account. Ex. 6 at ¶ 38. Defendants Dent and Johnson, through their newly-formed
company, Cobalt, have an account ending in 6450 which held approximately $2 million as of
April 2015; Defendants Dent and Johnson are the only owners and signatories on this account.
- 39 -

Id. Finally, Royal Blue also has an account ending in 1155, which held approximately $32,000
as of April 2015; Defendant Johnson is the only owner and signatory on this account. Id.
E. Defendant Dent made eleven fraudulent transfers of real property.
As to Defendant Dent’s real property, the United States alternatively requests that the
court set aside eleven conveyances of real property and issue writs of attachment pursuant to
Subchapter D of the FDCPA, which governs fraudulent conveyances. The government seeks to
void the transactions that removed Defendant Dent as the owner for the real properties
described above, with the exception of 530 Lady Street in Columbia; that property has not
recently been transferred. The United States seeks to void the transactions described above for:

Island, Parcel J Island, Lexington, SC 29072, TIN 003200-06-086
According to 28 U.S.C. § 3304(b)(1)(A),
a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a debt to the United
States, whether such debt arises before or after the transfer is made or the obligation
incurred, if the debtor makes the transfer or incurs the obligation with actual intent to
hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor . . . .
In determining “actual intent” under § 3304(b)(1), the court may consider a number of factors
including whether,
- 40 -

(A) the transfer or obligation was to an insider;
(B) the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;
(C) the transfer obligation was disclosed or concealed;
(D) before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or
threatened with suit;
(E) the transfer was of substantially all the debtor’s assets;
(F) the debtor absconded;
(G) the debtor removed or concealed assets;
(H) the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the
value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;
(I) the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the
obligation was incurred;
(J) the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred;
(K) the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lien or who transferred
the assets to an insider of the debtor.
28 U.S.C. § 3304(b)(2). After showing that a fraudulent transfer has occurred, the United
States may obtain “(1) avoidance of the transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to satisfy
the debt to the United States; (2) a remedy under this chapter against the asset transferred or
other property of the transferee; or (3) any other relief the circumstances may require.” 28
U.S.C. § 3306(a).
Since notice of the investigation – particularly issuance of the HHS OIG subpoena to
Defendant BlueWave on January 25, 2013 – Defendant Dent has fraudulently conveyed these
eleven properties to family members and their corporations for little consideration with the
intent to hinder the United States’ recovery. These transactions are described in detail above.
In sum, Defendant Dent purchased real property for nearly $6 million in and around Lake
Murray in Lexington, South Carolina, which he then fraudulently conveyed to his wife or her
newly-formed companies for $20. The other property, located at 3318 Blossom Street in
Columbia, Defendant Dent fraudulently conveyed to his father for $5; the 2014 taxable value of
the property is listed at $384,900.

These transactions were to insiders for little to no

consideration after the United States served a subpoena on Defendant BlueWave and thus
- 41 -

should be voided. See Audio Invs. v. Robertson, 203 F. Supp. 2d 555 (D.S.C. 2004) (voiding
interfamily property transfers where United States asserted tax lien) (“Longstanding South
Carolina case law on the Statute of Elizabeth provides that voluntary conveyances to family
members will receive close scrutiny.”)
F.

Financial Discovery
Finally, and importantly, the United States also requests that it be permitted to conduct

financial discovery as part of this suit to discover any assets that the BlueWave Defendants may
have. Financial discovery is specifically permitted by 28 U.S.C. § 3015. Discovery will be
essential to determine necessary follow-up information, such as the location and existence of
other assets available to secure the debt owed to the United States and whether assets are
encumbered.

BlueWave operated for many years as a mere pass through entity, which

Defendants Dent and Johnson routinely dissipated for their personal gains. The United States
seeks to ascertain whether there are significant other assets available to satisfy its claims in this
litigation.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the United States respectfully requests that the Court authorize
the prejudgment writs of attachment and garnishment, direct the Clerk of Court to sign the
notices of attachment and garnishment, and authorize financial discovery.

- 42 -

A proposed order, proposed Clerk’s notices, and proposed writs of attachment and
garnishment are attached, and will also be emailed to Chambers in Word.
