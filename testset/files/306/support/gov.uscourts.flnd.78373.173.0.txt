IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
PENSACOLA DIVISION
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
vs.

Case No. 3:14cr91/MCR

KENT E. HOVIND,
Defendant.
______________________________/
DEFENDANT HOVIND’S MOTION IN LIMINE
REGARDING CHARGES IN ORIGINAL CASE
COMES NOW the defendant, KENT E. HOVIND, by and through his undersigned
attorney, and moves in limine as follows:
1. During the first trial the government introduced into evidence (without objection) the
following documents, among others, from Hovind’s original case (3:06cr83): the indictment
(Exh. 1), the verdict forms (Exhs. 2 & 3), and the judgments (Exhs. 6a & 6b). These documents
reveal all of the charges against Hovind and his wife, including those unrelated to the
“structuring” charges which lead to the forfeiture verdict by the jury (Exh. 4a). The other charges
(counts 1-12 & 58) were irrelevant to the forfeiture verdict.
2. Hovind submits that the jury in the upcoming trial should know as little as possible
about these other charges because they are irrelevant to the forfeiture verdict (which is the root of
the seizure and forfeiture of the real properties at issue in the instant case) and highly

prejudicial to Hovind as to the charges in the instant case. The prejudice is obvious. For
example, Count 58 of the indictment makes a number of allegations against Hovind regarding
obstructing or impeding the IRS. Knowing that he was convicted of this count will surely
unfairly prejudice the jury against him. No cautionary instruction could alleviate this unfair
prejudice.
3. Hovind realizes that it would be very difficult to keep the jury from being made aware
of the fact that he was convicted of and sentenced for these other charges, e.g., the Court’s Order
of July 29, 2009 (Exh. 10b) denying Glenn Stoll’s third party claim to the properties refers to
these other counts and Hovind’s overall sentence (pp. 5-6). However, the details of these other
charges should not be revealed to the jury by way of the indictment or any other document - or by
the testimony of a witness. In fact, references to these other charges should be kept to a bare
minimum. Any relevance of them is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice
and, therefore, under Fed.R.Evid.403, they should be excluded to the fullest extent possible.
4. Counsel has been unable to confer with Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Eggers
regarding this motion (she is in trial).
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 5th day of May 2015.
