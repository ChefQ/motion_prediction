UNITED STATES' RESPONSE TO JEFFERSON COUNTY'S
MOTION TO PERMIT SPECIFIC HIRING AUTHORIZATION

By motion dated January 24, 2012 (Doc, Entry No. 1769), Jefferson County sought relief
from a previous ruling that required it to refrain from hiring personnel pending further orders of
the Court. Specifically, based on articulated exigent circumstances, Jefferson County requests
that it be permitted to make selections for the positions of clinical nurse practitioner, principal

buyer, chief deputy coroner, chief court clerk and principal court clerk. By order dated January
Case 2:75-cv-00666-CLS Document1770 Filed 01/28/13 Page 2 of 3

25, 2013, this Court required plaintiffs to respond to the motion on or before February 8, 2013.

The County seeks authorization to follow its established procedures for recalling principal
buyers from its layoff list and for requesting that the Jefferson County Personnel Board develop
lists of eligibles for the positions of deputy coroner and chief court clerk. The United States does
not oppose the County's proposed actions.

With regard to the clinical nurse practitioner position, the County proposes to select from
the qualified individuals on the certificate of eligibles for those positions. The Martin Bryant
parties indicated by email dated January 22 that they do not object to the County's proposal; the

United States also does not oppose the County's selection proposal.
