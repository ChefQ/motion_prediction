MOTION FOR ORDER
Comes now the Defendant Jefferson County in the above styled cause
and requests that this Honorable Court issue an Order modifying its previous
ruling which required the Defendant to refrain from hiring personnel pending
further orders from the Court. As grounds for said motion the Defendant
avers the following:
At the conclusion of the hearing on the Martin Bryant Parties’ motion to
hold the Defendant Jefferson County in contempt, this Honorable Court
ordered the parties to get together with the assistance of the Court’s Special
Master John Veres to develop a proposed temporary order with regard to the
Defendant’s hiring of personnel until such time as the Court drafted its final
order in this matter. While the parties have diligently worked toward the
drafting of a proposed interim order the Defendant has experienced
emergency circumstances which necessitate the replacement and hiring of
personnel in order for the County to function effectively and in accordance
with various mandates relative to medical staff in its newly established
outpatient care facility. The Defendant has corresponded with the parties to
this litigation and made them aware of the Defendant’s immediate needs.
See Exhibit A attached hereto. Although the parties have not presented a

proposed interim order to the Court for all anticipated hires that the Defendant

Board. Selection method to be agreed upon by the parties
and the Court’s Special Master.
4.

made from the list of eligibles once created by the Jefferson
County Personnel Board. Selection method to be agreed
upon by the parties and the Court’s Special Master.
