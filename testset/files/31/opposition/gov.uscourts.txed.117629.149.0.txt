PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ EMERGENCY MOTION TO EXTEND
DEADLINES FOR DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSES TO
MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
COMES NOW, Plaintiff, VocalSpace, LLC, (“Plaintiff” or “VocalSpace”), and files this
Response to Defendants’ Emergency Motion to Extend Deadlines for Defendants’ Responses to
Motions for Summary Judgment (“Motion”), and in support thereof, respectfully shows the
Court the following:
I. INTRODUCTION
Defendants’ Request should be denied. It is nothing but a delay tactic to cover for
Defendants’ lack of diligence in responding to summary judgment. As explained more fully
below, Defendants cannot come close to showing any good cause for an extension. Defendants
clearly had ample time to prepare responses to Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment, as
Defendants have been in receipt of Plaintiff’s pleadings since November 5, 2010.

While

Defendants attempt to blame their lack of diligence on irrelevant factors such as Defendants’
holiday travel plans, it is apparent that Defendants’ delay is simply a product of unpreparedness.

Plaintiff has been under the same deadlines as Defendants and struggled to respond on time in
proximity to the holidays, yet Plaintiff complied with this Court’s Scheduling Order.
Adjourning the due date for Defendants’ response and maintaining the same period for
Plaintiff to file a reply and Defendants to file a surreply would put Plaintiff in a position of
having to incur the significant expense and time associated with preparation for trial before
knowing what, if any, case is to be tried. That unfair expense and prejudice is not warranted,
particularly given the fact that it was Defendants who requested a deadline of December 31,
2010 and not Plaintiff. In addition, and contrary to the representations in Defendants’ Motion,
the issues raised in Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment are not particularly complex, nor
do they require a deep examination of the factual record in this case. Rather, they are legal
arguments, predominantly addressed to the lack of an executed written agreement between the
parties. No matter how voluminous the record, that key issue is susceptible to a focused
response by Defendants and expeditious resolution by the Court. As such, Defendants’ argument
that preparing responses to summary judgment is an unexpected, “daunting task” is far from
sufficient for the Court to now, so close to trial, grant Defendants an extension of time. Thus, the
Court should deny Defendants’ Motion and should strike Defendants’ unduly late response to
Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment.
II. RELEVANT FACTS
On December 6, 2010, the Court entered its most recent, and currently controlling,
Scheduling Order. (Doc. No. 124). Pursuant to this Order, the deadline for filing responses to
all summary judgment motions was December 28, 2010. Id., at ¶ 1. On December 23, 2010,
counsel for Defendants contacted Plaintiff’s counsel and asked that Plaintiff agree to move the

deadline for filing responses to all summary judgment motions to December 31, 2010. The
proposed deadline of December 31, 2010 was suggested by Defendants’ counsel. Despite the
fact that December 31, 2010 was a federal holiday and New Years’ Eve, – a fact which
Defendants attempt to now use to their advantage in their current Motion, – Plaintiff’s counsel
agreed to Defendants’ requested extension. Despite the fact that Defendants counsel suggested
the current deadline, Defendants are now asking the Court for yet another extension. In fact,
Defendants’ counsel stated to Plaintiff’s counsel that he would like the requested extension so
that he could “celebrate the new year.”
Furthermore, Defendants did not even file its responses on the requested deadline of
January 2. One filing was completed at 12:05 a.m. on the morning of January 3rd, and the other
was completed at 2:00 a.m. on the morning of the 3rd. There is simply no excuse for Defendants’
failure to timely file its responses other than lack of diligence.
III. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
A.

Pursuant To The Rules, An Extension Should Be Denied.
Pursuant to Rule 6(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court can

extend time only upon a showing of good cause. See FED. R. CIV. P. 6(b)(1)(A); see also FED. R.
CIV. P. 16(b) (providing that, once a scheduling order has been entered, it “may be modified only
for good cause and with the judge’s consent.”). A party seeking an extension must show “that
the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party needing the extension.”
Marathon Financial Ins., Inc., RRG v. Ford Motor Co., 591 F.3d 458, 470 (5th Cir. 2009);
Fahim v. Marriott Hotel Services, Inc., 551 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir. 2008).

In addition, Rule 6(b)(1) provides that the Court may, for good cause, extend the time
“on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable
neglect.” FED. R. CIV. P. 6(b)(1). However, “[e]ven if good cause and excusable neglect are
shown, it nonetheless remains a question of the court’s discretion whether to grant any motion to
extend time under Rule 6(b).” McCarty v. Thaler, 376 Fed. Appx. 442, 443 (5th Cir. 2010)
(citing Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 894-98 (1990)). In determining whether
there has been excusable neglect, the Court should consider the following nonexclusive factors:
(1) the danger of prejudice to the non-movant; (2) the length of the delay and its potential impact
on judicial proceedings; (3) the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the
reasonable control of the movant; and (4) whether the movant acted in good faith. See Pioneer
Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P’ship, 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993); see also Adams v.
Travelers Indem. Co. of Conn., 465 F.3d 156, 161 n. 8 (5th Cir. 2006).
B.

Defendants Have Not Shown Good Cause or Excusable Neglect for an Extension.
Defendants are unable to show good cause for extending the deadline to respond to

Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment.

Defendants clearly had ample time to prepare

responses to Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment. Defendants have been in receipt of
Plaintiff’s pleadings since November 5, 2010. There is no excuse for Defendants waiting until
essentially the last minute to prepare its responses. Defendants, like counsel for Plaintiff, should
have known that preparing the responses to summary judgment was a time consuming task
weeks ago. Plaintiff struggled to respond on time, yet completed the task, as required by the
Rules and this Court. Therefore, allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust, and Defendants
should not be permitted to bypass the deadline due to their own lack of diligence.

In addition, Defendants’ actions are not “excusable neglect.” First, Plaintiff will be
highly prejudiced by an extension of the due date for Defendants’ response because this would
put Plaintiff in a position of having to incur the significant expense and time associated with
preparation for trial before knowing what, if any, case is to be tried. Second, the length of the
delay will significantly impact this case, as the deadlines Defendants are now requesting would
result in unnecessary and time-consuming motions practice just two weeks before the start of
trial. Third, the reasoning for delay provided by Defendants’ in their Motion proves that their
delay was well within the reasonable control of Defendants. Counsel for Defendants could and
should have been more prepared, as was counsel for Plaintiff, to file their responses on
December 31, 2010 – especially in light of the fact that Defendants requested this specific date
as the deadline for filing responses to summary judgment motions. Finally, it does not appear
that Defendants have brought their Motion in good faith, as they were well aware that December
31, 2010 was New Years’ Eve. To that end, the argument made by Defendants in their Motion
that the Christmas holidays and Defendant Lorenso’s travel plans inhibited their preparation for
filing responses to Plaintiff’s summary judgment motions are simply irrelevant. Therefore,
Defendants are unable to show good cause or excusable neglect, and Plaintiff should not be
prejudiced by Defendants’ inexcusable delay.
C.

Defendants Late Response, if Any, Should be Stricken.
It is well established that when pleadings are filed outside the time period required in a

Court’s motions deadline, the late pleadings will be stricken. See, e.g., QT Trading, LP v. M/V
Saga Morus, No Civ. A. 4:09-702, 2010 WL 2573206 (June 22, 2010, S.D. Tex.) (finding no
showing of good cause and therefore striking the untimely pleading). The responses filed by

Defendants on January 3, 2011 are, as explained above, unjustifiably delayed responses.
Therefore, the Court should strike the responses.
III.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Defendants’ Motion to Extend
Deadlines for Defendants’ Responses to Motions for Summary Judgment and should strike
Defendants’ unduly late responses to Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment.
