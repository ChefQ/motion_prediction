Filed 11/05/10 Page 5 of 24

(Contains References to Highly Confidential Material)
VocalSpace LLC (“VocalSpace”) files this Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on
Plaintiff’s Claims and shows as follows:
I. Statement of the Issues
VocalSpace contends, inter alia, that Defendants Daniel D. Lorenso and Larkspark
Corporation (“Defendants”) have and are infringing its copyrighted work in VocalSpace’s
copyrighted computer source code (the “Copyrighted Code”) through Defendants’ computer
source code (the “Accused Code”). VocalSpace further contends that Defendants have
misappropriated VocalSpace trade secrets. VocalSpace also contends that Defendants have
breached a fiduciary duty, violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and violated the Texas
Theft Liability Act. VocalSpace seeks partial summary judgment against Defendants. More
particularly, there is sufficient summary judgment evidence to conclude, as a matter of law, that:
(1)

Defendants willfully infringed the Copyrighted Code.

(2)

Defendants misappropriated the trade secrets of VocalSpace.

(3)

Defendants breached a fiduciary duty owed to VocalSpace.

(4)

Defendants violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

(5)

Defendants violated the Texas Theft Liability Act.

Therefore, VocalSpace is entitled to a summary judgment on these issues.
II. Statement of Undisputed Material Facts
The following material facts are not in dispute:
(1)

On or about July 14, 2009, VocalSpace filed an application for a copyright
registration. This application included deposit material consisting of the first 25
and last 25 pages of a concatenation of the Copyrighted Code. Exhibit B1 is a true
and correct copy of this application and deposit material. Declaration of Randy
Dryburgh “Decl. Dryburgh” ¶ 3, attached hereto as Exhibit B.

(2)

Thereafter, the Copyright Office issued evidence of registration of the Copyright
Registration Certificate TXu001607950. Exhibit B2 is a true and correct copy of
this evidence. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 4.

(3)

Defendant Daniel D. Lorenso was an employee of VocalSpace (or its predecessor)
from March of 2003 through August of 2006. Deposition of Dante Lorenso
(“Dep. Lorenso”) 11:23-12:1, attached hereto as Exhibit D. Mr. Lorenso was an
independent contractor of VocalSpace from January 2007 through June of 2008.
Dep. Lorenso 36:7-14. During both of these time frames, Defendant Lorenso had
access to proprietary VocalSpace source code. Dep. Lorenso 100:11-19, 162:23163:13; 36:7-19; Original Answer ¶110; Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 5. During the later
time frame, this proprietary VocalSpace source code included the Copyrighted
Code. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 5.

(4)

Exhibit C1 is a true and correct copy of a printout of the file “UserDir.php” found
on a DVD of source code produced by Defendants. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 6.

(5)

Exhibit C2 is a true and correct copy of a printout of the file “UserDir.php” found
in the Copyrighted Code. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 7.

(6)

On October 4, 2010, VocalSpace served the expert report of Dr. Ben Laws on
Defendants. Exhibit A1 is a true and correct copy of this expert report. Decl.
Laws ¶4. Defendants’ rebuttal expert report was due on October 18, 2010, but
Defendants chose not to serve any rebuttal expert report.

(7)

During Defendant Lorenso’s relationship with VocalSpace, its confidential, trade
secret information, including it proprietary source code, was not known to any
persons outside of the company. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 8.

(8)

Access to the confidential, trade secret information was restricted to only those
necessary to maintain the operations of the business, and those employees who do
not need access to the information to maintain business operations are excluded.
Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 9.

(9)

VocalSpace kept its servers containing the confidential, trade secret information
in a locked cage in a secure facility, and access to the servers was restricted by a
firewall. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 10.

(10)

VocalSpace’s server logins were password protected, and server communications
were encrypted. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 11.

(11)

The VocalSpace office housing confidential information has a monitored alarm
system. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 11.

(12)

Lorenso had access to a substantial amount of VocalSpace’s confidential,
proprietary, and trade secret information in his position as a lead programmer.
Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 20. Lorenso occupied positions of extreme sensitivity within
VocalSpace and VocalSpace reposed significant trust and confidence in Lorenso.
Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 20.

(13)

VocalSpace’s confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information that Lorenso
had access to is not generally known outside of VocalSpace, and because this
information has great value to VocalSpace and its competitors, measures must be
taken to insure that such information remains confidential. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 21.
Lorenso was treated as a fiduciary, and a great deal of trust was placed in him.
Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 21.

VocalSpace invested over $1 Million to develop its confidential, trade secret
information, including paying Defendant Lorenso over $600,000 to assist in
building the working code for VocalSpace’s products. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 13.

(15)

VocalSpace requires its employees to acknowledge “Conflict of Interest
Guidelines,” which, among other things, state:
Revealing confidential information to outsiders or misusing confidential
information. Unauthorized divulging of information is a violation of this
policy whether or not for personal gain and whether or not harm to the
Company is intended.

These guidelines were provided to Defendant Lorenso by VocalSpace’s
predecessor-in-interest, Direct2Prospect. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 15.
III. Legal Standards

A.

Legal Standard for Summary Judgment

The purpose of summary judgment is to “pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in
order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial”. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith
Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct 1348, 1356 (1986. Summary judgment procedure is
designed to isolate and dispose of factually-unsupported claims or defenses, and so a court may
properly grant summary judgment in any case where the pleadings, discovery products on file,
and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986).
A plaintiff that seeks summary judgment must show that there are no genuine issues of
material fact and establish each element of its claim as a matter of law. Fontenot v. Upjohn Co.
780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir. 1986). The court should grant the plaintiff’s motion only if,
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, there are no genuine issues of

Case 4:09-cv-00350-ALM Document 101

material fact and no jury could find in favor of the defendant. Chlorine Inst., Inc. v. California
Highway Patrol, 29 F.3d 495, 496 (9th Cir. 1994). A plaintiff may also show that there are no
genuine issues for trial regarding a defendant’s defenses by pointing out the absence of evidence
supporting those defenses. See Duffy v. Leading Edge Products, Inc., 44 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.
1995). Once the plaintiff meets this burden, the defendant must come forward with summary
judgment evidence establishing the existence of a genuine issue; that evidence must be such that
if introduced at trial it would suffice to prevent a directed verdict against the defendant. Id.
Although this Court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving
party, conclusory allegations unsupported by concrete and particular facts will not prevent an
award of summary judgment. Id. The mere existence of some disputed fact will not defeat an
otherwise properly-supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no
genuine issue of material fact. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S.Ct.
2505, 2510-11 (1986).
B.

Legal Standard for Copyright Infringement

The Copyright Act gives the owner of a copyright a number of exclusive rights to the
copyrighted work, including the right to reproduce the work, to prepare derivative works, to
distribute copies of the work, and to perform the work publically. 17 U.S.C. §106. To establish a
prima facie case of copyright infringement, a copyright owner must prove (1) ownership of a
valid copyright, and (2) copying by the defendant of constituent elements of the work that are
original. Feist Publications Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 111 S.Ct, 1296 (1991). A certificate of
registration, if timely obtained, is prima facie evidence both that a copyright is valid and that the
registrant owns the copyright. General Universal Systems Inc. v. Lee, 379 F.3d 131, 141 (5th Cir.
2004). To prove actionable copying under the second prong, a plaintiff must prove that the
defendant actually used the copyrighted material to create his own work. Id. A plaintiff may

Case 4:09-cv-00350-ALM Document 101

(Contains References to Highly Confidential Material)
make this showing either with proof of direct evidence of copying or through circumstantial
evidence demonstrating both (1) that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and (2)
that the two works are probatively similar. Id. The access element is satisfied if the defendant
had a reasonable opportunity to view the copyrighted work, and the probative similarity element
requires a showing that the works, when compared as a whole, are adequately similar to establish
appropriation. Id. Infringement is willful if the Defendant had knowledge that his conduct
represented infringement or recklessly disregarded the possibility that his conduct might
constitute infringement. Controversy Music v. Down Under Pub Tyler Inc., 488 F.Supp.2d 572,
578 (E.D.Tex. 2007).
The Copyrighted Code is described on the face of the copyright registration as a
“computer program.” Exh. B2. Under the Copyright Act, a “computer program” is defined as a
“set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring
about a certain result.” 17 U.S.C. §101. It is settled that computer programs are entitled to
copyright protection. General Universal Systems Inc. v. Lee, 379 F.3d 131, 142 (5th Cir. 2004).
This protection applies both to the literal elements of the source code as well as the non-literal
elements, including structure, sequence, organization, user interface, screen displays, and menu
structures. Id. at 142. Copyright protection extends only to the expression within the source code,
not the abstract ideas, processes, facts, elements dictated by considerations of efficiency,
elements required by factors external to the program itself, or items taken from the public
domain. Id. at 142-143.
C.

Legal Standard for Misappropriation of Trade Secrets

Trade secrets are rights in the nature of property rights which the law protects through
both tort and contract principles. IBP Inc. v. Klumpe, 101 S.W.3d 461, 472 (Tex.App.—Amarillo
2001). Generally, such principles provide that one who either discloses or uses another’s trade

(Contains References to Highly Confidential Material)
secret, without a privilege to do so, is liable for such disclosure or use if the disclosure or use
constitutes a breach of confidence reposed in the party disclosing or using the trade secret by the
owner of the trade secret. Id. To be actionable, the disclosure or use of the trade secret ordinarily
must be to the competitive disadvantage of the owner of the trade secret. Id. To determine the
existence of a trade secret, the court should consider six relevant but nonexclusive criteria: (1)
the extent to which the information is known outside the business, (2) the extent to which it is
known by employees and others involved in the business, (3) the extent of measures taken to
safeguard the secrecy of the information, (4) the value of the information to him and to his
competitors, (5) the amount of effort or money expended in developing the information, and (6)
the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by
others. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 739-40 (Tex. 2003). A trade secret action is not preempted
by the Copyright Act as the former requires a breach of trust or confidence not found in the cause
of action for copyright infringement. See 17 U.S.C. §301(b) (“Nothing in this title annuls or
limits any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any state with respect to ... (3)
activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights
within the general scope of copyright as specified by sec. 106.”); Spectrum Creations L.P. v.
Carolyn Kinder Intern. LLC, 514 F.Supp.2d 934 (W.D.Tex. 2007) (trade secret cause of action
not preempted by Copyright Act because of additional requirements of trade secret claim).
IV. Argument
A.

Copyright Infringement

While granting summary judgment of copyright infringement based on substantial
similarity is typically viewed as something to be left to the ultimate factfinder, e.g., General
Universal Systems, 379 F.3d 142, here, there remain no unresolved questions of any material
fact, including the question of substantial similarity. Specifically, Defendants have admitted that

Case 4:09-cv-00350-ALM Document 101

(Contains References to Highly Confidential Material)
the Accused Code contains elements of the Copyrighted Code, and the Defendants have admitted
that these elements represent the creative expression of the author. Further, in the report of
VocalSpace’s expert Dr. Ben Laws, which has been incorporated into Dr. Laws declaration (Exh.
A1), Dr. Laws, a 45+ year veteran of software design and development, listed a plethora of
examples where the Accused Code contained similar creative expression found in the
Copyrighted Code.
1.

Defendants have admitted substantial similarity between the Accused
Code and the Copyrighted Code.

During his deposition (individually and as corporate representative), Mr. Lorenso was
questioned regarding source code generally and comparisons between the Accused Code and
Copyrighted Code in particular. Mr. Lorenso unequivocally testified that source code may
contain creative expression that goes beyond mere idea or process. This creative expression
includes the choice of text used in non-functional program comments:

Do you see the two slashes at the beginning of that line?
Yes.
Okay. That indicates a comment, right?
Correct.
And the rest of that line is a string of dashes, correct?
Uh-huh.
Now, what's the purpose of the string of dashes?
I like them.
Okay. So is it fair to say that's another programmer's choice thing, you like
them, so that's why they're there?
Yes.
Okay. Now, so if we look at Lines 49, 59, 69, 13:42 24 89, and 127, we see lines
beginning with the two slashes followed by a string of dashes, right?
That is correct.
And are they also there because you like them?
That's true.
Okay. And is there any other purpose?
No.
That's just kind of your artistic expression -Uh-huh.
Okay. Now, does the PHP Interpreter execute comments like Line 16?

It should not execute them, no.
Right. Does it do any error checking to make sure that the comments are accurate,
like the one on Line 16?
There can be characters in the comments that would cause the PHP Interpreter to
fail, but it doesn't necessarily scan them normally, no.
Right. So -- so that comment could read something like try to erase the user
subdirectory, right, and the program could still run the same?
Yes.
Okay. And it wouldn't make a bit of difference to the PHP Interpreter if there
were no comments at all, right?
It might actually be a little bit faster if there were not comments at all -All right. So it would –
-- slightly.
-- be faster, but it would -- but -- so would it almost in a lot of ways make the
program run faster, but not materially affect the program, correct?
It should not, no.
All right. Who chooses the words of a comment?
The author.
Okay. So that's basically the -- another part of the artistic expression of the
author, what to put in the comment, right?
Okay. Yes.

Dep. Lorenso 390:8-391:8, 392:15-393:14, (emphasis added).
Similarly, Mr. Lorenso testified that this creative expression includes the choice of text
used in an error message, Dep. Lorenso 398:7-399:22, and that this creative expression includes
the choice of function and variable names. Id. 396:19-398:3; See also Original Answer ¶14
(Defendants admit that computer source code is copyrightable expression).
Later in the deposition, Mr. Lorenso was asked to compare the creative expression
identified in the Accused Code with similar expression in the Copyrighted Code. Mr. Lorenso
agreed that Defendants’ Code contained comments that were identical or virtually identical to
comments found in the Copyrighted Code:
Q.
A.

…Now, look at the comments in front of the function get user sub DIR file at
lines -- if you look at E, at Lines 6 through 10, 6 through 10 of Exhibit E.
Okay.

Now, do you see those comments? In fact, what do they say? Assemble parts of
the file name based on the user subdirectory to form the absolute path on disk
without verification. Did I read that right?
Okay.
Okay. You see that. Now, let's look at the comments -- if we go over to Exhibit
D, let's look at -- so pull Exhibit D. Tell me when you have that in front of you.
Okay.
Now, look at the comments in front of the function get sub DIR files at Lines 59
through 63.
(Witness complies.)
Are you there?
Uh-huh.
And if we look at that, it says, Assemble parts of the file name based on the user's
subdirectory to form the absolute path on disk without verification. Did I read that
right?
Okay.
They're identical comments, correct?
Yeah.

Dep. Lorenso 403:8-404:9 (emphasis added).
Mr. Lorenso went on to confirm that other comments found in the Defendants’ Code
were also found in the Copyrighted Code. Dep. Lorenso 404:10-405:20 (comments at lines 1721); Id. 405:21-407:6 (comments at lines 28-32); Id. 407:7-408:10 (comments at lines 34, 39, 45,
51, and 56); Id. 408:11-409:16 (comments at lines 60-63). Similarly, Mr. Lorenso was asked to
compare the text strings in the error messages at lines 42 and 53 of the Defendants’ Code with
the text strings in the error messages found in the Copyrighted Code; upon comparison, he
concluded “the strings themselves are identical.” Dep. Lorenso 409:17-411:20. Similarly, Mr.
Lorenso agreed that the Accused Code contained functions that bore names that were similar to
function names found in the Copyrighted Code. Dep. Lorenso 402:25-403:6.
In short, Defendants have agreed that the Accused Code contains expressive content that
is not only substantially similar, but virtually identical to the expressive content found in the
Copyright Code. Therefore, there is no question of material fact remaining for the jury to
consider, and summary judgment on this issue is appropriate.

Dr Laws found substantial similarity between the Accused Code and
the Copyrighted Code.

Dr. Ben Laws opined that certain elements of source code, including its structure and
layout, the selection of text for user messages, and the inclusion of embedded comments,
evidence expressive content that is unnecessary for the function of the code itself. Decl. Laws
§2.2, §4.1.1. As noted supra, Defendants agree with Dr. Laws on this subject. Dr. Laws
examined dozens of files from the Accused Code and compared the expressive content from
those files with the Copyrighted Code. Id. §4.1.1. By way of example, Dr. Laws compared two
files, both named “FLVTools.php,” found in the Accused Code and Copyrighted Code. He found
substantially similar comments (including a doubled “the” and a misspelled “begining”),
substantially similar instruction format, and substantially similar sequence of instructions. Id.
§4.1.1. This substantial similarity is readily apparent to the casual observer:
VocalSpace Code
//---------------------------------------------------------------------/* Read the duration in seconds of an FLV file using hackery. We seek
* the the end of the FLV file and read the last 'tag' packet. The
* offset marked on that packet is the offset we use for the entire
* stream.
* I haven't found any examples of where this isn't good enough --dante
*/
public static function get_duration($file_name) {
// open the file for reading or bail
$fp = fopen($file_name, 'r');
if (!$fp) {
return (0);
}

Defendants’ Code
//---------------------------------------------------------------------/**

* the end of the FLV file and read the last 'tag' packet. The offset

public static function get_duration($file_name) {
// open the file for reading or bail
$fp = fopen($file_name, 'r');
if (!$fp) {
return 0;
}
// read the size of the last packet in the file
// size is stored as the last four bytes at the end of the file
$res = fseek($fp, -4, SEEK_END);
if ($res) {
return 0;
}
$offset = -abs(self :: uintRead($fp, 4) + 4);

// read the size of the last packet in the file
// size is stored as the last four bytes at the end of the file
$res = fseek($fp, -4, SEEK_END);
if ($res) {
return (0);
}
$offset = -abs(self :: ui_read($fp, 4) + 4);

// jump to the begining of the last packet in the file
$res = fseek($fp, $offset, SEEK_END);

// jump to the begining of the last packet in the file
$res = fseek($fp, $offset, SEEK_END);

// parse the last 'tag' packet of the file
$pkt = self :: flvtag_read($fp);
fclose($fp);

// parse the last 'tag' packet of the file
$pkt = self :: flvtag_read($fp);
fclose($fp);

}

// use the time offset stamped on the last packet as the time
// for the entire FLV stream
$seconds = Common :: array_get($pkt, 'time') / 1000.0;
return ($seconds);

//-------------------------------------------------------------------

// use the time offset stamped on the last packet as the time
// for the entire FLV stream
$seconds = (isset ($pkt['time']) ? $pkt['time'] : 0) / 1000.0;

Dr. Laws found substantial similarity of expressive content in over 35 different files
within the Accused Code. Decl. §4.1.2.
In short, Dr. Laws has found multiple instances where the Accused Code contains
expressive content that is not only substantially similar, but virtually identical to the expressive
content found in the Copyright Code. Therefore, inasmuch as Defendants have offered no report
by an independent third-party expert rebutting Dr. Laws’ opinions, and in light of Defendants’
admissions regarding the expressive nature of the Accused Code and Copyrighted Code, there is
no question of material fact remaining for the jury to consider, and summary judgment on this
issue is appropriate.
3.

Other facts related to infringement are not in dispute.

As noted supra in §0, there is no dispute regarding the remaining elements for proving
willful copyright infringement by Defendants. First, the existence of the copyright registration is
prima facie evidence both that VocalSpace’s copyright claim is valid and that the VocalSpace
owns the copyright. See General Universal, 379 F.3d at 141. Second, Defendants admitted that,
as of May 2008, Mr. Lorenso had “complete access” to the VocalSpace code. Original Answer
¶110. Inasmuch as the files in the Copyrighted Code are dated between April 2003 to January
2007, Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 5, Mr. Lorenso has therefore admitted to having “complete access” to
the Copyrighted Code. Mr. Lorenso was an employee and later a contractor of VocalSpace, and
so he knew that his actions involved the incorporation of VocalSpace code into the Accused
Code. In fact, Mr. Lorenso identified comments found in both the Copyrighted Code and the
Accused code as his own. Dep. Lorenso 392:7-11.
Therefore, all elements of willful copyright infringement have been proven and there are
no remaining unanswered questions of material fact for the jury to consider, and summary
judgment on this issue is appropriate.

Misappropriation of Trade Secrets

The Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff’s misappropriation of trade
secrets claim because there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendants
misappropriated Plaintiff’s trade secrets. The elements of a misappropriation of trade secrets
claim in Texas are that (1) the plaintiff owned a trade secret; (2) the defendant used or disclosed
the trade secret in violation of a confidential or contractual relationship with the plaintiff, after
acquiring the trade secret by improper means, or after acquiring the trade secret with notice that
disclosure was improper; and (3) the plaintiff suffered injury. K & G Oil Tools & Serv. v. G & G
Fishing Tool Serv., 314 S.W. 2d 782, 787-88 (Tex. 1958); Trilogy Software Inc. v. Callidus
Software, Inc., 143 S.W.3d 452, 463 (Tex. App.—Austin 2004, pet. denied). Further, an
employee has a duty not to use or disclose an employer’s trade-secret information in a manner
adverse to the employer, both during and after employment, if the employee knows or should
realize under the circumstances that the employer wants the information to be kept secret.
American Derringer Corp. v. Bond, 924 S.W.2d 773, 777 (Tex. App.—Waco 1996, no writ).
Each of the elements has been sufficiently established such that the Court must find
misappropriation of Plaintiff’s trade secrets by Defendants as a matter of law.
1.

VocalSpace owned a trade secret.

VocalSpace, owned confidential, trade secret information, including both copyrighted
and non-copyrighted proprietary source code, that was misappropriated by Defendants.
VocalSpace’s confidential, trade secret information was not known to any persons outside of the
company. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 8. In fact, access to the confidential, trade secret information was
restricted to only those necessary to maintain the operations of the business, and those employees
who did not need access to the information to maintain business operations are excluded. Decl.
Dryburgh ¶ 9. Further, VocalSpace went to great lengths to protect its confidential, trade secret

information. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 10. For example, it kept its servers containing the confidential,
trade secret information in a locked cage in a secure facility. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 10. Access to the
servers was restricted by a firewall. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 10. Further, server logins were password
protected, and server communications were encrypted. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 11. Also, the office
housing the information had a monitored alarm system. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 11. VocalSpace’s
confidential, trade secret information was central to operating its business, and the information
was and is—by far—VocalSpace’s most valuable asset. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 12. In light of this,
the confidential, trade secret information was also highly valuable to VocalSpace’s competitors.
Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 12. In fact, VocalSpace invested over $1 Million to develop its confidential,
trade secret information, including paying Defendant Lorenso over $600,000 to assist in building
the working code for VocalSpace’s products. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 13. As such, it would be
extremely unlikely—for all practical purposes, impossible—for another competitor to duplicate
or acquire the confidential, trade secret information. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 14. VocalSpace even
required its employees to acknowledge “Conflict of Interest Guidelines,” which, among other
things, state:
Revealing confidential information to outsiders or misusing confidential
information. Unauthorized divulging of information is a violation of this
policy whether or not for personal gain and whether or not harm to the
Company is intended.
Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 14. These guidelines were provided to Defendant Lorenso by VocalSpace’s
predecessor-in-interest, Direct2Prospect. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 15. Defendant Lorenso initialed and
signed the guidelines on April 7, 2003. Accordingly, VocalSpace certainly maintained
confidential, trade secret information.

2.

Defendants used and disclosed the trade secret information in
violation of their obligations after acquiring it by improper means
with notice that the use and disclosure was improper.

Defendants used and disclosed VocalSpace’s misappropriated trade secret information in
violation of their obligations to VocalSpace. As stated supra in III.A, Defendants have used and
are using VocalSpace’s confidential, trade secret information. Rather than repeat the
descriptions of those uses provided above verbatim, they are incorporated by reference as if fully
set forth herein. Further, Defendant Lorenso has disclosed VocalSpace’s confidential, trade
secret information on his website. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 16. Blatantly disregarding his obligation to
keep VocalSpace’s proprietary information in confidence, Mr. Lorenso went so far as to publish
it on the internet for all to see. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 17. For example, the documents attached as
Exhibit B5, show one posting of trade secret information. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 17. It is readily
apparent that the posted code is substantially identical to VocalSpace’s trade secret code. Decl.
Dryburgh ¶ 17. The changes made are utterly trivial (such as adding the LS Prefix to a few
variable function names). Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 17. Thus, Defendants—without question—used and
disclosed VocalSpace’s trade secret information.
Prior to the improper use and disclosure, Defendants acquired the confidential, trade
secret information in violation of their obligations to VocalSpace. Upon Defendant Lorenso’s
departure from VocalSpace, he was instructed to delete all of VocalSpace’s confidential, trade
secret information from his computers. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 18. Further, in statements to
Defendant Lorenso, it was made explicitly clear that VocalSpace’s code was not to be used in
other non-VocalSpace applications. Decl. Dryburgh ¶ 18. Further, Defendant had an obligation
not to disclose the confidential, trade secret information since he was an employee and
VocalSpace had made it unequivocally clear that it wanted the information to be kept secret.

(Contains References to Highly Confidential Material)
See, e.g, American Derringer, 924 S.W. 2d at 777. Thus, VocalSpace has established, without
question, that Defendants have used and disclosed its misappropriated trade secret information.
3.

VocalSpace suffered injury.

VocalSpace has suffered injury as a result of Defendants’ misappropriation of its trade
secrets. As stated above, VocalSpace invested over $1 million to create its proprietary source
code. VocalSpace has, essentially, been deprived of the benefits of this $1 million investment
because Defendants have misappropriated the proprietary source code and used it to create a
competing business. Furthermore, VocalSpace has been injured because it has lost revenues due
to competition from Defendants using its proprietary source code as also described above. Decl.
Dryburgh ¶ 19. In addition, VocalSpace has been injured because Defendants have used the
trade secret information to mimic VocalSpace in the marketplace. Harm may be established by
evidence that disclosure of confidential information could enable competitors to mimic the
marketing plans and strategies of the applicant and avoid the less successful strategies, resulting
in a “substantial competitive injury.” Thus, the injury element has been satisfied.
Therefore, all elements of misappropriation of trade secrets have been proven and there
are no remaining unanswered questions of material fact for the jury to consider. Summary
judgment on this issue is appropriate.
4.

Breach Of fiduciary duty

The elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) a fiduciary relationship
exists between the plaintiff and the defendant; (2) the defendant breached its fiduciary duty to the
plaintiff, and (3) the defendant's breach resulted in injury to the plaintiff or benefit to the
defendant. Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C., 73 S.W. 3d 193, 199 (Tex. 2002). Here the
evidence has established each of these elements. Therefore, summary judgment should be
granted against Defendants for breach of fiduciary duty.

5.

A fiduciary relationship existed between lorenso and vocalspace

Lorenso had access to a substantial amount of VocalSpace’s confidential, proprietary,
and trade secret information in his position as one of VocalSpace’s lead programmers. Lorenso
occupied positions of extreme sensitivity within VocalSpace and VocalSpace reposed significant
trust and confidence in Lorenso. VocalSpace’s confidential, proprietary, and trade secret
information that Lorenso had access to is not generally known outside of VocalSpace, and
because this information has great value to VocalSpace and its competitors, measures must be
taken to insure that such information remains confidential. As such, Lorenso had a fiduciary
relationship with VocalSpace.
6.

Lorenso breached his fiduciary duty to vocalspace

As set forth above in Sections IV.A and IV.B Lorenso misappropriated VocalSpace’s
trade secrets and used them to engage in a competing business. Rather than repeat those
arguments verbatim, they are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. As such,
Lorenso breached his fiduciary duty to VocalSpace.
7.

VocalSpace has been injured as a result of the breach

As set forth above in Sections IV.A and IV.B Lorenso injured VocalSpace by
misappropriating its trade secrets and engaging in a competing business. Rather than repeat
those arguments verbatim, they are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. As
such, Lorenso’s breach has resulted in injury to VocalSpace.
Accordingly, the evidence establishes all of the elements of breach of fiduciary duty by
Lorenso. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of VocalSpace on this claim is appropriate.
8.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”)

To establish a civil violation under the CFAA, the plaintiff must establish three elements:
1) the knowing “transmission” of a “program, information, code, or command;” 2) the

transmission is “to a protected computer;” and 3) the transmission causes intentional “damage
without authorization.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A) (2000). Furthermore, the definition of the
term ‘exceeds authorized access' from § 1030(e)(6) implies that an employee can violate
employer-placed limits on accessing information stored on the computer and still have
authorization to access that computer. U.S. v. John, 597 F.3d 263, 273 (5th Cir. 2010).
C.

Lorenso knowingly transmitted a program to a protected computer

Lorenso knowingly transmitted program to a protected computer by adding a rule to the
protected VocalSpace servers that allowed him to access them from Larkspark servers. In fact,
Lorenso practically admitted as much in his deposition. He stated:
Q. Did you add a rule to their server that you could access the VocalSpace server from
LarkSpark’s server?
A. I can’t even confirm whether that's true. But it does sound like something I would
have done.
Dep. Lorenso at 271:5-9. Furthermore, Dryburgh found the rule and removed it himself. Decl.
Dryburgh ¶ 22. Thus, evidence establishes that Lorenso knowingly transmitted at program to a
protected computer.
D.

The transmission caused intentional damage without authorization

Lorenso’s addition of the rule to VocalSpace’s servers was intentionally used to cause
damage to VocalSpace without authorization. Lorenso, used the rule to copy VocalSpace’s
protected information to Larkspark’s servers. This is established in Section I above. Further, by
doing so he exceeded any authorization from VocalSpace. Thus, Lorenso violated the computer
fraud and abuse act as a matter of law.
E.

Theft Liability Act

Lorenso is liable under the Texas Theft Liability Act as a matter of law. Pursuant to the
Act “a person who commits theft is liable for the damages resulting from the theft.” TEX. CIV.

PRAC. & REM. CODE § 134.003-134.004 (Vernon 1997). As established above, Defendant’s
have essentially obtained VocalSpace’s code as a result of theft. Furthermore, VocalSpace has
been damaged as a result of the theft. Accordingly, summary judgment against Defendants on
VocalSpace’s Theft Liability Act claim is proper.
