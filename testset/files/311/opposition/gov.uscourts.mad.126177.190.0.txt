Lead Plaintiffs the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi (“MissPERS”)
and Union Asset Management Holding AG (“Union”) (collectively “Lead Plaintiffs”)
respectfully submit this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the State Street Defendants’
Motion for Clarification (Dkt. 178) (“Motion”). For the reasons stated below, the State Street
Defendants’ Motion should be denied.1
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
On August 3, 2011, following more than 250 pages of briefing, two days of oral
argument, and approximately 40 pages of post-argument submissions, Judge Gertner issued a
detailed 71-page opinion and order denying in their entirety Defendants’ motions to dismiss
Lead Plaintiffs’ Complaint. See Dkt. 108 (the “Opinion”) at 3, 44, 45, 69. Judge Gertner’s
Opinion clearly stated that Defendants’ motions were “DENIED,” addressed and rejected
numerous arguments raised by each Defendant, and expressly sustained each of Lead Plaintiffs’
five claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Sections 11, 12(a) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities
Act”). See id. (emphasis in original).
Defendants did not make a motion for reconsideration or for clarification of Judge
Gertner’s Opinion. Instead, the case proceeded into discovery and was ultimately reassigned to
this Court following Judge Gertner’s retirement from the bench. More than seven months later,
the State Street Defendants refused to produce a number of highly relevant documents on the
grounds that certain accounting allegations related to State Street’s Conduits were supposedly
“not addressed” by either Lead Plaintiffs in connection with the motion to dismiss briefing, or in

Action Complaint filed on July 29, 2010 (Dkt 51). All emphases herein are added unless
otherwise indicated.

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 6 of 18

Judge Gertner’s August 3, 2011 Opinion, and therefore Judge Gertner must have intended to
dismiss them (despite clear language in the Opinion to the contrary).

The State Street

Defendants subsequently raised this argument in submissions made to Chief Magistrate Judge
Dein.

On June 26, 2012, following oral argument on these issues, Judge Dein rejected

Defendants’ contentions, stating “I can’t find on this record that it’s been abandoned . . . I am
finding that . . . Judge Gertner’s order denying the motion to dismiss left intact the issues in the
complaint[.]” See June 26 Motion Hearing Transcript (“June 26 Tr.”), at 105, 113:13-18 (Dkt.
177) (emphasis added). On June 27, 2012, Judge Dein issued a written order affirming her
position:
This court has concluded that the plaintiffs’ challenge to State Street’s accounting
relating to consolidation has not been waived based on this court’s reading of
Judge Gertner’s ruling on the motion to dismiss.
“June 27 Order” at 3 (Dkt 172) (emphasis added).2
Now, nearly one year after Judge Gertner’s decision denying their motion to dismiss, the
State Street Defendants have filed what they style a “motion for clarification.” In reality, the
State Street Defendants are not seeking to have Judge Gertner’s Opinion “clarified” – they are
seeking to have it reconsidered and reversed. Indeed, as an “alternate” ground for relief, they
expressly request that the Court revisit the motions to dismiss and “rule on whether Plaintiffs
have plausibly pled a conduit accounting claim.” Motion at 6. As discussed below, the State

2

The State Street Defendants’ assertion that “Magistrate Dein concluded that this issue has not been
submitted to her” is patently false. See Dkt 178, at 1. Defendants submitted this issue to Magistrate
Judge Dein, and she fully addressed – and rejected – their arguments both on the record at oral
argument and in a subsequent written order. See June 26 Tr. at 105, 113; June 27 Order at 3. When
Defendants nonetheless sought permission to bring a formal motion for “clarification,” Judge Dein
merely held that such a motion, if made, must be brought on or before July 26, 2012 (June 27 Order
at 3) and she stated that “Judge O’Toole will either refer it to me or he can decide it on his own.”
June 26 Tr. at 105. Lead Plaintiffs have no objection to this motion being referred to Judge Dein (nor
do they object to it being determined by Judge O’Toole).

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 7 of 18

Street Defendants’ belated effort to reargue their motion to dismiss – which was fully vetted and
decided more than one year ago – is untimely and without merit.
The State Street Defendants’ primary argument is that Judge Gertner was “silent” on the
issue of whether Lead Plaintiffs adequately alleged that State Street failed to follow Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in connection with consolidation of certain offbalance sheet entities called Conduits, and by her supposed “silence,” Judge Gertner intended to
grant their motion to dismiss these allegations. Motion at 3. Defendants are wrong. Judge
Gertner expressly acknowledged that Lead Plaintiffs alleged that “Defendants also violated
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),” and she clearly held that “Defendants’
motion to dismiss the Exchange Act claims concerning the conduits and portfolio is DENIED.”
Opinion at 44 (bold emphasis in original); see also id. at 45 (denying Defendants’ motions to
dismiss Securities Act claims).

In so doing, Judge Gertner implicitly acknowledged that

arguments based on the proper application of GAAP are inherently fact-based and unsuited for
resolution on a motion to dismiss: “‘while State Street insists the asset’s quality did remain high
and the unrealized losses were just an analytical accounting requirement that reflected no true
loss in value, this record does not allow the Court to resolve that disputed fact.’” Id. at 38 & n.12
(quoting Kenney v. State Street Corp., 694 F. Supp. 2d 67, 79 (D. Mass. 2010) (Saris, J.)); see
also id. at 7, n.2 (quoting Kenney, 694 F. Supp. 2d at 76) (‘“it is unclear whether the continued
off-balance sheet treatment of the conduits is an overly aggressive accounting gimmick or a
prudent investment strategy”’). Accord, e.g., In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d
1410 (3d Cir. 1997) (issues of GAAP compliance cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss).
Indeed, there is not a single line anywhere in Judge Gertner’s 71-page opinion that
reasonably can be read as granting any portion of Defendants’ motions to dismiss. Moreover,

3

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 8 of 18

Defendants do not cite a single case that stands for the proposition that a District Court’s
“silence” can be interpreted as granting a defendants’ motion to dismiss – and particularly not
where, as here, the District Court explicitly denied those motions to dismiss in their entirety. In
sum, there is no basis in fact or law for Defendants’ assertion that Judge Gertner intended
(through “silence” or otherwise) to grant any portion of the State Street Defendants’ motion to
dismiss Lead Plaintiffs’ Complaint, and their attempts to have this Court “interpret” her Opinion
as doing so is blatant revisionism.
Defendants reveal the true nature of their motion in their “alternate” request that this
Court revisit the motions to dismiss and reverse Judge Gertner’s Opinion. Motion at 6-7. This is
baseless. Defendants elected not to make a motion for reconsideration while Judge Gertner was
on the bench, and their motion now is untimely and without merit.

Any motion for

reconsideration was required to be filed no later than August 31, 2011. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).
Thus, Defendants’ motion is 324 days overdue and should be denied for this reason alone.
Moreover, as discussed in more detail below, even if Defendants’ motion for reconsideration
were timely-filed it should be denied because Defendants do not even attempt to “clearly
establish a manifest error of law,” nor do they present any intervening law or “newly discovered
evidence.” Marks 3 Zet-Ernst Marks GmBh & Co. KG v. Presstek, Inc., 455 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.
2006).3
ARGUMENT

3

Finally, Defendants’ claim that a resolution of this motion is necessary because it will impact
an ongoing discovery dispute between the parties is without merit. Motion at 1, 4. As Lead
Plaintiffs have indicated in connection with the discovery dispute currently before Magistrate
Judge Dein, the requested documents are relevant and responsive to allegations in the Complaint
that were indisputably sustained. See Dkt. 174 & 181. As a result, contrary to Defendants’
assertions, this Motion will have no impact on the scope of discovery.

I.

As Judge Dein Has Already Determined, the August 3, 2011 Opinion Denied the
State Street Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss In Its Entirety And Did Not Dismiss Any
Aspect of Lead Plaintiffs’ Complaint
As discussed above, on August 3, 2011, after considering hundreds of pages of briefing,

two days of oral argument, and extensive post-argument submissions, Judge Gertner issued a 71page opinion and order that expressly “DENIED” Defendants’ motions to dismiss in their
entirety. Opinion at 3, 44, 45, 69 (emphases in original). Judge Gertner did not dismiss any
paragraphs from the Complaint, did not dismiss any of the alleged false statements, and did not
dismiss any of the claims alleged – indeed, as referenced above, there is not a single line in Judge
Gertner’s Opinion that reasonably can be interpreted as dismissing any portion of Lead
Plaintiffs’ Complaint.

Nonetheless, in their motion for “clarification,” the State Street

Defendants ask this Court to hold that Judge Gertner’s supposed “silence” meant that she
intended to grant their motion to dismiss Lead Plaintiffs’ allegations that Defendants violated
GAAP in connection with accounting for consolidation of State Street’s Conduits.4 Motion at 3
(“She may have understood that Plaintiffs had abandoned and were no longer pursuing a conduit
accounting claim; or she may have overlooked the issue.”). This is preposterous.
It is well-established that a court “is not required to delineate every reason for the
decisions it makes; it is in the Court’s discretion to respond specifically-or-not to arguments
made by the parties.” See Devinsky v. Kingsford, 05 Civ. 2064 (PAC), 2008 WL 2704338, at *3
(S.D.N.Y. July 10, 2008). As the Supreme Court has stated:

4

Defendants characterize the Complaint’s GAAP allegations as “claims” in both their June 20,
2012 letter brief and in their Motion. However, allegations that the State Street Defendants’
accounting for the conduits violated GAAP by not requiring consolidation prior to May 18, 2009
(¶¶208-219) do not constitute a unique claim, but, rather, are part of the allegations supporting
Lead Plaintiffs’ Exchange Act claims, and, by natural extension, their Securities Act claims. The
Court sustained each of the five claims alleged in the Complaint, and in doing so, directly
sustained all of those claims’ supporting allegations.
5

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 10 of 18

Sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not;
sometimes a judge simply writes the word “granted,” or “denied” on the face of a
motion while relying upon context and the parties’ prior arguments to make the
reasons clear. The law leaves much, in this respect, to the judge’s own
professional judgment.
Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 338 (2007). There is no basis to claim that merely because
Judge Gertner did not expressly address an argument made by Defendants in their motions to
dismiss that Defendants must have prevailed on that argument. The contrary inference – that
Judge Gertner rejected the State Street Defendants’ arguments when she clearly sustained each
claim in the Complaint and denied their motion to dismiss in its entirety – is far more plausible.
This is particularly true here given the plain language of Judge Gertner’s Opinion, which
makes clear that Defendants motions to dismiss were denied in their entirety. Opinion at 44.
(“Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Exchange Act claims concerning the conduits and portfolio
is DENIED.”) (bold emphasis in original); id. at 69 (“For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’
Motions to Dismiss the Securities Action . . . are DENIED.”) (bold emphasis in original).
Moreover, the Court specifically noted the continued existence of Lead Plaintiffs’ GAAP
allegations:
The Securities Action Plaintiffs . . . allege that [Defendants] violated the
Exchange Act by making false and misleading statements concerning both their
FX trading business and the debt securities contained in State Street’s investment
portfolio and four asset-backed commercial paper conduits. In so doing, Plaintiffs
claim, Defendants also violated generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”).
Id. at 16. The Court also quoted with approval Judge Saris’ denial of defendants’ similar
arguments alleged in the coordinated action Kenney, 694 F. Supp. 2d at 79, noting that
arguments relating to accounting-related issues were highly fact-specific: “While State Street
insists the assets’ quality did remain high and the unrealized losses were just an analytical
accounting requirement that reflected no true loss in value, this record does not allow the Court
6

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 11 of 18

to resolve that disputed fact.” Opinion at 38 & n.12. See also id. at 7, n.2 (“The financial
models ‘used to determine when and whether to consolidate their assets and liabilities onto State
Street's balance sheet are not well explained,’ and it is ‘unclear whether the continued offbalance sheet treatment of conduits is an overly aggressive accounting gimmick or a prudent
investment strategy’.”) (quoting Kenney, 694 F. Supp. 2d at 76).
Moreover, the Court’s rejection of the State Street Defendants’ GAAP argument is
entirely consistent with prevailing law applied by courts throughout the country, which routinely
hold that defendants’ fact-based challenges to GAAP allegations are improper on a motion to
dismiss. See Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1421 (reversing 12(b)(6) dismissal because “it is a factual
question whether [the company’s] accounting practices were consistent with GAAP”); In re
Ambac Fin. Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., 693 F. Supp. 2d 241, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (issues of GAAP
compliance “cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss”); In re Global Crossing Ltd. Sec. Litig.,
322 F. Supp. 2d 319, 338-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (finding sufficiency of allegations of GAAP
violations “cannot be determined in advance of development of the record”). S.E.C. v. Caserta,
75 F. Supp. 2d 79, 91 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (“Whether GAAP has been violated is a fact-specific
issue.”).
For all of these reasons, the State Street Defendants’ assertion that Judge Gertner’s
“silence” should be read as granting a portion of their motion to dismiss is fanciful. Indeed, this
is precisely the conclusion that Judge Dein reached when the State Street Defendants raised this
argument with her (and did so citing exactly the same cases). See June 26 Tr. at 105 (“I can’t
find on this record that it’s been abandoned. I have that Judge Gertner addresses it and I have
that she denied a motion to dismiss. So what I, based on what I have is I still have all the
allegations of the complaint still being in the case.”); id. at 113 (“I am finding that based on the

7

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 12 of 18

record that I have it has not been waived, okay. That Judge Gertner’s order denying the motion
to dismiss left intact the issues in the complaint for whatever reason.). See also June 27 Order at
3 (“This court has concluded that the plaintiffs’ challenge to State Street’s accounting relating to
consolidation has not been waived based on this court’s reading of Judge Gertner’s ruling on the
motion to dismiss.”).5
Finally, it is telling that the State Street Defendants do not cite a single case that supports
their position. See Mot. at 4-5. In each of the five cases cited by Defendants, the district court
that decided the motions to dismiss clearly held that certain claims had been abandoned, and
noted its reasons for dismissing those claims. For example, in Adams v. N.Y. State Educ. Dept.,
the district court found that there were “fatal errors” in plaintiffs’ briefs responding to
defendants’ motion to dismiss in which they only “rhetorically touch[ed] upon legal points
germane to Plaintiffs’ claims.” 752 F. Supp. 2d 420, 426 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). Specifically, the
plaintiffs failed to address defendants’ attacks on their First Amendment claims, and plaintiffs’
counsel conceded at oral argument that “the Court could, and should” dismiss those claims. Id.
at 461 & n. 48. As a result, the district court clearly held that the First Amendment claims were
dismissed. Id. In Markert v. PNC Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., in response to defendants’ motion to

5

Indeed, the State Street Defendants’ contention that Lead Plaintiffs “abandoned” their GAAP
allegations in connection with motion to dismiss briefing is clearly wrong. In their opposition to
the State Street Defendants’ highly fact specific motion to dismiss argument that the timing of
State Street’s consolidation of the Conduit assets in May 2009 was appropriate under what State
Street itself called a “complex accounting judgment” (Dkt. 70 at 42-45), Lead Plaintiffs stated
that “Defendants’ arguments regarding the Conduits and investment portfolio are as highly factbased as their arguments about the foreign exchange fraud” (Dkt. 79 at 6). Moreover, as Judge
Gertner acknowledged, Lead Plaintiffs directly addressed the facts supporting the accounting
allegations that Defendants knew of the declining value of the Conduit assets while publicly
touting the high quality of these assets and the low risk of consolidation. See Dkt. 79 at 25-29;
46-48; 68-70; 82. It is telling that Defendants did not raise either the GAAP allegations or Lead
Plaintiffs’ purported “abandonment” of those allegations before Judge Gertner during two days
of oral argument, nor did the Court request argument on these issues.
8

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 13 of 18

dismiss certain state law claims, plaintiffs, rather than oppose that motion, moved for leave to
file an amended complaint that omitted those claims. 828 F. Supp. 2d 765, 772-73 (E.D. Pa.
2011). In its opinion, the district court clearly held that the state law claims were dismissed
because of plaintiffs’ omission of those claims in its amended complaint. Id. at 773.6
II.

The State Street Defendants’ Request That This Court Reconsider and Reverse
Judge Gertner’s August 3, 2011 Opinion is Baseless and Untimely
The State Street Defendants’ motion for “clarification” amounts to nothing more than an

impermissible second – and actually third – bite at the apple. On August 3, 2011, Judge Gertner
rejected the argument that Lead Plaintiffs abandoned their GAAP allegations relating to the
timing of State Street’s consolidation of the Conduit assets. On June 26, 2012, Judge Dein
rejected the argument that Judge Gertner had somehow implicitly dismissed the GAAP
allegations. And now, knowing that there is nothing to “clarify,” the State Street Defendants
urge the Court to reconsider the Opinion and entertain additional argument on the issue even “if
it is unwilling to find that Plaintiffs have abandoned their claims.”

Motion at 6-7.

This

preposterous and untimely (to say the least) motion for reconsideration (a) was rejected by Judge
Dein; (b) is 324 days overdue; and (c) satisfies none of the criteria for a motion for
reconsideration.

6

See also Carvahlo v. Equifax Info. Servs., 629 F.3d 876, 888 (9th Cir. 2010) (circuit court, in
reviewing a state court’s dismissal of consumer action, held that state court was correct in
dismissing a claim that was not defended in plaintiff’s brief); Elkins v. Elkins, Civ. No. 09-582,
2010 WL 2301152, at *4-7 (D. Me. June 7, 2010) (dismissing plaintiff’s claims for lack of
standing and lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Rooker-Feldman doctrine and addressing other Rule
12(b)(6) arguments on their merits, but also holding that any other ancillary claims brought by
plaintiff could also be dismissed because she abandoned them in her opposition brief);
Ferdinand-Davenport v. The Children’s Guild, 742 F. Supp. 2d 772, (D. Md. 2010) (holding that
plaintiff’s discriminatory discharge claim must be dismissed because plaintiff’s right to bring suit
under Title VII was limited to the charges of discrimination with the EEOC and that charge had
never been filed with the EEOC).
9

Case 1:09-cv-12146-GAO Document 190 Filed 08/09/12 Page 14 of 18

Any motion for reconsideration had to be filed no later than August 31, 2011, and
Defendants’ June 20, 2012 filing – 324 days past that deadline – is not only procedurally
improper but unreasonably late.7 Their motion should be denied for this reason alone. And even
if their motion had been timely filed, it would have been rejected out of hand. A motion for
reconsideration is proper only if the State Street Defendants can establish that there was “a
manifest error of law,” can “present newly discovered evidence,” or demonstrate that there is an
intervening change in the law. See Marks 3 Zet-Ernst, 455 F.3d at 15 (quoting Marie v. Allied
Home Mortg. Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 7 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005) (quotations omitted)). Defendants argue
no “manifest error of law,” nor could they. Judge Gertner’s rejection of their GAAP arguments
is entirely consistent with prevailing law. See, e.g., Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1421. There has
been no intervening change in the law.
Moreover, while Defendants do not and cannot provide any “newly discovered evidence”
to support their position, to the extent any new evidence exists, it only strengthens Lead
Plaintiffs’ claims. As Lead Plaintiffs discussed in their May 30, 2012 motion to compel and in
their July 18, 2012 and July 25, 2012 proposals for production, documents produced by State
Street’s consultant Oliver Wyman, a firm that was engaged by State Street beginning in
September 2007 to specifically address State Street’s growing concerns over its accounting of
the Conduit assets and the risks of consolidation, demonstrate State Street’s undisclosed
concerns over and monitoring of their accounting of the Conduit assets and consolidation risks.
