RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
FILE A SPECIAL APPEARANCE AND PROPOSED MOTION TO CONTINUE THE
ARRAIGNMENT DATE
The United States hereby submits its response to the motion of Kolon Industries, Inc. and
Kolon Corporation (hereinafter “defendants”) for leave to appear specially, Dkt. No. 180, and
proposed motion to continue the arraignment date, Dkt. No. 180-1. The United States does not
oppose defendants’ motion to appear specially. However, for the reasons stated herein, the
United States opposes defendants’ proposed motion to continue the arraignment date.
Background
On December 23, 2014, this Court denied motions to quash service upon defendants and
ordered them to appear for arraignment on January 6, 2015. Dkt. No. 173. On December 24,
2014, defendants moved this Court to continue the arraignment date, or in the alternative, to stay
the criminal case, so they could seek a writ of mandamus to reverse the service order. Dkt. No.

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 181 Filed 02/11/15 Page 2 of 10 PageID# 5933

174. The government opposed staying the criminal case, but did not oppose a brief continuance
of the arraignment date. Dkt. No. 175. This Court denied the stay motion, but continued the
arraignment date to February 19, 2015. Dkt. No. 177.
On December 30, 2014, defendants moved to specially appear before the Fourth Circuit,
and filed a petition for mandamus. The government deferred to the Fourth Circuit on whether to
grant defendants a special appearance in the mandamus proceeding. The Fourth Circuit has yet
to rule on defendants’ motion for a special appearance.
Defendants’ mandamus petition consisted of a 30-page filing, see Dkt. No. 180-2, as well
as 1,237 pages of exhibits. On January 8, 2015, the Fourth Circuit ordered the government to
file a response to the petition, see Dkt. No. 180-3, which the government did on January 20,
2014, see Dkt. No. 180-4.
Under the appellate rules, the petition and the response are the only filings required to
dispose of most mandamus petitions. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 21 provides, in
pertinent part:
(1) The court may deny the petition without an answer. Otherwise, it must order
the respondent, if any, to answer within a fixed time.
...
(5) If briefing or oral argument is required, the clerk must advise the parties, and
when appropriate, the trial-court judge or amicus curiae.
Fed. R. App. P. 21(b). Local Appellate Rule 21 provides, in pertinent part, “[a]fter an answer
has been filed, the Court ordinarily will decide the merits of the petition on the materials
submitted without oral argument. Occasionally, however, briefs may be requested and the matter
set for oral argument.” Local Appellate Rule 21(b) (emphasis added). In this case, the Fourth
Circuit has not ordered any additional briefing or oral argument on defendants’ petition for
mandamus.

Despite the volume of their mandamus petition and exhibits, on January 26, 2015,
defendants moved the Fourth Circuit for leave to file a 15-page reply brief in further support of
their petition. See Dkt. No. 180-5. The government opposed defendants’ motion on the grounds
that it was inconsistent with the briefing rules for mandamus petitions. See Dkt. No. 180-6. The
Fourth Circuit has yet to rule on defendants’ motion to file a reply brief.
Analysis
The decision whether to continue the arraignment date is entrusted to the discretion of
this Court. See, e.g., Neufeld v. United States, 118 F.2d 375, 380 (D.C. Cir. 1941). Here, the
Court should deny defendants’ request because there is no reason to believe that the Fourth
Circuit cannot adjudicate the pending mandamus petition by February 19, 2015, much less that it
is inclined to grant the petition.
At the outset, it should be noted that a mandamus petition does not divest the District
Court of jurisdiction over a case. See, e.g., Wright & Miller, 16 Federal Practice & Procedure §
3932.1 (3d ed.) (“Because it is not an appeal, a petition for an extraordinary writ does not
transfer the case to the court of appeals and does not oust the district-court’s jurisdiction to carry
on with its own proceedings.”) (citing Nascimento v. Dummer, 508 F.3d 905, 910 (9th Cir.
2007)). Accordingly, the mere possibility that the Fourth Circuit may take longer than February
19, 2015, to dispose of the mandamus petition is not, in and of itself, a compelling basis for
continuing the arraignment date.
Moreover, that the government did not oppose defendants’ request to continue the
original arraignment date of January 6, 2015, is not dispositive of the current motion. The
original arraignment date was a mere two weeks after the date this Court found defendants
served, and a mere week after defendants filed their petition for mandamus. Even under the most

3

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 181 Filed 02/11/15 Page 4 of 10 PageID# 5935

compressed of schedules, it would have been difficult for the Fourth Circuit to digest defendants’
substantial filings and order and review a response from the government during this brief period
of time, particularly since it coincided with the holiday season. Now, by contrast, the defendants
have filed their petition and ample supporting materials, and the government filed its response on
January 20, 2015, almost a full month prior to the current appearance date. The appellate rules
mandate that mandamus matters be handled expeditiously and be given preference over ordinary
civil cases. See, e.g., Fed. R. App. P. 21(b)(6). There is no reason to conclude that the Fourth
Circuit will have insufficient time to rule on the matter before the scheduled arraignment.
Defendants base their request for a continuance on the four-factor test for the issuance of
stays pending appeal. Dkt. No. 180-1 at 7-12. Given that defendants seek a continuance of the
arraignment date rather than a stay of the criminal case, the stay factors do not apply as a matter
of law. Nonetheless, to the extent this Court finds the stay factors pertinent to the exercise of its
discretion, the government submits that the factors argue against continuing the arraignment
date.
First, defendants fail to show any reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.
Defendants rely on Microstrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects, S.A., 661 F. Supp. 2d 548, 599 (E.D.
Va. 2009) for the proposition that this factor is satisfied wherever the movant intends to present a
substantial question on appeal. See Dkt. No. 180-1 at 7. But Microstrategy, Inc. involved a stay
pending appeal of a final order dissolving a permanent injunction, not a stay pending a petition
for a writ of mandamus to review a non-final order. See 2:01-cv-826-JBF at Dkt. Nos. 418, 477,
481. Unlike appeals as of right, mandamus will only be granted in “exceptional circumstances
amounting to judicial ‘usurpation of power.’ ” Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 95 (1967)
(citation omitted).

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 181 Filed 02/11/15 Page 5 of 10 PageID# 5936

In order to preserve the extraordinary nature of the remedy, the Supreme Court
has set forth two conditions that must be satisfied as a predicate to mandamus
jurisdiction. First, ‘the party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no other
adequate means to attain the relief he desires.’ Second, the petitioner bears ‘the
burden of showing that [his] right to issuance of the writ is clear and
indisputable.’
United States v. Moussaoui, 333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted).
Here, defendants have failed to establish a substantial likelihood of persuading the Fourth
Circuit that this Court’s order amounts to a judicial usurpation of power, in violation of a clear
and indisputable right for which defendants have no other adequate means to obtain relief. As
this Court is well aware, its order on service affirmed an earlier ruling by Judge Payne on the
permissibility of MLAT service—a ruling which is supported by judicial pronouncements in
other cases involving foreign corporate defendants, and is not squarely contradicted by any
authority defendants have identified to date.
Defendants base their claim of having raised a substantial legal question almost entirely
on the fact that the Fourth Circuit ordered the government to respond to their mandamus petition.
See Dkt. No.180-1 at 8 (“the Fourth Circuit’s request for a response indicates that Kolon’s
petition raises a substantial legal question”). This is mere speculation; any number of reasons
could have prompted the Fourth Circuit to request a response. And the Fourth Circuit has not
ordered additional briefing or oral argument on the petition, which would seem to cut against
defendants’ reading of the tea leaves. The Fourth Circuit’s actions to date fail to demonstrate
anything in particular about its views of defendants’ petition, much less show a likelihood of
their success on the merits.
Second, defendants also fail to make a compelling showing that they will suffer
irreparable injury absent a continuance. To the extent the Fourth Circuit decides the mandamus
petition by February 19, defendants cannot claim to have been injured at all. Even in the event
5

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 181 Filed 02/11/15 Page 6 of 10 PageID# 5937

that the Fourth Circuit fails to act by February 19, there is no reason to find irreparable injury to
defendants. They already have been charged in a public indictment, and there is no reason to
conclude that their appearance at the upcoming arraignment will have any additional marginal
impact on their public standing. Moreover, defendants will not be tried on February 19, but
merely will be expected to appear and be arraigned. Since defendants themselves concede that
the Fourth Circuit is likely to rule on their mandamus petition shortly, see, e.g. Dkt. No. 180-1 at
11 (“it is likely that the Fourth Circuit will soon rule on Kolon’s motion”), the injury caused by
their appearance is speculative at best.
Third, defendants improperly discount prejudice to others from a continuance.
Defendants attempt to shift the blame to the government, claiming that “DOJ itself is responsible
for nearly seven years of delays in the proceedings.” Dkt. No. 180-10 (emphasis in original).
Defendants know full well that their claim is not accurate. Without revisiting the entire case
history, the government rests on the following factual observations, all of which the government
can substantiate with written documentation if this Court were to request such a showing:
(1) Defendants unsuccessfully sought to quash grand jury subpoenas before the
District Court and the Fourth Circuit; the time it took to resolve these matters
meant that the government received critical evidence in this case substantially
later than the plaintiffs did in the civil case;
(2) Defendants and the government engaged in negotiations following the civil
trial, and even entered into an agreement tolling the statute of limitations so
that they could further pursue such negotiations;
(3) Defendants’ motions to quash service have all entailed substantial briefing and
argument, and some were not decided for a period of months;

6

Case 3:12-cr-00137-AJT Document 181 Filed 02/11/15 Page 7 of 10 PageID# 5938

(4) Following the second quashed service, defendants asked the government to
consider a standstill agreement the criminal case.1
As this Court is well aware, other delays in the case development were due to service efforts by
Korean authorities that this Court deemed insufficient, and to the necessity of presenting a
superseding indictment in light of a corporate reorganization that defendants effected after the
criminal conduct alleged in this case.
The defendants also are wrong to equate the third stay factor with the equities to the
government alone. Other parties are affected by the pending criminal case, including victims
(both the civil plaintiff and another company that was unsuccessfully targeted by the defendants,
according to the allegations in the indictment), witnesses who may be called to testify, and a codefendant, Edward Schulz, who is cooperating against the defendants and is currently awaiting
sentencing by this Court. All these parties are harmed by needless delays in the defendants’
appearance and the commencement proper of the criminal case.
Finally, defendants fail to properly assess the public interest. See Dkt. No. 180-1 at 12
(arguing that the public interests argues against proceeding with “discovery, pre-trial motions,
and potentially a lengthy trial” under the cloud of a pending mandamus petition). As defendants
themselves concede, “it is likely that the Fourth Circuit will soon rule on Kolon’s motion.” Id. at
11. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that holding arraignment will lead to a situation where the
defendants are subjected to extensive pre-trial practice, and trial itself, while their mandamus
petition is pending.

The government does not suggest that defendants acted improperly in seeking judicial relief at
various stages of the case (whether successfully or unsuccessfully), nor does it fault them for
engaging with the government on certain matters. But the case history demonstrably refutes
defendants’ claim that the present status of the criminal case is due to dilatory tactics by the
government.

If the circumstances were to change—for instance, if the Fourth Circuit were to set the
matter for oral argument and order additional briefing on a schedule that is not compatible with
the orderly continuation of criminal proceedings before the District Court—defendants could
seek to delay District Court proceedings at such time. The government would reconsider its
opposition under such circumstances. At present, the government submits that defendants have
failed to offer a compelling reason for continuing their appearance date.
