I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu") and Fujitsu Microelectronics America, Inc.
("FMA") (collectively "Plaintiffs") hereby oppose the motion of Defendants Nanya Technology
Corp. ("Nanya") and Nanya Technology Corp. U.S.A. ("Nanya USA") (collectively
"Defendants") to dismiss, transfer or stay this suit. (Dkt. No. 18.)

First, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, a case cannot be transferred to an
improper venue. Fujitsu and FMA do not reside in and are not subject to personal jurisdiction in
Guam; none of the events giving rise to the claims occurred there; and Fujitsu and FMA do not
have regular or established places of business in that district and do not have sufficient contacts
with Guam to establish personal jurisdiction. Thus, respectfully, the case cannot be transferred
to Guam.!

This Court should also not transfer this case to Guam because Guam is an
inconvenient forum. In fact, the Guam case was filed by Nanya during a critical phase of related
litigation in Japan, and Guam was believed chosen precisely because it is perhaps the most
inconvenient forum that Nanya could find. There are absolutely no relevant contacts between
any of the parties to this case and Guam, and none of the relevant documents and/or witnesses
are located in Guam. On the other hand, two parties are located in this district and, as explained
below, there are numerous reasons why this district is more convenient than Guam.

Further, this case is effectively the first-filed case and should not be dismissed or
transferred for this additional reason. Nanya filed a first complaint in Guam on September 13,
2006 ("Original Guam Complaint"), then Fujitsu filed this case on October 24, 2006, naming one
party not present in the Guam case (Nanya USA) and including claims for infringement of a

Fujitsu patent not in the Guam case. Nanya later filed an amended complaint in Guam on

 

' The pending Guam action is styled Nanya Tech. Corp. v. Fujitsu Ltd., Case No. 06-cv-00025 (D.
Guam).

November 17, 2006 ("Amended Guam Complaint"), adding Nanya USA and the new Fujitsu
patent in an effort to make the cases appear more similar. But because it added a new party and
new claims, the Amended Guam Complaint does not relate back to or receive the benefit of the
filing date of the Original Guam Complaint under applicable rules. Therefore, Fujitsu's
complaint filed in this district is the effective first-filed complaint, and the present case should
not be dismissed or transferred to Guam for this additional reason.

Even if this Court determines that Nanya's Amended Guam Complaint relates
back to its Original Guam Complaint, Nanya should still not receive the benefit of the first-to-file
rule because exceptions to the first-to-file rule would apply, e.g., anticipatory suit and forum
shopping. Each of these exceptions is triggered by the circumstances surrounding Nanya's filing
of the Original Guam Complaint.

Il. STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. Fujitsu and Nanya Have Been Negotiating Patent License Issues for More
than Five Years

Fujitsu approached Nanya in 1999 to discuss Nanya's unauthorized use of
substantial Fujitsu technology relating to semiconductors and to negotiate the terms of licenses to
patents covering that technology. Over the next five years, the parties met numerous times but
were unable to reach agreement on license terms. Fujitsu brought an action against Nanya for
infringement of a Japanese semiconductor patent in August of 2005 in the Tokyo District Court
in Japan. That litigation is progressing, and the parties have been engaged in a series of court-
supervised mediations and negotiations to try to settle their disputes. The parties have been
discussing global settlement issues in the Japanese mediations, including settlement concerning

Nanya's infringement of a number of Fujitsu's U.S. patents.

B. Under False Pretenses, Nanya Obtained a List of Infringed Fujitsu Patents
that Nanya then Used to File a Declaratory Judgment Suit in Guam

On August 10, 2006, prior to a negotiation in Japan, Nanya requested a list of all
of Fujitsu's patents that Fujitsu believed were infringed by Nanya. (Nanya's letter of August 10,
2006, attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Shigeru Kitano, January 11, 2007 ("Kitano
Decl.").) Nanya claimed it would use the list to prepare for the upcoming negotiation of a
worldwide license. (/d.) Relying on Nanya's representation in the August 10 letter that the list
would be used to further negotiations before the judge in the Tokyo District Court, on August 11,
2006 Fujitsu provided Nanya with a list of Korean, Japanese, and U.S. patents that Fujitsu
believed Nanya infringed. (Fujitsu's letter of August 11, 2006, attached as Exh. B to Kitano
Decl.)

On September 13, 2006, only one month after receiving Fujitsu's list of patents,
and the day before a scheduled meeting in Tokyo, Nanya filed the Original Guam Complaint,
seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability for each and
every Fujitsu U.S. patent on the list. As noted, it is believed that Guam was chosen as an
extremely inconvenient forum in an effort by Nanya to impact the Japanese mediation. In fact,
Nanya's U.S. counsel sent a letter directly to Mr. Kitano at Fujitsu advising him (incorrectly) that
Rule 11 precluded Fujitsu from filing litigation in a different forum or from filing litigation
based on patents that were not specifically disclosed to Nanya during the Japanese mediations
and settlement discussions. (Email letter from Michael Shore dated September 19, 2006 ("Shore
Letter") at 3, attached as Exh. C to Kitano Decl.) The Shore Letter contained numerous other
mistakes of law and fact. Nanya was clearly trying to use the Guam filing to influence the
Japanese mediations. The Shore Letter made it clear that the filing of the Guam case was
retaliatory, explicitly admitting that the "Nanya case was in response to the Fujitsu case [in

Japan]". (Shore Letter at 3.)

On October 24, 2006, Fujitsu filed the complaint in this Court ("Fujitsu's
Complaint"). Fujitsu's Complaint included Nanya USA as a party because it is believed to
import and sell at least certain of the infringing devices. The Northern District of California was
chosen as the most convenient forum as two of the parties, i.e., the relevant U.S. subsidiaries of
both Nanya and Fujitsu, reside here. Further, as noted below, Guam does not have personal
jurisdiction over either Fujitsu or FMA. In addition to the new party, Fujitsu added an additional
patent that was not included in the Original Guam Complaint. In an attempt to make the Guam
case appear substantively more similar to this action, Nanya filed the Amended Guam Complaint
on November 17, 2006, adding Nanya USA and additional causes of action, including a
declaratory judgment claim on the new Fujitsu patent and antitrust and Clayton Act claims by
Nanya USA.

Cc. The Parties Have Significant Contacts in the Northern District of California

FMA is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. (Declaration of Michael M.
Moore, January 11, 2007 ("Moore Decl.") 0x00A7 2.) Consequently, FMA's fact witnesses and
documents relevant to this litigation are located in the Northern District of California. (Moore
Decl. cent 20; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 21.) A number of Nanya's likely fact witnesses and documents
relevant to this litigation are also located in the Northern District of California because that is
where Plaintiff Nanya USA maintains its headquarters. (Declaration of Chris L. Holm, January
12, 2007 ("Holm Decl.") 0x00A7 14; id. Ex. L) (Amended Guam Complaint 2).

The Northern District of California is also a much more convenient location for
Fujitsu and its employees compared with Guam. Reasons for this include more options for
transportation and scheduling. (Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 22.) In addition, because Fujitsu's subsidiary
FMA is located in the Northern District of California, a number of Fujitsu's employees regularly
travel there. (Jd.) FMA also has cost-effective arrangements for accommodations for its out-of-

town visitors that can be made available to Fujitsu employees. (/d.) Fujitsu also has cost-

effective arrangements for transportation of documents to the Northern District of California.
(Id. 0x00A7 23.) Finally, FMA can assist Fujitsu with logistics in relation to litigation matters. (/d.)
D. Guam Has No Relationship Whatsoever to the Parties or Issues in this Case
Plaintiffs do not maintain any offices in Guam and have no operations, affiliates,
employees or salespersons in Guam. (Moore Decl. yen 4; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 4.) Plaintiffs do not own
real or personal property located in Guam. (Moore Decl. 0x00A7 6; Kitano Decl. cent 5.) Plaintiffs have
no bank accounts in Guam. (Moore Decl. 0x00A7 7; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 6.) Plaintiffs do not lease any
office space or other facility of any kind in Guam, nor do they maintain a telephone, telex or
telefax number in Guam. (Moore Decl. 0x00A7 8; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 7.) Plaintiffs do not maintain a post
office box or street address in Guam. (Moore Decl. 4 9; Kitano Decl. { 8.) They are not
registered to do business in Guam, (Moore Decl. 0x00A7 10; Kitano Decl. 9), do not file tax returns in
Guam, (Moore Decl. J 11; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 10), and do not advertise products or services in any
local media in Guam (Moore Decl. 12; Kitano Decl. yen 11). Plaintiffs have no directors, officers
or employees in Guam and have appointed no agents in Guam for service of process. (Moore
Decl. { 13; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 12.) Plaintiffs have never been party to any lawsuit or legal
proceeding in Guam Federal District Court.? (Moore Decl. { 16; Kitano Decl. J 13.) Plaintiffs
have filed no papers with any agency of Guam, have never negotiated nor executed any
agreements in Guam, nor have they executed any agreements that call for their performance in
Guam relating to the subject matter of this suit. (Moore Decl. 4 17; Kitano Decl. J 14, 15.) Prior
to the filing of Nanya's Complaint, Plaintiffs have had no correspondence with Nanya of any
kind in Guam nor in any way relating to the subject matter of this suit. (Moore Decl. 0x00A7 18;
Kitano Decl. 9 15.) Plaintiffs have no documents relevant to this law suit in Guam and know of

no fact witnesses in Guam. (Moore Decl. { 19; Kitano Decl. 0x00A7 20.) In its First Amended

Complaint, Nanya makes certain allegations concerning Fujitsu Computer Products of America,
Inc., Fujitsu General New Zealand Limited, and Fujitsu Ten. (Holm Decl. 0x00A7 14; id., Ex. L)
(Amended Guam Complaint 0x00A7 20.) Like Plaintiffs, none of these companies conduct business in
Guam or have any of the contacts with Guam listed above in this paragraph. (Kitano Decl. { 24.)

Nowhere in the pleadings in this case or in the pending Guam action have Nanya
or Nanya USA claimed to have any contact whatsoever with Guam.

E. This Action and the Guam Action Are Now on Nearly Identical Schedules

In its Motion to Dismiss, Nanya alleges that the Guam action is further along in
the proceedings and is moving at a faster pace. (Memorandum in Support of Defendants'
Motion to Dismiss, Transfer or Stay Case ("Nanya's Motion to Dismiss") at 6.) Nanya further
alleges that discovery would be under way in that action by the end of 2006. (/d.) None of those
allegations are true.

This action and the Guam action are at the same early stage and are proceeding at
the same rate. The Scheduling Conference in the Guam action will occur on January 30, 2007,
and discovery has been effectively stayed. (Holm Decl. yen 15; id. Ex. M) (Guam Scheduling
Order dated December 11, 2006) The Case Management Conference in this case is set for
February 2, 2007, just days after the Guam Scheduling Conference.

Il. ARGUMENT

A. The U.S. Supreme Court Has Held that a Case Cannot Be Transferred to an
Improper Venue

It is well-settled that a court cannot transfer a case to an improper venue, i.e., one
in which the case may not have been brought. Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U.S. 335, 344 (1960).

This Court cannot transfer this case to Guam because Guam is an improper venue.

 

3 Nanya does not dispute that venue is proper in this district.
