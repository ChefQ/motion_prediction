v.

Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-1043-GBL-IDD

AMANDA BLACKHORSE, MARCUS
BRIGGS-CLOUD, PHILLIP GOVER, JILLIAN
PAPPAN, and COURTNEY TSOTIGH,
Defendants.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
In its Complaint, Pro-Football asks the Court to review a split decision of the Trademark
Trial and Appeal Board (“TTAB”), which improperly granted Defendants’ petition to cancel six of
Pro-Football’s federal trademark registrations containing the word “REDSKINS” as used in
connection with Washington, D.C.’s professional football team (the “Redskins Marks”), on the
ground that the marks were disparaging to a substantial composite of Native Americans at the time
each was registered.1 See Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc., 2014 WL 2757516 (T.T.A.B. June 18,
2014) (the “Order”). Pro-Football brings this action as an appeal of the TTAB’s Order pursuant to
15 U.S.C. §1071(b), which provides that any “party to a cancellation proceeding” who is
“dissatisfied with the decision” is entitled to “remedy by a civil action.” 15 U.S.C. §§1071(a),
(b)(1). Further, “[w]here there is an adverse party, … any party in interest may become a party to
the action.” Id. §1071(b)(4).

1

The Court must determine whether the marks were disparaging at the time of registration—i.e.,
1967, 1974, 1978, and 1990—and not whether they are disparaging today. Order at *1. Defendants’
citations to present-day online definitions thus are not relevant to the inquiry. (Doc. 19, Br. at 1 n.1.)

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 2 of 27 PageID# 130

Defendants do not dispute that they are adverse parties, that they have “a real interest, a
personal stake, in the outcome” of this action, and that they claimed and represented this interest
before the TTAB. Order at *7. Among other things, Defendants: (1) filed the petition that initiated
the TTAB proceeding; (2) alleged they are personally injured by the registrations; (3) were the only
parties to participate in the proceeding; (4) requested the relief that the TTAB granted; and (5)
represented to the TTAB that this Court is a proper venue to review the Order. Because Defendants
concede their interest in the cancellation proceeding—indeed, it could not have proceeded without
that interest—they are “parties in interest” and thus proper parties in this action.
Defendants nonetheless now abruptly change course and move to dismiss the Complaint on
the ground that they should not be parties here because it is the TTAB that issued the Order, and thus
the Director of the USPTO is the “real” party in interest. (Doc. 19, Br. at 2.) But an action brought
under §1071(b) is a special form of review where “the district court acts as a quasi-appellate court.”
Paleteria La Michoacana, Inc. v. Productos Lacteos Tocumbo S.A. de C.V., 2014 WL 4759945, at
*5 (D.D.C. Sept. 25, 2014). Having sought the very relief issued by the TTAB, Defendants have
professed an interest in defending that Order on review. Defendants do not (because they cannot)
point to any case holding that a challenger to a trademark registration is not a proper defendant in an
action brought under §1071(b). Further, Defendants’ position cannot be squared with §1071(b)(2),
which expressly forbids joining the Director of the USPTO as a party to an inter partes proceeding
and thus recognizes that such a dispute is not with the USPTO, but rather between the parties who
actually (and vigorously) litigated the issue below.
Defendants also attempt to divest this Court of jurisdiction by claiming there is not an Article
III “Case or Controversy” between Pro-Football and Defendants. Not only does such a position defy
logic, given that this action seeks review from Defendants’ own petition for cancellation, but it also

-2-

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 3 of 27 PageID# 131

contradicts governing case law holding that the types of injuries Defendants purportedly suffered
from the continued registration of the Redskins Marks are “in harmony” with the “requirements for
maintaining a law suit in an Article III court.” Jewelers Vigilance Comm., Inc. v. Ullenberg Corp.,
823 F.2d 490, 492 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In any event, where Congress affords a procedural right to
appeal an agency decision, all that need be established is that the parties have a “personal stake” in
the outcome, to assure the Court of “that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of
issues.” Mass. v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007).
Finally, even if this Court were to find that the USPTO, and not Defendants, should
participate in this action, the proper remedy is not dismissal, but rather to direct that the Complaint
be served upon the Director of the USPTO pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(3) so that the action may
continue in this Court. To be clear, Pro-Football has no preference as to whether Defendants or the
USPTO defends the Order, as long as Pro-Football can exercise its statutory right under 15 U.S.C.
§1071(b)(1) to seek review of the Order through “remedy by a civil action.”
BACKGROUND2
A.

Procedure For Seeking Cancellation Of A Trademark Registration.
The Lanham Act bars the registration of trademarks that, inter alia, “may disparage” persons

“or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.” 15 U.S.C. §1052(a) (“Section 2(a)”).3 “[A]ny person

2

On a motion to dismiss, the Court may consider documents incorporated into a complaint by
reference. See, e.g., McLain v. KBR, Inc., 2014 WL 3101818, at *3 (E.D. Va. July 7, 2014) (Lee, J.).
Because Pro-Football’s Complaint seeks review of the Order, including whether the TTAB record
sufficiently supported the Order, both the Order and the record may be considered on this motion.
The record for the underlying TTAB proceeding is located on the USPTO’s website, at
http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185. All references to “TTABVue” herein refer to the
docket number for the underlying TTAB proceeding.

To determine whether a mark is disparaging, the Court must evaluate whether a “substantial
composite” of the referenced group found the marks to be disparaging, in the specific context of the
registrant’s services, at the time the mark was first registered. Order at *4-5. “[T]he the perceptions
(footnote continued)

who believes that he is or will be damaged … by the registration of a mark” may file a petition to
cancel a registration of a mark on the ground that it is contrary to Section 2(a). 15 U.S.C. §1064(3).
For the petition to proceed, the petitioner must also show: (1) a “real interest” in the proceeding
based on a “‘direct and personal stake in the outcome’ of the cancellation”; and (2) “a reasonable
basis for the belief that the challenged mark has or will cause damage.” Quality Serv. Grp. v. LJMJR
Corp., 831 F. Supp. 2d 705, 712 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting Ritchie v. Simpson, 170 F.3d 1092, 1095
(Fed. Cir. 1999)). The “real interest” requirement is intended to prevent “‘mere intermeddlers’ who
do not raise a real controversy” from initiating cancellation proceedings. Ritchie, 170 F.3d at 1095.
A cancellation proceeding before the TTAB is an “inter partes” proceeding—that is, it is
neither initiated or litigated by the USPTO, but rather by one or more petitioners, i.e., the “person
who believes that he is or will be damaged.” TTAB MANUAL OF PROCEDURE (“TBMP”) §102.02.4
In contrast, an “ex parte” proceeding is one where an applicant seeks to appeal “an examining
attorney’s final refusal to register a mark”—in such cases, there are no adverse parties. Id.
B.

Procedure For Appealing The TTAB’s Cancellation Of A Trademark Registration.
In the event that the TTAB grants a petition for cancellation, a “party to a cancellation

proceeding … who is dissatisfied with the decision of the [TTAB],” 15 U.S.C. §1071(a)(1), is
provided with its choice of two alternatives for appealing the decision:
(1)

The party “may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit,” 15 U.S.C. §1071(a)(1); or

of the general public are irrelevant to determining if [Pro-Football’s] marks are disparaging to Native
Americans,” and current attitudes—as opposed to attitudes in 1967, 1974, 1978, and 1990—are
likewise irrelevant. Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo, 284 F. Supp. 2d 96, 133-34 (D.D.C. 2003).
4

“An inter partes proceeding before the Board is similar to a civil action in a federal district court.
There are pleadings …; a wide range of possible motions; conferencing; disclosures; discovery; trial;
briefs; and, if requested, an oral hearing, followed by a decision on the case.” TBMP §102.03.
-4-

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 5 of 27 PageID# 133

(2)

The party “may … have remedy by a civil action,” filed in a U.S. district
court, 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(1).

Choosing to file a civil action rather than a direct appeal has consequences: While Federal Circuit
“review is limited to the record before the TTAB, a civil action in district court affords ‘litigants the
option of producing new evidence in a trial court.’” Swatch, S.A. v. Beehive Wholesale, L.L.C., 888
F. Supp. 2d 738, 745 (E.D. Va. 2012) (quoting J. Thomas McCarthy, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS
& UNFAIR COMPETITION §21:20 (4th ed. 2013) (“MCCARTHY”)).5 There is “no reason why the
dissatisfied party should be precluded from utilizing the processes of the forum best suited to his
needs as long as the aid of only one forum is invoked.” Gillette Co. v. ‘42’ Prods. Ltd., 435 F.2d
1114, 1117 (9th Cir. 1970). Neither §§1071(a) nor (b) sets forth any restrictions that would make
review by a district court an unavailable option to a dissatisfied party.6
In structuring the statute, Congress expressed a preference for review of TTAB decisions by
civil action rather than direct appeal to the Federal Circuit. Section 1071(a)(1) provides that even
where a dissatisfied party elects to file a direct appeal with the Federal Circuit, the appeal will be
dismissed if “any adverse party” files notice that he elects to have further proceedings conducted by
civil action in district court. That is, if either party prefers that a district court review the underlying
TTAB order, the district court will be the venue to hear the appeal. See MCCARTHY §21:20 (“an
appeal to the Federal Circuit can be made only with the mutual consent of all the parties”).

See also, e.g., Glendale Int’l Corp. v. U.S.P.T.O., 374 F. Supp. 2d 479, 484 n.7 (E.D. Va. 2005)
(“The principal difference between challenging a TTAB decision through an appeal to the Federal
Circuit and through a civil action in federal district court is that the latter route affords a party the
opportunity to introduce new evidence in support of its claims.”).

6

See, e.g., Creative Arts by Calloway, LLC v. Brooks, 2012 WL 6732907, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.
27, 2012) (section 1071(b) “permits any party dissatisfied with a TTAB ruling to commence an
action in a United States District Court”) (emphasis added).

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 6 of 27 PageID# 134

An action filed in a district court pursuant to §1071(b) is not merely a “new civil action” as
Defendants contend (Doc. 19, Br. at 7), but rather is a unique form of appeal, given that it
necessarily seeks review of an underlying TTAB decision. See, e.g., Paleteria La Michoacana, 2014
WL 4759945, at *5 (describing action as “quasi-appellate”); ZAO Odessky Konjatschnyi Zawod v.
SIA “Baltmark Invest,” 999 F. Supp. 2d 851, 858 n.3 (E.D. Va. 2014) (“This case comes before the
Court on appeal from the decision of the TTAB”); TBMP §906.01 (“[A]n appeal to the district court
is both an appeal and a new action.”). Indeed, in the very Order under review in this case, the TTAB
identified the Eastern District of Virginia as “the venue for appeals to District Court from USPTO
inter partes proceedings.” Order at *30 (emphasis added). Because of its appellate nature, a party
who files a civil action under §1071(b) does not need to seek relief directly from the defendant;
rather, as in any appeal, the relief requested may simply be a modification of the decision below.
See Timex Grp. USA, Inc. v. Focarino, 2013 WL 6713119, at *2 (E.D. Va. Dec. 17, 2013) (citing 15
U.S.C. §1071(b)) (holding that district courts may “modify the TTAB decision and declare that the
plaintiff’s mark is entitled to registration”), supplemented by 993 F. Supp. 2d 606 (E.D. Va. 2014).7
Finally, §1071(b) prohibits involvement by the Director of the USPTO as a party when a
review of inter partes TTAB proceedings are sought by civil action. Specifically, if a dissatisfied
party chooses review by a civil action, the statute instructs that the Director of the USPTO “shall not
7

The civil action proceeds like a typical appeal in many respects. For example, just as with a
standard appeal, the district court considers the record below when reviewing a TTAB order. See
Swatch AG v. Beehive Wholesale, LLC, 739 F.3d 150, 155 (4th Cir. 2014) (“[t]he district court must
admit the PTO record if a party so moves”). As noted above, one way a civil-action remedy sought
pursuant to §1071(b) departs from a traditional appeal is that “the parties have an unrestricted right
to submit further evidence.” Id. If neither party submits further evidence, the Court will determine
whether the TTAB’s finding of disparagement was supported by substantial evidence—functionally,
it is identical to review by the Federal Circuit. See Timex, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 607. However, if
either party opts to supplement the record with additional evidence, “de novo review of the entire
record is required because the district court ‘cannot meaningfully defer to the PTO’s factual findings
if the PTO considered a different set of facts.’” Id. (quoting Swatch AG, 739 F.3d at 156).

be made a party to an inter partes proceeding.” 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(2) (emphasis added). Rather,
“[w]here there is an adverse party, such suit may be instituted against the party in interest as shown
by the records of the [USPTO] at the time of the decision complained of, but any party in interest
may become a party to the action.” Id. §1071(b)(4) (emphasis added). By contrast, “[i]n any case
where there is no adverse party, a copy of the complaint shall be served on the Director.” Id.
§1071(b)(3) (emphasis added).
C.

Procedural History.
The Harjo Action. In September 1992, seven Native Americans filed a petition with the

TTAB to cancel the registrations for the Redskins Marks on multiple grounds, including
disparagement under Section 2(a). Compl. ¶16. In 1999, the TTAB held that the Redskins Marks
were disparaging to Native Americans at the time of registration, granted the petition, and scheduled
the registrations for cancellation. Id. ¶17. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)—the same statute
invoked by Pro-Football in this action—Pro-Football sought review of the TTAB’s 1999 order in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia.8 Harjo, 284 F. Supp. 2d at 100. As Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly recognized, “section 1071(b)(1) states that a party ‘dissatisfied with the decision of
the [TTAB] … may … have remedy by a civil action.’” Id. Neither the Harjo defendants (who
were represented by the same counsel as Defendants here) nor the Court ever indicated or argued
that the court’s jurisdiction—statutory or constitutional—to review the order was lacking.
In 2003, Judge Kollar-Kotelly reversed the TTAB, ruling that the record before the TTAB,
even when evaluated under the “substantial evidence” standard of review, did not support a finding
of disparagement during the 1967-1990 time frame, id. at 135-36, and that the petitioners’ claims

8

At that time, §1071(b)(4) stated that where “adverse parties resid[e] in a plurality of districts not
embraced within the same State,” the District Court for the District of Colombia had jurisdiction.

were barred by the doctrine of laches, id. at 140, 144. The laches ruling was ultimately affirmed by
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2009, 565 F.3d 880 (D.C. Cir. 2009), and the Supreme Court
denied the Harjo defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari, 558 U.S. 1025 (2009).
The Blackhorse TTAB Proceeding. While the Harjo case was working through the federal
courts, Defendants in this action filed a petition substantively identical to that filed by the Harjo
petitioners, asking the TTAB to cancel the registrations for the Redskins Marks on the ground of
disparagement under Section 2(a). See TTABVue No. 1 (Aug. 11, 2006). Defendants alleged that
each of them are “damaged by the continued registration of the marks,” and “pray[ed] that each of
them be cancelled.” Id. at 4. The TTAB suspended the proceeding until final disposition of Harjo,
Compl. ¶23, after which it set a discovery and briefing schedule, id. ¶27. No parties other than
Defendants and Pro-Football ever participated in the cancellation proceeding.9
In the course of discovery, each Defendant alleged that he or she suffered an individualized,
personal, discrete, and continuing injury from the registrations. For example, in a verified response
to an interrogatory, Defendant Amanda Blackhorse represented, inter alia:


“Every time [she] sees or hears the term ‘redskins,’ it is damaging.” TTABVue
No. 123 at 15.



“From time-to time, [she] is confronted with the term in a work setting or in
school, such as when someone wears a Washington NFL team jersey, and this
harms her.” Id.



She “doesn’t want to watch when the Washington NFL team is on television,
even though she is a big football fan and greatly enjoys watching NFL football”
because “[t]he team’s name and symbols ruin her experience.” Id. at 16.

9

During the TTAB proceeding, Defendants: (1) responded to discovery requests; (2) entered into
two stipulations regarding the submission of evidence; (3) participated in conferences before the
TTAB; (4) sat for depositions; (5) submitted a Notice of Reliance containing more than 7,000 pages
of purported evidence; (6) filed opening and reply trial briefs; (7) filed and opposed motions; and (8)
appeared at an oral hearing. See, e.g., TTABVue Nos. 31, 34, 36, 37, 39 (at 2), 45, 47-126, 177, 178,
182, 184, 192, 197, 198.



She visits Washington, D.C. “for educational and patriotic purposes, and to visit
friends and family,” but the prevalence of Redskins “paraphernalia in
Washington, D.C. makes [her] feel unwelcome in the city, and reduces her
willingness to travel there.” Id.



She “is afraid to practice freedom of speech for her fear of mockery and
intimidation by those who support the use of Native imagery, symbols, and
mascots in sports and the media.” Id.



“[T]he use of feathers in these marks harms” her because “feathers [are] used for
ceremonial purposes only and should be respected as one would respect a bible in
the Christian faith.” Id. at 17.



“[She] was especially damage[d] by the marks at issue” at a game between the
Washington Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs on October 16, 2005, where
“people [made] obscene and racist gestures toward” members of her advocacy
group, and the registrations allegedly “helped to create the context and culture
that led to such a display of hate and bigotry.” Id.10

In addition to disputing Defendants’ petition on the merits, Pro-Football also asserted an
affirmative defense of laches, as it had in Harjo. In an order setting forth the applicable law for the
case, the TTAB ruled that because the Blackhorse case “is essentially a relitigation of what
transpired in the Harjo case,” it would adopt the D.C. Circuit’s legal standard for laches. TTABVue
No. 40 at 12 n.6 (May 31, 2011).
On the same day as it filed its trial brief, Defendants moved the TTAB to reconsider its ruling
that the D.C. Circuit’s laches standard would apply. TTABVue No. 178 (Sept. 6, 2012). In that
motion, Defendants explicitly recognized that this Court was a proper venue for appeal of the
TTAB’s ultimate decision. They argued that, while D.C. Circuit precedent applied at the time of the
TTAB’s decision in Harjo, Congress had subsequently “changed the venue in which subsequent
proceedings may occur … from the District of Colombia to the United States District Court for the
Eastern district of Virginia (as the alternative to an appeal to the Federal Circuit).” Id. at 2 (citing

See also, e.g., TTABVue No. 111 at 19 (Mr. Briggs-Cloud); TTABVue No. 118 at 28-29 (Mr.
Gover); TTABVue No. 113 at 13 (Ms. Pappan); TTABVue No. 116 at 39 (Ms. Tsotigh).

America Invents Act, Pub. L. 112-29, §9(a) (Sept. 16, 2011) (“AIA”)). In other words, the sole basis
for Defendants’ motion was that subsequent proceedings by civil action would occur in the Fourth
Circuit rather than the D.C. Circuit. Id; see also id. at 3 (AIA “changed the potential venue for
subsequent federal court proceedings … to the Eastern District of Virginia”).
The TTAB’s Decision. In a 2-1 decision, a TTAB panel majority granted Defendants’
petition and scheduled the registrations for cancellation. Order at *29, *34. But, as Defendants
correctly note, the registrations have not yet been cancelled. (Doc. 19, Br. at 6.) Rather, the
registrations will remain active and valid until any appeals have been fully resolved. See TBMP
§806.
In its decision, the majority recounted injuries each Defendant claimed to suffer from the
continued registration of the Redskins Marks, concluding that each “has established a real interest, a
personal stake, in the outcome of this proceeding.” Order at *7 (emphases added). The Court also
granted Defendants’ motion for reconsideration of the laches standard based on Defendants’
representation that an appeal of the Order could be heard in this Court, holding:
The America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, changed the venue for appeals
to District Court from USPTO inter partes proceedings to the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Virginia from the U.S. District Court of the District of
Columbia. … Accordingly, subsequent judicial review of this dispute, if any, will
occur either in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in the
Fourth Circuit or in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ….
Order at *30.11
Administrative Trademark Judge Bergsman dissented from the opinion, concluding that
Defendants’ petition was premised on the same evidentiary record that the district court in Harjo

The TTAB then looked to Fourth Circuit law in its laches analysis. See Order at *32 (“the
Fourth Circuit has not addressed whether laches applies to a [disparagement] claim”).

“previously ruled was insufficient to support an order to cancel” the Redskins Marks, so the record
remained insufficient in this case as well. Id. at *35.
The Instant §1071(b) Action. Pro-Football timely filed this lawsuit under § 1071(b)(1)
against the only other parties who participated in the proceedings below, i.e., Defendants. The
remedies that Pro-Football seeks include, inter alia, that this Court enter judgment: (1) reversing the
Order; and (2) ordering the TTAB to deny Defendants’ petition for cancellation. Compl. at 34
(Prayer for Relief (a)-(b)).
Pro-Football also alleges, inter alia, that Defendants’ petition was barred by laches because
each Defendant unreasonably and inexcusably delayed before filing the petition, causing prejudice to
Pro-Football—the very same ground on which the Harjo defendants’ petition was dismissed by the
U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia, affirmed by the D.C. Circuit. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶5,
8, 18-19, 24-26, 126-129, 147-148, p.21 n.6.
ARGUMENT
The Court’s jurisdiction over this lawsuit is straightforward: §1071(b) allows any party
dissatisfied with a decision of the TTAB to have “remedy by a civil action,” allowing “any party in
interest [to] become a party to the action.” 15 U.S.C. §§1071(b)(1), (4). Defendants conceded
before the TTAB—as they must—that each has a “real interest” and “personal stake” in the grant or
denial of the cancellation petition they filed. Order at *7. This “interest” is enough to be a party.
Defendants’ argument that this action does not present a “Case” or “Controversy” fares no
better—Defendants’ professed injuries stemming from the registrations, and their request for legal
intervention to cancel those registrations, establish a “case” or “controversy” between the parties.

- 11 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 12 of 27 PageID# 140

Further, Defendants ignore robust case law establishing that where, as here, Congress creates a right
to appeal an agency decision, Article III jurisdiction will be found upon demonstration of an injury.12
I.

DEFENDANTS ARE “PARTIES IN INTEREST” UNDER 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(4).
Under 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(4), any party to a cancellation proceeding dissatisfied with a

decision of the TTAB may, as a remedy, institute a civil action “against the party in interest as
shown by the records of the [USPTO] at the time of the decision complained of, but any party in
interest may become a party to the action” (emphasis added).13 As “parties in interest” to the
underlying cancellation proceeding, Defendants are proper defendants in this action.
A.

Under The Text And Structure Of 15 U.S.C §1071(b)(4), Defendants Are
“Parties In Interest.”

Under the plain language of §1071(b)(4), Defendants are “parties in interest.” As noted
above, in order to have standing to bring a petition for cancellation on Section 2(a) disparagement
grounds, a petitioner must not only attest that he “believes that he is or will be damaged” by the
registration, 15 U.S.C. §1064, but also must demonstrate: (1) a “real interest” in the outcome of the
proceeding; and (2) a reasonable basis for the belief that the mark has caused or will cause damage.
12

While Defendants repeatedly encourage the Court to believe that Pro-Football’s only option was
to “appeal[] to the Federal Circuit under 15 U.S.C. §1071(a), where the USPTO could have defended
its decision on appeal” (Br. at 9), Defendants ignore that: (1) Pro-Football is statutorily entitled to
choose the avenue of review that best suits its needs; (2) as the “adverse party” to the underlying
proceeding, Defendants, not the USPTO would be the appellee in the Federal Circuit; and (3) under
§1071(a), Defendants would have had the option of “removing” such an appeal to this Court
anyway, demonstrating this Court’s ultimate jurisdiction over the dispute. Defendants then speculate
that Pro-Football “presumably” chose to file a §1071(b) action in this Court rather than a direct
appeal to the Federal Circuit—notwithstanding that §1071(b) allows a party to introduce additional
evidence—because, according to Defendants, the Federal Circuit supposedly has “rejected” ProFootball’s constitutional arguments. (Doc. 19, Br. at 9.) Pro-Football need not address Defendants’
unfounded guesses on the merits other than to point out that Defendants do not cite a single case
addressing a claim of disparagement brought under Section 2(a).

13

While Defendants repeatedly quote the part of the statute referring to the records of the USPTO
(see Doc. 19, Br. at 7, 10, 11, 12 n.8), they never disclose the second part of the sentence, i.e., that
“any party of interest may become a party to the action.”

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 13 of 27 PageID# 141

Ritchie, 170 F.3d at 1095. To show a “real interest,” the cancellation petitioner “must have a direct
and personal stake in the outcome,” i.e., a “legitimate personal interest.” Id. This requirement
ensures that “‘mere intermeddlers’ who do not raise a real controversy from bringing” cancellation
petitions. Id. Here, the TTAB has determined—and Defendants do not dispute—that each
Defendant has “a real interest, a personal stake, in the outcome of this proceeding.” Order at *7. In
addition, there were no other parties to the proceeding below who asserted any interest in
cancellation. Thus, Defendants are, by definition, parties in interest.14
Defendants argue that they have “no economic or legal interest” in this action because an
adverse ruling by the Court “will not affect any of their economic or legal rights or obligations”;
they would only “be pleased or disappointed” by the result. (Doc. 19, Br. at 10.) Such a position,
however, flatly contradicts Defendants’ earlier representations that the continued existence of the
registrations causes them, and will continue to cause them, direct and personal injury. Defendants
are not mere members of the public who would simply be “disappointed” by a reversal of the Order;
their position is that reversal would cause them injury. It is this “direct and personal” stake that
afforded them standing to file a petition in the first place. And if they have a “direct and personal”
stake in seeking cancellation, that same “direct and personal” stake will necessarily be implicated by

14

Defendants make no attempt to define “party in interest.” The phrase appears to have been first
used in the version of the Patent Act passed in 1952, which stated in relevant part that a party
“dissatisfied with the decision of the board of patent interferences” may have a civil remedy
“instituted against the party in interest as shown by the records of the Patent Office at the time of the
decision complained of, but any party in interest may become a party to the action.” 35 U.S.C. §146,
Pub. L. 82-593, 66 Stat. 792 at 803 (July 19, 1952). A few years later, one district court interpreted
the phrase “party in interest” to mean “an indispensable party.” Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v.
Chavannes Indus. Synthetics, Inc., 128 F. Supp. 659, 661 (D. Del. 1955). Here, Defendants are
indispensable parties—they are the only parties who established standing below; absent their
presence, no party with standing would remain before the TTAB and this Court would be required
to vacate the Order and dismiss the petition. Cf. Harjo, 284 F. Supp. at 144 (dismissing cancellation
petition, including on ground that laches barred petitioners from bringing petition).
- 13 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 14 of 27 PageID# 142

reversal of the Order. Further, Defendants cite no authority that they must have an “economic” or
“legal” interest, akin to ownership of a competing trademark, to be a “party in interest”—the statute
contains no such limitation, and such an interpretation contradicts the “interest” required to file a
petition.
Similarly, Defendants assert that adverse parties in cancellation proceedings “[o]rdinarily”
are “two businesses claiming rights” to a mark, while this action involves individuals “who sought
cancellation on public interest grounds.” (Doc. 19, Br. at 13.) While this may be true, Section
1071(b), does not distinguish between petitioners’ motives for seeking cancellation; rather, it permits
“any party in interest” to be added as a defendant to the civil action. Further, while Defendants cite
the “public interest” as their motive for filing, they have repeatedly professed that their own direct
and personal interests, apart from those of the general public, are at stake. See Jewelers Vigilance,
823 F.2d at 493 (standing established where petitioner shows “a personal interest in the outcome of
the case beyond that of the general public,” even where the petitioner “‘may invoke the general
public interest in support of their claim’”) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 502 (1974)).
B.

Defendants Have Not Disclaimed Or Disavowed Their Interest In Cancellation.

Not only did Defendants profess to have an “interest” in this dispute when they filed the
petition to cancel before the TTAB, but they continue to have an interest in the dispute because: (1)
they have not disclaimed their interest by claiming they are no longer harmed by the registrations’
validity; and (2) the registrations have not yet been cancelled.
Defendants rely heavily on a patent case, 3V, Inc. v. CIBA Specialty Chems. Corp., 587 F.
Supp. 2d 641 (D. Del. 2008), for the proposition that Defendants are not “parties in interest.” (See
Doc. 19, Br. at 10-11.) 3V, however, strongly supports Pro-Football. In 3V, the Board of Patent
Appeals and Interferences (“BPAI”) found that CIBA had priority of invention over 3V on certain

- 14 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 15 of 27 PageID# 143

patents, but certain of CIBA’s claims were unpatentable. Id. at 642. On appeal, 3V initiated a civil
action against CIBA under 35 U.S.C. §146 challenging the priority determination, and CIBA crossclaimed on BPAI’s patentability determinations. Id.15 After the civil action was filed, the parties
entered settlement negotiations, whereupon 3V formally disclaimed its entire interest in the patent,
dedicating “all interest in the patent to the public.” Id. at 645, 647. CIBA, however, still wanted the
Court to consider whether its claims were patentable. The court concluded that for a party to be a
“party in interest” under §146, the parties “must have some articulable reason to participate in the
dispute.” Id. at 647 (emphasis added). 3V’s statutory disclaimer of any and all interest in the patent
removed any case or controversy between the parties—3V, through its own admission, no longer had
an articulable reason to challenge CIBA’s claims, or any other stake to protect in the litigation.
Here, however, Defendants have an “articulable reason” to participate in this dispute: they
allege to have been, and will continue to be, damaged “by the continued registration of the marks.”
TTABVue No. 1 at 4. Further, because the registrations have not yet been cancelled, but only
scheduled for cancellation, Defendants ostensibly continue to be injured by the registrations.
Defendants have not “disclaimed” their “legitimate, personal interest” in having the registrations
cancelled; if that were the case, this Court should vacate the Order and direct the petition to be
denied on the basis that no one with standing remains to litigate it. Nor can Defendants try to
remove themselves from the dispute they initiated by stating they no longer have an interest because
Pro-Football’s dispute is now with the USPTO—under such logic, CIBA’s dispute on appeal was

15

35 U.S.C. §146 stated at that time that “[a]ny party to an interference dissatisfied with the
decision of the [BPAI] may have remedy by civil action” and that “suit may be instituted against the
party in interest as shown by the records of the [USPTO] at the time of the decision complained of,
but any party in interest may become a party to the action.” 3V, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 643 n.2.

- 15 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 16 of 27 PageID# 144

not with 3V, but with the BPAI (and vice versa).16 Rather, any disclaimer by Defendants would
serve to moot the underlying petition, requiring its dismissal.17
C.

The Proceeding Below Was Inter Partes, With Defendants Appearing As
Adverse Parties.

Defendants also argue that they are not “parties in interest” because it is the USPTO with
whom Pro-Football now has a dispute, akin to an ex parte review rather than an adversarial, inter
partes proceeding. Defendants, however, were quintessential adverse parties below.
First, the cancellation proceeding indisputably was conducted as an inter partes proceeding.
Defendants participated in every stage of the litigation as the sole representatives on behalf of the
petition they filed—they produced discovery, sat for depositions, participated at TTAB conferences,
submitted more than 7,000 paged of purported evidence with their Notice of Reliance, filed trial
briefs, filed and opposed motions, and appeared at an oral hearing before the TTAB.
Second, both the TTAB and courts understand cancellation proceedings such as the one
below to be inter partes. See Order at *30 (describing proceeding below as “inter partes”); TBMP
§102.02 (describing cancellation proceedings as inter partes); Promgirl, Inc. v. JPC Co., Ltd., 2009
WL 6424064, at *3 (T.T.A.B. Dec. 24, 2009) (similar); Rosenruist-Gestao E Servicos LDA v. Virgin

16

Defendants cite Nachtman v. Toulmin, 196 F. Supp. 367 (S.D. Ohio 1961) for the proposition
that “party in interest” refers only “to the owner or assignee of the patent at issue or a similar patent,
and not the adverse party to the proceedings.” (Br. at 11.) Nachtman says no such thing—there, the
defendant conveyed all “right, title and interest” in his patent to Union Carbide, who then recorded
its interest with the USPTO. Id. at 368. Because the defendant no longer retained any interest in the
patent, he was not a “party in interest.” Defendants, however, have not disclaimed their previously
asserted interest. Further, Defendants’ interpretation of Nachtman ignores the clause of §1071(b)(4)
that says that “any party in interest may become a party to the action.”
17

Arizonans for Official English v. Ariz., 520 U.S. 43, 73 (1997) (“When a civil case becomes moot
pending appellate adjudication, [t]he established practice … in the federal system … is to reverse or
vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.”) (internal quotes omitted).

Enters. Ltd., 511 F.3d 437, 443 n.4 (4th Cir. 2008) (“[a]n inter partes proceeding … is an adversarial
action between parties” that “can take the form of … a cancellation proceeding”).
Third, as its sole support, Defendants cite to Hans C. Bick, Inc. v. Watson, 253 F.2d 344
(D.C. Cir. 1958) for the proposition that a party who filed a petition for cancellation was not a “party
in interest” because the plaintiff’s dispute was really with the Commissioner of Patents. (See Br. at
12-13.) Bick, however, was decided under a version of the Patent Act where the Commissioner of
Patents could be named as a party to a civil action, which is what the plaintiff had done. The
Commissioner moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that only the petitioners, not the
Commissioner, should have been named. Id. at 344. The D.C. Circuit ruled that because the statute
specifically allowed the plaintiff to sue the Commissioner, “[i]n the circumstances it would be
pointless to require the appellant to sue only the petitioners rather than the Commissioner, and we do
not believe that Congress so intended.” Id. at 346. Four years later, however, Congress amended the
applicable statute by removing the provision that said the Commissioner could be joined as a party to
a civil action and inserting language stating that the Commissioner “shall not be made a party to an
inter partes proceeding.” See Pub. L. 87-772, 76 Stat. 769 at 772 (Oct. 9, 1962) (emphasis added).
This language remains in the statute today. 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(2). This amendment demonstrates
Congress’s intent that that adversarial, inter partes disputes are not to be considered disputes with the
USPTO. As a leading treatise concludes: “The proper party defendant in the civil case is the
opponent (e.g., opposer, applicant, petitioner for cancellation, registrant, etc.), not the
Commissioner.” MCCARTHY §21:24.18

18

Bick has been heavily criticized and has not been cited by a federal court for almost 50 years.
See MCCARTHY §21:24 (describing Bick as “aberrational,” concluding that “[a]lthough the court
strove mightily to classify the case as review of an ex parte decision, such a result is probably
impossible [today] since the 1962 amendment says that the Commissioner cannot be a party

D.

Both Defendants And The TTAB Have Already Argued And Decided That This
Court Has Jurisdiction Under §1071(b)(4).

Both Defendants and the TTAB have expressed that the Eastern District of Virginia is a
proper court to review the Order. As noted above, during the cancellation proceeding, Defendants
filed a motion asking the TTAB to “reconsider the legal standard for laches,” in which Defendants
argued that the AIA “changed the venue” for “subsequent proceedings … from the District of
Colombia to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (as the alternative to
the Federal Circuit)” and “[t]hus, subsequent judicial proceedings, if any, will occur in either the
Fourth Circuit or in the Federal Circuit.” TTABVue No. 178 at 2; see also id. at 3 (similar).
Defendants thus asked the TTAB to reconsider its earlier ruling, which had stated that the legal
standard for laches in this case would be governed by D.C. Circuit law. Given that the change of a
possible venue to the Eastern District of Virginia was Defendants’ sole basis for their motion,
Defendants cannot now be heard to claim that this Court is not an available forum.
Further, the TTAB relied on Defendants’ representations, agreeing that “subsequent judicial
review of this dispute, if any will occur either in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia in the Fourth Circuit or in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.” Order at *30. The
TTAB then provided specific analysis of Fourth Circuit law on this issue, conceding that “the Fourth

defendant in inter partes review”). Further, Defendants cannot rely on the Patent Act for guidance
on this point, because the Patent Act did not amend its language to exclude the Director from being
made a party; to the contrary, it still maintains that while the Director shall not be “a necessary
party” to a derivation proceeding, it may nonetheless be a party. 35 U.S.C. §146. In addition, in the
1962 amendment, Congress “eliminated” all cross-references “to patent appeals and inserted specific
rules for review of trademark decisions.” MCCARTHY §21:20.
- 18 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 19 of 27 PageID# 147

Circuit has not addressed whether laches applies to a claim that a term disparages a substantial
composite of an ethnic or cultural group.” Id. at *32.19
“[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in
maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a
contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position
formerly taken by him.” New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001) (quoting Davis v.
Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689 (1895)). “This rule, known as judicial estoppel, ‘generally prevents a
party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory
argument to prevail in another phase.’” Id. (quoting Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 221, 227 n.8
(2000)). Such is the case here—Defendants relied on an argument that this Court is an available
venue for review in order to avoid the law of the D.C. Circuit and prevail on its laches argument
before the TTAB. Defendants should be precluded from adopting a contrary position in this Court.
E.

Defendants Are The Only Proper Parties To Contest Laches.

Finally, Defendants are “parties in interest” because Pro-Football has asserted a laches
defense against them—a necessarily individualized and personal inquiry that cannot be adequately
defended by the Director of the USPTO or any other party. Pro-Football’s laches defense asserts
that each Defendant unreasonably and inexcusably delayed in filing the petition for cancellation. See,
e.g., Compl. ¶¶8, 126-129, 147-148. This is a claim that directly implicates Defendants’ own actions,
not the TTAB or the Director of the USPTO. Indeed, this defense formed the basis for dismissal of

19

The TTAB’s own “Media Fact Sheet,” made available the same day that the Order was issued,
posed the question “What are the options for appealing this TTAB decision?” and the response:
“Any civil action would be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which
has jurisdiction over civil actions seeking review of TTAB cancellation proceedings.”

the Harjo petition—four separate opinions were issued regarding the applicability of the laches
defense by the D.C. District Court and D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. See id. ¶¶18, 19, 24, 25.
Defendants indisputably have an “interest” in establishing that their petition was not barred
by laches; otherwise, they must concede that laches barred their petition, which would require the
Court to reverse the Order and dismiss the petition. See Harjo, 284 F. Supp. at 144. This
independently demonstrates that they are “parties in interest” to this action.
II.

PRO-FOOTBALL’S ACTION PRESENTS A “CASE” OR “CONTROVERSY.”
Recognizing that §1071(b) provides this Court with statutory jurisdiction to hear this action,

Defendants resort to claiming that Pro-Football does not present a “Case” or “Controversy” under
Article III of the U.S. Constitution. This argument is difficult to take seriously: The basis of
Defendants’ petition for cancellation is that they are personally injured by the registrations, and the
TTAB granted the relief they specifically requested. While Defendants try to avoid this reality by
claiming that Pro-Football’s controversy is not with Defendants, but rather the USPTO, Defendants
have already conceded, for much of the same reasons articulated above, that reversal of the Order
would cause them specific injury sufficient to confer Article III jurisdiction upon them.
First, the TTAB’s finding that Defendants had sufficient standing to bring their petition for
cancellation necessarily establishes that they have a sufficient interest in an appeal of the TTAB’s
resolution of that same petition. In Jewelers Vigilance Committee, Inc. v. Ullenberg Corp., 823 F.2d
490 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the Federal Circuit recognized that requisite standing to file a petition to
oppose a trademark registration “is in harmony with the standing requirements for maintaining a law
suit in an Article III court.” Id. at 492 (citing Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)). The Court
explained:
Of course, the constitutional requirement remains that the opposer “must allege a
distinct and palpable injury to himself, even if it is an injury shared by a large class
of other possible litigants. … But so long as this requirement is satisfied, persons to
- 20 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 21 of 27 PageID# 149

whom Congress has granted a right of action, either expressly or by clear
implication, may have standing to seek relief on the basis of the legal rights and
interests of others, and, indeed, may invoke the general public interest in support of
their claim.”
Id. at 493 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1974) (ellipsis in original)). Here,
Defendants have alleged “a distinct and palpable injury to” themselves from the continued validity
of the registrations, which have yet to be cancelled. See Order at *7 (each Defendant “has
established a real interest, a personal stake, in the outcome of this proceeding”). Because the
standing for filing a cancellation petition are “in harmony” with the Article III requirements for
participating in a lawsuit, this Court may easily find an Article III “case or controversy” here.
Second, Defendants describe this case as a “declaratory judgment action” that requires the
parties to have, among other things, sufficient “adverse legal interests” (Doc. 19, Br. at 14 (quoting
MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007).) Defendants ignore, however, that
this case is not simply a “declaratory judgment action,” but rather a request for review of an agency
determination, where the relief sought includes a reversal of the Order below and dismissal of
Defendants’ petition. “[W]here Congress has accorded a procedural right to a litigant, such as the
right to appeal an administrative decision”—as §1071(b) affords—certain requirements of Article III
justiciability, such as “immediacy and redressability,” are “relaxed.” Consumer Watchdog v.
Wisconsin Alumni Research Found., 753 F.3d 1258, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing Mass. v. E.P.A.,
549 U.S. 497, 517-18 (2007)). Rather, all such a litigant must demonstrate is injury. Id.20
A sufficient “case” or “controversy” will be found in such circumstances where a party has
“a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure that the dispute sought to be

20

As Consumer Watchdog explains, the context of a statutory grant of a procedural right, such as
review of a USPTO decision, “distinguishes the present inquiry from that governing a declaratory
judgment action,” 753 F.3d at 1262, which Defendants improperly assumes applies.
- 21 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 22 of 27 PageID# 150

adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of
judicial resolution.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 (1972) (quotation marks and citations
omitted). As the Supreme Court recently recognized, whether a party has a “personal stake” in a
case and whether a party has Article III standing “are flip sides of the same coin”—they are “simply
different descriptions of the same judicial effort” to make sure that the parties have sufficient
interests to present “concrete adverseness.” Sprint Commc’ns Co., L.P. v. APCC Servs., Inc., 554
U.S. 269, 288 (2008).
Defendants do not dispute that Pro-Football would be injured by the cancellation of the
registrations sufficient to give it Article III standing in this Court; rather, Defendants argue that there
are “no legal relations” as between Pro-Football and Defendants—“just a disagreement as to whether
[Pro-Football’s] trademarks may disparage Native Americans.” (Doc. 19, Br. at 15.) To the
contrary, there certainly is a robust controversy as between Pro-Football and Defendants:
Defendants filed a petition to cancel Pro-Football’s registrations, which would cause Pro-Football
injury; and Pro-Football now seeks reversal of the Order and dismissal of Defendants’ petition,
which Defendants concede would cause them injury. These respective injuries, along with
Defendants’ professed personal and concrete interest in the cancellation of the registrations,
demonstrate that each party has a sufficient “personal stake” to guarantee that the issues will be
presented in an adversary context. That is all that is necessary in the context of a statutorily-created
review of an agency action.
On this closer inspection, the premise of Defendants’ argument crumbles. Imagine, for
example, if Pro-Football had prevailed before the TTAB and Defendants sought review: Would
there be no “case” or “controversy” as between Defendants and Pro-Football because Defendants do
not have a “legal interest” in the registrations for Article III purposes? Accepting Defendants’

- 22 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 23 of 27 PageID# 151

arguments, no such petition for cancellation based on disparagement could ever be reviewed in a
federal court—be it the Federal Circuit or a district court—because the petitioner would never have
its own competing mark at issue. Perhaps that is why Defendants do not cite a single trademark case
where Article III justiciability has not been found from a TTAB review of a petition to cancel or
oppose a mark’s registration.
Third, Defendants rely on a single patent case—Consumer Watchdog v. Wisconsin Alumni
Research Foundation—for the proposition that this action does not present a sufficient “case” or
“controversy.” (Doc. 19, Br. at 15-16.) Consumer Watchdog, however, is inapposite. Under 35
U.S.C. §311(a) of the Patent Act, any third party—whether or not it has any personal stake or real
interest in a patent—may file a request for reexamination of that patent with the Patent Trial and
Appeal Board, without any standing requirements. See Consumer Watchdog, 753 F.3d at 1262
(“[t]he statute at issue here allowed any third party to request reexamination”). Consumer Watch, a
public charity, made such a reexamination request. Id. at 1260. Consumer Watch, however, had no
individual interest in the patent at issue apart from “a general grievance”; that is, it had no
“particularized, concrete stake in the outcome of the reexamination.” Id. at 1262-63. Here,
however, Defendants allege—and the TTAB found—that each Defendant did have a particularized,
“personal stake in the outcome of” the TTAB proceeding.21 Order at *7. Indeed, Defendants could

21

This is confirmed by Ms. Blackhorse’s testimony about her alleged personal injuries from the
registrations—she represented that, as a result of the registrations, she is harmed, e.g., when: she is
“confronted” with a Redskins jersey at work or school; she is unable to watch NFL football games
on television, even though she wants to, because the team name and symbol “ruin her experience”;
the prevalence of Redskins paraphernalia in Washington, D.C., reduces her willingness to travel
there; and she was subjected to “obscene and racists gestures” at an October 16, 2005 football game,
which causes her to be “afraid to practice freedom of speech.” TTABVue 123 at 15-17.

- 23 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 24 of 27 PageID# 152

not have alleged only “a general grievance” without a “personal stake,” or they could not have
established standing to bring their petition in the first place.22
Fourth, Defendants suggest that the Article III inquiry for a defendant is equal to that for a
plaintiff. (See Br. at 16 (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43 (1997)).)
However, in the “rare[]” situation in which Article III jurisdiction “focus[es] … on the defendant,”
the “inquiry implicates questions related to whether the defendant has a sufficient interest to present
a justiciable controversy with the plaintiff.” Nat. Res. Defense Council, Inc. v. Jamison, 787 F.
Supp. 231, 235 n.1 (D.D.C. 1990). In this case, for the reasons stated above, Defendants have a
sufficient interest the cancellation of the registrations to present a controversy. And while
Defendants claim they have no interest in this action because they do not own “any potentially
infringing trademark” (Doc. 19, Br. at 17), a party may have “a real interest” in a mark’s registration
even “without proprietary rights in a mark or without asserting that it has a right or has an interest in
using the alleged mark.” Jewelers Alliance, 823 F.2d at 493. Such is the case here.
III.

IF THE COURT FINDS THE USPTO TO BE THE PROPER PARTY TO DEFEND
THE ORDER, IT SHOULD PERMIT PRO-FOOTBALL TO SERVE ITS
COMPLAINT UPON THE DIRECTOR OF THE USPTO.
For the reasons above, this Court should deny Defendants’ motion. If this Court nonetheless

decides that Defendants are not proper parties in this action, Pro-Football respectfully submits that
the proper remedy is not dismissal of the Complaint, but rather that the Court permit Pro-Football to
serve the Complaint upon the Director of the USPTO pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1071(b)(3).

22

Defendants also cite to 3V for the proposition that there is no case or controversy (Doc. 19, Br. at
17), but there the lack of case or controversy stemmed from a party’s disclaimer to the patent,
eliminating the dispute. Here, however, Defendants have not disclaimed their interest their petition
for cancellation.

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 25 Filed 10/03/14 Page 25 of 27 PageID# 153

Courts recognize that outright dismissal of a complaint seeking review of a TTAB order
should not be granted where it “would effectively preclude review of the determination entered by
the TTAB.” Prod. Source Int’l, LLC v. Nahshin, 2014 WL 2919510, at *6 (D.N.J. June 27, 2014).
Thus, for example, courts will transfer an action to another district, where appropriate, rather than
dismiss a case filed in the wrong venue. See id.; Trizetto Grp., Inc. v. Farmaco-Logica, B.C., 2013
WL 140253, at *2 (D.D. C. Jan. 11, 2013) (citing cases). Likewise here, if the Court agrees with
Defendants that this action should be defended by the Director of the USPTO, it should permit the
Complaint to be served upon the Director so that Pro-Football may have its appeal heard by a district
court, as is its statutory right under §1071(b). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 21(a) (“Misjoinder of parties is not
a ground for dismissing an action. On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just
terms, add … a party.”).
Such a resolution would be sensible for multiple reasons. First, the Director is located in
Alexandria, Virginia for jurisdictional purposes, so the action would remain before this Court.
Second, the Director has already been advised of this action. See Dkt. 9 (“Report on the Filing or
Determination of an Action Regarding a Patent or Trademark”). Third, Defendants repeatedly
suggest that the USPTO should defend this action. (See, e.g., Br. at 2, 8 n.7, 9, 14). If this Court
agrees, Defendants should not object to the Board participating before this Court in their stead.
