MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS
In June 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (“TTAB”), a component of the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), decided that the USPTO acted contrary
to federal trademark law when it issued six trademark registrations to Plaintiff Pro-Football, Inc.
(“PFI”), the owner of the Washington NFL team. The TTAB concluded that the marks were not
eligible for registration under 15 U.S.C. § 1502(a) because they contain matter that “may
disparage” Native Americans. 1 Accordingly, the TTAB scheduled the registrations for

The trademarks contain the term “redskin,” an ethnic slur used to refer to Native Americans.

cancellation by the Director of the USPTO. The TTAB acted after five Native American
individuals, the defendants in this action (“Blackhorse Defendants”), petitioned it to cancel the
registrations.
PFI could have appealed to the Federal Circuit, where the USPTO could have defended
the TTAB decision, but PFI declined to do so. See 15 U.S.C. § 1071(a). Instead, PFI filed this
civil action against the Blackhorse Defendants, under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4).
PFI’s dispute, however, is with the USPTO, not with the Blackhorse Defendants. PFI
alleges that the TTAB – not the Blackhorse Defendants – acted unlawfully by scheduling its
registrations for cancellation. Likewise, PFI seeks relief only against the USPTO – a declaratory
judgment to prevent the Director of the USPTO from carrying out the cancellations. PFI alleges
no conduct on the part of the Blackhorse Defendants other than filing a petition with the TTAB.
It does not allege that they acted unlawfully or tortiously. Nor does PFI allege that the
Blackhorse Defendants claim any interest in PFI’s trademarks or in similar trademarks. This
lawsuit will not affect the legal rights or obligations of the Blackhorse Defendants in any way.
As a result, the Complaint should be dismissed for the following two reasons:
•

The Blackhorse Defendants are not “parties in interest” who may be sued under 15
U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4); and

This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because there is no “Case or Controversy”
under Article III of the Constitution as between PFI and the Blackhorse Defendants.
BACKGROUND
A.

Trademark Registrations and the USPTO/TTAB

A trademark is a word, name, symbol or combination thereof that is used in commerce to
identify and distinguish the goods or services of one entity from the goods or services of others.
15 U.S.C. § 1127; Microstrategy, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 245 F.3d 335, 341 (4th Cir. 2001).
Trademark rights arise from use of a mark in commerce; government action is not required to
create protectable rights. See id.; see also Virginia Polytechnic Inst. v. Hokie Real Estate, 813 F.
Supp. 2d 745, 756 (W.D. Va. 2011).
The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1501 et seq., establishes a mechanism for owners of
trademarks to obtain federal registration for their marks. Registration creates certain evidentiary
presumptions and additional remedies in trademark enforcement actions, among other benefits,
that are not available for unregistered trademarks. See Complaint (“Compl.”) §§ 40-48. 2 To be
eligible for registration, a trademark must satisfy the criteria of Section 2 of the Lanham Act, 15
U.S.C. § 1052. These criteria include, among others, that the mark not consist of merely
descriptive or generic matter, not comprise wholly functional matter, not so resemble a third

2

The benefits of registering a mark include: (i) registration serves as prima facie evidence of the
validity of a mark, and of the registrant’s ownership of and exclusive right to use the mark (15
U.S.C. §§ 1057(b), 1115(a)) and after five years, these presumptions become “incontestable” (id.
§§ 1065, 1115(b)); (ii) in a federal infringement action, the owner of a registered mark may be
able to recover treble profits and attorneys’ fees (id. § 1117); (iii) registration of a mark is a
factor to consider in whether a mark is “famous” and therefore enjoys protection under the
Lanham Act’s anti-dilution provision (id. § 1125(c)); (iv) a registration may be filed with the
U.S. Customs Service to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods (id. § 1124); and (v) the
owner of a registered trademark can use the ® symbol (id. § 1111).

party’s mark as to likely cause consumer confusion, and – as relevant here – not contain matter
that “may disparage” persons or “bring them into contempt or disrepute.” 15 U.S.C. § 1052.
A trademark owner seeking registration must submit an application to the USPTO, which
is reviewed by a USPTO examining attorney. 15 U.S.C. § 1051. The examining attorney is
required to refuse registration of applications that do not meet the registration criteria of 15
U.S.C. § 1052. See 15 U.S.C. § 1062(b).
If an examining attorney refuses an application, the applicant may ask the agency to
reconsider by appealing to the TTAB. See 15 U.S.C. § 1070; Trademark Manual of Examining
Procedure (“TMEP”) §§ 705, 714, 715.03. 3 As noted, the TTAB is a component of the USPTO,
and consists of the Director of the USPTO, the Commissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for
Trademarks, and administrative judges appointed by the Director. 15 U.S.C. § 1067(b). The
TTAB sits in three-member panels to make its decisions. 37 C.F.R. §§ 2.129(a) & 2.142(e)(1).
The Lanham Act also creates a process for competitors and others to ask the USPTO to
review an examining attorney’s decision to issue a registration that they believe is contrary to 15
U.S.C. § 1052. For example, after the USPTO publishes notice (under 15 U.S.C. § 1062(a)) that
a trademark has been approved for registration by an examining attorney but before the
registration is final, “[a]ny person who believes he would be damaged by the registration” may
file an opposition to prevent the registration from being issued. 15 U.S.C. § 1063. Likewise – as
occurred here – “any person who believes that he is or will be damaged” by a registration that
has already been issued may petition the USPTO to cancel the registration. 15 U.S.C. § 1064.
The Lanham Act provides that the TTAB shall review oppositions and petitions to cancel

registrations on behalf of the USPTO. 15 U.S.C. § 1067(a) (“In every case of … opposition to
registration … or application to cancel the registration of a mark, the Director [of the USPTO]
shall give notice to all parties and shall direct a Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine
and decide the respective rights of registration.”).
B.

The TTAB Decides That The USPTO Must Cancel PFI’s
Registrations Because Its Marks Are Disparaging.

Between 1967 and 1990, the USPTO granted registrations to six trademarks owned by
PFI that contain the term “Redskins” or a derivation of that term. Compl. ¶ 21. In 1992,
pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1064, Suzan Shown Harjo and six other Native American leaders filed a
petition with the TTAB to cancel the registrations. Id. ¶ 16. In 1999, after reviewing the
evidence submitted by PFI and the Harjo petitioners, the TTAB decided that the USPTO should
never have issued the registrations in the first place because, contrary to 15 U.S.C. § 1052, PFI’s
trademarks contain matter (i.e., the term “redskins”) that “may disparage” Native Americans or
“bring them into contempt or disrepute.” Harjo v Pro-Football, Inc., 50 U.S.P.Q.2d 1705, 1999
WL 375907, at *48 (T.T.A.B. 1999); Compl. ¶ 17.
PFI then filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia, challenging the TTAB’s Harjo decision. The Harjo federal litigation featured two
trips to the D.C. Circuit, which ultimately held that the petition was barred by laches because the
Harjo petitioners waited too long after turning 18 years old to file their petition. See ProFootball, Inc. v. Harjo, 415 F.3d 44, 49-50 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (holding that Harjo petition was
barred by laches as to six petitioners and remanding for further consideration of laches as to the
remaining petitioner); Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo, 565 F.3d 880 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (final
petitioner also subject to laches), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 1025 (2009); Compl. ¶¶ 19, 25.

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 6 of 19 PageID# 86

In 2006, while the Harjo federal litigation was pending, five younger Native Americans - Amanda Blackhorse, Marcus Briggs-Cloud, Phillip Gover, Jillian Pappan and Courtney Tsotigh
(the “Blackhorse Defendants”) 4 – filed a new petition with the TTAB to cancel PFI’s
registrations, Blackhorse et al. v. Pro-Football, Inc., 111 U.S.P.Q.2d 1080, 2014 WL 2757516
(T.T.A.B. 2014). The TTAB suspended action on Blackhorse until the federal proceedings in
Harjo concluded. Compl. ¶ 22, 27.
On June 18, 2014, in Blackhorse, “[f]ollowing several years of discovery, motion
practice, submissions of evidence, final briefing, and oral argument,” the TTAB once again
concluded that the USPTO acted contrary to law between 1967 and 1990 when it granted
registrations to PFI for the six trademarks that contain “Redskins” or a derivative. Compl. ¶ 33.
As it had in 1999 in Harjo, the TTAB found that “redskin” was an ethnic slur during the relevant
time periods, and that the trademarks were ineligible for registration because they contain matter
that “may disparage” Native Americans or “bring them into contempt or disrepute.” Blackhorse,
111 U.S.P.Q.2d 1080, 2014 WL 2756516, at *1 (T.T.A.B. 2014). Accordingly, the TTAB
scheduled the registrations for cancellation by the USPTO. Compl. ¶ 33.
PFI’s trademark registrations have not yet been cancelled. Cancellation requires a
separate action by the Director of the USPTO. The Director does not cancel a registration until

Ms. Blackhorse is a member of the Navajo Nation; Mr. Briggs-Cloud is a member of the
Muscogee Nation of Florida; Mr. Gover is a member of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah; Ms.
Pappan is a member of the Omaha Tribe of Macy, Nebraska; and Ms. Tsotigh is a member of the
Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma.

any ensuing federal action has been resolved (or until after the time to file a federal action has
expired). 5
PFI contends that if the Director cancels its registrations, it will lose the benefits of
federal registration. See Compl. ¶¶ 40-48. PFI does not contend that it will forfeit its common
law rights to bring infringement and other enforcement actions to protect its unregistered
trademarks after its federal registrations are cancelled. See id. 6
C.

PFI Files This Action.

PFI had a right to appeal the TTAB decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, but opted not to do so. See 15 U.S.C. § 1071(a).
Instead, on August 14, 2014, PFI filed this civil action, purportedly pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
§ 1071(b). Compl. § 2. Under § 1071(b), following a TTAB proceeding that involved adverse
parties, a party “dissatisfied” with the TTAB decision may file a new civil action against “the
party in interest as shown by the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.” 15
U.S.C. §§ 1071(b)(1) &(4). An action under § 1071(b) is not an appeal, but a new civil action in
which the parties may introduce evidence with the district court conducting a de novo trial on the
same issues raised in the TTAB proceeding. Compl. ¶ 56; see also Swatch AG v. Beehive
Wholesale, LLC, 739 F.3d 150, 156 (4th Cir. 2014) (explaining that actions under 15 U.S.C. §

To the contrary, according to a statement issued by PFI, the TTAB decision “simply addresses
the team’s federal trademark registrations and the team will continue to own and be able to
protect its marks without the registrations.” Bart Hubbach, “Trademark Cancellation a Major
Blow to Redskins Nickname,” New York Post (June 18, 2014), available at

1071(b) are not appeals, but are new civil actions). The Director is not made a defendant to an
action under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4). 7
Here, PFI does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of the Blackhorse Defendants. PFI
does not allege that they breached a contract, committed a tort, or violated any law. Instead,
PFI’s allegations are directed solely against the USPTO and PFI seeks relief only against the
USPTO:
•

Counts I and II allege that the cancellation by the USPTO would be contrary to the
Lanham Act because the trademarks allegedly do not disparage Native Americans or
bring them into contempt or disrepute. Compl. ¶¶ 130-33.

•

Counts III and IV allege that cancellation by the USPTO would violate the Constitution
either because 15 U.S.C. § 1502(a) violates the First Amendment or because it is unduly
vague. Id. ¶¶ 134-39.

•

Counts V and VI allege that cancellation by the USPTO would violate the Fifth
Amendment either as a deprivation of property without due process or as a taking without
compensation. Id. ¶¶ 140-46.

•

Count VII alleges that cancellation by the USPTO would violate the Lanham Act because
the TTAB should not have entertained the Blackhorse petition because it was allegedly
not timely filed. Id. ¶¶ 147-48.

For relief, PFI seeks declaratory judgment that the TTAB’s action was either contrary to the
Lanham Act or unconstitutional, and an order preventing the USPTO from carrying out the
scheduled cancellation. Id. at 34-35 (Prayer For Relief).

7

In addition, following TTAB decisions that do not involve adverse parties, a “dissatisfied”
party may file a civil action against the Director of the USPTO. See 15 U.S.C. § 1701(b)(1), (3).
This might occur, for example, if the TTAB affirms the decision of an examining attorney to
refuse registration of a mark. See, e.g., Shammas v. Rea, 978 F. Supp. 2d 599 (E.D. Va. 2013).

ARGUMENT
Although PFI and the Blackhorse Defendants sharply disagree over the USPTO’s
decision to cancel PFI’s registrations, they have no justiciable dispute. PFI does not allege a
trademark ownership or infringement dispute or assert any other cause of action against the
Blackhorse Defendants. Rather, PFI’s dispute is with the USPTO. PFI alleges that it is the
USPTO – not the Blackhorse Defendants – that violated the Lanham Act and the Constitution,
and the relief PFI seeks is to prevent USPTO action. PFI seeks no relief against the Blackhorse
Defendants; this action will not affect any of the Blackhorse Defendants’ legal or economic
interests, regardless of its outcome.
As a result, this action should be dismissed because the Blackhorse Defendants are not
“parties in interest” against whom an action may be filed under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4). In
addition, there is no Article III “Case or Controversy” between PFI and the Blackhorse
Defendants and this action should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
PFI could have avoided these problems by appealing to the Federal Circuit under 15
U.S.C. § 1071(a), where the USPTO could have defended its decision on appeal. See, e.g., In re
Bose Corp., 180 F.3d 1240, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2009). PFI apparently made a strategic decision not
to appeal to the Federal Circuit, presumably because that Court has already rejected PFI’s
Constitutional arguments. See In re Fox, 702 F.3d 633, 634 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (“Because a refusal
has no bearing on the applicant’s ability to use the mark, we have held that [15 U.S.C.] § 1052(a)
does not implicate the First Amendment rights of trademark applicants”); Georgalis v. U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, 296 F. Appx. 14, 16 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (holding that USPTO’s
cancellation and refusal to reinstate patent was not a Taking under the Fifth Amendment); In re
Boulevard Entm’t, Inc., 334 F.3d 1336, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (rejecting First Amendment
challenge); In re Mavety Media Gr. Ltd., 33 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (same); In re

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 10 of 19 PageID# 90

McGinley, 660 F.2d 481, 484-85 (C.C.P.A. 1981) (rejecting argument that “scandalous” as used
in 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a) was unconstitutionally vague).
Whatever PFI’s reasons for avoiding the Federal Circuit, this action should be dismissed.
I.

The Complaint Should Be Dismissed Because The Defendants Are Not
“Parties In Interest” Under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4).
This action should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule

of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) or, alternatively, for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). An
action under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4) may be brought only against the “party in interest as shown
by the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office,” but the Blackhorse Defendants
are not “parties in interest.”
Indeed, the Blackhorse Defendants have no economic or legal interest in the subject
matter of this lawsuit. The Court’s ruling in this case will not affect any of their economic or
legal rights or obligations. They stand to gain nothing or lose nothing. PFI has not alleged that
the Blackhorse Defendants claim an ownership interest in PFI’s trademarks or in any other
potentially infringing trademarks. Although the Blackhorse Defendants might be pleased or
disappointed with the outcome of this case, that does not make them “parties in interest.”
A patent case, 3V, Inc. v. CIBA Specialty Chems. Corp., 587 F. Supp. 2d 641 (D. Del.
2008), illustrates that the Blackhorse Defendants are not “parties in interest.” See Swatch AG v.
Beehive Wholesale, LLC, 739 F.3d 150, 155-56 (4th Cir. 2014) (using case law interpreting
patent law to interpret similar provisions of the Lanham Act).

In 3V, the Board of Patent

Appeals and Interference (now known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board) decided that CIBA
was the first to invent an invention claimed in both CIBA’s and 3V’s patents, but that certain
claims in CIBA’s patent were unpatentable. Id. at 642. CIBA and 3V were both “dissatisfied”

- 10 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 11 of 19 PageID# 91

with different aspects of the Patent Board’s decisions, and each brought action under 35 U.S.C. §
146, the patent parallel to 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4).
3V subsequently disclaimed all ownership rights to its potentially conflicting patent and
moved to dismiss; CIBA opposed dismissal because it continued to seek reversal of the Patent
Board’s ruling that some of its claims were unpatentable and wanted a defendant against whom it
could litigate this issue. The Court, however, dismissed the action for lack of a Case or
Controversy under Article III, as a result of 3V’s disclaimer of interest in the patent. In its
decision, the Court explained that to be a “party in interest” under 35 U.S.C. § 146, a party must
have an actual economic interest in the patent or an allegedly infringing patent:
[35 U.S.C.] § 146 provides that ‘suit may be instituted against the party in
interest’…. Referring to parties “in interest,” the language of the statute
suggests that parties to a § 146 action must have some articulable reason
to participate in the dispute…. 3V’s disclaimer has resulted in dedication
of all interest in the patent to the public. Thus, there is no possibility that
3V retained some unknown equitable interest that would justify it
remaining in the case as a ‘proper’ party….
Id. at 647. Likewise, although PFI seeks reversal of the TTAB’s ruling that its trademarks are
unregistrable, it cannot maintain an action under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4) against the Blackhorse
Defendants who have no actual or alleged economic or legal interest in the trademarks. See also
Consumer Watchdog v. Wis. Alumni Research Found., 753 F.3d 1258 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding
that consumer group, with no economic or legal interest in disputed patent, lacked a sufficient
interest to litigate in federal court the PTAB’s decision not to invalidate a patent); Nachtman v.
Toulmin, 196 F. Supp. 367, 369 (S.D. Ohio 1961) (holding that “party in interest as shown by the
records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office” refers to the owner or assignee of the
patent at issue or a similar patent, and not the adverse party to proceedings before the Board of
Patent Interferences (precursor to the PTAB)).

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 12 of 19 PageID# 92

Similarly, in Hans C. Bick, Inc. v. Watson, 253 F.2d 344 (D.C. Cir. 1958), the Court
found that parties with no interest in a trademark whose registration was cancelled were not
“parties in interest” even though they had filed the petition to cancel. In Bick, three companies
successfully petitioned the Commissioner of Patents to cancel the registration of a certain
trademark-owner (Bick). Dissatisfied with the Commissioner’s decision, Bick filed an action in
district court against the Commissioner under 35 U.S.C. § 145 (1952), the precursor to currentday 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(3). 8 Bick, 253 F.2d at 344. The Commissioner moved to dismiss,
arguing that Bick should instead have brought action against the cancellation petitioners under
35 U.S.C. § 146 (1952), the precursor to current-day 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4). Id. at 345.
The D.C. Circuit disagreed. It held that Bick could not have brought action against the
cancellation petitioners because they were not a “party in interest” under 35 U.S.C. § 146 (1952).
The Court explained that the dispute over whether Bick’s trademark is eligible for registration is
a dispute between Bick and the agency:
[T]he only issue presented by the Commissioner’s decision and the
complaint is whether the initial registrations of [Bick’s] mark were
erroneously granted as a matter of law…. Such a dispute clearly is
primarily between [Bick] and the Commissioner….

8

At the time of Bick, the Lanham Act provided that a party to a cancellation proceeding
dissatisfied with a decision by the Commissioner could file an appeal with the Court of Customs
and Patents (predecessor to the Federal Circuit) or could file a civil action in district court under
35 U.S.C. §§ 145 and 146 (1952) against either the Commissioner (§ 145) or “the party in
interest as shown by the records of the Patent Office at the time of the decision complained of”
(§ 146). See 15 U.S.C. § 1071 (1952) (citing and incorporating 35 U.S.C. §§ 145 and 146 (1952)
(creating civil action to challenge patent rulings of the Patent Office)). In 1962, Congress struck
15 U.S.C. § 1071 and replaced it with language substantively similar to today’s version. See
Pub. Law 87-772 § 12 (1962). Thus, 35 U.S.C. §§ 145 and 146 (1952) are precursors to current
15 U.S.C. § 1071(b).

- 12 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 13 of 19 PageID# 93

Id. at 346. And further, the Court explained, a party dissatisfied with a cancellation decision
could bring action under 35 U.S.C. § 146 (1952) (precursor to current 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4))
only against “the party interest,” but the “[t]he petitioners for cancellation have never used or
registered [Bick’s] mark or a mark claimed to be similar.” Id. As with the Bick petitioners, the
Blackhorse Defendants “have never used or registered [PFI’s] mark or a mark claimed to be
similar,” and accordingly are not “parties in interest.”
Ordinarily, the adverse parties in an opposition or cancellation proceeding before the
TTAB are two businesses claiming rights to the same or similar trademarks. Thus, when a party
dissatisfied with a decision of the TTAB brings actions under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4), it is
usually involved in a dispute with a business that uses a similar trademark, with the parties often
joining claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition and other causes of action. See,
e.g., Swatch, 739 F.3d at 154 (noting that plaintiff joined claims for trademark infringement and
unfair competition against defendant); Zao Odessky Konjatschnyi Zawod v. SIA “Baltmark
Invest,” No. 1:12cv515 (JCC/JDD), 2014 WL 785295 (E.D. Va. Feb. 21, 2014) (describing
dispute between two claimants to same or similar marks); Vaad L’Hafotzas Sichos, Inc. v. Kehot
Publication Soc’y, 935 F. Supp. 2d 595 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (same); The Coryn Group II, LLC v.
O.C. Seacrets, Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d 468 (D. Md. 2012) (same); Tovaritch Spirits Int’l SA v.
Luxco, Inc., No. 4:11CV950JCH, 2012 WL 6652949 (E.D. Mo. Dec. 21, 2012) (same). Under
such typical circumstances, it is clear that the other entity using a similar and possibly infringing
trademark is a “party in interest.” This case is not the ordinary case. Here, the petition to cancel
was not filed by a business with a trademark dispute, but by five individuals who sought
cancellation on public interest grounds based on a “sparingly used statutory provision … which
is rarely invoked to cancel any registered trademarks….” Compl. ¶ 3.

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 14 of 19 PageID# 94

Accordingly, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the Blackhorse Defendants
are not “parties in interest” under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4), and the statute therefore does not give
PFI the right to file suit against them. 9
II.

This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Because There Is No “Case or Controversy.”
Even if the Blackhorse Defendants are considered “parties in interest” under 15 U.S.C. §

1071(b)(4), this action should be dismissed because there is no “Case or Controversy” as
required for this Court to exercise jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution. Rather, PFI’s
“Case or Controversy” is with the USPTO. As noted, PFI alleges that the USPTO acted
unlawfully under the Lanham Act and the Constitution, and PFI seeks declaratory judgment
relief directed towards the USPTO only. PFI seeks no relief against the Blackhorse Defendants,
and this action does not implicate any legal interests of the Blackhorse Defendants.
“Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding
actual ‘Cases’ or ‘Controversies.’” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2656 (2013).
Absent a case or controversy, the Court lacks jurisdiction and must dismiss. In a declaratory
judgment action such as this one, to satisfy the “actual controversy” requirement, a court must
determine “whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial
controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality
to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549

9

Whether PFI’s failure to file suit against a “party in interest” is a jurisdictional failure or a
failure to state a claim, the result is the same, dismissal. See Morrison v. Nat’l Australia Bank,
Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 254 (2010). If viewed as a failure to state a claim, then the following “Case
or Controversy” argument should be considered first. See Steel Co. v. Citizens For A Better
Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 98-102 (2010) (stating that jurisdictional issues should be considered
first in a motion to dismiss).

U.S. 118, 127 (2007). PFI bears “the burden of establishing the existence of an actual case or
controversy.” Cardinal Chem. Co. v. Morton Int’l, 508 U.S. 83, 95 (1993).
To satisfy this burden, PFI must show that “the dispute ‘is definite and concrete, touching
the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.’” White v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co.
of Pittsburgh, 913 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300
U.S. 227, 240-41 (1937)) (emphasis added). “The presence of a disagreement, however sharp
and acrimonious it may be, is insufficient by itself to meet Art. III’s requirements.” Diamond v.
Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 62 (1986). Both parties must have a judicially cognizable interest in the
disagreement. See id. at 56, 64-69 (pediatrician lacked sufficient interest to defend
constitutionality of state anti-abortion laws). Here, the dispute does not touch upon the “legal
relations” of PFI and the Blackhorse Defendants, and they do not have “adverse legal interests.”
White, 913 F.2d at 167. PFI and the Blackhorse Defendants have no legal relations with one
another, just a disagreement as to whether PFI’s trademarks may disparage Native Americans.
The Federal Circuit’s recent decision in Consumer Watchdog v. Wis. Alumni Research
Found., 753 F.3d 1258 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“WARF”), makes plain that this action does not present
a case or controversy. In WARF, a consumer group requested reexamination by the Patent Trial
and Appeal Board of a patent for embryonic stem cells owned by the Wisconsin Alumni
Research Foundation, seeking to cancel the patent on grounds that it was not patentable
(analogous to the Blackhorse TTAB petition to cancel PFI’s registrations as ineligible for
registration). The PTAB disagreed with the consumer group, finding patentability. See 753
F.3d. at 1259. The consumer group appealed to the Federal Circuit, which then dismissed the
appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Court ruled that there was no Article III case or controversy
due to the consumer group’s lack of legal or economic interest in the patent. See id. at 1261-62.

- 15 -

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 16 of 19 PageID# 96

The consumer group did “not allege that it is engaged in any activity involving human
embryonic stems cells that could form the basis for an infringement claim. It [did] not allege that
it intends to engage in such activity. Nor [did] it allege that it is an actual or prospective
licensee, or that it has any other connection to the … patent or the claimed subject matter.” Id. at
1261. Rather, the consumer group raised the issue with the PTAB solely on public interest
grounds, concerned that the patent could deter scientific and medical stem cell research. Id. at
1260. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit ruled that consumer group did not suffer a sufficient
injury to a legally protectable interest for it to have standing to appeal. See id. at 1261-63.
Just as the consumer group in WARF sought cancellation of a patent on public interest
grounds, the Blackhorse Defendants sought to cancel trademark registrations for public interest
reasons. The Blackhorse Defendants’ legal and economic interests are not affected by the
registration cancellations and they will not be affected by this litigation. Moreover, it makes no
difference that the consumer group in WARF was seeking federal court review, while the
Blackhorse Defendants have been hauled involuntarily into Court. There is no “Case or
Controversy” if a party lacks a stake in the outcome, regardless of which side of the “v.” it is
found. If there is no case or controversy when Party “A” sues Party “B” over a given matter,
there is no case or controversy if Party “B” were to sue Party “A” over the same matter. Like
plaintiffs, defendants must also have a cognizable interest to create a case or controversy.
“Standing to sue or defend is an aspect of the case or controversy requirement.” Arizonans for
Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 64 (1997). And, “standing to defend on appeal in the
place of an original defendant, no less than standing to sue, demands that the litigant possess a
direct stake in the outcome.” Id. (internal quotation omitted); see also Diamond, 476 U.S. at 56
(“Because a private party whose own conduct is neither implicated nor threatened by a criminal

statute has no judicially cognizable interest in the statute’s defense, we dismiss the appeal for
want of jurisdiction”).
Indeed, in 3V, Inc. v. CIBA Specialty Chems. Corp., 587 F. Supp. 2d 641 (D. Del. 2008),
the parties were aligned in the same way as PFI and the Blackhorse Defendants, and the Court
dismissed due to lack of a Case or Controversy. As summarized above, in 3V, the Board of
Patent Appeals and Interference (now the PTAB) decided that CIBA was the first to invent an
invention claimed in both CIBA’s and 3V’s patents, but that certain claims in CIBA’s patent
were unpatentable. Id. at 642. 3V and CIBA then filed action against each other under 35
U.S.C. § 146 seeking to overturn the parts of the Patent Board’s decision with which they were
“dissatisfied.” Thereafter, 3V disclaimed all interests in its allegedly infringing patent and
moved to dismiss for lack of a Case or Controversy. CIBA opposed the motion to dismiss
because, although there was no longer a dispute as to priority of invention, CIBA continued to
want to litigate the Patent Board’s decision regarding patentability. See id. at 643-47.
The Court held that, with 3V’s disclaimer, there was no case or controversy and
dismissed: “CIBA fails to explain why 3V, or anyone else, should continue to oppose CIBA in
its efforts to demonstrate [patentability], or what 3V’s ‘legally cognizable’ interest is in this
issue.” Id. at 645. Further, “[a]t this stage, CIBA merely asks the Court to correct what it
perceives to be an erroneous decision on the part of the Board, which is not a party to any of the
actions before the Court.” Id. at 646. The Blackhorse Defendants are in the same position as
3V. They have no interest in any potentially infringing trademark, and therefore lack a
cognizable legal interest as to the registrability of PFI’s trademarks.

Case 1:14-cv-01043-GBL-IDD Document 19 Filed 09/22/14 Page 18 of 19 PageID# 98

Accordingly, even if the Court holds that the Blackhorse Defendants are “parties in
interest” under 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(4), it should dismiss this action for lack of jurisdiction
because there is no case or controversy under Article III.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss should be granted, and the
Complaint should be dismissed.
