INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, Avocent Redmond Corp. (“Avocent”), has rushed into Court seeking a

protective order governing treatment of the parties’ confidential information without soliciting
any input from Rose Electronics (“Rose”), the party whose products and confidential information
are at stake. Avocent did this despite Rose’s pending motion to intervene, and despite the
defendant’s specific request that Avocent seek Rose’s input. Avocent clearly wanted a ruling on
this issue before Rose could have its say, and with good reason: Avocent has failed to apprise
the Court of the dire consequences Rose will suffer from Avocent’s requested order.
By this cross-motion, Rose seeks entry of a more balanced protective order, which differs
from Avocent’s proposed order only by the inclusion of a neutral “patent prosecution”
provision.1 The proposed provision simply and logically prevents anyone (on either side of the
case) who receives discovery information designated at the highest level of confidentiality from
prosecuting patent applications before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“Patent Office”)
on the subject technology for a limited period of time. This type of provision ensures legitimate
competition among the parties and has been approved by the overwhelming majority of federal
courts that have considered the issue.
Although this provision was previously considered by the U.S. District Court in Seattle in
a now stayed case between Rose and Avocent, the circumstances have changed dramatically
since the Seattle court considered the issue: three of the patents at issue in this case (and all the
patents at issue in Seattle) are now undergoing reexamination in the Patent Office.
Consequently, and in contrast to the Seattle proceedings, Avocent now has the opportunity to
1

The only other change between Avocent’s and Rose’s proposed protective orders is that
Rose uses the term “Confidential” rather than “Protected” for the lower level of confidentiality,
(cont.. . .)

amend the claims of the three patents that are being asserted in both lawsuits. To make matters
worse, the very lawyers representing Avocent in this lawsuit are also representing Avocent
before the Patent Office in the reexamination proceedings. Thus, under Avocent’s proposal, its
lawyers will gain access to highly confidential technical information about Rose’s products,
while simultaneously re-writing the very patent claims being litigated to target those same
products. Simply put, it would be manifestly unfair—indeed unthinkable—for Avocent to have
access to Rose’s secret technical documents while re-writing the very patents that those products
are already accused of infringing.
In view of this serious competitive harm to Rose, and based on the authorities and
testimonial evidence set forth herein, Avocent’s motion should be denied, and Rose’s proposed
protective order entered for this case.
II.

BACKGROUND
A.

The KVM Switch Market and Avocent’s Decade-Long Attempt to
Assert a Patent Monopoly Over It.

Avocent and Rose are competing manufacturers of keyboard-video-mouse (KVM)
switches. (Docket No. 1, Complaint ¶¶ 2, 6.) In 1995, Avocent’s predecessor tried to gain a
legal monopoly on a portion of the KVM switch market by applying for a patent relating to
certain KVM switch technologies. In the following thirteen years, Avocent then took the 1995
application and filed one after another “continuation” applications.

These continuation

applications would permit Avocent to keep “tweaking” the claims in each successive application
as it learned more and more about the way the market was developing over a period of several
years, with each of the ensuing applications still able to gain the benefit of the 1995 application’s

so that the labels in this case conform to those previously used in the parties’ related Seattle
litigation.

filing date. Amazingly, Avocent has a continuation application still pending from its thirteenyear old parent application.
From that 1995 parent application, Avocent has already obtained at least six patents,
including all four patents at issue in this litigation. (See Exh. 1.)2 Avocent sued Rose in 1998 in
Seattle after obtaining the first issued patent from this still-continuing string of applications.
After having a motion for summary judgment of invalidity filed against it, Avocent dropped the
suit against Rose in 1999. (Dowler Decl. ¶ 2.) Avocent then went back to the Patent Office to
try to obtain more “attack-proof” patents that it could then assert against its competitors. During
that period, it also sued and ultimately settled with another competitor (Raritan Computer) (see
Exh. 2). Then, with several more patents and cash in hand, Avocent trained its sights back on
Rose, suing Rose again in Seattle in 2006, asserting several of the “new and improved” siblings
from the 1995 parent application (Patent Nos. 5,884,096, 6,112,264, and 7,113,978), all of which
are at issue in this lawsuit as well. (See Exh. 3.)
In October 2007, the Seattle court stayed the 2006 litigation because the Patent Office
had determined that there were substantial new questions as to the patentability of all three
patents-in-suit, and had instituted proceedings to re-examine those patents. (Dowler Decl. ¶ 4.)
Frustrated by its repeated inability to use its contrived stable of patents to shut Rose out
of the KVM market, Avocent seeks—by filing the instant case against Rose’s customer, the
United States—a third bite at Rose’s documents and money.

Avocent’s Law Firm’s Current Proceedings Before the Patent Office.

In the stayed Seattle case (see Exh. 3) and in this case, Avocent’s lead attorneys are from
the 7-lawyer firm of Davidson Berquist Jackson & Gowdy (“DBJG”).3 (See Exh. 4.) DBJG
lawyers are also responsible for Avocent’s proceedings before the Patent Office (i.e., patent
prosecution). (See Exh. 5.) For example, they were counsel of record listed on the most
recently-issued patent at issue in this lawsuit (No. 7,113,978). (See Exh. 6.) They are also
counsel of record in the three currently-pending reexamination proceedings before the Patent
Office. (See Exhs. 7-9.) Rose has already filed a request with the Patent Office seeking
reexamination of the fourth patent at issue in this case (Patent No. 6,345,323) (Dowler Decl. at ¶
5), and no doubt DBJG will appear for Avocent in the newly-filed reexamination request as well.
DBJG is also counsel of record concerning the patent application still pending in the Patent
Office from the same 1995 parent application. (See Exh. 10.)
C.

Rose’s Proposed Prosecution Provision.

Rose proposes that the following language be added to paragraph 7 of Avocent’s
proposed protective order:
Proprietary Information designated as ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY can be
disclosed to those persons designated in ¶¶ 7(a)-7(e) and 7(g)-7(k) only on the
condition that any person who receives access to such information shall have no
involvement whatsoever, from and after the date of first disclosure of any such
information to such person, in the prosecution of any patent application that
involves KVM switch technology for a period of one year after the conclusion of
this litigation (including the exhaustion of all subsequent appeals). Patent
prosecution shall include drafting, reviewing, editing, or supervising the drafting
or preparation of patent applications, claims, specifications, amendments,
responses to office actions and any other materials submitted to the United States
Patent & Trademark Office or any other patent authority elsewhere in the world,
3

Interestingly, these same lawyers were counsel for Cybex Computer Products Corp., a
co-defendant of Rose’s in the 1998 Seattle litigation. In other words, like Rose, they were
adverse to Avocent in that case and argued that the exact same Avocent patent application that
spawned the four patents-in-suit was invalid.

as well as identifying or evaluating potential inventions, participating in the
decision to file patent applications or consulting on any of the foregoing matters
with others performing any of these activities.
III.

ISSUE
Should Avocent’s lawyers be permitted access to Rose’s confidential and trade secret

materials and simultaneously be permitted to represent Avocent before the Patent Office, thereby
creating a situation where they can amend the terms of Avocent’s currently-asserted patent
claims in an attempt to cover Rose’s technology?
IV.

ARGUMENT
Avocent’s proposed protective order permits its attorneys to see Rose’s confidential

technical documents and simultaneously be involved in reexamination and prosecution
proceedings where they can amend the very patents in this suit to precisely target Rose’s
products.

Rose’s proposed protective order protects against this misuse of its confidential

technical information by using a widely-accepted and neutral “patent prosecution” provision.
Because Avocent and Rose are direct competitors, and because the risk of the use (inadvertent or
otherwise) of Rose’s trade secret and confidential technical information by Avocent’s attorneys
in the Patent Office proceedings is both unavoidable and high, and because the prejudice to Rose
is so great, fairness requires entry of Rose’s proposed protective order.
A.

General Principles

The Federal Circuit, as well as a vast majority of other courts across the country, has
specifically adopted protective orders including prosecution provisions of the type Rose now
seeks. In U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States, the Federal Circuit held that protective orders
denying lawyers’ access to an adversary’s confidential documents are appropriate when there is
“an unacceptable opportunity for inadvertent disclosure.” 730 F.2d 1465, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
Whether such an unacceptable opportunity exists must be determined “on the basis of each

5
DM_US:21301878_1

Case 1:08-cv-00069-LSM

Document 24

Filed 06/23/2008

Page 14 of 37

individual counsel’s actual activity and relationship with the party represented.” Id. at 1469.
Elaborating on U.S. Steel, the Ninth Circuit held that the U.S. Steel standard “requires the . . .
court to examine factually all the risks and safeguards surrounding inadvertent disclosure by any
counsel . . . .” Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., 960 F.2d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir. 1992)
(emphasis added).
B.

There is an Unavoidable Risk that Avocent’s Patent Prosecution
Attorneys Will Inadvertently Use Rose’s Confidential Information In
Amending Claims in Patents that Avocent Is Currently Asserting
Against Rose.

Protective orders prohibiting a patentee’s patent prosecution attorneys from seeing an
accused infringer’s confidential business and product information are commonplace.

As

explained below, where, as here, the specific circumstances and facts maximize both the
likelihood of inadvertent disclosure and the magnitude of the prejudice flowing from it, and
where Avocent has taken no steps to effectively safeguard against such inadvertent disclosure,
such a provision is necessary.
1.

Patent Prosecution Provisions Generally

“[I]t is very difficult for the human mind to compartmentalize and selectively suppress
information once learned, no matter how well-intentioned the effort may be to do so.” FTC v.
Exxon Corp., 636 F.2d 1336, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 1980). For this very reason, courts applying the
U.S. Steel holding to patent cases routinely enter protective orders preventing one party’s patent
prosecution attorneys from being able to see its adversary’s confidential technical documents.
See, e.g.:
Presidio Components, Inc. v. American Technical Ceramics Corp., ___ F. Supp.
2d ___, 2008 WL 608407 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 4, 2008) (Exh. 11)
Infosint S.A. v. H. Lundbeck A.S., No. 06 CIV 2869 LAK RLE, 2007 WL

Motorola, Inc. v. Interdigital Tech. Corp., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20714, *19 (D.
Del. 1994) (Exh. 18)
The reason that the majority of courts addressing this issue concur that “patent
prosecution prohibitions” in protective orders are appropriate is because patent prosecution
attorneys’ activities put them in a unique position to “develop a patent prosecution strategy that
will bring more of [its adversary’s] products within the scope of [their client’s] patents.”
Presidio Components, 2008 WL 608407 at *3 (Exh. 11). Patent prosecution counsel thus come
within one of the specific situations mentioned by the U.S. Steel court as creating and
“unacceptable opportunity” for inadvertent disclosure: situations where the person seeking
access to a competitor’s confidential documents is involved in “competitive decision-making.”
See U.S. Steel, 730 F.2d at 1468 (“In a particular case, e.g., where in-house counsel are involved

7
DM_US:21301878_1

Case 1:08-cv-00069-LSM

in competitive decision-making, it may well be that a party seeking access should . . . be denied
access” despite the need for access).4
Patent prosecution is competitive decision-making personified.

(See generally,

Declaration of Michael L. Lynch.) Patents confer upon their owners the right to exclude all
competitors from making, using, or selling the claimed invention. See, e.g., Biotechnology
Indus. Org. v. District of Columbia, 496 F.3d 1362, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). “Patentees value the
right to exclude others in part because the ability to foreclose competitors from making, using,
and selling the invention may allow them an opportunity to obtain above-market profits during
the patent’s term.” Id. (emphasis added); see generally Transparent-Wrap Mach. Corp. v. Stokes
& Smith Co., 329 U.S. 637, 643 67 S. Ct. 610, 614 (1947) (“A patent . . . carries for the statutory
period ‘a right to be free from competition in the practice of the invention.’”); Mercoid Corp. v.
Mid-Continent Inv. Co., 320 U.S. 661, 665, 64 S. Ct. 268, 271 (1944) (same). Patent prosecution
attorneys’ ability to amend or modify the claims of an alleged patented invention during
prosecution or reexamination puts them at the very center of competitive decisions of how to
define the scope of the right to exclude as much competition as possible. See, e.g., Superior
Fireplace Co. v. Majestic Prods. Co., 270 F.3d 1358, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (“The scope of a
patent claim is its very essence, and that with which the patentee and any competitors are most
concerned.”)
Because patents confer the right to exclude competition altogether, it is no surprise that
the majority of courts agree that patent prosecution attorneys are engaged in activities where
4

The U.S. Steel court noted that “‘competitive decisionmaking’ . . . would appear
serviceable as shorthand for a counsel’s activities, association, and relationship with a client that
are such as to involve counsel’s advice and participation in any or all of the client’s decisions
(pricing, product design, etc.) made in light of similar or corresponding information about a
competitor.”) 730 F.2d at 1468 n.3.

“unacceptable opportunit[ies] for inadvertent disclosure” exist, and it is therefore appropriate
under U.S. Steel to prohibit them from seeing a competitor’s confidential documents. See, e.g.,
Presidio Components, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2008 WL 608407 at *7 (“Humphrey is involved in
competitive decision-making for Presidio. . . . By prosecuting patents for Presidio, Humphrey
would have had to make decisions involving scope and emphasis, such as drafting claims to read
on new products and new directions ‘where [a party] projects sales to be more critical.’”) (Exh.

The Facts and Circumstances Here Indicate a High Risk of
Both Inadvertent Disclosure and Substantial Prejudice to
Rose.

Avocent’s patent prosecution attorneys are more deeply steeped in a long-term, close
relationship with Avocent in their efforts to exclude competition through patents than a typical
patent attorney retained only on an as-needed basis.

Attorney Davidson averred in his

declaration in the Seattle case that he has “been outside patent counsel to Avocent Corporation
and its affiliates for almost 10 years” and that he has “handled, and [he] continues to handle,
dozens of patent applications directed to the field of KVM switches for Avocent Corporation and
its affiliates.” (Exh. 5 at ¶ 3.) In so doing, certainly Mr. Davidson would adhere to his firm’s
policy, stated on its website, to “work with our clients to develop and implement the legal
strategies necessary to protect their business goals” and “always with an eye towards advancing
our clients’ objectives.” See http://www.davidsonberquist.com (emphasis added). These sorts of

activities, coupled with a patent prosecution relationship of this duration and closeness, present
an unacceptable risk that Rose’s confidential information will be misused during Avocent’s
patent prosecution activities. See, e.g., Andrx Pharmaceuticals, 236 F.R.D. at 587 (“Mr. Endres
has prosecuted patents on behalf of Andrx for twelve years. The extent of his relationship with
Andrx suggests that he actively participates in competitive decision-making.”)
Specifically, Avocent’s patent prosecution attorneys are currently working on all three of
the reexamination proceedings that are underway (see Exhs. 7-9) and which—significantly—
concern three of the four patents that Avocent is asserting against Rose in this case. See, e.g.,
MercExchange, 467 F. Supp. 2d at 624-25 & n.23 (agreeing with courts that had held that there
was an unacceptable risk of inadvertent disclosure where patentee’s litigation counsel was
simultaneously representing patentee in reexamination proceedings concerning those patents).
In addition, Avocent’s patent counsel is also currently representing Avocent on yet another
pending application continuing from the initial 1995 Avocent application that has given rise to
the four patents-in-suit. See Mikohn Gaming, 50 USPQ2d at 1786 (Exh. 17) (litigation counsel
was in an “untenable position” where counsel was simultaneously prosecuting applications
related to the patents-in-suit; bar imposed).
Rather than disclose and address these facts in its motion, Avocent instead argues that the
judge in the Seattle case made a factual “finding that Avocent’s counsel was not engaged in
competitive decision-making” (Avocent Mot. at 2) and suggests that this Court should simply
parrot that ruling (see id. at 4). The Seattle judge, however, made no such finding. Rather, she
noted that the defendants “have not offered any evidence that suggests that [Avocent’s patent
prosecution attorneys] advise Avocent in its ‘competitive decisionmaking.’” Avocent Redmond
Corp. v. Rose Electronics, Inc., 242 F.R.D. 574, 579 (W.D. Wash. 2007). Moreover, irrespective

Case 1:08-cv-00069-LSM

Page 19 of 37

of what the facts were over a year ago, it has since become clear that Avocent’s patent attorneys
are indeed engaged in competitive decision-making directed specifically at squelching
competition by Rose through proceedings in the Patent Office.
The facts before this Court show that Avocent’s attorneys are now representing Avocent
in ongoing proceedings before the Patent Office concerning three of the very patents asserted
here—proceedings in which they will be permitted to propose amendments to the patent claims
asserted in this case. And yet, while they are in this unique position to re-write patent claims
that they are actively litigating against Rose, they would propose that they simultaneously be
permitted to use their status as litigation counsel to review Rose’s confidential technical
materials, describing the operation of the very products that they hope to cover with the claims
that they are actively re-writing.

In addition, there is substantial proof—including from

Avocent’s attorney’s own declaration—that Avocent’s patent prosecution attorneys have indeed
been integrally and closely involved in Avocent’s competitive decision-making for nearly 10
years. (See Exhs. 2, 5, and 6.) These specific activities, particularly in light of the length and
closeness of patent prosecution counsel’s relationship with Avocent, weigh heavily in favor of
such a prophylactic provision. Cf. U.S. Steel, 730 F.2d at 1468 (protective order should be
“developed in light of the particular counsel’s relationship and activities, not solely on a
counsel’s status as in-house or retained”).
The impossible situation in which Avocent’s lawyers would place themselves is easily
illustrated. Consider Avocent’s lawyer sitting down, in the pending Patent Office reexamination
proceedings, to re-write the claims of the patents-in-suit that are being litigated in this case.
Under Avocent’s proposed protective order, that lawyer in his litigation capacity will have
already had access to and reviewed highly confidential documents from Rose describing the

11
DM_US:21301878_1

Case 1:08-cv-00069-LSM

Document 24

Filed 06/23/2008

Page 20 of 37

detailed operation of Rose’s accused products. Thus, for any revision he makes to the patent
claims, he will already know how it would affect Avocent’s infringement case against Rose. In
such a situation, which is unfortunately very real, Avocent’s lawyer cannot help but misuse
Rose’s confidential information to Rose’s detriment, because he cannot make himself “forget”
how Rose’s products operate while re-writing the patent claims. See FTC v. Exxon, 636 F.2d at
1350 (“[I]t is very difficult for the human mind to compartmentalize and selectively suppress
information once learned, no matter how well-intentioned the effort may be to do so.”). Any
claim amendment he makes would be made in light of that knowledge. Avocent’s lawyers
should not be able to use their litigation role to gain access to a competitor’s secret information
and then use it to enhance their patent portfolio in a way that harms that competitor.
In support of its opposition and cross-motion, Rose submits the Declaration of Michael
L. Lynch, a former law professor and twenty-seven year patent law practitioner with extensive
experience as both in-house and outside counsel for high-tech companies, whose career has
focused on patent prosecution activities. As Mr. Lynch states, a patent is a way for a company to
obtain an advantage over its competitors, by writing the broadest valid claims that cover the
competitive landscape as best possible. (Lynch Decl. at ¶¶ 10-11.) Patent draftspersons often
seek out publicly available information concerning competitors’ products when drafting patent
claims on behalf of a client, and importantly, seeing such information permits the attorney to
write claims that he might not have thought to write on his own. (Lynch Decl. at ¶¶ 12-13.)
Thus, Mr. Lynch’s declaration demonstrates that which the case law naturally confirms—that
patent prosecution is a key form of competitive decision-making.

(Lynch Decl. at ¶ 14.)

Further, it provides an example of the unfair advantage that Avocent could obtain if permitted to
have access to Rose’s confidential technical information while re-writing the claims of the

12
DM_US:21301878_1

Case 1:08-cv-00069-LSM

Document 24

Page 21 of 37

patents-in-suit: it would enable Avocent’s lawyers to write patent claims that are more closely
tailored to Rose’s products than they could write without access to that secret information.
This is not a dispute about the theoretical possibility of a situation possibly arising where
inadvertent disclosure could hurt Rose. As set forth in the declaration of Peter Macourek, the
founder and one of the owners of Rose, Rose’s business would be seriously harmed if Avocent’s
patent prosecution attorneys used Rose’s confidential information to specifically target Rose’s
products with the patent claims they are currently prosecuting in various Patent Office
proceedings—even if Rose were ultimately to prove, at the end of litigation, that the patents
were unenforceable because of such wrongful conduct. (Declaration of Peter Macourek at ¶¶ 47.)
V.

CONCLUSION
When a patent lawyer is specifically trying to craft patent claims to cover a competitor’s

product, but at the same time has access to the competitor’s secret technical documents through
litigation, the potential for competitive harm is clear. The facts here present the prototypical
case for a patent prosecution bar in the protective order:
•

Avocent and Rose compete in the KVM switch market;

•

Avocent has been engaged in a decade-long mission to use patent procurement
and litigation to hinder Rose and other competitors in the KVM switch market;

•

The same small law firm that represents Avocent in this litigation also represents
Avocent in ongoing patent prosecution proceedings;

•

Avocent’s lawyers have worked closely with Avocent to use patents to further
Avocent’s competitive goals for over 10 years;

•

The ongoing patent prosecution proceedings in which Avocent’s litigation
lawyers are involved concern three of the patents-in-suit and one additional
application from the same patent family; and

•

The prejudice and harm that such disclosure would work upon Rose is substantial.

Accordingly, Rose respectfully requests that the Court enter a protective order that prohibits any
lawyer engaging in patent prosecution activities concerning KVM switches from having access
to any documents another party has marked “Attorneys’ Eyes Only.”
A proposed protective order—which is agreed-to except for this provision—is attached.

party has had an opportunity to review and designate such documents in the manner previously
explained.
With regard to non-written material, such as recordings, magnetic media, photographs
and things, the designation of any information as CONFIDENTIAL or ATTORNEYS EYES
ONLY for purposes of this Protective Order shall be made by affixing a CONFIDENTIAL or
ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY designation to the material, or a container for the material, in any
suitable manner at the time of copying (if any).
4.

Designation of Depositions. Deposition or other oral testimony given in this

case may be designated as CONFIDENTIAL or ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY by any party or
third party either (a) during the deposition or proceeding during which the testimony is given, or
(b) by written notice to the court reporter and to all counsel of record, within five (5) days of
receipt, either by mail or email, of the deposition transcript. Unless otherwise ordered by the
Court, pending the expiration of this five (5) day period, all parties and persons shall treat the
testimony as if it has been designated ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY. Unless otherwise ordered
by the Court, the designating party shall have the right to have all persons, except the witness, his
or her counsel, the court reporter, and such other persons authorized to receive the designating
party’s Proprietary Information pursuant to this Protective Order, excluded from a deposition or
proceeding, or any portion thereof, before the taking therein of testimony that has been so
designated. The court reporter shall mark the cover of the original and all copies of the transcript
or the portion of the transcript containing testimony designated as either CONFIDENTIAL or
ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY with the appropriate legend.

preclude a party or a third party from later changing that designation and notifying the other
parties in writing of that change; provided, however, that it shall not be deemed a breach of this
Order for any action to have been taken by a party or its counsel with respect to such information
consistent with the original designation of such information prior to receipt of such notice. A
party receiving such written notice shall make every reasonable effort to retrieve any such
materials from persons not authorized to receive them pursuant to this Protective Order and to
avoid any further unauthorized disclosure. Any party that changes the designation of any
materials under this Order shall timely provide the other parties to this action with new copies of
the materials with the new designation(s).

and the staff of such attorneys to whom it is necessary that the information be shown for
purposes of this litigation.
Proprietary Information designated as ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY can be disclosed to
those persons designated in ¶¶ 7(a)-7(e) and 7(g)-7(k) only on the condition that any person who
receives access to such information shall have no involvement whatsoever, from and after the
date of first disclosure of any such information to such person, in the prosecution of any patent
application that involves KVM switch technology for a period of one year after the conclusion of
this litigation (including the exhaustion of all subsequent appeals). Patent prosecution shall
include drafting, reviewing, editing, or supervising the drafting or preparation of patent
applications, claims, specifications, amendments, responses to office actions and any other
materials submitted to the United States Patent & Trademark Office or any other patent authority
elsewhere in the world, as well as identifying or evaluating potential inventions, participating in
the decision to file patent applications or consulting on any of the foregoing matters with others
performing any of these activities.
This Protective Order has no effect upon and shall not apply to (1) any party’s use of its
own Proprietary Information for any purpose, or (2) any party’s use of documents or other
information developed or obtained independently of discovery in this action for any purpose.
Nothing herein shall bar or otherwise restrict an attorney, who is a qualified recipient
under the terms of paragraph 7(b) of this Protective Order, from rendering advice to his or her
client with respect to this action, and in the course thereof, from generally relying upon his or her
examination of Proprietary Information. In rendering such advice or in other communications
with the client, the attorney shall not disclose any Proprietary Information of another party or

third party where such disclosure would not otherwise be permitted under the terms of this
Protective Order.
8.

Approval of Experts. A party seeking to disclose another party’s Proprietary

Information to an outside expert shall serve such other party with a copy of the Undertaking
attached hereto as “Exhibit A” signed by the expert, along with the expert’s current resume,
identifying (by employer and position) all past and current employment relating to his or her
field of expertise, including employment as a consultant. The party receiving such Undertaking
and resume shall have ten (10) calendar days after such service within which to object to such
disclosure. Failure to object within this period shall be deemed approval. If the parties are
unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after service of an objection, the party objecting
to disclosure to an expert shall raise its objection with the Court within fifteen (15) calendar days
of such service of the objection. Failure to raise such objection with the Court within this period
shall be deemed approval. Any party objecting to disclosure to an expert under this Protective
Order shall bear the burden of proving that it will be harmed by such disclosure and that the
protections of this Order are insufficient to reasonably protect such parties’ proprietary interests.
9.

Filing Proprietary Information. All papers, documents and transcripts

containing or revealing the substance of Proprietary Information shall be filed under seal through
the Court’s CM/ECF system. Without prior written order of this Court, the Clerk of the Court
shall not permit access to materials filed under seal to anyone other than counsel for the parties.
10.

Inadvertent Disclosure of Privileged or Immune Materials. RCFC

26(b)(5)(B) governs the inadvertent or mistaken production of information that is subject to a
claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material. The inadvertent disclosure of

information that is privileged or otherwise immune from discovery shall not, by itself, constitute
a waiver of the privilege or immunity.
11.

Disclosure of Proprietary Information to Unauthorized Person(s). If

Proprietary Information is disclosed to any person other than those authorized to receive such
information by this Order, the party responsible for the disclosure shall immediately inform the
designating party of all pertinent facts relating to such disclosure and shall make every
reasonable effort to prevent disclosure by each unauthorized person who received such
information and to obtain the return of such information.
12.

Conclusion of the Litigation. Within ninety (90) days after entry of a final

judgment or dismissal with prejudice in this litigation (including appeals or petitions for review)
finally disposing of all issues raised in this litigation, counsel for the parties and all other persons
having possession, custody or control of another party’s or third party’s Proprietary Information
shall: (a) destroy all Proprietary Information and any copies thereof, or (b) if requested by the
producing party, return all Proprietary Information and any copies thereof to the producing party.
Notwithstanding paragraph 12(b), a receiving party shall destroy all Proprietary Information of
another party or third party containing or contained in any notes, summaries, digest, synopses or
other documents created by or on behalf of the receiving party. Counsel for each party shall give
a written certification to counsel for all other parties that all of the producing party’s Proprietary
Information has either been destroyed or returned pursuant to this paragraph. If requested,
counsel shall also provide the opposing party with the originals of all Undertaking forms
executed by experts pursuant to paragraph 8.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, outside counsel may retain (a) copies of the
pleadings and other Court filings, (b) copies of the deposition, hearing, and trial transcripts and

any related exhibits, and (c) one file copy of all materials produced in this litigation that are
specifically referred to in an expert report, a motion, pleading or other paper filed with the Court.
In addition, the Government may retain an archival copy of each of (a) the pleadings and
other Court filings, (b) the depositions, hearings, and trial transcripts and any related exhibits,
and (c) all materials produced in this litigation that are specifically referred to in an expert report,
a motion, pleading or other paper filed with the Court.
13.

Contested Designations. The parties shall use reasonable care to avoid

designating as CONFIDENTIAL or ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY any documents or information
that has been published or otherwise entered the public domain. A party shall not be obligated to
challenge the propriety of any other party’s designation of materials or information as
Proprietary Information at the time such designation is made, and failure promptly to challenge
the designation shall not preclude a subsequent challenge thereto. In the event that a party
disagrees at any stage of these proceedings with the designation of any information as
CONFIDENTIAL or ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY, the parties shall try first to resolve such
dispute in good faith on an informal basis. If the dispute cannot be resolved, the objecting party
may seek appropriate relief from this Court. The party asserting that the material is entitled to
CONFIDENTIAL treatment shall have the burden of proof. All Proprietary Information shall
remain under the protection of this Order until otherwise ordered by the Court.
14.

Trial Procedures. A party may request that the Court implement appropriate

procedures to protect Proprietary Information that may be disclosed at the trial or any hearing in
this matter consistent with the spirit and scope of this Order.
15.

Modification. Stipulations may be made between counsel for the respective

parties as to the application of this Order to specific situations provided that such stipulations are
