Civil No. A05-0123 CV (RRB)

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, hereby submits
the following response to defendants’ motion to compel (defendants’ motion):

-2The United States notes at the outset that defendants’ motion does not contain the
certification required under Local Rule 37.1 that defendants “in good faith conferred or
attempted to confer” with the United States “in an effort to secure compliance without court
action.” Notwithstanding defendants’ failure to comply with local rules in this matter,
defendants’ motion fails to set forth any legal or factual grounds to support defendants’ apparent
dissatisfaction with the United States’ responses to defendants’ written discovery requests. As
such, defendants’ motion must be denied.
The United States stands by each and every objection and response to the written
discovery requests of defendants. Each objection and response fairly meets the substance of the
question asked, as best as can be deciphered. For the most part, however, defendants’ written
discovery responses are based on and incorporate defendants’ mistaken beliefs regarding the
Constitution of the United States, the federal government, and the federal tax laws. As such, the
United States is simply at a loss as to how to respond. Nevertheless, the United States’
responses, which were filed by defendants concurrently with defendants’ motion, represent the
best efforts of the United States to provide full and fair responses to each and every request of
defendants.
Because defendants have failed to show any deficiency in the United States’ discovery
responses, the United States respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants’ motion to
