Motion to Compel

Come now, Rita MariNa Hymes and Donald Louis Hymes ("the Hymes") with this
Motion to Compel ("Motion'').

The Hymes served upon the "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" ("USA")
Requests for Admissions, Interrogatories and Discovery under the Federal Civil Rules. for
the First Set of Admissions to the USA, being Attachment 1; and, for the First Set
Interrogatories to the USA, being Attachment 2; and, for the First Request of Discovery
being Attachment 3. The Answers for Admissions, Interrogatories and Discovery by
JENNIFER D. AUCHTERLONIE ("Auchterlonie") are Attachment 4.

1
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document102 ~~ Filed 04/02/2007 Page 2of5

As the Admissions, Interrogatories and request for Discovery are quite straight
forward with no hidden traps or agendas other than the truth, the Hymes will identify the
particular Admissions, Interrogatories and Discovery that Auchterlonie chose not to
answer. The Hymes linked the Admissions, Interrogatories and Discovery by the exact
same means that Auchterlonie did to the Requests to the Hymes.

As a typical example of some of the unintelligible and bad faith responses from

Auchterlonie, who is learned in the law, we find these, to wit:

"The United States further objects to this request on the ground that it is vague,
ambiguous, and utterly unintelligible; thus, it is incapable of being answered"

Or;

"The United States further objects to this request on the ground that it improperly seeks
an opinion, contention, or conclusion of law, and/or asks the United State for an
interpretation of a document that speaks for itself,, Without waiving or in any way
limiting any objection the United States has or might have to this request, the United
States admits that the Treasury Regulation cited herein references the Freedom of
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 0x00A7 552."

Or;

"The United States further objects to this request that it contains argumentative,
scandalous, indecent, and impertinent matter calculated to annoy, embarrass, and
oppress the United States in the eyes of the Court, the ultimate fact finder at the trial of
this matter, the news media, and the public all in violation of the principles expressed in
the Rules of Civil Procedure 7(b)(2), 11, 12(f) and 26. In particular, the request
contains shopworn, tax-protestor rhetoric that has been unequivocally and repeatedly
rejected by the courts. The United States further objects to this request on the ground
that it improperly seeks a conclusion of law, asks the United States for an interpretation
of a document that speaks for itself, and contains an inaccurate statement of the law.
The United States further objects to this request on the ground that it is vague,

The Hymes motions this Court to Compel the USA or evidently Auchterlonie to
answer the Admissions, Interrogatories and provide the Discovery, to wit:

1. Admissions 1- 18; and,
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document102 ~~ Filed 04/02/2007 Page3of5

2. Admission 19-21 is not asking for any conclusion, but if 17 is admitted as true as
written requiring no interpretation, then Admission 19-21 must be admitted or denied;
and,
3. Admission 22-31; and,
4. Admission 32; and,
5. Admission 33; and,
6. Admissions 34-58; and,
7. Admission 59 is only partially answered by Auchterlonie definite admitting to the
Defendants being "domiciled", but the rest of the Admission is not answered; and,
8. Admission 60; and,
9. Admission 61; and,
10. Admission 62; and,
11. Admission 63-67; and,
12. Admission 68; and,
13. Admission 69-72; and,
14. Admission 73-74; and,
15. | Admission 75-78; and,
16. Admission 79; and,
17. Admission 80-98.
Auchterlonie in extreme bad faith repeatedly keeps stating that the Court is the

"ultimate fact" finder, but the Hymes again reinforce a Trial by Jury of their peers that

are not "citizens of the United States."
Case 3:05-cv-00123-RRB Document102 Filed 04/02/2007 Page4of5

Auchterlonie is to allege the facts that are put to the jury of citizens of any of the
several States for Cases in Law and Equity over $20 to which the Hymes have not
waived,

Therefore the Hymes Motion this Court to Compel Auchterlonie or plaintiff the
USA, whoever that may be and as yet to be disclosed, to answer the Admissions.

Auchterlonie did not address even one of the Interrogatories and there is no
perjury statement. The Hymes motion this Court to Compel Auchterlonie or the plaintiff
the USA, whoever that may be and as yet to be disclosed, to answer the Interrogatories.

Auchterlonie has not provided one piece of evidence yet as requested other than
IRS procedural letters that do not rise to evidentiary evidence or to evidence under the
signature of some party or parties. All that Auchterlonie has provided to the Hymes can't
even be admitted into the Trial by Jury as evidence of any Assessment or any alleged
monies owing to a yet to be disclosed Plaintiff.

Therefore, the Hymes Motion the court to order Auchterlonie to answer the
Admissions, the Interrogatories and provide discovery as Requested or dismiss this instant
Case.
