Similarly, Local Rule 7.1 acknowledges the propriety of a motion for an extension of

(1) (J) motion for extensions of time providing the good cause
supporting it is set forth in the motion;
The Plaintiff has conferred with counsel for the Defendants, and the Defendants have
consented to the Plaintiff’s requested for an extension of time for an additional two (2) days until
and including April 27, 2016.
In this case, the Defendants filed a combined motion to dismiss and motion for summary
judgment, including with the Plaintiff's consent to exceed the page limits for a roughly 40-page
combined memorandum of law.
Now with Defendants' expressed consent, the Plaintiff requests a short two-day extension
of time in which to file his oppositions to both the Defendants' motion for summary judgment
and motion to dismiss, including because the Plaintiff is responding to both a motion to dismiss
and a related motion for summary judgment simultaneously allotted response time.
Further, the Plaintiff has been temporarily short-staffed in his legal work and burdened in
his schedule by the recent illness and death of his father.
Wherefore, the Plaintiff hereby respectfully requests that the Court modify the deadline for
his Oppositions to the Defendants’ motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment.
Dated: April 25, 2016
Respectfully submitted,
