MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT
I.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
The Plaintiff hereby respectfully requests that the Court deny Defendants’ Motion for

Summary Judgment because the Defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Defendants have not filed a separate statement of undisputed material facts in support of their
request for summary judgment, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) 56(c),
and thus at the outset the motion is procedurally and substantially defective. Defendants
simultaneously filed both a Motion for Summary Judgment under FRCP Rule 56 and also a
Motion to Dismiss under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(b)(1). Separately, the Plaintiff
responds also to the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.
Here, the Plaintiff responds in opposition to the Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgment. However, because the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss cannot be sustained on the facts
or law, neither can the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment prevail. To avoid
duplication and repetition, the Plaintiff refers to and incorporates by reference as if set forth
herein key sections of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff’s Opposition to
Motion to Dismiss, filed concurrently herewith, as well as Plaintiff’s own Motion for Summary
Judgment, filed on February 3, 2016 [Dkt # 8].
On January 4, 2016, the Executive Office of the President (informally “The White
House”) announced President Obama’s series of unilateral executive orders and actions as an
initiative that Obama titled, “New Executive Actions to Reduce Gun Violence and Make Our
Communities Safer” (hereinafter “new gun control executive orders” or Defendants’
“initiative”). Now, under these executive orders, almost anyone can be a “dealer” – even being
entirely unaware of that status suddenly applying to them.
2

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 7 of 23

The Defendants have rewritten laws concerning the right to buy or sell or be a dealer in
firearms so as to burden and abridge Plaintiff’s fundamental rights under the Second Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution. Under the new gun control executive orders, the Plaintiff could be
designated as a “dealer” and subjected to firearm regulation with criminal penalties. These
actions are unconstitutional, illegal under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551559, and ultra vires. These actions are unconstitutional abuses of the executive branch’s role in
our nation’s constitutional architecture and exceed the powers of the President as set forth in the
U.S. Constitution.
A core dispute is that the Defendants cynically label a fundamental transformation of the
law as merely administrative “guidance” in order to avoid the substantive and procedural
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). Labels that the Defendants use for
public relations and marketing purposes are not controlling or worthy of any consideration.
The Defendants contend in their Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss
and Motion for Summary Judgment, and in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment (“Defendants’ Memorandum”), March 28, 2016, page 1, that: “[r]ather, the Guidance
merely provides the public with a plain English summary of when the relevant statutory scheme
deems an individual to be a firearms “dealer” such that he or she must obtain a Federal Firearms
License.”
However, the definition of “dealer” determines whether a person will either be a criminal
or not a criminal. As discussed below, if one buying or selling a gun for a private collection now
suddenly qualifies as a “dealer” but does not obtain a license, her or she may be indicted, tried,
and ultimately go to prison. If he or she does not conduct background checks with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”), he or she can be prosecuted and convicted as a felon.

3

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 8 of 23

Also, before January 4, 2016, a citizen could only lose his or her Second Amendment
rights upon formal adjudication by a competent court, consistent with due process of mental
incapacity, now the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) will deny
those rights for ill-defined, inaccurate, frivolous, or even retaliatory claims. Any information
about the Plaintiff entered into NICS without any due process can now deprive him of his
constitutional rights.
II.

GOVERNING STANDARD OF LAW
The court, in reviewing a motion for summary judgment, is guided by the standard set

forth in FRCP Rule 56(a), which states, in relevant part: “The court shall grant summary
judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”
FRCP Rule 56 states, in relevant part, that “[a] party may move for summary judgment,
identifying each claim or defense — or the part of each claim or defense — on which summary
judgment is sought.” Id. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates
it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.; Diamond v. Atwood, 43 F.3d 1538, 1540 (D.C.
Cir. 1995).
A summary judgment motion will be denied if a dispute about a “material” fact is
“genuine.” The Court must decide if the assertion that a factual dispute exists is genuine or a
dispute that is not significant to the result. A case must proceed to trial “if the evidence is such
that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 242 (1986).
Generally, “the inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to
require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter

4

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 9 of 23

of law.” Id. at 243. Evidence may be presented in the form of pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits. Id. at 247.
The moving party bears the heavy burden of meeting these standards. Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986). “The moving party may discharge this ‘initial
responsibility’ by showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's
case or by showing that the nonmoving party will be unable to prove its case at trial.” Hickson
Corp., v. Northern Crossarm Co., Inc., 357 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir. 2004).
Furthermore, FRCP Rule 56(d) also states:
(d) When Facts Are Unavailable to the Nonmovant. If a nonmovant shows by
affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts
essential to justify its opposition, the court may:
(1) defer considering the motion or deny it;
(2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or
(3) issue any other appropriate order.
Strang v. U.S. Arms Control & Disarmament Agency, 864 F.2d 859, 861, 275 U.S. App. D.C. 37
(D.C. Cir. 1989); Londrigan v. FBI, 670 F.2d 1164, 1174, 216 U.S. App. D.C. 345 (D.C. Cir.
1981). "Summary judgment is proper only "after adequate time for discovery . . . ." Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). “[T]he purpose
of Rule 56(d) is to prevent railroading the non-moving party through a premature motion for
summary judgment before the non-moving party has had the opportunity to make full
discovery.” Dickens v. Whole Foods Market Group, Inc., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11791, 2003
WL 21486821, at *2 n.5 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2003) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, at 317).
III.

ARGUMENT
A. Plaintiff has Standing to Bring this Challenge
A plaintiff has standing if (1) he has suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury in fact is

caused by action of Defendant, and (3) the injury is redressable. See Lujan v. Defs. Of Wildlife,
5

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 10 of 23

504 U.S. 555 (1992). Plaintiff has clearly met this threshold requirement as a owner of “two 9
millimeter handguns and one .45 caliber” who is subject to Defendants’ new regulations. (SUMF
¶ 20). Crucially, Defendants’ new gun control executive orders transform the definition of who
qualifies as a “dealer” to the extent that Plaintiff’s status may shift from being a “non-dealer” to
a “dealer”. As a non-dealer, Plaintiff was previously able to sell and transport his firearms
without having to conduct a background check and refuse to sell to individuals who did not pass
the background check. However, should Plaintiff’s status shift to that of a “dealer” he suddenly
must obtain a dealer license, conduct background checks, and refuse to sell to individuals who do
not pass a background check, or risk committing a felony punishable by up to five years’
imprisonment and fines up to $250,000. Moreover, Plaintiff has met the prudential standing
requirements for claims under the APA because “the interest sought to be protected by the
complainant [is] arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute
... in question." Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 615 (S.D. Tex. 2015). There is a
strong favorable presumption in favor of the Plaintiff. Id. Not only have Defendants not
proffered any facts to rebut Plaintiff’s standing, Plaintiff’s interest is clearly within the zone of
interests to be regulated, as an individual whose status as a “non-dealer” has been called into
doubt.
1. Plaintiff Has Suffered a Cognizable Injury in Fact
As described in the foregoing paragraph1, Plaintiff has suffered a cognizable injury in fact
because a shift from non-dealer to dealer status would severely restrict Plaintiff’s ability to buy,
sell and transport his firearms and subject Plaintiff to criminal liability for actions that were
previously legal. Being subject to criminal prosecution and imprisonment is clearly a cognizable

1

supra section III(A)
6

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 11 of 23

injury in fact. Moreover, Plaintiff’s injury is immediate, by Defendants’ own admission.
Defendants admit that their new gun control executive orders took effect “immediately” on
January 4 or 5, 2016.2
2. Plaintiff Alleged that the Injury was Directly and Proximately Caused by
Defendants
Plaintiff’s cognizable injury in fact is directly caused by Defendants’ new executive
orders. Without such executive orders, Plaintiff would certainly remain a “non-dealer” who is
free to buy, sell and transport his firearms without the looming threat of criminal prosecution.
3. Plaintiff’s Injury is Redressable
Striking or ruling invalid the Defendants’ new gun control executive orders would restore
the status quo ante and relieve the Plaintiff of the legal jeopardy they created and the
infringement of his fundamental constitutional rights.
B. Defendants Change the Law by Changing Definition of “Dealer” in Violation of
Procedural Requirements of the APA
The Defendant’s Memorandum, Section II(B), Page 2 also argues that summary judgment should
be granted because the Plaintiff cannot establish that their new gun control executive orders are
regulatory changes subject to the APA rather than merely being administrative “guidance.”
However, merely disingenuously labeling a regulation as a “guidance” does not confer
Defendants the right to ignore the formal rule making process. “…[T]wo criteria to distinguish
policy statements from substantive rules: whether the rule (1) "impose[s] any rights and
obligations" and (2) "genuinely leaves the agency and its decisionmakers free to exercise
discretion." Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 171 (5th Cir. Tex. 2015) “There is some

7

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 12 of 23

overlap in the analysis of those prongs "because '[i]f a statement denies the decisionmaker
discretion in the area of its coverage . . . then the statement is binding, and creates rights or
obligations.'" Id. "While mindful but suspicious of the agency's own characterization, we . . .
focus[] primarily on whether the rule has binding effect on agency discretion or severely restricts
it." Id. "[A]n agency pronouncement will be considered binding as a practical matter if it either
appears on its face to be binding, or is applied by the agency in a way that indicates it is
binding.” “A binding rule is not required to undergo notice and comment if it is one ‘of agency
organization, procedure, or practice.’….’[T]he substantial impact test is the primary means by
which [we] look beyond the label 'procedural' to determine whether a rule is of the type Congress
thought appropriate for public participation…. An agency rule that modifies substantive rights
and interests can only be nominally procedural, and the exemption for such rules of agency
procedure cannot apply.” Id. at 176.Thus, the inquiry must be made into the substance of the
regulation, not the mere label that is is given.3 Moreover, the issuance of a guideline or guidance
may constitute final agency. Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C.
Cir. 2000). “Guidance” document constitutes final agency action reviewable under Section 704
insofar as it restrains administrative staff ’s discretion. Nat’l Pork Producers Council v. EPA,
635 F.3d 738, 755-56 (5th Cir. 2011) ; NRDC v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311, 319-20 (D.C. Cir. 2011).
1. Defendants have substantively changed the rights of Plaintiff, and
numerous others, by changing the definition of the term “dealer”
Here, Defendants have substantively changed the rights of Plaintiff, and numerous other
3

Courts reject the proposition that an agency can escape judicial review under the APA, 5 U.S.C.
§ 704, by merely labeling its rule an “informal” guidance document. See Better Gov’t Ass’n v.
Dep’t of State, 780 F.2d 86, 93 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). The primary distinction between a substantive
rule and a general statement of policy . . . turns on whether an agency intends to bind itself to a
particular legal position. Syncor Int’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1997);
American Bus Ass’n v. United States, 627 F.2d 525, 532 (D.C. Cir. 1980).
8

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 13 of 23

Americans, by illegally changing the definition of what constitutes a “dealer”. As described
above, “dealers” are subject to much stricter requirements when buying, selling, or transporting
firearms and face criminal prosecution for failing to meet those requirements. As such,
Defendants’ new gun control executive orders “affect individual rights and obligations.”
Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 301-03 (1979). The changing definition of who is a
“dealer” causes some people who were acting lawfully before the change to be guilty of criminal
felonies after the change. Because the Defendants’ changes burden U.S. citizens with possible
criminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment who were not previously breaking any law,
the changes are regulatory changes that must comply with both the procedural requirements of
the APA and the substantive requirements of the APA (must be authorized under the underlying
legislation and sustainable under the constitution).
Secondly, the Defendants’ new gun control executive orders are ultra vires and illegal
legislative rules which require compliance with the APA because they are binding on ATF
officials. A rule is substantive (and hence must comply with the APA) “if it either appears on its
face to be binding, or is applied by the agency in a way that indicates it is binding.” General
Elec. Co. v. EPA, 290 F.3d 377, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). An agency directive
must comply with the APA, when, for example, “[F]rom beginning to end [it] reads like a ukase
[i.e., edict in Russian]. It commands, it requires, it orders, it dictates.” Appalachian Power Co. v.
EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The Defendants’ new executive orders are
subjected to judicial review because it used “mandatory words like ‘will’ instead of permissive
words like ‘may’. See Cohen v. United States, 578 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Defendants here
have ordered ATF personnel to apply a new and different interpretation of who is a “dealer.”
The Defendants ordered the ATF in its enforcement of the laws entrusted to that agency for

9

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 14 of 23

enforcement to treat almost anyone as a dealer, regardless of whether or not the person is in the
business of trading in firearms or earning a livelihood (or seeking to) by trading in firearms.
Third, the new gun control executive orders are legislative rules because each order “puts
a stamp of agency approval or disapproval on a given type of behavior,” as analyzed by
Chamber of Commerce v. DOL, 174 F.3d 206, 212 (D.C. Cir. 1999).
2. Defendants’ own statements indicate that they intended to, and have
changed the law
The Press Secretary of the Executive Office of the President, Josh Earnest, authorized to
speak publicly on behalf of the Defendants as their agent, admitted on January 5, 2016, that the
orders effecting and implementing the change in the law has not yet been publicly released:
MR. EARNEST: “I’m not sure what sort of administrative paperwork is required
to implement the policy that the President discussed today, but we can certainly
consult with Counsel’s Office here and get back to you with an answer on that.”4
Mr. Earnest clearly indicates that Defendants plan to “implement the policy that the
President discussed today”. If, in actuality, as Defendants argue, the ATF Guidance and the
White House Fact Sheet merely serve as guidance, and not legislation, there would be nothing to
implement. Additionally, in the Defendants’ Memorandum, the Defendants effectively admit that
the Plaintiff’s Complaint is accurate and correct, in that the Defendants have substantively
changed the laws enacted by Congress. Page 3 of Defendants’ Memorandum states:
Recognizing that “[g]un violence has taken a heartbreaking toll on too many
communities across the country,” President Obama in early January 2016
announced a series of initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. See Fact Sheet at
2, ECF No. 8-3.
That is, the challenged programs are intended to produce a change in society which can
only be a legislative act, specifically “reducing gun violence” “across the country.” Further:

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 15 of 23

The policies announced by the President, and crafted in consultation with the
Attorney General, FBI Director, and Head of the Bureau of ATF were designed
“to strengthen our enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong
hands to make sure that criminals, people who are mentally unstable, those who
could pose a danger to themselves or others are less likely to get them.” THE
WHITE HOUSE, Remarks by the President on Recommendations on Gun Safety,
https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/05/remarks-presidentrecommendations-gun-safety (Jan. 4, 2016).
Id. at page 3-4.
The Defendants’ new executive orders will cause U.S. citizens to be prosecuted
(“enforcement”) who would not previously be prosecuted. The programs are intended to
“prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands” so as to legislatively change the behavior of
U.S. citizens.
First, Plaintiff challenges guidance issued by ATF to help those intending to buy
or sell firearms to understand when federal law requires a license. See ECF No. 85, U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives, Do I need a License to Buy and Sell Firearms, ATF Publication
5310.2, https://www.atf.gov/file/100871/download (Jan. 2016) (“ATF
Guidance”).
Id. at pages 3-4.
The Gun Control Act, as amended, prohibits “engag[ing] in the business of
importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms” unless one is “a licensed
importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer.” 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1)(A). A
violation of this provision is punishable by up to five years in prison. Id. §
924(a)(1)(C). The statutory scheme also imposes on FFLs certain duties. Licensed
dealers must “verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential buyer may lawfully
own a gun,” Abramski v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 2259, 2263 (2014), by, among
other things, contacting NICS to determine whether the purchaser is qualified to
own the firearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(t)(1)(A)–(B). Dealers must also “maintain such
records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of
firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney
General may by regulations prescribe.” Id. § 923(g)(1)(A).
Id. at page 5.
3. Because Defendants changed the substantive rights of Plaintiff and
numerous other, by way of regulation, without abiding by the proper
rule-making procedure, Defendants’ action is unlawful.
11

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 16 of 23

As a result, the Defendants must comply with the rule-making procedures imposed by the
APA, including posting a precise Notice of Proposed Rule-Making in the Federal Register and
receiving, reviewing, and analyzing public comments before finalizing any regulation. The APA
requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action taken “without observance
of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). Procedurally, a Department or other
agency cannot promulgate a rule without notice-and-comment rulemaking. Although referred to
as ‘informal’ rule-making, this elaborate procedure requires the agency to publish a notice of
proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and to accept and consider public comments on its
proposal. See 5 U.S.C. § 553.
The agency must publish “proposed rule making” and invite public comment, then draft a
final version of the regulation after considering and analyzing the public comments. A failure to
genuinely and truly analyze, consider, and evaluate the public comments before drafting the final
version of the regulation may violate the APA.
C. Defendants’ New Gun Control Executive Orders Violate Substantive APA
Requirements
On Defendants’ Memorandum Page 27, the Defendants claim that they are entitled to
summary judgment because the Defendants’ new gun control executive orders do not constitute a
change to the law in conflict with the laws passed by Congress nor are they arbitrary or
capricious. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), the APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set
aside any agency action that is
“(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance
with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; [or]
(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of
statutory right.”
The APA prohibits the agency from authorizing what Congress has prohibited or vice
12

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 17 of 23

versa. See, e.g., Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (“If the intent of
Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give
effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”). The policies previous Congresses
embraced in the past foreclose the agency from adopting a policy Congress rejected. See, e.g.,
Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Ass’n v. U.S. Dept. of Energy, 706 F.3d 499, 504-07 (D.C. Cir. 2013).
As described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendants’ actions have constituted a change
in the application of the law. By changing the definition of what constitutes a “dealer”,
Defendant’s new executive orders are not “in accordance with” the laws enacted by Congress. 5
U.S.C. § 706(2)(a). Furthermore, a regulation that burdens a fundamental right must satisfy
“strict scrutiny” and be narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, as discussed
above. Defendants’ orders take away legal rights for millions of would-be gun owners.
D. Defendants’ New Gun Control Executive Orders Exceed the Scope of Executive
Authority
In Defendants’ Memorandum beginning on Page 28, Defendants contend that none of the
initiatives challenged here exceeds the Executive’s Authority. The crux of Defendants’ argument
here appears to be that the ATF did not serve as “legislation”, but instead was just a “guidance”.
As described in the previous paragraphs of this opposition, this contention has no merit.
Defendants have indeed altered the substantive rights of Plaintiff and numerous other individuals
by shifting the definition of “dealer” so as to impose restrictions on the purchase, sale, and
transport of firearms on those previously not subject to regulation. This is clearly rule-making
and not merely “guidance”.
Moreover, Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant’s overstepped the
bounds of Executive Authority with the SSA rule is without merit because no rule has yet been
promulgated. While it is true that the SSA rule has not been promulgated as of yet, the substance
13

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 18 of 23

of the announcement indicated that “[t]he Social Security Administration will begin the
rulemaking process to include information in the background check system about beneficiaries
who are prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons.”5 As such, the clear
result of such rule would be to preclude a whole new subset of individuals from purchasing
firearms legally.
Under 27 C.F.R. 478.32, implementing Title I, State Firearms Control Assistance (18
U.S.C. Chapter 44), of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (82 Stat. 1213), as amended, a person is
denied the right to buy a firearm (a dealer may not sell to them) who has been formally
adjudicated by a competent court to be….“a mental defective or has been committed to a mental
institution.” Reports from the judicial branch as to who has been convicted of a felony or
adjudicated mentally incompetent, etc., are entered into NICS, which is managed by the Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI). 28 C.F.R. 25. Now, the Executive has effectively mandated that
the SSA’s determination of “mental health reasons” be implemented in the determination of who
qualifies to legally purchase a firearm. This invariably takes the determination out of the hands
of the courts, which implicates individuals’ due process rights as well various other
constitutional concerns, such as privacy.
E. New Gun Control Executive Orders Are Subjective and Void for Vagueness
The Defendants also ask for summary judgment on the grounds that the Plaintiff cannot
prove a claim that their changes of the law are void for vagueness. Defendants’ Memorandum
page 30. However, the Defendants have already admitted that their new gun control executive
orders are vague, subjective, and ill-defined in a way that qualifies as impermissibly vague.

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 19 of 23

These are admissions by a party opponent.6
It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its
prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values.
First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful
conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable
opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague
laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, ... vague law
impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for
resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of
arbitrary and discriminatory application.
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 109 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).
As the Defendants admit, their new executive orders are subjective. They expose the
Plaintiff to potential criminal prosecution upon unfettered discretion for acts that a reasonable
person may not understand to be forbidden. The Defendants concede in Defendants
Memorandum, page 7:
The Guidance explains that place of business is not dispositive in determining
who is a dealer. ATF Guidance 3. In fact, the Guidance notes, under extant federal
law, there is no “bright-line rule for when a federal firearms license is required.”
Id. At 4. Consequently, just as place of business cannot be the end of the inquiry,
“there is no specific threshold number or frequency of sales, quantity of firearms,
or amount of profit or time invested that triggers the licensure requirement.” Id.
The Guidance stresses instead that the analysis is more fact bound, adding: “As a
general rule, you will need a license if you repetitively buy and sell firearms with
the principal motive of making a profit. In contrast, if you only make occasional
sales of firearms from your personal collection, you do not need to be licensed.”
Id. (emphasis omitted).
As the Defendants also admit in their new regulatory orders:
What activities require a dealer’s license?
Federal law does not establish a “bright-line” rule for when a federal firearms
license is required. As a result, there is no specific threshold number or frequency
of sales, quantity of firearms, or amount of profit or time invested that triggers the
licensure requirement. Instead, determining whether you are “engaged in the
business” of dealing in firearms requires looking at the specific facts and

15

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 24 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 20 of 23

circumstances of your activities.7
And:
It is important to note that no single factor is determinative, and that the relative
importance of any of the factors will vary depending on the facts and
circumstances applicable to the individual seller.8
The Supreme Court makes clear that the Defendants new executive orders are void:
[O]ur holdings squarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is
constitutional merely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the
provision's grasp. For instance, we have deemed a law prohibiting grocers from
charging an “unjust or unreasonable rate” void for vagueness—even though
charging someone a thousand dollars for a pound of sugar would surely be unjust
and unreasonable. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.S., at 89, 41 S.Ct. 298. We have
similarly deemed void for vagueness a law prohibiting people on sidewalks from
“conduct[ing] themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by”—even
though spitting in someone's face would surely be annoying. Coates v. Cincinnati,
402 U.S. 611, 91 S.Ct. 1686 (1971).
Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 2561, 192 L. Ed. 2d 569 (June 26, 2015).
The same case also rejected the view that prior court precedents are sufficient:
This Court has acknowledged that the failure of “persistent efforts ... to establish a
standard” can provide evidence of vagueness. United States v. L. Cohen Grocery
Co., 255 U.S. 81, 91 (1921). Here, this Court’s repeated attempts and repeated
failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause
confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.
F. Declaratory Judgment: Violation of Non-Delegation Doctrine
The Defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law under the Take Care
Clause, Defendants’ Memorandum, page 31, which is judicially enforceable against presidential
invocations of the dispensing power. See, e.g., Angelus Milling Co. v. Comm’r of Internal
Revenue, 325 U.S. 293, 296 (1945). In Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524 (1838),

the Court affirmed mandamus to a cabinet official ordering him to settle claims with mail
contractors as required by an act of Congress. The cabinet official argued that he could ignore
the act because the President had an exclusive duty to execute the laws, id. at 545-47, 612. The
Court disagreed. Id. at 613; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952)
(Jackson, J., concurring) (“When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed
or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own
constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.”).
G. Violation of President’s Duty to Take Care that Laws Are Executed
The Take Care Clause is judicially enforceable against presidential invocations of the
dispensing power. See, e.g., Angelus Milling Co. v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, 325 U.S. 293,
296 (1945). For example, in Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524 (1838), the Court
affirmed mandamus to a cabinet official ordering him to settle claims with mail contractors as
required by an act of Congress. The cabinet official argued that he could ignore the act because
the President had an exclusive duty to execute the laws, id. at 545-47, 612. The Court disagreed:
“To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed,
implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the [C]onstitution and
entirely inadmissible.” Id. at 613; see also Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 525 (2008)
(President has “an array” of discretionary obligations to enforce international law, “but
unilaterally converting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is not among them”);
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)
(“When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional
powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.”); Angelus Milling Co. v.
