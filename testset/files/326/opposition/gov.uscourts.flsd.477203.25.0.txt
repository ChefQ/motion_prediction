PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS AND
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT THEREOF
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for
the reasons set forth in his incorporated Memorandum of Law below.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS
I.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
The Plaintiff, like other U.S. citizens, never imagined himself to be a firearms dealer, but

now suddenly he has been designated as a dealer by sweeping, overbroad and arbitrary executive
orders. On January 4, 2016, the White House announced President Obama’s series of orders and
actions as an initiative, which Obama titled “New Executive Actions to Reduce Gun Violence and
Make Our Communities Safer”.2 (the “Executive Orders”). Now, under these Executive Orders,
which Defendants clearly intended to operate as rules and regulations, almost anyone can be a
dealer – even being entirely unaware of that status suddenly applying to them.
Defendants challenge Plaintiff’s complaint under the contention that Plaintiff lacks
standing to assert Plaintiffs’ claims. However, Defendants’ fundamental error is that Defendants
fail to take Plaintiffs’ well pleaded facts as true, pursuant to Fed R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6). Taken as
true, Plaintiffs’ complaint clearly pleads how Defendants’ Executive Orders have caused
Plaintiff concrete injury in fact sufficient to confer standing.
The Defendants have rewritten laws concerning the right to buy or sell or be a dealer in
firearms so as to burden and abridge Plaintiff’s fundamental rights under the Second Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution. Under the new gun control executive orders, the Plaintiff could be
designated as a “dealer” and subjected to firearm regulation with criminal penalties. These
actions are unconstitutional, illegal under the Administrative Procedures Act, and ultra vires. In
2

Docket No. 8-3
1

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 5 of 18

sum, these actions are unconstitutional abuses of the executive branch’s role in our nation’s
constitutional architecture and exceed the powers of the President as set forth in the U.S.
Constitution.
Defendants cynically label a fundamental transformation of the law as merely
administrative “guidance” in order to avoid the substantive and procedural requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). Defendants claim, “…the Guidance merely provides the
public with a plain English summary of when the relevant statutory scheme deems an individual
to be a firearms “dealer” such that he or she must obtain a Federal Firearms License.”3 The
definition of “dealer” is crucial insofar as it wholly determines whether a person will either be a
subject to criminal liability for buying, selling, or transporting a gun without fulfilling certain
prerequisite steps. Defendants’ new executive order has rendered the term “dealer” entirely
vague and therefore subjected Plaintiff, and numerous others, to potential criminal prosecution.
Moreover, the inclusion of poorly defined red flags as to mental health in the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System (“NICS”) is a radical change from current law.
Pursuant to the Executive Orders, the Social Security Administration (“SSA”) will commence
rule-making procedures to “ensure that appropriate information is reported to NICS.”4 Not only
is such reporting a clear and blatant invasion of medical records privacy rights that each and
every American enjoys, now persons can be deprived of their Second Amendment rights and
constitutional rights to privacy based solely on reported information, whether accurate or not.
II.

GOVERNING STANDARD OF LAW
FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) governs a motion for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can

be granted.” In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must take all well
pleaded facts in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. See
Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421(1969). On a motion to dismiss under FRCP Rule
12(b)(6), “We are required to accept the facts as set forth in the plaintiff's complaint as true, and
our consideration is limited to those facts contained in the pleadings and attached exhibits.”
Thaeter v. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, 449 F.3d 1342, 1352 (11th Cir. 2006)) (quoting
Griffin Industries, Inc. v. Irvin, 496 F.3d 1189, 1199 (11th Cir. 2007)). A federal court must
also “‘construe the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be
derived from the acts alleged’ and upon such facts determine jurisdictional questions.” Am. Nat’l
Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Thomas v. Principi, 394 F.3d
970, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Barr v. Clinton, 370 F.3d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 2004)));
Reynolds v. Army & Air Force Exch. Serv., 846 F.2d 746, 747 (Fed. Cir. 1988). A complaint
should only be dismissed if “it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that
could be proved consistent with the allegations.” Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73,
104 S. Ct. 2229, 2232, 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984).
III.

STATEMENT OF FACTS MATERIAL TO THE MOTION
A. Plaintiff’s Complaint Alleges Grounds for Standing
The Defendants’ Memorandum largely and effectively admits the Plaintiff’s factual

allegations, while trying to spin those facts. The Complaint alleged facts sufficient to establish
standing:5
8. Plaintiff Klayman is the owner of guns for his protection, include two 9
millimeter handguns and one .45 caliber in part as a prized collector’s item as
well as in self defense, all properly licensed and permitted. He also holds a
Florida concealed weapons permit. As a lawyer, Klayman has sued terrorist
5

Docket No. 1 ¶¶8-11
3

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 7 of 18

organizations and countries for supporting terrorism. Especially while litigating
against the Clintons, he has been actually threatened with death threats, even
having a man appear suddenly inside his house. He therefore needs the
protections of the Second Amendment.
9. The Plaintiff Klayman intends to exercise his Second Amendment rights
including the right to keep and bear arms, own, and carry firearms, and buy and
sell guns as permitted by current law. He intends to do what is lawful under
current law to lawfully buy, sell, trade, or gift these guns or additional guns like
any other American considered about safety. However, these new rules will most
definitely “infringe” upon the right to keep and bear arms that the Second
Amendment says cannot be infringed.
10. Now, the Plaintiff is at legal risk because his intended conduct is legal under
current law but would become prohibited under the Defendants’ re-interpretation
of the law, subjecting the Plaintiff to legal action by the Defendants. Given the
prominence of the Plaintiff in challenging the status quo in government and in
particular the Obama administration, such legal action is likely by these
Defendants.
11. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to sue for declaratory judgment to avoid
legal jeopardy from undertaking actions that are legally permitted if the
Defendants’ new gun control rules are invalid but which might well subject him
to legal jeopardy if those rules are legally valid. Under well-settled law, one does
not need to commit acts incurring legal jeopardy before testing the validity of
those legal rules.
B. Defendants’ Executive Order Has Effectively Changed the Law by Altering
Plaintiff’s and Numerous Others’ Substantial Rights
In the Defendants’ Memorandum, the Defendants largely and effectively admit that the
Plaintiff’s Complaint is accurate and correct, specifically in that the Defendants have
substantively changed the laws enacted by Congress, all while claiming that they have issued
only “guidance” that does not require compliance with the APA. The Defendants concede:
“[g]un violence has taken a heartbreaking toll on too many communities across the country,”
President Obama in early January 2016 announced a series of initiatives aimed at reducing gun
violence.6

6

Docket No. 18-1 at 3
4

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 8 of 18

That is, the challenged programs are intended to produce a change in society which can
only be a legislative act, specifically “reducing gun violence” “across the country.” Furthermore,
the Defendants concede:
The policies announced by the President, and crafted in consultation with the
Attorney General, FBI Director, and Head of the Bureau of ATF were designed
“to strengthen our enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong
hands to make sure that criminals, people who are mentally unstable, those who
could pose a danger to themselves or others are less likely to get them.”7
The challenged programs are “to strengthen our enforcement.” As such, Defendants’
programs cause U.S. citizens to be prosecuted who would not otherwise be prosecuted. The
programs are intended to “prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands” so as to legislatively
change the behavior of U.S. citizens with regard to fundamental rights.
Lastly, the Press Secretary of the Executive Office of the President, Josh Earnest,
authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the Defendants as their agent, admitted on January 5,
2016, that the orders effecting and implementing the change in the law has not yet been publicly
released:
MR. EARNEST: “I’m not sure what sort of administrative paperwork is required
to implement the policy that the President discussed today, but we can certainly
consult with Counsel’s Office here and get back to you with an answer on that.”8
Mr. Earnest clearly indicates that Defendants plan to “implement the policy that the
President discussed today”. If, in actuality, as Defendants argue, the ATF Guidance and the
White House Fact Sheet merely serve as guidance, and not legislation, there would be nothing to
implement.

IV.

ARGUMENT
A. Defendants Fail to Take Allegations of the Complaint as True
Much of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is grounded on Defendants’ failure to take

Plaintiff’s well-pleaded facts as true. For instance, Defendants argue that the Court “lacks subject
matter jurisdiction to consider Plaintiff’s APA challenges to the ATF Guidance…for the
additional reason that the ATF Guidance is not final agency action.”9 However, Plaintiff’s
complaint clearly pleads that Defendants’ Executive Order “affect individual rights and
obligations” and “puts a stamp of agency approval or disapproval on a given type of
behavior.”10 Additionally, Plaintiff pled, “…these new rules will have the force of law, even to
the point of criminal prosecution…. [t]therefore, the new rules are in fact regulations and not
guidance. The federal courts have rejected the idea that an agency can escape judicial review
under Section 704 of the APA by labeling a rule as a ‘guidance.’”11
Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), the
allegations of the Complaint must be taken as true, along with all reasonable inference drawn
therefrom, for purposes of a motion to dismiss. Thus, Defendants err in seeking to contradict the
allegations of the Complaint and seek to have the Complaint dismissed merely because the
Defendants disagree with the allegations contained therein. Moreover, even without the benefit
of the presumption that Plaintiff’s allegations are well-pled, Plaintiff’s complaint still describes
in detail how Defendants’ Executive Orders are effectively final agency regulations—
specifically that they change the substantial rights of Plaintiffs and numerous others by changing
the definition of “dealer” for the purposes of enforcing gun-control laws.

1. Plaintiff Has Properly Alleged that Defendants’ Executive Orders
Constitute Final Agency Action
As described above, supra section IV(A), Plaintiff has pled that Defendants’ Executive
Orders do, in fact, constitute final agency action as regulations. Therefore, Defendants’ primary
argument that “[a]bsent final agency action, Plaintiff’s APA claims must be dismissed for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction”12 is improperly brought and cannot be sustained. Defendants’
arguments to the contrary are improperly brought in this context and must be ignored.
Even more, the issuance of a guideline or guidance may constitute final agency action
under existing case law. Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir.
2000). “Guidance” document constitutes final agency action reviewable under Section 704
insofar as it restrains administrative staff ’s discretion. Nat’l Pork Producers Council v. EPA,
635 F.3d 738, 755-56 (5th Cir. 2011) ; NRDC v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311, 319-20 (D.C. Cir. 2011).
The ATF is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). Now, the ATF has been mandated
by Defendants to apply the new definition of “dealer” in the exercise of its functions, thus
restraining its discretion. Defendants’ assertion that the “guidance” is not legislation and only an
accumulation of case law is contravened by their own admissions.
B. Plaintiff Has Alleged Facts Establishing Standing
Plaintiffs pleads in his complaint that he “is the owner of guns for his protection,
include[ing] two 9 millimeter handguns and one .45 caliber in part as a prized collector’s item as
well as in self defense, all properly licensed and permitted. He also holds a Florida concealed
weapons permit.”13 As a licensed gun owner and collector, Plaintiff can purchase and sell
firearms, and can continue to do so in the future. Crucially, Plaintiff has the current right to sell

12
13

Docket No. 18-1 at 13.
Docket No. 1 ¶8.
7

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 11 of 18

his firearms in the future, especially given the fact that he own collectors’ pieces.14 Prior to
Defendants’ Executive Orders, Plaintiff would have been free to sell or transport any of his
firearms without fear of criminal repercussions. Now, however, given the vague new definition
of a “dealer” set forth by Defendants’ Executive Orders, Plaintiff may be categorized as a
“dealer” who’s ability to freely sell and transport firearms has been stripped away. This clear
injury to Plaintiff’s Second Amendment rights confers to Plaintiff standing, in that it is caused
directly by Defendants’ Executive Orders and can be redressed only with a declaration and ruling
from this Court that Defendant’s actions are illegal and invalid.
As standing is a “threshold question in every federal case,” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.
490, 498 (1975). In order to have standing, a Plaintiff must “show an injury that is ‘concrete,
particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable
by a favorable ruling.’ Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 150-151 (5th Cir. Tex. 2015).
"When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some
possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the
decision that allegedly harmed the litigant." Id. In Texas v. United States, the Fifth Circuit—
which once was part of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit—decided a case
which was markedly similar to the facts at hand. Id. The Fifth Circuit in Texas held that
Defendant Barack Obama violated both the procedural and substantive aspects of the APA when
he, by executive order without undergoing the formal rule-making process, changed the law to
effectively grant amnesty or “safe-harbor” and various regulatory benefits to illegal aliens. Id.
Here, Defendants—including President Barack Obama again—have attempted again to forego

14

Docket No. 1 ¶8-9.
8

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 12 of 18

the formal rule-making process and create new law through their Executive Orders, despite the
Fifth Circuit’s ruling.
In Texas, the Fifth Circuit upheld the lower court’s determination that Plaintiff Texas had
standing to challenge Defendant Barack Obama’s unconstitutional executive orders because
those executive orders caused a specified harm on Texas—namely that Texas would have to
incur additional costs providing driver’s licenses for those granted “safe-harbor” under
Defendant Barack Obama’s executive order. Similarly, Plaintiff here has suffered cognizable,
concrete injuries caused directly by Defendants’ executive orders, as described herein, as he risks
criminal prosecution if he violates Defendants’ executive orders.
Here, Plaintiff will be subject to criminal prosecution if he violates the executive orders.
1. Plaintiff Has Satisfied Prudential Standing for Actions Arising out of the
APA
Plaintiff has met the prudential standing requirements for claims under the APA because
Plaintiff’s asserted injury is “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by
the statute” Id. at 162. There is a favorable presumption in favor of the Plaintiff, yet Defendants
have failed to offer any facts to rebut this presumption. Nonetheless, Plaintiff satisfies this
requirement—Defendants’ regulation seeks to restrict the purchase, sale, and transport of
firearms, which clearly encompasses Plaintiff’s interest in protecting his right to purchase, sell,
and transport his firearms as Plaintiff alleged in his Complaint: “[Plaintiff] intends to do what is
lawful under current law to lawfully buy, sell, trade, or gift these guns or additional guns like any
other American considered about safety.” 15
2. Plaintiff Has Alleged a Cognizable Injury in Fact
a. Substantive APA Claims
15

Docket No. 1 ¶9.
9

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 13 of 18

Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to allege that “he is current or is in the future
will be ‘engage[ed] in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing firearms’”16—
essentially arguing that Plaintiff failed to allege that he will be a “dealer” of firearms. Plaintiff’s
entire argument on this issue is that “the Defendants ordered the ATF to apply a new and
different interpretation of who is a ‘dealer’ for the purposes of these statutes”17 and that now, due
to Defendants’ Executive Orders, Plaintiff may be considered a “dealer”. Defendants’ Executive
Orders expressly state that a person can be found to be a dealer when “only one or two
transactions took place”.18 Defendants concede that “Plaintiff has alleged that he intends to ‘buy,
sell, trade, or gift these guns or additional guns….” By applying the definition of “dealer” set
forth in Defendants’ Executive Orders, Plaintiff absolutely could be categorized as such, and as a
result, be subject to imprisonment and fines for the exact conduct that would have been deemed
legal prior to Defendants’ Executive Orders.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is threatened with the threat of concrete and particularized harm—
imprisonment and/or fines—that is actual or imminent, since Defendants’ Executive Orders went
into effect on January 5, 2016.19 Plaintiff’s injury is directly traceable to Defendants’ Executive
Orders insomuch as Defendants’ Executive Orders rendered Plaintiff’s once clearly lawful
conduct now subject to a new, vague, interpretation of the term “dealer” from which criminal
liability can be imposed. Lastly, Plaintiff’s injury is redressable upon a legal finding and
declaration that Defendants’ Executive Orders are unlawful because such a declaration would
restore the status quo and allow Plaintiff to continue to freely exercise his Second Amendment

rights. Thus, Plaintiff has properly pled standing for his substantive APA claims.
b. Procedural APA Claims
Next, Defendants claim that Plaintiff has not plead injury in fact related to Defendants’
failure to use notice-and comment rulemaking when promulgating their new gun control
regulations. In this context, “a plaintiff has established procedural injury standing if he has
established that the claimed violation of the procedural right caused a concrete injury in fact to
an interest of the plaintiff that the statute was designed to protect.” Sierra Club v. Johnson, 436
F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006). Courts relax the imminence and redressibility requirements for
procedural Plaintiffs. Ctr. for Law & Educ. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1159 (D.C. Cir.
2005). “Plaintiffs asserting a procedural rights challenge need not show the agency action would
have been different had it been consummated in a procedurally valid manner—the courts will
assume this portion of the causal link. Rather, plaintiffs simply need to show the agency action
affects their concrete interests in a personal way.” Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1012-1013
(D.C. Cir. 2014) (internal citations omitted)
Here, clearly Plaintiff’s—and numerous others’—procedural rights have been violated.
As alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint, “Defendants announced new gun control rules without
authority and without notice-and-comment rulemaking.”20 In order to have standing to challenge
Defendants’ disregard for procedure, Plaintiff only needs to show “the agency action affects [his]
interests in a personal way.” Id. As described above, supra section IV(B)(2)(a), Defendants
Executive Orders rendered Plaintiff subject to criminal liability for exercising his Second
Amendment rights in a fashion that was previously undeniably legal. Thus, Defendants’ actions

20

Docket No. 1 ¶99
11

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 15 of 18

clearly have affected Plaintiff’s interests in a personal way, and Plaintiff has standing to
challenge Defendants’ procedural deficiencies.
c. SSA Rule
Defendants’ Executive Orders stated “[t]he Social Security Administration will begin the
rulemaking process to include information in the background check system about beneficiaries
who are prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons.”21 “The reporting that
SSA…is expected to require will cover appropriate records of the approximately 75,000 people
each year who have a documented mental health issue, receive disability benefits….”22 As such,
the clear result of such rule would be to preclude a whole new subset of individuals from
purchasing firearms legally, and thus restraining their Second Amendment Rights.
Currently, Under 27 C.F.R. 478.32, implementing Title I, State Firearms Control
Assistance (18 U.S.C. Chapter 44), of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (82 Stat. 1213), as amended,
a person is denied the right to buy a firearm (a dealer may not sell to them) who has been
formally adjudicated by a competent court to be….“a mental defective or has been committed to
a mental institution.” Reports from the judicial branch as to who has been convicted of a felony
or adjudicated mentally incompetent, etc., are entered into NICS, which is managed by the
Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). 28 C.F.R. 25. Now, the Executive Orders have
effectively mandated that the SSA’s determination of “mental health reasons” be implemented in
the determination of who qualifies to legally purchase a firearm. As such, Plaintiff, who prior to
the Executive Orders, would undeniably have qualified as a legal purchaser of firearms because
Plaintiff had never been “formally adjudicated by a competent court to be…a mental
defective…” now suddenly is subject to determination from the SSA as to his mental fitness to
21
22

Docket No. 8-3
Id. (emphasis added)
12

Case 9:16-cv-80087-DMM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/27/2016 Page 16 of 18

purchase a firearm. The SSA is not subject to the same procedures as those of a competent court,
and can insofar as it reports relevant data to NICS, it can just easily report inaccurate or
fabricated information. Plaintiff stands to be affected by such a sweeping and arbitrary change
that violates Plaintiff’s constitutional rights to privacy. Taken as true, Plaintiff’s Complaint
alleges that:23
Under the Defendants’ new January 4, 2016, initiative, persons including the
Plaintiff can lose their rights under the Second Amendment without the due
process of law for that liberty interest under the Fifth Amendment, merely by the
subjective opinion of someone that they have a mental health issue. However,
even now those who disagree with the Defendants are being labeled as mentally
ill for disagreeing with politically correct opinions. Indeed, some activists argue
that owning a gun is a sign of mental illness. Sadly, as we consider the long-term
political durability of our nation even long after the current President has left
office, it is an undeniable matter of historical fact that dissidents from the political
opinions of the government have been suppressed by falsely labeling those
dissidents as having mental health issues, famously on a massive scale in the
Soviet Union and the Nazi Third Reich.
As a direct result of Defendants’ Executive Orders, Plaintiff’s ability to legally purchase
a firearm went from undeniably qualified to suddenly in question due to the SSA’s newfound
and overbroad authority to violate one’s right to privacy in order to determine who is “mentally
fit”. This is a concrete, particularized, and actual injury to Plaintiff’s Second Amendment rights
directly caused by Defendants’ Executive Orders. Similar to Plaintiff’s other claims, such harm
is immediately redressable by this court upon a declaration that Defendants’ actions are illegal
and invalid and that the status quo must be restored.
V.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny the

Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.
