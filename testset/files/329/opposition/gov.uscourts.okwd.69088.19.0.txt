RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PETITIONER’S
MOTION FOR PRE-PETITION DISCOVERY
AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT
COMES NOW the Respondent, Marty Sirmons, Warden, Oklahoma State
Penitentiary, by and through Seth S. Branham, Assistant Attorney General, and provides
the following response in opposition to Petitioner’s Motion to Permit Discovery (Doc. 18)
filed with this Court on August 22, 2008.
I
Petitioner, an Oklahoma death row inmate, was convicted in the District Court of
Oklahoma County for the first degree murder of his employer, Barry Van Treese, and was
sentenced to death. The OCCA affirmed on direct appeal, Glossip v. State, 157 P.3d 143
(Okla. Crim. App. 2007), and denied state post-conviction relief. Glossip v. State, No.
PCD-2004-978 (Okla. Crim. App. Dec. 06, 2007) (unpublished). The Supreme Court
thereafter denied certiorari review. Glossip v. Oklahoma, __U.S.__, 128 S. Ct. 1124
(2008). Petitioner was appointed habeas counsel to facilitate the preparation and filing of
a § 2254 petition with this Court. Docs. 5 & 10. After a scheduling conference before a

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 2 of 12

magistrate, Petitioner was ordered to file his § 2254 petition by November 1, 2008.
Additionally, any discovery requests by Petitioner were also ordered to be filed by
November 1, 2008. Docs. 12 & 13.
On August 22, 2008, Petitioner filed a pleading entitled Motion to Permit
Discovery which seeks an “order requiring the Respondent to permit counsel for the
Petitioner” to view and photograph certain demonstrative exhibits used by the prosecution
at Petitioner’s trial.1 These demonstrative exhibits consist of poster-sized pad sheets on
which the prosecution wrote portions of testimony in response to witness statements from
the stand. Both the prosecution and defense utilized such posters. The OCCA found on
direct appeal that “[t]he record is not clear whether these pads stayed up during the entire
trial” and that, in viewing the entire record, “we cannot say that the posters affected the
outcome of this trial” as both parties resorted to these posters and “[t]here is no argument
that the posters did not contain factual information.” Glossip, 157 P.3d at 155-56.
It should also be noted that while the prosecution retained the demonstrative
exhibits it used at trial, Petitioner informed the OCCA at oral argument on direct appeal
that the defense posters were apparently not retained and are no longer in Petitioner’s
possession.

Id. at 170 n.27 (Chapel, J., dissenting).

Further, the OCCA denied

Petitioner’s request to order the State to supplement the record on direct appeal with the

The demonstrative exhibits at issue are in possession of the Oklahoma County District Attorney’s
Office, not Respondent or undersigned counsel.

2

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 3 of 12

osters in its possession, finding that “inclusion of the demonstrative exhibits would not
affect our decision in this case.” Id. at 155 n.8.
Citing only sub-part (b) of Rule 6, Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, Petitioner
argues here that the requested discovery is necessary because it “will be a critical part of
the Petitioner’s effort to obtain relief from this court”, “[i]t will be impossible effectively
and truthfully to develop this proposition without viewing the posters” and “[i]t will be
impossible for this court to review this claim for error...without this court actually
viewing the items which have been the subject of considerable litigation at the state
level.” Doc. 18.
II
Petitioner has yet to file his § 2254 petition with this Court. As such, his request
amounts to a motion for pre-petition discovery which is not authorized under federal law.
Calderon v. United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Hill),
120 F.3d 927, 927-28 (9 th Cir. 1997); Calderon v. United States District Court for the
Northern District of California (Nicolaus), 98 F.3d 1102, 1106-07 (9 th Cir. 1996); Orbe v.
True, 201 F. Supp. 2d 671, 677-81 (E.D. Va. 2002).

Pre-petition discovery is

impermissible for several reasons.
First, “a prisoner must outline factual allegations in a petition before the district
court will be able to determine the propriety of discovery.” Calderon, 98 F.3d at 1106. A
habeas petitioner is only entitled to discovery upon a showing of “good cause”, Smith v.
Gibson, 197 F.3d 454, 459 (10 th Cir. 1999), and that presupposes specific, exhausted

3

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 4 of 12

allegations before the court within a § 2254 petition. This Court does not even have the
state court record before it at this time, let alone Petitioner’s claims challenging his state
conviction and sentence, that would allow it to assess the merits of Petitioner’s discovery
request. Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-09 (1999) (noting Harris v. Nelson, 394
U.S. 286, 300 (1969) held “where specific allegations before the court show reason to
believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate
that he is...entitled to relief, it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities
and procedures for an adequate inquiry” and that Habeas Corpus Rule 6 was designed to
be consistent with Harris).
Second, Rule 6 discovery itself “is limited to ‘the processes of discovery available
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure’ and, with one inapplicable exception, the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not permit pre-complaint discovery.” Calderon, 98
F.3d at 1106. See also Orbe, 201 F. Supp. 2d at 678. Because this is not a case where
Petitioner seeks to perpetuate testimony by means of a deposition, see Fed. R. Civ. P.
27(a), his position is no different than any other civil litigant in federal court: “civil
litigants cannot commence discovery until the plaintiff has filed a complaint.” Orbe, 201
F. Supp. 2d at 678.

This conclusion is consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 2246's explicit

command in the habeas statute that evidence may be taken “[o]n application for a writ of
habeas corpus”, id. at 680, and the Supreme Court’s holding that “a habeas suit begins
with the filing of an application for habeas corpus relief–the equivalent of a complaint in
an ordinary civil case.”

Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 208 (2003). See also

4

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 5 of 12

Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 530 (2005) (“for purposes of § 2244(b) an
‘application’ for habeas corpus relief is a filing that contains one or more ‘claims[ ]’” and
that a ‘claim’ as used in § 2244(b) is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state
court’s judgment of conviction”); Orbe, 201 F. Supp. 2d at 679 (“[a] habeas proceeding is
generally commenced by the filing of a habeas petition”). Because Petitioner has yet to
file his habeas petition with this Court, he has not commenced habeas proceedings for
purposes of obtaining discovery or any other procedural or substantive relief. Thus, the
requested relief is not proper.
Third, merely because this Court has authority under McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S.
849 (1994) to appoint counsel to assist Petitioner with filing his § 2254 petition, that does
not mean he is also entitled to pre-petition discovery. “MacFarland held that a motion
for appointment of counsel and a stay of execution commences a capital habeas
proceeding only for those limited purposes.”

Orbe, 201 F. Supp. 2d at 679 (citing

MacFarland, 512 U.S. at 859). The Supreme Court reasoned in MacFarland that the
right to appointed counsel, bestowed by federal statute, would be meaningless unless it
attaches before the filing of a habeas petition and unless it implicates a district court’s
ability to stay the prisoner’s execution. “Significantly, however, MacFarland neither
holds nor suggests that a capital habeas proceeding is commenced for all purposes by the
filing of a motion for appointment of counsel and a stay of execution.” Id. at 678-80.
Indeed, the Supreme Court has rejected just such a proposition. Garceau, 538 U.S. at
208-09 (rejecting habeas petitioner’s argument that MacFarland informs whether

5

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 6 of 12

AEDPA applies to petition filed after Act’s effective date but where order appointing
counsel and staying execution were filed prior to Act’s effective date and finding AEDPA
applies to such a claim).
III
The meritless nature of Petitioner’s current motion, and conversely, the correctness
of the above argument and authority, are most evident when one considers the factual
context in which the instant request for discovery arises. Here, Petitioner seeks disclosure
from the State of demonstrative exhibits that were generated in response to witness
testimony in open court. There is no dispute that: (1) the posters were based upon, and
reflected, accurate witness testimony; (2) both the prosecution and the defense resorted to
use of such demonstrative exhibits; (3) Petitioner’s trial counsel had full view of these
posters at trial; (4) the defense posters were not retained by Petitioner’s counsel after trial;
(5) no photographic record exists to show how the various exhibits were displayed in the
courtroom at trial; (6) Petitioner advanced claims of error on direct appeal to his
conviction, based on the demonstrative exhibits and the alleged lack of record
surrounding them; and (7) the OCCA majority ruled that it did not need to see the
demonstrative exhibits in order to adjudicate this claim. Glossip, 157 P.3d at 155-56; id.
at 170 (Chapel, J., dissenting).
Absent an opportunity to review Petitioner’s specific federal challenges, as well as
the accompanying state court record supporting them, this Court will be unable to assess
whether Petitioner has shown “good cause” to warrant discovery. Even the dissent on

6

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 7 of 12

direct appeal acknowledged that “[s]ometimes the record is quite clear about what is
being written” on the demonstrative exhibits, id. at 168 n. 21, although both the dissent
and the majority criticized the prosecutor’s and trial judge’s observation that the record
was clear as to what was contained on the demonstrative exhibits. Id. at 155; id. at 169
(Chapel, J., dissenting).

The majority pointed out, however, that “the only way to

determine what was on the posters, in toto, is to search the record and note where it
appears that the prosecutor was writing on the note pad.” Id. at 156.
That is precisely what the State will do on habeas, just as it did in responding to
this claim on direct appeal.

And that is what this Court must do both in screening

Petitioner’s request for discovery and in determining whether habeas relief itself is
warranted. But this Court cannot perform that function without the state court record and,
at the least, the benefit of Petitioner’s specific challenges of constitutional error attacking
the

State’s

use

of

these

demonstrative

exhibits.

Hence,

from

a

practical

perspective–separate and apart from the legalities prohibiting the requested relief-Petitioner’s motion for pre-petition discovery should be denied.
As for Petitioner’s claim that he will be unable to develop fully this claim without
the posters, the State would point out that Petitioner’s direct appeal counsel somehow
managed to present alleged errors based on the demonstrative exhibits and state of the
record. Petitioner’s habeas counsel can no doubt do the same. Orbe, 201 F. Supp. 2d at
680 (“[a]ppointed habeas counsel in all cases can adequately perform their function
without prepetition discovery”). Indeed, the alleged absence of an adequate record was

7

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 8 of 12

one of the asserted errors upon which Petitioner sought relief on direct review. Glossip,
157 P.3d at 155 (“Glossip also claims that the trial court erred in refusing to include the
posters as part of the trial record”).

In this sense, the posters themselves are not

necessary, or even helpful, in presenting Petitioner’s future constitutional claims to this
Court. That is especially so considering that the OCCA majority indicated that it could
resolve this issue based solely on the existing trial record.
“Prisoners, such as [Petitioner], who come to federal court after having been
denied [ ] relief by the highest court of a state, may file a federal habeas petition that
raises the same issues contained in their state [ ] proceedings. Here, [Petitioner] could
have done that, but has not.”

Calderon, 98 F.3d at 1107.

See also 28 U.S.C. §

2254(b)(1)(A). The danger of a request for pre-petition discovery is that it becomes “a
thinly veiled attempt to justify fishing expeditions before the filing of first petitions”,
Calderon, 98 F.3d at 1107, resulting in the presentation of unexhausted and exhausted
claims by means of a mixed petition. Such is inconsistent with the secondary and limited
role of federal habeas vis-á-vis direct review, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 633
(1993), the comity afforded state court adjudications through the exhaustion requirement,
Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 273-74 (2005) and “the frequent recognition that AEDPA
limited rather than expanded the availability of habeas relief”. Fry v. Pliler, __U.S.__,
127 S. Ct. 2321, 2327 (2007).
These compelling concerns for federalism are needlessly endangered where, as
here, a habeas petitioner seeks discovery of materials that at best will lend support to a

8

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 9 of 12

run-of-the mill state law claim implicating a state high court’s supervisory authority over
its own trial courts. Federal courts have no supervisory authority over Oklahoma state
courts, English v. Cody, 146 F.3d 1257, 1262 (10 th Cir. 1998) (citing Harris v. Rivera,
454 U.S. 339, 344-45 (1981)), and the enforcement of the protections of the due process
clause is therefore a far more limited basis for review. See, e.g., Brecht, 507 U.S. at 633
(“the writ of habeas corpus has historically been regarded as an extraordinary remedy, ‘a
bulwark against convictions that violate “fundamental fairness”’”); Boyd v. Ward, 179
F.3d 904, 921-22 (10 th Cir. 1999) (“an error of state law might rise to the level of a
constitutional violation required for habeas relief if it resulted in a fundamentally unfair
trial”). “[I]t hardly bears repeating that “‘an error that may justify reversal on direct
appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack on a final judgment.’” Brecht, 507
U.S. at 634 (quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 165 (1982)). Simply put,
“[f]ederal courts are not forums in which to relitigate state trials.” Id. at 633 (quoting
Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 887 (1983)).
Here, Petitioner requests discovery materials not related to the investigation of his
case by the police, the prosecution or trial counsel. Nor does he suggest that exculpatory
material was withheld or false evidence presented at trial. Rather, he seeks discovery of
demonstrative exhibits made in open court, in full view of Petitioner and his counsel,
based on undisputably accurate witness testimony.

The underwhelming federal

constitutional basis of this potential claim (assuming such a federal basis was exhausted
by Petitioner), standing alone, is a sufficient basis to deny discovery even under normal

9

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 10 of 12

circumstances.

“‘[B]ecause a fundamental-fairness analysis is not subject to clearly

definable legal elements,’ when engaged in such an endeavor a federal court must ‘tread
gingerly’ and exercise ‘considerable self-restraint.’” Duckett v. Mullin, 306 F.3d 982,
999 (10 th Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v. Rivera, 900 F.2d 1462, 1477 (10 th Cir.
1990)). Indeed, the Supreme Court has cautioned federal courts to “bear in mind our
previous admonition that we “have defined the category of infractions that violate
'fundamental fairness' very narrowly."

Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 73 (1991)

(quoting Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (1990)). "Beyond the specific
guarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights, the Due Process Clause has limited
operation." Id.
Petitioner’s failure to retain the defense posters further counsels against the
requested discovery. Petitioner reasons that the prosecution’s posters should be disclosed
so he may “effectively and truthfully...develop this proposition”. Doc. 18 at 3. Using this
logic,

however,

Petitioner’s

counsel

will

not

be

able

to

“effectively

and

truthfully...develop this proposition” in any event because the defense posters were
discarded by defense counsel. Hence, the danger of a misleading, one-sided presentation
of purported error by Petitioner is great. Merely submitting the prosecution’s posters for
review to this Court, without any firm establishment of their placement in the courtroom
or, for that matter, even the dimensions of the courtroom, risks taking the posters
completely out of the context of the trial process in which the jury observed them,
especially when the defense posters are redacted from the mix.

10

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 19 Filed 08/28/08 Page 11 of 12

Finally, Petitioner’s argument that “[i]t will be impossible for this court to review
this claim for error...without the court actually viewing the items which have been the
subject of considerable litigation at the state level”, Doc. 18 at 3, begs the question:
“What claim?” Petitioner has presented no claim to this court because he has not filed his
§ 2254 petition.

His argument confirms the obvious, namely, that he must actually

present a constitutional claim to this court before he may attempt to invoke the discovery
devices contained within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It is only when he has
done so that this Court may evaluate whether it, in fact, can adjudicate the merits of
Petitioner’s substantive constitutional claims by resort to the record–as observed by the
OCCA--or whether the requested discovery is necessary.
IV
All things considered, Petitioner’s motion for pre-petition discovery should be
denied.
