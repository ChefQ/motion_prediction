RICHARD GLOSSIP,
Petitioner,
vs.
MARTY SIRMONS, Warden
Oklahoma State Penitentiary,
Respondent.

Case No..CIV-08-326-HE

MOTION TO PERMIT DISCOVERY

COMES NOW the Petitioner, Richard Glossip and moves the court for an order
permitting production of certain documents.
1.

This motion is made pursuant to Rule 6, Section 2254 Rules and Forms
effective December 1, 2004:
"A party requesting discovery Olllst provide reasons for the
request. The request must also include any proposed
interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify
any requested documents."

2.

In Petitioner's trial, the state posted approximately a dozen large posters
which were created contemporaneously with witnesses' testimony. The
record reflects that these posters were on display, over objection of the
Petitioner throughout the trial. These posters were characterized by both
trial counsel and state appellate counsel as a running closing argument. It
was also alleged that these posters effectively violated the rule against
1

sequestration as later witnesses could view these summaries during their
subsequent testimony.
3.

The trial court refused Petitioner's request to permit the posters to be
included in the record for purposes of appeal. This conviction and
sentence were affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals by
a vote of three to two. The affirming majority considered the proposition
regarding the failure to include the posters in the record. It said: "If a trial
court is going to allow these types of demonstrative aids during trial, the
trial court shall assume the responsibility of insuring that these aids are
made a part of the record, as court's exhibits, when asked. The total
recalcitrance of the trial court to allow a record to be made creates error
in itself." Glossip vs. State 157 P. 3d 143,2007 OK CR 12 (2007).
The court then concluded that the failure to include these posters was
harmless error.
As suggested above, this issue closely divided the court. The dissent
concluded in part: ".. .I find that the trial court's decision, over defense
objection, to allow the State to post summaries of witness testimony
throughout the courtroom and to leave these demonstrative exhibits visible
to jurors and later witnesses, from the time they were first crafted until the
conclusion of the first stage of Glossip's trial, was an abuse of discretion.
I also find that the trial court's denial of defense counsel's clear and
reasonable request to allow these exhibits to be either preserved intact or
digitally photographed, for review by this court, was likewise an abuse of
discretion. The trial court's actions in this regard were totally unjustified
and prejudiced Glossip's right to a fair trial and an informed consideration
of his claims on appeal." Glossip, at 31.

4.

The posters have never been obtained by any lawyer for the Petitioner.
It is anticipated that this issue will be a critical part of the Petitioner's
effort to obtain relief from this court.
On August 14, 2008, the undersigned counsel contacted Assistant
Attorney General Seth Branham to request an opportunity to view the
posters. Mr. Branham advised that the posters were in the possession of
the Oklahoma County District Attorney's office and that he would advise
of the state's position regarding the production of the posters. On August
2

Case 5:08-cv-00326-HE Document 18 Filed 08/22/08 Page 3 of 4

15,2008, Mr. Branham stated that he had spoken with Assistant District
Attorney Gary Ackerly, one of the trial prosecutors, and that the state
would not voluntarily pennit Petitioner's lawyers to view or copy the
posters.
5.

It will be impossible effectively and truthfully to develop this proposition
without viewing the posters. It will be impossible for this court to review
this claim for error which might merit a new trial or a new appeal without
this court actually viewing the items which have been the subject of
considerable litigation at the state level.

THEREFORE, the Petitioner requests that the court issue and order requiring the
Respondent to pennit counsel for the Petitioner to view all posters used by the state
during the trial of this case and to make digital copies of same.
