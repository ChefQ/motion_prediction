PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS' MOTION IN LIMINE
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Plaintiff Christine C. Anderson, by her attorneys, Beranbaum Menken Ben-Asher &
Bierman LLP, submit the herein memorandum of law in opposition to defendants' Motion in
Limine.

I,
CORRADO'S ANTICIPATED TRIAL TESTIMONY IS PROPER

Defendants correctly observe that Nicole Corrado, a former co-worker of Anderson at the
DDC, testified at her deposition about defendant Sherry Cohen's racially offensive remarks and
disparate treatment of minorities. The Court in its summary judgment decision, however,
dismissed plaintiff's racial and national origin discrimination claims. Therefore, notwithstanding
defendants' doubts, plaintiff has absolutely no intention of having Corrado testify at the trial on

matters relating to Cohen's alleged racial bias.
Case 1:07-cv-09599-SAS Document 107 ~~ Filed 07/21/2009 Page 6 of 20

Likewise, counsel has no intention of eliciting from Corrado "personality and character
attacks" on Cohen unrelated to the issues at trial. However, plaintiff properly does intend to have
Corrado testify, among other things, about Cohen's harassment of Anderson. Such testimony
clearly is relevant to the issue of whether Cohen and the other defendants retaliated against
Anderson for her speech about DDC whitewashing.

I.
AS PLAINTIFF'S TREATING PHYSICIAN, DR. CARRERA
MAY GIVE HIS OPINIONS ARISING OUT OF HIS TREATMENT
OF PLAINTIFF, INCLUDING HIS PROGNOSIS FOR HER

Defendants characterize Dr. Carrera as an expert witness and essentially make a Daubert
challenge in an attempt to exclude his testimony. In fact, Dr. Carrera is Anderson's treating
physician and is being called to testify in that capacity, not as an expert witness. The Joint Pre-
Trial Order makes this abundantly clear. It lists Dr. Carrera as "Plaintiff's Witness," and not as
an "Expert Witness."

Dr. Carrera, as a treating physician, "may testify about opinions formed during the course
of treatment without regard to disclosure requirements of Rule 26(a)(2)." Smith v. Crown Ltd.
Trucks, No. 04 Civ. 2866 (GEL), 2007 WL 1467970, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 16, 2007) (quoting

Lewis v. Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Auth., No. 97 Civ. 0607, 2001 WL 21256, at * 1

(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2001)); see also Palmieri v. Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc., No. 98 Civ. 2037,

 

Earlier in the litigation, plaintiff had identified Dr. Carrera as an expert witness
and defendants objected. At a court conference, Magistrate Judge Peck cast doubt on the
appropriateness of plaintiff's use of Dr. Carrera as an expert witness entitled to payment for his
deposition. Plaintiff did not pursue calling Dr. Carrera as an expert witness. When defendants
deposed Dr. Carrera, plaintiff did not request payment for his time as she would have done had
he attended as an expert witness.

 
Case 1:07-cv-09599-SAS Document 107 ~~ Filed 07/21/2009 Page 7 of 20

2000 WL 310341, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2000) (collecting cases holding that a treating

physician's testimony may include opinions).

REDACTED pursuant to Stipulation and Order of Confidentiality,

dated February 20, 2008.

Defendants' position is contrary to precedential authority within this Circuit. The courts
in this Circuit have made clear that a treating physicians may give opinions relating to the
treatment of their patient, including the cause of the condition and prognosis. The district court
in Derienzo v. Metropolitan Transit Auth. and Metro-North RR, No. 01 Civ. 8138 (CBM), 2004
WL 67479, at *2 (Jan. 15, 2004), cited numerous trial court decisions in stating:

[treating physicians] are witnesses testifying to the facts of their examination,

diagnosis and treatment of a patient. It does not mean that the treating physicians

do not have an opinion as to the cause of an injury based upon their examination

of the patient or the degree of injury in the future. These opinions are a necessary

part of the treatment of the patient. Such opinions do not make the treating

physicians experts as defined by Rule 26(b)(2).

Although the defendants cite Smith v. Crown Lynch Trucks as authority for their position, the
district court there actually allowed the treating physician to opine, [REDACTED], that his

patient's prognosis was "guarded," and that he was likely to have pain for the rest of his life.

Smith, 2007 WL 1467970, at *4.

Further, defendants distort the meaning of Dr. Carrera's report.

REDACTED pursuant to Stipulation and Order of Confidentiality,

dated February 20, 2008.

A family physician is very qualified to find that his patient
engages in a reduced level of intellectual activities, such as reading or going to the opera.
HI.
RUMORS OF CAHILL AND COHEN RECEIVING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT
The crux of plaintiff's First Amendment claim is that DDC and Court officials retaliated

against her for engaging in protected speech about agency whitewashing of the public's
complaints of attorney misconduct. Whether or not the DDC's Thomas Cahill or Cohen received
preferential treatment as a result of the whitewashing, or they arranged for a quid pro quo deal, is
irrelevant to this action and unnecessary to prove in order for plaintiff to prevail. Plaintiff has no
intention of testifying about "rumors" of Cahill and Cohen receiving professional favors for
giving lenient treatment to wrongdoing attorneys. Plaintiff does intend to testify, as she did at
her deposition, that Cahill, in dismissing cases, was improperly motivated by his desire to reduce

his agency's docket. See Beranbaum Aff., Ex. 1, Plaintiff Dep. at 129.

 
Case 1:07-cv-09599-SAS Document107 ~~ Filed 07/21/2009 Page 9Q of 20

IV.
PLAINTIFF EXERCISED PROTECTED SPEECH IN CONNECTION
WITH THE "JG" INCIDENT, AND THEREFORE EVIDENCE
RELATING TO THE INCIDENT IS RELEVANT AND ADMISSIBLE

The circumstances surrounding the "JG" matter are as follows: Plaintiff was assigned to
investigate JG's complaint of attorney misconduct. She "uncovered overwhelming concrete
evidence of misconduct on the part of the respondent." Second Am. Complaint 741. Plaintiff
recommended that the respondent be brought up on charges. Her case load supervisor approved
the recommendation, and referred the recommendation to DDC chief Cahill. Id. The file was
then reassigned to another DDC staff attorney. Beranbaum Aff., Exhibit 1, Plaintiff Dep. at 115.

Sometime after the reassignment of "JG," Anderson made inquiries about its disposition.
She learned that the complaint had been dismissed and never presented to the DDC Policy
Committee for review. Second Am. Complaint { 42. Anderson was shocked given that her
investigation had established substantial evidence of attorney misconduct. Subsequently,
Anderson reviewed the case file and found that a great deal of the evidence that she had obtained,
along with memos to the file, were missing. Beranbaum Aff., Exhibit 1, Plaintiff Dep. at 113.

The following week, plaintiff reported to Cahill that the JG file "had been gutted." Id. at
122. She told Cahill:

I said, Tom, this is extremely troubling ... it is outrageous and you haven't even

heard of the things that [the respondent] did. I said the same thing again, it was

becoming my mantra. I said, Tom, this cannot be allowed to happen. This should
be reopened. I said this is how we screw the public. This should be reopened.

The significance of "JG" is not, as defendants suggest, whether Cahill was involved in

 
Case 1:07-cv-09599-SAS Document107 ~~ Filed 07/21/2009 Page 10 of 20

"sutting" the file. Rather, the significance of the case for purposes of Anderson's First
Amendment claim is that plaintiff expressed to Cahill that the DDC had inexplicably dismissed a
meritorious attorney misconduct complaint; the case file was gutted; and the handling of the case
exemplified how the agency was not living up to its statutory mission.
In sum, in connection with "JG," Anderson exercised her free speech right regarding
whitewashing at the DDC, and evidence regarding the incident is clearly relevant and admissible.
V.

PLAINTIFF TRANSCRIBED ALL SHORT
HAND NOTES REQUESTED OF HER

Regarding plaintiffs shorthand notes, defendants try to create a controversy where none
exist. Although not required to do so, plaintiff transcribed all of the short hand notes that she
was asked to do. Plaintiff has not included on her exhibit list any untranscribed short hand notes.
Should an unanticipated factual issue arise about which plaintiff wrote a short hand note that
defendants did not ask her to transcribe, there is no reason that the note cannot be used to refresh
her recollection. The issue is premature, however, since plaintiff does not anticipate introducing
or relying upon any untranscribed notes at trial.

VI.

THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFYING BIFURCATION

Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), the Court, in its discretion, may bifurcate the trial of an
action for "convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to
expedition and economy." See Dallas v. Goldberg, 143 F. Supp.2d 312, 315 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).

Although the decision to bifurcate a trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, it is
