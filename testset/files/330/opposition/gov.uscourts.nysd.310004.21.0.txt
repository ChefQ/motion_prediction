INTRODUCTION
Defendants FUJIFILM Corporation, FUJIFILM U.S.A., Inc. (“Fujifilm U.S.A.”) and
FUJIFILM Recording Media Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc. (“Fujifilm RMM”) (collectively,
“Fujifilm”) respectfully oppose the motion to remand of plaintiff Discovision Associates
(“DVA”) for the following reasons:
Fujifilm has properly removed this action to this Court based on two separate and
independent grounds: (1) diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 1441; and (2)
original and exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts over matters arising under patent laws
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1338 and 1441.
On the first ground, removal is appropriate because DVA has named two FUJIFILM
Corporation affiliates – Fujifilm U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM – that have no rights or duties under
the “Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement for Disc Products and Recordable Media” (the
“Patent License”) that forms the basis for DVA’s claims in this action. Recognizing that the
Patent License makes no mention of either of Fujifilm U.S.A. or Fujifilm RMM, DVA attempts
to twist the language of the Patent License to fit its argument that the two entities should be
bound by the Patent License because FUJIFILM Corporation should have identified them as
sublicensees. But DVA’s argument is contradicted by the language of the Patent License and by
governing case law. If Fujifilm U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM are not proper parties to this action,
as they clearly are not, then this Court unquestionably has removal jurisdiction over this action
under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 1441.
If the Court retains removal jurisdiction based on the diversity between the properlynamed parties to this action – DVA and FUJIFILM CORPORATION – then it need not reach the
second ground set forth in the Notice of Removal. The Court instead may defer ruling on issues

1

Case 1:07-cv-06348-PAC

Document 21

Filed 09/26/2007

Page 6 of 19

relating to the interpretation and application of the Patent License until later in the case, because
removal jurisdiction based on diversity of the parties has already been established.
Alternatively, if the Court elects to address Fujifilm’s second ground for removal, DVA’s
challenge to this Court’s removal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1338 and 1441 also must be
rejected. Under the plain language of the Patent License, a royalty obligation attaches only to
products that practice one or more of the DVA patents listed in Appendix A to the Patent License
(the “Licensed Patents”). To succeed on its claim for unpaid royalties, therefore, DVA
necessarily must prove that the products that are the subject of its claim practice one or more of
the Licensed Patents. That claim presents a substantial question of federal patent law that
independently supports this Court’s jurisdiction. DVA’s argument that Fujifilm owes royalties
under the Patent License regardless of whether its products practice the Licensed Patents is, once
again, contradicted by the language of the contract. And controlling precedent clearly
establishes Fujifilm’s right to a federal court forum for issues relating to the construction and
application of the Licensed Patents, regardless of whether DVA has pleaded its claim as a
contract action. Accordingly, DVA’s motion to remand must be denied.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On June 4, 2007, DVA filed a Complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, which asserts a breach of contract claim under the Patent License.
Fujifilm timely removed the action to this Court on July 11, 2007.
The Patent License that provides the basis for DVA’s claims is attached to DVA’s
Complaint. In its first paragraph, it explicitly states that it is an agreement between DVA and
FUJIFILM Corporation (previously named Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd), with an effective date of
January 1, 1995. In the Patent License, DVA granted FUJIFILM Corporation “a worldwide,

2

Case 1:07-cv-06348-PAC

Document 21

Filed 09/26/2007

Page 7 of 19

non-exclusive, royalty bearing license under the Licensed Patents.” Patent License § 3.1. DVA
did not grant FUJIFIM Corporation a license “either expressly or by implication, estoppel, or
otherwise, other than under the Licensed Patents. Id. § 3.2. Section 2.10 of the Patent License
defines “Licensed Patents” as “all patents owned by DVA as of the effective date of this
Agreement . . . and any patents . . . issuing from pending patent applications owned by DVA as
of the effective date of the Agreement . . . under which patents and patent applications . . . DVA
has, as of the effective date of this Agreement, the right to grant licenses to LICENSEE of the
scope granted herein . . ..”

An annually updated list of DVA patents is attached to the Patent

License as Appendix A.
The Patent License gives FUJIFILM Corporation the option of obtaining sublicenses for
its Affiliates in two ways. Under section 3.3 of the Patent License, the license granted to
FUJIFILM Corporation included a sublicense to FUJIFILM Corporation’s Affiliates that were
identified in Appendix B to the Patent License. Appendix B of the Patent License identified only
one affiliate – Fuji Magne-Disk Co., Ltd. – as a sublicense at the time the Patent License was
executed. The other way that FUJIFILM Corporation could procure a sublicense for an affiliate
under the Patent License was to transmit to DVA a written notice setting forth the names and
addresses of such additional affiliate to be covered. Patent License § 3.3. DVA has not and can
not allege that FUJIFILM Corporation provided a written notice to DVA which would have
caused Fujifilm U.S.A. or Fujifilm RMM to become a sublicensee under the Patent License and
there is no other way that either company could have become bound by the terms of the Patent
License. See Patent License § 3.4 (“Except as set forth in Section 3.3, LICENSEE is expressly
not granted the right to sublicense third parties under this Agreement.”).

In section 4.1 of the Patent License, DVA also granted FUJIFILM Corporation and its
affiliates identified in Appendix B of the Patent License an irrevocable release “from any and all
claims of infringement of the Licensed Patents” in exchange for a one time payment of $45,000.
Sections 5.0 and 6.0 of the Patent License, respectively, required FUJIFILM Corporation and
any affiliates who hold a sublicense to pay royalties and make reports for each product covered
by the license, i.e. each product that was covered by one or more of DVA’s “Licensed Patents.”
ARGUMENT
As set forth in the Notice of Removal, there are two independent grounds for removal of
this action. First, this action is removable under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 1441, based on the
complete diversity of citizenship among the properly-named parties. The only potentially nondiverse defendants to this action – Fujifilm U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM – are not parties to the
Patent License, and for that reason are not proper parties to this action. Second, this action is
removable under 28 U.S.C §§ 1338 and 1441 because DVA’s claims necessarily require
resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law. Under the terms of the Patent License,
DVA cannot obtain the relief it requests unless it can show that Fujifilm has manufactured or
sold products that practice the “Licensed Patents” identified in Exhibit A to the Patent License.
A.

Because Fujifilm U.S.A. And Fujifilm RMM Are Not Proper Defendants,
There is Complete Diversity of Citizenship Among the Parties to this Action.

It appears that DVA included Fujifilm U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM as defendants in this
action to avoid diversity among the parties and to prevent removal of this action to federal court.
The Second Circuit has made clear, however, that a plaintiff “may not defeat a federal court's
diversity jurisdiction and a defendant's right of removal by merely joining as defendants parties
with no real connection with the controversy.” Pampillonia v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., 138 F.3d 459,
460-61 (2d Cir. 1998). If, based on the pleadings, a plaintiff cannot “state a cause of action
4

Case 1:07-cv-06348-PAC

Document 21

Filed 09/26/2007

Page 9 of 19

against the non-diverse defendant in state court,” then joinder of that defendant is improper and
must be disregarded for purposes of determining diversity jurisdiction. Id. While the relevant
standard established by Pampillonia is not precisely the same as the standard applied in a motion
to dismiss, “the motion to dismiss standard remains a useful point of reference.” Kuperstein v.
Hoffman-Laroche, Inc., 457 F.Supp.2d 467, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); see also PSINet Liquidating
L.L.C. v. Bear Stearns & Co., Inc., No. 02 Civ. 6691 (GBD), 2003 WL 367863, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 19, 2003) (“Thus, under Pampillonia, supra, it is first necessary to evaluate defendants’
Motion to Dismiss with respect to the New York defendants so as to determine if there is any
possibility that plaintiff can state a cause of action against the New York defendants in state
court.”); Pelman v. McDonald’s Corp., 237 F.Supp.2d 512, 521 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“The
discussion of whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim against the outlets and McDonalds of
New York necessarily augurs the discussion, infra, of whether the Complaint should be
dismissed.”).
The Complaint itself demonstrates that there is no way for DVA to maintain a claim
against Fujifilm U.S.A. or Fujifilm RMM. Under New York law, “in order for someone to be
liable for a breach of contract, that person must be a party to the contract.” A & V 425 LLC
Contracting Co. v. RFD 55th Street LLC, 830 N.Y.S.2d 637 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (citing Smith v.
Fitzsimmons, 584 N.Y.S.2d 692 (App. Div., 4th Dept. 1992)); see also Henneberry v. Sumitomo
Corp. of America, No. 04 Civ. 2128(PKL), 2005 WL 991772, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2005)
(“[D]efendants rightly point out that, in order to sue for breach of contract, plaintiff must be a
party to the contract . . . .”); Levisohn, Lerner, Berger & Langsam v. Medical Taping Systems,
Inc., 10 F.Supp.2d 334, 344, (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (“to state a claim for breach of contract under New
York law, a party must allege: (1) the existence of an agreement between the parties . . ..”).

While DVA has asserted in conclusory terms “that Fujifilm RMM and Fujifilm US deal in
Licensed Products and are licensed under the License Agreement,” DVA Mem. 7, that assertion
must be disregarded, because it is flatly contradicted by the Patent License, which is attached to
and incorporated by reference in the Complaint.
It is a “bedrock principle” of New York law that “it is a court’s task to enforce a clear and
complete written agreement according to the plain meaning of its terms, without looking to
extrinsic evidence to create ambiguities not present on the face of the document.” 150 Broadway
N.Y. Assocs., L.P. v. Bodner, 784 N.Y.S.2d 63, 66 (App. Div., 1st Dep’t 2004). The Patent
License is clear and complete. As DVA is forced to acknowledge, the Patent License recites that
it is between DVA and Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. only, and Section 3.3 of the Patent License
states that a sublicense is granted only to those Fujifilm affiliates that are “identified in Appendix
B.”1 Appendix B does not list either Fujifilm U.S.A. or Fujifilm RMM. See also DVA Mem. at
3 (“Fujifilm Japan represented to DVA in §§ 4.1 and 4.2 and Appendix B of the License
Agreement that, as of January 1, 1995, its only Affiliate was Fuji Magne-Disk Co., Ltd.”). Thus,
neither Fujifilm U.S.A. nor Fujifilm RMM has any rights or obligations under the Patent License,
and neither is a properly-named Defendant. 150 Broadway, 784 N.Y.S.2d at 65 (“[W]here a
written agreement . . . unambiguously contradicts the allegations supporting a litigant’s cause of
action for breach of contract, the contract itself constitutes documentary evidence warranting the
dismissal of the complaint . . ., regardless of any extrinsic evidence or self-serving allegations
offered by the proponent of the claim.”); see also Manhattan Motorcars, Inc. v. Automobili
Lamborghini, --- F.R.D.---, No. 07 Civ. 978(SAS), 2007 WL 1988144 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2007)
1

DVA’s citation to FUJIFILM Corporation’s 2007 Annual Report for the proposition that Fujifilm
U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM are affiliates establishes nothing regarding FUJIFILM Corporation’s affiliates
as of the effective date of the Patent License, January 1, 1995. DVA’s citation to section 2.13 of the
Patent License, DVA Mem. at 2, also does nothing to help it. The section merely defines the term
“Affiliate,” and says nothing at all regarding who is bound by the Patent License.

(“At the motion to dismiss stage, where a plaintiff’s ‘factual allegations or legal conclusions are
flatly contradicted by documentary evidence, they are not presumed to be true, or even accorded
favorable inference’ in the context of a breach of contract action.”) (citation omitted).2
Recognizing that the clear language of the Patent License undermines their remand
argument, DVA offers two equally unavailing alternative theories for why Fujifilm U.S.A. and
Fujifilm RMM are bound by the Patent License, and therefore, proper parties in this action. First,
DVA provides an incorrect contract interpretation in asserting that “[w]hen other Affiliates
subsequently dealt in Licensed Products, Fujifilm Japan should have notified DVA under § 3.3
of the License Agreement so that DVA could track their activity.” DVA Mem. at 3. There is no
such notification obligation in Section 3.3 or anywhere else in the Patent License. Rather,
Section 3.3 obligates DVA to grant sublicenses to additional FUJIFILM Corporation affiliates
upon written notice from Fujifilm. At most, Fujifilm represented in section 3.3 that it had
authority to bind affiliates for which it requested a sublicense. DVA acknowledges, as it must,
that Fujifilm has never requested a sublicense for either Fujifilm U.S.A. or Fujifilm RMM.
Second, DVA asserts without legal or logical support that a failure by FUJIFILM
Corporation to include Fujifilm U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM on Appendix B somehow gives rise
to a contractual relationship between Fujifilm U.S.A. and/or Fujifilm RMM and DVA. DVA
Mem. at 7 (“Fujifilm Japan’s failure to comply with its obligations to notify DVA of Fujifilm
Japan’s Affiliates’ activities by adding them to Appendix B does not excuse them from their
contractual obligations.”). If FUJIFILM Corporation’s failure to list or add Fujifilm U.S.A. or
Fujifilm RMM could be considered a breach of the Patent License, such a breach would at most
2

Given that Fujifilm USA and Fujifilm RMM have no rights or obligations under the Patent
License, DVA could seek to initiate claims against them for patent infringement, if it were to contend that
those parties practice one or more DVA patents. Such claims, of course, clearly would come within the
jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) and would provide an additional basis for
removal jurisdiction if alleged.

7

permit DVA to bring a breach of contract claim against FUJIFILM Corporation. Such an alleged
breach by FUJIFILM Corporation could not possibly render separate corporate entities Fujifilm
U.S.A. and Fujifilm RMM liable under the Patent License, nor could it somehow allow DVA to
name them as defendants in this action. DVA has not cited any legal authority that supports its
novel theory.3
B.

Plaintiff’s Claims Require Resolution Of A Substantial Question Of Federal
Patent Law.

DVA’s arguments regarding jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338 are long on
rhetoric and dated citations regarding the “well pleaded complaint” rule. But DVA’s motion to
remand fails even to address the substantial on-point case law that establishes that this Court has
jurisdiction over this action, notwithstanding that the cause of action pled by DVA is on its face a
state law breach of contract claim.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), federal district courts have original and exclusive
jurisdiction over “any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.” The
proper starting point for an analysis of this jurisdiction is the Supreme Court’s decision in
Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800 (1988), which held that there are
two separate and independent inquiries for determining whether a federal court has jurisdiction
under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), either of which would make removal proper here.4 In Christianson,

3

The one case cited by DVA, BPL Development Corp. v. Cappel, 446 N.Y.S.2d 134 (App. Div.,
2d Dep’t 1982), is not on-point. It is a one page decision that held that the plaintiff could waive a
condition precedent for its benefit in a contract and enforce the contract despite the fact that the condition
precedent had not occurred. Id. at 135. The case did not involve, let alone sanction, the enforcement of a
contract against a non-party that is not specifically designated as a beneficiary in the contract. DVA has
not and can not point to a condition precedent in the Patent License the waiver of which by DVA would
give rise to liability on the part of Fujifilm U.S.A. or Fujifilm RMM.
4
DVA virtually ignores Christianson and relies primarily on Luckett v. Delpark, Inc., 270 U.S. 496
(1926), a case that was decided 66 years earlier. As the Federal Circuit has noted, “a number of Supreme
Court cases [including Luckett] concerning federal patent jurisdiction brought by parties who had
previously entered into licensing agreements were decided before the adoption of the Federal Rules of

8

Case 1:07-cv-06348-PAC

Page 13 of 19

the Supreme Court explained that, under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), federal court jurisdiction extends
to, and therefore removal is proper when, a “complaint establishes either that federal patent law
creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff’s right to relief necessarily depends on resolution
of a substantial question of federal patent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of
the well-pleaded claims.” Id. at 809 (emphasis added). Accordingly, and contrary to DVA’s
intimations, “merely because a claim makes no reference to federal patent law does not
necessarily mean the claim does not “arise under” patent law.” Id. at 809 n.3. Notably, and also
contrary to DVA’s assertions, the Federal Circuit has described Christianson as setting “a lenient
standard for jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a).” U.S. Valves, Inc. v. Dray, 212 F.3d 1368,
1372 (Fed. Cir. 2000).
Fujifilm does not claim that federal patent law creates DVA’s cause of action, but rather,
as explained in the Notice of Removal, this action was properly removed because DVA’s “right
to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law.”
Christianson, 486 U.S. at 809. Since the Supreme Court decided Christianson, at least three
different Circuit Courts of Appeals – including the Federal Circuit on numerous occasions – have
held that state law claims that require the resolution of a substantial question of federal patent
law, including whether a product practices the claims of a patent, give rise to federal court
jurisdiction. See, e.g., Arlaine & Gina Rockey, Inc. v. Cordis Corp., 175 Fed.Appx. 329, 331
(Fed. Cir. 2006) (“To prevail in its contract action for royalties, [Plaintiff] must show that the use
of Cordis' products was infringing the patent. As a result, [Plaintiff’s] right to relief depends on
the resolution of a substantial question arising under the patent law.”); U.S. Valves, 212 F.3d at

Civil Procedure.” Kunkel v. Topmaster Int’l, Inc., 906 F.2d 693, 696 (Fed. Cir. 1990). With regard to the
case upon which Luckett bases its holding, Wilson v. Sandford, 51 U.S. (10 How.) 99 (1850), the Federal
Circuit has explained that “Wilson was based on a prior distinction between law and equity now removed
by the federal rules” making it inapplicable to modern cases with similar facts. Kunkel, 906 F.2d at 696.

§ 1338 over state law business disparagement claim because “Additive Controls would have to
prove the falsity of Flowdata’s statement, which in turn would require Additive Controls to
prove noninfringement, an issue of patent law”).
DVA also ignores the fact that, when confronted with state law claims similar to those
asserted by DVA, other federal courts consistently have upheld federal court jurisdiction over
such claims. For example, in Highland Supply Co. v. Klerk’s Flexible Packaging, B.V., No. 05CV-482-DRH, 2005 WL 3534211, at *3 (S.D. Ill. Dec. 21, 2005), the plaintiff asserted “a statelaw breach-of-contract action arising out of a licensing agreement,” and the court was “faced
with the question of whether that action contains necessary patent-law issues causing the case to
arise under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a).” The court found “in the affirmative,” explaining that “in order
to prevail on their theory that Defendant breached the 1998 Agreement by manufacturing, selling,
developing, and/or improving products ‘covered’ by the ‘938 Patent, Plaintiffs will need to show

that the products in question relate to-or were ‘covered’ by that patent.” Id. at *4. Similarly, in
Kleinerman v. Luxtron Corp, 107 F. Supp. 2d 122, 123 (D. Mass. 2000), the plaintiff alleged that
“Luxtron did not report all sales of products using the patented technology as required by the
license agreement, thereby depriving him of royalty payments.” The plaintiff moved to remand,
arguing that his suit “alleges only state law claims arising out of the alleged breach of the
License.” The Kleinerman court ruled that it had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a)
and denied the motion to remand because, “in order to decide if there was a breach, one must
determine whether Luxtron infringed Kleinerman’s patents.” Id. at 124; accord, e.g., XCO Int’l
Inc. v. Pacific Scientific Co., No. 01 C 6851, 2003 WL 2006595 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 29, 2003)
(“[P]atent law has been found to apply to breach of contract cases were [sic] the only way to
demonstrate that a party breached a license agreement was to show that the product sold was
covered by the license agreement via an examination of whether the product sold was subject to
the patents in the license agreement.”); Regents of the Univ. of Minnesota v. Glaxo Wellcome,
Inc., 58 F. Supp.2d 1036, 1038 (D. Minn. 1999) (upholding federal court jurisdiction over state
law claim where resolution of the claim required “an analysis of whether defendant infringed the
Vince patents, as infringement is a necessary precursor to a finding that defendant has breached
the parties’ license agreement”).
This case is no different. Here, federal patent law is a necessary element of DVA’s wellpleaded breach of contract claim because DVA must establish that Fujifilm’s products practiced
the Licensed Patents in order to establish its claims for breach of the Patent License. DVA has
alleged that it is entitled to royalty payments under Section 5.0 of the Patent License. Compl. ¶ 4.
Section 5.1 of the Patent License establishes the scope of Fujifilm’s royalty obligations and
requires payment of royalties on the manufacture or sale (or use, lease or transfer) of each

11

Page 16 of 19

“Licensed Product,” but only insofar as the product “is licensed hereunder.” To determine
whether the manufacture or sale of each “Licensed Product” was “licensed hereunder,” and thus
royalty-bearing, the Court must look to Section 3.0 entitled “Non-Exclusive License Grant,”
which establishes the scope of the license. Section 3.2 specifically limits the scope of any
license granted by DVA as follows:
3.2. No license is granted by DVA to LICENSEE in this Section 3.0, either
expressly or by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, other than under the Licensed
Patents.
(Emphasis added.) Because the Patent License does not grant Fujifilm a license “other than
under the Licensed Patents,” and because no royalty duty is owed other than on the manufacture
or sale of Licensed Products for which Fujifilm “is licensed hereunder,” Fujifilm owes royalties
only for the manufacture or sale of “Licensed Products” that practice one or more of the
Licensed Patents.
In contrast with the plain meaning given to the terms of the Patent License by Fujifilm,
and without any citation to the Patent License, DVA claims that Fujifilm “must report and pay
royalties . . . whether or not in doing so they practice any DVA patent they are licensed to
practice.”5 DVA Mem. at 5. DVA relegates its discussion of the actual language of the Patent
License to footnote 4 in which it urges the Court to ignore the key terms of the Patent License
that are inconsistent with its current position. See DVA Mem. at 5-6 n.4. (referring to the terms
“is licensed hereunder” in Section 5.1 and “under the Licensed Patents” in Section 3.2 as
“neutral terms” that effectively can be ignored). Equally as bad, in its “Statement of Facts,”
DVA selectively quotes Section 2.7 of the License Agreement to imply that Fujifilm’s royalty
5

DVA’s citation to Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U.S. 827 (1950)
and Evans v. Watt, 194 F.Supp.2d 572 (E.D.Tex. 2001), DVA Mem. at 5, are not on point as no one
disputes that the parties could have contracted for Fujifilm to pay royalties regardless of whether they
practiced any of DVA’s patents. However, as explained previously, that is not the agreement the Parties
made.

payment obligations do not depend on whether its products practice any of the Licensed Patents.
These positions are contrary to New York law on contract interpretation, which governs the
Patent License, and which requires that “words and phrases . . . be given their plain meaning, and
the contract . . . be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.”
LaSalle Bank Nat. Ass'n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., 424 F.3d 195, 206 (2d Cir. 2005).
To the extent DVA is now arguing that the plain meaning of the Patent License terms
discussed above should be set aside in favor of its view of the “basic premise” of the parties’
agreement, see DVA Mem. at 2 & 6 n.4, that position is not supported by the language of the
Patent License or by governing law.6 Moreover, DVA has omitted from its submission to the
Court any mention of the fact that for the past several years DVA has been discussing with
Fujifilm whether Fujifilm’s optical media practice certain DVA patents. Declaration of
Tadayoshi Hirahara ¶ 3 (attached hereto). Thus, while it is unnecessary to consider extrinsic
evidence in light of unambiguous language of the Patent License, the course of conduct and
discussions between the parties further supports Fujifilm’s interpretation of the Patent License.
Tele-Pac, Inc. v. Grainger, 570 N.Y.S.2d 521, 528 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991) (“This consistent
course of conduct over the years and consistent acquiescence by [Licensor] in [Licensee’s]

DVA is wrong in suggesting that the Patent License should be read as embodying an unspoken
intent to avoid any possible future issues about whether products manufactured or sold by Fujifilm
practiced the Licensed Patents. DVA Mem. at 5 n. 4. By entering into the License Agreement, the parties
resolved an existing dispute regarding past sales, and they further established a royalty rate that would be
paid by FUJIFILM Corporation if it manufactured or sold Licensed Products in the future that practiced
the Licensed Patents. This is not only a sensible resolution of the issues that the parties confronted in
1995, but it is also very similar to the purpose and operation of the license agreements at issue in
Highland Supply, Kleinerman, and the other cases discussed previously on pages 10 and 11. Contrary to
DVA’s position, the parties did not, however, establish a regime in which FUJIFILM Corporation would
pay royalties on future manufacture and sales, including of new products manufactured with different
methods and structures, without regard to whether such products even practiced the Licensed Patents.
Indeed, the language of the License Agreement makes clear that, with respect to future manufacture and
sales of Licensed Products, the parties agreed on a fair royalty rate to be paid in the event the products
practiced the Licensed Patents, but they left open for further discussion and resolution whether such
manufacture or sales were covered by the Licensed Patents and therefore subject to a royalty obligation.

interpretation is the best and indeed conclusive evidence of the intent of the parties at the time
the contract was entered into.”).
CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, DVA’s Motion to Remand should be denied.
