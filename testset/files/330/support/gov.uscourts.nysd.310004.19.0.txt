Plaintiff Discovision Associates ("DVA") respectfully submits this memorandum of law
in support of its motion to remand this action to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for
the County of New York ("State Court") hi which DVA originally filed it. For the reasons set
forth below and in the accompanying declaration of Robert T. Braun ("Braun Decl."), the motion
should be granted and, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), DVA should be awarded its costs and
actual expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred as a result of Defendants' removal.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
It is "well-settled under the case law that the burden is on the party seeking to preserve
the district court's removal jurisdiction, typically the defendant, not the party moving for remand
to state court, typically the plaintiff, to show that the requirements for removal have been met."
14C Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction & Related Matters
§ 3739, at 424 (3d ed. 1998) (footnote 7 citing scores of cases omitted). In determining whether
Defendants have carried their burden, the controlling standard is the well-pleaded-complaint rule
under which a plaintiff like DVA is the master of its complaint and may decide what claims to
assert and whether to sue under state contract law or federal patent law (or both). DVA's
complaint is a straightforward effort to enforce its state-law contract rights under the parties'
License Agreement. Braun Decl. f 2 and Exh. 1 thereto, which is the same as Exh. 1 to DVA's
complaint; Answer f 3. DVA's complaint raises no issue of federal patent law. In addition,
there is no diversity of citizenship among the parties and one of the defendants is a citizen of the
forum state. For all these reasons, Defendants cannot carry their burden of establishing removal
jurisdiction and this action must be remanded to the State Court.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

The License Agreement

DVA and defendant Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. ("Fujifilm Japan") entered into the License
Agreement as of January 1,1995.l Recital 1.5 sets forth the parties' basic premise in
contracting:
"The parties, having examined the relative value to one
another of avoiding potential disputes over infringement of DVA
patents and determination of royalties due on past, present and
future sales, have independently concluded, in the interest of
convenience of the parties, that their respective business interests
will be best served by [Fujifilm Japan] taking a license under the
terms and conditions of this Agreement."
Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of the License Agreement authorize Fujifilm Japan and its Affiliates
(defined in § 2.13 of the License Agreement) to "make, have made, use, lease (rent) and/or
otherwise Transfer Licensed Products" without risk of infringing any of DVA's "Licensed
Patents" (defined in § 2.10 and listed in Appendix A to the License Agreement). Section 2.7 of
the License Agreement defines "Licensed Products" to be specific types of optical discs, Le.,
"Digital Discs" (e.g., CDs), "Video Discs" (e.g.. DVDs) and "Recordable Media" fe.g.. DVDRWs), without reference to whether Licensed Products practice any of DVA's Licensed Patents.
Section 5.1 of the License Agreement requires Fujifilm Japan and its Affiliates to pay DVA a
modest royalty on their activity involving Licensed Products, and § 6 of the License Agreement
requires Fujifilm Japan and its Affiliates to report periodically to DVA on such activity.
Under §§ 2.13 and 3.3 of the License Agreement, Fujifilm Japan's license extended
across the enterprise to any "corporation, company, or other business entity controlled by

1

Effective October 1,2006, Fujifilm Japan changed its name to FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation and
formed a new subsidiary called FUJIFILM Corporation to operate its business. Braun Decl. f 3 and Exh. 2 thereto.

[Fujifilm Japan]"2 and thus included the three Fujifilm Japan Affiliates named in DVA's
complaint. Fujifilm Japan represented to DVA in §§ 4.1 and 4.2 and Appendix B of the License
Agreement that, as of January 1,1995, its only Affiliate was Fuji Magne-Disk Co., Ltd. When
other Affiliates subsequently dealt in Licensed Products, Fujifilm Japan should have notified
DVA under § 3.3 of the License Agreement so that DVA could track their activity. Because the
notice requirement is for DVA's benefit, Fujifilm Japan's failure to notify is hardly a ground for
excusing it or its Affiliates from their reporting, payment and other obligations under the License
Agreement with respect to Licensed Products. See, e.g.. BPL Development Corp. v. Cappel. 86
A.D.2d 591,446 N.Y.S.2d 134 (2d Dep't 1982) (defendant required to perform despite failure of
condition that was for plaintiffs benefit).
B-

The Parties

DVA is a partnership whose two partners are Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. and Pioneer
Electronics Capital Inc., both of which are corporations organized under the laws of Delaware
and have their principal places of business in California. Braun Decl. f 1; Complaint f 1. For
jurisdictional purposes, therefore, DVA is a citizen of Delaware and California. E.g.. 13B
Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction & Related Matters § 3630,
at 682-89 (2d ed. 1984) ("each of [a partnership's] members must be considered in determining
whether diversity jurisdiction exists").
Defendant Fujifilm Recording Media Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc. ("Fujifilm RMM") is a
Fujifilm Japan Affiliate within the meaning of § 2.13 of the License Agreement. Complaint f 2;
Braun Decl. f 4 and Exh. 3 thereto (Fujifilm Japan's 2007 Annual Report at 49, 82 (identifying

its controlled subsidiaries for purposes of consolidated reporting)). See Defendants' Rule 7.1
Statements filed on July 11, 2007 (showing Defendants' Affiliate status). For jurisdictional
purposes, Fujifilm RMM is a citizen of Delaware, where (like DVA's two constituent partners) it
is incorporated. Complaint f 2; Answer f 2.
Like Fujifilm RMM, defendant Fujifilm U.S.A., Inc. ("Fujifilm US") also is an Affiliate
of Fujifilm Japan within the meaning of § 2.13 of the License Agreement. For jurisdictional
purposes, it is a citizen of New York, where it is incorporated. Complaint f 2; Answer f 2.
ARGUMENT
I.

DVA'S COMPLAINT DOES NOT "ARISE UNDER"
PATENT LAW OR REQUIRE RESOLUTION
OF ANY ISSUE OF PATENT LAW
As the United States Supreme Court has long held:
"[S]ince the plaintiff is 'the master of the complaint,' the wellpleaded-eomplaint rule enables him, 'by eschewing claims based
on federal law,... to have the cause heard in state court."
Holmes Group. Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems. Inc.. 535 U.S. 826, 831 (2002).
Accord Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams. 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987) (citing cases going back to 1913;
footnote and citation omitted):
"The presence or absence of federal-question jurisdiction is
governed by the 'well-pleaded complaint rule,' which provides that
federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented
on the face of the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint. The rule
makes the plaintiff the master of the claim; he or she may avoid
federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law."3
Defendants' assertion of a federal patent-law defense or a federal patent-law counterclaim cannot create
federal jurisdiction. Holmes. 535 U.S. at 831-32 (federal counterclaim insufficient basis for jurisdiction);
Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.. 486 U.S. 800, 809 (1988) (federal patent-law defense insufficient basis
for jurisdiction). Federal defenses and, following Holmes, federal counterclaims can be resolved in state court.
Lear. Inc. v. Adkins. 395 U.S. 653,675-76 (1969) (state court can resolve federal patent defense); Green v.
Hendrickson Publishers. Inc.. 770 N.E.2d 784,793 (Ind. 2002) (state court can resolve federal copyright
counterclaim).

This rule preserves the plaintiffs right to choose the forum and gives "'[d]ue regard for
the rightful independence of state governments' that [the Supreme Court's] cases addressing
removal require." Holmes. 535 U.S. at 832 (citation omitted); Zerafa v. Montefiore Hospital
Housing Co.. 403 F. Supp. 2d 320,324 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ("Removal jurisdiction is strictly
construed inasmuch as it implicates significant federalism concerns and abridges the deference
courts generally give to a plaintiffs choice of forum."). A further benefit is that the rule is clear
and easy to administer, thus permitting prompt resolution of jurisdictional conflicts without
having to address the merits of a case. Holmes. 535 U.S. at 832.
DVA alleges in 14 of its complaint that Defendants have violated §§5 and 6 of the
License Agreement. Under these contractual provisions, Fujifilm Japan and its Affiliates must
report and pay royalties if they make, have made, use, lease (rent) or otherwise transfer Licensed
Products, whether or not in doing so they practice any DVA patent they are licensed to practice.
That is what the License Agreement provides, and there is nothing unusual or inappropriate
about such an arrangement. E.g., Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research.
Inc.. 339 U.S. 827, 834 (1950):
"What [Petitioner] acquired by the agreement into which it
entered was the privilege to use any or all of the patents and
developments as it desired to use them. If it chooses to use none of
them, it has nevertheless contracted to pay for the privilege of
using existing patents plus any developments resulting from
respondent's continuous research."
See Evans v. Watts. 194 F. Supp. 2d 572, 576 (E.D. Tex. 2001) ("it appears from the language of
the licensing agreement that Plaintiffs could recover from Watts regardless of whether a covered
patent was actually infringed").4

4
In paragraphs 5 through 8 of their Notice of Removal, Defendants torture the language of the License
Agreement and subvert its basic premise by arguing that the reporting and royalty obligations they undertook arise
not if they make, have made, use, lease (rent) and/or otherwise transfer the Licensed Products defined in § 2.7, but

Case 1:07-cv-06348-PAC

Page 10 of 14

As pleaded, DVA's claims are for breach of the Licensing Agreement and do not arise
under patent law or require a determination of any issue of patent law. E.g., Luckett v. Delpark.
Inc.. 270 U.S. 496, 502 (1926):
"It is a general rule that a suit by a patentee for royalties
under a license or assignment granted by him, or for any remedy in
respect of a contract permitting use of the patent is not a suit under
the patent laws of the United States, and can not be maintained in a
federal court as such."
Accord 13B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction & Related
Matters § 3582, at 302-08 & nn.12-13 (2d ed. 1984) (quoting Luckett as the "leading case").5
Accordingly, there is no removal jurisdiction under Defendants' patent-infringement theory.
II.

THE JOINT DELAWARE CITIZENSHIP OF DVA AND FUJIFILM RMM
AND THE NEW YORK CITIZENSHIP OF FUJIFILM US
INDEPENDENTLY REQUIRE REMAND
Needless to say, if complete diversity of citizenship is lacking because two adverse
parties are citizens of the same state for purposes of jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(l) cannot

(footnote continued from previous page)
only if they actually use DVA's Licensed Patents in doing so. In other words, Fujifilm Japan and its Affiliates ask
the Court to construe the License Agreement not to have eliminated risk and to have avoided potential disputes but
to have preserved uncertainty and to have assured controversy. They do so by reading meanings into the neutral
phrase "is licensed hereunder" or "under the Licensed Patents" that are flatly inconsistent with the overall wording,
intent and premise of the License Agreement and its consistent use of the defined term "Licensed Products". Their
proffered contract interpretation would produce exactly the result that the parties sought to avoid by entering into the
License Agreement in the first place. In any event, the issue of contract interpretation that Defendants raise is not
jurisdictional but rather one addressed to the merits that the State Court can resolve. See 14B Wright, Miller &
Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction & Related Matters § 3721, at 331 (3d ed. 1998) ("the defendant
may not use removal proceedings as an occasion to adjudicate the substantive issues of a case").
5

Indeed, as the Federal Circuit observed in Beghin-Say Int'l Inc. v. Rasmussen. 733 F.2d 1568,1571 (Fed.
Cir. 1984):
"Wilson v. Sandford, 51 U.S. (10 How.) 99,13 L.Ed. 344 (1850) and its
progeny (Ausherman v. Stump, 209 USPQ 984 (10th Cir. 1981); Combs v. Plough,
Inc., 681 F.2d 469,216 USPQ 463 (6th Cir. 1982)), have consistently held
for over 130 years that contract disputes involving patents do not arise 'under
any Act of Congress relating to patents,' as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a)."

-640001127 1.DOC

Case 1:07-cv-06348-PAC

Page 11 of 14

support removal. Moreover, 28 U.S.C. § 1441 (b) precludes removal by a citizen of the forum
state. Because DVA and Fujifilm RMM are both citizens of Delaware and Fujifilm US is a
citizen of New York, removal was improper and this action must be remanded.
Based on their counsel's July 24 letter to the Court summarizing their position,
Defendants intend to argue in opposition to DVA's motion to remand that Fujifilm RMM and
Fujifilm US are not proper parties and should be ignored for purposes of removal and remand.
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Pampillonia v. RJR Nabisco. Inc.. 138 F.3d 459 (2d Cir.
1998), established a stringent test for resolving any such argument:
"In order to show that naming a non-diverse defendant is a
'fraudulent joinder' effected to defeat diversity, the defendant must
demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, either that there
has been outright fraud committed in the plaintiffs pleadings or
that there is no possibility, based on the pleadings, that a plaintiff
can state a cause of action against the non-diverse defendant in
state court. The defendant seeking removal bears a heavy burden
of proving fraudulent join[d]er, and all factual and legal issues
must be resolved in favor of the plaintiff."
138 F.3d at 461 (emphasis added; footnote 3 citing cases omitted). Accord Stan Winston
Creatures. Inc. v. Tovs "R" Us. Inc.. 314 F. Supp. 2d 177,182 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (quoting
Pampillonia) ("not sufficient to argue that the complaint fails to state a claim against that
defendant"); Dexter v. A C & S Inc.. No. 02 Civ. 6522 RCC, 2003 WL 22725461, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18,2003) (same).
The stringency of the test and the policies that underlie it compel remand of this action to
the State Court. DVA alleges that Fujifilm RMM and Fujifilm US deal in Licensed Products and
are licensed under the License Agreement. Complaint ff 2-4,15,16; Exh. 1 §§ 2.13 and 3.3. As
noted above, Fujifilm Japan's failure to comply with its obligation to notify DVA of Fujifilm
Japan's Affiliates' activities by adding them to Appendix B does not excuse them from their
contractual obligations. Resolving all legal and factual issues in DVA's favor and recognizing

that Defendants must show by clear and convincing evidence that there is no possibility, based
on the pleadings, that DVA can state a cause of action against Fujifilm Japan's Affiliates, they
clearly are proper parties for purposes of removal, and their presence requires remand under the
authorities cited above.

III.
UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), DVA SHOULD
RECOVER ITS COSTS AND ACTUAL EXPENSES,
INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, INCURRED AS
A RESULT OF DEFENDANTS' REMOVAL
Under the clear and stringent legal standards described above, Defendants did not have an
objectively reasonable basis for removal. Accordingly, under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), DVA should
recover its costs and actual expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred as a result of
Defendants' removal. Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.. 546 U.S. 132,139-40 (2005).
