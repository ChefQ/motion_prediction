Civil Action No. 2:65-cv-00031-DMB

JOINT RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S SUBMISSION OF SUPPLEMENTAL PROPOSED PLAN
AND DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE
Plaintiff-Intervenor United States of America (the “United States”) and Private Plaintiffs
(collectively, “Plaintiff Parties”) jointly object to: (1) the submission by Defendant Cleveland
School District (the “District”) of a supplement [Docs. 182 and 183-1] to its proposed
desegregation plans filed with this Court on January 23, 2015, and (2) the District’s Motion for
Continuance [Doc. 183] of the evidentiary hearing set to commence on May 18, 2015. In
support of these objections, the United States respectfully submits the following:
1.

The District’s submission of a third proposed plan (“Plan C”) for the Court’s

consideration at the hearing is untimely. Under the Court’s Order Modifying Scheduling Order,
dated December 17, 2014, the deadline for the parties to submit proposed plans was January 23,
2015. On that date, the parties submitted their respective plans. The District did not seek, nor

Case: 2:65-cv-00031-DMB-JMV Doc #: 184 Filed: 05/14/15 2 of 5 PageID #: 3146

has the Court granted, leave for any party to amend or supplement their proposed plans. Nor did
the District consult with the Plaintiff Parties or obtain their consent before filing its supplemental
proposal and the Motion for Continuance.
2.

The District’s submission of Plan C on the eve of hearing is prejudicial. The

parties engaged in extensive discovery, including a number of depositions, by the Court-ordered
discovery deadline of April 21, 2015. The United States retained expert witnesses to review and
provide opinions on the three proposed plans. The United States circulated its experts’ reports to
counsel for all parties by the Court-ordered deadline of March 20, 2015. The United States also
deposed the District’s witnesses on the plans submitted by the parties to the Court. Although the
United States will consider the District’s proposal or other proposals presented as settlement
offers, the Plaintiff Parties have no opportunity to properly assess or conduct discovery on Plan
C, which was first shared informally by the District’s counsel with counsel for the United States
in the last forty-eight hours. The District did not share Plan C with Private Plaintiffs before
filing it with the Court.
3.

Continuance of the hearing set for May 18, 2015 is unwarranted. In its March 3,

2015 Supplement to Order Modifying Scheduling Order, the Court stated that “the deadlines set
in this order, in the February 25 Order, and in the June 18, 2014, Scheduling Order, will not be
changed absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances justifying such relief.” [Doc. 125 at
2.] The District has made no showing of “extraordinary circumstances” justifying a
postponement of the scheduled hearing.
4.

The United States has scheduled travel for its attorneys, expert witnesses, and

litigation support staff to Greenville, MS, from across the country over the next several days.
Additionally, the Plaintiff Parties anticipate calling other fact witnesses from Cleveland,

including parents and community members, who have requested leave from work to participate
in the hearing next week. One or more of the Plaintiff Parties’ witnesses may be unavailable to
testify during the summer months.
5.

The parties have engaged in negotiations throughout the week, and the United

States is willing to continue confidential, good-faith settlement negotiations prior to next week’s
hearing. However, as the parties have discussed various options but reached no agreement on
any plan, the District’s request for a continuance at this juncture is premature, at best. The
Plaintiff Parties therefore oppose the District’s Motion for Continuance.
Based on the foregoing, the United States and Private Plaintiffs respectfully request that
the Court: (1) deny the District leave to submit Plan C for consideration by the Court at the
hearing next week, and (2) deny the District’s Motion for Continuance.
Respectfully submitted, this 14th day of May, 2015,
