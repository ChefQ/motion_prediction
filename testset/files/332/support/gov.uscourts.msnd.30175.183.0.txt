EDUCATION, et al.

DEFENDANTS

MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE

The Cleveland School District (the “District”) moves the Court to continue the hearing
set for May 18, 2015, and in support states as follows:
1.

During and following the mediation conducted in this case by Magistrate Judge

Jenny Virden on May 11, 2015, the District continued evaluating Plan A and Plan B as submitted
to the Court and began working to craft a new plan to specifically address many of the concerns
identified by Judge Virden, the Plaintiffs, and the Government during the mediation. The new
plan, “Plan C,” is a direct result of this process. Plan C is attached as Exhibit 1.
2.

The District discussed Plan C with the Government on May 12, 2015, and

presented a written plan on May 13, 2015, as part of the parties’ continued negotiations. To the
District’s knowledge the Government, continues to analyze Plan C and negotiations are on-going
at this very hour.

Case: 2:65-cv-00031-DMB-JMV Doc #: 183 Filed: 05/14/15 2 of 3 PageID #: 3137

3.

The District gives notice to the Court and the parties that it intends to present

testimony regarding Plan C during the upcoming hearing in this case.
4.

Although the parties did not reach a settlement during the mediation, the parties

negotiated for a full day, identifying areas of common ground, and almost reaching settlement.
The District remains optimistic that continued negotiations may produce a resolution.
5.

Using the time set aside for the hearing to continue mediation would: 1) avoid

unnecessary expense on both sides, particularly regarding costly expert travel and witness fees,
and 2) avoid a hearing on proposals now superseded by later, more advanced thinking triggered
by the mediation.
6.

Based on the latest ideas of all parties, the earliest possible implementation of any

additional desegregation objectives will not occur until the beginning 2016-17 school year.
Therefore, a brief delay in the proceedings to permit additional negotiations will not prejudice
the Government or Plaintiffs.
7.

Because this motion is straightforward and this is a matter within the sole

discretion of the Court, the District asks that the requirement to file a supporting memorandum of
authorities set out in Uniform Local Rule 7.4 be waived.
Respectfully submitted, this 14th day of May 2015.
