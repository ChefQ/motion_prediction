DEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE
TO PLAINTIFFS’ STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS

In accordance with Local Rule 56.1, defendants Jani-King International, Inc. (“JKI”),
Jani-King, Inc. (“JK”), and Jani-King of Boston, Inc. (“Jani-King of Boston”) (collectively,
“Jani-King”) hereby respond to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts in support of Plaintiffs’
Motion for Summary Judgment. Jani-King incorporates and refers herein to the declarations of
Dawn Dockery ( “Second Dockery Decl. [Dkt. 164]”), Michael Seid (“Second Seid Decl. [Dkt.
166],” and Don Burleson (“Second Burleson Decl.” [Dkt. 165]). Jani-King also incorporates and
refers herein to the declarations of Michael Seid (“Third Seid Decl.”) and Eileen Hunter
(“Hunter Decl.”), which have been filed in support of Jani-King’s combined Motion for
Summary Judgment and Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment.

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 2 of 26

In setting forth these facts, Jani-King does not concede all such facts to be true for
purposes of trial, but instead accept all such facts as true for purposes of their Motion for
Summary Judgment. Not every fact included in this statement is material to each alternative
legal theory pursuant to which the court may enter summary judgment. Jani-King provides
additional facts to support its position that summary judgment is inappropriate at this stage in a
separately-filed Statement of Undisputed Facts.

1.

Jani-King International is the “architect” of the Jani-King franchising system.

(Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 11).
Admitted.
2.

Jani-King International wholly owns Jani-King, Inc., and Jani-King, Inc. wholly

owns 18 regional offices. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶¶ 4-5).
Admitted.
3.

Jani-King of Boston, Inc. (“Jani-King Boston”) is one of those regional offices.

(Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 5).
Admitted.
4.

Jani-King Boston serves about 550-570 cleaning accounts. (Goffredo Depo., Exh.

M, at 61).
Admitted only to the extent that Mr. Goffredo’s deposition cited testimony
establishes that he did not have “an exact number” to which he could testify and
that he was testifying to his best recollection on that day.
5.

Jani-King Boston has about 120 “franchisees.” (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 63).

Admitted only to the extent the Mr. Goffredo’s cited deposition testimony
establishes that he was estimating the number of franchise owners who are
2

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 3 of 26

currently servicing accounts and that he did not have an exact number to which he
could testify.
6.

Of these “franchisees,” roughly 75 percent are unincorporated individuals who do

the “franchisee” work themselves. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 64-65; Mota Depo., Exh. N, at
36-37).
Denied. Mr. Goffredo’s cited testimony establishes that he did “not know offhand”
how many current franchise owners are incorporated and that he was hazarding a
guess when he testified that 25 to 30 percent of current franchise owners are
incorporated. The cited Goffredo deposition testimony does not address how many
current franchise owners perform “franchisee work themselves.” The cited
deposition testimony by Mr. Mota does not address how many current franchise
owners are incorporated and Mr. Mota’s testimony regarding how many franchise
owners “do the work on their own” is an estimate. The record establishes that JaniKing does not have any role in franchise owners’ decisions regarding whether to
hire employees and how to manage them. (Hunter Decl. Exs. H at 8-10; Ex. I at 11;
Ex. J at 13.) Franchise owners do not consult Jani-King regarding their hiring
decisions. (Hunter Decl. Exs. H at 9; Ex. I at 9; Ex. J at 13.)
7.

Jani-King Boston implements the franchising system developed by Jani-King

International. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 10).
Admitted.
8.

When Jani-King Boston sells a franchise, it submits all completed paperwork to

Jani-King International for review. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 13).
Admitted.

3

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 4 of 26

9.

Jani-King International hires and oversees Jani-King Boston’s “Regional

Director,” and, more generally, oversees the management and operation of the entire Jani-King
Boston office. It provides policies, procedures, forms, training materials, marketing materials,
reporting requirements, and other guidelines for Jani-King Boston’s operations. (Burleson Decl.,
Exh. L, ¶ 12-14, 21, 24-27; 2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶¶ 11, 17, 19, 24; Goffredo Depo., Exh.
M, at 12-14, 43, 67-68; Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 10-11, 19-21; Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 12-13).
Admitted.
10.

Jani-King International recently centralized some of the functions previously

performed by regional offices, including telemarketing and customer service. (Goffredo Depo.,
Exh. M, at 14-15, 87-88; Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 18).
Admitted to the extent this statement regards the centralization of telemarketing
and customer service functions and denied to the extent this statement regards any
other non-specified functions.
11.

All of Jani-King International’s departments are involved in preparing training

materials for cleaners, including training materials about cleaning techniques. (Burleson Depo.,
Exh. Q, at 11-12).
Admitted.
12.

Jani-King International has an Operations Department. (Burleson Depo., Exh. Q,

at 13). Jani-King International is currently hiring a Director of Operations to head its Operations
Department. (Website Excerpts, Exh. R, at 1-4). As stated in the job opening, “Applicant must
have extensive commercial cleaning experience.” (Id. at 2) (emphasis in original).
Jani-King admits that JKI has an Operations Department, that it has a job posted
for a Director of Operations, and that the website cited states that “Applicant must

4

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 5 of 26

have extensive commercial cleaning experience.” Jani-King further notes that the
website cited expressly states that the duties of the Director of Operations will be:
franchise relations and training; direct supervision of up to 10 reports, customer
relations; inspecting accounts; maintain a an acceptable customer retention rate;
starting and maintaining customer a counts; gathering and reporting production
numbers; mentoring subordinates; and providing sales support. (See Churchill
Decl. [Dkt. 186] Ex. R.)
13.

Among other employees and departments, Jani-King International has two

“speciality” departments – healthcare and hospitality – both of which develop training materials
about proper cleaning procedures. (Burleson Depo., Exh. Q, at 8-9).
Admitted.
14.

Jani-King International sends employees with cleaning operations experience to

regional offices to provide advice on new cleaning methods, among other subjects. (Burleson
Depo., Exh. Q, at 23-25).
Admitted to the extent that the phrase “cleaning operations experience” refers to
experience in Jani-King’s operations departments, which entail the duties set forth
in the Second Dockery Declaration [Dkt. 165] at ¶¶ 24-28. When JKI sends
individuals with operations expertise to corporate regional offices, the tasks
performed include “help[ing] the regional operations staff and franchise owners
with the startup process for large and/or specialized accounts” and “assist[ing] with
specialty account marketing, hospitality accounts, health care accounts, employee
training, and general marketing.” (Second Burleson Decl. ¶ 28.) It does not involve

5

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 6 of 26

performing cleaning services. (Churchill Decl. Ex. M at 83; Second Dockery Decl.
[Dkt. 164] ¶ 27.)
15.

Jani-King uses written franchise agreements. (Franchise Agreement, Exh. S).

Admitted.
16.

Jani-King International prepares all franchise agreement forms, so a regional

office only completes cleaner information, such as the type of plan. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at
93-94; Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 64-65).
Jani-King admits that JKI prepares all franchise agreement forms used by the
regional offices. Jani-King denies that regional offices complete “cleaner”
information. None of the testimony cited by Plaintiffs uses the term “cleaner” and
Jani-King does not refer to prospective franchise owners or franchise owners as
“cleaners.” (See generally Second Burleson Decl. [Dkt. 165]; Second Dockery Decl.
[Dkt. 164].) Regional offices may assist prospective franchise owners in completing
the paperwork necessary, including the franchise agreement. (Second Dockery
Decl. [Dkt. 164] ¶ 13.)
17.

Cleaners cannot negotiate over the terms of a franchise agreement. (Goffredo

Depo., Exh. M, at 92).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the deposition testimony cited does not
refer to “cleaners.” Jani-King admits that it does not negotiate the terms of written
franchise agreements with prospective franchise owners in Massachusetts.
18.

Cleaners are required to comply with Jani-King policies and procedures.

(Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 96).

6

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 7 of 26

Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the deposition testimony cited does not
refer to “cleaners.” Jani-King admits that franchise owners are required to comply
with Jani-King policies and procedures.
19.

Jani-King Boston monitors this compliance, and the cleaning performed by

cleaners, in at least three ways: inspections, customer service calls, and contact evaluations.
(Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 86-89, 97; Inspection Report, Exh. T).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the deposition testimony cited does not
refer to “cleaners.” Jani-King does not actively monitor a franchise owner's
compliance with the policies and procedures, but it does - in an effort to protect its
tradename, its goodwill, and its system-wide standards, perform inspections, make
customer service calls, and encourage the use of contact evaluation forms by
franchise owners. (See Second Burleson Decl. [Dkt. 165] ¶ 12.)
20.

Jani-King has the right to remove a cleaner from an account. (2d Dockery Decl.,

Exh. O, ¶ 26).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that it has the right to remove a franchise owner from
an account if the franchise owner has failed to perform his or her obligations
properly, pursuant to the terms of the Franchise Agreement or Policies and
Procedures Manual. (Second Dockery Decl. [Dkt. 164] ¶ 26.)
Facts Relevant to Usual Course of Business

7

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 8 of 26

21.

Jani-King’s franchise agreement states, “Franchisor is in the business of operating

and franchising professional cleaning and maintenance businesses….” (Franchise Agreement,
Exh. S, at ¶ 1.1). “Franchisor” is defined as “Jani-King of Boston, Inc.” (Id. at 2).
Admitted to the extent the language is written as stated, but denied to the extent that
Plaintiffs interpret this to mean that Jani-King performs commercial cleaning
services.
22.

In its cleaning contracts with clients, Jani-King states, “Jani-King is in the

business of providing commercial cleaning and maintenance services.” (Jani-King Maintenance
Agreement, Exh. U, at 1). “Jani-King” is defined as “Jani-King of Boston, Inc.” (Id.).
Admitted to the extent the language is written as stated, but denied to the extent that
Plaintiffs interpret this to mean that Jani-King performs commercial cleaning
services.
23.

Jani-King International is involved in the franchising of only one type of business:

commercial cleaning. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 4).
Admitted.
24.

Jani-King International regularly develops cleaning methods, procedures,

marketing materials, and training materials that are summarized in various manuals, DVDs, and
brochures. These are used by regional offices, such as Jani-King Boston, to provide initial and
ongoing training to franchise owners, and they are used by franchise owners in the course of
their work. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 14).
Admitted.
25.

Jani-King International’s website heralds its role as a leader in the commercial

cleaning industry. (Website Excerpts, Exh. R).

8

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 9 of 26

Admitted to the extent the language is written as stated, but denied to the extent that
Plaintiffs interpret this to mean that Jani-King performs commercial cleaning
services. The website cited also states that Jani-King is “[r]anked the world’s No. 1
Commercial Cleaning Franchise Company year after year.”
26.

Jani-King International owns the intellectual property that is derived from its

cleaning methods. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 15). This intellectual property creates goodwill on
behalf of Jani-King International, its subsidiaries, and cleaners. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 16).
Admitted to the extent that Jani-King owns the intellectual property derived from
its development and refinement of confidential, proprietary cleaning methods,
procedures, marketing materials, and training materials. (Second Burleson Decl.
[Dkt. 165] ¶¶ 14-15.) Denied to the extent that Jani-King does not use the term
“cleaners” to describe franchise owners.
27.

Jani-King International publishes a monthly newsletter for use by regional offices

and cleaners to promote the Jani-King brand and create goodwill for all parts of the Jani-King
system. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 19).
Admitted except to the extent that Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to
describe franchise owners.
28.

Jani-King Boston provides training on cleaning methods to franchise owners. (2d

Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 15). For example, franchise owners are taught how to strip and wax
floors, shampoo carpets, clean bathrooms, and clean offices. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 51, 75;
Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 34). On occasion, Jani-King International employees provide training, as
well. (Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 34-35).

9

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 10 of 26

Denied except to the extent that Jani-King admits that it provides new and existing
franchise owner with training regarding Jani-King’s confidential, proprietary
cleaning methods and procedures and that this training includes information
regarding, among other things, best practices regarding general commercial
cleaning techniques.
29.

Jani-King Boston also provides training on sales. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at

75).
Denied except to the extent that Jani-King admits that it provides new and existing
franchise owners with training regarding how to solicit and bid commercial cleaning
accounts. (See Second Dockery Decl. [Dkt. 164] ¶¶ 15, 16.)
30.

As part of the training, Jani-King Boston provides cleaners with written materials

prepared by Jani-King International, including materials on cleaning methods and techniques.
(2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 15).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that it provides franchise owners with written
materials prepared by Jani-King International, including manuals that include
some information on cleaning methods and techniques. (See Second Dockery Decl.
[Dkt. 164] ¶¶ 15.)
31.

Jani-King Boston provides advertising, accounting, and periodic operational

support to cleaners. As a normal part of Jani-King Boston’s day-to-day operations, its employees
regularly interact with cleaners to assist with various issues. This assistance may include offering

10

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 11 of 26

suggestions regarding how to address a disagreement with a client, how to address unique
cleaning issues, and how to solicit and bid accounts. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 16).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that it provides advertising, accounting, and periodic
operational support to franchise owners and that, as a normal part of Jani-King
Boston’s day-to-day operations, Jani-King of Boston employees regularly interact
with franchise owners to assist them in the operation of their franchise business,
which may include offering suggestions regarding how to address a disagreement
with a client, how to address unique cleaning issues, or how to solicit and bid
accounts. (See Second Dockery Decl. [Dkt. 164] ¶ 16.)
32.

Jani-King Boston works to obtain (and, if necessary, modify) cleaning contracts

for clients whose offices are then cleaned by cleaners. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 22; Goffredo
Depo., Exh. M, at 30; Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 70).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that Account Executives in the Jani-King of Boston
work with telemarketers “to obtain commercial cleaning contracts that are offered
to Jani-King of Boston franchise owners to service.” (See Second Dockery Decl.
[Dkt. 164] ¶¶ 22.)
33.

To obtain cleaning contracts, Jani-King Boston salespeople gather information

about a possible client account, “price out” the account, bid the account, deliver proposals,
follow up on proposals, and attempt to “close” the account. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 9, 30,

11

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 12 of 26

99). They also do “cold calls,” visiting buildings in an effort to develop new cleaning accounts.
(Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 44-45).
Admitted, but only to the extent that these accounts are obtained in order to be
offered to and serviced by the franchise owners.
34.

Jani-King Boston is a contracting party and “owns” these cleaning contracts;

cleaners are not parties to the contracts. (Burleson Depo., Exh. Q, at 32; Franchise Agreement,
Exh. S, ¶ 4.19.2; Jani-King Maintenance Agreement , Exh. U).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King otherwise admits that Jani-King of Boston is a contracting
party to cleaning contracts.
35.

It is Jani-King, not any of its cleaning franchisees, that is contractually obligated

to provide cleaning services. (Jani-King Maintenance Agreement, Exh. U, at 1).
Denied. Under their franchise agreements, franchise owners are contractually
obligated to provide cleaning services to accounts for which they have accepted the
right to perform services. (See Churchill Decl. Ex. S at § 4.10.) Franchise owners
sign an account acceptance form when they agree to accept Jani-King’s offer to
service an account. (See Hunter Decl. Ex. N.)
36.

Jani-King Boston provides cleaning services under these contracts by offering the

cleaning assignment to a cleaner. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 80-83; Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 18,
21--22).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to

12

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 13 of 26

“cleaners.” Jani-King Boston offers franchise owners the opportunity to accept and
service the customer accounts. The franchise owner may accept or decline the offer.
If they accept, their performance is governed by the terms of the Franchise
Agreement, maintenance contract, and the Jani-King Policies and Procedures (See
Churchill Decl. Ex. S at § 4.10.)
37.

In offering assignments to cleaners, Jani-King Boston relies on various factors,

including its legal obligations, its “moral” obligation, and a cleaner’s performance record.
(Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 104-107).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that the deposition testimony cited establishes that
Jani-King of Boston considers various factors when deciding which franchise
owners it offers the right to service an account.
38.

If a cleaner is not cleaning an account, Jani-King Boston would step in to find

someone else to clean the account. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 82-83).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” The cited testimony establishes only that, in very rare circumstances, a
Jani-King franchise owner’s customer may call Jani-King of Boston to state that the
customer’s space has not been cleaned by the franchise owner and that Mr.
Goffredo knew of no circumstances in which “anybody from Jani-King” has “gone
and performed cleaning services . . . where a franchisee is unavailable.”

13

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 14 of 26

39.

Jani-King International provides training to Jani-King Boston salespeople.

(Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 31).
Admitted.
40.

Jani-King International employs a “bidding expert” to provide assistance to

regional offices with client account bids that exceed $10,000 per month. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L,
¶¶ 29-30).
Admitted.
41.

Jani-King International also provides bidding support in competitive bidding

situations. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 98-99).
Denied. It is unclear what “competitive bidding situations” means. The deposition
testimony cited establishes that, on occasion, Jani-King submits commercial
cleaning bids to prospective customers soliciting bids from multiple entities.
42.

Jani-King Boston provides operational support to cleaners through an “operations

manager” and “assistant operations managers.” Among other duties, operations managers
provide cleaners with “start-up help” and work with clients and cleaners on an ongoing basis to
provide quality control and “to assure that the client is receiving the promised benefits of the
Jani-King franchising system.” (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 24; Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 2425, 80).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King otherwise admits that Jani-King Boston provides operational
support to franchise owners through an “operations manager” and “assistant
operations managers” and that, among other duties, operations managers provide

14

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 15 of 26

franchise owners with “start-up help” and work with clients and franchise owners
on an ongoing basis to provide quality control and “to assure that the client is
receiving the promised benefits of the Jani-King franchising system.”
43.

Operations managers are involved in the process of obtaining new accounts, to

ensure the account can be serviced properly: “Before a salesman makes a final decision in
signing up a contract, operations needs to have input to make sure the labor is there, the franchise
owner will be able to provide good quality service to its customers.” (Mota Depo., Exh. N, at17).
Admitted to the extent that the deposition testimony cited establishes that
“obtaining new accounts” refers to the process of deciding whether a franchise
owner is available to accept and service the account according to the client’s needs.
44.

Operations managers may provide ongoing advice to cleaners about cleaning

tasks. (Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 14, 32-33). Indeed, “[f]ranchise owners are constantly calling
asking for advice.” (Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 18).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that the deposition testimony cited establishes that
operations managers may provide ongoing advice to franchise owners about
cleaning tasks and that franchise owners call the Jani-King of Boston office for
advice and to receive offers of additional business.
45.

Operations managers also work with clients and cleaners to resolve client

complaints. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 62).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to

15

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 16 of 26

“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that the deposition testimony cited establishes that
operations managers call franchise owners when a customer lodges a complaint with
the Jani-King of Boston office and that the operations manager “set[s] up a meeting
with the franchise owner, our operations manager, and the client,” a process that is
documented in Jani-King’s records.
46.

Operations managers oversee the transition of cleaning accounts when an account

is transferred by Jani-King from one cleaner to another. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 26).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Admitted that operations managers are involved in offering an account
to a different franchise owner when the current franchise owner ceases cleaning that
account for one reason or another.
47.

Operations managers spend most of their time “in the field,” inspecting accounts

or meeting with cleaners and clients. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 25-26; Mota Depo., Exh. N, at
16).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Mr. Goffredo’s cited testimony establishes that operations managers
spend two to three hours a day in the office and that operations managers spend
their time in the field inspecting accounts, dealing with issues related to customer
accounts, and meeting with customers and franchise owners. Mr. Mota’s cited
testimony establishes that he spends forty percent of his time in the office.

16

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 17 of 26

48.

On occasion, operations managers have arranged for a “subcontractor” to provide

cleaning services to an account. This has happened where, for example, no franchise owner was
willing to accommodate the client’s schedule, the client mandated that its account not be
transferred to a franchise owner after a subcontractor the client was satisfied with had started
providing services, the account required specialized cleaning skills for a large-scale one-time
clean, the account was located in an area where no franchise owner was willing to travel, or the
account required more cleaning staff than any available franchise owner could provide. (2d
Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 27).
Admitted.
49.

Operations managers use a manual developed by Jani-King International and

attend conferences for training and development run by Jani-King International, including
training on cleaning techniques. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 28; Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at
27; Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 12-15). They may also consult with advisors at Jani-King
International. (Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 13-14).
Admitted.
50.

Prior to coming to work for Jani-King Boston, its operations manager, Joe Mota,

had worked for over 18 years as a cleaning supervisor, and he had “a lot of knowledge” about the
cleaning industry. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 28-29; Mota Depo., Exh. N, at 7).
Admitted.
51.

Mota hired an assistant with experience as a cleaning supervisor at a hospital; that

background was important to Mota, “[b]ecause Jani-King does a lot of health care facilities, and
he had the experience in order to properly train and advise the cleaner owners.” (Mota Depo.,
Exh. N, at 11-23).

17

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 18 of 26

Denied. The quotation from the cited deposition testimony is incorrect. Mr. Mota
did not use the phrase “cleaner owners.” He used the phrase “franchisee owners.”
The cited deposition testimony includes twelve pages of questions and answers, but
appears to only reference testimony on pages 11-13. Jani-King admits that the cited
testimony establishes that Mr. Mota hired an individual with eight years of
experience as an environmental supervisor at Mount Auburn Hospital and six years
of experience as a housekeeping supervisor. The testimony also establishes that Mr.
Mota found this individual’s experience “important” when making the decision to
hire him because “he had the experience in order to properly train and advise the
franchise owners.”
52.

Clients may contact an operations manager or one of Jani-King’s customer

service representatives to discuss any issues that arise. (2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 25).
Admitted.
53.

Jani-King’s customer service representatives work out of Jani-King

International’s offices in Texas. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 14-15, 87-88; Dockerty Depo.,
Exh. P, at 18). Those representatives contact clients for quality control assurance. (Burleson
Depo., Exh. Q, at 30-31).
Admitted to the extent this relates to Jani-King’s current practices.
54.

Jani-King Boston’s administrative personnel maintain customer account

information and are responsible for accounting functions, including billing and collecting money
from clients. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 31; 2d Dockery Decl., Exh. O, ¶ 30; Goffredo Depo.,
Exh. M, at 31-32). The billing process involves both Jani-King Boston and Jani-King

18

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 19 of 26

International. (Burleson Depo., Exh. Q, at 27-29). Clients send payments directly to Jani-King
Boston. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 49).
Admitted.
55.

Jani-King International generates monthly “cleaner reports” for all of the cleaners

in regional offices. (Burleson Decl., Exh. L, ¶ 31).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” The testimony cited expressly states that JKI “generates monthly
‘franchisee reports’ for franchise owners in corporate regional offices” (emphasis
added).
56.

Overall, Jani-King Boston has 10 employees: three operations personnel (who, as

discussed above, spend most of their time in the field inspecting cleaning accounts or meeting
with cleaners and cleaning clients), three sales staff (who, as discussed above, seek to develop
new cleaning accounts), three administrative staff (who, as discussed above, field calls from
cleaning clients and handle client accounting and billing), and the regional director. (Goffredo
Depo., Exh. M, at 14, 16-17).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Admitted to the extent that the deposition testimony cited refers to the
personnel in place at the time of Mr. Goffredo’s deposition.
57.

Nobody in the Jani-King Boston office is responsible for recruiting cleaners.

(Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 45).

19

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 20 of 26

Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” The cited testimony establishes that franchise owners are not
“recruited” by Jani-King of Boston employees, and that new franchise owners are
“obtained” through Jani-King’s website or through referrals.
58.

Jani-King Boston employees are entitled to incentive compensation that is tied to

factors such as the number of cleaning contracts that cancel or the number of new cleaning
contracts that are obtained. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 33-37).
Denied. The deposition testimony cited establishes that certain Jani-King of Boston
employees are entitled to receive a commission if they keep the rate of cancellation
for customer accounts below one percent, and that the commission is reduced if the
cancellation rate is higher. The cited deposition testimony further establishes that
certain Jani-King of Boston employees are entitled to receive commissions for
selling extra work and new accounts that will be offered to franchise owners.
59.

Jani-King International has developed a system-wide database that is used to

manage information about client accounts, including sales, inspections, complaints, accounting,
billing, etc. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 40-42, 62; Dockery Depo., Exh. P, at 38; Mota Depo.,
Exh. N, at 26-27). Jani-King Boston relies on Jani-King International for advice and assistance
with this database. (Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 40-41, 46-47).
Admitted.
60.

Jani-King Boston obtains revenue through contract billing (amounts paid by

clients for regular cleaning performed by cleaners), extra work (amounts paid by clients for extra
cleaning work), and leasing of cleaning equipment. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 48-50, 59). It

20

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 21 of 26

also obtains revenue by paying for cleaning supplies for cleaners, and then passing those costs on
to the cleaner along with a 10 percent fee. (Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 53-55).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King of Boston does not obtain revenue through contract billings;
it obtains revenues from fees paid by its franchise owners which are a contractually
agreed-to percentage of the gross revenues realized by the franchise owners from
servicing commercial cleaning accounts. The deposition testimony cited establishes
that Jani-King of Boston receives the revenue due to franchise owners from the
customer accounts that the franchise owners are servicing, and passes that revenue
through to franchise owners after deducting the fees franchise owners owe to JaniKing. The deposition testimony further establishes that Jani-King of Boston
receives a certain percentage of revenue of equipment leases franchise owners enter
into. Jani-King admits that it receives a ten percent payment for handling supply
invoices for franchise owners who choose to buy from a supplier who bills directly to
Jani-King. (See Churchill Decl. Ex. P at 54-55.)
61.

New cleaners typically obtain required cleaning equipment by leasing it from

Jani-King. (Dockerty Depo., Exh. P, at 67-68).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King otherwise admits that new franchise owners typically chose
to obtain required cleaning equipment by leasing it from a Jani-King company.

21

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 22 of 26

62.

The PowerPoint presentation given by Jani-King to potential cleaners states,

“Franchising is where the parent company, the franchisor, allows other people, the franchise
owners, to run clones of its business in return for initial and ongoing fees.” (Goffredo Depo.,
Exh. M, at 69).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King otherwise admits that the PowerPoint presentation
referenced contains this statement. The slide referenced in the deposition testimony
cited states further that “[t]he franchisor provides training, advice, and continuing
support” and “[a] well run franchise combines all the advantages of big business—
established trade name, reputation, reliability, resources and experience—with the
drive and enthusiasm of the individual entrepreneur.” (Hunter Decl. Ex. O.)
63.

If a cleaner sought to sign up a cleaning account without paying fees to Jani-King,

that would be a violation of the franchise agreement. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 76-77). More
generally, a cleaner cannot form another cleaning business at the same time he’s performing
cleaning services for Jani-King. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 104).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that franchise owners must pay certain fees to JaniKing on all commercial cleaning business they service, “regardless of the entity or
business name used.” (See Churchill Decl. Ex. S at §§ 4.5.1, 4.5.2.)

22

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 23 of 26

64.

When Jani-King Boston learned that a cleaner was doing other cleaning work, the

matter was referred to Jani-King International, and the cleaner did not continue perform services
for Jani-King. (Goffredo Depo., Exh. M, at 109-110).
Denied. Jani-King does not use the term “cleaners” to describe its prospective
franchise owners or franchise owners and the testimony cited does not refer to
“cleaners.” Jani-King admits that the deposition testimony cited establishes that
Jani-King of Boston referred a matter involving a franchise owner forming a
competing commercial cleaning company to JKI and that that particular franchise
owner stopped operating his Jani-King franchise.
Other Facts
65.

While a handful of Jani-King franchisees might hire a few people to help them

clean, that just makes a bad situation even worse, because the cleaning helpers may also be
treated like contractors, without any benefits of employment. (Bastos Depo. , Exh. V, at 21).
Denied. The deposition testimony cited establishes that Jani-King of Boston
franchise owner Joao Bastos pays his franchise’s employees cash and that “at the
end of the year,” he sends his employees a Form 1099.
66.

Michael Seid is not an expert in issues of misclassification. (Seid Depo., Exh. W,

at 9, 79-82). As he testified, “I’m totally able to answer your questions on what I believe is an
employer-employee on a business point of view, but not a legal point of view.” (Id. at 82).
Indeed, he did not even know what the third prong of section 148B was. (Id. at 82-84).
Denied. In the deposition testimony cited, Mr. Seid stated that he “certainly would”
consider himself an expert on “the distinction between a franchisee and an
employee.” (Churchill Decl. Ex. W at 80.) When asked if he “held himself out as an

23

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 24 of 26

expert in the application of [the Massachusetts employee classification test],” Mr.
Seid replied, “ . . .I do, but not as a lawyer, not as a legal expert. So if you asked the
question leaving out the word ‘lawyer,’ I would say, yes, I’m toally able to answer
your questions on what I believe is an employer-employee on a business pint of view,
but not a legal point of view.” Mr. Seid has never identified himself as a legal
expert. (See generally First Seid Decl. [Dkt. 112]; Second Sied Decl. [Dkt. 166]; and
Third Seid Decl. (filed herewith).)
67.

He could not identify any other franchisor, outside of the cleaning industry, where

all of the contracts were between the franchisor and the customer. (Seid Depo., Exh. W, at 3134).
Denied. The deposition testimony cited establishes that Mr. Seid could not call to
mind any examples in response to the question of whether he knew of franchising
models where “every contract with the customer is between the franchisor and the
customer.” (Churchill Decl. Ex. W at 31.) Throughout his deposition, he provided
examples of where a franchisor holds the contract with certain customers. For
instance, Mr. Seid provided an example of a home healthcare franchising system
where “in order to get those licenses all of the customers have to be customers of the
franchisor, and all the payroll in that situation has to be from the franchisor. . . .”
(Churchill Decl. Ex. W at 31-32.)
68.

He’s only fairly familiar with the cleaning industry. (Seid Depo., Exh. W, at 64).

Denied. See response to para. 67, supra. In the deposition testimony cited, Mr. Seid
stated that that his practice is “looking at the business as using franchising as a
method of distribution” but that he does not look at “an industry” per se.

24

Case 1:07-cv-10066-MLW Document 191 Filed 08/12/11 Page 25 of 26

69.

In a “vertically intergrated” commercial cleaning company, the chief executive

officer would be in the same business as the cleaners. (Seid Depo., Exh. W, at 64-67).
Denied. In the deposition testimony cited, Mr. Seid stated that “in any company
where there’s a vertically-integrated company it’s generally employees or
independent contractors for the company doing the services.” Mr. Seid agreed that
in a hypothetical “with a thousand variations” a simple model of a company
employing people to do cleaning would “be a company” and that it was theoretically
possible that all the employees of the company would be involved in delivering the
product or service to the customer.
70.

Franchising is “a method of distributing the product or service to the end user,”

where the franchisor’s revenue is limited to fees but where the franchisor does not have the
“burdens of an employer.” (Seid Depo., Exh. W, at 68-69).
Jani-King admits that the testimony cited reflects statements made in Mr. Seid’s
declaration.
71.

He’s unaware of any relevant distinctions between Jani-King and Coverall that

would require a different result from the holding of Awuah v. Coverall North America, Inc., 707
F. Supp. 2d 80 (D. Mass. 2010). (Seid Depo., Exh. W, at 82-85).
Jani-King admits that Mr. Seid had not studied the decision referenced at the time
of his deposition.
