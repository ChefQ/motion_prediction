Case 10-21656 Doc188 Page2of3

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. This case was filed on January 25, 2010 as a voluntary Chapter 11 case. Since the
inception of this case, Debtor has always been debtor-in-possession pursuant to Sections 1107 and
1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.

2. As Debtor-in-Possession, Debtor has complied with all requirements of a Chapter 11 case
thus far. Debtor has submitted all monthly operating reports; provided all relevant financial
information; paid all quarterly trustee fees; paid all required post-petition taxes and insurance
premiums.

3. Debtor filed a plan and disclosure statement on October 25, 2010 (Docket #121, 122) and
a first amended plan and disclosure on December 9, 2011 (Docket #138 and 139).

4. Approval of Debtor's disclosure and plan is pending before this court. A status
conference regarding this case is currently set for July 13, 2011.

5. Delay of approval of Debtor's disclosure statement has been due in large part to the
pending objection to claim of Citibank before this Court. After initially sustaining Debtor's
objection, this Court has set an evidentiary hearing to determine the merits of Citibank's claim. The
Court has set November 9, 2011 as date for the evidentiary hearing.

Il. ARGUMENT

6. The Debtor has not suffered continuing loss to his estate while under chapter 11

bankruptcy. Debtor continues to possess both of his real properties and commenced operations of

his janitorial business.

7. Debtor receives rents through Section 8 for his rental property located in Tracy.

8. Debtor is currently averaging income of $4,500.00 per month plus rents.

Case 10-21656 Doc188 Page3of3

9. Debtor's plan proposes a payment of $4196.41 per month. Based on current income and

rents received, Debtor will be able to afford a confirmable plan.

10. Approval of Debtor's disclosure and subsequent confirmation of the plan is pending
determination of a proof of claim filed by creditor, Citibank. Debtor has objected to Citibank's
claim as a secured creditor. The Court has set an evidentiary hearing to decide the merits of this
claim. Debtor cannot accurately confirm a plan where the true identities of all creditors are currently
unknown. Therefore, any conversion or dismissal of Debtor's chapter 11 case should be stayed

pending the Court's decision as to Citibank's claim.

I. CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, Debtor requests that this Court enter an order: (1)

denying the UST's motion as to conversion or dismissal; and/or (2) grant Debtor leave to resolve the

merits of the proof claim of Citibank prior to approval of disclosure and confirmation of a plan.
