Debtor filed a chapter 11 petition on January 25, 2010. (Docket #1).

An amended voluntary petition was filed on February 22, 2010. (Docket #21).
A second amended voluntary petition was filed on March 17, 2010. (Docket
#44).

The monthly operating report ("MOR'') for the period of January 25-February
2010 was filed on March 19, 2010. (Docket #47).

operating reports. In some cases, there are no bank statements attached to the operating report.

a. The MOR for February 2010 lists income of $4,500 and total expenses of
$3,604.00 for a cash profit of $896.00. The bank statements attached to

the MOR show deposits of only $1,525.00 and no expenses. (Docket
#47).

There are no bank statements attached to the March 2010 operating report.
(Docket #60). A signed receipt is attached to the March 2010 operating

fees in the case of People v. Rickie Travon Walker (Debtor's Son).
(Docket #60).

The MOR for April 2010 lists income of $2,908 and expenses of
$2,012.00 for a cash profit of $896.00. (Docket #65). The bank
statements appended to the April MOR show deposits of $100.00 and no
expenses. (Docket #65).

The MOR for May 2010 indicates Debtor had a total income of $6,216.00
and total expenses of $4,285.00 for a cash profit of $1,931. (Docket #73).

$4,542.00 and total expenses of $3,513.00 for a cash profit of $1,029.00.

The bank statements also show several cash withdrawals at Thunder
Valley Casino and Red Hawk Casino. (Docket #84).

g. The MOR for August 2010 indicates that Debtor had $4,800 in income
and $4,335.00 in expenses for a negative cash profit of $-534.00. (Docket
#87). The bank statements attached to the MOR show deposits of $7,900
and disbursements of $9,788. The bank statements also show several cash
withdrawals at Thunder Valley and $487.05 in overdraft fees. (Docket
#87).

h. The MOR for September 2010 indicates Debtor had total income of
$2,195.00 and total expenses of $1,208.00 for a cash profit of $807.00.
(Docket #106). The bank statements attached to Debtor's MOR show
deposits of $2,792.17 and disbursements of $5,484.09. (Docket #106).
The bank statement also shows a cash withdrawal at Thunder Valley and
$240.00 in overdraft fees.

1. There are no bank statements attached to either the October or November
2010 MORS. (Dockets ##136, 141).

j. The MORs for December 2010, January 2011 and February 2011 are
generally consistent with the deposits and withdrawals on the attached
bank accounts. However, the bank statements for December 2010,
January 2011, and February 2011 demonstrate numerous cash
withdrawals. (Dockets ##143,172,173).

h. The MOR for March 2011 indicates that Debtor had $3,400 in total
income and $3,400 in total expenses. (Docket #180). The bank
statements attached to the MOR show no activity except for continuing
overdraft fees. (Docket #180).

18. All of the MORs filed in this case indicate that the tenant in 1518 Michael Drive

is not paying the agreed upon rent of $1,196.00. Many of the operating reports indicate that the

 
Case 10-21656 Doc184 Page5of6

tenant has not paid the full amount. Debtor does not appear to have taken any action to evict the
tenant.

19. Based upon the reported numbers in Debtor's monthly operating reports, Debtor's
average monthly profit is $258.00. This number appears to be insufficient to fund a plan of
reorganization. Assuming that Debtor was able to confirm his most recently proposed plan and
disclosure statement, that plan calls for monthly payments totaling $4,196.41. (Docket #139).

Debtor's average monthly income appears to be far short of the required amount to fund the plan.
