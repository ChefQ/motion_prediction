MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION OF
THE UNITED STATES TRUSTEE
FOR CONVERSION OR DISMISSAL OF CHAPTER 11 CASE

TO THE HONORABLE RONALD H. SARGIS, U.S. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE
I. MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

A. The United States Trustee has standing to bring this motion.

The United States Trustee is charged with supervising the administration of cases under
chapter 7, 11, 12, 13, or 15 of title 11. 28 U.S.C. $586. In furtherance of that duty, the U.S.
Trustee is granted standing to raise and be heard on any issue in any bankruptcy case or
proceeding pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 307.

B. Cause exists to convert or dismiss this case.

11 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1112(b) provides, in pertinent part, that on the request of a party in interest,
and after notice and a hearing, absent unusual circumstances specifically identified by the court

that establish that the requested conversion or dismissal is not in the best interests of creditors

Case 10-21656 Doc186 Page2of6

and the estate, the court shall convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 or
dismiss a case under this chapter, whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate, if
the movant establishes cause.

"Cause" is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code. However, Bankruptcy Code Section
1112(b)(4) sets forth a list of 16 grounds that do constitute "cause." See 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1114(b)(4)(A)-(P); see also In re Gateway Access Solutions, Inc., 374 B.R. 556, 560 (Bankr.
M.D. Pa. 2007). This list is not exhaustive, and a case may be dismissed or converted for causes
other than those specifically identified in Section 1112(b)(4). See, e.g., In re AmeriCERT, Inc.,
360 B.R. 398, 401 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2007) ("The list is not exhaustive ... a case may be dismissed
for other causes, such as bad faith or if the petition does not serve a bankruptcy purpose.''); /n re
Jayo, 2006 WL 2433451, at *6 (Bankr. D. Idaho July 28, 2006) ("In [the Ninth] Circuit, the
court has discretion to consider alleged causes not specifically listed in 0x00A7 1112(b).").

Cause exists to convert or dismiss this case.

1. Debtor has failed to comply with reporting requirements.

Unexcused failure to satisfy timely any filing or reporting requirement established by the
Code or any rule is enumerated as cause to convert or dismiss a case at 11 U.S.C. 0x00A7
1112(b)(4)(F). Periodic reports and summaries of the operation of a business are required by 11
U.S.C. 0x00A7 704(a)(8), as incorporated by 11 U.S.C. 0x00A71106(a)(1). Local Rule 2015-1 requires
Debtors to file and serve MORs on the 15" day following any month end. The monthly
operating reports are the "life blood" of chapter 11. Jn re Berryhill, 127 B.R. 427, 433 (Bankr.
N.D. Ind. 1991). The reports are necessary to provide financial information about the debtor and
"a report filed late may be the practical equivalent of a failure to file any financial information at
all." In re Ronald Kerns & Sons, 48 Collier Bankr. Cas.2d 810 (W.D.N.Y. 2002). As detailed in

the statement of facts, Debtor has not timely filed all of his operating reports.

2. Debtor has failed to timely provide information reasonably requested by the

 

United States Trustee.

The United States Trustee is charged with supervising the administration of Chapter 11
cases, which includes supervising the debtor's performance of its statutory and fiduciary
responsibilities. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7586(a)(3). To perform this role, the United States Trustee has
adopted reporting requirements embodied in the United States Trustee's guidelines that Debtors
in possession must fulfill. Debtors are to complete the monthly operating reports in the form
provided by the United States Trustee, and discussed with the Debtors at the Initial Debtor
Interview. Pursuant to Local Rule 2015, Debtors are then to timely file the operating reports.
The failure timely to provide information reasonably requested by the United States Trustee is
enumerated as cause to convert or dismiss at 11 U.S.C. 0x00A71112(b)(4)(H). Even if the Debtor avers
some reason for the delay in filing the MORS, filing a piece of paper is meaningless if the
content is inaccurate, misleading, or wrong, thus the content of these documents is always
relevant. In re Tucker, 411 B.R. 530, 532 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 2009) (citing In re Kholyavka, 2008
WL 3887653 at *4 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2008)). Here, the monthly operating reports are misleading
and incorrect. With the exception of the monthly operating reports for December 2010, January
2011 and February 2011, the deposits and withdrawals in the bank statements attached to the
monthly operating reports do not correspond to income and expense numbers listed in the
operating reports. In some cases, Debtor has not attached bank statements to his operating
reports. The inconsistencies in the MORs constitutes a failure to timely provide information
within the meaning of 0x00A71112(b)(4)(H). Jd. at 535 (where court noted that delays and
inconsistencies and omissions in the monthly operating reports constitute failure to timely
provide information within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. 0x00A71112(b)(4)(A)).

3. Debtor has grossly mismanaged his estate.

11 U.S.C. 0x00A71112(b)(4)(B) includes as "cause" for conversion or dismissal of a under

0x00A71112(b)(1) a debtor's "gross mismanagement" of its estate.

Case 10-21656 Doc186 Page4of6

A debtor-in-possession enjoys a plethora of rights and powers that it would not possess in
a case under Chapter 7, including the right to remain in control of its assets. These rights and
powers "come with certain responsibilities." See In re Gateway Access Solutions, Inc., 374 B.R.,
at 565. Most notably, a debtor-in-possession owes a fiduciary duty to its creditors and must act
in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. See Biltmore Assoc., LLC v. Twin
City Fire Ins. Co. 572 F.3d 663,673 Che Cir. 2009) ("Visitalk became the debtor in possession of
the bankruptcy estate, empowered to act as a trustee and required to act as a fiduciary for its
creditors."')

Here, Debtor has mismanaged his estate in two ways. First, has made improper use of
estate funds, and second, Debtor has provided inaccurate and incomplete operating reports.

Debtor's monthly operating reports demonstrate that Debtor has made cash withdrawals
in casinos. This pattern of gambling is offensive to the integrity of the bankruptcy system. Jn re
Weber, 209 B.R. 793, 800 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997). Debtor's decision to gamble shows a
disregard for the fiduciary duty he owes to his creditors. In re Draiman, 2001 WL 1486128, *21
(Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2011) ("It is far too risky to gamble at casinos where all games are structured to
favor the house and not the gambler. The Debtor has chosen selfish pursuits over his fiduciary
duty to the estate and his creditors."')

Second, as demonstrated in the statement of facts, the numbers listed on many of
Debtor's monthly operating reports do not correspond to the bank statements attached to support
the reports. Debtor has not provided an explanation as to how the numbers on Debtor's monthly
operating reports were derived. The failure of a debtor to properly report income and expenses
constitutes evidence of gross mismanagement under 0x00A7 1112(b)(4)(B). Jn re Halal 4 U LLC, 2010
WL 2810860, *4 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010)

4, There is a continuing loss with no likelihood of rehabilitation.

A substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a
reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation is enumerated as cause to convert or dismiss a case at 11

U.S.C. 0x00A7 1112(b)(4)(A). The two elements under Section 1112(b)(4)(A) must be shown by the

Case 10-21656 Doc186 Page5of6

moving party to establish "cause:" (1) a substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the
estate, and (2) the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation. See, e.g., In Products
Int'l Co., 395 B.R. 101, 110 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 2008). Both elements are satisfied here.

Debtor's disclosure statement indicates that Debtor is to make monthly mortgage
payments on Debtor's property in Rocklin, California totaling $2,277.78 per month. (Docket
#138). Debtor's disclosure statement further provides that Debtor will make monthly mortgage
payments in the amount of $1,480.55 on Debtor's property in Tracy, California. (Docket #138).
The UST has analyzed the Debtor's MORs and the attached bank records indicate that the
mortgage payments are not being made. Further, Debtor's monthly operating reports indicate
that Debtor has an average monthly income of $258.00. This number is far below the amount
that would be required to make the mortgage payment on even one of Debtor's properties. This
absence of a reliable source of income together with the inability to pay current expenses is
sufficient to show continuing loss. Jn re Park, 436 B.R. 811, 816 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2010) (citing
Quail Farm, 2010 WL 1849867, *3 (Bankr. N.D. W. Va. 2010).

It appears that rehabilitation is unlikely in this case. See Jn re Rey, 2006 WL 2457435, *6
(Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2006) (defining the issue of rehabilitation as "not the technical one of whether
the debtor can confirm a plan, but rather, whether the debtor's business prospects justify
continuance of the reorganization effort."). Debtor's income and expenses derived from
Debtor's bank statements do not correspond to the income and expenses listed on Debtor's
MORs. Even assuming that the numbers listed on Debtor's operating reports are correct,
Debtor's average monthly profit is not even sufficient to pay one of Debtor's two mortgages.
Further, the case has been pending since January of 2010 and the Debtor has been unable to
confirm a plan of reorganization which evidences an inability to reorganize. Therefore, "cause"
exists to dismiss or convert this case pursuant to section 1112(b)(4)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.
See, e.g., Inre Can-Alta Properties, Ltd., 87 B.R. 89, 91 (9" Cir. B.A.P. 1988) (describing

various factors establishing "cause" to lift automatic stay or dismiss chapter 11 case, including

circumstance in which debtor has little or no cash flow, and no available income to sustain a plan
of reorganization).

Cc. Debtor's case should be converted.

As described above, cause exists to convert or dismiss this case. However, Section
"1112(b) establish[es] a two-step analysis for dealing with questions of conversion and
dismissal. First, it must be determined that there is `cause' to [convert or dismiss]. Second, once
a determination of `cause' has been made, a choice must be made between conversion and
dismissal based on the `best interests of the creditors and the estate.'" In re Nelson, 343 B.R.
671, 675 (9" Cir. BAP 2006). In this case, a chapter 7 trustee should be appointed to investigate
Debtor's financial transactions to determine if there is anything that can be administered for the
benefit of Debtor's unsecured creditors.

Il. CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, the court is requested to enter an order converting or dismissing this

case; conversion is recommended.
