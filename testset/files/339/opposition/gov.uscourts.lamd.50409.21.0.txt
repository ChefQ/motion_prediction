CRIMINAL NO. 16-130-JJB-EWD

UNITED STATES’ OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS
The United States opposes Jordan Hamlett’s (the “Defendant”) motion to suppress. The
Defendant contends, first, that agents violated his Miranda rights, and, second, that his
statements were involuntary. Both arguments should be rejected, and the motion denied in its
entirety.
I.

BACKGROUND
On September 13, 2016, the Defendant unlawfully attempted to obtain the federal tax

information of then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump from the U.S. Department of
Education and Internal Revenue Service using the Federal Student Aid – Datashare application. 1
The attempt was unsuccessful. About a month later, on October 27, 2016, the defendant agreed
to be interviewed by federal law enforcement agents. The interview took place in the lobby area
of the Embassy Suites in Baton Rouge.
II.

LAW AND ARGUMENT
The Defendant’s motion should be denied in its entirety for two reasons: first, agents

were not required to Mirandize the Defendant, and, second, his statements were voluntary.

A.

Agents were not required to Mirandize the Defendant because he was not in
custody

Miranda custody

Miranda warnings need be given prior to interrogation only when a suspect is in custody.
See Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 322 (1994) (“An officer’s obligation to administer
Miranda warnings attaches, however, only where there has been such a restriction on a person’s
freedom as to render him in custody,” internal quotations omitted); Minnesota v. Murphy, 465
U.S. 420, 429-31 (1984). On the other hand, when is a suspect is not in custody, Miranda does
not apply and no warnings need be given. J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 268-71
(2011).
A suspect is in custody for purposes of Miranda only when he is formally arrested or
when the restraint on his freedom of movement is of the degree associated with formal arrest. Id.
at 270. In determining whether a suspect is in custody, “the only relevant inquiry is how a
reasonable man in the suspect’s position would have understood his situation.” Berkemer v.
McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984); J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. at 270-71 (whether a
suspect is “in custody” for purposes of Miranda is an objective inquiry which takes into account
all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation). As the Fifth Circuit has explained, “[t]he
reasonable person through whom [the court] view[s] the situation must be neutral to the
environment and to the purposes of the investigation—that is, neither guilty of criminal conduct
and thus overly apprehensive nor insensitive to the seriousness of the circumstances.” United
States v. Bengivenga, 845 F.2d 593, 596 (5th Cir. 1988) (en banc).
This circuit identified factors relevant to the Miranda custody inquiry in United States v.
Wright, 777 F.3d 769 (5th Cir. 2015). The Wright factors include (1) the length of the

2

questioning, (2) the location of the questioning, (3) the accusatory, or non-accusatory, nature of
the questioning, (4) the amount of restraint on the individual’s physical movement, (5) and
statements made by officers regarding the individual’s freedom to move or leave. Id. at 775. No
one fact is determinative. Id.
2.

The burden of proving Miranda custody rests with the defendant

“It is well established that the burdens of production and persuasion generally rest upon
the movant in a suppression hearing.” United States v. De La Fuente, 548 F.2d 528, 533 (5th
Cir. 1977). In the Miranda context, it is the defendant who bears the burden of proving that he
was in custody. United States v. Charles, 738 F.2d 686, 692-93 (5th Cir. 1984) (concluding that
the defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that they were in custody at the time their
statements were taken), overruled on other grounds as stated in United States v. Bengivenga,
845 F.2d 593.
B.

The Defendant’s statements were voluntary

A confession is admissible only if it was voluntary. See Dickerson v. United States, 530
U.S. 428, 434 (2000). A confession is voluntary if it was made “in the absence of official
overreaching, in the form either of direct coercion or subtle forms of psychological persuasion.”
United States v. Rojas-Martinez, 968 F.2d 415, 418 (5th Cir. 1992). In determining whether a
suspect’s statements were voluntary, a court must ask whether, under the totality of the
circumstances, law enforcement officials obtained the evidence by overbearing the will of the
accused. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. at 433-34.
In order for a confession to be involuntary, there must have been “coercive police
activity.” Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167 (1986). Coercive police activity, in turn,
requires more than deceptive tactics. See, e.g., United States v. Crawford, 372 F.3d 1048, 1060-

3

61 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding the defendant’s confession voluntary even though police used a
deceptive tactic to induce the defendant to come to the FBI office and speak about an old bank
robbery); see also United States v. Rojas-Martinez, 968 F.2d at 418 (“Expressions of sympathy
by an officer are not coercive.”). Rather, the focus is on whether law enforcement’s techniques
were “so offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned.” 2 Miller v.
Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 109 (1985).
The Government bears the burden of proving the voluntariness of a confession by a
preponderance of the evidence. Lego v. Twoney, 404 U.S. 477, 489 (1972).
III.

CONCLUSION
The Defendant’s motion should be denied: first, the agents were not required to

Mirandize the Defendant because, as the evidence will show, he was not in custody, and, second,
his statements were voluntary.

The suspect’s custodial status also has a bearing on the voluntariness of his confession. See United States v. Fazio,
914 F.2d 950, 956 (7th Cir. 1990) (“In contrast to the presumption of coercion that attends statements given during
custodial interrogation in the absence of Miranda warnings, statements made during a noncustodial interrogation are
not viewed with suspicion.”) (internal quotations omitted); Beckwith v. United States, 425 U.S. 341, 347–48 (1976)
(stating that a “noncustodial interrogation might possibly in some situations, by virtue of some special
circumstances,” produce an involuntary confession).
