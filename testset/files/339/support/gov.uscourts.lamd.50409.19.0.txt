JORDAN HAMLETT

NO: 16-CR-130-JJB-EWD

MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
(with Incorporated Memorandum)

Defendant, Jordan Hamlett, by and through his undersigned counsel, files this Motion to
Suppress, and would show this Honorable Court as follows.
1.
Defendant stands charged by a one count indictment charging a violation of 42 U.S.C. §
408(a)(7)(B), false representation of a social security number. The charge arises from
Defendant’s alleged attempts to obtain a copy of tax returns belonging to President Donald J.
Trump (who at the time was “President Elect”).
2.
On or about October 27, 2016, Defendant was subjected to an interrogation at an
Embassy Suites hotel in Baton Rouge by Special Agents of the U.S. Treasury Inspector General
for Tax Administration (TIGTA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The
interrogation by agents of TIGTA and the FBI, conducted in the absence of counsel, resulted in
certain statements that will be used against Defendant at trial. Defendant anticipates that the
evidence will show that Defendant's statements were made while he was not free to leave, and

that they were involuntary. The requirements that statements be voluntary is drawn both from the
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Due Process Clause. A statement is
involuntary if it is "extracted by any sort of threats or violence [or] obtained by any direct or
implied promises, however slight, or by the exertion of any improper influence." Hutto v. Ross,
429 U.S. 28, 30, 97 S.Ct. 202, 203, 50 L.Ed.2d 194 (1976). The test is whether, considering the
totality of the circumstances, the Government obtained the statement by physical or
psychological coercion or improper inducement so that the suspect's will was overborne. Haynes
v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 513–514, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1342–1343, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); see
also Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2047, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973);
18 U.S.C. § 3501. The Government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the
accused made statements voluntarily. Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 484, 92 S.Ct. 619, 624, 30
L.Ed.2d 618 (1972).
3.
It is believed that Defendant did not validly execute a waiver of his rights, nor otherwise
waived his rights, prior to interrogation. Defendant anticipates the Government will be unable to
show compliance with the warning and waiver requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.
436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), as further explicated in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S.
477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), and Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 97–98, 105 S.Ct.
490, 493–494, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984). Any waiver executed by the Defendant was involuntary
and without the benefit of counsel.
4.
Any evidence obtained as a result of illegally obtained statements, including subsequent
Page 2 of 5

Case 3:16-cr-00130-JJB-EWD Document 19

02/09/17 Page 3 of 5

statements, should be suppressed as a fruit of the initial illegality. Wong Sun v. United States, 371
U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).
5.
This motion is based on all the papers and records on file in this matter, the incorporated
memorandum of law submitted with this motion, and on whatever additional evidence,
testimony, and argument is presented at the hearing of this motion. Defendant requests a pre-trial
hearing on this motion, as any ruling on the motion will require factual findings as to the
circumstances of the interrogation of Defendant.
WHEREFORE, defendant, by his counsel, hereby moves for a contradictory pre-trial
evidentiary hearing with the government regarding this motion.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED:
