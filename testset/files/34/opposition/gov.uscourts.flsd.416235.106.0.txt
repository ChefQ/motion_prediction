CARLOS GERMAN DIAZ,

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR
RELIEF FROM, AND TO SET ASIDE, THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT
COMES NOW, Plaintiff, by and through undersigned counsel, and hereby files Plaintiff’s
Response in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Relief from, and to Set Aside, the Default
Judgment, and in support thereof states as follows:
1. Defendants seek to set aside this Court’s Final Default Judgment based upon alleged
misrepresentation of facts and “reasons that justify relief.” Defendants claim that the
entry of the Final Default Judgment against the corporate Defendants and in favor of
Plaintiff was procedurally erroneous.
2. As will be demonstrated in this Response, after failing to comply with the Court’s order
to substitute counsel or show cause as to why default should not be entered against them
by the Court’s deadline of January 19, 2015, Defendants were on notice that Plaintiff’s
counsel would be forced to move for a default judgment or to show cause as to why
Plaintiff’s complaint should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution [D.E. 100].

3. Furthermore, Defendants failed to file a motion for extension of time or otherwise notify
the court of Defendants’ efforts to substitute counsel or to show cause as to why default
should not be entered. In Defendants’ above-described Motion, Defendants do not
address this point. Therefore, the argued points in the Motion fail and should carry no
weight with this Court.
Memorandum of Law:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) states: “Setting Aside a Default or a Default
Judgment. The court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a
default judgment under Rule 60(b).”
Culpable or Willful Conduct; Meritorious Defense; Prejudice:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) states: “Setting Aside a Default or a Default Judgment.
The court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a default
judgment under Rule 60(b).” The Eleventh Circuit described the good cause standard as
follows:
" "Good cause' is a mutable standard, varying from situation to
situation. It is also a liberal one--but not so elastic as to be devoid
of substance." Coon v. Grenier, 867 F.2d 73, 76 (1st Cir.1989). We
recognize that "good cause" is not susceptible to a precise formula,
but some general guidelines are commonly applied. Id. Courts
have considered whether the default was culpable or willful,
whether setting it aside would prejudice the adversary, and whether
the defaulting party presents a meritorious defense. Rafidain Bank,
15 F.3d at 243; see also Robinson v. United States, 734 F.2d 735,
739 (11th Cir.1984). We note, however, that these factors are not
"talismanic," and that courts have examined other factors including
whether the public interest was implicated, whether there was
significant financial loss to the defaulting party, and whether the
defaulting party acted promptly to correct the default. E.g.,
Dierschke v. O'Cheskey, 975 F.2d 181, 184 (5th Cir.1992).
"Whatever factors are employed, the imperative is that they be
regarded simply as a means of identifying circumstances which
warrant the finding of "good cause' to set aside a default." Id.

However, if a party willfully defaults by displaying either an
intentional or reckless disregard for the judicial proceedings, the
court need make no other findings in denying relief. Shepard
Claims Service, Inc. v. William Darrah & Associates, 796 F.2d
190, 194-95 (6th Cir.1986).
Compania Interamericana Export-Import, S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviacion, 88 F.3d
948, 951-952 (11th Cir. 1996). See also Saperstein v. Palestinian Auth., 2008 WL 4467535
(S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2008) whereby the Court found that as a condition for lifting the default
Defendants had to pay Plaintiff's reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in responding to
the default related motions.
In the present case, the facts are tantamount to a party willfully defaulting and/or
displaying an intentional or reckless disregard for judicial proceedings and as such, Defendants’
Motion should be denied. Compania Interamericana Exp.-Imp., S.A. v. Compania Domenicana
De Aviacion, 88 F.3d 948, 951-952 (11th Cir. 1996) (if a party willfully defaults by displaying
either an intentional or reckless disregard for the judicial proceedings, the court need make no
other findings in denying relief.) In the present case, Defendants have been afforded
opportunities to comply with the Court’s order, or, in the alternative, show cause as to why
Defendant has not been able to comply with the Order, yet failed to address the Order until after
the deadline to respond had lapsed. Despite being afforded an opportunity to cure, Defendants
elected to willfully flaunt the rules and only elected to file their response once a clerk’s default
and final judgment had been entered.
As such, the Court need not analyze any of the remaining factors of good cause such as
whether Plaintiff would be prejudiced or whether Defendants have a meritorious Defense.
However, should the Court desire to analyze whether Plaintiff will be prejudiced, Plaintiff would
state that he is prejudiced by the fact that Plaintiff’s counsel has had to incur additional fees in

moving for a clerk’s default and in responding to Defendants’ Motion to vacate clerk’s default
judgment. The only way for Defendants to cure said prejudice is to pay Plaintiff his additional
attorney’s fees and costs as a precondition for the Court vacating the default as found by Judge
Seitz in Saperstein v. Palestinian Auth., 2008 WL 4467535 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2008).
However, Plaintiff contends that not only would Plaintiff suffer prejudice if the default is
vacated but the system as a whole would be prejudiced. If the Court grants Defendants’ Motion
to vacate, it would create a slippery slope of where Defendants in the future may choose to
answer a complaint at their own volition. The Court’s deadlines would be unenforceable, as any
Defendant would be allowed to answer a complaint at their whim, and then claim that they have
a meritorious Defense in order to vacate the default. As such, any Defendant will be allowed to
answer the complaint at their earliest convenience.
It is also clear that the Court has the inherent power to enter a judgment by default in
order to facilitate the exercise of the Court's inherent power to manage its affairs. Wahl v.
McIver, 773 F.2d 1169, 1174 (11th Cir.1985) (citing Flaksa v. Little River Marine Construction
Co., 389 F.2d 885, 887 (5th Cir.1968)). It is Plaintiff’s request that this Court not allow this
slippery slope to develop and therefore requests that this Court deny Defendants’ motion vacate
the clerks default or alternatively, if the Court is inclined to grant Defendants’ Motion to Vacate,
that the Court grant said motion conditionally and require to Defendants to pay Plaintiff’s
attorney fees in conjunction with the default proceedings pursuant to the Court’s findings in
Saperstein v. Palestinian Auth., 2008 WL 4467535 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2008).
Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny Defendants’ Motion in its
entirety, or alternatively award Plaintiff’s reasonable attorney’s fees in conjunction with the
default proceedings in the event the Court desires to vacate the clerks default.
