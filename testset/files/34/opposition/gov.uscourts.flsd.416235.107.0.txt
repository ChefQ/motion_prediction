DIEGO MOLINARI’S REPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
HIS MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM THE DEFAULT FINAL JUDGMENT
Defendant, Diego Molinari, replies to Plaintiff’s Response in Opposition to
Defendants’ Motion for Relief from, and to Set Aside, the Default Judgment
(“Response”), filed by the plaintiff, Carlos German Diaz (“Mr. Diaz”), and states:
Beginning with its title, which mischaracterizes Diego Molinari’s motion as
“Defendants’ Motion for Relief,” the Response is a semantic sleight of hand—one
obviously intended to obfuscate the narrow issue raised solely by Diego Molinari.
First, using the misnomer “Defendants’,” the Response mischaracterizes
Diego Molinari’s motion for relief as being the “Defendants’ Motion for Relief…,”
when, in fact, the motion is Diego Molinari’s motion for relief—and his alone—
based upon derivative liability, intertwined defenses, and inconsistent judgments.

Second, Diego Molinari has not moved this Court to set aside the defaults
entered against the company defendants. Instead, Diego Molinari has moved this
Court to set aside the default judgment—entered against two of four defendants—
and deny “Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Default Judgment, without prejudice, pending
adjudication of the individual Defendants’ claims and defenses at a trial by jury”
(DE 103, p. 13; emphasis in original). The crux of Diego Molinari’s argument is:
The company Defendants allegedly acted by and through the
individual Defendants. The defenses and affirmative defenses of the
company and individual Defendants are coterminous. A default
judgment against the company Defendants would be inconsistent if
the individual Defendants defeat Mr. Diaz’s claims against them at the
jury trial in this action. Accordingly, Mr. Diaz’s Plaintiff’s Motion
for Final Default Judgment should be denied, without prejudice.

Third, rather than address Diego Molinari’s argument, or mention much less
distinguish his on-point authorities, or acknowledge that he has not been defaulted
nor had any one of his 12 defenses or affirmative defenses stricken, the plaintiff’s
Response digresses into an analysis as to why the defaults against the company
defendants were appropriate in the first instance (DE 106, pp. 2-3).
After employing the semantic sleight of hand, after setting up the company
defendants as straw men to knock over, and after sweeping Diego Molinari’s 12
defenses and affirmative defenses under the rug, the plaintiff throws out the
proverbial “red herring” by arguing that “the Court need not analyze any of the

remaining factors of good cause such as whether Plaintiff would be prejudiced or
whether Defendants have a meritorious Defense” (DE 106, p. 3; emphasis added).
Of course not, because Diego Molinari never moved this Court for relief
predicated upon any of those factors, or upon the inapposite authorities cited in the
plaintiff’s Response! Thus, the plaintiff’s transparent ploy to shift the issues and
analyses simply underscores the propriety of Diego Molinari’s position, motion,
and entitlement to the relief he seeks from this Court….
WHEREFORE, Diego Molinari respectfully requests this Court enter an order
granting relief from and setting aside Mr. Diaz’s Default Final Judgment, and
denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Default Judgment, without prejudice, pending
adjudication of the individual Defendants’ claims and defenses at a trial by jury.
