DIEGO MOLINARI'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW ON STANDING

Defendant, Diego Molinari, submits this memorandum of law on the threshold
issue of whether Individual Defendant Diego Molinari has standing to seek to set
aside a final default judgment against two other Defendants, Defendant Global
Development Consultant Inc. and Defendant The New Langford, L.L.C., pursuant
to the Endorsed Order entered by this Court on July 30, 2015 (DE 125), and states:

I. OVERVIEW

First, Mr. Diaz's form of Final Default Judgment was entered eight days
before opposing memoranda of law were due to be served (DE 100), thereby
depriving Diego Molinari of any opportunity to voice his opposition in the first
instance. Second, Mr. Diaz's Final Default Judgment was entered against two of

the four defendants in this action-who, Mr. Diaz alleges, are jointly and severally

liable, and who have raised 12 joint defenses-without an express determination
"that there is no just reason for delay" in violation of Rule 54(b).

Third, "[w]hen a default is entered against one defendant in a multi-
defendant case, the preferred practice is for the court to withhold granting a default
judgment until the trial of the action on the merits against the remaining
defendants.'" Hovey v. Froggy's Saloon, Inc., Case No: 6:14-cv-632-Orl-40TBS,
LEXIS 150133 at ** 3, 4 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 3, 2014), adopted, LEXIS 149970 (M.D.
Fla. Oct. 22, 2014). Fourth, Diego Molinari has standing under Rule 60(b).

I. JOINT LIABILITY AND COMMON DEFENSES

In pertinent part, the Third Amended Complaint alleges that:

6. The individual Defendant DIEGO MOLINARI is a
corporate officer and/or owner and/or manager of the Defendant
Companies who ran the day-to-day operations of the Defendant
Companies for the relevant time period and was responsible for
paying Plaintiff's wages for the relevant time period and controlled
Plaintiff's work and schedule and was therefore Plaintiff's employer
as defined by 29 U.S.C. 203 (d).

18. Individual Defendant DIEGO MOLINARI was Plaintiff's .
individual employer pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7203(d) as set forth above.

Wherefore, the Plaintiff requests double damages and
reasonable attorney fees from Defendants, jointly and severally,
pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act as cited above, to be proven
at the time of trial for all overtime wages still owing from Plaintiffs
entire employment period with Defendants or as much as allowed by
the Fair Labor Standards Act along with court costs, interest, and any
other relief that this Court finds reasonable under the circumstances.
The Plaintiff requests a trial by jury (emphasis added).

Carlos German Diaz v. Global Development Consultant, Inc., et al.
CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN

Mr. Diaz sued two companies and two individual defendants, he alleged that
he was employed by the Defendants since 2001, he alleged that "Defendants
willfully and intentionally refused to pay" him, and he demanded "double damages
and reasonable attorney fees from Defendants, jointly and severally." Therefore,
all four Defendants answered Mr. Diaz jointly, and all four raised 12 defenses and
affirmative defenses against Mr. Diaz jointly, including lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction, statute of limitations, set-off, recoupment, and good faith.

IH. INCONSISTENT FLSA JUDGMENTS
In an FLSA decision which is on-point and persuasive, Judge Cohn held:

"Courts have recognized ... that in certain circumstances a
default judgment is inappropriate if it results in inconsistency
among judgments." Marshall & Isley Trust Co. v. Pate, 819 F.2d
806, 811 (7th Cir. 1987). The Supreme Court recognized this
proposition in Frow v. De La Vega, 82 U.S. 552, 21 L. Ed. 60
(1872).... Ruling in favor of Frow, the Supreme Court wrote:

If the court in such a case as this can lawfully
make a final decree against one defendant separately, on
the merits, while the cause was proceeding undetermined
against the other, then this absurdity might follow: there
might be one decree of the court sustaining the charge
of joint fraud committed by the defendants and another
decree disaffirming the said charge, and declaring it to
be entirely unfounded, and dismissing the complainant's
bill. And such acts of incongruity, it seems, did actually
occur in this case. Such a state of things is unseemly
and absurd, as well as unauthorized by law.

Plaintiff's FLSA claim is brought against all Defendants.
Further, because a corporate defendant can act only through its

employees and agents, the FLSA claim asserted against Defendant
Guacamole's Authentic Mexican Food & More, LLC is based on
allegations regarding the other individual Defendants' actions....
Accordingly, the defenses of the individual Defendants will be
"closely related" to the defenses of corporate Defendant
Guacamole's Authentic Mexican Food & More, LLC,... anda
default judgment against Defendant Guacamole's Authentic
Mexican Food & More, LLC would be inconsistent if the individual
Defendants defeat the claims against them in this action. Therefore,
the Court will deny Plaintiff's Motion without prejudice, pending
adjudication of this case on the merits.

Rodriguez v. Guacamole's Authentic Mexican Food and More, LLC, CASE NO.:
11-62527-CIV-COHN/SELTZER, LEXIS 29116 (S.D. Fla. March 6, 2012)
(emphasis added). Citing and quoting Rodriguez, the Middle District held:

Here, entering default judgment against Defendant Pro
Quality Concrete, Inc. at this time has the potential to result in
inconsistent judgments. Plaintiff's FLSA claims are brought against
both Defendants, and if liability is found, Defendants would be
jointly and severally liable. See Patel v. Wargo , 803 F.2d 632, 637-
38 (11" Cir. 1986)... (noting that an individual "with operational
control of a corporation's covered enterprise is an employer along with
the corporation, jointly and severally liable under the FLSA for
unpaid wages")). Moreover, "because a corporate defendant can
only act through its employees and agents," Rodriguez, 2012 US.
Dist. LEXIS 29116, 2012 WL 718688, at *3, Defendants likely have
"closely related defenses,".... Therefore, if the Court were to enter
default judgment against Defendant Pro Quality Concrete, Inc. and
Defendant Napier were to successfully present a valid defense,
inconsistent judgments could result..... Accordingly, the relief
requested in the Motion should be denied without prejudice pending
adjudication of the claims against Defendant Napier.

IV. STANDING
Citing the Eleventh Circuit opinion in Kem Manufacturing Corp. v. Wilder,
817 F.2d 1517, 1520-21 (1 1" Cir, 1987), the Northern District of Alabama held:

Rule 60(b) entitles "a party or a party's legal representative" to
seek relief from a final judgment. Rideout's, a member of the funeral
home class in Battle which has joined Liberty National in opposing
the Rule 60(b) motion now before the court, contends that the Taylors'
children and Mrs. Elrod lack standing to collaterally attack the final
judgment in Battle because they were neither parties nor
representatives in the original litigation. Contrary to this argument,
however, the court believes that the movants do have standing to bring
a Rule 60(b) challenge. First, the court has, in another order entered
today, granted their motion to intervene formally in the Battle case,
pursuant to Rule 24; thus, even technically speaking, the Taylors'
children and Mrs. Elrod are now parties to the lawsuit. Second, the
court previously included them as parties to the case during the 1985
injunction proceedings. Third and most importantly, as persons
whose "rights were directly affected by the final judgment," they fit
within the category of individuals with standing under Rule 60(b).
See Kem Manufacturing Corp. v. Wilder, 817 F.2d 1517, 1520-21
(11" Cir. 1987).

Battle v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co.,770 F. Supp. 1499, 1513 (N.D. Ala. 1991),
aff'd., 974 F.2d 1279, (11th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 509 U.S. 906 (1993)(emphasis
added; footnotes deleted). Diego Molinari has standing because his defenses are

compromised or affected by the Final Default Judgment. Jd.; Rodriguez; Staton.

WHEREFORE, Diego Molinari respectfully requests this Court enter an order
