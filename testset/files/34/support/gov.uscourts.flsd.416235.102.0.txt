Defendants.
/
DIEGO MOLINARI’S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM,
AND TO SET ASIDE, THE DEFAULT FINAL JUDGMENT
Defendant, Diego Molinari, moves this Court for relief from, and to set aside,
the Default Final Judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff, Carlos German Diaz
(“Mr. Diaz”), pursuant to Rules 54, 55, and 60, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
files his incorporated memorandum of law in support thereof and, as good cause
shown therefor, misrepresentations of facts, and reasons that justify relief, states:
I. OVERVIEW
On February 2, 2015, Mr. Diaz served Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Default
Judgment (DE 99), and Affidavit of Carlos German Diaz (DE 99-1). Accordingly,
Diego Molinari should have had 14 days to serve his opposing memorandum of
law, i.e., through Tuesday, February 17, 2015 (the next business day following

President’s Day), plus an additional three days, i.e., through Friday, February 20,
2015. S.D. Fla. L.R. 7.1(c)(1). However, last Thursday, February 12, 2015, Mr.
Diaz’s form of Final Default Judgment was entered eight days before opposing
memoranda of law were due to be served (DE 100). Id.1
Mr. Diaz’s Final Default Judgment is procedurally erroneous because it was
entered against two of the four defendants in this action—whom, Mr. Diaz alleges,
are jointly and severally liable, and whom have raised 12 joint defenses—without
any express determination by this Court “that there is no just reason for delay”—in
contravention of Rule 54(b).
Mr. Diaz’s Final Default Judgment is substantively erroneous because it is
supported by misrepresentations of fact, and because “[w]hen a default is entered
against one defendant in a multi-defendant case, the preferred practice is for the
court to withhold granting a default judgment until the trial of the action on the
merits against the remaining defendants.’” Hovey v. Froggy’s Saloon, Inc., Case
No: 6:14-cv-632-Orl-40TBS, LEXIS 150133 at ** 3, 4 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 3, 2014),
adopted, LEXIS 149970 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 22, 2014).

Reminiscent of the Japanese Declaration of War on the United States, which, due
to decoding delays, was delivered two hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor had
begun, Diego Molinari’s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for
Final Default Judgment was filed 54 minutes after the Final Default Judgment was
served (DE 101). Mr. Molinari prays that the outcome here bodes better for him!

Carlos German Diaz v. Global Development Consultant, Inc., et al.
CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN
Based upon two persuasive FLSA opinions discussed below, i.e., Rodriguez
v. Guacamole’s Authentic Mexican Food and More, LLC, CASE NO.: 11-62527CIV-COHN/SELTZER, LEXIS 29116 (S.D. Fla. March 6, 2012), and Staton v.
Pro Quality Concrete, Inc., Case No. 3:11-cv-1142-J-12JRK, LEXIS 122799 (Fla.
M.D. Aug. 2, 2012), adopted LEXIS 123035 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 29, 2012), and the
misrepresentations supporting the Final Default Judgment, this Court should set
aside that judgment, deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Default Judgment, without
prejudice, and hear this case on the merits to avoid prejudicing Diego Molinari.
II. RULES 54, 55, AND 60
Rule 54 states: “When an action presents more than one claim for relief…
or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final
judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court
expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 54
(emphasis added). Rule 55 states that the “court may set aside an entry of default
for good cause, and it may set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b).”
Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(c). The grounds in Rule 60 include “misrepresentation” and “any
other reason that justifies relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).

JOINT CLAIMS AND DEFENSES

Mr. Diaz’s Third Amended Complaint—i.e., his fourth Complaint—alleges
that he “worked for Defendants as a property maintenance man from on or about

2001 through on or about December 31, 2012” (¶ 12).2 In pertinent part, the Third
Amended Complaint also alleges, in conclusory fashion, that:
6. The individual Defendant DIEGO MOLINARI is a corporate
officer and/or owner and/or manager of the Defendant Companies
who ran the day-to-day operations of the Defendant Companies for
the relevant time period and was responsible for paying Plaintiff’s
wages for the relevant time period and controlled Plaintiff’s work and
schedule and was therefore Plaintiff’s employer as defined by 29
U.S.C. 203 (d).
….
11…. Both the Defendants’ business and the Plaintiff’s work
for the Defendants affected interstate commerce for the relevant time
period. Plaintiff’s work for the Defendants affected interstate
commerce for the relevant time period because the materials and
goods that Plaintiff used on a constant and/or continual basis and/or
that were supplied to him by the Defendants to use on the job moved
through interstate commerce prior to and/or subsequent to Plaintiff’s
use of the same. The Plaintiff’s work for the Defendants was actually
in and/or so closely related to the movement of commerce while he
worked for the Defendants that the Fair Labor Standards Act applies
to Plaintiff’s work for the Defendants.3
….
13. Additionally, Defendants regularly employed two or more
employees for the relevant time period who handled goods or
materials that travelled through interstate commerce, or used

2

Which misrepresents the irrefutable fact that Diego Molinari only “moved from
Argentina to Miami in October of 2009,” and “Global Development was formed on
December 3, 2009,” as verified in the Affidavit of Diego Molinari in Support of
Motion for Rehearing, Etc. filed contemporaneously herewith (¶¶ 37, 62).
3

As verified in the Affidavit of Diego Molinari in Support of Motion for
Rehearing, Etc., Mr. Diaz was a property maintenance man, who worked and lived
in the closed and shuttered circa 1925 Langford Building, and who was the sole
and exclusive employee of The New Langford, LLC (¶¶ 5-20).

instrumentalities of interstate commerce, thus making Defendants’
business an enterprise covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act….
14. Upon information and belief, the Defendant Companies
had gross sales or business done in excess of $500,000 annually for
the years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.4
15. Defendants, GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT
INC. and THE NEW LANGFORD, L.L.C., are joint enterprises as
defined by 29 U.S.C. 203(r) as the related activities between the
companies, performed through unified operation and/or common
control are being done for a common business purpose.
….
18. Individual Defendant DIEGO MOLINARI was Plaintiff’s
individual employer pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §203(d) as set forth above.
…
20. Defendants willfully and intentionally refused to pay
Plaintiff’s overtime wages as required by the Fair Labor Standards
4

As verified in the Affidavit of Diego Molinari in Support of Motion for
Rehearing, Etc., Mr. Diaz’s information and belief misrepresents the facts, to wit:
69. Accordingly, the combined gross revenues, sales, and
income for all defendants, for each of the years 2007, 2008, 2009,
2010, 2011, and 2012, totaled:
•
•
•
•
•
•

2007 = $ 89,509.00
2008 = $ 4,608.00
2009 = $

2010 = $ 40,992.00
2011 = $ 73,113.00
2012 = $
0.00

70. Consequently, the combined gross revenues, sales, and
income for all four of the defendants—combined—for the years 2007,
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012—combined—totaled only
$208,225.

CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN
Act as Defendants knew of the overtime requirements of the Fair
Labor Standards Act and recklessly failed to investigate whether
Defendants’ payroll practices were in accordance with the Fair Labor
Standards Act. Defendants remain owing Plaintiff these wages since
the commencement of Plaintiff’s employment with Defendants for
the time period specified above.
Wherefore, the Plaintiff requests double damages and
reasonable attorney fees from Defendants, jointly and severally,
pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act as cited above, to be proven
at the time of trial for all overtime wages still owing from Plaintiff’s
entire employment period with Defendants or as much as allowed by
the Fair Labor Standards Act along with court costs, interest, and any
other relief that this Court finds reasonable under the circumstances.
The Plaintiff requests a trial by jury (emphasis added).
The Defendants’ Answer, Defenses, and Affirmative Defenses to the Third
Amended Complaint, which was filed and served on September 22, 2014, jointly
raises 12 defenses and affirmative defenses, including, prima facie, lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction, statute of limitations, set-off, recoupment, and good faith.
IV.

DISCUSSION

Mr. Diaz has sued two company and two individual defendants, he has alleged
that he was employed by the Defendants since 2001, he has alleged that “Defendants
willfully and intentionally refused to pay” him, and he has demanded “double
damages and reasonable attorney fees from Defendants, jointly and severally.”
Accordingly, the Defendants answered Mr. Diaz jointly, and they raised defenses
and affirmative defenses against Mr. Diaz jointly.
In an FLSA decision which is on-point and persuasive, Judge Cohn held:

Carlos German Diaz v. Global Development Consultant, Inc., et al.
CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN
A defaulted defendant is deemed to “admit[] the plaintiff’s
well-pleaded allegations of fact.” Nishimatsu Constr. Co., Ltd. v.
Houston Nat'l Bank, 515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir. 1975). The
defendant, however, “is not held to admit facts that are not wellpleaded or to admit conclusions of law.” Id.; accord Cotton v. Mass.
Mut. Life Ins. Co., 402 F.3d 1267, 1278 (11th Cir. 2005). “Entry of
judgment by default is a drastic remedy which should be used only
in extreme situations.” Wahl [v. McIver], 773 F.2d at 1169 [(11th Cir.
1985)]. “There is a strong preference that cases be heard on the
merits instead of imposing sanctions that deprive a litigant of his
day in court.” Owens v. Benton, 190 Fed. Appx. 762, 763 (11th Cir.
2006).
“Courts have recognized . . . that in certain circumstances a
default judgment is inappropriate if it results in inconsistency
among judgments.” Marshall & Ilsley Trust Co. v. Pate, 819 F.2d
806, 811 (7th Cir. 1987). The Supreme Court recognized this
proposition in Frow v. De La Vega, 82 U.S. 552, 21 L. Ed. 60 (1872).
In Frow, the plaintiff filed a complaint charging eight defendants with
a “joint conspiracy” to defraud him of a piece of real property. Of
these eight defendants, Frow failed to file a timely answer and the
district court entered a pre-trial default judgment against him. The
district court ultimately decided the merits of the case against the
plaintiff and dismissed the complaint. Frow appealed the default
judgment to the Supreme Court. Ruling in favor of Frow, the Supreme
Court wrote:
If the court in such a case as this can lawfully
make a final decree against one defendant separately, on
the merits, while the cause was proceeding undetermined
against the other, then this absurdity might follow: there
might be one decree of the court sustaining the charge
of joint fraud committed by the defendants and another
decree disaffirming the said charge, and declaring it to
be entirely unfounded, and dismissing the complainant's
bill. And such acts of incongruity, it seems, did actually
occur in this case. Such a state of things is unseemly
and absurd, as well as unauthorized by law.

Carlos German Diaz v. Global Development Consultant, Inc., et al.
CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN
Id. at 554.
Modern courts have interpreted Frow to stand for
the following proposition: [I]f at trial facts are proved
that exonerate certain defendants and that as a matter of
logic preclude the liability of another defendant, the
plaintiff should be collaterally estopped from obtaining a
judgment against the latter defendant, even though it
failed to participate in the proceeding in which the
exculpatory facts were proved.
Farzetta v. Turner & Newall, Ltd., 797 F.2d 151, 154 (3d Cir. 1986).
Several Circuits, including the Eleventh, have found Frow
applies to situations where defendants are jointly and severally
liable, or have closely related defenses…. Gulf Coast Fans, Inc. v.
Midwest Elecs. Imps., Inc., 740 F.2d 1499, 1512 (11th Cir. 1984);
U.S. for Use of Hudson v. Peerless Ins. Co., 374 F.2d 942 (4th Cir.
1967). Other federal courts have applied the Frow doctrine more
narrowly, such as in cases of true joint liability or cases where the
defaulting defendant cannot be liable unless the non-defaulting
defendants are liable. See, e.g., McMillian/McMillian, Inc. v.
Monticello Ins. Co., 116 F.3d 319 (8th Cir. 1997)(Frow not extended
to a situation where the co-defendants share closely related interests
but are not truly jointly liable); Whelan v. Abell, 953 F.2d 663, 67475, 293 U.S. App. D.C. 267 (D.C. Cir. 1992)(Frow should apply only
when liability is truly joint or necessary for effective relief); In re
Uranium Antitrust Litig., 617 F.2d 1248, 1256-58 (7th Cir.
1980)(Frow rule not extended to cases of joint and several liability if
results are not logically inconsistent or contradictory).
According to Wright, Miller and Kane, the “key” in deciding
the application of Frow to individual cases is to “recognize that the
Frow principle is designed to apply only when it is necessary that the
relief against the defendants be consistent. If that is not the case, then
a default against one defendant may stand, even though the remaining
defendants are found not liable.” 10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure § 2690 (3d ed. 1998 & Supp. 2009). Even
courts that take a limited view of the continued force of Frow

conclude that the case controls “in situations where the liability of one
defendant necessarily depends upon the liability of the others.” Int'l
Controls Corp. v. Vesco, 535 F.2d 742, 746 n. 4 (2d Cir. 1976); see
also In re Uranium, 617 F.2d at 1257.
Plaintiff's FLSA claim is brought against all Defendants.
Further, because a corporate defendant can act only through its
employees and agents, the FLSA claim asserted against Defendant
Guacamole’s Authentic Mexican Food & More, LLC is based on
allegations regarding the other individual Defendants’ actions….
Accordingly, the defenses of the individual Defendants will be
“closely related” to the defenses of corporate Defendant
Guacamole’s Authentic Mexican Food & More, LLC,… and a
default judgment against Defendant Guacamole’s Authentic
Mexican Food & More, LLC would be inconsistent if the individual
Defendants defeat the claims against them in this action. Therefore,
the Court will deny Plaintiff’s Motion without prejudice, pending
adjudication of this case on the merits.

LEXIS

29116

(S.D.

Fla.

March

2012)(emphasis added).
Citing this Court’s decision in Rodriguez, the Middle District denied a FLSA
Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Entry of Default Final Judgment and held:
Here, entering default judgment against Defendant Pro
Quality Concrete, Inc. at this time has the potential to result in
inconsistent judgments. Plaintiff’s FLSA claims are brought against
both Defendants, and if liability is found, Defendants would be
jointly and severally liable. See Patel v. Wargo , 803 F.2d 632, 63738 (11th Cir. 1986)(quoting Donovan v. Agnew, 712 F.2d 1509, 1511
(1st Cir. 1983)(noting that an individual “with operational control of a
corporation's covered enterprise is an employer along with the
corporation, jointly and severally liable under the FLSA for unpaid
wages”)). Moreover, “because a corporate defendant can only act

through its employees and agents,” Rodriguez, 2012 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 29116, 2012 WL 718688, at *3, Defendants likely have
“closely related defenses,” 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29116, [WL] at *2.
Here, Defendant Napier is the only person alleged to have owned and
operated Defendant Pro Quality Concrete, Inc., and those two parties
are the only named Defendants. Therefore, if the Court were to enter
default judgment against Defendant Pro Quality Concrete, Inc. and
Defendant Napier were to successfully present a valid defense,
inconsistent judgments could result. See Michaud, 2007 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 44375, 2007 WL 1696014, at *1 (declining to enter a default
judgment in a similar situation); Rodriguez, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
29116, 2012 WL 718688, at *3 (same). Accordingly, the relief
requested in the Motion should be denied without prejudice pending
adjudication of the claims against Defendant Napier.
Staton v. Pro Quality Concrete, Inc., Case No. 3:11-cv-1142-J-12JRK, LEXIS
122799 (Fla. M.D. Aug. 2, 2012), adopted LEXIS 123035 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 29,
2012)(emphasis added).
Mr. Diaz FLSA claims are brought against all of the Defendants, and his
demands for judgment are against all of the Defendants jointly and severally. The
company Defendants allegedly acted by and through the individual Defendants.
The defenses and affirmative defenses of the company and individual Defendants
are coterminous. A default judgment against the company Defendants would be
inconsistent if the individual Defendants defeat Mr. Diaz’s claims against them at
the jury trial in this action. Accordingly, Mr. Diaz’s Plaintiff’s Motion for Final
Default Judgment should be denied, without prejudice. Guacamole’s; Pro Quality.
Independent of, and in addition to, the foregoing grounds:

CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN
[A] defendant’s default alone does not require the court to enter a
default judgment. DIRECTV, Inc. v. Trawick, 359 F. Supp. 2d 1204,
1206 (M.D. Ala. 2005). To enter a judgment, there must be sufficient
basis in the pleadings to support the relief sought. Id. “The defendant
is not held to admit facts that are not well-pleaded or to admit
conclusions of law. In short, . . . a default is not treated as an absolute
confession of the defendant of his liability and of the plaintiff’s right
to recover.” Nishimatsu Constr. Co., Ltd. v. Houston Nat'l Bank, 515
F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir. 1975).
Loos v. Club Paris, LLC, 684 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1333 (M.D. Fla. 2010); De Lotta
v. Dezenzo’s Italian Restaurant, Inc., Case No. 6:08-cv-2033-Orl-22KRS, LEXIS
110257 at **3, 4 (M.D. Fla. 2009).
Like its three predecessors,5 Mr. Diaz’s Third Amended Complaint is replete
with legal conclusions, several of which are erroneous. For example, the Third
Amended Complaint alleges that “the Defendants’ enterprise was a strictly
international one: the Defendants, alongside the other joint enterprise companies
mentioned below, operated abroad while maintaining business and properties
within Florida” (¶ 12). “However, FLSA does not extend to territories over which
US has no jurisdiction….” Robinson v. Harbert International, Inc., 743 F. Supp.
797 (N.D. Ala. 1989), affd. without opinion, 912 F.2d 1423 (11th Cir. 1990).
Similarly, based only upon his “information and belief,” Mr. Diaz alleges that
“the Defendant Companies had gross sales or business done in excess of $500,000

5

See, i.e., this Court’s Order Granting Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Second
Amended Complaint (D.E. 57).

CASE NO: 13-20729-CIV-LENARD/GOODMAN
annually for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012” (¶ 14). This is a threshold fact
to establish jurisdiction in this action, but, prima facie, the “information and belief”
of a “property maintenance man,” concerning gross sales and business done by an
international enterprise, is tantamount to speculation and conjecture.
Because Mr. Diaz’s Third Amended Complaint carries forward most of the
deficient allegations and conclusions denounced in the Order Granting Defendants’
Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint, there is not a sufficient basis in
the pleadings to support the relief sought by Mr. Diaz at this time. Loos; De Lotta.
Furthermore, “[a]lthough a defaulted defendant admits well-pleaded
allegations of liability, allegations relating to the amount of damages are not
admitted by virtue of default. Rather, the Court determines the amount and
character of damages to be awarded. See 10A C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane,
Federal Practice & Procedure § 2688 at 58-59 (3d ed. 1998).” Miller v. Paradise of
Port Richey, Inc., 75 F. Supp. 2d 1342, 1346 (M.D. Fla. 1999); Clark v. Three
Mulligans, LLC, Case No: 6:13-cv-1801-Orl-40KRS, LEXIS 179346 at *3 (M.D.
Fla. Dec. 16, 2014), adopted, LEXIS 852 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 6, 2015).
Finally, Mr. Diaz has requested a jury trial, he has not moved to withdraw
his request, and the Defendants have not waived their rights to a jury trial.
When a plaintiff demands a jury trial, the defendant is entitled
to a jury trial on unliquidated damages, regardless of whether default
judgment has been entered against the defendant…. Moreover, a
12

demand for a jury trial may not be withdrawn without the consent of
the parties and any waiver of the right to a jury trial must be
manifested by affirmative action such as ‘a specific waiver in writing
or by announcement in open court.”
