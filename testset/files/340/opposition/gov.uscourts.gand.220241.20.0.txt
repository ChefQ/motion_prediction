CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC’S RESPONSE IN
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ORAL ARGUMENT
COMES NOW, Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC (“Carrington”), and
files this Response in Opposition to the Plaintiff’s Motion for Oral Argument [Doc.
19], respectfully showing this Honorable Court as follows:
1.

On September 20, 2015, Plaintiff Anthony Dean Butler filed his

Complaint in this matter, asserting causes of action against Carrington under the
Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(“FDCPA”). See [Doc. 1].

2.

On November 18, 2015, Carrington filed a Motion to Dismiss under

Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). [Doc. 7]. The Motion to Dismiss argues that the Plaintiff
has failed to plead sufficient facts to support a claim under the FCRA or FDCPA,
and that the acts complained of do not, under any circumstances, constitute a
violation of the FDCPA. See [Doc. 7-1].
3.

The Plaintiff filed his Response to the Motion to Dismiss on January

7, 2016. [Doc. 18]. Then, on January 11, 2016, the Plaintiff filed a Motion for Oral
Argument on the Motion to Dismiss. [Doc. 19]. The Plaintiff gives no reason for
why oral argument is needed, and the entire motion is just one sentence long:
“Comes now Plaintiff Anthony Dean Butler by and though his undersigned
Counsel and requests oral argument on Defendant Carrington Mortgage Services,
LLC’s Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim.” Id.
4.

Under LR 7.1(E), “Motions will be decided by the court without oral

hearing, unless a hearing is ordered by the court.” In this case, no hearing should
be ordered. The Motion to Dismiss does not present any novel legal arguments,
and this case does not present complex facts or legal questions. As such, it can and
should be decided on the briefs. Moreover, the Plaintiff does not explain why oral
argument is necessary. This Court routinely denies requests or oral arguments in
similar situations. See, e.g., Am. Signal Co. v. All Am. Semiconductor of Atlanta,

Inc., No. 1:05-CV-2200, 2006 WL 167956, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 19, 2006)
(denying motion for oral argument because “plaintiff does not explain why oral
argument would be helpful or necessary” and “[a]fter reviewing the motions, the
court finds that oral argument is not necessary to further explain the positions of
the parties or the applicable law.”); Cascase Crossing II, LLC v. Radioshack Corp.,
No. 1:01-cv-3084-GET, 2003 WL 2645360, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 22, 2003)
(denying motion for oral argument because “[u]pon review of the pleadings, the
court can rule on plaintiff’s motion . . . on the briefs submitted.”).
5.

Because there is no evident reason for oral argument on the Motion to

Dismiss, the Motion should be decided on the briefs. Accordingly, Carrington
respectfully requests that this Court deny the Plaintiff’s Motion for Oral Argument.
Respectfully submitted this 12th day of January, 2016.
