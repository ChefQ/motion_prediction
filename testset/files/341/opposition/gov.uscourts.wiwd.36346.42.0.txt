IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
LEWIS, J.,
individually and on behalf
of all others similarly situated,
Plaintiff,
Case No. 15-cv-082
vs.
EPIC SYSTEMS CORPORATION,
Defendant.

PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS AND COMPEL ARBITRATION

INTRODUCTION
Epic Systems Corporation has imposed upon its employees an unjust
mandate to individually arbitrate their wage claims without the benefit of their
federally protected right to engage in concerted activity with fellow employees. The
arbitration contract1 explicitly forbids plaintiffs from bringing claims collectively.
Each employee must bring their own cause of action alone against Epic’s colossal
resources. This class waiver provision cannot be enforced without offending the
bedrock purpose of the National Labor Relations Act and Fair Labor Standards Act:
namely, protecting employees’ long-recognized right to fair wages and collective
action against employers wielding superior economic power.
For ease of readability, Plaintiff will refer to this document as the “arbitration contract”
throughout; however, Plaintiff maintains that no enforceable contract to arbitrate has been formed.

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 2 of 44

This Court, in Herrington v. Waterstone Mortgage, has twice considered and
affirmed that an agreement which forbids workers from taking collective legal
action impermissibly interferes with the right of employees to act together for their
mutual aid and protection. That precise question is again before the Court in this
case, and this Court must, in line with its previous rulings, invalidate the no-class
provision of Epic’s arbitration contract.
The present arbitration contract fails under Herrington. In addition, it is
important to note that the terms and circumstances related to the imposition of the
arbitration contract in this case are far worse than those in Herrington. Beyond
containing an impermissible bar on collective actions, the contract allows Epic to
pursue its claims in court – including class claims2 – while its employees cannot.
Further, the contract deprives employees of any opportunity to reject its terms. Epic
has also retained the unilateral and unlimited ability to change or eliminate the
terms of the contract altogether.3 The contract is not a product of mutual agreement
or meaningful choice, but of Epic’s forced “assent” from Plaintiff, who could neither
seek understanding of the contract nor signal repudiation of its terms.
In addition to its impermissibly one-sided nature, the circumstances
surrounding Epic’s rollout of this contract are dubious at best. This contract, which

Even while limiting the rights of its employees to bring claims collectively in court, Epic has
preserved for itself the ability to try a class case in court. A savings clause provides that if the noclass provision of the arbitration contract is found unenforceable, a class case is required to proceed
in court rather than in arbitration. Should this Court invalidate the no-class provision and require
the class to proceed to arbitration, even Epic appears to recognize that court is preferable to
arbitration.
3 That is, the terms of this contract to arbitrate explicitly permit Epic to escape any declared
promise to be bound by them. Epic has in fact promised nothing in exchange for its employees
relinquishment of their legal right to have their claims heard collectively in court.

requires only that wage and hour claims be arbitrated and eliminates the right of
employees to act collectively, was imposed in the midst of a collective and class
wage-and-hour suit against Epic for misclassifying employees. (Nordgren v. Epic
Systems Corporation, No. 13-cv-840 (W.D. Wis.).)
This case, like the Nordgren case, involves a class of Technical Writers who
allege that Epic misclassified them as exempt from overtime; as such, Epic did not
pay them overtime wages for all hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek. Named
Plaintiff J. Lewis brought this case on behalf of himself and all others similarly
situated. Epic now seeks to deprive Lewis and the putative class of their right to act
collectively by asking this Court to dismiss Lewis’s case and compel individual
arbitration. In so doing, Epic ignores this Court’s ruling in Herrington and tries to
invoke a federal policy favoring arbitration to sanction its own transgression of
Plaintiff’s right, of which Epic was keenly aware when it introduced this contract, to
seek unpaid overtime wages in court, and as a class. For the reasons described in
detail below, Plaintiff requests that the Court deny Epic’s motion to compel
individual arbitration and permit this case to proceed collectively in court.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
I.

THE ARBITRATION CONTRACT
Epic emailed the arbitration contract to its employees on April 2, 2014. (Dkt.

# 22.1, Ex. A (“Arbitration Contract”); Dkt. # 22.2, Ex. B (“Arbitration Email”).) The
text of the arbitration contract states that Epic considers an employee who
continues to work at Epic subject to the contract’s terms:

3

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 4 of 44

Agreement to Arbitrate. Epic Systems Corporation
(“Epic”) and I agree to use binding arbitration, instead of
going to court, for any “covered claims” that arise or have
arisen between me and Epic…. I understand that if I
continue to work at Epic, I will be deemed to have
accepted this Agreement.
(Arbitration Contract.) The contract leaves unanswered when it went into effect.
Although the contract is dated April 2, 2014, it does not state when its terms
become applicable. (Arbitration Contract.) Importantly, although the contract states
that continued employment will be deemed acceptance, it does not clarify
employment after what date. Would an employee who continued to work at Epic
after reading the arbitration email be considered to have accepted it? To avoid the
terms of the arbitration contract, would an employee have to pack her desk
immediately upon receiving the contract? It is not clear.
Epic’s moving brief suggests that Epic considered its employees bound by
clicking “I understand and agree” and “by continuing to remain employed after the
Arbitration Agreement went into effect”—but even in its brief, Epic fails to define

when “went into effect” occurred. (Dkt. # 20, Defendant’s Brief in Support of its
Motion to Dismiss and Compel Individual Arbitration (“Def. Br.”) at 7.) Plaintiff
sought discovery as to how many employees allegedly assented to the arbitration
contract, but Epic refused to produce this information, and Plaintiff’s attempt to
compel this information was denied. (Dkt. # 38, Court’s Order on Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel.) Regardless, at least one of the individuals who has opted into this suit
never clicked “I agree” to assent to the contract. (Declaration of Karen Campbell
(“Campbell Dec.”) at ¶ 5.)

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 5 of 44

A.

The Arbitration Contract Applies Exclusively to Wage and Hour
Claims

The arbitration contract defines “covered claims” as follows:
“Covered claims” are any statutory or common law legal
claims,
asserted
or
unasserted,
alleging
the
underpayment or overpayment of wages, expenses, loans,
reimbursements, bonuses, commissions, advances, or any
element of compensation, based on claims of eligibility for
overtime,
on-the-clock,
off-the-clock
or
other
uncompensated hours worked claims, timing or amount of
pay at separation, improper deductions of pay or paidtime-off, fee disputes, travel time claims, meal or rest
period claims, overpayment claims, claims of failure to
reimburse or repay loans or advances, claims over
improper or inaccurate pay statements, or any other
claimed violation of wage-and-hour practices or
procedures under local, state or federal statutory or
common law.
I understand and agree that arbitration is the only
litigation forum for resolving covered claims, and that
both Epic and I are waiving the right to a trial before a
judge or jury in federal or state court in favor of
arbitration.
(Arbitration Contract.) Thus, perhaps with one exception of “overpayment” claims,
the contract’s covered claims exclusively encompass wage and hour claims that
employees would bring against Epic. To date, Epic has never brought an
overpayment claim, nor any other “covered claim,” against an employee.
(Declaration of William E. Parsons in Support of Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Law in
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and Compel Arbitration (“Parsons
Dec.”) Ex. A, Defendant’s Answers to Plaintiff’s First Set of Interrogatories, Answer
to Interrogatory No. 11.) The contract effectively binds only employees.
B.

The Arbitration Contract Waives Employees’ Right to Bring Class
Claims
5

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 6 of 44

The arbitration contract prevents employees from bringing their wage and
hour claims collectively or as part of a class:
Waiver of Class and Collective Claims. I also agree that
covered claims will be arbitrated only on an individual
basis, and that both Epic and I waive the right to
participate in or receive money or any other relief from
any class, collective, or representative proceeding. No
party may bring a claim on behalf of other individuals,
and any arbitrator hearing my claim may not: (i) combine
more than one individual’s claim or claims into a single
case; (ii) participate in or facilitate notification of others of
potential claims; or (iii) arbitrate any form of a class,
collective, or representative proceeding.
(Arbitration Contract.) The waiver of class and collective claims unambiguously
denies Technical Writers (“TWs”) the opportunity to pursue their individual claims
as if they were in court.
The contract also includes the following Savings Clause:
Provided, however, the Waiver of Class and Collective
Claims is found to be unenforceable, then any claim
brought on a class, collective, or representative action
basis must be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction,
and such court shall be the exclusive forum for such
claims.
(Arbitration Contract.) In other words, if this court deems the class waiver provision
unenforceable, Epic requires that any class or collective wage action must be filed in
court, and cannot be filed in arbitration.
The arbitration contract also limits the rights that employees have in court: it
precludes their right to a jury trial and severely restricts access to discovery.
Parties are limited to a single interrogatory identifying potential witnesses, 25
requests for production of documents, and a maximum of two eight-hour days of
6

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 7 of 44

witness depositions. (Arbitration Contract.) These limitations mean arbitration is,
in fact, substantially different than court.
C.

The Arbitration Contract Vests Epic with the Unilateral and NonNegotiable Power to Modify Its Terms

The arbitration contract permits Epic to change its terms or eliminate the
contract altogether. Specifically, the contract states:
Modifications and Amendments. I understand and agree
that Epic may change or terminate this agreement after
giving me 90 days written or electronic notice. Any change
or termination will not apply to a pending claim.
(Arbitration Contract.) The above language is ambiguous as to whether Epic will
provide notice of the substantive content of the change, or merely notice of the fact
that Epic is going to change or terminate the contract. Nor does the contract provide
that, upon such a change, continued employment would serve as acceptance of the
revised contract.
II.

EPIC IMPOSED ITS ARBITRATION CONTRACT WITH A
MISLEADING EMAIL AND WITHOUT ANY MECHANISM FOR
EMPLOYEES TO ASSENT TO ITS TERMS OR GATHER ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION
A.

The Arbitration Cover Email Contains Numerous Misrepresentations

On April 2, 2014, Epic disseminated its arbitration contract via a mass email
that purported to explain Epic’s reasons for imposing this contract on its employees:
For about 6 months, we have been discussing the pros and
cons of arbitration vs. litigation for employment related
matters. The recent class action case filed against us,
claiming that some of our salaried professionals should be
re-classified as hourly employees, has convinced us that
litigation is inefficient and wasteful, and highlights the
advantages of arbitration.
7

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 8 of 44

(Arbitration Email.) This passage mischaracterizes the Nordgren suit, in which a
class of employees alleged that they had been misclassified and unlawfully deprived
of overtime pay—not that they should become hourly employees. Plaintiff sought
discovery as to whether Epic had in fact been contemplating arbitration prior to the
filing of the Nordgren class action case to determine whether this representation to
Epic’s employees was true. Epic refused to provide any response, even the date
when Epic began these alleged “discussions” of arbitration.
The cover email also included a misleading explanation of the arbitration
contract – an explanation that went to a group of employees who have no legal
training, and who were therefore unable to assess whether Epic’s representations
about arbitration were accurate.
Arbitration will allow you to pursue your individual
claims as if you were in court. The same laws apply and
the arbitrator (whom you would participate in selecting)
would be directed to reach a legal conclusion, and can
provide the same remedies as if you were in court. Since
arbitration puts some reasonable limits on processes, by
addressing the merits of your claim through arbitration,
rather than through individual litigation or class action,
disputes can be resolved more quickly, with less expense
and without the extraordinary distraction from our work
that litigation often imposes.
(Arbitration Email.) Of course, the same laws do not apply, as collective action is
explicitly prohibited under the contract. And because employees under the contract
are limited in terms of their access to discovery, as well as their right to a jury trial,
they are not able to pursue claims “as if…in court.” Epic also made representations
as to the costs of arbitration that neglect to provide complete information:

8

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 9 of 44

Under the new process, Epic will pay for the costs of
arbitration. You would pay a “filing fee” (described below)
and although you don’t need a lawyer for arbitration, you
still may retain one at your expense.
(Arbitration Email.) Epic fails to note that under both Wisconsin state wage and
hour law and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) – the main “covered claims”
under this contract – employees may be entitled to fee-shifting and to have their
attorney’s fees paid by the employer if they are successful. Wis. Stat. § 109.03(6);
Jackman v. WMAC Inv. Corp., 610 F. Supp. 290, 291 (1985); 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
B.

Epic Did Not Provide Employees an Opportunity to Gather
Information About the Arbitration Contract

The email concluded by suggesting that recipients request additional
information about the contract, stating:
Please review and acknowledge your Agreement by
clicking “Vote” and then selecting “I understand and
agree” or if you’d like someone to contact you about it,
please select “Contact me.”
We will follow up with you if we have not otherwise heard
from you before end of day on Friday April 4th.
(Arbitration Email.) On April 4, 2014, Epic sent a second email to all employees
that simply copied and pasted the very same text of the April 2nd email, with one
additional paragraph:
Thanks to all who have previously replied. If you have,
you can delete this. We are in the process of coordinating
our follow up to anyone who had questions or indicated
they’d like to be contacted. Please take a moment to
review the materials if you haven’t previously as it will
assist us in knowing how best to follow-up.
(Parsons Dec. Ex. B, April 4, 2014 Email from Tina Perkins, EPIC LEWIS 42.)
9

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 10 of 44

According to two opt-in plaintiffs, this follow-up did not occur. Karen
Campbell, a TW with Epic from 2005 until 2015, never responded to the April 2
email. (Campbell Dec. at ¶ 5.) She believed, based on Epic’s email, that someone
would follow up with her. (Id.) After Campbell received the same email on April 4,
she again waited for someone from Epic to follow up with her, but no one did. (Id.;
Epic’s Emails to Opt-Ins Regarding Arbitration.) Nor was Campbell informed when
the arbitration contract became binding, as she never clicked “I agree.” (Id.)
Current TW Rebecca Rogers states that she was “confused” when she
received the email about the arbitration contract. (Declaration of Rebecca Rogers
(“Rogers Dec.”) at ¶ 5.) Rogers responded to the email by clicking “I agree,” but she
also included several questions about the contract in the text of her email:
Is the arbitration agreement just for wages and hours, or
is it for anything that comes up between Epic and
employees (e.g., on-campus injuries or something)?
Is this meant just for employee-to-company disputes, or
does it also encompass disputes between employees?
Where do the arbitrators come from? That is, is there a
group of them on retainer by Epic that we’d choose from,
or do we find them by some other method?
(Id. at ¶ 6; see also Parsons Dec. Ex. C, April 4, 2014 Email from Rebecca Rogers,
EPIC LEWIS 103.) Like Campbell, Rogers never received any response to her
questions. (Rogers Dec. at ¶ 7.) In fact, Plaintiff requested that Epic produce all
communications between Epic and opt-in plaintiffs pertaining to the arbitration
contract and Epic’s production was simply of the repetitive April 2 and April 4
emails from Epic to the opt-ins. (Parsons Dec. Ex. D, Epic’s Emails to Opt-Ins
10

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 11 of 44

Regarding Arbitration.) No other communications between Epic and either of these
opt-ins were produced, indicating that such follow up communications do not exist.
In addition, Plaintiff sought discovery from Epic as to whether it had a plan
in place to follow up with TWs who sought more information, as well as whether
any TWs did request further information. Epic refused to produce any information
on this issue. (See Declaration of Breanne L. Snapp in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Discovery (“Snapp Dec.”).) Plaintiff therefore does not know whether
more TWs sought information about the contract, or whether Epic provided any
opportunity for its employees to get more information prior to assenting to this
contract. The inference is of course that Epic did not have a plan to follow up with
its employees and that the arbitration contract was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition,
which Epic would not explain further.
III.

EPIC DISSIMENATED THE ARBITRATION CONTRACT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NORDGREN V. EPIC SYSTEMS LITIGATION

On December 6, 2013, a former Epic Quality Assurance (“QA”) employee,
Evan Nordgren, brought a collective and class action claim against Epic for unpaid
overtime wages resulting from Epic’s alleged misclassification of QAs as overtime
exempt. (Nordgren v. Epic Systems Corp., Case No.13-cv-840 (W.D. Wis. 2013), dkt.
# 1, Nordgren Collective and Class Action Complaint.) On April 2, 2014, Epic
disseminated the arbitration contract and cover email at issue here, a contract
explicitly limited to foreclosing employees’ ability to bring a class wage claim, as
was brought in Nordgren. (Arbitration Email; Arbitration Contract.) The Nordgren
lawsuit settled in November 2014 for $5,400,000.00. (Nordgren v. Epic Systems
11

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 12 of 44

Corp., dkt. # 68.1, Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims.) After the case was
resolved, Epic disseminated an email to all Epic employees pertaining to the suit,
again misstating the nature of the QA’s claims:
As most of you know, last year, a former QA employee
who is now in law school filed a lawsuit claiming that QA
staff at Epic should be paid hourly, and as a result should
receive overtime pay. We have always disagreed, and
continue to disagree strongly, with the claims in this
case. Every day, our QAers excel at thinking creatively
and making decisions that ensure our software is safe,
efficient and intuitive to use. These are hallmarks of
salaried professionals.
Plaintiff J. Lewis, a former TW for Epic, filed the above-captioned case on
February 10, 2015 on behalf of himself and a similarly-situated class of TWs. (Dkt.
# 1, Lewis Collective and Class Action Complaint.) This complaint alleges Epic has
deprived TWs of overtime pay in violation of the FLSA. Like Epic’s QA employees,
TWs are entry-level, non-technical Epic employees. (Lewis Collective and Class
Action Complaint.) TWs prepare end-user materials to accompany Epic’s software, a
job which Lewis alleges does not require technical expertise or the exercise of
discretion, again similar to the QAs’ claims. (Id. at ¶¶ 12, 14-15.) Both TWs and
QAs work over 40 hours per workweek, and both are classified by Epic as overtime
exempt. (Id. at ¶¶ 10, 18; Nordgren Collective and Class Action Complaint at ¶¶ 10,
13.) On April 13, 2015, Epic filed a motion to dismiss this case and compel
individual arbitration, alleging that Lewis is bound by the arbitration contract to
bring his wage claim individually through arbitration. (Dkt. # 19, Defendant’s
Motion to Dismiss and Compel Individual Arbitration (“Def. Br.”).)

12

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 13 of 44

LEGAL STANDARD
Epic, relying on case law that compels arbitration where a valid agreement to
arbitrate exists, maintains that Lewis must arbitrate this case. (Def. Br. at 5-6.)
However, Epic’s argument avoids the important first question in this case: whether
any valid agreement to arbitrate exists. As the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)
itself states, “If the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or
refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the
trial thereof.” 9 U.S.C. § 4.
In opposing arbitration, Plaintiff contends that, under Wisconsin contract
law, no valid arbitration contract exists in the first place. The FAA’s presumption in
favor of arbitration does not apply to this inquiry. See Druco Restaurants, Inc. v.
Steak N Shake Enterprises, Inc., 765 F.3d 776, 781 (7th Cir. 2014) (internal
citations omitted); see also Penn v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, Inc., 269 F.3d 753,
758-59 (7th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted) (“While the Supreme Court has
stressed… that federal policy under the FAA favors the enforcement of valid
arbitration agreements…the Court has been equally adamant that a party can be
forced into arbitration only if she has in fact entered into a valid, enforceable
contract waiving her right to a judicial forum.”).
To determine whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists, a federal court
looks to the state law that governs the formation of contracts. Gibson v.
Neighborhood Health Clinics, Inc., 121 F.3d 1126, 1130 (7th Cir. 1997) (citing 9
U.S.C. § 2); First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995)).

13

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 14 of 44

Plaintiff maintains that no agreement to arbitrate exists here because Epic’s
illusory promises are fatal to the formation of the contract.
If the court determines that an arbitration contract exists, the court may
nevertheless invalidate it based on “generally applicable [state law] contract
defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.” Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v.
Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 686-87 (1996) (internal citations omitted); AT&T Mobility
LLC v. Concepcion, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 1746 (2011). The party resisting arbitration
must show, as Plaintiff does here, that the contract is unconscionable. Felland v.
Clifton, 2013 WL 3778967, *7 (W.D. Wis. July 18, 2013)4 (citing Green Tree
Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 91 (2000)).
Although the FAA does not define the standard for a district court’s review of
a motion to compel arbitration, courts have held that “such motions ‘are reviewed
under a summary judgment standard.’” Henry Technologies Holdings, LLC, v.
Giordano, 2014 WL 3845870, *3, (W.D. Wis. Aug. 5, 2014) (internal citations
omitted). The party moving to compel arbitration bears the burden of
demonstrating that the employment contract requires the parties to arbitrate. Id.
Thus, if Epic fails to present sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the
arbitration contract requires Plaintiff to arbitrate, or if Plaintiff creates a genuine
dispute of material fact, the court must deny the motion to compel arbitration and
hold a trial on the question of whether a valid contract to arbitrate exists. See id.
ARGUMENT
Epic’s motion to compel arbitration must fail for three reasons. First, the
4

All unpublished cases are attached as Exhibit E to Parsons Dec.

14

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 15 of 44

arbitration contract is procedurally and substantively unconscionable to a fatal
degree. It is procedurally unconscionable because Epic denied Plaintiff any
opportunity to understand the contract’s terms or to signal his rejection of them –
effectively, Plaintiff had no meaningful choice to accept or deny the contract because
Epic rendered him unable to reject its terms. The contract is substantively
unconscionable because its terms are impermissibly one-sided in Epic’s favor.
Second, the arbitration contract must fail because it is not supported by
consideration, given Epic’s retention of the unfettered, unilateral right to alter its
terms. Finally, the Agreement cannot stand because it impermissibly prevents
Plaintiff from exercising their substantive federal right of collective action under
Section 7 of the NLRA. Per the terms of the contract, should the Court deem the
forced waiver of employees’ right to act collectively unenforceable, that waiver
provision must be severed and the case must proceed, collectively, in court.
I.

THE ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS PROCEDURALLY AND
SUBSTANTIVELY UNCONSCIONABLE AND THEREFORE CANNOT
BE ENFORCED
The FAA explicitly preserves state law contract defenses such as

unconscionability to arbitration contracts.5 9 U.S.C. § 2; Concepcion, 131 S. Ct.
1740, 1746 (2011). In Wisconsin, courts weigh procedural and substantive factors on
a case-by-case basis to determine whether a contract is unconscionable. Villalobos v.
EZCorp., Inc., 2013 WL 3732875, *2 (W.D. Wis. July 15, 2013) (citing Wis. Auto
Title Loans v. Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶¶ 29, 33, 290 Wis. 2d 514, 714 N.W.2d 155; Disc.
Epic claims that § 2 of the FAA “plainly states that agreements to arbitrate ‘shall be valid,
irrevocable, and enforceable.’” This quote omits the remainder of the statute’s final sentence: “save
upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” (Def. Br. at 4.)

Fabric House of Racine, Inc., 117 Wis. 2d 587, 602, 345 N.W.2d 417 (1984).
Unconscionability is the “absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the
parties, together with contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other
party.” Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶ 32.
A.

The Purported Formation of the Arbitration Contract Exhibits a High
Degree of Procedural Unconscionability

The procedural unconscionability inquiry “requires examining factors that
bear upon the formation of the contract, that is, whether there was a ‘real and
voluntary meeting of the minds’ of the contracting parties.” Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶ 34.
Such factors include, but are not limited to:
[A]ge, education, intelligence, business acumen and
experience, relative bargaining power, who drafted the
contract, whether the terms were explained to the weaker
party, [and] whether alterations in the printed terms
would have been permitted by the drafting party….
Id. Consideration of these factors here compels the conclusion that the formation of
Epic’s arbitration contract is procedurally unconscionable.
The Supreme Court recognized decades ago the basic fact of the inequality of
bargaining power between an employee and employer. Brooklyn Sav. Bank v.
O’Neil, 324 U.S. 697, 707 fn.18 (1945). Here, a multi-billion dollar corporation
imposed a one-sided arbitration contract upon its employees; this power imbalance
must factor into the court’s unconscionability analysis.
In addition to the inherent power imbalance between any employee and
employer, Epic imposed this contract upon its employees without providing them
any opportunity to gather more information about the contents of the contract,
16

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 17 of 44

misled employees about their rights under the contract, and disseminated
inaccurate information about the other wage and hour litigation filed against Epic.
These factors, reviewed collectively, demonstrate that the procedural
unconscionability of this contract is fatal.
1.

Epic Used its Superior Bargaining Power to Subject Plaintiff to the
Arbitration Contract Without Any Opportunity to Reject It

In Wisconsin, arbitration contracts are “adhesion” contracts where the
drafting party presents them on a take-it-or-leave-it basis with no opportunity to
opt out of or negotiate the contract’s terms. Coady v. Cross Country Bank, 2007 WI
App 26, ¶ 35, 299 Wis. 2d 420, 729 N.W.2d 732. Courts have recognized that this
take-it-or leave-it tactic evidences procedural unconscionability because it exploits
the disparity in bargaining power between contracting parties. Id. (citing Jones,
2006 WI 53, ¶¶ 52-53). See also Hankee v. Menard, Inc., 2002 WL 32357167, *4
(W.D. Wis. Apr. 15, 2002) (internal citation omitted) (evidence that an agreement
resulted from the use of overwhelming economic power suggests it was a product of
unequal bargaining power, not a meeting of the minds.)
The coercive means by which Epic disseminated the arbitration contract
thwarted any “real and voluntary meeting of the minds” between the contracting
parties. See Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶¶ 53, 57. Epic presented employees with a
misleading email claiming arbitration allows them to pursue claims as if they were
in court (although they cannot), and that if they had questions they could seek
additional information (although those requesting such information did not receive
it). (See Rogers Dec.)
17

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 18 of 44

But according to the language of the contract, employees were subject to its
terms the moment it was sent—as such, it is not even clear that quitting their jobs
would allow employees to effectively reject the contract’s terms. That is, unlike
Hankee, Epic’s contract does not even permit employees the choice of rejecting it
(and then seeking other employment). See Hankee, 2002 WL 32357167 *4.6 Thus,
employees were powerless to escape the terms of their presumptive abandonment of
their right to bring wage claims in court.
Under these circumstances, Plaintiff and the other TWs’ “acceptance” of the
contract cannot be considered “real and voluntary”—they had no meaningful choice
whatsoever. Because employees had no option to reject the contract, and were
unable to obtain more information about the contract despite Epic’s representation
that they could do so,7 the contract is procedurally unconscionable. See Brennan v.
Bally Total Fitness, 153 F. Supp. 2d 408, 416 (S.D.N.Y 2001) (no “meaningful
choice” to voluntarily assent to arbitration where employees had only a few minutes
to read the 14-page document while employer talked on the phone).

Epic Misled Technical Writers Regarding the Current Wage
Litigation it Faced and Regarding Their Rights under the
Arbitration Contract

Most Epic employees are also subject to a non-compete agreement (Marc Eisen, Epic Systems backs
down on noncompete clause, Isthmus, Dec. 2, 2014, http://www.isthmus.com/news/news/epic6

systems-backs-down-on-noncompete-clause/.), which would further limit their ability to seek other
employment even if it was clear from the arbitration contract that quitting was required to escape its
terms, furthering the imbalance between the bargaining parties.
7 Plaintiff attempted to gather information from Epic to determine whether a meaningful process
was in place that would have permitted TWs to obtain more information about the arbitration
contract, but Epic refused to produce responsive documents and the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion
to compel this information. (Snapp Dec.; Court’s Order on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel.) Plaintiff has
the sworn statements of two individuals who were not given the opportunity to gather more
information, despite being promised this opportunity by Epic’s email. (Campell Dec.; Rogers Dec.)

18

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 19 of 44

The timing of the arbitration contract during a pending class wage and hour
case, and Epic’s misleading statements to employees about that litigation, further
highlight that the contract to arbitrate does not manifest a “real and voluntary
meeting of the minds.” See Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶ 57. The April 2, 2014 email
enclosing the arbitration contract, which Epic sent in the midst of defending a
misclassification class action, mischaracterized both the nature of that suit and the
nature of the arbitration available under the contract.
First, the email stated that the Nordgren suit involving QAs is “claiming that
some of our salaried professionals should be re-classified as hourly employees.”
(Arbitration Email.) In fact, Nordgren claimed that Epic misclassified QAs as
overtime-exempt and owed them wages for the hours over 40 that they worked. This
claim, of course, does not require that QAs become hourly employees. Rather, Epic
appears to have framed the Nordgren suit in this way to suggest that the QA
litigation sought to degrade Epic’s employees.8
Second, Epic’s email claimed that “[a]rbitration will allow you to pursue your
individual claims as if you were in court.” This statement is both false and
misleading, as the arbitration contract proscribes class actions —a right which Epic
employees have in court. Nor does Epic explain the procedural aspects of litigation
that its arbitration contract foreclosed. For example, the arbitration contract
limited employees to a single interrogatory in discovery. A non-attorney could not be

Plaintiff attempted to depose Erik Phelps, the individual who wrote this email, in part to determine
whether this description of the Nordgren suit was intentionally misleading; Epic refused to produce
Phelps for a deposition. (Parsons Dec. Ex. A, Defendant’s Answers to Plaintiff’s First Set of
Interrogatories, Answer to Interrogatory No. 2; Snapp Dec.)
8

19

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 20 of 44

expected to recognize or understand the importance of distinctions such as these.
Perhaps these misleading statements would have been less harmful had
Epic’s employees been able to get more information concerning the arbitration
contract. Epic, however, misled employees about their ability to ask questions about
the contract before assenting. As opt-ins Campbell and Rogers have stated, despite
asking specific questions about the contract (Rogers Dec. at ¶ 6) and not responding
under the belief that someone from Epic would talk with her about the contract
(Campbell Dec. at ¶ 5), Epic did not follow up with its employees or provide the
opportunity for further discussions about arbitration.
Such conduct demonstrates Epic’s failure to provide the meaningful choice
necessary for procedural conscionability and the contracting parties’ failure to reach
a meeting of the minds. See Geiger v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, Inc., 134
F.Supp.2d 985, 998 (S.D. Ind. 2001) (“[I]n affording…an opportunity to receive
answers to any questions that applicants might have about the agreement, we do
not think that the Defendants can thereafter fairly rely on a presumption that the
applicant has understood the agreement’s provisions.”).
3.

Epic Failed to Disclose to Technical Writers that They May Have
Had Pending Claims

Epic did not disclose that TWs may have had wage claims before imposing
the arbitration contract on them and preventing them from being able to bring
those claims in court as a class.9 Under Wisconsin contract law, “[n]on-disclosure
can form the basis for a misrepresentation sufficient to allow the avoidance of a
Plaintiff’s requests for discovery as to whether Epic performed any sort of review of its potential
liability following the Nordgren suit was also rejected. (Snapp Dec.)

303 (Tent. Draft No. 11, 1976)). Courts have applied this principle to putative class
members who have no way of knowing that, “by failing to reject the arbitration
clause, they were forfeiting their rights as potential plaintiffs in [the litigation].” In
re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, 361 F. Supp. 2d 237, 251 (S.D.N.Y
2005). Under such circumstances, courts have found unconscionability where “a
non-drafting party has no way of knowing a material fact.” Id. (citing Mobile Elec.
Service, Inc. v. FirsTel, Inc., 649 N.W.2d 603, 606 (S.D. 2002)); Johnson v. Rapid

other…overreaching conduct.”); Ryan v. Weiner, 610 A.2d 1377, 1382 (Del. Ch.
1992).
4.

The Dissemination of the Contract Was Marked by Other Factors of
Procedural Unconscionability

As discussed above, the contract is not the product of a real and voluntary
meeting of the minds but of an exertion of superior bargaining power that acted to
mislead employees about their rights and to stymie any meaningful choice they had
to reject the arbitration contract. Nearly all of the other factors that courts consider
in the procedural unconscionability analysis further underscore this reality. For
example, Epic possessed significantly more business acumen and experience than
employees; Epic unilaterally drafted the contract; Epic permitted no alterations to
the contract’s non-negotiable terms; and, most significantly, as discussed above,
21

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 22 of 44

Epic provided no opportunity for employees to gain understanding of the contract’s
terms and no method by which employees could signal their (albeit futile)
disagreement with the terms. (See, e.g., Rogers Dec. at ¶ 6 (questions Rogers asked
pertaining to the arbitration agreement that went unanswered).)
In sum, while any one of the factors discussed above may not alone show
procedural unconscionability, that they all played a role in the formation of this
contract compels the conclusion that it is highly procedurally unconscionable. Epic
misled its employees through false statements and concealment of significant facts,
using its heavy weight to foreclose any opportunity for employees to understand or
reject the contract’s terms. Epic cannot pretend arbitration is a magic word that
sanctions such conduct: “Federal law favoring arbitration is not a license to tilt the
arbitration process in favor of the party with more bargaining power.” Chavarria v.
Ralphs Grocery Co., 733 F.3d 916, 927 (9th Cir. 2013).
B.

The Contract Is So One-Sided As to Be Substantively Unconscionable

Wisconsin law does not articulate any precise definition of substantive
unconscionability; rather, the concept refers to whether a contract’s terms are
“unreasonably favorable to the more powerful party.” Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶ 36. As
such, the focus of the substantive unconscionability analysis is the “one-sidedness,
unfairness, unreasonableness, harshness, overreaching, or oppressiveness of the
provision at issue.” Id. at ¶ 59. Under this standard, Epic’s arbitration contract
manifests substantive unconscionability because the scope of its “covered claims” is
limited to claims—whether asserted or unasserted—that employees, not Epic,

22

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 23 of 44

would bring. Specifically, under the arbitration contract, only claims pertaining to
wages and hours (such as for underpayment of wages, misclassification as overtime
exempt, or off-the-clock uncompensated work) are subject to mandatory arbitration.
In contrast, Epic’s ability to sue in court remains essentially unbridled. For
example, should Epic ever choose to bring a claim against a former employee
relating to its strict non-compete agreement, Epic would be free to do so in court.
Marc Eisen, Epic Systems backs down on noncompete clause, Isthmus, Dec. 2, 2014,
http://www.isthmus.com/news/news/epic-systems-backs-down-on-noncompeteclause/. While in theory Epic must arbitrate an “overpayment” claim, Epic has
never to date made such a claim against an employee. (Parsons Dec. Ex. A,
Defendant’s Answers to Plaintiff’s First Set of Interrogatories, Answer to
Interrogatory No. 11.) The severe asymmetry of this contract renders it
unreasonably favorable to Epic.
Courts have rejected such one-sided contracts as substantively
unconscionable. For example, the Wisconsin Supreme Court observed that the
“doctrine of substantive unconscionability limits the extent to which a stronger
party to a contract may impose arbitration on the weaker party without accepting
the arbitration forum for itself.” Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶ 66. This degree of onesidedness alone rendered the arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable.
Id. at ¶ 68 (citing, among other cases, Iberia Credit Bureau, Inc. v. Cingular
Wireless LLC, 379 F.3d 159, 169 (5th Cir. 2004) (arbitration provision requiring any
claim customers are likely to bring be raised in arbitration while allowing drafter to

23

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 24 of 44

raise its claims against customers in court unconscionable); Ferguson v.
Countrywide Credit Indus., Inc., 298 F.3d 778, 784–86 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding
unconscionable under California law employment contract compelling arbitration of
claims employees are most likely to bring against employer, but not claims
employer is most likely to bring against employee); Taylor v. Butler, 142 S.W.3d
277, 286 (Tenn. 2004) (arbitration provision that provides “a judicial forum for
practically all claims” that drafter could have against purchaser but assigning any
claims by the purchaser to arbitration unconscionable).
The principle underlying these cases is that arbitration contracts restricting,
either explicitly or in practice, their application to the weaker party’s claims are
impermissibly one-sided. Epic’s arbitration contract explicitly limits its covered
claims to any asserted or unasserted wage and hour violations. The very real effect
of this definition is to restrict only its employees to arbitration, while Epic is free to
bring its claims in whatever venue it pleases, rendering the contract impermissibly
one-sided and substantively unconscionable. See Jones, 2006 WI 53, ¶ 66.
The substantive and procedural unconscionability of the arbitration contract
are fatal. This contract unreasonably favors an employer with superior bargaining
power, who has not only imposed a contract that limits its employees to arbitration
while preserving the option to go to court itself, but also imposed that contract while
misleading its employees as to its contents and denying them any meaningful
chance to become better informed or even weigh their options.
II.

THE PURPORTED CONTRACT LACKS CONSIDERATION AND
THEREFORE NO VALID CONTRACT TO ARBITRATE EXISTS
24

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 25 of 44

A.

Arbitration Contracts that Are Subject to Unilateral Modification or
Revocation Are Illusory and Therefore Lack Consideration

The one-sidedness of the arbitration contract speaks not only to substantive
unconscionability, but also of a more fundamental failure: because Epic has actually
promised nothing in return for Plaintiff’s “agreement” to arbitrate, the purported
contract lacks consideration. Specifically, under the arbitration contract, Epic
retains the unfettered, unilateral right to alter or abandon it. This reservation
means, in effect, Epic has given up nothing at all in forming the contract, and thus
it is not supported by consideration. Therefore, no valid contract to arbitrate exists.

See Michalski v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 177 F.3d 634, 636 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing
NBZ, Inc. v. Pilarski, 185 Wis. 2d 827, 520 N.W.2d 93, 96 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994));
Gibson, 121 F.3d at 1131.
As with the unconscionability analysis, courts apply state law to determine if
a contract is supported by consideration. Id. at 1130. The FAA’s presumption in
favor of arbitration does not apply “when deciding whether there is an agreement to
arbitrate in the first instance.” Druco, 765 F.3d at 781. See also Kaplan, 514 U.S. at
944-45. Accordingly, ambiguities surrounding the formation of the contract—
including the question of consideration—are not resolved in favor of arbitration.
Druco, 765 F.3d at 781. (citing MPACT Constr. Group, LLC v. Superior Concrete
Constructors, Inc., 802 N.E.2d 901, 906-07 (Ind. 2004) (“a court must determine
under applicable state law whether the parties generally agreed to arbitrate
disputes, without being influenced by the federal policy in favor of arbitration.”).

25

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 26 of 44

Under Wisconsin law, a valid contract requires consideration. Michalski, 177
F.3d at 636 (citing Pilarski, 520 N.W.2d at 96). This principle applies to contracts
between an employer and employee. See Pilarski, 520 N.W.2d at 96 (1994). In
essence, consideration is evidence of the intent to be bound to the contract. Id.
(citing 1 ARTHUR LINTON CORBIN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS §§ 11, 112
(1963)) (emphasis added). Accordingly, to determine if a contract is supported by
consideration, courts look beyond the employer’s purported pledge to be bound by
the terms of a contract to discern whether the employer actually intends to be so
bound. Epic’s modifications and amendments clause means it clearly does not
intend to be bound, and as such, this contract fails.
1.

Wisconsin Precedent States that If the Contract Does Not
Constrain the Promisor in Any Way, the Promise Is Illusory

Where an employer does not actually intend to be bound by a contract, the
employer has in reality furnished only “an illusory promise.” DeBruin v. St. Patrick
Congregation, 2012 WI 94, ¶ 40, 343 Wis. 2d 83, 816 N.W.2d 878 (internal citations
omitted) (Crooks, J., concurring). Wisconsin law defines an illusory promise as one
which does not constrain the alleged promisor to the contract’s terms by virtue of
the “promisor’s” retention of the option to perform the contract’s terms. See Devine
v. Notter, 2008 WI App 87, ¶ 4, 312 Wis. 2d 521, 753 N.W.2d 557. In other words,
“even if a present intention is manifested, the reservation of an option to change

that intention means that there can be no promise who is justified in an expectation
of performance.” DeBruin, 2012 WI 94, ¶ 45 (quoting Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 2 cmt. e (1981) (emphasis added)). In contrast, “the fundamental
26

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 27 of 44

element” of an actual promise is the “promisor’s expression of intention that the
promisor’s future conduct shall be in accord with the present expression….” Id.
(quoting Joseph M. Perillo, Corbin on Contracts § 1.17, at 47 (rev. ed.1993)
(emphasis added)).
By the explicit terms of the arbitration contract, Epic retains the unfettered
right to alter or abandon it. Specifically, the “Modifications and Amendments”
provision vests in Epic the unilateral and unlimited power to “change or terminate
this agreement after giving [employees] 90 days written or electronic notice. Any
change or termination will not apply to a pending claim.” (Arbitration Contract.)
Epic’s purported promise to arbitrate wage claims is an illusory promise
under Wisconsin law. On April 2, 2014, Epic ostensibly promised to arbitrate its
wage claims according to the terms of the contract. But the same contract provided
Epic the option to change that promise in the future. Unlike an actual promise (i.e.,
one that commits the promisor’s future conduct to its present intention), Epic’s
future conduct may not be in accord with its present expression—its promise to
arbitrate is therefore illusory. See DeBruin, 2012 WI 94, ¶ 45.
2.

An Illusory Promise is Fatal to Forming a Contract to Arbitrate
because Illusory Promises Do Not Provide Consideration

A lack of consideration necessarily follows from the lack of intent to be
unequivocally bound by the contract’s terms. Wisconsin law is clear:
‘If a party to a purported contract has, in fact, made only
illusory promises and therefore not constrained him- or
herself in any way, he or she has given no consideration
and therefore no contract exists.’

27

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 28 of 44

DeBruin, 2012 WI 94, ¶40 (citing Devine, 2008 WI App 87, ¶ 4, for the proposition
that “since the maker of an illusory promise assumes no detriment or obligation, an
illusory promise is not regarded as consideration”).
In the arbitration context, an employer’s actual promise to arbitrate its
claims given in exchange for an employee’s agreement to the same constitutes
consideration. Tinder v. Pinkerton Security, 305 F. 3d 728, 734 (7th Cir. 2002)
(citing Michalski, 177 F.3d at 636). But as discussed in detail below, where the
employer retains for itself the explicit and exclusive option to modify the contract or
terminate it altogether—precisely as Epic does here—courts have recognized that
the “promise” to arbitrate is illusory. An illusory promise lacks consideration and is
therefore not a valid contract. Michalski, 177 F.3d at 636.
For example, the Seventh Circuit recently reviewed the validity of arbitration
clauses under which franchisees were required to arbitrate their claims against the
franchisor Steak ‘n Shake, but Steak ‘n Shake had the unilateral and unrestricted
right to amend, modify, or terminate the arbitration agreement. Applying Indiana
law, the Seventh Circuit articulated:
An illusory promise is a promise which by its terms
makes performance entirely optional with the promisor.”
Pardieck v. Pardieck, 676 N.E.2d 359, 364 n. 3
(Ind.App.1997). See also Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 2 cmt. e (1981)…. Under that standard, the
district court correctly found that the franchise
agreements’ arbitration clauses were illusory because
performance was “entirely optional” with Steak ‘n Shake.
Druco, 765 F.3d at 782 (Rovner, J); see also Floss v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses,
Inc., 211 F.3d 306, 315-16 (6th Cir. 2000) (applying Tennessee and Kentucky law);
28

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 29 of 44

Penn, 269 F.3d 753 (applying Indiana law); Geiger, 134 F. Supp. 2d 985, 1000 (S.D.
Ind. 2001) (“[w]here a promisor retains an unlimited right to decide later the nature
or extent of his performance, the promise is too indefinite for legal enforcement. The
unlimited choice in effect destroys the promise and makes it merely illusory.”).
An employer’s “promise” to arbitrate employment-related claims with its
employees is illusory where the employer reserves the right to amend, supplement,
or revise the arbitration contract. See, e.g., Dumais v. American Golf Corp., 299
F.3d 1216, 1219 (10th Cir. 2002) ( “join[ing] other circuits in holding that an
arbitration agreement allowing one party the unfettered right to alter the
arbitration agreement’s existence or its scope is illusory” and rejecting the
employer’s “contention that the strong presumption favoring arbitration requires
[it] to ignore the contract’s illusory nature” because the presumption “disappears
when the parties dispute the existence of a valid arbitration agreement”); J.M.
Davidson Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W. 3d 223, 230 n. 2 (Tex. 2003) (agreeing with and
noting that “most courts that have considered this issue have held that if a party
retains the unilateral, unrestricted right to terminate the arbitration agreement, it
is illusory”).
By reserving for itself the right to revise the terms of this contract at any
time, Epic has effectively devised a trap door out of the arbitration contract. If Epic
had an unfiled claim against an employee that it wished to bring in court rather
than in arbitration, Epic could simply give notice that it was changing the contract,
and then file the accrued claim in court. TWs have no such option to escape from

29

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 30 of 44

under the arbitration contract at their whim. As a result, Epic has not truly given
up anything in making this contract, though its employees undoubtedly have.
Under Wisconsin contract law, because Epic “has, in fact, made only illusory
promises and therefore not constrained [itself] in any way,” Epic has “given no
consideration and therefore no contract exists.” DeBruin, 2012 WI 94, ¶ 43.
B.

The Notice Provision Does Not Alter the Conclusion that Epic’s
Promise Is Illusory

Furthermore, courts have recognized that including a notice provision where
a party has retained the exclusive right to modify or terminate a “mutual”
agreement does not cure the illusory nature of that promise. For example, the Fifth
Circuit declared illusory an arbitration clause that did not preclude “application of
amendments to disputes which arose (or of which Amway had notice) before the
amendment,” even though the contract required Amway to provide notice of such
amendments. Morrison v. Amway Corp., 517 F.3d 248, 257 (5th Cir. 2008); see also
Carey v. 24 Hour Fitness, 669 F.3d 202, 207 (5th Cir. 2012). These holdings are
consistent with the definition of an illusory promise: by notifying employees of
changes in the terms of an agreement to which the employees are bound, an
employer has in no way constrained its option to implement such changes at any
time. Rather, the employer simply openly exercised the very option that it retained
for itself in the first place.
Accordingly, Epic cannot point to superficial constraints such as notice and
exemption of filed claims to transform its illusory promise into one supported by

30

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 31 of 44

consideration.10 By providing employees 90 days’ notice of Epic’s intent to
amend/terminate the contract, Epic has in no way constrained itself from changing
the terms of the contract. See Morrison, 517 F.3d at 254; Carey, 669 F.3d at 207.
Indeed, Epic’s modifications clause permits it to change the contract so it need not
provide any notice at all. See Keanini v. United Healthcare Services, Inc., 33 F.
Supp. 3d 1191, 1198-99 (D. Hawai’i 2014).
Moreover, several courts have recently held that contracts to arbitrate are
illusory if they allow employers to amend terms that would govern claims which
either had already accrued or which the employer already knew about at the time of
amendment. For example, the New Mexico District Court rejected as illusory an
arbitration contract that reserved the employer’s right to unilaterally amend the
contract “after [an employee’s] claim has accrued, but before arbitration proceedings
are initiated.” Flemma v. Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., 303 P. 3d 814, 822
(N.M. 2013) (emphasis in original); see also Keanini, 33 F. Supp. 3d at 1194-97
(rejecting an arbitration contract as illusory based on a provision reserving the
employer’s right to amend, modify, or terminate the arbitration contract with 30
days’ notice, but without exempting from such amendment any claims accrued or
known to the employer at the time of amendment); Phox v. Atriums Management
Co., 230 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1283 (D. Kan. 2002) (arbitration provision that gave the

Epic’s vague qualifications actually give rise to numerous ambiguities: Must Epic provide 90 days’
notice of the modification itself, or merely that it intends to make a unilateral change? Does the
modification or termination become effective 90 days from the notice, or some other time? Relatedly,
when and how may an employee assent to or reject such modifications? That the contract cannot
even answer these questions underscores the meaninglessness of these provisions in determining
whether Epic’s promise was illusory.
10

31

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 32 of 44

employer “the unilateral right to revise or cancel the arbitration clause before
plaintiff filed a claim” was illusory); Peleg v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 204 Cal.
App. 4th 1425, 1432-33 (2012) (arbitration provision that required 30 days’ notice
and was inapplicable to filed claims was nevertheless illusory because such changes
would still apply to accrued claims). This well-reasoned line of cases simply upholds
the long-standing and irrefutable contract principles behind illusory promises. That
is, if an employer can unilaterally modify or terminate contractual terms pertaining
to accrued claims, the employer’s purported promise to arbitrate such claims
according to the presently stated terms is illusory.11
III.

THE CONTRACT’S CLASS ACTION WAIVER VIOLATES PLAINTIFF’S
SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS GUARANTEED UNDER THE NATIONAL
LABOR RELATIONS ACT

Epic’s wage claim arbitration contract contains a class and collective action
waiver that strips Plaintiff and all TWs of their “core substantive right” under the
National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) to engage in collective legal action. See In re
D.R. Horton, Inc., 357 NLRB No. 184 (2012), 2012 WL 36274, *12. As such, under
the NLRA’s plain language and under this Court’s germane analysis in Herrington
v. Watersone Mortg. Corp., 2012 WL 1242318 (W.D. Wis. March 16, 2012)
(“Herrington I”), Epic’s attempt to force employees to waive joint, class, and
Epic claims that Tinder v. Pinkerton Security, 2000 WL 34237496 (W.D. Wis., Sep. 25, 2000), aff’d
305 F. 3d 728 (7th Cir. 2002) is instructive, but the circumstances of this arbitration contract differ
from those in Pinkerton. The plaintiff in Pinkerton received a brochure detailing Pinkerton’s
“Arbitration Program” one year into her employment. The brochure stated that Pinkerton was also
bound by the arbitration provisions; it nowhere qualified that promise with Pinkerton’s right to
change the terms of the arbitration program. This Court rejected plaintiff’s argument that an
employment manual stating Pinkerton could change its policies at any time rendered Pinkerton’s
agreement to arbitrate illusory. Unlike Pinkerton, here Epic has reserved its right to alter the
arbitration contract within the contract itself, making this case more akin to Flemma or Keanini
than Pinkerton.

collective action cannot stand. In fact, both this Court and the National Labor
Relations Board (“NLRB”) have recently reaffirmed their holding that mandatory
class action waivers in arbitration contracts violate employees’ substantive
statutory right under the NLRA. See Herrington v. Waterstone Mortg. Corp., 993 F.
Supp. 2d 940 (2014) (“Herrington II”); AT&T Mobility Servs., LLC & Eudora
Brooks, an Individual AT&T Mobility Servs., LLC & Juan Figuereo, an Individual,
22-CA-127746, 2015 WL 3955133 (June 26, 2015)12; Murphy Oil USA, Inc., 361
NLRB No. 72, 2014 WL 5465454 (Oct. 28, 2014). Accordingly, Epic’s class waiver
provision is unenforceable. See Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 U.S. 72, 83-84
(1982); J.I. Case v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 332, 337 (courts may not enforce individual
employment contract provisions that violate the NLRA). Epic urges this Court to
reconsider its decisions in Herrington, but the reasoning of those decisions is sound
and clearly applicable to the instant case.
Courts give considerable deference to the NLRB’s interpretations of the
NLRA. Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 943 (citing ABF Freight System, Inc. v.
NLRB, 510 U.S. 317, 324 (1994)). As such, this Court recognized that courts must
defer to the NLRB’s determination that employers violate the NLRA by subjecting
employees to arbitration contracts that deprive them of their federal right to bring
joint, class, or collective FLSA actions in judicial or arbitral forums. Herrington II,

NLRB ALJ Mindy E. Landow released its decision in AT&T Mobility on June 26, 2015, again
reaffirming the NLRB’s decision in D.R. Horton and Murphy Oil. Importantly, the arbitration
agreement at issue in AT&T Mobility was voluntary rather than mandatory; however, ALJ Landow
still found that the agreement implicated Section 7 rights under the NLRA. ALJ Landow also noted
that “the purported ‘voluntary’ nature of any employee’s decision as to whether to abide by such a
policy, promulgated and endorsed by their employer, is open to question.” Id. at 8:15-17.

993 F. Supp. 2d at 943 (citations omitted).
A.

Section 7 of the NLRA Guarantees Employees the Substantive Federal
Right to Collectively Pursue Wage Claims

Under Section 7 of the NLRA, “[e]mployees shall have the right to...engage in
...concerted activities for the purpose of...mutual aid or protection.” 29 U.S.C. § 157
(emphasis added). The language of Section 7 is construed broadly so as not to
“frustrate the policy of the [NLRA] to protect the right of workers to act together to
better their working conditions.” Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556, 565-66 (1978)
(quoting NLRB v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 14 (1962)).
Both courts and the NLRB recognize that the pursuit of claims on a joint,
class, or collective action basis constitutes protected concerted activity under
Section 7. See, e.g., Brady v. Nat’l Football League, 644 F.3d 661, 673 (8th Cir.
2011) (“a lawsuit filed in good faith by a group of employees to achieve more
favorable terms or conditions of employment is ‘concerted activity’ under § 7 of the
[NLRA]”); Trinity Trucking & Materials Corp., 221 NLRB 364, 365 (1975) (“filing of
the civil action by a group of employees is protected activity”), enf’d NLRB v. Trinity
Trucking & Materials Corp., 567 F.2d 391 (7th Cir. 1977) (mem. disp.), cert. denied,
438 U.S. 914 (1978); Eastex, 437 U.S. at 565-66; D.R. Horton, 2012 WL 36274 at *12
(the longstanding “right to engage in collective action—including collective legal
action—is the core substantive right protected by the NLRA and is the foundation
on which the [NLRA] and Federal labor policy rest.”) (emphasis in original).
In Herrington II, this Court reaffirmed its agreement with the NLRB’s
foundational reasoning regarding the Section 7 right to bring wage claims on a class
34

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 35 of 44

basis. Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 943. Thus, Section 7 provides Plaintiff and
the opt-ins to this case the substantive federal right to pursue their common claims
for unpaid overtime wages on a concerted basis. As discussed in detail below, Epic
violated this substantive federal right by imposing on its employees an arbitration
contract that strips them of the ability to assert their claims collectively.
B.

An Employer Violates the NLRA by Subjecting Employees to a
Contract that Prohibits Collective Actions

An employer-mandated arbitration contract that deprives employees of the
Section 7 right to pursue their claims on a class or collective basis violates Section
8(a)(1) of the NLRA, which explicitly provides that employers may not “interfere
with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in
section 157….” 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1). Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 943.
Interpreting these provisions in tandem, the NLRB has held that
[j]ust as the substantive right to engage in concerted
activity aimed at improving wages, hours or working
conditions through litigation or arbitration lies at the core
of the rights protected by Section 7, the prohibition of
individual agreements imposed on employees as a means
of requiring that they waive their right to engage in
protected, concerted activity lies at the core of the
prohibitions contained in Section 8.
D.R. Horton, 2012 WL 36274 at *7. The bottom line is that where an employer
imposes a contract that “explicitly restricts activities protected by Section 7,” the
employer necessarily interferes with, restrains, or coerces employees in the exercise
of Section 7 rights. Lutheran Heritage Village-Livonia, 343 NLRB 646 (2004), 2004
WL 2678632, *1 (emphasis in original).

35

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 36 of 44

Both Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit precedent also compel the
conclusion that an employer’s prohibition on employees’ pursuit of wage claims on a
class-wide basis also violates the NLRA. As the NLRB recognized in Murphy Oil:
Because mandatory arbitration agreements like those
involved in D. R. Horton purport to extinguish a
substantive right to engage in concerted activity under
the NLRA, they are invalid. The Supreme Court has
explained recently that the Federal policy favoring
arbitration, however liberal, does have limits. It does not
permit a “prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue
statutory remedies,” such as a “provision in an arbitration
agreement forbidding the assertion of certain statutory
rights.” Insofar as an arbitration agreement prevents
employees from exercising their Section 7 right to pursue
legal claims concertedly—by, as here, precluding them
from filing joint, class, or collective claims addressing
their working conditions in any forum, arbitral or
judicial—the arbitration agreement amounts to a
prospective waiver of a right guaranteed by the NLRA.
Murphy Oil, 2014 WL 5465454 at *11. See also D.R. Horton, 2012 WL 36274 at *6
(quoting J. I. Case Co., 321 U.S. at 337) (“individual contracts no matter what the
circumstances that justify their execution or what their terms, may not be availed of
to defeat or delay the procedures prescribed by the [NLRA].”).
Epic’s arbitration contract unquestionably violates the NLRA because it
prohibits employees from exercising their right to pursue their wage claims on a
concerted basis. Epic cannot escape liability for its violation of Section 7 and 8(a)(1)
by fashioning its restraint on an employee’s guaranteed federal rights as an
arbitration contract. Sections 7 and 8(a)(1) draw an indelible line that protects
employees’ rights to engage in concerted activity, and concerted activity includes
pursuing legal claims on a class or collective basis. D.R. Horton, 2012 WL 36274 at
36

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 37 of 44

*12; Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 943. Epic’s class and collective action
prohibition runs afoul of the plain language of the NLRA, the NLRB’s longstanding
interpretation of it (which is entitled to judicial deference), and precedent from this
Court, from the Seventh Circuit and the Supreme Court.
C.

As this Court Recognized in Herrington II, the Fifth Circuit’s Reversal
of the NLRB’s Decision in D.R. Horton Is Inapposite and Unpersuasive

Although the facts before the Court now fall squarely under this Court’s
analysis in Herrington II, Epic tells the Court that the decision “should not affect its
ruling here,” largely because other non-precedential courts have followed the Fifth
Circuit’s rejection of D.R. Horton. (Def. Br. at 10). But this Court explicitly
repudiated the Fifth Circuit’s purported reasons for overturning D.R. Horton.
First, this Court rightly rejected the Fifth Circuit’s unfounded suggestion
that a substantive federal right was not at issue, reiterating that the Section 7 right
to engage in collective legal action (by invoking Rule 23 or Section 216(b)) is the core

substantive right protected by the NLRA. Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 944
(citing D.R. Horton, 2012 WL 36274, at *12 (internal citations omitted)).
Second, this Court noted that the NLRA does not explicitly override the FAA
because such explicit language is unnecessary given the well-established principle
that an arbitration agreement simply may not require a party to waive a
substantive federal right. Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 944.
Similarly, this Court found the question of whether the NLRA provides a
private cause of action irrelevant. Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 944 (citing D.R.
Horton, 737 F.3d at 360, n. 9). Again, in D.R. Horton, Herrington, and the present
37

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 38 of 44

case, the fundamental fact is that an arbitration contract with a no-class provision
deprives employees of their substantive federal right under the plain language of
the NLRA. Because courts may not enforce contracts that violate the NLRA, it is
irrelevant that the employee’s cause of action rests on the FLSA. Herrington II, 993
F. Supp. 2d at 944-45 (citing Kaiser Steel Corp., 455 U.S. at 86; Jasso v. Money
Mart Express, Inc., 879 F. Supp. 2d 1038, 1047 (N.D. Cal. 2012)).
Finally, this Court corrected the Fifth Circuit’s inaccurate assertion that
“[e]very one of our sister circuits to consider the issue has either suggested or
expressly…held arbitration agreements containing class waivers enforceable.”
Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 946 (internal citations omitted). In fact, the Ninth
Circuit amended its opinion to find only that the plaintiff forfeited the argument;
the Second Circuit did not explain its failure to defer to the NLRB; and the Eighth
Circuit improperly permitted an employer to determine on its own which concerted
activities are “protected” (i.e., those brought to the DOL) and which are not (i.e.,
those that would be brought in arbitration or court).13
D.

There is No Actual Conflict Between the FAA and the NLRA

In D.R. Horton, the NLRB held that its rejection of a class waiver in an
arbitration agreement neither conflicts with the FAA nor undermines proarbitration policy. D.R. Horton, 2012 WL 36274 at *10. In overturning the NLRB’s
decision, the Fifth Circuit summarily asserted the FAA as grounds for reversing the

Epic’s arbitration contract engages a similar attempt to distract from the fact that it waives a
substantive federal right by citing that employees remain free to bring their claims to the DOL. As
this Court has made clear, however, it is not up to Epic to decide where its employees may exercise
the rights guaranteed to them by Section 7 of the NLRA.
13

38

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 39 of 44

NLRB and improperly held that D.R. Horton is inconsistent with the Supreme
Court’s reasoning in Concepcion. See D.R. Horton, 737 F.3d at 359-60 (citing
Concepcion, 131 S.Ct. at 1746-52). See also Owen v. Bristol Care, Inc., 702 F.3d
1050, 1054 (8th Cir. 2013). Although this Court found that the Fifth Circuit made
some “valid points” with respect to its reliance on Concepcion, it solidly reaffirmed
the distinction between Concepcion, which did not involve the waiver of a
substantive federal right, and the issue of whether concerted action waivers violate
the NLRA. See Herrington II, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 945.
Indeed, this distinction is critical because an entirely different analysis
applies where two federal statutes allegedly conflict (as is the case here), as opposed
to where the FAA allegedly preempts a state law (as was the case in Concepcion).
Concepcion turned solely on whether the FAA preempted a state law “conditioning
the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on the availability of classwide
arbitration procedures.” Concepcion, 131 S.Ct. at 1744. But in this case, preemption
principles are inapposite. Even if in direct conflict, one federal statute cannot
preempt another—the FAA cannot preempt the NLRA. See Baker v. IBP, Inc., 357
F.3d 685, 688 (7th Cir. 2004). Instead, whether two federal statutes conflict depends
on whether Congress intended to repeal part or all of the previously enacted statute
(here, the NLRA) by enacting the subsequent, allegedly inconsistent statute (here,
the FAA). Id. And, even when two federal laws cover the same subject, courts must
give effect to both if possible. See J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Intern.,
Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 142 (2001) (“stringent” standard requires “irreconcilable

39

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 40 of 44

conflict”); AT&T Mobility, at 11; Murphy Oil, 2014 WL 5465454 at *9 (the NLRB
and courts “must carefully accommodate both the NLRA and the FAA”) (emphasis
in original).
The FAA does not implicitly repeal the NLRA, but rather explicitly maintains
that an arbitration contract is unenforceable if legal grounds exist for its revocation.
9 U.S.C. § 2. See also Murphy Oil, 2014 WL 5465454, at *7; D.R. Horton, 2012 WL
36274 at *11-12. As such, the FAA itself accommodates Sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of the
NLRA, which provide grounds for revoking arbitration contracts that interfere with
employees’ substantive federal right to pursue claims for unpaid overtime on a class
or collective basis. The policies of the FAA do not conflict with this necessary result,
but rather preserve it. Indeed,
the purpose of Congress [in enacting the FAA] was to
make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other
contracts, but not more so. To immunize an arbitration
agreement from judicial challenge [on grounds applicable
to other contracts] would be to elevate it over other forms
of contract—a situation inconsistent with the ‘saving
clause.’”
Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co, 388 U.S. 395, 404 n.12 (1967)
(emphasis added). See also Murphy Oil, 2014 WL 5465454, at *7 (observing that its
reasoning is consistent with the FAA because it “treats an arbitration agreement no
less favorably than any other private contract that conflicts with federal law”).
Thus, the FAA’s implied policy favoring enforcement of arbitration purposefully
does not cover arbitration contracts that would be void as a matter of law, as Epic’s
contract is under the plain language of the NLRA. Epic cannot rely on the FAA to

40

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 41 of 44

validate its deprivation of Plaintiff’s federal substantive right because no conflict
exists between the FAA and the NLRA.14
Consistent with the FAA’s savings clause, the Supreme Court has held that
the federal policy favoring arbitration contracts must yield where such contracts
deprive parties’ of substantive statutory rights. See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson
Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 26 (1991) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors v. Soler ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 473 U.S 614, 628 (1985) for the proposition that “‘[b]y agreeing to
arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by
the [federal] statute....’”) (emphasis added).The Supreme Court’s recent analysis in
American Exp. Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 133 S.Ct. 2304 (2013) supports this
conclusion. There, the Court affirmed that where arbitration contracts make the
exercise of statutory rights impossible by outright prohibition of the assertion of

such rights, they are invalid as “‘prospective waiver[s] of a party’s right to pursue
statutory remedies.’” Id. at 2310 (quoting Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 637 n.19
(emphasis in original)). Epic’s arbitration contract explicitly calls for the prospective
waiver of its employees’ right to pursue collective legal action guaranteed by the

Even if the NLRA and the FAA did conflict, the rights guaranteed by the NLRA are fundamental
and must take priority over the FAA’s implicit and qualified pro-arbitration policy. Federal labor
policy, as embodied in the NLRA, has expressly protected the fundamental right to engage in
concerted activity for over 80 years. See Murphy Oil, 2014 WL 5465454 at *18 (“The employer’s
imposition of a mandatory arbitration agreement requiring employees to bring all workplace claims
individually—and forbidding them access to any group procedure—reflects and perpetuates precisely
the inequality of bargaining power that the Act was intended to redress.”); see also Barrentine v.
Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 450 U.S. 728, 735 (1981). The FAA, in contrast, does not expressly call
for a “streamlined” (i.e., individual) model of arbitration. Indeed, the stated purpose of the FAA was
to put arbitration contracts “on equal footing” with any other contracts. Concepcion, 131 S.Ct. at
1745. Consistent with that goal, the FAA’s preference for arbitration is subject to the § 2 savings
clause for otherwise unenforceable contracts that deprive parties’ of substantive statutory rights (i.e.,
the substantive right under the NLRA to pursue collective legal actions). Epic simply cannot lean on
a federal policy favoring arbitration to uphold its patent violation of federal labor policy.
14

41

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 42 of 44

NLRA. See Murphy Oil, 2014 WL 5465454 at *1. As such, under a long line of
Supreme Court precedent from Mitsubishi Motors to Italian Colors and consistent
with the FAA’s savings clause, Epic’s arbitration contract is unenforceable.
In sum, Sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of the NLRA protect employees’ fundamental
and substantive federal statutory right to engage in concerted activity. Collective
legal action constitutes concerted activity. Arbitration contracts that deprive
employees of the right to pursue collective legal action thus violate the NLRA, and
cannot be enforced by courts. The FAA does not alter, but in fact preserves, this
conclusion. Applied here, these principles unequivocally establish that the class
waiver in Epic’s arbitration contract is unenforceable. According to the contract’s
own terms, this result means that “any claim brought on a class, collective, or
representative action basis must be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, and
such court shall be the exclusive forum for such claims.” (Arbitration Contract.)
Thus, this Court must reject Epic’s motion to compel arbitration and instead allow
Plaintiff to pursue his claims in this Court.
IV.

The Court, in Its Discretion, Should Notify Technical Writers of their
Potential Claims to Advance the Remedial Purposes of the FLSA
District courts “have the discretionary power to authorize the sending of

notice to potential class members in a collective action brought pursuant to § 216(b)
of the FLSA.” Hoffmann v. Sbarro Inc., 982 F. Supp. 249, 261 (citing Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U.S. 165 (1989)). Should the Court grant Epic’s motion
to compel individual arbitration, Plaintiff urges this Court to exercise its discretion
to issue notice to Epic’s TWs of their potential claims, so as to support the remedial
42

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 43 of 44

purpose of the FLSA. Without court-supervised notice, Plaintiff and opt-in plaintiffs
have no effective way to provide notice to the other TWs informing them that they
may have a claim for unpaid overtime wages under the FLSA. Given that Epic has
in the past sent misleading emails to its employees, misstating the nature of FLSA
claims, without notice TWs are unlikely to be aware of their putative claims. (See,

e.g., Arbitration Email.) Without notice, Epic will have succeeded in keeping its
other employees in the dark about their rights.
Issuing notice now will advance the interests of potential opt-in plaintiffs. In
FLSA cases, other employees do not receive the benefit of automatic tolling when a
complaint is filed; instead, each employee’s limitations period continues to run
unless and until she opts in. 29 U.S.C. § 256. With each passing day, therefore,
every potential class member suffers harm in the form of newly time-barred claims.
The most effective way to ensure that TWs are fully informed of their rights so that
they can act on a timely basis is through court-supervised notice. If other TWs opt
in, and they are determined to have enforceable arbitration contracts, then they can
pursue their claims in arbitration. But without notice of their rights, the TWs will
not have the opportunity to vindicate their rights in any forum. Thus, the Court
should order notice so that TWs will be fully and accurately informed of their rights.
CONCLUSION
Epic’s mandate that its employees must individually arbitrate their unpaid
wage claims tips the scales impermissibly and completely in Epic’s favor. The
contract is restricted to claims employees would bring against Epic, allows Epic to

43

Case: 3:15-cv-00082-bbc Document #: 42 Filed: 07/10/15 Page 44 of 44

unilaterally escape its terms, and deprives employees of their right to act
collectively. These flaws cannot be papered over by the FAA. No valid contract to
arbitrate exists in this case. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully
requests that this Court deny Epic’s motion to dismiss his class and collective
claims and compel individual arbitration.
