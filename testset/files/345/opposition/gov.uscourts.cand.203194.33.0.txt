INTRODUCTION

2

In their motion to dismiss, stay or transfer this case, Defendants rely too heavily on

3

applying a rigid, formulaic first-to-file approach that the federal courts have never agreed with.

4

See, e.g., Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183 (1952). In doing so,

5

Defendants seek to shoehorn the analysis of proper forum into a narrow first-to-file test limited to

6

three exceptions. Defendants’ Br. at 5:13-7:24. Defendants reach this result only through a

7

strained reading of the Federal Circuit’s 1993 Genentech decision and by ignoring altogether the

8

Federal Circuit’s 2008 Micron decision, which expressly rejected formulaic application of first-

9

to-file rules.

10

As the Federal Circuit held in Micron, it is wrong to apply the first-to-file rule

11

mechanically, especially in light of the “newly understood legal environment” articulated by the

12

U.S. Supreme Court in its 2007 MedImmune decision, which lowered the bar for declaratory

13

relief jurisdiction. Micron Tech., Inc. v. MOSAID Techs., Inc., 518 F.3d 897, 905 (Fed. Cir.

14

2008); see MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 764 (2007). The Federal Circuit

15

recognized that under MedImmune, potential defendants had “greater opportunity to race to the

16

courthouse” in the hope of forcing patent holders to defend their patents in deficient forums,

17

which is precisely what Defendants are trying to do here. Micron, 518 F.3d at 905.

18

To address this, the Micron decision mandates consideration of each competing forums’

19

suitability through “robust consideration” of four convenience factors:

(1) jurisdiction,

20

(2) consolidation, (3) convenience of the witnesses and parties, and (4) the interests of justice. Id.

21

In other words, to discourage litigants from racing to federal court to claim first-to-file status, and

22

the injustices and waste that would surely follow, Micron reaffirmed that a proper forum analysis

23

requires the courts to focus on the suitability and convenience of the competing forums, not the

24

actions of the parties.

25

Defendants presumably gloss over this analysis and this new legal environment because

26

their chosen forum, Maryland, presents fundamental jurisdictional and procedural issues that are

27

wholly absent in California:

DISMISS, STAY OR TRANSFER

Case 4:08-cv-02364-CW

•

This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction over the entire dispute. The
Maryland District Court, in contrast, lacks subject matter jurisdiction over both the
patent claims, because no case and controversy existed under MedImmune when
Defendants filed their declaratory judgment suit, as well as the declaratory state
law causes of action, because both diversity and federal question jurisdiction are
lacking with respect to these California state law claims.

•

Meanwhile, any argument of consolidation in Maryland is illusory as the earlier
Maryland case is based on different patents and facts and raises different legal
considerations not presented here; moreover, the earlier case is administratively
closed and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

•

The convenience of third party witnesses also weighs in favor of California.
Witnesses in California will be important to establishing California acts of
infringement and violations of California state and common law. In contrast,
Neuralstem has not identified any material third-party witnesses in Maryland.

•

Litigating in California poses no undue difficulty to Defendants, as evidenced by
Neuralstem’s initiating suit against another company in California a few months
ago.

•

16

Finally, interests of justice all weigh in favor of this Court because, among other
things, only this Court has jurisdiction over both Plaintiffs’ infringement and
California state law claims (transferring this case would presumably require
Plaintiffs to file a second suit in California state court), and the expertise to
efficiently decide these issues.

17

While the foregoing is dispositive, even if a rigid application of the first-to-file rule should

18

apply here, the declaratory Maryland action is not entitled to claim first-to-file status with respect

19

to the substance of the California action. It is undisputed that StemCells filed first in California

20

on: (1) infringement claims of the ‘418 patent against all three Defendants; (2) infringement

21

claims on the ‘505 patent against two of the three Defendants; (3) violation of California trade

22

libel laws; and (4) violation of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200. Each of

23

these causes of action invokes separate and distinct legal issues that were first-filed in California.

24

Defendants’ contention that they have the right to choose the forum based on first-to-file simply

25

does not withstand scrutiny.

For example, this Court has proper personal jurisdiction and venue over all the
parties. The Maryland District Court, in contrast, lacks personal jurisdiction and
venue over both StemCells and NeuroSpheres because both entities, having
insufficient contact with Maryland, have not consented to suit in Maryland.

Furthermore, the Maryland action as originally filed was aimed primarily at alleged

27

inequitable conduct on just the ‘505 patent and is an anticipatory bad faith suit seemingly

28

designed to harm StemCells publicly. Defendants presaged their suit, for example, through a

press release accusing StemCells of inequitable conduct – all the while admitting in that same

2

press release that StemCells had not accused Neuralstem of patent infringement on the ‘505

3

patent. MedImmune lowered the bar, but not so low as to permit declaratory complainants to

4

claim the right to choose a forum when the complainant admits no specific charge of infringement

5

has been made. Here, Neuralstem conjured up a threat of suit from the benign ‘505 patent press

6

release, filed a declaratory action against the ‘505 patent, amended that action to mirror

7

StemCells’ California action, and is now attempting to portray itself as having therefore filed first

8

in Maryland for all of the actions before this Court. As explained below, Defendants are not the

9

first to file, and having such anticipatory and bad faith actions dictate forum choice should not be

10
M C D ERMOTT W ILL & E MERY LLP

Document 33

permitted, especially given the new legal environment post-MedImmune.

11

For all these reasons, the Northern District of California is the highly favored court for

12

StemCells’ infringement and pendent California state law causes of action. StemCells therefore

13

respectfully requests that this Court deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss, transfer or stay this

14

case.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

THE COMPANIES

17

StemCells1 is a Delaware corporation located in Palo Alto, California that

18

discovers and develops stem cell therapeutics. StemCells has approximately sixty employees (all

19

located in California), has been in business since 1988 and has a broad suite of intellectual

20

property relating to the field of stem and progenitor cells, including patents covering the

21

purification, proliferation and use of human neural stem cells. StemCells has also licensed

22

intellectual property from other early players in the stem cell field, including the exclusive right,

23

title and interest to a portfolio of patents from NeuroSpheres Holding Ltd. (“NeuroSpheres”), a

24

Canadian entity located in Alberta, Canada.

25

StemCells relies upon its pioneering intellectual property to protect its proprietary

26

therapeutic drug programs, and to monetize other aspects of its technology with third parties such

27

as by entering into license agreements. This year, StemCells completed enrollment for a Phase I

2

clinical trial using neural stem cells to treat infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.

3

Neuralstem is a Delaware corporation located in Rockville, Maryland. Neuralstem was

4

formed in 1996, five years after the priority date for the patents-in-suit, and it currently has

5

approximately seven employees. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 1 at p. 11.)2 Neuralstem publicly

6

describes itself as essentially a virtual company because it outsources its research on stem cells to

7

third parties, including its collaborators at UC San Diego. (Id. at p. 19.)

10

On October 3, 2006, U.S. Patent No. 7,115,418 (the “‘418 patent”) issued to

11

NeuroSpheres with StemCells as its exclusive licensee. StemCells did not issue a press release on

12

the issuance of the ‘418 patent. On April 22, 2008, U.S. Patent No. 7,361,505 (the “‘505 patent”)

13

issued to NeuroSpheres with StemCells as its exclusive licensee. StemCells issued a press release

14

on April 23, 2008, on the issuance of the ‘505 patent. In this press release, StemCells stated:

15

‘The issuance of this patent rounds out and strengthens our neural stem cell
portfolio, which we believe is unparalleled in its breadth, depth and
completeness,’ said Martin McGlynn, President and CEO of StemCells, Inc. ‘We
are confident that any third party wishing to commercialize neural stem cells as
potential therapeutics or to use them as drug screening tools will have to seek a
license from us irrespective of how they derive the cells. We have already
granted licenses to several companies and are currently considering licensing
others.’

‘While we believe that it is clear that we are not infringing this patent, and
we have not yet been directly accused by StemCells, Inc. of infringing
this patent, the threatening statements in their press release of April 23rd
leave the misleading impression that we would require a license from them
as a result of the issuance of this patent. Nothing could be further from the
truth,’ said Neuralstem President & CEO Richard Garr. ‘And, in addition
to finding that the patent is unenforceable against us, or anyone else for that

that we are not infringing the patent and that the patent is also invalid.’

THE MARYLAND AND CALIFORNIA LITIGATIONS FILED ON MAY 7, 2008

8

Sometime later that day, on May 7, 2008, Neuralstem filed a declaratory judgment

9

action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against StemCells and NeuroSpheres

10

seeking a finding that the ‘505 patent was unenforceable, not infringed and invalid (the

11

“Maryland action”). (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 4.) The action as filed did not mention the ‘418

12

patent.

13

On May 7, 2008, StemCells filed a complaint in this Court against Neuralstem and its

14

founders, Karl L. Johe and I. Richard Garr, for patent infringement of both the ‘418 and ‘505

15

patents (collectively, the “California patents”). (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 5.)3 StemCells amended

16

its complaint on May 9, 2008, to allege two California state law causes of action, namely

17

Neuralstem’s violation of (i) California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 and

18

(ii) California common law trade libel (the “California action”). (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 6.)

19

These two California causes of action arise out of Neuralstem’s repeated derogatory statements to

20

the public about StemCells’ patent portfolio (viz., inaccurate claims about the reexaminations

21

pending before the U.S. Patent Office, allegations of fraud before the Patent Office in procuring

22

the ‘505 patent) in an attempt to debase the value of StemCells’ intellectual property. This has

Defendants question the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ infringement allegations against Defendants

two principal officers of Neuralstem, a virtual company, may be held liable, at a minimum, for
inducing infringement. See Insituform Tech, Inc. v. Cat Contracting, Inc., 385 F.3d 1360 (Fed.
Cir. 2004). Indeed, Defendant Johe is on publications with authors from the UC San Diego that
serve, in part, as support for the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 7.)

THE CLOSED STEMCELLS 2006 MARYLAND INFRINGEMENT ACTION

3

Almost two years ago, in July 2006, StemCells filed suit against Neuralstem in

4

Maryland alleging infringement of four StemCells patents, namely U.S. Patent Nos. 5,851,832,

5

6,294,346, 6,497,872, and 7,101,709 (the “Maryland patents”). These older Maryland patents

6

arise out of the complex prosecution history that recently resulted in the issuance of the ‘505 and

7

‘418 California patents. On December 7, 2006 and April 5, 2007, Neuralstem petitioned the

8

Patent Office to reexamine these older Maryland patents based on eleven prior art references.

9

After the Patent Office granted these petitions for reexamination, StemCells and Neuralstem

10

voluntarily agreed to stay and administratively close the Maryland infringement action until the

11

reexaminations were completed (the “closed Maryland action”).5 (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 13.)

12

Recent statistics published by the U.S. Patent Office show that the average pendency for a

13

reexamination proceeding is two years.

14

reexamination proceedings have been completed resulting in a reexamination certificate, and two

15

of the reexaminations are still awaiting further substantive action from the Patent Office.

16

(Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 15.) None of the California patents are at issue in the closed Maryland

17

action. Defendants Garr and Johe are not parties to the closed Maryland action.

(Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 14.)

None of the current

18

On May 6, 2008, Neuralstem moved to administratively open the closed Maryland action

19

and lift the stay. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 16.) StemCells has opposed this motion on the grounds

20

that (i) Neuralstem’s motion violates that court’s stipulated Order closing the case, and (ii) the

21

motion would, if granted, result in fractured and piecemeal litigation because the Patent Office

based on the limited record of the closed Maryland action, Defendants are clearly stretching when
they characterize Judge Williams as “already familiar with the issues in this case” and “the
technology described in the patents.” Defendants’ Br. at 9:18-20. In truth, the pleadings are not
yet fully settled, there have been no dispositive motions heard by the Maryland Court, StemCells
has not yet replied to Neuralstem’s motion to dismiss, no claim construction has occurred before
the Maryland Court, and the only discovery conducted to date has been partial limited discovery
solely on the issue of Section 271(e)(1) to meet Neuralstem’s motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or in
the alternative, Rule 56. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 21.)

ARGUMENT
A.

5

THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT’S 2008 MICRON DECISION RECONFIRMS THAT THE
COURT MUST ASSESS FOUR SUITABILITY AND CONVENIENCE FACTORS OF THE
COMPETING FORUMS, GIVING LITTLE WEIGHT TO FIRST-TO-FILE

6

Defendants’ motion to dismiss or transfer this case rests on a rigid, formulaic first-

7

to-file approach that the Federal Circuit has never “strongly endorsed,” as Defendants contend.6

8

Defendants’ Br. at 4:27. In doing so, Defendants seek to shoehorn the analysis of proper forum

9

into a narrow first-to-file test limited to three exceptions.

Defendants’ Br. at 6:18 – 8:6.

10

Defendants reach this result only through a strained reading of the Federal Circuit’s 1993

11

Genentech decision and by ignoring altogether the Federal Circuit’s 2008 Micron decision that

12

reaffirms law stretching back to Kerotest in 1952. Then, as now, judicial administration of

13

competing cases brought in different forums does not allow rigid mechanical rules. As the

14

Supreme Court explained:

15

The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, facilitating as it does the initiation of
litigation by different parties to many-sided transactions, has created complicated
problems for coordinate courts. Wise judicial administration, giving regard to
conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation,
does not counsel rigid mechanical solution of such problems. The factors relevant
to wise administration here are equitable in nature.

16
17
18
19

Kerotest, 342 U.S. at 183.

20

As recently as four months ago, the Micron decision reaffirmed that categorical rules

21

deferring to the first-to-file forum would be inappropriate, particularly in light of the “newly

22

understood legal environment” for declaratory relief jurisdiction articulated in the Supreme

23

Court’s MedImmune decision. See Micron, 518 F.3d 897; see generally, MedImmune, Inc.,

24

127 S. Ct. at 771. Before MedImmune, declaratory judgment jurisdiction did not arise in patent

25
26
27
28

6

Federal Circuit law governs where a court is being called upon to decide, as in this case,
whether to retain jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action in favor of a forum where a
patent infringement action is pending. See, e.g., Serco Servs. Co., L.P. v. Kelley Co., Inc., 51 F.3d
1037, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1995).

cases until there was an objectively reasonable threat of imminent suit. Micron, 518 F.3d at 901-

2

02.

3

Id. at 902. Thus, MedImmune, like the Federal Circuit’s subsequent SanDisk opinion, establishes

4

a “now more lenient legal standard” giving potential defendants “greater opportunity to race to

5

the courthouse” in the hope of forcing patent holders to defend their patents in deficient forums.

6

Id. at 905; SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

7

That categorical rules deferring to first-to-file forums are inappropriate equally applies to

8

procedural rules concering first-to-file disputes.7

MedImmune lowered the bar to whether “all the circumstances show a controversy.”

9

Recognizing that this new environment could promote litigants to race to the courthouse,

10

the Micron Court cautioned that rather than “automatically going with the first filed action,” the

11

more appropriate analysis takes account of the convenience factors under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),

12

explaining “where the two actions were filed almost simultaneously, this court detects that the

13

transfer analysis essentially mirrors the considerations that govern whether [a] court could decline

14

to hear the case.” Micron, 518 F.2d at 904. In other words, whatever weight first-to-file has as a

15

rule is greatly diminished in this new lenient environment where the actions, as here, were filed

16

almost simultaneously.

17

Having noted that the convenience factors “take on added significance” in light of the

18

newly understood MedImmune legal environment surrounding declaratory judgment jurisdiction,

19

the Federal Circuit in Micron held that district courts “must consider the real underlying dispute:

20

The convenience and suitability of competing forums.” Id. at 905 (emphasis added). The Federal

21

Circuit went on to articulate the controlling standard for review:

22
23
24
25
26
27
28

7

Defendants ask for the Court to apply a categorical rule and defer to Maryland on this analysis,
citing this Court’s 2007 Intuitive Surgical decision as support. Defendants’ Br. at 8:1-6. There is
no reason in equity to defer to such a categorical rule in this case because, as established by this
brief, (1) this Court is the first-to-file Court on most of the claims, (2) the Maryland Court was
aware of this motion’s pendance when it deferred StemCells’ appearance until after the scheduled
July 10 hearing date, thereby essentially deferring to this Court, (3) the changed legal
environment post-MedImmune warrants this Court examining the Micron factors, and (4) even
under the older legal environment, deference to the first filed court was not required. Based on
these equities, deference to Maryland following the old categorical rule is not warranted.

The convenience and availability of witnesses, absence of jurisdiction over all
necessary or desirable parties, possibility of consolidation with related litigation,
or considerations relating to the interest of justice must be evaluated to ensure the
case receives attention in the most appropriate forum. Eventually, robust
consideration of these factors will reduce the incentives for a race to the
courthouse because both parties will realize that the case will be heard or
transferred to the most convenient or suitable forum.
Id. at 905 (emphasis added).

7

The older (i.e., pre-MedImmune) decision of Genentech v. Eli Lily & Co. relied on by

8

Defendants is not to the contrary. While noting a general rule favoring the first-to-file forum, the

9

Genentech Court stressed that exceptions to this preference “are not rare, and are made when

10

justice or expediency requires, as in any issue of choice of forum.” E.g., Genentech v. Eli Lilly &

11

Co., 998 F.2d 931, 937 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Noteworthy, and consistent with the Federal Circuit’s

12

emphasizing them in the first instance in Micron, this Court recognized that the convenience

13

factors are also an exception to the first-to-file rule. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. v. Caltech, 2007 U.S.

14

Dist. LEXIS 31753 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2007). Thus, the Defendants are simply wrong under the

15

law by suggesting in their moving brief that first-to-file is a restrictive and categorical analysis

16

with only three exceptions—bad faith, anticipatory suit and forum shopping. See, e.g., Z-Line

17

Designs, Inc. v. Bell’O Int’l LLC, 218 F.R.D. 663, 665 (N.D. Cal. 2003) (“A court may also

18

refuse to apply the first to file rule if the balance of convenience weighs in favor of the later-filed

19

action.”).

20

In sum, the rigid inquiry that Defendants advance is not well-grounded in either old or

21

new Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent, all of which equitably focuses on the forums

22

and the nature of the suits. Only through “robust consideration” of the four Micron factors will

23

the courts reduce the waste of having parties on either side file premature suits merely to claim

24

first-to-file status. Micron, 518 F.3d at 904. Parties will come to realize that cases will be heard

25

in the “most convenient and suitable forum” irrespective of who reaches the courthouse steps

26

first. Id.

27

Only the California Court Can Properly Exercise Personal

15

16

1104, 1106-07 (9th Cir. 2000) (“A fundamental tenet of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is

17

that certain defenses under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 must be raised at the first available opportunity or,

18

if they are not, they are forever waived.”) In any event, this Court has personal jurisdiction over

19

Defendants as their accused infringing acts occurred in large part in California. (Kumamoto

Defendants have not challenged personal

Defendants’ unsupported representation that Maryland is a venue “where personal

alleges that StemCells consented to personal jurisdiction by filing the closed Maryland action in

2

2006. But the filing of one suit by a party in a particular jurisdiction does not subject that party to

future cases on a different transaction or occurrence, even ones involving the same parties.

6

initiation of [the other] action neither implies consent to be sued [in a new action], nor does it ‘in

7

and of itself constitute doing business in the jurisdiction where the suit [was] brought.’”).9

8

StemCells did not consent to being sued on all of the patents in its portfolio in Maryland simply

9

because it sued Neuralstem in Maryland in 2006 for infringement of the four Maryland patents –

10

the two actions, the closed Maryland action and the recent declaratory judgment action, do not

11

arise from the same transaction or occurrence.

12

As the Federal Circuit held in Kearns, it is fundamental that each patent raises an

13

independent and distinct cause of action that does not arise from the same transaction and

14

occurrence so as to subject a later patent to res judicata from prior suits on other patents.

15

See Kearns v. General Motors Corp., 94 F.3d 1553, 1555-56 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The Federal

16

Circuit reached this holding because proof of infringement or invalidity on one patent does not

17

prove infringement or invalidity of a different patent. Id. Each patent is a separate transaction or

18

occurrence. Id.

19

Indeed, the main thrust of Neuralstem’s Maryland declaratory judgment complaint is that

20

StemCells committed inequitable conduct during the prosecution of the ‘505 patent by failing to

21

cite art that was submitted in the reexamination of the four patents at issue in the closed Maryland

22

action. (Kumamoto Decl., Exs. 4 and 18.) But that affirmative defense is limited to the ‘505

23

patent and does not apply to the four Maryland patents stayed pending reexam in the closed

24
25
26
27
28

9

StemCells is unaware of any Federal Circuit authority that addresses the fact pattern now before
this Court. However, the Federal Circuit has cited with approval the First Circuit’s Interpole
decision. See Frank’s Casing Crew & Rental Tools, Inc. v. PMR Techs., Ltd., 292 F.3d 1363,

because NeuroSpheres has licensed the ‘505 and ‘418 patents exclusively to StemCells.

11

NeuroSpheres, however, is not a party to that closed Maryland action and NeuroSpheres cannot

12

be held to consent to personal jurisdiction based on the actions of StemCells. See Redwing Shoe

13

Company v. Hockerson-Halberstadt, 148 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“[T]he Supreme

14

Court has made clear that contacts resulting from ‘the unilateral activity of another party or third

15

person’ [licensee] are not attributable to a defendant.”). Even if it could be so held, as discussed

16

above, StemCells never consented to jurisdiction on a separate suit based on separate patents.11

17
18

In sum, personal jurisdiction and venue is lacking in Maryland while it is established in
California.

Moreover, StemCells’ infringement claims on the California ‘505 and ‘418 patents did not exist
at the time the closed Maryland action was filed on the earlier Maryland patents because the ‘505
and the ‘418 patents had not yet issued. See Kearns v. Chrysler Corp., 32 F.3d 1541, 1550 (Fed.
Cir. 1994) (“[T]he rights flowing from a patent exist only for the term of the patent . . .”).
11
StemCells’ press release is also insufficient to create personal jurisdiction under Federal Circuit
law. See Red Wing Shoe Co., 148 F.3d at 1360-61 (“Principles of fair play and substantial justice
afford a patentee sufficient latitude to inform others of its patent rights without subjecting itself to
jurisdiction in a foreign forum.”). In Red Wing, three notice letters alleging infringement were
held to be insufficient to create personal jurisdiction over a patentee in the forum to which the
letters were sent, even though the letters were sufficient, in combination with other facts, to give
rise to a declaratory judgment action. Id.

The original Maryland complaint failed to properly invoke
subject matter jurisdiction on the ‘505 patent reflecting its
improper and anticipatory nature

As with personal jurisdiction, Defendants’ Maryland action raises significant concerns
about subject matter jurisdiction that are not present in California.

7

As of May 7, when Defendants’ filed the Maryland declaratory judgment action, there was

8

not a “substantial controversy” between Neuralstem and StemCells concerning the ‘505 patent

9

“of sufficient immediacy and reality” to warrant the filing for declaratory judgment.

See

10

MedImmune, 127 S. Ct. at 771; SanDisk Corp., 480 F.3d at 1380-81; Monsanto Co. v. Syngenta

11

Crop Protection, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7236, *16-18 (E.D. Mo. January 31, 2008) (despite

12

acknowledging MedImmune lowered the standard for filing declaratory judgment actions, the

13

court still found no jurisdiction existed where there were no specific accusations that the

14

declaratory judgment plaintiff was infringing patents). Neuralstem’s press release of May 7, 2008

15

admits that no such direct charge of infringement on the ‘505 patent had been made by StemCells

16

prior to Neuralstem filing the Maryland action, nor is one pled in Neuralstem’s amended

17

complaint. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 3.)

18

Faced with these admissions, Defendants attempt to justify subject matter jurisdiction in

19

Maryland based on a press release statement by StemCells unrelated to the ‘505 patent and by

20

alleging a pattern and practice of threatening and enforcing patents against parties.

Such

21

allegations are insufficient to create declaratory judgment jurisdiction, however.

First,

22

Defendants point to StemCells’ April 15 press release stating that StemCells may move forward

23

on the closed Maryland action. Defendants’ Br. at 7:3-11. However, that press release plainly

24

refers to the Maryland patents in the closed case and does not mention the ‘505 patent or any

25

other patent outside the closed Maryland action. See Bridgelux, Inc. v. Cree, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist.

patents).

2

Next, Neuralstem attempts to buttress subject matter jurisdiction by pointing to three prior

3

StemCells lawsuits, arguing a possible pattern of enforcement. However, these allegations do not

4

justify Neuralstem’s rush to the courthouse to unilaterally “take matters into its own hands.”

5

Defendants’ Br. at 7:13-16. In point of fact, the 2004 and 2005 Maryland actions that Defendants

6

identify in footnote 5 of their brief were (1) against the same third party (ReNeuron Limited.,

7

which is now a StemCells licensee), (2) never served, and (3) dismissed without prejudice.

8

(Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 19.) The third action identified, the closed Maryland action, was brought

9

against Neuralstem and voluntarily closed by StemCells to permit the Patent Office to perform its

10

reexamination work. None of these prior lawsuits involved the ‘505 patent issued in 2008. Such

11

dismissed and closed suits on different patents does not create a justiciable controversy over the

12

‘505 patent.12

13

Neuralstem’s Maryland action represents an unwarranted attempt to extend declaratory

14

judgment authority to wrest further control from StemCells, as patentee, over its property.13 By

15

contrast, the California action poses no such fundamental jurisdictional issues, and so this Micron

16

factor also strongly favors the California action.

17

b.

18

Only the California Court has proper subject matter
jurisdiction for the two state law causes of action

12

To the extent that Defendants rely on a pattern or practice of enforcement to justify the illconceived Maryland action, in line with SanDisk, Micron applied such an analysis only where the
patentee had made direct threats of infringement on the at-issue patent, demanded a license on the
at-issue patent and had sued the competitors on the same at-issue patent. Micron, 518 F.3d at
901. That is not the case here where the patents differ and Defendants admit there had not been a
direct threat of infringement against Neuralstem or others on the ‘505 or the ‘418 patents. See
Document Sec. Sys., Inc. v. Adler Techs., Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15744 at *37-39
(W.D.N.Y. Feb. 29, 2008) (holding that patent infringement litigation against a third party did not
warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment of invalidity and unenforceability).
13
Even if first-to-file is relevant to this Court’s analysis, Defendants’ amended complaint at
Paragraph 14 admits that the Maryland declaratory relief claims on the ‘418 patent and the two
state law claims were not justiciable until after StemCells filed its California action. (Kumamoto
Decl., Ex. 18.) By Defendants’ admission, this Court had subject matter over these claims first.

2

The Maryland action’s stated basis for subject matter jurisdiction of state law claims

3

Count VI (declaratory relief of non-liability for trade libel) and Count V (Declaratory judgment of

Neuralstem’s Maryland action fails to allege such an independent basis. “[I]n the absence

11

of any pleading that invokes diversity jurisdiction, the relevant basis is federal question

12

jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.” Cardtoons, 95 F.3d at 964. As these two causes of action

13

are both rooted in California state law, there is no federal question present. The Maryland Court

therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims as plead, and this factor weighs against

15

Defendants’ motion.14

17

Consolidation of These New Actions With the Closed Maryland Action
Would Be Improper and Would Inequitably Delay the Trial and
Confuse the Issues under Consideration

18

Defendants argue that this California action should be transferred to Maryland so that it

19

can be consolidated with the Maryland actions to avoid piecemeal litigation. Close scrutiny

20

shows the opposite will occur, and therefore this Micron factor also weighs in favor of California.

21

This pending California patent case should not be consolidated with the closed Maryland

22

patent case as that would be highly prejudicial by delaying StemCells’ enforcement of its rights

23

under the ‘505 and ‘418 patents which are not under reexamination. See Bigg Wolf Disc. Video

5

see generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 42; see 9 Wright & Miller § 2382.

6

Perhaps recognizing the problems that would arise if the courts were to consolidate an

7

active case into a closed case, Defendants intimate that StemCells is now trying to wrongfully

8

delay opening the closed Maryland action. Defendants’ Br. at 10:5-7. Not so. StemCells

9

opposed Neuralstem’s attempt to re-open prematurely the closed case, in part, because StemCells

10

bargained for benefits in the stipulated court order which will not accrue until the reexaminations

11

have been completed. See generally Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Re-Open

12

Case and Lift Stay; (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 17.) Moreover, as explained in StemCells’ opposition

13

to Neuralstem’s motion, the case cannot be fully opened, and if opened, will proceed in piecemeal

14

fashion because certain of the patents are still in reexamination and their scope is not yet resolved.

15

Moreover, the California action and the closed Maryland action also present different

16

patents, distinct operative facts and legal issues, which would result in substantial confusion were

17

the cases consolidated. For example, Neuralstem has stated publicly and in its motion to lift the

18

stay that it will raise the defense of intervening rights in the closed Maryland action. (Kumamoto

19

Decl., Ex. 16.) That issue is not present on the two California patents, where no reexamination

20

request is pending.

21

actions likely involve different safe harbor issues under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1).

Also, under Neuralstem’s alleged intervening rights argument, the two

22

In addition, central to Neuralstem’s May 7, Maryland action is its affirmative defense of

23

inequitable conduct with respect to the ‘505 patent. The four older Maryland patents under

24

reexamination, which merely share a common parent application with the newly issued ‘505

25

patent, cannot possibly be tainted by the alleged inequitable conduct under the doctrine of

26

infectious unenforceability. See, e.g., Nilssen, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 902 (holding doctrine only

27

applies to patents with “immediate and necessary relation;” sharing a common parent application

28

is not sufficient to establish relatedness).

For these reasons, any argument of consolidation is illusory because of the different

2

procedural postures of the cases, the different patents and the variability and differences in the

3

issues. To the contrary, the risk of prejudicial delays and case confusion in Maryland are very

4

real. This factor therefore weighs against Maryland under Micron because transfer will not

The Convenience and Availability of Witnesses Favors the California
Forum for These Actions

8

There is no debate that this action can proceed conveniently in California. Neuralstem has

9

only a limited presence in Maryland and is a virtual company that outsources all its substantive

10

functions, including research activities in California. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 1.) StemCells is not

11

a virtual company and is located in California where the corporate witnesses reside. Both parties

12

have litigated in both forums already. In fact, just a few months ago, Neuralstem filed suit in

13

California against another California entity. (Kumamoto Decl., Ex. 20.) Litigation in California

14

poses no hardship to Neuralstem.

15

In contrast, the convenience of the third-party witnesses weighs heavily in favor of the

16

California forum. See Cronos Containers, Ltd. v. Amazon Lines, Ltd., 121 F. Supp. 2d 461, 466

17

(D. Md. 2000) (“Perhaps the most important factor to be considered by a court in passing on a

18

motion to transfer is the convenience of the witnesses.”). Many of the key third-party witnesses

19

reside either in California or are significantly closer to California than Maryland. Two of the

20

inventors of the California patents, for example, reside in Alberta, which is approximately 800

21

miles closer to this Court than the Maryland Court.

22

California action, Neuralstem’s trade libel and violations of California Business and Professions

23

Code involve lost licenses with BrainCells, Inc. and NeuroGeneration, both California companies,

24

and perhaps others in California given its established biotechnology industry. (Kumamoto Decl.,

25

Ex. 6 at ¶ 27.) Further, many of the infringing activities arise out of work done in California at

26

UC San Diego and will necessarily involve witnesses located in Southern California. (Kumamoto

27

Decl., Ex. 7.) While Defendants express concern that Neuralstem employees in Maryland would

have to appear twice (i.e., in separate and distinct legal proceedings in different states),

The Interests of Justice Strongly Favor California as the Proper
Forum for These Actions

7

The Micron “interest of justice” factor also favors the California forum on several

8

grounds. First, personal jurisdiction, venue and subject matter jurisdiction are established in the

9

California case permitting this Court to reach the merits. In contrast, the Maryland action’s

10

defects in personal jurisdiction, venue and subject matter jurisdiction would almost certainly

11

delay that action.

12

Second, Maryland lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory claims aimed at

13

the California state law causes of action, and those would likely be dismissed. See Section

14

III.B.2.b, supra. Thus, if the Maryland action proceeds on just the ‘418 and ‘505 patents, there

15

would likely be two suits, not one – one in California state court on the California causes of

16

action and one before the Maryland District Court – between the parties. Maintaining the entire

17

California action lessens the burden on the judicial system as a whole.

18

Third, this Court has experience with the uniquely California claim for unfair competition

19

under Business & Profession Code Sec. 17200, and thus adjudication of the state law claims

20

would be more efficient in California.16

21

Against this, Defendants argue that this Court would be wasting judicial resources by

22

keeping this case, citing London and Hull Maritime Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Eagle Pacific Ins. Co., 1996

23

WL 479013, *5 (N.D. Cal. August 14, 1996) (Wilken, J.). Unlike in London and Hull, however,

24
25
26
27
28

15

Neuralstem’s convenience of the witness argument also presupposes consolidation and delay of
this suit with the closed Maryland suit. The convenience factors, however, do not consider
witnesses in other lawsuits, for if they did, the convenience of witnesses in Neuralstem’s
California lawsuit would be a factor favoring California.
16
It bears emphasis that Defendants failed to challenge under Rule 12(b)(6) the adequacy of any
of the California causes of action, and thus do not dispute that StemCells has properly pled such
claims.

NEURALSTEM MAY NOT CLAIM WHATEVER RESIDUAL BENEFIT EXISTS UNDER
THE FIRST-TO-FILE RULE BECAUSE THE ACTIONS DIFFERED IN PARTIES AND
SUBJECT MATTER, AND THE MARYLAND ACTION IS A BAD FAITH,
ANTICIPATORY SUIT

11

Defendants’ motion rests on earlier decisions that did not reflect the new legal

12

environment under the 2007 MedImmune decision. As a result, Defendants fail to give proper

13

weight to the convenience factors and the role of the Court to look to the “convenience and

14

suitability of competing forums.”

15

Defendants’ failure to even cite the Micron case, Defendants’ race to the courthouse in Maryland

16

is the exact situation that Micron warned against when it held that a rigid view of the first-to-file

rule “cannot be given undue weight because it is easily manipulated.” Id.

21

(1) infringement claims of the ‘418 patent against all three Defendants; (2) infringement claims

22

on the ‘505 patent against two of the three Defendants; (3) violation of California trade libel laws;

23

and (4) violation of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200. Each of these

causes of action invokes separate and distinct legal issues and in no way can be considered to

over the ‘418 patent and state law declaratory claims until after StemCells filed suit in

5

California.18

6

Defendants claim first-to-file only on the ‘505 patent between the corporate parties. But

7

as discussed above, that claim is illegitimate as it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and personal

8

jurisdiction when filed.

9

StemCells publicly, as demonstrated by Neuralstem presaging the suit with a press release

10

accusing StemCells of defrauding the U.S. Patent Office. When Neuralstem issued this press

11

release and filed its Maryland action, it was aware that StemCells had spent considerable sums

12

developing and protecting its patent estate and that its IP portfolio and licensing opportunities

13

have been, as for any biotechnology company, of critical importance to StemCells’ business,

14

employees and prospects. And yet, when Neuralstem filed its suit, there was no “substantial

15

controversy” between the parties over either the ‘505 or ‘418 patents – indeed, there was no

16

controversy about this at all. Compounding this illegitimacy, Neuralstem then attempted to game

17

the federal system by amending its complaint so that it could argue that its action mirrors

19

21
22
23

28

Moreover, it was an anticipatory bad faith suit designed to harm

Defendants point to StemCells’ pendant jurisdiction statement that there are “common issues”
of fact to somehow argue for first-to-file on its later state claims. Defendants lean too heavily on
this language in the first amended complaint. Plaintiffs have pled nothing more than that there
exists a “loose factual connection” between the claims sufficient to establish supplemental
jurisdiction. See Ammerman v. Sween, 54 F.3d 423, 424 (7th Cir. 1995) (“A loose factual
connection between the claims is generally sufficient” for supplemental jurisdiction.); Allen v.
County of Monterey, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80012, at *14-15 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 19, 2007) (granting
supplemental jurisdiction where events underlying state claims and federal claims had no overlap
but were merely “factually connected” in a loose way). A loose factual connection on noncompulsory state claims is an insufficient basis to grant Defendants first-to-file status. See, e.g.,
Mann Design, Ltd. v. Bounce, Inc., 138 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1178-79 (D. Minn. 2001).
18
To this day, Defendants Garr and Johe have not sought to intervene in the Maryland action to
assert Declaratory Relief Claims, highlighting once again a difference between the suits.
Defendants’ motion references that this Court may lack personal jurisdiction over them. While
the claim is meritless, the simple answer to such rhetoric is that Defendants Garr and Johe have
waived any right to contest personal jurisdiction by failing to move this Court under

CONCLUSION
Defendants’ sole basis for requesting dismissal of this infringement lawsuit is the first-to-

10

file rule.

11

inequities of consolidation, and other interests of justice all favor California. Moreover, as to the

12

transfer under Section 1404(a), for the same reasons, the request should be denied as Defendants

13

have failed to establish that Maryland is a more convenient forum. Defendants’ request to

14

dismiss, stay or transfer this case should be denied so that the case may move forward

15

expeditiously to the merits.

As detailed above, the convenience of the parties, jurisdiction over the parties,

Even before Micron, several circuits have recognized the danger of forum shopping caused by
declaratory judgment actions. See Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Quarles, 92 F.2d 321, 324 (4th Cir.
1937) (holding courts should decline jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions filed “for the
purpose of anticipating the trial of an issue in a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction”); Citigroup Inc.
v. City Holding Co., 97 F. Supp. 2d 549, 557 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (“An improper anticipatory filing
is one made under the apparent threat of a presumed adversary filing the mirror image of that suit
in another court.”); Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc., 579 F.2d 215, 219 (2d Cir. 1978) (“The
federal declaratory judgment is not a prize to the winner of a race to the courthouses.”)
