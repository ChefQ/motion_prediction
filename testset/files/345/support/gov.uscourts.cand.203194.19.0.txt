TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

2

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 and Civil

3

L.R. 7-2, Neuralstem, Inc., Karl K. Johe, and I. Richard Garr (collectively “Defendants”) move the

4

Court to dismiss, stay, or transfer the patent infringement Complaint filed by plaintiffs, StemCells,

5

Inc. and StemCells California, Inc. (“StemCells”) based on the first-to-file rule because there are

6

two actions pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland—one filed by

7

Defendant Neuralstem and one filed by StemCells.

8

presumably the same allegedly infringing conduct, and the same patents.1 Alternatively, this Court

9

should transfer the current action so that it may be consolidated with the Maryland Actions because

10

a transfer would serve the interests of justice, avoiding duplicative litigation, the waste of judicial

11

resources, the potential for conflicting rulings, and inconvenience to the parties and witnesses.

12

I.

Those actions involve the same parties,

INTRODUCTION

13

This is not the first dispute between these parties. StemCells’ original Complaint and its

14

First Amended Complaint notably fail to inform the Court that the parties are already involved in

15

two litigations in another district court involving the same accused infringing activity and the same

16

patents at issue here. In 2006, StemCells sued Neuralstem in the District of Maryland, asserting

17

that Neuralstem’s research activities infringed its patent rights. (Civil Action No. 06-1877, the

18

“StemCells Maryland Action”). The StemCells Maryland Action alleges infringement of four

19

patents from the same patent family as those at issue here and presumably relates to the same

20

accused infringing conduct.2

21

Recently, based on threatening statements made by StemCells after the issuance of a new

22

patent in the same patent family, Neuralstem filed a declaratory judgment action in the District

23

Court of Maryland. (Civil Action No. 08-cv-1173, the “Neuralstem Maryland Action”). The two

24
1

The Amended Complaint fails to identify any facts concerning any infringing conduct by
any of the named defendants, so Neuralstem is left to guess what conduct is at issue here.
Indeed, the only allegation—“[o]n information and belief Defendants have been
infringing….”—is deficient on its face. First Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 11 and 16.

2

Neuralstem is a small company focused on clinical therapeutic research to treat various
diseases using its proprietary stem cell technology.

Maryland Actions are related and assigned to Judge Alexander Williams, Jr. Later that same day,

2

StemCells filed this reactionary lawsuit setting two courts on the path to deciding identical issues,

3

at the cost of judicial efficiency, consistency, and the convenience of all involved. It is undisputed

4

that the Neuralstem Maryland Action was filed before this case, involves the same accused

5

infringing activity, and the same patents at issue here. Accordingly, this Court should dismiss this

6

action because it violates the first-to-file rule.

7

Alternatively, the relevant facts clearly favor transferring this action to the District of

8

Maryland. Under well-established precedent in this Circuit, cases should be transferred where

9

related actions are pending. Here, transfer is particularly warranted to avoid piecemeal litigation,

10

conserve judicial resources, and prevent conflicting decisions on liability, validity, enforceability,

11

and the applicability of the “safe harbor” and other defenses. Finally, by filing the StemCells

12

Maryland Action in 2006, Stemcells has already agreed that Maryland is the proper venue for this

13

dispute. Thus, if this Complaint is not dismissed, this action should be transferred so that it may be

14

consolidated with the related litigation.

II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

16

A.

The StemCells Maryland Action

17

On October 6, 2006, StemCells filed its Second Amended Complaint alleging that

18

Neuralstem infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 6,294,346 (“‘346 patent”); 6,497,872 B1 (“‘872 patent”);

19

5,851,832 (“‘832 patent”); and 7,101,709 (“‘709 patent”) (collectively, the “patents-in-suit”). (Dkt.

20

No. 23.)3 On October 30, 2006, Neuralstem Answered the Second Amended Complaint and

21

asserted, inter alia, affirmative defenses that (1) Neuralstem does not infringe any valid or

22

enforceable claim of the patents-in-suit; (2) its activities are protected from infringement under 35

23

U.S.C. § 271(e)(1); and (3) each claim of the patents-in-suit is invalid. (See Dkt. No. 32.)

24

Additionally, Neuralstem filed counterclaims of non-infringement and invalidity of the patents-in-

25

suit, as well as a counterclaim for a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. (Id.)
On October 13, 2006, Neuralstem filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for

1

Summary Judgment asserting that all of Neuralstem’s allegedly infringing activities are exempt

2

from infringement by both statute and Supreme Court precedent. (See Dkt. Nos. 27, 28.) On

3

October 30, 2006, Judge Williams granted a joint motion to stay substantive patent discovery

4

pending resolution of Neuralstem’s motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 31.)

5

On February 16, 2007, in response to requests by Neuralstem, the PTO ordered

6

reexamination of the ‘346 patent and ‘709 patent based on a substantial new question of

7

patentability raised by the prior art. On May 10, 2007, the PTO also ordered reexaminations of the

8

claims of the other two patents involved in this lawsuit, the ‘872 patent and the ‘832 patent.

9

Because all four of the patents-in-suit were undergoing reexamination at the PTO, on June 25,

10

2007, upon a joint motion by both parties, this Court stayed and administratively closed the

11

litigation pending the reexamination proceedings in the PTO. (Dkt. Nos. 69, 70.)

12

On May 6, 2008, Neuralstem filed a motion to reopen the case and lift the stay. (Dkt. No.

13

71,72.) On May 7, 2008, StemCells’ counsel originally indicated that it might be interested in

14

stipulating to reopening the case. (Murthy Decl. at ¶ 7.) However, on May 12, 2008, StemCells

15

inexplicably changed its position and decided to oppose having the case reopened. (Murthy Decl.

16

at ¶ 8.) Nevertheless, a decision on the motion to reopen the case is expected soon.

17

B.

18

On April 22, 2008, the PTO issued United States Patent No. 7,361,505 (the “‘505 patent”)

19

for “Multipotent Neural Stem Cell Compositions” to Neurospheres. (See Ex. A.)4 The day after

20

issuance, StemCells, Neurospheres’ exclusive licensee for the ‘505 patent, issued a press release

21

regarding the ‘505 patent and touted its “broad claims covering human neural stem cells derived

22

from any tissue source, including embryonic, fetal, juvenile, or adult tissue.” (Ex. B, StemCells

23

April 23, 2008 Press Release.) In that press release, StemCells’ President and CEO, Martin

24

McGlynn stated: “We are confident that any third party wishing to commercialize neural stem cells

25

as potential therapeutics or use them as drug screening tools will have to seek a license from us

26

irrespective of how they derive the cells.” Id. (emphasis added).

1

Based on StemCells’ press release and its history of suing companies that refuse to take a

2

license, including Neuralstem, Neuralstem decided to take matters into its own hands, and on

3

May 7, 2008 it filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment that the ‘505 patent was invalid, not

4

infringed, and unenforceable. (Ex. C.) On May 13, 2008, Neuralstem filed its First Amended

5

Complaint and added invalidity and non-infringement claims against U.S. Patent No. 7,115,418

6

(the “‘418 patent”). (Ex. D.) Neuralstem also added declaratory judgment claims that certain

7

statements made about the status of the reexaminations relating to the patents involved in the

8

StemCells Maryland Suit were not “trade libel” or “unfair competition.” (Ex. D at ¶¶ 46-71.)

9

C.

The StemCells California Action

10

On May 7, 2008, hours after the Neuralstem Maryland Action was filed, StemCells filed

11

this Complaint alleging patent infringement of the ‘418 patent and the ‘505 patent. On May 9,

12

2008, StemCells filed an Amended Complaint adding claims for Trade Libel and Unfair

13

Competition in violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq. StemCells

14

admits that these state law claims, which it asserts are based on statements made by

15

Neuralstem’s CEO concerning the reexamination of patents involved in the StemCells Maryland

16

Action and the Neuralstem Maryland Action, have “common operative facts” to its patent

17

infringement claims here. (Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 2 and 22-37.)

18

III.

ARGUMENT

19

A.

20

As the Supreme Court has stated, “[a]s between federal district courts . . . the general

21

principal is to avoid duplicative litigation.” Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United

22

States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976). Under the first-to-file rule, a strong presumption exists that the

23

action should be decided by the court in which the action was first filed. See, e.g., Smith v. S.E.C.,

24

129 F.3d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 1997); Manuel v. Cevergys Corp., 430 F.3d 1132, 1135 (11th Cir.

25

2005); Asset Allocation & Management Co. v. Western Employers Ins. Co., 892 F.2d 566, 573 (7th

26

Cir. 1989).

27

declaratory judgment actions, the Federal Circuit applies its own law which strongly endorses the

This Case Should Be Dismissed For Violating The First-To-File Rule

Where, as here, a court is addressing jurisdictional issues relating to first-filed

first-to-file rule: “[w]e prefer to apply in patent cases the general rule whereby the forum of the

2

first-filed case is favored unless considerations of judicial economy, and the just and effective

3

disposition of disputes require otherwise.” Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly Co., 998 F.2d 931, 937

4

(Fed. Cir. 1993); Electronics for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle, 394 F.3d 1341, 1345-46 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

5

As the court in Genentech explained, the fact that the first filed suit is for declaratory

6
7
8
9
10
11
12

judgment does not change the analysis:
The considerations affecting transfer to or dismissal in favor of
another forum do not change simply because the first-filed action
is a declaratory action. When the declaratory action can resolve
the various legal relations in dispute and afford relief from the
controversy that gave rise to the proceeding, and absent sound
reason for a change of forum, a first-filed declaratory action is
entitled to precedence as against a later-filed patent
infringement action.
Genentech, 998 F.2d at 938 (emphasis added).

13

In applying the first-to-file rule, a court looks to three threshold factors: “(1) the

14

chronology of the two actions; (2) the similarity of the parties, and (3) the similarity of the

15

issues.” Z-Line Designs, Inc. v. Bell'O Int'l L.L.C., 218 F.R.D. 663, 665 (N.D. Cal. 2003)

16

(Whyte, J.). All three of these factors support the application of the first-to-file rule.

17

1.

Neuralstem Filed Suit In Maryland First

18

It is undisputed that Neuralstem filed its declaratory judgment action first. As this

19

Court recently explained, the fact that StemCells filed its patent infringement complaint a “few

20

hours” later on the same day does not change the first-to-file analysis:

21
22
23

The Court finds that the first-to-file rule is applicable and
requires deference to the first-filed court, notwithstanding the
near simultaneous nature of the filings. The Court is persuaded
that applying the first-to-file rule in this case furthers the sound
policy rationale underlying it.

24
Intuitive Surgical, Inc., v. California Institute Of Tech., 2007 WL 1150787, *3 (N.D. Cal. April
25
18, 2007) (Wilken, J.) (applying first-to-file rule when actions filed a “few hours” apart). Not
26
applying the first-to-file rule here would sanction reactionary lawsuits filed only to destroy the
27
plaintiff’s chosen forum. Such forum shopping should not be condoned.

The Parties Are Essentially The Same

2

StemCells, Inc., StemCells California, Inc., and Neuralstem are all parties to this action

3

and the Neuralstem Maryland Action. The only difference is that StemCells has decided—for

4

reasons that are not entirely clear—to name Neuralstem’s CEO and Chief Scientific Officer as

5

parties to this action. Indeed, this Court will search in vain for any facts supporting the

6

infringement allegations against these two individuals.

7

jurisdiction over these two Maryland residents is even more tenuous. Accordingly, this factor

8

also favors application of the first-to-file rule so that this case can proceed in Maryland—a

9

venue where personal jurisdiction issues are avoided, and where StemCells has repeatedly

10

Moreover, the case for personal

availed itself of the court system.5

11

3.

The Issues In The Two Cases Are Identical

12

The Neuralstem Maryland Action involves the same patents, the same accused

13

infringing activity, and the same legal issues of infringement, including application of the 35

14

U.S.C. § 271(e)(1) safe harbor provision, validity, and unenforceability.

15

Neuralstem Maryland Action and this suit would involve the same claim construction issues

16

and the same documents and records, and certainly the same witnesses will be deposed during

17

discovery and called to trial. There is no difference in the issues between the two cases.

18

4.

Inevitably the

No Exceptions To The First-To-File Rule Exist

19

“Circumstances under which an exception to the first-to-file rule typically will be made

20

include bad faith, anticipatory suit and forum shopping.” Alltrade, Inc. v. Uniweld Products,

21

Inc., 946 F.2d 622, 628 (9th Cir. 1991) (internal citations omitted). None of those exceptions

22

exists here.

23

It is impossible for StemCells to claim that Neuralstem engaged in forum shopping

24

since Maryland is the venue where StemCells has filed three separate patent infringement suits,

25

including one suit against Neuralstem. Likewise, StemCells can hardly claim that Neuralstem’s

26
5

27
28

In addition to the pending Stemcells Maryland Action, in 2004 and 2005, Stemcells sued
another competitor, ReNeuron twice in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland. See Civil Action Nos. 04-CV-03973 and 05-CV-1125.

1

actions were in “bad faith” or “anticipatory” when StemCells was already suing Neuralstem on

2

four patents disclosing the exact same technology and was issuing threatening statements.

3

On April 15, 2008, a few weeks before Neuralstem filed its declaratory judgment

4

action, StemCells’ CEO announced to the world its plans to “expeditiously” go after

5

Neuralstem in the StemCells Maryland Action:

6
7

“We welcome this action by the PTO, which preserves intact the
basis of our infringement action against Neuralstem,” said Martin
McGlynn, President and CEO of Stemcells, Inc.

8

***

9

We can now move ahead expeditiously with our suit against
Neuralstem and its collaborators and we remain confident they
will ultimately be found to have infringed numerous claims of
our patents. (Ex. E, StemCells Press Release dated April 15,
2008.)

10
11
12

Shortly thereafter, StemCells released another press release announcing the issuance of
13
the ‘505 patent and threatening Neuralstem and the entire market. (Ex. B.)
14
After waiting several weeks, Neuralstem decided to take matters into its own hands and
15
brought a declaratory judgment action to protect its business and adjudicate StemCells’ still
16
unasserted claims of infringement. Congress created declaratory judgment actions to provide a
17
remedy for parties—like Neuralstem—that are threatened with potential litigation but not sued.
18
“The Declaratory Judgment Act was intended to fix the problem that arises when the other side
19
does not sue.” Sony Elecs., Inc. v. Guardian Media Techs., Ltd., 497 F.3d 1271, 1284 (Fed.
20
Cir. 2007) (citing Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Norton Co., 929 F.2d 670, 673 (Fed. Cir. 1991)
21
(“In promulgating the Declaratory Judgment Act, Congress intended to prevent avoidable
22
damages from being incurred by a person uncertain of his rights and threatened with damage by
23
delayed adjudication.”)). Thus, under these circumstances, Neuralstem’s declaratory judgment
24

complaint cannot possibly qualify as either brought in “bad faith” or “anticipatory.”6

25

The only “anticipatory” lawsuit was that filed by Stemcells who filed this Complaint hours
after Neuralstem’s filing—a transparent attempt to forum shop.

Finally, as this Court has previously noted, any balance of convenience analysis or

determination about an exception to the first-to-file rule should be done by the first-filed court.

Intuitive, 2007 WL 1150787, at *3 (“The court in the first-filed action should decide whether

litigants, witnesses and the public against unnecessary inconvenience and expense.’” Van
Dusen v. Baraack, 376 U.S. 612, 616 (1964).
As the Supreme Court explained, Section 1404(a) was created precisely for cases like
this: “[t]o permit a situation in which two cases involving precisely the same issues are
simultaneously pending in different District Courts leads to the wastefulness of time, energy
and money that § 1404(a) was designed to prevent.” See Cont’l Grain Co. v. Barge FBL-585,
364 U.S. 19, 26 (1960) (superseded by statute on other grounds).

Section 1404(a)—to place litigation where it properly belongs, remedying StemCells’ abuse of

duplicative lawsuit is already pending in another federal court. This is especially true given
that another related action involving identical issues is pending in Maryland.7

The principal issue in determining if an action should be transferred to a more

2

convenient forum under Section 1404(a) is whether the transferee district—here, the District of

3

Maryland—is one where the action might have originally been brought. That and the other

4

factors to be considered and balanced in the analysis, including the convenience of the parties,

5

the convenience of witnesses, and the interests of justice, all compel the transfer of this action.

6

1.

Two Actions Are Already Pending In The District Of Maryland

7

Under Section 1404(a), an action “might have been brought” in any judicial district in

8

which venue is proper. See Sanders v. Franklin, 25 F. Supp. 2d 855, 857 (N.D. Ill. 1998).

9

Because both the Neuralstem Maryland Action and StemCells Maryland Action involve the

10

same parties, the group of patents, and the same alleged infringing activity, venue is proper in

11

the District of Maryland. Moreover, StemCells has already filed three separate infringement

12

suits in that district putting to rest any notion that Maryland is not the proper forum.

13

2.

14

The Interests Of Justice Overwhelmingly Favor Transfer To
Maryland

The “interests of justice” analysis relates to the efficient administration of the courts.
15
Factors traditionally considered in an “interests of justice” analysis include where the litigants
16
are most likely to receive a speedy trial and having judges familiar with the applicable law try
17
the case. That analysis likewise favors transferring this action to the District of Maryland.
18
Judge Williams is already familiar with the issues in this case, patent law, and the
19
technology described in the patents—he presided over the StemCells Maryland Action for over
20
a year before that case was stayed. There is a pending dispositive motion to be decided once
21

the case is reopened based on the “safe harbor” provision in 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1).8 StemCells

22
agreed that a stay of all substantive discovery unrelated to the “safe harbor” defense was
23
appropriate pending the outcome of that motion. Written discovery on the safe harbor issue is
24
complete and all that remains are a few depositions.
25
26
27
28

8

35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1) states: “It shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer to sell,
or sell within the United States or import into the United States a patented invention….solely
for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal
law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs or veterinary biological product.”

1

Moreover, the StemCells Maryland Action was stayed in 2007 by agreement of both

2

parties pending the outcome of reexamination proceedings initiated by Neuralstem at the

3

United States Patent & Trademark Office (“PTO”). Those reexamination proceedings are

4

nearly complete, and Neuralstem has moved to have the case reopened and the stay lifted.

5

Apparently recognizing that the claim amendments made during the reexamination have

6

damaged its infringement case, StemCells is now fighting to keep the suit, which it filed,

7

stayed. Nonetheless, a decision on that motion is expected soon.

8

Allowing this case to proceed in this District would waste judicial resources in having

9

two courts construe the terms in the patents, possibly leading to inconsistent rulings on claim

10

construction, validity, and infringement issues. Indeed, this Court has found judicial economy

11

dispositive in determining whether transfer is warranted:

12
13
14
15
16
17

In this case, a related case involving the same parties, the same
issues, the same witnesses and the same facts, is pending in the
Western District of Washington. If this case is not transferred,
inconsistent judgments could result, which could work an
injustice. For example, this Court could rule that the Excess
Underwriters were not responsible for the disputed amount, and
the Washington court could rule that Eagle Pacific was not.
Under these circumstances, judicial economy mandates that this
case be transferred to the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington.

London and Hull Maritime Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Eagle Pacific Ins. Co., 1996 WL 479013, *5 (N.D.

20

Cal. Aug. 14, 1996) (Wilken, J.).

21

Here, without a transfer, there could be inconsistent ruling on the “safe harbor” defense,

22

and different claim constructions for the same terms in the identical and related patents

23

involved this case and the Maryland Action.

The Convenience Of The Parties Is Best Served By Transferring
This Case

While StemCells is based in California, compelling reasons exist to afford its choice of
forum no weight. StemCells has filed multiple suits in Maryland, including the StemCells
Maryland Action which will be re-opened—despite StemCells’ gamesmanship in attempting to

1

keep the case it filed closed.9 As a result, StemCells has already committed itself to producing

2

witnesses and discovery in the Maryland. Therefore, the Court should give no weight to any

3

argument from StemCells that the District of Maryland is an “inconvenient” forum.

4

Finally, this action and the Maryland Actions will require the testimony of identical

5

witnesses on the issues of infringement and validity of the same patents. Specifically, both

6

actions will likely require the same witnesses from Neuralstem to testify about its stem cell line

7

and clinical research activities and from StemCells to testify as regarding the patents-in-suit

8

and alleged damages from infringement. Should both actions proceed, the same witnesses will

9

be required to appear multiple times in separate courts on opposite sides of the country.

10

Transferring this action to Maryland would allow this case to be consolidated with the

11

Maryland Actions, therefore greatly reducing the burden on these witnesses.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be granted. In the

alternative, this action should be transferred to the District of Maryland or stayed.

Defendant Neuralstem, Inc. (“Neuralstem”) moves to dismiss or stay this action, or in the

2

alternative, to transfer it to the District of Maryland. Having considered all of the papers filed by

3

the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing. For the reasons

5

BACKGROUND

6
7

The parties have a history of litigation over a number of patents related to stem cell
technology. Accordingly, a brief history of the events leading up to this action is provided below.

8

A.

The StemCells Maryland Action

9

On October 6, 2006, StemCells filed its Second Amended Complaint alleging that

10

Neuralstem infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 6,294,346 (“‘346 patent”); 6,497,872 B1 (“‘872 patent”);

11

5,851,832 (“‘832 patent”); and 7,101,709 (“‘709 patent”) (collectively, the “patents-in-suit,”

12

hereinafter referred to as the “StemCells Maryland Action”). On October 30, 2006, Neuralstem

13

Answered the Second Amended Complaint and asserted, inter alia, affirmative defenses that (1)

14

Neuralstem does not infringe any valid or enforceable claim of the patents-in-suit; (2) its activities

15

are protected from infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1); and (3) each claim of the patents-in-

16

suit is invalid. Additionally, Neuralstem filed counterclaims of non-infringement and invalidity of

17

the patents-in-suit, as well as a counterclaim for a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust

18

Act.

19

On October 13, 2006, Neuralstem filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for

20

Summary Judgment asserting that all of Neuralstem’s allegedly infringing activities are exempt

21

from infringement by both statute and Supreme Court precedent. On October 30, 2006, Judge

22

Williams granted a joint motion to stay substantive patent discovery pending resolution of

23

Neuralstem’s motion to dismiss.

24

On February 16, 2007, in response to requests by Neuralstem, the United States Patent &

25

Trademark Office (“PTO”) ordered reexamination of the ‘346 patent and ‘709 patent based on a

26

substantial new question of patentability raised by the prior art. On May 10, 2007, the PTO also

27

ordered reexaminations of the claims of the other two patents involved in this lawsuit, the ‘872

28

patent and the ‘832 patent. Because all four of the patents-in-suit were undergoing reexamination

at the PTO, on June 25, 2007, upon a joint motion by both parties, this Court stayed and

2

administratively closed the litigation pending the reexamination proceedings in the PTO.

3
4

On May 6, 2008, Neuralstem filed a motion to reopen the case and lift the stay. A decision
on the motion to reopen the case and lift the stay is pending.

5

B.

The Neuralstem Maryland Action

6

On April 22, 2008, the PTO issued United States Patent No. 7,361,505 (the “‘505 patent”)

7

for

“Multipotent

Neural

Stem

Cell

Compositions”

to

Neurospheres

Holdings

Ltd.

8

(“Neurospheres”). The day after issuance, StemCells, Neurospheres’ exclusive licensee for the

9

‘505 patent, issued a press release regarding and touting the issuance of the ‘505 patent.

10

Based on StemCells’ press release and its history of suing companies that refuse to take a

11

license, on May 7, 2008, Neuralstem filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment that the ‘505

12

patent was invalid, not infringed, and unenforceable (hereinafter referred to as the “Neuralstem

13

Maryland Action”). On May 13, 2008, Neuralstem filed its First Amended Complaint and added

14

invalidity and non-infringement claims against U.S. Patent No. 7,115,418 (the “‘418 patent”).

15

Neuralstem also added declaratory judgment claims that certain statements made about the status

16

of the reexaminations relating to the patents involved in the StemCells Maryland Action were

17

not “trade libel” or “unfair competition.”

18

C.

The StemCells California Action

19

On May 7, 2008, but after the Neuralstem Maryland Action was filed, StemCells filed this

20

Complaint alleging patent infringement of the ‘418 patent and the ‘505 patent. On May 9, 2008,

21

StemCells filed an Amended Complaint adding claims for Trade Libel and Unfair Competition in

22

violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq. StemCells admits that these

23

state law claims, which it claims are based on statements made by Neuralstem’s CEO concerning

24

the reexamination of patents involved in the StemCells Maryland Action and the Neuralstem

25

Maryland Action, have “common operative facts” to its patent infringement claims here.

DISCUSSION

2

A.

3

As the Supreme Court has stated, “[a]s between federal district courts . . . the general

4

principal is to avoid duplicative litigation.” Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United

5

States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976). In virtually every circuit a strong presumption exists that an

6

action should be decided by the court in which the action was first filed. See, e.g., Smith v. S.E.C.,

7

129 F. 3d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 1997); Manuel v. Cevergys Corp., 430 F. 3d 1132, 1135 (11th Cir.

8

2005); Asset Allocation & Management Co. v. Western Employers Ins. Co., 892 F. 2d 566, 573 (7th

9

Cir. 1989).

The First-To-File Rule

Where, as here, a court is addressing jurisdictional issues relating to first-filed

10

declaratory judgment actions, the Federal Circuit applies its own law which strongly endorses the

11

first-to-file rule: “[w]e prefer to apply in patent cases the general rule whereby the forum of the

12

first-filed case is favored unless considerations of judicial economy, and the just and effective

13

disposition of disputes require otherwise.” Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly Co., 998 F. 2d 931, 937

14

(Fed. Cir. 1993); see also Electronics for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle, 394 F. 3d 1341, 1345-46 (Fed.

15

Cir. 2005).

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23

As the court in Genentech explained, the fact that the first filed suit is for declaratory
judgment does not change the analysis:
The considerations affecting transfer to or dismissal in favor of
another forum do not change simply because the first-filed action
is a declaratory action. When the declaratory action can resolve
the various legal relations in dispute and afford relief from the
controversy that gave rise to the proceeding, and absent sound
reason for a change of forum, a first-filed declaratory action is
entitled to precedence as against a later-filed patent infringement
action.
Genentech, 998 F.2d at 938.

24

In applying the first-to-file rule, a court looks to three threshold factors: “(1) the

25

chronology of the two actions; (2) the similarity of the parties, and (3) the similarity of the

26

issues.” Z-Line Designs, Inc. v. Bell'O Int'l L.L.C., 218 F.R.D. 663, 665 (N.D. Cal. 2003)

27

(Whyte, J.). All three of these factors support the application of the first-to-file rule.

Chronology of the Two Actions

2

Neuralstem filed its declaratory judgment action first. As this Court recently explained,

3

the fact that StemCells filed its patent infringement complaint a “few hours” later on the same

4

day does not change the first-to-file analysis:

5
6
7

The Court finds that the first-to-file rule is applicable and
requires deference to the first-filed court, notwithstanding the
near simultaneous nature of the filings. The Court is persuaded
that applying the first-to-file rule in this case furthers the sound
policy rationale underlying it.

8
Intuitive Surgical, Inc., v. California Institute Of Tech., 2007 WL 1150787, *3 (N.D. Cal. April
9
18, 2007) (Wilken, J.) (applying first-to-file rule when actions filed a “few hours” apart). Not
10
applying the first-to-file rule here would sanction reactionary lawsuits filed only to destroy the
11
plaintiff’s chosen forum.
12
2.

Similarity of the Parties

13
StemCells, Inc., StemCells California, Inc., and Neuralstem are all parties to this action
14
and the Neuralstem Maryland Action.

The only difference is that StemCells has named

15
Neuralstem’s CEO and Chief Scientific Officer as parties to this action. Nevertheless, this
16
factor also favors application of the first-to-file rule.
17
3.

Similarity of the Issues

18
The Neuralstem Maryland Action involves the same patents, the same accused
19
infringing activity, and the same legal issues of infringement, including application of the 35
20
U.S.C. § 271(e)(1) safe harbor provision, validity, and unenforceability. The Neuralstem
21
Maryland Action and this suit would involve the same claim construction issues and the same
22
documents and records, and certainly the same witnesses will be deposed during discovery and
23
called to trial. There appears to be no difference in the issues between the two cases.
24
4.

The Court in the First Filed Action Determine Exceptions To The

25
First-To-File Rule
26
“Circumstances under which an exception to the first-to-file rule typically will be made
27
include bad faith, anticipatory suit and forum shopping.” Alltrade, Inc. v. Uniweld Products,

Inc., 946 F. 2d 622, 628 (9th Cir. 1991)(internal citations omitted). However, The court in the

2

first-filed action should decide whether there is an exception to the first-to-file rule. Intuitive,

3

2007 WL 1150787, at *3. Therefore, this Court will not address arguments that Neuralstem

4

engaged in forum shopping, or that a balancing of convenience factors weighs in favor of

5

litigating in Northern California. The Court defers to the District of Maryland to decide

6

whether an exception to the first-to-file rule is applicable.

7
8
9

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Neuralstem’s Motion to Dismiss and
DENIES Neuralstem’s Motion to Stay or Transfer as moot.
