STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Tracy Beatty was indicted in 2004 in the 241st Judiical District Court of Smith County,
Texas, in Cause No. 241-0978-04 for the Capital Offense of the murder of Carolyn Click, his
mother, in the coarse of committing or attempting to commit the offense of robbery. On August
10, 2004, the Defendant was convicted by a jury upon his plea of not guilty of the offense of
capital murder. The following evidence presented a the punishment stage pursuant to Article
37.071 (b) Texas Code of Criminal Procedure special issues were answered in such a way that a
death sentence was imposed. On August 11, 2004, the Trial Court sentenced Petitioner to death.
A State Petition pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure 11.071 a Writ of Habeas Corpus
was filed on January 4, 2007. After an Evidentiary Hearing, the Trial Court entered findings of
fact and conclusions of law which recommended that relief be denied. The Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals adopted this recommendation on May 6,2009.
The Petitioner filed his Federal Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2241
& 2254 on June 9, 2010. On or about March 15, 2011, Respondent filed his Motion for
Summary Judgment with Brief in Support. This Honorable Court allowed Petitioner to file his
reply to Respondent’s Answer on July 28, 2011. This response is timely filed.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Petitioner filed his Federal Writ Petition in 2010 and Petitioner agrees review is
governed by the Federal Habeas Statute as amended by the Anti-Effective Death Penalty Act
(AEDPA). See Lynd v. Murphy 521 U.S. 320 (1997). Put in the text of 28 U.S.C. 2254 D
states: “ an application for Writ of Habeas Corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to

2

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 3 of 42 PageID #: 236

the judgment of the State Court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was
adjudicated on the merits of state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim” (1)
1. Resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application
clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States or,
2. resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the State Court proceeding.
A State Court decision is “an unreasonable application of clearly established” Supreme
Court precedent under 2254 if the State Court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but
applies that unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoners case. Williams v. Taylor 529 U.S.
420. To prevail under 2254 D(2) a Petitioner must rebutt by clear and convincing evidence the
presumption that a State Court’s factual findings are correct under 28 U.S. 2254 D(1). However,
Pinholster and Richter appear to hold that a determination of a claim against a habeas
proceeding determines all parts of the claim that are integral to that claim. If this is the case then
Petitioner would have to surmount the second level of deference pursuant to the AEDPA
regarding the prejudice prong of Strickland and the progeny of Williams, Wiggins, Rompella,
etc.
By its terms 28U.S.C. 2254 (D) bars relitigation of any claim adjudicated on the merits in
State Court subject only to the exceptions of 28 U.S.C. 2254 D(1) and D(2) see Herrington v.
Richter 131 S Ct. 770 (2011). Petitioner agrees that his claims that were presented to the State
Court were adjudicated on the merits and thus 28 U.S.C. 2254 D(1) and D(2) apply.1 Thus
1

See Cullen v. Pinholster 563 U.S. ____ 2011, 2011 WL 12257805 (2011) also see
Harrington v. Richter 131 Sct. 770(2011) holding that a summary denial by a State Court is an
adjudication without merits.

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 4 of 42 PageID #: 237

review in Federal Court is only permitted when the earlier State Court decision resulted from an
unreasonable application of clearly established Federal Law or the State Court decision was
based on a unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record before the State Court.
Petitioner agrees that the question of whether an unreasonable application of Federal
Law is different from an incorrect application of federal law. Williams v. Taylor 529 U.S. 361
(2000). In Ineffective Assistance of Counsel claims where the controlling Supreme Court
precedent is Strickland. The Application of the AEDPA grants a further layer of deference in
addition to the deference implicitly contained in the holding of Strickland. The State Courts
determination that a claim lacks merit precludes Federal Habeas relief so long as fair minded
jurors could disagree on the correctness of the State Court decision see Yarborough v.
Alvarado 541 U.S. 652 (2004).
A Federal Habeas Court reviewing a claim of a State prisoner that was adjudicated on the
merits on the State Court Proceedings must determine what arguments or theories could have
supported the State Court’s decision and it must ask whether it is possible fair minded jurors
could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with a holding in a prior decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States see Cullen v. Pinholster 563 U.S. (April, 2011), 2011
WL 12257805 (2011).
It’s clear that in regard to 2254 (D)(1) claims and Strickland v. Washington provides the
clearly established federal law in regard to the 6th Amendment Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
claims. Pursuant to Strickland Petitioner must show both the deficient performance and
prejudice prongs Strickland at 690.

Defendant must show that Counsel failed to act

reasonablely considering all the circumstance an in order to satisfy the deficient performance
4

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

prong. In order to satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland the Defendant must show there is
reasonable probability that but for Counsel’s unprofessional errors results of the proceeding
would have been different. In a death penalty case, in satisfying the prejudice prong of
Strickland the Defendant must show that there was a reasonable probability that absent the
errors the sentence would have concluded that death was not warranted. Strickland supra at
695. Further Petitioner must show that the requirements of 28 USC 2254 (D)(1) and (D) (2) have
been satisfied.
FACTUAL BASIS

Day had children by a prior marriage by the names of Tim, Chad and Kammie. While he worked
Ms. Click took care of the kids. Ms. Click had some paranoia where she actually thought that
people were living in the attic.(V2 P128 L12) Mr. Day had never been contacted by Holly
Randall or anyone from the defense team.(V2 P138 L17-25) Although that there were some
problems with Mr. Beatty while he resided in the house he thought that Tracy Beatty was a pretty
good kid around him. (V2 P146 L13) Chad Day also testified that Carolyn Click was physically
and emotionally abused the kids.(V2 P152 L8) He was beat with a frying pan on one occasion

with a knife on another occasion. (V2 P152 L16) On one occasion the school noticed bruises on
him that had been caused by Carolyn Click and when he got home (V2 P153 L6) Carolyn Click
gave him one of the worst whippings he ever had. (V2 P153 L12) According to Mr. Day he sure
didn’t deserve it.(V2 P153 L14) He was present when he saw Ms. Click pull his sister Kammie’s
hair out. (V2 P154) Ms. Click would engage in bizarre behavior; where she would make the
kids walk around in circles in the heat in the back yard in and if they stopped that they would be
beaten.(V2 P155 L10-16) Most if not all of these beatings occurred while Ms. Click was in the
nude and the kids were in the nude. (V2 P156 L1) He wasn’t allowed to have any friends over (
V2 P 157 L1) and he couldn’t tell his father about the abuse because fear of what Ms. Click
would do. (V2 P158 L7)
Kamie Bently also testified at the Writ Hearing about the mental and physical abuse by
Ms. Click.(V2 P172 L3) She was sadistically beat with a belt. (V2 P172 L20)She bolstered her
brother’s testimony where the children were made to walk in circles outside in the back yard and
they weren’t given anything to drink.(V2 P173 L2) She likewise talked about the nude
beatings,(V2 P173 L23) the hair pulling and in addition the kids weren’t given enough food to
eat.

She also was told not to tell their father, (V2 P175 L15) which she didn’t do because of

fear. Ms. Click also told the kids that they were fat, ugly and stupid. She was picked on because
she was the smallest, weakest one.(V2 P176 L21)On at least one occasion Tracy Beatty stopped
his mother from beating her. (V2 P177 L24)Likewise no one ever spoke to her from the defense
team when this case initially went to trial.
Mr. Perkins lead trial counsel also testified at the Writ Hearing. He testified about the
defense team that was assembled which included a fact investigator, a mitigation investigator,
6

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 7 of 42 PageID #: 240

and forensic investigator, and psychological and psychiatric experts. (V2) Roy Linn was the fact
investigator. Dr. Allen and Dr. Self were psychological psychiatric experts. Dr. Frost was a
forensic expert, Holly Randall was the mitigation investigator and Ken Hawk second chair trial
counsel. Mr. Perkins was primarily in charge of the guilt or innocence stage of the trial while
Mr. Hawk was more in charge of the experts and the punishment phase of the trial.(V2 P19 L7)
Mr. Perkins through Mr. Linn and Ms. Randall’s efforts became aware of some suicide attempts
by the deceased. During the trial of this case, the defense attempted to admit into evidence,
evidence of these suicide attempts however, such attempts were unsuccessful based on a ruling
by the Trial Court. Mr. Perkins articulated reasons of attempting to get these suicide attempts
into evidence was “just to dirty up the deceased when we get to the special issues. (V2 P31 L13)
Mr. Perkins also testified at the Writ Hearing that had he known of the bizarre behavior of Ms.
Click i.e. the beatings, and abuse of the Day kids, i.e. the walking around in the nude, the
paranoia, and the mental illness of the deceased he would have proffered that evidence. (V2 P47
L7-16) Holly Randall also testified at the Writ Hearing. Ms. Randall was the mitigation
investigator and she was aware of the existence of Tim Day. His name appeared on a life line
she prepared in regard to Mr. Beatty’s case. She received the information of Tim Day from
Tracy Beatty. She was aware that Mr. Beatty had step-siblings however, (V5 P15 L24) no one
ever contacted Mr. Beatty’s extended family and no decision was ever made not to contact
them. (V5 P23L4) In articulating a reason why this information was not explored she stated that
she had only two months to do what she had to do and they didn’t have time.(V5 P 23 L12) She
also testified that these medical records regarding Ms. Click’s visits to the hospital were
mitigating however, based on a meeting by the defense team there was a legal strategy not to
7

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 8 of 42 PageID #: 241

attempt to offer these medical records. (V5 P34 L14) She elaborated on the time situation by
saying that she didn’t have enough time to do what she had to do that she felt frustrated by the
lack of time. (V5 P47L24) The two month window between the time she was appointed until the
trial time was very unusual (V5 P48 L7)and she would never take a case when she had that little
time again. (V5 P48L13) She did feel as if there was nothing really that the defense team could
have done however, she did agree that what is mitigating is left up to the jury and if evidence
isn’t proffered by the defense then a jury never has the opportunity to determine if something is
mitigating or not. (V5 P53 L7) When advised of the previously testimony from Mr. Day, and
the Day kids she thought that this bizarre behavior by Ms.Click was extremely important and
should have been presented. (V5 P54L17) She actually stated that if this evidence existed “ I
would have driven there and picked it up myself, that’s how important it would have been.
(V5P56L9)
Dr. Gripon a Psychiatrist who testified at punishment stage of petitioners trial in regard
to 37.071 i.e. the future dangerousness issue; Dr. Gripon also testified at the writ hearing. Dr.
Gripon is a forensic psychiatrist who has testified numerous times in capital murder cases. He is
familiar with capital murder legal procedure. He is aware of the importance of mitigation
evidence in conjunction with Article T.C.C.P. Art. 37.071. He is also aware that a jury has
unbridled discretion to determine whether something is mitigating or not. Dr. Gripon testified
that Tim Day’s testimony regarding Carolyn Click’s mental illness, hospital visits, and overdose
could be considered to be mitigating. Dr. Gripon as psychiatrist also stated that Carolyn Click’s
eccentric behavior as testified to by Chad and Kamie Day regarding the beatings, being made to
walk around in circles outside, an administration of beatings in the nude was absolutely abnormal
8

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 9 of 42 PageID #: 242

behavior. (V4 P247L17) He also could conceded that the testimony from Leanne Wilkerson and
Twyla Johnson regarding Carolyn Click’s nature as being controlling, eccentric, and knowing
how to push buttons also could be considered to be mitigating evidence (V4P251L19). He also
theorized that since beatings often time are administered behind closed doors, that its conceivable
that Carolyn Click treated her own son Tracy Beatty the same way she had treated the Day
children. (V4 P262L18)
This evidence along with evidence presented at the Writ Hearing from Twyla Johnson
and Lana Wilkerson regarding the circumstances between Mr. Beatty and his mother’s
relationship and the actual character of Ms. Click as cold, arrogant, demanding was never
presented to the jury for their consideration in regard for their consideration pursuant to T.C.C.P.
Art. 37.071 i.e. the mitigation issue.
At the guilt/innocence stage of the trial, during opening statements, Trial Counsel
conceded that the Defendant/Petitioner was guilt of the offense of murder. The strategy of Trial
Counsel was due to the relationship between Petitioner and his mother, Ms. Click. That
Petitioner just snapped and killed his mother, Ms. Click. It was only after Ms. Click death that
Petitioner formed the intent to take and use her property. It is well settled under Texas Law that
the intent to commit the underlying felony which elevates murder to capital murder must be prior
to or simultaneously with the formation of the intent to commit the murder. The State was
allowed to offer un-rebutted evidence as to the loving nature of the decedent. Nothing was
offered by the Defendant to rebutt this damaging testimony. Consequently, the only belief the
jury could have had is that this ex-con killed his mother to obtain her property, what else could
the jury think giving the state of the record in this matter? Evidence presented at T.C.C.P.
9

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 10 of 42 PageID #: 243

11.071 Writ, included testimony from witnesses who Trial Counsel were aware of and should
have been named in discovery or included in the State witnesses list. Twyla Johnson, an
acquaintance of the Decedent had previously given a statement whereby she had witnessed an
altercation between Carolyn Click, the decedent,(V4P9L8) and Petitioner. According to Ms.
Johnson Ms. Click was being very abusive and hateful to Petitioner calling him “stupid”,
“retarded” and “dumb”.(V4P11L9-19) Ms. Johnson had never been contacted by anyone from
the defense team. (V4P12L3)This evidence as well as evidence that followed from Leanne
Wilkerson would have been admissible pursuant to T.C.C.P. Art. 38.36 which states as follows:
In all prosecutions for murder, the state or the defendant shall be permitted to offer
testimony as to all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the
previous relationship existing between the accused and the deceased, together with all
relevant facts and circumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the accused
at the time of the offense.

On cross examination, Mr. Bingham, the District Attorney for Smith County, Texas,
asked the following question:
“And in your mind....can you think of .... I don’t know everything you know... can you
think of anything about these statements that would justify Tracy Beatty’s killing his mother?”
“After an objection, the court allowed the witness to answer the question, the Court
allowed the witness to answer the question.”
Its obvious from the question itself that Mr. Bingham misses the import of Petitioners
contention, its not that these words justify Mr. Beatty’s actions, they do not. But what it does
show is that the murder was committed not in pursuit of financial gain, but rather in a moment of
anger. Additionally the defense also called Leanne Wilkerson, a neighbor of Ms. Click, who also
testified at the Writ Hearing in State Court. (V4 P23 L7)Ms. Wilkerson also testified at the Trial

10

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 11 of 42 PageID #: 244

of this case and had been contacted by investigator for the defense team. (V4 P30L17) However,
the investigator never questioned Ms. Wilkerson prior to Trial as to prior incidents that she had
observed between Petitioner and his mother. According to Ms. Wilkerson she had known the
decedent for approximately 10 years. She met Tracy Beatty after he moved in with his mother.
Mr. Beatty did a lot of work for Ms. Wilkerson. Ms. Wilkerson previously suffered a heart
attack and was unable to do any physical labor. As a result Mr. Beatty helped her by mowing
grass, moving dirt, picking up rocks things that he didn’t need to do but did just to help her out
for very small in financial gain.(V4) Ms. Wilkerson was never afraid of Mr. Beatty and
considered Mr. Beatty to be a friend.(V4 P26L8) While Mr. Beatty was living with his mother,
Ms. Wilkerson heard numerous arguments almost on a daily basis between Petitioner and his
mother. During these arguments she heard Ms. Click’s voice raised in anger. Ms. Wilkerson was
bothered by the way Ms. Click was depicted at trial as a poor, little weak disabled lady. She was
the farthest thing from that that would possibly be (V4P46 L3-7) And indeed Ms. Click became
angry with Ms. Wilkerson for no obvious reason. According to Ms. Wilkerson at times Ms. Click
could be a very nice lady but at other times she could be a “mean cold hearted bitch.” Ms. Click
was eccentric, controlling, strange. On one occasion Mr. Beatty was excited about having a job
interview he had been looking forward to it for days. At the time of the job interview he got
ready, dressed, and Ms. Click advised him that she just didn’t feel like taking him to the job
interview today. Mr. Beatty was very disappointed and upset.(V4 P52L3-5) None of this
evidence was ever discovered, and proffered to the jury at the trial of this case.

PETITIONER’S ALLEGATIONS
The following allegations were raised by Petitioner at this Federal Habeas Proceeding.
(1)Petitioner received Ineffective Assistance of Counsel in violation of the 6th
Amendment of the United States Constitution by Trial Counsel’s failure to properly investigate,
discover and present “mitigating evidence” in violation of Strickland v. Washington and
Wiggins v. Smith
(2) Petitioner received Ineffective Assistance of Counsel in violation of the Sixth
Amendment of the United States Constitution by Trial Counsel’s failure to properly investigate
facts which would have shown that this “ killing” was a murder rather than capital murder.
CLAIM #1 RESTATED
Petitioner received Ineffective Assistance of Counsel in violation of the 6th Amendment
of the United States Constitution by Trial Counsel’s failure to properly investigate, discover and
present “mitigating evidence” in violation of Strickland v. Washington and Wiggins v.
Smith.
In answering Petitioner’s claim, Respondent states:
(1) That Counsel investigated this thoroughly as possible given resource and time
constraints.(2) The defense presented no mitigating evidence because all was double edged and
because Beatty himself instructed Counsel not to present two witnesses. (3)Tracy Beatty proves
neither deficiency nor prejudice and the State Court properly found Beatty failed to show that
Counsel was Ineffective.
Taking Respondent’s answer into separate components, results in the following:
(1) Counsel investigated as throughly as possible given resources and time constraints
12

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 13 of 42 PageID #: 246

State Court’s Findings of Fact
PETITIONER’S RESPONSE
Petitioner actually agrees with this. Given the limited amount of time that Ms. Randall
had to conduct an investigation the investigation was as thorough as possible. This, however,
does not excuse any failure to discover and present any mitigating testimony that should have
been discovered if a more thorough investigation would have been conducted.
RESPONDENT’S ANSWER
(2) The Defense presented no mitigating evidence because all was double edged and
because Beatty had instructed Counsel not to present his witnesses.
PETITIONER’S RESPONSE
As stated in Respondent’s answer, Petitioner contends that both 28 USC 2254(D)(1) and
2254 (D)(2) apply.
(D) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant
to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was
adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim.
(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or
(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the State Court proceeding.
THE STATE COURT ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT :
57. Mr. Perkins and Mr. Hawk both testified that they would have to initially find the
names of any potential mitigation witnesses based upon what Applicant told them about his life.
13

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 14 of 42 PageID #: 247

Later, the discovery provided by the State and their own investigative efforts could supplement
the initial interview with Applicant.
58. Mr. Perkins testified that he was not aware of the names, Tim Day, Chad Day,
Kammie Bently, Kim Patterson, Melanie Carmichael or David and Danny Wyatt.
75. Mr. Perkins was not aware that Applicant had not one time stepped in and stopped his
mother from a beating she was inflicted on a step-sibling. Mr. Perkins was of the opinion that he
would not have presented that evidence because it also shows that all the other times he stood by
and watched his mother beat the step-siblings and did nothing.
76. At the Evidentiary hearing, Applicant also presented Mr. Tim Day who testified that
he was married to the victim from 1978 until 1984. He brought three children into that marriage,
Kimberly Patterson, Chad Day and Kamie Bently. He was not contacted by Applicant’s defense
team.
77. According to Mr. Day, the victim was in counseling for mental problems the entire
time they were married and she did overdose on her medications from time to time during that
period.
78. Mr. Day saw Applicant and the victim being violent towards each other one time in
six years. He heard her hollering and saw her hanging on Applicant’s back.
80. If called by the defense to testify in Applicant’s behalf at the punishment phase, Mr.
Day could not think of one good thing to say about Applicant. At one point during the marriage,
Applicant was kicked out of the house by the victim and Mr. Day because he stole the victim’s
vehicle and crashed it. Applicant was described by Mr. Day as “very high strung, hot-headed
person.” Furthermore, Mr. Day believes that Applicant was abusing drugs and exhibited the
14

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 15 of 42 PageID #: 248

“classic signs” of drug abuse.
85. Applicant called Mr. Chad Day who testified that when his father, Tim, was married
to the victim she would be physically abusive to him and beat him and his sisters quite
frequently. She would make them stay outside all day and they had to keep within her eyesight
and never stop moving in a circle. During the beatings the victim was often nude and the
children were told to take their clothes off as well.
88. Instead, Mr. Chad Day would tell the jury that Applicant “stayed in trouble a lot,” he
stole a car and wrecked it, he tried to shoot the neighbor’s dog and hit their house by mistake.
This witness further saw Applicant smoke marijuana in his presence when he was only 10 or 11
and Applicant was seventeen. In addition, this witness would tell a jury that he saw Applicant
throw the victim against a refrigerator and knock her unconscious.
89. Mr. Tim Day did not testify concerning whether anyone from Applicant’s original
defense team had contacted him. He did, however, testify that when Sheri Stillwell spoke with
him she did not ask him about flipside of his testimony- that is she did not ask him about the
“bad things” he could say about the Applicant if called as a punishment witness.
91. Applicant presented Ms. Kamie Bently who testified that she was 6 or 7 years old
when her father, Mr. Tim Day, got married to Applicant’s mother. She claims that she too was
physically and mentally abused by the victim. According to Ms. Bently, the victim would beat
her and pull her hair. She did not tell her father because the victim warned her not to.
92. Ms. Bently remembers only one time that Applicant interceded while she was being
beat by the victim, although he was present for other beatings. She never saw the victim beat
Applicant.
15

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 16 of 42 PageID #: 249

93. Ms. Bently, if called to testify as a punishment witness could not remember one good
thing to say about Applicant other than the single act of intercession. She didn’t recall Sheri
Stillwell ever asking her what bad things she might be able to say about Applicant. Further,
contrary to Ms. Stillwell’s affidavit, Applicant did not play a role in protecting her and her
siblings from the victim.
94. Applicant presented no direct testimony from this witness regarding whether she had
been contacted by Applicant’s original defense team.
99.

Mr. Perkins would not attach much mitigating value to testimony that the victim

was abusive to her step-children when weighed against the evidence that she was not similarly
abusive to Applicant, and in fact doted on him.
100. Mr. Perkins would not have presented the testimony of Mr. Tim Day, Mr. Chad
Day, or Kamie Bently, because each had more aggravating evidence to present regarding
Applicant than mitigating. Although Mr. Perkins could not recall talking to these witnesses, he
would have contacted them if Applicant had given him their names.
103. Mr. Ken Hawk testified that he had heard the names of Mr. Tim Day, Mr. Chad
Day, and Ms. Kamie Bently before, but could not recall if it was in connection to the trial or the
writ hearing.
106. Mr. Hawk would not attach much mitigating value to testimony that the victim was
abusive to her former step-children when weighed against the evidence that she was not similarly
abusive to Applicant, or in fact doted on him.
109. Ms. Twyla Johnson was presented by Applicant and testified that she lived near the
victim at the time of the offense and saw Applicant and the victim arguing one time in the front
16

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 17 of 42 PageID #: 250

yard. She heard the victim calling Applicant names in a very hateful tone of voice. She never
observed any other confrontations between them. She had never heard the victim talk to anybody
like that before. In her opinion, the argument she saw did not justify Applicant’s killing his
mother.
111. Applicant called Ms. Lee Ann Wilkerson who testified at the evidentiary hearing
and at Applicant’s trial. She knew the victim and lived across the street from her for
approximately nine years. When she learned that Applicant was coming to stay with the victim,
she invited them both over for dinner. However, that dinner never occurred because the victim
and Applicant had an argument about the victim driving her vehicle the short distance to Ms.
Wilkerson’s residence. Over time the witness came to know Applicant and he did odd jobs for
her and had dinner at her house.
115. According to Ms. Wilkerson, the victim was eccentric, but she never saw anything
that made her deserving of being murdered by Applicant.
152. The State presented Ms. Holly Randall who testified that she is an experienced
mitigation specialist who was assigned to assist Applicant’s defense team. She interviewed
Applicant more than once in an attempt to get names of witnesses she could contact regarding
mitigating evidence. All told, Ms. Randall spent 91 hours in preparation for trial.
155. Applicant did not tell this witness the names of the Day siblings, or any person not
listed in her report. Applicant did not tell her that she should talk to them because the victim was
abusive to them. Nor did Applicant mention that she should talk to the Wyatt’s.
158. She did not feel that evidence that was available regarding Applicant’s childhood
and relationship with his mother would have “changed the outcome” had it been presented.
17

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 18 of 42 PageID #: 251

159. Ms. Randall testified that she felt like the defense team worked very hard and did a
thorough job within the time constraints placed upon them by the scheduling of the trial. She
also felt that the defense team’s efforts were so concentrated that they had accomplished in two
months what would normally take them five months. She felt she did a “very good job.”

The findings of fact entered by the Court basically summarized testimony of witnesses
after they have been cross examined by the State. A careful reading of the record indicates that
the testimony upon which the findings of fact are based is a mere “ad hoc” rationalization of
prior performance as warned about in Wiggins.
In addition, the findings of fact which were drafted by the State in this case, if not
ingenious, are at least misleading. For instance Mr. Day testified at the State writ hearing that the
Tracy Beatty was “ a pretty good kid”. (V2P142) Chad Day did testify that, at one time, Tracy
Beatty shot at a neighbor’s dog and hit their house by mistake. What is not contained in the
findings of fact is that Mr. Day also testified that the reason Mr. Beatty shot at the neighbor’s dog
is because the neighbor’s had killed their dog first. (V2P161)
It is true that none of the Day children who were approximately 10 years younger than the
Applicant at the time they were living with the victim. It is true there is no testimony that the
Day children ever saw the victim beat Tracy Beatty, however Mr. Beatty was approximately 17 at
the time he was living in the house with his step-siblings.
It’s true Ms. Bently could not remember one good thing to say about the Applicant,
however, due to the length of time Ms. Bently can’t remember anything good or bad about Mr.
Beatty. Mr. Perkins did testify that he would have not attached much mitigating value to the
18

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 19 of 42 PageID #: 252

testimony adduced at the writ hearing and considered the testimony to be more aggravating than
mitigating and consequently would not have presented this evidence. Again this is an ad hoc
rationalization. Mr. Perkins rationalization was that testimony of the Day children would adduce
additional aggravating evidence is untenable. Reading the record reflects that the majority of
“bad” evidence additionally adduced as a result of this testimony being presented was already
known by the jury.
Twyla Johnson testified at the writ hearing and had never been contacted by any member
of the defense team at the time of trial. It is true on one occasion that Applicant and the victim
were arguing and that she heard the victim calling Applicant names in a very hateful tone of
voice. However, these names being called were demeaning such as “are you retarded, your “no
good.” This is particularly important as evidence presented by LeeAnn Wilkerson who contrary
to just testifying that the victim was eccentric, testified that the victim was a hateful, vindictive,
two faced bitch. (V4P16)
Holly Randall testified at the writ hearing that she felt that she and the defense team did a
good job giving the time constraints that they had. She felt that the testimony of LeeAnn
Wilkerson regarding the victim’s controlling mean spirited nature should have been presented to
the jury however, (V6P69) it could not have been since the defense was unaware of this
testimony. Holly Randall was actually a State’s witness at the writ hearing and on cross
examination when being told about testimony of the Day children, actually testified that she felt
that this evidence was so important that she would have driven to their location and picked them
up herself so that they could testify.
On re-direct the State of Texas asked Ms. Randall if she felt the same way about the Day
19

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 20 of 42 PageID #: 253

children testifying if the Day children would also testify that Tracy Beatty stood and watched the
beatings and did nothing to stop them. The State of Texas asked if she thought it would be
beneficial to Tracy Beatty to have a jury hear all the bad stuff. Ms. Randall answered no. The
State then asked the question, “ in your opinion do you think the bad evidence might, in that
situation out weigh the good?” Ms. Randall responded very much so, yes and that was our
thoughts. (V5P63)
It is undisputed that the defense team knew of the existence of the Day children at the
time of trial. However, the Day children were never contacted by members of the defense team
and they were totally unaware of any testimony that they Day children could give. Consequently,
it is impossible for the defense team to have thought that at the time of the trail that the bad
evidence that the Day children could give would outweigh any good evidence. This is the
smoking gun that shows that the testimony of the defense team at the writ hearing is nothing
more than an ad hoc rationalization of what they didn’t do during the trial. Consequently,
Applicant contends that decision that Petitioner received Ineffective Assistance of Counsel is
based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State
Court proceeding 2254(D)(2) does not preclude itself.

RESPONDENT’S ANSWER
(3) Tracy Beatty proves neither deficiency nor prejudice and the State Court properly
found Beatty failed to show that Counsel was ineffective.

Petitioner incorporates all previous

factual allegations and legal arguments contained in his writ and the response to respondent’s
answer.

PETITIONER’S RESPONSE
Petitioner was deprived of the Effective Assistance of Counsel in the sentencing phase of
this capital murder trial.
There is controlling clearly established supreme court precedent, in determining where
defense counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate and present available
mitigating evidence during sentencing. This Court must apply the standards set forth in
Strickland v. Washington

466 U.S. 668 (1984) Under Strickland the Defendant first “ most

show that Counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness which
must be judged under prevailing professional norms Id at 688.

In evaluating a claim that

Counsel failed to adequately investigate, Strickland states that Counsel has a duty to make
reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations
unnecessary.
Secondly the Defendant must satisfy the prejudice requirement by showing that there is a
reasonable probability that but for Counsels unprofessional errors the result of the preceding
would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine
confidence in the outcome. However, this test is not outcome determinative. The Strickland
Court itself expressly rejected an “outcome determining” standard requiring the Defendant to
show that Counsel deficient conduct more likely than not alter the outcome of the case. Instead
Strickland relies on whether the result of a proceeding is unreliable and hence the proceeding
itself unfair even if Counsel cannot be shown by a preponderance oft he evidence to determine
the outcome. Thus the “reasonable probability” standard i.e. a probability sufficient to
undermine confidence in the outcome is a less burdensome test than even the preponderance of
21

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 22 of 42 PageID #: 255

the evidence standard. In Williams v. Taylor 529 U.S. 362 (2000) the Supreme Court reiterated
this point. The prejudice inquiry is therefore case specific in that it is an attempt to assess the
effect of a Trial Counsels deficient performance had on the reliability of the outcome of the
particular proceeding.
In the early 2000's the Supreme Court accepted three cases to determine and to address
Effective Assistance of Counsel at the sentencing phase of a capital trial. Rompilla v. Beard
545 U.S. 374 (2005), Wiggins v. Smith 539 U.S. 510(2003) and Williams v. Taylor 529 U.S.
362 (2000)in each of these cases the Supreme Court held that the clearly established law of
Strickland mandated the finding of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel. The AEDPA posed no
barrier relief to these cases, all set out a detailed set of instructions to the lower courts on the
proper applications of Strickland in a capital sentence proceedings. In Williams v. Taylor 529
U.S. 362 (2000) the United States Supreme Court determined that Mr. Williams did not received
effective assistance of Counsel at the sentencing phase of his capital trial. According to the
opinion there wasn’t much question as to the guilt of Mr. Williams. The State also presented
evidence in support of the aggravation. The Defendant had just been convicted of a cold blooded
beating death of a defenseless man for three dollars and he had a history of prior felony
convictions. Mr. Williams had been involved in numerous assaults and while incarcerated and
pending trial he had set his cell on fire. Two psychological experts testified that there was a high
probability that Mr. Williams could constitute a continuing threat to society. Mr. Williams
defense counsel at the sentencing phase of the trial presented some family member and neighbor
testimony and neighbor testimony. The Supreme Court however, concluded that the Trial
Counsel performance was deficient because they failed to investigate and discover extensive
22

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 23 of 42 PageID #: 256

records describing Mr. Williams childhood. What is important about Williams is that the Court
expressly noted that its frequently true about a capital defendants’s history that not all the
additional evidence was favorable. However the Court held that failure to introduce records that
were never located and reviewed by Trial Counsel could not have been based on strategic
considerations related to the negative information in the records. The Court held that the failure
to conduct a proper investigation was deficient performance. The Court then determined that
based upon what this investigation would have shown that had a proper investigation been
conducted, prejudice was shown. The holding in Williams is also important because the Court
emphasized that whether the mitigating evidence might have resulted in a different outcome is an
entirely separate question from whether it negates future dangerousness. Mitigating evidence
unrelated to dangerousness may alter the jury selection of the penalty, even if it does not
undermine or rebutt the prosecutions death eligibility case. The questions is not whether there is
sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence but whether the totality of the mitigating evidence
might well have influenced the juries apprising the defendant’s moral culpability. In Wiggins v.
Smith 539 U.S. 510 (2003) the Supreme Court revisited the issue of capital defense investigation
and representation. Mr. Wiggins was assessed the death penalty in the State of Virginia. Afer a
verdict and during post conviction proceedings Wiggins challenged the adequacy of his
representation at sentencing arguing that attorney’s had rendered constitutionally Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence. In Wiggins
Trial Counsel acknowledged that he did not retain a forensic social worker i.e. a mitigation
investigator to prepare a social history. In Wiggins Trial Counsel was aware of Mr. Wiggins
childhood including incidents of physical and sexual abuse an alcoholic mother placements in
23

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 24 of 42 PageID #: 257

foster care and borderline retardation. The State Courts according to Wiggins held that Trial
Counsel had made a reasonable choice to proceed with what they thought was there best defense.
The Federal District Court granted habeas corpus relief in Wiggins but the 4th Circuit reversed,
holding that counsel “made a reasonable strategic decision to focus on Petitioner’s direct
responsibility.” The 4th Circuit held that Counsels knowledge of at least some details of
Wiggins childhood was sufficient to make an informed strategic decision. The Supreme Court
held however that Wiggins counsel was ineffective during his trial because their investigation
failed to satisfy Strickland performance standard and the State Courts conclusion to the contrary
was objectively unreasonable. After identifying the two part Strickland test, the Court
emphasized:
“ our opinion in Williams v. Taylor is illustrative of the proper application of these
standards. In finding Williams’ ineffectiveness claim meritorious, we applied Strickland, and
concluded that counsel’s failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evidence at
sentencing could not be justified as a tactical decision to focus on Williams’ voluntary
confessions, because counsel had not “fulfilled their obligation to conduct a thorough
investigation of the defendant’s background.” 529 U.S. 396, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (citing 1 ABA
Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4-1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1980))... in highlighting
counsel’s duty to investigate, and in referring to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice as
guides, we applied the same “clearly established” precedent of Strickland we apply today.
Wiggins at 522.
In Wiggins the Court focused whether the investigation supported counsels decision not
to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins background was itself reasonable. The Court then
cataloged the investigative efforts of Wiggins counsel and indeed Wiggins counsel had
conducted an investigative examination. However, the Trial Court’s decision not to expand their
investigation fell short of the professional standards that prevail. The Court held that the
standard practice in Maryland in capital cases at time of Wiggins trial include the preparation of

24

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 25 of 42 PageID #: 258

a social history report. Counsels conduct similarly fell short of the standards for capital defense
work articulated by the American Bar Association- standards which we have long referred to as
“guides to determining what is reasonable.” The ABA Guidelines provide that investigations
into mitigating evidence “should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating
evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the
prosecutor.”
The Supreme Court scrutinized counsels failure to conduct an investigation in Wiggins
and concluded that the record of the actual sentence proceedings unscores the unreasonableness
of counsels conduct by suggesting that their failure to investigate thoroughly resulted from in
attention, not reasoned strategic judgment. In reviewing Counsels actions before and during the
trial, the court conducted “ the strategic decision the state courts and respondents all invoke to
justify counsels limited pursuit of mitigating evidence resembles more a post hoc rationalization
of counsel’s conduct than an accurate description of their deliberations prior to sentencing.”
Wiggins at 526
Rompilla v. Beard 545 U.S. 374 (2005) Two years later, in Rompilla, the Court held that
“even when a capital defendant’s family members and the defendant himself have suggested that
no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and
review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of
aggravation at the sentencing phase of trial.” In Rompilla evidence was sufficient to show Mr.
Rompilla not only killed his victim, but tortured him. Mr. Rompilla had a significant criminal
history of felony convictions including a burglary and a rape at gun point. In Rompilla the
defense case at punishment consisted of five family members who asked the jury for mercy.
25

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 26 of 42 PageID #: 259

The Federal District court held that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland
and granted habeas corpus relief due to defense failure to present significant mitigation evidence.
The Third Circuit however, reversed. Therefore the panel determined that trial counsel failed to
discover mitigating evidence located in records, but that based on the information that Trial
Counsel actually had, Trial Counsel was justified in failing to look. In Wiggins Trial Counsel
ignored obvious leads, in Rompilla the Third Circuit held that Trial Counsel did enough to
reasonably conclude that further investigation would be a waste of resources. The Supreme
Court reversed the Third Circuit and granted relief holding that trial counsels investigation
deficient even though Rompilla himself was not helpful and his contribution to any mitigation
case was minimal. In Rompilla the Court again relied on the ABA Guidelines for the standard
of care. After finding deficient performance under Strickland the Supreme Court that next
turned to the prejudice inquiry which again was addressed de novo because the state court never
addressed that issue.
These cases have clarified “clearly establish law” applicable to capital cases adjudicated
in state court after Strickland . The following principals are inherit in Strickland and its
progeny:
Performance:

!

Capital defense is sufficiently specialized and regulated to have a national
standard, reflected both in the 8th Amendment and the ABA Guidelines.
Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387; Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524; Williams, 529 U.S. at 397.

!

While there is not set of per se rules or checklist for capital representation,
defense counsel must- in every case- engage in a thorough social history
26

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 27 of 42 PageID #: 260

investigation. The ABA Guidelines reflect the “well-defined norms” of the
national standard for mitigation investigation, and thus the floor below which
local practices may not descend. Wiggins 539 U.S. at 524-25 and Rompilila 545
U.S. at 380.

!

Termination of mitigation investigation is only appropriate in the context of an
informed decision, after a thorough investigation. Rompilla 545 U.S. 395;
Wiggins 539 U.S. 527-28.

!

The fact that counsel performed some, or even extensive investigation, does not
preclude a finding of deficient performance with respect to further investigation
they reasonably should have done under the circumstances. Rompilla 545 U.S. at
388-89; Wiggins 539 U.S. at 527, 534.

!

Federal courts, even under the deferential scheme of the AEDPA, should
scrutinize claims of strategy in light of a close reading of the record and a state
court finding of strategic purpose for an omission should be disregarded if it
cannot withstand such scrutiny. Wiggins 539 U.S. 526-27.

!

The duty to investigate and prepare for the punishment phase also includes
rebutting the prosecution’s case in aggravation. Counsel must, at a minimum
secure the information in possession of law enforcement. Rompilla 545 U.S. 38587.

Prejudice:

!

Prejudice ensues whenever the totality of the mitigating evidence “might well
have influenced the jury’s appraisal” of the defendant’s moral culpability.
27

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 28 of 42 PageID #: 261

Rompilla 545 U.S.. 393; Wiggins 539 U.S. 538; Williams 529 U.S. 398.

!

The operative question is whether there’s a reasonable probability that one juror
would have voted differently. Wiggins 539 U.S. 537

!

When assessing prejudice from counsel’s error or omissions, reviewing courts
must look at all of the evidence in the aggregate, including the evidence adduced
at trial and the evidence adduced in post-conviction proceedings. Wiggins 539
U.S. 536; Williams 529 U. S. 397-98

!

Courts should not focus on trial counsel’s post-trial statements regarding whether
they would have used the mitigating evidence adduced in post-conviction
proceedings, the relevant inquiry is whether a competent attorney would have
introduced it. Wiggins 539 U.S. at 535.

!

The failure to discover mitigation undermines the outcome even in highly
aggravated cases. The failure to provided any context or explanation for an
aggravated case may render the proceeding unreliable. The idea that considerable
aggravation is per se bar to finding prejudice is no longer viable after Williams
and Rompilla, both of which were highly aggravated cases.

!

Prejudice inures even if the omitted evidence does not rebutt the State’s case for
death eligibility. Williams 529 U.S. 398

!

Courts must look at all consequences that would have flowed from competent
performance, including the impact on the work of expert witnesses. Rompilla 545
U.S. 592-93.

!

When assessing prejudice federal courts need not make the state-law evidentiary
28

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 29 of 42 PageID #: 262

findings that would have been at issue at sentencing, courts merely evaluate the
totality of the evidence adduced at trial and in the habeas proceedings. Thus, a
petitioner can use reliable hearsay to prove prejudice.
1. DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE: Defense Counsel’s failure to conduct a
reasonable mitigation investigation and to discover relevant mitigating
evidence fell below an objective standard of reasonableness pursuant to
prevailing professional norms.
The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment
require sentencing procedures in a capital case to “focus the juries attention on the particular
nature of the particular crime.” Because “ an individual decision is essential, “ see Lockett v.
Ohio 438 U.S. 586,605 (1978) the Eight Amendment mandates that the sentence not be
precluded from considering as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record
and any circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less
than death. Relevant mitigating evidence is not limited only to evidence that would relate.
Specifically to petitioners culpability for the crime he committed see Skipper v. South Carolina
476 U.S. 1,4 (1986) and there is no requirement that mitigating evidence even have a “nexus” to
the offense or that the defendant make any showing that the criminal act was attributable in any
way to the mitigating factor see Tennard v. Dretke 542 U.S. 274 (2004). Relevant mitigating
evidence is basically defined as any evidence that might serve as a basis for a sentence less than
death.

Because the scope of mitigating evidence which may be considered by the jury in

sentencing is much broader than the range of relevant information which may be considered in
determining guilt or innocence, counsel is under a greater obligation to discover and evaluate
potential evidence of mitigation see United States ex rel Emerson v. Gramley 883 F3d 898 (7th

29

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 30 of 42 PageID #: 263

Cir. 1996) “its imperative to case a wide net for all relevant mitigating evidence is heightened at
a capital sentencing hearing.”
In short the prevailing professional norms when a petitioner is tried for capital murder
requires at a minium that counsel attempt through mitigation investigation presentation of
evidence to provided some “explanation for petitioner’s criminal propensities and some basis for
the exercise of mercy.” As stated in Caro v. Woodford 280 F3d 1247 (9th Cir. 2002) a little
explanation can go a long way and might make a difference between life and death.
In addition, the ABA Guidelines which had been refereed to in Supreme Court precedent
require that investigation for the penalty phase of a capital phase should begin immediately upon
counsels entry into the case. The ABA Guidelines 11.4.1A; 11.8.3A. In fulfilling counsels duties
the ABA Guidelines specifies that counsel should investigate the defendant’s full history,
including medial history, alcohol and drug use, birth trauma, family and social history. ABA
Guideline 11.4.1.D.2 mandates that counsel must interview witness family with aspects of the
client’s history that might affect the... possible mitigating reasons for the offense and/or other
mitigating evidence to show why the client should not be sentenced to death. Counsels duty is
not discharged merely by conducting a limited investigation. Counsel must “seek records,
interview family members, and friends, and obtain appropriate mental evaluations well in
advance for trial.”
In 2006 the State Bar of Texas published its guidelines and standard for Texas Capital
Counsel “SBOT” Guidelines. According to the Texas Guidelines Counsel should :3
3

This Trial was conducted in 2004, prior to the enactment of the Texas Guidelines
however the standards set forth in Strickland, Rompilla, Wiggins, and the ABA Guidelines all
predicate the trial of this cause.
30

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 31 of 42 PageID #: 264

A. Make application to the court for financial assistance to the defense team
In addition the SBOT Guidelines echo the 2003 ABA Guidelines in the holding in Rompilla,
with respect to trial counsels duty to investigate mitigating evidence.
The investigation regarding penalty should be conducted regardless of any statement by
the client that evidence bearing upon penalty is not to be collected or presented.
Finally the Texas Guidelines required counsels investigation to have produced sufficient
information to allow counsel to consider presentation of th following kinds of evidence: (1)
witnesses familiar with and evidence relating to the client’s life and development, that would
explanatory of the offense for which the client is being sentenced would rebutt or explain
evidence presented by the prosecutors, would present positive characters in the clients life or
would otherwise support a sentence less than death.
Applying these principals to the case at hand, the Petitioner recognizes that Trial Counsel
did not totally abrogate their duties as Trial Counsel in a capital murder case. In deed, Trial
Counsel incorporated a defense team which involved psychological/psychiatric experts, a
mitigation investigator, a fact investigator, and a forensic expert. However Petitioner contends
that merely by assembling this team does not constitute effective assistance of counsel per se.
As is evident from the statement of facts from the state writ of habeas corpus hearing, much was
left undone that should have been done. As stated in case law and the ABA Guidelines, Trial
Counsel in order to render effective assistance of counsel must immediately start preparing for
the punishment stage of a capital murder case. Although purportedly several witness were
contacted by the trial team, other witnesses were not. Witnesses that could describe the
tumultuous relationship between Petitioner and his mother, and witnesses who could describe the

31

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 32 of 42 PageID #: 265

eccentricity and bizarreness of Ms. Click’s personality were never contacted. They were
available. As Mr. Perkins stated during the writ hearing, they were looking for anything that
could possibly be mitigating. Again, as stated in the writ hearing on direct examination had he
known of the testimony of the Day children, Leanne Wilkerson, Twyla Johnson, he would have
introduced said testimony. However, upon being questioned by the State of Texas,
“ he crawfished” on this contention and stated that he would not have offered this testimony due
to the fact that in his opinion he would consider the testimony to be more aggravating than
mitigating. The problem with this contention is that any aggravating evidence that would have
been admitted through the testimony of these witnesses, the vast majority had already been heard
by the jury. There really wasn’t anything new that would potentially harm Petitioner had the
testimony of these witnesses been introduced, that the jury wasn’t already aware of. As stated in
Wiggins, this post trial explanation of a strategical decision appears to be more of ad hoc
rationalization as to why an investigation wasn’t conducted. Ms. Randall, the mitigation
investigator, testified that she just didn’t have enough time to do what she felt needed to be done
and consequently decisions had to be made where they could “get the biggest bang for their
buck.” This activity again, runs a foul of the holdings in Strickland, Wiggins, Williams,
Rompilla and the ABA Guidelines. Ms. Randall recognized the import of the testimony from
the state writ witnesses and as she stated “ had I know of this, I would have driven there and
picked them up myself.” Its important to note that in Wiggins, Strickland, and Rompilla there
were actually witnesses who testified on the behalf of the defense in the actual trial of their cause.
Such was not the case here. There were no witnesses presented by the defense and the attempt
to save Petitioner’s life consisted solely that Petitioner “was a child of God.” Respondent’s

Motion for Summary Judgment cite numerous 5th Circuit cases which repeatedly held that a
strategic decision not to pursue and introduce evidence which possess both mitigating and
aggravating qualities is objectively reasonable. These cases can be distinguished on at least two
grounds. One; the strategic decision made by Trial Counsel and those cases were made after a
proper investigation and a careful consideration of the evidence. Such is not the case at hand.
And two; these cases were decided prior to the holdings in Wiggins and Rompilla consequently
the legal precedent of their holdings may be questioned after the decisions in Rompilla and
Wiggins. Petitioner contends he has satisfied the first prong i.e. deficient performance of
Strickland.

2. PREJUDICE: Petitioner has demonstrated that but for Trial Counsel’s
deficient performance calls into question the reliability of jury’s verdict.

Prejudice; the totality of the mitigating evidence might have a influenced the juries
appraisal of the defendant moral culpable for successful claim of ineffective assistance of
counsel, a reasonable probability must exists that the result of the proceeding would have been
different but for trial counsels error. Strickland v. Washington 466 U.S. 687 a reasonable
probability is a probability sufficient to undermine this courts confidence in the outcome of the
proceeding. Is there a reasonable probability of available mitigating evidence would have caused
at least one juror to have struck a different balance. In this Writ of Habeas Corpus Mr. Beatty

In spite of Respondents contention to the contrary, Petitioner has met the test of
Anderson v. Collins 18F3d 1208 (5th Cir. 1994). He stated with specificity what the
investigation would have revealed, what specific evidence would have been discovered, and how
the evidence would have altered the outcome of the trial.
33

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

presents evidence that had not ever was presented to the trial jury. Based on the tumultuous
relationship between Mr. Beatty and the victim, his mother, and the uncontroverted evidence of
Ms. Click’s personality and the bizarre behavior, Petitioner contends that there is a reasonable
probability that the available mitigating evidence would have forced at least one juror to have
struck a different cord. Again, as stated in the discussion regarding performance there were not
any witnesses called at Petitioner’s trial. There was no evidence presented which would have
given a juror a vehicle to determine that there was at least one sufficient mitigating circumstance
to warrant that a life sentence be imposed rather than a death sentence. The fact that there was no
evidence presented, when the evidence adduced at the state writ hearing reflects that evidence
could have been presented, and should have been presented, to at least explain, not excuse, but
explain the relationship between Petitioner and his mother and the nature and character of Ms.
Click. Petitioner contends that based on the lack of an investigation to obtain this readily
available information, and providing it to the jury, this constitutes deficient performance. By
failing to present this evidence calls into question the reliability and fundamental fairness of this
proceeding. Consequently, Petitioner contends that prejudice has been shown. For instance,
Kamie Bently testifying that 30 years ago Ms. Click called her “stupid”, “lazy”, “no good.” Ms.
Click’s personality did not change. According to Ms. Johnson some 26 years later she was
angrily calling her grown son, “lazy and retarded.” A juror could rationally believe that Mr.
Beatty, as a youngster, was treated as the Day children were treated. Consequently, Ms. Click
made Petitioner into what he eventually became. In addition, Applicant contends that the record
does reflect that he instructed his defense team not to call two potential witnesses, relatives of
his, at the trial of this case. The defense team was obviously aware of the existence of these
34

witnesses and were aware of there potential testimony. After discussing this matter with
Applicant a strategic decision was made that these particular two witnesses should not be called
at the trial of this case. Applicant makes no contention that the failure to call these witnesses was
constituted Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as guaranteed by the 6th Amendment of the United
States Constitution but were rather a strategic decision made after careful consideration of the
circumstances. However, Applicant’s acquiescence to the failure to call the two witnesses
known to the defense team does not constitute an acquiescence to fail to call witnesses which
should have been known but were no known to the defense team to testify at the trial of this
cause. Prejudice has been established.
Petitioner realizes that a State Court determination is entitled to deference. That the State
Court decision will stand unless Petitioner can show that:
28U.S.C. 2254 (D) An Application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a
person in custody pursuant to the judgement of a State court shall not be granted with respect to
any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of
the claim:
(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United
States; or
(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the
facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.
DEFERENCE DOES NOT MEAN ABANDONMENT
Although as previously discussed, the State Court’s adjudications on the merits are
35

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 25

Filed 07/28/11 Page 36 of 42 PageID #: 269

entitled to deference. In the context of federal habeas deference does not imply abandonment or
of judicial review see Schriro v. Landigan 550 U.S. 465 (2007)and Miller-El v. Cockerell 537
U.S. 322 (2003).

SUM MARY
Strickland is the controlling Supreme Court precedent when applying 2254(D)(1). The
state courts determination that petitioner received Effective Assistance of Counsel is an
unreasonable application of Strickland, and it is based on an unreasonable determination of the
facts based on evidence adduced at the State evidentiary hearing. 2254 (D)(1) and 2254 (D) (2)
do not preclude relief.

ISSUE NUMBER 2
Petitioner received Ineffective Assistance of Counsel in violation of the 6th Amendment
of the United States Constitution by Trial Counsel’s failure to properly investigate facts which
would have shown that this “killing” was murder rather than capital murder.

RESPONDENT’S ANSWER
Beatty’s claim of Ineffective Assistance at guilt/innocence is unexhausted and
procedurally barred. Trial Counsel effectively represented Beatty during guilt or innocence.
Respondent argues that Petitioner’s claim of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at guilt/innocence
is unexhausted and procedurally barred.
PETITIONER’S RESPONSE

Petitioner concedes that this exact claim was not contained in his original State Writ.
However, after testimony was adduced at the State Writ Hearing, the Trial Court requested
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. It wasn’t until during the Writ Hearing that the
importance of the testimony regarding the prior relationship between the Petitioner and his
mother was important in the context of Texas Penal Code 19.02.

5

As stated in federal writ

pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 38.36 prior relationship of the parties is
admissible in a murder case. Petitioner would show that although this issue wasn’t filed with his
State Writ of Habeas Corpus , this issue was litigated, evidence was adduced at the writ hearing
and at the conclusion Applicant filed his proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law6

5

Pursuant to Texas Law if the murder is not committed in the coarse of certain felonies or
if the victim is of a certain protected status the murder is not capital murder. Rather it’s a first
degree murder with a maximum punishment of life. The evidence adduced from the Day’s ,
Twyla Johnson, and LeeAnn Wilkerson would tend to show that the murder was not committed
in a desire to obtain property but rather Petitioner was angry with the victim.
6

In Applicant’s Finding of Fact Number 153 relevant evidence would reflect that the
death of Carolyn Click was not done pursuant to a burglary but simply due to the fact that there
were bad feelings between the parties, consequently the murder was simple murder not capital
murder.
Applicant’s Finding of Fact Number 173 evidence of Carolyn Click’s character would have been
relevant ....to show that the murder was not capital murder.
Applicant’s Finding of Fact Number 182 Ms. Wilkerson told Tamara Beatty that there was a bad
situation and Applicant and Carolyn Click were gonna rip each other’s head’s off... this evidence
would have been relevant in showing that this was not a capital murder case.
Applicant’s Finding of Fact Number 185 Trial Counsel never learned of this evidence by failing
to conduct a thorough investigation.
Applicant’s Conclusion of Law Number 13 had this readily available evidence from the Day
family been presented to the jury there is a reasonable probability the jury would have returned a
verdict of guilty to the offense of murder rather than capital murder.
Applicant’s Conclusion of Law Number 21 Petitioner received Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
by Trial Counsel’s failure to investigate the case and present evidence in regard to prior acts of
violence between Carolyn Click and Applicant the nature of Carolyn Click’s character as being
mean, eccentric as described by LeeAnn Wilkerson.

which address the identical issue which is being presented here in Federal Court. Petitioner
would then contend that this issue was fairly presented in State court and consequently this issue
has been exhausted in State Court and there is no procedural bar pursuant to 28 USC 2254
(B)(1)(A).
Petitioner agrees with Respondent’s contention that the jury was able to hear Beauty’s
self serving accounts from several sources who did testify at trial. The State court found that
Beauty’s many versions of the nights events were presented to the jury. Following his arrest
Beatty confessed that he “snapped during an argument with his mother and killed the bitch.”
Another version that he told trial witness Mr. Clary that he chocked his mother in self defense.
Ms. Wilkerson testified that Beatty said he killed mother during an argument. Beauty told a
police investigator that his mother started the altercation by slapping him from coming home
drunk. In addition, evidence from the State Writ Hearing reflected no one from the defense team
ever spoke to Twyla Johnson, who would have testified that she was a neighbor of Carolyn Click
and that there was one occasion that Carolyn Click was being aggressive toward Petitioner and
was calling him stupid and retarded. And this situation Carolyn Click was the aggressor. Lee
Ann Wilkerson who has been previously discussed testified at the writ hearing that Ms. Click
was not a kind old lady as portrayed in the trial of this case, but could be mean a vindictive two
faced bitch. She was controlling and manipulative. On one occasion Ms. Wilkerson would have
testified that Petitioner was excited about getting a job and on the day of the job interview
Carolyn Click told him that she was too tired to take him. On one occasion Ms. Wilkerson called
Petitioner’s daughter and said that it was a bad situation that the Petitioner and Carolyn Click
were gonna rip each others heads off and somebody needed to do something about it. Petitioner
38

contends that even though Petitioner requested a finding of fact and conclusion of law on the
issue of ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt/innocent stage the Trial Court did not enter
any findings of fact or conclusions of law even though so requested.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
Petitioner claims that in view of the record that 28 U.S.C. 2254 (D)(1) and (D)(2) do not
bar relief in this cause and his Writ of Habeas Corpus should be granted and Petitioner
discharged from his Unconstitutional confinement restraint and/or relieved of this
unconstitutional sentence of death.
