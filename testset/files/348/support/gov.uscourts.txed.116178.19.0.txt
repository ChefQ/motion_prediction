RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
WITH BRIEF IN SUPPORT
Petitioner Tracy Lane Beatty (Beatty) was properly convicted of the capital
murder of his mother Carolyn Click during the course of a robbery and was
sentenced to death. He now challenges his presumptively valid death sentence
in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 & 2254. For the reasons discussed
below, Beatty fails to demonstrate he is entitled to federal habeas relief.
PETITIONER'S ALLEGATIONS
In this federal habeas proceeding, Beatty raises the following allegations:
1.

His attorneys were ineffective during the punishment stage for failing to
investigate, discover, and present evidence in mitigation, and

2.

His attorneys were ineffective during the guilt-innocence stage for failing
to investigate facts which would have shown this crime was mere murder
rather than capital murder

both in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. Pet., ECF No. 13, at 15. These
requests for relief must fail.

Beatty cannot show that the state courts

unreasonably applied clearly established federal law or that they unreasonably
determined the facts. Also, he fails to present clear and convincing evidence to
overcome the presumption of correctness due to the state court’s factual findings.
Therefore, the requested relief should be denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Beatty was indicted in 2004 in the 241st Judicial District Court of Smith

1

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 3 of 52 PageID #: 173

County, Texas, for the capital offense of murdering Carolyn Click in the course
of committing or attempting to commit the offense of robbery which occurred on
or about November 25, 2003. 1 CR 8 1 ; see Tex. Penal Code Ann. §19.03(a)(2)
(Vernon 2003). In 2004, Beatty was tried before a jury upon a plea of not guilty
and was found guilty of capital murder. 2 CR 237-238. Following a separate
punishment hearing, the jury answered the two special sentencing issues
submitted pursuant to Article 37.071(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal
Procedure. 2 CR 234-236. In accordance with their verdict and state law, on
August 11, 2004, the trial court assessed Beatty’s punishment at death. 2 CR
241.
Beatty appealed his conviction and sentence to the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals, which affirmed. Beatty v. State, 2009 WL 619191 (Tex. Crim.
App. 2009)(not designated for publication). No petition for writ of certiorari was
filed.
The state petition for habeas corpus was filed on January 4, 2007, while
direct appeal was pending. Ex Parte Beatty, No. 59,939-02 (hereinafter Ex parte
Beatty) at 1.2

In 2007, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the

ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. The Court of Criminal Appeals adopted
the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, with some exceptions, in
their denial of Beatty’s application for writ of habeas corpus on May 6, 2009. Ex
parte Beatty (not designated for publication). It is important to note that Beatty
errs in his recitation of the state court’s ruling on the findings of fact and
conclusions of law. Pet., ECF No. 13, at 23-26. The Court of Criminal Appeals
did not adopt findings 60 and 61.
Beatty filed this federal petition for writ of habeas corpus on June 9, 2010.
Pet., ECF No. 13. This response is timely filed.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
I.

Facts of the Crime
[Beatty] and [his mother Carolyn Click] had a volatile and
combative relationship. [Beatty] moved into Click’s house in early
October 2003. Although Click told her next-door neighbor and close
friend, Betty McCarty, that [Beatty] had assaulted her several times
in the past, Click said that she was excited about [Beatty]’s arrival.
Click’s excitement, however, vanished shortly after [Beatty] moved
in. McCarty testified that Click told her that she asked [Beatty] to
leave sometime in October and a second time on November 25,
2003--two days before Thanksgiving and the last day Click was seen
alive. Around 4:00 p.m. on November 25th, Click went to McCarty’s
house. Click was “stressed out and crying.” Click told McCarty that
she was unhappy about the way things were going with [Beatty] and
that she had asked [Beatty] to leave:
[Prosecutor:] What did [Click] tell you?
[McCarty:] That she had asked him to leave that day, and that—she
said, “I put up with all I'm going to put up with, and I had asked

3

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 5 of 52 PageID #: 175

him to leave,” and she was upset about it. And that’s the last time
I saw her.
[Prosecutor:] Did she tell you what time that day she had told
[[Beatty]] to leave?
[McCarty:] No, sir.
Although McCarty initially testified that Click said that she “asked”
[Beatty] to leave, she later clarified that Click said, “I told [[Beatty]]
to leave today.” McCarty did not know exactly when the
conversation with [Beatty] had occurred that day or when [Beatty]
was supposed to leave:
[Defense counsel:] Did [Click] say specifically when . . . she had that
conversation with [[Beatty]] or when he was supposed to leave by?
[McCarty:] No, sir. I saw her at 4:00, and I didn't know anything
about it until that time. So I don't know what time she told him.
[Beatty]’s cousin, Stacey Killough, testified that [Beatty] arrived at
her house later that day between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. driving Click’s
car. Killough testified that the drive from Click’s house to her house
takes approximately forty-five minutes. [Beatty] smelled of alcohol
but was not intoxicated. Noting Click’s absence, Killough became
suspicious because Click was “very protective” of her car and never
let anyone else drive it. In fact, Killough had previously seen Click
refuse to let [Beatty] drive the car. When Killough asked [Beatty]
where Click was, [Beatty] told her that Click was out of town with
a friend and would not be back for a few weeks. Because Killough
was busy, [Beatty] stayed at Killough’s house for only five to ten
minutes.
Lieanna [sic] Wilkerson testified that she lived across the road from
Click and that they had become close friends. Click told Wilkerson
that [Beatty] had assaulted her on several occasions in the past.
Once [Beatty] had “beaten her so severely that he had left her for
dead.” Click was nevertheless excited that [Beatty] was coming to
live with her and hoped that she and [Beatty] could mend their
relationship. After [Beatty] moved in with Click, Wilkerson hired
him to do odd jobs around her house because he was unemployed.
The two became friends, and Wilkerson referred to [Beatty] as
4

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 6 of 52 PageID #: 176

“Trey.” [Beatty] went to her house when he and Click would argue,
which was daily. Toward the end of October and the first part of
November, [Beatty] house-sat for Wilkerson while she was out of
town for several days. Wilkerson extended the offer to [Beatty]
because she was concerned about [Beatty] and Click fighting, and
she thought it would give them an opportunity to separate from
each other. When Wilkerson returned home, [Beatty]’s suitcase was
sitting in the living room. [Beatty] told Wilkerson that Click had
packed his things and brought them over. Wilkerson understood
this to mean that Click had packed [Beatty]’s suitcase in an effort
to kick him out. [Beatty], however, returned to Click’s house and
continued to live with her. According to Wilkerson, [Beatty] and
Click fought daily in November.
Wilkerson described a conversation that she had with [Beatty] in
the middle of November in which he expressed his anger with Click.
[Beatty] told Wilkerson about missing a job interview with an
electric company that he had been very excited about. Click refused
to drive him to the interview, saying that “she just didn't feel like
it.” Wilkerson knew that [Beatty] could not drive himself because
Click refused to let [Beatty], who did not have a driver’s license,
borrow her car. Around the same time, [Beatty] told Wilkerson that
he thought about harming Click:
[Wilkerson:] I know [[Beatty]] had said they were underpinning her
house, and he had gotten upset . . . . And they had gotten into a
huge fight, and she was yelling at him, and he just made an offhand
comment, “I can't believe she handed me that hammer.” He said,
“Because all I could think about was hitting her in the head with it.”
And I said, “Trey,” and he goes, “Well, I couldn't do it.” He said, “If
I shoved her under there, she would have just started stinking.”
[Prosecutor:] She handed it - she being Carolyn Click, handed him
a hammer. He thought about hitting her with it, rolling her
underneath the house, but she would start to stink?
[Wilkerson:] Right. And I just thought he was joking.
[Prosecutor:] Did he ever make any references to hurting her, to
choking her, to hitting her?

5

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 7 of 52 PageID #: 177

[Wilkerson:] Several times he had said he just wanted to shut her
up, that he just wanted to choke her and shut her up, that—they got
into horrible fights.
Wilkerson testified that, on November 25th, [Beatty] ate spaghetti
at her house around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. and stayed at her house until
10:00 p.m., when he went home. The next day, [Beatty] gave
Wilkerson a turkey. He told Wilkerson that he had bought it for
Thanksgiving, but that Click had decided to go out of town with a
man named “Junior,” so they would not need it.
[Beatty] told various people multiple stories about how his mother
died. [Beatty] first claimed to law enforcement officials that he came
home one day and discovered that Junior had killed his mother. In
response to this discovery, he stabbed Junior, disposed of his body
in a lake, and buried his mother in the backyard. [Beatty] even took
officers to a couple of different locations where he claimed to have
submerged Junior's body. [Beatty] told them that he sliced Junior’s
body open so that it would fill with lake water and sink. In a
statement three days later, [Beatty] reiterated the story involving
Junior. But four days after that, [Beatty] told detectives that he
“really didn't mean to” kill his mother: he “came in drunk,” she
“started bitching” at him, he choked her, she fell to the floor, and he
did not realize that she was dead until the next day.
[Beatty] also told his cousin, John Clary, that he had “killed the
bitch.” He told Clary that he “had gone into the house, and there
had been an argument, and [Click] had pulled a gun on him, so he
went to choke her.” When Clary told [Beatty] that he needed to turn
himself in or go back home, [Beatty] inexplicably told Clary that he
could not go back there because his mother “would have the cops
looking for him.”
[Beatty] also told differing stories about his mother’s death to
acquaintances with whom he spent time doing drugs, using Click's
credit and debit cards, and disposing of Click's belongings in the
weeks after her death. He initially told these acquaintances that his
"aunt" had died and left him her property. He later told them "a
friend" killed his mother and that he killed the friend to cover it up.
He also said that he had killed "his mother's boyfriend" after
6

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 8 of 52 PageID #: 178

discovering that he had killed Click and that he buried both bodies
in the woods.
[Beatty] gave differing stories to Wilkerson as well. First, he told
her that he came home to find Click dead. Junior killed Click and
attacked [Beatty], so [Beatty] killed him. He then described in great
detail how he disposed of Junior’s body by submerging it in the lake.
He said that he buried his mother. Later, [Beatty] told Wilkerson
that he hired a friend to kill Click and that he then killed the friend.
Finally, [Beatty] said that he killed Click on the night of November
25th, when he returned home from having dinner at Wilkerson's
house. Wilkerson testified:
The very last thing that—incident that [[Beatty]] told me what
happened is he said when he left my house, he went directly across
the street to her house and that she was waiting for him, and that
when he came through the door, they had a horrible fight . . . .
[Beatty] told Wilkerson that he ended up choking Click until she fell
to the floor. He said that he did not realize that she was dead until
he woke up the next morning and saw her lying in the same place
on the floor.

Punishment Evidence
In the punishment phase, the State presented evidence regarding Beatty’s

extensive criminal history, including drug possession, theft, weapons possession,
a brutal assault against a child under two years of age, and prior assaults
against his mother, a correctional officer, and others. 46 RR 49-59; SX 64, 150,
151, 152, 153, 156, 157. When Beatty was booked into jail on the instant offense,
a handcuff key was amongst his personal property and was introduced into
evidence during the penalty phase. 42 RR 77-78; SX 155. A correctional officer
7

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 9 of 52 PageID #: 179

testified about the prevalence of violence in prison and specifically discussed
Beatty’s membership in a prison gang, a physical altercation he had with Beatty,
and a shank that was found on Beatty. 46 RR 127-130, 134-135; SX 158, 161169. Royce Smithey, an investigator, testified about the potential for inmate
violence in prison. 47 RR 25-35. Dr. Tynus McNeel and Dr. Edward Gripon
testified that Beatty would likely pose a future danger to society. 47 RR 160179, 190-201.
After the State rested, an ex parte hearing took place on the record
between the defense counsel, Beatty and the trial court. 48 RR 3-22. In this
proceeding, Beatty’s trial counsel enumerated the steps they had taken to
prepare for the penalty phase. A psychiatrist and a psychologist had been
appointed to assist the defense, but neither found any mitigating factors and
indeed, indicated their opinion was that Beatty would pose a future danger. Id.
at 4-7.

Trial counsel pointed out that they, their investigator, and their

mitigation expert all attempted to locate any possible mitigation witnesses
without success. Id. at 7-10. Beatty himself indicated that he understood the
position his defense team was in, and concurred that he did not want to testify
nor did he want two possible witnesses called. Id. at 17-21.
Before the jury, the defense rested without presenting any punishment
evidence. 49 RR 18.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
I.

Anti-terrorism And Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”)
Beatty filed his federal writ petition in 2010, thus review is governed by

the federal habeas statutes as amended by the AEDPA. See Lindh v. Murphy,
521 U.S. 320, 335-36 (1997). As an initial matter, habeas relief is inappropriate
if a claim is not cognizable on federal review. Beatty, confined pursuant to a
state court judgment, is entitled to relief “only on the ground that he is in
custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.”
28 U.S.C. § 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991).
Under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas
corpus for a defendant convicted under a state judgment unless the adjudication
of the relevant constitutional claim by the state court, (1) “‘was contrary to’
federal law then clearly established in the holdings of” the Supreme Court; or (2)
“‘involved an unreasonable application of’” clearly established Supreme Court
precedent; or (3) “‘was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts’ in
light of the record before the state court.” Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770,
785 (2011) (quoting (Terry) Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000)); 28
U.S.C. § 2254(d). The Supreme Court has explained that a state court decision
is “contrary” to established federal law if the state court “applies a rule that
contradicts the governing law set forth in [the Supreme Court’s] cases,” or

9

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 11 of 52 PageID #: 181

confronts facts that are “materially indistinguishable” from a relevant Supreme
Court precedent, yet reaches an opposite result. Williams, 529 U.S. at 405–06.
A “run-of-the-mill” state court decision applying the correct Supreme Court
rule to the facts of a particular case is to be reviewed under the “unreasonable
application” clause. Williams, 529 U.S. at 406. To this end, a state court
unreasonably applies Supreme Court precedent only if it correctly identifies the
governing precedent but unreasonably applies it to the facts of a particular case.
Id. at 407–09. And as the Supreme Court recently described this deferential
standard, in order to determine if the state court made an unreasonable
application, a federal court “must determine what arguments or theories
supported or . . . could have supported, the state court’s decision; and then it
must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those
arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this
Court.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786 (emphasis added). Indeed, this is the “only
question that matters under § 2254(d)(1).” Id.
Thus, “a state court’s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes
federal habeas relief so long as ‘fairminded jurists could disagree’” on the
correctness of the state court’s decision. Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786 (quoting
Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)); see also Woodford v. Visciotti,
537 U.S. 19, 27 (2002) (federal habeas relief is only merited where the state-

10

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 12 of 52 PageID #: 182

court decision is both incorrect and objectively unreasonable, “whether or not
[this Court] would reach the same conclusion”). Moreover, “evaluating whether
a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule’s specificity.
The more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes
in case-by-case determinations.” Alvarado, 541 U.S. at 664. This is particularly
true when reviewing a state court’s application of Strickland v. Washington, 466
U.S. 668 (1984), which when analyzed in conjunction with § 2254(d), creates a
difficult to surmount, “doubly” deferential assumption in favor of the state court
denial. Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786.
“It bears repeating that even a strong case for relief does not mean the
state court's contrary conclusion was unreasonable.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786.
If this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to
be. As amended by AEDPA, § 2254(d) stops short of imposing a
complete bar on federal court relitigation of claims already rejected
in state proceedings. It preserves authority to issue the writ in
cases where there is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree
that the state court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s precedents.
It goes no farther. Section 2254(d) reflects the view that habeas
corpus is a “guard against extreme malfunctions in the state
criminal justice systems,” not a substitute for ordinary error
correction through appeal.
Id. (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).
Moreover, it is the state court’s “ultimate decision” that is to be tested for
unreasonableness, and not every jot of its reasoning. Neal v. Puckett, 286 F.3d
230, 246 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc); Santellan v. Cockrell, 271 F.3d 190, 193 (5th

11

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 13 of 52 PageID #: 183

Cir. 2001); see also Catalan v. Cockrell, 315 F.3d 491, 493 (5th Cir. 2002) (“. .
. we review only the state court’s decision, not its reasoning or written opinion
. . . .”).

Indeed, state courts are presumed to “know and follow the law.”

Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 24.

And, even where the state court fails to cite to

applicable Supreme Court precedent or is unaware of such precedent, AEDPA’s
deferential standard of review nevertheless applies “so long as neither the
reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts [Supreme Court
precedent].” Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002); Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786.
If the Supreme Court has not “broken sufficient legal ground to establish
[a] . . . constitutional principle, the lower federal courts cannot themselves
establish such a principle with clarity sufficient to satisfy the AEDPA bar” under
either the contrary to or unreasonable application standard. Williams, 529 U.S.
at 381. Stated differently:
As a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court, a
state prisoner must show that the state court’s ruling on the claim
being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that
there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing
law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.
Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786–87 (emphasis added). And a federal court must be
wary of circumstances in which it must “extend a [legal] rationale” of the
Supreme Court “before it can apply to the facts at hand . . .” because such a
process suggests the proposed rule is not clearly established. Alvarado, 541 U.S.
at 666.

12

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 14 of 52 PageID #: 184

AEDPA also provides that the state court’s factual findings “shall be
presumed to be correct” unless the petitioner carries “the burden of rebutting the
presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.” 28 U.S.C. §
2254(e)(1). “The presumption of correctness not only applies to explicit findings
of fact, but it also applies to those unarticulated findings which are necessary to
the state court’s conclusions of mixed law and fact.” Valdez v. Cockrell, 274 F.3d
941, 948 n.11 (5th Cir. 2001).
And except for the narrow exceptions contained in § 2254(e)(2), the
evidence upon which a petitioner would challenge a state court fact finding must
have been presented to the state court. Because a federal habeas court is
prohibited from granting relief unless a decision was based on “an unreasonable
determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court
proceeding,” it follows that demonstrating the incorrectness of a state court fact
finding based upon evidence not presented to the state court would be of no avail
to a habeas petitioner. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).
Finally, where a habeas petitioner has failed to fully develop the factual
bases of his claims in state court, he is precluded from further factual
development in federal court unless (1) his claims rely on a new rule of
constitutional law or a factual predicate previously undiscoverable through the
exercise of due diligence; and (2) he establishes by clear and convincing evidence

13

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 15 of 52 PageID #: 185

that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found him
guilty. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2). A failure to meet this standard of “diligence” will
bar a federal evidentiary hearing in the absence of a convincing claim of actual
innocence that can only be established by newly discovered evidence. (Michael)
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436 (2000). For example, a petitioner’s failure
to present controverted, previously unresolved factual issues to the state court
is sufficient to constitute “failure” under the plain meaning of § 2254(e)(2). Id.
at 433. But even if the petitioner can meet the foregoing standard, it is within
this Court’s discretion to deny a hearing if sufficient facts exist to make an
informed decision on the merits. Clark v. Johnson, 227 F.3d 273, 284-85 (5th
Cir. 2000).
II.

Summary Judgment Standard In Habeas Corpus Cases
“As a general principle, Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

relating to summary judgment, applies with equal force in the context of habeas
corpus cases.” Clark v. Johnson, 202 F.3d 760, 764 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing Rule
11, Rules Governing § 2254 Cases; Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(a)(2)). Summary judgment
is proper if the record shows that “there is no genuine issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”
Martinez v. Johnson, 255 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Turner v. Houma
Mun. Fire & Police Civil Serv. Bd., 229 F.3d 478, 482 (5th Cir. 2000)); Fed. R.

14

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 16 of 52 PageID #: 186

Civ. P. 56 (c).
In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court views the evidence
through “the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden.” Anderson v. Liberty
Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 254 (1986). Thus, the application of the summary judgment
standard to a habeas corpus case differs from its application in other civil cases
to the extent that habeas’ substantive evidentiary rules or burdens differ. In the
ordinary civil context, courts must construe the facts of the case in favor of the
non-moving party. Id. at 255. In the habeas context, however, where factual
allegations have been adversely resolved by express or implied findings of the
state courts and the petitioner fails to demonstrate, by clear and convincing
evidence, that § 2254(e)(1)’s presumption of correctness should not apply, it is
inappropriate for the court to resolve the facts of the case in petitioner’s favor.
Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 432 (1983).

Properly Found Beatty Failed to Show That Counsel Was
Ineffective.
Beatty contends his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because some

witnesses were not contacted by the trial team and others who did testify were

15

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 17 of 52 PageID #: 187

not asked the right questions. Pet., ECF No. 13, at 38. Beatty explicitly limits
his claim to ineffective assistance of counsel during punishment, not guiltinnocence.

Id. at 27, 35, 38-39.

He contends that the state court both

unreasonably applied federal law and unreasonably determined the facts before
it. Pet., ECF No. 13, at 22. Beatty failed to demonstrate either deficiency or
prejudice to the state court, which properly denied relief after a full hearing
including the testimony of the defense team and other witnesses. SHCR at 102103. Because his attorneys conducted a thorough investigation into Beatty’s
possible mitigation case, and because Beatty himself instructed his attorneys not
to present any evidence during the penalty phase, the state court’s decision was
sound.
A.

Legal standards applying to ineffective assistance claims

To establish deficient performance, a person challenging a conviction must
show that “counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). A court
considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a “strong presumption”
that counsel’s representation was within the “wide range” of reasonable
professional assistance. Harrington, 131 S.Ct. at 171; Strickland, 466 U.S. at
689. The challenger’s burden is to show “that counsel made errors so serious
that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by

16

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 18 of 52 PageID #: 188

the Sixth Amendment.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.
With respect to prejudice, a challenger must demonstrate “a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the
proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability
sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694. It is not enough
“to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the
proceeding.” Id. at 693. Counsel’s errors must be “so serious as to deprive the
defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.” Id. at 687.
“Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy task.” Padilla v.
Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1485 (2010). “An ineffective-assistance claim can
function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not
presented at trial, and so the Strickland standard must be applied with
scrupulous care, lest ‘intrusive post-trial inquiry’ threaten the integrity of the
very adversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.” Harrington, 131
S.Ct. at 788, citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689-690. “Even under de novo review,
the standard for judging counsel’s representation is a most deferential one.
Unlike a later reviewing court, the attorney observed the relevant proceedings,
knew of materials outside the record, and interacted with the client, with
opposing counsel, and with the judge. It is ‘all too tempting’ to ‘second-guess
counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.’” Harrington, 131 S.Ct.

17

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 19 of 52 PageID #: 189

at 788( citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689); see also Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685,
702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 372 (1993). “The question is
whether an attorney’s representation amounted to incompetence under
‘prevailing professional norms,’ not whether it deviated from best practices or
most common custom.” Harrington, 131 S.Ct. at 788 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S.
at 690).
Establishing that a state court’s application of Strickland was
unreasonable under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult. The standards created by
Strickland and § 2254(d) are both “highly deferential,” id., at 689; Lindh v.
Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and when the two apply in tandem,
review is “doubly” so.

Harrington, 131 S.Ct. at 788 (citing Knowles v.

Mirzayance, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420 (2009)). The Strickland standard is a general
one, so the range of reasonable applications is substantial. Knowles, 129 S.Ct.
at 1420. “Federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating
unreasonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness under § 2254(d).
When § 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s actions were
reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that
counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Harrington, 131 S.Ct. at
788.
Although the state court did not specifically refer to Supreme Court

18

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 20 of 52 PageID #: 190

precedent by name, it examined the evidence and evaluated the case under the
appropriate rubric of deficiency and prejudice.

In order to determine if the state

court made an unreasonable application, a federal court “must determine what
arguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court’s
decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could
disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a
prior decision of this Court.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786 (emphasis added).
Indeed, this is the “only question that matters under § 2254(d)(1).”

Id.

Moreover, it is the state court’s “ultimate decision” that is to be tested for
unreasonableness, and not every jot of its reasoning. Neal, 286 F.3d at 246;
Santellan, 271 F.3d at 193; see also Catalan, 315 F.3d at 493 (“. . . we review
only the state court’s decision, not its reasoning or written opinion . . . .”). Even
where the state court fails to cite to applicable Supreme Court precedent,
AEDPA’s deferential standard of review nevertheless applies “so long as neither
the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts [Supreme
Court precedent].” Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002); Richter, 131 S. Ct. at
786.
With respect to defense counsel's performance, the Court of Criminal
Appeals held that trial counsel was not deficient and had conducted an adequate
investigation, and that the additional information was not prejudicially omitted

19

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 21 of 52 PageID #: 191

from the jury’s consideration. Supp. CR at 82.3
B.

Beatty’s arguments on deficiency fail to overcome the
presumption of correctness of the state court’s findings of
fact and credibility determinations.

Beatty loosely complains:
Although purportedly several witness [sic] were contacted by the
trial team, other witnesses were not. Witnesses that could describe
the tumultuous relationship between Petitioner and his mother, and
witnesses who could describe the eccentricity and bizarreness of Ms.
Click’s personality were never contacted. There [sic] were available.
. . had [defense counsel] known of the testimony of the Day children,
he would have introduced said testimony. However, upon being
questioned by the State of Texas, “he crawfished” [sic] on this
contention and stated he would not have offered this testimony
[because] the testimony [would] be more aggravating than
mitigating. . . . [T]he mitigation investigator explained she just
didn’t have enough time to do what she felt needed to be done and
consequently decisions had to be made where they could ‘get the
biggest bang for their buck.’ . . . There were no witnesses presented
by the defense. . .
Pet., ECF No. 13, at 38-39.
In order to establish that counsel were ineffective due to a failure to
investigate the case, Beatty must do more than merely allege a failure to
investigate—he must state with specificity what the investigation would have
revealed, what specific evidence would have been disclosed, and how the
evidence would have altered the outcome of the trial. Anderson v. Collins, 18

“Supp. CR” refers to the Supplemental Clerk’s Record which comprises
Beatty’s second state writ, No. 59,939-02, followed by page number(s).
20

F.3d 1208, 1221 (5th Cir 1994); Rose v. Johnson, 141 F.Supp.2d 661, 691 (S.D.
Tex. 2001). Beatty fails to do so. Although he contends the state court both
unreasonably applied federal law and unreasonably determined the facts, he
focuses on his factual attack and never explains his unreasonable application
argument. Pet., ECF No. 13, at 27 et seq.
The witnesses that trial counsel did not contact, according to Beatty, were
his step-siblings Chad and Kamie Day 4 , stepfather Tim Day, and acquaintances
Leanne Wilkerson and Twyla Johnson.

Pet., ECF No. 13, at 38.

He also

mentions in passing “medical records regarding Ms. Click’s visits to the
hospital.” Id. at 18. Beatty says these witnesses and documents would have
described “the tumultuous relationship between [Beatty] and his mother, and .
. . the eccentricity and bizarreness of Ms. Click’s personality.” Id. Finally,
Beatty contends that any aggravating evidence from these witnesses was
already before the jury, so counsel had nothing to lose by presenting these
individuals. Id. at 39. But according to Strickland, counsel is entitled to make
reasonable decisions that make particular investigations unnecessary. 466 U.S.
at 691. Here, counsel struggled to find witnesses who could sponsor the things

4

Beatty mentions counsel not calling “the Day kids” but he presented no
testimony from stepsister Kim Day Patterson at the state writ hearing. Supp. CR at
75. As he only presented evidence about what Kamie and Chad might have offered, he
can only complain of deficiency related to their omitted testimony.
21

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 23 of 52 PageID #: 193

Beatty said about his background and relationship with his mother, but were
unable to find them in part because of time limitations and in part because
Beatty was not forthcoming with information. Supp. CR at 71-72. Counsel also
reasonably hesitated to attack the victim for her “eccentricity and bizarreness”
because it would have offended the jury and increased the risk of a death
sentence. Id. at 69, 72.
1.
Proposed testimony from the Day step-family was more
aggravating than mitigating.
The trial court judge made findings of fact based on testimony from these
witnesses during the state court evidentiary hearing. Beatty’s attorneys made
calculated choices about what kind of mitigating evidence they would consider
using. Supp. CR at 71. Defense counsel would not have presented any of these
three former family members because they were more aggravating than
mitigating. Id. at 72, 76.
The court found Beatty’s step-sibling Chad to be credible and found that
his testimony would have presented significantly more aggravating than
mitigating evidence to the jury. Supp. CR at 74. Although Chad would have
painted a dire picture of Ms. Click’s treatment of Chad and his sister Kamie, the
state court believed it would not assist Beatty’s case because Beatty seemed not
to care about his siblings being beaten and had done nothing to intercede on
Chad’s behalf. Id. Further, Chad observed Ms. Click to show favoritism towards
22

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 24 of 52 PageID #: 194

Beatty and never observed her abuse him. Id. Even worse, he would have told
a jury that Beatty had thrown Ms. Click against a refrigerator and knocked her
unconscious. Id.
The court further found that step-sibling Kamie Day Bentley was abused
by Ms. Click in Beatty’s presence, but that he only intervened once. Id. at 72,
74.

Kamie said Ms. Click never beat Beatty.

Id.

Kamie additionally

contradicted the current defense investigator’s sworn account of Kamie’s story,
and the court found that Beatty did not protect her and her siblings from Ms.
Click. Id. As a result of Kamie’s testimony, the court found that Kamie was a
credible witness who would have presented significantly more aggravating than
mitigating evidence. Id.
Based on the testimony of Tim Day, Ms. Click’s ex-husband, the state
court found that counsel was not deficient because Day, too, would have
presented significantly more credible aggravating than mitigating evidence.
Supp CR at 73. Tim Day explained that he could not think of one good thing to
say about his stepson Beatty, that Beatty had been kicked out of the home by
Ms. Click, that Beatty stole her car and crashed it, and that Beatty was
apparently unaffected by his mother’s behavior; indeed, that she favored him
over his stepsiblings and catered to him. Id. Mr. Day believed Ms. Click to be
a lenient, understanding, and helpful mother.

23

Id.

He also disputes the

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 25 of 52 PageID #: 195

statement attributed to him by the current defense investigator, Ms. Stillwell,
who indicated that he witnessed Ms. Click abusing Beatty. Id. Mr. Day believed
there was no connection between Ms. Click’s treatment of the children and
Beatty’s decision to murder her almost thirty years later. Id.
Because the two Day step-siblings would be unable to testify that Beatty
was himself beaten, that Beatty seemed at all affected by Ms. Click’s abuse of
the other children, or that he’d intervened more than once, the court reasonably
held that their testimony was not so mitigating that it merited being presented
to the jury or that its absence prejudiced Beatty. Supp. CR at 72-74. The
stepfather was unable to think of anything good to say about Beatty. The former
stepfamily would have been double-edged witnesses that counsel would not have
chosen to call to the stand. Furthermore, counsel tried to find them but were
unable to, in part because of Beatty’s recalcitrance. The state court properly
found that Beatty failed to demonstrate deficiency on counsel’s part for failing
to push harder to find these witnesses, and failed to show prejudice from their
absence. Supp. CR at 82. Beatty fails to show that fairminded jurists would
agree that the state court erroneously determined that his claim lacks merit.
Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786; Yarborough, 541 U.S. at 664.
In

addition, Beatty’s current theory of mitigation is internally

contradictory—Beatty contends he murdered his mother in a fit of rage,

24

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 26 of 52 PageID #: 196

implicitly in reaction to her abuse in the past, yet Beatty was the favored child
who cold-heartedly

observed repeated beatings of his siblings but only

interceded one time. Supp. CR at 72-76. The state court found that counsel was
concerned about prejudicing any chance Beatty might have for a life sentence,
resulting from a juror’s residual doubt, by presenting evidence that was both
aggravating and mitigating. Id. at 72.
Beatty also argues that Holly Randall, the trial mitigation specialist,
proves his ineffectiveness complaint, because she knew he had stepsiblings but
did not explore that avenue. It is highly relevant that Beatty never told his
attorneys to specifically talk with his stepfamily, though his attorneys had
followed up on every potential witness to whom Beatty referred. Supp. CR at
72.

Ms. Randall interviewed Beatty more than once and spent hours in

preparation for trial. Id. at 81. Beatty never told Ms. Randall to speak to his
Day or Wyatt stepsiblings.

Id. at 82.

Ms. Randall was only appointed two

months prior to trial, but in that two months the defense team accomplished five
months’ worth of work. Supp. CR at 82. The time limitations were not the fault
of Beatty’s counsel, and every defense team has to deal with limitations on
resources and time.5 Beatty’s defense team was aware of the existence of his

5

Beatty never claims that his attorneys were ineffective for moving for her
appointment too late and indeed, such a claim would be barred as unexhausted
because it was never presented in state court.
25

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 27 of 52 PageID #: 197

stepfamily. However, counsel reasonably would have chosen not to call these
individuals to testify, because their testimony was more harmful than beneficial.
Supp. CR at 76.
Beatty’s postconviction investigator, Sherry Stillwell, did not testify at the
state hearing. Id. at 83. Nonetheless, based on her affidavit and the sworn
testimony of other witnesses, the state court found that she was “overly biased”
because her statements contained “intentionally one-sided [and] exaggerated
accounts of the witness interviews she conducted.” Id. She stated legal and
medical conclusions that “she simply is not qualified to make.” Id. The state
court concluded “her entire affidavit should be discounted as unreliable and
misleading, perhaps intentionally so.” Id.
Beatty fails to show that all reasonable jurists would disagree with the
state court’s conclusion that counsel was not deficient and that Beatty was not
prejudiced. Id. at 82. A reasonable jurist could find the state court correctly
viewed counsel’s choices to be logical and strategic. Likewise, reasonable jurists
could agree that Beatty was not prejudiced by the absence of these witnesses.
2.
Proposed testimony from Twyla Johnson and Leanna
Wilkerson would also have been detrimental to Beatty’s case.
Beatty says his attorneys should have been aware, but were not, of helpful
testimony available from two other women: his acquaintance Twyla Johnson,
who once witnessed Ms. Click calling Beatty names, Pet., ECF No. 13, at 20, and
26

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 28 of 52 PageID #: 198

Leanna Wilkerson, the neighbor, who could have testified about the relationship
between Beatty and Ms. Click. Id. Specifically, Wilkerson could have testified
that Ms. Click frequently argued with Beatty, that she was not a “poor, little
weak disabled lady,” and that she could be “a mean cold-hearted bitch.” Id.
Also, Wilkerson could have testified about Ms. Click not driving Beatty to his job
interview, leaving him disappointed and upset. Id.
The state court found that Twyla Johnson could have told the jury that on
one occasion, Ms. Click called Beatty names in a hateful tone of voice. Supp. CR
at 76. However, the state court also found that Ms. Johnson never witnessed
any other confrontation between Ms. Click and Beatty, that she’d never heard
Ms. Click talk to anyone like that before, and that the argument she heard did
not justify Beatty killing his mother. Id. Further, Ms. Johnson would have told
a jury that Beatty enjoyed Thanksgiving with Ms. Johnson’s family and friends,
shortly after murdering his mother, and that she did not know he had buried his
mother in the backyard just one day prior to the turkey dinner. Id. Given the
time constraints and Beatty’s lack of emphasis on Ms. Johnson’s potential as a
witness, a reasonable jurist could agree with the state court that defense counsel
were not deficient for failing to contact her. Likewise, the state court properly
balanced the slim potential mitigation impact that at one time, unconnected to
the murder, Beatty’s mother had called him names against the aggravating

27

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 29 of 52 PageID #: 199

circumstances that Ms. Click did not speak that way to others or Beatty outside
of that instance, and that Beatty had callously dined with Ms. Johnson’s family
at Thanksgiving only a day after burying his mother, and concluded that Beatty
failed to prove he was prejudiced. Id. at 82.
Ms. Wilkerson, a neighbor, testified at trial. She described the argument
between Beatty and his mother, and told the jury how Ms. Click’s refusal to
drive Beatty to the interview had hurt and angered him. Beatty v. State at *1-4.
The state court found that she was a “biased witness who may let her
relationship with [Beatty] taint her testimony to paint him in a better light.” Id.
at 77. Ms. Wilkerson testified that Ms. Click was “eccentric,” and she had heard
Beatty arguing with his mother on occasion; that Beatty had stolen a gun from
Ms. Wilkerson; and that Beatty told Ms. Wilkerson three different versions of a
story to account for his mother’s death. Id. at 77. However, Ms. Wilkerson never
saw anything that made Ms. Click deserve her fate at Beatty’s hands. Id.
Reasonable jurists would agree with the state court that defense counsel
were not deficient for failing to question Ms. Wilkerson regarding Beatty’s
relationship with his mother. The state court found Ms. Wilkerson’s testimony
to be lacking in credibility because of her personal bias in favor of Beatty.
Likewise, the state court properly balanced the mitigation testimony from Ms.
Wilkerson that Beatty’s mother did not drive him to a job interview, against the

28

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 30 of 52 PageID #: 200

aggravating testimony from her that Wilkerson believed the victim was a coldhearted bitch, both of which could easily have cut against the credibility of the
defense and any possible sympathy or residual doubt emanating from the jury.
Id. at 82. Beatty fails to address this even in passing. The Supreme Court has
held many times that a federal court is not free to substitute its own judgment
as to the credibility of witnesses for that of the state court fact finder. Maggio
v. Fulford, 462 U.S. 111, 113 (1983). Further, in Marshall v. Lonberger, the
Supreme Court held that the credibility choices made by the state trial courts
may not be redetermined by the reviewing federal court when that court has not
viewed the witnesses’ testimony. 459 U.S. at 435.
If counsel had presented these witnesses, Beatty would now be arguing
that that decision was ineffective because it added new elements of aggravation.
Beatty claims counsel he should have investigated and introduced these
witnesses because he had nothing to lose—all the negative things these people
could say were already before the jury. Pet., ECF No. 13, at 39. Not only is this
patently untrue, it is not clearly established federal law. “With no Supreme
Court

precedent

establishing

a

‘nothing

to

lose’

standard

for

ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, habeas relief cannot be granted
pursuant to § 2254(d)(1) based on such a standard.” Knowles, 129 S.Ct. at 1419.
In addition, his assertion is unbriefed and unsupported by any record

29

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 31 of 52 PageID #: 201

citation. See Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(4) (appellant must identify “the facts relevant
to the issues presented for review, with appropriate references to the record,” or
to record excerpts filed in an appendix); see also Shell Offshore, Inc. v. Director,
Office of Workers' Compensation, 122 F.3d 312, 317 (5th Cir. 1997) (recognizing
that a party who inadequately briefs an issue waives the claim.) Similarly, Fifth
Circuit rules provide that “[e]very assertion in briefs regarding matter in the
record shall be supported by a reference to the page number of the original
record where the matter relied upon is to be found.” 5th Cir. R. 28.2.3. In fact,
had these witnesses testified at trial, the jury would also have learned (to
Beatty’s detriment) that:
•

Beatty did not care his stepsiblings were beaten by his mother (if this was
in fact true);

•

Beatty did not intercede when Chad was abused and only once intervened
on Kamie’s behalf, allowing all other incidents to proceed unchecked;

•

Beatty was favored by his mother, in fact was “doted on” and “catered to,”
and was not abused by her, according to both Tim, Chad and Kamie;

•

Beatty threw his mother against the refrigerator and knocked her
unconscious;

•

His mother had to throw Beatty out of the house at one point;

•

Beatty stole his mother’s car and crashed it, was “very high strung [and]
hot-headed” and “exhibited the classic signs of drug abuse”;

•

Beatty tried to shoot a neighbor’s dog and instead hit their house;

•

Beatty was unaffected by his mother’s odd behavior and didn’t seem to
care very much about her problems;

•

His stepfather was unable to say anything nice about Beatty;

•

His stepfather believed there was no connection between the relationship
Beatty had with his mother, who did not want to punish him and was
30

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 32 of 52 PageID #: 202

lenient, understanding, and helpful, and Beatty’s murder of her years
later.
Supp. CR at 70-82. By way of comparison, had counsel done as Beatty now
wishes, at best the jury could have learned that Ms. Click called him names, did
not drive him to a job interview, was not a weak little old lady, and had abused
his stepsiblings. Id. This is insufficient to demonstrate deficiency or prejudice.
3.

Counsel strategically declined not to offer Ms. Click’s
medical records.

Beatty acknowledges that his defense team discussed Ms. Click’s medical
records and made a strategic decision not to attempt to offer them. Pet., ECF
No. 13, at 18. Beatty never explains what was in these records, never provides
them to this Court, and does not articulate a reason why these medical records
have any relevance. Beatty failed to adequately brief his claim and has,
accordingly, waived it on appeal. See Green v. Johnson, 160 F.3d 1029, 1036 n.2
(“It is not the job of an appellate court to go on a fishing expedition through the
record to find facts favoring or disfavoring an appellant’s arguments. Rather, it
is the job of a party before this court to supply in its brief relevant record cites
in order that this court may properly review his arguments.”); see also, e.g.,
Cavallini v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 44 F.3d 256, 260 n. 9 (5th Cir.1995)
(holding that “failure to provide any legal or factual analysis of an issue results
in waiver”); United States v. Maldonado, 42 F.3d 906, 910 n. 7 (5th Cir.1995)
(reasoning that failure to do more than vaguely refer to an issue constitutes
31

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 33 of 52 PageID #: 203

waiver).
In the state court, Beatty referred to Ms. Click’s alleged mental condition
and drug/alcohol problems as uninvestigated mitigation evidence. Supp. CR at
70. If this is what he now hints at, the state court properly discounted his
position, finding that a fully-considered strategical decision was made by the
defense not to present this evidence. Id. at 83. Dr. Gripon, who was found to be
a very credible witness, reviewed the entire record and did not see any medical
documentation to substantiate Ms. Click attempted suicide while pregnant or
that she abused her medications. Id. at 80. The state court found that Beatty
had failed to present any medical evidence to substantiate claims that his
mother suffered from various medical or mental health issues. Id. at 83. Ms.
Randall, the mitigation specialist, prepared a medical outline for Ms. Click. Id.
The defense team had “very serious” discussions about Ms. Click’s “many
abdominal surgeries [and . . . ] extensive medical problems unrelated to
substance abuse” and decided not to present evidence of this as a strategic
matter. Id. at 80-82. Beatty fails to show deficiency or prejudice, and fails to
show why this Court should not accord the required deference to the state court’s
dismissal of this subclaim.
4.

The state court’s findings on deficiency are entitled to
deference.

The state court found that both defense attorneys were experienced and
32

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 34 of 52 PageID #: 204

competent in the defense of capital murder cases, and that both were very
credible witnesses.

Id. at 65, 69.

The defense team also included court-

appointed mental health experts, an investigator, and a mitigation specialist.
Id. at 65. The state court found that throughout preparation for trial, the
defense attorneys were unable to find a witness who could recount the details of
the relationship between Beatty and Ms. Click.

Supp. CR at 71. Counsel

followed up on all names provided them by Beatty, but none of the witnesses
proved to be more mitigating than aggravating. Id. at 72. Counsel used an
“extensively experienced criminal investigator” who was a credible witness. Id.
at 77. Beatty was “not very helpful” and “was very hard to communicate with”
and the defense team generally “had a difficult time getting [Beatty] to provide
any information.” Id. at 78. The investigator stated that after eight weeks of
travel through two states he was unable to find a single person to testify
positively about Beatty. Id.
The investigator focused a “large part” of his investigation on Ms. Click’s
alleged abuse with the punishment phase in mind, as “the guilt or innocence
part wasn’t looking too good” for Beatty. Id. The investigator spoke with
witnesses who indicated that Ms. Click was not abusive towards Beatty. Id.
Further, the investigator reported back the results of his investigation, both the
good and the bad, and had either located or attempted to locate every character

witness Beatty had mentioned. Id. Beatty did not give his defense team any
information regarding his stepsiblings.

Id. at 70.

Nor did Beatty tell his

attorneys that he’d intervened in a beating by Ms. Click. Id. at 72. His team
investigated everyone Beatty mentioned, but nothing Beatty told them led to a
witness who would be more mitigating than aggravating. Id.
The state court found that counsel had legal and strategic reasons for their
choices, which insulate them from the accusation of deficiency, and that Beatty
failed to overcome the strong presumption that counsel’s conduct was reasonable
and professional. Supp CR at 82. First, Beatty did not advise his team that his
former stepfamily would be able to confirm his tale of abuse at his mother’s
hands. Id. This alone makes it reasonable that counsel did not prioritize finding
and communicating with them.

Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691 (“The

reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be determined or substantially
influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions.”) Presumably if a client
killed their mother because of childhood abuse, the client would tell their
attorney if anyone was able to substantiate such a claim. And if they did not, a
reasonable attorney or investigator could conclude that there were no witnesses
able to sponsor such a tale.

Especially because the defense team labored

diligently to find someone, anyone, who could say anything helpful at all, and
failed. Supp. CR at 73-82.

Second, Beatty himself indicated to the trial judge, in a hearing outside
the presence of the jury, that he understood the position his defense team was
in, and concurred that he did not want to testify nor did he want two possible
witnesses called. 48 RR 17-21. It is unclear from the record the identity of these
witnesses, but Beatty cannot block his attorney’s efforts and later claim that the
resulting

performance

was

constitutionally

deficient.

See

Sonnier

v.

Quarterman, 476 F.3d 349, 362 (5th Cir.2007); Autry v. McKaskle, 727 F.2d 358,
361 (5th Cir. 1984); see also Roberts v. Dretke, 381 F.3d 491, 499-500 (5th Cir.
2004) (counsel cannot be ineffective for acquiescing to a defendant’s selfdestructive instructions regarding trial strategy after first challenging those
decisions and determining that defendant was competent to make them) (opinion
after grant of appeal). Indeed, in Schriro v. Landrigan, the Supreme Court
rejected the very claim Beatty is raising. 550 U.S. 465 (2007). Specifically, the
Court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to present mitigating
evidence because the defendant informed the trial court that he instructed his
lawyer not to present mitigating evidence, namely evidence from the defendant’s
birth mother that she used drugs during her pregnancy.

Id. at 476-78.

Landrigan forecloses Beatty’s allegation.
Third, counsel had strategic and logistical reasons for conducting the
investigation as they did.

The defense team pursued family members,

35

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 37 of 52 PageID #: 207

acquaintances, and every individual on the State’s discovery list, and reviewed
medical and incarceration records and relied on the input of psychological and
medical professionals as well as a criminal investigator and a mitigation
specialist regarding the case, despite Beatty’s consistent recalcitrance to discuss
possible witnesses. Beatty was a loner without many friends and not a single
person could be found to testify on his behalf. Supp. CR at 78. The investigation
counsel did undertake was sufficient to ascertain what could be presented to the
jury. Unfortunately, none of it was any help, and what Beatty presented to the
state court on postconviction review is more hurtful than helpful. Id. at 82.
Fourth, the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held a strategic decision not to
pursue and introduce evidence which possesses both mitigating and aggravating
qualities is objectively reasonable. See Hopkins v. Cockrell, 325 F.3d 579, 586
(5th Cir. 2003) (holding a tactical decision not to pursue and present potentially
mitigating evidence on the ground that it is double-edged in nature is objectively
reasonable); Ladd v. Cockrell, 311 F.3d at 360 (recognizing where evidence is
double-edged in nature it is uncertain whether reasonable counsel would have
used same had it been available); Foster v. Johnson, 293 F.3d 766, 778-79 (5th
Cir. 2002) (holding a tactical decision not to pursue and present potential
mitigating evidence on the grounds it is double-edged in nature is objectively
reasonable and does not amount to deficient performance); Kitchens v. Johnson,

190 F.3d 698, 701-03 (5th Cir.1999) (holding “objectively reasonable” trial
counsel’s decisions not to pursue or present double-edged evidence showing
petitioner: (1) was physically abused by his father, (2) had abused alcohol from
an early age, and (3) had been hospitalized several times for attempted suicide,
depression, blackouts, and hallucinations because such evidence would also have
revealed instances of extreme violence during petitioner’s childhood, petitioner’s
history of violence even when sober, petitioner’s extensive history of drug abuse,
and voluntary termination of needed treatment); Lamb v. Johnson, 179 F.3d 352,
357-59 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding “objectively reasonable” a trial counsel’s decision
not to present mitigating evidence in the form of testimony regarding the
petitioner’s non-violent character in the past because such testimony would have
come from persons who had little contact with the petitioner for many years and
who could have been asked about their personal knowledge of the petitioner’s
extensive juvenile criminal record); Rector v. Johnson, 120 F.3d 551, 564 (5th
Cir.1997) (holding “objectively reasonable” a trial counsel’s decision not to
present potentially mitigating evidence showing the petitioner suffered from
child abuse, family instability, a poor educational background, low IQ, gunshot

rather than mitigating).

Fifth, when a federal court reviews a state prisoner’s habeas petition, a
“determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be
correct,” and the petitioner “shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption
by clear and convincing evidence.” § 2254(e)(1); Jackson v. Johnson, 150 F.3d
520, 524 (5th Cir. 1998). This presumption of correctness is especially strong
where, as here, the state habeas court and the trial court are one and the same.
See Schriro, 550 U.S. at 476-477; Clark v. Johnson, 202 F.3d 760, 764 (5th Cir.
2000). Supreme Court interpretations of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) teach that the
factual determinations made by state trial and appellate courts after a hearing
are to be accorded a presumption of correctness and are entitled to a high
measure of deference by reviewing federal courts.

Credibility choices, like

express findings of historical fact, are entitled to a presumption of correctness
on federal habeas corpus review. In Self v. Collins, the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals accorded credibility choices made by a state court a presumption of
correctness under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), and came to the same conclusion with
regard to implicit credibility choices:
Implicit in the state’s findings (as well as the jury’s verdict) is a
determination that Self was not credible. “When . . . a trial court
fails to render express findings on credibility but makes a ruling
that depends upon an implicit determination that credits one
witness’s testimony as being truthful, or implicitly discredits
another’s, such determinations are entitled to the same presumption
of correctness that they would have been accorded had they been
made explicitly.” Lavernia v. Lynaugh, 845 F.2d at 500.
38

Filed 03/15/11 Page 40 of 52 PageID #: 210

973 F.2d 1198, 1214 (5th Cir. 1992).
In sum, there were valid, strategic reasons for the decision by Beatty’s
trial counsel not to present, or continue pursuing, potentially mitigating
evidence of the type Beatty now complains his trial counsel should have
investigated and presented at the punishment phase of trial. The state court
made implicit and explicit credibility rulings and its fact findings are entitled to
a presumption of correctness.
C.

Beatty fails to show prejudice.

Beatty presented no evidence before the state court below, nor in his
federal petition, which would establish that not hearing from his former
stepfamily or acquaintances, Twyla Johnson and Leanna Wilkerson, affected the
outcome of his penalty phase. Supp. CR at 82. His only argument seems to
contend that there was a breakdown on the adversarial process:
Prejudice; [sic] the totality of the mitigating evidence might have a
[sic] influenced the juries [sic] appraisal of the defendant moral
culpable [sic] for successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
[sic], a reasonable probability must exists [sic] that the result of the
proceeding would have been different but for trial counsels [sic]
error. Strickland v. Washington 466 U.S. 687 [sic] a reasonable
probability is a probability sufficient to undermine this courts [sic]
confidence in the outcome of the proceeding. . . In this Writ of
Habeas Corpus Mr. Beatty presents evidence that had not ever was
[sic] presented to the trial jury. . . Petitioner contends that there is
a reasonable probability that the available mitigating evidence
would have forced at least one juror to have struck a different cord.
[sic] . . . The fact that there was no evidence presented. . . when. . .
evidence could have been presented and should have been
presented. . . By failing to present this evidence calls [sic] into
question the reliability and fundamental fairness of this proceeding.

Pet., ECF No. 13, at 39. To the contrary, his attorneys challenged the State’s
punishment case with cross examination and argument, and argued that Beatty
was a “child of God” deserving of a life sentence.

That they presented no

witnesses is truly Beatty’s fault, both for making certain choices throughout his
own life and for indicating he did not wish them to call witnesses in his defense.
48 RR at 17-21.
Beatty was “not very helpful” and “was very hard to communicate with”
about potential witnesses. Supp. CR at 78. His attorneys understood that there
was possibly evidence that Ms. Click was abusive to the stepsiblings, but they
could not find witnesses who would testify that she abused Beatty. Further, the
defense team would not have presented the witnesses that Beatty now urges
because they would have been on balance more aggravating than mitigating. Id.
at 76. Counsel Hawk indicated reasonably that “if the bad outweighs the good
he will not risk opening the door to overwhelming aggravating evidence in order
to establish a single mitigating factor.” Id. Beatty presented nothing new and
mitigating in state court, and what there was could not have overcome the
State’s punishment case. Id. at 84. The Supreme Court dismissed a stronger
claim of prejudice in Banks v. Dretke, where

Justices Thomas and Scalia

concurred,
The conclusory and uncorroborated claims of some level of physical
abuse, the allegations that a bad skin condition negatively affected
his childhood development, the evidence that he was a slow learner
and possessed a willingness to please others, and the claim that
Banks’ brother-in-law was responsible for his own pistol-whipping
and receipt of a death threat are so unpersuasive that there is no
reasonable probability that the jury would have come to the opposite
40

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 42 of 52 PageID #: 212

conclusion with respect to the future dangerousness special issue,
even if presented with this evidence.
540 U.S. 668, 710 (2004)(Thomas, J. and Scalia, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part).
Likewise,

given

the

overwhelming

evidence

of

guilt

and

blameworthiness—including the sympathetic qualities of the victim, the
circumstances of the offense itself, Beatty’s numerous and contradictory
accounts of his mother’s demise, his lack of remorse, and, at punishment, his
lengthy criminal history and violent behavior while incarcerated—there is no
reasonable probability that the jury would answer future dangerousness with a
“no” or mitigation with a “yes,” even if counsel had presented the double-edged
punishment case as Beatty vaguely suggests. If these witnesses had been called,
the jury would have additionally learned that his own stepfather could not think
of anything good to say about him; that Beatty had thrown his mother into a
refrigerator and knocked her unconscious, and numerous other aggravating facts
discussed previously.
Significantly, the evidence of Beatty’s future dangerousness was
overwhelming. When that is the case, it is virtually impossible to establish
prejudice.

E.g., Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698 (no prejudice due to State’s

overwhelming evidence on aggravating factors supporting death penalty); Ladd
v. Cockrell, 311 F.3d 349, 360 (5th Cir. 2002); Santellan v. Cockrell, 271 F.3d
190, 198 (5th Cir. 2001); Jones v. Johnson, 171 F.3d 270, 277 (5th Cir. 1999)(no
prejudice due to brutal facts of murder); Russell v. Lynaugh, 892 F.2d 1205, 1213

41

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 43 of 52 PageID #: 213

(5th Cir.1989) (no ineffective assistance “[g]iven the weakness of such testimony
when juxtaposed with the overwhelming evidence of guilt, the horrifying nature
of the crime, and the abundant impeachment material available to the state”).
Counsel did not give up the only defense available. Counsel put on a strategic
defense during the guilt and sentencing phases. Counsel also defended his client
at the sentencing phase.

The law does not require counsel to raise every

available nonfrivolous defense. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983);
cf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 533 (2003) (explaining, in case involving
similar issue of counsel’s responsibility to present mitigating evidence at
sentencing, that “Strickland does not require counsel to investigate every
conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would
be to assist the defendant ... [or even to] present mitigating evidence at
sentencing in every case”).
Finally, Beatty appears to contend that the state court did not adjudicate
the issue of prejudice, saying “The state courts made the determination only on
whether or not [Beatty] received effective representation. If this Honorable
Court determines that the state court adjudication of the determination of the
deficient performance [sic] was adjudicated [sic] and unreasonably [sic] then it
knows [sic] no deference to a hypothetical state “finding [sic] on the prejudice
prong of Strickland. . .” Pet., ECF No. 13, at 41-42. While the state court’s
findings of fact and conclusions of law do not categorize findings under headings
of deficiency and prejudice, it is apparent that the analysis conducted was
focused on both prongs. Many of the factual findings address the potential
prejudicial effect this testimony would have had on a jury. The court repeatedly
42

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 44 of 52 PageID #: 214

characterized the testimony as “significantly more aggravating than potentially
mitigating” or “more beneficial than offensive” and detailed concerns by the
defense team that they might “prejudice [Beatty’s chances] . . . for a life
sentence” or whether evidence would have “changed the outcome had it been
presented.” Supp. CR at 72-84. The labels given the findings are irrelevant.
The findings are presumed to be correct whatever verbage is used to describe
them, and the focus of the state court was properly on whether counsel had
strategic reasons to make their choices; whether those reasons were sound; and
whether it would have made any difference to the outcome had they done
otherwise.
Thus, the state court properly found that Beatty showed neither deficiency
or prejudice, and this Court should decline to grant relief, and instead grant the
Director’s motion for summary judgment.
II.

Beatty’s Claim of Ineffective Assistance at Guilt-Innocence is
Unexhausted and Procedurally Barred. Trial Counsel Effectively
Represented Beatty During Guilt-Innocence.
Beatty argues his attorneys were also ineffective during the guilt-

innocence stage because they did not investigate and present facts which would
show Beatty was merely guilty of murdering his mother because he did it in a
fit of rage and had only formed the intent to steal from her after her death. Pet.,
ECF No. 13, at 20, 42-45.

These undiscovered, unpresented “facts” are as

follows:
Although, [sic] there was some evidence admitted at the trial of this
case that showed the relationship between the parties; [sic] it was
43

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 45 of 52 PageID #: 215

the unrequited [sic] contention of the State of Texas that the
decedent was a kind, weak, disabled, loving woman and
consequently, [Beatty] must have killed her for the purpose of
obtaining property or burglarizing her home. . . [Ms. Click] had
another side. The other side as described by Ms. Wilkerson was
“mean cold hearted bitch,” who aggravated fights with her son. . .
and knew how to push buttons.
Id. at 44. In short, he recycles his ineffective-assistance-at-punishment claim,
again illogically contending that with more evidence of Beatty’s “tumultuous
relationship” with his mother, the jury could have concluded he was only guilty
of murder. Id. at 44.
A.

Beatty’s ineffective-assistance-at-guilt-innocence claim is
unexhausted and procedurally barred.

This claim is unexhausted and distinct from that which Beatty presented
in state court, to wit: that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate facts
indicating the killing was done in self-defense, and for conceding that the killing
was a murder in the opening statement. Petition, Ex parte Beatty at 14, 26, 29.
Beatty did not claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate
facts showing he formed the intent to steal only after his mother’s death either
on direct appeal or in state collateral review. It is clear then that Beatty has
failed to exhaust state court remedies with regard to this claim. It is equally
clear, however, that Beatty would be barred from raising the claim in a
successive state habeas application under Article 11.071 § 5(a) of the Texas Code
44

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 46 of 52 PageID #: 216

of Criminal Procedure.6 Balentine v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 842, 857 (5th Cir. 2010).
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A), habeas corpus relief may not be
granted “unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies
available in the courts of the State.”

However, “[b]ecause [the exhaustion]

requirement refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal
petition, it is satisfied if it is clear that the habeas petitioner’s claims are now
procedurally barred under state law.” Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 161
(1996) (internal citations omitted); see also Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 125 n.28
(1982); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351(1989); Graham v. Johnson, 94 F.3d
958, 969 (5 th Cir. 1996) (“exhaustion is not required if it would plainly be futile”).
Nonetheless, such an unexhausted claim is subject to denial in federal court as
procedurally defaulted. Although under Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 265
(1989), federal review of a habeas claim is procedurally barred only if the last
state court to consider the claim expressly and unambiguously based its denial
of relief on a state procedural default,
[t]his rule does not apply if the petitioner failed to exhaust state
remedies and the court to which petitioner would be required to

6

Article 11.071 §5(a), which became effective September 1, 1995, provides that
a state court may not consider the merits of or grant relief on claims presented in a
successive state habeas application absent facts giving rise to a statutory exception.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, § 5(a). Beatty has made no showing that one
of the article 11.071 exceptions would apply to allow review of this claim in state court.
45

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 47 of 52 PageID #: 217

present his claims in order to meet the exhaustion requirement
would now find the claims procedurally barred. In such a case there
is a procedural default for purposes of federal habeas regardless of
the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner actually
presented his claims.
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 735 n.1 (1991). In the instant case, just as
in Gray v. Netherland, “the procedural bar which gives rise to exhaustion
provides an independent and adequate state-law ground for the conviction and
sentence, and thus prevents federal habeas corpus review of the defaulted claim,
unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the default.” 518
U.S. at 162 (barring claim on basis that claim would be barred in state court if
it were presented there); Nichols v. Scott, 69 F.3d 1255, 1280 (5th Cir. 1995).
The Fifth Circuit has held that where a petitioner raises claims in federal
court that have not previously been presented to the state courts, and Article
11.071 § 5(a) would apply to foreclose review of the claims if presented in a
successive state habeas application, such is an adequate state procedural bar
foreclosing federal habeas review of the claims. Balentine v. Thaler, 626 F.3d at
857; Nobles v. Johnson, 127 F.3d 409, 422 (5 th Cir. 1997); Muniz v. Johnson, 132
F.3d 214, 221 (5 th Cir. 1998). Beatty does not attempt to distinguish his case
from Nobles and Muniz; nor does he attempt to demonstrate cause and prejudice
for his failure to raise the claims in his initial state habeas application. Thus,
circuit precedent compels the denial of this claim as procedurally defaulted.

represented

Beatty

during

guilt-

Beatty fails to proffer much additional evidence that counsel could have
introduced at trial which would explain Beatty’s motive for murdering his
mother, beyond the testimony the jury already heard. Neither his step-family,
nor Ms. Johnson, nor Ms. Wilkerson, nor anyone else was present during Ms.
Click’s last horrific hours and minutes.

The only person who could have

explained to a jury that Beatty killed her in a fit of rage independent of his drugaddicted desire for methamphetamines (and the money to purchase more) was
Beatty. However, the jury was able to hear Beatty’s self-serving accounts from
several sources who did testify at trial.
The state court found that Beatty’s many versions of the night’s events
were presented to the jury.

Following his arrest Beatty confessed that he

snapped during an argument with his mother and “killed the bitch.” Supp. CR
at 67. In another version, he told trial witness Mr. Clary that he choked his
mother in self-defense. Id. Ms. Wilkerson testified that Beatty said he killed his
mother during an argument. Id. at 66. Beatty told a police investigator that his
mother started the altercation by slapping him for coming home drunk. Id. at
68. Therefore, counsel cannot be said to be deficient for failing to present to the
jury the minimal additional statements that his mother was a mean cold-hearted
bitch and could “push your buttons.”
47

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 49 of 52 PageID #: 219

Nor does Beatty prove prejudice. The state court found that the defense
team considered the possibility of a self-defense or sudden passion defense “more
times than I can count” but made the strategic decision not to do so because “it
would not only harm their ability to help [Beatty] in guilt-innocence, it would
destroy their ability to provide effective assistance at the punishment phase
where they would be asking for a life sentence.” Id. at 69. Beatty and the
defense team agreed to try to get him convicted of the lesser-included offense of
murder. Id. at 70. The state court found this to be a well-considered strategy
based on the evidence, the law, and the specifics of Smith County juries. Id.
Beatty fails to overcome the deference owed the state court’s decision. The
Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this deferential standard, holding that in
order to determine if the state court made an unreasonable application, a federal
court “must determine what arguments or theories supported or . . . could have
supported, the state court’s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible
fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are
inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.” Richter, 131 S.
Ct. at 786 (emphasis added); see also Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 27 (federal habeas
relief is only merited where the state-court decision is both incorrect and
objectively unreasonable, “whether or not [this Court] would reach the same
conclusion”). This is particularly true when reviewing a state court’s application

48

Case 4:09-cv-00225-RAS Document 19

Filed 03/15/11 Page 50 of 52 PageID #: 220

of Strickland, which when analyzed in conjunction with § 2254(d), creates a
difficult to surmount, “doubly” deferential assumption in favor of the state court
denial. Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 786.
Additional evidence that Beatty had a contentious relationship with his
mother would not disprove the State’s circumstantial evidence case indicating
that Ms. Click kicked Beatty out of the house earlier that day, and that shortly
after the murder, Beatty was spending his mother’s money, attempting to sell
her car, and doing drugs with the proceeds of his crime. Beatty v. State, 2009
WL 619191 at * 2-4. Therefore, Beatty shows neither deficiency nor prejudice
during guilt-innocence, and his unexhausted, procedurally barred claim should
be dismissed.
CONCLUSION
Given the deference due the state court’s factual findings and Beatty’s
failure to show that the state court misapplied clearly established federal law or
wrongly determined the facts, his claims for relief must fail. For the foregoing
reasons, Beatty’s petition for writ of habeas corpus should be denied.
