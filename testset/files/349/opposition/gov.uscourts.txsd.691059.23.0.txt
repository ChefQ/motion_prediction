JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR A
STAY OF ALL PROCEEDINGS AND MOTION FOR AN EQUITABLE TOLL OF THE
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
COME NOW Plaintiffs SONIA FORTNER, CATHY GARCIA, GRACIELA GRANDA,
SANDRA MARESCA, MARIA PUERTO, and JOHANA QUIJANO, individually and on behalf
of all others similarly situated (“Plaintiffs”), and file this Response In Opposition To Defendant’s
Motion For a Stay of All Proceedings and Motion For an Equitable Toll of the Statute of
Limitations. In support thereof, they would respectfully show the Court as follows:
I. INTRODUCTION
On August 18, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a putative collective action lawsuit on behalf of
themselves and all others similarly situated against Defendants pursuant to the provisions of the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201, et seq. The complaint seeks to
recover on behalf of those hourly employees denied overtime and other wages by Defendant
BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. On December 10, 2009, Defendant filed a motion to stay the

Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 23

proceedings. Defendant argues that, in the interest judicial economy, the Court should stay this
case while the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation considers Defendant’s application to
transfer this and related cases to a single judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407. For the
reasons below, Plaintiff opposes Defendant’s motion to stay the proceedings. However, should
the Court, in its discretion, grant Defendant’s motion to stay, Plaintiffs request that the statute of
limitations for the putative class be tolled from the date that Defendant filed its Original Answer.
II. ARGUMENT
a.

Staying This Case Will Diminish Claims of the Putative Class
As Defendant BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. correctly notes in its motion, “[u]nder Rule

1.5 of the Rules of Procedure for the MDL Panel, this Court retains jurisdiction over all pre-trial
proceedings notwithstanding the pending MDL transfer requests.” See, Defendant’s Motion For
a Stay of All Proceedings, ¶ 7. “[T]he determination to stay or proceed with this case rests with
the sound discretion of this Court.” Id. (citation omitted). Ultimately, though, “[e]ach action
[transferred by order of the MDL Panel] shall be remanded … at or before the conclusion of such
pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred[.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1407(a). In
other words, even if this case is consolidated for pre-trial proceedings pursuant to an order of the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, this Court retains jurisdiction over the ultimate
disposition of this case, including trial. 28 U.S.C. § 1407.
If this Court grants Defendant’s motion to stay, the likelihood that members of the
putative class will receive enough notice to participate in this case and any recovery before they
are barred by the statute of limitations diminishes every day. As then-District Judge, now Justice
Sotomayer explained, in FLSA cases employees’ claims continue to “die daily” until the plaintiff
opts into the action. Hoffman v. Sbarro, Inc. 982 F. Supp. 249, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). Courts
rightfully treat this problem with the utmost seriousness.
2

As the Supreme Court held in

Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 23

Filed in TXSD on 12/30/09 Page 3 of 8

Hoffman-LaRoche v. Sperling, the benefits of the collective action “depend on employees
receiving accurate and timely notice concerning the pendency of the collective action, so that
they can make informed decisions about whether to participate.” 493 U.S. at 170. If plaintiffs
are not informed of their rights in this lawsuit before their statute of limitations run, the benefits
inherent in an FLSA collective action and outlined by the Supreme Court in Hoffman-La Roche,
will disappear. 493 U.S. at 170.
Plaintiffs should be afforded with the opportunity to conduct discovery relating to class
certification, notwithstanding Defendant’s request to transfer that is currently pending with the
MDL Panel. With each day that passes, the claims of the members of the putative class decrease,
and staying this case will prejudice them even more.
b.

This Court Should Equitably Toll the Statute of Limitations
In order to prevent prejudice to Plaintiffs and members of the putative class and in light

of the fact that Defendant has (1) filed an application for transfer with the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation (2) asked the Court to stay this case, this Court is empowered to and
should equitably toll the statute of limitations as of the date Defendants filed their original
answer on October 19, 2009. “The doctrine of equitable tolling permits a court to exercise its
discretion to extend a plaintiff’s statute of limitations. The doctrine applies to cases brought
under the FLSA because the doctrine of equitable tolling is ‘read into every federal statute of
limitations.’” Antonio-Morales v. Bimbo’s Best Produce, Inc., No. 8:5105, 2009 U.S. Dist
LEXIS 51833 at *4 (E.D. La. April 20, 2009) (citing Holmberg v. Ambrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 397
(1946)). “Courts routinely grant equitable tolling in the FLSA collective action context to avoid
prejudice to actual or potential opt-in plaintiffs that can arise from the unique procedural posture
of collective actions under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).” Id. (citing with approval, Partlow v. Jewish

Orphans Home of S. Cal., Inc., 645 F.2d 757, 760-61 (9th Cir. 1981); Roussell v. Brinker Int’l,
No. H-05-3733, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109663 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2008); Johnson v. Big Lots
Stores, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 2d 903 (E.D. La. 2008); Faison v. Texas EZPawn, L.P., 2007 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 36864 (S.D. Tex. May 21, 2007); Smith v. Heartland Automotive Servs., Inc., 404 F.
Supp. 2d 1144, 1155 n.9 (D. Minn. 2005); Owens v. Bethlehem Mines Corp., 630 F. Supp. 309,
312-13 (S.D. W.Va. 1986)).
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that the invocation of equitable
powers to suspend the running of the applicable statute of limitations is proper in circumstances
where aggrieved persons are unable to assert their rights. See, Felder v. Johnson, 204 F.3d 168,
174 (5th Cir. 2000) (“Equitable tolling is appropriate when an extraordinary factor beyond the
plaintiff’s control prevents his filing on time.”); Coleman v. Johnson, 184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.
1999) (“Equitable tolling applies principally where the plaintiff … is prevented in some
extraordinary way from asserting his rights.” (quoting Rashidi v. Am. President Lines, 96 F.3d
124, 128 (5th Cir. 1996)). Similarly, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that
equitable tolling in an FLSA action is proper to prevent the expiration of plaintiffs’ claims
because of delays in the case not due to the fault of the plaintiffs. Partlow v. Jewish Orphans’
Home of Southern Cal., Inc., 645 F.2d 757 (9th Cir. 1981) (abrogated on other grounds by
Hoffman-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U.S. 165 (1989)).
In Partlow, the Ninth Circuit set forth two factors that warrant a toll in FLSA actions: 1)
plaintiffs themselves have done nothing wrong and 2) “the practical effect of not tolling the
statute would be to bar forever any claim” the employees had against the defendant. Partlow,
645 F.2d at 760. As a policy matter, the Ninth Circuit reasoned a toll is particularly necessary
when the delay will prevent the employees’ claims from even being heard. Partlow, 645 F.2d at

4

760. As then-District Judge, now Justice Sotomayer explained, in FLSA cases employees’
claims continue to “die daily” until the plaintiff opts into the action. Hoffman v. Sbarro, Inc. 982
F. Supp. 249, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). Courts rightfully treat this problem with the utmost
seriousness. As the Supreme Court held in Hoffman-LaRoche v. Sperling, the benefits of the
collective action “depend on employees receiving accurate and timely notice concerning the
pendency of the collective action, so that they can make informed decisions about whether to
participate.” 493 U.S. at 170. If plaintiffs are not informed of their rights in this lawsuit before
their statute of limitations run, the benefits inherent in an FLSA collective action and outlined by
the Supreme Court in Hoffman-La Roche, will disappear. 493 U.S. at 170.
The Ninth Circuit also reasoned that a toll is proper when defendants will not face
substantial hardship in defending the claims. Partlow, 645 F.2d at 761. That is because a statute
of limitations is designed to ensure fairness to defendants and to “notify them of claims that they
must defend before the claims grow stale.” Partlow, 645 F.2d at 761 (citing Burnett v. New York
Central Railroad, 380 U.S. 424, 428 (1965)). The Defendants are not prejudiced once they are
aware of the claims and commence their investigation. Courts in this and other circuits have
consistently ordered equitable tolls in FLSA cases. See, e.g., Antonio-Morales v. Bimbo’s Best
Produce, Inc., No. 8:5105, 2009 U.S. Dist LEXIS 51833 at *6 (E.D. La. April 20, 2009);
Beauperthuy v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc., Civ. No. 06-0715, 2007 WL 707475 at *8 (N.D. Cal.
Mar. 6, 2007); Adams v. Inter-Con Security Systems, 242 F.R.D. 530, 542-543 (N.D. Cal. April
11, 2007); Castle v. Wells Fargo Financial, Inc., Civ. No. C 06-4347 SI, 2007 WL 1105118 at
*1 (N.D.Cal. Apr. 10, 2007).
If this case is stayed and/or transferred by the MDL Panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407,
members of the putative class will suffer irreparable harm through no fault of their own, and the

likelihood that employees will receive accurate and timely notice concerning the pendency of
this collective action so that they can make informed decisions about whether to participate will
significantly decrease.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Defendant’s motion to stay.
Additionally, in this case, as in the cases cited above, Plaintiffs easily meet the factors that
warrant a toll. First, Plaintiffs have clearly done nothing wrong while pursuing their claims
under the FLSA. Second, in the absence of a toll, each day that passes will forever extinguish a
portion of the putative class members’ claims. By ordering a toll, this Court will prevent
prejudice to Plaintiffs and allow all of their claims to be heard. In Partlow, the Court ordered a
toll, noting it “would simply be improper to deprive the consenting employees of their right of
action.” Partlow, 645 F.2d at 761. As the Supreme Court noted in Hoffman-La Roche, the
inherent benefits of the collective action “will disappear” if the putative class members are not
notified of the suit before their statute of limitations expires. 493 U.S. at 170. A toll will not
create any hardship here because Defendants have been on notice of Plaintiffs’ claims for several
months, and the Plaintiffs’ claims have not grown “stale.” Partlow, 645 F.2d at 761. Since
Defendants have been on notice of and investigating Plaintiffs’ claims in this and related
litigation, this Court’s order of a toll will not result in “substantial hardship” to their defense of
these claims. See, e.g., Partlow, 645 F.2d at 761.
This Court is vested with the power and discretion to deny Defendant’s motion for stay
and to order a toll and avoid undue prejudice to the Plaintiffs and the putative class members.
Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, respectfully request that this
Court (1) deny Defendant’s motion for a stay of all proceedings and (2) equitably toll Plaintiffs’

and the putative class members respective statutes of limitations from the date Defendants filed
their original answer on October 19, 2009.
IV. PRAYER
WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court
deny Defendant’s Motion For a Stay of All Proceedings and (2) grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for an
Equitable Toll of the Statute of Limitations.
