DEFENDANT BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.'S MOTION FOR A STAY OF ALL
PROCEEDINGS AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT THEREOF

Defendant Bank of America, N.A. "Defendant" or "Bank of America") respectfully
moves this Court for a stay of all proceedings in this matter until such time as Defendant's
Application to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "Panel") is decided. On
December 10, 2009, Defendant filed an application and motion to transfer all pending federal
cases, alleging claims similar to those asserted in this action, to a single judicial officer venued in
the Central District of California pursuant to multi-district litigation procedures ("the MDL").

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
On August 24, 2009, a collective action Complaint was filed by Plaintiffs Sonia Fortner,
Cathy Garcia, Graciela Granda, Sandra Maresca, Maria Puerto and Johana Quijane (collectively,
the "Plaintiffs"), individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, alleging that they
were required to perform work off-the-clock and were not paid for those hours. Plaintiffs later

amended their allegations by filing their Firs: Amended Complaint, in which Plaintiffs claim that
Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 19 Filed in TXSD on 12/10/09 Page 2 of 9

Bank of America required them to work off-the-clock and/or misclassified employees as exempt
in order to avoid paying overtime. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Bank of America "required
Plaintiffs to perform work for its benefit without compensating Plaintiffs" and that Bank of
America "failed to pay Plaintiffs for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) at one and one half
times their regular rate." See First Amended Complaint, ff] 27 & 28. Plaintiffs also allege that
"fijn the event that Defendant classified Plaintiffs as exempt from overtime, Plaintiffs were
misclassified." See First Amended Complaint, { 31.

Plaintiffs Complaint pleads a single count of overtime violations and related penalties
under the FLSA on behalf of "[a]ll current and former small business specialists, personal
bankers, tellers, teller operations specialists or any other employees who was not compensated
for overtime. See First Amended Complaint, { 44. Plaintiff also seeks overtime compensation in
accordance with the Texas Labor Code. See First Amended Complaint, 4 4g.

There are now 12 federal cases pending in eight federal district courts across the country
making the same claims and factual allegations as Plaintiffs. Each of the 12 pending cases is
asserted as a class or collective action, or both. Each of the Complaints shares certain factual
allegations and legal theories, Plaintiffs in several of the related cases are employed as tellers,
personal bankers and/or teller operations specialists, much like Plaintiffs here. They all assert
that the alleged violations resulted from common policies and practices used by Defendant
throughout the nation. In fact, all of the plaintiffs in the 12 actions assert off-the-clock claims
and allege that Defendant is liable for overtime wages and related penalties resulting from its
alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 0x00A7 201 et seq,, and/or its related
state-law counterparts. Like Plaintiffs here, the plaintiffs in at least eight of the related cases

seek such wages and penalties pursuant to the FLSA, while at least eight involve state law
Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 19 Filed in TXSD on 12/10/09 Page 3 of 9

claims. Four of the related actions involve both federal and state law claims. Pretrial
proceedings, including class certification proceedings, will focus on these common factual and
legal allegations pled in each of the 12 actions. Consolidated proceedings will consequently
avoid duplicative and overlapping discovery requests and disputes, as well as eliminate the risk
of inconsistent rulings.

Bank of America's counsel has filed a Motion to Transfer all of the actions pursuant to 28
U.S.C. 0x00A7 1407, requesting that the pending federal cases be consolidated in and transferred to a
single judicial district. The Motion incorporates ail 12 of the current federal lawsuits. The
Motion is now under the Panel's consideration.

For reasons of comity and judicial economy, as discussed more fully below, Defendant
respectfully requests that this Court stay discovery and all other proceedings in this matter until
the MDL Panel evaluates and rules on the pending MDL Application and Motion to Transfer.

ARGUMENT

Under Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Procedure for the MDL Panel, this Court retains
jurisdiction over all pre-trial proceedings notwithstanding the pending MDL transfer requests.
Accordingly, until the Panel consolidates and transfers these cases into an MDL, the
determination to stay or proceed with this case rests within the sound discretion of this Court.
See, cent.g., Falgoust v. Microsoft Corp., No. CIV.A.00-00779, 2000 WL 462919, at *1 CE.D. La.
Apr. 19, 2000) ("[C]ourts have inherent power to `control the disposition of the causes on its
docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.'") (citation
omitted).

In the interests of judicial economy, Defendant respectfully submits that this Court
should stay these proceedings until such time as the MDL Panel has ruled on the transfer

requests. See Namovicz v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 225 F. Supp.2d 582, 585 (D. Md. 2001)
Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 19 Filed in TXSD on 12/10/09 Page 4o0f9

("[T]he Court also determines that a stay in proceedings pending the determination of the MDL
Panel is appropriate. A stay is necessary to ensure that, in the event consolidation of all cases for
pre-trial litigation is ordered, there is consistent treatment of the numerous lawsuits and that
judicial resources are not wasted.") (citing 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1407(a)); see also McCrary v. Bayer
Corp., No. CIV.A. 02-642, 2002 WL 1467691, at *1 (E.D. La. July 3, 2002) ("[T]he decision
whether to grant or deny a stay is completely within the discretion of the Court.... It continues
to remain the opinion of this Court that the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by this temporary stay
as any prejudice resulting from this short delay is clearly outweighed by the benefit of judicial
efficiency and avoidance of inconsistent rulings."),; Tench v. Jackson Nat'l Life Ins. Co., No. 99
C 5182, 1999 WL 1044923, at *] (N.D. Ill. Nov. 12, 1999) ("Under these circumstances, Le.,
pending a decision by the MDL Panel whether to add a case, stays are frequently granted to
avoid duplicative efforts and preserve valuable judicial resources.")

I. A STAY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS WOULD PROMOTE COMITY AND
JUDICIAL ECONOMY.

When an action such as this one "may be transferred by the ... Panel to a consolidated
MDL proceeding, ... courts have determined that a stay of the action is appropriate if it serves
the interests of judicial economy and efficiency." Smith v. Mail Boxes, Etc. USA, Inc., 191 F.
Supp. 2d 1155, 1157 (E.D. Cal. 2002) (citing cases). The overlap of certain factual and legal
issues with the other cases pending transfer into an MDL makes this case ripe for consolidation
and transfer by the Panel. See 28 U.S. C. 0x00A7 1407 ("When civil actions involving one or more
common questions of fact are pending in different districts, such actions may be transferred to
any district for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings."). Accordingly, a stay of this
matter until the likely issuance of the transfer order by the MDL Panel will eliminate

unnecessary duplication of litigation, serving the interests of judicial economy.
Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 19 Filed in TXSD on 12/10/09 Page 5 of 9

Proceeding with this case, notwithstanding the pending transfer requests, will result in the
unnecessary consumption of judicial time and energy in, inter alia, digesting the allegations and
implications of Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint, monitoring discovery, and ruling on
Plaintiffs' anticipated demand for conditional certification and nationwide notice to all overtime
eligible employees working in each of Bank of America's thousands of banking centers. See,
e.g., Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 F. Supp. 1358, 1361 (N.D. Cal. 1997) ("If this case is not
stayed, preliminary proceedings would continue as required . . . and this Court would need to
monitor discovery and approve a case management plan in a potentially massive . . . action.
Taking on such a task at this time would seem to unnecessarily consume judicial time and
energy.") This Court should in its discretion defer this matter briefly until the MDL Panel rules
on the transfer request. See, e.g., Jn re Amstead Indus. Inc. "ERISA" Litig., 162 F. Supp. 2d 697,
698 (J.P.M.L. 2001) (noting that "Section 1407 has the salutary effect of placing all the related
actions before a single judge who can formulate a pretrial program that: i) allows pretrial
proceedings with respect to any non-common issues to proceed concurrently with pretrial
proceedings on common issues . . ., and ii) ensures that pretrial proceedings will be conduced in
a manner leading to the just and expeditious resolution of all actions to the overall benefit of the
parties.") (internal citation omitted).

il. A STAY WOULD BENEFIT THE PARTIES.

In deciding to grant `a stay, this Court properly may consider the interests of the parties in
addition to the Court's own interest in conserving judicial resources, See, e.g., Falgoust, 2000
WL 462919, at *2. The parties will benefit from a stay of this matter until such time as the MDL
Panel can resolve the pending transfer requests.

For example, absent a stay, Defendant would be forced into the patently disadvantageous

position of developing and presenting similar defenses in eight separate district courts. See
Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 19 Filed in TXSD on 12/10/09 Page 6 of 9

Weinke v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 989, 990 (E.D. Wis, 2000) (holding that ipse dixit
assertions of prejudice will not be determined to "outweigh the disadvantages of litigating
identical claims in a multitude of venues"). Without a stay, both this case and the other cases
pending transfer will proceed in parallel, forcing, infer alia, duplicative discovery on clearly
overlapping issues. See, e.g., Sevel v. AOL Time Warner, 232 F. Supp. 2d 615, 616 (E.D. Va.
2002) (granting a stay of the proceedings pending decision regarding transfer by the Panel,
noting that a stay had the salutary purpose of "avoid[ing] undue confusion and duplication of
effort" in complex securities fraud actions); Am. Seafood, Inc. v. Magnolia Processing, Inc.,
Case Nos. 92-1030, 92-1086, 1992 WL 102762, *2 (E.D. Pa. May 7, 1992) ("The duplicative
motion practice and discovery proceedings demonstrate that judicial economy and prejudice to
the defendants weigh heavily in favor of the stay."), Such duplication of effort is essentially
punitive to both this Court and the parties before it.

In contrast, Plaintiffs here will suffer no discernible prejudice by having this matter
stayed until such time as the Panel has decided whether to transfer this case into the MDL.
Furthermore, this matter has only recently been filed by Plaintiffs. Staying this case now will not
prejudice Plaintiffs because this case is in a nascent stage wherein a stay will have virtually no
practical effect. See, e.g, Mathis v. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co., No. Civ.A. 03-0308, 2003 WL
1193668, at * 1 (E.D. La. Mar. 12, 2003) (granting stay until the Panel decided a pending motion
for consolidation and transfer, noting that the case at issue was "newly filed" with no discovery
having taken place).

In addition, a stay will preclude the possibility of conflicting and perhaps contradictory

rulings on matters such as the scope and propriety of discovery, class certification and notice
Case 4:09-cv-02651 Document 19 Filed in TXSD on 12/10/09 Page 7 of 9

issues, Accordingly, Defendant respectfully submits that the Court should stay these
proceedings until the Panel rules on the pending MDL Application.
CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Defendant respectfully requests a stay of these proceedings,
until such time as the MDL Panel has ruled upon the pending MDL Application and motion to
transfer this matter into the proposed MDL.
This the 10" day of December 2009.
