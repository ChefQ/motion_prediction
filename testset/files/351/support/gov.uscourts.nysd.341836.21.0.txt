Defendants MBIA Inc. ("MBIA Inc."), MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA
Insurance"), and MBIA Insurance Corporation of Illinois, now known as National Public
Finance Guarantee Corporation ("MBIA Illinois") (collectively, "Defendants" or the "MBIA
Group") submit this Memorandum of Law in support of their motion, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1)
and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This lawsuit constitutes an improper attempt by Plaintiffs to bypass the state
channels of review established by the New York State Legislature – and recognized by this Court
and the Second Circuit – for challenging determinations made by the New York State
Superintendent of Insurance (the "Superintendent") pursuant to New York's complex and
comprehensive insurance regulatory scheme. No matter what labels Plaintiffs attach to their
claims, the inescapable fact is that Plaintiffs ask this Court to unwind and set aside a series of
transactions (the "Transactions") which were expressly approved by the Superintendent after
lengthy and thorough review by the New York State Department of Insurance (the
"Department").
The Complaint in this action ignores entirely any mention of the Superintendent's
approval. It fails to attach the Superintendent's letter setting forth his approval (the "Approval
Letter"), or even acknowledge that these Transactions were undertaken by the MBIA Group only
after securing the Superintendent's approval.1 It also does not state what the Approval Letter

1

A copy of the Superintendent's Approval Letter, which is a matter of public record, has been available to
Plaintiffs since it was issued on February 17, 2009 and has been posted on the MBIA Group's website since
March 3, 2009, prior to Plaintiffs bringing this suit. The Approval Letter is annexed as Exhibit A to the
Declaration of Jonathan D. Siegfried dated May 6, 2009 ("Siegfried Decl."). This Court may consider such a
document in connection with Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal

makes clear: that the Superintendent and the Department carefully analyzed each Transaction
now challenged by Plaintiffs under very specific, detailed and interrelated statutory provisions of
New York Insurance Law. After completing that review, the Superintendent determined that the
Transactions complied in all respects with New York law. He specifically found that the
Transactions (1) did not, as Plaintiffs allege, render MBIA Insurance insolvent, (2) were "fair
and equitable" as to their terms, and (3) did not "adversely affect the interests of policyholders."
(See Siegfried Decl., Exh. A p.9). As detailed in the Approval Letter, the Superintendent
reached these determinations based upon the Department's own extensive and independent
investigation and analysis of the Transactions, including an examination of the books and records
of MBIA Insurance, the Department's assessment of the financial condition of MBIA Insurance,
both prior to and after the Transformation, and the Department's "expertise and knowledge about
insurance companies, the business of insurance and reinsurance and the market for reinsurance."
(Id. p.7).
The Transactions approved by the Superintendent allowed the MBIA Group to
implement a transformation of their business (the "Transformation") following which MBIA
Illinois would maintain and write financial guaranty insurance solely for domestic public finance
bonds, and MBIA Insurance would maintain and write financial guaranty insurance for
structured finance and international products, each with adequate capital and surplus to support
the obligations insured. Pursuant to the Transactions, MBIA Illinois assumed and reinsured over

Plaintiffs' failure to attach it to the Complaint. See Filetech S.A. v. Fr. Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 932 (2d Cir.
1998); Brass v. Am. Film Techs., Inc., 987 F.2d 142, 150 (2d Cir. 1993); Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding

$537 billion of bonds previously insured by MBIA Insurance, reducing the exposure of MBIA
Insurance to $241 billion of insurance previously written. (Siegfried Decl., Exh. B).2
Rather than directly challenge these determinations of the Superintendent under
the judicial scheme erected by New York for such purpose – namely, a special proceeding in
New York State Court under Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules
(McKinney 2009) ("CPLR") naming the Superintendent as defendant – Plaintiffs have, instead,
brought suit in this Court against the MBIA Group to unwind and set aside the Transactions.
Notwithstanding this attempted end run, the fact remains that this suit challenges the
Superintendent's approval of Transactions falling directly within his supervisory and regulatory
authority. As such, the Complaint must be dismissed for at least three independent reasons:
First, under New York law, the exclusive means for Plaintiffs to challenge the
Transactions approved by the Superintendent is through an Article 78 proceeding. See N.Y. Ins.
Law (McKinney 2006) ("Insurance Law") § 326. Plaintiffs may not bring a back door collateral
attack on his determination by cloaking their claims as a private right of action against the MBIA
Group and suing in Federal District Court. In asking this Court to declare the Transactions "null
and void" and to "set them aside," Plaintiffs necessarily challenge the very determinations made
by the Superintendent in order to approve the Transactions, namely their effect on the solvency
of MBIA Insurance, the fairness of their terms, and the interests of policyholders. Courts have
not hesitated to dismiss suits, such as this, which seek to "disregard and bypass the
Superintendent's position, and bring an action directly against the insurer on the very issues
necessarily encompassed in that decision." Shah v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., No. 00 Civ. 108887,
2

The Court may take judicial notice of the press release issued by the Department on February 18, 2009, attached
as Exhibit B to the Siegfried Declaration, announcing its approval of the Transactions. See McLoughlin v.
People's United Bank, Inc., 586 F. Supp. 2d 70, 73 (D. Conn. 2008).

2003 WL 728869, at *10-11 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Feb. 21, 2003), rev'd in part on other grounds, Fiala
v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 776 N.Y.S.2d 29 (1st Dept. 2004). To permit such suits would allow
Plaintiffs to violate the statutory language of the Insurance Law and the overall legislative
scheme established by the New York State Legislature. Accordingly, the Complaint should be
dismissed as an improper collateral attack on the decision of the Superintendent acting pursuant
to his regulatory authority.
Second, the Complaint should be dismissed, and the Court should decline
jurisdiction, under the abstention doctrine of Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943). As
the Second Circuit has held in cases similarly challenging determinations made by the
Superintendent, New York State has a "complex administrative and judicial system for
regulating … insurance companies" which was "adopted pursuant to congressional
authorization" and "operates pursuant to an express federal policy of noninterference in
insurance matters." Levy v Lewis, 635 F.2d. 960, 963 (2d Cir. 1980). Accordingly, "federal
courts [should] refrain from interfering in cases presenting state law issues relating to complex
state [insurance] regulations … and for which [New York] state has provided a comprehensive
regulatory system with channels for review by state courts." Stephens v. Cooper, 746 F. Supp.
292, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 1990) (citation omitted). That is clearly the case here. The Transactions
were approved by the Superintendent, under a complex regulatory scheme, and Plaintiffs' state
law claims are, by statute, expressly subject to judicial review by the New York State courts.
Finally, Counts I and II of the Complaint should be dismissed under Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), as well as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), since
those Counts rest on conclusory allegations unsupported by plausible facts. Count III also fails
to state a valid cause of action under New York law.

Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons set forth below, this
action should be dismissed.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

The Parties
The five named Plaintiffs are hedge funds who purport to bring this action on

behalf of all holders of securities and instruments (other than United States municipal and
government bonds) for which Defendant MBIA Insurance issued financial guarantee insurance.
Plaintiffs do not allege that they are policyholders themselves. (Complaint ("Compl.") ¶1).3
The MBIA Group operates insurance businesses through MBIA Insurance and
MBIA Illinois. (Id. ¶¶19, 20). MBIA Insurance is a New York domiciled insurance company
subject to New York insurance law and regulation. (Id. ¶19). MBIA Illinois is an Illinois
domiciled insurance company. (Id. ¶20). MBIA Inc. is a publicly traded company and the
ultimate parent company of MBIA Insurance and MBIA Illinois. (Id. ¶18).
B.

Transformation
MBIA Insurance is a monoline insurer that issues only financial guaranty

insurance, not other types of insurance such as property, casualty, life, health or disability
insurance. Prior to the Transformation of the MBIA Group, MBIA Insurance offered guarantees
of payment for, among other things, both public finance bonds (such as municipal and state
bonds) and structured finance products (such as collateralized debt obligations and mortgage
backed securities). (Id. ¶19).
The crisis in U.S. financial markets that became apparent in the late summer of
2007 adversely affected numerous financial institutions. Most companies in the financial

A copy of the Complaint dated March 11, 2009 is attached as Exhibit C to the Siegfried Declaration.

guarantee industry – including MBIA Insurance – were downgraded by both Standard & Poor's
and Moody's and suspended writing new structured finance business by mid-2008. (See, e.g., id.
¶34). The ratings downgrades also made it impossible for MBIA Insurance to write new
business in the municipal and other U.S. public finance markets, and MBIA Insurance had
minimal prospect of re-entering that market in the future. (See id. ¶35). This abrupt withdrawal
of insurance capacity had the effect of "freezing out" many municipal and state issuers from the
public finance market and caused the Superintendent and the Department to undertake actions
they believed were necessary to stabilize and revitalize the financial guarantee industry.
(Siegfried Decl., Exh. B). The purpose of the Transformation -- which was discussed with the
Department throughout 2008 -- was, therefore, simple: to establish MBIA Illinois as a separate
insurance company that only insures domestic public finance obligations. As such, it could help
provide lower-cost funds to public issuers and thus facilitate the "unfreezing" of the U.S. public
finance and infrastructure markets. At the same time, the Transformation would preserve MBIA
Insurance as a well-capitalized, solvent insurer. (Id.) As the Superintendent stated:
This is a private sector solution to a public sector concern. It preserves
MBIA's promises to policyholders, while reducing costs and increasing
opportunities for taxpayers. It will aid the federal stimulus efforts by
providing access to the credit markets to fund shovel-ready infrastructure
development, and it will help taxpayers by lowering the cost of that
borrowing. At a time when the demands on the public purse have never
been heavier, this plan accomplishes these goals solely with private
capital.
(Seigfried Decl., Exh. B).4

Far from leaving MBIA Insurance a "looted company … without the ability to pay" its policyholder claims,
Compl. ¶20, the Superintendent and Department found, as more fully described infra, that following the
Transformation, MBIA Insurance would have sufficient surplus to pay all of its existing obligations to the
policyholders and others. (Siegfried Decl., Exhs. A p.6; B).

The Approval of the New York State Department of Insurance
After almost a year of consultations with the Superintendent and the Department,

on December 5, 2008, the MBIA Group submitted a detailed application to the Department
seeking its approval of the Transactions necessary to implement the Transformation. Pursuant to
Insurance Law § 201, the Department is responsible for supervising and regulating all insurance
business in New York State, and the Superintendent possesses "the rights, powers, and duties, in
connection with the business of insurance in this state, expressed or reasonably implied by [the
Insurance Law] or any other applicable law of this state." Accordingly, under § 201 and the
statutory provisions of the Insurance Law set forth below, the Superintendent was required to
approve the Transactions at issue here before they could be implemented.
Following the MBIA Group's submission of its application, the Department, over
the next two (2) months, continued to conduct an extensive review of the application and an
independent investigation of the MBIA Group, including an examination of each of their books
and records and reserving methodologies. Only after this review and investigation was
completed did the Superintendent issue specific written findings and determinations, in a letter
dated February 17, 2009, approving the Transactions. (Siegfried Decl., Exh. A). Thereafter, the
Transactions were undertaken, and the Transformation implemented, according to the explicit
authorization given to the MBIA Group by the Superintendent in the Approval Letter. In
approving the Transactions, the Superintendent and the Department made the following
determinations directly relevant to this motion and warranting dismissal of this lawsuit:
a.

The MBIA Insurance Dividend

The Superintendent approved the distribution of a dividend of approximately
$1.147 billion in cash and securities from MBIA Insurance to MBIA Inc. As set forth below,
this Transaction is now challenged by Plaintiffs. (Compl. ¶45). The Superintendent analyzed

7

Case 1:09-cv-02242-RJS

Document 21

Filed 05/06/2009

Page 15 of 32

this transaction under the statutory requirements of Insurance Law § 4105(a), and issued his
approval after finding (as required by the Insurance Law) that "MBIA [Insurance] will retain
sufficient surplus to support its obligations and writings following the payment of the MBIA
[Insurance] Dividend." The Superintendent reached this determination based upon the
Department's independent analysis of, among other things, "the MBIA Entities' financial
condition prior to the Transformation, and … after the effectuation of the Transformation."
(Siegfried Decl., Exh. A p.6).
b.

The Stock Redemption

The Superintendent approved the redemption by MBIA Insurance of 32,064
shares of its capital stock from MBIA Inc. in exchange for approximately $938 million in cash
and securities and the outstanding shares of MBIA Illinois owned by MBIA Insurance. As set
forth below, these Transactions are also challenged in the Complaint. (Compl. ¶40). The
Superintendent analyzed these transactions under the statutory requirements of Insurance Law
§ 1411(d), and issued his approval after expressly finding (as required by the Insurance Law) that
they were "reasonable and equitable." The determination was based on, among other things, "the
Department's examination of the MBIA Entities' financial condition prior to the Transformation,
and … after the effectuation of the Transformation." (Siegfried Decl., Exh. A p.6).
c.

The Reinsurance Agreement

The Superintendent approved the terms of the reinsurance agreement (the
"Reinsurance Agreement") also now challenged by Plaintiffs, pursuant to which MBIA Illinois
assumed and reinsured $537 billion in bonds previously insured by MBIA Insurance. (See
Compl. ¶41). The Superintendent analyzed this Transaction under the statutory requirements of
Insurance Law §§ 1308, 1505(a) and (d), and 6906 and issued his approval based upon the
following:

8

Case 1:09-cv-02242-RJS

Document 21

Filed 05/06/2009

Page 16 of 32

-

The Department's independent "examination of the MBIA Entities'
financial condition prior to … [and] after the consummation of the
Reinsurance Transaction."

-

The Department's "expertise and knowledge about insurance
companies, the business of insurance and reinsurance, and the
market for reinsurance."

-

The Department's determination that the terms of the Transaction
are "fair and equitable," that the "[c]harges for fees and services
performed [are] 'reasonable'," that "[e]xpenses incurred and
payment received [are] allocated to [MBIA Insurance] on an
equitable basis," and that the Transaction would not "adversely
affect the interests of policyholders," such as Plaintiffs purport to
represent here.

(Siegfried Decl., Exh. A p.7).
The Department further found that "the Reinsurance Agreement incorporates by
reference all New York statutes and Department regulations necessary for MBIA [Insurance] to
realize full credit for the reinsurance being provided," and that MBIA Insurance "will receive full
financial credit, including the ability to release all unearned premiums, contingency and other
reserves applicable to the policies ceded pursuant to the MBIA Reinsurance Agreement." (Id.
p.8). Thus, MBIA Insurance was relieved of over $537 billion of liabilities, which were assumed
and reinsured by MBIA Illinois. (Siegfried Decl., Exh. B).
D.

The Allegations of the Complaint
Plaintiffs allege that the Transactions approved by the Superintendent were either

actual or constructive "fraudulent transfers" that violated §§ 273 through 276 of the New York
Debtor and Creditor Law. (Compl. ¶¶71-85). With much hyperbole and no facts, Plaintiffs
claim that the Transactions were made while MBIA Insurance was insolvent or that they
rendered MBIA Insurance insolvent, leaving MBIA Insurance unable to pay its obligations as
they become due.

9

Case 1:09-cv-02242-RJS

Document 21

Filed 05/06/2009

Page 17 of 32

In making these allegations, Plaintiffs do not – because they cannot – cite to a
single financial obligation that MBIA Insurance has failed to meet, either before or after the
Transactions, much less a failure to pay principal or interest under any of the financial guarantee
policies it has issued.
It is also beyond peradventure that whether MBIA Insurance would be solvent –
and able to meet its obligations after the Transactions were consummated – was the key issue
decided by the Superintendent and the Department. As set forth supra, the Superintendent gave
his approval only after the Department conducted an independent examination of the financial
condition of MBIA Insurance, and only after concluding that MBIA Insurance would remain
fully solvent and able to meet its obligations. As the Superintendent stated:
Both MBIA [Insurance] and [MBIA Illinois] will continue to pay all valid
claims in a timely fashion, and both entities will have sufficient resources
to meet policyholder claims as they come due. Consistent with New York
State Insurance Law, the New York State Insurance Department only
approved the transaction after deciding that both companies would have
sufficient statutory capital to meet the letter and spirit of the Insurance
Law. The review and study process lasted approximately one year.
(Siegfried Decl., Exh. B).5
In asking this Court to set aside the Transactions under the New York Debtor and
Creditor Law, Plaintiffs are either asking this Court to overrule these determinations of the
Superintendent in a proceeding to which the Superintendent is not a party or to ignore the
Superintendent's determination entirely and make its own parallel determination under New
York law. The Court should reject Plaintiffs' invitation to do so and dismiss the Complaint, as

5

Under Insurance Law § 1309(a), the Superintendent is charged with determining whether an insurance company
is or will be insolvent and proceeding against any insurance company under Article 74 of the Insurance Law if
he has any insolvency concerns.

more fully discussed below, under the collateral attack doctrine or under Burford abstention
principles.
Plaintiffs further allege that the Transactions violate the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing in the policies insuring the securities they purport to own, because,
according to Plaintiffs, subsequent to the Transactions the credit ratings for the underlying
securities which they purport to own were downgraded. (Id. ¶81-85). Plaintiffs, however, do not
attach the MBIA Insurance policies to the Complaint – and for good reason. As set forth below
and in Exhibit D to the Siegfried Declaration, the standard policy issued by MBIA Insurance
guarantees one thing and one thing only: the timely payment of principal and interest on the
insured instruments. 6 It contains no guaranty, express or implied, of a particular credit rating for
those instruments.7 Thus, the Superintendent's determination that MBIA Insurance continues to
have sufficient surplus to meet all of its obligations under the policies it issues, as well as his
determination that the Transactions do not "adversely affect the interests of policyholders,"
necessarily encompasses the issues raised in Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim and can only
properly be challenged in an Article 78 proceeding. Moreover, as discussed in Point III infra,
the law is clear that courts will not rewrite or interpret an agreement between sophisticated
parties, such as the parties here, to implicitly impose an obligation the parties did not include.

6

The Court may consider the policy on this motion since it is incorporated by reference in the Complaint. See
San Leandro Emergency Med. Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., 75 F.3d 801, 808-09 (2d Cir.
1996); Caldwell Trucking PRP Group v. Spaulding Composites Co., 890 F. Supp. 1247, 1252 (D.N.J. 1995).

7

Nor could MBIA Insurance guarantee or promise any particular ratings, since the ratings are established by
independent third-party rating companies. In fact, Plaintiffs themselves concede that MBIA Insurance's credit
rating was downgraded by the rating agencies in early 2008, almost a year before the Transactions they now
challenge. (Compl. ¶34). Furthermore, the ratings issued by the rating agencies subsequent to the
Transformation reflect their own independent determination that MBIA Insurance is solvent.

Accordingly, this Court should dismiss the Complaint (a) as an improper
collateral attack on the determinations of the Superintendent, (b) under well-established
principles of abstention, and (c) for failure to properly plead and state a claim under both the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and New York State law.
ARGUMENT
I.
THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS AN IMPROPER COLLATERAL
ATTACK ON THE DECISION OF THE NEW YORK SUPERINTENDENT OF
INSURANCE
Notwithstanding the labels attached to their causes of action, Plaintiffs cannot
dispute that this lawsuit, as set forth above, challenges decisions made by the Superintendent on
issues falling directly within his supervisory or regulatory authority pursuant to §§ 201, 1308,
1411(d), 1505(a) and (d), 4105(a) and 6906 of the Insurance Law. In their Prayer for Relief,
Plaintiffs specifically request that this Court annul the decisions of the Superintendent and the
Department by declaring the MBIA Insurance Dividend, the Stock Redemption, the transfer of
MBIA Illinois stock to MBIA Inc., and the Reinsurance Transaction "null and void" and "setting
them aside."
The Complaint, as such, is an impermissible collateral attack on the decisions of
the Superintendent and must be dismissed. Fiala v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 776 N.Y.S.2d 29, 31, 6
A.D.3d 320, 322 (1st Dept. 2004) (upholding dismissal of claims against insurer for breach of
contract, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud as "collateral attacks on the Superintendent's
approval" of the insurer's demutualization plan); Shah v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2003 WL 728869,
at *10-11 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Feb. 21, 2003) ("claim … directed at the very issues … considered and
addressed by the Superintendent in his review and approval of the Plan … constitutes a collateral
attack on that decision"); Academic Health Prof'ls Ins. Ass'n. v. MQ of New York, Inc., No. 01

Civ. 605452, 2003 WL 25668211 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Apr. 14, 2003) ("arguments are not considered
here because they are an impermissible collateral attack on the Superintendent's decision"); In re
Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield Customer Litig., 622 N.Y.S.2d 843, 846-47 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.
1994).
As the Court held in Shah, 2003 WL 728869, at *12:
[P]laintiffs have indicated nothing in either the statute, or its legislative
history, from which a private right of action, asserted directly against [the
insurer], could be maintained on those very issues which fall directly
within the supervisory or regulatory authority of the Superintendent. To
the extent that plaintiffs feel that the Superintendent's determination of
these issues was improper, they are authorized to bring an Article 78
proceeding to challenge such determination. Permitting plaintiffs to
simply disregard and bypass the Superintendent's decision, and bring an
action directly against [the insurer] on the very issues necessarily
encompassed in that decision, would not be consistent with the overall
legislative scheme.
Indeed, to hold otherwise and permit this action to proceed against an insurer who
relied in good faith on the approvals of the Superintendent and the Department would undermine
both the authority of the Superintendent and the legislative scheme for regulation of insurance
companies in New York.
The fact that Plaintiffs have brought their claims as violations of the Debtor and
Creditor Law and under common law is legally irrelevant. As the court held in Shah, "Even
though couched in terms of breach of fiduciary duty or fraud, a claim which seeks, indirectly, to
challenge the sufficiency of a Plan which was approved by the Superintendent, constitutes a
collateral attack on that approval, and must be made in an Article 78 proceeding." Id. at *13.
Here, the critical issues upon which Plaintiffs' claims rest – i.e., whether the Transactions
rendered MBIA Insurance insolvent and whether they adversely affected the interests of
policyholders – were all considered and squarely addressed by the Superintendent in his decision

13

Case 1:09-cv-02242-RJS

Document 21

Filed 05/06/2009

Page 21 of 32

and approval. Accordingly, since Plaintiffs' claims collaterally attack the Superintendent's
Approval, they must be made in an Article 78 proceeding to which the Superintendent is a party.8
This legal principle, mandating dismissal of claims that are collateral attacks on
decisions of state regulators, is firmly established under New York law and is not limited in its
application to the area of insurance law. See, e.g., Brawer v. Johnson, 647 N.Y.S.2d 553, 554,
231 A.D.2d 664 (2d Dept. 1996) (claims of fraud, misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty
"[i]n essence … constituted a collateral attack on" conversion plan approved by New York State
Superintendent of Banks which could only be brought as an Article 78 proceeding); In re East
New York Sav. Bank Depositors Litig., 547 N.Y.S.2d 497, 499 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1989) State v.
Khan, 615 N.Y.S.2d 771, 772, 206 A.D.2d 732, 733 (3d Dept. 1994); Ass'n for Cmty. Reform
Now v. Bloomberg, 824 N.Y.S.2d 752, 2006 WL 2686520, at *18 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Sept. 19, 2006);
Steen v. Quaker State Corp., 785 N.Y.S.2d 551, 552, 12 A.D.3d 989, 990 (3d Dept. 2004).
These cases also clearly hold that Plaintiffs' exclusive remedy is an Article 78
proceeding in New York State Court naming the Superintendent, not a back door plenary action
against the insurer. The New York State Legislature has expressly provided that any person
aggrieved by a decision of the Superintendent has the right to challenge that decision, whether or
not they were a party to that determination, or had prior notice of it. Insurance Law § 326.
("Notwithstanding the specific enumerations of the right to judicial review in this chapter, any

The case of Marine Midland Bank v. Home Insurance Co., 693 N.Y.S.2d 550, 551, 263 A.D.2d 374, 374 (1st
Dept. 1999), cited by Plaintiffs at the Preliminary Conference held by this Court on May 1, 2009, does not
change this result. In Marine Midland, the Appellate Division allowed a creditor's claim against an insurer to
proceed only after finding that "the issues in the instant action [are not] the same as those that were before the
sister State administrative body, which was not bound to consider the interests of creditors. Thus, there is no
potential for conflict or for subversion of the sister State Order." Id. Here, by contrast and as set forth above,
the issues before the Court are the very issues considered by the Superintendent, who was also required by the
Insurance Law to consider the interests of policyholders in connection with the Approval.

order, regulation or decision of the superintendent is declared to be subject to judicial review in a
proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.").
In directing that challenges to the Superintendent's decisions be brought in an
Article 78 proceeding, Section 326 makes no distinction between decisions that are issued by the
Superintendent pursuant to provisions of the Insurance Law requiring notice and hearing (see,
e.g., Shah, 2003 WL 728869, at *2; Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. New York, 840 N.E.2d 68,
74 (N.Y. 2005)), and those that are issued without notice and hearing (see, e.g., Prior v. Board of
Trustees of New York Fire Department Pension Fund, 800 N.Y.S.2d 355 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004);
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Levin, 702 N.Y.S.2d 694, 697, 263 A.D.2d 233,
237-38 (3d Dept. 2000)). Under New York's statutory scheme, the only relevance to whether a
party had notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of a decision by the
Superintendent is whether the challenge will be decided under the legal standard set forth in
CPLR § 7803(3) (when there has been no notice and hearing) or § 7803(4) (where there has), and
whether the case will be heard at the trial level of the New York State Supreme Court or at a
term of the Appellate Division. See CPLR § 7804(g).
Indeed, Plaintiffs' attempt at the Preliminary Conference to argue that the
collateral attack doctrine should be limited to cases where the Superintendent issued his decision
after public notice and hearing is undercut by the very case they cite for this proposition, Shah.
In Shah, plaintiffs challenged certain aspects of a plan where the Superintendent's approval
followed a vote by policyholders on the plan and notice and hearing by the Superintendent.
Shah, 2003 WL 728869, at *4. However, the Shah plaintiffs also challenged an amendment to
the plan which was approved by the Superintendent subsequent to the policyholder vote and
without any notice or hearing to plaintiffs by the Superintendent. Id. at *6. The Court dismissed

15

this claim as well as a collateral attack on the decision of the Superintendent that could only be
brought as an Article 78 proceeding. Id. at *12-13.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs' collateral attack on these determinations of the
Superintendent, and their request that this Court set aside the Transactions e approved, should be
dismissed.
II.
UNDER BURFORD v. SUN OIL, THE COURT SHOULD ABSTAIN IN FAVOR OF
STATE COURT REVIEW OF THE NEW YORK STATE INSURANCE
DEPARTMENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATIONS AND DISMISS THE
COMPLAINT
The Court should also abstain from exercising its jurisdiction in this case under
the well-established abstention doctrine of Burford and its progeny. Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319
U.S. 315 (1943); Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996); Louisiana Power &
Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25 (1959). As the Supreme Court has held, a federal
court should decline to interfere with the proceedings or orders of state administrative agencies
where (1) there are "difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial
public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar," or (2) where the
"exercise of federal review of the question in a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of
state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern."
New Orleans Public Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989) ("NOPSI")
(citing Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976)). That
is precisely what Plaintiffs ask this Court to do. They request that this Court set aside and
unwind the Transactions approved by the Superintendent after careful review and an independent
analysis by the Department in accordance with New York's regulatory scheme as embodied in its
Insurance Law. See, e.g,. Insurance Law §§ 201, 301, et seq.; Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

(N.Y. 1962); Med. Soc'y of State v. Serio, 800 N.E.2d 728, 733 (N.Y. 2003) ("Responsibility for
administering the Insurance Law rests with the Superintendent of Insurance … who has broad
power to interpret, clarify and implement the legislative policy").9
In Levy, 635 F.2d. at 963, the Second Circuit held, in language relevant here, that
Burford abstention applies to decisions of the Superintendent. As the Court stated:
New York State has a complex administrative and judicial system for
regulating … domestic insurance companies. … It is also highly
significant that the state scheme has been adopted pursuant to
congressional authorization. In the McCarran-Ferguson Act … Congress
mandated that regulation of the insurance industry be left to the individual
states. Thus the administrative and judicial scheme erected by New York
to regulate insurance companies … operates pursuant to an express federal
policy of noninterference in insurance matters.
See also Law Enforcement Ins. Co. v. Corcoran, 807 F.2d 38, 43-44 (2d Cir. 1986); Corcoran v.
Ardra Ins. Co., 842 F.2d 31, 37 (2d Cir. 1988).
According to the Court of Appeals, in deciding a motion to abstain, the Court
should determine whether an adequate state law remedy exists and then weigh three key factors,
all of which heavily favor abstention here: (1) the "degree of specificity of the state regulatory
scheme"; (2) the "necessity of a discretionary interpretation" of the state statute; and (3) "whether
the subject matter of the litigation is traditionally one of state concern." Bethpage Lutheran Serv.
9

Although Plaintiffs also purport to seek damages for the alleged fraudulent conveyances (Prayer for Relief ¶D),
Plaintiffs fundamentally seek equitable relief – declarations that the Transactions and the Superintendent's
determinations approving them are "null and void," and that they be "set aside." (Id. ¶¶B and C). Abstention is
thus squarely appropriate. See Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 719-721, 730 (1996) ("We have not strictly limited
abstention to 'equitable cases' … but rather have extended the doctrine to all cases in which a federal court is
asked to provide some form of discretionary relief.") (citing, e.g., Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25). Indeed, abstention
may be appropriate even in cases involving only money damages. Easter v. Am. W. Fin., 202 F. Supp. 2d 1150,
1155 (W.D. Wash. 2002) ("it is now well-established that [abstention doctrines, including Burford] apply to
actions at law"). Additionally, to the extent Plaintiffs’ suit is one for declaratory relief, this Court possesses
additional discretion to abstain. See Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U.S. 491 (1942); Wilton v. Seven Falls
Co., 515 U.S. 277 (1995).

Inc. v. Weicker, 965 F.2d 1239, 1243 (2d Cir. 1992) (citing Hanlin Group, Inc. v. Power Auth. of
New York, 703 F. Supp. 305, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). In this case, an adequate state remedy
clearly exists since Plaintiffs may (and must) challenge the Transactions in an Article 78
proceeding in New York State court. Furthermore, each of the three key factors to be considered
by the Court supports abstention: (1) New York has a complex, detailed insurance regulatory
scheme, pursuant to which the challenged Transactions were approved; (2) under that scheme,
the Superintendent, utilizing the Department's specialized expertise, made discretionary
determinations interpreting the Insurance Law; and (3) the Superintendent made those
determinations in furtherance of insurance regulatory policy, an area that is unquestionably and
traditionally one of state concern.10
A.

Adequate State Court Review Is Available In an Article 78 Proceeding
As the Second Circuit has held, Plaintiffs have an adequate state law remedy to

challenge decisions of the Superintendent – in this case the Approval of the Transactions –
through an Article 78 proceeding in New York State court. See Insurance Law § 326; Levy, 635
F.2d at 963; see also Stephens, 746 F. Supp. at 296; Hanlin, 703 F. Supp. at 308; Law
Enforcement Ins. Co., 807 F.2d at 43 n.8.

New York Has a Complex, Extensive Insurance Regulatory Scheme
As the court observed in Hanlin, "[f]oremost among the factors considered is the

presence of a sophisticated and extensive state regulatory scheme involving a complicated area
of special state concern." Hanlin, 703 F. Supp. at 308. It is well-settled that "New York has set

10

Just as notice and the availability of a hearing are irrelevant to the "collateral attack" analysis, see Section I,
supra, so too are they irrelevant to Burford abstention analysis. See Sun Oil Co. v. Burford, 130 F.2d 10, 15
(5th Cir. 1942) (noting that "[w]hether the Commission heard evidence or not is immaterial; it is not required to
take testimony or make findings of fact before promulgating its orders"), rev’d on other grounds, 319 U.S. 315,

up a comprehensive plan of regulation of insurance companies," and courts have considered all
aspects of insurance regulation to fall within its complexity. Law Enforcement Ins. Co., 807 F.2d
at 43; see also Levy, 635 F.2d at 963; Alliance of Am. Insurers v. Cuomo, 854 F.2d 591, 600 (2d
Cir. 1988); Serio v. Black, Davis & Shue Agency, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 4914, 2005 WL 2560390, at
*3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2005); Stephens, 746 F. Supp. at 294-95.
To approve the Transactions, the Superintendent was required to determine that
they complied with New York's complex regulatory scheme. As set forth in the Approval Letter,
the Superintendent and the Department reviewed the Transactions and issued determinations
under no less than seven (7) different Articles and Sections of the Insurance Law, including
Sections 1308, 1411, 4105, 6904, 6906 and Articles 15 and 71, which, in turn, cross-reference
and require consideration of other Sections and Articles of the Insurance Law. (Siegfried Decl.,
Exh. A).
Accordingly, application of this factor dictates in favor of Burford abstention.
C.

The Superintendent Must Make Discretionary Interpretations of New York
Insurance Laws
The Superintendent was required to make discretionary determinations under the

Insurance Law as part of the Approval including, inter alia, (a) what constituted "sufficient
surplus to support [the insurer's] obligations and writings" (Insurance Law § 4105(a) (emphasis
added)); (b) whether the "plan of stock redemption and retirement … [was] reasonable and
equitable" (Insurance Law § 1411(d) (emphasis added)); (c) whether the reinsurance agreement
would "adversely affect the interests of policyholders," and had terms that were "fair and
equitable" (Insurance Law § 1505(a)-(e) (emphases added)); and (d) whether, in the aggregate,
the series of actions in the Transformation constituted a "transfer of all or substantially all of the
assets "of MBIA Insurance. (Insurance Law §§ 7101(g), 7105(a) (emphasis added)). See

Bethpage, 965 F.2d at 1243-44 (where "reasonable persons can disagree as to what constitutes
reasonable payments," the "statutory framework … necessarily invokes the expertise and best
judgment of the Commissioner"); see also Travelers Ins. Co. v. Home Ins. Co., 1999 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 5523, at *4-6 & n.3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 22, 1999) (abstaining under Burford where state
Insurance Department found plan was "fair and reasonable to policyholders," provided "adequate
policyholder protection," and was "in the best interest of policyholders and the public"). These
determinations were based, among other things, on the Department's "expertise and knowledge
about insurance companies, the business of insurance and reinsurance, and the market for
reinsurance." (Siegfried Decl., Exh. A p.7).
Accordingly, resolution of this factor, as well, warrants abstention.
D.

Insurance Regulation Is Traditionally a State Concern
Finally, it is well established that the regulation of insurance is an area of

exclusive and overriding state concern. Congress enacted the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15
U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., for the specific purpose of consigning to the states broad and primary
responsibility for regulating the insurance industry. See SEC v. Nat'l Sec., Inc., 393 U.S. 453,
458 (1969); Levy, 635 F.2d at 963 ("The administrative and judicial scheme erected by New
York to regulate insurance companies … operates pursuant to an express federal policy of
noninterference in insurance matters."); see also Law Enforcement Ins. Co., 807 F.2d at 44 (the
McCarran-Ferguson Act embodies the "express federal policy of noninterference in insurance
matters"); Am. Centennial Ins. Co. v. Armco, Inc., 746 F. Supp. 350, 355-56 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)
(recounting the history of state primacy in insurance regulation, culminating in the McCarranFerguson Act). Furthermore, as set forth supra, the Superintendent made clear that in approving
the Transactions, New York State had a strong public interest "as part of the stimulus plan" to
unfreeze the municipal bond market so that municipalities could "increase spending for

infrastructure projects" such as "building bridges or schools, housing or hospitals." (Siegfried
Decl., Exh. B).
There are, by contrast, no federal claims asserted in this case. See Lac D'Amiante
Du Quebec, Ltee v. Am. Home Assur. Co., 864 F.2d 1033, 1044 (3d Cir. 1988) ("federal courts
more readily abstain from a case that contains no issue of federal law") (citing Moses H. Cone
Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 26 (1983)); see also Law Enforcement Ins.
Co., 807 F.2d at 43; Am. Centennial, 746 F. Supp. at 356.
Accordingly, since all three factors strongly weigh in favor of abstention, Burford
and its progeny mandate abstention here.
III.
THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM
PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6)
All three counts of the Complaint should also be dismissed for failure to properly
plead and state a valid cause of action.
A.

Counts I and II for Fraudulent Conveyance and Constructive Fraudulent
Conveyance Fail to State a Claim
In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the Supreme Court held that to withstand a

motion to dismiss, the "[f]actual allegations" contained in the complaint "must be enough to raise
a right to relief above the speculative level." 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). The facts alleged must
be "plausible" not merely "conceivable." Id. at 570. Plaintiffs must plead "more than labels and
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Id. at
555 (internal citations omitted); see also Ruotolo v. City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir.
2008); Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2007); ATSI Commc'ns. Inc. v. Shaar Fund,
Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007); Concepcion v. City of New York, No. 05 Civ. 8501, 2008
WL 2020363, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2008).

Here, however, a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action" is all
that Plaintiffs offer. Counts I and II consist of nothing more than conclusory allegations
parroting the legal standards set forth in §§ 273, 274 and 276 of New York's Debtor and Creditor
Law.
Noticeably absent from the Complaint are "plausible" facts to support Plaintiffs'
conclusions that the "transfers and the restructuring as a whole were undertaken and designed
with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud MBIA Insurance's present and future creditors"
(Count I, ¶74), that the Transactions were made "without adequate consideration" (Count I, ¶72;
Count II, ¶77), or that the Transactions "were made at a time when MBIA Insurance was
insolvent or caused MBIA Insurance to become insolvent." (Count I, ¶73; Count II, ¶78).
Plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent intent in Count I of the Complaint also fail to meet the
heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). See e.g., In re Sharp Int'l
Corp., 403 F.3d 43, 56 (2d Cir. 2005) ("As 'actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud' constitutes
fraud … it must be pled with specificity, as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b)").
Substituting pejorative rhetoric for plausible facts, the Complaint is replete with
conclusory accusations of "looting," "stripping," "avarice" and "greed." However, as set forth
supra, the Superintendent and the Department found, based upon their own independent and
extensive examination of the financial statements of MBIA Insurance, that the challenged
Transactions were "reasonable and equitable" and that MBIA Insurance, both prior and
subsequent to the Transactions, was solvent and able to pay all of its obligations as they became
due. (Siegfried Decl., Exh. A). See Hirsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 72 F.3d 1085, 1095 (2d
Cir. 1995) (affirming dismissal where "attenuated allegations" supporting plaintiff's claim "are
contradicted … by facts of which we may take judicial notice").

These determinations are uniquely within the expertise of the Superintendent who
is charged with determining whether an insurance company is solvent and is obligated to take
action if they are not. Insurance Law § 1309(a).11 In fact, Plaintiffs do not allege – because they
cannot – that MBIA Insurance has defaulted on any of its payment obligations under any of the
insurance policies it issued.
Finally, contrary to Plaintiffs' unsupported allegations that the MBIA Group acted
with an intent to defraud creditors, the Approval Letter establishes that the MBIA Group
responsibly presented the Transactions to the Superintendent and the Department for their
thorough and complete independent review, and proceeded with the Transactions only after
receiving written approval from the Superintendent, all in accordance with New York Law.
In short, Counts I and II consist of conclusory allegations and unfounded
speculation, not "plausible facts," which are expressly refuted by the determinations of the
Superintendent and the Department. As such, these counts should be dismissed pursuant to the
Supreme Court holding in Twombly and the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).
B.

Count III for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Fails
to State a Claim
Plaintiffs' claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing

must also be dismissed because Plaintiffs seek to recover for an obligation that is neither
explicitly nor implicitly part of the policies issued by MBIA Insurance. The only contracts that

11

Section 1309(a) of the Insurance Law provides:
Whenever the superintendent finds from a financial statement or report on examination that an authorized
insurer is unable to pay its outstanding lawful obligations as they mature in the regular course of business,
as shown by an excess of required reserves and other liabilities over admitted assets, or by its not having
sufficient assets to reinsure all outstanding risks with other solvent authorized assuming insurers after
paying all accrued claims owed, such insurer shall be deemed insolvent and the superintendent may
proceed against it pursuant to the provisions of article seventy-four of this chapter.

purportedly exist between Plaintiffs and MBIA Insurance, and thus the only contracts that could
give rise to a claim for breach of the implied covenant, are the insurance polices issued by MBIA
Insurance. 12 These policies (Siegfried Decl., Exh. D), which Plaintiffs do not attach to their
Complaint, provide that MBIA Insurance guarantees the payment of principal and interest on the
instruments they insure, nothing more, and Plaintiffs do not allege that MBIA Insurance has
failed to honor this guarantee.
Plaintiffs' contention that there is an implied guarantee of a particular credit rating
in the policies is incorrect. While a guarantee of payment of principal and interest may have the
effect of enhancing the credit of the underlying instrument – since it provides an additional
source of payment – it does not imply a particular credit rating. If Plaintiffs had wanted the
guarantee of a particular credit rating, they should have negotiated for such a guarantee, or for
default "triggers" in the policy if the credit rating declined after issuance of the policy. They did
not. As the New York Court of Appeals has held, courts will not rewrite or interpret an
agreement between sophisticated parties so as to implicitly impose an obligation the parties did
not include. See Rowe v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., Inc., 385 N.E.2d 566, 572 (N.Y. 1978); see
also ARI and Co., Inc. v. Regent Int'l Corp., 273 F. Supp. 2d 518, 523-24 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)
("[T]he breach of covenant of good faith claim must be dismissed because it seeks to recover for
obligations that were not explicitly part of the Agreement. New York law is clear that the
implied covenant cannot be used to create independent obligations beyond the contract."); Wolff
12

Although Plaintiffs also refer in the Complaint to some unnamed and unidentified offering materials which
were not prepared by MBIA Insurance, these materials are clearly not a contract between MBIA Insurance and
Plaintiffs and cannot give rise to a claim under the implied covenant of good faith. See Brown v. AXA Re, No.
02 Civ. 10138, 2004 WL 941959, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2004); Tang v. Jinro Am., Inc., No. 03 Civ. 6477,
2008 WL 4163183, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008). Even as to these unnamed and unidentified documents,
Plaintiffs contend that the only representation MBIA Insurance "accepted" was the statement that MBIA
Insurance would "unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee" timely payments of principal and interest, i.e., no
more than what the policies provide. (Compl. ¶25).

v. Rare Medium, Inc., 210 F. Supp. 2d 490, 497 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) ("the obligation of good faith
does not create obligations that go beyond those intended and stated in the language of the
contract"); Warner Theatre Assocs. Ltd. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., No. 97 Civ. 4914, 1997 WL
685334, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 4, 1997) ("[t]he duty of good faith cannot add to, detract from, or
alter the terms of the contract itself"); Long v. Marubeni Am. Corp., No. 05 Civ. 0639, 2006 WL
1716878, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jun. 20, 2006) (same); JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. IDW Group,
LLC, No. 08 Civ. 9116, 2009 WL 321222, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 09, 2009) (same).
Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing – which seeks to impose an obligation that is not a part of the policies – should be
dismissed as a matter of law.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants MBIA Inc., MBIA Insurance, and MBIA
Illinois respectfully request that the Complaint be dismissed and that they be awarded their costs
and expenses and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.
