GOOGLE, INC. AND YAHOO!, INC.

GOOGLE’S MOTION TO SEAL DOCUMENTS AND CLOSE THE COURTROOM
DURING PRESENTATION OF CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL AT TRIAL

Dockets.Justia.com

Introduction
By the very nature of this patent infringement suit, Plaintiff has access to some of
Google’s most sensitive confidential information. Due to the strong protective order entered by
this Court, Google has produced millions of pages of materials that include some of the
company’s most highly sensitive engineering and finance records without troubling the Court
with the concerns the company would otherwise have. While Google respects the right of public
access to judicial proceedings, public dissemination of this information would cause considerable
harm to Google’s competitive standing; allowing companies to compete against Google without
the years of refinement and significant financial outlay Google has invested in these trade secrets
and other sensitive information. The strong public interest in protecting this kind of sensitive
commercial information from disclosure outweighs the common law presumption of public
access to judicial proceedings. Thus, testimony related to the confidential operations of
Google’s products, and any testimony regarding Google’s nonpublic financial data, should be
shielded from public disclosure. Accordingly, Google asks the Court to close the courtroom
whenever testimony regarding Google’s sensitive commercial information is offered at trial, and
to seal all documents and portions of transcripts discussing Google’s sensitive commercial
information. Once the parties exchange their exhibit lists and deposition designations, Google
will supplement this motion with a specific and narrowly tailored list of evidence that should not
be heard in open court, along with tailored evidence and testimony justifying the request.
Argument
I.

COURTS DENY PUBLIC ACCESS TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS WHEN
DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION COULD
HARM A PARTY’S COMPETITIVE STANDING.
While there is a common law right of public access to judicial proceedings, that right is

not a constitutional right and it is “not absolute.” See Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc.,

01980.51542/3135054.1

1

435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978); Belo Broadcasting Corp. v. Clark, 654 F.2d 423, 432 (5th Cir.
1981)(“The common law right of access certainly antedates the Constitution's free press
guarantee, but it does not rise to that level of importance or merit the same degree of
protection.”).
The decision to close the courtroom is vested in the discretion of the trial court, with the
Firth Circuit directing that the “court must balance the public’s common law right of access
against the interests favoring non-disclosure.” SEC v. Van Waeyenberghe, 900 F.2d 845, 848
(5th Cir. 1993). See also Motorola, Inc. v. Analog Devices, Inc., 2003 WL 25778434 (E.D. Tex.
2003).1 The common law provides only a presumption of public access, which is just one of the
interests to be weighed in favor of disclosure. See Belo, 654 F. 2d at 434; Van Waeyeberghe, 900
F.2d at 848 n4 (“we have refused to assign a particular weight to the right.”). Where, as here,
only private commercial interests—as opposed to questions of public policy—are involved, the
interest in public access is diminished. See In re Iowa Freedom of Information Council, 724 F.2d
658, 664 (8th Cir. 1984) (“Where only private commercial interests or damage are involved, we
think the law justifies the steps taken by the District Court to [prevent public disclosure]”). The
Fifth Circuit has also explicitly rejected other circuits’ holdings that “only the most compelling
circumstances” can rebut that presumption. See Belo, 654 F.2d at 434 (“With all due respect, we
find such standards to be misreadings of the Supreme Court’s directives, and we decline to apply
them here”); Van Waeyenberghe, 900 F.2d at 848 n4 (“While other circuits have held that there

Though Motorola and other cases cited in this brief discuss the common law right to
inspect and copy judicial records, courts have concluded that “identical interests” support both
the public’s right to inspect and copy and the public’s right of access to trials, and look to both
lines of cases as authority for each. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd.,
529 F. Supp. 866, 895 (E.D. Pa. 1981)

01980.51542/3135054.1

is a strong presumption in favor of the public’s common law right of access to judicial records,
we have refused to assign a particular weight to the right.”).
In stark contrast to the diminished interests in public access to these proceedings, there
are strong interests in favor of protecting Google’s confidential commercial information from
disclosure. “[T]here can be no doubt that society in general is interested in the protection of
trade secrets and other valuable commercial information. That interest is recognized, for
example, in Rule 26(c)(7), in our copyright, trademark, and patent statues, and in the common
law of business torts.” Zenith Radio, 529 F. Supp. at 905. Protecting confidential information
such as trade secrets is important since “[t]heir only value consists in their being kept private. If
they are disclosed or revealed, they are destroyed.” In re Iowa Freedom of Information Council,
724 F.2d at 662.
Accordingly, courts frequently deny public access when disclosure of confidential
commercial information could “harm a litigant’s competitive standing.” See Nixon, 435 U.S. at
598. See also New York v. Microsoft Corp., 2002 WL 1315804 (D.D.C. 2002); Standard &
Poor’s Corp., Inc. v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 541 F. Supp. 1273, 1277 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)(“the
right to attend judicial proceedings should, in appropriate circumstances, give way to the right to
protect one’s trade secrets”); Zenith Radio Corp., 529 F. Supp. at 901 (E.D. Pa. 1981) (“Judicial
proceedings and records may be closed in part or in full to the public in order to protect private
interests, including proprietary interest in trade secrets and other commercial information”). The
Court should do the same here.
II.

THE DISCLOSURE OF GOOGLE’S CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL
INFORMATION AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE COULD HARM GOOGLE’S
COMPETITIVE STANDING.
Since this motion was due before the parties exchanged exhibit lists, Google does not

know what the full scope of evidence will be at trial, and in particular what Plaintiff intends to
01980.51542/3135054.1

3

introduce. Given that, Google cannot specify at this time the evidence that should be shielded
from disclosure in open court, or the evidence or testimony that would fall within those
categories. Once the parties exchange their exhibit lists and deposition designations, Google will
supplement this motion with a specific and narrowly tailored list of evidence that should not be
heard in open court, along with tailored evidence and testimony justifying the request. In light of
the above legal principles, Google does not intend to cast a wide net across everything that it has
produced.
Based on the discovery to date, however, Google believes Plaintiff will introduce
evidence regarding the design and technology underlying Google’s products, as well as
nonpublic highly sensitive financial information. The Court should close the courtroom when
this evidence is heard because its public dissemination could harm Google’s competitive
standing.
A.

Google’s Technology and Product Design and Operations Are Highly
Confidential.

There can be no dispute that evidence related to the design and technology underlying
Google’s search and advertising products are trade secrets that must be protected. In Viacom
Int’l, Inc. v. Youtube Inc., 253 F.R.D. 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), the court found that the source code
underlying Google’s search technology is “the product of over a thousand person-years of work”
and that “[t]here is no dispute that its secrecy is of enormous commercial value. Someone with
access to it could readily perceive its basic design principles, and cause catastrophic competitive
harm to Google by sharing them with others who might create their programs without making
the same investment.” Id. at 259. With respect to Google’s AdWords program—one of the
accused products in this case—the court found that the schema for the AdWords database
“constitutes commercially sensitive information regarding Google’s advertising business, the

01980.51542/3135054.1

4

disclosure of which would permit others to profit without equivalent investment from the years
of refinement and thousands of person hours of work Google spent.” Id. at 263.
Of particular concern in this litigation is disclosure of Google’s technology and methods
for delivering ads to end users. Google’s superior ability to deliver relevant ads faster and more
accurately than its competitors derives, in large part, from its highly confidential process of
directing calls for ads to the one (of its many) data centers best positioned to respond, and the
technology used to process and reply to those calls. Google has invested significant resources in
building, maintaining, and improving this technology, and its public disclosure would allow
competitors to adopt Google’s trade secrets without making the same investment Google did.
In Standard & Poor’s Corp., Inc. v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 541 F. Supp. 1273
(S.D.N.Y. 1982), the court closed the courtroom to hear testimony about S&P’s confidential
business procedures relating to the development and composition of the S&P 500 Index. A news
service sought access to the transcripts from the hearing but the court denied the request,
reasoning that the sealed testimony “constitute[d] trade secret information not available to the
general public and that this information if released would reveal how S&P maintains its position
as the most reliable and accurate of the stock market indexers to the irreparable detriment of
S&P.” Id. at 1277. Similarly, releasing Google’s technology to the general public would reveal
how Google’s contextual targeting operates and how Google routes search requests to the
appropriate data centers and processes those requests—the very key to Google’s competitive
advantage in being the quickest and most accurate of the search engines in the industry. Indeed,
many of the key engineering documents Google produced in response to Plaintiff’s requests are
potentially more valuable to competitors than the source code, as they explain in plain English
the various steps involved in the delivery of Google’s AdWords and AdSense products.

Assuming Plaintiff intends to use those documents—which are presumably more accessible to a
jury—and elicit testimony regarding their content, Google will face considerable harm if the
record and courtroom remains completely open to the public.
Testimony may also reveal the way in which data flow is managed among all of Google’s
data centers—how each of the data centers are programmed, updated, backed up, and
synchronized with each other to provide a seamless experience to the user. Public access to this
information would not only allow competitors to copy Google’s processes, but it would empower
hackers’ and other malevolent actors’ ability to sabotage Google’s products. By understanding
Google’s system of interconnected data centers, and how information flows among them, a
saboteur could attempt to disable Google’s ad service—a harm affecting not only Google’s
business, but also impacting Google’s advertising clients and partners.
Accordingly, the Court should close the courtroom when information about this process
is offered at trial, and seal all documents and portions of transcripts related to this testimony.
B.

The Disclosure of Google’s Nonpublic Financial Data Could Harm Google’s
Competitive Standing.

Google also asks the Court to seal the courtroom for any testimony related to its
nonpublic financial data. Courts typically find that a party’s interest in maintaining the
confidentiality of nonpublic financial information outweighs the common law right to public
access. See e.g. Flexible Benefits Council v. Feldman, 2008 WL 4924711 (E.D. Va. 2008)
(holding that Plaintiff’s interest in preserving the confidentiality of financial data normally
unavailable to the public outweighs public’s interest to access).
Here, Google has produced substantial financial information data to Plaintiff that is not
disclosed to the public, including detailed revenue data broken down by geographic locale,
product type, features, and the format of the ads. Such information would be a gold mine to

01980.51542/3135054.1

6

Google’s competitors, enabling them to evaluate which of Google’s products and strategies are
the most profitable, which features attract the most users and customers, and how much Google
has paid for certain confidential strategic acquisitions. Google produced all of this information
in good faith pursuant to the Court’s protective order; it should not now face damaging public
access to such materials in order to exercise its right to a trial. Due to the obviously sensitive
nature of this information, the Court should close the courtroom when any evidence of Google’s
nonpublic financial information is offered at trial, and seal all documents and portions of
transcripts related to this evidence.
III.

PLAINTIFF OFFERED NO REASONABLE BASIS TO OPPOSE THIS
REQUEST TO CLOSE THE COURTROOM.
Google reached out to Plaintiff to ask whether it would agree to join this motion, and

close the courtroom when confidential commercial information is offered at trial. Plaintiff
refused to consent to this motion, yet did not articulate a single reason why it would refrain from
doing so. Thus, there appears to be no legitimate, non-tactical reason why Plaintiff would
oppose this request.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should close the courtroom during the presentation
of confidential commercial information at trial.
