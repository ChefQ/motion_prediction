STATEMENT OF NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff Donald M. Durkin (“Durkin”) has asserted a breach of contract, various tort
claims and a civil rights claim against the City of Newark and Individual Defendants
(cumulatively “Newark”). Durkin seeks to exclude any alternative arguments offered by Newark
relating to the termination of Durkin’s contract.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Newark is entitled under Fed. Rule. C.P. 8(e)(2) to advance alternative theories of
defense, being that the November 21, 2003 letter satisfied Newark’s obligations and, if it did not,
that its February 4 letter did. To prevent Newark from presenting evidence of the February 4
letter and advancing its alternative theory of defense would violate Rule 8(e)(2), hamper the
defense, and unduly prejudice Newark.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Durkin’s breach of contract action arises out of the termination by Newark of Durkin’s
contract for the Reservoir project. Durkin argues that the termination was wrongful, both
factually and procedurally as required by the contract, which includes a seven-day notice
provision. Newark contends that a letter sent November 21, 2003 satisfied the seven-day
requirement, and that even if it did not, the requirement was met by another letter sent February 4
providing an additional seven days.
ARGUMENT
It is uncontested that Newark’s position is that the November 21, 2003 letter provided the
requisite seven day notice required by the construction contract termination provision. Newark

has, in the alternative, argued that even if the November 21 letter did not satisfy the seven day
notice requirement, another seven days notice was given on February 4, 2004 which would also
satisfy the contract. As Newark stated in its Answering Brief in opposition to Durkin’s Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment (D.I. #45):
Amazingly, Durkin fails to inform this Court that the arguable technical error, if
error can even be found, was quickly rectified. By letter the next day, Newark
offered to extend the time for termination by seven days.
Durkin’s Motion was denied, and yet again, Durkin attempts to force the Court to revisit
the issue and preclude evidence of the February 4, 2004 letter (which specifically is the subject of
another Motion in Limine filed by Federal).
Fed. Rule. C.P. Rule 8(e)(2) allows a party to set forth inconsistent, alternative and
hypothetical pleading. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has cautioned against conflicts
between this alternate pleading rule and the “admissions through pleadings” rule. Giannone v. U.
S. Steel Corp. 238 F.2d 544, 547 (C.A.3 1956). To preclude Newark from offering its
alternative theory would offend the very premise of of Rule 8(e)(2). As this Court aptly noted in
its April 5, 2006 Order: “whether the content of those letters actually fulfilled the City’s
obligations is a question for the factfinder.” (D.I. #132). The Court was referring to the
November 21, 2003 letter and another letter sent on February 3, but the February 4 letter deserves
similar treatment and should be offered to the jury to decide.
The purpose of the seven day notice requirement is to give the contractor an opportunity
to cure and avoid termination. Bruner and O’Connor on Construction Law, §12:41 (May 2004).
Durkin’s steadfast focus on the technical timing of the letters ignores the fact that Durkin did not,
would not, and still argues that the project was not constructable as designed. The jury must be

permitted to consider all the relevant facts, including the February 4 letter, in determining
whether Durkin was terminated properly and whether Newark was justified in doing so.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Defendant City of Newark respectfully requests that this Court deny
Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine Regarding the Judicial Admission of the City of Newark Providing
Prior Written Notice of Intent to Terminate the Contract.
