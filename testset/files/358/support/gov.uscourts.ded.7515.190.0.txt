PLAINITFF'S MOTION IN LIMINE
REGARDING THE JUDICIAL ADMISSION OF THE CITY OF NEWARK
PROVIDING PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE OF INTENT
TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT
1. Plaintiff and Third Party Defendant Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc.
("Durkin") filed an action against Defendant City of Newark and members of City
Council (collectively "the City") arising out of the City's improper termination of
Durkin's Contract for default.
2. ' Pursuant to Section 15.2.4 of the Contract, the City was required to
provide Durkin and its surety with seven (7) days written notice of its intention to
terminate Durkin for default.

3. Durkin files this Motion in Limine to preclude the City from arguing or

attempting to present any evidence that controverts their prior contentions in pleadings

KOP:346649v2 3514-04
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document190 Filed 08/22/2006 Page2of5

that the November 21, 2003 letter from Carl Luft to Durkin and Federal Insurance
Company represented the required seven day prior written notice to Durkin of the City's
intention to terminate the Contract. (November 21, 2003 letter, App. A3-A4).

4, Durkin believes that the City may attempt to introduce alternate writings
other than the November 21, 2003 letter as the required seven day prior written notice of
its intention to terminate the Durkin Contract.

5. From the commencement of this litigation, the City has maintained that
the letter of November 21, 2003 is when it "gave written notice of its intent to terminate
the Contract." (Answer, Counterclaim, 4119, App. A 25).

6. In its third party breach of contract claim, the City also admits that the
letter of November 21, 2003 was the prior written notice of intent to terminate. (Answer,
Third Party Claim, Breach of Contract, 49, App. A28).

7. Throughout the City's Answering Brief to Durkin's Motion for
Declaratory Judgment, it repeatedly pointed to the letter of November 21, 2003 as the
prior written notice of its intent to terminate the Contract. (Answering Brief to Motion for
Declaratory Judgment, p. 10, 18 and 19 n. 6, App. A83, A91, A92. See also p. 23 and 24 App.
A96, A97).

8. The City continued to maintain in its Answering Brief to Durkin's Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment that the letter of November 21, 2003 was the prior written
notice of its intent to terminate the Contract. (Answering Brief to Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment, pages 2 and 9, App. Ai18, A125).

9. The City also responded to Federal Insurance Company's Motion for

Summary Judgment, again maintaining that the letter of November 21, 2003 was the

KOP:346649v2 3514-04
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document190 _ Filed 08/22/2006 Page3of5

prior written notice of its intent to terminate the Contract. (Answering Brief to Federal's
Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 11, 14 and 15, App. A150, A153, A154).

10. These affirmative representations in the pleadings filed of record by the
City are judicial admissions that the City regarded the letter of November 21, 2003 as the
prior written notice of intention to terminate Durkin's Contract.

11. However, when the City's Rule 30(b)(6) designee, Carol Houck, was
deposed on March 22-23, 28 & 30, 2006, she testified that a letter dated February 3, 2004
`actually constituted the City's prior written seven day notice of intention to terminate
Durkin's Contract. (Houck Deposition 3/28/06, page 379, App. A10). (February 3, 2004 letter',
App. A5-A6). (Houck Errata Sheet, page 3, App. A13).

12. _ A judicial admission is a formal statement that is made by a party or its
attorney in the course of judicial proceedings which removes the admitted fact from
controversy. See Krauss v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 2004 Del. Super. LEXIS
127 (Del. Super. Ct., 2004).

13. `If factual matters in issue have been judicially admitted, they are binding
on the tendering party. See e.g. Parilla v. [AP Worldwide Services, VI, Inc., et al, 368 F. 3d
269 a Cir. 2004).

14. Anadmission ina pleading is a judicial admission which is binding on the
litigant. See e.g. Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Providence & Worcester Co., 540 F. Supp.

1210, 1220, n.2 (D. Del. 1982) (internal citations omitted).

 

' Interestingly, the February 3, 2004 correspondence indicates that the November 21, 2003 correspondence
satisfied the notice requirements under the Contract. (February 3, 2004 letter, App. A5-A6).

KOP:346649v2 3514-04
Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document190 _ Filed 08/22/2006 Page4of5

15. A litigant is also bound by admissions made in briefs filed with the Court.
See e.g. Phila, Reinsur. Corp. v. Employers Ins. Of Wausau, 61 Fed. Appx. 816 (3 Cir, 2003)
(Finding Defendant's statement in a Rely Brief to be a judicial admission.).

16. The City must be precluded at the time of trial from attempting to
introduce any document other than the November 21, 2003 letter as its purported seven
day prior written notice of intent to terminate the Contract.

17. Judicial estoppel prevents a party from advancing an argument that
contradicts a position that the party previously took and the court was persuaded to accept
as a basis for a ruling. See Lillis, et al, v. AT&T, et al., 869 A. 2d 871, 2005 Del. CH. LEXIS
130 (2005).

18. This Court relied on the City's position that the November 21, 2003 letter
constituted the requisite prior written notice of intent to terminate Durkin's Contract in
denying Federal's Motion: "It seems that Federal misapprehends the City's position,
which is (1) that the letter of November 21 satisfied its obligation under the terms of the
bond ..., as well as its obligation under the construction contract ..." (Court Opinion,
4/5/06, p. 4, App. A162).

19. Accordingly, the City cannot, under the doctrine of judicial estoppel,
change its factual and legal position to argue that a different document actually represents
the prior written notice of intent to terminate Durkin's Contract.

WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant Donald M. Durkin
Contracting, Inc. respectfully requests that this Court grant its Motion in Limine and
preclude the City from presenting evidence at trial that any document other than the
November 21, 2003 letter is alleged to be the seven day prior written notice from the City

of its intention to terminate Durkin's Contract.
