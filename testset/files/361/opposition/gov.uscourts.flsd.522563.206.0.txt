PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO CONTINUE THE
SCHEDULED HEARINGS FOR APRIL 3 AND APRIL 4, 2018 [Dkt No. 197]

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 206 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2018 Page 2 of 5

1.

On March 27, 2018, counsel for Defendant Francisco Morillo called Plaintiff’s

counsel asking if Plaintiff would consent to a motion (1) striking portions of the Brennan
Declaration; (2) excluding testimony of Vanessa Acosta Friedman at the April 4, 2018 hearing;
and (3) authorizing an expedited deposition of Ms. Friedman before the April 4, 2018 hearing.
Plaintiff’s counsel stated that Plaintiff would oppose such a motion.
2.

However, Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant Morillo by email that same day

that “we will not oppose such a deposition but you need to make arrangements and seek consent
from her counsel, Jennifer Altman.” Plaintiff’s response from March 27, 2018 is attached hereto
as Exhibit A.
3.

On March 28, 2018, Defendant Morillo filed a motion to “(a) strike the March 1,

2018 Declaration of private investigator John Brennan, which purports to include confidential
communications between Mr. Morillo and Ms. Friedman during the course of their marriage that
are protected from disclosure under the marital communications privilege, (b) exclude evidence of
Ms. Friedman’s testimony from trial, evidentiary hearings and all other proceedings in this case,
including without limitation, the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction or, in the
alternative, (c) authorize Defendant on an expedited basis to obtain the testimony of Ms. Friedman
on oral deposition prior to the hearing scheduled for April 4, 2018, so as to be able to move for the
specific exclusion of her testimony and related evidence.” (Dkt. No. 177 at 1-2.)
4.

To accommodate Defendant Morillo’s request, Plaintiff contacted Jennifer Altman,

Ms. Friedman’s counsel, who is out of the country on vacation with her family, and arranged for
a deposition of Ms. Friedman on April 3, 2018, the day before the scheduled Preliminary Injunction
hearing.

5.

Ms. Altman agreed to accommodate Defendant Morillo’s request and remains

prepared to make her client available in her offices for an oral deposition on April 3, 2018.
6.

One day later, on March 29, 2018, counsel for Defendant Morillo wrote to Plaintiff

,apparently retracting the request to compel Ms. Friedman’s deposition, and falsely representing
that Defendant Morillo’s motion “does not seek discovery.” Counsel also claimed, “I never asked
you to make ‘Vanessa Murillo’, Vanessa Acosta Friedman or anyone else ‘available for a prehearing deposition.’ This is simply not true.” The e-mail from Defendant Morillo’s counsel to
Plaintiff is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
7.

Plaintiff responded by pointing out the apparent incongruity between Defendant

Morillo’s motion and the e-mail from his counsel and clarifying for Defendant Morillo that “(1)
unless you withdraw your motion scheduled to be heard next Tuesday morning, we will respond
to it on Monday in accordance with the deadline set by the Court and appear in Court to address it
next Tuesday morning; and (2) the deposition of Ms. Friedman you have requested and now moved
to compel will also commence next Tuesday at 9:30 am at Pillsbury’s offices. We will alert all
parties of their right to appear and depose Ms. Friedman at that time.” Plaintiff’s e-mail to counsel
for Defendant Morillo is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
8.

Counsel for the Trafigura Defendants have since objected to the scheduling of an

oral deposition of Ms. Friedman because they not receive at least seven days’ notice in writing
pursuant to Local Rule 26.1(h).
9.

Plaintiff has sought to accommodate the barrage of requests from Defendants to the

extent possible. Defendant Morillo wanted to schedule a deposition within five days of his motion,
notwithstanding the holiday weekend in between. Plaintiff remains prepared to accommodate that
request.

10.

Now, however, Defendant Morillo wants to postpone both the deposition and the

hearing that just days ago he maintained needed to occur urgently. Plaintiff respectfully submits
that Defendant Morillo’s request both to adjourn Ms. Friedman’s now-scheduled deposition as
well as the April 3 conference ought to be denied.
11.

The Morillo Group Defendants also object to the April 4 hearing on the ground that

a list of witnesses at the hearing has not been provided. Such a list was provided to their counsel
on Friday, March 30, 2018. Plaintiff, in turn, requested that the Morillo Group Defendants provide
Plaintiff with a list of their witnesses and those Defendants refused.
12.

Finally, the Morillo Group Defendants assert that they have not had adequate time

to prepare for the hearing. This is patently false. This Court entered the original TRO on March
5, 2018 and service or notice of the action was made to many of these Defendants, including
Morillo, on March 8 and 9. Thus, Defendants have had ample opportunity to respond to the
primary issue before the Court on April 4, 2018, i.e., whether an order should be entered requiring
Defendants to preserve documents and assets.
