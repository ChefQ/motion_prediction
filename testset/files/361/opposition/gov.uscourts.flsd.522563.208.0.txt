DEFENDANT TRAFIGURA TRADING LLC’S OPPOSITION TO HELSINGE
DEFENDANTS’ “ALTERNATIVE” MOTION TO CONTINUE APRIL 4 HEARING

04718-35041/9949264.3

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 208 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2018 Page 2 of 5

Defendant Trafigura Trading LLC opposes the “Alternative” Motion of Defendants
Helsinge Inc., Helsinge Ltd., Helsinge Holdings, LLC, Daniel Lutz, Luis Liendo, Francisco
Morillo, Leonardo Baquero, and John Ryan (“Helsinge Defendants”) to continue the hearing
currently set for April 4, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. [ECF No. 197.]1
Simply stated: the April 4 hearing should go forward.
First, at that hearing, Trafigura Trading would appreciate being heard by the Court on the
current ex parte temporary restraining order. Trafigura Trading and its affiliated Defendants are
unfairly prejudiced by being the subject of such an overly broad and unnecessary order. As
Trafigura Trading explained in its March 26, 2018 filings, there is no evidence that this
“extraordinary and drastic remedy,” Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000), is
factually needed or legally appropriate. [ECF No. 160.] And Plaintiffs have all but refused to
meet and confer on a reasonable document preservation protocol. While Trafigura Trading
proposed a reasonable document preservation protocol on March 25, 2018, and has continuously
tried to meet and confer with Plaintiff on a document preservation stipulation, Plaintiff has
refused to respond to our document preservation proposal—in fact, Trafigura Trading has asked
five separate times over the past week, most recently on March 29, 2018, without any response
on that proposal from Plaintiff.2 Thus, the April 4 hearing should go forward and Trafigura
Trading’s proposed document preservation protocol should be entered then.

1

Trafigura Trading does not oppose the request by the Helsinge Defendants to join the
request for a status conference and schedule for determining whether Plaintiff has standing.
[ECF No. 193.] Trafigura Trading also does not oppose a continuance for the Helsinge
Defendants themselves, so long as Trafigura Trading’s proposed document preservation protocol
and its proposed schedule to assess Plaintiff’s standing issues are still entered on April 4.
2

Trafigura Trading spoke with Plaintiff on the phone twice this week: on March 26 by
itself and on March 30 with many other Defendants. Between these two calls, Trafigura Trading
and others explained to Plaintiff why the Court’s order was unduly burdensome, how the

Second, there should be no delay to the Court’s setting of an expedited process to
determine whether Plaintiff has standing. As Trafigura Trading, and other joining Defendants,
explained in its March 29, 2018 filings, this Court likely is without jurisdiction. [ECF No. 193.]
Resolving that issue should be first and foremost—before anything else proceeds and before
Plaintiff can burden the Court or the Defendants any further.
Third, Trafigura Trading, and likely many of the other Defendants, is prejudiced by the
current state of disorder enveloping this action caused by Plaintiff—with filings every day on
disparate topics. See Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 347 (2005) (discussing the
need to prevent “a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim to simply take up the time of a
number of other people, with the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the
settlement value, rather than a reasonably founded hope that the [discovery] process will reveal
relevant evidence.” (internal citations and quotations omitted)); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 558 (2007) (“when the allegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim
of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should be…exposed at the point of minimum
expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court” (internal quotations and citations
omitted)); see also Frank H. Easterbrook, Discovery As Abuse, 69 B.U.L. REV. 635, 636 (1989)
(describing discovery “as both a tool for uncovering facts essential to accurate adjudication and a
weapon capable of imposing large and unjustifiable costs on one's adversary”). The April 4
hearing is a perfect opportunity to discuss with the Court and all parties how to move forward
with this action in an orderly manner.

Trafigura Trading document preservation proposal was based on Plaintiff’s own complaint, and
Trafigura Trading sought comments from Plaintiff. On March 31, Plaintiff sent a “final” effort
to all Defendants—never responding to Trafigura Trading’s proposal—that actually is broader
than the Court’s order.

Accordingly, Trafigura Trading opposes the Helsinge Defendants’ “alternative” request
to continue the April 4 hearing, or anything else that would potentially delay the prompt
resolution of Trafigura Trading’s document preservation obligations or the review of Plaintiff’s
standing. We respectfully request that the Court keep the currently scheduled April 4 hearing and
at that time enter Trafigura Trading’s proposed document preservation protocol and a schedule
for reviewing Plaintiff’s standing.
