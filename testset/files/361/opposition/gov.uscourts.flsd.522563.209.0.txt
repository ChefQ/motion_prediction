PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR LIMITED
AND EXPEDITED DISCOVERY [DOCKET NO. 193]

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 209 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2018 Page 2 of 4

The Defendants have jointly made a motion requesting a status conference to be held on
April 4, 2018 at 9:30 a.m., the time currently scheduled for the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for
Preliminary Injunction, and asking the Court to stay all proceedings for two months while
Defendants engage in discovery and briefing on the status of Plaintiff Trust.
Plaintiff does not oppose a status conference if it is held after the long-scheduled hearing,
but Plaintiff opposes any delay in that hearing as well any stay of discovery on the merits of the
claims involving Defendants’ illegal conspiracy.
Defendants’ motion is completely silent as to what would happen to this Court’s
Temporary Restraining Order and Plaintiff’s request for a Preliminary Injunction if Defendants’
motion were granted. Presumably, they want the Court to free them of any restrictions preventing
them from destroying documents or dissipating assets while they pursue their two months of
discovery and motion practice.
The fundamental argument Defendants make in favor of their one-sided discovery is that
there are defects in the Trust and that such defects deprive this Court of subject matter jurisdiction.
That assertion is simply wrong. As is more fully set forth in Plaintiff’s Reply Brief in Support of
Plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, (Part IV), any alleged defects in the creation or
authority of the Trust do not implicate Article III standing. Here, the Amended Complaint clearly
alleges an actual injury so all Article III requirements are met. Thus, at most, Defendants raise an
issue of prudential standing or issues of capacity to sue which do not require any delay or reordering of the normal discovery process.

In any event, Defendants’ attacks on the Trust

Instrument are without merit. See Reply Brief, at Part IV.
Moreover, if there were alleged defects in the Trust Instrument, those can be addressed in
response to any motion to dismiss that Defendants may wish to make and, if relevant to the motion,

Defendants can have any necessary discovery then. There is no reason to delay the hearing on the
Preliminary Injunction or stay normal proceedings for two months.
CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that Defendants’ motion to
adjourn to April 4 and motion to stay proceedings should be denied.
