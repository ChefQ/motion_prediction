Defendants.

JOINT REQUEST FOR STATUS CONFERENCE ON APRIL 4, 2018 AND A
SCHEDULE FOR LIMITED AND EXPEDITED DISCOVERY, BRIEFING, AND
HEARING REGARDING PLAINTIFF’S STANDING

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 193 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/29/2018 Page 2 of 10

Trafigura Trading, LLC; BAC Florida Bank; Colonial Oil Industries, Inc., Colonial
Group, Inc., and Paul Rosado; Glencore Ltd., Glencore Energy UK Ltd., Gustavo Gabaldon, and
Sergio De La Vega; Lukoil Pan Americas LLC; and Vitol Energy (Bermuda) Ltd., Vitol Inc.,
and Antonio Maarraoui (“Joining Parties”) respectfully request that the Court set a status
conference in this matter for April 4, 2018 at 9:30 a.m.—when this Court already has scheduled
the parties to appear on Plaintiff PDVSA US Litigation Trust’s (“Plaintiff[’s]”) Ex Parte Motion
for a … Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 5].1
At that status conference, the Joining Parties seek: (1) a schedule for limited and
expedited discovery into whether Plaintiff has standing to bring the claims it asserts in this action;
(2) a schedule for briefing related to Plaintiff’s standing following the limited discovery; (3) a
date for a hearing at the Court’s earliest convenience after the close of discovery and briefing on
Plaintiff’s alleged standing, where the Court can receive testimony, evidence, and argument
regarding Plaintiff’s standing; and (4) a stay of the remainder of this action, including all answers,
motions, and other responses, until the issues with Plaintiff’s alleged standing are finally
resolved.2

1

In response to our request for Plaintiff to join in this request, it responded “[w]e do not
oppose a request for a status conference to be set for April 4, 2018 so long as it follows the
preliminary injunction hearing, long scheduled for that day. We would oppose any attempt to
avoid the preliminary injunction hearing. We oppose your proposal to delay this case and alter
the normal discovery procedures and priorities.” The other parties did not take a position by the
time this request was filed.
2

There are many other issues that some or all of the Joining Parties, and presumably the
other Defendants, likely will raise should Plaintiff establish standing, including lack of personal
jurisdiction, improper venue, insufficient service of process, failure to state a claim upon which
relief may be granted, premature merits discovery, the right to compel arbitration, and misuse of
Rule 45 subpoenas—all of which are preserved under the Federal Rules. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(g)(2) (“Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule
must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to
the party but omitted from its earlier motion.”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (allowing, “at any time,”

2

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 193 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/29/2018 Page 3 of 10

The Federal Rules unambiguously require that, “[i]f the court determines at any time that
it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3)
(emphasis added). “No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper role in our
system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual
cases or controversies.” Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997). Standing to sue, a doctrine
deeply rooted in the concept of a case or controversy, “limits the category of litigants empowered
to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek redress for a legal wrong.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,
136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing consists of
three elements. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). “The plaintiff must
have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the
defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” Spokeo, 136 S.
Ct. at 1547. “The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of
establishing these elements.” Id.; see also Mejia v. Uber Technologies, Inc., No. 17-cv-61617,
2018 WL 930924, at *2-3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 16, 2018) (dismissing sua sponte because plaintiff
failed to prove standing, which the Court considered a “threshold jurisdictional question”).
Because standing is a threshold issue, it is critical to resolve disputes over Plaintiff’s
alleged standing (both legal and factual) at the very outset of this litigation. See Steel Co. v.
Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95 (1998) (rejecting “hypothetical
jurisdiction”). It is especially important here because the existence of a case or controversy is in
doubt and Plaintiff’s lack of standing is separate from the underlying claims, with separate facts
and separate legal principles. In short, the Plaintiff is not PDVSA, but instead some ambiguous

parties to move, and the Court to consider, challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction). This
request is without prejudice to all other such claims and defenses that Defendants may assert.

3

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 193 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/29/2018 Page 4 of 10

structure described by Plaintiff as a “trust.” There are obvious questions to whether that
structure was validly constituted and has the capacity and authority to bring these claims. And,
there is no evidence that Plaintiff actually and legally acquired the right to assert PDVSA’s
claims. In fact, there is evidence already in the record undermining, and raising serious
questions with, Plaintiff’s standing. See ECF No. 161-1 (attaching a document titled “PDVSA
U.S. Litigation Trust Agreement” that appears legally invalid).
Where, as here, a defendant challenges the accuracy or existence of a plaintiff’s standing
(or if the Court has reason to question it), the Court may “inquire, by affidavits or otherwise, into
the facts.” Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 735 n.4 (1947) (distinguishing between a motion to
dismiss for failure to state a cause of action and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction); see
also 2 James William Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 12.30[3], at nn.8-9 (3d ed. 1997)
(collecting cases for the proposition that “[a]lso unlike a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the court need
not confine its evaluation to the face of the pleadings, but may review or accept any evidence,
such as affidavits, or it may hold an evidentiary hearing”); 11 James William Moore et al.,
Moore’s Federal Practice § 56.04[3][d][ii] (3d ed. 1997) (“If the parties dispute jurisdictional
facts, the court is not limited to a summary judgment-like record; it may hold a full evidentiary
hearing. Nor is the court restricted to determining whether there is a genuine dispute as to the
facts. The court must decide the jurisdictional dispute by weighing the evidence and finding the
facts.”); 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1350, at
160 (3d ed. 2004) (citing “a wide array of cases from the four corners of the federal judicial
system involving the district court’s broad discretion to consider relevant and competent
evidence” in jurisdiction disputes). As Judge Easterbrook stated: “When jurisdiction or venue
depends on contested facts—even facts closely linked to the merits of the claim—the district

4

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 193 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/29/2018 Page 5 of 10

judge is free to hold a hearing and resolve the dispute before allowing the case to proceed.”
Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 676-77 (7th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added); see
also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 352-53 (2011) (endorsing Judge
Easterbrook’s view). Thus, limited and expedited discovery, briefing, a hearing, and a final
decision about Plaintiff’s alleged standing is critical here in the first instance.3
Finally, since standing is a threshold issue, everything else should be stayed pending the
Court’s final resolution of its jurisdiction. That would include preserving all pleading and merits
issues, motions, and discovery until this Court’s jurisdiction is established. There is no prejudice
to Plaintiffs of such a necessary stay, as the Joining Parties have taken steps to preserve
documents and sought to meet and confer on a reasonable document preservation stipulation.
See ECF Nos. 155-160.
Therefore, the Joining Parties respectfully request that the Court order that:
1.

A status conference in this matter be set for April 4, 2018 at 9:30 a.m.

2.

Defendants may immediately conduct discovery (as detailed below)

regarding Plaintiff’s alleged standing.4
3.

Defendants may: (a) serve upon Plaintiff ten interrogatories under Rule 33,

with Plaintiff’s responses due within five days after being served, which do not count
toward any limits in merits discovery; (b) serve upon Plaintiff ten requests for production
or inspection under Rule 34, with Plaintiff’s responses due within five days after being
3

The Joining Parties expect that the standing issues likely will include issues about
foreign law. “In determining foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source,
including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules
of Evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1.
4

Since Plaintiff and affiliated non-parties possess any relevant information about
Plaintiff’s alleged standing, there is no need or basis for Plaintiff to conduct discovery on any
Defendant before standing is resolved.

5

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 193 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/29/2018 Page 6 of 10

served; and (c) take four depositions under Rule 30 or Rule 45, which do not count
toward any limits in merits discovery.
4.

Fact discovery into Plaintiff’s alleged standing would close on April 27,

5.

Plaintiff’s expert reports on its alleged standing, if any, must be served by

2018.

May 2, 2018.
6.

Defendants’ expert reports on Plaintiff’s alleged standing, if any, must be

served by May 7, 2018.
7.

Depositions of Plaintiff’s and Defendants’ experts, if any, must occur on

May 8 or May 9, 2018.
8.

Plaintiff’s opening briefs on its standing must be filed by May 20, 2018.

9.

Defendants’ responsive brief on Plaintiff’s standing must be filed by May

31, 2018.
10.

A hearing (where the Court can receive testimony and evidence on

Plaintiff’s alleged standing) be set at the Court’s earliest convenience after May 31, 2018.
11.

All other issues and discovery in this case, including all answers, motions,

and other responses, are preserved and stayed until the issues with Plaintiff’s alleged
standing are finally resolved.
