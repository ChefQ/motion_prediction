BRIEFING, AND HEARING REGARDING PLAINTIFF’S STANDING” [ECF NO. 193]
AND MOTION, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
TO CONTINUE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING1
Defendants Helsinge Inc., Helsinge Ltd., Helsinge Holdings, LLC, Daniel Lutz, Luis
Liendo, Francisco Morillo, Leonardo Baquero, and John Ryan (collectively, “Defendants”),
through this limited appearance, respectfully join in the “Joint Request for Status Conference on
April 4, 2018 and a Schedule For Limited and Expedited Discovery, Briefing, and Hearing
Regarding Plaintiff’s Standing” filed by other defendants2 (the “Joint Request”) [ECF No. 193].
While Defendants were unable to convey their intention to join the Joint Request in time for
filing, Defendants adopt the arguments and discussion raised therein subject to the reservation of

In filing this Motion, Defendants do not waive any objections, defenses or rights
available to them, including as to the sufficiency of service of process or lack of personal
jurisdiction and to arbitrate any of the claims asserted by the Plaintiff.

rights above.3
If the Court, however, denies the Joint Request or grants it, but does not stay the
Preliminary Injunction hearing, Defendants move the Court, in the alternative, for an order (i)
continuing the hearings on Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 5], currently
scheduled for April 4, 2018, and the April 3, 2018 Hearing on Motion [ECF No. 177] (1)
Assertion of the Marital Communications Privilege, (2) Motion to Strike Declaration, (3) Motion
to Exclude Testimony of Vanessa Acosta Friedman or, Alternatively, (4) Motion for Limited
Expedited Discovery for an additional two weeks; (ii) directing that, at the preliminary injunction
hearing, the issue of standing be heard and determined first before any other issue; and (iii)
allowing Defendants to obtain discovery from Plaintiff limited to the issue of standing in
advance of the hearing.4 In support of this request, Defendants state as follows:

3

Trafigura Trading, LLC does not oppose Defendants’ joinder. Trafigura Trading, LLC
opposes any request to delay a decision or a stipulation on Trafigura Trading, LLC’s document
preservation obligations. Trafigura Trading, LLC does not oppose a continuance if it only
applies to Defendants Helsinge Inc., Helsinge Ltd., Helsinge Holdings, LLC, Daniel Lutz, Luis
Liendo, Francisco Morillo, Leonardo Baquero, and John Ryan.
Lukoil Pan Americas LLC has no objection to Defendants’ joinder, but opposes the
alternative request to continue the preliminary injunction hearing.
Glencore Ltd., Glencore Energy UK Ltd., Gustavo Gabaldon, and Sergio de la Vega do
not oppose Defendants’ joinder, but do oppose (1) the alternative request for a continuance and
(2) a continuance of the April 4, 2018 status hearing should the Court determine that a
continuance of the preliminary injunction hearing is warranted.
4

Counsel for Plaintiff indicated that they would agree to a request to adjourn the hearing
now scheduled for April 4, 2018 on the condition that Defendants’ counsel (1) agree to the
continuation of the Court’s March 5, 2018 Temporary Restraining Order until the Court rules on
Plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, and (2) provide a declaration “(a) stating that
after an investigation, counsel represents that their clients have not destroyed, removed, or
altered any documents subject to the Court’s March 5 TRO subsequent to the issuance of that
TRO and that procedures have been put in place to insure there will be no destruction,
movement, or alteration of covered documents while the Court’s TRO is in place, (b) setting
forth any payments or movement of any assets made to, from, or on behalf of, any Morrillo

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 197 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/30/2018 Page 3 of 9

1.

Plaintiff filed its Complaint [ECF No. 1] on March 3, 2018, and its Amended

Complaint [ECF No. 12] on March 5, 2018—both were filed ex parte and under seal.
2.

On March 3, 2018, Plaintiff filed under seal an ex parte Motion for a Temporary

Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction and Delayed Service (the “Motion”) [ECF No. 5],
requesting several categories of relief, including (1) the seizure of Defendants’ electronic devices
and records from six locations in Miami with the aid of law enforcement, (2) an asset freeze, and
(3) and order to preserve records.
3.

On March 5, 2018, the Court partially granted Plaintiff’s Motion, issuing a limited

Order directing Defendants to preserve records relating to the lawsuit, but declining to order the
seizure of Defendants’ assets and electronic devices [ECF No. 9].
4.

On March 5, 2018, the Court set a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for March 19,

2018 [ECF No. 9].
5.

On March 14, 2018, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Extension of Time

to Respond to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction and reset the hearing for April 4,
2018 at 9:30 a.m.
6.

During the March 14, 2018 hearing, Plaintiff immediately sought to call “a couple

of witnesses”5 and referenced calling additional witnesses.
7.

Following the March 14, 2018 hearing, Plaintiff apparently proceeded to serve

subpoenas on approximately 60 parties, calling for the production of documents and testimony at
the preliminary injunction hearing.
8.

Plaintiff served these subpoenas in secret and without proper notice to the

Defendant since January 1, 2018; and (c) stating that no Morrillo Defendant, directly or
indirectly, asked, encouraged, or sought to have any person destroy, remove, or alter any
documents after learning of the existence of this litigation.”

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 197 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/30/2018 Page 4 of 9

Defendants under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 in an apparent attempt to circumvent the
Court’s order and applicable discovery procedures. These subpoenas appear to seek expedited
and early discovery without leave of the Court in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
26(d)(1).
9.

Having provided declarations of only two individuals in support of its Motion,

Plaintiff has apparently served—without proper notice to Defendants—subpoenas on at least
twenty-three (23) individuals or entities to testify at the hearing.
10.

Defendants have not received proper notice of Plaintiff’s prospective hearing

witnesses. Plaintiff expects to call multiple witnesses and has, as of March 29, 2018, provided to
Defendants the names of some, but not all, of the witnesses Plaintiff expects to call.6
11.

Defendants understand that Plaintiff intends to call as its primary witness Vanessa

Acosta Friedman, who is Defendant Francisco Morillo’s ex-wife and the subject of Mr. Morillo’s
Assertion of the Marital Communications Privilege, Motion to Strike Declaration, Motion to
Exclude Testimony or, Alternatively, Motion for Limited Expedited Discovery [ECF No. 177],
which was filed on March 28, 2018 and is scheduled for a hearing on April 3, 2018.
12.

Counsel for Plaintiff have allegedly conducted an “investigation for several

months involving undercover operations, visiting several countries, [and] surveilling residences
and businesses in several places”7 and now seek “emergency” relief based, in part, on the
Declaration of John Thackray executed on February 12, 2018—nearly three weeks before

6

Plaintiff represented it would provide Defendants with a list of all witnesses it intends to
call at the preliminary injunction hearing by the morning March 30, 2018. As of the time of this
filing, Defendants have not received such a list. Notwithstanding, Defendants object to Plaintiff
being allowed to call any witness other than the two witnesses for whom declarations were
submitted with Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 5] (Messrs. Brennan and
Thackray).

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 197 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/30/2018 Page 5 of 9

Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction.
13.

Plaintiff intends to file a 30-page reply brief on Monday, April 2, 2018—two days

before the scheduled hearing.
14.

As set forth in more detail in Defendants Helsinge, Inc. and John Ryan’s Motion

for an Order to Show Cause [ECF No. 191], Plaintiff has engaged in conduct that has had the
effect of depriving Defendant Helsinge, Inc. of the rightful possession and use of its computer
server and its contents.
15.

Plaintiff’s conduct has made it difficult for Defendants to effectively prepare for

the hearing and provide the Court with evidence relevant to its determination of Plaintiff’s
Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 5].
16.

As the Court noted, Plaintiff is seeking “extraordinary” relief typically reserved

for cases where a “[g]overnment agency is[] involved,”8 including the seizure of Defendants’
assets and private papers.
17.

As set forth in the Joint Request of the Joining Parties [ECF No. 193] and

Defendants’ Joint Response [ECF No. 161], there are significant questions regarding whether
Plaintiff has standing to file a lawsuit on behalf of Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”).
And, as also explained in the Joint Request of the Joining Parties [ECF No. 193] and Defendants’
Joint Response [ECF No. 161], standing is a threshold issue and without it the Court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, including to conduct a preliminary injunction hearing. And although
Defendants, in a short period of time, attempted to brief the issue of standing as fully as possible
in their Joint Response [ECF No. 161], Defendants would like additional time to investigate and
analyze the issue with the benefit of discovery from Plaintiff limited to the issue of standing.

Id. at 3:4-7.

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 197 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/30/2018 Page 6 of 9

Furthermore, receiving Plaintiff’s reply brief (and any attachments thereto, including expert
declarations) only two days before the preliminary injunction hearing will not provide
Defendants with a fair opportunity to oppose Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction as to
the issue of standing.
18.

In order for a court to issue a preliminary injunction, “the nonmoving party must

have notice and an opportunity to present its opposition to the injunction.” FED. R. CIV. P.
65(a)(1). The United States Supreme Court has stated that “[t]he notice required by Rule 65(a)
before a preliminary injunction can issue implies a hearing in which the defendant is given a fair
opportunity to oppose the application and to prepare for such opposition.” Granny Goose
Foods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Local No. 70 of Alameda Cty., 415 U.S.
423, 433 n.7 (1974) (emphases added).
19.

Accordingly, to the extent the Court does not grant the Joint Request or grants it,

but does not stay the April 4, 2018 preliminary injunction hearing, the Court should grant
Defendants’ request for an additional two weeks and for limited discovery, so that Defendants
can effectively prepare for the hearing.9 Additionally, the Court should order that, at the hearing,
the issue of standing be heard and determined first before any other issue.
20.

This request is made in good faith and will not prejudice Plaintiff (including given

that the Court already entered a TRO in which it ordered Defendants to preserve documents and
the Defendants are nonetheless obligated to do so), unreasonably delay the proceedings, or

9

The relief sought by this motion is in addition to, less restrictive, and in the alternative
to, the relief sought by defendants Helsinge, Inc. and John Ryan in their Motion for Order to
Show Cause [ECF No. 191] in which they seek, in part, that: (i) the April 4, 2018 preliminary
injunction hearing be postponed until such time as Helsinge, Inc. regains possession of its server
and has sufficient time for its counsel to examining the contents of the server in preparation for
the hearing; and (ii) the Court deny, without further hearing, Plaintiff’s request, in its preliminary
injunction motion, to seize and copy defendants’ documents.
6

Case 1:18-cv-20818-DPG Document 197 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/30/2018 Page 7 of 9

unreasonably delay resolution of the Motion.
WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant the Joint Request
[ECF No. 193] or, in the alternative, continue the hearings—currently scheduled for April 3,
2018 and April 4, 2018—for an additional two weeks to a date and time convenient for the
Court, grant Defendants leave to conduct limited discovery as to standing in advance of the
hearing, and order that, at the hearing, the issue of standing be heard and determined first before
any other issue.
