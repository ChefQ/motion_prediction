Case No. 1:08-cv-00317-RWR
Judge Richard W. Roberts

THE UNITED STATES ’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
INTRODUCTION
Defendants, Dirk Kempthorne in his official capacity as Secretary of the Interior
(“Secretary”) and the United States Department of the Interior (“Interior”) (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “Defendants”), hereby oppose the Motion for Preliminary
Injunction (“Motion”) filed February 25, 2008 (Docket #2) by the Board of Commissioners of
Cherokee County, Kansas (“Plaintiff”). Plaintiff claims it is entitled to an injunction because the
Defendants violated the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (“IGRA”), 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2721, and
the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-4370f, by transferring a
portion of the Meh-No-Bah Allotment into trust on behalf of the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma
(“Quapaw Tribe”) thereby allowing the construction of a casino resort without the proper
environmental review. Mot. at 1. The Motion requests that the Court enjoin the Secretary from
proceeding on any further land transfers on behalf of the Quapaw Tribe related to the

development of the casino, and that the Secretary and those acting in concert with him be
enjoined from conducting any further construction activity on the property and from operating
the casino. Mot. at 2.
Plaintiff’s Motion must be denied because the injunctive relief it seeks is unavailable.
Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants from engaging in the construction and operation of a casino,
something Defendants are simply not doing.1/ Defendants are not engaging in any ongoing
construction or development activity on the Meh-No-Bah Allotment; the Quapaw Tribe is the
entity doing so. However, the Quapaw Tribe is not before this Court, and therefore, the Court
lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the Tribe. Defendants also have no authority to regulate the
construction activities of the Tribe and, even if the United States had such authority and chose to
use it, construction of a casino is not unlawful.
Moreover, Plaintiff cannot show the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of either
of its two statutory claims. Any claims under IGRA are premature because no gaming has taken
place on the property. In addition, under the Quiet Title Act (“QTA”), 28 U.S.C. § 2409a, the
Court has no jurisdiction to hear claims seeking to divest the United States of title to the land it
holds in trust or restricted fee for the Quapaw Tribe, which is the relief Plaintiff ultimately seeks.
Compl. at 13. With respect to NEPA, any claim that the United States did not properly comply
with NEPA is necessarily tied to the major federal action that triggers NEPA, the transfer of the

Plaintiff also seeks to enjoin the United States from “proceeding with any further land
acquisitions related to the development” of a gaming facility on the property. Mot. at 2. The
Quapaw Tribe currently has one application pending to have land taken into trust under the
Indian Land Consolidation Act (“ILCA”), 25 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2221, § 2204. The Secretary of the
Interior has agreed not to take any additional land into trust on behalf of the Quapaw Tribe during
the pendency of the present litigation. Ex. 3, Decl. of Majel Russell. Therefore, injunctive relief
is unnecessary.

land into trust or restricted fee. Since the land transfer process is complete, Plaintiff’s NEPA
claims are moot. Therefore, Plaintiff also fails to show a likelihood of success on the merits of
its claims. For these reasons and the other reasons set forth below, Plaintiff’s Motion should be
denied.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s Motion centers around the construction and development of a casino/hotel
complex by the Quapaw Tribe in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma, where the State borders
Kansas and Missouri. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 3. The project consists of the construction of
the casino/hotel complex, infrastructure, and amenities on 85 acres of land in Oklahoma, surface
vehicle parking and a driveway on approximately 63 acres in Kansas, and an extension of the
driveway on approximately 30 acres in Missouri.2/ Ex. 1 at ¶ 2 (Exhibit 1(C) attached to
Plaintiff’s Memorandum). The land on which the gaming establishment will be located is, in its
entirety, a parcel of land in Oklahoma known as the Meh-No-Bah Allotment. Id. at ¶ 3. The
Quapaw Tribe acquired 5/6ths of the Meh-No-Bah Allotment in trust from its individual Indian
landowners through the Indian Land Consolidation Act (“ILCA”), 25 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2221; the
remaining 1/6th of the land, also acquired by the Tribe pursuant to ILCA, is held by the Tribe in
restricted fee.3/ Id. The Meh-No2/

All 63 acres in Kansas, where Plaintiff is located, are owned by the Tribe in fee simple. As
such, that parcel is subject to the State of Kansas’ jurisdiction.
3/

Notably, the individual parcels making up the Meh-No-Bah Allotment were allotted to members
of the Quapaw Tribe pursuant to an Act of the Quapaw National Council approved on March 23,
1893, and ratified and confirmed by the Act of March 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 876, 907. “‘Indian
Country’. . . means . . . (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been
extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.” 18 U.S.C. § 1151(c).
Although Congress enacted Section 1151 as a guide to federal criminal jurisdiction, the Supreme

Bah Allotment was acquired pursuant to five separate transactions. Exs. 2-6 (Exhibits . The first
two parcels each had a 1/4 undivided interest in the Allotment – for a total of a 1/2 undivided
interest – and were transferred from their individual Indian onwers into trust for the Tribe on
April 27, 2007. Exs. 2, 3. Two additional parcels were transferred from their individual Indian
owners into trust on May 18, 2007 and July 6, 2007, respectively, each with a 1/6 undivided
interest in the Meh-No-Bah Allotment, for a total of a 5/6 undivided interest in the Meh-No-Bah
Allotment. Exs. 4, 5. The final transaction, on July 10, 2007, involved the transfer of the parcel
with a 1/6 undivided interest in the Meh-No-Bah Allotment in restricted fee Indian land.4/ Ex. 6.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Courts addressing a motion for a preliminary injunction should examine four factors: (1)
whether there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits; (2) whether
the plaintiff will be irreparably injured if an injunction is not granted; (3) whether an injunction
will substantially injure the other party; and (4) whether granting the injunction would further the
public interest. Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citing
Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).

Court has applied this definition to questions of federal civil jurisdiction and tribal jurisdiction.
California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. 202, 208 (1987); DeCoteau v. Dist.
County Court for Tenth Judicial Dist., 420 U.S. 425, 427 n.2 (1975). Therefore, although the
Quapaw Tribe acquired possession of the allotments pursuant to ILCA in 2007, the individual
parcels have always been Indian land and Indian Country.
4/

The title of restricted fee land is held by the Indian tribe with specific federally-imposed
restrictions on its use and/or disposition. As the Supreme Court noted in Oklahoma Tax
Commission v. United States, “[t]he power of Congress over ‘trust’ and ‘restricted’ lands is the
same and in practice the terms have been used interchangeably.” Okla. Tax Comm’n v. United
States, 319 U.S. 598, 618-19 (1943) (citation omitted).

These factors are interrelated and must be balanced against each other. Id.
ARGUMENT
Plaintiff fails to make a sufficient showing on any of the elements required to justify a
preliminary injunction, and its motion should be denied.
A.

Plaintiff cannot show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.
1.

The United States is not the proper party to enjoin.

Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the Secretary, “and all those acting in concert with him,” from
performing any further construction on the property and from operating the casino “until the
Secretary has complied with . . . NEPA.” Mot. at 2. The Defendants are not engaging in any
construction on the property; the Quapaw Tribe is doing so. Therefore, if the Court were going
to enjoin construction activities on the Meh-No-Bah Allotment, it would have to enjoin the
Quapaw Tribe, not the United States. However, the Quapaw Tribe is not a party to this case and
cannot be joined by the Plaintiff because it has sovereign immunity from suit. Okla. Tax
Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla., 498 U.S. 505, 509 (1991) (“Indian
tribes are ‘domestic dependent nations’ that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their
members and territories. Suits against Indian tribes are thus barred by sovereign immunity absent
a clear waiver by the tribe or congressional abrogation.”) (citations omitted).
Although the United States does hold the Meh-No-Bah Allotment in trust and restricted
fee for the Quapaw Tribe, the Tribe is a domestic dependent nation with inherent sovereign
authority of its members and territories. As such, once the Meh-No-Bah Allotment was
transferred in trust and restricted fee, the United States has no role in regulating construction
activities on it, unless Congress establishes such a regulatory role. Plaintiff fails to identify
5

Case 1:08-cv-00317-RWR

Document 10

Filed 03/03/2008

Page 6 of 15

legislation providing the United States with such a regulatory role. The United States only has a
role in transferring the land, pursuant to ILCA, and in regulating the gaming operation through
IGRA. At this point, no gaming is being conducted and there is no federal law which provides
the United States with the authority to regulate a Tribe’s ability to engage in construction on its
land.
Moreover, the construction is not illegal and the United States has no authority to stop the
Quapaw Tribe, a quasi-sovereign entity, from engaging in lawful activity on its land. The fact
that the United States has set aside the Meh-No-Bah Allotment as trust and restricted fee Indian
lands on behalf of the Quapaw Tribe does not endow the United States with the authority to halt
the lawful activities of the Tribe on that land.5/ “In addition to broad authority over intramural
matters such as membership, tribes retain sovereign authority to regulate economic activity
within their own territory.” Nat’l Labor Relations Bd. v. Pueblo of San Juan, 276 F.3d 1186,
1192-93 (10th Cir. 2002) (citing Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 137 (1982);
Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 152-53
(1980)).
2.

The QTA bars Plaintiff’s NEPA claims.

Plaintiff also cannot show a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its claims
that the Secretary violated NEPA when acquiring the Meh-No-Bah Allotment. Plaintiff
challenges the Secretary’s decisions regarding the acquisition of the Meh-No-Bah Allotment,

5/

As stated earlier, the portion of the Tribe’s property that lies in Cherokee County, Kansas, where
Plaintiff is located – the site of the proposed parking lot – is owned by the Tribe in fee simple, so
the United States lacks any connection to that portion of the land. The State of Kansas regulates
that portion.

claiming that the Secretary violated NEPA in the acquisition process. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 17, 22, 23,
38, 43; Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 21-26, 28-34. Plaintiff is attempting to invalidate these land
acquisition transactions by asserting that the Secretary failed to comply with NEPA. Compl. at
11-13.
If Plaintiff were to prevail, the remedy in effect would nullify the Secretary’s decision to
acquire the allotment in trust or restricted fee for the Tribe. However, the QTA prohibits suits
challenging the United States’ title in trust or restricted fee Indian lands. See Neighbors for
Rational Dev., Inc. v. Norton, 379 F.3d 956, 961-62 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing United States v.
Mottaz, 476 U.S. 834, 843 (1986)). The QTA waives the United States’ sovereign immunity for
suits to adjudicate disputed title to lands, but explicitly states that the waiver does not apply to
trust or restricted Indian lands. 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(a). For a suit to be prohibited under the QTA,
a plaintiff need not explicitly characterize its action as one seeking to quiet title in Indian lands;
rather, the relevant factor is the nature of relief sought. See Neighbors, 379 F.3d at 961-62
(action seeking declaratory judgment that trust acquisition of Indian lands was null and void
barred by the QTA).6/ Therefore, Plaintiff’s characterization of its suit as one challenging,
pursuant to the APA, alleged violations of NEPA is immaterial, as is the fact that Plaintiff does
not claim any adverse ownership interest in the property. It is the impact of the relief sought that
dictates the applicability of the QTA. See Neighbors, 379 F.3d at 961-62; Metro. Water Dist. of
S. Cal. v. United States, 830 F.2d 139, 143 (9th Cir. 1987) (“Although MWD may not be seeking

A plaintiff cannot avoid the impact of the Quiet Title Act by characterizing his claim as falling
under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Bd.

v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 768 F.2d 1248, 1254-55 (11th Cir. 1985).

to quiet title to the land in itself, it seeks a determination of the boundaries of the Reservation.
The effect of a successful challenge would be to quiet title in others than the Tribe.”).
The Eleventh Circuit has considered precisely this question and held that the QTA
forecloses judicial review of the Secretary’s decision to take land into trust for Indians once that
land is in trust. See Florida v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 768 F.2d 1248, 1248-55 (11th Cir. 1985).
In Florida, the State filed a suit under the APA challenging the Secretary’s decision to take land
into trust for the Seminole Tribe. Id. at 1250. The State argued that the QTA did not bar its suit
because the suit was not a quiet title action: the State did not seek to quiet title to the land at
issue, nor did it assert any property interest in the land. The Eleventh Circuit rejected the
argument and held that the QTA barred the State’s claim:
Although technically the suit in the instant case is not one to quiet
title, we conclude that Congress’ decision to exempt Indian lands
from the waiver of sovereign immunity impliedly forbids the relief
sought here. . . . Here, the appellants seek an order divesting the
United States of its title to land held for the benefit of an Indian
tribe. . . . Congress chose to preclude an adverse claimant from
divesting the United States’ title to Indian lands held in trust. It
would be anomalous to allow others, whose interest might be less
than that of an adverse claimant, to divest the sovereign of title to
Indian trust lands. Hence we conclude that the APA waiver of
immunity is inapplicable in this instance.
Id. at 1254; see also Shawnee Trail Conservancy v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 222 F.3d 383, 386-88
(7th Cir. 2000) (holding that the QTA barred the plaintiffs from bringing an APA challenge to
the Forest Service’s decision to close certain lands covered by the alleged easements, even
though the plaintiffs sought only to challenge the closure of the lands and did not seek to quiet
title to the lands), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1074 (2001); Shivwits Band of Paiute Indians v. Utah,
185 F. Supp. 2d 1245, 1249-52 (D. Utah 2002) (holding that the QTA prohibited the plaintiffs

from challenging a trust acquisition), aff’d, 428 F.3d 966 (10th Cir. 2005).
Plaintiff cannot circumvent the terms of the QTA by crafting its allegations as APA
claims asserting a violation of administrative procedure, NEPA, or any other statute. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s attempt to invalidate these land transfers by claiming that the Secretary failed to
comply with NEPA is barred by the QTA.
3.

Plaintiff’s NEPA claims are moot.

Plaintiff also cannot show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits with respect to
its claim that the Secretary violated NEPA. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 17, 22, 23, 38, 43; Mem. in Supp. of
Mot. at 21-25, 28-34. With regard to any NEPA analysis that was performed before the lands
were transferred to the Tribe, Plaintiff’s NEPA claims are moot because the federal actions that
triggered NEPA compliance, the transactions through which the Meh-No-Bah Allotment was
acquired, have already been completed. “A claim that the defendants violated the NEPA is moot
when the action complained of has been completed and no effective relief is available.” Karst
Envtl. Educ. & Prot., Inc. v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 403 F. Supp. 2d 74, 82 (D.D.C. 2005)
(citing Fund for Animals v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 357 F. Supp. 2d 225, 230 (D.D.C.
2004)), aff’d, 475 F.3d 1291 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Here, the actions complained of – the transfer of
the Meh-No-Bah Allotment – have been completed and cannot be reversed. For the same reason,
no meaningful relief is available to Plaintiff:
[A]ny claim seeking to re-examine issues unique to the trust
acquisition is moot because the court is without authority to
provide any relief. “When events occur that prevent the . . . court
from granting any effective relief, an issue is moot.” Casad v.
United States Dep’t of Health & Human Servcs., 301 F.3d 1247,
1254 (10th Cir. 2002). Assuming for the sake of argument the
district court considered the merits of [Plaintiff’s] various claims
9

Case 1:08-cv-00317-RWR

Document 10

Page 10 of 15

and concluded the Secretary had not complied with the National
Environmental Policy Act or the trust acquisition regulations, the
district court could theoretically order the Secretary to now
consider the appropriate factors. The district court, however, has no
power to divest the United States of the property and [Plaintiff]
does not allege the Secretary has power to reconsider its decision.
Requiring the Secretary to re-examine its trust acquisition decision
would not provide [Plaintiff] with any meaningful relief and would
be a waste of agency resources – not to mention the judicial
resources that would be consumed in evaluating the sufficiency of
the Secretary’s initial considerations. Since the Secretary has
acquired title to the property, the issue is moot.
Neighbors, 379 F.3d at 965. Plaintiff’s contention that it would receive some kind of meaningful
relief if the Secretary were required to revisit the decision to transfer the undivided interests in
the Meh-No-Bah Allotment to the Tribe is false.
4.

Plaintiff’s IGRA claims are not ripe for review.

Plaintiff also characterizes the transfer of undivided interests as violating IGRA. Mem. in
Supp. of Mot. at 18-21. IGRA has nothing to do with land acquisition or transfer. Indeed, the
Secretary has no authority to acquire or transfer land pursuant to IGRA. Therefore, at the time
the Meh-No-Bah Allotment was transferred to the Quapaw Tribe, no IGRA review was necessary
because land acquisition and transfer does not implicate IGRA.
Furthermore, there has been and is no violation of IGRA because gaming is not occurring
on the property. IGRA prescribes rules governing the operation of gaming by Indian tribes. See
Citizens Exposing Truth About Casinos v. Kempthorne, 492 F.3d 460, 462 (D.C. Cir. 2007);
City of Roseville v. Norton, 348 F.3d 1020, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Together with 18 U.S.C. §
1166, IGRA creates a scheme of civil and criminal actions that may be used to prevent and
punish Indian gaming that does not conform to IGRA’s prescriptions. See United States v. Santa

10

Case 1:08-cv-00317-RWR

Page 11 of 15

Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians, 983 F. Supp. 1317, 1320 (C.D. Cal. 1997). When no
gaming has taken place, however, there can be no violation. The act of transferring land pursuant
to ILCA does not violate IGRA and the mere construction of a casino building or facility does
not violate IGRA.
For these reasons, Plaintiff’s contention that the Secretary has violated IGRA by
transferring the undivided interests in the Meh-No-Bah Allotment is misdirected and any IGRA
claims are unripe for review. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not shown a substantial likelihood of
prevailing on its claim of an IGRA violation by the Secretary.
5.

The Section 151 regulations are irrelevant.

The land acquisition provision of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 465, and its
regulations, 25 C.F.R. Part 151, are irrelevant. All of the parcels of land were acquired pursuant
to ILCA, not the IRA. As such, the IRA and its regulations do not apply.
Plaintiff’s first argument is that a statute must contain an exemption from the IRA and its
regulations. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 26. There is simply no legal support for the argument that
the IRA applies to all acquisitions unless the statute contains an exemption. There are numerous
statutes that provide the Secretary with the ability to acquire land into trust or restricted fee; the
IRA is simply one of those statutes, but it is not the only statute. For example, there are specific
settlement acts that provide distinct authority for the Secretary to acquire land. See, e.g. Pokagon
Restoration Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1300j-5. In this instance, ILCA provides the Secretary with the
specific authority to transfer existing Indian lands into trust or restricted fee.
Plaintiff next argues that Section 2202 of ILCA requires the application of the IRA and its
regulations to land transfers. The purpose of Section 2202 is to amend the IRA, 25 U.S.C. § 465,
11

Case 1:08-cv-00317-RWR

Document 10

Filed 03/03/2008

Page 12 of 15

to extend its provisions to all tribes, regardless of whether those tribes were organized under the
IRA. See H.R. Rep. 97-908, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4415, 4416 (1982). Prior to this amendment, it
was unclear whether tribes that chose not to organize under the IRA could use the IRA’s land
acquisition authority. In passing ILCA, Congress amended the IRA to clarify this issue.
Furthermore, Congress also provided that nothing in Section 2202 supercedes or amends any
specific acts regarding the acquisition of land for Indians in any specific tribe, reservation or
state. Id.
Plaintiff’s simply misapprehend the IRA and its application. The IRA does not apply to
trust-to-trust or restricted fee-to-trust land transfers under ILCA and, therefore, the IRA and its
regulations are irrelevant.
B.

Plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive relief because it has failed to show sufficient
harm.
Plaintiff improperly seeks extraordinary relief from this Court without demonstrating that

it will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction. Contrary to the requirement that a plaintiff
show that it will suffer an injury that is “both certain and great” and “of such imminence that
there is a ‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm,” Wisc. Gas Co.
v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985), Plaintiff suggests only irrelevant harms stemming
from lawful activity and speculative harms that might result from the denial of the requested
relief. For example, Plaintiff complains that the Tribe is using a County road “to bring heavy
equipment and materials onto the construction site.” Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 36. As described
above, however, the construction activity occurring on the property is entirely lawful, and
Plaintiff cannot claim any legitimate injury stemming from the Tribe’s lawful activity. All of the

12

Case 1:08-cv-00317-RWR

Document 10

Filed 03/03/2008

Page 13 of 15

other injuries Plaintiff cites involve traffic-related maintenance and public safety costs that would
not occur unless and until the casino becomes operational. The physical construction of the
casino resort may be largely complete, but IGRA imposes a variety of regulations and
requirements that must be complied with before Indian gaming may occur, see, e.g., 25 U.S.C. §§
2710, 2719, and the facility is by no means ready to open its doors. The harms Plaintiff identifies
from allowing the Tribe’s lawful construction activities to continue are not sufficiently great,
imminent, or irreparable to warrant the extreme remedy of an injunction.
Moreover, Plaintiff has delayed bringing this action until the resort is near completion.
Delay by a plaintiff in seeking injunctive relief is probative of a lack of irreparable hardship to
the plaintiff. In Lydo Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Las Vegas, 745 F.2d 1211, 1213-14 (9th Cir.
1984), the Court held that a delay in seeking a preliminary injunction is a factor to be considered
in weighing the propriety of relief. The court quoted from Gillette Company v. Ed Pinaud, Inc.,
178 F. Supp. 618, 622 (S.D.N.Y. 1959), stating that “[a] preliminary injunction is sought upon
the theory that there is an urgent need for speedy action to protect the plaintiff’s rights. By
sleeping on its rights a plaintiff demonstrates the lack of need for speedy action.” Lydo
Enterprises, 745 F.2d at 1213-14. In Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Company,
762 F.2d 1374 (9th Cir. 1985), the court again noted that a delay in seeking a preliminary
injunction “implies a lack of urgency, and irreparable harm.” Id. at 1377; see also Quince
Orchard Valley Citizens Ass’n v. Hodel, 872 F.2d 75, 80 (4th Cir. 1989) (delay in seeking
injunction indicates absence of irreparable harm and is a relevant factor to include in balance);
Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 276 (2d Cir. 1985) (plaintiff’s delay in seeking relief
indicates “reduced need for such drastic, speedy action” as an injunction); Scott-Blanton v.

Universal City Studios Prods. LLLP, 495 F. Supp. 2d 74, 80 (D.D.C. 2007) (delay in bringing
motion for injunction weighs against finding of irreparable harm). Here, Plaintiff had inquiry
notice of the construction activity and of the Quapaw Tribe’s anticipated use of the facility, but
waited until construction was largely complete to bring this lawsuit.
C.

An injunction would harm the United States and does not serve the public interest.
Because the United States has no statutory authority to regulate or halt lawful

construction activity engaged in by the Tribe, granting the injunction sought by Plaintiff would
place the United States in the untenable position of being held responsible for stopping lawful
activity over which it has no authority.7/ As a result, to order an injunction would harm both the
United States and the public interest. Accordingly, the third and fourth factors that a court
should consider when addressing a motion for a preliminary injunction mitigate in favor of
denying Plaintiff’s motion.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and particularly due to Plaintiff’s failure to meet its burden to
show likelihood of success on the merits, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s request for the
extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction.
Dated: March 3, 2008

Respectfully submitted,
RONALD J. TENPAS
Assistant Attorney General
United States Department of Justice

Furthermore, an injunction would cause financial harm to the Tribe, which has invested millions
of dollars in building a facility that is now approximately 80 percent complete.

Washington, DC 20240

The Honorable Pat Roberts
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 200510

DEC 0 21}07

Dear Senator Roberts:
Thank you for your letter of October 24, 2007, requesting our review of an October 18,
2007, letter from the Board of County Commissioners of Cherokee County, Kansas
(Board). In that letter, the Board asks several questions regarding tbe proposed
Downstream Casino and Hotel to be operated by the Quapaw Indian Tribe of Oklahoma
(Tribe).
ll~e proposed project will consist era casino/hotel complex, infrastructure ’and other
amenities on approximately g5 acres in Oklahoma, surface vehicle parking and an access
driveway on approximately 63 acres in Kansas, and an extension of the access driveway
on approximately 30 acres in Missouri.
The Board’s Hrst question is whether the land on which tim gaming estabt/sim~ent will be
located has been taken into trust fbr the Tribe. The gaming establishment will be located
on the Mah-No-Bah allotment. The land ha.,; been acquired in trust through the Indian
Land ConsoLidation Apt (ILCA), except for an undivided 1/6 interest which is the subject
of a trust application pending before the Eastern Oklahoma Regional Director of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (B[A) under 25 CFR Part 151.
The Board’s second question relates to the application of the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act (IGRA) to the parcel on which the gaming establishment will be located, along with
whether IGRA ’also impaeta the non-gaming parcels in Kansas and Missouri. The BIA
"has informed the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIG-C) that the gaming
establishment will be located within the former reservation of the Quapaw Tribe in
Oklahoma (copy enclosed). We are not aware of an NIGC opinion on whether the
gaming parcel in Oklahoma qualifies as "Indian lands" under IGRA, It is our position
that IGRA does not require the proposed parking lot in Kansas to be taken into trust as no
gaming activities will be conducted thereon.
The Board’s third question relates to compliance with the requiremenm of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The BIA did not complete either an environmental
assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) for this project because it
determined that one is not required for the ILCA acquisitions, tlowever, the BIA will
comply with NEPA requirements for the pending acquisition of the I/6 interest in the
Meh-No-Bah "allotment.

The Board’s last question is whether the Trib~ has enterexl into a managemeat contract
for this casino. Our understanding is that the Tribe intends to manage the gaming
establishment itself rather than retain a management company.
We hope that this letter addresses the Board’s conem-ns. Thank you for your interest in
this important issue.
Sincerely,

Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs
