MOTION TO DISMISS CHARGES AND
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT

Comes now, Defendant, by and through legal counsel, and moves for dismissal of
the pending criminal case. Such motion is based on the lack of authority for Forest
Service Officer Mandrake to effect a stop of Defendant Laney, detain him and issue a
Violation Notice/Misdemeanor citation while Defendant was operating his motor vehicle
on a US Highway, outside of a forest system road.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
l Officer Mandrake, Badge No. 2220, is an employee and law enforcement officer
with the United States Forest Service. Ex. 1, Violation Notice.
2. On January 11, 2015, at approximately 2:23 p.m., Defendant Alvin Brent Laney
was traveling on U.S. Highway 180.
3. Officer Mandrake was also traveling on U.S. Highway 180.
4, US Highway 180 is not a National Forest System Road pursuant to applicable

regulations.
5. Officer Mandrake attempted to stop Defendant Laney for allegedly for driving
recklessly and in excess of posted speed limits.
6. Because of the road design at the location of the attempted stop, Defendant
continued to operate his motor vehicle until a safe location/turnout was reached.
7. Defendant Laney pulled into a turnout based on Officer Mandrake's activation of
lights. The turnout where Defendant Laney stopped his motor vehicle was also occupied
by a local Deputy Sheriff Officer.
8, Officer Mandrake detained Defendant Laney alleging he drove recklessly on a
forest service road and evaded his arrest.
9. Defendant Laney had actually passed Officer Mandrake and a slower moving
vehicle in a passing area on US Highway 180.
10. Officer Mandrake requested the Deputy Sheriff sign off on the motor vehicle
citation, The Deputy refused to do so.
ll. Officer Mandrake issued a citation to Defendant Laney. Officer Mandrake's
citation indicates a violation of "36 CFR 2613A." Ex. |
ARGUMENT

I. THE CITATION IS FATALLY FLAWED WARRANTING DISMISSAL

Trial of a misdemeanor may proceed on an indictment, information, or complaint,
and trial of a "petty offense" may proceed "on a citation or violation notice." Fed.
R.Crim. Pro, 58(b)(1); See United States v. Dubiel, 367 F.Supp.2d 822, 823
(D.Md.2005). "For petty offenses . . . a violation notice is the functional equivalent of an
indictment or an information." United States v. Moore, 586 F.2d 1029, 1031 (4th

Cir.1978); United States v. Johnson, 131 F.Supp.2d 721, 723 (D.Md.2001). "[A]n
indictment is deemed constitutionally sufficient if it contains the essential elements of the
offense intended to be charged, sufficiently apprises the accused of what she must be
prepared to defend against, and enables the accused to plead an acquittal or conviction ...
as a bar to ... subsequent prosecution." United States v. Russell, 369 U.S, 749, 763
(1962); United States v. Lopez-Alvarez, 970 F.2d 583, 596 (9th Cir.1992); cf Dubiel, 367
F.Supp.2d at 825-27 (discussing indictments, information, and citation/violation notices
and holding that "the violation notice sufficiently apprised the defendant of the charges
brought against him such that he could make an informed decision in entering a plea."). If
an indictment fails to allege an essential element of the offense charged, and objection is
properly made prior to trial, then the indictment is considered fatally flawed and
dismissal is required, Omer, 395 F.3d at 1088.

Here, the Violation Notice issued to Defendant Laney on January 11, 2015, lists
36 C.F.R. 0x00A7 261.3(a) as the sole offense in question. Ex. 1. The Violation Notice lists the
date, time, and place of the offense, and gives a description of the offense consisting only
of "resisting any forest officer failure to stop." Jd. The Violation Notice is utterly bereft
of any statement establishing probable, or the alleged act(s) giving rise to the asserted
offense of "resisting any forest officer" charge. Likewise, the Violation Notice is bereft
of any description of the actions, events, conduct or other information as to how the
regulation was violated. Quite simply, the Violation Notice contains no statement of
probable cause nor has the government produced such.

The information contained in Notice of Violation and statement of probable cause
is sufficient if it lists the regulation that was allegedly violated and contains the elements

of the offense, provides an adequate description of how that regulation was violated,
enables a defendant to mount a defense, and would act as a bar to further prosecution. See

Russell, 369 U.S. at 763; and see United States v. Nolder, 2006 WL 1686513, at *3 (E.D.

Cal. June 19, 2006) aff'd, 231 F. App'x 554 (9th Cir. 2007); Lopez-Alvarez, 970 F.2d at

596; see also Dubiel, 367 F Supp.2d at 825-27.

In the present matter, the United States has failed to meet the minimum
requirements of notice and has violated Defendant Laney's Constitutional rights. Outside
of the reading at the arraignment, Defendant has received no information regarding the
underlying basis of the charge by which to defend himself. As such, the Notice of
Violation is fatally flawed and dismissal is required.

I. FOREST SERVICE OFFICERS ARE LIMITED IN THEIR AUTHORITY
TO MAKE ARRESTS AND ISSUE MOTOR VEHICLE
VIOLATIONS/CITATIONS.

Congress derives legislative authority to criminalize acts perpetrated in national
forests from the Federal Enclave Clause, Art. I, 0x00A7 8, cl. 17; the Property Clause, Art. IV, 0x00A7
3, cl. 2; and the Interstate Commerce Clause, Art. I, 0x00A7 8, cl. 3. United States v. Gadrion,
517 F.3d 839, 858 (6th Cir. 2008) (concurring opinion). Even if Congress has
Constitutional authority to exercise legislative jurisdiction, it may limit its jurisdiction
and that of the courts via specific statutes. Thus, the salient question in this case is to
what extent does a Forest Service officer have authority to make arrests and issue
citations in the pending instance,

The federal government, cither by the President pursuant to the Creative Act of
1891, 16 U.S.C. 0x00A7 471, 26 Stat. 1103, 0x00A7 24 (Mar. 3, 1891) (repealed Oct. 21, 1976), or the
Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the Weeks Act, 16 U.S.C. 0x00A7 521, 36 Stat. 963, 0x00A7 11

(Mar. 1, 1911) has designated certain federally owned lands as "national forests." In
providing for the designation of these national forests, Congress also prescribed the
division of state and federal jurisdiction:

The jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, over persons within national forests shall

not be affected or changed by reason of their [i.e., the national forests'] existence,

except so far as the punishment of offenses against the United States therein is
concerned; the intent and meaning of this provision being that the State wherein
any such national forest is situated shall not, by reason of the establishment
thereof, lose its jurisdiction, nor the inhabitants thereof their rights and privileges
as citizens, or be absolved from their duties as citizens of the State.
16 U.S.C. 0x00A7 480 (codifying the Organic Act, 30 Stat. 36, 0x00A7 1 (June 4, 1897) (captioned
"Civil and criminal jurisdiction."); reenacted under the Weeks Act, 36 Stat. 963, 0x00A7 12
(Mar. 1, 1911) (captioned "State jurisdiction not affected. Offenses against the United
States excepted.")). United States v. Gabrion, 517 F.3d 839, 852 (6th Cir. 2008). The
predecessor section for civil and criminal jurisdiction, which eventually became 16
U.S.C. 0x00A7 480, was drafted per the sentiment of the time, i.e. that a traditional federal
enclave was effectively "a state within a state," see Howard v. Comm'rs of Sinking Fund,
344 U.S. 624, 627, 73 S.Ct. 465, 97 L.Ed. 617 (1953), United States v. Gabrion, 517
F.3d 839, 852 (6th Cir. 2008)

While precedent suggests that 0x00A7 480 provides for concurrent federal and state
legislative jurisdiction over national forests, it does not generally provide law
enforcement authority to Forest Service Officers outside of the national forests. Section
480 has two distinct clauses:

The jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, over persons within national forests shall

not be affected or changed by reason of their existence, except so far as the

punishment of offenses against the United States therein is concerned;

The second clause of this provision is of relevance in the pending matter. "Tt has

long been established that the words `offense against the United States' encompass all
offenses against the laws of the United States, not just offenses directed at the United

States as target or victim." United States v. Gibson, 881 F.2d 318, 321 (6th Cir.1989)

(citing Radin v. United States, 189 F. 568, 571-72 (2d Cir.1911); Thomas v. United

States, 156 F. 897, 900-01 (8th Cir.1907)); accord Cotton v. United States, 52 U.S. 229,

231, 11 How. 229, 13 L.Ed. 675 (1850) (explaining that offenses against the United

States are those which are defined by congressional statute); United States v. Gill, 204

F.2d 740, 742 (7th Cir.1953) (reasoning that Congress, when enacting Title 18, meant

"crimes against the United States" to mean "offenses which Congress had defined and for

which Congress had fixed a penalty"); ef 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 3231 ("The district courts of the

United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all

offenses against the laws of the United States."); 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 547(1) ("each United States

attorney, within his district, shall-prosecute for all offenses against the United States");

U.S. Const., Art. II, 0x00A7 2, cl. 1 (the President has the "Power to grant Reprieves and

Pardons for Offenses against the United States").

Consequently, a review of the applicable jurisdiction of Forest Service Officers
shows that such officers only have jurisdiction over Forest Service lands and for
crimes/offenses against the United States. Officer Mandrake's issuance of a criminal
citation to Defendant falls well outside these jurisdictional parameters.

Il. FOREST SERVICE OFFICER MANDRAKE EFFECTED A STOP,
DETAINMENT AND ISSUANCE OF A VIOLATION NOTICE/
MISDEMEANOR CITATION OUTSIDE OF FOREST SERVICE
JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY.

Defendant Laney was peacefully operating his motor vehicle on US Highway 180
on January 11, 2015. While traveling on this county road, Defendant Laney approached

a slower moving vehicle and Officer Mandrake's vehicle, used his signal indicators, and
passed the vehicles in a passing zone identified by a dashed yellow line. Forest Officer
Mandrake observed this conduct, and sought to stop Defendant Laney for his conduct, to
whit, an allegedly driving in a reckless manner in excess of posted speed limits.

Because of the road conditions where Officer Mandrake sought to stop Defendant,
he continued to operate his vehicle until reaching a safe turnout approximately one mile
ahead. A Deputy Sheriff with the Catron County Sheriffs Office was parked at this same
turnout. Officer Mandrake issued a Violation Notice to Defendant, citing a violation of
"36 CFR 2631A." Officer Mandrake also requested that the Deputy Sheriff sign off on
the citation, The Sheriff declined to do so, however. Despite this, Officer Mandrake still
issued a violation to Defendant.

Forest Service Officers have limited authority for investigations, arrests and
issuance of citations. Thus, the United States must establish that the Forest service has
regulatory authority in a given situation, /.e. does the Forest Service or its employee have
jurisdiction to enforce its regulations and to initiate a traffic stop - in this instance on US
180 stemming from an alleged improper pass in the area Officer Mandrake alleges gives
rise to the subsequently cited violation. Put another way, did Officer Mandrake have
probable cause to effect a traffic stop of Defendant Laney on US 180 and the authority to
do so. Here, he did not.

When Office Mandrake allegedly observed Defendant Laney, the latter was on a
US Highway, not a forest system road. 36 C.F.R. 0x00A7 261.2 states in pertinent part:

National Forest System road. A forest road other than a road which has been

authorized by a legally documented right-of-way held by a State, county, or other

local public road authority.

36 CFR 261.2 (emphasis added).
While not accurately cited in the citation, it is likely that the alleged violation
issued by Officer Mandrake was intended to be 36 C.F.R. 261.3(a). This section provides
that:

The following are prohibited:

(a) Threatening, resisting, intimidating, or interfering with any forest officer

engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties in the

protection, improvement, or administration of the National Forest System is
prohibited.
36 C.F.R, 261.3(a), The purpose of 36 C.F.R. 0x00A7 261.3(a) is to "regulate the use of the
National Forests and to preserve them from destruction." United States v. Wilfong, 274
F.3d 1297, 1301 (9th Cir.2001).

Federal Courts have held that under 36 C.F.R. 0x00A7 261.3(a), "interference" means to
"oppose, intervene, hinder, or prevent." United States v. Willfong, 274 F.3d 1297, 1301
(2001). In order to establish a violation of 36 C.F.R. 0x00A7 261.3(a), the United States must
prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the Defendant did
interfere; (2) with a forest service officer; (3) engaged in the performance of his official
duties in the protection or administration of National Forest Land. United States v.
Parker, No. PO-12-4001-JPH, 2012 WL 3027941, at *4 (E.D. Wash. July 19, 2012)

For purposes of 36 C.F.R. 0x00A7 261,3(a), a forest officer is performing an `official
duty' when the officer is on duty and performing an act that contributes to the protection,
improvement, or administration of the National Forest." United States v. Willfong, 274
F.3d 1297, 1300 (9th Cir.2001) (citing United States v. Ryberg, 43 F.3d 1332, 1334 (9th
Cir.1995)). 2011 WL 837049 (E.D.Cal.), 3

Similar to how one does not have a right to resist arrest, "so long as [the officer] is

performing official duties in the administration of the Forest Service, 36 C.F.R. 0x00A7
261.3(a) prohibits anyone from interfering with those duties." Wilfong, 274 F.3d at 1300-
01. "The terms "threatening," "resisting," "intimidating," and "interfering" are listed
disjunctively "`so that proof of any one of the acts alone constitutes an offense." Bucher,
375 F.3d at 933; Wilfong, 274 F.3d at 1303; Hoff, 22 F.3d at 223. The Ninth Circuit
applies the "common meaning" of "interfere" for purposes of 0x00A7 261.3(a). See Wilfong,
274 F.3d at 1301. Accordingly, to "interfere" means to "oppose, intervene, hinder, or
prevent." /d. Physical force is not a required element of "interference" for purposes of 0x00A7
261.3(a). /d. at 1302. United States v. Nolder, No. CRF050094 AWI, 2006 WL 1686513,
at *3 (E.D. Cal. June 19, 2006) affd, 231 F. App'x 554 (9th Cir. 2007).

The argument is two-fold: (1) is US Highway 180 conveyed to the public for
"public road purposes" and is not subject to regulation by any other governmental entity;
and (2) even if the Forest Service has concurrent or other jurisdiction over the road to
enforce Forest Service regulations there is no showing that jurisdiction is appropriate for
the protection of Federal property under the facts of this case. See also United States v.
Parker, No. PO-12-4001-JPH, 2012 WL 3027941, at *5 (E.D. Wash. July 19, 2012)

Absent US Highway 180 being a "forest service road," Officer Mandrake had no
authority to effect a stop of Defendant Laney for an alleged improper pass. The
underlying basis of the Officer's stop is suspicious, at best, and per se unreasonable. As
an experienced forest service officer in the location where he stopped Defendant, Officer
Mandrake knew or should have known that he did not have authority to stop and detain
Defendant for the underlying motor vehicle operation violation.

The reasonableness of the law enforcement officer's need to detain an individual

for questioning must be balanced against the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.
Every individual has a constitutional right to be free from arbitrary or unreasonable stops

by law enforcement. See, e.g., United States v. Brigznoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 878, 95

S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). Officer Mandrake's stop of Defendant was just not

reasonable under the Circumstances.

CONCLUSION

The Notice of Violation issued to Defendant Laney by Officer Mandrake is fatally

flawed and the government's case must be dismissed. Alternatively, because Officer

Mandrake did not have authority or probably caused to effect a stop and detainment of

Defendant, this case must similarly be dismissed.
