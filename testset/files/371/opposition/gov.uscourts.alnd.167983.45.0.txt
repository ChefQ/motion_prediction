Amici certify that amici are not publicly held corporations, that amici do not
have parent corporations, and that no publicly held corporation owns ten percent or
more of amici’s stock.
INTERESTS OF AMICI
The Southern Poverty Law Center (“SPLC”) has provided pro bono civil
rights representation to low-income persons in the Southeast since 1971, with
particular focus on combating unlawful discrimination and ending poverty. The
SPLC provides educational materials, engages in policy reform, and develops
litigation to minimize the burdens placed on the poor, to reform industries that prey
on low-income communities, to ensure meaningful access to social safety nets, and
to enable upward mobility.
The Project on Predatory Student Lending represents students against the
predatory for-profit college industry and is part of the Legal Services Center of
Harvard Law School. The Project represents thousands of former students across
the country and litigates high-impact cases to establish and protect the rights of
student borrowers. Many of the Project’s clients are people of color, veterans, and
immigrants. Most are the first in their family to attend college. The Project’s work
supports broader goals of economic justice and racial equality. The Project’s direct
experience with student debt informs its views on the issue. The Project is counsel

of Private Postsecondary Schools v. DeVos, No. CV 17-999 (RDM), 2018 WL
5017749 (D.D.C. Oct. 16, 2018), two related cases that are of particular relevance
to the instant action.
Gillian Lange and Natasha Dover are individuals who graduated from
Virginia College. Each allege that the Plaintiffs misrepresented important details
about the educational programs offered and the job prospects after graduation, and
have struggled to find jobs in their field of study and pay back their loans. Each
opposes the preliminary injunction and Plaintiffs’ attempt to prevent them from
filing or pursuing claims against Plaintiffs. They wish to offer the Court their
perspective as students who regret attending Virginia College and accumulating
significant debt to do so.
In their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs requested an injunction
that freezes any claims by creditors—including current and former students of
Plaintiffs’ institutions—and allows them to continue to receive federal student aid
dollars despite being financially incapable of ongoing operation absent bankruptcylike protections. Compl. ¶ 40, ECF No. 1 and Emergency Mot. Appointment
Receiver and Entry TRO and Prelim. Inj. 15, ECF No. 2 (“Motion”). Plaintiffs
assert that such an injunction is in the best interest of students. However, amici
(organizations that work closely with and advocate on behalf of low-income
vii

students, and two students) believe that entry of the requested injunction will cause
additional and unnecessary harm to tens of thousands of current and former
students.

I.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs, Education Corporation of America (“ECA”) and the for-profit

schools it operates, have requested the unprecedented: immunity from the natural
consequences of their actions for the sole purpose of preserving their access to
federal funding. Although they cloak their request under the guise of protecting
students, their requested injunction would harm the very individuals they are
purporting to defend. The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ request because it would
harm these students and is therefore not in the public interest.
Plaintiffs’ request would harm students in at least three ways. First,
Plaintiffs’ proposed order would deny students an opportunity to vindicate their
legal rights against Plaintiffs. It would halt actions that students have already filed
against Plaintiffs (including state law claims for misrepresentations and unfair and
deceptive conduct), and would preclude students from asserting other viable,
meritorious claims.
Second, Plaintiffs’ proposed order would interfere with students’ right to
discharge their loans. Both the Higher Education Act (“HEA”) and Department of
Education regulations permit students to discharge their federal student loans when
they are unable to complete their course of study because their school closes.
Plaintiffs’ proposed order would limit students’ ability to obtain relief from their

1

loans that were borrowed on account of Plaintiffs’ misrepresentations about their
educational programs or about job prospects after graduation.
Finally, Plaintiffs’ requested injunction would likely compound Plaintiffs’
misconduct. Indeed, the requested order would incentivize Plaintiffs to
aggressively increase their enrollment, while simultaneously cutting their costs and
limiting their liability. It would encourage Plaintiffs to engage in the precise
behavior—such as making misrepresentations and utilizing other aggressive
recruiting tactics, including targeting individuals for enrollment on the basis of
their race—that underpin many of the claims that students already have against
Plaintiffs.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
To fully capture the scope of claims that students have against Plaintiffs (and

thus to fully explain how the proposed order would harm students), it is first
necessary to provide background on Plaintiffs’ history. Specifically, amici discuss
Plaintiffs’ abysmal performance on key indicators of quality and student outcomes,
and detail Plaintiffs’ exposure to claims for misrepresentation and racial
discrimination.
a. Plaintiffs’ Institutes Perform Abysmally on Key Indicators of
Quality and Student Outcomes
i.

Title IV Metrics

Plaintiff ECA owns and operates several for-profit colleges, including
2

Brightwood Career Institute, Brightwood College, Ecotech Institute, Golf
Academy of America, and Plaintiffs New England College of Business and
Virginia College. ECA recently announced the closure of 26 campuses.
The vast majority of Plaintiffs’ institutions are heavily funded by taxpayer
dollars distributed under Title IV programs.1 However, the Institutions are
noncompliant or close to noncompliance with the basic guardrails of the federal
student aid programs. For example, in order to maintain eligibility under such
programs under the 90/10 Revenue Percentage requirements, for-profit colleges,
such as the Institutions, may receive no more than 90 percent of their annual
revenue from Title IV programs.2 Plaintiffs’ Institutions are on the cusp of
violating this regulation,3 which imposes a very weak check on such programs.4
Second, the programs offered by the Plaintiffs’ Institutions must provide
educational programs that “lead to gainful employment in a recognized

1

Compl. ¶ 13, ECF No. 1.
20 U.S.C. § 1094(a)(24); 34 C.F.R § 668.14(b)(16)
3
For example, in the most recent year for which such information is available, several of
Plaintiffs’ Institutes were within five percentage points of violating this rule. As of Award Year
2015-2016, Virginia College’s 90/10 Revenue Percentage was 84.04%, Brightwood College
campuses ranged from 87.21% to 57.96%, Brightwood Career Institute campuses ranged from
85.46% to 78.03%. Proprietary School 90/10 Revenue Percentages, StudentAid.Ed.GovFederal
Student Aid, https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/proprietary (last visited Oct.

The purpose of this rule is to prevent federal taxpayers from artificially propping up lowquality schools.

occupation.”5 The principal measure of whether programs lead to gainful
employment is the ratio of debt to income that a program’s typical student has
upon leaving the program.6 The debt-to-discretionary income ratio is geared to
measure whether graduates’ earnings are sufficient to pay their loan payments after
covering their basic needs.7 In the most recent calculations for Virginia College,
only 3 of the 35 programs evaluated passed this metric.8 For Brightwood Career
Institute, only 4 of the 33 programs evaluated passed the Department’s debt-todiscretionary income metric.9 For Brightwood College, 125 programs were
evaluated, but only 23 passed this debt-to-discretionary income metric.10
On yet another Title IV program requirement, Plaintiffs’ Institutions are
subpar. The cohort default rate tracks the percentage of an institution’s borrowers
who enter repayment on federal student loans during a particular federal fiscal year
who default prior to the end of the third year of repayment.11 While the national
cohort default rate of all higher education institutions is 10.8 percent, and the
cohort default rate for for-profit colleges is 15.6 percent, Plaintiffs’ Institutions

drastically exceed such percentages.12 Specifically, in 2015, Brightwood Career
Institute’s rate ranged from 25.9 to 34.4 percent; Brightwood College’s rate ranged
from 14 to 34.2 percent; and Virginia College’s rate was 20.4 percent.13 The
Institutions maintain cohort default rates that are, in some cases, double the
national cohort default rate for all institutions of higher education, and many of
their campuses have cohort default rates triple the national rate. If an institution’s
cohort default rate is 30 percent or more for three consecutive years, or greater than
40 percent for one year, it is subject to lose eligibility for Title IV programs.14
ii. Denial of ACCET Accreditation
In 2016, the Department terminated the Accrediting Council for Independent
Colleges and Schools’ (“ACICS”) recognition as an accrediting agency for the
Department for its noncompliance of numerous regulatory criteria.15 ACICS had
been the regional accreditor for both Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical
Institute, two large for-profit colleges that have wreaked substantial havoc in the
lives of students and are widely recognized to have been sham operations. Almost
all of the Plaintiffs’ Institutions are accredited by ACICS, and thus risk losing their

ability to participate in Title IV programs unless they secure accreditation from a
different agency.16
It is not clear that the Institutions will be able to demonstrate that they
should be accredited. Virginia College, for instance, was denied accreditation by
the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education Training (“ACCET”) on May 1,
2018.17 ACCET affirmed its denial on August 31, 2018, “based on the institution’s
violation of nineteen standards.”18 ACCET identified 232 weaknesses throughout
the 33 campuses, and found that 31 of the 33 campuses did not “meet the required
completion and job placement benchmark as detailed” in their standards,19 and
further that the institutions failed to “demonstrate positive students outcomes to
validate the vast majority of its training programs at the vast majority of
campuses.”20

16

On April 3, 2018, the Secretary of the Department of Education recognized ACICIS as a
viable accreditor pending a final decision from the Secretary. In the matter of Accrediting

the Department granted ACICS more time to demonstrate that it is fit to accredit institutions. In

For example, several campuses published information in their campus
catalogs that was different than information the institutions provided to the
Department, including the length of programs and the required credit hours.21 And,
ACCET found that at the Biloxi campus students were not provided hands-on
training in their clinical lab skills training courses; they were only learning
terminology rather than actually using and practicing skills with lab equipment.22
Indeed, Network Support Technician students had no appropriate equipment with
which to complete their assignments.23
The same pattern emerged at the Knoxville campus. There, the Medical
Assistant Program Director indicated during interviews that the National
Healthcareer Association Medical Assistant Certification passage rate was 69
percent for 2017.24 Yet, the Academic Dean provided a PowerPoint to ACCET that
indicated an 80 percent passage rate for 2017, thereby making the truth of their
passage rate unclear.25
Due to its poor performance on student outcomes Virginia College was also
placed on a Show Cause Directive by its current accreditor, ACICS.26

b. Misrepresentations and Unfair and Deceptive Conduct
The deficiencies identified above point to the existence of a variety of state
law claims that current and recent students of the Institutions may have. These
deficiencies, and related misconduct, are not new. Students have raised specific
claims against Plaintiffs that demonstrate this, and illustrate the type of liability that
Plaintiffs are facing from current and former students.
i.

False Claims Act Cases

Plaintiffs’ Institutions have been subject to multiple actions alleging
violations of the False Claims Act,27 in relation to falsely stating that the
Institutions complied with certain Department requirements when they, in fact, did
not.
For example, in United States of America ex rel. Sailes v. Education
Corporation of America, Relators—former employees of Virginia College—
alleged that the company compensated admissions employees through a system
that violated Title IV’s incentive compensation ban.28 Relators brought a joint

2018), available at http://www.acics.org/uploadedFiles/Actions/00010582_VirginiaCollSCC.pdf.

31 U.S.C. § 3729, et seq.; A separate Relator made substantially similar allegations in this
Court. See U.S. ex rel. Megan Gilbert v. Virginia College, 2:15-cv-336-AKK (M.D. Mar. 29,
2018).

action against ECA and Virginia College for making “false, misrepresented, and/or
improper certifications of eligibility to the Department of Education for
participation in its Title IV, HEA Programs.”29 Relators were compensated based
on the number of students the associate enrolled,30 and when the students they
enrolled graduated, they received “graduating bonuses.”31 In addition, Relators
alleged that ECA and Virginia College employed “dialers” or “qualifiers” from a
business called Education Connect to solicit students from job placement websites,
who were also compensated according to the amount of students they enrolled.32
Additionally, one Relator alleged that while employed as a Financial Planner at
Virginia College, he and other financial planners solicited students to participate in
a “cash payment plan”; they told students the plan would help them repay the
interest on their unsubsidized student loans,33 but in fact the Relator was told that
the money was used by Virginia College to meet their 90/10 Revenue Percentage
requirements.34 Ultimately, Relators stipulated to a dismissal of their claims with
prejudice.35

Similarly, in United States ex rel. Smith v. Virginia College, two former
instructors of the school alleged that the school had various methods to
fraudulently secure and keep Title IV monies.36 Relators alleged that Plaintiffs
would falsify and manipulate students’ attendance records to keep Title IV monies
that should have been returned to the Department.37 Students who stopped
attending class should have been withdrawn, allowing for some, if not all, of their
Title IV benefits to return to the Department.38 But because Plaintiffs retained
absent students on class rosters and even affirmatively re-entered students into
classes to collect Title IV funds, those students were left with federal student loan
debt they should not have had.39 The Relators in this case described being coaxed
to pass students even if they were failing their courses or unable to adequately
complete their work.40 Instructors were pressured to mark absent students
present.41 Instructors would also find students’ grades changed from failing to
passing without their input or consent, and were told to “do whatever it took to

stipulated to a dismissal of their claims with prejudice and pursued a settlement.43
ii.

Plaintiffs’ Exposure for Racially Discriminatory Targeting

Plaintiffs have also been sued for engaging in racially discriminatory
targeting. In Anderson v. Virginia College, eleven former students brought a
“reverse redlining” case against Virginia College, LLC, Education Corporation of
America, and Education Corporation of America, Inc.44 The students alleged that
they were targeted because of their race and sex “to take out loans on the basis of
deception

and

otherwise

unfair

practices,”

which

“constitutes

‘reverse

redlining.’”45 The students argued that the loans they entered into for their
education were unfair and predatory because they were induced to enroll by the
institution’s “misrepresentations about the educational quality and career
advancement opportunities provided by the school,”46 in violation of the Equal

arbitration and entered into a settlement with the students.48
To support their discrimination claim, students provided information
regarding the institution’s marketing tactics toward African-American audiences
such as “primarily us[ing] African-American models, purchasing advertising time
during daytime programing and late night programming, employing mostly
African-Americans as admissions officers, and advertising in mostly AfricanAmerican neighborhoods.”49 The schools also advertised in media outlets that were
popularly read by African-Americans, at Jackson State University’s stadium, a
historically Black university in Mississippi, and on city buses that predominately
served African-Americans.50 The students also compared the demographics of
Virginia College to a nearby community college.

Virginia College’s students were people of color.53 As of Fall 2016, Brightwood
Career Institute’s student population was 66 percent people of color, while
Brightwood College’s student population was 76 percent people of color.54 These
rates far surpass the proportion of the overall population of the United States that is
non-white (less than half).55 Other students of color likely have similar claims that
the Plaintiffs’ Institutions targeted them for a substandard loan product.56

Students Who Have Not Yet Filed Suit Also Have Claims Against
Plaintiffs for Misrepresentations or Unfair or Deceptive Conduct

In just the short period of time since Plaintiffs filed this litigation, Amici
organizations have learned of several students who may have viable claims against
Plaintiffs’ schools, and whose experiences exemplify the types of claims other
students may have, and who believe current students would be better off without
continuing their education at Plaintiffs’ Institutions. For example, Amici Gillian
Lange graduated from Virginia College - Austin with a 3.9 GPA in the Diagnostic
Medical Sonography program, but has been unable to find a job in her chosen field

of study. Ms. Lange believes that the school targeted single mothers and people of
color. She was told by admissions representatives and instructors that her program
was accredited and that all of her credits were transferable. She later learned that
this was not true. During clinical rotations for her program, many hospitals
informed her and other students that they would not be hired because the school
was not fully accredited. After graduating, she was forced to take jobs in fast food
and customer service that did not pay enough to cover her basic necessities.
She regrets attending Virginia College. The experience has created a huge
burden for her and her child because Ms. Lange took out over $30,000 in federal
and private student loans to attend the program. She is currently in default and, for
the past several years, the government has seized her tax returns to cover the
unpaid student loans.
Amici Natasha Dover graduated from Virginia College - Chattanooga in
2017 with a degree in Medical Billing and Coding. The school’s admissions
representatives used aggressive tactics to induce her to quickly enroll in the
program; they misrepresented the quality of the program, the cost of the program,
and the school’s job placement capacity. Like Ms. Lange, Ms. Dover only learned
after she enrolled that her credits would not transfer to another institution. Despite
her best efforts to obtain employment in the field, employers have told Ms. Dover
that her education and clinical experience are insufficient. She has been unable to
14

find a job in her chosen field of study and currently works as a customer service
representative. To attend this program—one that provided her with no value—Ms.
Dover borrowed $16,000 in federal student loans that she has since placed in
forbearance.
III.

REGULATORY BACKGROUND
In order to understand the harm that Plaintiffs’ requested order would cause

students, it is also necessary to provide a brief background on the relevant
regulations and recent developments regarding this governing law.
a. Plaintiffs Filed this Suit Following Significant Regulatory Changes
Providing Students with the Opportunity to Vindicate their Rights in
Court
Plaintiffs fail to mention that they initiated this action and sought protection
from the Court in the immediate aftermath of a ruling that makes ECA and its
schools answerable in court to groups of students who have been injured by its
illegal conduct. In Bauer v. DeVos, the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia considered the legality of the Department’s delay of a 2016 regulation
that prevented schools like those operated by ECA from forcing students to give up
rights to seek collective redress in a court of law by compelling them to raise all
disputes in individual arbitration.57 On September 12, 2018, the Court ruled that

57

Bauer v. DeVos, No. 17-cv-1330, 2018 WL 4483783 at *1 (D.D.C. Sept. 17, 2018) (“Bauer
II”); Bauer I, 325 F. Supp. 3d at 79, 110 (“Bauer I”).

15

the Department had violated the APA; the Court’s remedy rendered the regulation
effective as of noon October 16, 2018, at which time the Court denied a motion for
a preliminary injunction of the regulation in a related case brought by a trade
association of for-profit colleges.58 Days later, Plaintiffs filed this suit and
requested injunctive relief that would insulate them from the litigation that the
regulations would now allow.
The newly effective rule conditions participation in Title IV programs on an
institution’s nonreliance on pre-dispute arbitration agreements with students, and
thus gives “students access to consistent, clear, fair, and transparent access to seek
debt relief [and] protect taxpayers by requiring that financially risky institutions are
prepared to take responsibility for losses to the government for discharges of and
repayments for Federal student loans.”59 Because students may ultimately raise
school misconduct as a defense to repayment of their federal student loans,
allowing students to bring lawsuits against schools directly (including through
class actions) protects taxpayers by making schools directly liable. The record of
the rulemaking that led to the adoption of the 2016 regulation includes evidence
that for-profit colleges include in enrollment agreements arbitration provisions
couched with confidentially clauses and class action waivers which not only

disallow students their day in court, but further shield for-profit colleges by
suppressing information about a school’s illegal conduct that might ward off future
students from enrolling, and/or alert regulators to unlawful conduct.60 Litigation,
brought by an individual or on behalf of a class, allows for publicity that puts
students on notice and harnesses the attention of enforcement agencies.61 Such
litigation also serves as a deterrent on these institutions.62 Furthermore, the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”)63 conducted a comprehensive
study investigating the effects of arbitration agreements on consumers; in its
preliminary determination it concluded that the elimination of such agreements
would aid consumers and is in the public interest.64
In this litigation, Plaintiffs provided a list of civil complaints and arbitration
proceedings against it; 49 of the 107 legal actions were brought by students.65 A
majority, or 36 of 49, of the actions include allegations that are of the kind that,
under the 2016 regulation, cannot be compelled to arbitration by a school that

enrichment, breach of duty, breach of contract, fraud, deceit, and false
advertising.67
b. Remedies for Students After School Closure
The HEA and Department regulations afford students the option to discharge
their federal student loans when they are unable to complete their course of study
because their school closes.68 However, if a student participates in a “teach-out,”69
or transfers academic hours or credit from the closed school, they are not eligible
for discharge.70 Teach-outs, however, often offer similar, if not worse, education as
the closed school provided.71 The Department has recognized that a decline in
quality often precedes a school’s official closure date, and that “it is not always in
the individual borrower’s best interest to continue a program through graduation.

In a closed school situation, the value of the degree the borrower obtains may be
degraded, depending on the reasons for the school closure.”72
When students are faced with the choice between discharge and a teach-out,
students may choose to receive a discharge because their previous school failed to
provide them with the requisite education; therefore, even if they were to continue
in a teach-out program their education is so lacking they may not have the skills or
knowledge to perform in their chosen field.73 Based on their experience with the
closed school, some students become understandably demoralized, and would
rather discontinue their education and eliminate their debt entirely.74 Others may
learn about the poor reputation of the teach-out school and prefer not to further
their education there or they may find alternatives at community colleges or other
institutions.75 Closed school discharges provide students with an option to alleviate
their debt after their school closes without forcing them to pursue an education
through a teach-out that may exacerbate their harm.
IV.

PLAINTIFFS’ REQUESTED RELIEF WOULD HARM STUDENTS
AND IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
Plaintiffs carry a heavy burden to show that their requested (and

unprecedented) preliminary injunction is in the public interest. A movant for a

preliminary injunction must show that irreparable harm is likely absent an
injunction, although such harm may be outweighed by the dangers to the public
interest.76 In this case, Plaintiffs themselves have recognized that there is a strong
public interest in protecting students.77 However, Plaintiffs’ conclusory claim that
they are seeking to protect students is nothing more than a façade to cover their
true intent: maintain Title IV funding and sell the institutions to the highest
bidder.78 As exhibited by their past conduct and the harms that their requested
injunction would now cause, Plaintiffs’ main concern has never been, and is not
now, protecting their students.
First, Plaintiffs’ requested relief is not in the public interest because it will
deny students the opportunity to vindicate their legal rights against Plaintiffs. As
76

Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365 374-376, 378 (2008) (finding the public
interest outweighed the injury to movant of preliminary injunction).

78
Although Plaintiffs claim to take actions to avoid disruption to students and safeguard their
rights to utilize Title IV funding, Plaintiffs’ papers show that such concern gives way to their
ultimate goal of maximizing profits for ECA’s shareholders. See, e.g., Emergency Mot. For TRO
8, ECF No. 2 (“[T]he only way in which they can preserve the ability of the Go-Forward Schools
to serve their students and the Teach-Out Schools to fulfill their regulatory requirements to teach
out the students, while also permitting Plaintiff’s directors and officers to maximize the value of
the ECA enterprise for the benefit of ECA’s stakeholders”); Compl. ¶ 27, ECF No. 1 (“Plaintiffs
need to prevent a rush to judgment and enforcement of claims and remedies against Plaintiff and
its assets, in order that the Receiver may run a marketing process to sell the financially viable
Go-Forward Schools for maximum value while ensuring that the students in the Teach-Out
Schools have an opportunity to complete their programs.”); Compl. ¶ 30, ECF No. 1. (“Plaintiffs
have limited options available but to seek the orderly restructuring of their operations and debts
through a federal receivership, which is the only way in which they can preserve the ability of
the Go-Forward Schools to serve their students and the Teach-Out Schools to fulfill their
regulatory requirements to teach out the students, while also permitting Plaintiff’s directors and
officers to maximize the value of the ECA enterprise for the benefit or ECA’s stakeholders”).

20

previously detailed,79 in order to receive Title IV funding, Plaintiffs may no longer
invoke their pre-dispute arbitration clauses to deny students the opportunity to
pursue their claims in court—including those with currently pending claims
identified by the Plaintiffs. Although these students have already started pursuing
their claims, the requested injunction would immediately prevent students from refiling them or proceeding with any filed litigation.80
Moreover, students have meritorious claims against Plaintiffs—including
those that are ripe for collective redress—that they have not yet filed. As detailed
above, students have potential claims under state law for Plaintiffs’ numerous
misrepresentations (including those related to their accreditation status and to the
nature and quality of the education),81 potential claims under the False Claims
Act,82 and potential claims under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act for Plaintiffs’
racially discriminatory targeting practices.83 As to the potential misrepresentation
claims alone, almost 100 students have asserted borrower defense claims to the

Department, alleging that Plaintiff ECA lied to them in order to secure their federal
loan dollars.84 Plaintiffs’ requested injunction would prevent students from
individually and collectively vindicating viable claims stemming from Plaintiffs’
misconduct. Such an order would shut the courtroom door on students at the very
moment that they were given permission to enter. The requested injunction would
allow Plaintiffs to escape accountability for (among other claims) breach of duty,
breach of contract, fraud, deceit, unjust enrichment, and false advertising. Given
that Plaintiffs’ proposal would deny students their right to seek legal redress,
Plaintiffs have failed to show how their requested order could plausibly be in the
public interest.
Second, Plaintiffs’ requested injunction would interfere with students’ right
to discharge their loans, and is therefore not in the public interest. The Court’s
approval of the injunction would eliminate students’ agency to choose their own
path; students would not have the option of seeking redress from the institution or
obtaining a discharge, and would be stuck in debt while attending a failing
institution. Indeed, the Receivership is a bankruptcy in disguise. It would allow
Plaintiffs to circumvent the HEA, which disallows institutions that file for
bankruptcy to be eligible for Title IV funds as such schools would no longer be

eligible institutions of higher education.85 Amici’s experience suggests that students
from Plaintiffs’ Institutions would be better served if Plaintiffs experienced the
natural consequences of their own actions and the schools closed.86 Only then
would students be able to choose between: 1. discharging their loans entirely, or, 2.
continuing their education at a different institution.87 To allow Plaintiffs’
injunction would continue the abuse already perpetrated by Plaintiffs’ Institutions
and trap the students in failing schools.88
Finally, Plaintiffs’ requested injunction would compound Plaintiffs’
misconduct; it would incentivize the precise behaviors that underpin the claims that
students already have against Plaintiffs. By financial necessity, a school in peril,
such as Plaintiffs’, will opt to take an aggressive approach to recruiting. Indeed,
Plaintiffs have already admitted to the Court that they rely heavily on Title IV
student tuition funds to operate their institutions,89 and that their current financial
difficulties are largely the result of plummeting enrollment.90 This perhaps explains

why, for the current fiscal year, Plaintiffs have budgeted $61,087,276 for
advertising and only $26,052,536 on “Instructional” spending. 91 If the Court were
to appoint the requested receiver and grant the requested injunction, Plaintiffs
would have one mechanism to increase their income: enroll more students to
increase revenue.
In addition to increasing enrollment through aggressive marketing and
recruiting, Plaintiffs have already started cutting costs and will likely continue to
do so.92 Investigations into the industry tell us exactly where these cuts will come
from: costs related to the delivery of education, and for career assistance services.93
Thus, at the same time that the school would be seeking to increase the number of
students attending, it would be decreasing its focus on educational quality.
Ultimately, Plaintiffs have provided no reason to believe that they would
change their behavior. Their request would only exacerbate the problems at the
expense of future students who could fall prey to Plaintiffs’ trap. Simply put,
Plaintiffs have entirely failed to show how their requested order is in the public
interest.
