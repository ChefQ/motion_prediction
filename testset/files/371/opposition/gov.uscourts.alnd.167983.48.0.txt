EDUCATION CORPORATION OF
AMERICA, et al.,
Plaintiffs,
v.

Civ. No.18-cv-01698-AKK

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, et
al.,
Defendants.
UNITED STATES’ SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM IN
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR
APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER AND FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
The three court orders provided by Plaintiffs following the October 29, 2018
hearing on their Emergency Motion for the Appointment of a Receiver and Entry of
a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 2)
(“Motion”) further underscore the inappropriateness of their requested relief.
Accordingly, as authorized by the Court, the United States Department of
Education (with defendant Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos acting in her
official capacity, “Education”) respectfully submits this supplemental
memorandum in opposition to the Motion.
First, Huntington National Bank v. St. Catharine College, Inc., No. 16-CV00465, ECF No. 12 (W.D. Ky. July 26, 2016) (order appointing receiver) (St.
Catharine), does not support appointing a receiver here. In St. Catharine, a trustee

for secured bondholder debt brought a breach of contract claim and sought a
receiver for St. Catharine College after the college defaulted on its loan
obligations. See St. Catharine, ECF No. 1 (complaint), at ¶¶ 1-2, 29, 39, 42.
While St. Catharine College had previously received funds under Title IV of the
Higher Education Act, by the time the trustee requested a receiver, the school had
already announced its closure. The school became ineligible for Title IV funding
as a result of its closure pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 600.40(a)(1)(iii). See St.
Catharine, ECF No. 4-1 (motion to appoint receiver), at 5-6, 9. The trustee
contended that a receiver was necessary to protect its interest in the collateral as
the business liquidated. Id. at 10.
Here, by contrast, the request for a receiver comes not from a creditor with a
claim arising from a default, but from Plaintiffs who seek a receiver for themselves.
Additionally, unlike Plaintiffs here, St. Catharine was essentially a husk at the time
of the trustee’s receivership request—a collection of “physical assets [that were]
likely to deteriorate through lack of use and upkeep.” St. Catharine, ECF No. 4-1,
at 10. Finally, the substantive breach of contract claims in St. Catharine bore a
direct relationship to the receivership remedy, but here Plaintiffs’ declaratory
judgment demand (seeking a construction of the Higher Education Act) lacks a
relationship to its receivership request.1

Plaintiffs have cited no case in which an entity sought a receiver over its own property in
federal court. At the hearing, Plaintiffs described state receiverships over higher education
2

Similarly, the other two court orders that Plaintiffs offer—neither of which
involve a higher education institution—provide no support for the relief they seek
here. These two orders only demonstrate that courts have granted such equitable
remedies in the prototypical receivership case where a secured creditor seeks a
receiver to protect its collateral after a borrower defaults. See BOKF v. Decatur
ALF Grp., LLC, No. 17-CV-2141, Order Appointing Receiver and Granting
Injunctive Relief, ECF No. 30 (N.D. Ala. Jan. 23, 2018) (appointing receiver and
granting injunctive relief in order to protect bondholders’ rights to collateral after a
payment default); BOKF v. Cullman ALF Grp. LLC, No. 18-CV-2140, Order
Appointing Receiver and Granting Injunctive Relief, ECF No. 18 (N.D. Ala. Jan.
1, 2018) (same).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons and those set forth in the Opposition or stated by
undersigned counsel at the hearing on the Motion, the Court should deny the
Motion and dismiss this case.

institutions, such as Vatterott College’s Missouri receivership. However, some states’
receivership statutes, such as Missouri’s, provide a freestanding receivership cause of action.
See, e.g., Missouri Commercial Receivership Act, Mo. Ann. Stat. § 515.510(6) (“The
appointment of a receiver is not required to be relief ancillary or in addition to any other claim,
and may be sought as an independent claim and remedy.”). By contrast, under federal law,
receivers may be appointed only as an ancillary remedy. Nat’l P’ship Inv. Corp. v. Nat’l Hous.
Dev. Corp., 153 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 1998); see also U.S. Opp. to the Motion (ECF No.
19) (“Opposition”) at 23-24 (citing additional authorities). Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim that
state receiverships of higher education institutions provide support for their proposed federal
receivership lacks merit.
