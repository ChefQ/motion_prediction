EMERGENCY MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER AND ENTRY
OF A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
COMES NOW PLAINTIFFS EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA,

VIRGINIA COLLEGE, LLC and NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND FINANCE,

 

LLC (collectively, "PCA" or "Plaintiffs" or "Debtors"), by and through counsel, and move this
Court to immediately appoint a Federal Receiver ("Receiver") to oversee the affairs of ECA and
for the entry of a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction and state as follows.

INTRODUCTION

The exigent circumstances that are present in this matter (as more fully described below
and in the Complaint) require that Plaintiffs file this Emergency Motion to seek immediate relief
from this Court to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs from the threatened eviction of its
institutions from their campuses and the ensuing interruption and unnecessary disruption of the
educational programs of almost 20,000 students nationwide. The Receiver appointed by this Court

will be empowered to preserve assets and maximize any potential return to ECA's creditors and

04612072,3
the Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction will prevent the unnecessary
disruption of the Receiver's work and the students' educational plans.
Plaintiffs request that the Court enter the proposed Order Appointing Receiver (the

"Proposed Receivership Order") attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and expressly incorporated by

 

reference herein, which provides for (a) the appointment of a receiver of Plaintiffs to do all the
things which the board and management of ECA may do in the exercise of ordinary business
judgment or in the ordinary course of the operation of ECA's business as a going concern and take
and maintain full possession of all its property to facilitate the administration of its business and
an orderly implementation of the restructuring plan outlined herein to ensure that ECA's assets are
put to their best use in service to its schools, students and creditors and (b) for the entry of a
Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction restraining and enjoining the
commencement or continuation of any judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding
against Plaintiffs that was or could have been commenced before the entry of the order of
appointment, or to recover a claim against the Plaintiffs that arose before the entry of the order of
appointment, the enforcement of any judgment against Plaintiffs obtained before the entry of the
order of appointment, including any action to obtain possession of Plaintiffs property or
dispossess Plaintiffs from any possessory interest.

I. FACTS

A. Background

ECA's revenues flow almost exclusively from tuition and fees paid by its students, a
significant majority of whom utilize federal grants and student loans provided under the HEA. See
Declaration of Michael Ranchino ("Ranchino Declr.") at 0x00A7 6, attached hereto as Exhibit 2. Like

most career colleges, ECA's student population largely comprises nontraditional students, such as

04612072.3 -2-
unemployed or underemployed adults, who are seeking to obtain job skills in order to find
employment or to change careers.

Enrollment in many of ECA's campuses has been falling for several years. Id. The decline
in enrollment can be attributed to numerous regulatory and macroeconomic factors, including: the
previous Administration's decision to remove the federal recognition of the Accrediting Council
for Independent Colleges and Schools ("ACICS"), the agency that accredits nearly all of ECA's
institutions, which required ECA to advise potential students of potentially dire consequences if
ECA was unable to obtain alternate accreditation within a specified time frame, thereby causing
some potential students to choose not to enroll or remain enrolled; and the recent upturn in the
business cycle that has lowered the unemployment rate to historic levels, so that more of the
nontraditional students typically enrolled in ECA's institutions are able to find employment
without the need for more education or training. Jd.

B. Highly Regulated Environment

ECA institutions and students are eligible for federal student aid programs under Title IV
of the HEA.' ECA's institutions operate in a highly regulated environment. They are subject to
oversight by various federal and state regulatory authorities including, most prominently, the DOE,
as well as their accrediting agencies. Ranchino Declr. at yen 7.

The regulatory bodies that govern the Plaintiffs' operations, including but not limited to
the DOE and the following State Authorities and Accrediting Agencies, are aware of this
receivership filing: Alabama Community College System; Arizona State Board of Private
Postsecondary Education; California Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education; Colorado

Division of Private Occupational Schools; Florida Commission for Independent Education;

 

! For the avoidance of doubt, ECA subsidiaries Culinard, LLC, and J.Y. Monk Real Estate Training Center, Inc. are
not so eligible.

Education; Louisiana Board of Regents; Maryland Higher Education Commission; Massachusetts

The DOE regulates ECA's institutional participation in the federal student financial aid
programs authorized under Title IV of HEA, as amended. ECA's institutions' participation in the
Title IV programs enables its students to obtain federal student aid grants and loans. As is the case
throughout contemporary higher education, many of these students would not be able to pursue
postsecondary education without access to these funds. Jd. at { 9.

ECA has four campuses and a substantial portion of its corporate headquarters staff located
in Alabama. There are approximately 1200 students pursuing academic programs across the four
campuses, with approximately 500 students attending Go-Forward Schools and 700 students
attending Teach-Out Schools. ECA has approximately 350 employees in Alabama directly
supporting the students in the Alabama campuses and another 150 employees with corporate and

management responsibilities supporting the thousands of other students at campuses nationwide.

Cc. Financial Issues and Current State of Claims

Consistent with trends in career education enrollment, ECA's institutions' student
populations have declined significantly in recent years. Because ECA's revenues are produced
almost entirely by tuition and fees paid by students, the enrollment decline has negatively impacted
ECA's financial condition and cash flow, such that ECA currently is generally not paying its debts
as they come due. ECA has been focused on marshaling its dwindling financial resources to
maintain its campuses and its educational programs and services for its students. Ranchino Declr.
at 11.

i. ECA's Capital Structure

On October 15, 2018, Plaintiffs entered into that certain Eighth Amendment to the Credit
Agreement (as amended time to time, the "Monroe Credit Agreement"), with Monroe Capital
Management Advisors, LLC ("Monroe"), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and each of
the lender parties thereto (the "Monroe Lenders"). Id. at { 12.

Under the Monroe Credit Agreement, the Monroe Lenders agreed to lend $16 million to
ECA (as amended from time to time, the "Monroe Term Loan"). As of the commencement of
these proceedings the outstanding principal balance owing to the Monroe Lenders is $19 million.
Id.

All obligations under the Monroe Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security
interest in all of ECA's assets, including all equity interests in the respective subsidiaries. Jd.

In connection with entering into the Eighth Amendment, ECA and the Monroe Lenders
provided a mechanism for a $12 million tranche of funding to be advanced to the ECA receivership
estate upon approval by the Court and a second $7 million tranche of funding to be advanced to
the ECA receivership estate upon approval by the Court. Without having received funding on

October 15, 2018, ECA would have been materially challenged to meet its payroll obligations

04612072.3 -5-
during the week of October 15. ECA anticipates that it will require additional capital of $12
million by the first week in November 2018 and additional capital of $7 million by the first week
in December 2018. Thereafter, beginning in January 2019, ECA projects that it will operate on a
cash-flow-positive basis. Jd. The Court's entry of an order appointing the Receiver and entering
the requested injunctive relief is a condition to the essential funding from the Monroe Lenders.

As of October 5, 2018, ECA had unsecured debt owing to 1,033 vendors and landlords
amounting to approximately $46,773,000. Id.

ii. Plaintiffs' Landlord Obligations

In the ordinary course of its business, ECA's institutions lease real estate to operate at their
various campuses and headquarters. A list of ECA's institutions' leased real estate is contained in
Exhibit 3, which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Jd. at { 13.

On or about September 10, 2018, ECA announced that it intended, in accordance with the
expectations of the HEA, to discontinue new enrollments and to teach out the students already
enrolled at 26 of its campuses, after which it intended to close the 26 campuses (the "Teach-Out
Schools"). The Teach-Out Schools remain vital assets of ECA, as the regulations governing teach-
out require that the students be able to complete their degrees at the campus at which they are
enrolled, unless sooner transferred. While ECA seeks opportunities to transfer the students to
alternate campuses or sooner fulfill its HEA requirements, or otherwise mitigate the costs
associated with the teach-out, there can be no assurance at this time that ECA will be able to
transfer the students at Teach-Out Schools to other campuses, whether owned and operated by
ECA or another institution. Accordingly, ECA plans to remain in possession of all or most Teach-
Out School campuses at least through June 2019, continue certain campus teach-out programs

through the end of 2019, and maintain its educational programs and services at those Teach-Out

04612072.3 -6-
School campuses through that date for the benefit of students, who are still enrolled at that time,
subject to the receivership estate's administration of the Teach-Out Schools. Id. at 0x00A7 14.

ECA further intends to continue to operate each of the Go-Forward Schools, subject to the
receivership estate's administration of the Go-Forward Schools. /d. at {| 15.

Several ECA campuses are presently the subject of landlord actions to recover on alleged
claims for monetary judgments, which are ongoing, as well as to dispossess ECA from possession
of such campuses, and ECA is a party to other ongoing commercial and employment litigation and
arbitration proceedings. Attached hereto as Exhibit 4 is a list of litigation matters currently
pending in which ECA or its institutions are defendants. Id. at 0x00A7 16.

Plaintiffs' outstanding secured and unsecured obligations and lack of liquidity prohibit
Plaintiffs from generally paying their obligations as they come due. The projected costs and net
revenues associated with the Teach-Out Schools, as well as the claims of landlords resulting from
the early termination of leases at the Teach-Out Schools, will exacerbate Plaintiffs' liquidity issues.
Further, pending lawsuits threaten to strain Plaintiffs' ability to operate in the ordinary course and
respond to claims of creditors. Plaintiffs need to prevent a rush to judgment and attachment of
Plaintiffs' assets, in order that the financially viable Go-Forward Schools may be sold to the party
that submits the highest or otherwise best bid to acquire the Go-Forward Schools while ensuring
that the students in the Teach-Out Schools have an opportunity to complete their programs. Id. at
417.

iii. Regulatory Issues

Following its review of ECA's fiscal year 2016 audited financial statements, the DOE in a
letter dated October 18, 2017, calculated ECA's financial responsibility composite score
("Composite Score") as 1.2 and determined that ECA therefore failed to meet the financial

responsibility standards outlined in 34 C.F.R. 0x00A7 668.172. As a result, ECA chose to continue to

04612072.3 -7-
participate in the Title IV programs under the Zone Alternative described in 34 C.F.R. 0x00A7 668.175.
Under the Zone Alternative, DOE placed ECA in provisional certification status and required ECA
to make (a) Title IV program disbursements under the Heightened Cash Monitoring payment
method; (b) mandatory notifications to the DOE should any one of a number of potential events
occur; and (c) additional quarterly reports to the DOE about various financial and operational
matters. /d. at { 18.

The DOE notified ECA in a subsequent letter dated February 29, 2018, of additional
financial and operational reporting requirements arising from its review of the fiscal year 2016
audited financial statements. Jd. at { 19.

ECA submitted its fiscal year 2017 audited financial statements to the DOE on or about
June 28, 2018. ECA simultaneously submitted to the DOE a Statement of Support explaining that
certain extraordinary items and changes in accounting estimates should be considered when
calculating ECA's 2017 Composite Score. The DOE in August asked ECA to file voluminous
operational and financing records to aid in its review of the fiscal year 2017 audited financial
statements. Jd. at yen 20.

iv. Efforts to Fund Operations, Stabilize, and Facilitate a Sale

Plaintiffs have limited options available but to seek the restructuring of their operations
and debts through a federal receivership, which is the only way in which they can preserve the
ability of the Go-Forward Schools to serve their students and the Teach-Out Schools to fulfil their
regulatory requirements to teach out the students, while also permitting Plaintiff's directors and
officers to maximize the value of the ECA enterprise for the benefit of ECA's stakeholders. Jd. at
0x00A7 21.

Without the protections provided by a receiver and the requested stay and injunction,

ECA's institutions will not be able to complete the teach-out of the Teach-Out Schools or

04612072.3 -8-
reorganize or sell the Go-Forward Schools. Jd. at 0x00A7 22. Seeking protection in a traditional
bankruptcy filing is not an option for ECA because the HEA specifically defines an "eligible

institution" as one that, inter alia, has not filed for bankruptcy. 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1002 (a)(4)(A).

y. Restructuring Plan in Principle

ECA has determined that to operate successfully, it needs to close the 26 Teach-Out
Schools and restructure its capital structure or sell the remaining business in order to maximize
enterprise value and permit the Go-Forward Schools to operate without the drag of the legacy
claims of landlords and other vendors arising from the Teach-Out Schools' closure and otherwise
from its excessive overhead. ECA has worked diligently to shrink its overhead, but these savings
alone are insufficient to turn the corner on ECA's ability to operate profitably. Id. at 0x00A7 23.

Under the proposed restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan"), the Monroe Lenders, or
certain of them (in their capacity as a bidder for the assets of ECA, the "Stalking Horse") have
offered to purchase the Go-Forward Schools and ECA's management platform free and clear of
all claims, liens and encumbrances, pursuant to which ECA would transfer the Go-Forward
Schools and management platform assets to the Stalking Horse, who will also pay the Teach-Out
Schools' negative operating cash flow, ensuring the protection of the students' interests and
facilitate the administration of the Teach-Out Schools. The receivership estate would retain the
Teach-Out Schools, which upon completion of the teach-out process would undergo an orderly
windup in compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations and all accreditation
requirements. Jd. at 0x00A7 24.

Plaintiffs request that the federal receivership estate comprise all assets, property rights and
defenses. Plaintiffs request that the Court appoint Sean M. Harding of FTI Consulting, Inc. as
receiver ("Receiver"). The Declaration of Sean M. Harding, setting forth his background and

experience, is attached hereto as Exhibit 5. Plaintiffs request that the Receiver be given broad

04612072.3 -9-
authority over the receivership estate, similar to the role of a chief restructuring officer, leaving in
place ECA's boards of directors and management and other employees to continue to operate
ECA's business and operate the institutions in the ordinary course, subject to the boards' and
Receiver's direction, and to grant to the Receiver the power to direct restructuring transactions
such as the Receivership Financing and the sale of ECA's assets.

This Court has national jurisdiction over all assets, by whomsoever held, wherever located
within the United States, and the ability to channel all claims that have accrued as of the
commencement of these proceedings and thereafter, including without limitation, those against the
Teach-Out Schools and ECA directly, or as guarantor, into the receivership estate for ratable
distribution of the remaining assets.

D. Irreparable Harm Will Occur to Plaintiffs and Their Students Unless a Receiver Is

Immediately Appointed and a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary
Injunction Against Other Claims Is Entered

The immediate appointment of the Receiver and the entry of an injunction staying and
barring other claims is necessary to prevent Plaintiffs and their over 20,000 students from suffering
immediate and irreparable harm. The Receiver is necessary to the orderly oversight and
administration of the teach-out and delivery of educational programs to students enrolled at the
Teach-Out Schools and, after closure of those campuses, the orderly disposition of their assets
under the supervision of this Court. The entry of a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary
Injunction, including an injunction against eviction proceedings, is necessary to prevent a race to
ECA's assets and the resulting disruption of the teach-out process to the detriment of thousands of

students. Ranchino Declr. at 0x00A7 25.
