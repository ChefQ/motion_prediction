INTRODUCTION
This Court previously found that discovery into selective early retirement (SER) boards is
permissible under 10 U.S.C. § 618(f). Adair v. Winter, 451 F.Supp.2d 202 (D.D.C. 2006).
Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration (the “Mot.”) seeks reversal and a protective order due to
recent statutory changes. Defendants incorrectly argue new 10 U.S.C. § 613(a) and other Title 10
changes (collectively “§ 613") addressing disclosure of selection board proceedings, enacted on
October 17, 2006, preclude discovery. Mot. at 1-10. Defendants ignore controlling precedent
and the nature of plaintiffs’ claims.
This opposition first addresses why the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42
U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq., applies to § 613 and not only allows discovery but compels it. Second,
binding precedent requires this Court to find Congress intended discovery into the proceedings of
SER boards because Congress failed to provide the specific language Supreme Court precedent
requires to bar review of constitutional claims. Third, plaintiffs show why discovery is essential
to enable the Court to evaluate the various constitutional claims plaintiffs raise. Fourth, plaintiffs
will show that separation of powers issues arise if this Court were precluded from reviewing
alleged unconstitutional conduct on the SER boards
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Defendants’ argument that § 613 is an absolute bar to discovery ignores precedent and the
cannons of statutory interpretation. Courts must interpret new statutory language in the context
of and in accord with existing law which directly speaks to the issue, since Congress is presumed
to know the law and to legislate in accordance with Supreme Court precedent. Application of
this rule defeats defendants’ arguments. First, RFRA directly speaks to the issue as it applies to
all federal actions and laws and extends and furthers Congress’s long standing objective to

identify, remedy and eliminate prejudice of any kind. RFRA is engrafted into § 613, applies to
defendants’ SER boards, and provides a cause of action with discovery for RFRA violations.
Plaintiffs have alleged a violation of their rights under RFRA. RFRA’s use of the terms “claim”
and “in a judicial proceeding” show Congress intended plaintiffs have a trial de novo and
discovery. Defendants invite the Court to ignore the cannons of statutory construction and
RFRA’s preclusive and decisive effect on this issue, see I below.
RFRA states it “applies to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether
statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after [11/16/93].” Id. at 2000bb-3(a).
RFRA’s “Rule of construction” specifically states: “Federal statutory law adopted after
November 16, 1993 is subject to this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application
by reference to this chapter.” Id. at 2000bb-3(b). By its purpose, design and language, RFRA
applies to the recent amendments to Title 10, including § 613 since § 2000bb-3(b)’s language is
not found in § 613. This shows Congress intentionally placed § 613 under RFRA’s reach, rights,
requirements and remedies. Defendants are silent as to how their interpretation of § 613 can be
squared with RFRA’s scope and application to every area of the government, especially to the
military. Defendants’ argument on its face is inconsistent with and contrary to one of RFRA’s
stated purposes, “to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is
substantially burdened by government”, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(2) (“Purposes”).
Defendants’ failure to even mention RFRA in their Motion is inexcusable. Plaintiffs
raised RFRA’s application in opposing defendants’ previous motion to reconsider in
CFGC/Adair. Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration at 3-18, CFGC
Doc. No. 253. Defendants’ CFGC/Adair Reply ignored the issue, Def. Reply Doc. No. 256, and

their failure to raise it in their Motion here appears to be an admission they cannot escape
RFRA’s reach or meet the burden RFRA places on them. RFRA’s application to § 613 shows
this Court’s prior decision is correct and plaintiffs are entitled to discovery.
Plaintiffs also bring constitutional claims. Supreme Court binding precedent, which this
Circuit has consistently and emphatically embraced, allows discovery unless Congress provides
specific language to indicate that constitutional claims are barred. Congress’s failure to address
RFRA and the Supreme Court’s rule shows Congress expected plaintiffs bringing RFRA and
constitutional claims be allowed discovery to vindicate those rights. See I and II below. The law
is well established that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow courts to allow discovery
while protecting legitimate governmental interests from disclosure.
Defendants’ argument conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and the Constitution's
allocation of powers. See II below. As shown below, the proper interpretation of § 613 in
consonance with RFRA’s purpose, application and language, by law integrated into § 613, avoids
both a statutory and constitutional conflict. Plaintiffs have evidence showing discovery is
necessary to validate their claims of RFRA and constitutional violations. Defendants’
“heightened showing” argument is an effort to rewrite RFRA and the Federal Rules to protect
their misconduct.
ARGUMENT
I.

RFRA’S APPLICATION TO § 613 SHOWS CONGRESS INTENDED
DISCOVERY INTO SER BOARDS
Defendants’ argument that § 613's plain words in the recent amendments to Title 10

addressing selection board proceedings is an absolute bar of discovery into SER boards absent
the Secretary of Navy’s consent, Mot. at 5-9, is contrary to law. While “the language of the

statute controls where it is not ambiguous or unconstitutional,” Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington,
442 US 565, 568 (1979), this is not such a case. Plaintiffs allege the SER procedures and
government actions during these board violates their rights under RFRA. RFRA’s provisions
require incorporation of RFRA into § 613. This produces ambiguity in § 613 because RFRA
provides a cause of action with a de novo trial to vindicate RFRA’s purposes and remedy its
violation, and this is inconsistent with § 613's alleged bar of judicial review. The application of
standard cannons of statutory interpretation eliminate the inconsistency and show Congress
intended § 613 to allow discovery.
Courts “generally presume that Congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to
the legislation it enacts.” Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U.S. 174, 184-85 (1988) (citing
Director, OWCP v. Perini North River Associates, 459 U.S. 297, 319-320 (1983)). This
presumption, which defendants have failed to address or show it does not apply, is particularly
applicable to this case because it shows that Congress intended courts to allow discovery of
selection board proceedings. RFRA specifically creates a cause of action for aggrieved plaintiffs
allowing them to challenge government action that violates plaintiffs’ RFRA’s rights
We quite agree that if Congress had legislated the elements of a private cause of
action for damages, the duty of the Judicial Branch would be to administer the law
which Congress enacted; the Judiciary may not circumscribe a right which
Congress has conferred because of any disagreement it might have with Congress
about the wisdom of creating so expansive a liability.
Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 748 (1975).
Section 613's provisions and scope, as interpreted by defendants, bring it into direct
conflict with the RFRA, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, as explained herein, and the Constitution as
explained in II below. Section 613's language as interpreted by defendants is ambiguous, a fact

they should be well aware of given RFRA’s scope and reach. The incorporation of RFRA into §
613 shows that Congress intended discovery into SER proceedings to expose misconduct.
A.

RFRA’s Application to Defendants’ SER Board Proceedings is Incorporated
into § 613

Congress is presumed to legislate its changes to Title 10 in accordance with its existing
laws and intend the changes be interpreted in light of the applicable law. Cannon v. Univ. of
Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 699 (1979) (“It is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that
Congress is thoroughly familiar with these unusually important precedents from this and other
federal courts and that it expected its enactment to be interpreted in conformity with them.”).
Congress included every area of federal activity in RFRA’s reach, including the military.
RFRA’s “restrictions apply to every government agency and official ... and to all statutory or
other law.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 509 (1997). RFRA excludes no class of
plaintiffs from its protection. Judge Urbina held in Rasul v. Rumsfeld, 433 F.Supp.2d 58, 62-67
(D.D.C. 2006) that even suspected terrorist detainees at Guantánamo, Cuba, are covered by
RFRA’s protection.
RFRA “applies to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory
or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after [11/16/93].” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(a). Thus,
RFRA applies to the old and new Title 10 provisions. RFRA’s “Rule of construction”, §
2000bb-3(b), clearly states “Federal statutory law adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject to
this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter.”
When Congress passed its 2006 changes to Title 10, it knew that RFRA applied to those changes
as a matter of law unless it affirmatively and specifically expressed its clear intent to exclude its
Title 10 changes from RFRA’s reach. Title 10 is silent concerning the exclusion of any section

from RFRA, showing Congress did not intend to limit RFRA’s reach over or its incorporation
into § 613. “[W]hen Congress . . . has used language which plainly brings a subject matter into a
statute, its word is final - save for questions of constitutional power which have not even been
intended here.” Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States, 345 U.S. 59, 64 (1953).
Gonzales v. O Centro Esprita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal (hereafter “UDV”), 546 U.S.
418, 126 S.Ct. 1211 (2006), specifically addressed RFRA’s application to a restrictive federal
statute similar to § 613. UDV respondents were members of a church. Receiving communion by
drinking hoasca, a tea brewed from plants unique to the Amazon Rainforest containing DNT, a
forbidden hallucinogen listed as on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”),
was central to their faith. 126 S.Ct.. at 1217. UDV sought and attained an injunction under
RFRA against the Justice Department’s enforcement of the CSA against its members. Id. at
1217-18. Similar to the government’s arguments here, the government argued in UDV the CSA
(1) allowed no exceptions to the DNT ban to accommodate the UDV and (2) established a closed
regulatory scheme “that prohibits all use of controlled substances except as authorized by the act
itself” which “cannot function with its necessary rigor and comprehensiveness if subjected to
judicial exceptions.” Id. at 1220 (the CSA “simply admits of no exceptions.”).
The Court rejected this “no exception” argument. First, it emphasized the Court’s duty to
critically examine the asserted compelling interest. “RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it
adopted, contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Government’s categorical approach”,
requiring the Court to “scrutinize[] the asserted harm of granting specific exceptions to
particular religious claimants.” Id. Congress’s determination to list DNT “under Schedule I
simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to

6

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 14 of 54

shoulder its burden under RFRA.” Id. at 1221. The Court found the CSA’s provision for the
Attorney General to grant exceptions to the Act’s general ban showed Congress did not intend an
absolute ban. Id. “RFRA ... plainly contemplates that courts would recognize exceptions- that is
how the law works.” Id. at 1222 (citing and quoting 2000bb-1(c) (“A person whose religious
exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or
defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government”))” .
Secondly, the Court rejected the government’s argument that the CSA “establishes a
closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA.” Id. The Court held,
“RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to
‘rule[s] of general applicability.’” Id. at 1223 (citing 2000bb-1(a)). The Court then found the
Government had not shown that granting the UDV an exception “would cause the kind of
administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest” and its “bold argument” of no
exceptions and invocation of general interests were not enough. Id. at 1224. The Court also
rejected the Government’s argument the CSA’s purposes overrode RFRA’s, finding Congress
had “legislated ‘the compelling interest test’ as the means for the courts to strike sensible
balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.” Id. at 1225.
Defendants have failed to show RFRA does not apply to § 613, and in the face of UDV’s
analysis of RFRA’s reach and authority, could not do so.
B.

RFRA Provides These Plaintiffs a Cause of Action Including a De Novo Trial
with Discovery

One of RFRA’s purposes is “to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious
exercise is substantially burdened by government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(2) (“Purposes”); see
Rasul, 433 F.Supp.2d at 66 n.7 (citing RFRA’s purposes). Congress specifically authorizes
7

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 15 of 54

aggrieved persons to bring a “claim ... in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief
against a government.” Id. at § 2000bb-1(c) (“Judicial relief”). Plaintiffs include those who
challenge the SER process and proceedings which led to their alleged unlawful separation and
claim the SER proceedings and actions therein violated their rights under RFRA. Analysis of
Congress’s words shows Congress intended plaintiffs to have a de novo trial with discovery as a
means to vindicate their RFRA Rights.
RFRA established both (1) a duty for defendants to act in ways that do not burden a
persons free exercise of religion unless specific limited conditions are met, and (2) a government
employee’s right not to have his free exercise burdened.
“Claim” is defined as “to demand as one’s own or as one’s right; ... Cause of action.
Means by or through which claimant obtains possession or enjoyment of privilege or thing.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 128 (Abridged 5th Ed. 1983). “A cause of action is created when there is
a breach of duty owed the plaintiff.” Unexcelled Chem., 345 U.S. at 65. Proceeding means “the
form and manner of conducting juridicial business before a court or judicial officer. Regular and
orderly progress in form of law, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement
to the execution of judgement.” Black’s at 629. To provide a cause of action without means of
proving the case is inconsistent with the requirements for a judicial proceeding and with RFRA’s
purpose of providing a remedy and addressing the government’s burdening of religious exercise.
See § 2000bb-1(c). It is also inconsistent with the normally accepted understanding of those
terms, e.g., trial, and their application as judicial principles in American jurisprudence.
Although Congress made RFRA applicable to the federal government under its Article I
powers, it drafted RFRA in the context of its extensive legislation in the area of Civil Rights.

See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 516 (“Congress relied on its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement
power....”). This is evident in RFRA’s provision for attorney fees in 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) for
successful RFRA litigation, i.e., bringing an “action” in its legal context. Congress’s terms
“claim”, “judicial action” and “action” show RFRA provided litigants the right to a trial de novo.
Chandler v. Roudebush, 425 U.S. 840, 862 (1994) held that federal employees had a right to a
trial de novo of their employment discrimination claims under Title VII. The Court agreed with
the D.C. Circuit’s holding in Hackley v. Roudebush, 520 F.2d 108, 121 (D.C. Cir. 1975), that a
contrary interpretation “would require a strained and unnatural ruling” of Title VII’s provisions.
425 U.S. at 848. Examination of Title VII’s language, legislative history and precedent, id. at
846-862, showed Congress meant its term “action” to be a trial de novo, id. at 862. Defendants
have not shown RFRA intended a different meaning.
The terms and concept Congress used in RFRA, i.e. “claim”, “judicial proceeding” and
“action” (§ 1988(b)) all show Congress intended RFRA plaintiffs to have a trial de novo. That
means the right to discovery because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern all federal
judicial proceedings and provide for discovery. As a practical matter, there is no other way to
obtain the necessary evidence to show that a plaintiff’s free exercise was burdened by
governmental action.1 “The Court has more than once declared that the deposition-discovery

If Congress were to limit a federal district judge's authority to order discovery
according to the interest of the [government], the ability of a federal court to
perform its most basic function of deciding “cases and controversies” under
Article III of the Constitution would be notably impaired. Courts cannot fairly
decide cases if they cannot have access to the information needed for a fair,
objective decision. Even when National Security is at stake, federal courts still
review documents to determine whether disclosure is warranted. See 18
U.S.C.App. §§ 1-16 (1994) (Classified Information Procedures Act).

rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment to effect their purpose of adequately
informing the litigants in civil trials.” Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 176 (1979) (citing
Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104 114-115 (1964) and Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495,
501, 507 (1947)). “Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is
essential to proper litigation. To that end, either party may compel the other to disgorge whatever
facts he has in his possession.” Hickman, 329 U.S. at 507.
Plaintiffs allege the Defendants’ SER system and its procedures violated their RFRA
rights. For example, Adair plaintiff George Linzey is from a Pentecostal denomination.
Declaration of CAPT Georg Linzey, Exhibit 1, ¶ 7. He was selected for SER by the FY 98 SER
board. Id. ¶¶ 2, 9. Within both liturgical and non-liturgical faith groups, there are denominations
which specifically reject and hold in contempt pentecostal/charismatic beliefs. See Declaration
of Rev. Dr. Jim Ammerman (Larsen v. U.S. Navy), ¶¶ 15-16 (Exhibit 2). Whether his
identification as a Pentecostal was a factor in his pre-selection for involuntary early retirement,
see Linzey ¶¶ 4-7, can only be determined by an examination of the proceeding’s actual
discussions resulting in his selection.
Defendants maintain their SER proceedings, which selected Adair plaintiff Linzey and
Gibson plaintiffs Byrum, Klapach and Prince, must be frank and open. They in effect argue this
includes the right to discuss a candidate’s faith group and its practices, especially since this
information was provided to the board. But selection of Linzey or other plaintiffs on those
grounds burdens their free exercise. “One type of burden occurs when government ‘conditions
receipt of an important benefit such as employment upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith,
or ... denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief.’” Altman v.

Minnesota Dept. of Corrections, 251 F.3d 1199, 1204 (8th Cir. 2001) (quoting Thomas v. Review
Board, 450 U.S. 707, 717-18 (1981)).
CH Linzey alleges he was pre-selected for SER. He was specifically visited in the spring
of 1997 by RADM Koeneman, USN, Ret., a former Chief of Chaplains, months before the SER
board. Id. ¶ 4. RADM Koeneman told him “Get your resume ready, George. There comes a
time when we all have to leave active duty.” Id. ¶¶ 4-5. RADM Koeneman suggested a church
that could use CH Linzey’s musical skills. Id. ¶¶ 7. This is not merely a case of challenging the
actions of a board member. RADM Koeneman was not on the board, but his message strongly
suggests the Chaplain Corps leadership decided who was going to be SERB’d prior to the board
meeting, a decision implemented through the actions of the chaplain board members of the SER
board which acted as defendants’ agent. If that was done, it can only be established by testimony
of board personnel. If defendants’ decision selecting CH Linzey for SER is in any way related to
his Pentecostal practices, it is a governmental action that has burdened his free exercise, a clear
violation of RFRA. “RFRA defines ‘exercise of religion’ as any exercise of religion, whether or
not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious beliefs.” Rasul, 433 F.3d at 68 (citing 42
U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A)).
In Rasul, the Court identified a number of alleged “governmental actions” against
detained Moslem alleged terrorists which the Court found “falls comfortably within the conduct
prohibited from government action by RFRA.” Id. at 69 [citations omitted]. “The plaintiffs
allege that representatives of the United States government perpetrated blatant and shocking acts
against them on account of their religion”, id. at 71, including placing “the Koran in the toilet”,
id. at 69. Those actions, if true, demonstrate manifest government prejudice and hostility to

11

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 19 of 54

Rasul’s religion and his free exercise thereof. In Rasul, the government committed its alleged
RFRA violations openly against its alleged victims. Here, the government did its burdening of
free exercise behind a veil of secrecy which RFRA authorizes lifting. Linzey claims defendants
manifested the same hostility to him and his free exercise as they did to Rasul.
Selecting CH Linzey for SER because he is a Pentecostal is a forbidden governmental
action. It carries with it continuing consequences far longer than the alleged “blatant and
shocking acts” against the suspected terrorists in Rasul, see id. at 71. Selecting CH Linzey
illegally reduced his retirement pay, a damage that continues every time he is paid. In both cases,
RFRA empowers the Court to right the wrong with a remedy.
Plaintiffs have alleged defendants’ challenged actions and practices, including those
applicable to SER boards, violate RFRA. See Adair Third Amended Complaint (the Complaint)
at 51, ¶¶ 108 – 09 (Count 13). RFRA defines “demonstrated” as “meet the burdens of going
forward with the evidence and a persuasion.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(3). This is an impossibility
without discovery because only discovery can produce the evidence necessary to show a
burdening of one’s free exercise. See note 1 supra.
C.

The Proper Application of RFRA Avoids a Statutory and Constitutional
Conflict with § 613

“Congress is presumed to preserve, not abrogate, the background understandings against
which it legislates.” United States v. Wilson, 290 F.3d 347, 356 (DC Cir. 2002) [citations
omitted]. Congress’s failure to exclude RFRA from its recent amendments to Title 10 show
Congress intended RFRA to apply to Title 10. Congress knew that RFRA provides a cause of
action for any aggrieved plaintiff: “Any law [or government action] is subject to challenge at any
time by any individual who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion.”

Boerne, 521 U.S. at 509. Congress also knew (1) there is a presumption of judicial review for
executive actions and decisions, because barring judicial review raises serious constitutional
questions, see, e.g., Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670-673
(1986) (discussing “the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of
administrative actions.”); (2) once a suit is brought the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the
“Rules”) apply and allow for discovery; (3) discovery is a necessity to both prove RFRA
violations and furnish the factual background to enable courts to provide remedies for those same
violations, see note 1 supra.; (4) the Rules provide courts the means to protect material from
disclosure to the public through such mechanisms as protective orders when it is appropriate,
while at the same time allowing discovery; and (5) the Supreme Court requires specific language
to bar constitutional claims, see II A.
Defendants’ interpretation of § 613 eviscerates RFRA’s words, purpose, and ability to
provide effective remedies, and makes RFRA’s provisions and remedy a nullity, something
courts may not do in interpreting statutes. Rasul, 433 F.Supp.2d at 64 (rejecting government’s
argument that would have made a RFRA “phrase meaningless.”); Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421
U.S. 707, 713-14 (1975) (no statutory provision should be construed to be entirely redundant).
Section 613's brief legislative history shows no awareness or concern for RFRA’s impact on
selection board proceedings and practices. Courts cannot assume Congress merely forgot such
an important detail, particularly in light of RFRA’s reach, application to the military (see below)
and the specific language Congress must employ to exempt or avoid its application. Rasul, 433
F.Supp.2d at 66 (“the court will not interpret words out of the statute for what the government
thinks Congress wanted.”). When Congress provides a specific procedure to be followed, it

precludes the use of all others. National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat’l Assoc. of R.R.
Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1971) (citing Botany Mills v. United States, 278 U.S. 282, 289
(1929). Courts are not free to ignore Congress’s clear command. Id. Congress’s failure to
exclude § 613 from RFRA’s reach is particularly significant here because RFRA’s purpose was
to include military personnel under its reach, apply its compelling interest standard to military
restrictions on free exercise, and provide a cause of action to vindicate a RFRA violation.
D.

RFRA’s Purpose Was to Apply the “Compelling Government Interest”
Standard to All Military Decisions and Actions Affecting Free Exercise

Although the language of the statute is the starting point in every case involving statutory
construction, Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 265 (1981), legislative history is reviewed to
determine whether there is clear indication of contrary intent. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480
U.S. 421, 433 n.12 (1987). Although the Court “will not look to legislative history to replace a
plain reading of an unambiguous statutory provision”, Rasul, 433 F.Supp.2d at 66 (citing BedRoc
Ltd. v United States, 541 U.S. 176, 183 (2004)), defendants’ “plain language” argument excludes
the application of RFRA and its statutory right to bring a cause of action to § 613. Defendants
seek a result inconsistent with Congress’s clearly expressed intent in RFRA; they seek to
extinguish the very right which RFRA grants, the opportunity to vindicate plaintiff’s rights.
Section 613's “plain language” as articulated by defendants is ambiguous because RFRA applies.
Legislative intent is appropriate when evaluating a claim that Congress intended to
preclude or restrict judicial review or discovery because the Supreme Court requires “clear and
convincing evidence” of Congressional intent to do so. Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 37374 (1974) (discussed below). In such cases, the Supreme Court has often looked at the
legislative history of the statute in question to confirm Congress’s clear intent. Id. at 368-74

(discussing “scant” legislative history); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 142 (“a
study of the legislative history shows ...”), 145 (“no support in the legislative background ...”)
(1967). Because defendants have failed to bring RFRA and its implication to the Court’s
attention, plaintiffs must anticipate defendants’ belated attempt to show that Congress: (1) did
not intend for RFRA to apply to the military, (2) was not concerned with the military’s
restrictions on religious rights of military personnel, or (3) intended to restrict discovery, the only
means available to vindicate the rights which RFRA grants and is an integral and necessary
means of proving a cause of action under the Federal Rules.
RFRA’s legislative history clearly shows bringing the military within RFRA’s protection
was one of Congress’s RFRA goals. “Pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the
courts must review claims of ... military personnel under the compelling governmental interest
test.” H. Rep. No. 103-88 (1993), 1993 WL 158058 (emphasis added). RFRA’s legislative
history shows one of its purposes was to bring both the military and prisoners under the
protection of RFRA’s “compelling governmental interest” standard of judicial review when
courts were faced with free exercise issues. RFRA sought to reverse the judicial standard of
substantial deference to the military in religious matters articulated in Goldman v. Weinberger,
475 US 503 (1986). Goldman held the Free Exercise Clause’s compelling interest test did not
apply in a military context and rejected a Jewish serviceman’s constitutional claim he was
entitled to wear a yarmulke while in uniform. Congress drafted RFRA to reverse that holding,
change the standards the Supreme Court applied in Goldman and O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz,
482 U.S. 342 (1987) which addressed the religious rights of prisoners, and make the compelling
interest test a standard in all judicial decisions related to religion in the military and other areas of

15

government. “Under the unitary standards set forth in the act, courts will review the free exercise
claims of military personnel under the compelling governmental interest test.” S. Rep. No. 103111 (1993), 1993 WL 286695, at *8-9. See also id. at *9-12 (discussing the need to change the
deferential standard of Goldman and Shabazz), and H. Rep. No. 103-88 (1993) (RFRA requires
courts to review military personnel claims “under the compelling governmental interest test.”).
RFRA’s legislative history shows some influential congressmen clearly understood
RFRA’s purpose, reach and impact on the military. They opposed RFRA’s mandatory
application to military affairs because it was an incursion into what had been a privileged area.
For example, Senator Thurmond acknowledged RFRA rejected Goldman’s approach and “put
the courts in the business of deciding what religious activities should be permitted in the
military,” which he felt was a “serious mistake.” Proceedings and Debates of the 106th Congress,
146 Cong. Rec. S7991-02, 2000 WL 1250992 (statement of Senator Thurmond)
RFRA’s legislative history confirms what its words say and shows there is no contrary
intent to allow the military to hide what RFRA will expose, the burdening of one’s religious
exercise. Congress corrected what it perceived to be a judicial failure to articulate the proper
federal standard for evaluation of free exercise rights through RFRA’s statutory mechanism.
While addressing the perceived change in free exercise constitutional law the Supreme Court
articulated in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the legislative history clearly
shows that Congress was specifically concerned with the judiciary’s failure to apply a compelling
governmental interest test to military and prisoner free exercise cases. RFRA rejected the
Supreme Court’s deferential standard to government officials and their policies when military or
prisoner free exercise issues were before it. Congress intended RFRA to apply to all aspects of

military decisions involving potential burdening of free exercise.
E.

There Can be No RFRA Right Absent the Ability to Demonstrate a RFRA
Violation Through Discovery

RFRA is a remedial statute; courts have a duty to ensure that Congress’s remedial
objectives are not frustrated. Failure to allow discovery to vindicate the cause of action RFRA
clearly establishes undermines the statute, and frustrates Congresses’s remedial purpose of
eliminating religious oppression arising from governmental actions.
If military victims, including those who allege the SER process violates RFRA, are
denied the opportunity to prove their claims by obtaining the necessary discovery, there will be
no incentive to report or pursue violations. The lack of reporting and effective remedies will
serve as an incentive and encouragement to do exactly what RFRA prohibits, burden free
exercise of religion, exactly as plaintiffs allege in this case. This would increase FFRA
violations and unravel Congress’s specifically designed enforcement scheme. See Jackson v.
Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 175-180 (2005) (holding Title IX implicitly provided a
private right of action because Congress was familiar with the Court’s prior rulings, and not
allowing a private right would undermine Title IX’s objective and its “enforcement scheme
would unravel.”). Furthermore, it would do so only for military personnel, raising significant
equal protection issues. Defendants provide no indication in either RFRA’s language or its
legislative history that Congress intended such a result, nor do they provide any indication in §
613's short legislative history or its words that Congress intended or even considered such an
extraordinary, discriminatory and unreasonable result, contrary to RFRA’s purpose. RFRA’s
history and language show Congress was interested in ending governmental actions burdening
religion and free exercise; defendants’ argument perpetuates and encourages what RFRA forbids.

Defendants argue, Mot. 9-11, as they have in the past, the inability to produce evidence
does not prevent the Court from reviewing the claim, here a RFRA violation. This is absurd
because without proof there can be no claim and such a rule would frustrate RFRA’s remedial
purpose and raise constitutional issues as shown below in II. When Congress creates a right of
action, it is implied that the right of action includes the means to prove it. That is the function of
the Federal Rules and Procedures. “They shall be construed and administered to secure the just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. See Hanna v. Plumer,
380 U.S. 460, 471 (1965) (when situation is covered by the Federal Rules, the court must apply
them unless the Rule transgresses the Rules Enabling Act or the Constitution).
The purpose of the Federal Rules is to allow and regulate the production of evidence to
both establish and defend causes of action, i.e., claims. To argue a litigant has a right to bring a
claim when there is no means to vindicate it, as defendants do, Mot. at 10-11, is to encourage a
violation of Rule 11, not to mention malpractice. See, e.g., District of Columbia Hospital Assoc.
v. District of Columbia, 73 F.Supp.2d 8, 16-17 (D.D.C. 1999) (counsel violated Rule 11 by
presenting “totally baseless legal position”), aff’d, 224 F.3d 776 (D.C Cir. 2000). Saltany v.
Reagan, 886 F.2d 438, 440 (D.C. Cir. 1989), cert denied, 495 U.S. 932 (1990), held an attorney
violated Rule 11 by filing an action which “offered no hope whatsoever of success,” clearly the
situation if § 613 provides no opportunity to obtain evidence necessary to prove a RFRA claim.
F.

The Federal Rules Provide a Mechanism to Allow Discovery While
Protecting Defendants’ Legitimate Interests in Board Secrecy

Congress found no conflict between allowing discovery under RFRA and § 613's
restrictions because the law allows both. Congress is presumed to know the Federal Rules
18

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 26 of 54

provide protections for the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) while at the same time allowing
discovery into its personnel decisions. Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 604 (1982). Congress
knows similar protective measures will protect candid and frank discussions in board
deliberations. “Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with this Court’s
precedents.” United States v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 495 (1997). See also Cannon, 441 U.S. at
696-97 (“It is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress is thoroughly
familiar with these unusually important precedents from this and other federal courts and that it
expected its enactment to be interpreted in conformity with them.”). Congress is presumed to be
aware of Webster and its rationale addressing discovery related to constitutional claims.
Webster addressed and explained the flexibility of the Federal Rules to allow for
discovery of illegitimate and forbidden actions while protecting legitimate government interests.
Webster found that language which prohibited statutory claims against the CIA did not bar
constitutional claims. Id. at 603; see II.A infra. Recognizing the allowance of a claim also
established the right to prove the claim through discovery; the CIA objected. It argued allowing
discovery necessary to prove the constitutional claim would expose the CIA’s workings and
secrets to discovery, endangering national security. Webster rejected that argument and
specifically pointed to the discretion of district courts and the flexibility of the Federal Rules to
shape protective measures which would not endanger the CIA’s mission or practices.
Petitioner complains that judicial review even of constitutional claims will
entail extensive ‘rummaging around’ in the agency’s affairs to the detriment of
national security. [Citation to oral argument]. But petitioner acknowledges that
Title VII claims attacking the hiring and promotion policies of the agency are
routinely entertained in federal court [citation to pleadings and oral argument] and
the inquiry and discovery associated with those proceedings would seem to
involve some of the same sort of rummaging. Furthermore, the District Court has
the latitude to control any discovery process which may be instituted so as to
19

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 27 of 54

balance respondent’s need for access to proof which would support a colorable
constitutional claim against the extraordinary needs of the CIA for confidentiality
and the protection of its methods, sources, and mission. See Kerr v. United States
District Court, 426 U.S. 394, 405 (1976); United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1
(1953).
Id. at 604 (emphasis added).
The CIA’s concern over discovery and its possible implications reflected the
government’s awareness of the plaintiff’s right under the Rules to every man’s evidence, a
fundamental principle in our courts of law, see note 1 supra. The Supreme Court’s response in
Webster showed its awareness of that same right, i.e, no discovery means no claim, and pointed
to the flexibility of the Rules to allow vindication of the plaintiff’s claim while protecting the
CIA’s legitimate needs for secrecy. Congress’s failure to exempt § 613 from RFRA’s reach and
its specific grant in RFRA of the right to bring suit to vindicate the government’s violation of
plaintiffs rights under RFRA shows Congress was comfortable with Webster’s approach and the
ability of the courts to provide appropriate security to protect legitimate governmental concerns
during discovery. The CFGC/Adair Court’s original order allowing discovery of SER board
proceedings provided that procedure. Defendants are not satisfied with that safeguard because
discovery will show they have been hiding misconduct and condoning prejudice contrary to their
obligations to follow the law and uphold the Constitution.
G.

RFRA and its Inherent Statutory Right to Discovery Is in Accord with the
Nation’s Policy to Eliminate Illegal Discrimination

RFRA’s clear words and its legislative history show it was a well-defined congressional
statement of the nation’s contempt for religious prejudice. It fits into the larger context of the
nation’s policy to eliminate illegal discrimination in any form, evidenced in the nation’s Civil
Rights laws, e.g., Title VII, Title IX, and their history. “Since the Civil War, the Federal

Government and the federal courts have been the ‘primary and powerful reliances’ in protecting
citizens against [invidious] discrimination.” Cannon, 441 U.S. at 708 (quoting Steffel v.
Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 464 (1974)). Defendants’ argument asks this Court to ignore that role
and abdicate and reverse the historic role of federal courts in “vindicating every right given by
the Constitution” or other statutes. See Steffel, 415 U.S. at 463-64.
H.

Defendants Have failed to Meet Their RFRA Burden to Show RFRA Does
Not Apply to § 613

As mentioned above, defendants have been on notice that RFRA provides a right of
action, its provisions are engrafted in to § 613 because Congress did not follow RFRA’s
exclusion provisions, and RFRA’s harmonization with § 613 and Supreme Court precedent
shows Congress intended discovery of SER boards. Defendants, aware of RFRA’s plain words
and reach, have not shown RFRA does not apply to § 613. They have failed to meet their RFRA
burden and prejudiced plaintiffs by preventing them from addressing any contrary arguments
defendants might raise.
Defendants cite In re England, 375 F.3d 1169 (D.C. Cir. 2004), for contrary authority,
Mot. at 5-8, 10-12, but In re England did not address RFRA and the parties did not address it.
The issue in In re England was whether this Court had properly interpreted Laxalt v. McClatchy,
809 F.2d 885, 889 (D.C. Cir. 1987), see In re England 375 F.3d at 179-90 (discussing case).
Congress’s changes to Title X without excluding § 613 from RFRA’s reach shows that
Congress intended RFRA to apply, including its provision for trial de novo.
II.

RECENT CHANGES TO TITLE 10 DO NOT PRECLUDE JUDICIAL REVIEW
OF CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS CHALLENGING BOARD PROCEEDINGS
“The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and

in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all
circumstances.” Ex Parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2, 120 (1866). All individuals in the
United States - citizens and aliens alike - are protected by the Due Process Clause of the
Constitution. Matthew v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976). The Due Process Clause applies to the
federal government. Aderand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 204 (1995). Despite
these well settled principles, defendants argue Congress intended § 613 to hide and shield
unconstitutional misconduct from judicial review and deny plaintiffs their fundamental rights,
including the right to petition for redress and protection from establishment of religion. Binding
Supreme Court and Circuit precedent, in addition to RFRA, preclude absolute bars to discovery
when a plaintiff brings a constitutional claim.
Plaintiffs’ claims relating to defendants’ SER process and practices involve legal and
constitutional questions. The underlying questions are who determines whether those challenged
practices, actions and processes conform to the Constitution and can plaintiffs gather the
necessary evidence to show they do not. Defendants say Congress can bar judicial review of
those proceedings, Mot. 9-11, and delegate to the Secretary of Navy the responsibility to
determine if its practices are constitutionally sufficient. Plaintiffs argue precedent holds
otherwise: “Courts sit to adjudicate controversies involving alleged denials of constitutional
rights,” Lucas v. Forty-fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 736 (1964),
because “[t]he power to interpret the Constitution, in a case or controversy, remains in the
Judiciary.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 524 (1997). This judicial duty to declare the
law and the constitution requires courts to control the evidence and address alleged violations of
the Constitution. It is well settled, “judicial control over the evidence cannot be abdicated to the

caprice of executive officers.” United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1982). The Rules
allow access to the facts to support both claims and defenses so they can be presented to the
courts for application of the law. See note 1 supra.
A.

Courts Review Constitutional Claims Unless Congress Provides Specific
Language Showing its Clear and Unambiguous Intent to Preclude Judicial
Review of Constitutional Claims

The Supreme Court has addressed squarely the specific issue before this Court: can
Congress preclude the court’s review of constitutional claims involving agency procedures or
actions? “This Court has held that ‘where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of
constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear.’” Kenmore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 517
(2003) (quoting Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988) and citing Johnson v. Robison, 415
U.S. 261, 367 (1974)). The Supreme Court also has made it clear that such evidence must be
“clear and convincing”, including specific language showing that Congress intended to bar
judicial review of constitutional claims. Webster, 486 U.S. at 603; Johnson, 415 U.S. at 367; see
also Kim, 538 U.S. at 517 (Court requires “a particularly clear statement” that Congress intends
to bar habeas review and citing cases “refusing to find bar to habeas review” without specific
mention of intent to bar such).
Webster addressed the question whether a statutory bar against judicial review in the
National Security Act (“NSA”) precluded judicial review of a plaintiff’s constitutional claim.
The Court found the NSA barred statutory claims but lacked the specific language necessary to
shown Congress intended to preclude review of constitutional claims.
We do not think § 102(c) may be read to exclude review of constitutional claims.
We emphasized in Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974), that where
Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to
do so must be clear. Id. at 373-374. In Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749 (1975),
23

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 31 of 54

we reaffirmed that view. We require this heightened showing in part to avoid the
“serious constitutional question” that would arise if a federal statute were
construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim. See
Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681, n. 12
(1986).
486 U.S. at 603. Accord McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 495-96 (1991)
(affirming finding of unconstitutional INS practices despite provision limiting review and citing
constitutional problems if persons were denied meaningful review).
This Circuit has embraced both the holding and the rationale behind Webster and Johnson
and, before precluding judicial review, requires specific language showing that Congress clearly
intended to bar constitutional claims. A mere general statement that courts may not review a
government decision, action, or proceeding is not sufficient; the language must specifically point
to Congress’s intent to preclude constitutional claims.
This Circuit made clear its adherence to the Webster - Johnson rule and its underlying
rationale in Lepre v. Dept. of Labor, 275 F.3d 59 (D.C. Cir. 2001). There, the Court of Appeals
reversed the district court’s holding that a court had no jurisdiction to hear a federal employee’s
petition seeking review of a decision by the Employees Compensation Appeals Board because 5
U.S.C. § 8128(b) barred judicial review. Id. at 61. Section 8128(b) is similar to the statute in
question here. Like 10 U.S.C. § 613(a), “the language of §8128(b) is uncompromising” in terms
of reviewability by courts, id. at 64. Section 8128(b) provides:
The action of the Secretary or h[er] designee in allowing or denying a payment
under this subchapter is (1) final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law
and fact; and
(2) not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by
mandamus or otherwise.
Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 8128(b) (1994)).

Page 32 of 54

In addressing the question of reviewability on appeal, the D.C. Circuit held “we have
significant guidance from the Supreme Court and the law of this Circuit.” Id. at 64. Lepre’s
discussion of that guidance and the issue, and its analysis of this Circuit’s precedents is lengthy,
comprehensive, and conclusive as to the issue presently before this Court. Lepre’s words speak
for themselves and plaintiffs cannot improve on them. They remain the controlling precedent in
this Circuit.
In interpreting § 8128(b)'s scope, we have significant guidance from the Supreme
Court and the law of this circuit. In Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974), the
Supreme Court addressed whether 38 U.S.C. § 211(a) barred judicial review of a
facial challenge to the Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966, on the
ground that by denying educational benefits to conscientious objectors who had
completed alternative civilian service, the statute unconstitutionally discriminated
against them and infringed upon their religious freedom. Section 211(a) provided
that:
[§ 211(a)'s language - omitted here]
Because construing the review provision to foreclose judicial review of
constitutional claims "would ... raise serious questions concerning the
constitutionality of § 211(a)," the Court looked to see whether Congress intended
such an interpretation. Id. at 366. Finding that "neither the text nor the scant
legislative history of § 211(a)" sufficed to furnish the requisite clear and
convincing evidence of congressional intent to prohibit judicial review of
constitutional challenges to the statute, the Court construed the statute to permit
judicial review of the claim. Id. at 373-74.
The Supreme Court has remained faithful to Robison's teachings. In Webster v.
Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603, (1988), applying the "heightened showing" required by
Robison, the Court held that colorable constitutional challenges to a discretionary
decision of the Director of the CIA to terminate an employee were judicially
cognizable while other challenges to the termination were precluded. See id. at
600, 603. So too in Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S.
667 (1986), the Court rejected the notion that statutory authorization of judicial
review of some acts suffices to support an inference of exclusion as to others. See
id. at 672. Finding that the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395ff and 1395ii
revealed an intent to preclude judicial review only of the amounts of benefits
awarded under Part B of the Medicare Act, see Bowen, 476 U.S. at 676-77, the
Court held there was no bar to judicial review of constitutional and statutory
challenges to agency regulations. See id. at 680. Thereafter, in Traynor v.
Turnage, 485 U.S. 535 (1988), the Court took note of Robison's reasoning, that
25

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 33 of 54

"the prohibitions [of § 211a] would appear to be aimed at review only of those
decisions of law or fact that arise in the administration by the Veterans'
Administration of a statute providing benefits for veterans," 415 U.S. at 367, in
concluding that judicial review was not barred by a challenge to a Veteran's
Administration regulation as violative of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Traynor,
485 U.S. at 543, 545.
Meanwhile, following the instruction in Robison, this circuit, in the so-called
Ralpho trilogy, has required, when confronted with similarly worded statutory
review provisions, special clarity of congressional intent to bar federal courts from
adjudicating the merits of constitutional challenges. In Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d
607, 612-13 (D.C.Cir.1977), the court was confronted with a challenge, not that a
statute was unconstitutional, but that the agency implementing the statute had
violated due process by relying on secret valuation data in ruling on a claim for
compensation for destruction of a private residence. It was also confronted with
claims of nonconstitutional error. A provision of the Micronesian Claims Act of
1971, 50 U.S.C. §§ 2018-2020b (Supp. II 1972), provided that claims
determinations "shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, notwithstanding
any other provision of law to the contrary and not subject to review." Id. § 2020.
The court rejected the argument that a challenge to the constitutionality of agency
action was sufficient to distinguish the case from Robison.
[I]f legislation by Congress purporting to prevent judicial review of
the constitutionality of its own actions is itself constitutionally
suspect, legislation that frees an administrative agency from
judicial scrutiny of its adherence to the dictates of the Constitution
must pose grave constitutional questions as well. Not only is it
daring to suggest that Congress, though subject to the checks and
balances of the Constitution, may create a subordinate body free
from constraints; it also beggars the imagination to suggest that
judicial review might be less crucial to assuring the integrity of
administrative action than it is to make certain the Congress will
operate within its proper sphere. If the courts are disabled from
requiring administrative officials to act constitutionally, it is
difficult to see who would perform that function. Ralpho, 569 F.2d
at 620.
The court applied the standards of Robison, id. at 621, reviewing the legislative
history to determine if Congress intended to cut off judicial review of
constitutional claims, and concluded that Congress "took such a drastic step ...
with marked silence as to its purpose." Id. In the one instance that "might suggest
such a legislative purpose," the court noted, Congress had addressed concerns
about Commission positions becoming "posh sinecures" through dilatory behavior
by instructing the Commission to wind up its work within three years. The court
declined to "assume that Congress courted a constitutional confrontation merely to
facilitate Commission adherence to a timetable, which is ... merely directory." Id.
at 620. However, the court also found "clear evidence of congressional concern
26

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 34 of 54

for the due process rights of claimants under the Act." Id. at 621. Hence,
consistent with a duty to avoid construing a statute in a manner that would bring it
into conflict with the Constitution, the court held that "challenges of constitutional
stature impugning action by the [agency] are cognizable in the federal courts." Id.
at 621-22.
The two other parts of the trilogy, Griffith v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., 842
F.2d 487 (D.C.Cir., 1988), and Ungar v. Smith, 667 F.2d 188 (D.C.Cir.1981),
reaffirmed the Ralpho analysis. In Griffith, the court observed that "[e]ven though
constitutional attacks on a statute carry much less risk of trammelling other
administrative system than do claims that a particular act of an agency was
unconstitutional, we have extended this 'particularly rigorous' style of
interpretation into the latter, more treacherous area." 842 F.2d at 487. The court
held that it had jurisdiction to review an as-applied due process challenge under
the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. §§ 7122-23 (1982). An Internal
Revenue Service employee who took the denial of a within-grade increase to
arbitration succeeded in securing a retroactive pay increase under the Back Pay
Act, 5 U.S.C. § 5596 (1982). The Federal Labor Relations Authority rescinded the
award on the ground that the arbitrator had erred in applying the terms of the Back
Pay Act. The employee filed suit, contending (among other things) that the
Authority's failure to remand to the arbitrator deprived her of "property" in the
form of the pay increase, thereby infringing on her due process rights. Id. at 490.
The Civil Service Reform Act provided for judicial review by "[a]ny person
aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than an order under [ ] section
7122 ... (involving an award by an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair
labor practice under section 7118." 5 U.S.C. § 7123(a). The court found no
specific evidence that Congress intended to preclude judicial review of
constitutional claims and addressed the merits of the as-applied due process
challenge. Id. at 495- 501.
In Ungar, the court held that it had jurisdiction of an as-applied constitutional
challenge to a denial of a request under the Trading with the Enemy Act, 22
U.S.C. § 1631o (1976), for the return of assets owned by a Hungarian
pharmaceutical company that had been seized during World War II. Although §
1631o(c) provided that claims determinations were to be "final" and "not ...
subject to review by any court," the court reiterated that "only the clearest
evocation of congressional intent to proscribe judicial review of constitutional
claims will suffice to overcome the presumption that the Congress would not wish
to court the constitutional dangers inherent in denying a forum in which to argue
that government action has injured interests that are protected by the
Constitution." Ungar, 667 F.2d at 193. A review of the legislative history of §
1631o(c) uncovered no reference to the proscription of judicial review. See id. at
194. Looking to the history of related statutes, the court found at most "scant
assistance," id., and "failed to discover anything that might be considered a clear
expression of Congress' desire to prevent courts from passing on constitutional
claims of those seeking return of vested assets." Id. at 196. The court remanded
27

the case for the Justice Department to establish procedures, consistent with due
process, that provided adequate time for the preparation and examination of
whatever probative evidence was submitted to it in support of a claim. See id. at
198.
Lepre, 275 F.3d at 64-67.
Lepre is one of a long series of consistent D.C. Circuit holdings rejecting a cramped or
narrow interpretation of the guidance of Webster and Johnson or confining those decisions to
their facts and/or specific circumstances.
Some courts have limited Johnson to its facts: allegations that the statutes
underlying veterans' benefits programs are unconstitutional. See Anderson v.
Veterans Administration, 559 F.2d 935 (5th Cir. 1977); Mulvaney v. Stetson, 470
F.Supp. 725 (N.D.Ill.1979). Others, however, have applied the Supreme Court's
analysis in Johnson more broadly and have held that section 211(a) does not
preclude review of the constitutionality of the VA's procedural policies. See
Devine v. Cleland, 616 F.2d 1080 (9th Cir. 1980); Moore v. Johnson, 582 F.2d
1228, 1232 (9th Cir. 1978); Plato v. Roudebush, 397 F.Supp. 1295 (D.Md.1975);
Taylor v. United States, 385 F.Supp. 1034 (N.D.Ill.1974), vacated and remanded
on other grounds, 528 F.2d 60 (7th Cir. 1976). These courts have reasoned that
such cases do not necessitate review of a decision "under" any law as defined by
the Supreme Court in Johnson-that is, an interpretation or application of a
veterans' benefits statute to a particular set of facts. See 415 U.S. at 367.
Moreover, the two purposes behind section 211(a)'s restriction of review are not
threatened by courts' consideration of a single, nonfactual and strictly legal,
constitutional issue. See Plato, 397 F.Supp. at 1302-03. This court has agreed
that the import of Johnson extends beyond its specific facts and that its analysis is
appropriate in determining whether a statute precludes judicial review of
constitutional challenges to agency procedures. See Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d 607,
620 (D.C.Cir.1977).
Carter v. Cleland, 643 F.2d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (emphasis added).
The D.C. Circuit is not unique in its requirement that Congress must provide specific
language showing its clear and unambiguous intent to preclude judicial review of constitutional
claims, and a demonstration of its awareness that it was considering and weighing the competing
issues. “The circuits are in agreement: door-closing statutes do not, unless Congress expressly

provides, close the door to constitutional claims, provided that the claim is colorable and the
claimant is seeking only a new hearing or other process rather than a direct award of money by
the district court.” Czerkies v. U.S. Dept. of Labor, 73 F.3d 1435, 1439 (7th Cir. 1996). These
plaintiffs’ claims are colorable, they attack defendants’ processes, procedures, and practices, and
plaintiffs are not seeking “a direct award of money by the district court.” The Webster and
Johnson line of cases implicitly reinforce the role of the courts to declare the Constitution and the
law when plaintiffs allege unconstitutional government action, a function and competency which
the Constitution does not give to the executive branch.
We do not think that the only kind of constitutional challenge not barred by a
door-closing statute is a challenge to a statute or regulation, the kind of challenge
involved in Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974). Among points emphasized
in Johnson and equally applicable to the present case was the fact that the
Veterans Administration was not competent to decide constitutional issues and
that the history of the statute revealed no intention to foreclose constitutional
challenges. The Supreme Court has read Johnson to stand for the broad principle
that "where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims
its intent to do so must be clear ... in part to avoid the 'serious constitutional
question' that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial
forum for a colorable constitutional claim." Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603
(1988)
Czerkies 73 F.3d at 1440; accord Ralpho, 569 F.2d at 620.
B.

Congress Legislates in Accord with Supreme Court Decisions

Defendants’ argument that Congress may establish privileges, Mot. 9-11, is only a half
truth. Congress may not remove a citizen from the Constitution’s protections through a statutory
privilege, nor may it “create a subordinate body free from [constitutional] constraints.” Ralpho,
569 F.2d at 620. Courts are not free to disregard the rule that Congress is presumed to know the
law as reflected by Supreme Court and courts of appeal decisions in interpreting a statute. “We
generally presume that Congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation
29

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 37 of 54

it enacts.” Goodyear Atomic, 486 U.S. at 184-85. Once the Supreme Court has established a
requirement in terms of the way it interprets congressional enactments, particularly when they
involve constitutional issues, the courts interpreting subsequent legislation presume that the
legislation is passed in accordance with Supreme Court decisions unless Congress makes it clear
it wishes another results. Cannon at 696-97. Webster and Kim are such examples where the
Supreme Court has applied its consistent holdings to find Congress did not intend to remove the
judiciary’s role as the final authority on the Constitution, as is Lepre and the precedent it cites.
That is the case here.
C.

Title 10 Does Not Specifically Bar Judicial Review of Constitutional Claims

The new language in Title 10 addressing review of board proceedings does not
specifically address constitutional claims. These cases have been pending in the courts for over
seven years, and Congress can be presumed to know: (1) they contain constitutional claims, and
(2) Webster’s holding. Congress made no specific mention of its intent that these constitutional
claims be barred. There are no hearings or other evidence that Congress intended to take the
unusual step to bar military officers from raising constitutional claims arising from misconduct or
prejudice in selection board proceedings, a step which would be a significant departure from its
Title VII and RFRA legislation.
The Court cannot presume this is mere inadvertence, given Congress’s extensive
legislation against prejudice in the Civil Rights Acts, e.g., Title VII, which establishes a uniform
federal policy prohibiting unconstitutional discrimination, racial, religious and/or gender.
“Congress does not generally hide elephants in mouseholes”, American Chemistry Counsel v.
Johnson, 406 F.3d 738, 743 (DC Cir. 2005) (citing Whitman v. American Trucking Associations,

30

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 38 of 54

531 US 457, 468 (2001)). If defendants’ argument is correct, § 613 is the only place Congress
statutorily denies government employees a remedy for unconstitutional prejudice. Given
Congress’s extensive and consistent legislation against unconstitutional prejudice, e.g., Titles VII
and IX, it would not have hidden such an elephantine departure from Congress’s pursuit of
prejudice in the mouse hole of § 613. Congress is well aware that courts presume that it knows
the law and legislates in accordance with long-standing holdings of the courts. Nothing in either
§ 613's language or legislative history shows Congress intended to change the Supreme Court’s
requirements in Webster- Johnson or this Circuit’s consistent rulings articulated by Lepre, 275
F.3d at 64-67 (citing Ralpho, Griffith and Unger), requiring specific language to show Congress
intended to restrict the judiciary’s constitutional responsibility to declare the law and measure
government actions against the Constitution’s standard.
Defendants’ argument there is only one “express exception” to § 613's procedures, Mot.
at 5, is incorrect as a matter of law. RFRA is incorporated into § 613 and provides a judicial
exception allowing a plaintiff to obtain a judicial determination of defendants’ challenged SER
board proceedings, procedures and practices, and other actions associated with the SER process.
Because Congress knew there were other exceptions both statutory and judicial, e.g, RFRA and
Webster, it can not be said Congress provided an express limitation showing its intention to
preclude all others. See UDV, 126 S.Ct. at 1221-22 (providing an exception in the face of an
known exemption shows Congress did not intend an absolute bar). Had it wanted an absolute bar
excluding RFRA and Webster, Congress knew how to do so and knew it was required to do so.
Congress chose not to.
III.

DISCOVERY OF SER BOARD PROCEEDINGS IS ESSENTIAL TO
VINDICATE PLAINTIFFS’ CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS
31

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 39 of 54

A detailed analysis of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims as they relate to SER board
proceedings shows discovery is a necessary element of judicial review in order to vindicate their
claims. These claims are presented in detail for two reasons. First, defendants argue: (1) Section
613a ... [does] not deny plaintiffs any information essential to proving their claims,” Mot. at 10,
and (2) plaintiffs remain free to raise their claims, they just can’t get discovery to prove them.
Mot. at 10-11. This is a dishonest argument. “Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts ... is
essential to proper litigation.” Hickman, 329 U.S. at 507. Second, the fact that an alternative
claim may address some aspect of plaintiffs’ claims does not allow the court to ignore the totality
of these individual claims. If the Court eventually finds the defendants’ practice of reserving
board memberships for Catholics is unconstitutional, that does not resolve the plaintiffs’
allegations that (1) consistently allowing the Chief of Chaplains or his Deputy to be president of
the boards violates the Establishment Clause because they have improperly exerted influence;
and (2) the identification of a chaplain’s faith group designation to the board members violated
the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection component. Integral to the plaintiffs’ relief is the
request for declaratory and injunctive relief because that is the only way to insure those practices
found to be unconstitutional or illegal are prohibited in the future.
Although defendants terminated their practice of identifying chaplains’ denominations to
the board after this litigation began, absent injunctive relief nothing prevents them from
reinstituting the practice at a later date, just as there is no guarantee that defendants will not
return to their practice of stacking boards with chaplains. See Northeast Florida Chapter of the
Assoc. General Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656 (1993) (a defendant’s voluntary
cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of jurisdiction to determine the

32

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 40 of 54

constitutionality of the practice). Even if defendants were to institute regulating changes, that
would not deprive the Court of jurisdiction because the past unconstitutional practice produced
an injury the Court can remedy.
While plaintiffs challenge defendants’ past SER board practices, defendants have
announced plans to hold SER boards for Commander and Captain. If plaintiffs are successful
and return to active duty, defendants may seek to reinstitute the SER boards in an attempt to
show the board selections would not change. Therefore, plaintiffs need a declaration as to the
constitutionality of those challenged practices and injunctive relief.
A.

Specific Constitutional Challenges to Defendants’ SER Board Practices

Plaintiffs specifically challenge the identification of each candidate’s three-digit faith
group identifier (called an Additional Qualification Designator or AQD) to the board members.
Complaint ¶¶ 44-45. Plaintiffs also challenge the fact (1) the Chief of Chaplains or his Deputy
have served and may continue to serve unless enjoined, as president of SER boards, (2) their
participation on those boards, and (3) their role in selecting and determining past board members.
E.g., CFGC Complaint ¶¶ 46, 49. Plaintiffs also challenge the use of religious criteria in the
selection process, which is related to the improper use of the AQD, but is also a specific element
of plaintiffs’ allegations challenging defendants’ unconstitutional use of the Thirds Policy as a
Chaplain Corps (CHC) management tool.
The Gibson plaintiffs specifically challenge the constitutionality of 10 U.S.C. § 612 as
applied to chaplain selection boards. The statute requires a minimum of five selection board
members, one of whom must be from the category under consideration. The Gibson plaintiffs
allege this violates the Establishment Clause because this delegates discretionary civic power in

33

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 41 of 54

the award of government benefits to denominational representatives, i.e., persons defined by their
religious identity, the very characteristic for which they were hired. Plaintiffs allege statistics and
evidence from chaplain promotion board investigations shows chaplains act in accord with the
purpose for which they were hired, i.e., denominational representatives, and those denominations
whose members were most often board members do statistically significantly better. See, e.g.,
Exhibit 3.
In CFGC/Adair, the Court held chaplains serve on boards as naval officers, not
denominational representatives. Adair v. England, 183 F.Supp.2d 31, 60-62 (D.D.C 2002).
Plaintiffs include this claim here because it is in the Gibson Complaint and to preserve the issue,
if necessary for appeal.
Plaintiffs constitutional claims arise under the First and Fifth Amendments. “Since the
time of our early explanations of due process, we have understood the core of the concept to be
protection against arbitrary action”, County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845 (1998),
the underlying issue here. “We have emphasized time and again that ‘the touchstone of due
process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,’ whether the fault
lies in a denial of fundamental procedural fairness, or in the exercise of power without any
reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective.” Id. at 845-46
[internal quotations and citations omitted]. This is exactly what plaintiffs challenge.
B.

The Law of the Case Concerning the Elements of Proof Required to
Establish Plaintiffs’ Claims

The above claims allege violations of both the First and Fifth Amendments. This Court
has established as the law of the case the requirement that, for Plaintiffs to prevail on their Fifth
Amendment claim concerning the use of AQDs, plaintiffs must show defendants “used those
34

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 42 of 54

codes to discriminate on the basis of religion.” Adair v. England, 217 F.R.D. 7, 13 (D.D.C.
2002) (citing Defs.’s Mot. at 25) (emphasis added). The law of the case requires plaintiffs
produce evidence that can only come from board members, evidence the Court has already found
is material to plaintiffs’ claims. Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. Johnson (“CFGC”), 217
F.R.D. 250, 256 (2003), rev’d in part and remanded in part, In re England, 375 F.3d 1169
(2004), cert denied 543 U.S. 1152 (2005).
1.

Plaintiffs’ Due Process- Equal Protection claims

To establish a Fifth Amendment claim of unequal treatment, the plaintiffs must
demonstrate that they were, in fact, subjected to unequal treatment through the board procedures,
processes and governmental actions. Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-40 (1976). The
use of statistics alone for SER boards is questionable for several reasons. First, Due Process
claim precedent requires a higher standard of proof than Title VII and statistics alone are not
sufficient. “The Court has also recently rejected allegations of racial discrimination based solely
on the statistically disproportionate racial impact of various provisions of the Social Security Act
because ‘(t)he acceptance of appellants' constitutional theory would render suspect each
difference in treatment among the grant classes, however lacking in racial motivation and
however otherwise rational the treatment might be.’” Id. at 240-41. The type of evidence
showing motive or intent, e.g., use of AQDs or denomination, can only come from board
personnel.
Second, plaintiffs bring claims of individual discrimination as well as class
discrimination. These are two separate claims with different standards of proof. Individual
discrimination is equivalent or analogous to disparate treatment in Title VII litigation.

35

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 43 of 54

“Regardless of how devastating or reliable the statistics may look, the issue remains in [disparate
treatment] cases whether a particular isolated historical event was discriminatory.” Ward v.
Westland Plastics Inc., 651 F.2d 1266, 1270 (9th Cir (1980)(per curium). They allege the SER
process, practices and action allows illegal factors to influence the boards, depriving them of
equal protection and treatment, and these factors included religion.
The plaintiffs’ disparate treatment is particularly evident in the FY 96 SER board results
(Exhibit 4). The Secretary’s criteria emphasized future potential for further service. Exhibit 5.
This means potential for promotion and years of useful service remaining. The board retained
six of seven chaplains with 3 or more failures of selection (FOS), including those who had the
most FOS, Palmer (8), Pyrch (6), and McCreary (6), and fewest years left. The board selected
plaintiffs Byrum who had not been considered for CAPT and had 16 years of service left, and
Adair who had one FOS to CAPT and 12 years of service left until mandatory retirement.
The defendants’ SER board results appear to be gerrymandered, retaining older chaplains
within the respective categories with more FOS while separating younger chaplains with greater
potential for future service. The Due Process Clause protects against arbitrary treatment, of
which this is an example. The obvious explanation is these plaintiffs were more evangelical.
Gibson plaintiff Klapach was a Catholic Navy enlisted man who converted to Assembly
of God, a pentecostal (non-liturgical) denomination. His Catholic chaplain at the time he
converted, who was upset by his conversion, was a member of his first Commander board which
failed to select him. A Catholic was also a board member of the SER board that selected him.
Klapach has a right to know if the same ill will toward former Catholics which he believes
prevented his first selection to Commander was a factor in his non-selection for retention by his

36

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 44 of 54

SER board. These answers can only come from SER board personnel who were present at the
proceedings.
Third, the statistics address a small number of boards and the relatively small number of
results. Dr. Leuba’s statistical analysis of the SER process addressed in F below shows it is
designed to protect Catholics and impacts Non-liturgicals in a prejudicial manner. However,
how that prejudice is manifested in the board proceedings is dependent on testimony from board
members.
2.

Plaintiffs’ Establishment and Free Exercise Clause Claims

Plaintiffs’ Establishment and Free Exercise Clause claims also depend on the
same requirement for proof of actual prejudice or bias by board members, by the Chief or his
Deputy, or the Chaplain Corps. The first test under Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612
(1971), addresses the challenged practice’s purpose. For example, the plaintiffs’ claim
concerning improper influence of the Chiefs or Deputies depends upon evidence that they did, in
fact, use their position to improperly influence selections. See, e.g., CFGC Complaint ¶ 49.a,
(Chief informed “one board of his personal list of who he believed constituted ‘the future of the
Navy’”). CH Linzey claims he was pre-selected by the Chaplain Corps. How did RADM
Koeneman know CH Linzey needed to find other employment? Only board members can tell if
there is a link between RADM Koeneman’s warning and the SER board results.
Under Lemon’s second test, plaintiffs must demonstrate the purpose and effect of the
challenged practice was to either advance or hinder specific religions. 403 U.S. at 612. This
requires evidence of the actual effect flowing from the practices and actions plaintiffs’ challenge.
Strict scrutiny, an alternative standard of review of Establishment Clause claims, is applicable if

37

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 45 of 54

the board showed a denominational preference or bias. Such a showing depends on evidence that
the challenged practice, in fact, allowed preference for specific denominations. Another
Establishment Clause standard of review, the reasonable observer standard of review, see, e.g.,
Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000), requires the reasonable
observer know the facts, including the results, and the context concerning the challenged
practice. This can only come from testimony about what actually occurred during the board
proceedings. In Santa Fe, the plaintiffs challenged the practice of allowing prayers at high
school events. Here plaintiffs challenge the various practices and government actions involved
in the SER process.
Free Exercise claims require plaintiffs show a burden, only possible through discovery.
C.

Discovery Provides the Only Avenue to Obtain Evidence Necessary to
Establish Plaintiffs’ Claims

As shown above, the law of this case, consistent with Supreme Court precedent, e.g.,
Davis, 426 U.S. at 239-41; Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, requires plaintiffs to provide evidence of
actual misconduct and prejudice in the board proceedings. The testimony of board personnel is
the only source of this evidence. “It is hard to argue that the testimony of former selection-board
personnel with direct knowledge of board proceedings is not ‘relevant’ and ‘reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence’ regarding alleged Navy discrimination
against non-liturgical chaplains in those very proceedings.” CFGC, 217 F.R.D. at 256 [citations
omitted].
For example, CH Linzey, a pentecostal, testifies he was pre-selected. He knows this
because he was specifically visited by former Chief of Chaplains RADM Koeneman months
before the SER board met. RADM Koeneman told CH Linzey to prepare for civilian ministry
38

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 46 of 54

and suggested a church that RADM Koeneman thought suitable for CH Linzey. Statistics cannot
determine if CH Linzey was preselected or whether his identification, practice, and endorsement
as a Pentecostal was a factor in his selection or pre-selection for SER. That can only be
determined by an examination of the actual discussions that resulted in his selection. The fact
that he was warned does not establish, as a matter of law, the violation of his constitutional
rights. The actual evidence that he was pre-selected or his Pentecostal or non-liturgical identity
played a part in his situation can only come from the testimony of his SER board personnel.
There are no other alternatives available to CH Linzey to establish and attack his pre-selection or
prejudicial selection.
D.

There Can be No Constitutional Claim Absent the Ability to Demonstrate a
Constitutional Violation Through Discovery

Defendants argue, as they have in the past, the inability to produce evidence does not
prevent the Court from reviewing the claim. Mot. 10-11. This is just as absurd for constitutional
claims as it is for RFRA, as argued in I above, which is incorporated here. A constitutional right
implies that the right may be vindicated and enforced; without such ability the concept of a
remedy is illusory. “All agree that Congress cannot bar all remedies for enforcing federal
constitutional rights.” Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681 n.12.
(1986) (citing Gunther), Congressional Power to Curtail Federal Court Jurisdiction: An
Opinionated Guide to the Ongoing Debate, 36 Stan. L. Rev. 895, 921 n.113 (1984)). Remedies
depend on facts, see note 1 supra, which depends on the ability of the parties to obtain evidence.
When Congress creates a right of action, it is implied that the right of action includes the
means to prove it. That is the function of the Rules. “They shall be construed and administered
to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.

The Federal Rules Provide a Means to Protect Defendants’ Legitimate
Interests in Board Secrecy

Defendants argue here again that board secrecy is necessary to provide frank discussions
in the selection process, and any disclosure destroys this vital and compelling government
interest. This is fabrication, deceit, and a red herring. Nowhere do they explain (1) why
protective orders are insufficient to protect legitimate concerns, (2) how previous investigations
into the FY 97 and 98 Commander and FY00 Captain chaplain promotion boards inhibited such
discussion or undermined the process, or (3) why discussion of forbidden criteria is a compelling
interest. The Court has recognized there are legitimate concerns that must be protected and
ordered the parties to agree to appropriate measures to protect them. See CFGC, 217 F.R.D. at
260-61. As explained in I.E. above, Webster held that protective measures were sufficient to
safeguard the CIA’s interests in rejecting the government’s argument that failure to bar discovery
in pursuing constitutional claims would “entail extensive ‘rummaging around’ in the CIA’s
affairs to the detriment of national security.” Webster, 486 U.S. at 604.
Despite the overwhelming importance of protecting national security interests (not at
issue in this case), the Supreme Court did not shy away from allowing discovery which it
recognized was necessary to establish the constitutional claim which it allowed despite words
barring statutory claims. The Supreme Court found the District Court had sufficient latitude to
shape and control discovery so it could protect national security interests of the CIA. Here, we
are not dealing with matters of national security. Instead we are dealing with matters that would
be open to discovery if this were a Title VII case. This Court can protect whatever legitimate
interests defendants have in their secret board proceedings, which are far less important than CIA
procedures and practices. Defendants have no legitimate interest in discussions concerning race
40

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 48 of 54

or religion. Defendants’ argument that a national catastrophe will occur if plaintiffs are allowed
to discover what really occurred on the boards, despite the opportunity to protect legitimate
interests, can only indicate its fear of the truth or its doubt of this Court’s ability to protect its
interests. Neither is acceptable as a matter of law.
F.

Statistics Show the SER Process Is Corrupt and Prejudiced

Defendants’ argument that statistics show the SER process is fair, Mot. at 12, is incorrect.
After plaintiffs were able to correlate board members’ denominations with board results,
plaintiffs’ statistics demonstrate that in every decision process which uses chaplains to award or
deny government benefits, the board member’s denomination becomes a factor in who receives
the benefit. Those denominations whose members served as board members most often have the
highest favorable award percentages and those denominations with the lowest number of board
members have lower percentages. The differences between the groups are statistically
significant. Exhibit 5, “1977 thru 2002 Denominational Appearance as Promotion Board
Members”, lists in four tiers defined by frequency of board memberships, those denominations
by faith group clusters whose chaplains served as board members on chaplain commander
promotion boards from 1977 through 2002. The differences between the tiers is statistically
significant and shows that denomination influences a board’s results and this influence cuts
across the faith group categories. For example, non-liturgical Southern Baptists in Tier II with
the third highest number of board appearances, have a statistically significant higher percentage
of promotions than non-Baptist non-liturgical denominations in Tier IV whose members have
had few or no promotion board memberships. Liturgical denominations in Tier III and IV do
significantly worse than liturgical denominations in Tier II. Although the number of SER boards

41

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 49 of 54

with chaplain board members is small, the same influence and impact is apparent through
statistical analysis.
Dr. Leuba’s new and complete analysis of the SER process, “Selective Early Retirement
Boards (SER) Compound Religious Discrimination in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps”, Exhibit 6,
examines chaplain SER boards and concluded there were:
2.1
statistically significant differences in exposure rates across denominations –
regardless of who is appointed to the selection panels (disparate impact);
2.2
statistically significant differences in selection rates across denominations –
because of differences in exposure rates, regardless of who is appointed to the selection
panels (disparate treatment);
2.3
statistically significant differences in outcomes across denominations when
Chaplains are involved in making retirement decisions about other Chaplains (religious
discrimination);
and
2.4
when Chaplains are appointed to SER boards, they have demonstrated a
statistically significant tendency to go beyond the written record in recommending whom
to retain and whom to force into retirement (denominational contamination.)
P. 1, ¶¶ 2.1-.4. Dr. Leuba found the list of chaplains eligible for SER is “not random across
denominations nor random across faith group clusters.” Id. at ¶ 12 and Table 1 (p.4). Catholics
are shielded from the process, i.e., a denominational preference, id. at ¶¶ 15-23, 37, 41, 42. The
underlying prejudice motivating defendants’ SER system mechanisms by which this occurs,
related to defendants’ accession and recall policies, is relevant to the question of what happens in
the SER board process because the same bias resulting in preference for some denominations
also infects the SER board process.
Dr. Leuba’s analysis shows Admirals, not hired as denominational representatives, make
different SER decisions than chaplain board members who are hired as denominational
representatives. Id. at ¶¶ 48-91; see Tables 5 and 6. Admirals retained “more than 90% of the
42

Page 50 of 54

officers who were exposed to SER more than once”, id. ¶ 68, and tended to retain those with the
greatest future potential in accord with the precept instructions. Chaplains did not do this,
retaining “barely two-thirds of the officers who survived earlier SER review, id. ¶ 69. “The
difference is statistically significant beyond three standard deviations.” Id. at ¶ 70. Dr. Leuba
concluded “chaplains who sat on SER boards did not judge on the basis of the value of each
officer before them.” Id. at ¶ 73. He found plaintiffs Adair and Byrum, selected by the FY96
SER board, “were abused by erratic, arbitrary and inept (and contaminated) decisions which
[their boards] rendered.” Id. at ¶ 89.
Analyzing the impact of board members’ denominations on the board results, id., ¶¶ 92127, Dr. Leuba concluded “the denominational mix on chaplain membered SER boards
influences decision of those boards (four standard deviations; p<.001), id., ¶ 127, and “having a
matching denomination on the SER board was, on the average, worth three steps (rank orders)
away from being selected.” Id., ¶ 126. The lesson is having an advocate on the board helps, but
this appears to be contrary to the Establishment Clause.
Dr. Leuba’s analysis and conclusions show denomination improperly influences SER
decisions. In Title VII cases, “Even when the statistical proof is so compelling that it might, in
itself, satisfy the plaintiffs’ initial burden, the prima facie case is bolstered and the court’s
evaluation is aided by testimony recounting personal experiences of class members. Such
testimony may ‘(bring) the cold numbers convincingly to life.’” Valentino v. United States
Postal Service, 674 F.2d 56, 69 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (quoting International Bd. of Teamsters v.
United States, 431 U.S. 324, 338-39 (1977)). However this is not title VII and, as shown above,
anecdotal evidence is necessary in a Due Process and First Amendment claims. SER board

personnel have relevant, necessary and critical testimony as to what actually happened on the
boards, especially relevant since defendants will undoubtedly challenge Dr. Leuba’s analysis.
IV.

THE FEDERAL RULES PROVIDE NO HEIGHTENED REQUIREMENT FOR
DISCOVERY
Faced with the possibility that RFRA and Supreme Court precedent may result in

discovery into their SER board proceedings, defendants seek to block discovery of misconduct
through another stratagem, a heightened requirement for discovery. Mot. at 11-13. Defendants
argument asks the court to rewrite RFRA, the Constitution and the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. Defendants provide no authority for such a novel theory. As shown in I.E and III. E,
Webster found the Federal Rules granted courts the authority to take necessary steps to protect
legitimate governmental interests, there National Security. Defendants have not shown why SER
boards require a higher threshold than the Cental Intelligence Agency operations and procedures.
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ argument that § 613 bars discovery into SER board proceedings fails to
withstand careful analysis in the light of RFRA, Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent.
RFRA bars burdening one’s free exercise, specifically provides a right of action enabling those
whose RFRA’s rights are violated to seek judicial review, and applies to every piece of federal
legislation unless Congress specifically excludes its application by citing a specific paragraph of
RFRA. Section 613 has no such language exempting RFRA’s application and therefore, RFRA
is incorporated within § 613. This incorporation provides a right of action which includes the
right to discovery. Not allowing military plaintiffs to vindicate their RFRA rights would be
contrary to Congress’s clear intent and RFRA’s history.
Supreme Court precedent is also clear a constitutional claims may not be barred absent

clear language in the statute alleged to bar such claims. Section 613 has no such language.
Without discovery, plaintiffs are unable to vindicate their statutory and constitutional
rights, a situation which would raise grave constitutional concerns in and of itself. Without
discovery, the Court is unable to fashion a remedy or address plaintiffs’ request for declaratory
and injunctive relief. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide sufficient procedures and
guarantees to protect any legitimate concerns of defendants arising from SER board proceedings.
Consequently, the Court should find there is no legal or statutory impediment to
discovery of SER board proceedings and deny defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration and a
Protective Order. The Court should also order defendant Secretary of the Navy to release SER
board personnel from their oath of secrecy.

Consolidated with

Case No. 1: 00CV00566 (RMU)

DECLARATION OF GEORGE W. LINZEY
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I, George W. Linzey, declare as follows:
1.

I, George W. Linzey, live at 3910 Julie Ln., La Mesa, CA 91941. I have

personal knowledge of and am competent to testify on the matters addressed herein.
2.

From 1977 to 1998, I was an active duty Navy chaplain. Although I was the youngest

Navy chaplain to make the rank of Captain, I was selected for involuntary early retirement by the
fiscal year 1998 chaplain selective early retirement board (SERB).
3.

In 1996, I was stationed at the Naval Hospital Great Lakes, IL.

4.

In the Spring of 1997, RADM Al Koeneman, the Navy’s retired Chief of Chaplains,

drove to the Great Lakes Naval Hospital from his home in Iowa to give me a message: “Get your
resume ready, George. There comes a time when we all have to leave active duty. There’s a fine
church with a good music program, needing a new Minister of Music. It’s the Covenant
Presbyterian Church of West Lafayette, Indiana. You’d do well there.”
5.

I asked him, “Are you telling me something?” RADM Koeneman replied, “Yes, get your
99cv2945 & 00cv 566
EXHIBIT 1

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6-2

Page 2 of 3

resume ready.”
6.

I took that to mean that I was going to be selected for early retirement (SERBed) the

following year which, in fact, I was.
7.

It was not unusual that RADM Koeneman, a liturgical, would recommend me, a non-

liturgical Pentecostal, for a job with a liturgical congregation because he knew that I had been
trained in liturgical music and had performed and ministered in music in liturgical churches..
8.

Because I was convinced if the veracity of RADM Koeneman’s warning, I visited

Covenant Presbyterian Church in October 1997 to evaluate it for a possible job when RADM
Koeneman’s prophecy later came true. I later decided to retire in the San Diego area.
9.

On January 2, 1998, while on leave in San Diego, I received a message to call RADM

Kevin Greene, the Commander of Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Ill., where I was stationed.
When he answered the phone, I said “ADM Greene, this is Chaplain Linzey returning your call. I
have been SERBed, haven’t I?” He replied, “Well, as a matter of fact you have been SERBed.”
I said, “RADM Koeneman prepared me for it in advance last year, and asked me to get my
resume ready. I’ll be alright.”
10.

This experience confirmed something I had been told when I attended the Advanced

Course of the Navy Chaplain School, in 1986-87. We were told that “About 80% of all selection
board decisions are decided before the boards even convene in Washington.”
11.

No liturgical Protestants were SERB’d the year I was selected; there were three other

non-liturgical chaplains and a Catholic priest, CAPT Ron Madden.
12.

CAPT Madden was the Catholic board member on the FY98 Commander Chaplain board

whose actions guaranteed liturgical chaplain (CH) Stan Aufderheide (Lutheran, Missouri Synod)

Page 2 of 3

99cv2945 & 00cv 566
EXHIBIT 1

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

failed of selection (FOS) to Commander. CH Aufderheide’s FOS resulted in several
investigations that were embarrassing to the Navy and the Chaplain Corps. Other deposition
testimony alleges CH Madden bragged to a group of chaplains in San Diego whom he was
briefing on the promotion board process that he was instrumental in getting CHs Cuddy and
Clark, two Catholics with terrible records as shown by the subsequent investigations, selected
from above zone by the FY 98 Commander board.
13.

The Chief during the FY98 Chaplain Commander promotion board was liturgical RADM

Muchow who, like Aufderheide, was a Lutheran, Missouri Synod. The Chief of Chaplains
(Chief) during the FY98 SER board was liturgical RADM Holderby, also a Lutheran (ELCA)
who was the Deputy Chief when the FY 98 Commander Chaplain promotion board convened.
14.

I believe that CH Madden was preselected for SER like me; in his case as punishment

because his vendetta against CH Aufderheide resulted in investigations showing the promotion
system was corrupt and manipulated by bias.
The above declaration is true and accurate to the best of my ability and is made under
penalty of perjury.

DECLARATION OF REV. DR. JIM AMMERMAN
CHAPLAIN (COLONEL), U.S. ARMY RETIRED
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I, Jim Ammerman, declare as follows:
1.

My name is E. H. Jim Ammerman. The E. H. stands for Elmer Harmon, a family name,

but I have always been called Jim and “Jim Ammerman” is the name I use and am known by. I
live at 2721 Whitewood Dr., Dallas, Texas. 75233-2713. I have personal knowledge of and am
competent to testify on the matters and material addressed herein.
2.

I am the Director of Chaplaincy Full Gospel Churches (“CFGC”). I have been the

endorser for CFGC since it became a DOD recognized endorsing agency in 1984.
3.

I make this declaration to address the Navy’s argument on page 37-38 of its Opposition to

the Larsen plaintiffs’ Summary Judgment Motion implying that a non-liturgical chaplain can
meet the free exercise needs of all other non-liturgical personnel. That is flat wrong and reflects
the same sort of Navy prejudice that led CFGC to file suit to defend and vindicate the rights of its
chaplains and the service personnel they serve.
4.

It is possible for CFGC chaplains to minister to other non-liturgical faith groups. CFGC

chaplains have conducted liturgical services, General Protestant services and contemporary or
general non-liturgical services. Some CFGC chaplains have come from liturgical churches, e.g.,
United Methodist. However, some personnel could be uncomfortable with a CFGC chaplain

EXHIBIT 2

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

depending on the ministry situation and what the person believes concerning Charismatics.
5.

Non-liturgical chaplains who are not charismatic or Pentecostal are not able to meet or

minister to Pentecostal/charismatic free exercise needs, particularly if the chaplain belongs to a
faith group which rejects or condemns charismatic/Pentecostal beliefs and practices. For such a
chaplain to participate in or conduct a charismatic service could result in his endorsement being
terminated.
6.

My personal history as a chaplain and endorser support these conclusions.

7.

I began my military career During World War II when I enlisted in the U.S. Navy (the

“Navy”) on July 20, 1942. After serving on destroyers for about a year, I was selected for Naval
aviation school. I completed pilot training in 1945 and was honorably discharged from the Navy
in November 1945.
8.

Returning to civilian life, I started college, completed my undergraduate degree in 1949,

enrolled in Southwestern Theological Seminary in Forth Worth, Texas and graduated with a
Masters of Divinity (a 3 year degree) in 1954.
9.

In 1946 while still in college, I was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister and began

pastoring a church in the Southern Baptist denomination. I continued to pastor Southern Baptist
churches, even while in college and seminary, until I went into the Army in 1954.
10.

After graduating from seminary in 1954, I was commissioned as a chaplain in the U.S.

Army. The Southern Baptist Convention endorsed me during my 23 years as an active duty
Army chaplain. I retired in 1977 at the grade of Colonel.
11.

While pastoring various churches before entering the Army, I experienced what some

people refer to as the “full gospel” or “Pentecostal phenomenon” where God, in response to the

Page 2 of 5

99cv2945 & 00cv 566
EXHIBIT 2

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Page 3 of 5

prayers of ordinary Christians, displays his power through the Holy Spirit, performing such
things as healings and miracles, and things which cannot be explained by circumstance or reason.
12.

In the Army, I came in contact with and participated in what was called the “Charismatic

Movement”, a Pentecostal type experience that touched many churches and denominations, both
liturgical and non-liturgical, and was similar to the Pentecostal phenomenon I had already
experienced in my ministry.
13.

The Charismatic Movement had a distinct type of worship with no fixed liturgy and a

distinct type of personal ministry. It is distinct in the sense it is different from the usual liturgical
and non-liturgical Protestant services.
14.

The Charismatic Movement Many led to the formation or establishment of many new

churches not affiliated with a denomination.
A.

I started the CFGC in 1982 to provide an endorsing agency for charismatic clergy

from these charismatic non-denominational churches so their clergy could become
military chaplains and serve the needs of the many charismatic service personnel.
B.

CFGC became a DOD recognized endorsing agency in 1984.

C.

CFGC currently represents over 8.5 million charismatic Christians, the second

largest non-liturgical faith grouping after the Southern Baptist Convention.
D.

The Navy has not provided a means by which its personnel who come from the

churches under CFGC’s umbrella can identify themselves as charismatic. In the early
90s, after the First Gulf War, the Navy vetoed an Armed Forces Chaplain Board proposal
which would have allowed this. This is one of the issues in CFGC v. Winter.
15.

Many Southern Baptists strongly reject and condemn the Charismatic Movement and its

Page 3 of 5

99cv2945 & 00cv 566
EXHIBIT 2

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 6-3

Page 4 of 5

Pentecostal/charismatic beliefs and practices. I know this from personal experience, many
Southern Baptist pastors have lost their jobs when they have become “baptized in the Spirit.”
Other non-liturgical and liturgical faith groups or denominations also strongly reject
Pentecostal/charismatic beliefs and practices.
16.

CFGC Navy chaplains have reported to me very prejudicial comments by their command

chaplains addressed to them or CFGC, such as “You belong to a splinter sect” and “People who
worship like this (meaning charismatics) shouldn’t be allowed on base and their chaplains should
not be allowed in the Navy.”
17.

This illustrates some of the types of prejudice directed against CFGC because of its

charismatic beliefs and practices. For example, although the Armed Forces Chaplain Board
recognized CFGC as an endorsing agency in 1984, the Air Force did not accept CFGC chaplains
until 1990 after I threatened to initiate a DOD IG investigation.1
18.

In 1997 I wrote a letter to Navy Chief of Chaplains RADM Byron Holderby complaining

about the Navy’s treatment of CFGC chaplains, particularly in promotions.
19.

I informed RADM Holderby that I had stopped recommending chaplain candidates

consider the Navy as a viable career option several years earlier because of the Navy’s prejudicial
treatment of charismatic chaplains.
20.

If a candidate requested the Navy, I would counsel them on the difficulties they would

face because the evidence and experience showed the Navy did not treat CFGC chaplains fairly.
CFGC processed those candidates who still asked to go in the Navy.
21.

CFGC chaplains have done well in all services except the Navy. Four of the CFGC
1

Since that time, CFGC chaplains have done well in the Air Force.

Page 5 of 5

chaplain plaintiffs in the CFGC case were not allowed to continue in the Navy and went into the
Army Chaplain Corps. All have been promoted to the rank of Major and two were selected for
post-graduate schooling at Army expense.
22.

Despite my letter to RADM Holderby, the prejudice against CFGC chaplains in

promotions and accessions has continued. Since there was no other way to convince the Navy to
treat CFGC fairly and operate on a level playing field, CFGC filed suit to seek redress through
the courts.
23.

Many liturgical faith groups share common beliefs and worship practices. While the

same is true of some non-liturgical faith groups, there are many distinct differences among them.
As I mentioned above, many liturgical and non-liturgical faith groups disagree with and some
condemn charismatic/Pentecostal beliefs and practices.
24.

As I stated above, my experience and the experience of CFGC chaplains, it is possible for

to minister to many non-liturgical faith groups. However, Non-liturgical chaplains who are not
charismatic or Pentecostal are not able to meet Pentecostal/charismatic free exercise needs.
25.

On February 2, 2007, the Navy6 Chief’s Office informed us the Navy needed 66

chaplains in order to fill its quota for this year.
I make this declaration under penalty of perjury, it is true and accurate to the best of my
ability, and it represents the testimony I would give if called upon to testify in a court of law.

Case No. 1: 07-mc-269 (RMU)

Selective Early Retirement Boards (SER)
Compound Religious Discrimination
in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps
A Statistical Analysis and Declaration by Harald R. Leuba, PhD1
Summary:
1
Selective (Involuntary) Early Retirement may be an appropriate management tool when used
by the U.S. Navy in general, if the number of Active Duty Officers has to be reduced faster than may
occur via voluntary retirement.
2
But when the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps uses this tool, religious exploitations come to play
which lead to:
•

2.1 statistically significant differences in exposure rates across denominations –
regardless of who is appointed to the selection panels (disparate impact);

•

2.2 statistically significant differences in selection rates across denominations –
because of differences in exposure rates, regardless of who is appointed to the selection
panels (disparate treatment);

•

2.3 statistically significant differences in outcomes across denominations when Chaplains
are involved in making retirement decisions about other Chaplains (religious discrimination);

and
•

2.4 when Chaplains are appointed to SER boards, they have demonstrated a statistically

The SER Protocol
3

When the Secretary of the Navy determines that:
“the Navy is currently faced with the need to increase the number of retirements
of commanders [e.g.] beyond the number of approved voluntary and involuntary
retirements”2,

a selective early retirement board is convened, and guidance (a “Precept”) is issued which appoints a
president, identifies members of the board, establishes the place, date and time for the board to meet,
and directs the board to select to retain, all but:
•
•

3.1 a specified number of officers (in this case eight),
3.2 whose early retirement, “in the opinion of the majority of the board, is in the best
interest of the Navy”.

4
Federal law, 10 USC §638, §638a, and §611(b), establishes facially neutral objective rules for
determining SER eligibility, and the Chief of Naval Personnel is charged with producing the list of
eligible candidates as of the date the board convenes.
5

The precept states:
“The major criterion for the Navy’s success is its ability to conduct prompt and sustained
combat operations. A balance of skills among the Navy’s leaders is the key to maintaining
this ability. Excellence in operational environments and during arduous, demanding
deployments is an important measure of the qualities the Navy requires. Officers may also
have demonstrated leadership, skill, integrity, and resourcefulness in other difficult and
challenging joint and in-service assignments. You must ensure the officers retained possess
the qualities to excel in positions of responsibility and authority appropriate to their grade. \
You must consider each officer’s potential for future contributions in both traditional and
more specialized assignments and retain those who have the highest potential for significant
further service. When determining whom to retain, you should also give consideration to the
resources expended by the Navy in preparing officers for particular assignments, and the
needs of the Navy in managing billets with long training pipelines.”3

6
The precept specifies that the “board will consider only those official records provided by the
Chief of Naval Personnel, as well as written communications from eligible officers”.

Selection Board to Recommend Commanders in the Chaplain Corps for Selective Early
Retirement.” Reference 1.

Board members are required to sign an oath of strict compliance with the precept and absolute
impartiality in their decisions.

In the example at hand, the Secretary appointed:
RADM Anderson B. Holderby, Jr.4

and
RADM Edward Moore, Jr. USN
CAPT Michael H. Kennedy, CHC, USN
CAPT George C. Paul, CHC, USNR and
CAPT William P. Dillon, Jr., CHC, USN as members.
9
In the eight years between 1991 and 1998, there were five SER boards for CAPT selection and
seven SER boards for CDR selection. There was no CAPT board in 1993, 1994, and 1995, and no
CDR board in 1992.
10 All of the SER boards for CAPT, and the 1991-1993 SER boards for CDR, were staffed with
(a) the Chief of Chaplains as President, and four Admirals from other communities as members. The
1994 SER for CDR’s had Admirals as board members, including a line officer as the President. The
1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 SER Boards for CDR’s were staffed with the Chief of Chaplains as the
President with three subordinate Chaplains and a line officer as board members.

Disparate Impact
11 The rules for determining eligibility for SER seem both objective and facially neutral, dealing
with total years of experience, time in grade, eligibility for current voluntary retirement or imminent
mandatory retirement (at age 62), presence on a promotion list, etc. The rules governing eligibility
for SER, as interpreted by the office to which the Chief of Naval Personnel has delegated that task,
supposedly apply to both Regular and Reserve active duty officers, but there is either some discretion
in terms of inclusion, or some flexibility in interpretation with respect to temporary assignments,
duty stations, or reserve status. When the Defendants reconstructed the eligibility lists for Discovery
in Wilkins, they reported uncertainties, some of which they “resolved” by reference to biographical
data in Volume X of the Chaplains History and phone calls to endorsers, and some of which they
were not able to resolve. (See Reference 2.)
12 Objective or not, replicable or not, facially neutral they may be, but the list of Chaplains
eligible for SER is not random across denominations, nor random across faith group clusters.
13 Column (1) of Table 1 shows the number of CDR’s who were on Active Duty (according to
the biographical data in Volume X of the Chaplain Corps History, Reference 3) on 9/30/90 when the
SER season started.

When the Board actually met RADM Holderby sat as president.

14 This number is not the SER eligibles for 1991, and it is certainly not the SER eligibles for
1992, 1993, and so forth – as new promotions, and unexpected retirements happen, or as Chaplains
move into and out of the Reserves, either on their own petition, or by action of the Community
Manager – to protect a Chaplain, or to meet or evade an administrative requirement (a la Berto,
2007; Reference 4.)
15 All of these inventory changes, and others, can affect the moving total number of Chaplains at
CDR and CAPT, but whatever changes happen should be random across denominations, unless there
is denominational preference being exercised in the changes – which could be its own cause for
disparate impact.

Column (2) is from data the Defendants gave the Court. (See Fact 25, Reference 5.)
Column (3) corrects the data in Column (2) to adjust for repeated exposures; it is certainly true, for
example, that CDR Klapach was exposed to SER four times (and selected for retirement once), and
that CDR Umbaugh was exposed to SER six times, and selected for retention all six times, etc.
Clearly, for these two CDR’s, the probability of being selected for retirement is not once in ten
exposures, it is once in two Chaplains. The Navy’s tabulation of the number of occasions of SER
exposure, rather than the number of different Chaplains exposed to SER, distorts both exposure rates
and selection rates across faith group clusters (see below) .

at least one time.
Column (5) is the relative percent of all the CDR’s in Column (3) represented by each Faith Group.
This is the “share” of the total exposure, borne by each faith group cluster.
Column (6) converts the shares in Column (5) into a relative ratio. Note that Liturgicals are more
than twice as likely to be exposed to SER as Roman Catholics. Non-Liturgicals are more than three
times as likely to be exposed to SER.
16 I conclude that something in the implementation of the eligibility rules for SER is having a
disparate impact – to protect Catholic Chaplains and to overexpose non-Liturgical Chaplains.
17 The Chi square here, comparing (a) Roman Catholic exposure to SER to (b) non-Catholic
exposure to SER, is statistically significant beyond three standard deviations; p < .0004.

19 All the columns in Table 2 are defined like the corresponding column in Table 1, except that
the data in Table 2 address Captains rather than Commanders. The explanation for why the
percentages in Column (4) in Table 2 are larger than the similar numbers in Table 1 is that Captains
have, on average 7.5 years more experience than CDR’s, and a greater proportion at the higher rank
are likely to be entrained by SER rules based on years of experience. The average Captain was

promoted 19.3 years after being commissioned.
20 The results in Table 2 are not statistically significant, but they are in the same direction as the
results from Table 1 – indicating again that something in the way the SER eligibility rules are
interpreted in the Chaplain Corps is protecting Catholics CAPT’s from exposure to SER.
21 The way the Chaplain Corps implements SER, Catholics get a “pass”, a “Get Out of Jail Free”
card if you will; for CDR’s and CAPT’s combined, only 51% of the Active Duty Catholics get
exposed to the risk of Involuntary Retirement versus 93% for the non-Catholics.
22

Catholics alone do not suffer full cohort exposure to Involuntary Retirement.

23 There is an interpretational framework for evaluating workplace discrimination which does not
require pointing at a particular cause, but which allows for an assessment of what happened, and
then infers that whatever happened, happened for a reason. If the impact is statistically significant,
the presumption of no bias is called into question, and the burden of explanation shifts to the
Defendants. However ....
An example of how this could happen.
24 I am not saying that the following example is the nexus of the benefit that Catholics receive vis
a vis SER exposure. I am saying that this is an illustration of how a set of superficially innocuous
protocols can lead to religious preference.
25 The SECNAV instruction which applies to all Selective Early Retirement boards, not just
those for the Chaplain Corps, specifies, (among other conditions) that eligible Officers are, e.g., in
FY95:
“- Commanders (O-5). Officers who have completed at least one year Time-In-Grade and
nineteen years of Active service as of 1 Jul 94, and who are senior to the junior officer named
in paragraph 4 for their respective competitive categories.”
26 The superficial reason for restricting eligibility consideration to Officers with 19 years of
Active service, is so that each Officer’s value to the Navy can be compared to their peers on the basis
of comparable records of performance in their chosen disciplines.
27 For most elements of the Navy, this is straight forward and unbiased. Most Navy Officers are
commissioned at the bottom rung of the chain of command and work their way up.
28 For the Chaplain Corps this focus on years of Active service can introduce distortions. Some
Chaplains come to their “callings” later in life; they may have served in the ranks before “taking the
cloth”. This gives those particular Chaplains time in Active Duty which is not comparable to general
“Chaplain duty” time. On the other hand, many, in fact most, Catholic Chaplains are brought into

Page 7 of 44

the Service at a higher rank than their non-Catholic peers, and many recycle through the Reserves;
both of these practices can give Catholic Chaplains less Active Duty time than their rank peers.
29 I do not know, and do not opine, on whether it is “right” to compare Chaplains on the basis of
general Active Duty time or on the basis of time in grade.
30 I do know that it is possible for these seemingly innocuous provisions to have the effect of
“protecting” Catholic Chaplains from exposure to SER.

Disparate Treatment
31 If exposure to SER were just a military designation, with no practical consequence, it would
not matter that as administered by the Chaplain Corps, Catholics were protected from it, and that
non-Liturgicals in particular received more than their fair share of the designation.
32 But SER exposure happens in a context where the SER board is ordered to select out, i.e.,
mark for forced retirement, a pre-specified, fixed number of Chaplains for involuntary removal from
Active Duty. If the subsequent action is equitably administered, exposure to SER makes every
designated candidate equally vulnerable to an adverse action.
33 Tables 1 and 2 provided data on the results of SER eligibility which demonstrated that the
process had an uneven, a disparate, impact upon Catholics and non-Catholics.
34 Tables 3 and 4 provide the data which indicate what happened once the exposure began, i.e.,
what happened during the execution process.
35

In Tables 3 and 4:

Col(1) is the same data as was presented in Table 1; this is not the total number of CDR’s exposed to
SER, but it is an unbiased estimate of the number who could have been exposed to SER, but for the
denominational discrimination inherent in the determination of eligibility.
Col(2) is the same data as was presented in Table 1; this is the number of different times a Chaplain
of this faith group cluster was considered by some SER board. These data are quoted from
information the Defendants provided to the Court. (See Reference 5.)
Col(3) is the same data as was presented in Table 1; this is the actual count of the number of
different Chaplains from this faith group cluster who were considered by some SER board. These
data only became available when the Navy, via discovery, produced the names of all the candidates
(not just their denominations) before every SER board, and the identification of which Chaplains
were considered and which were selected became visible to the Plaintiffs. (See Reference 7.)

Col(4) is the actual count of the number of Chaplains who were selected for SER from this faith
group cluster. These figures also come from the data the Defendants provided to the Court, and, but
for a few changes in faith group cluster assignment5, are identical to those figures. [There is no need
in this column to correct for double counting; although he (or she) may be exposed to SER several
times, a Chaplain is only selected for SER once6.]

The data in Table 3 show, that for CDR’s:
36.1 not only is the Chaplain Corps’ administration of SER more likely to expose nonCatholics than Catholics to involuntary retirement, and

5

The Chaplain Corps has been inconsistent in its allocation of denominations to the
various faith group clusters. (See Endnote: “Faith Group Cluster as a proximal cause of
denominational bias in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps”.)
6

Perhaps this belabors the obvious, but one needs to read what is said about SER
selection carefully. The SER board is told to select for retention the best qualified, most
promising Officers, but it is also ordered to select for SER (i.e., to select for Selective Early
Retirement) a specific number of Officers. This is sometimes referred to as “being serbed”
(spelled: SERB’d).

36.2 not only does the Chaplain Corps’ administration of SER expose non-Catholics
more often than Catholics, but also:

•

36.3 at the end of the process, non-Catholics are much more likely than Catholics (five
times more likely) to be selected for involuntary retirement.

37 The Chaplain Corps’ policy and practice with respect to SER administration has a statistically
significant impact which, at least with respect to CDR’s, benefits Catholic Chaplains and
disadvantages all other denominations. [The binomial z, testing 4/66 vs 74/133, is nine and a half
standard deviations, p < .0001.]
38 Table 4 is unto Table 3 as Table 2 was unto Table 1, i.e., Table 4 looks at what happened to
Captains in the Chaplain Corps, once the SER process was underway.

39 As with Table 2 (for Captains) compared to Table 1 (for Commanders); the data in columns 5
and 6 in Table 4 (unlike the data in Table 3), do not rise to the level of statistical significance
[binomial z = 1.0], but the difference is again (still) in the direction of benefit for Catholics and
disadvantage for non-Liturgical Chaplains.
40 We know, from Table 3 at least, although the result is corroborated by the data in Table 4, that
non-Liturgical Chaplains were at a statistically significant disadvantage in the SER boards.
41 The non-Liturgical cohort in the Chaplain Corps lost five times as many CDR’s to SER, both
absolutely and proportionately, as did the Catholic cohort. And the non-Liturgicals lost virtually
twice as many CAPT’s as the Catholics.

Page 10 of 44

So far, the analysis has shown that:
42.1 The Chaplain Corps, as an institution, administers the SER eligibility rules in
a manner which benefits Catholics and disadvantages non-Liturgicals.
42.2 Once a Chaplain is swept up into the SER eligibility system, the Chaplain
Corps, as an institution, executes the SER implementation in a manner which is less
likely to expose Catholic Officers to repeated SER consideration.

And
42.3 When the SER process has run its course, Catholics suffer smaller cohort
losses than non-Catholics.
43 One might well wonder if these effects are fully attributable to bias in SER exposure, or
repeated exposure, or if something else is also operating here.
44 Could the Chaplain Corps’ declared ( Reference 4) “critical shortage of Catholic Priests”,
which does not in fact exist in the Chaplain Corps, account for any part of how well the Catholics
fared during SER, and if so how much pressure was applied to the non-Liturgicals, instead?
Or,
45 Could it be that some of the difference in the loss rate at CDR vs the loss rate at CAPT may be
explained by the fact that all the CAPT evaluations were undertaken by Admirals, where half of the
CDR evaluations were undertaken by Admirals, and half were in the hands of other Chaplains?
46 If this latter explanation applies, then Chaplains judging other Chaplains distorted the results to
a measured extent (the difference between what happened to CAPT’s and what happened to CDR’s),
and the balance of the bias here can be attributed to (a) the way the Chaplain Corps determined
eligibility, and (b) the way the Admirals responded, with the Chief of Chaplains as the Board
President, to: (i) the alleged shortage of Catholic priests, or mayhaps (ii) “the needs of the Navy in
managing billets with long training pipelines” (Catholics take more time to graduate from seminary).
47 Because the Chaplain Corps chose to use SER boards composed entirely of Chaplains on some
occasions, and on other occasions used SER boards composed largely of line officers (Admirals), we
can look at the outcomes (sometimes dealing with the same candidates) across these two different
configurations.

Chaplains on Selection Boards make Decisions which reflect their own Religious
Preferences.

Clearly, Chaplains approach these decisions differently than Admirals.

51 The differences are statistically significant. It is logically possible, of course, that some of the
difference is due to a change in the target percentages. The Chaplains may have had instructions to
select (out) a higher percentage of the eligibles than the Admirals were required to select - but while
that would alter the absolute percentages forced into retirement, it should not change the relative

pattern.
52 As opposed to Admirals, Chaplains7 were “harder” on Liturgicals than they were on Baptists
and other non-Liturgicals. The difference with respect to the non-Liturgicals is significant at the .10
level; the difference between the rate for Baptists and the rate for Liturgicals is statistically
significant at the .05 level, two standard deviations, (binomial z.)
53 Note, though, that even here the non-Baptist, non-Liturgicals lose half of their Officers when
their careers are in the hands of other Chaplains, and only (sic) a third of their Officers when their
careers are in the hands of mostly non-Chaplains.
54 No matter who sat on the SER Boards, the non-Baptist, non-Liturgicals lost more that “their fair
share” of their Officers – and (see my Compendium, “The Cream Effect”; Reference 6) it should
have been otherwise on purely objective grounds. That is, there is statistical evidence that the
screening process that selects Commanders in the Chaplain Corps, because it is so stringent for nonLiturgicals, selects non-Liturgical Officers who are, on the average, of higher quality than their
Liturgical and Catholic rank peers.
55 This relative preference in the Chaplain membered boards’ outcomes may be due to their
denominational prevalence on the board, note that Baptists had five seats on these four boards; nonLiturgicals (including Baptists) had seven seats. Catholics (who did rather less well than usually,
had only four seats. In promotion boards, where denomination has been shown to influence
decisions (see my Compendium [op.cit.], p 66), the usual pattern (97% of the time) was a majority
White collar on the board; here we had 50% of the boards with 50% Blue collar.
56 The instant case is not proof of the contamination introduced by putting denominations on
selection boards, but it is close. With only four boards, and a statistical sample of just six Catholics
and ten Evangelicals, one can’t prove much out of a 50/50 split.
57 Maybe one or more of this set of four boards were renegade to the traditional, moderately proLiturgical pattern, and instead of adopting that preference, they introduced their own.
58 We can show that the Chaplain membered boards were not respecters of either precedent or
authority.
59

In addition to their choosing an unusually large percentage of Liturgical Chaplains to “drum
7

The differences in the board composition are not as stark as the nomenclature suggests.
In every case but one, the president of the board is a Chaplain, in fact the Chief of Chaplains. In
a board with only four other members, the four line officers on the Admiral staffed boards may
be assumed to have more organizational independence than the subordinate Chaplains on the all
Chaplain boards. The Chief of Chaplain’s vote is important in both compositions, but it might be
relatively more important in the boards composed of subordinate Chaplains.

61 The U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps is not a tiny organization; it has nearly 1000 members, but the
number of Officers at the higher ranks is reasonably small (see Tables 1 & 2); after 20 years on
Active duty it is not unreasonable to assume that most Chaplain Captains know or know of most
Commanders, so a Commander’s career record and experience level may well be known to SER
board members, when those members are Chaplains and may not be known to the board members
when those members are Admirals (only one of whom is a Chaplain.)
62 For Chaplain members or Admiral members, the SEC NAV Instructions are the same – the
board is supposed to retain the Officers with the greatest potential for future service, bearing in mind
the Navy’s primary mission. Each Officer is supposed to be evaluated on the written record.
63 One need not assume that Admirals know more about the Navy than Captains, but such an
assumption would be reasonable. One need not assume that Line Officers would understand the
Navy’s primary mission better than Chaplains, but such an assumption would be reasonable.

64 One needs only to assume that each board member made a good faith effort to review each
Candidate’s record and selected retained those officers with the greatest future potential.
65 Since an officer’s potential may change, especially as the officer gains experience (or ages) or
as he or she gains skills, one need not think of an Officer’s potential future value as a static measure.
And since the judgment within each set of eligibles must be perforce, relative merit, it is always
possible that in a different pool of eligibles an Officer might be let go who had been retained on an
earlier occasion.
66 However, these apologia aside, an officer who has withstood a SER evaluation ought to be
“better” on the average than a new entrant to the pool of eligibles. The new entrant would be, a
priori, average and would have, by the rules of SER eligibility one less year of experience - but not
necessarily one more year of useful career until retirement than the reprised candidate.
67 Therefore, one might expect the percent selected out to decrease as the number of appearances
before SER boards rises. Outstanding officers would continue to be outstanding, and would be
promoted (out of this SER pool).
68 It is not surprising then, that when Admirals judged Chaplain Officers who have been
evaluated by a SER before, and been retained, the retained Officers tended to be retained again. The
Admirals kept more than 90% of the Officers that were exposed to SER more than once.
69 On the other hand, it is surprising that the Chaplains retained on Active Duty, barely two-thirds
of the Officers who has survived earlier SER reviews (see Table 6.)
70

This difference is statistically significant beyond three standard deviations; p < .01.

71 What did the Chaplain members of these SER boards see in these eligible officers which the
earlier judgments missed? Maybe nothing; maybe something outside the written record.
72 If repeated consideration of the same officers before different boards leads to different
decisions, it is the Boards who are unreliable and arbitrary, not the pool of candidates who are erratic
in terms of skill.
73 Table 6 supports the conclusion that the Chaplains who sat on SER boards did not judge on the
basis of the value of each Officer before them. In coming to this conclusion I am NOT substituting
my judgment for theirs; I am using all the other SER boards who judged these Officers as my bench
mark.
Bias within Chaplain Membered Boards
74 The conclusion flows that Chaplains, per se, collectively, do not really vote independently of
their own denomination. They may be trying to be independent, but, as we shall see, the data is

inconsistent with the absence of faith-based bias when Chaplains are calling the shots in SER.
75

One may well wonder what is going on here.

76 It is clear in the data, clear statistically, that these four Chaplain membered boards are
behaving (a) differently than both the Admiral membered boards, and (b) differently than the 73
Chaplain membered promotion boards which I reported on at length in Appendix G of my
Compendium.
First, look at the 1995 CDR SER Board.
77 The 1995 CDR SER board was the first SER board which had Chaplains as board members
instead of Admirals, and it looks as though they “seized the moment.”
78 This board’s decisions have a “vigilante” tone, as though they were bent on correcting some of
the decisions they “inherited” from the Admirals.
79 This board looked at 10 CDR’s who were before their first SER, and it retained nine of them
(i.e., keeping 90%); then it looked at 17 CDR’s who had been “judged” and retained in the service,
by one or two Admiral boards - and this board rejected 7 of them - named them for Involuntary
Retirement (keeping only 59%).
80 Even if the a priori random probability of selecting a Chaplain for involuntary retirement was
the same for (a) a newly arrived on the list Chaplain as it is for (b) a previously retained Chaplain,
this parsing of 1 from 10 and 7 from 17; instead of 3/10 and 5/17 has a one tailed likelihood of .07 on the threshold of statistical significance - a threshold which is crossed if we consider at all that the
previously judged and retained Chaplains are (or were in the opinion of that/those Admiral
membered boards) “better than average.”8
81

This disparity in 1995, when combined with the pattern of decisions from the 1996 board, is

8

In Table 6, the Admiral membered boards had a 22% chance of selecting for SER a
candidate who had not been before a previous SER board, and 9.5% chance of selecting for SER
a candidate who had been evaluated by a previous board – that is a more than 50% decrease in
likelihood. The Chaplains, at their first board, began with a requirement to select for SER 8 out
of 27, or 30%; had the Chaplains simply used that percentage on all candidates they would have
picked three from the de novo group and five from the repeaters; had they adjusted the a priori
30% probability at all, giving the 17 candidates who had all been recommended for retention by
the Admirals, last year, or the year before, a single candidate advantage and let one more of them
than a coin toss selection stay in the service – a 4/10 and 4/17 split is statistically significantly
different from a 1/10 and 7/17 split. The Chaplains did not ignore the Admirals decisions, they
reversed them.

both statistically significant (and statistically indefensible) within the pools before these two boards;
it is also statistically different than the decision patterns of either (a) the other two Chaplain
membered CDR SER boards (1997 and 1998) or (b) the Admiral membered boards (1991 to 1994).
(See Reference 9a.)
Both the 1995 and 1996 Boards ignored their charter and the facts
82 These Chaplain membered boards made decisions which were arbitrary and inconsistent with
the objective facts – as determined by their superiors – the Admirals. See above.
83 Let’s look at how these boards did at making decisions which were consistent with their peers’
view of these same Officer’s potential future value – results from promotion boards.
84 Table 7 highlights the inconsistency between the relative value of the SER candidates when
they were up for promotion (and being evaluated by Chaplains sitting on promotion boards) and the
relative value assigned by the Chaplains sitting on these two (the 1995 and 1996) SER boards.

85 Look at Row 1. These are the 15 eligible Officers which these two SER boards chose to reject.
Clearly, there is no difference in these two columns – and that is the point. These boards made SER
decisions which bore no relationship to the quality judgments made by their peers.
86 If the 1995 and 1996 SER boards were following the rules and “subjecting an officer who had
two or more Failures of Selection to involuntary retirement”, or if their judgments were based on the
same criteria as their peers used in judging future potential in the promotion venue, when these same
candidates were judged in the past, then the data would look like Table 8 (see page 17), which is
statistically significantly different than what happened. (Chi square, three standard deviations, p >
.001.)
87 The conclusion is that in comporting to neither the previous-retention value decisions of the
SER Admirals, nor the previous future-potential decisions of the promotion panels, the FY 1995 and

1996 Chaplain membered SER boards for Commanders made judgments which were obviously
contaminated by something other than a balanced review of the criteria which they were ordered to
use to govern their deliberations.

88 Whether these boards were distracted by retribution or retaliation (against the Admirals, or
against the person of Commander Wilkins), or whether (as an uncommon near majority of nonLiturgicals) they were trying to “get even” with respect to years and years of Catholic and Liturgical
dominance of the system, or whether they were simply too new at the business of sitting on SER
boards to understand what their mission was, it is statistically certain that these two boards did not
make judgments that bore a systematic relationship to any objective criteria.
89 Chaplains such as Wilkins and Ware from the 1995 pool and Adair, Aven, Byrum, Metzger
and Morgan from the 1996 pool, all of whom were judged as promotable by senior officers, and none
of whom were “subject to involuntary separation by reason of having been passed over two or more
times” were abused by the erratic, arbitrary and inept (and contaminated) decisions which these two
boards rendered.
90 We know that in making their decisions the Chaplains on the 1995 and 1996 SER Boards
considered something other than (a) the letter of the SECNAV’s instructions and (b) only the written
record in front of them. Among the other things which they might have considered is (a) their own
knowledge of each candidate’s “reputation”, and (b) the conformance between their own
denomination vis a vis the denomination of the candidates before them. One might assume that the
1995 board was influenced by CDR Wilkins’ litigation, and that both boards were vulnerable to what
I have called “like, likes, like”.
91

I find that it is possible to tease an answer to this question out of the data we have.

SER Board decisions are influenced by the Board members’ Denominations

92 Here is the proof, for Chaplain membered SER boards, that the denomination of the board
members interacts with the denomination of the candidates – to the detriment of the candidates who
are not fortunate enough to have a denominational match on the board.
93 At least as far back as the thirteenth century (McLean, Reference 8) mathematicians have
pondered how to merge, combine, or integrate rank order assessments from several judges. It is easy
to examine alternative summation schemes and deduce some logical bounds on what rule-complying
judges or panel members may decide. For example: if one candidate within the pool is objectively
ranked first on every dimension of quality that the judges are permitted to consider, then no matter
how the different dimensions of quality are weighed by the different board members, that candidate
has to be the group’s first choice.
94 Similarly, if there is in the pool of candidates a pair, say A and B, and if A ranks higher than B
on every dimension of quality that may be considered, then no matter how each board member
weighs the various dimensions, even ignoring some of them, in the Board’s final ranking of all the
candidates, B has to be rated below A.
95 Without treading into the deliberations of a SER board’s review, without trying to second
guess or predict what the Board should decide, it is possible to put some logical bounds on what
arithmetic will let them decide if they obey these two essential rules: (1) Consider only the criteria
which are specified, and (2) Weigh each candidate’s record impartially. If the board members obey
those two rules then the general rule of rank order bounds applies:
The rule is that it is generally impossible (i.e., inconsistent and contrary
to logic) for the selection board to rate any candidate in sum in a position
that is lower than the lowest position (Rmax) which that candidate held
on any underlying dimension.
96 In Table 9 (on the following page) I have provided a carefully formatted summary of the public
record for the first (1995) panel of Chaplains who sat to select CDR’s for involuntary retirement.
97

The rows in this table are the candidates before this board.

98

The central columns in the table [from (2) to (7)] are criteria which the board could consider.

99 The entries in the cells of those columns are not measurements on the criteria, but are instead
each candidate’s relative rank order on the criterion listed in that column (with ties posted at the top
of the range.)
100 Columns (8) and (9) post alternative stand-ins for Rmax.

101 In Column (8) I have entered the highest rank order (lowest perceived value) that each
candidate achieved over all the dimensions listed. Since “everybody” was lowest on something (and
thus Rmax did not differentiate),
102 In Column (9) I posted the highest rank order achieved on all the dimensions except:
•

102.1 Valor (because Chaplains, as non-combatants, might not be judged on valor)
and

•

102.2 Faith (because although correlated to success in the Chaplain Corps,
denomination is not “supposed” to be relevant in selection).

103 Column (10) posts the rank assigned to the candidate by the 1995 SER board; and
104 Column (11) notes instances of a potential “inconsistency” between the board’s collective
decision and Rmax.
105 There could be an argument here about whether my listing and ranking of the criteria the
Secretary of the Navy directed the board to consider is accurate or complete.
106 As we shall see, any such complaint is a red herring. What will unfold here is a mathematical
model of how the board makes it decisions. The board undoubtedly does not keep little running
sums:

3 J i (W i,j*C j,k)

Where J refers to Judge “i”
Wi,j refers to the Weight Judge i applies to dimension j
Ci,j refers to the Rank Candidate k has on dimension j,

but it is useful to conceive of the problem as a linear regression. [Much as a race track tout would
read a racing form and mentally tick: gate, track condition, jockey weight, horse’s time in the last
three meets, etc, and then “add it all up” and compare it to all the other horses in the race, we may
think of the challenge facing the SER board members in this paradigm.]
107 The SER board members do whatever they do, and arrive at a conclusion. If they were told, as
they were in 1995, to select eight candidates out of 27 to get rid of, keeping the best, then we know at
least that the candidates selected out were judged lower (ranked higher) than position 19.
108 The construct here is that: Although board members may not consciously use little linear
regression formulae to give a score for each candidate, whatever they do, it can be modeled as an
integration of weighted assessments of performance or value on a fixed, common set of dimensions
of quality. It is true (a) that the general rank order theorem is generally true (perhaps because of
internal correlations between measures on various dimensions of quality), but it is also true (b) that
one can construct “curiosities” or inversions, where the general rule does not work. The conclusion
one should draw from this observation is not that the general rule is limited in its usefulness, but that
if the general rule is violated in any particular evaluation, that violation needs to be explained, one
way or another.
109 The contention here is that: Whether one accepts Table 9’s dimensions, valences, and ranks
or not, the structure of the table informs our view and circumscribes the board’s permissible decision
space. Any selection panel decision which violates the general bound constraints is likely to have

violated one or more of the conditions governing its deliberations. (Either one or more board
members introduced an extraneous variable, or they weighed the objective record inconsistently
across the candidates.)
110 In the selection board results illustrated in this table, the board failed its responsibility!
111 This selection board went outside the rules to select Commanders Wilkins and Ware. The
general bound rule applied to the rankings in Table 9 shows that the decisions to retire Wilkins and
Ware could not have been arrived at with any set of consistently applied weights.
112 There must have been something else operating beyond this table (and outside the written
record on the board’s conference table) which explains these decisions.
113 The point demonstrated here is NOT that the board did something “wrong”; the point is that
the general bound rule identifies these particular decisions as needing something else to explain
them. Let’s explore what this “something else” might be.
114 Table 10 shows what I found after assembling a data base with (a) status (Chaplain or
Admiral) for every member of every SER board, (b) denominational data for every chaplain who
served on every SER Board, (c) objective data (date of birth, failure of selection on the way to CDR
or when considered for CAPT, years of experience, years until age 62, prior SER exposure, and
denomination9) for every candidate before every SER board, and (d) each SER board’s decisions.

* ??? Denotes a suspicious decision, i.e., a decision identified by the Rmax theorem, which suggests that for the affected
candidate, the board either judged the criteria inconsistently or introduced an extraneous variable. As we shall see, there
is strong evidence that these decisions were contaminated by the board members’ denominations. [The “Total, Average,
and standard deviation” columns in this table are based on all the Officers who were SERB’d, i.e., selected for
Involuntary Retirement, not just, and not without, the selections identified as questionable.]

115 I compared each candidate’s RmaxDelta (the difference between Rmax and the threshold10
rank for selection by that SER board) for candidates with a denominational match on their SER
board to the RmaxDelta for candidates who did not have a denominational match on the SER board
which evaluated them.
116 There is no importance to be attached to the difference between the SER selection rates for
CDR’s by Admirals versus those for CDR’s by Chaplains; (13/87 = 15 percent versus 28/109 = 25
percent.) Although the Chaplains chose twice as many CDR candidates for involuntary retirement as
did the Admirals, the number of candidates to be chosen was not set by the SER boards, but was, in
every case, part of the specific instructions to them.
117 The difference in the proportion of questionable decisions between the Admirals and the
Chaplains (4/45 = 9 percent versus 7/28 =25 percent) does not rise to the level of statistical
significance (perhaps because the numbers are so small), but it is meaningful.
118 It is meaningful because any questionable decision is interesting; but it is also meaningful
because the Chaplains were four times as likely to reach outside the rules as the Admirals.
(The Admirals had four curious decisions with 254 candidates [1.6%]; the chaplains had seven
questionable decisions with 109 candidates [6.4%].)
119 Within the Chaplain decisions, the probability of being selected for involuntary retirement
seems not to have been influenced by whether the candidate chosen did or did not share a
denomination with some member of the Board (21/80 = 26 percent versus 7/29 = 24 percent). It
would be speculation to argue that this is because the Chaplain membered boards were trying to keep
their faith-group numbers politically correct, but the data (and an argument about specious
consistency) could be used to support such an hypothesis by anyone who harbored that view.
120 The important finding here, the shocker, is that all of the Chaplains’ questionable decisions
(those marked “???”) occurred in cases where there was no denominational match on the board –
where, in effect, there was no one to stand up for the candidate. The sample size is small (just seven
10

The “threshold” rank is the largest integer which can be assigned to a candidate’s
performance without forcing him into Involuntary Retirement. In this case, under the rule of
“ties posted at the maximum”, all the retained candidates are ranked “19", and all the candidates
forced into retirement are ranked “27". The threshold is 19. Higher than that is retired.

cases), but even so, with a one tailed binomial test this is still statistically significant at the level of
two standard deviations (p<.01).
121

Moreover, when one calculates the average RmaxDelta, and then tests the average
RmaxDelta for (i) the candidates who had a denominational match versus the average
RmaxDelta for (ii) candidates who did not have a denominational match on the board, the
result is that the two samples differ by nearly four standard deviations; this is statistically
significant at p < .0001. (Student’s t, Dawis,1987 Reference 11.)

122 Having a denominational match on the SER board “protected” a candidate at the “margin”.
123 No questionable-decision-candidate had a matching denomination on the board!
124 When a candidate with a denomination match was at the margin, or even just below it, the
denominations present on the Board switched to an "other" (someone not like themselves) and chose
to retain their own kind.
125 The candidates who were selected for forced retirement and had a denominational match were,
on the average, five ranks over threshold. The candidates who were selected for forced retirement,
but did not have a denominational match were, on the average, two ranks over threshold.
126 Thus, having a matching denomination on the SER board was, on the average, worth three
steps (rank orders) away from being selected.
127 The analysis here demonstrates that the denominational mix on chaplain membered SER
boards influences the decisions of those boards, (four standard deviations; p <.0001.)
This is a result which was invisible to Defendants’ analytic approaches.
128 Parsing the SER board on denomination, and then applying the Rmax general bound rule to a
mathematical model of the SER board’s decisions, illuminated the religious component of these
decisions. We do not have to argue that the Rmax model is a high fidelity representation of what the
SER board actually considered. All that we have to point out is it is a rational, objective, repeatable
calculation and when tested it shows there are denomination-based departures from chance evident in
the SER board decision made by Chaplains!
129 We have demonstrated earlier (here) that Chaplains sitting on SER boards do not make
decisions “like” Admirals make when sitting on SER boards. The Chaplain community may well
have nearly 900 members, but it does not have 900 Commanders.
130 It is likely that Chaplains sitting on selection boards (whether SER boards, promotion boards
or continuation in service boards) will know, or know of, many of the individual candidates before
them. The evidence here is that Chaplains sitting on boards allow, or are unable to avoid allowing,

factors outside the written record to influence their decisions. Among the “ex parte” facts which
may come into play are the board member’s own denomination and the candidate’s “reputation”.
131 I would expect Interviews with SER board members to further illuminate this issue.

Summary
132 The Navy’s “statistical analysis” of SER data is incomplete, misleading, unreliable and
counter-productive. It is contradicted by the facts (when analyzed with proper statistical methods)
and it deserves no credence.
133 The U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps personnel selection board system (including all Chaplain
membered boards - Accession, Promotion, CADRAG and SER) is corrupted through and through
with denomination-based religious-bias. Every aspect of personnel management which can be
subjected to statistical analysis shows (a) religion-based bias, (b) subtle and not so subtle preference
for Catholics, and (c) institutional disaffection for what could be broadly called “evangelicals and
charismatics”.
134 The evangelical and charismatic beliefs and worship content (or style) may not be what some
Christians think of as suitably traditional, but aren’t their religious expressions Constitutionally
protected?

CERTIFICATION
135 I certify under the penalties of perjury that: (a) this is my work, (b) I am competent to analyze
this data, and (c) the conclusions represented here are both (i) independently arrived at and (ii) true,
complete, accurate and scientifically certain to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Endnote:

Faith Group Cluster as a Proximal Cause of Denominational Bias in the
U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps
136 The following text and figure were originally published in my September 2006 Withdrawal
Declaration, correcting my error in understanding what an accession was, and cataloguing the
Defendants’ Expert’s errors and misrepresentations in Larsen.
137 The purpose of that material (Appendix FG in that Declaration) was to demonstrate the
mischief that flows from the Chaplain Corps use of their faith group cluster system.
138 The Navy’s faith group cluster system (see Figure 1) is based upon stereotypes of what “other”
religions must be like, from a Roman Catholic perspective.
139 Thus, the first “cluster” is set aside for Roman Catholic; no other denomination is included.
No other denomination is managed as it own cluster. All the 200 other denominations are clumped
into three alternatives to Catholic: Liturgical, Protestant and Other.
140 The second “cluster” is most (but not all) of the denominations which sprang out of the
Protestant Reformation, or still have an historic connection to that source. The denominations (as
diverse, and mutually conflicted as they are) include the American Anglican Catholic Church,
Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Cumberland Presbyterians, Reformed Presbyterians, Presbyterian
Church of the USA, Korean Presbyterian, Presbyterian Church of America, Bible Presbyterian
Church, Orthodox Presbyterian, African Methodist Episcopal Zion, Charismatic Episcopal, etc, but
not the Reformed Church of America, or the American Orthodox Church, or the Congregational
Church. Further, the “Liturgical” cluster includes some denominations who think of themselves as
non-Liturgical, e.g., the Church of the Nazarene and the Moravians. I recite this partial litany to
make two points:
•

140.1 First, the variety of denominations lumped into the first non-Catholic cluster
is diverse, and includes sects which have almost as many, or at least as fervently felt a
set of, differences between their “spin offs” as they may have with the Catholics.

•

140.2 Second, the careless manner in which, even a few denominations, are
misassigned demonstrates an Official (institutional) lack of sensitivity to the belief
structures of denominations other than Catholic.

141 This singling out of Catholic for its own cluster, careless sorting of denominations across self
reported distinctions, and co-clustering of individual denominations which have separated from each
other over differences profound enough to cause a schism - demonstrates a singular disregard for any
denominational differences among Others.
142 In the Navy Chaplain Corps faith group cluster system, Catholic is the focus, and everybody
else is an afterthought.

APPENDIX FG
Faith Group Categories
(and the humbug11 they cause)
FG1 This Appendix is the first part of a two part expose of the Faith Group Category humbug*.
FG2 In Part I Logic will show
•

FG2.1 The faith group category system is not necessary.
It is defended as “necessary” so that chaplains from different faith group categories or
different clusters of denominations and groups12 may be assigned to different (somehow
uniquely relevant) posts where they are to serve “personnel’s religious needs, irregardless of
religious views.13” That practice is both unnecessary and patently self-contradictory.

•

FG2.2 The faith group category system is Roman Cathocentric.
There is one “cluster” for Roman Catholics alone, and all other Catholics and all other
denominations are “grouped” into categories or clusters based, not on their common beliefs
and practices (which are often fractious and volatile within “cluster”), but on the basis of how
far removed the so-called category is from Roman Catholic beliefs. This devalues, in some
proportion or other, every other denomination on the face of the earth.

11

* I chose the word “humbug” carefully; it is not as strident as “hoax” and it allows for
an interpretation of both gentle good will, and a backfired practical joke. Whatever the
motivation when it was set up, the Navy’s faith group category (or faith group cluster) system has
harmed the Navy and the Chaplains who serve it, regardless of their so-called “Category.”
12

I am informed that although neither “denomination” nor “faith group” are terms of art
in normal parlance, one and not the other is a pitfall when speaking of or to what some of the
uninitiated (myself included) might otherwise call a “denomination”. Some entities, endorsers,
believers, dislike the name “denomination”. I won’t try to explain why, or get into this any
further, but it does highlight (as though the situation needed attention) that individual faith is
very important to the affected parties. Meaning no offense to the populations of believers,
however they are subdivided, and whatever they call themselves, and with no malice toward the
Navy, I shall try to discuss so-called “faith group categories”, or “faith group clusters” as an
administrative construct, and will continue to refer (imprecisely, ineloquently, and only in the
service of communication in this venue) to the elements of those clusters as denominations (with
a lower case “d”.)
13

Yes, I strung these words together, but they are in the same sequence and syntax as in
the original, Navy pleading in Case 1:99cv-02945-RMU-JMF Document 231; August 11, 2006.

FG2.3 The faith group category system empowers or facilitates the expression of intradenominational and inter-denominational prejudice within Categories.

FG3 Because the Chaplain Corps is alert to the possibility of religious discrimination, the Navy
monitors personnel selection-board performance in terms of faith group cluster (faith group category)
results14, on the basis of faith group category. That means that any discrimination or prejudice which
may take place within the boundaries of a cluster or category is “underneath the radar”.
FG4

In Part two (See Appendix QE) data analysis will show:

•

FG4.1 The Quota system, however well intentioned, has been too coarse a tool.
FG4.1.1 If one had a legitimate business reason for needing 25 Catholic Chaplains for
every 5000 sailors or if one had a legitimate business reason for asserting that exactly 22 of
every 100 new Chaplains had to be a Catholic, one could not justify “lumping” all the
remaining requirements into amorphous, internally conflicted, non-Catholic “categories”.
The result would be (and is), (a) a forced culling of applicants to fit under predesignated
limits, and (b) competition within cluster or category for limited opportunities to serve.

And, again:
•

FG4.2 The faith group category system has empowered or facilitated the expression of
intra-denominational and inter-denominational prejudice within the co-called Faith Group
Categories.

PART I - logic
Issue One - the logical case for/against management by faith group category.
FG5 Articulated in a variety of carefully worded ways, the Navy says that it needs to manage by
faith group category, because the religious needs of its personnel come in a “variety of flavors” and if
the Navy is to fulfill its obligation to them (the served population), then the Chaplain Corps needs to
be able to dispatch, distribute, make available, an appropriate mix of RMP’s (Religious Ministry
Professionals).
FG6

Mr Hyde has put it this way:

14

For proof that the Navy monitors in fgc terms, see the fgc summary tallies on the
Reports of individual Promotion Boards and the on the C/A/R/E work Sheets which the Navy has
Produced in this series of litigations.

“The Navy has a strong, compelling interest in maintaining a broad mix of chaplains from
each faith group category at all ranks, so that chaplains from each faith group category may
be properly detailed throughout the Navy’s nearly 500 duty stations to meet personnel’s
religious needs.” p. 3, ref 12.
FG7 Of course the Navy wants to provide “chaplain services” to its personnel, but why are those
services related to “faith group category”?
FG8

Mr Hyde answers that in this way:
“Thus, the assignment of Roman Catholics to a different faith group, and the assignment of
[all] Non-liturgical Protestant chaplains to the same faith group is based upon the judgment
that chaplains within the same faith group category can generally meet the needs of personnel
encompassed by that category and can be managed, utilized and deployed in similar fashion.”
last sentence, p. 5, ref. 12.

FG9 Thus, it is the Navy’s judgment (I do not think Mr. Hyde is arrogant enough to be saying this
on his own), it is the Navy’s judgment that the purpose of the faith groups is to facilitate matching a
chaplain flavor to a duty station need.
FG10 Again:
“Further, the faith group categories reflect a logistical tool used by the Navy to utilize,
deploy, and manage the limited resources of the Chaplain Corps ...”
p.1, ref. 12.
FG11 And:
“Because the differences in the manner in which each faith group category is managed, ...”
p1, ref 12.
FG12 And finally:
“Utilization of faith group categories leads to differences in the manner in which chaplains
from each faith group category are managed, utilized and deployed, irrespective of the
differences between respective chaplains’ religious views”.
p. 4, ref 12.
FG13 As a person who trades on inference, this series of assertions strikes me as circular on the
one hand, and self contradictory on the other.
FG14 First, the Navy is saying that it needs different faith group clusters because it deploys them
differently, and then, because it deploys them differently, it needs them.

FG15 Second, the Navy is saying that it deploys Chaplains and uses them “irrespective of religious
views”, but it assigns them to faith group clusters or categories, based on religious views.
FG16 Maybe the Navy needs a variety of Chaplains to serve the variety of religious views among
its service personnel, but their logic doesn’t prove that they need THIS taxonomy of faith groups.
FG17 Furthermore, (a) the judgment behind the faith-group clustering is not borne out by
denominational realities, and (b) it is overtaken by the Chaplains’ oath (if not the Chaplains
“motto”.)
•

FG17.1 Chaplains from the Roman Catholic cluster (sic) can surely serve service personnel
who are Catholic.
FG17.1.1 Can they also serve: Episcopals? Methodists? Apostolic Catholics? Greek
Orthodox?
FG17.1.2 We do not need to exhaust the list, nor fill in the details to know that the answer
is: “Yes”, and “sometimes”, and “it depends”, and “under extreme conditions”
and “only over my dead body.”]

•

FG17.2 Chaplains from the Liturgical Cluster can surely serve service personnel who are what?
FG17.2.1 Can any Episcopal serve any Methodist or Church of Christ or Presbyterian?
FG17.2.2 The answer runs across the same range as above, for Catholics, but it distributes
differently; there are Episcopalian Clergy who will (and those who will not)
serve with female clergy who are also Episcopal, and the new data the Navy just
gave me shows that there are now a growing number of Charismatic Episcopals;
the Presbyterians have already divided into the Presbyterian Church of America
and the Presbyterian Church of the USA; there are splinters and factions
throughout the “Liturgical Community”. Mispeak, the Liturgical community is
not a “community” in the same sense that the Liturgical Faith group Category is
not a “Category”. It is a bag full, with no cohesion; they are simply placed in the
same “bag.” The cohesion is imagined; there are factions and frictions within
what outsiders see as the “same” denomination. Yes, there are frictions between
Catholics and Protestants (the “Irish Troubles”.) But there are also frictions
between Muslims and Jews, and they “belong” to the same faith group category.
We do not need to reach across so-called faith group categories to be reminded
that some of man’s most bitter religious conflicts are between virtual kin, cf the
situation in Iraq vis a vis Shia vs Sunni, both of whom the Navy’s faith group
cluster system co-locates in “Special Worship”, and manages as generic muslim.

FG18 The “judgment” that the “Religious Ministry Professionals” from a given cluster are
“better” at serving the members of their (sic) category (sic) is either:
FG18.1

(a) a fiction which can be held only by an outsider who sees all “other” religions as
equal, or it is

FG18.2

(b) belied by an oath-based accommodation which is TRUE regardless of whether the
served party belongs to my “Category” or some other one.

FG19 Except perhaps for Roman Catholics15, it seems that either it does not matter which faith
group cluster you belong to:

•

FG19.1 conflict with other denominations in “your” cluster is nearly as inevitable as
conflict with denominations in other clusters, if not more so16, or

•

FG19.2 the ability to provide Chaplain support, undertaken in the oath, is straightforward
with respect to denominations different than your own, whether those denominations are
designated, not joined, “members” of “your” Faith Group Category or whether they are just,
coincidentally, “members” of some other Faith Group Category.

FG20 I know that the language there is more convoluted than the logic. (I would not want to have
to diagram that sentence.) Here is the point:
FG21 If you are a Chaplain, and you are not a Roman Catholic, then it does not matter to you
(even if it does matter to the Chaplain Corps) whether you are in a post where most of the service
personnel you have to service are or are not your denomination, whether they are simply not your socalled “faith group category”, or in it with you, but not “of” your particular denomination. Your faith
group category is the “irregardless” in terms of your ability to serve.
FG22

If you need help with an Orthodox wedding, or a Bris, you know where to get help.

Otherwise, you do what you have sworn to do:

pluralistic environment and to support, both directly and indirectly, the free exercise
of religion by all members of the Naval service, their family members, and other
persons authorized to be served by the chaplaincy” [OPNAVINST 1120.9, Ref 21,
emphasis added.]

FG24 Or, as the Chaplain Corps motto has it: “Provide for your own, facilitate for others, care for
all”.17
FG25 And, [see (b) above] thus, the differentiation implied in the judgment that says the Navy
needs (these) different faith group clusters is inconsistent with the oath the Navy requires every
Chaplain to affirm before undertaking Service.
FG26 Either (a) any Chaplain can provide ministry (facilitate) with respect to any service
personnel’s needs, or (b) that chaplain has violated his oath of office.
FG27 There are no other logical options.

Issue Two - the argument that the Navy’s faith group category system is Roman Cathocentric.

FG28 First, a note to Mr. Hyde and Mr. Hall: No, I am not about to represent myself as an “expert”
on comparative religion. On that score I know no more than is encompassed by a “reasonable man”
standard. But I am an expert on Taxonomy. (I was the senior scientist, a vice president, at the
Smithsonian Institution, for what was then the largest scientific data base in the world. We
“indexed” all the research projects in the world which used U.S. funds.) Taxonomy is a fancy word
for classification, and classification and coding are fundamental, if mundane and under-rated, tools
used by statisticians (among others.) There are rules for taxonomies; even Dr. Bernard Siskin knows
this; he describes some rules for data classification in his books on elementary statistics.]
FG29 Second, let’s begin with a look at the “Faith Group Cluster” cosmos, as the USN Chaplain
Corps defines it. [My drawing here (Figure 1) does not prove anything, it simply illustrates where we
are going:]

17

The “official” version of this motto incorporates the “faith group category” concept
into the motto: “We provide for those of our own faith group, we facilitate ministry for those of
other faith groups, and we care for all”. I took the quote in the text here from a press story about
a Unitarian/Universalist Chaplain.

Page 35 of 44

FG30 For now, this drawing merely illustrates what I mean by Roman Cathocentric18.
FG31 What follows is the proof for the drawing (Figure 1.):
FG32 The Navy separates all “denominations” into four so-called clusters or categories:
•
•
•
•

Roman Catholic
Liturgical Protestant
Non-Liturgical Protestant, and
Special Worship Group

FG33 Roman Catholics (and only Roman19 Catholics) are “grouped” (sic) assigned to Category 1.
All other denominations are spread into one of three other “Categories”, which are distinguished
from each other in terms of how different their fundamental polity is from Roman Catholic.
FG34 Thus, the denominations which grew out of the “Protestant reformation” are called
“Liturgical”; the denominations which grew out of “individual responsibility” vs faith through an
intermediary are called Protestant-Non-Liturgical, and all the other denominations (or endorsers),
notably including the Orthodox who are both “close” historically to Catholic and parties to the Great
Schism, all these others are lumped into the most distant Category: “Special Worship Group”.

18

“Cathocentric” signifies that Roman Catholic is the signal center of the Navy’s
classification system. It would not “matter” how the Navy classified denominations but for (a)
putting “Roman Catholic” at the center (and if that is not ceded, then putting Roman Catholic in
its own single- denomination “group”, and providing that distinction for no other denomination,
elevates Roman Catholicism to a separate plateau of recognition and distinction and signifies to
both Roman Catholics and all other denominations, that in the Navy, “Roman Catholics have
special status.” In addition, how the Navy classifies denominations into “faith group categories”
matters because the Navy manages the categories differently. Assignments, duty stations,
participation as members of selection boards, and accession quotas are all admitted to be based
on faith group category. Statistical analysis demonstrates that promotions, separations, medical
benefit retirement, recruitment past age 40, continuance in Service past age 62, student support,
and sufferance with respect to continuance in service after FOS are all demonstrably different for
different faith group categories - and more importantly, the Navy’s monitoring of those actions
by faith group category alone permits different treatment for different denominations within each
faith group category.
19

There are other Catholics: e.g., Reformed Catholics, Apostolic Catholics, Old Holy
Catholic Church, etc. listed in the Navy’s data base of denominations (See Appendix DL - FG
codes). None of these other Catholics are assigned to the “Roman Catholic” faith group cluster;
they are all distributed to Special Worship or Liturgical. [And only one of them was assigned to
Active Duty. That practice is both practically and statistically significant.]

FG34.1 The denominations which were either the first to split from Catholicism, or which
were never part of the “Christian” system - are placed as far distant from Category One as
possible, in “Other”, Category four, which was initially Jews, the Orthodox and the Latter
Day Saints, but which has evolved to include the Reformed Jews, and the Reformed Latter
Day Saints, and a host of “special” denominations/faiths/endorsers - Muslim, Jehovah’s
Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, Christian Science, Unitarian, Buddhist, and lately the
“Orthodox Catholic: and the “Old Holy Catholic Church” (see Data Set FG).

•

FG34.2 Denominations which had their origins in the second split with Roman
Catholicism, are placed closest to Roman Catholic, in Category two. These are the
Episcopalians (and the Charismatic Episcopalians), the Lutherans (and the Evangelical
Lutherans) together with the Presbyterians (in half a dozen varieties), the United Church of
Christ, the Methodists and the Methodist Episcopal’s, as well as the Congregational’s (oops,
the Navy puts the Congregational’s in with the Non-Liturgicals and the Nazarenes in with the
Liturgicals), etc. All these non-Catholics are part of the Liturgical Protestant Category.

•

FG34.3 All the other denominations (or Endorsers), from Baptist to Pentacostal, from
Assembly of God to Christian Missionary Alliance, and from the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel
Churches to the New Life Christian Fellowship; all these are lumped together into “NonLiturgical, Protestant”, in Category three.

Summary:
FG35 There is one “cluster” (sic) for Roman Catholics; everybody else is one of three “categories”
which (a) are defined in terms of difference from Roman Catholic, and which (b) are not internally
cohesive.
FG36 That demonstrates “Roman Cathocentricity.”
FG37 The Navy’s faith group category system, characterizes all “other” denominations in terms of
Roman Catholic theology and practice.
FG38 The “category” or “cluster” system ignores differences which are more important to many
other people than life and death (since they deal with everlasting life and eternal damnation,
extending even unto the third generation). Denomination matters to the Navy only if your
denomination is Roman Catholic. If you believe something else, then here’s a one of three sizes fits
all solution.

The Navy’s faith group Categories are not “Religion” neutral.

FG39 The Navy begins its latest defense (Reference 12, page 1, ¶ 1, sentence 1) with:
“Religion is not, and has not been, a proper consideration permitted by the Navy in
determining a chaplain’s merit for promotion or selective early retirement (SER).”
FG40 Without being too pedantic, I note that this is either (or perhaps all):
FG40.1 a backhanded admission that Religion has been an improper consideration
permitted (at least as in “suffered and endured”) in determining a chaplain’s merit ....; or
FG40.2 a diversionary statement, thought to be true, but leaving out that Religion, while
not a dimension in judging merit, is a dimension in judging eligibility (based on quotas) – as
here, in protecting Catholics from eligibility for SER; or maybe this is
FG40.3 an incomplete statement, in that Religion is permitted to operate as a dimension of
distinction, if not one of merit in other decisions of Chaplain Corps personnel management,
e.g., accessions, duty assignments, service on selection boards; etc.
FG41 If we exercise just a tiny bit of semantic discipline here, we can see that “religion” is an
umbrella word, sometimes equated with faith group cluster, and not isomorphic to denomination.
FG42 If we follow the Navy’s lead and discourse about faith group categories, we might argue that
denominational distinctions do not matter to the Navy Chaplain Corps.
FG43 One would/could base that conclusion on the fact that the Navy insists on “managing by
(their) faith group Categories” and they hardly ever mention “denominations”. [I do not think that
this muteness is because they are concerned about the sensitivities of, e.g., the Christian Scientists,
who might take umbrage at being referred to as a “Denomination”, nor is the Navy’s “stick in your
eye” remark that CFGC is an Endorser and not a Denomination, a counter example.]
FG44 Close reflection on the irrelevance-or-unimportance-of-denomination- premise (and
examination of the faith group categories themselves [See Appendix DL - Data Set FG.]) reveals:
FG45 The Navy Chaplain Corps is in fact unconcerned about denominational differences – except
for the Roman Catholic denomination.
FG46 Roman Catholics are the only denomination given their own faith group cluster (sic).
FG47 That, again, is a demonstration of Roman Cathocentricity.

Issue Three - the faith group category system facilitates denominational prejudice.
FG48 Because the Navy Chaplain Corps is explicitly focused on faith group categories, and is
implicitly unconcerned with denominational distinctions, they express quotas (when they have
them), counts (when they publish them) and EEO type monitoring (when they take their own
performance measures for some personnel actions) in faith group cluster terms.
FG49 This has at least three distorting effects.
FG50 First, the Navy’s public emphasis on category and de-emphasis on denomination surely
supports (and may be intended to support) the impression that “we are all in this boat together”.
“Our differences are not nearly as important as our mission.” But it also sends the signal, that YOUR
differences are not as important as my classification system.
FG51 Second, as a practical matter, not collecting data by denomination makes personnel
management decision information based on denomination invisible. That invisibility (a) deprives the
Navy of a management tool, and (b) limits (or is used in an attempt to limit) discovery in this
litigation, and (c) it permits denominational preferences to be expressed by those who are being
monitored for “religious bias”, but only being monitored with respect to faith group bias, to express
their preferences within the context of faith group. Baptists do “better” than non-Baptists (even
though, or because?, they are in the same cluster); PUSA does better than PCA (even though, or
because?, they are in the same cluster), and so forth: Presbyterians and Episcopals do better than
Methodists. And, of course, Catholics do much better than everybody else (because there is nobody
else in their cluster with whom they have to compete?)
FG52 Third, focus on faith group categories provides a shield or shelter, or “excuse” for
denominational preferences to be expressed by the Navy itself in assigning Chaplains to personnel
selection boards.
FG53 The Navy may say they are even handed, insofar as possible, in assuring that all the faith
group clusters are represented on the various personnel selection boards, but in the way the Navy
does this, the representation by faith group cluster in neither denominationally balanced (on average)
nor randomly assigned.
FG54 Preferred denominations within faith group categories are given the vast majority of the
available seats, and most denominations, most of the denominations which represent many
chaplains, are never given an opportunity to serve.
FG55 “Yes”, the Navy may say, but Board Members are entitled to the presumption of regularity
and I may not assume that just because there is a disparate balance of denominations there will be a
disparate balance in the selections made by those denominations. I do not make that assumption, but
I do test it. The Navy fails the test. (See Appendix LL.)

FG56 However, my focus in this section of this appendix has not been on the fact of
denominational preference, it has been on the fact that the faith group category system facilitates
denominational preference and all of the above is an explanation of how that happens.
FG57 This facilitation is systemic. It flows from the focus on faith group categories. Some of the
discrimination which we will see in Part II could not happen if the faith group categories were not
used.
FG58 Without faith group categories providing “cover”,
•

FG58.1 the Navy would know what these data show, on a denomination by denomination
basis how biased their personnel management system has become, and

•

FG58.2 the affected Chaplains would not be both (a) discriminated against and (b)
unawares of how grossly they have been treated.

FG59 The Table below illustrates what I mean by denomination-by-denomination bias.
FG60 My decision to use non-Roman Catholic as one of my examples here is motivated by my
curiosity about what happens to the Catholics who are not allowed into the Navy’s Roman Catholic
cluster; my decision to use CFGC as the other example here is motivated, of course, by the fact that
they are the complaining “denomination” in this litigation.
FG61 Although this Appendix is not a data analysis appendix, and I have already presented some
analyses above and will present more below, this is an opportune place to illustrate what I mean by
denominational differences in the data are being concealed (obscured) by the Navy’s insistence on
presenting everything in “Faith Group Category” terms:

The Siskin Conjecture:
The Pattern of Denominations Assigned to U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps Selection Boards
Biases the Decisions which Flow from those Boards
An Expert Witness Declaration by: Harald R. Leuba, Ph.D.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1746, and under the penalty of perjury, I declare as follows:
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Old data, recently acquired from the Navy;
a FOIA response discovered in an attorney’s files; and
an unintentional conjecture from Dr. Siskin:
enable a broad understanding of how the Navy Chaplain Corps’ personnel management system
institutionalizes preference for Catholics, and limits opportunity for career growth and service for
a disenfranchised group of shunned denominations, predominantly Non-Baptist, Non-Liturgicals.
The “old data” is records for nearly 5,000 “accession” decisions about chaplain candidates and
Chaplains; this volume of data is so extensive (covering an estimated 97% of all Chaplain Corps
applicants for the past 20 years) that it enables dispositive statistical analysis:
C

The Navy has a statistically significant preference for Catholic Chaplains, over all other
denominations - for participation in the Chaplain Candidate Program (accession), for
assignment to Active Duty Service (misnomered as “accession”), for retention against
involuntary reduction (whether in Selective Early Retirement or in Continuation in
Service), and for promotion.

The FOIA response is the first data from the Navy that provides a window on what happens to a
Chaplain’s career prior to consideration for promotion.
•

CADRAG Boards systematically screened journeyman Chaplains who volunteered for
continuation in service, accepting virtually all the Catholic Chaplains, but rejecting a
Leuba Declaration - the Siskin Conjecture, page 1

Exhibit 7

Page 2 of 60

statistically significant proportion of the Non-Baptist, Non-Liturgical Chaplains. [This is
“What happened to all the Non-Liturgicals”.]
The Siskin Conjecture posits that a correlation exists between the likelihood of a denomination
being assigned to a selection board, and the likelihood that candidates from that denomination
will fare better than average before the board.
Statistical analysis of nearly 2000 Navy selection-board assignments demonstrates a statistically
significant pattern of denominational preference; five out of more than 120 denominations
account for a majority of the seats on all boards.
•

Dr. Bernard Siskin is right, on this point: this de jure preference for some denominations
cascades through the boards’ decisions and alters the mix of denominations who are
accessioned, those who are given an opportunity to serve on Active Duty, those who are
allowed to continue to serve once involved, and those who are promoted when their
“turns” come.

INTRODUCTION
1. Dr. Bernard Siskin and I have been exchanging opinions, reservations and low grade
accusations in the “Chaplains’ Matter” for nearly six years.
2. Recently I was provided with data he has had for nearly a year;
(a)

This new (old) data improves illumination on the terrain we have been disputing,

(b)

A conjecture of his has provided a testable hypothesis which does not impugn the
motives of Chaplain members of selection boards when recommending career
management decisions about other Chaplains and chaplain candidates.

and

The “new” (old) data.
3. Sometime around October 2005, the Navy copied a collection of works sheets and decision
memoranda which had been prepared by their C/A/R/E Advisory Group. These documents
address roughly 97% of all candidates considered by that board from FY1985 through FY2005 for
accession into the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps, or assignment to active duty therein.
4. The Navy used the C/A/R/E Advisory Group decision memoranda to prepare an electronic
database for Dr. Siskin. He used that data to prepare his December 21, 2005 declaration in this
matter (Siskin, 2005.) I was given a copy of this Navy/Siskin database on 27 July 2006.
5. I have compared the Navy/Siskin electronic database to the paper records it was derived from;
I have corrected the database as necessary, and augmented it with:

(a)

data from the C/A/R/E Advisory Group work sheets;

(b)

information from the face of some of the decision memoranda about the C/A/R/E
Advisory Group’s membership which the Navy and Dr. Siskin failed to capture1.

and

6. “My” database has been provided to the Defendants, with highlights indicating which data
entries I changed, and references to the “Bates Number” of each hard copy record I used to verify
a data entry error.
The Siskin Conjecture - Part I.
7. In his December 21, 2005 declaration (op cit) Dr. Siskin hypothesized2 something like this:
The likelihood of a candidate’s being selected by a board is correlated to the
likelihood that the board contains a panel member with the same denomination
as the candidate.
8. Although he attributes this formulation to me, his hypothesis is not exactly what I had
hitherto been testing. In the past I drew the inference in the other direction: The fact of a
denominational match between a board member and a candidate improved the candidate’s
chances of being selected (by that board.)
9. Here, Dr. Siskin is suggesting that an actual match on a particular board is not necessary;
what marks the nexus, in the Siskin conjecture, is not the actual “co-incidence” (co-occurrence of
a candidate’s denomination and a board member’s denomination) but an underlying similarity per
se, for which a surrogate measure is the likelihood of the match in the first place.

1

Both Dr. Siskin in his declaration, and the Navy in preparing their database for Dr.
Siskin, ignored, overlooked, or simply set aside, the C/A/R/E Advisory Group work sheets.
“Ignored” carries a connotation of disapproval, and while such an inference may be justified, my
point here is that neither the Navy nor Dr. Siskin entered any data from the work sheets into their
database, nor was information from the work sheets reflected in Dr. Siskin’s declaration. The
missing or overlooked or “ignored” information includes: (a) records for four score of candidates
who do not appear in the decision memoranda, (b) thousands of bits of data dealing with faith
group cluster and denominational quotas, (c) evidence within the pattern of entries on the work
sheets which reflects pre-screening, as well as (d) post facto decision alterations. “ My” database
also included information from the decision memoranda which identified the C/A/R/E Board
members, information which I used later to identify board member denominations.

I am not sure that Dr. Siskin meant this as a particular hypothesis. I suspect rather that
he was setting up a straw man so that he could denigrate my analysis. But motivations aside, (a)
his words were to this effect and (b) the hypothesis has scientific merit. (See Part II here.)

10. This is, or could be, a manifestation of the “like, likes, like” hypothesis which was
introduced to this dialogue first by LCDR McCreary (1992), deferred to by the Center for Naval
Analysis (Smith et al, 2000), and relied upon heavily in my work, especially in my Allonge
(Leuba, 2005), but it is significantly different with respect to the source of “intent”.
The Siskin Conjecture - Part II.
11. Where some observers of the “like, likes like” affinity model interpret that model as
requiring that board members consciously (or almost consciously) favor those “like” themselves
who appear before the board, the more general formulation proffered here can be seen as both
more subtle and less of an invitation to presume bias. It is mathematically similar; it may even
be psychologically similar in its theoretical underpinnings and its mechanism of expression. But,
it is profoundly different in the etiology of intent.
12. Sacco, et al (2003a) reminded us that in a traditional personnel-panel selection context, the
interviewer brings demographic information to the table just as surely as does the interviewee,
and that this is a recipe for both (a) the opportunity for discrimination to occur and (b) an
opportunity for that discrimination to be undetected if the data analysis is incomplete3.
13. Dr. Siskin’s conjecture is more indirect than this explicit awareness of the potential for
blatant discrimination. His formulation suggests that the concatenation is removed (i.e. distant)
from the obvious superficiality of both the interviewer and the interviewee being of the same race
or gender or even denomination. They are more fundamentally (more deeply) similar than that.
The connection is still “like, likes, like”, but the basis for that likeness is more resonant than a
simple “single dimension” similarity.4 This is not less inherent, or less intrinsic, but it is (or may
be) less “one on one.”
14. If the theory is right, then a candidate who was fundamentally “like” the members of a
selection board might be selected even though he or she was “different”, or partially dissimilar,
on one or more of the superficial demographic variables.
15. Building from the general principles of “affinity”, one need not allege, suspect, or even decry
“prejudice and corruption”, to notice: If you walk into a board room, a cafeteria, a PTA meeting,

3

The data analysis issue is, of course, that since discrimination is a two party transaction,
if one does not collect and analyze data from both sides of the transaction, one cannot observe
the interaction (if any) between the demographics of the selection panel constituency and the
demographics of the candidates recommended by those panels.
4

I am reminded of a comment I was privileged to hear from Caspar “Cap” Weinberger
in August 1972. In response to a question about working in the White House, Mr. Weinberger
told us: “You do not get to be on the President’s staff because you have learned what his
positions are; you get to be one of the President’s men because you think the way he thinks.”

or indeed any place where people get together regularly, you will notice clustering based on
similarity. It may be as blatant as racial aggregation, or gender separation, or even those with and
without children, or canes, or uniforms. We (all of us) tend to be more comfortable in “familiar”
surroundings. [Birds of a feather do flock together.5]
16. What if, in the Chaplain Corps, the same sort of thing happens? Personnel selection boards
convene and (a) because some of the members have served together before (on boards or off),
they recognize each other, (b) maybe they even like each other, (c) maybe they even understand
where “the other guy is coming from”.
>>> Or maybe, they were selected because they have something in common. <<<
17. It would not be amiss to staff a selection board with people who were already successful at
doing the job the candidates being considered were applying for.
18. Board members who were “good at the job” being applied for might be able to estimate the
potential in others to do that job well, or they might be able to look around the board table at
their peers and recognize common ground which they could then seek within the candidates.
This subjective process might be conscious or unconscious; but it is prima facie valid –
>>> unless the common denominator among the board correlates to an irrelevant or
proscribed variable. <<<
19. The risk here is that the evaluation is totally subjective, and the board membership is not as
“representative” of the denominations being evaluated as the Navy says it is.
(a)

The evaluation is totally subjective because the objective factors, qualifications to
be a chaplain and time in grade to be eligible for promotion, are the same for all
candidates6. The candidates can be distinguished only on the basis of their
(subjective) Officer Efficiency Reports (as interpreted by the board members) and
their AQD. (“Additional Qualification Designator”). The Navy says that AQD is

5

In this understanding of “similarity” we need to maintain perspective on who or what or
how similarity is established - by those in the group - not by the anthropologists or bird watchers
outside the group. Sometimes, the bird who looks different to us, from outside the flock, is just as
much “one of the crowd” as any other member.
6

To avoid cluttering up the discussion at this point, I have illustrated the selection
process for promotion; the logic remains the same for accession decisions, decisions about whom
to add to the Active Duty list, SER decisions, and continuation in service decisions. As we shall
see, the consequences are the same in all these different contexts: Boards composed to a pattern
of “the ideal chaplain” tend to select candidates who share some underlying dimensions which
correlate to the definition of “ideal” - whether that definition of “ideal” is correct or not!

used “to identify each officer’s particular skill sets.” But for Chaplains, the AQD
is “a three digit numeric code that corresponded to the religious endorsing agency
for each officer.” (Kagle 2006.)
Risky Behavior 1: After qualifications are established, the primary dimension which sets the
candidates apart in the record is their individual religious sponsorship or endorser.
(b)

Selection board membership is not nearly as “representative” of the affected
denominations as the Navy alleges. Although board membership has recently
become reasonably balanced across faith group clusters (sic), in the past selection
board membership was largely limited to a small number (five) of “favorite”
denominations.

20. Sacco, et al (2003b) have addressed how this common background could contaminate the
board’s decisions, based on:
“... Schneider’s (1987) Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) theory. This approach
postulates that people are attracted, selected, and retained (or decide to remain on the job)
based on similarity between the individual’s personality and those of the organizational
members. Because people may make judgments about their co-workers’ personalities or
other relevant attributes based on demographics, or to the extent that demographics are
important determinants of similarity judgments, the ASA framework provides additional
support for relational and organizational demography perspectives.”
21. Quite clearly, if the “Organization” routinely staffs its selection panels with members of a
de jure7 “clique”, whatever those “insiders” have in common becomes the implicit de facto
template for “success” in the organization.
21. Risky Behavior 2: If the same denominations judge candidates for continuation in the
Service as judge the candidates for promotion, then it is both predictable and proscribe-able that
7

The Navy may say that I have misused this comparison; de jure and de facto contrast
(a) what is true or is “supposed to be true”, based on the rules of the Organization, and (b) what
the “facts on the ground” are as those rules are followed (or ignored.) The Navy will say that it
has no de jure favorite denominations; they may argue that whatever statistically significant
uneven denominational distribution which may be occurring is incidental or accidental (if one
controls for relative numbers). It is my opinion here that the data demonstrate an historic pattern
and practice (a de jure intention) of placing Roman Catholic on all and Presbyterian (USA),
Lutheran (ELCA), United Methodist and Southern Baptist denominations on most, selection
boards, with a smattering of other “acceptable” denominations added from time to time for
appearances’ sake - but always with the invidious* intention of supporting “mainstream”
denominational influence in general and Catholic influence in particular (*cf footnote 25).

the individual denominations barred from participation in the selection panels will also be the
denominations who suffer both the most “loss on the way to being considered for promotion” and
the least success in promotion when they are given an opportunity to be considered for promotion
[cf “Revisiting the Missing Non-Liturgicals” below, and Appendix F.]
22.

Hart (2005) has highlighted this concern:

“As one court has explained it, ‘when the evaluation is to any degree subjective and when
the evaluators themselves are not members of the protected minority, the legitimacy and
nondiscriminatory basis of the articulated reason for the decision may be subject to particularly
close scrutiny’.”8
Testing the Siskin Conjecture:
23. The data tell me (see Appendix A) that whoever is or was assigning chaplains to the
Promotion Boards, and the SER Boards, and even the C/A/R/E Advisory Group, was not making
those assignments at random. The Navy’s advocates have told us that there was an effort to
“balance” the boards by faith group cluster, but this “balance” came late to the process (after
2000) and was never achieved in denominational terms.
24. There were undoubted availability concerns and logistic concerns that affected selection
board staffing patterns. “As long as you have to be in the building for the 05 Board, can you
handle the 04 Board too? You are the Deputy xxx; it’s your job to sit on one of these boards.
Hey, John, can you do this when you come by?”
25. But, there may also have been, although I do not allege it in particular it has to be
considered, some measure of favoritism being acted out. As diligent as the Navy may have been
to be sure that the selection panels were “balanced” with respect to gender and minority status,
the Chaplain Corps’ faith group category sub text enabled five denominations to fill the majority
of the seats on all the selection panels. Appendix A presents this phenomenon in detail as it
operated for promotion boards. Appendix B compares the denominational participation patterns
for promotion boards to those for SER Boards and C/A/R/E Boards.
26. Dr. Siskin’s conjecture suggests that one does not need an exact match between the
denomination of the candidate and a denomination on a particular board, if the board in general is
composed of “like minded” officers. Their like-mindedness will resonate with, and they will
tend to select, copacetic candidates.
27. We can use Siskin and Weinberger (footnote 4) to extract an “operational definition” of the
Navy’s “ideal” Chaplain (or favorite denominations), from the Navy’s patterns and practice re
the staffing of selection boards.

28. All I have to do is make a list of all the Chaplains the Navy assigned to personnel selection
boards over a statistically significant period of time, and then point to that list and say: “the
Navy’s ‘ideal’, the Navy’s de jure preferred, Chaplain is embodied by that composite”.
29. To the extent that any candidate “matches” or “looks like” that composite he or she will fare
well in the selection deliberations because he or she will “look right”.
30. This paradigm is not just the “like, likes” like” I have been belaboring (although one flows
from the other); this is a profoundly different insight which we have Dr. Siskin to thank for.
a. Three Time periods
31. The Chaplain Corps’ “pattern and practice” regarding the assignment of denominations to
promotion boards can be divided into three periods, bounded by litigation events. (For further
detail, see the pie charts, graphs and tables in Appendix A and “Change Point” in Leuba 2006b.)
32. Prior to 1986/87, the Chaplain Corps placed two Roman Catholics on every promotion
panel, and filled out the rest of panel with a majority of Liturgical Chaplains (drawn from three
“favorite” denominations). Accessions at this time were managed by faith group cluster, and
there was an effort to align the pattern of accessions to the rank and file’s pattern of faith group
cluster preferences.
33. After 1986/87, in what seems to be a response, if not a settlement, to then pending litigation
charging undue Catholic influence, the Navy changed the pattern of Chaplains on promotion
boards from (a) two Roman Catholics to (b) one Roman Catholic and one line officer, and
although a few more Non-Liturgical Chaplains were allowed to sit on a promotion board after
1987, the overall effect was not a substantial change in their representation. Furthermore,
concomitant with this change, the Corps abandoned its “matching pattern” for accessions, and
adopted a quota system, which has come to be known as “the thirds policy.” 9
34. In 2000 another change point occurred; new law suits filed in 1999 and 2000 raised concerns
again about imbalances in the selection panels - and consequential imbalances in the decisions
9

July 31, 1986, CAPT Donald Muchow, later Chief of Chaplains, but here Chief of the
Plans, Policy and Programs Branch, wrote a memorandum which was approved by the Chief of
Chaplains: “Revised FY87 Accession Goals”. This memo shows the Corps abandoning its
objective criteria for accessions and substituting subjective criteria as the basis for its goals and
quotas. “The Chief of Chaplains has determined that the faith group category mix that best meets
the needs of the Navy is 35% liturgical Protestant, 35% non-liturgical Protestant, and 30%
other,” (of which 25% was to be Catholic, with the remaining 5% being Jewish, Orthodox and
Mormon). With this stroke, the Corps exchanged (1) a practice of aligning the proportion of
Chaplains by faith group cluster to the proportion of the rank and file professing an affinity for
that cluster, for (2) an arbitrary ratio that is nominally 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.

which flowed from those panels. The Navy (a) broadened denominational representation on the
promotion panels, (b) increased the number of line officers on the panels from one, to two (and
eventually to five), and it abandoned the use of quotas as a planning guide for accessions.
b.

Favorite Denominations

35. In order to test the Siskin Conjecture, we need a measure of “the likelihood of a
denomination being on a selection board.”
•

We have no data for membership on Continuation in Service (CADRAG) boards.

C

We have SER Board data for only four boards staffed with Chaplains.

C

We have data for only five years of C/A/R/E Advisory Group boards.

C

But we have nearly complete promotion board membership data for LCDR, CDR, and
Capt boards for more than 25 years. [See Appendix A.]

36. We can rank this promotion board denomination-incidence data by time period (divided by
Change Points) and faith group cluster, and establish a set of “frames” for comparing selection
rates for pools of similarly situated candidates:

37. Table 1 does not separate the denominational appearances by time period; it does separate
them by faith group cluster.
•

There are substantial and potentially interesting differences across the time periods, to
which we will return.

•

The separation by faith group cluster serves to highlight the inequity in denominational
representation across the so-called clusters, and it facilitates a discussion of:

c. Core Values vs Corps Values
38. Presumably, the U.S. Navy shares our country’s core values, among which are a National
commitment to plurality and the “separation of Church and State”. The evidence in Table 1 and
Appendix A suggests that within the Navy, the Chaplain Corps marches to a different drummer,
and seems to value Roman Catholicism ahead of all other denominations.
C

Prior to 1988 the Corps placed two Roman Catholics on every selection panel, and
harvested the benefits of that system - reporting to itself at the time that 38% of all the
Commanders in the Corps were Roman Catholic, while only 23% of the total Corps was
Roman Catholic. [This 150% over-representation at CDR is more than just statistically
significant.]10

C

When the Corps dropped the “two Catholics on every promotion board” policy, it
simultaneously changed its accession policy from parity with the rank and file, to the
35%, 35%, 30% cited above. This quota policy not only facilitated accessioning for
Catholics in particular (since their quota was so far above the probable percentage
Catholic of applicants), but it also provided a pretext “justification” for rejecting NonLiturgical Protestant candidates - since the ceiling that the quota levied on them was so
much lower than their pool of applicants.

Hypotheses:
39. All other things being equal, the probability of being selected by a Chaplain Corps selection
board ought to be independent of the candidate’s denomination. (Cf Siskin, 2005, page 9.)
10

In a set of briefing charts entitled “Roman Catholic Chaplains: Overview” [see
LAR0382 to LAR0399], the Navy reports (to itself) that as of 15 April 1991, 34% of the CDRS
were Roman Catholic, while only 12% of the LTJGs were Roman Catholic. To my knowledge,
no other denomination has been singled out within the Navy for this kind of “status report”
attention. This is data from the Navy’s own files, four years after the Change Point. I read this
data as corroborating the earlier information, consistent with my own examination of the records
in the Chaplain’s History (Halley 1993), and as demonstrating an historic, reliable, statistically
significant, and in my opinion the consequence of - an intentional preference for Catholics.

That is, in the absence of perturbing bias:
our best estimate for the percentage of candidates of denomination X who are selected for
decision Y should be statistically the same as the percentage of all candidates considered
who are selected for decision Y.11
40. The imposition of quotas perturbs that relationship for the faith group clusters which have to
be “culled”, requiring the reformulation:
Our best estimate for the percentage of candidates of denomination X who are selected
for decision Y should be statistically the same as the percentage of all candidates
belonging to the same faith group cluster as denomination X who are selected for
decision Y.
41. A board composed of people who are good at their jobs, who know what “good” looks like,
who measure candidates against their own templates and the templates of valued peers, will
select:
(a) Candidates who are qualified,
(b) Candidates who comport to the ideal, and
(c) Candidates who “look like” themselves (collectively.)
42. This may be the same mathematics and nearly the same statistical analysis as “like, likes,
like”, but the Siskin Conjecture does not require a denominational match on the board, nor does
it imply that board members consciously (or unconsciously) violate their oath to be impartial - it
only requires a “likeness” between the “kind of person the candidate is” and the “kind of person”
the board is seeking, which, in transitive social mathematics12, is “the kind of person the board is
composed of.”
Here is what the data tell us:
a. From the distribution of denominations on the selection panels
43. Conclusion 1: The Chaplain Corps has an explicit pattern for the Chaplains it wants, which
we can extract from the implications of their practices. See Appendix A and B. Furthermore:

11

This is the proper a priori statistical assumption. If we suspect bias, the proper test is
to compare the selection rate for denomination X to the selection rate for all other (i.e., non-X)
denominations, or, alternatively, to compare X’s selection rate (or X’s faith group’s selection
rate) to the selection rate for the presumptively favored denomination, or faith group. See
OFCCP Compliance Manual - Chapter 7 (11/13/2005).
12

Although applicable here, not all social mathematics is transitive.

C

Look at how the Navy defines its faith group clusters, so that it can manage them that
way, with Catholics set aside in their own group, with all the other denominations
stereotyped13 into amorphous, internally conflicted “groups”.

C

Look at how the Navy has populated its selection panels, with Catholics on every board,
and a limited range of “mainstream” denominations used to achieve a voting majority on
virtually every board, of every type. (See Appendix B.)

C

Or look at what the Chaplain Corps calculated for its “ideal mix” of denominations, once
it adopted quotas. (See Appendix C.)

C

Or look at the “bottom line” denominational mix it has orchestrated among its higher
ranks, Commander and Captain. (See footnote 10, again.)

44. Conclusion 2: There are statistically significant departures from denominational parity in the
Navy’s planning documents, in the staffing patterns it employs for its selection boards, and in the
results of the decisions of those boards as they are reflected in published data.
45. We may infer from what they say, as well as from what they have done (see Appendix A)
that when the Navy assembles a selection panel it considers at least these three factors:
First, is the proposed panel member a Chaplain in good standing of the appropriate rank.
Second, does the proposed panel member add intended balance to the panel. Balance is or has
been defined to include gender and racial minority balance, but the obvious controlling concern
has been “representation” from one of the three “major” faith group categories, with a de jure14
limit that the board must have a Catholic and may not have a majority of what I have referred to
as “blue collar” clerics.
The third factor is “between the lines” in the lists of approved selection panel members. Of
course they have to be available, but they also have to be “acceptable.”
A psychiatrist, or an executive “headhunter”, or perhaps even an FBI profiler, might be able to
read their personnel files or interview the Chaplains selected for this duty and write a precis or
dossier which captured significant characteristics which the Chaplains had in common.
I can do much the same thing in a “black box” kind of way by simply saying whatever mix of
denominations fit into this box (the actual list of preferences), that mix contains, embodies, the
collateral characteristics the Navy wants.

13

Stereotyping is the foundation for prejudice and discrimination, see Footnote 24.

46. The successful candidate may be a Catholic more often than he is a Unitarian, but it is the
boards’ perception of his likeness to them, not his Catholicity, which leads to his selection.15
47. If one needs to assign motivation to the denominational discrimination which flows through
the Chaplain Corps personnel management system, the duty officer who “packs the selection
board” is the party with “intent.” And the defenders of the selection board staffing patterns are
collaborators.
b. From the decisions made by the selection panels
48. Observing the patterns in Appendix A and B, we may posit what the Navy’s “favorite”
denominations are.
If:
(a) these favorite denominations are tiered, based on the level or degree of favoritism, as
measured by their likelihood of being assigned to a promotion board,
and also if
(b) all candidates before those boards are sorted into matching denominational cohorts
(data clusters which parallel the favorites’ tiers with respect to denomination and share a
similar “level” of likelihood of having their denomination assigned to a promotion
board),
then we can
(c) test the Siskin Conjecture.
15

I wrote this characterization to help the Navy’s advocates distinguish between the
confrontation with “regularity” which they see in my use of the “like, likes, like” theory, and the
more indirect process which unfolds in this Siskin Conjecture based, template model . But,
frankly, I think that any such distinction is an intellectual deceit, if it is not hair splitting. One
does not have to impugn the board member’s motivations or conscientiousness to be concerned
about the possibility of distortion in their judgments.
Deductive reasoning may allow the Board to believe that they are picking the best qualified
candidate, but if they pick candidates who are disproportionately their own denomination more
than any other denomination, then the Navy has to justify the pattern of denominations they place
on the boards. The Navy has to do better than argue “intended balance”; they have to do better
than adopt this “general” similarity to a template explanation. The Navy has to have a reason for
preferring one set of religious beliefs (for assignment to selection boards) over another - or else
they have to show how a person with “those religious beliefs” is more likely to posses this (???)
(whatever it is) required skill.

49. The pattern of figures above is statistically significant (Chi Square <.001; which is beyond
the three standard deviations level of significance.) Conclusion 3: This supports the Siskin
Conjecture. Denominations faring best in terms of getting a seat on a promotion board, are also
those which are the most likely to rise to the rank of CDR.
50. However, this is over the whole 25 years and does not take into account that the “favorite
denominations” as measured by the likelihood of being assigned to a promotion board, changed
(at least the probability of assignment to a promotion board changed) in 1988 and again in 2000.
One might wonder if:
(a) the likelihood of selection for promotion for the preferred or favorite denominations
changed along with
(b) their Change Point driven change in likelihood of selection for assignment to a
promotion board.
An examination along this line would not only test the Siskin Conjecture per se, it would
(a) replicate the test we just passed (at least in a split halves sense) and
(b) it could begin to assay the sensitivity of the correlation underpinning the Conjecture.

*Along with two Catholics, one Presbyterian Church of the USA (PUSA) was on 100% of these promotion boards.
Data for 1981 to 1987 from Precepts produced by USN; 1977-1980 estimated from Chaplains’ History, Halley 1993.

Conclusion 4: The Siskin Conjecture is confirmed (and replicated with different data16).
•

Tier I, the denominations which are most likely to be assigned to a promotion board in the
1977-1987 period (Roman Catholic and Presbyterian USA), are also the denominations
which are the most likely to be promoted. [Binomial test for 114 selections out of 134
considers for Tier I vs 178 selections out of 237 considers for all other Tiers, has z = 2.4
standard deviations, p<.05.]
16

Virtually all the selections in Table 2 were also included in the data in paragraph 48,
but the counts of considered here in Table 2 are based on the Precepts and Navy flow points, not
mere presence on the ADL list at some time in the decade. (cf the missing candidates - Appx F.)

•

Tier II denominations fare better than the denominations which are even less likely to be
assigned to a promotion board (although one has to combine the small samples in the Tier
III and Tier IV categories to “see” this advantage, and even though consistent with the
hypothesis, the difference is not statistically significant. There are 87 selections out of
113 considers for Tier II and 91 out of 124 for Tier III + Tier IV; z = 0.64.)

•

Tier IV for the Non-Liturgicals fares worst in terms of appearance on a promotion board,
and also worst (as predicted) in terms of promotion to CDR - suffering pressure from the
incipient quota. This difference is statistically significant p<.001 @ 3.6 std devs, testing
the binomial: 16 selections out of 34 considers for NL Group IV vs 266 selections out of
337 considers for all others.

52. Table 3 presents the data for the second period, 1988-1999.
53. For Table 3, I aligned the “favorite denominations” with the denominational assignment
incidence data for this second time period, after the first Change Point, but one could also stay
with the pattern which was “established” from the whole time period.
After all, the issue in any given instance is not the presence or not of any particular denomination
on that board, but rather the overall likelihood of each denomination’s having a chance to be on a
selection board.

Data from Kagle Declaration (2006) and Appendix 3 to Siskin (2005) report.

54. The data for this time period are consistent with the hypotheses: (a) Tier I fares better than
Tier II; (b) Non-Liturgicals lose more proportionately as the Tiers increase than do the Liturgicals
(as predicted by quota pressure). However, only some of the differences here are statistically
significant , notably Tier I vs Tier IV, and Tier II vs Tier IV for Non-Liturgicals.
Conclusion 5: Overall, the Siskin Conjecture is confirmed in principle again, as is the effect of
the quota pressure on the “late Tier” Non-Liturgicals.

Data from Appendix 3 to Siskin (2006) report.

56. Table 2 dealt with the “two Catholics on every Board” period; Table 3 applied to the change
to one Catholic and one line officer (as well as the imposition of quotas); Table 4 turns to the
recent shift to (a) two line officers and (b) a broader range of denominations.
The data in the various cells in Table 4 do not differ from each other, statistically. But, if the
sample sizes were larger, one might be able to conclude that:
C
and
•

Catholics were still being given too many board seats (100%),
Tier IV Non-Liturgicals were still receiving too few promotions (38%).

57. Finding no statistical significance is not
a “failure” to confirm the Siskin Conjecture,
rather it is what the conjecture would predict,
in this time period. In this time period, 2000
to 2002, there is (by design and intention)
supposed to be no statistically significant
difference in the likelihood of any
denomination’s appearing on a selection
panel, so if that were true, the conjecture
would predict no significant differences in
promotion rates.
c. Interim Summary
58. The data in paragraph 48 verified the
validity of the Siskin Conjecture with respect
to selection panels considering candidates for
promotion to Commander. That paragraph
used the overall profile of denominational

A Caution: One should not assume that just because
“things” seem to be working smoothly now, they will
continue to do so.
Although the promotion board actions seem to have
risen above denominational prejudice - under the
current board staffing regimen,
(1) The current system rests on the shifty foundation
of promotion consideration based on results from the
continuation in service boards, 2-FOS decisions, and
Indef Ext Bd decisions; if the denominational bias in
those processes is not corrected, no long lasting equity
or parity can be achieved. (See Appendix F.)
(2) W hatever the Navy is allowed to do “on its own”
(to mitigate litigation complication, cf Change Points)
it may undo voluntarily once vigilance is distracted.
Regularization should be ordered now, so that it may
be assured in the future.

preferences in selection panels in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps from 1977 to 2002 to form
cohorts of denominations which were “similarly likely” to have one of their own assigned to a
promotion panel. The evidence was clear and statistically significant well beyond three standard
deviations.
Dr. Siskin was right in this instance:
The likelihood of a candidate’s being selected by a board is correlated to the
likelihood that the board contains a panel member with the same denomination
as the candidate.
59. Tables 2, 3 and 4 analyzed the data for Commander promotion boards across the time
periods, 1977-1987, 1988-1999, and 2000-2002. The pattern of results showed that (a) as the
composition of the selection panels changed (reducing the exaggerated preference for some few
denominations on selection panels), (b) the distortions in the likelihood of promotion reduced exactly to the degree, and among the denominations, that the conjecture forecast.
At least with respect to promotion to Commander, prejudiced patterns in
selection board staffing led to, leads to, parallel prejudices in the decisions made
by those boards.
d. What about other kinds of selection panels?

60. Of course, when making a SER decision, one selects the chaplains who do not match the
template; one should not be surprised when the closest match (the Catholics) lose the fewest
chaplains and the most distant match (the denominations who are so undervalued that they are
“never” given a seat on any selection board) lose the most chaplains - proportionately 5 times as
many as the most favored denomination. [This is statistically significant, p <.001.]
Conclusion 6: The Siskin Conjecture is confirmed in the context of SER decisions.
The process underlying the Siskin Conjecture is appropriately asymmetric when the selection
decision is an adverse action. Denominations with the greatest likelihood of being assigned to a
selection board, lose the fewest chaplains and the denominations with the least presence on
selection boards lose the most chaplains.
Accessions
61. The new “old” data (paragraph 4 above) contain records for virtually all the candidates
considered for accession into the Chaplain Corps between 1985 and 2005. This included nearly
1000 applicants for admission into the Chaplain Corps Officer Program (akin to an ROTC
program for seminary students). Because these are candidates who were located (and perhaps
encouraged or discouraged) by recruiters who had both quotas and incentives for meeting those
quotas, this population was pre-screened; they were all qualified.
62. Even so, they were screened again, by the C/A/R/E Advisory Group and some (but not all) of
them were recommended to the Chief of Chaplains
63. We have membership information for the C/A/R/E Advisory Group for five years. We can
identify each Chaplain member’s denomination in the Chaplain Corps History volume, and these
can be compared to the “favorite” denominations as expressed by selection board membership.

Summary Conclusions I
65. Conclusion 7: These patterns are all statistically significant well beyond one chance in
several million - in the region of seven standard deviations. There can be “no statistical doubt”
that the selection boards are picking “people like us” to add to the Corps, and rejecting “people
who are different”. And since the only differentiating dimension visible in the records is
denomination, it follows that this is religious discrimination. It may be unwitting on the part of
the individual chaplain board members, it may even be unwitting on the part of the subordinate
assignment officer who decided whom to suggest for a role on the selection panels, but it was not
institutionally innocent and it cannot be unwitting to defend it in the face of this data.
66. Conclusion 8: The moment of intent is memorialized in the Navy’s pleadings in this matter.
In their “Reply in Support of their Cross Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative for Partial
Summary Judgment” (Adair, 8/11/2006), Defendants describe the stream of logic and the reason
for their selection of a pattern of faith group clusters on personnel selection boards: (1) faith
group cluster is one of the factors used in assigning chaplains to duty locations, (2) a chaplain’s
efficiency report will reflect differences due to duty assignments, (3) placing chaplains with a
mix of experience on promotion boards the Navy “expects” ... “at least one member ..to
understand the manner in which each faith group category was logistically managed and how the
differences in utilization, administration and deployment may inform board evaluations of
chaplain fitness reports” (p. 4.)

67. The Navy put this mix of Chaplains on the selection boards with the intention of influencing
the board’s recommendations.
The mix was chosen:
(a) at least one Catholic was assigned to every promotion board,
(b) at least one Liturgical Chaplain was assigned to every promotion board, and
(c) when one looks at the denominations that were chosen to “represent” the Liturgical and the
Non-Liturgical faith group clusters, the pattern there:
(1) is biased, i.e. it has de jure favorites; and it
(2) matches the pattern of denominations who benefitted from the Boards’ actions.
(3) The denominations that are never assigned to selection panels (or virtually never
assigned) are the same denominations that are:
(i) under-promoted vis a vis their peers,
(ii) forced into involuntary retirement most often,
(iii) under accessioned and
(iv) shunned from active duty by the operation of quotas.
68. Defendants declare an FY2003 shift from (a) staffing promotion boards with five chaplains
and two non-chaplains to (b) now staffing promotion boards with two chaplains and five nonchaplains [see Notice of Motion ( 2/28/05 Wilkins)]. Defendants argue that this shift is not an
admission that the former policy was flawed. They aver that the change is an exercise of military
discretion - and admit that the pattern of faith group clusters used in 1985 to 2002 was also a
military judgment - i.e. an intention.

Epilogue
69. We do not have any data that tell us what the denominational participation was in CADRAG
(the continuation in service) boards, but IF, i.e., if , the pattern of preference there was like the
pattern on promotion boards, and SER boards, and C/A/R/E boards, then we know:
C

something interesting about the Continuation in Service Boards and

C

something important about some chaplains who have been missing from (missing out on)
consideration for promotion.

70. First, about four weeks ago I have received a copy of a FOIA response provided by the
Department of the Navy to Mr. Laurence W. Jones, on or about October 3, 2002.
71. I received this data from Mr. Schulcz, attorney for the Plaintiffs. I do not know who Mr.
Jones is, nor what his relationship is or may be with respect to this case. I was given this data
because after noticing that some old data from the C/A/R/E Advisory Group for 1981 dealt with
“Indefinite Extension”, I asked Mr. Schulcz if he had anything else that dealt with this sort of
decision.
a. The “Extension/Continuation in Service” process.
72. After a newly accessioned Naval Officer has served on active duty for nearing three years,
the first “re-up” window occurs. He (or she) is asked if they wish to continue in Active Duty
Service.
73. In the Chaplain Corps most serving chaplains (but not all of them) opt to be considered for
extension, and most of those who request an additional tour of active duty (but not all of them)
are recommended for further service.
74. These two decisions:
(1) the individual Chaplain’s decision to ask for continuation, and
(2) the Navy’s decision on whether to extend that Chaplain’s service,
interact to impact the denominational mix of the Corps as experience levels increase.
75. Whatever self-selection or filtering which may be taking place at this juncture, its
compound effect may explain (a) the disproportionate loss of Non-Liturgical candidates for
“consideration” for promotion to LCDR, CDR and CAPT17 and (b) it may comment upon the
pattern of denominational preferences within the Chaplain Corps.
17

When the Navy publishes promotion statistics the reports are based on the number of
promotions with respect to the number of candidates who are considered. “Considered” in this
context has a term of art quality. First, a candidate is only “considered” if his or her name is put
on the list, and it only counts as a consider on the first occasion it is there. A candidate who is
not selected on his first opportunity is said to be FOS (Failed of Selection), and if he is FOS two
times for the same rank up to an including CDR, he may be “selected out” by the CADRAG, or a
CARE or Indefinite Extension board. On the other hand, if such a candidate is not selected out,
he remains on the promotion list and may be selected for promotion - which has the effect of restarting the FOS count. The first time I looked at the Navy’s promotion data I wondered why the
number of “considers” at each higher rank showed a “faith group cluster” effect that seemed to
evidence “missing” (Non-Liturgical) candidates as rank increased. The answer may be here.

b. The Data
76. The FOIA data are neither as “tidy” nor as complete as one might hope.
C

They deal with a limited sampling of time periods, 1987, 88, 89, 90, 92 and then 1996.

C

The data from each end of this period (i.e.1987 and 1992 &1996) are not useful.
C
C
•

The data for 1987 is illegible and
The data for 1992 and 1996 do not show what decision was made.
Only the data for 1990 lists the eligibles who did not request continuation.

77. Even so, we can glean some statistically significant information from this data.
78. The inferences therefrom can support other findings or encourage further discovery.
79. Appendix DF is a copy of the FOIA response. Appendix DB is a database transcribed from
the FOIA response. The database provides one line for every name listed in the FOIA response,
for 1988 to 1990. I captured the denomination associated with each Chaplain in the FOIA lists,
and I recorded the decision. I captured the Chaplain’s name only for chaplains who were (a) not
selected, (b) whose decisions were changed by the approving authority (the Chief of
Chaplains?), or (c) for the six chaplains who were noted in the May 1990 list as eligible for
continuance who did not request consideration.
80. I used the Chaplains History Volume X (Halley 1993) to verify each chaplain’s
denomination and to “look up” what happened to the chaplains whose names I recorded - i.e. the
rejected, the “changed” and the six who chose not to continue.
c. Results
81. The data cover CADRAG decisions made concerning 246 chaplains who were both (a)
eligible for and (b) requested to be considered for, extension (or continuance) on active duty.
In order to analyze the CADRAG board’s decisions in light of the Siskin Conjecture, we need
some basis for “cohorting” the denominations, but we have no direct information on the
denominational make up of the CADRAG boards.
82. Conclusion 9: Instead of defaulting to the Navy’s (I) Roman Catholic, (II) Liturgical
Protestant, (III) Non-Liturgical Protestant and (IV) Special Worship Group18, I looked at which
denominations the Navy assigned to its other selection Boards (promotion Boards, SER Boards
and C/A/R/E Boards) and I let that distribution define the de jure preference pattern:
18

This would be tantamount to assuming a “level playing field” on a faith group cluster
basis, a circumstance at clear variance with the data in Appendix A for this time period.

Tier I The denomination(s) which is/are assigned to all or to virtually all selection Boards.
This is Roman Catholics, and there is no “close second”.
Tier II The denominations which are frequently assigned to a Selection Board, but not “always”
assigned or even almost always assigned.
This is SB
ELCA
PUSA
and UM

(They are on about half as many boards as the Catholics)
(They are on about 1/3 as many boards as the Catholics)
(They are on about 1/3 as many boards as the Catholics)
(They are on about 1/3 as many boards as the Catholics)

Tier III All other denominations.
83. In the earlier (pre-epilogue) analyses in this declaration, I break this third tier into two
subgroups: IIIa which is those denominations who have had more than incidental presence on
some selection boards and IIIb, those denominations who have never had a seat on a selection
board, or almost never. I also explore the possibility that the “favorites” may change over time,
or from context to context. In the present instance, however, we do not know who was on these
CADRAG boards, and we only have 246 decisions to parse, so I will simply use this generalized,
operationally defined, sequence of favorites.
84. Table 5 presents the CADRAG decisions cohorted according to the de jure favorite
denominations defined above (see Conclusion 9, ¶ 82 and Appendix A and B).

85. The pattern of results in Table 5(even without considering the fact that the Siskin
Conjecture predicts an ordering from Tier I to Tier III) is statistically significant (using a Chi
Square statistic) at p<.001 (more than three standard deviations.) Chance alone cannot account
for this preference among these “favorite-denomination” based clusters.

86. This pattern is also consistent with the results from the 1981 C/A/R/E board mentioned
earlier. In 1981 and 1982 the C/A/R/E Board undertook a “continuation” consideration for 27
chaplains. Twelve of these chaplains were Roman Catholic; ten were continued. Of the
remaining 15 chaplains, only 3 were continued.
87. It is clear, based on this analysis of the FOIA data and corroborated by the analysis of the
1981-82 C/A/R/E Advisory Group continuation considerations:
•
and
•

Conclusion 10: The Siskin Conjecture (using the de jure favorites) is verified in the
CADRAG context,
Conclusion 11: There is denominational preference at work in the Corps’ decision about
which denominations to allow to continue on Active Duty.

88. Conclusion 12: Catholics, as usual, are preferred over everybody else, and the second
favorite denominations (three Liturgical [ELCA, PUSA, and UM] and one Non-Liturgical [SB])
are preferred over all the others. Conclusion 13: This alone could account for the loss of
“considers” as the promotion board lists are prepared for LCDR, CDR and CAPT. [See
Appendix F.]

d. Anecdotal Support for this systematic Denominational Preference within CADRAG
89. In the roughly 250 decisions which the CADRAG issued, four were overruled by the
approving authority, and one of the chaplains who had not asked to be considered for a
continuation seems to have been enticed into staying.
90. Of the four CADRAG decisions which the Chief of Chaplains reversed, three were for
Roman Catholics that the CADRAG had recommended to Inactive Duty.
Ronald Chiasson had been recommended for RAD19;
the CoC asked that he be extended until 1994.
Ref 1 indicates that Chiasson was RAD 10/90.
Leslie Colaco had been recommended for RAD;
the CoC asked that he be extended to age 60.
Ref 1 indicates a tour in Japan 90-92, followed by one in Iceland.

19

RAD stands for “Released from Active Duty”. This may be, as here, an “adverse
action” imposed by the CADRAG Board and approved by the Chief of Chaplains, or it may be a
neutral administrative implementation following upon the affected Chaplain’s desire to leave
Active Duty when his (or her) tour is finished.

Stanley Czarnota had been recommended for RAD;
the CoC asked that he be extended.
Ref 1 indicates a tour in Maine 90-93 followed by one in Great Lakes.
91. One decision for an Alternate was changed to an “out”.
CADRAG had recommended:
Lyrice Marsh, a CFGC, for alternate status
(in case the end strength allowance provided a billet);
the CoC changed this. Ref 1 indicates Marsh was RAD 9/89.
92. These four CoC interventions favored a Catholic chaplain on three occasions, and
disadvantaged a CFGC on the remaining occasion. Conclusion 14: Because this is on the close
margin of statistically significant20 one may accept the anecdotal evidence as supportive of both
institutional and management (the Chief of Chaplains) pro Catholic and anti CFGC bias.
93. Finally, it may be interesting to note that of the six chaplains who (we know) were eligible
for continuance but who are not recorded here as having requested it, one “changed his mind” or
was “enticed” by an attractive assignment.
Rabbi Jon Cutler was listed in the FOIA documents as not having asked for consideration
for continuance.
Ref 1 indicates that he stayed for one more tour, in Okinawa.
e. Revisiting “What Happened to all the Non-Liturgicals?”
94. The FOIA data indicate that chaplains can be “lost” from Active Duty in the Corps
“voluntarily” as well as involuntarily. They can be lost voluntarily via not requesting
continuation. They can be lost involuntarily by having their requests for continuation denied.
95. When one looks at the Chaplains History (Halley, 1993) to see if there is any visible
distinction between those chaplains lost from further consideration because they did not
volunteer for extension when it was available (the other five chaplains we know about in the
FOIA records) and those who wanted to stay and were rejected, we see that both are coded
“RAD”, released from active duty. The Chaplains History cannot help us differentiate
withdrawals from rejections.
20

Following the logic Dr. Siskin used for his coin tossing stranger, here we have the
Chief of Chaplains overruling the CADRAG board four times - each time in a direction which is
consistent with preference for Catholics or against CFGC. In a one tailed test, the statistical
likelihood of this set of outcomes is 1/16, which, at 6%, is close to the 5% associated with two
standard deviations beyond chance expectation.

96. But, in conjunction with the FOIA data we can make some relevant inferences:
•

Since CADRAG (and subsequent CoC direction/intervention) suggests that virtually all
Catholics who want to extend their tours will be approved, one might make the
assumption that most of the “early (Catholic) losses” evidenced in the Chaplains History
are voluntary.
Catholics lose nearly 9 times as many chaplains in their first year (5.1%) as do NonBaptist, Non-Liturgicals (0.6%).21

•

Since CADRAG (and subsequent CoC action) suggests that Non-Baptist, Non-Liturgical
chaplains are least likely (Tier III) to be continued in the service when they want to stay,
one might make the assumption that most of the late losses (those on the threshold of
consideration for CDR, for example) are rejections rather than voluntary withdrawals.
Catholics lose 3.1% of their chaplains during the 3 years following entrance into the CDR
zone; Non-Baptist Non-Liturgicals lose 11.7% during these three years.22

97. I believe that it has been disingenuous in the extreme for Defendants to feign skepticism in
the past when I have opined that some underlying Chaplain Corps practice has been removing
Non-Liturgicals from the pool of those to be considered for promotion. The Navy is full well
aware of the operation of its Continuance in Service Boards and has avoided providing the Court
(or the Plaintiffs) with any information concerning these actions.
98. The inferences drawn in the two bullet points above (in paragraph 96) could be verified very
easily (or in the alternative, dispelled) by reference to Navy records.
99. Conclusion 15: It is my opinion that the data demonstrate that Non-Liturgical, Non-Baptist
candidates were being systematically deprived of the opportunity to be considered for promotion
to Commander. The mechanism for this deprivation was the CADRAG board; the cause was the
pattern of denominational staffing on that board, as expressed through the operation of “like,
likes, like” or the Siskin Conjecture.
Summary Conclusions II
100. The Siskin Conjecture is verified putting some denominations on selection boards, and leaving others off, correlates to the
outcome that candidates from those denominations experience before those boards, in

every known context: Promotion Boards, SER Boards, C/A/R/E Boards and even the
CADRAG Boards (because the de jure denominations in the other boards predict the
results of the CADRAG boards).
This outcome may be the result of relational demographics operating through a generic “ideal” (a
la the Siskin Conjecture or the Weinberger Assertion), affinity considerations (a la “like, likes,
like”), some sort of “old boys” network working its will within the Chaplain Corps, any
combination of the above - or, in fact, all of the above.
Which denominations are placed on the Chaplain selection boards matters!

Appendix A
Denominational Preferences on Chaplain Corps Selection Boards
A1

In its pleadings in this matter, the Navy’s advocates have repeatedly represented:
“The Navy composed its selection boards, from approximately FY 1988 through FY
2002, such that the faith group category mix on the board, like the composition of the
Chaplain Corps generally, reflected to the extent possible each of the faith group
categories, in compliance with SECNAVINST 1401.3 ¶¶ 4(a) and 5.” 23

A2

This statement is misleading, and it may even be intentionally deceptive.

A3 This statement is misleading because it posits that “faith group category” is somehow the
measure of composition of the “Corps generally” which is to be “reflected” in the selection
boards.
A4 However: first, if one looks at the “faith group categories” through the prism of this
litigation, then both the social science concept of stereotyping24 and the Supreme Court’s
presumption of invidious intent25 argue that the faith group cluster “system” is a pretext for

23

See e.g., 1:99-cv-02945-RMU-JMF Document 224 filed 05/24/06 pages 99, 100 and
101 of 109.
24

Krieger (1995) writes “the assumption that statements reflecting stereotyped views
betoken discriminatory animus makes sense if one understands discrimination as resulting from
prejudice and further understands prejudice as comprising a cognitive component (stereotypes),
an affective component (aversion or dislike), and a behavioral component (discrimination aimed
at creating or enforcing social distance.) If we assume (as does social psychology theory) that
these components necessarily function as inseparable parts of an integrated whole, then the
presence of one can be assumed to evidence the others.” And what is true of “statements” must
be true of articulated policy - the faith group clusters which establish “Roman Catholic” as its
own “group” and define all other denominations (very very broadly) in terms of distance from
Catholic (see page 1174.)
25

Krieger (Ibid, p 1181) cites the “presumption of invidiousness” as “first articulated by
the Supreme Court in Furnco Construction Corp. V. Waters. The Court in Furnco stated: “[W]e
know from our experience that more often than not people do not act in a totally arbitrary
manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting. Thus, when all
legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the
employer’s actions, it is more likely than not the employer, whom we generally assume acts only
with some reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration such as race.”
And here, we infer, from the data, that that impermissible consideration is religion!

concealing Roman Catholic preference, providing beneficial terms of consideration to Roman
Catholics in particular, and facilitating discriminating against a broad range of denominations
who are buried in collections of dissimilar belief structures which are proxied (in a biased
manner) with a favored set of “representatives” (namely Southern Baptist, Presbyterian Church
of the USA (not the Presbyterian Church of America), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of
America (moreso than the Lutheran Missouri Synod) and the United Methodists (moreso than the
American Methodist Episcopals).
A5 Second, The Navy’s general statement about how it composes selection boards is more than
misleading; it is baldly incorrect. The SECNAVINST 1401.3 says nothing about “faith group
clusters”. In fact, ¶ 4(a) says that:
“... Exclusion from board membership by reason of gender, race, ethnic origin, or
religious affiliation is prohibited.”
¶5 says:
“Guidance on selection board representation in this instruction is not to be used to
sponsor any single interest, but is used to enhance the knowledge, experience, and
understanding of each board as a whole.”
A6 The Navy’s pattern of staffing selection boards is not comporting with this Instruction; it is
not even compliant with this Instruction; it violates it.
A7 One cannot populate selection boards, year after year for thirteen years (1988-2002), for
promotions to LCDR, CDR and Captain, and always get at least one Catholic on every board,
without considering religious affiliation - without contriving to include one Catholic.
A8 More than 25% of the selection board seats from 1977 to 2002 were given to a Roman
Catholic - thus appearing to use the Board staffing pattern to “sponsor a single interest”, in
apparent violation of both the SEC NAV instructions and a Constitutional prohibition on the
government’s adopting a position which endorses or facilitates one pattern of religious beliefs
over all others.
A9 Furthermore, one cannot populate selection boards, year after year for thirteen years, for
promotions to LCDR, CDR and Captain, choosing from more than 120 different denominations
and
•

Use just five denominations (Roman Catholic, Lutheran Church of America,
Presbyterian Church, USA, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist) to fill more
than 60% of all board seats,

•

never get even one chaplain from more than 80 disenfranchised denominations.

Random variation or chance26 cannot explain the Corps’ manifest preferences:
(1) to include one Roman Catholic on every Selection Board,
(2) to form a majority on every board with Catholics plus chaplains from a favored subset
of denominations (PUSA27, LCA, UM, and SB) and
(3) to limit participation for all other denominations to either token involvement, or no
involvement at all.

A11 One denomination (Roman Catholic) averages more than one seat per board - for
Promotion Boards, C/A/R/E Boards, and SER Boards28. Four denominations (PUSA, LCA, UM,
and SB) average between 3/4 and 1/3 of a seat per board. Five denominations average between
1/4 and 1/7th seats per board, while twenty seven denominations are given between a 10%
chance of being on a board and no chance of serving. Eighty four other denominations have no
participation in any Promotion Board - and endure more disadvantage than just exclusion.
A12 The statistical fact of bias in the Navy’s choice of which denominations to place on
Selection Boards is important for two reasons.
First, the pattern of preference for Roman Catholics, and to a lesser extent, for what might
be called four “mainstream” denominations, signals to members of those denominations
inside and outside the Navy that the Chaplain Corps is “sympathetic” to (only) those
belief structures - no wonder the data show that applications for Service in the Navy
Chaplain Corps are declining.
Second, as we have seen before (Leuba, Allonge 2005), and we shall see here in “the
Siskin Conjecture” (in the body of this declaration), the choice of which denominations to
place on the selection panels influences the decisions of those panels.

26

The odds against these patterns of bias are billions to one against. This cannot have
happend by chance; it cannot have “changed” by chance; it reflects intention. Is it not a violation
of both the SECNAV Instructions and a common sense reading of the U.S. Constitution?
27

PUSA is the Navy’s code for the Presbyterian Church of the United States; ELCA is
the code for the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America; UM stands for United Methodist, and
SB for Southern Baptist.
28

Although the Navy has produced some Continuation in Service Board decisions, in
response to a FOIA request (see Appendix D here). They have not produced in discovery, or in
the FOIA response, any information about board composition. It seems likely, in view of the
pattern across selection boards, SER boards, and C/A/R/E boards, that Catholics and the
“favorite” denominations would also have a majority of the seats on the Continuation Boards.

The following “pie charts”, graphs and appearance tables provide a view of:
(a) exactly how biased the Navy’s selection of denominations for service on its Promotion
Boards has been

and
(b) they also show how this pattern has changed, in what may look like a cynical attempt
to deal with “appearances” without actually addressing the core issues.
A14

This is the “two Catholic” period. 9
There were two
Roman Catholics
on every
promotion
Board, and two
or three
Liturgicals. The
Catholics and the
Liturgicals,
combined, had
virtually all the
votes.

A15 In 1987 the promotion panel staffing pattern was “voluntarily” changed, as part of a
settlement. “Two Catholics” on every board was changed to one Catholic and one Line Officer.
Note that after
this, change,
even in “faith
group cluster”
terms, the
representation
was still uneven.
Liturgicals
continued to be
over represented
- at the expense
of Non Baptists and Special Worship Chaplains who remained under represented.
A16 When the current litigation began (in CY1999), and concerns were raised again about
religious preference on Chaplain Corps Promotion Boards, the Navy broadened its representation
- somewhat. Line Officers became “major” participants in the process (counter-balancing or even
diluting the Chaplains’ influence) and the faith groups became more evenly represented:

Note that the cohort
(a) most ill treated in
terms of selection by
these boards, the
NON -BAPTIST
NON -LITURGICALS,
is still (b) the cohort
which is the most
ill-treated in terms of
representation
(i.e. having a “slice”
of the action) on
these Boards.
A17 While participation “spread” on a faith group cluster basis, most denominations still did
not benefit from the increased seating opportunities: 9

The charts above and the tables below demonstrate:
(1) The Chaplain Corps chose to maximize Catholic influence on its promotion boards
(and in Appendix B we will see that this preference held for SER29 Boards, and C/A/R/E
Boards, and presumably CADRAG Boards. These preference patterns were not
“accidental” nor the result of chance. They were intentional. Their manifest purpose was
to institutionalize Roman Catholic “influence” in the personnel management matters of the
U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps.
(2) When challenged (in 1986/87), the Chaplain Corps chose to maintain as much Roman
Catholic preference and control as possible. Instead of reducing Catholic influence from
33% (when there were two Catholics on a six Chaplain board) to 16% (by having only one
Catholic chaplain on a six Chaplain Board) the Navy kept Catholic influence as high as
possible, at 20% of the religious vote (with one Catholic and one Line Officer on a six
member board.)
(3) When confronted with the same “constitutional” argument again, in 1999, the Corps
adjusted its policies to minimize the “appearance” of undue (faith group) influence, but
explicitly reserved the “discretion” to assign Chaplains to Selection Boards ad lib including ex officio membership by the Chief of Chaplains on Promotion Boards, and
Community Division leaders on C/A/R/E and CADRAG boards.

A19 As we have seen before (Leuba, Compendium 2005) and report again (here, in the body of
this declaration), these are “practices and policies” which directly color the decisions made by
those boards.

Appendix C
The Navy’s “Ideal” mix of Denominations 1985-1993
Denomination Inventory Mix acdu and "ideal"
on date closest to 4 May 1990
1. Start reconstruction/estimate with Work Sheets for the period.
2. Use the entry dated closest to May 4, 1990 to capture acdu and "ideal"
on that date.
3. If there were no accession considerations for any given denomination in that
period, look back at 1989 (and then forward to 1990+)
4. Check Chaplain History Volume X for active duty service surrounding the 19891991 period for inventory in the period.

Development of Accession Plans
Military manpower planning begins with the “top” announcing to the “bottom” that it is about
time to report collective needs.
The President’s office informs the Secretary of Defense that the budget is to be submitted to
Congress on such and so a date.
The Secretary of Defense passes the information on to the Civilian leaders of the Services (e.g. the
Secretary of the Navy.)
The Service Secretaries pass the schedule to the Service Departments (providing references to: (a)
current overall change guidance and (b) last year’s FYDP [Five Year Defense Plan].)
The Chief of Naval Operations (e.g.) alerts the Branches, Divisions, “communities”, that the
cycle is underway.
The communities (e.g. the Chaplain Corps) begin with last year’s approved plan30. They examine
the implications of approved program changes (what drives requirements?) This informs the
Corps of how many additional, or fewer, chaplains they will require. Then they examine the
current inventory to estimate continuance and losses.
The Chaplain Corps keeps a larger proportion of its current cadre than does the average Navy
Community.31
In the Chaplain Corps, some losses:
•
•
C
C

are involuntary, but identifiable (e.g. statutory retirements)
are involuntary and estimable (accidents, transfers, resignations, voluntary retirements)
are discretionary (e.g. SER and Involuntary Retirement or not imposed on Officers who
have been passed over for promotion twice [See LAR0524]), and
some are statutorily driven (but can be waived with SecNav approval), e.g. retirement at
age 60 (or 62, or 68).

30

Typically the FYDP (the five year defense plan) is simply rolled forward by using last
year’s plan as a basis and adjusting this year with “pluses and minuses”. The last time, that I
know of, that the FYDP was looked at de novo, was when President Carter introduced “zero
based budgeting” in 1976.
31

“The Chaplain Corps has the highest retention rate in the Navy (92%) and the highest
continuation rate at the 6 to 11 year mark (67%) – 25% higher than the entire Navy.” All Navy
continuation at this point was 42%. [See LAR00524.]

The Chaplain Corps community manager reviews the then current Active Duty List. This is no
more burdensome a task that when a small university Registrars Office reviews the current list of
students to anticipate graduation rates and allowances for the incoming class. There are fewer
than 1000 records to review and they could be clustered by “year group”.
However, in planning accessions, the Chaplain Corps community manager does not review the
current Active Duty List by year group and rank based on career progression, he looks for losses
from the Active Duty List by Faith Group Cluster. (Career progression is planned collaterally.)
Losses are counted32 by faith group cluster.
Every community manger estimates current
accession requirements as:

Losses are tallied by Faith Group Category.
L The Navy manages Inventory
by Faith Group Category.

Gains = OPA - (BS ADL) - Losses.
Where:

Gains is the number of new acquisitions which the Community Manager will
recommend “up” the chain of command.
OPA is the Officer Programmed Authorization (the number of billets which will be
funded on 30 September in the new fiscal year);
BS ADL is the Begin Strength on the Active Duty List for this fiscal year,

and
Losses is the forecast or projected total loss anticipated for the coming fiscal year.
The Chaplain Corps community manager does his calculations in faith group cluster terms and
recommends a total number of acquisitions back up the chain of command, presenting faith group
cluster breakdown to the Chief of Chaplains33, who then submits the total (without faith group
cluster detail) to the Chief of Naval Operations, who then combines all the community
requirements and provides total manpower requirements estimates to the Secretary of the Navy,
and then to the Secretary of Defense. [When I worked for the Secretary of Defense/Systems
Analysis/Manpower I reviewed these submissions and made recommendations up my “chain of
command” on how to allocate or reallocate or count or estimate losses so as to minimize cost and
maximize management flexibility.]

32

The accession planning documents which have been produced show counts for
anticipated losses; DEFA00301 and DEFA00302 show actual tallies (tick marks in blocks of 5),
by faith group cluster for FY 93 and FY 94.

Following internal Department of Defense review, the budget is submitted to the President (where
it is reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget - it may be changed, or questioned there)
and then it is submitted to the Congress - where it may be further changed, by percentages or
specific increments.
After passage by the Congress and signature by the President, the authorizations are provided to
the Secretary of Defense, who informs the Services: (a) what their authorizations are and (b) what
their flexibilities are (or are not.) The Service Secretaries dis -aggregate the guidance they have
been given and the Chief of Naval Operations (e.g.), and then the Chiefs of the branches are
informed of their authorized end strength. When the authorization returns to the Chief of
Chaplains it is not identified by faith group or denomination. Those dimensions are reintroduced
when the guidance passes back down his chain of command to the community manager.
The guidance or “end strength” that comes back down to the community manager is not
necessarily the same figure as was sent up. The community manager makes adjustments to the
plan he originally submitted, to keep his/her totals in line with what was approved.
The Chaplain Corps community manager then drafts memoranda for the Chief of Chaplains to
sign and send to the “Commander Navy Recruiting Command” concerning how many chaplain
candidates to recruit, “with denomination/gender requirements as follows:” [See e.g. LAR0214.]
e.g.

Roman Catholic
Liturgical Protestant
Non-Liturgical Prot.
Jewish
Orthodox

8
12

The Chief of Chaplains thus “tasks” the Navy Recruiting Command to seek out a specified total
number of candidates, (a) for direct addition to the ADL (Active Duty List) , (b) for entrance into
the CCPO (Chaplain Candidate Program), and (c) for recruitment into the IRR (Individual Ready
Reserve), but the totals are:
•
•
and even
C

subdivided by program
subdivided by “denomination” and “gender”
subdivided by recruiting area
“to enable CNRC
(Commander, Naval
Recruiting Command) to
execute the tasking...”
[See LAR0214.]

The Chief of Chaplains orders replacements by
“denomination and gender.” [ See LAR0214.]

When the Chief of Chaplains orders six regional recruiters to collectively recruit, e.g. 66
Chaplains, one should not be surprised if each area thinks of its own goal as “11" [cf LAR019602047].
Similarly, if the requirement for the IRR is 12 Liturgicals, each Area will think of itself as “on the
hook” for 2 candidates. My point here is not: “which among these areas accepts responsibility for
recruiting the 1 Orthodox?” My point here is that the recruiters are told that there are quotas in
effect.
Should we think the recruiters ignore this instruction when we use the distribution of
denominations submitted to the C/A/R/E Board as the baseline distribution of those “available to
serve”? My own opinion here is that the “population available to serve” is the population which
presented itself to the recruiters. What they pass along to the C/A/R/E group is already screened
by the recruiters - based on the (quota) instructions they received from the Chief of Chaplains.
Not only does the C/A/R/E Advisory Group receive quotas as figures against which they monitor
their collective recommendations, but the recruiters also receive quotas to guide them in their
efforts. This is a two stage, quota-based culling.
The Chaplain Corps community manager:
•
Uses faith group and denomination to count losses, and then
•
Uses faith group and denomination to establish accession goals
and then
•

Manipulates those goals so that the mix of denominations and faith groups which end up
in the Chaplain Corps is specifically different than the mix of denominations and faith
groups which presented themselves for Service.
(1) The quotas are set, percentage wise, so that the percentages designated/allowed for
Catholics and Liturgicals are in excess of the percentages of those available to serve who
are Catholic and Liturgical (maximizing their likelihood of selection), while the quota
percentage designated/allowed for Non-Liturgicals is well below the percentage of those
available to serve who are Non-Liturgical (curtailing every Non-Liturgical’s likelihood of
Selection).34
(2) The quotas change over time to increase Liturgical representation and decrease NonLiturgical participation in the Corps. Under normal “community” manpower planning,

34

If the applicant pool is 26.9% Liturgical, a quota set at 35% guarantees that no
qualified candidate will be rejected; on the other hand, if the applicant pool is 44% NonLiturgical, a quota set at 35% guarantees that 20% of the applicants will be rejected, simply by
operation of the quota.

each year’s manpower requirements are based on mission changes to a base line and
replacements for those who leave Active Duty. But in the Chaplain Corps, there is a
systematic, insidious drift in the planned accessions [see LAR0018 to LAR00023]:

This is not maintenance of the status quo; it is planned control of the denominational
distribution of the chaplains on Active Duty35 - to favor both Roman Catholics and
Liturgicals in excess of their availability in the population of those offering themselves for
Service, and to the detriment of Non-Liturgicals presenting themselves for service as Navy
Chaplains.

The specific effect of the Chaplain Corps community manager’s faith group cluster quotas, and
their manipulation, has been to place an impediment in the path of Non-Liturgical candidates in
particular with respect to service in the Chaplain Corps. The general effect of the quotas has been
to facilitate within cluster denominational discrimination for both the Liturgical and the NonLiturgical candidates.
Note that (a) even if these plans were not carried out, or could not be carried out because there
were too few well qualified applicants, (b) it is still the case (1) that this is what the plans were
and (2) that the Corps as a whole has been successful at “preferring” Catholics and Liturgicals and
marginalizing Non-Liturgicals.

35

The Chaplain Corps’ input to the FYDP puts twice the pressure (quota) on NonLiturgicals that it does on Roman Catholics. The average RC gain programmed for this period
(1990 to 1997) is 147% of the losses; for Non-Liturgicals it is just 76% of the losses. This is a
formula for increasing, and evidence of an intention to increase, or at least maintain the Roman
Catholic "share" of the Corps and to reduce the Non-Liturgical "share".

“Promotion” is NOT Accurately Characterized in Navy Pleadings
F.1 Defendants (a) couch their data in terms of faith group clusters (which conceals within
cluster discrimination) and (b) they ignore their own decisions to curtail the pool of candidates to
be considered for promotion.
F.2 Plaintiffs have repeatedly drawn attention to Non-Liturgical candidates missing in the
Navy’s pattern of promotion data36:

F.3 At each step up the promotion ladder, the ratio of Liturgical to Non-Liturgical candidates
being considered systematically increases, from parity at LCDR to 105% at CDR and 123% at
CAPT - favoring the Liturgical Candidates. This pattern is statistically significant (p<.001).

36

This data originates from the Navy. They provided it to the Center for Naval Analysis
(CNA) and used it in an Exhibit, #28 (copy attached). Plaintiffs quote the data from the CNA
study (Smith et al, 2000). Defendants point to the percent selected at the promotion board stage,
but do not address changes in the likelihood of being considered for promotion. Plaintiffs point
to (1) a statistically significant preference for Catholic selection at the CDR level and (2) the
systematic loss of Non-Liturgical candidates at every increase in rank.

F.4 The selection rates, among those considered, based of faith group clusters, may seem on a
par across ranks, if one looks only at the Promotion Board action, but the CADRAG37 Board
action is a precursor event; if one wishes to be considered for promotion with one’s peers, it is
first necessary that one be allowed to continue to serve on Active Duty.
F.5 Defendants have belittled Plaintiffs concern about chaplains missing from the pools of
those considered for promotion. They even disingenuously (since they had the CADRAG data)
suggested in open court that “maybe they (the Non-Liturgicals) have family issues”38.
F.6 In their pleadings, Defendants have brushed aside Plaintiffs’ concerns about missing
candidates, suggesting that because Plaintiffs did not explain (to the Navy’s satisfaction) why or
how the Non-Liturgicals were disappearing, that the issue was a red herring.39
F.7 Such brusque and dismissive representation may be “understood” in some quarters as
merely over zealous advocacy (Peterson and Conley, 2001), but given what the Navy must know
about its own system, the defense strategy here strikes me as deceptive. The Navy knows where
these missing Non-Liturgical candidates have gone. A Freedom of Information Request has
located them (see above.) They are being systematically refused an opportunity to stay in the
Corps.
F.8 It is well established in employment discrimination litigation that the whole pathway
between putting ones name into the hat and being promoted is the proper domain to examine, and
that focus on only one narrow step in the entire process is frequently (intentionally) misleading.
F.9 A defendant may not rebut allegations of discrimination in promotion by quoting statistics
about who is promoted, while ignoring data about who is considered for promotion.
The Navy pretends that flow points and facially neutral objective time in grade
requirements determine eligibility for promotion consideration, but the Navy ignores
(conceals, “forgets”, fails to acknowledge or discuss) that prior to establishing the lists of
who will and will not be “considered” for promotion, a selection panel convenes to decide
who will and will not be allowed to stay on Active Duty.

37

CADRAG is the acronym for the Chaplain Corps Active Duty Retention/Release
Advisory Group - a board which considers whether or not to allow continuation on active duty of
chaplains who wish to stay in service.

Data Source: (1) Navy C/A/R/E Data 1986 to 2005; (2) & (4) Chaplain’s History 1982 to 1991; (3) Discovery - See
Appendix D- CDRs 1988 to 2001 in Compendium (Leuba 2005); (5) = (4)/(2). The data periods are not identical; but
all the Chaplains are “similarly situated” cohorts and all ratios are commensurable.

and comment (a) that this in not a “promotion study” and then (b) feign wonderment at the
number of chaplains (they) lost (Column 2-Column 3) for “consideration.”
F.11 This is standard statistical information for employment discrimination. The “feeder
group” (column 1) is a central factor in determining “similarly situated” candidates for promotion.
F.12
as:

The probability of “promotion” for these similarly situated candidates may be estimated

PPromotion,i = PCARE,i * PCADRAG,i * PSelection|Consideration,i
Where:
i
PPromotion,i

is an index for a denomination under consideration
is the probability that an applicant from denomination i will
be promoted (eventually)
is the probability of C/A/R/E approval for denomination i
is the probability of CADRAG approval for denomination i.

PCARE,i
PCADRAG,i
and
PSelection|Consideration,i

is the likelihood of Selection for Promotion for denomination i,
if denomination i is considered for promotion.

F.13 Table F.2 uses Navy Data to present results for a representative sample of denominations.
The “distinguishing factor” between (i) the denominations: Catholic, Presbyterian Church USA,
and Southern Baptist on the one hand and (ii) Presbyterian Church of America and Chaplaincy of
Full Gospel Churches on the other hand, is that denominations in (i) are allowed to sit on the
promotion and selection boards and denominations in (ii) are not.

Conclusion
F.14 Clearly, denomination affects a Chaplain candidate’s opportunities for and likelihood of
promotion.
F.15

Not only does Pselection|Consideration,i vary with denomination even in Dr. Siskin’s data for 1992 to 2002, when one removes the obfuscation and
discrimination facilitation inherent in the faith group cluster system,

but the denominations also suffer differential continuation rates, CADRAG, as well as quota
controlled Accession opportunities, CARE.
F.16 To represent that Promotion decisions are not contaminated by denominational
consideration is a material distortion of the facts, and a willful disregard of data known to (or
which should have been known to) the Navy’s advocates:
(a) accession rates as measurable from the CCPO program in the data base the Navy
prepared for their expert, Dr. Bernard Siskin,

in Service Board records the Navy produced in response to a FOIA request,
and

IN RE: NAVY CHAPLAINCY

Case No. 1: 07-mc-269 (RMU)

[Proposed] ORDER
Before the Court is Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s
previous ruling denying thier appeal of the Magistrate Judge’s Order that Title did not bar
selective early retirement (SER) board discovery, due to recent legislative changes to 10 U.S.C. §
613. Plaintiffs oppose because §613 does not bar RFRA claims and does not contain the specific
language Congress requires to bar claims of constitutional misconduct and § 613. For the
reasons stated in Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Defendants’ Motion IS DENIED.
Defendants are hereby ordered to release SER board personnel from their oaths of secrecy
immediately. The parties are further ordered to present to the Court a plan for protecting
privileged information from public disclosure. Parties will submit their plan to the Court within
___ days.
So ORDERED this ____ day of ___, 2007.
