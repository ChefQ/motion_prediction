Misc. Action No. 07mc269 (RMU)

DEFENDANTS’ RENEWED MOTION TO RECONSIDER ORDER DENYING
APPEAL OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S ORDER AND FOR A PROTECTIVE
ORDER AGAINST DISCOVERY OF SELECTIVE-EARLY-RETIREMENT
BOARD DELIBERATIONS
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and based upon the newly-enacted 10
U.S.C. § 613a and 14104, defendants respectfully renew their motion to reconsider the Court’s
September 11, 2006, Opinion and Order [CFGC v. Winter, No. 99-2945 (RMU), docket nos. 234-35;
Adair v. Winter, No. 00-566 (RMU), docket nos. 173-74] denying their appeal and objections to the
Magistrate Judge’s March 8, 2006, ruling [CFGC docket nos. 215-16; Adair docket nos. 151-52] and
allowing plaintiffs discovery of selective-early retirement board deliberations. Further, defendants
move for entry of a protective order against such discovery pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure 26 and 37.
Defendants filed their first motion to reconsider the Court’s orders on February 5, 2007, in
CFGC and Adair. [See CFGC docket no. 241] On June 18, 2007, the Court issued an order
consolidating Adair, CFGC, and Gibson v. United States Navy, No. 06-1696 (RMU), into this
miscellaneous matter. See Order dated June 18, 2007 [In re Navy Chaplaincy docket no. 1]. The
Court also denied without prejudice all pending motions and granted the parties leave to re-file them
in this new miscellaneous action. See id. Per the Court’s instructions, defendants renew their
motion to reconsider with this filing.
As more fully explained in the accompanying memorandum, an intervening change in law

enacted by Congress has now made it clear that the deliberations of statutory selection boards are
not to be disclosed absent consent of the Secretary of the Navy. 10 U.S.C. §§ 613a, 14104. Exhibits
and a proposed order also accompany this motion.
Pursuant to LCvR 7(m), undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for plaintiffs regarding
this motion. Counsel for plaintiffs stated that plaintiffs oppose this motion.

INTRODUCTION
Shortly after this Court upheld the Magistrate Judge’s ruling that plaintiffs may have
discovery of the deliberations of Navy chaplain selective-early retirement (“SER”) boards, Congress
amended Title 10 to unequivocally prohibit the disclosure of selection board deliberations absent the
consent of the Secretary of the Navy. This amendment is consistent with Congress’s and the Navy’s
longstanding determination to protect the critical role played by selection boards in the promotion
and retention of officers, an area in which the Judiciary owes substantial deference to Congress and
the Executive. Because “[s]election board members will be less likely to engage in frank and open
discussion if such discussions will be open to public scrutiny,” disclosure of their deliberations
would “clearly inhibit frank assessment of candidates’ relative strengths and weaknesses.” In re
England, 375 F.3d 1169, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Decl.
of Gordon R. England, Secretary of the Navy, originally filed as Tab H to Defs.’ Opp. to Pls.’ Mot.
for Order [CFGC v. Winter, No. 99-2945 (RMU), docket no. 124] (copy at Defs.’ Ex. 1) (“England
Decl.”) at ¶ 9. Thus, Congress has protected the ability of selection boards to make proper
recommendations by prohibiting civil discovery of selection board deliberations.
Congress’s decision to protect the confidentiality of SER board deliberations is dispositive
and requires the Court to deny plaintiffs discovery of SER board deliberations. The Court should
therefore vacate its previous orders allowing discovery of SER board deliberations and enter a
protective order against such discovery.
RELEVANT BACKGROUND
This case consolidates three pending cases: CFGC v. Winter, No. 99-2945 (RMU), Adair v.
Winter, No. 00-566 (RMU), and Gibson v. United States Navy, No. 06-1696 (RMU). Plaintiffs in
these actions are non-liturgical Protestant chaplains who allege that the Navy illegally and

-1-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 2

Filed 07/09/2007

Page 10 of 21

systemically discriminates against non-liturgical Protestant chaplains in favor of liturgical Protestant
and Roman Catholic chaplains in promotions, retention, and accessions. Plaintiffs also allege that
non-liturgical Protestant chaplains have been discriminated against through the Navy’s alleged
favoring of a “general Protestant service” and by its alleged restriction of non-liturgical forms of
religious services.
A more thorough history of the litigation in Adair and CFGC regarding the discoverability
of selection board deliberations is recounted in Defendants’ Objections to and Motion to Reconsider
Magistrate Judge’s Opinion [CFGC docket no. 219]. In summary, upon appeal of this Court’s Order
allowing plaintiffs discovery of selection board deliberations, see 9/2/03 Opinion and Order [CFGC
docket no. 164], published at Adair v. England, 217 F.R.D. 250 (D.D.C. 2003), the Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit found that 10 U.S.C. § 618(f) “block[s] civil discovery of promotion selection
board proceedings in civil litigation” and remanded for a determination of whether SER board
deliberations are discoverable. In re England, 375 F.3d at 1181-82. On March 8, 2006, Magistrate
Judge John M. Facciola issued an Order and Opinion finding that plaintiffs are entitled to discovery
of SER board deliberations. 3/8/2006 Order and Mem. Op. [CFGC docket nos. 215-16]. On
September 11, 2006, this Court denied defendants’ appeal of the Magistrate Judge’s findings.
9/11/06 Order and Mem. Op. [CFGC docket nos. 234-35], published at Adair v. Winter, 451 F.
Supp.2d 202 (D.D.C. 2006) (“9/11/06 Order I”).
On October 17, 2006, the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2007, H.R. 5122, 109th Cong. (2006); Pub. L. No. 109-364, § 547, 120 Stat. 2216. Section 547
of that Act provides a “clarification” of the nondisclosure requirement by amending Title 10 to state
unequivocally that the deliberations of boards convened under 10 U.S.C. §§ 611 and 14101,
including SER boards, are protected from civil discovery. Specifically, Congress replaced 10 U.S.C.

Page 11 of 21

§ 618(f) with 10 U.S.C. § 613a, which states:
§ 613a. Nondisclosure of Board Proceedings
(a) Nondisclosure – The proceedings of a selection board convened
under section 611 this title may not be disclosed to any person not a
member of the board.
(b) Prohibited uses of board discussions, deliberations, and records.–
The discussions and deliberations of a selection board described in
subsection (a) and any written or documentary record of such
discussions and deliberations –
(1) are immune from legal process;
(2) may not be admitted as evidence; and
(3) may not be used for any purpose in any action, suit, or
judicial or administrative proceeding without the consent of
the Secretary of the military department concerned.
10 U.S.C. § 613a; Pub. L. No. 109-364, § 547, 120 Stat. 2216. Congress enacted a similar provision
for reserve-duty boards. 10 U.S.C. § 14104; Pub. L. No. 109-364, § 547, 120 Stat. 2216. Congress
further stated that these provisions “shall apply with respect to the proceedings of all selection
boards” convened under 10 U.S.C §§ 611 and 14101, “including selection boards convened before
the date of the enactment of this Act.” Pub. L. No. 109-364, § 547(c), 120 Stat. 2216.
The Court stayed Adair and CFGC by Minute Order on October 20, 2006. The Court lifted
the stay by Minute Order on January 24, 2007. Defendants filed their first motion to reconsider on
February 5, 2007. [See CFGC docket no. 241]
On June 18, 2007, the Court issued an order consolidating Adair, CFGC, and Gibson into this
miscellaneous matter. See Order dated June 18, 2007 [In re Navy Chaplaincy docket no. 1]. The
Court also denied without prejudice all pending motions and granted the parties leave to re-file them
in this new miscellaneous action. See id. Per the Court’s instructions, defendants renew their
motion with this filing.
ARGUMENT
Rule 54 permits a court to revise its interlocutory orders “at any time before the entry of

-3-

Page 12 of 21

judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.” Fed. R. Civ. P.
54(b); see also Judicial Watch v. Dep’t of Army, 466 F. Supp.2d 112, 123 (D.D.C. 2006); Burlington
Ins. Co. v. Okie Dokie, Inc., 439 F. Supp.2d 124, 131 (D.D.C. 2006); Cobell v. Norton, 224 F.R.D.
266, 271-72 (D.D.C. 2004). Reconsideration of prior orders is under the standard “as justice
requires,” which involves consideration of “whether the court ‘has patently misunderstood a party,
has made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the [c]ourt by the parties, has made
an error not of reasoning, but of apprehension, or where a controlling or significant change in the law
or facts [has occurred] since submission of the issue to the court.’” Judicial Watch, 466 F. Supp.2d
at 123 (quoting Cobell, 224 F.R.D. at 272); see also Burlington Ins., 439 F. Supp.2d at 131-32;
McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Nat'l Aeronautics & Space Admin., 109 F. Supp.2d 27, 28 (D.D.C.
2000) (court has broad discretion to amend prior decision if it finds, inter alia, “an intervening
change in controlling law”). This standard “amounts to determining ‘whether reconsideration is
necessary under the relevant circumstances.’” Judicial Watch, 466 F. Supp.2d at 123 (quoting Singh
v. George Wash. Univ., 383 F. Supp.2d 99, 101 (D.D.C. 2005)).
Further, a party is not entitled to discovery of privileged information. Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(b)(1); U.S. ex rel. Purcell v. MWI Corp., 209 F.R.D. 21, 24 (D.D.C. 2002). The court may enter
a protective order against impermissible discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2), (c) id. Rule
37(a)(4)(B) (court may enter protective order upon denial of motion to compel). In light of the
intervening changes in law contained in 10 U.S.C. §§ 613a and 14104, the Court should exercise its
discretion to reconsider the 9/11/06 Order I and enter a protective order prohibiting any discovery
of SER board deliberations.

SECTIONS 613a AND 14104 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT DISCLOSURE OF SER BOARD
DELIBERATIONS ABSENT CONSENT BY THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY .
Analysis of whether Title 10 prohibits civil discovery of SER board deliberations “begin[s]

with the plain language of the statute.” In re England, 375 F.3d at 1177; see also Baldrige v.
Shapiro, 455 U.S. 345, 356 (1982). “It is well established that ‘when the statute’s language is plain,
the sole function of the courts – at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd – is
to enforce it according to its terms.’” In re England, 375 F.3d at 1177 (quoting Lamie v. United
States, 540 U.S. 526 (2004); see also Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 362 (Congress’s statutory mandate “to
be followed by the courts”).
In Sections 613a and 14104, the plain language of subsection (a) states that selection board
deliberations “may not be disclosed to any person not a member of the board.” 10 U.S.C. §§
613a(a), 14104(a). This is the same language as that reviewed in In re England and found to prohibit
disclosure of promotion board deliberations. 375 F.3d. at 1177. The D.C. Circuit found that such
language “is the language of command – ‘may not be disclosed’ – in a context in which commands
are expected to be obeyed. There is no inherent ambiguity in the phrase ‘may not be disclosed’ that
would justify departing from those plain terms pursuant to a judicially-crafted exception.” Id.
Although this language is alone sufficient to prohibit discovery, the new statutes go further by stating
that all discussions and written records “are immune from legal process; . . . may not be admitted as
evidence; and . . . may not be used for any purpose in any action, suit, or judicial . . . proceeding
without the consent of the Secretary of the military department concerned.” 10 U.S.C. §§ 613a(b),
14014(b). This plain language functions exactly as the statute at issue in In re England – to prohibit
the disclosure of deliberations by the relevant selection boards, which now includes SER boards.
This conclusion is “fortified by the fact that Congress provided an express exception to the

-5-

Document 2

Filed 07/09/2007

Page 14 of 21

otherwise categorical ban on disclosure.” In re England, 375 F.3d at 1177. “When Congress
provides exceptions in a statute, it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.”
United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 58 (2000); see also In re England, 375 F.3d at 1178.
Subsection (b) of the new statutes set forth statutory exceptions, which allow disclosure only with
the consent of the Secretary of the Navy. Not only do these exceptions lack any provision for
disclosure in discovery, they foreclose such disclosure. The Court therefore may not “imply an
additional exception.” See In re England, 375 F.3d at 1178 (citing Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n
v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 109 (1980)).
Congress also meant to apply Sections 613a and 14104 to the SER board deliberations at
issue here. “When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court’s first
task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach. If
Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.” Landgraf v. USI
Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994). Congress unambiguously stated that Sections 613a and
14104 “shall apply with respect to the proceedings of all selection boards” convened under 10 U.S.C.
§§ 611 and 14101, “including selection boards convened before the date of enactment of this Act.”
Pub. L. No. 109-364, § 547(c), 120 Stat. 2216. Again, this is the “language of command” and allows
no exception for civil discovery related to boards already the subject of a suit. Cf. In re England, 375
F.3d. at 1177. Further, Congress’s enactment of these statutes as a “clarification” demonstrates its
intent to apply the statutes to existing cases, because a clarification is a statement “of what
[Congress] believed the law already was, and thus to be applicable to all cases, past, present and
future.” Means v. Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court, 154 F.3d 941, 951 (9th Cir.1998) (Reinhardt,
J., concurring), overruled on other grounds, United States v. Enas, 255 F.3d 662 (9th Cir. 2001); see
also Beverly Community Hosp. Ass'n v. Belshe, 132 F.3d 1259, 1264 (9th Cir. 1997) (“Congress’

Page 15 of 21

characterization [of a new act as a clarification] plainly reflects its intention to resolve every still-live
dispute in the manner specified by the new legislation.”).
Application of Sections 613a and 14104 to these cases is also proper because the statutes do
not affect any parties’ substantive rights, but are instead procedural rules of evidence that govern
what information may be discovered and presented and are therefore applicable to pending cases.
See Hill v. Sandhu, 129 F.R.D. 548, 549-50 (D. Kan. 1990) (finding that statutory privilege applied
to documents created before statute’s passage because statute “does not impair the substantive law
of the underlying action”); see also Samuelson v. Susen, 576 F.2d 546, 551 (3d Cir. 1978) (under
state law, statutory privilege enacted after suit initiated applied to discovery because statute regulated
admission of evidence and was therefore procedural).
“‘[W]here the terms of a statute are unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete.’” In re
England, 375 F.3d at 1178 (quoting Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 642 (1990)).
However, where the legislative history is “instructive,” it may be cited as support for the conclusion
that the analysis of a statute’s plain language and its scope is correct. See id. at 1178; see also
Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 356 (Supreme Court looked to legislative history to support conclusion that
Census Act created privilege for certain census records); Pierce County, Wash. v. Guillen, 537 U.S.
129, 146 (2003) (citing legislative history to support interpretation of statutory privilege).
Here, “nothing in that [legislative] history remotely suggests that Congress intended an
unexpressed exception to the ban on disclosure for civil discovery.” See In re England, 375 F.3d at
1178. The Secretary of the Navy relies on SER board deliberations to engage in “[f]ree, uninhibited,
and candid deliberations” to make subjective evaluations of naval officer records in determining
which officers should be retired in accordance with the needs of the Navy. England Decl. ¶ 9.
Confidentiality of SER board deliberations is essential to ensure that SER board recommendations
-7-

are “based on full, frank, and independent advice and analyses.” Id.; see also In re England, 375 F.3d
at 1178 (adopting Secretary’s rationale); 9/11/06 Opinion and Order [CFGC docket nos. 232-33],
published at Adair v. Winter, 451 F. Supp.2d 210 (D.D.C. 2006) (“9/11/06 Order II”) at 21 (citing
discussion in In re England).
Consistent with these interests, a Report in the House of Representatives stated that Sections
613a and 14104 “clarify that selection board proceedings regarding promotion, retention, retirement,
separation, and other personnel actions shall not be disclosed to any person who is not a board
member and board records shall be immune from legal process, not be admitted as evidence, and not
used for any judicial or administrative proceeding without the consent of the secretary concerned.”
H.R. Rep. 109-452, § 532 at 322, 2006 WL 1232223 (2006) (relevant pages at Defs.’ Ex. 2). In
debate on a similar proposal addressing promotion board deliberations, a Senate report stated that
“existing policies” of the military and “oversight exercised by senior military and civilian officials
. . . provide necessary safeguards and are effective in ensuring that promotion selection board
members fulfill their duty under law to recommend the best qualified officers for promotion.” S.
Rep. 109-254 § 518, at 315, 2006 WL 1310468 (2006) (relevant pages at Defs.’ Ex. 3). The Senate
Report also stated that “[e]rosion over time of the limits on judicial review and discovery in
connection with litigation have not been consistent with the statutory framework and military
necessity.” Id. Further, the Senate has interpreted the former 10 U.S.C. § 618(f), which provided
instruction similar to the new statutes, as necessary to “encourage candid discussions free from
outside interference.” S. Rep. 102-482 at 2, 1992 WL 311856 (1992) (relevant pages at Defs.’ Ex.
4). Like the statute’s plain language, this legislative history demonstrates Congress’s expectation
that the new statutes prohibit civil discovery of SER board deliberations.

CONGRESS IS EMPOWERED TO ENACT A STATUTORY PRIVILEGE PROTECTING MILITARY
SELECTION BOARD DELIBERATIONS FROM CIVIL DISCOVERY DESPITE ANY ASSERTION
BY PLAINTIFFS OF NEED FOR SUCH DISCOVERY .
“It is well recognized that a privilege may be created by statute.” Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 360;

see also Fed. R. Evid. 501 (recognizing privileges “provided by Act of Congress”). In Baldrige, the
Court cited Congress’s constitutional authority to conduct the census as authorizing enactment of
a privilege against disclosure of certain census records. See Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 361 (power to
create statutory privilege protecting census information is “within congressional discretion, for
Congress is vested by the Constitution with authority to conduct the census ‘as they shall by Law
direct’”). Further, in Pierce County, the Supreme Court held that a federal statute protecting certain
information collected by states regarding road conditions was validly enacted pursuant to Congress’s
authority under the Commerce Clause. 537 U.S. at 146-48.
Here, the Constitution grants to Congress the power to regulate the military. U.S. Const. art.
I, § 8, cl. 14 (Congress is “[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
forces.”). Further, Congress is entitled to substantial deference in its management of military
personnel. See, e.g., United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 681-82 & n.6 (1987) (distinctive
element of Constitution’s treatment of military is “specificity” of “grant of power” and “insistence
(evident from the number of clauses devoted to the subject) with which the Constitution confers
authority over the [military] upon the political branches”); Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973)
(Constitution vests “complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training,
equipping, and control of a military force” exclusively in legislative and executive branches); Orloff
v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 93-94 (1953) (“[J]udges are not give the task of running the [military]”).
Thus, it is for Congress to weigh any competing interests and decide whether a statutory
privilege will better enable the Navy’s officer promotion and retention systems to function. See
-9-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 362 (“Congress, of course, can authorize disclosure in executing its
constitutional obligation . . . . But until Congress alters [the statutory privilege], its mandate is to
be followed by the courts.”); 9/11/06 Order II at 19 n. 13 (statutory privilege represents conclusion
by political branches that “interests furthered by the privilege outweighs the ‘normally predominant
principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.’” (quoting Trammel v. United States,
445 U.S. 40, 50-51 (1980)). Here, Congress’s determination that the deliberations of all selection
boards should be protected from disclosure is binding on this Court.
Plaintiffs have, in the past, argued that they need discovery of SER board deliberations and
that Congress lacks power to deny them discovery of selection board deliberations. See, e.g., Pls.’
Opp. Mot. Reconsideration [CFGC docket no. 253]. This Court has already rejected such arguments.
In upholding the former Section 618(f)’s application to promotion board deliberations, this Court
found that there is “no general constitutional right to statutorily privileged evidence essential to
establishing a constitutional claim” 9/11/06 Order II at 2; id. at 12, 17. Instead, a “finding of
‘privilege’ . . . shields the requested information from disclosure despite the need demonstrated by
the litigant.” Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 362; In re England, 375 F.3d at 1180 (quoting same). In any
event, Sections 613a and 14104 do not deny plaintiffs any information essential to proving their
claims. Cf. 9/11/06 Order II at 15-16 (finding that discovery of promotion board deliberations would
not produce evidence that was “necessary element of a claim of religious discrimination,”); id. at 16
(citing alternative evidence available to plaintiffs).
Nor do the new statutes deny plaintiffs a judicial forum for their claims. Although Sections
613a and 14104 bar discovery of SER board deliberations, plaintiffs “remain free to litigate their
discrimination claims and to support them with other evidence.” In re England, 375 F.3d at 1180
n.2 (rejecting similar argument as applied to 10 U.S.C. § 618(f)); 9/11/06 Order II at 10 (former

Section 618(f) “merely restricts the evidence available to plaintiffs in support of their claims.”).
III.

EVEN IF THE COURT COULD CONSIDER PLAINTIFFS’ NEED FOR DISCOVERY , THE COURT
SHOULD REQUIRE A HEIGHTENED SHOWING OF NEED IN LIGHT OF CONGRESS’S
ENACTMENT OF THE NEW STATUTES, A SHOWING PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO MAKE.
Finally, even if plaintiffs’ need could be considered, plaintiffs have failed to show sufficient

justification to overcome the congressionally-recognized interest in non-disclosure. Congress’s clear
instruction that selection board deliberations should not be disclosed or used in judicial proceedings
absent the Secretary’s consent, if not an absolute privilege, at a minimum requires plaintiffs to
overcome a very strong presumption against disclosure before obtaining discovery of SER board
deliberations. Cf. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 465 (1996) (in context of criminal
prosecutions, holding that “to dispel the presumption that a prosecutor has not violated equal
protection, a criminal defendant must present ‘clear evidence to the contrary’” (quoting United States
v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926)).
As recounted multiple times in this litigation, the Secretary of the Navy relies on SER board
deliberations to engage in “[f]ree, uninhibited, and candid deliberations” to make subjective
evaluations of naval officer records in determining which officers should be retired in accordance
with the needs of the Navy. England Decl. at ¶ 9; see, supra, Part I. Confidentiality of SER board
deliberations is essential to ensure that SER board recommendations are “based on full, frank, and
independent advice and analyses.” England Decl. ¶ 9; see also In re England, 375 F.3d at 1178
(adopting Secretary’s rationale); 9/11/06 Order II at 21 (citing discussion in In re England). The
legislative history of sections 618(f), 613a, and 14104 confirms that Congress sought to protect the
integrity of these deliberations when it enacted the privilege. See, supra, Part I. Further, because
it is disclosure itself that would chill future deliberations, routine use of measures short of a
protective order barring any discovery would not prevent the harm to future deliberations that
-11-

Case 1:07-mc-00269-RMU

Document 2

Filed 07/09/2007

Page 20 of 21

Congress sought to prevent. Cf. In re England, 375 F.3d at 1178 (stating that “[s]election board
members will be less likely to engage in frank and open discussion if such discussions will be open
to public scrutiny” and disclosure would “clearly inhibit frank assessment of candidates’ relative
strengths and weaknesses” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
As defendants have previously argued, plaintiffs have not shown sufficient justification for
discovery of SER boards to support their contention that the Navy imposes quotas upon nonliturgical Protestant chaplains under consideration for early retirement. See, e.g., Mem. in Supp. of
Defs.’Mot. Reconsider Mag. Judge’s Opinion [CFGC docket no. 219] (“Defs.’ Mot. Reconsider”)
at 12-25; Reply in Support of Defs.’ Mot. Reconsider Mag. Judge’s Opinion [CFGC docket no. 226]
(“Defs.’ Mot. Reconsider Reply”) at 10-18.

This is especially so because analysis of

recommendations by SER board members shows that SER boards did not recommend non-liturgical
Protestant chaplains at rates different to any statistically significant degree than rates for other
chaplains. Defs.’ Mot. Reconsider at 16-22 (and exhibits cited therein). Further, this Court found
that, in the context of plaintiffs’ similar promotion claims, discovery of board deliberations is not
essential to proving their claims. See 9/11/06 Order II at 15-16 (finding that discovery of promotion
board deliberations would not produce evidence that was “necessary element of a claim of religious
discrimination”); id. at 16 (citing alternative evidence available to plaintiffs).
Although the Court previously ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to discovery of SER board
deliberations despite defendants’ relevance objection and assertion of the deliberative process
privilege,1 Congress’s decision to enact sections 613a and 14104 at the least provides reason to find

1

Defendants also preserve for subsequent review their objection to the discovery of SER board
deliberations as irrelevant, protected by the deliberative process privilege, and prohibited by
statutorily-authorized naval regulation.
-12-

that the government’s interest in non-disclosure outweighs any need by plaintiffs for discovery of
SER board deliberations.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, defendants request that this Court vacate its 9/11/06 Order
I, reverse the Magistrate Judge’s March 3, 2006 Opinion and Order, and enter a protective order
prohibiting plaintiffs any discovery of SER board deliberations.

SUBTITLE D--GENERAL SERVICE AUTHORITIES

Section 531--Test of Utility of Test Preparation Guides and Education Programs in Enhancing Recruit Candidate Performance on
the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and
Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)
This section would require the Secretary of Defense to administer
a test program conducted by the secretaries of the military departments to determine the utility of commercially available test preparation guides and education programs to assist recruit candidates
in achieving improved scores on military recruit qualification tests.
The Secretary would identify 2,000 recruit candidates to receive
test preparation assistance and a like number of recruit candidates
to participate hi a control group to allow comparisons of test performance and subsequent duty performance in training and unit
settings following active duty entry. The Secretary would begin the
test within nine months following the date of enactment of this Act.
The test would identflfy participants over a !-year period from the
start of the test and shall assess duty performance for each participant for 18 months following entry on active duty.
The committee has observed that there are many self-paced, computer assisted, and instructor led options for providing test preparation assistance for recruit qualification tests. The committee is
interested in exploring the potential that these test preparation
guides and education programs offer for the military to assist recrnit candidates to achieve higher and more accurate aptitude and
qualification scores. The committee believes that the test program
proposed in this section would allow the Secretary to determine if
test preparation assistance can be reliably used to improve the
process by which recruits are placed in specialties and increase the
number of youth that qualify for entry into the armed forces.
Section 532--Nondisclosure of Selection Board Proceedings
This section would clarify that selection board proceedings regarding promotion, retention, retirement, separation, and other
personnel actions shall not be disclosed to any person who is not
a board member and board records shall be immune from legal
process, not be admitted as evidence, and not used for any judicial
or administrative proceeding without the consent of the secretary
concerned.
Section 533--Report on Extent of Provision of Timely Notice of
Long-Term Deployments
This section would require the Secretary of Defense to report on
the number of members of the Armed Forces who, since September
11, 2001, have not received at least 30-days notice prior to a deployment that was scheduled to last 180 days or more. This section
would require the report be made to the Senate Committee on
Armed Services and the House Committee on Armed Services no
later than March 1, 2007.

removal authority to the President for officers below genera] and
flag officer rank is unnecessary.
Clarification of nondisclosure requirements applicable to
promotion selection board proceedings (sec. 518)
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sections 618 and 14104 of title 10, United States Code, to clarify the
nondisclosure requirements applicable to deliberations of military
promotion selection boards. The provision would specify that discussions and" dehberations of selection boards, including any written or documentary records thereof, shall be immune from lega!
process; shall not be admitted as evidence; and shall not be used
for any purpose in any action or suit, or judicial or administrative
proceedings w~thout the consent of the Secretary of the military department concerned.
The committee believes that existing policies of the Department
of Defense and the services and oversight exercised by senior military and civilian officials relating to selection board procedures provide necessary safeguards and are effective in ensuring that promotion selection board members fulfill their duty under law to recommend the best qualified officers for promotion. Erosion over time
of the limits on judicial review and discovery in connection with
litigation have not been consistent with the statutory framework
and military necessity.
Special selection board authorities (sec. 519)
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sections 628 and 14502 of title 10, United States Code, with respect
to authority to conduct special selection boards. The provision
would limit the availability of special selection boards to officers
who are in or above the primary promotion zones. This is consistent with the treatment of Reserve component officers under section 14502 and, additionally, limits the substantial administrative
burden of conducting special selection boards only to those cases in
which material error may have occurred. The provision would also
clarify that errors in active and Reserve board procedures that are
not in accordance with law must also be determined by the service
secretaries to be material to the outcome of the board’s determination.
Removal from promotion lists of officers returned to the
President by the Senate (sec. 520).
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sections 629 and 14310 of title 10, United States Code, to clarify the
conditions under which officers whose nominations have not received the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate will by operation
of law be removed from promotion lists. The committee believes,
consistent with the intent of existing sections 629 and 14310, that
there must be statutory procedures for automatic removal of officers from promotion hsts when it is clear that these officers will
not receive a favorable committee recommendation or the advice
and consent of the U.S. Senate and, within a foreseeable time
frame, fulfill the legal requirements for appointment to higher

~i REPORT .ON THE CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS.FOR THE SELECTION OF OFFICERS
FOR PROMOTION IN THE U.S. AIR FORCE
SENATE REPORT NO. 102-482
October 8, 1992
[To accompany ]
The selection of officers for promotion in the armed forces through the grade
of major general and rear admiral is governed by statutory procedures. The
central feature of these procedures is the use of impartial boards of officers,
known as selection boards, to recommend officers for promotion. The composition
and conduct of these boardsis carefully guided by laws and regulations designed
to ensure the fairness and impartiality of board proceedings. The range of
actions that may be taken by the senior leadership before, during, and after the
board proceedings is likewise circumscribed to preclude improPer interference
with the integrity of the selection process.
The fair and impartial conduct of the selection process is a matter of great
concern to the Committee. The integrity of the selection process is essential to
the integrity of the officer corps. Adherence to established laws and
Page.2
(Cite as: S. REP. 102-482, ~i)
regulations is necessary to ensure that the best qualified officers are selected
for promotion, and that the officer corps has confidence in the integrity of the
selection process.
During the Committee’s review of certain Air Force nominations during the
101st Congress, the Committee received information which indicated the
possibility of serious and systemic deficiencies in the procedures used by the
Air Force to recommend officers for selection to genera! officer positions. The
Committee brought these matters to the attention of the Department of Defense.
The Deputy Secretary of Defense ordered an examination of officer selection
procedures throughout the Department of Defense. The results of that review were
provided to the Committee, and considered during Committee proceedings in 1991
on November 19, 20, 21, 25, and 26. *2 A staff report (Sen. Print 102- 54) was
issued on November 26, 1991. The Committee considered the issues raised by the
DOD report and staff report on October 6, 1992, and adopted this report.
The reviews by the Department of Defense and the Committee identified the
following systemic deficiencies in the Air Force officer selection process:
(I) Failure to issue implementing regulations required by applicable statutes
and Department of Defense Directives to ensure the fair operation of the
selection board process..
(2) Use of a preselection process that improperly excluded ninety percent or
more of the eligible officers from consideration by statutory selection boards.

(3) Improper. communication to selection boards of "priority lists"~prepared by
senior officers.
(4) Improper communications between the Air Force leadership and selection
board members.
In addition, these reviews identified deficiencies in specific cases that are
described in this report.
Part I of this report sets forth the statutory and regula.tory back-ground of
the current promotion selection process. Part II describes the events resulting
in the Committee’s inquiries and a review by the Department of Defense. Part III
analyzes the deficiencies in Air Force procedures disclosed as a result of the
Committee’s inquiries and the Department’s review.
I. STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND
The promotion selection process
The promotion of military officers through the grade of major general and rear
admiral relies on a merit-based system, the centerpieces of which is the
selection board.process. The sole exception involves officers nominated under
the President’s power under Article II of the Constitution to make nonstatutory
nominations, an authority that is rarely invoked.
Page 4
(Cite as: S. REP. 102-482, ~2)
Under current law, i0 U.SoC. 612, each selection board must consist of at
least five officers, all of whom must be serving in a grade higher than the
officers under consideration by the board. To ensure that the selection process
is not dominated by a small group of officers, the law provides that "[n]o
officer may be a member of two successive selection boards *** for the
consideration of officers of the same competitive category and grade." i0 U.S.C.
612(b). To emphasize the solemnity of the board’s responsibilities, a statute
requires that each member "swear that he will perform his duties as a member of
the board without prejudice or partiality and having in view both the special
fitness of officers and the efficiency of his armed force." I0 U.S.C. 613.
To encourage candid discussions free from outside interference, the law
prohibits disclosure of a board’s deliberations "to any person not a member of
the board," subject only to very limited exceptions, i0 U.S.C. 618(f).
The board must submit a written report, signed by each member, certifying that
the board has "carefully considered the record of each officer" under
consideration, and that those recommended by the board "are best qualified for
promotion." i0 U.S.C. 617.
~3 Prior to submission of the board’s report to the President, it is reviewed
by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense. These individuals are
