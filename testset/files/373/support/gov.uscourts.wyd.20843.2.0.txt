PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

 
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document2 _ Filed 04/15/2010 Page 2of4

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT THE PLAINTIFFS, William Ayers and Meghan
Lanker, by and through counsel David A. Lane, Darold W. Killmer, Qusair Mohamedbhai, Sara
Rich, Rebecca T. Wallace and Lisa R. Sahli of Killmer, Lane & Newman, LLP, and David
Lindsey, hereby submit PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
enjoining Defendant's ongoing violations of the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

1. Defendants have violated Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights by issuing a prior
restraint against Plaintiff, William Ayers, by prohibiting him from speaking on campus on April
28, 2010, and by denying Plaintiffs the right to freely assemble and to associate with one
another, and to be free from state action that discriminates on the basis of their viewpoint.

2. These violations are ongoing. But for injunctive relief, the Constitutional
violations alleged in the Complaint will continue to occur. Injunctive relief is thus warranted to
prevent future violations. United States y. Oregon State Medical Soc., 343 U.S. 326, 333
(1952)(all that is needed for a cause of action for relief by injunction is a real threat of future
violation or a contemporary violation of a nature likely to continue or recur).

4. Plaintiffs in a First Amendment case must satisfy four conditions to obtain a
preliminary injunction and show: (1) they will suffer irreparable harm unless the injunction
issues; (2) there is a substantial likelihood Plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on the merits; (3) the
threatened injury to Plaintiffs outweighs any harm the proposed injunction may cause the
opposing party; and (4) the injunction would not be contrary to the public interest. American
Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson, 194 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 1999).

5. As detailed in Plaintiffs' Brief in Support of this Motion for Preliminary
Injunction, submitted simultaneously herewith, each of the elements necessary to obtain a
preliminary injunction is present in this action.

6. U.S.D.C.L.R. 7.1(b)(1)(A) Certific. Pursuant to local rule 7.1, prior to the filing
of this Motion, on April 12, 2010, undersigned counsel personally spoke to Mr. Tom Rice,

counsel for the University of Wyoming, asking his position on this Motion for a Preliminary
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document2 _ Filed 04/15/2010 Page3of4

Injunction for Professor Ayers to speak on campus on April 28, 2010. On April 15, 2010, the
University of Wyoming responded that they are opposed this motion.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the Motion for
Preliminary Injunction, and grant such further relief as is just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 15" day of April, 2010.
