PLAINTIFFS' BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

 
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 Filed 04/15/2010 Page2of9

Plaintiffs Williams Ayers and Meghan Lanker, by their attorneys David A. Lane,
Darold W. Killmer, Sara Rich, Qusair Mohammedbhai, Rebecca T. Wallace and Lisa
Sahli of the law firm of KILLMER, LANE & NEWMAN, LLP, and David Lindsay
hereby submit this Brief in Support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

All statements of fact set forth in the simultaneously filed Complaint are hereby

incorporated into this Brief as though set forth fully herein.
Il. PARTIES

All statements of fact regarding the parties set forth in the stmultaneously filed

Complaint are hereby incorporated into this Brief as though set forth fully herein.

Ill. LEGAL ARGUMENT

A. Plaintiffs Have a Particularly Strong Basis For Meeting The
Preliminary Injunction Standard in a First Amendment Case

The University's denial of a forum for Professor Ayers's public speech is an
unconstitutional prior restraint on such speech and burdens the freedom of speech of
each plaintiff, thus creating a strong presumption that a preliminary injunction should
issue.

A plaintiff in a First Amendment case must meet four conditions to obtain a
preliminary injunction: A Plaintiff must show that (1) they will suffer irreparable harm
unless the injunction issues; (2) there is a substantial likelihood the Plaintiff ultimately
will prevail on the merits; (3) the threatened injury to the Plaintiff outweighs any harm
the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) the injunction would not
be contrary to the public interest. American Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson, 194 F.3d
1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 1999).

In a First Amendment case, the second condition--likelihood of success on the
merits--plays a decisive role. Once plaintiffs have shown that their freedom of speech
is burdened, the other injunction conditions will typically be met. First, where First

Amendment rights are burdened, there is a presumption of irreparable harm. See Cmty.

Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 Filed 04/15/2010 Page3of9

Communications v. City of Boulder, 660 F.2d 1370, 1376 (10th Cir. 1981); Johnson,
194 F.3d at 1163. The reason for the presumption is self-evident. As the Supreme
Court put it, "[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of
time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347,
373-74 (1976); see also Utah Licensed Beverage Ass'n v. Leavitt, 256 F.3d 1061, 1076
(10th Cir. 2001)(court assumes irreparable injury where deprivation of speech rights).
The denial of Professor Ayers' forum for a public speech is manifestly a prior restraint,
and the injury is irreparable.

The balance of harms test will most often be met once a First Amendment
plaintiff demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits. A threatened injury to
plaintiffs' constitutionally protected speech will usually outweigh the harm, if any, the
defendants may incur from being unable to enforce what is in all likelihood an
unconstitutional statute or directive. See Johnson, 194 F.3d at 1163.

Plaintiffs can satisfy the "public interest test" because the denial of the public
forum for the speech on April 28, 2010 burdens their free speech rights. Injunctions
blocking state action that would otherwise interfere with First Amendment rights are
consistent with the public interest. Elam Constr. v. Reg. Transp. Dist., 129 F.3d 1343,
1347 (10th Cir.1997)(cent*The public interest...favors plaintiffs' assertion of their First
Amendment rights."); Utah Licensed Beverage Ass'n, 256 F.3d at 1076; Johnson, 194
F.3d at 1163; Local Org. Comm., Denver Chap., Million Man March v. Cook, 922 F.
Supp. 1494, 1501 (D. Colo. 1996) Plaintiffs Have a Strong Likelihood of Success on the
Merits Because Defendants' Ban of the Public Forum Infringes on Plaintiffs' Core First
Amendment Rights

1. Banning the Public Forum Constitutes an Impermissible Prior
Restraint on Constitutionally Protected Speech

The decision by the University prohibiting a speech by Professor Ayers on April
28, 2010 constitutes, by definition, a prior restraint on speech. The United States

Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that the First Amendment must be vigorously

-3-
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 _ Filed 04/15/2010 Page4of9

protected to allow the free and open exchange of ideas, and this core constitutional
protection is most precious on our college and university campuses:

Yet, the precedents of this court leave no room for the view that, because of the
acknowledged need for order, First Amendment protections should apply with
less force on college campuses than in the community at large. Quite to the
contrary, "the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more
vital than in the community of American schools," Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S.
479, 487 (1960) The college classroom with its surrounding environs is
peculiarly the "marketplace of ideas," and we break no new constitutional ground
in reaffirming this Nation's dedication to safeguarding academic freedom.
Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967); Sweezy v. New
Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 249-250 (1957)(plurality opinion of Mr. Chief Justice
Warren), 262 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result).

Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181 (1972). Healy's powerful statement that people
must be allowed to express disagreement about important issues, which views cannot be
suppressed particularly by prior restraint, has become a well-worn touchstone of our
nation's First Amendment jurisprudence.

Similarly, the Court has not wavered in its view that the government cannot
abridge the expressive activities of peaceful assembly and association:

Among the rights protected by the First Amendment is the right of individuals to
associate to further their personal beliefs. While the freedom of association is not
explicitly set out in the Amendment, it has long been held to be implicit in the
freedoms of speech, assembly, and petition. See, e. g., Baird v. State Bar of
Arizona, 401 U.S. 1, 6 (1971); NAACP v. Button, 37\ U.S. 415, 430 (1963);
Louisiana ex rel. Gremillion v. NAACP, 366 U.S. 293, 296 (1961); NAACP v.
Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958) (Harlan, J., for a unanimous
Court).
Id, at 181. It is plain that Professor Ayers has a fundamental First Amendment right to
express and explain his views in a public forum, and that Ms. Lanker has a
constitutionally protected right to peaceably assemble to hear those views, and to
express her views in agreement or dissent.
Plaintiff Lanker complied with the University's administrative regulations in

reserving the campus facilities for the public forum. Until the University can meet its

-4-
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 Filed 04/15/2010 Page 5of9

extraordinarily "heavy burden" of justifying its prior restraint of legitimate First
Amendment activities, the public forum must be allowed to go forward. As the Healy

Court held:

But, apart from any particular issue, once petitioners had filed an
application in conformity with the requirements, the burden was upon the
College administration to justify its decision of rejection. See, e. g., Law
Students Civil Rights Research Council v. Wadmond, 401 U.S. 154, 162-
163 (1971); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376-377 (1968);
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958). It is to be remembered that the
effect of the College's denial of recognition was a form of prior restraint,
denying to petitioners' organization the range of associational activities
described above. While a college has a legitimate interest in preventing
disruption on the campus, which under circumstances requiring the
safeguarding of that interest may justify such restraint, a "heavy burden"
rests on the college to demonstrate the appropriateness of that action. See
Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 713-716 (1931); Organization for a
Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 418 (1971); Freedman v. Maryland,
380 U.S. 51, 57 (1965).

Id. at 184. As the Supreme Court observed in Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. V.
Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 552-53 (1975), Defendants' "action here is indistinguishable in
its censoring effect from the official actions consistently identified as prior restraints in
a long line of this Court's decisions. See Shutitlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147,
150-151 (1969); Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322 (1958); Kunz v. New York,
340 U.S. 290, 293-294 (1951); Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161-162 (1939); Lovell
v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 451-452 (1938). In these cases, plaintiffs asked the courts to
provide relief where public officials had forbidden the use of public places for protected
speech. The restraints took a variety of forms, with officials exercising control over
different kinds of public places under the authority of particular statutes. All, however,
had this in common: they gave public officials the power to deny use of a forum in

2

advance of actual expression." Conrad, supra at 552-3 (granting injunction to
petitioners who alleged their First Amendment rights were violated by City that denied

use of public forum to present theatrical production of "Hair"). The Court has
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 _ Filed 04/15/2010 Page 6of9

consistently disallowed government prohibition of speech that was not the product of
clearly established and content-neutral procedures for determining the propriety of the
speech. "Invariably, the Court has felt obliged to condemn systems in which the
exercise of such authority was not bounded by precise and clear standards. The
reasoning has been, simply, that the danger of censorship and of abridgment of our
precious First Amendment freedoms is too great where officials have unbridled
discretion over a forum's use. Our distaste for censorship-reflecting the natural
distaste of a free people-is deep-written in our law." Jd. at 553,

The fact that the conduct here at issue constitutes a restraint on speech prior to
its occurrence carries substantial constitutional significance. The Supreme Court has
analyzed it this way:

The presumption against prior restraints is heavier-and the degree of protection
broader-than that against limits on expression imposed by criminal penalties.
Behind the distinction is a theory deeply etched in our law: a free society prefers
to punish the few who abuse rights of speech after they break the Jaw than to
throttle them and all others beforehand. It is always difficult to know in advance
what an individual will say, and the line between legitimate and illegitimate
speech is often so finely drawn that the risks of freewheeling censorship are
formidable. See Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513 (1958)."

The UW prior restraint is therefore constitutionally infirm, and must be enjoined
to allow the speech to go forward.

2. The University's Ban of the Public Forum is an
Unconstitutional Content-Based Discrimination Against
Unpopular Speech

Defendants' ban of the public forum was infected and motivated in a material
way by the Defendants' personal distaste and disagreement with the anticipated content
of Professor Ayers' speech.

The Supreme Court applies "the most exacting scrutiny" to restrictions that
impose different burdens upon speech based on the viewpoint of the speaker. Turner

Broadcasting Systems, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642 (1994); Simon & Schuster v. New

-6-
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 Filed 04/15/2010 Page 7 of 9

York Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 118 (1991). The Court analyzed this principle
eloquently in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943):
"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high
or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other
matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." Jd. at
642. The Court reasoned:

{a]s governmental] pressure toward unity becomes greater, so strife becomes more
bitter as to whose unity it shall be. Probably no deeper division of our people
could proceed from any provocation than from finding it necessary to choose
what doctrine and whose program public educational officials shall compel youth
to unite in embracing. Ultimate futility of such attempts to compel coherence is
the lesson of every such effort from the Roman drive to stamp out Christianity as
a disturber of its pagan unity, the Inquisition, as a means to religious and
dynastic unity, the Siberian exiles as a means to Russian unity, down to the fast
failing efforts of our present totalitarian enemies. Those who begin coercive
elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters.
Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard.

Id. at 641. The Court in Barnette wisely observed that the protection of dissenting
viewpoints, of views that stray far from the popular orthodoxy, is compelled by our
Constitution, even where it hurts the most:

we apply the limitations of the Constitution with no fear that freedom to be
intellectually and spiritually diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the social
organization. To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies
are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an
unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds. We can have
intellectual individualism and the rich cultural diversities that we owe to
exceptional minds only at the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal
attitudes. When they are so harmless to others or to the State as those we deal
with here, the price is not too great. But freedom to differ is not limited to things
that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of
its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing
order.

Barnette, supra at 641-2. It is beyond debate that Defendants have banned Professor

Ayers because his viewpoint is not aligned with the University's accepted orthodoxy.
Case 2:10-cv-00079-WFD Document3 Filed 04/15/2010 Page 8of9

See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 413 n.9 (1989)(`one's attitude toward the
flag and its referents is a viewpoint"); Barnette 319 U.S. at 642 (constitution guarantees
"right to differ as to things that touch the heart of existing order"). The popular and
political pressure brought to bear on Defendants was such that they issued press
releases, essentially apologizing to the entire country for the previously rescinded
invitation, and the assumed content of Professor Ayers' not-yet-given speech.

The First Amendment requires that the University must allow the public forum to
occur on April 28, 2010, notwithstanding the likelihood that University officials will
disagree with Professor Ayers' speech, notwithstanding the possibility that some who
hear his speech may be made uncomfortable by it, and even assuming that some
listeners may respond inappropriately or disruptively. The First Amendment tolerates

no lesser result.

IV. CONCLUSION

As Justice Hugo Black succinctly observed: "I do not believe that it can be too
often repeated that the freedoms of speech, press, petition and assembly guaranteed by
the First Amendment must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner or later they will
be denied to the ideas we cherish." Communist Party v. SACB, 367 U.S. 1, 137 (1961).
For the reasons stated, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant their Motion
for a Preliminary Injunction and prohibit Defendants from barring the public forum on
April 28, 2010 at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, Wyoming.

Dated this 15'" day of April 2010.
