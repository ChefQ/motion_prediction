IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO
Civil Action No. 18-cv-02435
TENDRIL NETWORKS, INC.
Plaintiff,
v.
MARISSA HUMMON and
JESS MELANSON,
Defendants.
DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, CROSSMOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY
Defendants Marissa Hummon and Jess Melanson (together, “Defendants”) hereby oppose
Plaintiff Tendril Networks, Inc.’s (“Tendril”) Motion for Expedited Discovery in the abovecaptioned action. Alternatively, should the Court grant Tendril’s motion, Defendants
respectfully request that they also be permitted expedited discovery commensurate with the
expedited discovery granted to Tendril.
INTRODUCTION
Tendril has brought this action against Defendants, alleging that they, former Tendril
employees, retained and misappropriated Tendril’s confidential information and trade secrets to
compete with Tendril by working at Utilidata, Inc. (“Utilidata”) and, in so doing, violated certain
of their agreements with Tendril. On September 24, 2018––over a month after learning of
Defendants’ intent to depart for Utilidata––Tendril filed an unverified Complaint for Injunctive
relief (Doc. 1) and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 3), devoid of any supporting or

Case 1:18-cv-02435-RM-NRN Document 29 Filed 10/02/18 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 8

admissible evidence. Tendril now seeks expedited discovery outside of the mandates of Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(d), which is presumably intended to support its motion for a preliminary injunction.
Tendril has, however, failed to provide the Court with the required good cause or, indeed,
any sound rationale for expedited discovery. Moreover, Tendril has also failed to provide the
Court with any information or explanation of the scope or subject matter of the requested
expedited discovery it seeks, apart from proposed numerical limits.
For these reasons, and as detailed below, the Court should deny Tendril’s motion.
BACKGROUND1
As alleged in the Complaint, Tendril provides energy management data analytics and
software to energy utilities. (Compl. ¶ 7.) Defendants, two former Tendril employees, signed
Employee Confidentiality and Inventions Assignment Agreements containing noncompetition,
nonsolicitation, nondisclosure, and assignment of inventions provisions, as well as a provision
concerning the return of Tendril’s property upon termination of employment. (Id. ¶¶ 12-27.)
Defendants informed Tendril on August 17, 2018 of their intent to resign and work for
Utilidata, a company that sells software that helps utilities better manage their electric grid
assets. (Id. ¶ 32.) Over a month later, Tendril filed this action claiming that Defendants retained
Tendril’s purported confidential and trade secret information for the purpose of misappropriating
and using such information to compete with Tendril in violation of trade secret laws and their
agreements with Tendril. (See generally id.) Now, having failed to provide any––much less
sufficient––evidence to establish good cause, Tendril seeks permission to engage in expedited
discovery. Such permission should be denied.

Defendants cite to the allegations in the Complaint for purposes of providing relevant background based
on the Plaintiff’s contentions. In so doing, Defendants do not, however, admit the allegations. Rather,
Defendants will respond to Tendril’s allegations and claims in their forthcoming responses to Tendril’s
motion for preliminary junction and the Complaint.

ARGUMENT
Rule 26(d)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., prohibits a litigant from “seek[ing] discovery from any
source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f).” Although a court may allow
discovery on an expedited basis, the party “seeking expedited discovery in advance of a Rule
26(f) conference has the burden of showing good cause for the requested departure from usual
discovery procedures.” Qwest Comm. Int’l, Inc. v. Worldquest Networks, Inc., 213 F.R.D. 418,
419 (D. Colo. 2003) (citing Pod-Ners, LLC v. Northern Feed & Bean of Lucerne, Ltd. Liability
Co., 204 F.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Colo. 2002)). “Good cause exists where ‘the need for expedited
discovery, in consideration of the administration of justice, outweighs the prejudice to the
responding party.’” Warner Bros. Records, Inc. v. Does 1-20, Civ. No. 07-cv-01131-LTB-MJW,
2007 WL 1655365, at *1 (D. Colo. 2007) (citing Semitool, Inc. v. Tokyo Electron Am., Inc., 208
F.R.D. 273, 276 (N.D. Cal. 2002)). “In applying the ‘good cause’ standard under Rule 26(d), the
court should consider the scope of the requested discovery.” Qwest, 231 F.R.D. at 420. Even
where a motion for expedited discovery accompanies a motion for preliminary injunction, such
discovery should be denied where the moving party’s requests are overly broad and not
reasonably tailored to the specific issues to be addressed at the preliminary injunction hearing.
Id. (citing Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc., No. Civ. A. 98CV-2782, 1998 WL 404820 (E.D. Pa. 1998)); see also Washington v. Correia, 546 Fed. Appx.
786, 787 (10th Cir. 2013) (“It [is] well within the court’s discretion to decline to authorize
expedited discovery.”).
As explained below, not only has Tendril failed to demonstrate good cause, it has failed
to even specify the requests it seeks so as to permit the Court to assess the appropriateness of the
requested discovery and determine whether such discovery is sufficiently narrow and

3

Case 1:18-cv-02435-RM-NRN Document 29 Filed 10/02/18 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 8

appropriately tailored to the issues to be addressed in connection with its preliminary injunction
motion. Accordingly, Tendril’s motion should be denied.
A.

Tendril’s Delay in Filing this Action and Seeking a Preliminary Injunction Belies Its
Need for Expedited Discovery.
In filing this motion and the accompanying motion for a preliminary injunction, Tendril

has created a false sense of urgency with regard to its claims against Defendants. There is
simply no need for expedited discovery (or injunctive relief, for that matter) in this case, as
demonstrated by the fact that Tendril learned that Defendants were leaving to go work for
Utilidata on August 17, 2018, but did not file this action or its motion for a preliminary
injunction until over five weeks later, on September 24, 2018, during which time there was no
change to the status quo. Certainly, if this matter required expediency in any way, including
expedited discovery, Tendril would not have waited so long to seek redress in the courts. The
Court should not permit Tendril to delay in bringing its claims against Defendants and then
create a manufactured need for expedited discovery to support those claims. Tendril’s motion
should therefore be denied.
B.

Tendril Has Made it Impossible for the Court to Determine Whether its Discovery
Requests are Narrowly Tailored to the Relevant Issues.
As set forth above, in assessing the instant motion, the Court must consider the scope of

the requested expedited discovery to ensure that it is reasonably tailored to the specific issues to
be addressed at the preliminary injunction hearing and not overly broad. Tendril has completely
frustrated the Court’s ability to conduct this necessary inquiry by failing to provide the substance
of the requested interrogatories, document requests, subpoena to Utilidata, and Rule 30(b)(6)
notice. Indeed, in the absence of any specificity regarding the scope of Tendril’s proposed
expedited discovery, it is more likely than not that such discovery would add nothing to the
factual allegations already set forth in Tendril’s Complaint and motion for preliminary
4

Case 1:18-cv-02435-RM-NRN Document 29 Filed 10/02/18 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 8

injunction. Accordingly, absent any showing that the discovery sought is reasonably tailored to
the relevant issues, Tendril has abdicated its burden to show, and thus entirely failed to
demonstrate, good cause for expedited discovery. Accordingly, Tendril’s motion should be
denied.
CROSS-MOTION
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Court were inclined to grant Tendril’s motion for
expedited discovery, Defendants respectfully request that they be allowed expedited discovery
commensurate with that granted to Tendril, so that they may obtain evidence to oppose
Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Although Defendants have not yet prepared
formal discovery requests, should the Court grant expedited discovery, Defendants’ specific
discovery requests would include, but not be limited to, the following:
Document Requests
•

All documents evidencing Tendril’s plans, from January 1, 2017 to the
present, to expand (or not expand) its Orchestrated Energy business into the
non-utility demand management market;

Marissa Hummon and Tendril’s senior executives, including but not limited

regarding Tendril’s plans to expand (or not expand) its Orchestrated Energy
business into the non-utility demand management market;

•

All documents evidencing communications between Jess Melanson and
Adrian Tuck, from January 1, 2017 to the present, regarding the possibility

management, including but not limited to the possibility that such new
business might partner with Tendril in some capacity;

•

All documents evidencing communications between Adrian Tuck and any
other Tendril corporate officer and/or board member, from January 1, 2017

focused on non-utility demand management, including but not limited to the
5

Case 1:18-cv-02435-RM-NRN Document 29 Filed 10/02/18 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 8

possibility that such new business might partner with Tendril in some
capacity; and
•

All documents evidencing communications between Marissa Hummon and
Adrian Tuck, from January 1, 2017 to the present, regarding Ms. Hummon’s
desire to move into an executive role with either Tendril or another
company, including but not limited to all communications in which Mr.
Tuck encouraged Ms. Hummon to leave Tendril if she could find such an

Interrogatories

Hummon and Tendril’s senior executives, including but not limited to
Tendril’s CEO, Adrian Tuck, from January 1, 2017 to the present, regarding

into the non-utility demand management market;

•

Describe all communications between Adrian Tuck and any other Tendril
corporate officer and/or board member, from January 1, 2017 to the present,

Utilidata’s CEO, Josh Brumberger, to create a new business focused on nonutility demand management, including but not limited to the possibility that
such new business might partner with Tendril in some capacity; and

•

Describe all communications between Marissa Hummon and Adrian Tuck,
from January 1, 2017 to the present, regarding Ms. Hummon’s desire to
move into an executive role with either Tendril or another company,
including but not limited to all communications in which Mr. Tuck
encouraged Ms. Hummon to leave Tendril if she could find such an
executive opportunity elsewhere.

Defendants propose that Tendril be required to respond to Defendants’ document
requests and interrogatories within five (5) business days.
Deposition
Defendants seek a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Tendril, to be completed on or before
October 19, 2018, with the list of topics limited to those covered by the foregoing document
requests and interrogatories.

CONCLUSION
Tendril has failed to meet its burden of showing good cause for the requested departure
from usual discovery procedures. Instead, Tendril seeks potentially wide-ranging, overbroad,
and prejudicial discovery at this very early stage of litigation, encumbered only by restrictions on
the number of requests or depositions. Tendril has entirely ignored its burden of proving
compelling urgency or relationship of the expedited discovery sought to the issues in its motion
for a preliminary injunction. This Court should therefore deny Tendril’s Motion for Expedited
Discovery. In the alternative, if the Court were to grant Tendril’s motion, Defendants
respectfully request that the Court grant their cross-motion and permit expedited discovery on
behalf of Defendants as well.
