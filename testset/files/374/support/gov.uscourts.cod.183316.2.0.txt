IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

TENDRIL NETWORKS, INC.,
Plaintiff,
v.

MOTION FOR EXPEDITED DISCOVERY

Tendril Tendril Networks, Inc. (“Tendril”), respectfully moves this Court to grant it leave
to conduct limited, expedited discovery pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(d). In
support of this motion, Tendril states as follows:
1.

Certification Pursuant to D.C.COLO.LCivR 7.1A: The undersigned certifies that

counsel for Tendril has conferred with Stephen Reed of Beck Reed Riten, LLP, counsel for
Defendants Marissa Hummon and Jess Melanson, who states that Defendants will oppose this
motion. The undersigned further certifies that upon filing the instant motion with the Court,
undersigned counsel also will arrange for Defendants to receive, through service in accordance

accompanying proposed orders. In addition, courtesy copies of all filings will be emailed to
Mr. Reed.

2.

Tendril has filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Motion for Preliminary

Injunction and Brief in Support Thereof contemporaneously with this motion and seeks a
preliminary injunction hearing forthwith.
3.

Tendril asserts claims for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets

under federal and state law, conversion, civil theft, and breach of duty of loyalty against
Defendants, both former employees of Tendril.
4.

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(d), a court may allow discovery before

a Rule 26(f) conference upon a showing of good cause. See, e.g., Qwest Comm’n Int’l, Inc. v.
Worldquest Networks, Inc., 213 F.R.D. 418, 419 (D. Colo. 2003); Pod-Ners, LLC v. N. Feed &
Bean of Lucerne Liab. Co., 204 F.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Colo. 2002) (“expedited discovery may be
appropriate in cases where the plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction”).
5.

Tendril submits that good cause exists to allow limited, expedited discovery.

Specifically, as set forth in the Complaint, Tendril has evidence that Defendants Marissa
Hummon (“Dr. Hummon”) and Jess Melanson (“Melanson”) currently are in possession of
significant amounts of Tendril’s confidential information and trade secrets, much of which has
been exchanged through or downloaded to personal email accounts that Tendril cannot access.
In addition, Defendants’ conduct was in concert with numerous representatives of Utilidata, Inc.
(“Utilidata”), who are nonparties to this action. Accordingly, to determine the scope and extent
of Defendants’ misconduct, and to present fulsome evidence to the Court in support of its motion
for preliminary injunction, Tendril requires discovery from both Defendants and third parties.
6.

Tendril requests the following limited, expedited discovery:

30(b)(6) deposition, for up to four (4) hours.

7.

Tendril submits that the foregoing discovery will allow it to adequately prepare

for the preliminary injunction hearing.
8.

As a result of Tendril’s motion for preliminary injunction, filed simultaneously

with this motion, Tendril requests that the Court set an expedited briefing schedule for this
motion.
WHEREFORE, Tendril respectfully requests that the Court grant this motion and permit
expedited discovery as set forth above.
