CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:13-cv-982-OLG

PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT GERALD RICKHOFF’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiffs file their response to Defendant Gerald C. Rickhoff’s Motion to Dismiss. The
Court should deny Rickhoff’s motion for the reasons set forth below.
Preliminary Statement
Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Rickhoff is a proper party because he is a government official
who, acting under color of state law, deprived Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss of their rights
secured by the United States Constitution. (See Docket No. 1, Compl. ¶ 59-60.) On October 3,
2013, Rickhoff’s office refused to issue a marriage license to Holmes and Phariss because they
1

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 33 Filed 12/09/13 Page 2 of 7

are men and the Texas Constitution and provisions of the Family Code (collectively, “Section
32”) prohibit same-sex marriage. (Id. ¶ 30.) Plaintiffs contend that Rickhoff’s refusal to issue
the license violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights because Section 32 itself violates the Equal
Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Id. ¶¶ 51-58.) Therefore,
Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing Rickhoff from refusing to issue them a marriage license.
(See id. at 16.)
Rickhoff asserts that the Court should dismiss him from the case because he is “required
to follow the laws of the State of Texas” and he cannot “on his own, alter the laws of the State of
Texas.” (Docket No. 20 at 2.) This argument fails. Indeed, none of the defendants, acting alone,
can alter the challenged state law and their ability to alter the law is not at issue. But Rickhoff is
a defendant because he, acting under color of state law, deprived Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss of
their constitutionally protected rights and privileges, and Plaintiffs seek to enjoin him from doing
so again. “I was doing my job” pursuant to an unconstitutional provision is not a defense, and
the Court should deny Rickhoff’s motion to dismiss.

LEGAL STANDARD

When ruling on a defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “[t]he court accepts ‘all
well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.’” Johnson v.
City of Houston, 444 Fed. App’x 26, 30 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting In re Katrina Canal Breaches
Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)). A complaint will survive a motion to dismiss if it
states “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Claims have facial plausibility “when the pleaded factual
content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the

misconduct alleged.” Amacker v. Renaissance Asset Mgmt. LLC, 657 F.3d 252, 254 (5th Cir.
2011) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).
II.

ARGUMENT

A. Rickhoff Is A Proper Party Because He Refused To Issue A Marriage License To
Plaintiffs Holmes And Phariss And Plaintiffs Seek Injunctive Relief Against Him.
On October 3, 2013, Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss requested a marriage license from the
Bexar County Clerk’s office. (Compl. ¶ 30.) Rickhoff is the Bexar County Clerk, and his office
refused to issue a license to Holmes and Phariss because they are a same-sex couple. (Id. ¶¶ 12,
30.) Because Rickhoff refused to issue Plaintiffs a marriage license, Plaintiffs named him as a
defendant in this lawsuit. (See id. ¶ 30.)
Plaintiffs allege that Section 32 violates their rights under the Due Process and Equal
Protection Clauses and are, therefore, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, (see id. ¶¶ 51-60),
which provides:
Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom or usage, of any State or Territory or the District
of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the
United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the
Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in any
action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.
There are two “essential” elements to a section 1983 action. “First, the conduct complained of
must have been committed by a person acting under color of state law.” Augustine v. Doe, 740
F.2d 322, 325 (5th Cir. 1984). Second, the “conduct must have deprived the plaintiff of rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” Id.
Plaintiffs’ Complaint plainly alleges the two necessary elements of a section 1983 claim
against Rickhoff. First, Rickhoff acted under color of state law. As the Bexar County Clerk,
Rickhoff is responsible for providing marriage applications, issuing marriage licenses, and

3

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 33 Filed 12/09/13 Page 4 of 7

determining whether individuals meet the requirements for marriage. See Tex. Fam. Code §§
2.001(a), 2.002, 2.004(a), 2.005, 2.008; see also Compl. ¶ 12. Because of this, Plaintiffs Holmes
and Phariss applied for a marriage license from him. (Compl. ¶ 30.) Rickhoff, relying on
Section 32, denied Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss’ marriage application. (Id. ¶ 30.) Second, in
denying Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss’ marriage application, Rickhoff deprived Plaintiffs of their
due process and equal protection rights. (See id. ¶¶ 30, 51-60.)
Rickhoff’s motion to dismiss argues that he is not a proper party to Plaintiffs’ lawsuit
because he is merely “exercising the non-discretionary act of following the laws of the State of
Texas.” This argument fails for three reasons. First, as discussed above, Rickhoff plainly falls
within the parameters of section 1983. He is a government official who, acting under color of
state law, violated Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss’ constitutional rights. Plaintiffs could have sued
Rickhoff alone. Second, Rickhoff must be a party for Plaintiffs to obtain an injunction against
him. See Women’s Med. Prof’l Corp. v. Voinovich, 130 F.3d 187, 211 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding
that a party who would be bound by an injunction is a necessary party to an underlying suit for
declaratory relief). Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief precluding Rickhoff from enforcing Section
32. (Compl. at 16.) As evidenced by their recent Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Docket No.
28), Plaintiffs request that this Court order Rickhoff to issue a marriage license to Holmes and
Phariss. Third, Rickhoff’s defense proves too much. Under his logic, every defendant sued
under section 1983 for enforcing an unconstitutional state law could successfully plead the
defense of “just doing my job.” That is not the standard. Plaintiffs do not allege that any
Defendant acted in his personal capacity and deprived Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights.
Plaintiffs only sue each Defendant in his official capacity, and Rickhoff is a proper defendant.
(Compl. ¶¶ 10-13); see Alexander v. Kammer, 363 F. Supp. 324, 327 (E.D. Mich. 1973) (holding

4

that section 1983 claim was properly maintained against city clerk and that city clerk’s refusal to
accept plaintiff’s petition for nomination to city commissioner office because candidate did not
meet city’s residency requirements violated plaintiff’s equal protection rights); cf. Webb’s
Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 158 (1980) (court clerk was defendant in
lawsuit challenging state statute that violated Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments)
Rickhoff’s reliance on Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, Inc. v. Deters, 894 F.
Supp. 1129 (S.D. Ohio 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 92 F.3d 1412 (6th Cir. 1996), is misplaced.
In Deters, the plaintiffs brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a spiritual/religious
exemption to a child endangerment statute. Id. at 1130. Under the exemption, it was not “child
endangerment” for a parent to use prayer, rather than conventional medical care, to treat a child’s
physical or mental illness. Id. The plaintiffs named the state attorney general, the county
prosecutor, and the city solicitor as defendants, contending that they should enforce the child
endangerment statutes regardless of the spiritual/religious exemption. Id. The prosecutor and
city solicitor argued that they were not proper parties because they were not “sufficient
adversaries to be defendants,” as they had not done anything. Id. at 1131. The court held they
were not necessary parties because they were acting as state officials and because they did
nothing that affected the lawsuit—they simply did not prosecute what was not a crime. Id. at
1131-32. The county prosecutor and city solicitor did not violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.
The county prosecutor and city solicitor did nothing, and there was no need to issue an injunction
against them.
In contrast to Deters, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit alleges that Rickhoff violated their constitutional
rights and seeks an injunction barring him from doing so again. None of the other Defendants is
responsible for issuing marriage licenses. None of the other Defendants refused to issue a

5

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 33 Filed 12/09/13 Page 6 of 7

marriage license to Defendants Holmes and Phariss. And Plaintiffs cannot obtain an injunction
from this Court requiring any of the other Defendants to issue a marriage license to them (as
Plaintiffs demand in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Docket No. 28)).
Under similar circumstances, the Sixth Circuit rejected the Deters reasoning. In Women’s
Medical Professional Corp. v. Voinovich, 130 F.3d at 210-11, abortion service providers
challenged Ohio’s abortion laws and sued the governor, the attorney general, and the
Montgomery County prosecutor. Id. at 190, 210. The county prosecutor, relying on Deters,
argued that he was not a necessary party because the governor and attorney general would defend
the law. Id. at 210. The district court rejected this argument, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Id.
at 210-11. The Sixth Circuit held that the county prosecutor was a necessary party because he
could enforce the abortion law if the service providers violated it. The Sixth Circuit held that the
prosecutor was necessary for the plaintiffs to obtain the injunctive relief they sought—namely an
injunction preventing the prosecutor from enforcing the abortion laws. Id. at 211. The same
reasoning should apply even more so here. Rickhoff not only would violate Plaintiffs’
constitutional rights and refuse to issue them a marriage license, but he has done so. Moreover,
the Court cannot order any of the remaining Defendants to issue a marriage license, which is part
of the relief Plaintiffs seek. Accordingly, Rickhoff is a proper party.

Conclusion
The Court should deny Rickhoff’s motion to dismiss.
