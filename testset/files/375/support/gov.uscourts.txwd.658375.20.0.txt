I.

BACKGROUND
1.

Plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit against the Bexar County Clerk as well

as several other defendants, including the Governor and the Attorney General of
the State of Texas and the Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health
Services. The Plaintiffs state that “[t]his lawsuit is brought by four citizens, each
of whom wishes for the State of Texas to allow and recognize their marriages.”
Plaintiffs assert that certain sections of the Texas Constitution and the Texas
Family Code are unconstitutional pursuant to the Constitution of the United States.
The Texas Office of the Attorney General will represent the State actors and
address the constitutional challenges to the Texas Constitution and the laws of the
State of Texas.
2.

Plaintiffs admit that the laws of the state of Texas prohibit a county clerk,

including the Bexar County Clerk, from issuing marriages licenses to persons of
the same sex. Tex. Family Code Ann §2.001. Plaintiff fail to provide any
authority for the position that the Bexar County Clerk may, on his own, alter the
laws of the State of Texas. No matter the personal opinion of a County Clerk in
the State of Texas, a Clerk is required to follow the laws of the State of Texas.
Tex. Const. Art. XVI §1. There is no discretion given to a County Clerk in regard
to the issuance of marriage licenses. See Tex. Att’y Gen. Opinion M-1216(Sept.
14, 1972)(Summary: The County Clerks in Texas are not authorized to issue
2

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 20 Filed 11/20/13 Page 3 of 8

licenses to two persons of the same sex.) The laws are created by the legislative
branch of the Texas Government and the Governor and the Attorney General are
the proper parties to defend the constitutionality of their actions.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
3.

Rule 12(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the

trial court to dismiss a cause of action if a plaintiff fails "to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (6). Generally, when reviewing
a complaint for 12(b)(6) dismissal, a district court should accept well-pleaded facts
as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Lindquist v. City
of Pasadena, 525 F.3d 383, 386 (5th Cir. 1996). However, as the Supreme Court
has recently explained, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the
allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp.
v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007)) (emphasis added). Threadbare
recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory
statements do not suffice. Id.
4.

Another important principle in Twombly, as explained by the U.S.

Supreme Court in Iqbal, is that only a complaint that states a plausible claim for
relief will survive a motion to dismiss. Id. To avoid dismissal under F.R.C.P 12(b)
(6), a complaint must state “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible
3

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 20 Filed 11/20/13 Page 4 of 8

on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007)
(emphasis added). Facial plausibility occurs “when the plaintiff pleads
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the
defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949-50 (2009)
(citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007)). The
allegations set forth in the complaint “must be enough to raise a right to relief
above the speculative level,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted) and
show that the pleader is entitled to relief. Iqbal at 1949-50 (2009). Mere
conclusory allegations will not survive a motion to dismiss. Blackburn v. City of
Marshall, 42 F.3d 925, 931 (5th Cir. 1995).
III. ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs Have Failed to State a Claim against Defendant Bexar County Clerk
Rickhoff for Which the Relief They Seek Can Be Granted
5.

The Plaintiffs claims against the Bexar County Clerk are that he is

exercising the non-discretionary act of following the laws of the State of Texas.
The gravamen of the Plaintiff’s lawsuit is to have those laws deemed
unconstitutional. The issue of the constitutionality of a Texas Statute or a
provision of the Texas Constitution will be and should be defended by the Texas
Attorney General – not by one Texas County Clerk. The issue of the
constitutionality of certain provisions of the Texas Family Code and the Texas
Constitution can be litigated without the participation of the Bexar County Clerk.

6.

If the provisions of the Texas Family Code and the Texas Constitution

are declared unconstitutional, it would not be necessary to enjoin the Bexar County
Clerk from enforcing the statutes because the Plaintiffs would have a separate
cause of action against the County Clerk should he attempt to enforce a statutes
which have been held to be unconstitutional on its face. When a state official seeks
to enforce a state legislative enactment that is void because it is unconstitutional,
the officer enjoys no absolute immunity. See Ex Parte Young, 28 S.Ct. 441 (1908).
For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to rule on the issue of
injunctive relief against prosecutorial authorities once statutes have been declared
invalid, stating that the court would assume that prosecutorial authorities would
give full credence to the Court's decision that the statutes were unconstitutional.
See Doe v. Bolton, 93 S.Ct. 739 (1973); Roe v. Wade, 93 S.Ct. 705 (1973) The
Court in this case may assume that the Bexar County Clerk will give full credence
to the Court’s decision in this case.
7.

Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court, in reviewing an appeal of a

district court's failure to enjoin enforcement of an unconstitutional statute, held that
it was proper for a district court to decline to issue such an injunction because there
was no allegation and no proof that respondents would not acquiesce in a decision
holding the challenged ordinance unconstitutional. Poe v. Gerstein, 94 S.Ct. 2247
(1974)

8.

In regard to the Declaratory Action, the proper parties are before the

Court to address this issue. It is the role of the Texas Attorney General to defend
the Constitutionality of the Law of the State of Texas. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem
Code §37.006(b); Tex. Gov’t Code §402.010 . In Children's Healthcare is a Legal
Duty, Inc. v. Deters, 894 F.Supp. 1129, 1131-32 (S.D. Ohio 1995), rev'd on other
grounds, 92 F.3d 1412 (6th Cir. 1996), the plaintiffs sued various officials
including the state attorney general and a district attorney in attacking the
constitutionality of a statute that provided religious exemptions from a child
endangerment law. The court held that the district attorney was not the proper
defendant, noting that it was a state law at issue and the lawmakers, not the
enforcers, were the proper defendants. In the present case, the Bexar County Clerk
had no control over the enactment of the legislation. The state lawmakers are
responsible for enactment of the statute, and it would be unjust to require Bexar
County Clerk Rickhoff to bear the costs associated with defending the
constitutionality of the statute, especially given that if the statute is declared
unconstitutional he could have the Plaintiffs’ costs and fees assessed against him.
