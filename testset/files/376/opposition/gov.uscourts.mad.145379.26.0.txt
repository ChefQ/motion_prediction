Prince was re-hired by Rock Tenn on January 24, 2011, to work the third shift from 11:00
p.m. to 7:00 a.m. as a fulltime assistant machine operator.
On September 27, 2011, Prince was injured on the job at 1:40 a.m. Prince was working on
the 450 die cut machine. His job was to load the bundles into the load former. As he was packing
the bundles into the load former, the work flow was picking up coming down the conveyor line.
Since the machine is not linked to the bundle breaker and the photo eyes on the conveyor, the
workload just kept kicking out. The bundles kept on pushing and pushing until they pushed Prince
right into the machine, pinning him there until he threw the bundles on the ground to free himself.
Claude St. Germaine, the Rock Tenn supervisor at the time, came running over, yelling and
screaming at Prince. He was more worried about the product that was wasted than whether one of
his workers was hurt. Prince tried to explain this, but St. Germaine just kept on yelling at Prince.
Prince said: "I am going home," which he did.
Early that morning the Rock Tenn Plant Manager called Prince, but he missed the call. So
Prince called Steven LeBlanc, Rock Tenn’s Human Resources Manager, and described what
happened. Later in the day the Plant Superintendent called Prince and asked Prince to come back
in for his next shift.
At approximately 10:00 p.m. Prince woke from a two hour nap and could not get out of bed.
His lower back was in tremendous pain. So Prince called out, saying: "I am unable to come into
work tonight due to an injury I received on the 450 the previous night. Any questions, please call
me."
When Prince was called by Rock Tenn, he described the situation, and an appointment was
scheduled with the Rock Tenn physician at Nashoba Valley Medical Center located in Ayer,

Massachusetts.
When Prince arrived at the plant, Rock Tenn Plant Superintendent Robert McMonigle came
out and talked privately with Prince before he took him to the Rock Tenn doctor. He said that the
plant had a lot of injuries and that Rock Tenn could not afford any more recordable injuries. He told
Prince not to request an MRI, x-ray or any prescription. Feeling pressured, Prince went along with
it and basically lied to the doctor to protect Rock Tenn. At the appointment with Dr. Robert Voight,
Plant Superintendent McMonigle sat in on the entire procedure without Prince’s consent, apparently
to guarantee that Prince would lie to the doctor. As a result, Prince was released for regular work
on September 28, 2011.
Prince subsequently reported Plant Superintendent McMonigle’s implied threats and actions
on the Compliance Hotline, but he was never contacted by anyone regarding this.
Prince knew this was wrong. So he called Human Resources Manager LeBlanc to report this
and that he wanted his back looked at. Prince was told Rock Tenn would call him back. Plant
Manager Mark Wilson called him back, basically saying that Prince already had his back looked at
and if he missed any time it would go under the attendance policy. They kept arguing back and forth
until Prince said that he would call his lawyer and see what to do then. Wilson said that he would
call Prince back. Prince was called back, and another appointment was made with Dr. Voight for
September 29, 2011. Human Resources Manager LeBlanc accompanied Prince to this visit. This
time Prince told the truth about the industrial accident and the injury to his back. This time Dr.
Voight wrote a note for light duty with no bending or twisting, rotating, sitting and standing
periodically.
When he returned to work, Prince gave his boss St. Germaine a copy of the doctor's note.

Despite this St. Germaine had him doing full duty, rotating breaks, pulling sheets of board, picking
up and loading the load former against Dr. Voight’s orders. St. Germaine would bother Prince when
he would rest his back.
On October 3, 2011, Prince called out sick
On October 4, 2011, Prince saw Dr. Voight again. Human Resources Manager LeBlanc met
Prince there at this appointment. Dr. Voight referred Prince to a physical therapist. Dr. Voight
continued Prince on light duty. Despite this, Rock Tenn had Prince doing full duty.
On October 6, 2011, St. Germaine gave Prince and another worker who was on light duty
two trash bags to pick up trash outside the building. This involved bending and twisting. This task
was in violation of the doctor’s orders.
On October 10, 2011, Prince called out sick.
Rock Tenn allows pallets to remain on the floor in an unsafe condition. Prince was
concerned that he might trip over the pallets and make his injury worse.
On October 11, 2011, Prince saw Dr. Voight again. Human Resources Manager LeBlanc
met Prince there at this doctor’s appointment. Dr. Voight continued Prince on light duty.
Prince was missing time from work because of this. So on October 11, 2011, he asked
Human Resources Manager LeBlanc who was responsible for compensation for these days that he
had been missing. Prince requested of LeBlanc that he be provided with worker’s compensation.
He was told that it wasn't Rock Tenn’s problem, it was his. Prince also told the Human Resources
Manager his concerns about the unsafe working conditions. LeBlanc did not resolve Prince’s
concerns. So Prince felt that he was compelled to resign from Rock Tenn, which he did that day.
In his resignation letter Prince stated, among other things: “This plant in my eyes is unsafe.

I was injured on company property and have superiors with unethical acts to better the company.
It’s sad that it had to come down to this. But I honestly hope the court of law handles what is right
and not what is best for any party.”

II.

Argument
A.

Rock Tenn Violated M.G.L.c. 214, § 1B.

Under M.G.L.c. 214, § 1B, “A person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or
serious interference with his privacy.” Without a doubt, a person's medical condition and treatment
are private facts protected by M.G.L. c. 214, § 1B; they are "highly personal or intimate in nature."
Lemire v. Silva, 104 F. Supp. 2d 80 (D. Ma. 2000). Thus a physician's disclosure of confidential
medical information to two people without the consent of the patient was sufficient to warrant
finding of invasion of privacy. Tower v. Hirschhorn, 397 Mass 581 (1986).
On September 28, 2011, after instructing Prince to lie about his medical condition, Rock
Tenn Plant Superintendent McMonigle sat in on Prince’s examination by Dr. Voight without
Prince’s consent. McMonigle’s obvious purpose for this invasion of privacy was to insure that
indeed Prince lied about his medical condition to Dr. Voight. If McMonigle was truly only
interested in whether Prince was fit to return to work, he could have waited for Dr. Voight’s doctor’s
note (as was done in all other appointments with Dr. Voight after Prince told Rock Tenn that he was
going to tell Dr. Voight the truth about his work place injury to his back.)
There could not be a clearer case of invasion of privacy. A third party sat in on a patient’s
doctor’s examination with the patient’s consent. Furthermore, the purpose of this invasion of
privacy was to insure that the patient lied to the doctor about his physical condition and injury.

Summary judgment on this Count must be denied.

B.

Rock Tenn Violated M.G.L.c. 152, § 75B

Under M.G.L.c. 152, § 75B(2) no employer may in any way discriminate against an
employee because the employee has exercised a right afforded under the Worker’s Compensation
statutes.
In this case Rock Tenn repeatedly discriminated against Prince because he reported a work
related injury.
There is no question but that Prince exercised numerous time a right afforded under the
Worker’s Compensation statutes.
First, early on September 27, 2011, Prince called Steven LeBlanc, Rock Tenn’s Human
Resources Manager, and described his workers compensation injury.
Second, later that dame day he reported it again. At approximately 10:00 p.m. that day Prince
woke from a two hour nap and could not get out of bed. His lower back was in tremendous pain.
So Prince called out, saying: "I am unable to come into work tonight due to an injury I received on
the 450 the previous night. Any questions, please call me." When Prince was called by Rock Tenn,
he again described the situation, and an appointment was scheduled with the Rock Tenn physician
at Nashoba Valley Medical Center located in Ayer, Massachusetts.
Third, on September 28, 2011, Prince was examined by the Rock Tenn physician Dr. Voight
for his worker’s compensation injury.
Fourth, as Rock Tenn has volunteered, on September 29, 2011, LeBlanc implicitly
acknowledged Prince’s claim of a worker’s compensation injury and prepared the “Employer’s First

6

Case 1:12-cv-11329-RWZ Document 26 Filed 10/24/13 Page 7 of 8

Report of Injury or Fatality.”
Fifth, after Prince complained to Rock Tenn about being compelled to lie about this worker’s
compensation injury, another appointment was eventually made with Dr. Voight for September 29,
2011.
Sixth, Prince on October 11, 2011, asked Human Resources Manager LeBlanc that he be
provided with worker’s compensation for the days he had been missing, which LeBlanc refused.
Rock Tenn therefore cannot seriously argue that Prince did not exercise a right afforded
under the Worker’s Compensation statutes.
Furthermore, Rock Tenn repeatedly discriminated against Prince for exercising his worker’s
compensation rights.
First, Rock Tenn Plant Superintendent McMonigle pressured Prince to lie about the extent
of his worker’s compensation injury.
Second, McMonigle invaded Prince’s privacy and sat in on his first appointment with Dr.
Voight in order to insure that Prince would lie about the extent of his worker’s compensation injury.
Third, once Dr. Voight put Prince on light duty, Rock Tenn repeatedly still had Prince on
full duty.
Fourth, Dr. Voight specifically limited Prince to no bending or twisting, rotating, sitting and
standing periodically. Yet on October 6, 2011, St. Germaine gave Prince and another worker who
was on light duty two trash bags to pick up trash outside the building. This involved bending and
twisting. This task also was in violation of the doctor’s orders.
Fifth, when Rock Tenn Human Resource Manager LeBlanc denied Prince worker’s
compensation benefits for his missed time and failed to correct Rock Tenn’s actions, Prince felt

7

Case 1:12-cv-11329-RWZ Document 26 Filed 10/24/13 Page 8 of 8

compelled to resign and was thereby constructively discharged.
While Rock Tenn might dispute the above facts, it cannot seriously argue that Prince has not
presented evidence of discrimination because of his reporting a worker’s compensation claim.
Therefore Rock Tenn’s motion for summary judgment on this Count must also be denied.

III.

Conclusion
Rock Tenn’s motion for summary judgment must be denied in its entirety.
