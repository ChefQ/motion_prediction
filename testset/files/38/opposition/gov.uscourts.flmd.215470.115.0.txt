KLEIN & HEUCHAN, INC.'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO COSTAR'S
MOTION IN LIMINE AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant, KLEIN & HEUCHAN, INC. (hereinafter referred to as
"K&H"), by and through its undersigned attorneys, hereby files its Response in Opposition to
Defendants/Counter Plaintiffs COSTAR REALTY INFORMATION, INC. and COSTAR
GROUP, INC.'s (hereinafter collectively referred to as "CoStar") Motion in Limine and
Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Dock. #103), and in support thereof states as follows:

MEMORANDUM OF LAW
I. COSTAR'S MOTION IN LIMINE IS IMPROPER AND MUST BE DENIED AS IT
IS IN ACTUALITY A MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AS TO
SIX (6) OF K&H'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES AND CANNOT SATISFY ITS

BURDEN OF PROVING ANY EVIDENCE RELATING TO THOSE DEFENSES
IS CLEARLY INADMISSIBLE.

CoStar's Motion in Limine effectively requests the Court grant summary judgment in its
favor as to K&H's Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Affirmative
defenses. (Dock. # 25, p. 19-20). CoStar now alleges these well pled and previously
unchallenged defenses are "irrelevant" and are unsupported by any "factual basis". CoStar

correctly states that "[t]he purpose of an in /imine motion is to aid the trial process by enabling

the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence...". Royale
Green Condo. Ass'n v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., No. 07-Civ-21404, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
66064, at *3 (S.D. Fla. July 24, 2009) (Empasis added) (Internal citations omitted). However, it
is well settled that a motion in limine "is not a substitute for a motion for summary judgment."
Royal Indem. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., No. 07-80172-CIV, 2008 WL 2323900, at *1
(S.D. Fla. June 5, 2008) (citing Tuttle v. Tyco Electronics Installation Services, Inc., 2008 WL
343178 (S.D. Ohio February 7, 2008)) (finding courts are reluctant to grant broad exclusions of
evidence in limine, because "`a court is almost always better situated during the actual trial to
assess the value and utility of evidence" and a "court should not make a ruling in limine unless
the moving party meets its burden of showing that the evidence in question is clearly
inadmissible") (quoting Koch v. Koch Indus., Inc., 2 F. Supp. 2d 1385, 1388 (D.Kan.1998))
(Emphasis added).

In denying Liberty Mutual's motion in limine the District Court for the Southern District
of Florida cited to Black's Law Dictionary for the proposition that a motion in limine is, "[A]
pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or offered at trial". Royal
Indem. Co., 2008 WL 2323900, at *1. In its nine (9) page Motion in Limine and Incorporated
Memorandum of Law CoStar does not cite to one (1) specific piece of evidence it contends is
inadmissible. Instead the crux of CoStar's argument is that there is no genuine issue of material
fact as to certain affirmative defenses asserted by H&K. Thus, instead of an attempt to narrow
the evidence proffered at trial, CoStar's motion is an attempt to circumvent the dispositive
motion deadline and narrow the substantive issues to be determined at trial. Motions in limine
are inappropriate for resolving such substantive issues. Royal Indem. Co., at *1. (citing Witness

Systems, Inc. v. Nice Systems, Inc., No. 1:06-cv-126-TCB, 2008 WL 2047633, at *1 (N.D. Ga.
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 115 Filed 02/25/10 Page 3 of 6

May 10, 2008) (finding "Motions in limine address evidentiary questions and are inappropriate
devices for resolving substantive issues").

Further, a motion in limine is not the mechanism by which courts narrow the issues to be
tried. Nor is it the means of testing issues of law. Jd. at *1 (citing Banque Hypothecaire Du
Canton De Geneve v. Union Mines, Inc., 652 F. Supp. 1400, 1401 (D. Md. 1987); and Natural
Resources Defense Council v. Rodgers, 2005 WL 1388671 (E.D. Cal. June 9, 2005)). As
CoStar's motion in limine requests the court disallow six (6) of H&K's affirmative defenses it is
in reality a motion for partial summary judgment in the guise of a motion in limine and must be
summarily denied. See Tuttle v. Tyco Electronics Installation Services, Inc., 2008 WL 343178,
at *5 (finding "Defendant's request to exclude evidence...is more a motion for judgment on the
pleadings or for summary judgment on the issue of emotional damages than it is a motion in
limine. The time for filing such dispositive motions has long closed and Defendants cannot
evade this Court's deadlines simply by captioning its dispositive motion in a creative manner');
see also Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Adie, 176 F.R.D. 246, 249 (E.D. Mich. 1997)
(denying a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence in support of affirmative defenses
because the defendant should have raised the factual sufficiency of the defenses in a motion for
summary judgment not a motion in limine).

Il. THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES UNDER ATTACK IN COSTAR'S MOTION IN
LIMINE ARE LEGALLY VALID DEFENSES TO THE ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST H&K AND H&K IS ENTITLED TO AND INTENDS TO PRESENT
EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THOSE DEFENSES AT TRIAL.

CoStar contends that this Court should disallow H&K to present any evidence in support
of its Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth affirmative defenses because

"they are legally irrelevant". Despite this not being a valid basis for a motion in limine, the case

law (some of which was cited by CoStar in its motion) demonstrates that these defenses are
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 115 Filed 02/25/10 Page 4 of 6

clearly relevant to claims of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. As to H&K's
Ninth Affirmative Defense, CoStar states that "the defense fails factually and legally." (Dock. #
103, p. 5, 1). H&K's Ninth Affirmative Defense alleges that CoStar failed to properly monitor
its license holders and allowed Co-Defendant Scott Bell's infringement to continue. K&H will
demonstrate that CoStar knew Mr. Bell was accessing its online database and did not terminate
his access to the material despite its ability to immediately intervene and stop the infringement.
Despite CoStar's contentions, the law does place a burden on copyright holder's to monitor
potential infringement particularly when they have prior knowledge of it. See Kepner-Tregoe,
Inc. v. Executive Development, Inc., 79 F. Supp. 2d 474, 488 (D. N.J. 1999) (citing Wanlass v.
General Elec. Co., 148 F. 3d 1334, 1338, 1340-41 (Fed.Cir.1998)) (recognizing dual burdens of
complainants "to police their rights" and to raise infringement claims expediently).

As to K&H's defenses of waiver, estoppel, and laches, CoStar does not argue that any
and all evidence K&H could proffer in support of these defenses is inadmissible. Instead, CoStar
argues that "there are absolutely no facts to support" these defenses, and they "are not even
remotely applicable." CoStar fails to cite to any specific evidence it feels is inadmissible in its
motion because there is no evidence presently before the court regarding these issues. However,
simply because there is no record evidence before the court at the moment does not mean that
there is no evidence in support of these defenses that will be relevant and admissible at trial. See
Tuttle v. Tyco Electronics Installation Services, Inc., 2008 WL 343178, at * 3 (finding "[s]imply
because there was no evidence before the Court on summary judgment that indicated the
metadata was not accurate does not mean that there is no such evidence. And, if such evidence
exists, it would certainly be relevant"). In fact, there is evidence to support K&H's defenses and

K&H intends to present such evidence at trial.
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 115 Filed 02/25/10 Page 5of6

The authority cited by CoStar clearly demonstrates that the defenses of waiver, estoppel,
and laches are available in defense of claims of contributory and vicarious copyright
infringement. Because CoStar fails to cite to any forecasted evidence that will be inadmissible
this Court should deny the motion in limine and decide any evidentiary issues that may arise at
trial. See Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. CIBA Vision Corp., 616 F. Supp. 2d 1250,
1256 (M.D. Fla. 2009)) (finding "that this is a bench trial weighs heavily in favor of denying the
motions in limine and addressing the issues raised if and when they come up at trial") (citing
Lifetime Homes, Inc. v. Residential Development Corp.,, 510 F.Supp.2d 794, 811
(M.D.Fla.2007)).

WHEREFORE Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant, KLEIN & HEUCHAN, INC. respectfully
requests this Court deny Defendants/Counter Plaintiffs COSTAR REALTY INFORMATION,
INC. and COSTAR GROUP, INC.'s Motion in Limine and Incorporated Memorandum of Law,
and such other and further relief as this Court deems appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,
