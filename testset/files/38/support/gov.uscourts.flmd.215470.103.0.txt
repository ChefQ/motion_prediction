COSTAR'S MOTION IN LIMINE
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs CoStar Group, Inc. and CoStar Realty Information, Inc.
(collectively, "CoStar'") respectfully submit this Motion in Limine and Memorandum in Support

thereof.
INTRODUCTION

As a commercial real estate sales associate for Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Klein &
Heuchan, Inc. (""K&H"), Counter-Defendant Scott Bell ("Bell") repeatedly accessed and used the
proprietary CoStar online commercial real estate information services without authorization. In
the course of doing so, Bell downloaded and distributed dozens of copyrighted photographs and
market reports to facilitate K&H's real estate brokerage business. Bell recently settled with
CoStar, and the claims against K&H are scheduled for a bench trial during the March 2010 term.
This motion seeks to narrow the scope of the forthcoming bench trial by precluding K&H from |

pursuing an irrelevant and unfounded "blame the victim" defense.
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 103 Filed 02/11/10 Page 2 of 9

In the parties joint Pretrial Statement, K&H listed as contested issues of fact: (a) whether
CoStar took reasonable steps to disable Bell's access to the CoStar online services; (b) whether

CoStar failed to properly monitor its license holders and take reasonable and appropriate action

 

to prevent any alleged infringement; and (c) whether CoStar, Bell or a third-party was
responsible for disabling Bell's password upon expiration of the license agreement. (K&H
Contested Issue of Fact Numbers One, Three and Seven.) Apart from the fact that the suggested
facts are without any factual basis, they are legally irrelevant. For this reason and in order to
streamline the trial, K&H should be precluded from offering evidence on them. -
ARGUMENT |
Motions in limine arise out of "the district court's inherent authority to manage the course |
of trials." Luce v. U.S., 469 U.S. 38, 41 n.4, 105 S. Ct. 460, 83 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1984). "The
purpose of an in /imine motion is to aid the trial process by enabling the Court to rule in advance
of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as to issues that are definitely set for trial,
without lengthy argument at, or interruption of, the trial." Royale Green Condo. Ass'n v. Aspen
Specialty Ins. Co., No. 07-Civ-21404, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66064, at *3 (S.D. Fla. July 24,
2009) (quoting Highland Capital Management, L.P. v. Schneider, 551 F. Supp. 2d 173, 176
(S.D.N.Y. 2008)). Federal Rule of Evidence 401 defines "relevant evidence" as "evidence

having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the

 

determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence." Fed. R. Evid. 401. -

K&H's effort to put CoStar on trial will create a sideshow, or a "trial within a trial," on
issues that have no relevance under Federal Rule of Evidence 401. This case concerns whether

K&H is a vicarious and/or contributory infringer. K&H's conduct is on trial, not CoStar's.

 
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 103 Filed 02/11/10 Page 3 of 9

Accordingly, any evidence that K&H offers for the purpose of blaming CoStar for allowing its

works to be infringed should exclude them from trial.

L The Evidence K&H Seeks to Admit Is Irrelevant as to Liability.

Notwithstanding that the evidence would show that CoStar diligently protects its
copyrights from infringement, K&H's "blame the victim" defense has no place in copyright law
as a legal matter. Liability for copyright infringement, direct or secondary, does not turn on the
extent to which the copyright owner sought to protect its works.

Direct copyright infringement occurs when an individual violates one of the exclusive
rights of a copyright owner. Uncontested Points of Law # 6; Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel.
Serv, Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S. Ct. 1282, 1296 (1991). Contributory infringement occurs
when one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially
contributes to the infringing conduct of another. Uncontested Points of Law # 10; Casella v.
Morris, 820 F.2d 362, 365 (110x2122 Cir. 1987). Vicarious liability arises when someone, regardless
of their knowledge or intent, has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and a
financial interest in the activity. Foley v. Luster, 249 F.3d 1281, 1288 (11th Cir. 2001); BUC
Int'l Corp. v. Int'l Yacht Council Ltd., 489 F.3d 1129, 1139 n. 19 (11th Cir. 2007).

Nothing in copyright law mandates that a copyright owner must police the marketplace in
order to gain the benefit of the legal protections under the Copyright Act. See, e.g., H.M. Kolbe
Co. v. Armgus Textile Co., 315 F.2d 70, 74 (2d Cir. 1963) (copyright law does not impose upon
copyright proprietors the duty of policing the distribution of pirated works); Arista Records v.
Flea World, 356 F. Supp. 2d 411, 417 (D.N.J. 2006) (the argument that copyright owners have
an affirmative duty to police infringing activity on their own and are obligated not to sleep on

their rights relates only to the defense of laches).

Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 103 Filed 02/11/10 Page 4 of 9

Early in the case, K&H pled fair use, a statutory exception to copyright infringement, as
an affirmative defense. Arguing that CoStar is responsible for the infringement does not support
a fair use defense. Fair use concerns whether there is an underlying direct infringement, which is
a predicate for secondary liability. In this case, the parties have stipulations of fact in their Joint
Pretrial Statement that effectively conclude that Bell committed direct infringement.' Moreover,
the Court's ruling on CoStar's summary judgment motion reached the same conclusion, that Bell
infringed CoStar's copyrighted works. See Order, dated November 25, 2009, at 6 ("The
evidence presented shows that Bell directly infringed upon CoStar's valid copyrights.") As such,
fair use is not an issue.

Moreover, none of the three contested facts would establish any of the statutory fair use
factors in any event. Those factors include: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the
nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation
to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. 0x00A7 107. None of the three contested issues of fact fall
within any of the traditional fair uses of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
scholarship, or research. Jd. Bell's use for K&H was commercial and non-transformative. He
used the service, rather than paying the customary license fees. He copied and distributed 100%

of the copyrighted works. And, finally, unauthorized use and copying jeopardizes the market for

 

' In the parties' pretrial disclosures, Bell, K&H and CoStar stipulated that CoStar owns and registered the
copyrights to certain photographs and market reports that Bell downloaded to his computer without authorization.
(See Exhibit C to Pretrial Disclosures (Stipulated Facts), at paragraphs 1-3, 6 and 7.) The parties further stipulated
that (1) the copying of a copyrighted work in the memory of a computer constitutes a "reproduction" under the
Copyright Act; and (2) a prima facie case of copyright infringement exists where the plaintiff owns a valid copyright
and the defendant violated one of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner. (See Exhibit F to Pretrial Disclosures
(Uncontested Points of Law), at paragraphs 6-7.)

 
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 103 Filed 02/11/10 Page 5 of 9

CoStar's copyrighted works. Therefore, the fair use defense would be a non-starter even absent

the Court's earlier ruling and the parties' pretrial stipulations.

Il. The Evidence K&H Seeks to Admit is Irrelevant to an Equitable Defense.

 

None of the three contested facts K&H seeks to establish support the equitable defenses
that K&H pled in "kitchen-sink" fashion in its Answer, including negligence, waiver, estoppel,
laches, and others. (Affirmative Defenses Numbers Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, and
Fourteen.) Factually, CoStar had no knowledge of Bell's infringement at the time that it
occurred. The only testimony on the issue is from Steve Williams, who testified that "CoStar
first detected that Bell was using his Coldwell Banker Commercial NRT-provided user account
from IP addresses associated with Klein & Heuchan in the spring of 2008." (Steve Williams
Summary Judgment Affidavit, at paragraph 16.) K&H does not contest this fact. Accordingly,
that CoStar first learned of the infringing activity in the spring of 2008 and took immediate
action precludes each of these affirmative defenses. Specifically:

1. K&H raised CoStar's purported negligence, in not preventing the infringement, as
an affirmative defense. This defense fails factually and legally. Copyright infringement is a
strict liability offense. As discussed above, although CoStar does protect its copyrights, a
copyright owner need not police the marketplace in order to gain the benefit of the legal
protections under the Copyright Act. See, e.g., HM. Kolbe Co., 315 F.2d at 74 (copyright law
does not impose upon copyright proprietors the duty of policing the distribution of pirated
works); Flea World, 356 F. Supp. 2d at 417 (the argument that copyright owners have an
affirmative duty to police infringing activity on their own and are obligated not to sleep on their

rights relates only to the defense of laches).
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 103 Filed 02/11/10 Page 6 of 9

2. K&H raised waiver as an affirmative defense. In copyright law, waiver occurs
"only if there is an intent by the copyright proprietor to surrender rights in his work.'" Oravec v.
Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures L.C., 469 F. Supp. 2d 1148, 1177 (S.D. Fla. 2006) (quoting Napster
case), aff'd 527 F.3d 1218 (11" Cir. 2008). And that intent must be manifested by some overt
act. Id. Here, this affirmative defense is not even remotely applicable. There is no dispute that
CoStar protects its copyrights and, upon learning of the infringing activity by K&H and Bell,
acted promptly to stop it. K&H has no factual basis to assert a defense of waiver.

3. K&H pled estoppel as an affirmative defense. The defense of estoppel requires
that: (1) the copyright owner knew the facts of the infringement, (2) the copyright owner
intended its conduct to be acted upon or the copyright owner acted such that the alleged infringer
has a right to believe it was so intended, (3) the alleged infringer is ignorant of the true facts, and
(4) the alleged infringer relies on the copyright owner's conduct to his detriment. Thornton v. J
Jargon Co., 580 F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1282 (M.D. Fla. 2008); Penguin Books v. New Christian
Church, No. 96-Civ-4126 (RWS), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10394, * 51-52, 55 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1680
(S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2000). As with waiver, this is not even remotely applicable. There is no
dispute that CoStar protects its copyrights and, upon learning of the infringing activity at issue
here, acted promptly to stop it. K&H has no factual basis to assert a defense of estoppel.

4. Laches is an affirmative defense requiring that: (1) Plaintiff delayed in asserting
his rights; (2) the delay was not excusable; and (3) there was undue prejudice to Defendants.
Thornton, 580 F. Supp. 2d at 1286; Oravec, 469 F. Supp. 2d at 1176. As with waiver and
estoppel, there are absolutely no facts to support this affirmative defense.

5. Finally, as to its thirteenth affirmative defense, K&H pled that any damages

sought by CoStar are attributable to and were caused by a third-party. That affirmative defense

 

 

 

 
Case 8:08-cv-01227-JSM-EAJ Document 103 Filed 02/11/10 Page 7 of 9

has no application in an action regarding secondary infringement, however, as every case of
contributory or vicarious liability necessarily involves the defendant being held to answer for the
direct conduct of another. See Flea World, Inc., 356 F. Supp. 2d 411, 416-17 (D. N.J. 2006)
(striking same argument when pled as an affirmative defense). Here, CoStar alleges that K&H is
legally responsible for the direct infringement by Bell because it had knowledge of and induced
or materially contributed to Bell's infringing activity (contributory infringement), or had the
ability to supervise and control it and financially benefitted from it (vicarious liability). Thus,

this affirmative defense fails and the three contested issues of fact are irrelevant.

CONCLUSION
For these reasons, CoStar respectfully requests the Court grant its motion in Jimine in
order to streamline the trial to exclude evidence that seeks to place blame for infringement on
CoStar. Such purported evidence is not "relevant" for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 401

and will only cause delay, waste and interruption at trial.
