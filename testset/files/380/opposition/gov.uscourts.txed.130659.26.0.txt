Civil Action No. 4:11-cv-00343

DEFENDANT, PALISADES COLLECTION, LLC’S, RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO QUASH ANSWER AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC (“Palisades”) submits this response to the
Motion to Quash Answer and Affirmative Defenses filed by Plaintiff, David E. Mack
(“Plaintiff”). Plaintiff’s Motion to Quash is improper for 3 reasons. First, the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for such a motion or remedy. Second, even if
Plaintiff’s Motion is construed as a motion to strike, the Motion is nonetheless improper
because it does not comport with the requirements or purpose of Rule 12(f). Third, to the
extent the Court construes Plaintiff’s Motion as a motion for default, Plaintiff’s Motion is
premature (Plaintiff has not provided proof of service), and the Court should give
Palisades an opportunity to respond and ultimately deny any motion for default. Palisades
has answered, Palisades has meritorious defenses, and any delay in responding to the
Complaint was not the result of gross carelessness or bad faith.

Procedural Background

On June 10, 2011, Plaintiff filed his Original Complaint alleging violations of the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq., and on June 13, 2011,
Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint (“Complaint”). Plaintiff claims “upon information
and belief” Palisades received the summons via certified mail, making its Answer due on
July 15, 2011. (Dtk. 1 and 4.) Plaintiff admits “[t]he exact date of service is not verified
by affidavit at this time . . . .” (Dkt. 19, ¶ 2.)
On July 21, 2011 – Six days after Plaintiff’s estimated deadline – Palisades filed
its Answer and Affirmative Defenses (“Answer”). (Dkt. 12.) On August 10, 2011 – more
than 2 weeks after Palisades filed its answer – Plaintiff filed his Motion to Quash Answer
and Affirmative Defenses requesting the Court “Quash the Answer and Affirmative
Defenses of Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC and allow the Plaintiff to move
forward with a Clerk’s Default and Default Judgment for damages requested . . . .” (Dkt.
19.)
II.
A.

Argument

Plaintiff’s Motion To Quash Is Procedurally Improper.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for “motions to quash
answers.” Notably, Plaintiff’s motion is not supported by a single citation to the FRCP or
case law.
Rule 55(a) allows for entry of default when “a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is
shown by affidavit or otherwise.” (emphasis added). So, if Plaintiff had filed an affidavit

2

Case 4:11-cv-00343-MHS -ALM Document 26

Filed 08/29/11 Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 74

showing Palisades was served with the Complaint, and if Palisades had failed to plead in
response to the Complaint, then Plaintiff may have been able to file a motion for default.
However, neither is the case here. Plaintiff did not file an affidavit of service, and
Palisades did respond to the Complaint.
Plaintiff likely recognizes he cannot file a motion for default and is instead trying
to create a means to strike Palisades’s Answer where one does not exist. Plaintiff’s
motion should be denied.
B.

Plaintiff’s Motion Is Not Proper Under Rule 12(f).

To the extent the Court considers Plaintiff’s Motion a motion to strike under Rule
12(f), Plaintiff’s Motion should still be denied. Rule 12(f) provides very limited
circumstances for striking pleadings, stating “the Court may order stricken from any
pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or
scandalous matter.” Plaintiff in his Motion to Quash “does not comport with the purpose
of Rule 12(f).” Am. S. Ins. Co. v. Buckley, 748 F.Supp.2d 610, 628 (E.D. Tex. 2010). The
rule does not provide for striking an entire pleading, and Plaintiff has not asserted
Palisades Answer contains any “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous
matter.”
In the ASIC v. Buckley matter, the Eastern District addressed a very similar fact
pattern: the plaintiff moved to strike the defendant’s answer because it was untimely. Id.
at 615. The Court held defendant’s “answers and counterclaim should not be stricken
based solely on [plaintiff’s] argument that they are untimely.” Id. at 627-28. “To strike
the pleadings on this basis alone would be a drastic and harsh remedy,” and the prejudice
3

Filed 08/29/11 Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 75

to Palisades “in having [its] defenses and claims stricken in their entirety is greater than
the prejudice suffered by [Plaintiff] due to the untimeliness of [Palisades’s] pleadings.”
Id. at 628.
C.

A Motion For Default Judgment Is Premature And Palisades Should Be Provided
An Opportunity To Respond.

Plaintiff’s Motion is obviously not a motion for default. Plaintiff even states he is
moving “the Court to quash the Answer and Affirmative Defenses” and to “allow [him]
to move forward with a Clerk’s Default and Default Judgment.” (Dkt. 19 (emphasis
added).) However, to the extent the Court considers Plaintiff’s Motion a motion for
default, the Motion should still be denied.
As stated above, a default would be improper because Plaintiff has not filed an
affidavit of service, and Palisades has already plead in response to the Complaint
showing its intent to defend. Further, Plaintiff’s Motion to Quash is an improper means
for seeking a default. Rule 55(b)(2) provides “if the party against whom a default
judgment is sought has appeared personally or by a representative, that party or its
representative must be served with written notice of the application at least 7 days before
the hearing.”
Moreover, a default would be improper, and the Court should not allow Plaintiff to
seek a default in the future.

As evidenced by Palisades’s Answer, Palisades has

meritorious defenses to Plaintiff’s allegations, Palisades alleged 6-day delay in answering
the Complaint has not resulted in any prejudice to Plaintiff, and any failure to timely

respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint was not the result of gross carelessness, ignorance of the
rules, or bad faith.
III.

Conclusion

WHEREFORE, Palisades respectfully requests this Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion
to Quash Answer and Affirmative Defenses, deny Plaintiff’s request for leave to file a
motion for default, and for such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.
