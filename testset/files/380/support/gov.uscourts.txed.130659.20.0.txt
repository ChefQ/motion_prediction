MOTION TO QUASH ANSWER AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:

Plaintiff David E Mack files this Motion to Quash the Answer and Affirmative Defenses of
Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC and in support thereof would show the Court as follows:
1. The Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC was served according to the Local Rules of Civil

Procedure 5(e).

2. Palisades Collections, LLC was served by Certified mail under the local rules of the Court
by the United States Marshals Service and received service upon information and belief on
June 24, 2011. The exact date of service is not verified by affidavit at this time due to the
United States Marshals Service not yet having returned the affidavit of service to the Court
as verification of service on that date.

3. Under rule 12(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the Defendant has 20 days to
respond not counting the day of service. As such, the Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC

had until July 14, 2011 to reply/answer the complaint. The Defendant Palisades Collection,

LLC did not respond until July 22, 2011 which is 8 days past their obligation to respond
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

4. Due to the Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC's lack of response according to the Rules,
their Answer and Affirmative Defenses are Moot upon their face and should be Quashed as
the answer was not filed in a timely manner under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff moves this Court to Quash the Answer and Affirmative
Defenses of Defendant Palisades Collection, LLC and allow the Plaintiff to move forward
with a Clerk's Default and Default Judgment for damages requested in Plaintiff's Amended
Complaint when verified service is provided to the court by the United States Marshals

Service.
