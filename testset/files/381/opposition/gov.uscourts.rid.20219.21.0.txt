GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S
MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE OF TRIAL DATE AND
PRE-TRIAL ORDER DEADLINES
In the above-captioned case, the defendant has moved that
the trial date, as well as the pre-trial order deadlines, be
continued for one month.

As The government does not object.

Given that counsel for the defendant has only recently been
appointed, the government believes that the ends of justice would
be served by the brief continuance sought.
Respectfully submitted,
ROBERT CLARK CORRENTE
