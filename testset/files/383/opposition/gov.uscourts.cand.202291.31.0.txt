The undersigned, Matthew Rafat, being first duly sworn, declares as follows:

Document 31

I am over 18 years old, am competent to testify, am basing my statements on personal
knowledge, and if called to testify, I will do so willingly.

My mailing address is PO Box 111351, Campbell, CA 95011-1351. My office is located
at 28 N 1st St., Suite 305, San Jose, CA 95113. I represent Mr. McKee, Wang, and Silva.

Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and accurate copy of an email I sent to Mr. Gregory Charles

7

on May 6, 2008, stating, “[Y]our motion to remand must focus on securities law…I do not
8

contest that defendants lack diversity jurisdiction.”

Attached as Exhibit 2 is a true and accurate copy of the first three pages of Defendant’s

I spoke with Defendant Diane Bjorkstrom’s counsel and informed him of the removal to
federal court. He did not indicate to me that he opposed the removal to federal court.

6.

Attached as Exhibit 3 is the SEC letter and subpoena received by my firm. Similar letters
were sent to Defendants McKee and Silva. I spoke with the SEC attorney assigned to the
case. He knew Jefferson “Jeff” Stamp, Plaintiff’s counsel, and indicated that Plaintiff had
requested the SEC’s involvement. During Defendant “Steve” Wang’s deposition in

18

another state court case, Jeff Stamp led a process server into the room, whereupon the
19

SEC papers were served on Mr. Wang. Right before effectuating service, Mr. Stamp took

24

the SEC subpoena out of the envelope and put it directly in Mr. Wang’s range of eyesight. Mr. Stamp did not inform me about the SEC subpoena so I could agree to accept
service on my client’s behalf after his state court deposition.
The undersigned hereby declares under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct under
the laws of the State of California and executes this Declaration on June 19, 2008 in San Jose, CA.
