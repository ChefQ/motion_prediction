DOLLAR PHONE CORP.
Defendant.

CORRECTED RESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS OR CHANGE VENUE

COMES NOW, Nationwide Telecom Inc., by and through its undersigned attorneys,
BKN Murray LLP, and respectfully submits the following Corrected Response to Motion to
Dismiss or Change Venue.

Plaintiff contends there is personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff

pursuant to the Colorado Long Arm Statute and Due Process. Likewise venue is appropriate
before this court.
1. There is Personal Jurisdiction
A. Burden of Proof: Plaintiff concedes that it bears the burden of establishing
jurisdiction over the Defendant.
B. Elements: Plaintiff agrees with Defendants’ identification of the elements for
personal jurisdiction when the traditional bases for personal jurisdiction do not
exist.
C. Dollar Phone Corp. has sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy Due Process

2

I.

Colorado Long Arm Statute and Due Process Analysis
a. Colorado Long Arm Statute Applies

Defendant’s tortious conduct meets the threshold standard. In enacting the Long Arm
Statute., “the Colorado legislature intended to extend the jurisdiction of our courts to the fullest
extent permitted by the due process clauses of the United States and Colorado Constitutions.”
Fleet Leasing, Inc. v. District Court In and For City and County of Denver, 649 P.2d 1074
(1982) [internal citations omitted]. A party asserting personal jurisdiction over a defendant under
the Long Arm Statute must make a prima facie showing of threshold jurisdiction in its
Complaint. Id. (“Threshold jurisdiction exists when it is demonstrated that tortious conduct
initiated in another state ultimately caused injury in Colorado and that requiring a defense to the
tort action in this state would be consistent with due process of law.”).
In its Amended Complaint, Plaintiff averred it is a worldwide telecommunications company
based in Colorado providing international telephone services to its clients. (Amended Complaint,
¶¶1, 10, Docket # 10). In Colorado, Plaintiff contracted with Qwest Communications, now
Century Link, for an international SIP Trunk Line. (Docket # 10, ¶¶ 7, 8, 9). Plaintiff buys
wholesale bandwidth on CenturyLink’s T1 Trunk line to provide international telephone services
to its customers. (Docket 10, ¶ 12). Plaintiff has not contracted with, or allowed Dollar Phone
Corp. to access its T1 Trunk Line. (Docket #10, ¶ 13). Defendant Dollar Phone Corp. accessed
Plaintiff’s T1 Trunk Line without authorization causing Plaintiff’s Trunk Line to be loaded with
calls from Dollar Phone’s Voice Over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) route. (Docket #10, ¶ 16)
Dollar Phone then improperly resold Plaintiff’s network VoIP route to Colorado Consumers for

3

profit.1 (Docket #10, ¶¶ 16-17, 24). CenturyLink, in Colorado, billed Plaintiff over $65,000.00
for Defendant Dollar Phone’s illegal use of the T1 Trunk Line. (Docket #10, ¶ 27).
b. General Jurisdiction
The Colorado Supreme court in Croxton & Trench Holding Corp., 90 F.3d 1523, 1533
(10th Cir.1996) provides, “[g]eneral jurisdiction exists when the defendant's contacts with the
forum state are so ‘continuous and systematic’ that jurisdiction is appropriate even when the
claims are unrelated to the defendant's contacts with the forum state.” Id [internal citations
omitted]. Defendant hides behind the illusionary distinction between Dollar Phone Enterprises
and Dollar Phone Corp. to support its argument that it “solicits no business, sends no agents to
solicit business, does not hold itself out as doing business, does not advertise or have any bank
accounts in Colorado. (MTD, Docket #20, p.4) Instead Defendant asserts “Dollar Phone Corp.
from the New York metropolitan area deals only on a wholesale level with clients who are not
end users, and thus it is irrelevant that an end user in Colorado though another company that is a
customer of Dollar Phone Corp. placed a call. . .” (MTD, Docket #20, p. 3).
The “company that is a customer of Dollar Phone Corp.” is Dollar Phone Enterprises.2
Pursuant to Dollar Phone’s website, “Prepaid calling card services are provided by Dollar Phone
Enterprise, Inc., and independent distributor of Dollar Phone Corp. Dollar Phone is a registered
trademark of Dollar Phone Corp. and is licensed to its distributors.” The United States Patent
and Trademark office defines a Trademark as “a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that

1

Defendant asserts that Dollar Phone Enterprises, as compared to Dollar Phone Corp., markets and sales the
international calling time to Colorado Residents. Even accepting this argument as true, the unauthorized access of
Plaintiff’s Trunk Line was by Dollar Phone Corp which it resold for an improper profit.
2
Dollar Phone Corp.’s address on its bank statements provided by Defendant the same address Dollar Phone
Enterprises lists on its website. (Defendant’s Exhibit C to MTD, hereafter exhibit A;
http://www1.dollarphone.com/contact/).

4

identifies and distinguishes the source of goods of one party from those of others.” This is
Dollar Phone Corp.’s Trademark:

.
Dollar Phone Corp. holds itself out as doing business in Colorado by using its trademark
to advertise telecommunications services. Indeed a consumer can buy a prepaid calling card
printed with the Dollar Phone Corp.’s Trademark throughout Colorado.

(Dollar Phone

International Pinless calling card front and back, attached as Exhibit B). Furthermore, on the
back of the Dollar Phone calling card it lists local access numbers in Colorado. (Ex. B). Dollar
Phone Enterprises’ website, using the Dollar Phone Trademark, makes direct sales to
Coloradoans. To counteract this fact, Defendant asserts that a passive website simply making
information available cannot confer general jurisdiction.
Dollar Phone’s website is not just merely informative. A Colorado consumer can buy
telecommunications services originating from Dollar Phone Corp. through its website.
http://www1.dollarphone.com/dollarphone-pinless/. This is distinguishable from Defendant’s
reliance on Boppy Co., v. Luvee Products Corp., No. 04-MK-320 (OES), 2004 WL 2608265 at
*4-5 (D.Colo. May 25, 2004). In Boppy Co, Luvee only sold its product to Coloradoans on its
website and did not sell products at Colorado stores. Contrast with Dollar Phone Corp.’s
activities. Here Dollar Phone Corp., through its Trademark, solicited Coloradoans in Colorado
stores to buy its product making general jurisdiction is appropriate. See generally, Helicoptros
Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 416 (1984).

5

a. Specific Jurisdiction
Dollar Phone Corp. cannot escape jurisdiction by hiding behind its distributor. Specific
jurisdiction exists when the defendant has “purposely directed” activities at residents of the
forum and the litigation results from alleged injuries arising out of or relating to those activities.
Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985).
The Court in Watson v. Dillon Companies, Inc., 615 F.Supp.2d 1221 (D.Colo. 2009) interpreted
“purposely directed” to include a company that markets its products in other States through a
well established distribution chain.
The Court in Watson analyzed Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court of California,
480 U.S. 102, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987) to find specific jurisdiction. While Asahi
states “a defendant's awareness that the stream of commerce may or will sweep the product into
the forum State does not convert the act of placing the product into the stream into an act
purposefully directed toward the forum state” it also held additional conduct can establish
specific jurisdiction. Id. at 112. The Supreme Court elaborated:
[additional conduct] may indicate an intent or purpose to serve the market
in the forum State, for example, designing the product for the market in
the forum State, advertising in the forum State, establishing channels for
providing regular advice to customers in the forum State, or marketing the
product through a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in
the forum State."
Id. at 107 [emphasis added]
Hence if the sale of a product ... is not simply an isolated occurrence, but
arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly
or indirectly, the market for its product in other States, it is not
unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States …
Id. at 117.
Accordingly, the Court in Watson found specific jurisdiction,

6

Here, the facts indicate that FONA's actions in creating butter flavorings
specifically for companies that make microwave popcorn for sale in
grocery stores to consumers means that sale of its products in Colorado is
not simply fortuitous, happenstance, or isolated, but arises from its own
efforts ‘to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its products in other
States’ through a well established distribution chain.
Watson, 615 F.Supp.2d at 1227. [internal citations omitted][emphasis added].
Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor Plaintiff, it has established a prima facie
showing regarding the requisite minimum contacts. Specifically Dollar Phone Corp., without
authorization, obtained access to Plaintiff’s T1 Trunk Line causing CenturyLink to bill Plaintiff
over $65,000.00 dollars in fraudulently obtained telecommunication services. Dollar Phone
Corp., through its self-proclaimed distributor, sold these minutes to Coloradoans. (Excel
Spreadsheet identifying 1866 calls made from Colorado numbers originated from Plaintiff’s
improperly obtained Trunk Line, Exhibit C).
Dollar Phone Corp. obtained call minutes with the intent, through the use of Dollar Phone
Enterprises, to sale those minutes to Coloradoans. Dollar Phone Corp. purchased wholesale
telecommunication services at the national telecommunications market, worked closely with its
distributor Dollar Phone Enterprises to provide Coloradoans with call minutes and was aware the
Trunk Line would be loaded with calls from Coloradoan consumers it availed itself. Specific
jurisdiction is appropriate.

Watson, 615 F.Supp.2d at 1227.(citing Rockwell Int'l Corp. v.

Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta, 553 F.Supp. 328 (E.D.Pa.1982)).
D. Personal Jurisdiction does Not Defeat Traditional Notions of Fair Play and
Substantial Justice
A Colorado Company was the victim of unauthorized access of its T1 Trunk Line, which
resulted in significant damages due to an outstanding CenturyLink bill. The theft was committed

7

in Colorado. Defendant Dollar Phone makes considerable money selling its product nationwide,
including Colorado.
Dollar Phone Corp. asserts litigating in Denver will be extremely costly. Even assuming
the additional cost of out-of-state litigation, the burden on Defendant will not be significant.
Dollar Phone Corp. has been registered as of 1999 and has been in business ever since. (About
Us Screenshot Dollar Phone Website, hereafter Exhibit D, “DollarPhone Corp has over 550
Different calling card brands addressing every ethnic market.”) Dollar Phone does 250,000,000
min per month of long distance traffic. Figuring an average retail rate of 0.05 that amounts to
$12-$15 million monthly revenue. ( Ex. D)
Taking into account the interest of the State in protecting its citizens from
misappropriation of telecommunication services and the light burden of out-of-state litigation;
application of personal jurisdiction on Dollar Phone Corp. does not violate traditional notions of
fair play and substantial justice. See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477.
2. Colorado Venue is Proper in This Case
A. Burden of Proof: Defendant.
B. Elements: Plaintiff agrees with Defendants’ case law and statutes pertaining to
Venue.
C. 28 U.S.C. § 1391 Confers Venue United States District Court - Denver District
Court
a. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)
As fully discussed above, the court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant.
Therefore, venue is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) (“a judicial district in where any
defendant resides. . .”).

8

b. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)
Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) “a judicial district in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. . . “ Id. As fully
briefed above: (1) Plaintiff contracted with Century Link in Colorado for a wholesale T1 Trunk
Line; (2) Dollar Phone Corp. gained unauthorized access to that same T1 Trunk line; (3)
Resulting in Plaintiff receiving a CenturyLink bill for over $65,000.00; (5) Dollar Phone,
through its distributor sold access to the unauthorized trunk line through calling cards purchased
in Colorado stores; and (6) Over 1800 calls using the stolen minutes originated from Colorado.
3. Venue Should Not Be Transferred to the Eastern District of New York
A. Burden of Proof: Defendant.
B. Elements: Plaintiff agrees with Defendants’ case law and statutes pertaining to
Venue Transfer.
Defendant requests a change of venue to the Eastern District of New York. In support of
its request it makes unilateral trial strategy decisions. Defendants assert that “[a]ll evidence and
sources of proof regarding Defendant’s routing of this traffic is in the New York Area.” (Docket
20, p, 8) While some witnesses may come from the New York Metropolitan area, an equal
amount of witnesses are likely in Colorado. Witnesses in Colorado will include Plaintiff and his
employees responsible for the telecommunication operations and CenturyLink employees and
representatives. Witnesses from CenturyLink will likely have to testify regarding the sale of
Trunk Lines, billing, unauthorized access and investigations into same.
Balancing the factors in Chrysler Credit, the weight does not side with the Defendant’s
request. Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court deny Defendant’s request to change venue.

9

WHEREFORE Plaintiff requests that the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss or Change
Venue be denied and for any other relief that this court deems proper.
Respectfully submitted this 24th day of January, 2017.
