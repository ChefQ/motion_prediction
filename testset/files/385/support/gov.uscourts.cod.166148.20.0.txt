Civil Action No. 16-cv2495-MJW

MOTION TO DISMISS OR CHANGE VENUE
Defendant Dollar Phone Corp. (“DPC”), by and through its undersigned counsel, for its
Motion to Dismiss, states as follows:
Pre Motion Conference as Per Local Rules
Pursuant to the local rules, counsel communicated with counsel for Plaintiff Aimee Bove,
Esq. by email on December 8, 2016 and December 29, 2016, and then in a long email trail back
and forth on January 3, 2017 regarding DPC’s motion to dismiss or transfer venue. Aimee Bove
would not consent to the motion.

A copy of this email conference is annexed to the

accompanying Declaration of Edward N. Gewirtz.

I. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED DUE TO A LACK OF
PERSONAL JURISDICTION.
To maintain the instant action against Defendant, the Court must have personal
jurisdiction over Defendant, and venue must be proper in this Court. “Where, as here, a
defendant seeks dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears

the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction over the defendant.” Fairbrother v. Am.
Monument Found., LLC, 340 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 1151 (D. Colo. 2004) (citing Wenz v. Memery
Crystal, 55 F.3d 1503, 1505 (10th Cir. 1995). “The plaintiff has the duty to support jurisdictional
allegations in a complaint by competent proof of the supporting facts if the jurisdictional
allegations are challenged by an appropriate pleading.” Pytlik v. Professional Resources, Ltd.,
887 F.2d 1371, 1376 (10th Cir. 1989). “[O]nly the well pled facts of plaintiff's complaint, as
distinguished from mere conclusory allegations, must be accepted as true.” Wenz, 55 F.3d at
1505. Further, in the interests of equity, expediency, and fair treatment of the parties, federal law
establishes that venue is proper only in certain judicial districts, to the exclusion of all others. 28
U.S.C. §1391(a).
II. BASES OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION
In order to obtain jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, a plaintiff “must establish
that (1) jurisdiction is proper under the laws of the forum state and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction
does not offend due process.” Fairbrother, 340 F. Supp. 2d at 1152 (quotation marks omitted
and citing Doering v. Copper Mountain, Inc., 259 F.3d 1202, 1209 (10th Cir. 2001)). Because
Colorado’s long arm statute confers jurisdiction coextensive with due process of law,
constitutional analysis is appropriate. See Fairbrother, 340 F. Supp. 2d at 1152. In order to show
that the Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over Defendant is within the bounds of the Due
Process Clause, Plaintiff must either show that one of the traditional bases for personal
jurisdiction exists, or that Defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with Colorado as to
warrant the Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction.

III. NO TRADITIONAL BASIS EXISTS FOR PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN
COLORADO OVER DEFENDANT
The three traditional bases for the exercise of personal jurisdiction are: (1) service within
the forum state, see Burnham v. Sup. Ct., 495 U.S. 604, 619 (1990), (2) domicile in the forum
state, see Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 462-63 (1940)), and (3) consent to the forum state’s
exercise of personal jurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(h)(1); National Equip. Rental, Ltd. v.
Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, 316 (1964). Plaintiff does not allege that any of the traditional bases for
personal jurisdiction apply. Defendant was not served in Colorado, Defendant is not domiciled in
Colorado, and Defendant has not consented to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in Colorado.
Declaration of Sam Klinger. Thus, there can be no traditional basis for the assertion of personal
jurisdiction over defendant. While Plaintiff has claimed during the pre-motion conference that
calls were placed from an end user in Colorado that were then transmitted by Dollar Phone
Corp., as set forth in the accompanying declarations including that of Chris Zambito, Dollar
Phone Corp. from the New York metropolitan area deals only on a whole sale level with clients
who are not end users, and thus it is irrelevant that an end user in Colorado, through another
company that is a customer of Dollar Phone Corp., placed a call that was sent through Dollar
Phone Corp.’s switch in the New York metropolitan area.
IV. DEFENDANT IS NOT SUBJECT TO GENERAL OR SPECIFIC PERSONAL
JURISDICTION
Courts may “exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if minimum
contacts exist between the defendant and the forum state such that maintenance of the lawsuit
would not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” Fairbrother, 340 F.

Supp. 2d at 1152 (citing Doering, 259 F.3d at 1210). “The minimum contacts requirement may
be satisfied by a showing of either general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction.” Id.
A. Defendant Has No Continuous and Systematic Activity in Colorado That Would
Support a Finding of General Jurisdiction
Defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction if its contacts with the forum state are
sufficient to “constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts”
required for general jurisdiction. Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S.
408, 416 (1984). In assessing contacts with a forum state, the Tenth Circuit consider factors such
as: “(1) whether the corporation solicits business in the state through a local office or agents; (2)
whether the corporation sends agents into the state on a regular basis to solicit business; (3) the
extent to which the corporation holds itself out as doing business in the forum state, through
advertisements, listings or bank accounts; and (4) the volume of business conducted in the state
by the corporation.” Kuenzle v. HTM Sport-Und Freizeitgerate AG, 102 F.3d 453, 457 (10th Cir.
1996) (citation omitted).
It is indisputable that Defendant is not subject to general jurisdiction in Colorado.
Defendant solicits no business in Colorado and only solicits business in New York. Declaration
of Sam Klinger. Defendant does not regularly send agents into Colorado to solicit business.
Declaration of Sam Klinger.. Defendant does not hold itself out as doing business in Colorado.
Declaration of Sam Klinger.. Defendant does not advertise or have any bank accounts in
Colorado. Declaration of Sam Klinger.. Finally, the volume of business conducted by Defendant
in Colorado is zero. Declaration of Sam Klinger. Defendant does not maintain a website.
Declaration of Sam Klinger. Declaration of Abe Greenfield. Moreover, even if Dollar Phone had
a passive website, which it does not, “[E]xercising personal jurisdiction is not appropriate when

the Internet use involves [a] passive Web site that does little more than make information
available to those who are interested in it.” Soma Med. Int’l v. Standard Chartered Bank, 196
F.3d 1292, 1296 (10th Cir. 1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Boppy
Co. v. Luvee Products Corp., No. 04-MK-320 (OES), 2004 WL 2608265 at *4-5 (D. Colo. May
25, 2004) (finding no purposeful availment and thus no specific jurisdiction even where
Colorado residents could purchase items from a website: “the Court cannot say that merely
because Colorado residents can order from Luvee, the company has purposefully directed its
activities towards Coloradans, any more than it has directed its activities towards the nation (or
world) in general.”) (emphasis in original).
Defendant further has no future intention to expand its business into Colorado. In any
event, the inquiry, however, does not delve into the abstract discussion of whether the defendant
might, at some undefined point in the future, engage in business in Colorado or conduct other
activities which might later satisfy the “minimum contacts” analysis. The inquiry is whether at
the time of filing, the Defendant has sufficient minimum contacts to warrant the exercise of
personal jurisdiction. Pecoraro v. Sky Ranch for Boys, Inc., 340 F.3d 558, 562 (8th Cir.
2003)(“Minimum contacts must exist either at the time the cause of action arose, the time the suit
is filed, or within a reasonable period of time immediately prior to the filing of the lawsuit.”).
Accordingly, Defendant is not subject to general jurisdiction in Colorado.
B. Defendant Has Not Purposefully Availed Itself of the Benefits Offered by Colorado so as
to Support a Finding of Specific Jurisdiction.
To establish specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant, a defendant’s contacts with
the forum state “must reflect purposeful availment and the cause of action must arise out of those
contacts.” Kuenzle, 102 F.3d at 456 (emphasis in original). Purposeful availment does not exist

where the contacts are merely random, fortuitous, or attenuated; to wit, the contacts must be
“purposefully directed” towards residents of the forum state. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,
471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985). Further, the defendant’s actions must create a “substantial connection
with the forum state.” OMI Holdings, Inc. v. Royal Insurance Co. of Canada, 149 F.3d 1086,
1091 (10th Cir. 1998) (citing Asahi Metal Industry Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court of California, 480
U.S. 102, 109 (1987)).
Here, Defendant has done nothing to purposefully avail itself of the benefits of
conducting business in Colorado, nor has the Defendant purposefully directed contacts towards
residents of Colorado. There is no basis for specific jurisdiction in Colorado offered by Plaintiff.
The Amended Complaint makes no allegations whatsoever that Defendant purposefully availed
itself of the benefits of conducting business in Colorado.
C. Even if the Court Were to Find Personal Jurisdiction, Exercise of the Same Would
Defeat Traditional Notions of Fair Play and Substantial Justice.
Even if the Court were to find that it has personal jurisdiction over Defendant based upon
minimum contacts, the Court should still grant Defendant’s motion to dismiss because the
exercise of personal jurisdiction “would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial
justice.” Asahi Metal, 480 U.S. at 113 (internal quotations omitted). Courts consider the
following factors when making this determination:
the burden on the defendant, the forum States interest in adjudicating the dispute,
the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate
judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of
controversies, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering
fundamental substantive social policies.

Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477 (internal quotations omitted). Defendant has no contacts in
Colorado and thus it would be significantly burdensome for it to defend the suit in Colorado.
Declaration of Sam Klinger. Defendant owns no property, has no employees, and is not licensed
to do business in Colorado. Declaration of Sam Klinger.. It would be extremely difficult and
costly for defendant to travel across the country from New York to Colorado in order to
participate in the litigation. Declaration of Sam Klinger.; OMI Holdings, 149 F.3d at 1096
(“While not dispositive, the burden on the defendant of litigating the case in a foreign forum is of
primary concern in determining the reasonableness of personal jurisdiction.”).
Moreover, the State of Colorado does not have a strong interest in adjudicating the
dispute. Thus, even if the Court were to find sufficient minimum contacts to support personal
jurisdiction, exercise of said jurisdiction would offend traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice.
V. THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED DUE TO IMPROPER VENUE
Per 28 U.S.C. § 1391, venue is proper in the following three circumstances:
(1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents
of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a
substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there
is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this
section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal
jurisdiction with respect to such action.
See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)-(3). Since Defendant is a corporation, it “shall be deemed to reside . .
. in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction

with respect to the civil action in question.” 28 U.S.C. §1391(c)(2). If the Court determines that
venue is improper in Colorado, the Court is empowered to cure the defect by dismissing the
action. 28 U.S.C. §1406(a).
Here, as set forth above, Defendant is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Colorado
based on any traditional bases for personal jurisdiction or through minimum contacts with
Colorado. As such, Defendant cannot be deemed to reside in Colorado within the definition of 28
U.S.C. §1391(c), and therefore venue in Colorado is improper under 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(1).
Further, as discussed above, no substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiff’s claim
occurred in Colorado. To the contrary, the alleged calls were routed by Dollar Phone Corp.’s
switch which is located in the New York metropolitan area Declaration of Chris Zambito. Thus,
venue in Colorado is improper under 28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(2). 28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(3) is inapplicable
here because there are other districts in which this action could have been brought, namely the
Eastern District of New York.
Defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss the action for improper venue
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).
VI. ALTERNATIVELY, VENUE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE EASTERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Alternatively, the Court should transfer the case to the Eastern District of New York. 28
U.S.C. § 1404(a) provides: “For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of
justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it
might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.” 28
U.S.C. § 1404(a). This determination is placed firmly within the discretion of the district court
on an individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness. See Chrysler

Credit Corp. v. Country Chrysler, Inc., 928 F.2d 1509, 1515 (10th Cir. 1991). As an initial
matter, the instant action could have been brought in the Eastern District of New York because
Dollar Phone Corp. is subject to personal jurisdiction and is thus a resident of the Eastern District
of New York. Declaration of Sam Klinger; 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1). Relevant factors in the
transfer analysis include:
the plaintiff’s choice of forum; the accessibility of witnesses and other sources of
proof, including the availability of compulsory process to insure attendance of
witnesses; the cost of making the necessary proof; questions as to the enforceability
of a judgment if one is obtained; relative advantages and obstacles to a fair trial;
difficulties that may arise from congested dockets; the possibility of the existence
of questions arising in the area of conflict of laws; the advantage of having a local
court determine questions of local law; and, all other considerations of a practical
nature that make a trial easy, expeditious and economical.
Chrysler Credit, 928 F.2d at 1516 (citation omitted). Here, Defendant is located in the Eastern
District of New York. Declaration of Sam Klinger. All evidence and sources of proof regarding
Defendant’s routing of this traffic is in the New York area. Declaration of Chris Zambito. The
witnesses that can testify as to Defendant’s routing of the traffic at issue are likewise located in
the New York area. Declaration of Sam Klinger, Chris Zambito, Ben Zelmanowitz. These
witnesses’ testimony will involve, inter alia, the reasons for the traffic at issue, the duration
defendant routing the traffic. Declaration of Ben Zelmanowitz. It would be extremely
inconvenient and expensive for critical witnesses to travel to Colorado in connection with this
litigation. Declaration of Sam Klinger, Chris Zambito, Ben Zelmanowitz

Further, there is no advantage in having the case heard in the District of Colorado as
opposed to the Eastern District of New York. Thus, the factor pertaining to the advantage of
having a local court determine questions of local law is neutral. Likewise, other factors,
including the enforceability of judgment and the relative advantage and obstacles to a fair trial
are neutral. Thus, in the alternative to dismissal, venue should be transferred to the Eastern
District of New York.
WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant respectfully requests that the
Court GRANT Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper
venue or, alternatively, transfer due to improper venue to the Eastern District of New York.
