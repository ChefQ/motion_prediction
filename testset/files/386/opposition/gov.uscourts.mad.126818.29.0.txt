DECLARATION OF DIANE MARCOU
IN SUPPORT OF
THE OPPOSITION OF PLAINTIFF RADIANSE, INC. TO TWIN CITY FIRE
INSURANCE COMPANY'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

I, Diane Marcou, declare as follows:

1, L was a defendant in AccountAbility Outsourcing, Inc. v. Marcou, et al., No. 08-
1379 (Mass. Super. Ct., Suffolk County), and involved in the proceedings of that case.

2. I was deposed twice in that case. I believe the first deposition was in April, 2008.
I know one other individual was also deposed in May, 2008.

3. I know we had to wait for months to get a final denial from Twin City.

4. Not knowing, for months, whether Twin City would cover our claim or not,
affected how the case was managed and the settlement proceedings. Had we known one way or
the other whether the claim was denied, we could have and, I think, we would have made

different decisions in handling the case.

 
Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 29 Filed 09/10/10 Page 2 of 3

5. The denial itself hurt Radianse but I also believe that the delay and indecision on

the part of Twin City hurt the company as well.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on

September 9, 2010
