UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
RADIANSE, INC.,
Plaintiff,
CIVIL ACTION NO. 10-10120-RGS

v.
TWIN CITY FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY,
Defendant.

TWIN CITY FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Twin City Fire Insurance Company (“Twin City”), by and through its
undersigned counsel and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, files this Motion for Summary Judgment
against Plaintiff Radianse, Inc. (“Radianse”).
In this case, Radianse asserts claims against Twin City arising out Twin City’s denial of
coverage with respect to a lawsuit filed against it captioned AccountAbility Outsourcing, Inc. v.
Marcou, et al., No. 08-1379 (Mass. Super. Ct., Suffolk County) (the “Underlying Action”). As
set forth in the supporting Memorandum of Law filed herewith, Twin City in fact had no duty to
defend or indemnify Radianse for the Underlying Action. The Policy excludes any claim “based
upon, arising from, or in any way related to any liability under any contract or agreement.” This
exclusion unambiguously applies to the Underlying Action. The claims against Radianse were
not only related to liability under a contract; they depended entirely on the existence of such
liability. Thus, Twin City’s denial of coverage was proper as a matter of law, and it has no duty
to reimburse Radianse for either defense costs or the settlement. Furthermore, since Twin City’s
denial of coverage was reasonable and correct, there can be no liability for bad faith.
