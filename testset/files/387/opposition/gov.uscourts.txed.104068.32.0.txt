PLAINTIFF'S OPPOSITION TO YAHOO'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND/OR STRIKE
PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS FOR WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT

This motion to dismiss is misplaced, unnecessary and premature. Defendant Yahoo, Inc.
("Yahoo") asks, based on a new Federal Circuit decision that issued after Function Media's First
Amended Complaint was filed - Jn re Seagate Technology, LLC --- F.3d ---, 2007 WL 2358677
(Fed. Cir. Aug. 20, 2007) - to dismiss allegations that Yahoo willfully infringed Function

Media's patents. But Jn re Seagate did not alter the pleading standards for willful infringement.
In its complaint, plaintiff Function Media, L.L.C. ("Function Media") alleged that Yahoo
directly and indirectly infringed three patents owned by Function Media. Yahoo does not contest
that Function Media's complaint states a cause of action for patent infringement on all three
patents sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss. Yahoo takes issue only with Function
Media's request for additional damages and additional remedies based on willful infringement.
However, willful infringement is not an independent claim. Rather, it is merely a method by
which to determine whether a defendant's intent in committing the act of infringement was
sufficiently "reckless" to entitle the plaintiff to "enhanced damages." Jd. at *2, *5. Function

Media has explicitly alleged that Yahoo infringed the patents, that the patents were valid, and

Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 2 of 14

that Yahoo acted deliberately when it infringed. Those allegations - similar to the short and
plain statements of willful infringement that are ordinary for patent cases filed in this district -
are more than sufficient to support an allegation that Yahoo infringed its valid patents, and that
the infringement was willful. Much like any standard allegation of intent or knowledge under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), willfulness need only be alleged "generally." See Fed. R.
Civ. Proc. 0x00A7 9(b) (`Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be
alleged generally.").

Whether or not Function Media's claims for willfulness can survive the evidentiary
standard propounded by Jn re Seagate is an issue that can and should be resolved at a later stage
in the proceedings on a factual record. It is not an issue for a motion to dismiss.

BACKGROUND

In its First Amended Complaint, Function Media asserts that Yahoo has been or will be
infringing three of its patents - U.S. Patents Nos. 6,446,045 (the `045 patent), 7,240,025 (the
`025 patent) and 7,249,059 (the `059 patent). The Yahoo products that infringe these patents
include products and services utilizing Yahoo's Publisher, Content Match, Sponsored Search,
SmartAds and Advertising technologies and other products and services related to internet and
print advertising. FAC 4 11, 18, 29.

The `045 patent issued in 2002. First Amended Complaint ("FAC") 9 7. Function Media
asserted that the infringement of the `045 patent was willful as of the time of filing. FAC 0x00A7 13.
Although not described in detail in Function Media's complaint (because there is no need to do
so in an initial pleading under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure), Function Media is aware of facts
that demonstrate Yahoo's willful infringement of the `045 patent. In particular, an attorney

retained by the `045 patent's inventors presented the `045 patent to Yahoo in 2002, clearly

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 3 of 14

demonstrating Yahoo's knowledge of the patent. Other facts supporting willful infringement,
such as Yahoo's awareness of the patent from other sources and its reckless conduct in
continuing to infringe that patent despite its knowledge, are fact issues properly reserved until
discovery and trial. There is no basis for resolving the issue of willful infringement on the `045
patent on a motion to dismiss.

The `025 and `059 patents were issued in 2007, on the day that Function Media filed its
initial complaint and first amended complaint, respectively. Because the issue date of these
patents was simultaneous with the filing of the complaints in this action, Function Media was
careful to allege that Yahoo's infringement of those two patents "will be willful and deliberate."
FAC 4 20, 31. The facts concerning Yahoo's willful infringement of these patents have not yet
been developed through discovery. For example, discovery has not yet revealed whether or not
Yahoo was aware of the published patent applications for the `025 and `059 patents before this
lawsuit was filed. Given Yahoo's knowledge of the `045 patent, however, this is certainly a
reasonable inference.

ARGUMENT

A. Neither In re Seagate nor Twombley has altered the pleading standard

for alleging willful infringement

Yahoo's argument comes down to one point: combining the Federal Circuit's decision in
In re Seagate and the Supreme Court's decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombley, 197 S.Ct.
1955 (May 21, 2007), Function Media is required to plead more than the traditional patent
litigation averments of willful infringement in order to survive a motion to dismiss under Federal

Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Yahoo is wrong. Jn re Seagate does not so much as discuss

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 4 of 14

the pleading standards for willful infringement, and Twombiey requires no more than what
Function Media has already alleged.
1. In re Seagate did not alter the long-standing rule that willfulness may be
alleged generally

In re Seagate explained that the standard for a showing of "willfulness" on the merits is
an evidentiary showing that the defendant acted with "recklessness." Jd at *5. But Jn re
Seagate did not suggest that the requisite "recklessness" need be pled with particularity; nor is
there any other case law that upsets the long-standing rule: willfulness can and should be pled
generally.

Instead, In re Seagate described a two-step process for presenting record evidence
supporting a showing of willful infringement. To support an ultimate finding of willfulness, the
plaintiff must first show "that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its
actions constituted infringement of a valid patent." /d at *5. Then "the patentee must also
demonstrate that this objectively-defined risk (determined _by the record developed _in_ the
infringement proceeding) was either known or so obvious that it should have been known to the
accused infringer." Jd. (emphasis added).

Nothing in Jn re Seagate suggests that a patentee must, at the pleading stage, allege all of
the facts that support the allegation of willful infringement. And the long-standing rule has been
that willful infringement - just like other mental states of recklessness or negligence - may be
alleged generally. In fact, the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have consistently - and
recently - approved and relied upon forms included by the Judicial Conference with the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, which make clear that willfulness may be alleged generally.

Twombley, 127 8. Ct. at 1970 n.9; McZeal v. Sprint Nextel Corp., No. 2006-1548, 2007 U.S. App.

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 5of 14

LEXIS 22025 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 14 2007) at *6 (approving forms). Form 10 demonstrates the level
of specificity required, at the pleading stage, where the "evidence may justify a finding of
willfulness or recklessness or of negligence":

defendant .. . willfully or recklessly or negligently drove or caused to be driven a

motor vehicle....
Fed. R. Civ. Proc. app. Form 10. That is it. In other words, willfulness-and recklessness, for
that matter-may be generally averred at the pleading stage.

Moreover, Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifically provides that
"conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally." Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 0x00A7 9(b). Applying
that standard, courts have long held that, when an underlying offense is properly pled, simple
allegations of the defendant's mental state are sufficient to meet the standards for pleading that
mental state. For example, in Belli v. Orlando Daily Newspapers, Inc., 389 F.2d 579, 589 (5th
Cir. 1967), the Fifth Circuit held that, when a plaintiff had adequately pled defamation, a simple |
pleading that a defendant acted with malice was sufficient to allege that a defendant acted with
actual malice. See also 5 Charles Allen Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure 0x00A7 1301 (3d. Ed. 2007) ("When the malice of a person is in issue, a general averment
will suffice, even when it is an element of the plaintiff's cause of action or of his claim for
punitive damages."); Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1270 & fn. 5 (10th Cir.
1989) ("Many courts and commentators have interpreted Rule 9(b) to permit a general averment
of intent unaccompanied by supporting factual allegations. General allegations of a defendant's
intent have been held sufficient to support claims for punitive damages under the federal
pleading standards."); Clark v. Allstate Ins. Co., 106 F. Supp. 2d 1016, 1019 (C.D. Cal. 2000)

("In federal court, a plaintiff may include a short and plain prayer for punitive damages that

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 6 of 14

relies entirely on unsupported and conclusory averments of malice or fraudulent intent."). That
same standard has been applied to averments of willful infringement in patent suits. See Multi-
Tech. Sys., Inc. v. Dialpad.com, No. 00-CV-1540, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23575, at *6-*7 (D. Minn.
Aug. 28, 2001) (holding that "mere allegations of willful infringement" are sufficient under Rule

8(a))
2. Twombley did not alter the long-standing pleading rule for willfulness

may be alleged generally

Nor does Twombley affect this result. Nothing in Twombley so much as suggests that the
Supreme Court intended to alter the ordinary standards for pleading willfulness reflected in the
forms, the case law, and in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). In Twombley, the Supreme
Court went out of its way to emphasize that it was not changing the settled law of pleading a
complaint. Instead, the Court held only that, under the notice pleading standard of Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 8, a plaintiff must give "fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests." Jd. The Supreme Court addressed whether a class action brought under 0x00A7 1 of
the Sherman Act "can survive a motion to dismiss . . . absent some factual context suggesting
agreement" in violation of 0x00A7 1. 127 S. Ct. at 1961. Applying the "general standards" established by
many of the rules and cases cited above, the Court-affirming the trial court's application of settled
law-held that a complaint predicated upon an alleged antitrust violation should be dismissed in the
absence of any factual context plausibly suggesting an antitrust violation. Jd. at 1964-66, 1973. The
Court explicitly rejected the idea that it was applying "any `heightened' pleading standard" in
reaching its decision. Jd. at 1973 n.14. And in an apparent effort to minimize the risk that its holding
would be misunderstood, or taken out of context, the Court explained that it was particularly
concerned about "the unusually high cost of discovery in antitrust cases," and desired to "avoid the

potentially enormous expense of discovery in cases with no reasonably founded hope that the

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 7 of 14

discovery process will reveal relevant evidence to support a 0x00A7 | claim." Jd. at 1967 (internal
quotations and citations omitted).

If any legitimate doubt remained as to the Court's own view of the significance of Twombley,
it was dispelled two weeks later, when the Court issued its decision in Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct.
2197 (2007). For in Erickson, a per curiam Court cited Bell Atlantic as standing for the decades-old
proposition that the "liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2)" require only "a short and
plain statement" giving "the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon
which it rests." Erickson, 127 S, Ct. at 2200 (citation omitted).

A recent decision of the Federal Circuit-applying Fifth Circuit procedural law-further
confirms that Twombley cannot be read to have upset the long-settled approach to notice pleading
under Rule 8. In MeZeal v. Sprint Nextel Corp., No. 2006-1548, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 22025, at *6
n.4 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 14, 2007), the Federal Circuit considered, and firmly rejected, the possibility
"that [Twombley] changed the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8." After
Twombley, therefore---just as before-`a patentee need only plead facts sufficient to place the

alleged infringer on notice as to what he must defend." McZeal, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 22025, at *7.

Any complaint that "contains enough detail to allow the defendants to answer .. . thus meets the
notice pleading required to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. . . . Nothing more is required." Jd. at *8-
*9,

As described above, the forms included with the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, and that
were specifically approved in both Twombley and McZeal make clear that willfulness need only be
alleged generally. Nor has the Supreme Court or the Federal Circuit given any indication whatsoever
of a desire to alter the longstanding pleading rules governing willfulness and other mental states.
Thus, Yahoo's argument that Twombley altered settled law to require a heightened pleading standard

for willfulness is entirely misplaced.

B. Function Media has properly alleged willful infringement of the
patents in suit

Here, Function Media has plainly alleged (a) that Yahoo's products infringed or will
infringe (b) valid patents, and (c) that Yahoo's infringement was deliberate. These factual
allegations - which are similar to those that have been made in complaints in patent cases in this
district for years - more than suffice to support a reasonable inference that Yahoo's infringement
of the patents in suit was willful under the standards of In re Seagate. If Yahoo knowingly
infringed a valid patent, Yahoo "acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions
constituted infringement of a valid patent." Jn re Seagate, 2007 WL 2358677 at *5. Moreover,
Function Media has specifically alleged that Yahoo's infringement was "deliberate," which more
than suffices to support a claim that the risk of being cited for infringement was known to the
accused infringer. Jn re Seagate, 2007 WL 2358677 at *5. Thus, Function Media has provided a
short and plain statement of the facts that would permit a finding of willful infringement of its
patent under Jn re Seagate.

1. The `045 patent

There can be no doubt Function Media has properly alleged that Yahoo willfully
infringed the `045 patent. Because this patent was publicly issued years before the filing of this
lawsuit, and because the existence of the patent was a matter of public record, Function Media
has plainly pled facts sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that Yahoo's infringement
of the `045 patent was willful. The existence of the valid `045 patent, combined with Yahoo's
infringement of that patent and its knowledge of the `045 patent, is more than sufficient to state a

factual basis for Yahoo's infringement of the `045 patent.

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 Filed 10/10/2007 Page 9 of 14

In its motion, Yahoo states that it is "not aware of any pre-litigation notice of the patents
in suit." Motion to Dismiss at 2. That, of course, is an evidentiary issue that can only be decided
on a factual record. When that factual record is developed, Function Media will be able to show,
among other things, that the `045 patent was presented to Yahoo in late 2002 by an attorney
acting on behalf of the patent's inventors. That presentation of the `045 patent to Yahoo would
have provided it with notice of the patent well in advance of the lawsuit.

2. The `025 and `059 patents

The `025 and `059 patents were issued on the days that Function Media filed its initial
and first amended complaints, respectively. For that reason, Function Media carefully alleged
that Yahoo's continuing infringement of these patents "will be" willful and deliberate. Taking
the allegations of the complaint as true, there is more than sufficient basis for these allegations.
Namely, the patents are valid, Yahoo's products have infringed and have continued to infringe
the patents, and Yahoo has been placed on notice of the patents. See FAC {ff 14, 18, 19, 20 25,
29, 30, 31.

Defendants point out that /n re Seagate noted that allegations of willfulness in an initial
complaint are generally based upon pre-filing conduct, and that enhanced damages for
willfulness are not "ordinarily" available for post-filing conduct, unless the plaintiff moves for a
preliminary injunction. But Seagate does not hold that willful infringement based on post-filing
conduct could not be alleged or proven. To the contrary, the Federal Circuit emphasized that
"when an accused infringer's post-filing conduct is reckless" there may be a showing of "post-
filing willful infringement." Jn re Seagate, 2007 WL 2358677 at * 8. The Federal Circuit did
suggest that willful infringement damages would not ordinarily be recoverable by a patentee who

does not seek a preliminary injunction, but even there concluded only that a preliminary

764131v1/010020
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 32 _ Filed 10/10/2007 Page 10 of 14

injunction only "generally provides" an adequate remedy for post-filing willful infringement. Jd.
In re Seagate does not suggest that it is improper to allege post-filing willful infringement where
there is evidence that such willful infringement exists.

Here, there are live issues about the scope of Yahoo's infringement that can only be
resolved on a factual record as to whether Yahoo's infringement of the `025 and `059 patents is
willful, and whether Function Media is entitled to any willfulness damages. For example, Yahoo
may have had notice of the published applications for these patents prior to the filing of the
lawsuit. Yahoo may even have performed a pre-lawsuit investigation of the application history
of the patents in suit. All of this is indeed likely, given Yahoo's knowledge of the `045 patent.

In short, there is no conceivable prejudice to Yahoo from allowing these claims of
willfulness to go forward and be decided on the basis of an evidentiary record. Yahoo is surely
aware now of the existence of these patents; the only question is whether there is evidence that
could support a claim of willful infringement of the patents. The additional discovery that will
be required to resolve this issue will be minimal and not burdensome. Moreover, by the time
that this matter is ready for dispositive motions, post-Seagate law will certainly be better
developed, meaning that the parties can better determine then whether willfulness allegations on
this factual record can be advanced on patents that issued on the date that lawsuit claims were
filed.

C. If the Court Construes Yahoo's Motion as a Motion to Strike or a

Motion for More Definite Statement, It Should Also Be Denied

Yahoo also asks the Court to construe its motion as a motion to strike or a motion for

more definite statement. But Yahoo cannot conceivably prevail on either a motion to strike or a

motion for more definite statement.
