YAHOO!, INC.'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND STRIKE
FUNCTION MEDIA'S WILLFULNESS CLAIMS, OR IN THE
ALTERNATIVE FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT

Defendant Yahoo!, Inc. ("Yahoo!") moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(6), to dismiss Plaintiff Function Media LLC's ("Function Media's") claims of
willful infringement set forth in conclusory fashion in its Amended Complaint. Yahoo! also
requests that the Court strike pursuant to Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the
portion of section c of Function Media's Prayer for Relief that relates to "enhanced damages",
because this section seeks relief for which Function Media has failed to state a claim. In the
alternative, Yahoo! moves the Court pursuant to Rule 12(e) to require Function Media to provide

a more definite statement of its willfulness claims.

I. Introduction

Without stating any relevant facts, Function Media's Amended Complaint asserts
that Yahoo!'s alleged infringement of three patents is willful. Indeed, Function Media's
willfulness claims consist entirely of three conclusory statements:

e "Upon information and belief, Yahoo!'s infringement of [U.S. Patent No.

7,240,025] will be willful and deliberate."

Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 20 Filed 09/24/2007 Page2of7

e "Upon information and belief, Yahoo!'s infringement of [U.S. Patent No.
7,249,059] will be willful and deliberate."
e "Upon information and belief; Yahoo's infringement of [U.S. Patent No.
6,466,045] is willful and deliberate."

Amended Complaint 0x00A7f] 13, 20, 31 (emphasis supplied). Function Media makes these claims
without pleading any pre-suit notice and despite the fact that Yahoo! is not aware of any pre-
litigation notice of the patents-in-suit. Indeed, the `025 patent issued the same day that it was
first asserted in the original Complaint, and the `059 patent issued the day before it was first
asserted in the Amended Complaint. Thus, Function Media's willfulness claims appear to be

premised purely on post-complaint-filing conduct.
This pleading is insufficient to state a claim for willfulness for myriad reasons.
Function Media's willfulness claims purport to predict future conduct, and thus set forth a
merely speculative basis for relief that is in direct contravention to both the Supreme Court's
decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 8.Ct. 1955 (2007) and the en banc Federal
Circuit's recent decision in /m re Seagate, = F.3d, 2007 WL 2358677 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 20,
2007).' Compounding their insufficiency, the willfulness claims consist entirely of the very
same "labels and conclusions" that Bell Atlantic held insufficient under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 8. Finally, even if acceptable under Rule 8, Function Media's claims allege conduct
that Jn re Seagate holds to be inappropriate for an initial pleading of willfulness. For these
reasons, the Court should dismiss Function Media's willfulness claims, or in the alternative order

Function Media to provide a more definite statement that satisfies the legal standards.

II. Function Media Is Required To Plead Facts Suggesting that Yahoo! Was
Objectively Reckless After Receiving Notice Of The Patents and Before the
Complaint Was Filed.

In Bell Atlantic, the Supreme Court held that a complaint must contain a factual

basis for relief. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly at 1965; see also FED. R. CIv. P. 8(a). "Factual

 

tA copy of Ja re Seagate is attached as Exhibit A to this motion.
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 20 Filed 09/24/2007 Page3of7

allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level," and thus the
plaintiff has an "obligation" to provide "more than labels and conclusions" as to the grounds for
seeking relief. /d. at 1965. As a result, "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of
action will not do." /d Instead, the plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to "raise a reasonable
expectation that discovery will reveal evidence" supporting the claim. /d. at 1965. In other
words, "enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest" that the relevant legal standard can be
met. Id.

Function Media's burden to plead willfulness-related facts is further informed by
the Federal Circuit's recent en banc decision in In re Seagate, in which it established a
heightened standard for proving willfulness. Jn re Seagate, 2007 WL 2358677. In this landmark
case, the Court unanimously overturned existing law, abolishing the "affirmative duty of due
care" previously imposed on those with mere notice of a patent. /d at *5. Consequently, no
longer can a patentee rely merely on notice of the patents to allege willful infringement and shift
the focus to the accused infringer's conduct. Instead, the Court found that a finding of
willfulness "requires at least a showing of objective recklessness," which means that "a patentee
must show by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high
likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent." /d@ Moreover, once this
objective standard is satisfied, "the patentee must also demonstrate that this objectively-defined
risk (determined by the record developed in the infringement proceeding) was either known or so
obvious that it should have been known to the accused infringer." Jd.

Applying Bell Atlantic in light of In re Seagate, the willfulness pleading standard
becomes clear: to state a claim of willfulness in this case, Function Media is required to plead
facts suggesting that Yahoo! acted despite an objectively high likelihood that it infringed valid
patents held by Function Media, and that Yahoo! knew or should have known of this risk. But /7
re Seagate goes even further, firmly laying to rest the notion that willfulness allegations in the
complaint can be premised on conduct that has yet to occur: because "a patentee must have a

good faith basis for alleging willful infringement ... a willfulness claim in the original complaint
Case 2:07-cv-00279-TJW Document 20 Filed 09/24/2007 Page4of7

must be grounded exclusively in the accused infringer's pre-filing conduct." /d. at *8 (emphasis
supplied). As discussed below, Function Media's willfulness claims fall short of the Bell
Atlantic and Seagate standards because they contain no factual basis and appear to be premised

purely on post-complaint-filing conduct.

I. Function Media's Willfulness Pleadings Do Not State A Proper Claim Because They
Are Premised On Future Conduct

In its Amended Complaint, Function Media asserts that Yahoo! willfully infringes
three patents: U.S. Patent No. 6,466,045 ("the "045 patent'), U.S. Patent No. 7,240,025 ("the
`025 patent"), and U.S. Patent No. 7,249,059 ("the "059 patent").

Function Media's willfulness claims are impermissibly premised on future
conduct. The Amended Complaint explicitly acknowledges this with respect to the `025 and
`059 patents, asserting that Yahoo!'s actions "will be willful and deliberate" infringement.
Amended Complaint, {] 20,31. It hedges with good reason: the `025 patent issued on the day
it was first asserted in the initial Complaint, and the "0359 patent issued the day before it was first
asserted in the Amended Complaint. See Docket Entry 12, Exhs. B and D. Therefore, Yahoo!
simply cannot have had the meaningful notice of these patents that is necessary, but not
sufficient, to give rise to a willfulness claim. Jn re Seagate, 2007 WL 2358677, at *5. Function
Media's remaining willfulness claim also appears to be based on future conduct. Despite the fact
that the `045 patent issued well before the complaint was filed, Yahoo! is not aware of any
alleged notice of the 045 patent provided by Function Media prior to filing the complaint.

Consequently, Function Media's willfulness claims should be dismissed, because
"a willfulness claim in the original complaint must be grounded exclusively in the accused

infringer's pre-filing conduct." Ja re Seagate, 2007 WL 2358677 at *8 (emphasis supplied).

 

* In its initial Complaint, Function Media asserted that Yahoo! willfully infringes the `045 and
`025 patents. The `059 patent was first asserted in the Amended Complaint.

IV. Function Media's Willfulness Pleadings Do Not Satisfy Rule 8 Because They
Contain No Facts At AIL

Function Media's claims should also be dismissed because they are stated in
conclusory fashion and contain no facts that could support the requested relief. Function
Media's claim for willfulness concerning the `045 patent consists entirely of the bald assertion
that "[u]pon information and belief, Yahoo!'s infringement of the `045 patent is willful and
deliberate." Amended Complaint 431. Its willfulness claims concerning the `025 and `059
patents are similarly devoid of facts. In sum, the Amended Complaint states no alleged facts
supporting these claims and gives no indication why Function Media believes these claims to be
justified. Indeed, Function Media's willfulness claims do not even rise to the level of the
"formulaic recitation of the elements" that the Supreme Court rejected as insufficient in Bell
Atlantic, let alone provide a "reasonable expectation" that discovery will reveal facts supporting
the /n re Seagate standard for willfulness. Bell Atlantic, 127 8. Ct. at 1965.

These conclusory willfulness claims cannot stand in light of Bell Atlantic and Jn
re Seagate, and should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In the
alternative, the Court should order Function Media to provide a more definite statement of its
willfulness claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e).

V. Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss Function Media's willfulness

claims and strike the requested relief that arises from them, or order Function Media to provide a

more definite statement of its willfulness claims.
