DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CONDITIONAL
CERTIFICATION OF AN FLSA COLLECTIVE ACTION AND FOR
IDENTIFICATION AND NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL CLASS MEMBERS
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs’ motion is based on a restatement of the allegations in their bare-bones
complaint and a threadbare Declaration from Mr. Fuentes which is contradicted by the very
documentary evidence that is attached to it. Plaintiffs’ unsupported conclusions and meager
evidentiary support fall far short of meeting the minimal burden established by the Fourth Circuit
for conditional certification of a collective action under the FLSA. Consequently, Plaintiffs’
Motion for Conditional Certification must be denied.
Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ request for information regarding potential class members is
overbroad and without support, and the proposed Notice attached to Plaintiffs’ motion lacks
material information.

LEGAL STANDARD
An employee may maintain a collective action against his or her employer for violations
of the FLSA pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). The FLSA provides, in relevant part:
An action . . . may be maintained against any employer . . . in any Federal or State
court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and on behalf
of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated. No employee
shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing
to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action
is brought.
29 U.S.C. § 216(b). The provision “‘establishes an ‘opt-in’ scheme whereby potential plaintiffs
must affirmatively notify the court of their intentions to be a party to the suit.’” Butler v.
Directsat USA, LLC, 876 F. Supp. 2d 560, 565 (D. Md. 2012) (quoting Quinteros v. Sparkle
Cleaning, Inc., 532 F. Supp. 2d 762, 771 (D. Md. 2008) (citing Camper v. Home Quality Mgmt.,
Inc., 200 F.R.D. 516, 519 (D. Md. 2000))).

Here, Plaintiffs have moved for conditional

certification of a collective action on behalf of themselves and other alleged employees of TEG
who performed “similar duties.” See Pls.’ Mot. 1, E.C.F. No. 20.
Courts in the Fourth Circuit follow a two-step process in “deciding whether to certify a
collective action pursuant to the FLSA.” Butler, 876 F. Supp. 2d at 566 (citing Syrja v. Westat,
Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d 682, 686 (D. Md. 2010)); see also Calder v. GGC-Baltimore, LLC, No.
BPG-12-2350, 2013 WL 3441178, at *1 (D. Md. Jul. 8, 2013) (citations omitted). Relevant here,
at the first stage of the process, the “notice stage,” the “court makes a ‘threshold determination of
whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that potential class members are similarly situated’ such
that court-facilitated notice to putative class members would be appropriate.’” Butler, 876 F.
Supp. 2d at 566 (quoting Syrja, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 686 (quotations omitted)). This determination
of appropriateness is “‘left to the court’s discretion.’” Id. (quoting Syrja, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 686

A “group of potential FLSA plaintiffs is similarly situated if its members can demonstrate

4735344, at *3 (D. Md. Oct. 14, 2008)). Although the Fourth Circuit has not yet articulated a
specific test for conditional certification, district courts have made clear that while a plaintiff
“need only make a modest factual showing sufficient to demonstrate that they and potential
plaintiffs together were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the law,” a plaintiff
may not “merely stand on the allegations of their complaint.” Faust, 2011 WL 5244421, at *2
(citing Marroquin v. Canales, 236 F.R.D. 257, 259 (D. Md. 2006)); see also Williams v. Long,

“factual evidence by affidavits or other means, but mere allegations in the complaint would not
suffice”) (quotations omitted) (emphasis omitted). A plaintiff’s burden, while not onerous, is
also “not invisible,” and a plaintiff “‘must submit evidence establishing at least a colorable basis
for their claim that a class of similarly situated plaintiffs exist.’” Faust, 2011 WL 5244421, at *2
(quoting Severtson v. Phillips Beverage Co., 137 F.R.D. 264, 266 (D. Minn. 1991)). This
requires more than mere “vague allegations with meager factual support.” Butler, 876 F. Supp.
2d at 567.

ARGUMENT
A.

Plaintiffs’ Motion Must Be Denied Because They Have Failed To Meet Their
Burden of Showing That The Group of Potential Plaintiffs Were Victims of A
Common Policy, Scheme, or Plan That Violated The Law

Plaintiffs have failed to provide a colorable basis for their claim that other similarly
situated plaintiffs exist as is required under the FLSA. First, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional
Certification essentially parrots the allegations in their Complaint. Second, Plaintiffs’ only
Declaration in support of their Motion contains a single unsupported conclusion that The
Environmental Group (“TEG”) has a company policy not to pay employees overtime. Third, the
handful of Mr. Fuentes’ paystubs, which Plaintiffs attached to Mr. Fuentes’ Declaration, actually
indicate that Mr. Fuentes was paid for overtime hours at various times during the course of his
employment, thereby contradicting his very assertion that TEG has a company policy not to pay
overtime. This meager and contradictory factual support falls far short of demonstrating that
Plaintiffs and others “similarly situated” were “victims of a common policy or plan.” See Faust,
2011 WL 5244421, at *2. As such, Plaintiff’s Motion for Conditional Certification of an FLSA
Collective Action and for Identification and Notification of Potential Class Members must be
denied.
i. Plaintiffs Must Do More than Parrot the Allegations Set Forth in their
Complaint
Plaintiffs begin their argument for conditional certification by rewording the allegations
contained within their Complaint. Their Motion reiterates that “[d]uring at least the entire time
that Plaintiffs were employed by Defendants, other persons employed by Defendants to perform
similar work . . . were not paid at a time and a half rate despite having worked more than forty
hours in a week.” Compare Mem. in Supp. 7, E.C.F. No. 20-1 to Compl. ¶ 10, E.C.F. No. 1.
Plaintiffs claim that “this language is sufficient to permit the Court to make the required factual
4

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 5 of 16

determination that there are ‘substantial allegations’ that [members of] the proposed class” were
victims of a common policy or plan.” Mem. in Supp. 7. It is not, and Plaintiffs fail to meet the
clear standard that courts in this District apply, which requires that Plaintiffs do more than
“merely stand on the allegations of their complaint.” Faust, 2011 WL 5244421, at *2 (citing
Marroquin, 236 F.R.D. at 259).
ii. Mr. Fuentes’ Declaration and Accompanying Pay Stubs Do Not Identify A
Common Policy, Scheme, or Plan that Violated the Law
The limited factual evidence offered by Plaintiffs to demonstrate that Plaintiffs and others
were together victims of a common policy, scheme or plan which violates the FLSA consists of
(1) the Declaration of Mr. Fuentes and (2) several of Mr. Fuentes’ paystubs. Specifically, Mr.
Fuentes states in his Declaration that he heard Mr. Hennessy and Mr. Herold state that “it was
company policy not to pay overtime” and that it was his “understanding . . . that in most cases
TEG did not pay overtime to its hourly employees when they worked more than forty hours in a
work week.” Fuentes Decl. ¶ 8–9, E.C.F. No. 20-2. This evidence offered by Plaintiffs is
unavailing and indeed, Mr. Fuentes’ own Declaration contradicts itself. In one breath, he states
that it was “company policy” not to pay overtime to employees, and in the next, he says he
“usually was not paid” overtime, which belies his allegation that TEG’s policy was not to pay
overtime. Id. ¶ 6, 8.
Plaintiffs also characterize Mr. Fuentes’ paystubs as “documentary evidence” that
Defendants’ failure to pay Mr. Fuentes overtime was “a company policy.” Mem. in Supp. 8. In
fact, the pay stubs undermine Mr. Fuentes’ allegations of a company-wide policy against paying
overtime because the very paystubs that Plaintiffs offer as “documentary evidence” of the
unlawful company policy indicate that he was paid overtime wages at various times during his
employment. See id. The Fuentes Declaration does not provide factual support in favor of
5

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 6 of 16

conditional certification—it actually undermines Plaintiffs’ assertion that members of the
proposed class of plaintiffs were victims of an illegal common policy or scheme. Furthermore,
nowhere in his declaration does Mr. Fuentes reveal the source of his “understanding…that in
most cases TEG did not pay overtime.” This type of conclusory allegation, without a scintilla of
factual support, is insufficient.
Put simply, Plaintiffs’ parroting of their Complaint and their contradictory declaration
amount to no more than mere “vague allegations” with “meager factual support” regarding a
common policy violative of the FLSA. Thus, conditional certification is not warranted.
Other Courts faced with similarly meager factual showings have denied conditional
certification. For example, in D’Anna v. M/A-Com, Inc., a field sales engineer brought suit under
the ADEA against his employer and sought to proceed with the case as a collective action. 903
F. Supp. 889, 894 (D. Md. 1995). The court applied the test for conditional certification required
under the FLSA and concluded that although the evidentiary requirements were “not stringent,”
the plaintiff nonetheless failed to make the “relatively modest factual showing” which points to a
“company plan or policy to target older employees for termination.” Id. at 894. The plaintiff in
D’Anna claimed that he was terminated “on the basis of age and that his job duties were given to
a younger person.” Id. He identified eleven other employees over the age of 40 were terminated
and claimed that those terminations were motivated by and proof of the defendant employer’s
intent to discriminate.

Id. The court disagreed, finding the plaintiff’s “broad and vague”

allegations of class-wide discrimination insufficient for conditional certification.
In White v. Rick Bus Co., the District of New Jersey determined that conditional
certification of an FLSA action was not warranted where the plaintiff “provided mere
generalizations and legal conclusions” in his Second Amended Complaint and “the same sort of

6

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 7 of 16

blanket assertions without factual matter” in his supporting Certification. 743 F. Supp. 2d 380,
388 (D.N.J. 2010) (applying a standard of review similar to the standard used in the District of
Maryland). There, like in the present matter, the plaintiff failed to “put forth any relevant facts
for the Court to consider, such as the names of any similarly situated employees,” the years those
employees worked, their job descriptions, or other “basic facts [which] are readily ascertainable
at the pleading stage before discovery.” Id. Additionally, the court rejected the plaintiff’s
Certification, which stated that the plaintiff knew of other individuals who were similarly
situated “based upon [his] conversations with them and in many instances, the comparison of
[their] weekly pay checks.” Id. The court dismissed these allegations as unsupported hearsay
and further characterized the Certification as “deficient in content.” Id. at 388–89. Here,
Plaintiffs offer much less than what the court in White deemed an insufficient factual showing.
In another illustrative case, Flores v. Lifeway Foods, Inc., the Northern District of Illinois
declined to authorize notice to putative FLSA collective action plaintiffs due to the plaintiffs’
failure to “make even a modest factual showing” that would warrant the authorization. 289 F.
Supp. 2d 1042, 1047 (N.D. Ill. 2003). There, the plaintiffs alleged that their employer failed to
pay overtime wages, refused to pay employees’ for all clocked hours and unlawfully rounded
hours worked down to a more “advantageous” hour increment to the employer. Id. at 1043. The
plaintiffs further provided affidavits of two plaintiffs, which stated that they and other employees
routinely worked 50 to 60 hours each week, yet were only paid for eight hours each day. Id. at
1046. Notably, the plaintiffs in Flores offered more factual support than is present here and still,
the court readily determined that the evidence put forth by the plaintiffs was not the type of
“factual showing that would establish a colorable common policy or plan.” Id.

7

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 8 of 16

Courts that have approved conditional certification have done so in cases with far greater
factual support than is present here. For example, Plaintiffs attach an Order from a case in which
the District Court for the District of Columbia granted conditional certification of a collective
action brought by plaintiffs who were represented by Plaintiffs’ counsel in this case. See Ayala
Order, ECF No. 20-4.

Notably, however, in that case, plaintiffs presented more factual

specificity than has been provided here, and submitted six declarations in support, of their
motion which the Court noted “aver these same facts.” Ayala v. Tito Contractors, No. 131603(JEB), 2014 WL 464786, at *2–3 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 2014). The six declarations specified the
job responsibilities of the employees, their project locations, hours worked, and reiterated that
they were not paid overtime and were instructed to underreport hours. See id. In contrast to the
satisfactory factual specificity offered by plaintiffs in Ayala, Mr. Fuentes’ Declaration concludes
that there is a company policy not to pay overtime, includes pay stubs that show he was paid
overtime, and ambiguously references “other TEG hourly employees and statements by TEG
managers.” Fuentes Decl. ¶ 9. Despite having done so in the past, Plaintiffs’ counsel has, for
unknown reasons, failed to provide the requisite level of factual support here.
Other courts that have granted motions for conditional certification have likewise relied
on significantly more factual support than Plaintiffs have provided here. See, e.g., Margulies v.
Tri-Cnty. Metro. Transp. Dist. of Oregon, No. 3:13-cv-00475-PK, 2013 WL 5593040 (D. Or.
Oct. 10, 2013) (finding conditional certification appropriate where the plaintiff “identified five
categories of unpaid time” and submitted the declarations of ten bus operators and one train
operator corroborating the claims); Larson v. Rush Fitness Corp., No. 3:12-cv-109, 2013 WL
5350640, at *4–5 (E.D. Tenn. Sept. 23, 2013) (stating that the plaintiff “met his burden of
making a modest factual showing that he is similarly situated to other employees” where he

8

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 9 of 16

presented affidavits from “three current and former employees who worked as membership
managers” as well as supplemental affidavits from each); Butler, 876 F. Supp. 2d at 568 (holding
that the plaintiffs made a “modest factual showing” where they presented: (1) an affidavit of a
manager of the defendant employer articulating company directives regarding recording time
worked and acknowledging that employees performed numerous tasks without pay; (2)
declarations of each of the named plaintiffs attesting to, in abundant detail, the practices
described by the manager; and (3) deposition testimony corroborating the information in the
declarations); Faust, 2011 WL 5244421, at *3–4 (finding that the plaintiffs satisfied their modest
burden where they submitted three declarations, one from each plaintiff and one from an opt-in
plaintiff, copies of the plaintiffs’ time records, emails sent from the defendant employer
regarding time keeping and documents outlining the employer’s time keeping policies). 1
B.

Plaintiffs Are Not Entitled to Disclosure of the Telephone Numbers of
Potential Class Members

Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they need the telephone number of potential
class members. Thus, in the interest of maintaining the privacy of those individuals and to avoid

certification where the plaintiff submitted two declarations that included the names of eight other similarly
situated employees and articulated an abundance of factual detail); Harvey v. AB Electrolux, 857 F. supp. 815, 817

(granting conditional certification where plaintiffs set forth specific factual evidence of a common scheme and
submitted sixteen affidavits of former employees); Marroquin, 236 F.R.D. at 260 (certifying collective action
where the plaintiffs submitted at least nine detailed affidavits consistently describing tales of FLSA violations);

conditional certification based upon one affidavit and allegations of more than 60 named plaintiffs).

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 10 of 16

the possibility of undue influence, TEG should not be required to disclose the telephone numbers
of their current and former employees.
In support of their request for the telephone numbers, Plaintiffs submitted the declaration
of Keria McNett. See McNett Decl., E.C.F. No. 20-3. In it, Ms. McNett states, in conclusory
fashion, that Plaintiffs should be allowed to contact potential class members by telephone
because “in her experience, the U.S. Mail…is not the most reliable means of communication
with “low wage workers…whose principal language is Spanish.” Id. at 3.
Ms. McNett offers no support for her classification of TEG’s current and former
employees as “low income” other than the fact that they are Hispanic. TEG Field Staff, like
Plaintiffs and those whom they are seeking to add to their collective action, are Licensed
Asbestos Supervisors and Workers. The wage rate for these types of TEG employees is from
$15 to $25 per hour. See Hennessy Decl. ¶4, Ex. A.

Certified payroll hourly rates are even

higher. Id. Thus, these individuals are not low-income immigrant workers as Ms. McNett
assumes in her declaration.
The only evidence submitted by Plaintiffs that in any way touches on the level of income
of potential class members, Boris Fuentes’ own Declaration, undermines Ms. McNett’s
conclusion. The pay stubs that are attached as an exhibit demonstrate that for the last two years
of Mr. Fuentes’ employment with TEG, he was being paid $20.50 per hour. In fact, in 2012,
their final full year of employment with TEG, Mr. Fuentes and Ms. Mejia, who are married,
earned more than $95,000 combined. See Hennessy Decl. ¶5. Similarly, they were on pace to
earn more than $95,000, in 2013 having earned more than $32,000 during the first four months
of that year. Id.

10

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 11 of 16

Further, Ms. McNett fails to explain her basis for concluding that TEG’s current or
former employees, the potential class, are experiencing “housing insecurity” or that they will not
receive mail.

TEG’s actual experience in using the U.S. mail to communicate with its

employees has been contrary to Ms. McNett’s speculations. TEG regularly sends its employees
W-2 forms, health insurance notices, holiday notices, pay stubs and other business
communication by U.S. Mail and they are rarely returned undelivered nor do TEG’s employees
complain that they did not receive them. See Hennessy Decl. ¶8. Thus, there is no basis upon
which the Court should assume that U.S. mail would not be an adequate method of giving notice
to potential class members.
In fact, this Court, like other courts in Maryland and around the country, should be wary
of requiring a defendant like TEG to disclose telephone numbers and allowing Plaintiffs to
contact potential class members by telephone because of concerns of violation of privacy and
undue influence. In Arevalo v. D.J.’s Underground, Inc., No. DLC-09-3199, 2010 WL 4026112
(D. Md. Oct. 13, 2010) the court refused to require disclosure of the telephone numbers of
potential class members who were Hispanic. This was the case despite plaintiffs’ argument that
they had had tried to contact potential class members by mail but had received a limited
response. Id. at *2. The court stated that plaintiffs’ arguments did not “justify the risk inherent in
permitting Plaintiffs to contact the putative class members by phone.” Id.

The court also

expressed concern with “direct contact between Plaintiffs’ counsel and the collective class
members and…the privacy interests that the putative plaintiffs might have.” Id. at *3. Here,
Plaintiffs should be required to attempt to contact potential class members by mail before TEG is
required to disclose telephone numbers. See also Andrade v. Aerotek, Inc., No. CCB-08-2668,
2009 WL 2757099, *1at n.1 (D. Md. Aug. 29, 2009)(explaining that although plaintiffs were

11

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 12 of 16

recent college graduates and likely had moved, plaintiffs must first attempt to mail notice before
seeking telephone numbers); Shakib, 2011 WL 5082106 at *6 (“The Court will not consider the
release of…telephone numbers unless notification via first class mail proves insufficient.”);
Harvey, 857 F. Supp. 2d at 820 (“Moreover, I believe that there are legitimate concerns with
improper solicitation, even unintentional, and privacy that counsel against providing telephone
numbers without some showing that notice by first class mail is actually insufficient.”);Carter v.
Indiana State Fair Comm’n, No. 1:11-cv-852-TWP-TAB, 2012 WL 4481350 (S.D. Ind. July 17,
2012) (“In the event that telephone numbers and birth dates become necessary to locate putative
plaintiffs, Plaintiffs may request that additional information. But Plaintiffs' assertion that it may
be difficult to locate putative plaintiffs without such information is speculative and insufficient at
this time to require telephone number and birth date disclosures.”). Lutz v. Huntington
Bancshares Inc., No. 2:12-cv-01091, 2013 WL 1703361, *7 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 19, 2013) (holding
that disclosure of telephone numbers was unnecessary unless and until plaintiffs made some
showing that using last know addresses or email addresses did not enable them to provide
reasonable notice to the class); Larson v. Rush Fitness Corp., No. 3:12-cv-109, 2013 WL
5350640 (E.D. Tenn. Sept. 23, 2013) (“If however the mailed notice is returned, the Plaintiff
may request that the Defendant prove the last-known telephone number and email of the
potential opt-in plaintiff.”).
Unless and until Plaintiffs demonstrate that sending potential class members notice via
U.S. Mail is ineffective, TEG should not be required to provide the telephone numbers of its
current and former employees.

12

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 13 of 16

C.

Disclosure of Potential Class Members’ Personal Information Should Be
Limited to Plaintiffs’ Counsel; Plaintiffs Themselves Should Not Have Access

In the event that the Court decides to order disclosure of mailing addresses and/or
telephone numbers of TEG’s current and former employees, the Court’s Order should
specifically limit disclosure to Plaintiffs’ counsel and prohibit such information from being
shared with the Plaintiffs themselves. There is no practical need for Plaintiffs themselves to be
given access to this information as their counsel is capable of communicating with potential class
members regarding the potential collective action. Furthermore, TEG employees have reported
to management that Mr. Fuentes has approached them aggressively about this lawsuit to the
point that they have felt threatened. See Hennessy Decl. ¶9. Thus, allowing Mr. Fuentes to have
access to TEG’s employees’ personal information, including their telephone numbers and
addresses would be viewed as a betrayal by TEG’s employees and would expose them to undue
influence by Mr. Fuentes.
The Court should also prohibit pre-certification communication between Plaintiffs Boris
Fuentes and Mirian Mejia and the potential class regarding their potential recovery and the scope
of Defendants’ potential liability so as to prevent them from making misrepresentations as to
these issues. Hennessy Decl. ¶11. See also Maddox v. Knowledge Learning Corp., 499 F. Supp.
2d 1338 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (prohibiting plaintiffs from posting misleading and inappropriate
information on their website).
D.

Posting of the Notice Should Be Limited to TEG’s Premises

In their proposed Order, Plaintiffs request that the Court order TEG to post the approved
Notice “in every establishment where TEG employees are employed.” Plaintiffs offer no detail
as to what this means or what locations they are referring to. TEG operates its business out of a
single location. Thus, should the court choose to order that a Notice be posted, posting the
13

Case 8:13-cv-03093-TDC Document 21 Filed 03/31/14 Page 14 of 16

Notice in the same location as all other state and federally mandated employment related notices
should be adequate.
To the extent that Plaintiffs are requesting that the Notice be posted at every location
where TEG’s employees conduct asbestos and hazardous substance remediation, the request
should be denied as TEG does not control these premises. See Ayala 2014 WL 464786 at *4.
(holding that notice need only be posted in defendant’s own offices).
E.

The Notice Should Include Additional Language

This Court has broad discretion regarding the details of the notice sent to the potential
opt-in plaintiffs. See Butler, 876 F. Supp. 2d at 575. Should the Court decide to order that a
Notice be issued, the Notice should include a neutral and non-technical reference to discovery
obligations and possible potential participation in a trial. Id. (modifying notice to potential class
members to address the discovery process and trial); Whitehorn v. Wolfgang’s Steakhouse, Inc.,
767 F. Supp. 2d 445, 450 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (requiring amendment of proposed notice to inform
potential opt-in plaintiffs “of the possibility that they will be required to participate in discovery
and testify at trial.”); Ritz v. Mike Rory Corp., No. 12 CV 367 (JBW)(RML), 2013 WL 1799974
(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2013) (ordering that the notice to potential class members include the
following language: “[Y]ou may be asked to testify and provide information about the work you
performed for defendants in order to help the court decide whether you are owed any money.”).
Thus, paragraph VI. (3) of the proposed Notice should be modified to include the
following language:
You may be asked to testify during discovery and/or at trial and provide
documents and information about your employment with The Environmental
Group in order to help the court decide whether you are owed any money.

CONCLUSION
Despite the Fourth Circuit’s requirement that plaintiffs moving for conditional
certification of a collective action set forth only a modest factual showing that they and the
proposed class were, together, victims of an unlawful common policy, plan, or scheme, Plaintiffs
rely on nothing more than the allegations contained in their Complaint and meager and
contradictory factual support.

Thus, they have failed to meet their burden for conditional

certification and their Motion must be denied.
