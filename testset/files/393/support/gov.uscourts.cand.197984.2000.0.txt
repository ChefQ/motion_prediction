NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION
TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

3

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on December 20, 2013, at 10:00 a.m., or as soon

4

thereafter as the matter may be heard, in Courtroom 1, 17th Floor, 450 Golden Gate Avenue,

5

San Francisco, California, before the Honorable Samuel Conti, Toshiba Corporation

6

(“TSB”), Toshiba America, Inc. (“TAI”), Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc.

7

(“TAIS”), and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. (“TAEC”) (collectively, the

8

“Toshiba Defendants”) will and hereby do move the Court for an order dismissing the

9

Complaint of Sharp Electronics Corporation and Sharp Electronics Manufacturing Company

10

of America, Inc. (collectively, the “Plaintiffs” or “Sharp”) (“Complaint”) as against the

11

Toshiba Defendants pursuant to Rules 12(b)(3) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil

12

Procedure. Sharp’s Complaint must be dismissed against the Toshiba Defendants because its

13

claims are based on purchases that are governed by a contract containing a mandatory forum

14

selection clause that selects the Osaka District Court, in Osaka, Japan, as the forum to resolve

15

disputes arising out of the contract. In the alternative, Sharp’s federal and New Jersey state

16

law claims for damages for its alleged purchases of products that contain CRTs (“CRT

17

Products”) must be dismissed against the Toshiba Defendants because Sharp has failed to

18

allege facts sufficient to support standing under the “ownership or control” exception to

19

Illinois Brick’s bar on indirect purchaser actions.

20

This motion is based upon this Notice of Motion, the accompanying Memorandum of

21

Points and Authorities, accompanying exhibits, the complete files and records in this action,

22

oral argument of counsel, and such other and further matters as this Court may consider.

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES

2.

facts to support standing under the “ownership or control” exception to Illinois Brick for its
claims for damages based on purchases of CRT Products.

INTRODUCTION

White & Case LLP

701 Thirteenth Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005

11
12

Sharp’s Complaint asserts federal and state-law claims based upon allegations of a

13

price-fixing conspiracy among the Toshiba Defendants and certain alleged co-conspirators.

14

Sharp Compl. ¶¶ 234-86.

15

subject to a forum selection clause contained in a contract, the Basic Transaction Agreement

16

(“BTA”), which Sharp Corporation entered into with Toshiba Corporation.

17

governs the purchases upon which Sharp bases the claims in this lawsuit.

Sharp’s claims against the Toshiba Defendants, however, are

The BTA

18

It cannot be disputed that Sharp must litigate its claims where it contracted to litigate

19

them under a forum selection clause. The BTA between Sharp Corporation and Toshiba

20

Corporation includes a clause under which Sharp agreed that all “litigation related to this

21

Agreement” be resolved in the Osaka District Court. Because the claims Sharp asserts in its

22

Complaint arise out of purchases governed by the BTA, the claims against the Toshiba

23

Defendants should be dismissed and Sharp should be required to enforce its claims against

24

the Toshiba Defendants in its chosen forum, the Osaka District Court. Accordingly, this

25

Court should dismiss the Complaint based on the BTA’s forum selection clause pursuant to

26

Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for improper venue. See Argueta v.

27

Banco Mexicano, S.A., 87 F.3d 320, 324 (9th Cir. 1996) (treating “a motion to dismiss

premised on the enforcement of a forum selection clause” as a “Rule 12(b)(3) motion to

2

dismiss for improper venue”); see also Offshore Sportswear, Inc. v. Vuarnet Int’l,

3

B.V., 114 F.3d 848, 851 (9th Cir. 1997) (“We treat dismissal based on a forum selection

4

clause like a dismissal for improper venue under Rule 12(b)(3).”).

5

In the alternative, Sharp’s federal law claims and claims under New Jersey state law

6

with respect to the Toshiba Defendants should also be dismissed because Sharp has failed to

7

plead facts sufficient to support its standing to pursue its claims for damages under

8

Illinois Brick. Sharp has alleged a conspiracy to fix prices of CRTs, but claims damages only

9

on its purchases of CRT Products (i.e., devices that incorporate CRTs). To recover damages

10

under federal antitrust law for purchases of CRT Products, Sharp must allege facts sufficient

11

to support standing under one of the recognized exceptions to Illinois Brick’s bar on indirect-

12

purchaser claims. As a result of this Court’s order and ensuing stipulation (MDL Dkt.

13

No. 1971), the only Illinois Brick exception potentially available to Sharp is the “ownership

14

or control” exception.

15

exception for those products that Sharp allegedly purchased from third-party OEMs and

16

system integrators, who allegedly purchased CRTs from unspecified defendants and co-

17

conspirators. As to purchases of monitors from third-party OEMs and system integrators,

18

Sharp makes no allegations that Sharp owned or controlled these entities. Nor does Sharp

19

allege that the Toshiba Defendants owned or controlled these entities. Thus, there is no basis

20

to support Sharp’s contention that it has standing to pursue damages against the Toshiba

21

Defendants under federal or New Jersey state law (a state with a harmonization provision

22

requiring its unfair trade practices act to be construed in accord with the federal antitrust

23

statutes) based on those purchases. Consequently, Sharp’s purported claim for damages

24

under federal and New Jersey state law based on the purchase of CRT Products must be

25

dismissed.

Sharp has failed to plead facts to support standing under this

White & Case LLP

701 Thirteenth Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005

4

Sharp’s Own Sales And Purchase Agreement — The BTA — Requires
That Any Doubt Or Question “Related” To The BTA “Shall” Be Litigated
In The Osaka District Court In Japan

5

Sharp Corporation and Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd. (now known as Toshiba

6

Corporation) entered into the BTA on March 1, 1977. See Attachment 2 (Declaration of

7

Akihiko Kashiwagi in Support of the Toshiba Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Sharp’s

8

Complaint (“Kashiwagi Decl.”); Kashiwagi Decl. at Ex. A (true and correct copy of the

9

BTA)). On the face of the document, it is apparent that the BTA is Sharp’s form agreement

10

and that it was drafted by Sharp to be used with its vendors. Kashiwagi Decl. at Ex. A. The

11

document is titled “Basic Transaction Agreement”; includes Sharp’s name as “Company A”

12

and a fill-in-the-blank section for “Company B”; has a different font for the fill-in-the-blank

13

section where “Tokyo Shibaura Electric Corporation” is written; states that the BTA covers

14

the “manufacture and supply of goods” purchased by Sharp Corporation; and selects the

15

Osaka District Court, the home prefecture of Sharp Corporation, as the court with jurisdiction

16

to resolve disputes arising out of the agreement. See Attachment 3 (“Certified Translation”)

17

at Art. 1(2) (stating that the BTA “shall apply to any Individual Agreement between Party A

18

and Party B . . .”), Art. 21(2). The BTA governs the entire relationship between Sharp and its

19

suppliers. Id. at Art. 1(2). And, as stated in Article 22 of the BTA, the agreement was an

20

annually, automatically renewing contract that was continuously in force between 1995 and

21

2007, the relevant time period of this litigation.

22

Translation at Art. 22.

23
24
25

The BTA also contains a mandatory forum selection clause.

Article 21, entitled

“Resolution of Doubt or Disputes,” states:
(1)

When there are disputes or doubts that arise in relation to this Agreement or
individual Agreement, or when there are unsolved items in this Agreement or
individual Agreement, resolutions shall be made between Party A and Party B
in good faith.

(2)

In terms of litigation related to this Agreement or the individual Agreement, the
Osaka District Court shall be the court of competent jurisdiction.

for CRTs” (Sharp Compl. ¶ 2), but despite asserting that it purchased both CRTs and CRT

7

Products, Sharp only asserts damages for its purchases of CRT Products. Sharp Compl. ¶ 27

8

(“Sharp Electronics, directly and through its subsidiaries, purchased substantial amounts of

9

CRTs manufactured by Defendants and/or their subsidiaries, their co-conspirators, and others

10

. . . .”); ¶ 29 (“SEMA purchased and invoiced substantial amounts of CRTs manufactured by

11

Defendants and/or their subsidiaries, their co-conspirators, and others . . . . ”); ¶ 287

12

(showing Sharp asserted damages only for purchases of CRT Products, “Plaintiffs purchased

13
14
15
16
17

CRT Products directly from Defendants, or their subsidiaries, agents, and/or affiliates . . .
Plaintiffs also purchased CRT Products indirectly from Defendants, or their subsidiaries,
agents, and/or affiliates . . . As a result, Plaintiffs have sustained damages to their business
and property in an amount to be determined at trial.”). Sharp alleges that the Toshiba
Defendants “manufactured, marketed, sold, and/or distributed CRT Products either directly

18

or through its subsidiaries or affiliates throughout the United States.” Sharp Compl. ¶¶ 65-

19

70.

20

Sharp alleges that it purchased CRT Products from two sources: (1) directly or

21

indirectly from “Defendants, or their subsidiaries, agents, and/or affiliates” (Sharp

22

Compl. ¶ 287); and (2) directly from “third party system integrators and OEMs . . .” and

23

“others.” Sharp Compl. ¶¶ 30, 218. Sharp does not identify from whom it directly purchased

24

the CRT Products; does not identify the “third party system integrators and OEMs”; and,

25

most critically, does not allege that it (or the Toshiba Defendants) owned or controlled the

26

third-party system integrators and OEMs from whom it purchased CRT Products.

The BTA’s Forum Selection Clause Is Mandatory And Enforceable

Courts in the Ninth Circuit presume that forum selection clauses are valid absent a
compelling and countervailing reason, even when the selected forum is outside the United
States. See, e.g., Sigma Six Tech., Inc. v. Nagarro, Inc., No. C 08-05633, 2009 WL 2031771,
at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 9, 2009) (“A forum selection clause is presumptively valid and should
be honored absent ‘some compelling and countervailing reason.’ This is true even when the
forum selection clause specifies a forum outside of the United States.”) (quoting Bremen v.
Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 3-4, 12-13 (1972)); see also Argueta, 87 F.3d at 325
(“[F]orum selection clauses are prima facie valid and should not be set aside unless the party
challenging enforcement of such a provision can show it is ‘unreasonable’ under the
circumstances.”). Further, the Ninth Circuit has adopted the Supreme Court’s strong policy
in favor of enforcing forum selection clauses in international commercial transactions. In
TAAG Linhas Aereas de Angola v. Transamerica Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d 1351, 1354
(9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit agreed with the Supreme Court that, “[t]he expansion of
American business and industry will hardly be encouraged if, notwithstanding solemn
contracts, we insist on a parochial concept that all disputes must be resolved under our laws
and in our courts.” Id. (quoting Bremen, 407 U.S. at 9).
A forum selection clause will be enforced when venue is specified through mandatory
language. See Docksider, Ltd. v. Sea Tech., Ltd., 875 F.2d 762, 764 (9th Cir. 1989). To be
mandatory, the clause must contain language that clearly designates a particular forum as the
exclusive forum. Hile v. Buth-Na-Bodhaige, Inc., No. C 07-00791 JSW, 2007 WL 4410774,

3

Here, the BTA’s forum selection clause provides that “in terms of litigation related to

4

this Agreement or the individual Agreement, the Osaka District Court shall be the court of

5

6

1995) (Posner, C.J.) (“The absence of the indefinite article . . . implies that there is only one

9

place of jurisdiction.”). In Ohkubo, the Ninth Circuit interpreted a contract translated from

10

Japanese and held that the word “shall” is a mandatory term and held the phrase “the court

11

with jurisdiction,” almost exactly the same as the BTA’s “the court of competent

12

jurisdiction,” indicates exclusivity. 364 Fed. Appx. at 342. Other courts have found the

13

exact same phrase used in the BTA, “the court of [] jurisdiction,” reflects an intent for the

14

forum to be exclusive.

15

Industrieversicherungen, 188 F. Supp. 2d 454, 460-61 (D.N.J. 2001) (finding that “the phrase

16

‘The court of jurisdiction’ . . . is a clear indication that the drafter intended for the clause to

17

be exclusive”) (emphasis in original). Further, the Ninth Circuit has held that when a forum

18

selection clause identifies a particular court, rather than just a jurisdiction, the clause clearly

19

requires exclusive jurisdiction. Docksider, 875 F.2d at 764 (citing Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc.

20

v. Supreme Oil Co., 817 F.2d 75, 77 (9th Cir. 1987)).

See Ohkubo v. Antara Biosciences, Inc., 364 Fed.

See Intermetals Corp. v. Hanover Int’l Aktiengesellschaft fur

21

Moreover, “[i]n addition to the plain language of the forum selection clause, a court

22

may look to the purpose of the clause and construe it in a manner that does not make it

23

superfluous.”

24

at 829). The forum selection clause governs two Japanese companies and the drafting party,

25

Sharp, is based in the Osaka Prefecture. See Certified Translation, at 8 (signature line

26

showing Sharp Corporation is based in Osaka, Japan); Sharp Compl. ¶ 22. Because “[t]he

27

natural forum for a suit between” two Japanese companies would be in Japan, the parties

28

would not need a clause in their contract “to permit suit in the very place to which no one

2

“[t]he obvious function of the clause is to rule out alternative sites,” both foreign and in

3

Japan, “and require that suit be brought in” the Osaka District Court. Id.

4

Therefore, the plain language of the contract, fundamental principles of contract

5

interpretation, and the structure of the contract all indicate that the forum selection clause is

6

mandatory and should thus be presumed valid and enforced according to its terms.

The BTA’s Forum Selection Clause Can Be Enforced Against
Sharp’s Antitrust Claims

The forum selection clause in Article 21(2) of the BTA governs Sharp’s claims against
the Toshiba Defendants. It is well-established that arbitration and forum selection clauses
requiring claims to be resolved in a foreign venue apply to antitrust claims. See Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 629 (1985) (holding that
“concerns of international comity, respect for the capacities of foreign and transnational
tribunals, and sensitivity to the need of the international commercial system for predictability
in the resolution of disputes” require that federal antitrust claims subject to a valid arbitration
provision be resolved in the parties agreed-upon venue); Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc.,
175 F.3d 716, 723 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding antitrust claims are arbitrable); see also Multimin
USA, Inc. v. Walco Int’l, Inc., No. CV F 06-0226, 2006 WL 1046964, at *7 (E.D. Cal.
Apr. 11, 2006) (“[A] forum selection clause applie[s] to antitrust claims because a forum
selection clause covers ‘causes of action arising directly or indirectly from’ the agreement.”)
(quoting Bense v. Interstate Battery Sys. of Am., 683 F.2d 718, 720 (2d Cir. 1982)); Person v.
Google Inc., 456 F. Supp. 2d 488, 494, 497 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (granting motion to dismiss and
transferring Sherman Act § 1 claim to Northern District of California because forum
selection clause using the term shall indicated a mandatory venue clause).
Importantly, both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have recognized that
agreements to arbitrate are a specialized form of a forum selection clause and have
interpreted and enforced both types of clauses in the same way. See Scherk v. Alberto-Culver
Co., 417 U.S. 506, 519 (1974) (holding an agreement to arbitrate before an international
tribunal should be treated and enforced the same way as a forum selection clause selecting an

international venue); Richards v. Lloyd’s of London, 135 F.3d 1289, 1295 n.4 (9th Cir. 1998)

2

(citing Scherk for the same proposition); see also Adams v. Raintree Vacation Exch., LLC,

3

702 F.3d 436, 440 (7th Cir. 2012) (noting that “[t]he stakes are less in the present case, which

4

involves a choice between courts rather than between a court and an arbitrator.”).

5

Mandatory and enforceable arbitration and forum selection clauses also apply to state

6

antitrust claims. See Siren, Inc. v. Firstline Sec., Inc., No. 06-1109, 2006 WL 3257440, at *7

7

(D. Ariz. May 17, 2006) (applying forum selection clause to state antitrust claim); cf. Order

11

12

13

federal claims asserted by Sharp in its Complaint.

15

Because The Alleged Conduct Of Sharp Electronics And SEMA Is
Closely Related To The BTA, The Forum Selection Clause Applies
To Both Entities

16

Although the Plaintiffs (i.e., Sharp Electronics Corporation (“Sharp Electronics”) and

17

Sharp Electronics Manufacturing Company of America, Inc. (“SEMA”)) are not signatories

18

to the BTA, the forum selection clause of the BTA is enforceable against both Sharp

19

Electronics and SEMA because the alleged conduct of both entities is closely related to the

20

BTA.

21

The Ninth Circuit has held that forum selection clauses apply to non-signatories

22

“where the alleged conduct of the non-parties is closely related to the contractual

23

relationship . . . .” Holland America Line Inc. v. Wartsila North America, Inc., 485 F.3d 450,

24

456 (9th Cir. 2007). Where such a “close relationship” exists, “‘a range of transaction

25

participants, parties, and non-parties, should benefit from and be subject to forum selection

26

clauses.’” Id. (quoting Clinton v. Janger, 583 F. Supp. 284, 290 (N.D. Ill. 1984)); see also

27

Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci America, Inc., 858 F.2d 509, 514 n.5 (“We agree with the

28

district court that the alleged conduct of the non-parties is so closely related to the contractual

1

relationship that the forum selection clause applies to all defendants.”). One circumstance

2

where a forum selection clause should be enforced against a non-signatory is where the non-

3

signatory is affiliated to a signatory: “A forum selection clause is sometimes enforced by or

4

against a company that is under common ownership (for example as parent and subsidiary)

5

with – that is, an affiliate of – a party to a contract containing the clause . . . .” Adams,

6

702 F.3d at 439-40. The reason for this rule is simple: “Were it not for judicial willingness

7

in appropriate circumstances to enforce forum selection clauses against affiliates of

8

signatories, such clauses often could easily be evaded.” Id. at 441.

9

In this case, Sharp alleges that “Sharp Electronics is the wholly owned U.S. sales and

10

marketing subsidiary of Osaka-based Sharp Corporation.” Sharp Compl. ¶ 22. Sharp further

11

alleges that “SEMA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharp Electronics” (Sharp Compl. ¶ 24)

12

and that “Sharp Electronics, directly and through its subsidiaries, purchased substantial

13

amounts of CRTs manufactured by Defendants . . . .” Sharp Compl. ¶ 27 (emphasis added).

14

These allegations provide ample support for the conclusion that the alleged conduct of the

15

Sharp plaintiffs is closely related to the BTA. Because Plaintiff Sharp Electronics is the

16

“U.S. sales and marketing subsidiary” for Sharp Corporation in Japan, it is apparent that the

17

purpose of Sharp Electronics is to promote the sales and marketing efforts of Sharp

18

Corporation in the United States. Plaintiff Sharp Electronics accomplishes this goal by

19

making its own purchases of CRTs in the United States, but also by making such purchases

20

“through its subsidiaries” (i.e., Plaintiff SEMA).

21

Electronics is making purchases “through its subsidiaries” is another indication that there is

22

unity of interest between Sharp Corporation (the signatory to the BTA) and Plaintiffs Sharp

23

Electronics and SEMA.

The admission that Plaintiff Sharp

24

The Ninth Circuit has held that “forum selection clauses apply equally” to signatory

25

parent corporations and non-signatory subsidiaries when the transactions between the

26

plaintiffs and the subsidiaries take place “as part of the larger contractual relationship”

27

between the signatory parent corporations. Holland America, 485 F.3d at 456. The court in

clause against a plaintiff corporate family. Even though the forum selection clause at issue

2

was only signed by the defendant parent corporation, the Court enforced the forum selection

3

clause because the complaint alleged “that some combination of the [defendant] entities”

4

acted negligently, and thus all defendants were entitled to enforce the clause against those

5

claims. Id. at 454-55.

6

Other courts have held that when a “close business relationship” exists between parties,

7

one party’s consent to a forum selection clause is sufficient to bind the non-signatory.

9

(E.D.N.Y. June 10, 2009).

08-CV-3557 (CPS), 2009 WL 2029796

In Universal Grading Service, the court enforced a forum

10

selection clause against a non-signatory when it was foreseeable that the agreement signed by

11

its president and shareholder would bind the non-signatory in future litigation. Id. at *16.

12

Likewise, the same forum selection clause was binding on non-signatory defendants because

13

the plaintiffs’ claims against the non-signatory defendants were nearly identical to those

14

against the signatory defendants, and the claims alleged that defendants acted in concert. Id.

15

Courts often bind affiliates of signatories or allow them to enforce arbitration

16

agreements based on theories such as (i) that the signatory was an agent or “alter ego” of the

17

affiliate; (ii) that the affiliate was a third-party beneficiary of the agreement, or (iii) that the

18

non-signatory is estopped from denying that arbitration is proper based on its relationship

19

with the signatory and its actions relevant to the agreement. See, e.g., Pritzker v. Merrill

20

Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 7 F.3d 1110, 1122 (3d Cir. 1993) (allowing non-

21

signatory company to compel arbitration where its sister company was a signatory and where

22

it played a role in case at issue); Sunkist Soft Drinks, Inc. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc.,

23

10 F.3d 753, 757-58 (11th Cir. 1993) (allowing parent of signatory to compel arbitration

26

(affiliate of international chain was estopped from denying arbitration agreement it did not

Corporation, Plaintiff Sharp Electronics, and Plaintiff SEMA, the estoppel theory applies

2

with full force here.

3

The same result is compelled by the facts in this case. Sharp Corporation cannot escape

4

its agreement to litigate claims in Japan merely by asserting claims only on behalf of its

5

subsidiaries.

6

Corporation, as evidenced by Sharp’s Complaint, it is entirely foreseeable that claims

7

stemming from this relationship are subject to the forum selection agreement entered by the

8

parent.

9

Because these subsidiaries share a close business relationship with Sharp

Because The Complaint Alleges A Close Relationship Among All Of
The Toshiba Defendants, All Of The Toshiba Defendants Are
Entitled To Enforce The Forum Selection Clause

11

All of the Toshiba Defendants, including the Toshiba Defendants that are not

12

signatories to the BTA, have the right to enforce the forum selection clause against the Sharp

13
14
15
16
17

Plaintiffs.
Ninth Circuit and Northern District of California case law is clear that “non-signatories
can enforce arbitration clauses where there is a ‘close relationship between the entities
involved, as well as the relationship of the alleged wrongs to the non-signatory’s obligations
and duties in the contract and . . . the claims [are] intertwined with the underlying contractual

18

obligations.’”

19

555 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 2009)). See Scherk, 417 U.S. at 519 (holding an agreement to

20

arbitrate before an international tribunal should be treated and enforced the same way as a

22

Just as this Court held previously in this litigation that all of the Toshiba Defendants

23

named in the Costco Complaint could enforce a motion to compel arbitration against Costco,

24

so too can the Toshiba Defendants enforce a forum selection clause against the Sharp

25

Plaintiffs. In Costco, the Plaintiff alleged that various Toshiba Defendants, nearly the same

26

Toshiba entities as named in the Sharp Complaint, engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of

27

CRTs, and in doing so alleged that each of the Toshiba Defendants “acted as the principal,

28

agent or joint venturer of, or for, other Defendants,” that each Defendant’s corporate family

1

“engaged in conspiratorial meetings on behalf of every company in that family,” and that “all

2

entities within the corporate families were active, knowing participants” in the alleged

3

conspiracy. Costco Compl. ¶¶ 55-57. In light of these assertions, even though only one

4

Toshiba Defendant was a signatory to the Vendor Agreement containing the arbitration

5

clause at issue in the Costco action, this Court dismissed Costco’s Complaint and compelled

6

Costco’s claims against all of the Toshiba Defendants to arbitration. As justification for

7

doing so, this Court stated the “Plaintiffs’ claims against the Toshiba Defendants, per its own

8

complaint . . . relate to their interrelated behavior and capacities as agents.” Costco, slip op.

9

at 9.

10

By the same rationale, all of the Toshiba Defendants are entitled to enforce the BTA’s

11

forum selection clause against the Sharp Plaintiffs. The Sharp Complaint parrots the exact

12

language used in the Costco Complaint to describe the relationship between the Toshiba

13

Defendants. See Sharp Compl. ¶ 80 (each of the Defendants “acted as the principal, agent or

14

joint venture of, or for, other Defendants”), ¶ 171 (each Defendant’s corporate family

15

“engaged in conspiratorial meetings on behalf of every company in that family”), and ¶ 186

16

(all Toshiba entities “were active, knowing participants” in the alleged conspiracy). As such,

17

just as with the Vendor Agreement’s arbitration provision in Costco, the BTA’s forum

18

selection clause is binding on all corporate affiliates of the signatory, Toshiba Corporation,

19

that the Plaintiffs alleged were acting as agents of each other. Consequently, under the

20

precedent in this case and others, Sharp’s claims against all of the Toshiba Defendants must

21

be dismissed pursuant to the BTA’s forum selection clause. See Costco, slip op. at 7-9; see

Sharp has asserted indirect-purchaser claims against the Toshiba Defendants and seeks

damages based upon its alleged purchase of CRT Products. Sharp Compl. ¶¶ 11, 287. Sharp

22

has asserted claims against the Toshiba Defendants seeking to recover damages for its

alleged purchase of CRT Products from unspecified “Defendants and co-conspirators,” in

OEMs, that contained CRTs manufactured by Defendants and/or their subsidiaries, and/or

26

their co-conspirators, in the United States.” Sharp Compl. ¶¶ 11, 30.

As an indirect purchaser, Sharp does not have federal antitrust standing to seek

damages for its purchases of CRT Products. Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 735; see also In re:

Sharp Must Plead Facts To Support Standing Under A Recognized
Exception To Illinois Brick To Assert Claims Under The New Jersey

19

Sharp Has Failed To Establish Standing Under The Ownership Or
Control Exception To Illinois Brick

and the New Jersey Antitrust Act because it cannot satisfy any of the exceptions to
Illinois Brick that are recognized in the Ninth Circuit. ATM Fee, 686 F.3d at 749. There are
only three recognized exceptions: (1) when the plaintiff purchased under “a preexisting costplus contract with the direct purchaser”; (2) the “‘co-conspirator’ exception”; and (3) “when
customers of the direct purchaser own or control the direct purchaser or when a conspiring
seller owns or controls the direct purchaser.” Id. (internal citations omitted). Based on a
previous order by this Court, Sharp is precluded from claiming standing under the first two
exceptions.

On August 21, 2013, the Court issued an Order granting the Defendants’

(including the Toshiba Entities’) motion to dismiss to the extent they challenged certain
Direct Action Plaintiffs’ alleged right to proceed under the “cost-plus” and “co-conspirator”
exceptions to Illinois Brick. Order Adopting in Part and Modifying in Part Special Master
Report and Rec. on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the DAPs’ Complaint at 35, In re: CRT
Antitrust Litig., No. 07-5944 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 21, 2013), ECF No. 1856 (“Aug. 21, 2013
Order”) (order granting, in part, motion to dismiss) (“Defendants’ motion to dismiss the
DAPs’ Complaints is granted to the extent that it challenges the DAPs’ alleged right to
proceed under the ‘cost-plus’ and ‘co-conspirator’ exceptions to Illinois Brick.”).1

On

October 1, 2013, this Court entered the Defendants’ and Sharps’ stipulation as an order
stating that (i) the issues addressed by the Court’s August 21, 2013 Order regarding the
Illinois Brick exceptions apply to Sharp; and (ii) Sharp does not seek to proceed under the
“cost-plus” and “co-conspirator” exceptions to Illinois Brick. Stipulation and Order Setting

In this order, the Court denied the Defendants’ motion to dismiss concerning the “ownership or control”
exception, but specifically stated that “[t]he Court also makes no ruling on the adequacy of the DAPs’
allegations of ownership and control.” Aug. 21, 2013 Order at 5. Thus, the question of whether Sharp has
made appropriate allegations of ownership or control is properly before the Court.

1

Therefore, Sharp can only assert the “ownership or control” exception in order to confer

2

standing on its purchases of CRT Products.

3

In ATM Fee, the Ninth Circuit held that the “ownership or control” exception is

4

available only where the initial seller of the price-fixed good owns or controls the direct

5

purchaser. 686 F.3d at 756 (“Freeman outlines that, whether a realistic possibility of suit

6

exists, depends on the existence of ownership or control between the direct purchaser and the

7

seller.”); id. at 757 (“We decline to extend the exception noted in Royal Printing and

8

Freeman to situations where the seller does not own or control the direct purchasers . . . .”).

9

The plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support or explain the type of control exercised.

10

In re: TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., No. M 07-1827 SI, 2013 WL 1164897, at *3

11

(N.D. Cal. Mar 20, 2013) (“LCD”). Thus, in order to adequately plead the ownership or

12

control exception to Illinois Brick, Sharp must allege which alleged Defendants or co-

13

conspirators were initial “sellers” of CRTs and name which Defendants, co-conspirators,

14

OEMs or “other suppliers” were the “direct purchasers” that ultimately sold finished CRT

15

Products to Sharp. Sharp must also allege that the entity that sold CRT Products to Sharp

16

was owned or controlled by itself, the Defendants or other named co-conspirators. Without

17

these basic facts, Sharp fails to meet its pleading burden under the ownership and control

18

exception.

19
20

4.

Sharp Fails To Sufficiently Plead Facts To Confer Standing On Its
CRT Product Purchases From “Third Party System Integrators,”
“OEMs” And “Others”

21

In its Complaint, Sharp alleges that it “purchased, directly and/or through their

22

subsidiaries, CRT Products . . . from third party system integrators and OEMs, that contained

23

CRTs manufactured by Defendants and/or their subsidiaries, and/or their co-conspirators in

24

the United States.” Sharp Compl. ¶¶ 30, 218. Sharp, however, lacks standing with respect to

25

these purchases because it does not allege that it owned or controlled either the OEMs or the

26

“others” from whom it purchased CRT Products. Nor does Sharp allege that the defendants

27

owned or controlled these OEMs or other suppliers.

1

The “ownership or control” exception to Illinois Brick “has been construed to

2

encompass relationships involving such functional economic or other unity between the

3

direct purchaser and either the defendant or the indirect purchaser, that there effectively has

4

been only one sale.”

5

Supp. 2d 1166, 1180 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (emphasis added). As explained elsewhere, “[t]he

6

rationale of Illinois Brick’s bar to indirect purchaser suits does not apply where the supposed

7

intermediary is controlled by one or the other of the parties.” LCD, 2013 WL 1164897, at *2

8

(quoting In re: Mercedes-Benz Anti-Trust Litig., 157 F. Supp. 2d 355, 355 (D.N.J. 2001))

9

(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in order for Sharp to have standing with respect to

10

its purchases of CRT Products from OEMs and other suppliers, it must make sufficient

11

allegations that (1) it owned or controlled these OEMs and other suppliers; or (2) the Toshiba

12

Defendants owned or controlled these OEMs and other suppliers.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., 608 F.

13

Far from making sufficient allegations of ownership or control, Sharp does not make

14

any allegations that it owned or controlled the OEMs and other suppliers from which it

15

purchased CRT Products.

16

Defendants owned or controlled these OEMs and other suppliers. Indeed, Sharp appears to

17

recognize that the OEMs in question are not related to any defendant. See Sharp Compl. ¶ 30

18

(“[Sharp] also purchased, directly and/or through their subsidiaries, CRT Products . . . from

19

third party system integrators and OEMs . . . .”) (emphasis added). This failure to allege

20

ownership and control is fatal to Sharp’s attempt to assert standing with respect to these

21

purchases. The Court’s decision in LCD, 2013 WL 1164897 (N.D. Cal. March 20, 2013),

22

explains why.

Sharp also does not make any allegations that the Toshiba

23

The Court in LCD considered a motion to dismiss filed against four plaintiffs:

24

Proview Technology Inc. (“PTI”) and three of its affiliated OEMs located in Taiwan and

25

China. Id. at *1. As alleged in the complaint, PTI received finished LCD products from its

26

affiliated OEMs through a process by which PTI instructed its affiliated OEMs to purchase

27

the input (LCD panels) and manufacture them into LCD finished products. Id. The LCD

28

Court considered the allegations in the complaint, but found that the plaintiffs “fail[ed] to

1

adequately allege that [their] claims fall within the control exception to Illinois Brick.” Id.

2

at *3. Recognizing that the plaintiffs made conclusory allegations that PTI had “control of”

3

its affiliated OEMs, the LCD Court nevertheless held that these conclusory allegations

4

“fail[ed] to allege sufficient facts to support or explain the type of control exercised by PTI or

5

to demonstrate that it is adequate to meet the exception.” Id. Thus, the Court granted the

6

motion to dismiss with respect to its affiliated OEMs.

7

By its decision, the LCD Court reveals the importance of adequate allegations of

8

ownership or control if the plaintiffs seek to establish standing as indirect purchasers.

9

Because Sharp has failed to make any allegations of ownership or control with respect to its

10

purchases of CRT Products from OEMs and other suppliers (much less adequate allegations,

11

as required by the LCD Court), it is apparent that Sharp lacks federal antitrust standing with

12

respect to these purchases and that, as a result, the Toshiba Defendants’ motion to dismiss

13

should be granted with respect to these purchases.

14

CONCLUSION

15

For these reasons, the Toshiba Defendants’ motion to dismiss should be granted, and

16

Sharp’s complaint should be dismissed with respect to the Toshiba Defendants.
