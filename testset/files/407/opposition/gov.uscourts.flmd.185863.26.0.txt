Case No. 8:06-cv-01640

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE
ORDER AND SUPPORTING LEGAL MEMORANDUM
Plaintiff, John J. Thornton ("Thornton"), pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(b), hereby files
this opposition to Defendants J Jargon Co. and Jeanette C. Linders’ (“Defendants”) Motion
For Protective Order [Docket No. 21] (the "Motion"). Defendant's Motion should be denied
because: (1) Rule 45 provides adequate protection to the third parties subpoenaed; (2)
Defendants do not have standing to quash these subpoenas; (3) the parties have agreed to a
Protective Order, which alleviates any reasonable concerns the Defendants have intimated;
and (4) Defendants improperly ask this Court to quash the entire subpoena, but essentially
concede the majority of the subpoenas are proper.

BACKGROUND
Defendants' successful play entitled Menopause the Musical (the "Musical") has run
at playhouses around the globe. As is customary when attending such a play, patrons expect
a program when they arrive, and Defendants' Musical is no different in this regard. The
programs Defendants have distributed, or caused to be distributed, contain a verbatim copy
of Thornton's copyrighted "Take the Age Test" (the "Test"). The Test, just like the Musical,
is directed towards entertaining the baby boomer generation. There can be no question that
the Test's inclusion in Defendant's program provided value to the Defendants. It is this
wholesale plagiarism of Thornton's Test that is the heart of this lawsuit.
To determine the extent of plagiarism of Thornton's Test, Thornton issued document
subpoenas to playhouses across the country pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. Exhibit A,
attached to Defendants' Motion is an accurate copy of such a subpoena. Only one of these
subpoenas issued from the Middle District of Florida. Thornton has learned that Defendants'
counsel contacted at least one playhouse on an ex parte basis and, on a not-so-subtle basis,
encouraged the playhouse to object to the subpoena under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. See Letter
from D. Wasylik to S. Aebig of 2/14/07. It stands to reason that all of the playhouses under
subpoena received a similar letter. Again, Plaintiff's counsel did not receive any of this
correspondence from Defendants' counsel.

The invitation of Defendants' counsel is

significant because despite being encouraged to object, many of the playhouses have
willingly provided documents and none of the playhouses have attempted to quash the
subpoena as Defendants are attempting to do here. In fact, the response date for these

2

document subpoenas expired weeks ago. See Ex. A to Def.'s Motion (requesting documetns
to be produced by March 5, 2007).
Thus, Defendants' Motion seeks to do only what the recipients of the subpoenas chose
not to do. Further, as discussed below, Rule 45(c) is the proper authority for quashing such a
subpoena, yet Defendants recognize that, as a party, they do not have any basis to pursue
such a charge. Defendants Motion is improper, and this Court should deny it.
ARGUMENT
Defendants' Motion For Protective Order should be denied for several reasons: (1)
Rule 45 provides adequate protection to the third parties subpoenaed; (2) Defendants do not
have standing to pursue quashing these subpoenas; (3) the parties have agreed to a Protective
Order, which alleviates any of Defendants' reasonable concerns; and (4) Defendants
improperly ask this Court to quash the entire subpoena, but essentially concede the majority
of the subpoenas are proper.
I. RULE 45 ADEQUATELY PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF THE THIRD
PARTIES SUBPOENAED.
Rule 45(c) provides a means for protecting against concerns that would be raised by
non-parties that have been subpoenaed. For instance, a person responding to a subpoena may
move the court by which the subpoena issued requesting that court modify or quash the
subpoena. See Rule 45(c)(3)(A). However, in this case, only one of the subpoenas that is the
subject of Defendants' Motion issued from the Middle District of Florida (and even that one
issued from a different Division).1 The question of whether to quash any subpoenas in this

1

As of the date of this filing, Thorton has served 11 subpoenas on playhouses throughout the country. These
subpoenas have issued from the following courts: C.D. California, N.D. California, M.D. Florida, (Jacksonville

3

matter is better left to the courts from which the subpoenas have issued.

Moreover,

Defendants' wholesale request to "quash[] in their entirety the third-party subpoenas sent to
performing houses" falls drastically short of the specificity required of a movant under Rule
45. Defendants have not identified which subpoenas precisely to quash, because Defendants
likely recognize that most of the subpoenas were not issued by this court, and thus other
courts are more properly situated to handle any disputes that should arise as to the burden
placed upon the recipients of the subpoenas. Rule 45 is the proper avenue for quashing thirdparty subpoenas, and its provisions should be invoked by the people on whom the subpoenas
were served, not the Defendants.
II. DEFENDANTS DO NOT HAVE STANDING UNDER RULE 45 TO PURSUE
QUASHING THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS.
A party does not have standing to quash a subpoena unless the party shows a
"personal right or privilege" with respect to the subpoena. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Southeast
Floating Docks, Inc., 231 F.R.D. 426, 429 (M.D. Fla. 2005).2

Auto-Owners directly

contradicts Defendants' position, as the court refused to quash the third-party subpoena
directed at financial records, precisely because the Defendants did not have standing to seek
such relief. In fact, Auto-Owners rejected the exact argument Defendants have put forth as
the basis for their Motion.
In Auto-Owners, the court recognized that the "financial records sought are business
records of non-parties." Id. The court continued: "Defendants have not established any

Division) N.D. Georgia, N.D. Illinois, S.D. Indiana, E.D. Michigan, E.D. Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, S.D.
New York, Oregon, E.D. Pennsylvania, and the W.D. Washington.
2
Defendants cite to Auto-Owners for the proposition that Defendants have standing to quash third-party
subpoenas under Rule 45. See Motion at p. 3. Defendants neglect to inform the Court that Auto-Owners
requires a party seeking to quash a subpoena show that it has a personal right or privilege at stake.

4

expectation of privacy in their business transactions with other corporations and have not
made any factual showing that the records are confidential or proprietary….Therefore,
Defendants do not have standing under Rule 45 to quash the subpoenas regarding financial
records" Id. (internal citation omitted).
The court also rejected the Auto-Owners defendants argument that the subpoenas
were oppressive and placed an undue burden on the Defendants: "Defendants do not have
standing to quash the subpoenas on the grounds of oppression and undue burden placed upon
third parties where the non-parties have not objected on those grounds." Id. See also, 8
Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice And Procedure
Civil 2d § 2035 ("A party may not ask for an order to protect the rights of another party or a
witness if that party or witness does not claim protection for himself.")
This Court should not quash the third-party subpoenas, because Defendants do not
have standing to pursue such a request. Even in the face of Defendants' improper suggestion,
none of the playhouses that have been served with subpoenas have moved to quash under
Rule 45(c), and this Court should not allow Defendants to attempt to do so on the playhouses'
behalf.
III. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO A PROTECTIVE ORDER WHICH
VITIATES ALL OF DEFENDANTS' CONCERNS.
The parties negotiated an agreed upon Protective Order, which has been filed with the
Court at Docket No. 25. The parties have agreed to be bound by the Protective Order's terms
pending formal entry by the Court. As the first section of this Protective Order indicates, the
protections extend to "all information supplied during discovery, in any form, which shall be
designated by any party, or any third party producing such information." Defendants

5

have the ability to invoke the provisions of this Protective Order "at the time or production,
or subsequent to the production."
Thornton has no objection to considering documents provided by the playhouses as
subject to the terms of the Protective Order. Defendants choice to ignore the protections
already agreed to and seek intervention by this Court should not be looked upon favorably.
Had Defendants informed Thornton of their desire to make production from the playhouses
subject to the Protective Order, Thornton would certainly be amendable.

Even in this

posture, Thornton still agrees to let the Protective Order, agreed to by the parties, govern
production from the playhouses.
IV. DEFENDANTS ATTACK THE SUBPOENAS AS A WHOLE, BUT ONLY
PROVIDE ARGUMENT CONCERNING 1 OF THE 12 REQUESTED
CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS. ALL 12 CATEGORIES ARE RELEVANT
AND PROPERLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF DISCOVERY.
It is within the Court's discretion to enter an order to protect a party from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c); AutoOwners, 231 F.R.D. at 429.

"The party seeking a protective order has the burden to

demonstrate good cause, and must make 'a particular and specific demonstration of fact as
distinguished from stereotyped and conclusory statements' supporting the need for a
protective order." Auto-Owners, 231 F.R.D. at 429-30 (citing U.S. v. Garrett, 571 F.2d 1323,
1326 n.3 (5th Cir. 1978)). Defendants Motion sets forth only conclusory statements and
stereotypes to counteract what Defendants perceive as a "shotgun approach to discovery."
Such a showing falls drastically short of that required for the Court to grant relief under Rule
26.

Moreover, as explained above, Thornton does not object to maintaining the

confidentiality of any documents produced from third-party playhouses in response to these

6

subpoenas. Defendants' decision to move the Court to act, even in the face of the agreed
upon Protective Order, is not cause for the Court to limit the subpoenas as served.
Defendants couch their argument as directed to requests 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in the
third-party subpoenas. However, only request 12 seeks information concerning revenue
derived from the Musical at the playhouse. Defendants do not point out that request 12
concerns the playhouses' revenue, and not the Defendants' revenue. As the Defendants are a
party to this litigation, Thornton has requested such information directly from Defendants.
Defendants improper choice to withhold this information in discovery is not grounds for
preventing the playhouses from responding to the subpoenas.
Defendants only specifically mention requests 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Request No. 1
seeks: "All executed agreements, contracts, letters of intent, or letters of understanding
between You and Defendants." There can be no reasonable question that such a request is
relevant, and reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable information. For instance, these
contracts will contain provisions governing the relationships between the two entities,
including who is responsible for the content and distribution of the programs. Defendants do
not specifically and particularly point out how this request is improper, because Defendants
know that Request No. 1 is properly served in the subpoenas.
Request No. 8 seeks: "All Communications and Documents exchanged between or
among You and Defendants, including any employees, affiliates, agents, independent
contractors or others Associated With any of those entities." As above, there can be no
reasonable question that such communications and documents are reasonably calculated to
lead to discoverable information. Just as discussed above, Defendants and the playhouses

7

may have exchanged documents concerning what information should be displayed in the
programs, and how the advertising areas within the program will be sold. Again, Defendants
do not specifically and particularly point out how this request is improper, because
Defendants know that Request No. 8 is properly served in the subpoenas.
Requests 9, 10 and 11 seek information concerning the number of times the Musical
was performed at the playhouses, how many tickets were sold, and how many patrons
attended, respectively. This information is directly tied to how many infringing copies of the
Test were produced.

Again, Defendants do not have a reasonable argument that this

information should not be subject to discovery.
Finally, Request 12 seeks: "Documents sufficient to show all revenue derived from
the Musical at Your Playhouse, including ticket sales, merchandise revenue, and other
incidental revenue." As explained below, this request is proper, and reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence.
1. Thornton Is Entitled To Defendants' Profits And Thornton's Actual Damages.
The copyright statute makes available two categories of compensatory damages: (1)
the infringers profits; and (2) the copyright owner's actual damages. 17 U.S.C. § 504(b).3
Section 504(b) provides:
Actual damages and profits. The copyright owner is entitled to recover the
actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and any
profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not
taken into account in computing the actual damages. In establishing the
infringer's profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the
infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her

3

17 U.S.C. § 504 gives copyright owners a choice between actual damages combined with the infringer's profits
(§ 504(b)) or statutory damages (§ 504(c)). This discussion relates only to section 504(b).

8

deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other
than the copyrighted work.
These damages are available to copyright holders to further two distinct purposes.
"Damages are awarded to compensate the copyright owner for his losses from the
infringement, and profits are awarded to prevent the infringer from unfairly benefiting from a
wrongful act." Patry on Copyright § 22:98, citing H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.
161 (1976); S. Rep. No. 473, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 143 to 144 (1975). Both categories of
damages are necessary to prevent wholesale theft of protected works. Thornton, as the
original author and copyright owner, is entitled to actual damages for Defendants' theft.
Furthermore, copyright infringers, such as Defendants, must be deterred from the wrongful
act of copyright infringement. Thus, the infringer must be disgorged of its profits.
Defendants misapply copyright law with respect to damages. At the outset, it is
important to note that the authority Defendants rely upon for its flawed view of copyright
damages come from cases decided at the summary judgment stage, and certainly do not
support Defendants attempt to limit discovery. Furthermore, Defendants rely upon a nonbinding, non-published decisions from another Circuit for the flawed proposition that
Defendants' revenues are not relevant to this copyright infringement action. Respectfully,
Defendants have misconstrued the law.
2. Thornton's Copyrighted Test Is Part Of The Playgoing Experience, Which Is What
Defendants' Patrons Have Purchased.
Recovering an infringer's profits in a copyright infringement case is a two-step
process, wherein the burden begins with the copyright holder, but shifts to the copyright
infringer. First, the copyright holder "need only present evidence of the gross revenue of the

9

infringer." Oravec v. Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures L.C., 496 F.Supp.2d 1148, 1175 (S.D. Fla.
2006) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 504(b)). Then, the burden shifts to the defendant "to establish their
expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work."
Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted).
The plaintiff must offer some reasonable connection between the infringement and
the defendant's profits. See Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravents Football Club, Inc., 346 F.3d 514,
521 (4th Cir. 2003); On Davis v. The Gap, Inc., 246 F.3d 152, 160 (2d Cir. 2001). In On
Davis, the court provided the following illustrative example:
If a publisher published an anthology of poetry which contained a poem
covered by the plaintiff's copyright, we do not think the plaintiff's statutory
burden would be discharged by submitting the publisher's gross revenue
resulting from its publication of hundreds of titles, including trade books,
textbooks, cookbooks, etc. In our view, the owner's burden would require
evidence of the revenues realized from the sale of the anthology containing
the infringing poem. The publisher would then bear the burden of proving its
costs attributable to the anthology and the extent to which its profits from the
sale of the anthology were attributable to factors other than the infringing
poem, including particularly the other poems contained in the volume.
On Davis, 245 F.3d at 152. In Oravec, the copyright at issue concerned plaintiff's
architectural designs allegedly used without permission in the construction of twin luxury
condominium towers. Oravec, 469 F.Supp.2d at 1151. The plaintiff had put forth evidence
concerning defendants' total revenues from the sales of the infringing buildings. Id. at 1175.
The court agreed that this was proper under copyright law and stated:
While the allegedly infringing exterior design may only contribute to a portion
of Defendants overall revenue from sales of the building, there is no doubt
that the exterior design is so interwoven with the building as a whole that, like
the anthology which contains the infringing poem [as discussed in On Davis],
sale of the building amounts to sale of the infringing design in a way to meet
the needed 'conceivable connection' standard of Bouchat.

10

Id. at 1175-76.
Contrary to Defendants' position, there is a strong causal connection between the
Defendants' infringing reproduction of the Test and revenue generated from the play. It is
not a matter of coincidence that Thornton's Test was selected by Defendants for inclusion in
their program. Rather, the contents of the Test directly tie-in to the contents of the Musical,
and enhance the audience's experience before, during and after the performance.

It is

common in the performing arts to distribute programs such as those distributed by the
Defendants.

Defendants patrons expected to be entertained not only by the musical

performance, but by the entire experience when they purchased their tickets to the Musical.
Defendants' patrons paid for the entertainment experience, and part of that revenue is
attributable to Thornton's Test.
The Musical features actors who are baby boomers, the music of baby boomers,
issues unique to baby boomers, and now, thanks to Thornton, a Test to determine if you are a
baby boomer. Without question, the infringing reproduction of the Test helps create the
overall baby boomer experience at the Musical. It is this baby boomer experience that
Defendants' patrons have paid for and this experience will lead patrons to recommend the
play to other baby boomers. Defendants have profited off of their illegal use of the Test, and
the copyright laws properly insist that such wrongful acts be discouraged. The copyright
laws require Thorton present evidence of the Defendants' revenue, to which Defendants must
respond by apportioning what revenues are not attributable to Defendants' illegal use of the
Test.

11

3. A Reasonable License Is A Proper Means For Determining Thornton's Actual
Damages.
Thornton is also entitled to his actual damages. The courts have consistently held that
a reasonable license is one proper way for determining the copyright owner's "actual
damages." See e.g. On Davis, 246 F.3d at 164. See also Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 562 (1985). Information concerning the success of the Musical
at various playhouses is certainly relevant and likely to lead to discoverable information
concerning a reasonable licensing fee.
For instance, in On Davis, the copyright holder plaintiff had previously licensed the
use of his copyrighted image. On Davis, 246 F.3d at 161. The Second Circuit reversed
summary judgment granted in favor of the defendant on the basis that a reasonable jury
could find the plaintiff's previous sale was the fair market value for licensing the plaintiff's
work, and thus a good measure of the plaintiff's actual damages. Id.
Defendants' argument ignores the foundation and purposes for allowing damages for
copyright infringement: (1) compensating a copyright owner for his loss; and (2) preventing
copyright infringers from unfairly benefiting from a wrongful act. Defendants focus only on
the latter objective of disgorging its profits, but entirely ignore the main thrust behind
copyright – protecting works of authorship. Without considering both purposes, copyright
protection would become only a "right without a remedy." Business Trends Analysts, Inc. v.
Freedom Group, Inc., 887 F.2d 399, 406 (2d Cir. 1989). See also 4 Nimmer on Copyright §
14.02.

12

Information on the success of the Musical aids in an analysis of a reasonable license.
Defendants meaningless description of the Test as a "one page filler item" notwithstanding,
the programs distributed at the Musical, as is typical at such performances, contain
significant amounts of advertising. If the Test serves only as a "one page filler item," that is
one page less advertising revenue. Put another way, one way to measure a licensing fee for
this Test is the amount charged for a full page advertisement published in one of Defendants'
programs. Like all advertising, the more people that will view the ad, the more valuable the
space for presenting the ad becomes. It is not a matter of coincidence that National Football
League Superbowl advertising demands more revenue dollars than airtime sold to advertisers
in off-peak hours. Similarly, when Defendants' Musical is performed to sell-out crowds in
large arenas, wherein all parties involve generate significant revenue, "one page filler items"
become more valuable.
CONCLUSION
Defendants improperly try to limit the scope of discovery and have provided no
adequate justification for doing so. Defendants contacted each third party subpoenaed, and
not-so-subtly suggested the subpoenaed playhouses refuse to respond to the subpoenas. Not
satisfied that these independent entities, with legal counsel of their own, did not take up
Defendants' "suggestion," Defendants bring the current motion.

As explained above,

Defendants do not have standing to pursue the relief they request. Moreover, such relief is
entirely unnecessary, as Rule 45(c) and the already agreed upon Protective Order sufficiently
weigh against whatever concerns Defendants may have with regards to the sought-after

13

discovery.

Finally, the sought-after information is well within the scope of discovery

provided by Rule 26. Defendants' Motion should be denied in its entirety.
