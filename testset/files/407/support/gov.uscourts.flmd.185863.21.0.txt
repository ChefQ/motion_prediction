J. JARGON CO.,
a Florida Corporation, and
JEANETTE C. LINDERS,
an individual,
Defendants.
/

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
Defendants J. Jargon Co. and Jeannette C. Linders (collectively, “Jargon”), pursuant
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c), move this Court for a protective order quashing in
their entirety the third party subpoenas sent to performing houses at which the Defendants’
play, Menopause the Musical, (the “Musical”) has been performed, on the grounds that such
subpoenas are designed to harass, embarrass and oppress Defendants and are not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. A true and correct copy of a
sample subpoena and accompanying document request is attached hereto as Exhibit A. In
the alternative, Defendants move the Court to severely limit the materials required to be
produced to protect the Defendants from harassment, oppression, and embarrassment by

releasing the third parties from providing any financial or contractual documents concerning
Menopause the Musical.
BACKGROUND
Defendant Linders is the author of the Musical. In this copyright infringement action,
Plaintiff does not allege or even contend that the Musical in any way infringes his alleged
work. Rather, Plaintiff alleges the free program or Playbill distributed at two productions of
the Musical included a simple, fact intensive “Age Test” Plaintiff claims to have authored.
See Compl. Ex. A.

The programs in question contain information about the Musical,

including biographical information about the performers, and other credits to the production
staff. A true and correct copy of two sample programs already produced to Plaintiff by
Defendants – one with and one without the “Age Test” – is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
In this shotgun approach to discovery, Plaintiff seeks sensitive financial documents
from at least a dozen Playhouses where the Musical has been performed. The vast majority
of the documents sought, however, do not concern the subject matter of this litigation –
namely, the programs and whether or not the Age Test is included in them. Rather, Plaintiff
seeks clearly irrelevant and overbroad discovery concerning the financial success of the
Musical. Defendants have already timely objected to providing such documentation in
discovery propounded directly to them. Plaintiff’s attempt to obtain the sensitive documents
and clearly irrelevant documents from third parties constitutes harassment and should be
quashed by this Court.

ARGUMENT
I.

DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THIRD PARTY
DOCUMENT REQUESTS THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY CALCULATED
TO LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE.
Even under the most liberal reading of the federal discovery rules, the third party

subpoenas should be quashed and a protective order issue. Because, as a matter of law,
discovery of the profits of the Musical and other sensitive financial documents is utterly
irrelevant to any reasonable theory of damages, Plaintiff’s third party subpoenas for
document are beyond the scope of Rule 26.
Defendants have standing to ask this court to quash third party subpoenas that request
irrelevant information. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Southeast Floating Docks, Inc., 231 F.R.D.
426, 429 (M.D. Fla. 2005)(granting defendant’s motion for protective order). The lack of
relevance, alone, is sufficient to constitute “good cause” for purposes of Rule 26(c). Id. In
the context of discovery, the term “relevant” is to be “construed broadly to encompass any
matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that bears on, any issue that
is or may be in the case.” Id., quoting Oppenheimer Fund v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351
(1978). However, even under the broadest possible view of relevance, Plaintiff’s discovery
must be quashed. As in Auto-Owners, “Plaintiff's discovery regarding financial matters is
grossly overbroad and irrelevant.” Id. at 430.

II.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MUSICAL IS IRRELEVANT
UNDER ANY THEORY OF DAMAGES.
Plaintiff’s third party subpoenas all seek essentially the same information.

Specifically, requests 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 seek irrelevant documents and communications,1
including those tending to show the revenues from Defendants’ play, Menopause the
Musical. The revenues of the play are clearly irrelevant to any alleged damages calculation
permitted by copyright law. Such documents have no bearing on Plaintiff’s actual damages,
nor do they have any bearing on “profits of the infringer that are attributable to the
infringement.” 17 U.S.C. § 504 (emphasis added). Simply put, it is “beyond conception”
that the choice of a theatergoer to purchase tickets to and attend a performance of the Musical
“could conceivably be affected” by the presence or absence of the Age test in the free
program.

See Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravens, Inc., 215 F.Supp. 611, 620 (D. Md.

2002)(granting summary judgment to defendant on damages issues).
Plaintiff’s attempt to discover the profits of Menopause the Musical are without legal
merit and should be stopped by this court. Under longstanding copyright law precedent, the
only relevant profits of the Defendants that a Plaintiff is entitled to prove for purposes of
determining damages are those “attributable to the infringement.” 17 U.S.C. § 504. The
Musical’s profits from ticket sales, souvenirs, t-shirts, soundtracks, and other items is not
remotely affected by a one page filler item in the free program given out after tickets have
1

To the extent the subpoenas seek “communications” which they define as “conversations, meetings,
discussions, and any other occasion for verbal exchange, whether in Person or by telephone” the subpoenas are
overbroad and should be quashed. Such items are not “documents” and are not subject to Rule 45. Similarly, to
the extent the subpoenas seek to burden non-parties with creating a record or log of documents no longer in
existence, they should also be quashed. Subpoenas under Rule 45 may only request production of “books,
documents or tangible things in the possession, custody or control,” and cannot require parties to create
documents that do not exist.
See, e.g., Insituform Technologies, Inc. v. Cat Contracting, Inc.
168 F.R.D. 630, 633 (N.D. Ill. 1996).

been purchased, as patrons take their seats at the performance.

Plaintiff’s request for

documents showing “all revenue derived from the Musical at your Playhouse, including
ticket sales, merchandising revenue, and other incidental revenue” (request 12) is completely
overbroad and constitutes a fishing expedition.
Courts routinely limit the damages inquiry (at both the proof and discovery stages) to
profits that are reasonably related to the alleged infringement. For example, in Bouchat v.
Baltimore Ravens, Inc., 215 F.Supp.2d 611, 620 (D. Md. 2002), an artist sued a professional
sports team, and proved that the sports team’s designers had relied upon the plaintiff’s
copyrighted sketch in designing the team’s adopted Flying B logo. In considering the issue
of damages, the Ravens sought partial summary judgment that its gross revenues related to
sponsorships, broadcast and other media licenses, ticket sales, and general business revenues
that were not reasonably related to the infringement.
The Court granted defendant’s motion, holding that it was “beyond conception that a
decision to obtain a personal seat license, a season ticket, a game ticket, a stadium parking
space or a hot dog at half time could conceivably be affected by whether the tickets, the
players’ uniform, the flags in the parking lot or the hot dog stand displayed the Flying B
logo.” Id. (emphasis added). Notably, the court did not rely upon proffered affidavits with
regard to the role of the logo in generating certain categories of income, but rather held that,
as a matter of law, there is no “logical argument” that “could cause a reasonable person to
find that certain of the Defendants’ categories of revenue (and thus profits) could be
attributable to the infringement of Plaintiff's copyrighted work.” Id. at 620. The Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, noting that the affidavits “merely confirm

5

what ordinary experience would otherwise seem to render apparent.” Bouchat v. Baltimore
Ravens Football Club, Inc., 346 F.3d 514, 526 n.10 (4th Cir. 2003). Here, the factual
situation is nearly identical: No logical argument exists that theatre patrons’ decisions to
purchase tickets or merchandise related to the Musical is in any way caused by the presence
or absence of the Age Test in the free program.
Similarly, in Burns v. Imagine Films Entertainment, Inc., No. 92-CV-2438, 2001 WL
34059379 (W.D. N.Y. Aug. 23, 2001), plaintiff sued Universal Studios for its role in
producing the movie Backdraft, which the Court held infringed plaintiff’s copyright. In
considering the issue of damages, the court held that evidence of the defendant’s revenue
relating to the Backdraft attraction at the Universal Studios’ theme park was irrelevant and
not a proper measure of damages. Like the play at issue here, the court in Burns noted that
“the Backdraft attraction itself contains no infringing materials” and was thus a noninfringing enterprise. Id. at * 4. The district court held:
To recover profits from a non-infringing enterprise, a copyright
holder must prove a causal nexus between infringement of his
work and the profits, and must accurately calculate the portion
of the profits attributable to infringement. Frank Music Corp.
v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 886 F.2d 1545, 1553-54 (9th
Cir.1989).… Plaintiffs have not offered any reasonably
accurate method of calculating profits from the theme park that
are attributable to infringements in the film. Plaintiffs concede
that the appeal of the “Backdraft attraction” is largely due to
recreation of the film’s special effects and not to the
screenplay. Also, “Backdraft” is only one of several attractions
at the theme park. As Defendants point out, if there were no
“Backdraft attraction,” there likely would be an attraction
based on another Universal film in its place. Plaintiffs would
have to accurately calculate how many people (a) went to the
park because of “Backdraft” and (b) would not have gone if it
had a different attraction. They have presented no viable
method of making this calculation. Thus, although the theme

6

park may have reaped some “marginal benefit” from infringing
elements in the film Backdraft, the percentage of such profits
attributable to Plaintiffs “is too speculative and the relationship
between such profits and infringement is too attenuated” to
justify an award of indirect damages from theme park profits.
Frank Music, 886 F.2d at 1554.
Id. at *4 (emphasis added). Similar to the Burns plaintiff, Plaintiff in the case at bar cannot
show any reasonable method of calculating profits attributable to the presence of the Age
Test. Unlike Burns, where it is at least theoretically possible that a theme park visitor could
be attending the amusement park in part because he knew about and wanted to visit the
Backdraft attraction, plain common sense and logic dictate that theatergoers chose to attend
the Musical because of the Musical, not because of the program, let alone a filler piece in the
program.
Courts have not hesitated to prohibit such overly broad fishing expeditions.

In

Compaq Computer Corp. v. Ergonome Inc., No. Civ.A. H-97-1026, 2001 WL 34104827 at
*2 (S.D.Tex., June 27, 2001), the district court refused to compel the requested financial
information on facts very similar to the case at bar. In Compaq, Plaintiff Ergonome sought to
prove that Compaq’s Safety and Comfort Guides, which were “included with other materials
usually provided to purchasers of Compaq’s computers,” had infringed its copyright in a
handbook on keyboard ergonomics. See Compaq Computer Corp. v. Ergonome Inc., 137
F.Supp.2d 768, 770 (S.D.Tex. 2001)(setting out facts pertinent to dispute). Ergonome sought
discovery of Compaq’s gross revenues “related to the number of computers sold during the
relevant time period.” Compaq, 2001 WL 34104827 at *2. The court, relying in part on On
Davis v. The Gap, Inc., 246 F.3d 152, 160 (2d Cir.2001), explained that “the term ‘gross
revenue’ under the statute means gross revenue reasonably related to the infringement, not

7

unrelated revenues,” and held that “[t]he ancillary nature of the book, relative to the sale of
the computers themselves, is irrefutable.” Compaq, 2001 WL 34104827 at *2 (emphasis
added).
The Compaq court held that “Ergonome’s request for information on Compaq’s gross
revenues relating to all computers sold is overbroad because the record does not indicate to
what extent, if any, Compaq’s gross revenues on computers were “reasonably related” to its
alleged infringement of The HAND Book.” Compaq, 2001 WL 34104827 at *2. The court
noted that the Plaintiff’s theory of damages – which would have allowed plaintiff to proffer
to the jury Compaq’s gross revenues for every computer purchased with the allegedly
infringing ergonomics booklet – “defies logic, and … defies any interpretation of 17 U.S.C.
§ 504(b) that contemplates a reasonable relationship between an infringer’s gross revenues
and its infringement.” Id. at *3. Moreover, the district court found that “Compaq is not on
trial for the number of computers it has sold; ergo, its potential liability may not rest on that
mathematical root alone” when denying Ergonome’s motion to compel. Id.
Plaintiff cannot show any reasonable relationship between the documents sought
concerning the gross revenues of the Musical and the alleged infringement. The Plaintiff’s
harassing, oppressive, and completely overbroad fishing expedition via subpoenas to third
party playhouses should be quashed.

COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 3.01(g)
Counsel for Defendants attempted to confer with counsel for Plaintiff via e-mail on
March 5, 2007 in a good faith effort to resolve the issues herein. On March 6, 2007, counsel
for Plaintiff responded to Defendants’ request for a Rule 3.01(g) conference by letter, stating
“we are currently looking into this matter and will get back with you shortly.” On March 15,
2007, counsel for Defendants again attempted to confer with counsel for Plaintiff but was
unable to reach Plaintiff’s counsel by telephone. Counsel for Defendants will continue to
attempt to confer with counsel for Plaintiff and will update this certificate accordingly.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, the Defendants request that this Court quash the third party
subpoenas in their entirety. In the alternative, Defendants request that the Court issue a
protective order striking document requests 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 or the equivalent from the
third party subpoenas served thus far and order that Plaintiff’s cease attempting to ascertain
discovery of revenues derived from the Musical.
