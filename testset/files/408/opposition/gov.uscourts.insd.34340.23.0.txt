CASE NO. 4:11-cv-00059-SEB-WGH
Judge: Hon. Sarah Evans Barker
Magistrate Judge: Hon. William G. Hussman
RESPONSE BY PLAINTIFF HARD
DRIVE PRODUCTIONS, INC., IN
OPPOSITION TO MOVANT’S MOTION
TO QUASH OR MODIFY SUBPOENA

An anonymous individual (“Movant”) claiming to be associated with Internet Protocol
(“IP”) address 24.12.126.231 filed a Motion to Quash or Modify an outstanding nonparty
subpoena issued by Plaintiff to an Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). (July 21, 2011 [hereinafter
Mot. to Quash #21], ECF No. 21.) Movant asks the Court to quash or modify this subpoena and
to sever Does 1–21 for misjoinder, arguing that joinder is improper (see id. passim), citing to
various court decisions from various jurisdictions in support of this argument (see id. at 2–5),
and accusing Plaintiff’s counsel of improper motives. (Id. at 1–2, 5.)
ARGUMENT
This brief consists of two parts: Part I argues that Movant’s misjoinder challenge is
premature at this stage of the litigation. Part II argues that neither Movant’s ad hominem attacks
on Plaintiff’s counsel nor his citations to unrelated authority provide a basis for quashing the
subpoena.
I.

MOVANT’S MISJOINDER CHALLENGE IS PREMATURE

Movant’s misjoinder challenge is premature at this early stage of the litigation. Movant
argues that by joining twenty-one Doe Defendants, Plaintiff has created a situation of misjoinder.
(See, e.g., Mot. to Quash #21 at 3–5.) However, federal courts considering motions on nearlyidentical facts, both within the Seventh Circuit and across the nation, have decided that
misjoinder challenges are premature at this stage in the litigation. E.g., Order 2, MCGIP, LLC v.

5,000, No. 10-0873, 2011 WL 1807438, at *4 (D.D.C. May 12, 2011)) (finding joinder “proper”
at early stage of litigation, even where movant’s assertion of misjoinder “may be meritorious”);
Donkeyball Movie, LLC v. Does 1–18, No. 10-1520, 2011 WL 1807452, at *4 (D.D.C. May 12,
2011) (same).
Movant would have the Court misinterpret Plaintiff’s pleadings as alleging that Doe
Defendants merely committed “the exact same type of violation in the same way” in order to
analogize this lawsuit to outdated authority based on fundamentally different P2P file-sharing
technologies. (Mot. to Quash #21 at 5–6.) Contradictorily, Movant suggests that Plaintiff’s
pleadings implicate Doe Defendants who “sometimes us[ed] different services.” (Id. at 6.) Even
a brief review of Plaintiff’s pleadings shows that these statements are patently incorrect. Plaintiff
not only alleged that all Doe Defendants used the same BitTorrent P2P technology, but in fact
alleged that all Doe Defendants infringed upon the same copyrighted Video, joined the torrent
swarm particular to Plaintiff’s Video to accomplish their illegal activities, and intentionally
engaged in concerted action with other Doe Defendants and third parties which amounted to a
civil conspiracy to infringe Plaintiff’s copyrighted Video. (See Compl. ¶¶ 3, 8, 23, 24, 33–37.)
For good reason, courts typically will not sever cases involving civil conspiracy allegations. See
In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, 393 F. Supp. 2d 854, 863 (C.D. Ill. 2003)
(Mihm, J.) (“[D]iligent research by both the parties and the Court has uncovered no case in
which a Rule 21 severance has been granted in a civil conspiracy case.”). Plaintiff’s allegations
thus go much further than Movant suggests.

Even setting aside Plaintiff’s civil conspiracy claim, for the sake of argument, severance
of the Doe Defendants still would not be justifiable. At this stage in the litigation, where
discovery is underway only to learn identifying facts necessary to permit service on Doe
Defendants, joinder is plainly proper. E.g., Kendall June 9 Decision, 2011 WL 2292958, at *2.
Plaintiff has alleged that the Doe Defendants have infringed Plaintiff’s copyrighted Video
through the same file-sharing protocol—BitTorrent—that operates through simultaneous and
sequential computer connections and data transfers among the users. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 8, 11, 13, 15,
23.) Such allegations have been held sufficient to sustain joinder while discovery of Doe
Defendants’ identities is underway. MCGIP, LLC, 2011 WL 2181620, at *4 (Chen, J.) (holding
such allegations were sufficient at same early stage of litigation and postponing joinder
discussion); Donkeyball, 2011 WL 1807452, at *4 (same); Voltage Pictures, 2011 WL 1807438,
at *4 (same); see also Call of the Wild Movie v. Does 1–1,062, No. 10-455, 2011 WL 996786, at
*4–5 (D.D.C. Mar. 22, 2011) (finding plaintiffs’ allegations that the Doe defendants used
BitTorrent, that BitTorrent “makes every downloader also an uploader,” and that any peer who
has completed a download “is automatically a source for the subsequent peer” were sufficient to
make claims against defendants “logically related”).
Discretionary concerns also weigh against severance at this stage of the litigation. The
discretionary joinder concerns—avoiding prejudice and delay, ensuring judicial economy, and
safeguarding principles of fundamental fairness—were thoroughly examined in a highly similar
context by Judge Howell of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Call of
the Wild Movie, 2011 WL 996786, at *4–7. “Joinder will avoid prejudice and needless delay for
the only party currently in the case, namely the plaintiff, and promote judicial economy.” Id. at
*4. Furthermore, “[t]he putative defendants are not prejudiced but likely benefited by joinder,
and severance would debilitate the plaintiffs’ efforts to protect their copyrighted materials and
seek redress . . . .” As Judge Howell reasoned, and as Plaintiff’s counsel has learned through
experience, severance would be especially contrary to the interests of any individuals who have
been named as Doe Defendants multiple times in the same suit for multiple observed instances of
3

Filed 08/03/11 Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 149

infringing activity, a possibility that is a consequence of the dynamic reassignment of many
consumer IP addresses:
[S]ome IP addresses may relate to the same person, who is
engaged in the allegedly infringing activity claimed by plaintiffs.
Severance of the putative defendants associated with different IP
addresses may subject the same Time Warner customer to multiple
suits for different instances of allegedly infringing activity and,
thus, would not be in the interests of the putative defendants.
Call of the Wild Movie, 2011 WL 996786, at *6. The same logic applies in this case, and thus all
discretionary factors weigh against severance at this stage of the litigation.
At a later point in this litigation, after Doe Defendants have been named and served, they
may raise joinder issues under Fed. R. Civ. P. 20, and move to sever under Fed. R. Civ. P. 21,
and that will be the appropriate time for the Court to evaluate the merits of such arguments. See
Lindberg July 26 Order 2 (“These arguments [including joinder] are premature . . . . The Does
may raise these issues when plaintiff has named them as defendants, if that action occurs.”);
Kendall June 9 Decision, 2011 WL 2292958, at *2 (“The putative defendants may re-raise the
issue of improper joinder should they become named defendants in this case.”); Donkeyball,
2011 WL 1807452, at *8; Voltage Pictures, 2011 WL 1807438, at *8; see also MCGIP, LLC,
2011 WL 2181620, at *1 (Chen, J.). The Court should deny the instant motion because Movant’s
joinder challenge is premature.
II.

NEITHER MOVANT’S AD HOMINEM ATTACKS ON PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL
NOR HIS CITATIONS TO UNRELATED AUTHORITY PROVIDE A BASIS FOR
QUASHING THE SUBPOENA
Movant accuses Plaintiff’s counsel of selecting an improper litigation strategy in order to

“avoid travel” and of “abuse of the litigation system.” (Mot. to Quash #21 at 2, 5.) The list of
permissible grounds for quashing or modifying a subpoena does not include ad hominem attacks.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3). Indeed, Movant offers only sweeping generalizations—and no
specific allegations—regarding the activities of Plaintiff’s counsel. (See generally Mot. to Quash
#21.)

4

Case 4:11-cv-00059-SEB-WGH Document 23

Filed 08/03/11 Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 150

Movant cites to various cases in support of his motion, arguing that they should be
considered “nearly identical” to the instant case. (Mot. to Quash #21 at 2–3.) However, Movant
makes little effort to establish the relevance of the cited cases. For example, where Movant cites
to cases involving Plaintiff’s counsel (see id.), Movant fails to establish the relevance of orders
made in factual and procedural contexts different from the instant motion. See, e.g., Mem. Op.
and Order, CP Prods., Inc. v. Does 1–300, No. 10-C-6255 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 24, 2011) (Shadur, J.)
(denying plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of the court’s Feb. 7, 2011 memorandum order,
which dismissed the action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) without prejudice), ECF No. 32. Movant
also fails to inform the Court that the cases he cites are unrepresentative of the many cases filed
by Plaintiff’s counsel in which courts nationwide have allowed the respective plaintiffs to
proceed with early discovery. See, e.g., Lindberg July 26 Order (denying anonymous motions to
quash or vacate subpoenas); Kendall June 9 Decision, 2011 WL 2292958 (denying anonymous
motions to quash, dismiss, and sever); MCGIP, 2011 WL 2181620, at *1 (Chen, J.) (denying
anonymous motion to quash); MCGIP v. Does 1–49, No. 11-1801, 2011 WL 1748461 (N.D. Cal.
April 22, 2011) (Fogel, J.). As Judge Chen of the Northern District of California wrote in
response to similar attacks on Plaintiff’s counsel, “the fact that Plaintiff has initiated other
lawsuits does not mean that this lawsuit (or even the others) is without any merit.” MCGIP, 2011
WL 2181620, at *1.
Further, Movant cites to various cases specifically to support his misjoinder challenge.
(See Mot. to Quash #21 at 3–5.) But Movant fails to distinguish between the present action—
where all alleged infringers used the BitTorrent protocol and exchanged pieces of the file with
one another as part of a civil conspiracy—and actions in which infringers were alleged to have
used older, less interconnected peer-to-peer file-sharing protocols. (See id.) Many courts
distinguish between these. See, e.g., Kendall June 9 Decision, 2011 WL 2292958, at *2
(“[G]iven the decentralized nature of BitTorrent’s file-sharing protocol . . . the Court finds that
sufficient facts have been plead to support the joinder of the putative defendants at this time.”);
Call of the Wild Movie, 2011 WL 996786, at *4–5 (considering contrary authority based on older
5

Filed 08/03/11 Page 6 of 7 PageID #: 151

file-sharing protocols and nevertheless finding that plaintiffs’ factual allegations about the
“nature of a BitTorrent protocol” were sufficient to make copyright infringement claims against
multiple defendants “logically related”). The Court should deny the instant motion because
Movant’s ad hominem attacks and his citations to unrelated authority are not bases for quashing
the subpoena.
CONCLUSION
The Court should deny Movant’s motion. Movant’s misjoinder arguments are premature
at this early stage of the litigation, and neither Movant’s ad hominem attacks on Plaintiff’s
counsel nor his citations to unrelated authority provide a basis for quashing the subpoena.
