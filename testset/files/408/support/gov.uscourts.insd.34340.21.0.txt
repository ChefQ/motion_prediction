MOTION TO QUASH OR MODIFY SUi}POENA FOR JOHN DOE 24.12.126.231

I received a letter from my ISP regyrding a subpoena, which included a copy of
the original complaint.

From accounts of previous defendants of Steele Hansmeier, these subpoena
notifications are followed by demand letters. These letters -- which demand around $2900 to
avoid dealing with their lawsuit -- and their pho' calls, which are persistent, are the reason I
am filing this motion, and for this reason, I resp: ctfully request that I be allowed to do so
without revealing my personally identifying information.

INTRO DUCTION
To cut court costs while suing as many individuals as poss iible, Plaintiff's counsel,

Steele Hansmeier is using improper joinders in their mass lawsuits alle;ing copyright

 

infringement through BitTorrent: These tawsuitsinciude over twenty-thousand-defendants in

the Northern District of Calfornia alone. Steele Hansmeier (Formerly Steele Law Firm, LLC)
Case 4:11-cv-00059-SEB-WGH Document 21 Filed 07/21/11 Page 2 of 6 PagelD #: 138

also has mass lawsuits in Illinois, including a BitTorrent case nearly identical to this one, CP

Productions, Inc. v. Does 1-300 case 1:2010cv06255, and in this case the court notes before

dismissal:

[I]f the 300 unnamed defendants have in fact infringed any copyrights (something

" that this court will assume to be the case, given the Complaint's allegations that so

state), each of those infringements was separate and apart from the others. No
predicate has been shown for thus combining 300 separate actions on the cheap -
if CP had sued the 300 claimed infringers separately for their discrete
infringements, the filing fees alone would have aggregated $105,000 rather than
$350.

Later, Judge Milton Shadur writes about Stecle Hansmeier's abuse of the litigation system "in
more than one way" with its "ill-considered" lav `suit: :

This Court has received still another motion by a "Doe" defendant to quash a
subpoena in this ill-considered \awsuit filed by CP Productions, Inc. ("CP")
against no fewer than 300 unidentified "Doe" defendants - this one seeking the
nullification of a February 11, 2011 subpoena issued to Comcast

Communications, LLC. This Court's February 24, 2011 memorandum opinion and
order has already sounded the death knell for this action, which has abused the
litigation system in more than one way. But because the aggrieved Doe defendants
continue to come out of the woodwork with motions to quash, indicating an
unawareness of this Court's dismissal of this action, 1 CP's counsel is ordered to
appear in court on March 9, 2011 at 9:00 a.m. Counsel will be expected to discuss
what steps should be taken to apprise all of the targeted "Doe" defendants that
they will not be subject to any further trouble or expense as-a result of this ill-
fated (as well as ill-considered) lawsuit.

CP Productions, Inc. v. Does 1-300 case 1:2010cv06255 (dismissed ALL John Doe defendants)

In the Northern District of California, these BitTorrent cases which are nearly

a

identical to the case at hand have also been s::vered for improper joinder:

Diabolic Video Productions, Ine v. Does 1-2099 case 5 :2010cv05865 (severed
Does 2-2099)
New Sensations, Inc v. Does 1-1 768 case 5:2010cv05864 {severed Does 2-1768)

And these nearly identical BitTorrent cases in the Northem District of California

by the plaintiff Boy Racer have also been severed for improper joinder:,,

ARGUMENT
1) Plaintiff Has Improperly Joined 21 Individual Defendants Based on Entirely Disparate

Alleged Acts

The Plaintiff's joinder of 21 defend=nts in this single action is improper and runs the
tremendous risk of creating unfairness and denying individual justice to those sued. Mass
joinder of individuals has been disapprovec by federal courts in boti the RIAA cases and
elsewhere. As one court noted:

Comcast subscriber John Doe 1 could be an innocent parent whose internet access
was abused by her minor child, while John Doe 2 might share a computer with a
roommate who infringed Plaintiffs' works. John Does 3 through 203 could be
thieves, just as Plaintiffs believe, inexcusably pilfering Plaintiffs' property and
depriving them, and their artists. of the royalties they are rightly owed. . . .
Wholesale litigation of these claims is inappropriate, at least with respect to a vast
majority (if not all) of Defendants.

BMG Music v. Does 1-203, No. Civ.A. 04-650, 2004 WL 953888, at *I (E.D. Pa. Apr. 2, 2004)

(severing lawsuit involving 203 defendants).

Rule 20 requires that, for parties to be joined. in the same lawsuit, the claims against them must

arise from a single transaction or a series of " `osely related transactiens. Specifically:

Persons . . . may be joined in one action a:. defendants if: (A) any right to relief is asserted
against them jointly, severally or in the alternative with respect to or erising out of the same
transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any question of law or
fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 20. Thus, multiple defendants may be joined in a single lz wsuit only when three

conditions are met:

 

~ (1) the right to relief must be "asserted against them jointly, severally or in the alternative"; (2)

the claim must "aris[e] out of the same tresaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
Case 4:11-cv-00059-SEB-WGH Document 21 Filed 07/21/11 Page 4 of 6 PagelD #: 140

y

occurrences"; and (3) there must be a common question of fact or lew common to all the
defendants. Jd.

Joinder based on separate but similar behavior by individuals allegedly using the
Internet to commit copyright infringement bus been rejected by courts across the country. In
LaFace Records, LLC v. Does 1-38, No. 5:07-CV-298-BR, 2008 WL 544992 (E.D.N.C. Feb.
27, 2008), the court ordered severance of I--vsuit against thirty-eight defendants where each
defendant used the same ISP as well as some of the same peet-to-pe.r ("P2P") networks to
commit the exact same violation of the law in exactly the same way. The court explained:
"{Mlerely committing the same type of vio'ation in the same way docs not link defendants
together for purposes of joinder." LaFace Rcords, 2008 WL 544992, at *2. In BMG Music v.
Does 1-4, No. 3:06-cv-01579-MHP, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53237, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. July 31,
2006), the court sua sponte severed multiple defendants in action where. the only connection
between them was allegation they used same ISP to conduct copyright infringement. See also

four lawsuits against a total of 254 defendants accused of unauthorize1 music file-sharing);
Order Granting in Part and Denying in Par! Plaintiffs' Miscellaneous Acministrative Request
for-Leave to Take Discovery Prior to Rule 26 Conference, Twentieth Cestury Fox Film Corp.,

action against twelve defendants, permitting discovery as to first Doe dsfendant but staying
case as to remaining Does until plaintiff cou!:. Jemonstrate proper joinder).

Plaintiff may argue that, unlike the R: AA cases, its allegations 1 bre are based upon use
of the Internet to infringe a single work. Vile that accurately descriles the facts alleged in
this case, it does not change the legal analysis. Whether the alleged ir fringement concerns a
single copyrighted work or many, it was committed by unrelated defend ants, at different times
and locations, sometimes using different se: vices, and perhaps subject ` different defenses.
That attenuated relationship is not sufficient :r joinder. See BMG Music v. Does 1-203, 2004
WL 953888, at *1. |

Nor does the analysis change becau::: the BitTorrent protocol works by taking small
fragments of a work from multiple people in order to assemble a copy. The individual
Defendants still have no knowledge of each ciner, nor do they control how the protocol works,
and Plaintiff has made no allegation that ans: copy of the work they downloaded came jointly
from any of the Doe defendants. Joining ..nrelated defendants in one lawsuit may make
litigation less expensive for Plaintiff by enabling it to avoid the separate ling fees required for
individual cases and by enabling its counsel `" avoid travel, but that does not mean these well-

established joinder principles aeed not be followed here.
