INTERVENORS' REPLY TO MOTION FOR ARREST, TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND FOR DELAY

On June 7, 2004, Plaintiff filed its complaint to seek salvage rights over a purported
wrecked vessel in northern Lake Michigan. The complaint did not satisfy Fed R Civ P, Supp
Rule C(2)(b) or Rule E(2). A complaint in rem must describe the property that is the subject of
the action. Arrest of a defendant depends upon whether the complaint shows the conditions for
an in rem action in the subject property or subject vessel. The complaint must provide
particularity sufficient to allow a claimant to investigate the facts and frame a responsive
pleading. (Docket 5), Given the defects in the complaint, the court declined to issue any warrant
for arrest of any in rem defendant

Thereafter, Intervenors filed their limited appearance to challenge whether the court can
exercise in rem jurisdiction over any of the property referenced in Plaintiff's Amended
Complaint. In reply to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff disavowed any claim that the wreck is
abandoned sufficient to support a claim to the wrecked vessel itself under the law of finds. As
stated in the Motion to Dismiss, if Plaintiff asserted abandonment of the vessel, without limiting
that abandonment to "salvage-right purposes," the complaint would provoke operation of the
Abandoned Shipwreck Act (ASA), 43 USC 2101, et seq., and acknowledge the State's title.
(Docket 16, pp 5-9). |

Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint is still silent concerning the condition and
location of any artifacts that make up the alleged wreck. Plaintiff still has not shown, and, based
upon the evidence so far before the court, cannot show, that it has accomplished any successful,
legal salvage that could authorize an in rem action against any salvaged property or support any

claim to the status of salvor-in-possession authorizing exclusive access to a wreck site.
Intervenors have submitted evidence that the single artifact that Plaintiff has
acknowledged as part of the wreck so far is in place and not yet salvaged and embedded in the
soil of Michigan. (Docket 15, Lusardi Affidavit). If the wreck is embedded, Plaintiff cannot be
a legal salvor by virtue of Michigan's regulatory provisions, which require a permit to dredge the
bottomlands. MCL 324 .32512.

If the wreck is embedded in Michigan soil, it is protected from admiralty jurisdiction by
the 11" Amendment, whether or not shown to have been abandoned, unless the original owner is
before the court because it is in Michigan soil and in the State's possession. Congress asserted
ownership of abandoned vessels within state bottomlands and transferred their title to the States.
If the wreck is embedded and was abandoned,' it belongs to Michigan by operation of the ASA,
43 USC 1205," unless reserved by the State and already the State's property, so that the ASA
does not operate. 43 USC 1205(C)) Where an ancient vessel whose location has been lost for
centuties is embedded in state soil, it is in the actual possession of the State, and the common law
of finds recognizes ownership of the vessel, not in the finder but in the owner of the lands:
"When personalty is found embedded in land, however, title to that personalty rests with the

owner of the land." Chance v Certain Artifacts Found and Salvaged from the Nashville, 606 F

 

`Plaintiff says that it only asserts that its find is abandoned for salvage purposes, despite its
persisting Petitory/Possessoy and/or Ownership claims, and its request for arrest of the wreck
rather than its salvage.

The act provides, in part: "The United States asserts title to any abandoned shipwreck that is (1)
embedded in submerged lands of a state." 43 USC 2105. California v Deep Sea Research, Inc,
523 US 491, 497; 118 S Ct 1464; 140 L Ed2d 626 (1998), involved a claim to a vessel under the
law of finds and presented only the question of jurisdiction over the Brother Jonathan under the
ASA. The State claimed, on one hand, that the vessel was embedded in its lands but stipulated,
on the other, that the ship was only upon state Bottomlands. Given the reliance upon the ASA,
the state's claimed title could only be activated upon showing of abandonment, as the court
ultimately determined. The state made no claim the vessel in its bottomlands in the absence of a
showing of abandonment, even though Congress made no claim under the ASA to vessels
already held by the states.
Supp 801, 805 (SD Ga 1984). The ownership of the personalty does not depend upon knowledge
of its location. Id., p 805 Michigan acquired its bottomlands and all contained within them at
time of statehood. It possesses the property within its soil, whoever it may have originally
belonged to, and that property belongs to Michigan, by operation of law. Accordingly, the
location and condition of the wreck must be disclosed before conditions for an in rem action can
appear, and before any arrest occurs.

The court has repeatedly ordered such disclosure. On July 13, 2005, this court issued a
protective order to prevent information containing the precise location of the Defendant, and
filed under seal, from being disseminated to any third parties, "In consideration of the Plaintiff
and the Intervenors' interest in avoiding unnecessary disclosure of the location of archaeological
sites, and in view of the Court's obligation to identify the subject of this action and to determine
its jurisdiction." (Docket 44, "Order Concerning Documents filed under Seal," p 1).

This court's August 21, 2006 Order (Docket 103), requires Plaintiff to disclose, by
August 31, the locations of any known artifacts it claims to be part of the wreck, so that their
condition can be determined Faced with the prospect of dismissal if it does not disclose such
locations, Plaintiff now requests arrest of the vessel and an injunction to prevent the Intervenors
from using the information to claim actual possession of the wreck or to do anything but pursue
this action. None of these requests is appropriate. Neither is the requested delay.

1 In light of the showing already made by Intervenors, arrest of any

defendant is improper until Plaintiff shows jurisdiction over some
recognized object(s) in which it has a lawful salvage lien.

 

? As the court is aware, the order issued after both parties had filed responses to its order to show
cause. The Intervenor's filing was served electronically upon both of Plaintiff's attorneys and by
mail upon Mr. DeBoer, on August 3, 2006, as disclosed by Docket Entry 99).

In this in rem action, it is important to consider the subject over which the court may
exercise jurisdiction by arrest. Although Plaintiff does not claim this action arises under the law
of finds and represents that it proceeds under the law of salvage, it urges arrest of the vessel or
the wreck, as though it possesses the wreck under the law of finds, and presents nothing that it
has rescued over which it can state a lien. Michigan has presented evidence that the wreck, so
far as it is known, is embedded in Michigan's soil and is under Michigan's control by laws
preventing its removal without permit. MCL 324.82512; MCL 324 76106 and MCL 324.76107.

The request for arrest must be rejected by the terms of Rule (C)(1 (a), (C)(2)(b) and
C(3){a)Gi)(A). The complaint does not allow claimants to commence an investigation of the
tacts covering the wreck and frame a responsive pleading, except by speculation, contrary to
Rule (E)(2)(a), and it makes no showing of the conditions for an in rem action, such as a lawful
lien and identifiable property. Given the location of the artifact so far disclosed within Michigan
bottomlands, Chance v Certain Artifacts and Salvaged items from the Northville, 606 F Supp
801,806-807 (SD Ga 1984), if that artifact is associated with a vessel that was abandoned, the
court lacks admiralty jurisdiction by operation of the ASA, and if it was not, the court lacks
admiralty jurisdiction by operation of the common law, Klein v The Unidentified, Wrecked and
Abandoned Sailing Vessel, 758 F2d 1511, 1514 (1 1" Cir 1985), and because the object is
possessed by Michigan. In either case, if the subject is embedded in Michigan soil, the court
cannot exercise jurisdiction over the wreck because it belongs to the state and is not subject to
Federal court jurisdiction under the 11" amendment. Jn Re New York, 256 US 490; 41 S Ct 588;
65 Led 1057 (1926).

Neither can Plaintiff show a lawful lien in an item removed from the bottomlands, given

the limitations of MCL 324 .32512(c) and R 322 101(h) and the lack of any permit to remove
anything from Michigan bottomland. There has been no legal salvage, and Plaintiff does not
identify any rescued item in which it may have a lien Lathrop v the Unidentified, Wrecked and
Abandoned Vessel, 807 F Supp 953, 963 (MD Fla, 1993) (Docket 76) The conditions for in rem
jurisdiction do not yet appear.

Fathom Exploration LLC v The Unidentified Shipwrecked Vessel or Vessels, 352 F
Supp2d 1218 (SD Ala, 2005), does not counsel arrest where the wreck cannot be located or
specified and when conditions for an in rem action are not presented in the complaint. Although
the complaint in that action did not name the vessel(s) that the Plaintiff claimed, that defect was |
not fatal. Plaintiff asserted salvage of specific recovered artifacts, the lack of any owner(s),
matine peril, necessity of rescue, and it provided a general location. The Plaintiff claimed title to
the vessels under the law of finds and a salvage interest based upon its rescue(s). It sought an
injunction against tival salvors within a geographic area. Based upon its initial review of the
allegations under the law of finds, the court considered the wreck the subject of in rem
jurisdiction, and authorized arrest, with the Plaintiff as substitute custodian. The Plaintiff never
returned service on the shipwreck, making the case curious authority for the proposition that a
court should acquire immediate jurisdiction over any shipwreck, before evaluating third party
challenges to the adequacy of the complaint or the presence of admiralty jurisdiction. 352 F
Supp 2d 122], n 2.

After authorization for arrest, state and federal claimants become aware of Fathom
Exploration's claim and they asserted the insufficiency of the complaint to show jurisdiction and
support arrest.

As noted in Fathom Exploration, 352 F Supp 2d at 1223, although it is common practice,

no known cases have actually addressed the propriety of allowing in rem actions against
unidentified wrecked vessels in light of the particularity requirements of the Supplementary
Rules, The deficiency of this practice is not cured by naming the wreck, since that alone does
not make out a claim of lien in un-recovered artifacts in place, particularly where, as here, the
plaintiff disavows any claim that the vessel was abandoned and so abandons any claim to the
vessel itself under the law of finds, but can only claim an in rem action against objects recovered
and seek the status of salvor in possession. See, Yukon Recovery, LLC v Certain Abandoned
Property, in rem, 205 F3f 1189, 1195 (9 Cir 2000) (Docket 77, p 10). There is no separate,
exclusive right to appropriate the value of a find in place. RMS Titanic v The Wrecked and
Abandoned Vessel, 286 F3d 194, 205 (4" Cir 2002).

Indeed, Fathom Exploration did discuss and reject the proposition that a claimant must
identify and name a vessel to establish jurisdiction. Plaintiff quotes that discussion out of
context, as thought it rejects the proposition that an arrest cannot occur before disclosing what is
known about a wreck, as necessary to show jurisdiction (Docket 104, p 6). The case hardly
serves as authority for the proposition that faced with a complaint that fails to demonstrate
jurisdiction and with evidence that the alleged wreck in place is in the actual possession of the
State, a court should issue a warrant for un-rescued property, and effectively enjoin State
enforcement of laws that regulate recovery as a penalty for obtaining the information that shows
admiralty jurisdiction, if it does. The request for arrest must be rejected until there is indication
that there is some subject over whom the court may exercise admiralty jurisdiction.

In RMS Titanic, Inc v The Wrecked and Abandoned RMS Titanic, 171 F3d 943, 964 (4"
Cir 1999), the court spoke of a lien in a wreck, but in RME Titanic, Inc v The Wrecked and
Abandoned Vessel, 286 F3d 194, 205-206 (40x2122 Cir 2002), it clarified that the salvage lien is in the

artifacts recovered, which may be accompanied with a right to exclusive salvage, but "discovery
alone does not amount to salvage service, although it can lead to salvage service," and there is
"no lien in property that it mercly discovered." These cases do not support the proposition that
in rem jurisdiction can or should be asserted before the jurisdictional fact of recovery showing a
lien. Since those cases involved the open ocean, they did not provide any occasion to evaluate
the significance of'a state's claim that the objects recovered belonged to the state or that the
shipwreck in place was in the actual possession of the state embedded in its soil.

2. Injunctive relief is inappropriate in this in rem action.

As noted, Plaintiff requests not only arrest but also an injunction against the state of
Michigan to prevent it "at the very outset," from using information, acquired by "substantial
time, money and effort," concerning the location of artifacts believed to be associated with the
shipwreck "to defeat federal jurisdiction " That is, Plaintiff asks the court to protect its
knowledge of conditions concerning the jurisdiction of the court from being used in a motion
under FR Civ P 12(b)(1) or 56. The court has already commented upon the fact that this makes a
mockery of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The present request for injunctive relief, like the amended protective order Plaintiff
proposed earlier (Docket 45), is overly broad. It would secure an exclusive proprietary right to
obtain information concerning a find and would prevent Michigan from enforcing, against
Plaintiff or any other person, the laws by which it secures its bottomlands and protects its
cultural heritage. If Michigan ever uses information about the find to obtain information for
school textbooks or to require Plaintiff to obtain permits before dredging its bottomlands--it
would violate the injunction. There are no such exclusive rights to investigate. But, neither can
an admiralty court with in rem jurisdiction award such an injunction against a State that has

appeared for a limited purpose under a restricted appearance.
a) The court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against
the state of Michigan in this action.

The Court has entered a protective order (Docket 44) controlling dissemination of
material filed under seal disclosing the location of the subject wreck, and it has already rejected
Plaintiff's request (Docket 45) that the court's Protective Order be amended to provide that any
material designated as confidential be "used solely for purposes of this proceeding." (Docket
45), What was a request for an overly broad protective order is now presented as a request for
injunctive relief to permit "meaningfully review on appeal." (Docket 104, p 8). Asa result, it is
appropriate to point out that the court lacks jurisdiction to issue such affirmative injunctive relief
again the state in this in rem action.

A court must have personal jurisdiction over a party against whom equitable relief is
sought Lathrop v Unidentified, Wrecked and Abandoned Vessel, 817 F Supp 953, 961 (MD Fila,
1993). The Intervenors are present here pursuant to a restricted appearance, as authorized by
Rule E(8), to file their motion to dismiss and to defend the state's interest in and jurisdiction over
its bottomlands and maritime cultural heritage (Docket 9).

According to the Advisory Committee Notes, Rule E(8) authorizes restricted appearances
to protect a claimant from having to subject himself personally to the jurisdiction of the court for
claims for which process is not available. The court does not have personal jurisdiction over
Michigan in this case to enjoin it from enforcing its laws. Plaintiff cannot use this limited
appearance to obtain an order that it could not otherwise obtain. Neither does it have a
proprietary right to avoid or to prevent compliance with state law that the court can protect.
Plaintiff must disclose its information to the court only if it seeks to show the court's jurisdiction,

as this court has ruled.
b) The harm Plaintiff represents it will suffer without an
injunction is fictional.

Plaintiff represents that it is necessary for the court to prevent Michigan from using the
information "to take, or attempt to take actual possession of the shipwreck."

The persisting misrepresentation that Michigan might use the information disclosed to
assert actual possession is puzzling.' Michigan already claims actual possession of the wreck
insofar as it is actually contained in its bottomlands, protected from removal by Michigan law It
so claimed in its original motion to dismiss (Docket 16). Information will not change the
location of the wreck.

The persistent expression of anxiety that Michigan will assert actual possession appears
related to cases that specify how a finder must sustain actual physical possession of a wreck in
order to avoid the claims of tival salvors or finders under the law of finds. See, Hener v United
States, 525 F Supp 350 (SD NY 1981). The position appears to posit Intervenors as potential
competing claimants to the vessel, whose claim depends upon hovering over the site. Rather,
Michigan's physical relation to the wreck arises from its ownership of the soil in which the
wreck is embedded, and it has police powers regulations by which to control its removal. See,

Hener, 525 F Supp at 354. No similar claim arises in open ocean cases such as the SS Central

 

* Plaintiff's misstatement of Michigan's position began in its first reply to Intervenors, Docket 20,
p2, "By Intervenors' own admission, Michigan lacks such actual possession." The reference
there is to the sort of possession implied by reason of ownership under circumstances favorable
to implication of possession. Michigan's claim is the converse, it is the actual possession of the
wreck artifacts within the state's soils that gives rise to implication of ownership with title
superior to that of all but the original owner, the sort of owner whose successor was the claimant
in Fairport International Exploration, Inc v The Shipwrecked Vessel, known as the Captain
Lawrence, 177 F3d 491 (6" Cir 1999).
