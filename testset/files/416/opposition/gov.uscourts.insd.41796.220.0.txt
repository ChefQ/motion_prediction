LEGAL STANDARD
A.

FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 16(b)(4)

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(4) provides that "[a] schedule may be modified
only for good cause and with the judge’s consent.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4); See United Consumers
Club, Inc. v. Prime Time Marketing, 2009 WL 3200540, *7 (N.D Ind. Sep. 25, 2009). S.D. Ind.
L.R. 16-1(e) states that “[a]bsent court order, deadlines established in any order or pretrial entry
under this rule may not be altered unless the parties and the court agree, or for good cause
shown.” S.D. Ind. 16-1(e). Rule 16(b)(4) “requires a court to modify a CMP upon a showing of
	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 1533
	  

‘good cause.’” See Hollis v. Defender Security Company, No. 1:09-cv-01178-WTL-JMS (S.D.
Ind. March 19, 2010). The Southern District of Indiana considers the diligence of the party
seeking the modification and whether the nonmoving party will be prejudiced by the
modification.” See Id. (citing Trustmark Ins. Co. v. General & Cologne Life Re of Am., 424 F.3d
542, 553 (7th Cir. 2005); Kortum v. Raffles Holdings, Ltd., 2002 Dist. LEXIS 21252, at *17
(N.D. Ill. 2002) (“Rule 16 can and does consider prejudice as part of its good cause analysis.”));
See Community Bank v. Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, No. 1:08-cv-01443-WTLJMS (S.D. Ind. Jan. 28, 2010) (“When considering possible good cause to amend a case
management plan, courts look to both the diligence of the party seeking to amend the plan and to
the potential prejudice to the opposing party.”). “Courts have a legitimate interest in ensuring
that the parties follow scheduling orders in order to ensure prompt and orderly litigation.” United
States v. 1948 South Martin Luther King, Dr., 270 F.3d 1102, 1110 (7th Cir. 2001).
B.

DISCOVERY DEPOSITIONS AND DEPOSITIONS DE BENE ESSE

“Because discovery is conducted for the purpose of gathering new information, some
courts have drawn a distinction between depositions taken during the course of discovery, with
the goal of ascertaining new information, and trial depositions taken to preserve information that
the party already has knowledge of, but would otherwise be unavailable.” Stuhlmacher v. The
Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. and Tricam Industries, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-00467-APR (N.D. Ind. March
4, 2014) (citing Spangler v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 138 F.R.D. 122, 124-25 (S.D.Ind. 1991)).
A deposition de bene esse “is a fancy way of saying that the deposition will be ‘taken from a
witness who will likely be unable to attend a scheduled trial.’” See The Estate of Terry Gee Jr. v.
Bloomington Hospital and Health Care System, Inc., No. 1:06-cv-00094-TWP-TAB (S.D. Ind.
March 6, 2012) (“[The Southern District of Indiana has previously recognized the practical

-2-	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 1534
	  

distinction between trial depositions and discovery depositions. As then District Judge Tinder
recognized, ‘[a]lthough the Federal rules of Civil Procedure do not clearly differentiate, this
distinction is generally recognized by the courts in this judicial district.”) (citing Spangler at
124).
“Accordingly, ‘[w]hile discovery is closed under the terms of [the] court’s scheduling
order, that order does not prevent a party from memorializing a witness’ testimony in order to
offer it at trial.’” Id. “[T]he Court’s task is to determine whether this deposition is actually being
taken to preserve trial testimony, or if that is merely an after-the-fact excuse to take a belated
discovery deposition.” Id. “[T]he Court should consider a variety of factors in making this
determination, including the unavailability of the witness for trial, the potential for prejudice to
the opposing parting, and whether the deposing party knew the information the potential witness
would testify to prior to the deposition.” Id. (citing Bamcor LLC v. Jupiter Aluminum Corp.,
2010 WL 4955545, at *1 (N.D. Ind. Nov. 29, 2010)).
In McDermott v. Liberty Maritime Corp., the court denied de bene esse depositions,
because the necessity to take the depositions did not result from the need to preserve testimony
the witnesses would otherwise have given at trial “based on unforeseen events arising after the
close of discovery,” and the deposing party had sufficient notice the witnesses were unavailable
for trial purposes. 2011 WL 2650200, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. July 6, 2011).

FACTS AND ARGUMENT
A.

HARRISON’S DEPOSITION TESTIMONY

On July 25, 2013, Harrison made his Rule 26(a) initial disclosures.
disclosures included:
(i)

Harrison’s two (2) computer hard drives on one (1) external hard drive;

-3-	  

Harrison’s

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 1535
	  

(ii)

Harrison’s employee time sheet for the week of the alleged hit date on Exhibit A
of Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint [Dkt. 59-1]; and,

(iii)

Harrison’s January 26, 2013 Amazon.com receipt showing the billing and
shipping addresses for a new 128GB Solid State Drive (“SSD”), and the name
and contact information for the individual who purchased the SSD.

Harrison supplemented his initial disclosures on December 23, 2013 and provided Malibu
with a copy of his X-Box gaming console files.
On August 7, 2014, 22 days before the deadline to complete discovery, Malibu finally
deposed Harrison and learned that the 128GB SSD shipped to Harrison on January 26, 2013 is
the hard drive for Harrison’s SAMMY computer (“Sammy”). During Harrison’s deposition, he
provided the names and telephone numbers of several individuals Malibu claims in its instant
motion, “may also have relevant information regarding Defendant’s destruction of evidence.”
Twenty-eight (28) days have elapsed since Harrison provided the contact information for these
individuals. Malibu has not attempted to communicate with any of them. Moreover, Malibu has
known the name, address, and telephone number of the individual who actually purchased the
128GB SSD since July 25, 2013. Malibu has attempted to contact this individual zero (0) times
since July 25, 2013.
It is worth noting that a year earlier, on August 13, 2013, Malibu’s computer forensic
examiner, Patrick Paige (“Paige”), completed his examination and forensic report regarding
Harrison’s computer hard drives. Despite the fact that Paige’s August 13, 2013 Forensic
Summary Report clearly indicates that Windows 7 Home Premium was installed on Sammy on
February 6, 2013, and that Malibu has had Harrison’s January 26, 2013 Amazon receipt for the
128GB SSD since July 25, 2013, neither Paige’s Forensic Summary Report nor his March 14,
2014 declaration state any opinions whatsoever regarding Sammy.

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 1536
	  

Malibu has not been diligent in conducting discovery in a timely manner in order to meet
the August 29, 2014 deadline for completing discovery.
B.

PLAINTIFF’S FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT

On March 7, 2014, the Court granted Malibu’s Motion for Leave to Amend the Third
Amended Complaint, and the Clerk filed Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Complaint and attached
exhibits on March 7, 2014. See Dkts. 164, 165.
In every case, Malibu files a Motion for Leave to Serve Third Party Subpoenas Prior to
Rule 26(f) Conference after filing its complaint. Malibu then conducts discovery prior to the
time permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and subpoenas Internet Service Providers
(“ISPs”) to learn the identities of Internet account holders associated with alleged infringing IP
addresses. The ISPs respond to Malibu’s discovery requests and provide Malibu with the names,
addresses, and telephone numbers of Internet account holders associated with the IP addresses
and specific hit dates and times identified by Malibu in its subpoenas to the ISPs. Malibu
conducts discovery prior to the time permitted by the Federal Rules in order to obtain the
identities of Internet account holders and proceed with its copyright infringement claims against
named or anonymous defendants.
Malibu’s early discovery requests and the ISP discovery responses serve a second
purpose. ISP responses provide the following critical pieces of evidence:
(i)

That an IP address given to Malibu by IPP International U.G. (“IPP Int. UG”)
actually exists, or existed, in the records of an ISP;

(ii)

That the ISP assigned the IP address to an Internet account holder during the
period of the alleged infringement; and,

-5-	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 1537
	  

(iii)

That the IP address the ISP assigned to the Internet account holder matches the
specific hit date and time, movie file hash, and IP address connected with the
alleged infringement(s) pled by Malibu in its complaint.

Without the above-mentioned subpoena responses from an ISP, Malibu has a case that is “dead
in the water.”
Malibu’s Fourth Amended Complaint added five additional counts of direct copyright
infringement against Michael Harrison. See Dkt. 165-1. Malibu’s Fourth Amended Complaint
contains a hit date and time for the movie, “Pretty Back Door Baby,” that is different from the hit
date and time for “Pretty Back Door Baby” contained in Exhibit A of Malibu’s Third Amended
Complaint. Cf. Dkts. 59-1 and 165-1 (The Third Amended Complaint’s hit date is July 30, 2012
at 20:14 (UTC) and the Fourth Amended Complaint’s hit date is September 9, 2012 at 20:33:43
(UTC)).
Comcast’s Subpoena Response to Malibu’s August 27, 2012 Subpoena to Comcast is for
an inoperative (third amended) complaint.

Since March 7, 2014, the date the Clerk filed

Malibu’s Fourth Amended Complaint, Malibu has failed to issue a discovery request to Comcast
seeking the identity of the subscriber assigned IP address 98.220.43.119 based on any one of the
six (6) specific hit dates contained in Exhibit A of its Fourth Amended Complaint. In other
words, Malibu failed to obtain any evidence whatsoever supporting the allegations of its
operative complaint and cannot show, via Comcast, that Harrison was ever assigned IP address
98.220.43.119 at any time from September 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012. See Dkt. 165-1.
Based on Malibu’s Motion for the Entry of An Order Authorizing Comcast to Comply
With a Third Party Subpoena (“Comcast Motion”), it still is not clear if Malibu is aware of its
mistake. Even if Malibu is aware of its mistake, it is still undisputed that Malibu sat on its hands

-6-	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 1538
	  

for six months and failed to meet the August 29, 2014 deadline for completing discovery when
Malibu could have easily met the deadline.
C.

MALIBU’S COMCAST MOTION

Malibu’s Comcast Motion states that its subpoena to Comcast:
[W]ill be limited to documents and Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6) deposition topics that refer or
relate to: (a) Plaintiff’s ability to lay the foundation for the introduction of the correlation
of IP Address to subscriber for purposes of use at trial (i.e., laying the foundation that the
correlating documents produced by the ISPs are business records); (b) Information about
the reliability of the ISP’s correlating technique; (c) DMCA notices and if applicable six
strike notices sent to the Defendant; (d) Defendant’s Bandwidth usage; (e) The number of
Comcast internet subscribers in Indiana in July 2012; (f) The ratio of IP addresses to
internet subscribers as of July 2012. See Dkt. 216 at 2, ¶ 5.
Malibu calls Comcast’s deposition correlation testimony “outcome dispositive,” and
states, “if Plaintiff cannot introduce the correlating evidence into trial then Plaintiff will lose this
case.” See Dkt. 197 at 2 ¶ 5. These are very strange statements. If Malibu does not have a
subpoena response from Comcast connecting the Fourth Amended Complaint’s hit dates and IP
address with Harrison’s Comcast account, then Comcast cannot provide any testimony about its
correlation of the IP address to the subscriber or about the reliability of its correlating technique
– because, again, Comcast has not correlated the Fourth Amended Complaint’s hit dates and IP
address to a Comcast subscriber.
Malibu had six (6) months to issue a third party subpoena to Comcast regarding the six
hit dates and times for IP address 98.220.43.119 as contained in Exhibit A of Malibu’s Fourth
Amended Complaint, but failed to do so. Comcast’s subpoena response may have revealed that
Harrison was not assigned IP address 98.220.43.119 at any time from September 1, 2012 to
September 30, 2012; it may have revealed that he was. Either way, Malibu failed to conduct
discovery for six months in this case that it knew with certainty since April 23, 2014 would be
necessary in its case against Michael Harrison.

D.

MALIBU’S COMCAST EMAILS

In an email dated April 23, 2014, Malibu’s General Counsel, Keith Lipscomb (“Mr.
Lipscomb”), informs John Seiver (“Mr. Seiver”), Counsel for Comcast, that “Malibu Media v.
Harrison, 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD (S.D. In. [sic]),” is a case where “additional documents and
Comcast deposition may be necessary.”1 See Exhibit A. Mr. Lipscomb writes, “Below is a
summary of the three cases where Malibu may need to depose Comcast. We will need additional
paper discovery in these cases re: DMCA notices and bandwidth usage.” See Ex. A. Mr.
Lipscomb continues, “[W]hile these cases are at the stage where I need to protect Malibu by
ensuring that Comcast’s testimony will come into evidence at trial, I still think there is a very
good chance that these cases will settle or get adjudged prior to trial… I will still need a
declaration attesting to the accuracy and reliability of the correlation (as well as the
additional facts re: DMCA notice bandwidth, etc. if applicable for purposes of summary
judgment. If that is that route we go down, I will prepare a proposed draft quoting from
the last deposition when it comes time.” See Ex. A (emphasis mine).
The reason that Malibu delayed its additional Comcast discovery is readily apparent.
Malibu does not want to burden Comcast unless it is absolutely necessary. Comcast already has
to comply with a large number of Malibu’s “early discovery” subpoenas, and if Comcast is
required to devote further manpower to Malibu’s cases by complying with subpoenas duces
tecum and providing deposition testimony, Malibu’s relationship with Comcast may take a turn
for the worse.

Malibu depends on Comcast to keep giving Malibu the names of alleged

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1

Mr. Lipscomb’s emails repeatedly use the words “we” and “our.” In other emails, after Mr.
Seiver tells Mr. Lipscomb, “I thought Nicoletti takes his orders from you,” Lipscomb states,
“Nicoletti is lead counsel in that case. I just assist with it. Ultimately, he is responsible for that
case. Significantly, I am not admitted in his states.” See Exhibit B. Lipscomb’s emails display a
distinctly familiar writing style that leads Harrison to question what Mr. Lipscomb means by “I
just assist with it.”
-8-	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 1540
	  

infringers, and Malibu’s need to maintain a smooth relationship with Comcast does not excuse
Malibu’s lack of diligence in taking steps to obtain additional discovery from Comcast in a
timely manner. Mr. Lipscomb’s email is a strong indicator that Malibu has not been diligent in
meeting this case’s deadline for completing discovery because Malibu actually knew since April
23, 2014 that further discovery from Comcast would be necessary.
Moreover, Malibu already knows what Comcast’s deposition testimony will be should
Malibu be permitted to depose Comcast.

Malibu’s argument that “neither Plaintiff nor

Defendant knows what relevant information will be revealed at Comcast’s [or Malibu’s]
deposition” is ridiculous. See Dkt. 216 at 3, ¶ 10. Malibu is attempting to disguise what
resembles a deposition de bene esse as a discovery deposition. Malibu would not be permitted to
conduct a deposition de bene esse of Comcast because Comcast would be available to testify at
trial. Malibu frames the potential Comcast deposition as a discovery deposition because it is
Malibu’s only possible out in this situation. Malibu is basically asking the Court to put a BandAid on Malibu’s self-inflicted boo-boo. This Court should decline Malibu’s request.
D.

THE PARTIES AGREED AND THE COURT APPROVED AND ORDERED THE
CURRENT CASE MANAGEMENT PLAN

On April 14, 2014, “[a]t the conclusion of the settlement conference, the parties discussed
a Case Management Order,” which was approved by the parties and entered by separate order on
April 15, 2014. See Dkt. 175, 176 (“Discovery due by 8/29/2014. Dispositive Motions due by
9/19/2014.”).
On April 14, 2014, Counsel for Harrison and Counsel for Malibu participated with Judge
Mark J. Dinsmore in establishing the deadlines in the current Case Management Plan. Counsel
for both parties agreed to the plan and the Court approved and ordered it. Since that time,
Harrison has strived to meet the deadlines set forth in the Case Management Plan with the
-9-	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 1541
	  

expectation that both parties would honor the deadlines in order to resolve this case in a cost and
time efficient manner. This Court should deny Malibu’s motion to extend the deadline for
completing discovery because an extension of the discovery deadline will prejudice Harrison.
E.

MODIFICATION OF THE DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING DISCOVERY WILL
PREJUDICE HARRISON AND WILL LIKELY REQUIRE MODIFICATION OF THE
DISPOSITIVE MOTIONS DEADLINE

On August 18, 2014, Harrison filed his Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s
Expert Witnesses. See Dkt. 213. As Counsel for Malibu states in his Motion for Extension of
Time to Respond to Defendant’s Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Expert
Witnesses, Harrison’s motion and supporting brief are over thirty-two (32) pages long with over
fifty (50) pages of exhibits. See Dkt. 219 at 1, ¶ 2. A great amount of time and expense went
into Harrison’s motion. It required numerous hours researching case law and drafting the motion
and supporting brief. Nevertheless, Harrison’s motion was filed before the September 19, 2014
deadline for filing such motions according to the Case Management Order. See Dkt. 175 at 1, ¶
C. Harrison filed his critical motion with the expectation that his reply brief would present a
case theory cohesive with his motion for summary judgment expected by the Court and required
to be filed by September 19, 2014. See Dkt. 175 at 2, ¶ B.
Now, in addition to its request to enlarge the time for completing discovery by 90 days,
Malibu is requesting a two-week extension of time to respond to Harrison’s Motion to Exclude
the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Expert Witnesses because “the issues raised by Defendant have not
been raised in any previous Malibu Media lawsuit so Plaintiff will need to conduct extensive research
and compose a thoughtful response.” See Dkt. 219 at 1, ¶ 2.
Malibu’s motion to enlarge the time for completing discovery and for an extension of time to
respond to Harrison’s Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Expert Witnesses present a
total picture that says Malibu is not prepared for summary judgment.
-10-	  

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 220 Filed 09/04/14 Page 11 of 12 PageID #: 1542
	  

If the Court grants Malibu’s instant motion, it will either require Harrison to file amended
motions for summary judgment or require the Court to modify the summary judgment deadline. This
will prejudice Harrison because he will incur additional costs preparing amended motions for
summary judgment, or it will render his Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Expert
Witnesses ineffectual. Harrison argued in his Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s Expert
Witnesses that he has and will continue to suffer prejudice as a result of Malibu and Patrick Paige’s
failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B). Extension of the discovery
deadline and the September 19, 2014 dispositive motions deadline will allow Malibu to counter that
Harrison is not prejudiced by Malibu and Paige’s failure to comply with Rule 26(a)(2)(B) because
Paige will have additional time to comply with the Rule and Harrison will have additional time to
conduct expert discovery. Harrison’s costly and timely filed Motion to Exclude the Testimony of
Plaintiff’s Expert Witnesses will have the force of a blank slate, and uncertainty will loom over
Harrison’s motion for summary judgment, which Counsel for Harrison is already in the process of
preparing.

III.

CONCLUSION
There comes a point when a Court must tell a party “too bad.” Counsel for Harrison is

extremely busy just as Counsel for Malibu is extremely busy. We are all extremely busy.
Extending deadlines will not change that fact.
This case takes up too much time.

It is simple, and ready and ripe for summary

judgment. “Not all copying … is copyright infringement. To establish infringement, two
elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent
elements of the work that are original.” Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service
Company, 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991); See Incredible Technologies, Inc. v. Virtual Technologies,
Inc., 400 F.3d 1007, 1011 (7th Cir. 2005); See Federal Civil Jury Instructions of the Seventh

Circuit (2009 rev.) at 264.
Malibu has had over two years to conduct discovery and gather evidence to prove the two
elements necessary to establish copyright infringement, but failed to do so. For all of the
foregoing reasons, Malibu has not shown good cause for extending the deadline to complete
discovery and Malibu’s instant motion should be denied.
