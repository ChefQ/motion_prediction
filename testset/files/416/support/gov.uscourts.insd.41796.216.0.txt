PLAINTIFF’S FIRST MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME
TO COMPLETE DISCOVERY
Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”), by and through undersigned counsel and
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16 hereby moves for the entry of an order enlarging the time, by
ninety (90) days, within which the parties have to complete discovery and states:
1.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) states that “[a] schedule may be modified [] for good

cause and with the judge’s consent.” Id. Good cause is determined based upon “the diligence of
the party seeking the extension.” Spindler v. Baker & Daniels, LLP, 1:09-CV-5, 2010 WL
785380 at * 1 (N.D. Ind., 2010). “In other words, to demonstrate good cause, a party must show
that despite its diligence, the time table could not reasonably have been met.” Id.
2.

On April 15, 2014, the Court entered an order setting the case management

deadlines. Specifically, the order set the discovery deadline for August 29, 2014. [CM/ECF
175].
3.

To date, in addition to litigating against the other previously joined doe

defendants who have since been dismissed, Plaintiff has: (a) conducted discovery regarding other
doe Defendants which resulted in settlements and dismissals; (b) attempted to negotiate a

1

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 216 Filed 08/26/14 Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 1522
protective order for production of confidential documents; (c) filed a motion for entry of a
protective order; (d) prepared positional statements and attended various Local Rule 37.1
discovery conferences; (e) responded to Defendant Michael Harrison’s Motion to Compel; (f)
obtained and examined Defendant’s hard drives; (g) conferred with defense counsel regarding a
stipulation about Comcast’s IP Address correlation; (h) conferred with defense counsel regarding
a possible live video teleconference deposition of Comcast; (i) spent additional time and
resources preparing a Motion for Petition Fees and Reply for Defendant’s unsuccessful Motion
to Compel; (j) conferred and scheduled the deposition of Defendant Michael Harrison; and (k)
served its Written Estimate, Fact Witness List, Rule 26(a) Disclosures, First Set of
Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Expert Witness Report on Defendant Michael
Harrison.
4.

Despite the foregoing, which demonstrates that Plaintiff diligently pursued this

case to meet the discovery deadlines, an extension is needed.
5.

On July 9, 2014, after conferring with defense counsel, Plaintiff filed its Motion

for the Entry of an Order Authorizing Comcast to Comply with a Third Party Subpoena
[CM/ECF 197] which Defendant opposed on July 24, 2014. Comcast’s discovery is highly
relevant and supports Plaintiff’s argument that: (a) Comcast is accurate in its correlation of the
infringing IP Address to Defendant; and (b) receipt of DMCA and six-strikes notices
demonstrate that Defendant is a habitual BitTorrent user and persistent online copyright
infringer. The Court has not yet ruled on this motion. Because this motion remains undecided,
Plaintiff has not yet served Comcast with this subpoena.
6.

Most recently, Defendant filed a Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff’s

Expert Witnesses [CM/ECF 212].

Plaintiff’s deadline to respond has not yet come due,

therefore, Plaintiff has not responded.

7.

Defendant is deposing Plaintiff today, August 25, 2014.

8.

On August 7, 2014 Defendant was deposed. Defendant testified that he destroyed

a relevant hard drive after notification of this lawsuit. Therefore, the deposition testimony makes
clear that Defendant’s was involved in the spoliation of evidence. Plaintiff now intends on filing
a Motion for Sanctions against Defendant for Spoliation of Evidence.
9.

During his deposition Defendant identified individuals at GGI Recycling 1 who

may also have relevant information regarding Defendant’s destruction of evidence. Plaintiff now
intends on conducting further discovery into the destruction of this hard drive. Therefore,
Plaintiff needs more time to pursue evidence in furtherance of Defendant’s deposition testimony.
10.

On, August 18, 2014 during a telephonic conference, Plaintiff conferred with

defense counsel regarding an extension of the discovery deadline. The following day, defense
counsel emailed Plaintiff agreeing to an extension so long as discovery was limited to Comcast’s
and GGI Recycling subpoena response and deposition. This suggestion is unreasonable because
at this time, it is unknown what other relevant issues Comcast’s and GGI Recycling subpoena
response will bring to light. Additionally, neither Plaintiff nor Defendant knows what relevant
information will be revealed at Comcast’s or Malibu’s deposition. As such, discovery cannot
possibly be limited in the manner suggested by Defendant.
11.

Defendant also agreed to stipulate to allowing Plaintiff to depose Comcast within

15 days after the deposition is noticed and requiring Plaintiff to serve any subpoena within 5
days of the Court’s entry of an order.

This, too, is unreasonable because scheduling this

deposition will involve coordinating a suitable date between 5 (five) individuals. Indeed, in prior
cases it has taken a substantial amount of time to coordinate a suitable date for the deposition of
Comcast with all parties.

The recycling company Defendant use to dispose of his hard drive.

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 216 Filed 08/26/14 Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 1524
12.

This request is made in good faith and not made for the purpose of undue delay.

13.

No party would be prejudiced by granting this extension of time. In fact, both

parties would benefit from an extension because it would allow full discovery regarding the
deposition of Plaintiff, Comcast’s correlation, any DMCA or six-strikes notices Defendant
received (and possible perjury and spoliation regarding same), and any discovery obtained from
GGI Recycling regarding Defendant’s spoliation of his hard drive.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC, respectfully requests that this Court enter
an order enlarging the time, by ninety (90) days, within which the parties have to complete
discovery. A proposed order is attached for the Court’s convenience.

DATED: August 26, 2014.
