Case No. CR 11-0187-TUC LAB

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT
REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE

)

20

On May 23, 2011, two days before the date set by the Court for a determination of the

21

defendant’s competency to stand trial, the government filed a “Request for Disclosure” under

22

Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). [Dkt. 217]. At the competency hearing that followed on May 25, 2011,

23

the Court found Jared Loughner incompetent to stand trial. In reaching this conclusion, the

24

Court concluded that Mr. Loughner’s severe mental illness deprived him of both the ability to

25

understand the proceedings against him and the capacity to assist his counsel in his defense. The

26

Court therefore ordered that Mr. Loughner be committed to the custody of the Attorney General

27

for hospitalization at the Federal Medical Facility in Springfield, Missouri, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

28

§ 4241(d). [Dkt. 221, filed 5/26/11]. This statutorily-mandated commitment was ordered to

allow a determination of whether there exists a “substantial probability” that Mr. Loughner will

2

attain the capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future. See 18 U.S.C. §4241(d)(1).

3

The Court’s finding that Mr. Loughner is incompetent necessarily leaves the trial-related

4

proceedings against him at a standstill, which is where they have been since March 9, 2011,

5

when the Court found it necessary to order a competency evaluation. The Court’s findings as

6

announced in open court on May 25 make clear that defense counsel cannot have rational or

7

meaningful communication with Mr. Loughner concerning the charges. Nor can counsel consult

8

with Mr. Loughner about any possible defenses or evidence that may be offered at a trial;

9

whether or not evidence of examinations and tests will be conducted or offered by the defense;

10

or the identity of expert witnesses, and summaries of their opinions, whom the defense may call

11

at trial. See Rule 16(b)(1)(A) - (C). In short, the defense cannot begin to provide reciprocal

12

discovery unless or until Mr. Loughner becomes competent and has had adequate time to work

13

with and consult with his counsel.1

Respectfully submitted,

The government asserts compliance with its Rule 16 obligations and recognizes its
continuing obligation to disclose. Though we have received substantial discovery (up to bates
27884), it is unclear from our review to date whether the government has produced recordings
of Mr. Loughner’s post arrest statements, reports of examinations and tests, or expert reports and
summaries sufficient to invoke the reciprocal provisions of the Rule. This would be true even
were Mr. Loughner competent to proceed.
