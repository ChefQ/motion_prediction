To use this form, you must be a person who is serving a sentence under a judgment against you in a

federal court. You are asking for relief from the conviction or the sentence. This form is your motion

for relief.

Instructions

You must file the form in the United States district court that entered the judgment that you are
challenging. lf you want to challenge a federal judgment that imposed a sentence to be served in the
futurc, you should file the motion in the federal court that entered that judgment.

Make sure the form is typed or neatly written.

You must tell the truth and sign the form. If you make a false statement of a material fact, you may be
prosecuted for perjury.

Answer al] the questions. You do not need to cite Jaw. You may submit additional pages if necessary.
If you do not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information. If
you want to submit a brief or arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.

If you cannot pay for the costs of this motion (such as costs for an attorney or transcripts), you may ask
to proceed in forma pauperis (as a poor person). To do that, you must fill out the last page of this form.
Also, you must submit a certificate signed by an officer at the institution where you are confined
showing the amount of money that the institution is holding for you.

In this motion, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one court. If you want to challenge a
judgment entered by a different judge or division (either in the same district or in a different district),
you must file a separate motion.

When you have completed the form, send the original and two copies to the Clerk of the United States
District Court at this address:
