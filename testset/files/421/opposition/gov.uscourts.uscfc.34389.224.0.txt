PLAINTIFF PIONEER CREDIT RECOVERY, INC.'S RESPONSE TO
CONTINENTAL SERVICE GROUP, INC.'S MOTION TO AMEND THE COURT'S
DECEMBER 12, 2017 ORDER AND IMPOSE A CAP ON ACCOUNT TRANSFERS
Plaintiff Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. ("Pioneer") respectfully submits this response to
Plaintiff Continental Service Group, Inc.'s ("ConServe") motion to amend the Court's December
12, 2017 Order (ECF 215). ECF 219. ConServe's motion should be denied. ConServe's request
1

is contrary to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's December 8, 2017
Order ("CAFC Order") staying Part 2 of this Court's May 31 preliminary injunction ("PI"), and is
based on material errors of fact and law. Pioneer responds now as an interested party because
the motion challenges transfers to Pioneer's 2017 award term extension ("ATE") contract.
PIONEER CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION OF FACTS1
A.

Pioneer Has Authority to Operate ("ATO")
ConServe (at 1) erroneously states Pioneer "apparently" lacks an ATO. If ConServe had

checked with the United States Department of Education ("ED"), the Department of Justice,
Pioneer, or simply checked the CAFC Joint Appendix2 in its own appeal, ConServe would have
realized that the record already shows Pioneer maintains an ATO with ED. ECF 171-2 at 4 (¶
11) (June 28, 2017 Declaration of Jack Frazier explaining Pioneer's ATO with ED and Pioneer's
capacity to meet ED requirements); see also CAFC Case No. 17-2155, ECF 274 at 42.
B.

Any ED Delay Is Unfortunate But Not Unreasonable or Unprecedented; ConServe
and Other Parties Have Failed to Inform this Court of Relevant Procedural Facts
ED's delays are not unreasonable, excessive under the circumstances, or unprecedented.

ConServe's Motion and statements by other parties during the December 12, 2017 status
conference have failed to provide the relevant context. Chief Judge Susan G. Braden was well
aware of that context and chose not to take further action.
We are aware of numerous procurements where corrective action taken following a U.S.
Government Accountability Office ("GAO") decision has resulted in delays in excess of six
months or much more. Such delays are not per se unreasonable as suggested by ConServe,

1

Further facts and background relevant to this response are discussed below and in Pioneer's
November 15 and 29 briefs. CAFC Case No. 17-2155 ECF 274 at 2-23; id., ECF 297 at 1-9.
2
"Appx" references the joint appendix filed in CAFC Case No. 17-2155.
2

especially in light of the presumption that government officials act in good faith. ConServe has
certainly not met its burden to show lack of good faith here. Extended delays can be caused by
many factors, including the number of protesters, awardees, evaluation factors, and protest
issues; record size; solicitation amendments; the nature of the corrective action (i.e., internal
agency re-evaluation versus discussions/revised proposals); any ancillary Court actions; and
protests or other challenges to the corrective action. All of these factors are present here.
Other parties have implied that ED has unreasonably delayed from the March 27, 2017
date of the GAO decision, but the relevant facts show otherwise. GAO's protest statute provides
a sixty day period for an agency to report whether it will follow the GAO recommendation.
After GAO issued its decision sustaining numerous protests based on several significant
evaluation flaws, ConServe's and Pioneer's protests involving the procurement were still pending
at GAO. ConServe withdrew its GAO protest and refiled at the COFC. Pursuant to 4 C.F.R. §
21.11, GAO then dismissed Pioneer's protest solely due to ConServe's COFC filing. On April
10, 2017, Pioneer filed a new protest at the COFC. COFC Case No. 17-499, ECF 1.
ConServe's March 28, 2017 complaint raised issues about ED's responsibility
determination based on inconsistencies in ConServe's small business subcontracting plan that
were not addressed in GAO's March 27 decision. COFC Case No. 17-449, ECF 1 at 23-32. On
April 10, 2017, Pioneer protested its improper exclusion based on ED's flawed evaluation of
Pioneer's subcontracting plan and disparate treatment. COFC Case No. 17-499, ECF 1 at 23-30.
On May 19, 2017, within the sixty day GAO period, ED issued a notice of corrective action
explaining it would follow GAO's recommendation and reopen the procurement. COFC Case
No. 17-449 et al., ECF 122. On May 25, 2017, ED amended its corrective action, to allow for
revised small business participation plans. Id., ECF 135.

3

On June 6, 2017, Automated Collection Services, Inc. ("ASCI") filed a complaint
challenging ED's corrective action as "irrational, overly broad and unsupported." COFC Case No.
17-765, ECF 1. From May 19 to August 9, 2017, ED lacked certainty as to whether its corrective
action was acceptable to this Court due to the then pending ACSI protest. On August 9, 2017, the
COFC denied ASCI's motion for judgment, stating:
In the court's judgment, ED should be entitled to take corrective action to
address both the deficiencies identified by the March 27, 2017 GAO
decision and new information brought to the attention of ED. Although
ED appears to be midway in reevaluating the proposals, it should take
whatever time it deems necessary to make a reasoned decision to
comply with statutory obligations and to serve the public interest.
COFC Case No. 17-765, ECF 61 at 4 (emphasis added).
Between August 4 and October 19, 2017, ED filed regular status reports with the Court,
describing ED's action, including: updating, among other things, the instructions to offerors;
reviewing and evaluating revised proposals; drafting evaluation reports; conducting an
assessment of the findings and ratings reported by the evaluating committees on 37 proposals,
and identifying proposals that are most advantageous to ED.
At the same time ED counsel has been presumably involved in assisting ED source
selection personnel through those steps, ED counsel was also engaged in responding to numerous
protest filings before the COFC and the CAFC by an unusually large number of parties. Given
all of these considerations, the ED delay is not unreasonable or unprecedented.
C.

ED's Recent Account Transfers Are Reasonable and Prudent and
Do Not Injure ConServe
ConServe (at 1-4) claims ED has unreasonably issued almost 1 million transfers since the

CAFC Order, that ED will transfer another 1 million in January 2018, and that the Court should
micro-manage ED's contract administration by imposing a modified Part 2 PI with a cap of

4

140,000 transfers per month. Yet, ConServe's own claimed evidence3 shows ED has acted
reasonably and prudently, without injury to ConServe or others.
First, any COFC ordered cap would be contrary to the CAFC Order. The CAFC Order
lifted any limits on ED transfers to contracts that are not the subject of the COFC bid protests
filed by ConServe, Pioneer and others concerning the December 2016 large business awards. A
cap would reinstate Part 2 of the PI in part by barring transfers over 140,000 accounts. That is an
improper end run on the CAFC Order. If ConServe has concerns with the CAFC Order, it can go
back to the CAFC or appeal. What it cannot do is ask the COFC to overrule the CAFC.
In any event, ConServe's Exhibit actually shows ED acted reasonably. In December
2017, ED transferred less than 1 million accounts (approximately 927,000). The COFC had
enjoined ED from transferring accounts to other contract vehicles from March 29 to December 8,
2017, a period of slightly more than 8 months.4 That reflects less than 115,000 accounts per
month (based on the more than eight month period of the Part 2 TRO and PI). ED had
historically transferred substantially greater numbers of accounts per month5. The numbers
reviewed by Judge Taranto during argument confirm this. ED's December 2017 transfers are
thus less than one would have expected and therefore reasonable and prudent.

3

Exhibit 1 to ConServe's declaration submitted in support of its Complaint (COFC 17-449, ECF
1-1; Appx100071) was discussed during the December 8, 2017 CAFC argument. Judge Richard
G. Taranto, in particular, questioned how the Exhibit showed dilution. The Exhibit was
originally filed subject to the COFC protective order, but the court read excerpts in open court
during the CAFC hearing.
4
COFC Case No. 17-499, et al., ECF 9 (Mar. 29 temporary restraining order ("TRO")); Id., ECF
56 (Apr. 10 TRO Extension); Id., ECF 73 (Apr. 24 TRO Extension and Modification); Id., ECF
132 (May 22 Continuation of PI); Id., ECF 143 (May 31 Continuation of PI).
5
Conserve (at 2) notes ED's historic practice was to transfer approximately one-third of the
accounts to small businesses ("SB") and that the transfers per month to SBs were no more than
140,000 accounts. This yields a maximum historic transfer rate of 420,000 accounts (3 x
140,000). For the eight month injunction period, that would yield 3,336,000 total transfers, far
above the actual 927,000 transfers in December.
5

Chief Judge Braden aptly noted that the transfers arise from an endless flow of borrowers
seeking assistance. CAFC Case No. 17-2155, Appx101875 (May 22, 2017 COFC Transcript,
58:12-59:8, noting "[E]very month, there are new accounts that come up because people are in
default" and there is "new work that will be coming down the road" that serves to "offset the
concern about dilution"); see also id., ECF 274 at 19, 25, 30 (citing same). Since ConServe is
still in the competition for a new 5-year contract with a 5-year option to extend, it suffers no
harm if accounts that begin before its contract starts are handled by other contractors. Moreover,
student loans have a historically high growth rate that is not likely to change. In other words,
any monthly placements allegedly lost now due to procurement delays will be more than offset
during the five years of contract performance (plus any options) given natural growth. This
makes the contract overall more valuable to the contractors that ultimately receive award under
the protested procurement.
ARGUMENT
I.

The COFC Does Not Sit in Judgment or Otherwise Overturn CAFC Stay Orders
ConServe improperly asks this Court to overrule the CAFC Order that stayed Part 2 of

the PI. Part 2 enjoined ED from transferring accounts to contract vehicles that were not the
subject of the underlying bid protests before the COFC.
ConServe's argument (at 1) that the CAFC stayed Part 2 "without any explanation for its
decision" is incomplete. The CAFC Order first recited the four factors considered in evaluating
a stay pending appeal, and then ruled in part:
Appellants' requests are GRANTED insofar as the preliminary
injunction enjoined "transferring work to be performed under the
contract at issue in this case to other contracting vehicles to
circumvent or moot this bid protest."
CAFC Case No. 17-2155, ECF at 6; id. at 5 (reciting four factors).

6

Appellants had argued that Part 2 of the PI was overbroad and unreasonable because it
relied on ConServe's "dilution" theory previously dismissed and discredited by the COFC. The
CAFC Order recognized that appellants were likely to succeed on their claims that Part 2
(staying transfers to the 2014 SBs and the two 2017 ATE awardees) was overbroad and
unreasonable and that appellants had established irreparable harm.
ConServe again relies on its discredited and dismissed "dilution" or "siphoning"
argument. ConServe Motion at 1, 3 (dilution) and 3, 4 (siphoning). The ConServe "dilution"
theory at Complaint Count VII was (1) recognized as an uncertified Contract Disputes Act
Claim; (2) found to have no basis given the nature of the constant stream of new accounts from
borrowers (CAFC Case No. 17-2155, Appx101875 (May 22, 2017 COFC Transcript, 58:12-59:8
quoted above)); and (3) dismissed by Chief Judge Braden (COFC 17-449, ECF 87 at 2). There is
no other dilution cause of action raised by ConServe. Having dismissed Count VII, there is
nothing left that supports Part 2 of the PI and the COFC lacked the authority to enjoin the other
contract vehicles, including the 2017 ATE and the 2014 SB contracts.
During the CAFC oral argument6, the questions from the panel of judges clearly reflected
serious doubts about any dilution claim. This is further reflected in the CAFC's subsequent order
denying CBE Group, Inc.'s motion to amend the CAFC's Order. CAFC Case No. 17-2155, ECF
312. For example, Judge Timothy B. Dyk questioned where that information was in the record.
Oral Argument Recording at 21:15 ("So where's the record? This record is pretty thin in terms of
dilution or diversion. Right? What did you put in that would support the notion that the
government was diverting work from prospective awardees?"). In response, ConServe counsel

pointed only to the spreadsheet discussed in Fact Section C above. Later in the proceedings,
Judge Dyk, however, noted that ConServe's dilution theory had been dismissed. Id. at 28:50.
The current ConServe motion is yet again premised on the same discredited dilution
theory and is therefore an improper attempt to overturn the CAFC stay order.
ConServe seeks (at 5) support for its cap from an out-of-context question asked during
the CAFC oral argument. The tenor of the argument, including comments from multiple judges,
and the resulting stay order, was that there was no support in the record for any claim based on
dilution. The full context of the exchange is provided below. Mr. Canni, in the midst of
presenting ConServe's characterization of the "status quo" to be preserved by injunctive relief,
raised the issue of a cap on accounts. Judge Dyk responded: "But there's no cap in the
injunction. It just says you can't do it," (Oral Argument Recording 30:55) beginning the
following exchange:
Mr. Canni: Because the [DOJ] was unwilling to provide data to the
court. . . . They refused to cooperate with the court's efforts to fashion
appropriate relief here, so with its hands tied behind its back, the [COFC]
did what we believe was reasonable.
Judge Dyk: So what you're saying is that because the government didn't
agree to the cap, it was appropriate for the [COFC] not to impose a cap?
Oral Argument Recording at 30:58 and 31:28, respectively.
Mr. Canni: The [COFC] does not have access to the data, first of all, to
start micromanaging or administering that contract.
Judge Dyk: [I]t's your job to provide the data and if you can't provide it
from your own resources, you can ask for discovery to get it. But the
problem is here, we have [SBs] who are entitled to awards. . . and all of a
sudden, under the injunction they're not entitled to receive accounts. And
what you are complaining about is the potential, I guess, that the [SBs]
would get more business than they would have otherwise as a result of
the corrective action or actions by the government and that you wanted to
make sure that they didn't transfer the business, the accounts, to the
[SBs]. That would seem perhaps to justify an injunction saying well the

8

[SBs] have to get the same amount they were getting before they can't get
anything additional, but that's not what the injunction says.
Id. at 31:36 and 31:44, respectively.
Mr. Canni: [T]he [SBs] are not entitled to any account transfers.
Judge Dyk: It's not a question of entitlement. It's a question of whether
you have any basis for denying them the kind of level of account
servicing that they had before.
Id. at 32:41 and 32:50, respectively.
In arguing that the COFC did not abuse its discretion in fashioning the overbroad
injunctive relief, ConServe admits the COFC faced challenges in tailoring that relief in any real
way, conceding that it was not feasible to do the very thing it now asks of the COFC. See id. at
33:25 (Mr. Canni noting in part: "[T]he problem for the [COFC], as you can imagine [with] the
number of divergent interests arguing here, would have been for the court to get involved into
the administration of that contract and to set a cap and to manage that.") (emphasis added); id.
at 34:20 (Mr. Canni noting in part "[F]or the [COFC] to get involved in the business of caps and
setting caps would require the [COFC] on a monthly basis to trust the [ED's] pool number. So
[ED] would have to give the court a pool—we have 200,000 transfers available and now we
want you to cap those at 60 or 70,000 to reflect a third. The court could not get into the
business of administration . . .) (emphasis added).7
The COFC does not micromanage contract administration – yet that is the role
ConServe's requested cap would require.

7

ConServe bears the burden to establish cause for the COFC to grant injunctive relief, but, as
Judge Dyk recognized, ConServe did not even seek the information it needed to bring its request
to bear. Oral Argument Recording at 33:47 to 34:11 (exchange between Judge Dyk and
ConServe counsel regarding ConServe's lack of motion to compel discovery).

II.

Pioneer Has a Valid Contract for Receipt of Transfers; the Proposed Cap
Does Not Preserve the Status Quo
ConServe continues to allege (at 2) without support that the 2017 ATEs are improper

awards. The 2017 ATE contracts that were subject to Part 2 of the PI are valid contract awards,
issued to address a procurement defect raised by Pioneer and three other plaintiffs in Coast
Professional, Inc. et al. v. United States, 120 Fed. Cl. 727 (2015), vacated and remanded, 828
F.3d 1349, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Appx810022, 810027, 810095-96, 810167, 810169, 810171,
810177-78, 102081 (documents from COFC Case No. 15-207 et al.); COFC Case No. 17-664,
ECF 60 (COFC Opinion dismissing ConServe 2017 ATE protest).
Moreover, contrary to ConServe's arguments (at 4), the proposed cap does not preserve
the status quo. There was no bar to performing under the 2017 ATEs before the COFC issued its
overbroad TROs or PIs.8
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Pioneer requests that the Court deny the ConServe Motion.
Respectfully submitted,
