PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO AMEND THE COURT’S ORDER OF DECEMBER 12, 2017
TO IMPOSE A TOTAL CAP OF 140,000 TRANSFERS PER MONTH ON ED’S
TRANSFER ACTIVITY

Continental Service Group, Inc. (“ConServe” or “Plaintiff”) hereby moves the Court to
amend its Order of December 12, 2017 to impose a total cap of 140,000 transfers per month on
the Department of Education’s (“ED”) transfer activity.
In its Order dated December 12, 2017, the Court expressed its displeasure with the
significant delays associated with the announced corrective action, which now is overdue by
more than three months, and ordered that the Department of Education (“ED”) complete its longanticipated corrective action by January 11, 2018. See Dkt. No. 215.
While we recognize that this Court only very recently acquired this case, if past is
prologue, ED will not move expeditiously to meet this Court’s reasonable deadline and will
continue to dilute the enjoined contract in the interim. ED likely will proceed with no urgency
and its key personnel will use their “use or lose” vacation during the next several weeks setting
up a course of events where the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), on behalf of ED, appears before
this Court during the week of January 8th with yet another request for more time, holding out
that the corrective action will be completed imminently.
Further delays are even more likely now that prong two of the injunction has been
temporarily lifted by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (without any explanation for its
decision), which ED immediately seized on over last weekend and transferred approximately
one-million accounts to the 11 small businesses and the two recently awarded Award-Term
Extension contracts (“ATEs”), which apparently do not possess an Authority To Operate and,
thus, cannot even perform the work. ED’s behavior over the last nine months suggests that,
more than likely, ED is going to continue proceeding at its own pace and, if that pace does not
align with the Court’s order, ultimately ask this Court for forgiveness. The saying, “It's better to
beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission” resonates here.

While we genuinely hope that ED moves expeditiously to complete corrective action and
that it does not make any further transfers in the interim, facing irreparable harm, as detailed in
the Declaration appended to its Complaint, ConServe cannot sit idle and seeks some protection
by this Court. We submit that during the pendency of proceedings before this Court while we
await new award decisions, returning ED’s account transfer activity to the status quo before the
illegal awards were made is a fair and reasonable outcome. Notably, the imposition of a
reasonable cap is what ConServe advocated for during the preliminary injunction hearing before
this Court on May 22, 2017. Prior to the improper awards, the five ATE contractors received
appropriately two-thirds of all available account transfers each month, with the 11 small
businesses sharing the remaining one-third. Based on our reviews of the historical transfer data,
attached to our Complaint as Exhibit 1, we submit that a fair and reasonable cap is a not-toexceed (“NTE”) cap of 140,000 transfers per month, which also was the amount requested by
counsel for the small businesses during the hearing on May 22, 2017. See May 22, 2017 Hr’g
Tr. at 60:18-24.
Importantly, the two recently awarded ATEs to Alltran and Pioneer were not in existence
at that time and only came into existence in May of 2017 and, thus, any return to the status quo
does not involve their receipt of any account transfers.1 However, so long as ED is capped at no
more than 140,000 transfers per month, it is immaterial to ConServe how those transfers are
allocated, whether among the smalls or among the smalls and the two ATEs. If this cap is not
imposed, ConServe believes that ED will perform at least another release of accounts before
January 11, 2018, and anticipates that ED will release another million transfers.

1

ConServe protested these awards (Case No. 17-664), arguing that they were unjustified and improper limitedsource awards; after the court dismissed that protest for lack of standing, which decision ConServe believes was
erroneous, it filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit.
2

The current procurement already has been diluted significantly by ED’s improper
siphoning activity; allowing further siphoning while we hope for the long-awaited corrective
action is unfair to the ultimate awardees of this procurement. Accordingly, ConServe
respectfully requests that the Court’s order be amended to impose a NTE total cap of 140,000
transfers per month to any and all contractors.
I.

This Court Has Broad Authority To Tailor Appropriate Injunctive Relief
The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(2), grants the COFC broad authority to provide

injunctive relief that it determines to be appropriate under the circumstances. Specifically, the
Tucker Act provides the COFC with broad authority to “award any relief that the court
considers proper, including declaratory and injunctive relief . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(2)
(emphasis added).
The Federal Circuit recognized this broad grant of authority in Turner Constr. Co., Inc. v.
United States:
The Tucker Act also explicitly empowers the court to ‘award any
relief that the court considers proper, including declaratory and
injunctive relief . . . .’ Id. § 1491(b)(2) (emphases added). Thus,
once jurisdiction attaches, the Court of Federal Claims has broad
equitable powers to fashion an appropriate remedy. We give
deference to the Court of Federal Claims’ decision to grant or deny
injunctive relief, only disturbing its decision if it abused its
discretion.
645 F.3d 1377, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (emphasis on “any relief” in original; other emphases
added).
Under these unique circumstances involving parallel procurements for the same work,
this Court can and should “fashion an appropriate remedy” here and grant the requested relief for
the reasons set forth below.

II.

The Requested Cap Is Reasonable and Preserves the Status Quo
The cap requested herein is reasonable and merely returns things to the status quo at the

time of the illegal awards. As depicted in Attachment 1 to ConServe’s Complaint, the historical
transfer data illustrates that the five large business contractors received approximately two-thirds
of all account transfers each month. In terms of raw numbers, the small business contractors
received no more than 140,000 total transfers in any month. Frankly, this cap should have been
imposed as requested by ConServe during the May 22 hearing. However, ED opposed any cap,
despite that both ConServe and the small businesses were amenable to such. As a result, the
Court simply ordered a full stop on all transfers, which too was reasonable and, had ED moved
expeditiously, only would have been in place for a few months. Thus, it is eminently reasonable
for this Court now to impose such a cap, particularly given ED continues to delay its completion
of corrective action and new awards.
As the Court knows, despite learning in March 2017, that the GAO issued a decision,
which reflected a wholesale condemnation of the procurement, ED delayed until May to inform
the court that it intended to take corrective action. And then ED took another month even to
announce the specific corrective action it intended to take. At that time, ED initially represented
that it would complete its corrective action by August 25, 2017. August has come and gone with
no meaningful indication from ED as to when awards will be made.
If the past is any indication, ED will not move expeditiously to complete corrective
action and will continue to siphon off work from this procurement. Rather, in the coming weeks,
ED will release another million accounts and, thereafter, through DOJ, will request another 30
days, given delays encountered over the holidays. Imposing a cap on transfers going forward
will mitigate the continuing harm to the ultimate awardees through ED’s siphoning activity.

4

Indeed, at the December 8, 2017 oral argument before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, Judge Dyk, during an exchange with undersigned counsel, effectively endorsed the use
of such a cap, stating as follows (emphasis added):
What you are complaining about is the potential, I guess, that the
small businesses would get more business than they would have
otherwise as a result of the corrective action or actions by the
government and that you wanted to make sure that they didn’t,
transfer the business, the accounts, to the small businesses. That
would seem perhaps to justify an injunction saying well the small
businesses have to get the same amount they were getting before
they can’t get anything additional . . . .
III.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, ConServe respectfully moves this Court to impose the

requested cap set forth above.
