BACKGROUND
Defendants Jack Carrel, Mauricio Ferrer, and Shawn Loftis are three former employees
of the Plaintiff, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Inc. (“AHF”), and are Relators in a qui tam action

CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

Theodore J. Leopold, Esq., Salpeter Gitkin, LLP, and Kaiser Law Firm, PLLC (hereafter, the
“Attorney Defendants”) are law firms who are currently counsel of record for the Relators in the
qui tam action. In the qui tam complaint, filed under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et
seq., and the Florida False Claims Act, Fla. Stat. §§ 68.081 et seq., the Relators have alleged that
AHF has fraudulently billed the United States and the State of Florida through the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. In support of the claims asserted by Relators in their Amended Qui Tam
Complaint, the Attorney Defendants attached certain internal AHF documents as exhibits to the
Complaint. One of those exhibits – Exhibit 9 – is a redacted AHF spreadsheet that references
(not by name) some 840 AHF patients who, according to the Complaint, were improperly
“linked” by AHF to services in an illegal referral scheme.
Following the filing of the Amended Qui Tam Complaint, AHF wrote to Relators’
counsel and asserted that the redacted spreadsheet contained certain private healthcare
information of some AHF patients, and that this information should be kept confidential pursuant
to the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42
U.S.C. §§ 1320d et seq. (“HIPAA”). AHF demanded that the exhibit be removed from the
public domain. Without conceding AHF’s assertions, the Attorney Defendants immediately
responded by filing with this Court a Motion to Withdraw Exhibit 9 to Amended Complaint,
Docket Entry 14-9, and Substitute Redacted Version of Exhibit (D.E. 17), and the Court then
granted the motion and directed the Clerk to replace DE 14-9 with the further redacted exhibit
submitted as DE 17-1. In addition, Defendant Cohen Milstein, as requested by AHF, removed
from its firm website the hyperlink to Exhibit 9 to the Amended Qui Tam Complaint.
Despite the Attorney Defendants’ immediate response and curative actions concerning
public disclosure of any arguably HIPAA-protected information, AHF has seized upon the
2

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 3 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

attachment of Exhibit 9 to the Amended Qui Tam Complaint in an effort to retaliate against
Relators and their counsel for their initiation of the qui tam proceeding. Thus, AHF has taken
the unprecedented and unfounded step of commencing this separate action for both damages and
injunctive relief alleging common-law breach of contract and conversion claims against Relators
and common-law conversion and tortious interference with contract claims against the Attorney
Defendants, Relators’ litigation counsel.

AHF has attempted to disguise this baseless and

retaliatory suit as an effort to protect the privacy rights of its patients – though no actual AHF
patients are named as parties, and HIPAA does not create a private right of action for patients, let
alone healthcare providers such as AHF.
AHF followed its commencement of this action with the instant discovery motion, in
which AHF advances the baseless assertion that it is required by statute to sue the Relators and
their lawyers and seek expedited discovery in order to protect its patients from injury. See D.E.
22 at 17. AHF cites no legal authority for this proposition, and, indeed, what little case law AHF
includes in its motion demonstrates that the motion should be denied. AHF also asserts that
expedited discovery is necessary so it can determine whether or not to pursue a preliminary
injunction or sanctions against the Defendants (see D.E. 22 at 21), but it fails to provide any legal
authority that would entitle it to engage in a fishing expedition to seek evidence for a threatened
motion for sanctions in a different case. If AHF is in such a hurry to begin discovery related to
the evidence submitted by Relators in the qui tam action, the proper place for it is in that action,
not in this separate proceeding. Notably, AHF’s counsel thus far has declined to participate in a
Rule 26(f) discovery conference in that action.

ARGUMENT
Expedited discovery is unwarranted in this matter because Defendants will be filing this
week Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss the complaint that, if granted, would moot the
need for any discovery in this action at all. Beyond that, AHF has failed to specifically allege,
much less make a prima facie showing that it is subject to any irreparable harm that would merit
deviation from a standard discovery schedule, or otherwise show good cause for expedited
discovery. Indeed, it is apparent that AHF has filed this motion simply to try to gain some
tactical advantage over Relators in the qui tam action, which is the proper forum for discovery
between the parties.
A. Expedited Discovery Is Not Warranted Because Defendants Are Filing Dispositive
Motions This Week.
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, “[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before
the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f), except in a proceeding exempted from
initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules, by stipulation, or by
court order.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). The parties have not yet conferred as required by Rule
26(f), and the Court has not set a deadline for the parties to submit a scheduling order. Indeed,
pursuant to the Court’s Order (D.E. 26), Defendants have until May 29, 2015, to file their
responses to the Complaint. 1 In accordance with that schedule, Defendants will be filing Rule
12(b)(6) motions to dismiss that will demonstrate that the claims against all of the Defendants
fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

1

Although AHF agreed to Defendants’ motion for an extension of time to respond to the complaint until
May 29, 2015, AHF refused to agree to Defendants’ request for a 2-day extension of the deadline for Defendants’ to
respond to the motion for expedited discovery so that the current response would be due on the same day as
Defendants’ responses to the Complaint – i.e., May 29.

CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

Expedited discovery is “not the norm,” and it is a plaintiff’s burden to make a “prima
facie showing of the need for the expedited discovery.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Inc. v. O’Connor, 194 F.R.D. 618, 623 (N.D. Ill. 2000). In those limited circumstances where
courts have allowed expedited discovery, it has typically been upon a showing of irreparable
harm that can be addressed by expedited discovery or to prevent the spoliation of evidence. See
St. Louis Grp., Inc. v. Metals and Additives Corp., Inc., 275 F.R.D. 236, 240-41 (S.D. Tex. 2011)
(collecting cases).
Where a motion to dismiss has been filed, courts frequently refuse to allow expedited
discovery while the motion is pending, because of the unnecessary burden that expedited
discovery may have on both litigants and the court. See, e.g., Wilcox Indus. Corp. v. Hansen,
279 F.R.D. 64, 72 (D.N.H. 2012) (pending motion to dismiss weighs against expedited
discovery); Guttenberg v. Emery, 26 F. Supp. 3d 88, 97 (D.D.C. 2014) (denying expedited
discovery while motion to dismiss is pending); True the Vote, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Serv., No.
13-734 (RBW), 2014 WL 4347197, at *8 (D.D.C. Aug. 7, 2014) (dismissing motion to expedite
as “premature” while motion to dismiss is pending); Unified Gov't of Wyandotte Cnty./Kansas
City, Kan. v. U.S. Gen. Servs. Admin., No. 11-2400-JTM, 2012 WL 602838, at *2 (D. Kan. Feb.
24, 2012) (denying motion to expedite discovery in light of pending motion to dismiss);
Sunflower Elec. Power Corp. v. Sebelius, No. 08-2575-EFM-DWB, 2009 WL 774340, at *5 (D.
Kan. Mar. 20, 2009) (same); Sinclair Nat’l Bank v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
No. 00-2398, 2000 WL 34012862, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 18, 2000)(same).
On May 29, 2015, just two days from now, Defendants will be filing Rule 12(b)(6)
motions to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds that the underlying conduct of the Attorney
Defendants alleged in the complaint is privileged and that AHF has failed to adequately allege
5

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 6 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

the elements of its claims against any of the Defendants. Because these motions are likely to
dispose of the entire action, the burden on the Defendants and the Court from expedited
discovery would simply be wasted effort. See Wilcox, 279 F.R.D. at 72 (noting the potential
“unnecessary effort” of expedited discovery before a motion to dismiss is decided). AHF’s
motion for expedited discovery should therefore be denied.
B. AHF’s Motion Should Also Be Denied Because AHF Has Failed to Allege, Much
Less Make Any Prima Facie Showing, That It Is Incurring Any Harm That Would
Necessitate Expedited Discovery.
As discussed above, it is a plaintiff’s burden to make a “prima facie showing of the need
for the expedited discovery.”

Merrill Lynch, 194 F.R.D. at 623.

AHF’s motion fails to

articulate, much less make any prima facie showing, of any need for expedited discovery outside
the normal procedures.

Although AHF asserts that certain information contained in the

originally filed, but since withdrawn, Exhibit 9 is “highly sensitive” and argues that “time is of
the essence,” nowhere in its motion does AHF explain why there is presently any special urgency
that would warrant expedited discovery to investigate how the Relators came to possess the
patient spreadsheet or any other information. AHF asserts that it requires this relief “to protect
AHF and its patients from future harm,” but it fails to explain what “future harm” it may suffer
from the Relators’ continued possession of the documents at issue – or, for that matter, how it
has any standing to seek relief on behalf of its patients, who are not a party to this action. 2 These
conclusory allegations are manifestly insufficient to support a motion for expedited discovery.
See, e.g., Avaya, Inc. v. Acumen Telecom Corp., No. 10-cv-03075-CMA-BNB, 2011 WL 9293,
2

To the extent that AHF alleges that there is the risk of future harm from potential disclosure of documents
in the possession of the qui tam Relators or their counsel, any such risk is properly addressed with a motion for a
protective order in the qui tam action. Indeed, HIPAA specifically contemplates such protection, as it provides that
a covered entity may disclose protected health information in the course of “any judicial or administrative
proceeding” pursuant to a court order, or where the party seeking the information has made reasonable efforts to
secure a “qualified protective order.” 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e).

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 7 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

at *3 (D. Col. Jan. 3, 2011) (denying expedited discovery absent “any factual showing of a real
need for expedited discovery”). Indeed, while AHF argues that it has a “statutory obligation”
under HIPAA to “mitigate the harm” caused by Relators’ possession of the patient spreadsheet
and other unspecified documents, it cites no cases supporting its claim that it has any right, much
less an obligation, to enforce any HIPAA-based claims. Because AHF has not shown any need
for expedited discovery, its motion should be denied.
C. AHF’s Motion Should Also Be Denied Because AHF Has Failed to Demonstrate Any
of the Factors Required to Establish “Good Cause” for Expedited Discovery.
Courts have adopted a good cause standard for determining whether to grant a motion
seeking expedited discovery. See St. Jude Medical S.C., Inc. v. Biosense Webster Inc., No. 6:13–
cv–333–Orl–28TBS, 2013 WL 1502184, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 12, 2013). Factors the courts
consider in deciding whether a party has shown good cause include: (1) whether a motion for
preliminary injunction is pending; (2) the breadth of the requested discovery; (3) the reason(s)
for requesting expedited discovery; (4) the burden on the opponent to comply with the request
for discovery; and (5) how far in advance of the typical discovery process the request is made.
Id. (citing Disability Rights Council of Greater Wash. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Authority,
234 F.R.D. 4, 6 (D.D.C. 2006)). In determining whether expedited discovery is warranted,
courts generally also consider whether a motion to dismiss the complaint is pending. See cases
cited above. The party seeking to expedite discovery bears the burden of showing good cause
for departing from the usual discovery procedures. Nassau Terminals, Inc. v. M/V BERING SEA,
No. 99-104-CIV-J-20C, 1999 WL 1293476, at *1 (M.D. Fla. July 1, 1999). AHF has failed to
meet that burden.

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 8 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

1. There is no pending motion for preliminary injunction.
Although its Complaint seeks injunctive relief, AHF has not filed a motion for
preliminary injunction, which weighs strongly against expedited discovery. See, e.g., Azco
Biotech Inc. v. Qiagen, N.V., No. 12-CV-2599-BEN DHB, 2013 WL 3283841, at *3 (S.D. Cal.
June 26, 2013) (denying motion to expedite discovery in the absence of motion for preliminary
injunction); Dimension Data N. Am., Inc. v. NetStar–1, Inc., 226 F.R.D. 528, 531-32 (E.D.N.C.
2005) (same). Moreover, expedited discovery is not appropriate when sought in anticipation of
a prospective motion for injunctive relief. See Wilcox, 279 F.R.D. at 69-70 (denying expedited
discovery for “potential rather than an actual motion for preliminary injunctive relief”); Edgenet,
Inc. v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 259 F.R.D. 385, 387 (E.D. Wis. 2009) (same); Momenta
Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Pharm. Indus. Ltd., 765 F. Supp. 2d 87, 89 (D. Mass. 2011) (collecting
cases) (“[t]he majority of courts have held…that the fact that there was no pending preliminary
injunction motion weighed against allowing plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery”). Nor
has AHF has cited any authority that would support a right to conduct expedited discovery in aid
of an as-yet-unfiled motion for sanctions. This factor clearly weighs against expedited
discovery.
2.

The discovery AHF seeks is demonstrably overbroad.

The discovery AHF seeks sweeps far beyond what is even arguably necessary to learn
how

the

Relators

acquired

any

records

that

might

contain

HIPAA-protected

information. Assuming AHF could otherwise show good cause for the relief it seeks – which it
cannot – the information could be acquired simply by serving interrogatories under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 33. Instead, AHF seeks a far-ranging production of records sweeping well beyond the narrow
issue of confidential health information that AHF has invoked as justification for this motion.
8

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 9 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

For example, AHF’s request for production seeks not only confidential health information but
also all “confidential AHF documents.” See D.E. 22-1 at 10. AHF also seeks any records
“pertaining to any efforts [Relators] have taken to secure confidential AHF documents,” and any
records regarding any communications between the Relators and their attorneys and the
governments of the United States and the State of Florida. None of this information is critical, or
even relevant, to the sole issue AHF claims it seeks to remedy – the potential public disclosure of
patient health information. Id. Moreover, because the expedited discovery AHF seeks is aimed
not only at the Relators but also at their counsel (see D.E. 22-1 at 33), AHF’s discovery requests
clearly seek privileged attorney-client communications and information. Thus, AHF’s proposed
discovery requests are not narrowly tailored to the issue of public disclosure of patient health
information.

This further weighs against the request for expedited discovery.

See, e.g.,

American LegalNet, Inc. v. Davis, 673 F.Supp.2d 1063, 1069 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (denying
expedited discovery “where movant’s discovery requests were ‘wholly overbroad in scope’”).
3. AHF has not demonstrated a valid reason for seeking expedited discovery.
AHF asserts that it should be allowed to take expedited discovery because it has a
purported “statutory obligation” to determine if the Relators are in possession of any material
that contains private medical information protected by HIPAA. As noted above, AHF cites no
legal authority supporting the assertion that it has any right, much less an obligation, under
HIPAA to sue the Relators and their lawyers. Indeed, AHF has no standing to assert claims on
its patients’ behalf, and no patients are named as plaintiffs in this action.
The case law cited by AHF in support of its motion demonstrates why this motion should
be denied.

In particular, Cabotage v. Ohio Hosp. for Psychiatry undermines AHF’s

argument. As in this case, the employer in Cabotage sought an order from the court demanding
9

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 10 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

the return of documents in the possession of a former employee because, according to the
employer, they were protected under HIPAA. Cabotage v. Ohio Hosp. for Psychiatry, LLC, No.
2:11-CV-50, 2012 WL 3064116, at *3 (S.D. Ohio July 27, 2012). The Cabotage court denied
the employers’ motion because, “to the extent Plaintiff's continued possession of the documents
at issue violates HIPAA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not this Court, is the only
party authorized to enforce the Act.” Id. As in Cabotage, AHF is “effectively seeking to
enforce” HIPAA through its complaint. Because it has no standing to enforce HIPAA, its
request to conduct expedited discovery in support of such a claim should be denied.
AHF also cites TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Adams in support of its motion. In that case,
the court granted expedited discovery to allow TracFone to discover the scope of an ongoing
fraudulent “scheme” in which the defendants allegedly posed as TracFone employees to gain
free TracFone airtime. TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Adams, 304 F.R.D. 672, 673 (S.D. Fla.
2015). The court found that expedited discovery was warranted “so that TracFone may mitigate
any additional irreparable harm caused by Defendants' ongoing alleged scheme.” 3 Id. In this
case, however, AHF has not asserted that it is suffering any ongoing harm, or indeed that it has
suffered any harm at all. See Qwest Comm. Int’l, Inc. v. WorldQuest Networks, Inc., 213 F.R.D.
418, 421 (D. Col. 2003) (denying motion for expedited discovery to address “conduct that has
already occurred, which would have little, if any, bearing on irreparable injuries that may occur
pendent lite”).

In stark contrast to the situation in TracFone, AHF is not seeking expedited

discovery to smoke out an ongoing fraudulent scheme. Indeed, Relators all left the employ of
AHF more than eighteen months ago.

3

TracFone is also distinguishable because it involved a claim for infringement. Good cause for expedited
discovery frequently exists in infringement actions because of the ongoing nature of infringing conduct. See, e.g.,
Pod-Ners, LLC v. N. Feed & Bean of Lucerne Ltd. Liab. Co., 204 F.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Col. 2002).

10

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 11 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

The remaining cases cited in AHF’s motion are either inapposite or stand only for the
general principle that a court has inherent power to issue sanctions or otherwise limit the use of
information gained outside the normal discovery process. See Hodgson v. Texaco Inc., 440 F.2d
662, 663 (5th Cir. 1971) (holding that employee’s retention of company records was not
protected activity under the Fair Labor Standards Act); JDS Uniphase Corp. v. Jennings, 473 F.
Supp. 2d 697, 704 (E.D. Va. 2007) (employer could sustain breach of contract action against
employee who violated disclosure agreement). None of these cases cited by AHF has any
bearing on the instant motion. AHF is not before the court in this case seeking sanctions or
moving to exclude documents from evidence in the qui tam action — indeed, to date AHF has
declined to participate in a Rule 26(f) discovery conference in that action.
The only explicit reason AHF has offered for seeking expedited discovery is, in fact, an
improper one. In its motion, AHF states that it is seeking expedited discovery “to further
develop the factual record concerning the Former Employees’ self-held discovery tactics and
Defendants’ possession and use of the confidential information and thereby determine what
remedies and sanctions to seek in a forthcoming motion for injunctive relief.” D.E. 22 at 23.
Obviously, any motion for sanctions being contemplated by AHF must be submitted in the qui
tam action, where any allegedly sanctionable “self-help discovery tactics” took place. AHF
cannot use this discovery motion to attempt to gather evidence for use in the separate qui tam
lawsuit. In determining whether a motion for expedited discovery or other discovery request is
proper, “a court is not required to blind itself to the purpose for which a party seeks information.
Thus, when the purpose of a discovery request is to gather information for use in proceedings
other than the pending suit, discovery properly is denied.” See Nu Image, Inc. v. Does 1-23, 322,
799 F.Supp.2d 34, 41 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340,
11

Case 1:15-cv-21546-KMW Document 27 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/27/2015 Page 12 of 15
CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

352 n.17 (1978)). For this additional reason, AHF’s motion for expedited discovery should be
denied.
4. The burden of the requested discovery request on Relators and their Counsel
would be substantial.
AHF’s vague and open-ended discovery requests manifestly would impose an undue
burden on Defendants. As the Eleventh Circuit has noted:
Discovery imposes several costs on the litigant from whom discovery is sought. These
burdens include the time spent searching for and compiling relevant documents; the time,
expense, and aggravation of preparing for and attending depositions; the costs of copying
and shipping documents; and the attorneys' fees generated in interpreting discovery
requests, drafting responses to interrogatories and coordinating responses to production
requests, advising the client as to which documents should be disclosed and which ones
withheld, and determining whether certain information is privileged.
Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., 123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir. 1997).

The burdens

described in Chudasama would be particularly acute for Defendants in this case, because AHF’s
request for production seeks documents from both the Relators and their attorneys, raising
obvious privilege issues. In contrast to the substantial burden and expense to Defendants if they
are required to provide the expedited discovery AHF seeks, AHF will suffer no harm if this
motion is denied and it is required to conduct discovery in the normal course of this case and
after Defendants’ threshold dispositive motions are decided. Indeed, it is apparent that this
motion is in fact a “thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the normal litigation process” in the qui
tam action in an effort to gain a tactical advantage by short-circuiting the standard discovery
procedures in that case, which is reason enough to deny the motion. See In re Fannie Mae
Derivative Litig., 227 F.R.D. 142, 143 (D.D.C. 2005). This factor strongly weighs against
allowing AHF to conduct expedited discovery.

12

CASE NO: 15-cv-21546-KMW

5. AHF’s motion for expedited discovery is premature
At a minimum, the Court should first decide Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motions to
dismiss before allowing any expedited discovery in this case. As noted above, courts frequently
hold that a motion to expedite discovery is premature where a motion to dismiss is pending. See,
e.g., True the Vote, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Serv., No. 13-734 (RBW), 2014 WL 4347197, at *8
(D.D.C. Aug. 7, 2014); Unified Gov't of Wyandotte Cnty./Kansas City, Kan., 2012 WL 602838 at
*2; Sunflower Electric, 2009 WL 774340 at *5. Defendants will be filing motions to dismiss the
complaint within two days – i.e., by May 29, 2015. For this additional reason, therefore, the
Court should deny AHF’s motion.
CONCLUSION
AHF’s motion for expedited discovery is a transparent attempt to collect information to
be used against the Defendants in the qui tam action – where AHF thus far has refused to
participate in a Rule 26(f) discovery conference. Because Defendants are this week filing
dispositive Rule 12(b)(6) motions, because AHF has failed to demonstrate that it is incurring any
imminent harm that would justify expedited discovery and further has failed to demonstrate good
cause for deviating from the normal course of discovery, and for the other reasons set forth
above, Plaintiff’s motion for expedited discovery should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
