INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Technology Properties Limited ("TPL") and Patriot Scientific Corp. ("Patriot")

seek leave to serve their proposed First Amended Disclosure Of Asserted Claims And
Preliminary Infringement Contentions ("Amended PICs") attached hereto as Exh.1.1 This
motion ("Motion To Amend PICs") is in response to the Court's November 7, 2006 Order
("November 7 Order") [doc. # 162] which, although it denied TPL's previously-filed Motion to
Correct Preliminary Infringement Contentions ("Motion To Correct PICs") [doc. 96-1 filed
8/14/2006], which sought to rely on claim charts for representative chips rather than provide a
claim chart for each of the huge number of accused chips, denied that motion "without prejudice
to filing amended preliminary infringement contentions that include infringement contentions for
each accused product as required under the local rules." In accordance with that Order,
Plaintiffs' proposed Amended PICs provide contentions, including claim charts, for each of
Defendants' products that plaintiffs accuse of infringement.
TPL2 provided Defendants with the proposed amended PICs and a draft of the present
motion on December 22, 2006, and sent CD-ROMs containing the claim charts on December 26,
requesting that Defendants consent to the proposed amended PICs, or meet and confer. Cook ¶
22.3 Defendants said that they could not evaluate Plaintiffs' request without reviewing the
extensive claim charts, and that they could not do so over the holidays, so Plaintiffs agreed to
defer filing the motion and attend the requested meet and confer on January 8, eventually

rescheduled to January 9. Cook ¶ 23.
At the meet and confer, Defendants said Plaintiffs' motion asserted that the chips for
which claim charts were provided in December were the same chips that had been identified by
"family" in June and July, and that Defendants could not evaluate this assertion without being
told the "family" to which each of the December claim chart chips belong. Cook ¶ 24.
To meet this objection, TPL prepared and on February 9 sent Defendants a lengthy
spreadsheet listing each of the December claim chart chips by part number, and identifying the
family to which each of those chips belongs, together with a letter which said, "[TPL believes]
the present spreadsheet has all of the information you and your clients need to make a decision
whether or not to oppose the motion [and so[ please let us know your decision by [] Feb. 13."
Cook ¶ 25; Exhs. 11, 12. Also, to reduce the parties' burden in discovery and at trial, and as
added incentive to consent to the proposed motion, TPL asked Defendants to reconsider that
portion of TPL's original "representative parts" proposal that would limit discovery and trial to
the proposed representative chips. Cook ¶ 26; Exh. 11.
On February 18, after requesting additional time, NEC4 wrote that was interested in the
representative chip proposal, and said:
Assuming that we have reached closure on the product list and
representative products, NEC Electronics would like to confirm the
terms of the stipulation to be entered by the parties. NEC
Electronics believes that the parties should include the following
agreed terms in the stipulation: [setting forth specific terms].

On February 6, 2007, all NEC Defendants other than NEC Electronics settled and were
dismissed. Doc. # 208.

Exh. 13. After TPL provided its response to these terms, the parties held a further meet and
confer on March 13, where they discussed problems with and objections to a representative parts
stipulation. Cook ¶ 28.
TPL has worked with NEC and Toshiba to overcome their objections, and believes that
stipulations with NEC and Toshiba will be reached before they need respond to this motion.
Cook ¶ 28, Exhs. 14-16.
However, MEI announced it will not enter into a representative parts stipulation, and will
oppose the present motion to amend PICs, thereby necessitating the filing of this motion now
rather than waiting to conclude stipulations with NEC and Toshiba.5 Cook ¶ 29.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

Events Leading Up To The November 7, 2006 Order
1.

TPL's Early June 27-28 Disclosure of Accused Chip Families and
Chips Representing Those Families

On June 27, 2006, three weeks prior to the deadline for serving PICs, TPL responded to
the Defendants' requests for early information concerning TPL's infringement contentions and
said that it was accusing certain broad chip categories of infringing the patents-in-suit. See Cook
e-mail 6/27/06 attaching a 27 page table entitled "Preliminary List of Texas Defendants' Accused
Chips, June 27, 2006." ("June 27 Preliminary List").6 Exhs. 2 and 3, respectively. In the June

5

Defendant ARM, who intervened because some defendants sought indemnification for ARM's
sale to them of several different "cores" implicated in Plaintiff's assertions of infringement
against the '584 patent, initially said that the "representative chips" discussion does not pertain to
ARM because it does not sell chips. Cook ¶ 30. Plaintiffs had taken this to mean that ARM was
agnostic as to the present motion; however, discussions in the past few days between ARM and
TPL counsel have identified mutual benefits to a representative parts stipulation between them,
and constructive discussions are under way, which TPL believes will lead to a stipulation with
ARM. Id.
6

Because TPL was providing this information voluntarily, in advance of the scheduled date for
preliminary infringement contentions, TPL specified the following conditions on its disclosure:

CASE NO.2:05CV494

-3-

Case 2:05-cv-00494-TJW Document 222 Filed 03/26/07 Page 8 of 21 PageID #: 8732

27 letter, TPL said that "Greater detail, in the form of part numbers of representative chips, will
be provided in the near future." Exh. 2, p. 2 (emphasis added).
On June 28, 2006, as promised, TPL sent a further letter, stating, "This replaces the list of
chips provided to you yesterday, and provides important additional information, i.e.
representative part numbers ("Product," col. 2) for the family to which TPL believes these parts
belong ("Chip Family," col. 5)." Exh. 4. Attached to the June 28 letter, TPL provided its
"Preliminary Master List [of] Chips Accused of Infringement [as of] June 28, 2006 ("June 28
Preliminary Master List") (emphasis added) which, in a column captioned "Product" identified
chips by part number, e.g. "Microcontroller TMP87CH48CU," making it clear that these were
the representative chips mentioned in the June 27 and June 28 letters, and, in a column entitled
"Chip Family," identified by a specific family identifier (e.g. TLCS-870) the chip family to
which each representative chip belonged. Exh. 5.
2.

TPL's Formal July 17 Preliminary Infringement Contentions

On July 17, 2006, pursuant to P.R. 3-1, TPL served Technology Properties, Ltd., Inc.'s
Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Preliminary Infringement Contentions ("Original PICs") on
each of the Defendants. Exh. 6. Consistent with the June 28 letter, the Original PICs included a

Continued from the previous page

These lists are being provided to you in confidence, subject to the proposed and
anticipated protective order, as an accommodation and convenience to assist you in
preparing for discovery, in advance of the deadline for TPL to provide its infringement
contentions, without prejudice to subsequent modification, such as by adding additional
products, or by deleting products. [] These lists are also provided to you with the further
understanding that they may not be used in this litigation as evidence that any particular
products are or are not covered by the patents, or any of them. Any person who finds
these conditions unacceptable should promptly double delete his or her lists, and not
retain or share copies until we can reach a mutually agreeable understanding.
Exh. 2, p. 1.

list of accused representative NEC, Toshiba and MEI chips identified by part numbers, slightly
modified from the list of representative chips contained in the June 28 letter, and claim charts
showing how the representative chips infringed the claims of the patents in suit. Exh. 6.
Shortly after serving the Original PICs, TPL realized the list of representative chips in the
text did not accurately list the chips for which claim charts were provided; and also that, unlike
TPL's accusations in the June 28 letter, inadvertently failed to expressly accuse the chip families
for which the accused representative chips were representative. Cook ¶ 7.
3.

TPL's Proposed First Corrected PICs, July 27 Version

On July 27, 2006, TPL sent Defendants a letter [Exh. 7] to which was attached proposed
Corrected Disclosure Of Asserted Claims And Preliminary Infringement Contentions ("First
Corrected PICs, July 27 version") [Exh. 8], notifying Defendants of the error, which it proposed
to correct with the proposed First Corrected PICs, July 27 Version [d.], and requesting that the
Defendants consent to these corrections or meet and confer by telephone the following day.
Exh. 7.
4.

The Parties Meet and Confer on July 28

The Defendants would not consent and, instead, all attended a July 28 meet and confer in
which they raised two categories of objections. First, they objected to the prejudice they might
suffer if TPL were permitted to correct its Original PICs. In response, TPL made several
proposals to eliminate any potential prejudice, and offered to consider any counterproposals.
Cook ¶ 9. For example, in response to the Defendants' objection that they would have less time
to produce documents for the chip families than to produce documents for the representative
chips listed in the Original PICs, TPL pointed out that the deadline for substantial compliance
with Defendants' document production obligations was not until October 3, 2006. Cook ¶ 10.
TPL offered, however, to stipulate to any reasonable necessary extension of that deadline with

-5-

Case 2:05-cv-00494-TJW Document 222 Filed 03/26/07 Page 10 of 21 PageID #: 8734

regard to documents for the chip families. Id. The Defendants did not accept any of TPL's
prejudice-mitigating proposals, and made no counterproposals. Cook ¶ 11.
Some of the Defendants also objected that the identification of chip families was not
precise enough; and all objected that TPL had provided claim charts for only representative
chips, rather than for each chip. Cook ¶ 12. TPL understood that the first objection could be
overcome by a more precise identification of chip families, but that Defendants would persist in
their objection to providing claim charts for only representative chips. Id. Consequently, TPL
began preparing its contested motion. Id.
5.

TPL's August 14 Version of Proposed First Corrected PICs

To prepare its motion, TPL modified the First Proposed Corrected PICs, July 27 Version
to eliminate the Defendants' objections as to lack of precision, by preparing exhibits consisting of
the Defendants' own Web pages which listed the part numbers of all chips in each of the accused
chip families. Cook ¶ 13; Exh. 9 ("First Proposed Corrected PICs, August 14 Version").
6.

TPL's August 14 Motion To Correct Preliminary Infringement
Contentions

Upon completion of its First Proposed Corrected PICs, August 14 Version [id.], TPL
filed a motion for leave to serve same. Cook ¶ 14; Doc. # 96, filed 8/14/2006. The "First
Corrected PICs, August 14 Version" now included (1) a revised list of representative accused
chips, conforming to the chips for which claim charts had been provided; (2) an explicit
accusation of infringement of the chip families to which the representative chips belong; and (3)
a more precise identification of the family members, by providing copies of the Defendants' Web
pages identifying those family members. Id.
To show that TPL's omission in the text of the Original PICs was unintentional, and did
not prejudice the Defendants, TPL pointed to the June 27 and 28 Letters [Exhs. 2 and 4] which
provided a comparable list of representative chips, and made clear that TPL was accusing the

Case 2:05-cv-00494-TJW Document 222 Filed 03/26/07 Page 11 of 21 PageID #: 8735

representative chips as well as the chip families to which they belonged. Doc. # 96, p. 5; see also
doc. # 122, p. 4.
TPL also explained that focusing on representative chips would be the most reasonable
and efficient way to deal with the large number of infringing products, especially since the chips
in any given family differed from one another only by features (such as package type and the
like) wholly irrelevant to infringement. Id.
7.

Defendants' Oppositions and TPL's Reply

Although each made slightly different arguments, all Defendants asserted that TPL
should not be allowed to amend its PICs to assert infringement of entire chip families based on
claim charts for only representative chips.
In its reply brief [Doc. # 122, filed 9/7/2006 ("Reply Brief")], TPL defended its use of
representative chips as a benefit to all parties because discovery could be limited to the
representative chips rather than to all chips accused of infringement. Id. at pp. 3, 4. TPL also
reasonably proposed that if a Defendant were to decide that any family subgroup materially
differed from an alleged representative chip, the Defendant could so state, identify all chips
within that subgroup, and provide discovery as to a representative chip within the subgroup. Id.
at p. 14.
In addition, TPL noted that MEI's opposition recognized the propriety of, including case
authority for, using representative chips. Id. at p. 3.
8.

The Court's November 7 Order Denying TPL's Motion Without
Prejudice.

By order dated November 7, 2006, this Court denied TPL's Motion To Correct PICs

"without prejudice to filing7 amended [PICs] that include infringement contentions for each
accused product as required under the local rules." Doc. # 162, p. 2.
B.

TPL Prepares Claim Charts for All Accused Family Members

Upon receipt of the November 7 Order, TPL immediately began preparation of claim
charts for all accused chips -- a large task due to the number of accused chips. Cook ¶ 21.
C.

On December 22, TPL Provided Defendants with A Proposed Motion For
Leave to File Amended Preliminary Infringement Contentions, Followed
Shortly by the Claim Charts

Because TPL understood the November 7 Order as implicit leave for TPL to serve
amended PICs listing all accused family member chips, TPL provided Defendants with a draft of
the proposed amended PICs and a draft of the present motion [Exh. 10] on December 22,
requesting that Defendants consent to the proposed amended PICs. Cook, ¶ 22. TPL Fed-Exed
CD-ROMs containing the claim charts to Defendants on December 26. Id. These are the
identical claim charts for which leave to serve is presently sought.
Defendants did not agree that the November 7 Order provided implicit consent for TPL to
serve amended PICs and claim charts, and said they could not evaluate Plaintiffs' request without
reviewing the extensive claim charts. Cook ¶ 23. Moreover, since they said they could not do so
over the holidays, they requested and Plaintiffs agreed to postpone filing the present motion and
attend a meet and confer on January 8, eventually rescheduled to January 9. Id.
D.

The Parties Meet and Confer on January 9.

In the meet and confer, Defendants said the motion argued that there would be no
prejudice because Defendants had been informed that family members were accused of

7

Since the local rules require preliminary infringement contentions to be served, but not filed,
TPL understands the order to refer to service of amended to infringement contentions.

infringement as early as June 2006, but that the December 26 claim charts appeared to accuse
chips falling outside of the June families. Cook ¶ 24. Although TPL explained that it did not
intend the December 26 claim charts to expand beyond the previously accused families,
Defendants asked TPL to demonstrate correspondence between the previously identified families
and the chips accused of infringement (via claim charts) in December. Id.
E.

TPL Prepares and Provides Information Requested By Defendants.

On February 9, 2007, as requested, TPL sent Defendants a spreadsheet providing the
requested correlation between the presently accused chips and the previously accused families,
stating that TPL believed it had provided all of the information that the Defendants needed to
make decisions as to whether or not to oppose the proposed motion to amend PICs, suggesting
that the parties reconsider using representative chips for discovery and trial, and requesting
Defendants to provide their decision by February 13, 2007. Exhs. 11, 12; Cook ¶¶ 25, 26.
F.

NEC Agrees To Proceed on the Basis of Representative Parts, and Proposes
Terms of a Proposed "Stipulation to Be Entered by the Parties".

On February 18, NEC wrote that was interested in the representative chip proposal, and
said, "Assuming that we have reached closure on the product list and representative products,
NEC Electronics would like to confirm the terms of the stipulation to be entered by the parties.
NEC Electronics believes that the parties should include the following agreed terms in the
stipulation: [setting forth specific terms]." Exh. 13; Cook ¶ 27. After TPL responded to these
terms [Exh. 14], the parties held a meet and confer on March 13, in which they discussed their
various positions and any objections to the proposed representative part stipulation. Cook ¶ 27.
TPL has worked to overcome the objections of NEC and Toshiba [Id.; Exhs. 15, 16] and believes
that stipulations will be reached with these parties well in advance of the time for them to
respond to the present motion. Cook ¶ 27.

Case 2:05-cv-00494-TJW Document 222 Filed 03/26/07 Page 14 of 21 PageID #: 8738

However, MEI now flatly refuses to consent to the present motion, and refuses to
consider a representative parts stipulation. Cook, ¶ 29.
III.

GOOD CAUSE EXISTS TO PERMIT PLAINTIFFS TO CORRECT THEIR
PRELIMINARY INFRINGEMENT CONTENTIONS
A.

The Applicable Law.

Patent Rule 3-1 requires a party claiming patent infringement to serve a disclosure of
asserted claims and infringement contentions ("preliminary infringement contentions"8). Patent
Rule 3-1(c) provides that these contentions shall include, inter alia, "each accused apparatus,
product, device, process, method, act, or other instrumentality ('Accused Instrumentality') of
each opposing party of which the party is aware …" as well as "[a] chart identifying specifically
where each element of each asserted claim is found within each Accused Instrumentality … ."
As MEI has recognized, however, the Northern District of California, which uses the same
Patent Local Rules as the Eastern District of Texas, allows a party asserting patent infringement
to serve a single claim chart for a family of products when the single claim chart is representative
of all products within the family. See Renesas Tech. Corp. v. Nanya Tech. Corp., No. C0305709JFHRL, 2004 WL 2600466 (N.D. Cal., Nov. 10, 2004).
In ALT, MD. v. Medtronic, Inc., 2006 WL 278868 (E.D.Tex. February 1, 2006), Judge
Davis stated the standard for deciding a motion to supplement pursuant to Patent Rule 3-7:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b) requires a showing of good
cause to modify dates set forth in the Court's scheduling order.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b) (providing, in part, "a schedule [scheduling
order] shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause

8

Recent amendments to the Patent Rules drop the word "preliminary;" however, since the
present motion pertains to events and filings dating back prior to the amendment, TPL has
continued to refer to "PICs" and "preliminary infringement contentions" to avoid confusion.

Case 2:05-cv-00494-TJW Document 222 Filed 03/26/07 Page 15 of 21 PageID #: 8739

and by leave of the district court…."). Patent Rules are considered
part of the Court's scheduling order; therefore, a party seeking
relief must obtain the Court's leave on a good cause showing to
modify the Patent Rule's deadlines. Patent Rule 3-7 incorporates
Rule 16(b)'s cause standard by stating amendment or modification
of the Preliminary or Final Infringement Contentions or the
Preliminary or Final Invalidity Contentions … may be made only
by order of the Court, which shall be entered only upon a showing
of good cause. The good cause standard requires the party seeking
relief to show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite
the diligence of the party needing the extension. A trial court has
broad discretion in allowing scheduling order modifications. The
Court should consider four factors when determining whether to
allow a scheduling order modification: (1) the explanation for the
failure to meet the deadline; (2) the importance of the thing that
would be excluded; (3) potential prejudice in allowing the thing
that would be excluded; and (4) the availability of a continuance
to cure such prejudice.
Id. at *2 (emphasis added, internal quotations and citations omitted.)
As shown below, TPL has demonstrated the requisite good cause for amending its PICs.
B.

Why TPL Did Not Provide Claim Charts For All Accused Chips Prior To
The Original Deadline

TPL filed its Original PICs without including claim charts for every accused product
because, in view of the large number of accused products, it reasonably believed all parties
would benefit by using claim charts for representative products rather than for all accused
products, and that providing claim charts for all accused products would merely add bulk without
adding useful information. Accordingly, TPL believed that using claim charts for representative
parts was a rational and practical way to streamline an otherwise complicated case. Moreover,
TPL's counsel had advantageously employed representative parts in other semiconductor patent
infringement litigation; and there is sound case authority for this approach in the Northern
District of California, which employs essentially the same local rules as this district. Indeed,
MEI acknowledged the reasonableness of TPL's approach, citing Northern District of California

Case 2:05-cv-00494-TJW Document 222 Filed 03/26/07 Page 16 of 21 PageID #: 8740

case authority [doc. # 108, p. 5], arguing only that in this particular case TPL had not
demonstrated that it was appropriate to use representative parts. Cook ¶ 16.
Presumably in view of TPL's good faith belief that using representative parts was in
reasonable compliance with the Patent Local Rules, this Court denied TPL 's original request
without prejudice to serving amended PICs in compliance with the Local Rules. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs are now requesting explicit leave to serve the claim charts and amended PICs, each of
which were provided to Defendants in December.
C.

The Importance Of The Thing That Would Be Excluded

If the family member chips were excluded, this litigation would not resolve the entire
dispute between the parties. Further proceedings, such as additional patent infringement lawsuits
or contempt proceedings, would be necessary to fully adjudicate plaintiffs' infringement claims.
It would be wasteful of judicial and party resources if plaintiffs were required to assert
infringement by the remaining members of a chip family in a second lawsuit involving identical
parties in which the identical patents and identical claims would be asserted.
Moreover, Defendants assert that these claims, if not included in any judgment resulting
from the present lawsuit, would be barred from assertion in later proceedings by res judicata.
While plaintiffs disagree with this assessment, if Defendants are correct, this would reduce the
value of plaintiffs' claim by orders of magnitude, further evidencing the importance of the claims
which would be excluded if the proposed amendment were denied.

There Is No Prejudice To Defendants In Allowing The Amended Preliminary
Infringement Contentions

Trial is scheduled for November 3, 2007, more than seven months away. As a result,
permitting plaintiffs to correct its PICs will not necessitate a continuance of the trial.
Defendants have known that TPL was broadly accusing the presently accused chips,

albeit identified by families rather than part numbers, since June 28, 2006. Moreover, lest
Defendants were then confused as to which part numbers are within the designated families, TPL
has since provided copies of web pages listing the specific part numbers in August, and lists of
specific part numbers in December.
Rather than suffer prejudice, Defendants have benefited by the delay, to plaintiffs'
prejudice. For example, because Defendants have known since June 28, 2006 that TPL is
accusing entire families of chips, rather than just a few representative chips, they have been able
to use this information in preparing their invalidity contentions, and in submitting requests for reexamination of the patents-in-suit to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.9
As another example, in January, the parties exchanged proposed Markman
interpretations, and earlier this month Plaintiffs filed their opening Markman brief. As a result of
the Defendants' refusal to provide discovery with regard to the family member chips, Defendants
had the benefit of detailed knowledge concerning the accused family members in preparing their
proposed claim interpretations; whereas Plaintiffs were deprived of this detailed information in
preparing their proposed claim interpretations.
If, after receiving TPL’s Original PICs, Defendants were unsure as to whether TPL was
accusing the families of chips of infringement, Defendants should have contacted TPL for
clarification. Instead, however, Defendants allowed time to pass. Thus, Defendants cannot now
claim that TPL’s delay in submitting complete PICs somehow prejudiced them. In Orion IP,
LLC v. Staples, Inc., 407 F.Supp.2d 815 (E.D.Tex. 2006), Judge Davis refused to allow a

NEC submitted requests for re-examination of all three patents in suit on September 21, 2006.
Toshiba submitted requests for re-examination of two out of three of the patents in suit on
October 19, 2006.

Defendant to claim prejudice when it failed to clarify a purported ambiguity in plaintiff’s PICs
and plaintiff’s discovery requests indicated the scope of the accused products (in Orion, a
website) was broader than that which was specifically identified in the PIC.
While the Patent Rules place a [sic] heavy burden on plaintiffs to
communicate their case to defendants so that both parties may
adequately prepare for claim construction and trial, defendants also
have a responsibility to make sure they fully understand the nature
of plaintiffs’ allegations. A defendant cannot lay behind the log
until late in the case and then claim it lacks notice as to the scope
of the case or infringement contentions. Orion’s PICs were
sufficient to put Toyota on notice that Orion intended to accuse
more than just the website’s “Model Selector” feature. Toyota
knew, or should have known, this and could have easily sought
clarification either informally or by motion. It did neither, and
now seeks to use its alleged lack of clarification to its advantage at
this stage of the proceeding. To the extent Toyota was confused as
to the extent of the website PICs, most of the responsibility is
Toyota’s. Toyota admits it had discovery disputes with Orion as a
result of the parties’ different understandings of the scope of
Orion’s PICs, yet Toyota did not seek clarification of Orion’s
PICs. The Patent Rules intend to strike a balance of providing fair
notice to defendants without requiring unrealistic, overly factual
contentions from plaintiffs, but the burden of notice the Patent
Rules place on plaintiffs is intended to be a shield for defendants,
not a sword.
Id. at 817-18 (emphasis added.)
In keeping with the policy expressed by Judge Davis, Defendants may not use the Patent
Rules as a sword. By virtue of TPL's June 27 and June 28, 2006 letters, Defendants knew or
should have known that TPL was accusing the families of chips of infringement and were
explicitly told that the original PICs were intended to so assert a mere 10 days after the service of
the Original PICs. The prejudice to Plaintiffs if not permitted to correct the PICs as requested far
outweighs any prejudice to the Defendants as a result of the corrections.
In addition, Defendants' primary concern in opposing TPL's Motion To Correct PICs was
that claim charts for representative chips were not in fact representative of claim charts for their

corresponding chip families for purposes of infringement. By providing claim charts for all of
the accused products, this concerned is obviated.
Moreover, the proposed amendment will clarify any confusion that may presently exist as
to which products are being accused of infringing which claims of the patents-in-suit.
Thus, the present Motion To Amend PICs will actually eliminate, rather than cause,
prejudice to the Defendants.
E.

Only MEI Flatly Opposes the Proposed Amended PICs

After initially acknowledging the appropriateness of using representative parts [doc. #
108, p. 5 ("Of course, it would be acceptable to provide a single chart for a series of products
when there is a fair basis to believe that the separate products are the same for purposes of
infringement."); TPL Reply, doc. # 122, p. 3], and seeming to participate in the representative
parts discussions,10 MEI now flatly refuses a negotiated resolution of the present motion.
IV.

CONCLUSION
TPL requests explicit leave to serve the proposed amended PICs and claim charts

provided to Defendants in December, as permitted by this Court's November 7 Order.
