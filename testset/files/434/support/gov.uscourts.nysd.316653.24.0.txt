Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6) and the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4, et seq (“PSLRA”), Defendants
Wyeth, Robert Essner, Bernard Poussot, Joseph Mahady, Kenneth Martin, Robert Ruffolo, Jr.,
M.D., and Ginger Constantine, M.D. move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Complaint for
Violations of the Federal Securities Laws in its entirety and with prejudice.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This case is the most recent example of plaintiffs trying to manufacture a federal
securities fraud claim out of statements about a new drug made by a pharmaceutical company
during the federal regulatory approval process. As recently as last week, the Honorable Thomas
P. Griesa, in granting a motion to dismiss, stated that courts will dismiss fraud claims where
plaintiffs seek to exploit the vagaries of the regulatory process:
The cases recognize that, particularly in the testing and development stage, the
possible beneficial effects of a drug may be accompanied by adverse side effects,
and there may be uncertainty as to how the risk-benefit balance ultimately turns
out, and how it will be viewed by regulators. But if the management of the
company releases positive reports about the drug to the public along the way
which the management honestly believes to be true, and where there is no reckless
disregard for truth, then that is not securities fraud, even though at a later point
some event occurs which prevents the marketing of the drug or makes it necessary
to take the drug off the market.
In re AstraZeneca Sec. Litig., No. 05 Civ. 2688, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43680, at *42-43
(S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2008). Here, Defendants' statements amount to nothing more than optimism
and forward-looking statements about a new drug going through the federal approval process.
The statements were not guarantees. They were not falsely made. And they are not actionable.
This case concerns the drug Pristiq, which Wyeth is developing for two uses: the
treatment of vasomotor symptoms (“VMS”) or “hot flushes” in menopausal women, and the
treatment of major depressive disorder (“MDD”) in adults. In January 2007, Wyeth received an
“approvable” letter from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for Pristiq’s MDD
1

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 8 of 43

indication. A year later, in February 2008, the FDA approved Pristiq for the treatment of MDD,
and the drug has been available for that use in pharmacies since May 2008.
In July 2007, Wyeth received an approvable letter for Pristiq’s VMS indication.
Because of potential side effects observed in one of Wyeth’s clinical trials, the letter required
Wyeth to conduct an additional study before the FDA would approve Pristiq for the treatment of
VMS. As a result, Pristiq is not expected to be eligible for FDA approval for VMS until
sometime in 2010. Wyeth immediately announced receipt of the VMS approvable letter, and
Wyeth’s stock price fell.
Rewriting history, Plaintiffs now claim that Defendants made fraudulent
statements about the chances of receiving FDA approval for the VMS indication and concealed
data about the adverse events from one of four clinical studies submitted to the FDA (“Study
315”). But this is no more than an accusation that Defendants committed fraud based on
hindsight, which courts routinely reject as a basis for alleging securities claims, especially in
pharmaceutical cases involving new drug applications. Defendants believed at the time, and
continue to believe, that Pristiq is a safe and effective treatment for VMS. While Defendants
were obviously aware of (and disclosed) the results of Study 315 during the application process,
they simply had no control over the way in which the FDA would respond to this data.
Indeed, Defendants repeatedly warned investors in their SEC filings and public
statements that they could not control or guarantee regulatory actions and that the FDA may
disagree with the Company about drug approval. Wyeth’s 2005 Form 10-K warns that “[t]he
development and commercialization of novel drugs requires significant expenditures with a low
probability of success.” Chepiga Aff. Ex. 1. Wyeth also told its shareholders:
Notably, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and, even when
we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product

2

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 9 of 43

candidate or a new indication for an existing product, regulatory authorities may
not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval
altogether.
Id. Moreover, even Plaintiffs admit that the regulatory environment for new drug approval was
tightening and difficult to predict. The Complaint alleges that it was “well known” that Wyeth
was “operating in a climate where markedly fewer drugs had been approved in the past five years
as compared to the five years prior, and far more drugs were being rejected in the later stages of
development than ever before.” Compl. ¶ 10. Given this environment, Defendants cannot be
faulted for not knowing what action the FDA would take, much less be accused of fraud.
As a legal matter, the Complaint fails to allege securities fraud under Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and SEC Rule
10b-5 for four independent reasons. First, Defendants’ statements were forward-looking and
thus protected from liability. The statements regarding Pristiq’s future were accompanied by
cautionary language, constituted expressions of corporate optimism, and were not made with any
knowledge that the statements were false or misleading. As such, they are entitled to immunity
under both the PSLRA and the common law “bespeaks caution” doctrine. In addition, the safety
data that Defendants allegedly hid was fully disclosed to the FDA, doctors, market watchers, and
analysts. Indeed, during the Class Period an industry analyst expressly reported on Pristiq’s
adverse event data and their potential impact on the drug’s approvability in an investor report
entitled “WYE: How Will the ‘New’ FDA Handle Pristiq?” This information had no effect on
the Company’s stock price. Accordingly, this alleged omission cannot form the basis of a valid
claim.
Second, Plaintiffs’ scienter case is completely implausible. The Complaint asserts
that Defendants acted in order to temporarily inflate Wyeth’s stock price and maintain the

3

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 10 of 43

illusion that Pristiq was a blockbuster drug that would replace medicines losing patent protection.
But it does not make any sense that Defendants would seek to address long-term
revenue/pipeline concerns with the investment community by fraudulently touting a drug that it
knew the FDA would act negatively on in the very near-term. Moreover, it is well established
that general corporate motives to keep up a company’s share price are inadequate as a matter of
law to support a securities fraud claim. Plaintiffs also try to distort the facts regarding
Defendants’ stock sales to paint a picture of insider trading. The real figures indicate that neither
the timing nor volume of Defendants’ stock sales was suspicious or unusual. Moreover, the
publicly-known facts about Defendants’ stock holdings directly undermine Plaintiffs’ “motive”
allegations. The individual Defendants hold significant portions of their share holdings in longterm trusts (that they cannot access until retirement) and were awarded significant stock grants
late in the Class Period that they could only exercise at the then existing price of $56/share.
Given both of these facts, it would have been detrimental to Defendants’ personal interests to
temporarily inflate Wyeth’s share price and set the Company up for an inevitable fall in July
2007. Under Tellabs’ teaching, the Complaint fails because the alleged fraud scheme here does
not make any sense.
Third, the Complaint does not allege loss causation. The alleged omissions
regarding the Study 315 data could not have moved the market down in July, because they were
actually disclosed to the market in May. That information had no material effect on the
Company’s stock price then and was fully absorbed into the market as of May 2007. The
announcement that caused the Company’s stock price to fall was Wyeth’s July 24, 2007 press
release indicating that the FDA issued an approvable letter, as opposed to an approval letter, for
VMS. Defendants cannot be held responsible on fraud grounds for this loss: for months the

4

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 11 of 43

Company’s disclosures had alerted the public that the FDA would be making a decision and that
the Company could not control the outcome.
Fourth, the Complaint fails to plead essential elements of a claim under Section
20(a) for “control person” liability. Because the Complaint fails to assert a viable claim under
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and does not give rise to any inference that Defendants culpably
participated in the fraud, the Section 20(a) claim also fails.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

The Development of Pristiq
In December 2005, Wyeth submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the

FDA for approval for Pristiq for the treatment of MDD. Chepiga Aff. Ex. 2. On January 22,
2007, the Company received an “approvable” letter from the FDA.1 Id. Ex. 3. The Company
complied with the requirements laid out in the approvable letter, and in February 2008, received
an FDA approval letter, approving Pristiq for the treatment of MDD in adults. Id. Ex. 4. In May
2008, Pristiq became fully available at pharmacies in the United States for the treatment of
MDD.2
While the MDD application was progressing, Wyeth also sought approval from
the FDA for a VMS indication for Pristiq. As part of its drug testing, Wyeth conducted several
clinical trials, including four Phase III studies.3 Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6; see also Chepiga Aff. Exs. 5-8.

1

The FDA, upon completing review of an NDA, will issue one of three letters: an approval letter, an
approvable letter, or a not approvable letter. See 21 C.F.R. §§ 314.105, 314.110, 314.120 (2008). The FDA will
issue an “approvable letter” when it wants “to indicate to the applicant that the application . . . is basically
approvable providing certain issues are resolved.” Id. § 314.110(a).

For a drug manufacturer to receive approval from the FDA to market a new drug, the company must first
conduct three phases of clinical trials “designed to assess the safety and efficacy” of the product. In re Elan Corp.
Sec. Litig., 543 F. Supp. 2d 187, 195-96 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). “During Phase I, the drug is administered to a small
number of healthy participants in order to determine the proper dosage of the drug, to characterize its metabolism
and excretion, and to identify acute side effects. Phase II trials include patients who suffer from the medical
condition the drug is designed to treat; these trials are used to gather safety data and preliminary efficacy data. If the

In one of these four, Study 315, five women out of 689 (or 0.73%) suffered adverse
cardiovascular events. Compl. ¶ 25. The Complaint correctly admits that Wyeth reported these
events to the FDA promptly. Id. ¶ 27. Wyeth subsequently conducted three additional Phase III
trials for VMS: Studies 319, 321, and 337. Chepiga Aff. Exs. 6-8.
On June 26, 2006, the Company submitted its NDA for Pristiq for the treatment of
VMS, Chepiga Aff. Ex. 9, which contained all the safety data from Study 315, Compl. ¶ 25.
Throughout the Class Period Wyeth regularly reported about Pristiq’s status. Id. ¶¶ 24-27.
Wyeth was hopeful about its chances of receiving approval, but also repeatedly cautioned the
market that it had no control over the FDA’s regulatory decision. For example, its 2006 Form
10-K, filed with the SEC in February 2007, stated:
We have multiple product candidates in development and devote considerable
resources to research and development activities, including clinical trials. These
activities involve a high degree of risk and take many years. . . . Our product
candidates in late-stage development include . . . PRISTIQ (for the treatment of
vasomotor symptoms). . . . Our product development efforts with respect to any
product candidate may fail or be delayed, and we may be unable to commercialize
it or be delayed in commercializing it, for multiple reasons.
Chepiga Aff. Ex. 1.
On July 23, 2007, Wyeth received an approvable letter from the FDA for VMS
(as it had for MDD, albeit for different reasons). Id. Ex. 10. The letter was not a rejection or
denial of approval. In most instances an approvable letter serves “as a mechanism for resolving
outstanding issues on drugs that are about to be approved and marketed.” 21 C.F.R. §
314.110(a) (emphasis added). The letter stated that before the FDA could approve Pristiq for
VMS, the Company would need to conduct an additional study to generate data about potential

results of Phase II trials suggest that the drug is safe and effective, Phase III trials investigate the effects of the drug
in a much larger patient population.” Id. at 196.

The Statements at Issue
The Complaint selectively isolates various forward-looking statements made in

press releases, industry conferences, SEC filings, and conference calls between June 26, 2006
and July 24, 2007 (the “Class Period”) as false and misleading. See Compl. ¶¶ 62-106. These
statements pertain to the hoped-for FDA approval of Pristiq and its revenue-generating potential,
if approved. The Complaint alleges that at the time these statements were made, Defendants
were in possession of, but failed to disclose, the results of Study 315 and the exclusion criteria
for Studies 319 and 321.5 Compl. ¶¶ 31, 39, 67, 78, 84, 90, 95, 105.
Each of the press releases, SEC filings, conference presentations, and conference
calls referenced in the Complaint heavily cautioned and made clear to investors that Defendants’
statements about Pristiq were subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ. In other words, Wyeth was not (and given the nature of the regulatory process, could not
be) promising any particular result or outcome. The following is example cautionary language
from a Wyeth press release:
The statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements based on current expectations of future events and are subject
to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or implied by such statements. In particular, the statements in
this press release regarding clinical data and/or the regulatory status of our
4

The Complaint alleges that Wyeth has not started the new study called for by the FDA approvable letter
and suggests that Defendants never believed in the approvability of Pristiq for VMS. Compl. ¶ 120. Plaintiffs are
wrong. As indicated in Wyeth’s SEC filings, the new study is on track, and Wyeth continues to plan for Pristiq’s
ultimate approval for the VMS indication. See Chepiga Aff. Ex. 3 (“We have been in discussions with the FDA
regarding the approvable letter and the requested clinical trial. The trial currently under consideration would take 18
months or more to complete, and we expect that the study will begin in mid-2008, pending final FDA concurrence
on the study protocol.”).
5
The Complaint alleges that Defendants manipulated and hid the exclusion criteria for Studies 319 and 321,
but these exclusion criteria were reviewed and approved by the FDA, were established before the conclusion of
Study 315, and were publicly disclosed well before the Class Period. See Chepiga Aff. Exs. 6, 7.

pipeline products are based on a preliminary analysis of the data and our
expectations as to how that data will impact the regulatory approval process,
which is subject to risks and uncertainties related to both the timing and
success of regulatory approval.
See Chepiga Aff. Ex. 1 (emphasis added). A chart of additional cautionary language found in
press releases, conference calls, SEC filings, and conference presentations is attached hereto as
Appendix A.
The Complaint also includes the erroneous allegation that Defendants did not
disclose the Study 315 adverse event data or the exclusion criteria for Studies 319 and 321
during the Class Period. Compl. ¶¶ 31, 39, 67, 78, 84, 90, 95, 105. Because this allegation is
contradicted by documents that the Court may appropriately consider on a motion to dismiss, the
Court does not have to accept it as true. For example, prior to the Class Period, the exclusion
criteria for Studies 319 and 321 were posted on an online clinical trials database maintained by
the United States National Institute of Health.6 See Chepiga Aff. Exs. 6, 7. Wyeth also reported
on the efficacy and safety data for Study 315 at the 55th Annual Clinical Meeting of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) in May 2007, and this
information was reported by a research analyst with the Prudential Equity Group (“Prudential”).7
See id. Exs. 11, 12. The Prudential analyst identified Study 315 safety data as a known risk, but
not a risk that, in his view, was likely to interfere with FDA approval. Significantly, the
disclosure of this information had no effect on Wyeth’s stock price. See id. Ex. 13.

Complaint does not allege that Dr. Constantine did so.
The majority of the Selling Defendants’ stock sales were made in October 2006,

months before receipt of the FDA’s approvable letter. See Compl. ¶¶ 125-129. These sales also
followed the Company’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday, October 19, 2006, and were
clustered during Tuesday through Friday of the following week (October 24 through October 27,

conclusions, deductions, or opinions couched as factual allegations a . . . presumption of
truthfulness.’” In re NYSE Specialists Sec. Litig., 503 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting United
States v. Bonanno Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, 879 F.2d 20, 27 (2d Cir. 1989)).
As the Supreme Court recently explained, “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his
‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of
the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 196465 (2007). “[T]he touchstone for adequate pleading is plausibility. . . . Thus, materials properly
before the court must provide grounds for more than mere speculation or suspicion that a
plaintiff is entitled to the requested relief.” In re Take-Two Interactive Sec. Litig., No. 06 Civ.
803, 2008 WL 1757823, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2008); see also ATSI, 493 F.3d at 98.
Securities fraud claims are subject not only to these universal pleading
requirements, but also to the heightened pleading standards imposed by Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA. Rule 9(b) dictates that the “[i]n alleging fraud . . . a party must
state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Pursuant to
the PSLRA, in an action for money damages requiring proof of scienter, the complaint must
“state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the
required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2) (2008). “The Supreme Court has . . . instructed
that a complaint should survive a motion to dismiss ‘only if a reasonable person would deem the
inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw
from the facts alleged.’” In re FBR Inc. Sec. Litig., 544 F. Supp. 2d 346, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)
(quoting Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S. Ct. 2499, 2510 (2007)).
In deciding a motion to dismiss, a court may consider the complaint, “statements
or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, legally required public disclosure

documents filed with the SEC, and documents possessed by or known to plaintiff and upon
which it relied in bringing suit.” ATSI, 493 F.3d at 98. The court may also consider “matters
subject to judicial notice.” Take-Two, 2008 WL 1757823, at *6 (citing Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at
2509).
II.

THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS HAVE
NOT ALLEGED ANY ACTIONABLE STATEMENTS OR OMISSIONS
To state a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim, a plaintiff must allege that the

defendant “(1) made misstatements or omissions of material fact, (2) with scienter, (3) in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities, (4) upon which plaintiff relied, and (5) that
plaintiff’s reliance was a proximate cause of its injury.” ATSI, 493 F.3d at 105. Plaintiffs fail to
state a claim because Defendants’ alleged statements and omissions are not actionable.
Defendants’ statements are protected from liability under both the PSLRA’s statutory safe harbor
provision and the common law “bespeaks caution” doctrine. Defendants’ alleged omissions
were disclosed to the market and are immaterial as a matter of law.
A.

Defendants’ Forward-Looking Statements Are Protected From
Liability Under the PSLRA and the “Bespeaks Caution” Doctrine
Pursuant to the PSLRA, forward-looking statements that prove to be incorrect are

not actionable if they fall into any one of three “safe harbor” categories outlined in the statute:
The first protects forward-looking statements when they are identified as forwardlooking and “accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in
the forward-looking statement.” . . . The second statutory safe harbor protects
forward-looking statements when they are immaterial. . . . The third safe harbor
protects forward-looking statements unless the plaintiff can prove that the
statement “was made with actual knowledge by that person that the statement was
false or misleading.”
Kemp v. Universal Am. Fin. Corp., No. 05 Civ. 9883, 2007 WL 86942, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,
2007) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)). “[The] safe harbor [provision] is complemented by the

12

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Page 19 of 43

judicially-created ‘bespeaks caution’ doctrine, under which ‘alleged misrepresentations are
immaterial as a matter of law [if] it cannot be said that any reasonable investor could consider
them important in light of adequate cautionary language.’” Id. (quoting In re QLT Inc. Sec.
Litig., 312 F. Supp. 2d 526, 532 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)). Courts routinely find that statements issued
by drug manufacturers about the likelihood of FDA approval of a new drug—like the ones
alleged here—are non-actionable forward-looking statements. See, e.g., Noble Asset Mgmt. v.
Allos Therapeutics, Inc., No. 04 Civ. 1030, 2005 WL 4161977 (D. Colo. Oct. 20, 2005); In re
Bristol-Myers Squibb Sec. Litig., 312 F. Supp. 2d 549, 557-59 (S.D.N.Y. 2004); In re
Viropharma, Inc. Sec. Litig., No 02 Civ. 1627, 2003 WL 1824914 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 7, 2003); In re
Connetics Corp. Sec. Litig., No. 07-02940, 2008 WL 269467 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2008).
Defendants’ statements are protected from liability under all three categories of the PSLRA’s
safe-harbor provision and the “bespeaks caution” doctrine.
The PSLRA’s definition of “forward-looking statement” is broad. It includes
“plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans or objectives relating
to . . . products or services;” “projection of revenues;” “statement[s] of future economic
performance;” and “assumptions underlying or relating to” any forward-looking statement. 15
U.S.C. § 78u-5(i)(1) (2008); see also Fellman v. Electro Optical Sys. Corp., No. 98 Civ. 6403,
2000 WL 489713, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2000) (statements that a company “estimates a
long-term potential market size” and “is poised to become” a leader and that its “revenues and
earnings should build very rapidly” are “clearly” forward-looking). A copy of the pertinent
section of the PSLRA is attached hereto as Appendix B. Defendants’ statements, which pertain
to the hoped-for FDA approval of Pristiq, its future uses, and its revenue-generating potential,

13

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 20 of 43

fall squarely within this expansive definition of “forward-looking.” Examples of Wyeth’s
forward-looking statements include:
“[W]e predict that Pristiq has the potential to exceed $2 billion in peak sales.” (Compl.
¶ 74)
“FDA action . . . is anticipated in April 2007. Pristiq is expected to provide significant
relief of hot flushes.” (Compl. ¶ 77)
“If approved, Pristiq will be the first non-hormonal treatment indicated for relief of
VMS.” (Compl. ¶ 77)
“[Pristiq is] positioned also to be the first non-hormonal treatment approved for
vasomotor symptoms.” (Compl. ¶ 87)
See also Noble, 2005 WL 4161977, at *9 (“Projections about the likelihood of FDA approval are
forward-looking statements. . . and as such fall under the PSLRA’s safe harbor rule.”).
The first part of the PSLRA’s safe harbor rule protects forward-looking
statements that are accompanied by cautionary language “identifying important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.” 15 U.S.C.
§ 78u-5(c)(A)(i) (2008). The United States District Court for the District of Colorado held that a
pharmaceutical company cannot be held liable for projections about FDA approval of a
new drug where the company warns investors that it is not making any guarantees:
The Company's cautionary statements addressed the possibilities that test data
could be subject to varying interpretations, that the Company might not be able to
demonstrate efficacy, that a second Phase 3 trial might be necessary, and that
FDA approval might be delayed or not obtained at all. These statements are
sufficient to inform a reasonable investor about the uncertainties surrounding
FDA approval. Investors who purchased [Company] stock during the Class
Period had notice that a risk of investing was that the FDA might not approve [the
drug] in the near term or ever.
Noble, 2005 WL 4161977, at *9 (citation omitted).
Here, each of Defendants’ statements was accompanied by a substantial warning.
Cautionary language was written in each press release, SEC filing, and conference presentation
and read aloud at each conference call. For example:

14

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 21 of 43

The statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements based on current expectations of future events and are subject
to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or implied by such statements. In particular, the statements in
this press release regarding clinical data and/or the regulatory status of our
pipeline products are based on a preliminary analysis of the data and our
expectations as to how that data will impact the regulatory approval process,
which is subject to risks and uncertainties related to both the timing and
success of regulatory approval.
Chepiga Aff. Ex. 1 (emphasis added). Defendants also stated:
Our product development efforts . . . may fail or be delayed . . . for multiple
reasons, including . . . [i]nsufficient clinical trial data to support the safety and/or
effectiveness of the product candidate [and] our failure to obtain, or our
experiencing delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the
product candidate.
Id. This language warned investors that various events could prevent or delay FDA approval of
Pristiq for VMS. As a result, Defendants’ statements are protected from liability under the first
category of the PSLRA’s safe harbor provision.
Defendants’ statements are also protected under the second safe harbor category.
Irrespective of any cautionary language, the PSLRA protects forward-looking statements that are
“immaterial.” See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(ii) (2008). It is well-settled in the Second Circuit
that “[m]ere puffery or generalized expressions of optimism are immaterial as a matter of law.”
Kemp, 2007 WL 86942, at *11; see also Rombach v. Chang, 355 F.3d 164, 174 (2d Cir. 2004)
(“[E]xpressions of puffery and corporate optimism do not give rise to securities violations. Up to
a point, companies must be permitted to operate with a hopeful outlook.”) (citation omitted);
QLT, 312 F. Supp. 2d at 532. “Likewise, statements of opinion are insufficient to form the basis
of a misrepresentation or omission complaint under § 10(b).” Bristol-Myers, 312 F. Supp. 2d at
557.
Courts have specifically held that statements regarding the approval prospects and
projected success of a new drug constitute non-actionable puffery, opinion, and corporate
15

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Page 22 of 43

optimism. In Bristol-Myers, officers of a major drug manufacturer issued several positive
statements about the likely FDA approval of a new drug. 312 F. Supp. 2d at 557-59. Among the
statements issued by the company were that the drug had “real blockbuster potential” and
“represent[ed] one of the most exciting advances in cancer medicine.” Id. One company
executive said: “I don’t think it’s likely at all that this drug won’t get approved.” Id. Ultimately
the FDA failed to review the company’s drug application because the company’s data were
insufficient. Id. at 554. In rejecting investors’ claim for securities fraud, the court stated:
[The] statement regarding FDA approval cannot be considered a guarantee of
FDA approval or otherwise false or misleading. It predicts the action the
Company would take in the event the [application] was not approved and it
expresses personal optimism about regulatory events not under the Company's
control. Any reasonable investor reading these statements, or any of the other
statements regarding [the drug] complained of by Plaintiffs would recognize that
the Defendants could not and did not guarantee that [the drug] would be approved
by the FDA, either in the near term or at all.
Id. at 558; see also Viropharma, 2003 WL 1824914, at *6 (“The . . . report that merely stated the
company’s belief that [the drug] was on a strong track to approval is . . . immaterial because
investors should not rely on a company’s predictions about future actions of independent
government agencies.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).
Defendants’ statements are of the same sort. Indeed, they are far less bullish than
statements that have been found non-actionable in the cases cited above:
•

“[W]e think we have a package that could warrant approvability.” (Compl. ¶ 65)

•

“[W]e think [Pristiq] has very, very significant upside potential.” (Compl. ¶ 94)

•

“We expect these products will contribute to the growth of Wyeth for years to come.”
(Compl. ¶ 97)

These and other statements like them fall within the second category of the PSLRA’s safe harbor
rule and are not actionable under the securities laws.

16

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 23 of 43

Defendants’ statements are also protected under the third category of the
PSLRA’s safe harbor provision. Forward-looking statements are non-actionable where
“plaintiffs fail to prove that they were made with knowledge that the statements were false or
misleading.” In re Veeco Instruments, Inc. Sec. Litig., 235 F.R.D. 220, 235 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).
Statements about whether the FDA will approve a new drug (an outcome over which
pharmaceutical companies have no control) fall within these parameters. As one court
explained:
[The company] was forecasting a future event. Any alleged deficiencies in the
testing procedures do not indicate that [the company’s] prediction of an FDA
approval date was false when made. Instead, the company could have known of
problems in the testing procedures, planned to remedy those deficiencies, and still
thought it would achieve FDA approval by the estimated date. Clearly,
Defendants' prediction of a date for a regulatory decision over which they did not
have control, made that far in advance, for a drug that was still in the testing
stages, could not carry a guarantee of accuracy or reliability.
In re Syntex Corp. Sec. Litig., 95 F.3d 922, 930 (9th Cir. 1996). Plaintiffs cannot point to
anything indicating that Defendants knew at the time of their statements that the FDA would not
approve the drug in July 2007. The allegations in the Complaint demand the opposite
conclusion. If Defendants believed that the Study 315 safety data would preclude FDA approval
of the drug, they would not have continued to invest time and money in Studies 319 and 321. As
such, Defendants’ statements are not actionable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
Finally, Defendants’ statements are protected from liability under the judiciallycreated “bespeaks caution” doctrine, which preceded, but was not supplanted by, the PSLRA.
See Gavish v. Revlon, Inc., No. 00 Civ. 7291, 2004 WL 2210269, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30,
2004). Pursuant to the “bespeaks caution” doctrine, “alleged misrepresentations [that] are
accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements are considered immaterial as a matter of law.”
Veeco, 235 F.R.D., at 235. As discussed previously, each of Defendants’ statements was

17

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 24 of 43

accompanied by substantial cautionary language. See Appendix A. This language specifically
warned investors that FDA approval of Pristiq for VMS was subject to risks and uncertainties.
For all of the above-stated reasons, Defendants’ statements are not actionable under the securities
laws.
B.

Any Alleged Omissions Were Disclosed During the Class Period
and Are Immaterial as a Matter of Law
A plaintiff who bases a securities fraud claim on an omission must establish that

the alleged omission (1) was not disclosed and (2) is material. Here, Plaintiffs fail to do either.
Where an alleged omission was disclosed to the market, an investor cannot
maintain a claim for securities fraud. See In re Pfizer, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 06 Civ. 14199, 2008
WL 540120, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2008); see also In re Progress Energy, Inc. Sec. Litig., 371
F. Supp. 2d 548, 552-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“[I]t is indisputable that there can be no omission
where the allegedly omitted facts are disclosed. . . . [T]he securities laws do not require
disclosure of information that is publicly known.”) (citations omitted). “[T]he relevant question
is not whether the market ‘truly knew’ any specific piece of information, but [only] whether the
information was ‘reasonably available.’ Starr v. Georgeson S'holder, Inc., 412 F.3d 103, 110 (2d
Cir. 2005).
The Complaint repeatedly alleges that Defendants omitted four pieces of
information: (a) that use of Pristiq in Study 315 was associated with hepatic and cardiovascular
side effects; (b) that 27 women in the treatment group of Study 315 allegedly suffered severe
adverse events (“SAEs”) during the therapy or post-therapy periods; (c) that the incidence of
hypertension in the treatment group of Study 315 increased as the dose of Pristiq increased; and
(d) that Defendants excluded from two later studies (Studies 319 and 321) women with a history

of heart attack, chest pains, elevated blood pressure and blood clots.11 Compl. ¶¶ 67, 78, 84, 90,
95, 105. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ allegations, this information was disclosed to the market. Wyeth
openly reported information about its exclusion criteria for Studies 319 and 321 on the wellknown clinical trials website in 2005—a year-and-a-half before the Class Period even started—
and reported detailed efficacy and safety information from Study 315 at the 55th Annual Clinical
Meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. See Chepiga Aff. Exs. 6,
7, 11. The Study 315 data were subsequently discussed in an analyst report issued by Prudential
released on May 21, 2007.12 Chepiga Aff. Ex. 12. That report is particularly telling. It
discussed both the adverse event data of Study 315 and the differing eligibility criteria for Study
319 and Study 321. The analyst focused shareholders on the uncertainties associated with
Pristiq’s approval, wondering “whether a seemingly cautious FDA could cause a wrinkle in the
pending regulatory outcome.” Id. The report conjectured on possible outcomes:
The worst-case scenario would be a rejection of Pristiq for VMS, or substantial
additional delays, but the odds of this appear low. A more realistic worst case
scenario, in our view, is that Pristiq’s labeling has safety warnings that impact its
commercial potential, or that in the absence of a label change
prescribers/payors/patients at least view the product with less enthusiasm. . . .
Id. The analyst, with full knowledge of Study 315, ultimately concluded that FDA approval was
likely.13 Id.

Defendants note that Plaintiffs’ recitation of these alleged “omissions” is itself flawed, and the Court need
not accept Plaintiffs’ characterizations as true. First, Study 315 had only five patients with cardiovascular events.
Chepiga Aff. Ex. 12. Second, the 27 SAEs alleged by Plaintiffs include other events. Third, the FDA did not cite to
hypertension as a basis for issuing an approvable letter instead of an approval letter, so this issue is immaterial.
Chepiga Aff. Ex. 10. Fourth, as already mentioned, the exclusion criteria for Studies 319 and 321 were not created
as a “reaction” to Study 315’s outcomes. See Chepiga Aff. Exs. 6, 7. Rather, Studies 319 and 321 were designed as
part of Wyeth’s overall clinical plan for Pristiq testing; their exclusion criteria were reviewed and approved by the
FDA; and the studies began before the results of Study 315 were known.

Dr. Anderson’s report for Prudential shows that an analyst provided with the information that Plaintiffs
allege was not disclosed reached the same conclusions as the Company—namely, that the Study 315 data would not

The market’s lack of reaction to the May 21, 2007 analyst report indicates that the
alleged omissions are immaterial. It is widely recognized that when a company’s stock price,
operating in an efficient market, is unaffected by the disclosure of information, the omitted facts
are immaterial as a matter of law.14 See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d
1410, 1425 (3d Cir. 1997) (“In the context of an ‘efficient’ market, the concept of materiality
translates into information that alters the price of the firm's stock.”). Here, the Complaint admits
that “throughout the Class Period, Wyeth traded in an efficient market on the New York Stock
Exchange.” Compl. ¶ 51. In addition, following the release of the May 21, 2007 analyst report,
in which the allegedly withheld safety data were disclosed, Wyeth’s stock price stayed
essentially the same, as shown in the chart below. (Note that May 19 and 20, 2007 was a

III.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT ADEQUATELY ALLEGED SCIENTER
Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim is also subject to dismissal because

Plaintiffs fail to plead that Defendants acted with scienter. The law dictates that “the complaint
shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged . . . state with particularity facts giving rise to
a strong inference that the defendant acted with . . . intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.’”
ATSI, 493 F.3d at 99 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2)) (emphasis added). A plaintiff “may
satisfy this requirement by alleging facts (1) showing that the defendants had both motive and
opportunity to commit the fraud or (2) constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious
misbehavior or recklessness.” Id.
An inference of scienter is strong only if it is “cogent and at least as compelling
as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Tellabs, 127 S. Ct. at 2510
(emphasis added); see also In re Bayou Hedge Fund Litig., 534 F. Supp. 2d 405, 415 (S.D.N.Y.
2007). This inquiry is “inherently comparative;” in determining whether the pleaded facts give
rise to a strong inference of scienter, the court must take into account “plausible nonculpable
explanations for the defendant’s conduct.” Id. An inference that is merely “plausible” or
“reasonable” is insufficient and will not survive a motion to dismiss:

15

The May 21, 2007 analyst report thus underscores three important points: (a) the allegedly hidden
information was in fact disclosed; (b) the market fully understood the risks and uncertainties associated with the

Holding
Granted defendants’ motion to dismiss because there was “a
‘plausible nonculpable explanation’ for the defendants’
actions . . . more likely than any inference that the
defendants intended to manipulate the market . . .”
Dismissed plaintiffs’ securities fraud claim, because
“against [plaintiffs’] tenuous showing of [defendant’s]
scienter, the Court must weigh nonculpable explanations for
[defendant’s] conduct,” and plaintiffs’ “allegations
undermine any sinister reading of [that] conduct.”
Dismissed plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to raise an
inference of scienter “as compelling as the competing
inference” that defendants did not know their statements
were false.

As discussed below, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts giving rise to a plausible inference of scienter.
A.

Defendants’ Alleged Scheme to Defraud Is Implausible and
Less Compelling Than a Nonculpable Explanation for
Defendants’ Conduct
Although it is possible for a plaintiff to plead scienter by alleging facts showing a

defendant’s motive and opportunity to commit fraud, an alleged motive is insufficient unless it
meets certain criteria. First, the motive must be coherent; “allegations of irrational motive
cannot support a fraud claim.” Hampshire Equity Partners II, L.P. v. Teradyne, Inc., No. 04 Civ.
3318, 2005 WL 736217, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2005); see also In re Geopharma, Inc. Sec.
Litig., 411 F. Supp. 2d 434, 446 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2006) (“[T]he tenuous plausibility of the
alleged scheme substantially weakens the overall strength of plaintiffs’ scienter allegations.”).
Second, “motives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not
suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants
resulting from the fraud.” Geopharma, 411 F. Supp. 2d at 441 (citing Kalnit v. Eichler, 264 F.3d
131, 139 (2d Cir. 2001)). Third, pursuant to Tellabs, even where a plaintiff alleges a plausible,
personal motive, a claim must be dismissed where the alleged motive is less compelling than

FDA approval process; and (c) the Study 315 safety data had no effect on the Company’s stock price.

22

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

competing nonculpable explanations for defendants’ behavior. See. e.g., Take-Two, 2008 WL
1757823, at *22-24. Here, Defendants’ alleged motive fails on all three fronts: it is inconsistent,
ordinary, and less compelling than a nonculpable explanation for Defendants’ behavior.
Incoherent Theory
Defendants’ alleged liability is based on the assumption that Defendants knew
that the Study 315 safety data would prevent or delay FDA approval of Pristiq and intentionally
withheld this information from investors in order to temporarily increase Wyeth’s stock price
until the FDA announced its decision. This scheme is nonsensical. According to the Complaint,
Defendants chose to conceal information because “[h]ad defendants fully disclosed this
information . . . it would have cast serious doubts on the chances of FDA approval . . . and
damaged the Pristiq franchise.” Compl. ¶ 22. However, if Defendants knew that the FDA would
not approve Pristiq, the damage to Wyeth’s franchise would not be prevented, only delayed. The
Complaint itself alleges that Defendants disclosed the Study 315 data to the FDA. See id. ¶¶ 2527. And it would have been illogical for Defendants to continue to invest large amounts of time
and money in Studies 319 and 321 if they knew that the FDA would not approve Pristiq for
VMS. Moreover, Defendants knew that details of Pristiq’s safety profile would become public
when the FDA issued its decision; it makes no sense for Defendants to temporarily hide this
information and thereby risk the exact liability for failing to disclose it that Plaintiffs are trying to
assert here.
Indeed, Defendants would have been acting against their own economic selfinterest to intentionally submit an NDA to the FDA that they knew would not receive approval.
Defendants hold large amounts of stock in a Restricted Stock Trust (which they cannot access
until retirement), and thus have strong incentive to maximize long-term rather than short-term

23

Company stock price. See SEC Website. Defendants were also granted a substantial number of
stock options on April 26, 2007. Chepiga Aff. Ex. 16. These options could only be exercised at
the then-existing price of $56/share. Intentionally inflating the stock price prior to a grant of
options runs counter to the Individual Defendants’ self-interest. Defendants needed the share
price to rise after the options grant in order for their options to have any value. Concocting a
scheme to inflate the share price before an options grant in April 2007, knowing that it would fall
in July 2007, would only work to Defendants’ detriment. Defendants’ alleged motive is thus
incoherent and fails to raise a strong inference of scienter. See Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc.,
25 F.3d 1124, 1130 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding plaintiff’s alleged motive insufficient to survive a
motion to dismiss because “[i]t is hard to see what benefits accrue from a short respite from an
inevitable day of reckoning”).
Ordinary Corporate Motive
Second, the Complaint alleges the sort of universal corporate motive that courts
routinely find insufficient to support a fraud claim. It is well-settled that:
[A]lthough maintaining the appearance of corporate profitability . . . will involve
benefit to the corporation, allegations that defendants were motivated by those
desires in connection with making allegedly false statements are not sufficient to
support an inference of scienter. . . . [E]very publicly-held corporation desires
its stock to be priced highly by the market and to hold that allegations to that
effect were sufficient motive would be to render the motive requirement
meaningless.
Bristol-Meyers, 312 F. Supp. 2d at 560 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Courts have
specifically employed this principle to dismiss claims for securities fraud in cases involving new
drug trials. In Pfizer, a major drug manufacturer halted clinical trials of a developmental drug
after issuing positive statements about the drug’s safety and efficacy. 2008 WL 540120, at *2.
Plaintiffs attempted to plead motive for fraud by alleging that Pfizer wanted to “assure the
financial community of the existence of a new blockbuster drug.” Id. at *8. The Court held that
24

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 31 of 43

this alleged motive was insufficient to raise an inference of scienter: “This is not a unique
motive. Rather, it is a way of saying, in a manner tailored to a pharmaceutical company,
something that is true for all profit enterprises—each has an incentive to portray the likelihood
that it will continue to prosper.” Id.
Likewise, in Bristol-Myers, plaintiff tried to allege motive based on the
company’s desire to “maintain a façade of future potential” for its drug pipeline and to “address
potential concerns about patent expirations.” 312 F. Supp. 2d at 560-61. The court held that
these motives were “nothing more than ordinary and prudent corporate desires” and thus
insufficient to establish scienter under Section 10(b). Id.; see also In re Bayer AG Sec. Litig., 03
Civ. 1546, 2004 WL 2190357, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2004).
Plaintiffs’ Complaint is replete with the same clichés that investors have pleaded
in numerous securities cases against drug manufacturers—clichés that courts repeatedly find
insufficient to plead scienter:
Motives Courts Find Insufficient
“[A]ssure the financial community of the
existence of a new blockbuster drug”
(Pfizer)
“‘[M]aintain a façade of future potential’ for
the Company’s drug pipeline” (BristolMyers)
“Address potential concerns about patent
expirations” (Bristol-Myers)
“[M]ake it appear that the future of the
Company was more promising” (BristolMyers)

Allegations Here
Bring a “blockbuster” drug to market in
time to offset declining revenues (Compl.
¶ 21)
“[P]romote Wyeth’s drug pipeline”
(Compl. ¶ 16)
Face “loss of income from drugs set to go
off-patent” (Compl. ¶ 11)
“[S]ustain growth and profitability”
(Compl. ¶ 9)

Plaintiffs’ allegations are merely alternative ways of saying that the Company wanted to
maintain the appearance of profitability. As such, they do not give rise to an inference of
scienter, much less a strong one.

25

Unconvincing Motive Inference
Finally, Defendants’ alleged “scheme” falls far short of passing muster under
Tellabs. As discussed above, Tellabs requires a court to take into account plausible, nonculpable
explanations for a defendant’s conduct. Where the inference of scienter is less compelling than
an inference of innocent conduct, a plaintiff’s Section 10(b) claim will fail as a matter of law.
Here, the allegations in the Complaint overwhelmingly suggest that Defendants, rather than
hiding material information as part of an elaborate scheme to inflate Wyeth’s stock price, were
simply hopeful about the chances of FDA approval of Pristiq for VMS. Importantly, the
Company received an FDA approvable letter for MDD during the Class Period and was therefore
confident that the drug was on track for MDD approval, which it received in February 2008.
Compl. ¶¶ 18, 86; Chepiga Aff. Ex. 3. See AstraZeneca, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43680, at *47
(“The approval of [the drug] in Europe for some uses, made it not unreasonable for defendants to
believe in their product.”). Moreover, as discussed above, it would be a very strange case of
concealment and fraud where Defendants fully disclosed the Study 315 safety data to the FDA,
to doctors, to market watchers and to analysts. See Compl. ¶ 25; Chepiga Aff. Ex. 11. Even if
the Court were to find that the Complaint gives rise to a reasonable inference of fraud (which it
does not), this inference is patently less compelling than the inference that Defendants were
hopeful but mistaken that Pristiq would be approved for VMS (as it was for MDD) and did not
know that the FDA would view the safety data from Study 315 as necessitating an additional preapproval clinical trial.
B.

Plaintiffs Fail to Allege That Defendants’ Stock Sales Were Sufficiently
“Suspicious” or “Unusual” to Give Rise to a Strong Inference of Scienter
Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants’ scienter is evidenced by a “series of

coordinated sales during the class period,” in which “defendants Essner, Mahady, Martin,

26

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Page 33 of 43

Poussot and Ruffolo dumped more than 1.55 million shares of their Wyeth stock for insider
trading proceeds of $83.82 million.” Compl. ¶ 40. The Complaint’s reference to Defendants’
stock sale “proceeds” is misleading. Although Defendants were paid $83.82 million in exchange
for selling their shares, Defendants initially purchased these shares for $65.98 million. See SEC
Website. Thus the net proceeds on Defendants’ Class Period stock sales were $17.84 million.
Id. More importantly, “executive stock sales, standing alone, are insufficient to support a strong
inference of fraudulent intent.” Bristol-Myers, 312 F. Supp. 2d at 561. “For insider sales to raise
an inference of improper motive, they must be ‘suspicious or unusual.’” In re KeySpan Corp.
Sec. Litig., 383 F. Supp. 2d 358, 381-82 (E.D.N.Y. 2003). To determine whether particular stock
sales are “suspicious or unusual,” courts examine a number of factors, including the number of
insiders selling at the time; the amount and percentage of stockholdings sold and the profit from
the sales; the timing of the sales; and any pattern of prior sales. See In re Scholastic Corp. Sec.
Litig., 252 F.3d 63, 74-75 (2d Cir. 2001). When these factors are considered, it is clear that the
Complaint does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
Although the Complaint alleges that Messrs. Essner, Mahady, Martin, and
Poussot and Dr. Ruffolo sold stock during the Class Period, it neglects to mention that eleven of
the Company’s twelve directors who were required to file public records of their stock holdings
did not sell any stock during that same period of time. See SEC Website. This fact detracts from
any possible inference of scienter. See Keyspan, 383 F. Supp. 2d at 383-84 (citations omitted)
(“Additional factors weigh against an inference of scienter. . . . [E]ight other . . . officers who
were required to file public records of their stock holdings—and who are not named as
defendants—did not sell any stock.”).

Page 34 of 43

More importantly, the circumstances of the individual Defendants’ stock sales do
not suggest a “fraud.” The timing of a stock sale is considered suspicious or unusual only when
it is “calculated to maximize personal benefit from inside information.” Ressler v. Liz
Claiborne, 75 F. Supp. 2d 43, 60 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). Also, “[l]arge dollar amounts alone typically
do not suffice to establish motive.” Id. Rather, courts are instructed to consider the percentage
of stockholdings sold. Keyspan, 383 F. Supp. 2d at 382. As discussed below, by these
standards, none of the individual Defendant’s stock sales was suspicious or unusual.
1.

Plaintiffs Do Not Allege That Dr. Constantine Sold
Company Stock

Plaintiffs do not allege that Dr. Constantine sold any Company stock during the
Class Period. As a result, the Complaint’s allegations regarding insider sales do not give rise to a
strong inference that Dr. Constantine acted with scienter.
2.

Messrs. Essner’s, Mahady’s, and Poussot’s and Dr. Ruffolo’s Stock
Sales Were Not Suspicious or Unusual

The Complaint alleges that four other Defendants sold stock in October 2006 and
that Dr. Ruffolo also sold company stock in May 2007. Compl. ¶¶ 125-28. Neither the timing
nor amount of these sales is indicative of fraudulent intent.
First, with regard to timing, Messrs. Essner, Mahady, and Poussot and Dr. Ruffolo
sold their shares: (1) after Defendants had allegedly been issuing false and misleading
statements for over three months; and (2) nine months before the Company issued a press
release announcing receipt of the FDA approvable letter.16 See Compl. ¶ 62; Chepiga Aff. Ex.
10. Courts find timing such as this insufficient, as a matter of law, to create a strong inference of
scienter. See Keyspan, 383 F. Supp. at 385 (no inference of fraud where “nothing explains why

16

Dr. Ruffolo’s May 2007 stock sales were likewise made several months before the Company received the
FDA approvable letter. See Chepiga Aff. Ex. 10.

these sales took place after a year of allegedly fraudulent statements . . . and seven months before
any negative public disclosures); Ressler, 75 F. Supp. 2d at 60 (“[T]he stock sales at issue took
place, for the most part, over six months prior to the release of the negative disclosure by
[defendant.] Such timing does not suggest that the defendants meant to realize profits
immediately prior to an expected and dramatic fall in the stock’s price.”); City of Brockton
Retirement System v. Shaw Group Inc., 540 F. Supp. 2d 464, 475-76 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (finding
that a “10-plus week gap” between defendants’ sales and the company’s disclosure of negative
information was “not strongly suspicious”).
Defendants’ stock sales were also clustered during the week immediately
following the Company’s Third Quarter Earnings Call and the end of a blackout period
prohibiting insiders from selling company stock. It is well-known that public companies such as
Wyeth impose restrictions on the ability of their officers to trade company stock. See In re Tyco
Int’l Ltd., 185 F. Supp. 2d 102, 112 n.6 (D.N.H. 2002). These restrictions include the use of
“blackout periods,” during which trading is prohibited. These blackout periods necessarily
bunch together insider stock sales into short periods of time. In addition, because “most publicly
traded companies have adopted policies which prevent insiders from trading except during
narrow windows that are open for only brief periods following the release of accounting
information,” courts have found that “evidence of insider trading following the release of
accounting information is of limited value.” Id. Here, the vast majority of Defendants’ stock
sales were made just after Wyeth’s Third Quarter Earnings Call on October 19, 2006 and the end
of a Company blackout period on October 20, 2006. See Compl. ¶ 80; Chepiga Aff. Ex. 14. As
such, they were neither suspicious nor unusual. Indeed, that is when any sales were required to
be done.

The volume of Messrs. Essner's, Mahady's, and Poussot's and Dr. Ruffolo’s stock
sales is also unsuspicious. Although Plaintiffs allege that these Defendants sold 70%, 97%, 89%,
and 90% of their Company stock holdings, respectively, Compl. ¶¶ 125-26, 128-29, these
numbers are wrong. They improperly fail to take into account vested stock options. See In re

Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 99 Civ. 0151-L, 2000 WL 33176043, at *10 (S.D. Cal. July 11,

sales drop to less than 5%, 29%, 25%, and 45%, respectively.17 See SEC Website.
If unvested options and restricted shares are considered, the percentages fall even
further to less than 4%, 19%, 16%, and 27%, respectively. See SEC Website; In re Astea Int'l

consider vested and unvested options, weakens any inference of motive to commit fraud.")
(emphasis added).
These numbers are too low to raise an inference of scienter. See, e.g., In re Initial
Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 544 F. Supp. 2d 277, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (insider sales that represent
less than 10% of the individual’s total holdings are “insufficiently ‘unusual’ to permit an
inference of scienter”); In re eSpeed, Inc. Sec. Litig., 457 F. Supp. 2d 266, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2006)
(holding that sales of 10.9% and 17.4% of holdings were not unusual); Keyspan, 383 F. Supp. 2d
at 382-83 (sale of less than 20% of available holdings not suspicious); In re Vantive Corp. Sec.
Litig., 283 F.3d 1079, 1092 (9th Cir. 2002) (sales of 38% of defendants’ aggregate holdings not
suspicious); In re Dura, 2000 WL 33176043, at *10 (sales of between 34-61% of holdings not
sufficient to raise strong inference of fraud).
3.

Mr. Martin’s Stock Sales Were Not Suspicious or Unusual

The Complaint alleges that Mr. Martin sold 99% of his shares during the Class
Period—in October 2006 as well as in April, May, and June 2007. Compl. ¶ 127. However, if
unvested options and restricted shares are factored in, the percentage falls to less than 72%. See
SEC Website. More importantly, both the timing and volume of Mr. Martin’s sales are easily
explained by his announcement on April 27, 2007 that he was leaving the Company. See id. Ex.
15. Pursuant to the Company’s stock incentive plan, “any stock options not exercised prior to
termination would have been forfeited.” Id. Ex. 16. Mr. Martin was thus required to exercise his
remaining options in the spring of 2007 or else lose them. Given these circumstances, the
Complaint’s factual allegations do not give rise to an inference that Mr. Martin acted with
scienter. See In re Health Mgmt. Sys. Sec. Litig., No. 97 Civ. 1865, 1998 WL 283286, at *6 n.3
(S.D.N.Y. June 1, 1998) (defendant’s sales deemed unsuspicious because “[w]hile [they] were
quite high during the Class Period, this was most likely on account of the fact that he resigned as

[a director] . . . and was divesting himself of his shares”); In re LaBranche Sec. Litig., 405 F.
Supp. 2d 333, 355-56 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“In light of the fact that [defendant] retired from [the
corporation] . . . a divestiture of this size . . . is hardly suspicious.”).
C.

Plaintiffs Have Not Alleged Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness
Plaintiffs also fail to allege facts “constituting strong circumstantial evidence of

conscious misbehavior or recklessness.” Kalnit, 264 F.3d at 138-39. The Second Circuit has
established a high bar for meeting this standard; defendants’ conduct must be “highly
unreasonable” and “represent[] an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care . . . to
the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant
must have been aware of it.” Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 90 (2d Cir. 2000). Moreover,
where, as here, a plaintiff fails to establish motive, the “strength of the circumstantial allegations
must be correspondingly greater. . . . Plaintiffs must specifically alleg[e] defendants’ knowledge
of the facts or access to information contradicting their public statements.” Bristol-Myers, 312 F.
Supp. 2d at 562 (citation omitted).
The Complaint fails to satisfy this stringent standard. Defendants’ alleged
misrepresentations pertain to the anticipated FDA approval of Pristiq for VMS and its potential
revenue stream. Yet issuing positive statements about the projected success of a pipeline drug is,
by its very nature, neither “highly unreasonable” nor “an extreme departure from the standards of
ordinary care.” As the court explained in Bristol-Myers, even where a drug company has some
indication that a drug might not be approved, this fact is insufficient to allege scienter: “Given
the uncertainty inherent in any application for FDA approval, Defendants’ alleged ‘inkling,’
which is a ‘hint,’ ‘suggestion’ or ‘slight indication’ [that the FDA might not approve the drug], is
reasonable and entirely consistent with Defendants’ public statements. . . . It does not constitute
strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.” 312 F. Supp. 2d at
32

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Page 39 of 43

562; see also AstraZeneca, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43680, at *46 (granting defendants’ motion to
dismiss because “[n]othing appears in the complaint showing that there was a consensus of
management that the risks of [the drug] made [it] unlikely to be approved”); Shields, 25 F.3d at
1129 (2d Cir. 1994) (“[M]isguided optimism is not a cause of action, and does not support an
inference of fraud. We have rejected the legitimacy of ‘alleging fraud by hindsight.’”); In re
Eastman Kodak Co. Sec. Litig., No. 05 Civ. 6326, 2006 WL 3149361, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 1,
2006) (“An even more stringent scienter requirement applies to forward-looking statements . . .
where plaintiffs must plead facts to support the strong inference that the speaker had actual
knowledge that the statement was false or misleading when made.”).
As discussed previously, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants knew during
the Class Period that the FDA would not issue an approval letter for Pristiq in July 2007. See
supra Section II.A. As such, the Complaint fails to give rise to an inference of conscious
misbehavior or recklessness.
IV.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT ALLEGED LOSS CAUSATION
The Court should also dismiss the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim because

Plaintiffs fail to plead loss causation. As the Supreme Court stated in Dura Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. v. Broudo, a decline in stock price may reflect any number of factors, including “changed
economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific
facts, conditions, or other events.” 544 U.S. 336, 342-43 (2005). “Establishing loss causation is
critical [to the success of a securities fraud claim] because Section 10(b) is not meant to ‘provide
investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic
losses that misrepresentations actually cause.’” In re Rhodia S.A. Sec. Litig., 531 F. Supp. 2d
527, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Dura, 544 U.S. at 345). Thus to survive a motion to dismiss,

33

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 40 of 43

a complaint must allege “a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the
[alleged] loss.” Dura, 544 U.S. at 342.
“One of the ways a plaintiff can plead loss causation is to allege that the market
reacted negatively to a corrective disclosure regarding the falsity of the defendants'
representations.” In re Winstar Communs., 01 Civ. 3014, 2006 WL 473885, at *13 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 27, 2006) (citations omitted). This requires a “showing that plaintiff suffered an economic
loss fairly attributable to the public airing of the alleged fraud, i.e., a significant stock price
decline immediately following the announcement that reveals the fraud to the public.” Id.; see
also Winstar, 2006 WL 473885, at *14 (“To establish loss causation by pleading a corrective
disclosure, a plaintiff must allege that when truthful word revealing the falsity of defendant's
representation reached the public, the market reacted negatively causing plaintiff to suffer an
injury.”).
Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the securities laws by failing to
disclose adverse safety data associated with Study 315. See supra Section II.B. As discussed
previously, Defendants in fact disclosed this information at the May 2007 ACOG annual
meeting, and the information was later discussed in an analyst report dated May 21, 2007. Id.
Importantly, following the release of the May 21, 2007 analyst report, Wyeth’s stock price
stayed essentially the same. Id. Because the disclosure of the alleged omissions about Study 315
did not cause a drop in Wyeth’s stock price, these omissions cannot be said to have “caused”
Plaintiffs’ loss. See Rhodia, 531 F. Supp. 2d at 545 (plaintiffs adequately plead loss causation
only where they allege that “the value of their securities dropped immediately following
defendants’ announcement.”) (emphasis added).

34

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 41 of 43

Moreover, the lack of market reaction in May 2007 to the safety data makes clear
that the price drop that occurred on July 24, 2007 was due solely to disclosure of the FDA’s
decision on the Pristiq NDA. The Company’s July 24, 2007 press release disclosed information
that the Company had just learned the day before: that the FDA issued an approvable letter for
the use of Pristiq to treat VMS and that the FDA required the Company to conduct additional
clinical research. Chepiga Aff. Ex. 10. The law clearly states that “the loss causation
requirement is satisfied only if the public disclosure causing injury addressed the specific fact
allegedly concealed.” Rhodia, 531 F. Supp. 2d at 545; see also In re Worldcom, Inc. Sec. Litig.,
02 Civ. 3288, 2005 WL 2319118, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 205) (“Unless [the plaintiff] can
establish that his losses were attributable to some form of revelation to the market of the
wrongfully concealed information, they are not recoverable in a private securities action.”).
Although the July 24, 2007 press release discussed the Study 315 safety data to which the
FDA was reacting, this information was not new. It had been disclosed previously. For a
plaintiff to establish loss causation by alleging that the market reacted negatively to a corrective
disclosure, “the disclosed fact must be new to the market.” In re Omnicom Group, Inc. Sec.
Litig., No. 02 Civ. 4483, 2008 WL 243788, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2008). “A
recharacterization of previously disclosed facts cannot qualify as a corrective disclosure.” Id.
Because the safety data from Study 315 were disclosed to the market in May 2007, over two
months before the press release was issued, they was not “new to the market” at the time they
were subsequently referenced in a press release. For all of the above-stated reasons, Plaintiffs
have failed to allege loss causation.
V.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER SECTION 20(a)
Plaintiffs also attempt to state a claim against all Defendants under Section 20(a)

of the Exchange Act, which imposes joint and several liability on every person who “controls
35

Case 1:07-cv-10329-RJS

Document 24

Filed 06/10/2008

Page 42 of 43

any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder.” 15
U.S.C. § 78t(a) (2008). “To establish a prima facie case of control person liability, a plaintiff
must show (1) a primary violation by the controlled person, (2) control of the primary violator by
the defendant, and (3) that the defendant was, in some meaningful sense, a culpable participant in
the controlled person's fraud.” ATSI, 493 F.3d at 108. Here, the Complaint fails to allege both a
primary violation of the securities laws and culpable participation by the Defendants.
It is well-settled that “[i]n the absence of a primary violation, a plaintiff cannot
state a claim for controlling person liability under § 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act.”
Salinger v. Projtectavision, Inc., 972 F. Supp. 222, 235 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); see also ATSI, 493 F.3d
at 108 (dismissing Section 20(a) claim for failure to allege a primary violation). Because
Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 10(b), see supra Parts II-IV, and do not plead any
other violations of the Exchange Act, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 20(a).
Moreover, a plaintiff must plead culpable participation “with the same
particularity as scienter under Section 10(b). Namely, in order to withstand a motion to dismiss,
a [S]ection 20(a) claim must allege, at a minimum, particularized facts of the controlling
person’s conscious misbehavior or recklessness.” Lapin v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 506 F.
Supp. 2d 221, 246; see also Edison Fund v. Cogent Inv. Strategies Fund, Ltd., No. 06 Civ.
40450, 2008 WL 857631, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2008); Kalin v. Xanboo, Inc., 526 F. Supp.
2d 392, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). As discussed above, Plaintiffs fail to plead with particularity facts
giving rise to an inference that any of the Defendants acted with conscious intent or recklessness.
See supra Part III. Their Section 20(a) claim thus fails.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss
the Complaint in its entirety and with prejudice. Plaintiffs have already amended their complaint
36

once and no efforts at repleading will cure Plaintiffs’ legally invalid claims. Because Plaintiffs’
case rests on a non-actionable premise, the Complaint should be dismissed without further leave
to amend. See Jones v. N.Y. State Div. of Military & Naval Affairs, 166 F.3d 45, 50 (2d Cir.
1998) (“[A] district court may properly deny leave when amendment would be futile.”).
