Desvenlafaxine Succinate (DVS-233) Phase 3 Data Show Significant Improvement in Symptoms of
Depression in Adult Patients Versus Placebo
- Results Presented for the First Time at 2006 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting MADISON, N.J., May 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of Wyeth (NYSE: WYE), this week presented for th
first time phase 3 data and results from other studies concerning its investigational drug for major depressive disorder (MDD),
desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS-233), a novel serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) at the 2006 American Psychiatric
Association Annual Meeting in Toronto.
Overall, the phase 3 data results showed desvenlafaxine succinate significantly improved depressive symptoms in adult patients
compared to placebo. In a separate study investigating QTc prolongation involving healthy adult female subjects, desvenlafaxine
succinate 200 mg and 600 mg doses did not affect the QT interval at the study's primary endpoint at eight hours post dose. Studying a
drug's effect on the QT interval is one of many methods used to help determine a drug's overall safety profile.
Wyeth Research discovered and developed desvenlafaxine succinate. In December 2005, Wyeth submitted a New Drug Application
(NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for desvenlafaxine succinate for the treatment of MDD.
"The phase 3 data showed that desvenlafaxine succinate can help improve symptoms in adult patients suffering with depression," says
Nicholas A. DeMartinis, M.D., Assistant Professor and Associate Director of Clinical Operations of the Neuropsychopharmacology
Treatment Research and Training Center at the University of Connecticut Health Center and principal investigator of the clinical trial
presented in the scientific session. "Because a substantial number of patients with depression do not respond to current antidepressant
treatments, it is important that new treatments continue to be developed to provide patients and physicians with additional treatment
options," Dr. DeMartinis adds.
"Wyeth is pleased to be able to report these promising findings that have the potential to add value to the management and treatment
of major depressive disorder," says Philip Ninan, Vice President, Neuroscience, Global Medical Affairs. "As a leader in neuroscience,
Wyeth is committed to its continuing development of medications that help address the unmet needs of people living with mental
illness."
Abstract: Efficacy and Safety of Desvenlafaxine Succinate in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder
The results of the first study presented, a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of desvenlafaxine succinate in 46
adult patients with MDD, showed significant reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) scores for the desvenlafaxine
succinate 100 mg (p = .0038) and 400 mg (p=0.0023) dose groups versus the placebo group. For the 200 mg dose group, reduction in
the HAM-D17 trended towards significance (p=0.0764). All desvenlafaxine succinate dose groups showed significant improvement on
the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, a secondary efficacy measure, versus placebo (p< 0.05). Additionally, the
100 mg desvenlafaxine succinate group demonstrated significant improvement versus placebo in depression-related pain scores utilizin
the Visual Analog Scale- Pain Intensity (VAS-PI) scale (p=0.002).
Abstract: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Desvenlafaxine Succinate in Major Depressive Disorder
The results of a second phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study of desvenlafaxine succinate were also presented a
the APA annual meeting. In this second study, 375 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to receive
desvenlafaxine succinate once- daily doses of 200 mg, 400mg, or placebo. Adjusted mean change from baseline in HAM-D17 total
score, the primary efficacy measure, was significantly greater for the desvenlafaxine succinate 200 mg (p=0.002) and 400 mg
(p=0.008) dose groups versus placebo. In addition, overall VAS-PI scores for the desvenlafaxine succinate 200 mg group were
significantly better than placebo (p=.002). There was a trend toward significance for the desvenlafaxine succinate 400 mg group
(p=0.053).
In the two phase 3 desvenlafaxine succinate clinical trials presented at the APA, adverse events, including nausea and increased blood
pressure, were generally consistent with the SNRI class. The incidence of nausea was greatest during week 1 of treatment and
decreased dramatically afterwards to rates that remained low for the remainder of the study. The most common treatment emergent
adverse events (i.e., those reported by at least 10 percent of desvenlafaxine succinate patients, and twice the rate of patients on
placebo) were abdominal pain, asthenia, anorexia, constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness,
somnolence, sweating, tremor, vertigo, and abnormal ejaculation. Most of these adverse events in both studies were mild or moderate
in severity.
Abstract: Double-blind, Placebo- and Moxifloxacin-controlled Crossover Study of the Effects of Desvenlafaxine Succinate on QT Interval
in Healthy Adult Female Subjects
To help determine whether desvenlafaxine succinate had effects on the QT interval, a randomized, double-blind study of 71 healthy
adult women (ages 18 to 55) was conducted. In the study, desvenlafaxine succinate 200 mg and 600 mg dose groups did not affect the

QT interval at the primary endpoint at eight hours post dose. Because many drugs are known to be associated with a potential to
prolong QT interval, the FDA developed guidance recommending that all manufacturers conduct a QT interval study to help determine
whether any new agent may potentially prolong the QT/QTc interval, one of many important measures of cardiovascular safety.
Abstract: Desvenlafaxine: Preclinical Evidence for Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibition, Antidepressant, and
Antinociceptive Activity
According to research also presented during the APA, desvenlafaxine succinate exhibited activity in preclinical models of depression and
anxiety.
Facts About Depression
Following are facts that substantiate the significant unmet patient need for additional antidepressant treatment options and the
enormous societal impact of depression.

Depression is the most common serious mental disorder worldwide.
-- Depression affects approximately 121 million people worldwide and is
the fourth leading cause of disability and premature death.
-- The World Health Organization projects that by the year 2020,
depressive disorders will become the second-leading cause of disability
worldwide.
-- Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions in the
United States, affecting approximately 14.8 million American adults
each year.
-- Women suffer from depression twice as often as men.
More treatment options are needed.
-- Researchers estimate that approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients
suffering from depression respond to antidepressant therapy, leaving a
large percentage of patients with unresolved depression.
-- Patients who experience one episode of depression have a 50 to 60
percent chance that it will recur.
Depression is both a physical and mental illness.
The most common symptoms include:
-- Feelings of hopelessness and sadness
-- Crying, thoughts of death or suicide
-- Lack of motivation
-- Changes in appetite and weight
-- Feelings of guilt for no apparent reason

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in short-term studies in children and adolescents with
MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of any antidepressant in a child or adolescent must balance the risk
with the clinical need. Patients who are started on therapy should be observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual
changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the
prescriber.

Wyeth Receives Approvable Letter From FDA for Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine Succinate) for the Treatment
of Major Depressive Disorder
MADISON, N.J., Jan 23, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of
Wyeth (NYSE: WYE), announced today that the Company has received an approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for Pristiq(TM) (desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
studied as a treatment for adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The letter was received January 22.
"The approvable letter is in line with Wyeth's expectations and we remain on track with our plans for Pristiq," says Joseph Mahady,
President, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals -- North America and Global Businesses. "We are working toward resolution of all outstanding issues
at our manufacturing site in Guayama, Puerto Rico and have already made significant progress in meeting previously established
commitments."
According to the approvable letter, FDA approval of Pristiq is subject to several conditions, including the following:

* A satisfactory FDA inspection of the Company's Guayama, Puerto Rico
facility, which is where Pristiq will be manufactured
* Several post-marketing commitments, including submission of long-term
relapse prevention, low dose and pediatric studies
* Additional clarity around the Company's product education plan for
physicians and patients
* Confirmation by the FDA of the acceptability of the proprietary name,
Pristiq
As the Company has already communicated, launch timing for the MDD indication is predicated on three elements -- final FDA approva
for Pristiq as a treatment for adult patients with MDD, the results of ongoing MDD studies at lower dosage levels, and the progress of
FDA review of Wyeth's separate New Drug Application (NDA) for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause. Importantly,
while the approvable letter requires some post-marketing commitments, the FDA does not require that any additional clinical studies be
submitted prior to the approval of Pristiq.
"Given the importance of Pristiq, we are committed to ensuring the most complete profile and product information is available to
physicians and patients at the time of this product's launch," Mahady says.
About Pristiq
Pristiq is an SNRI studied as a potential treatment for adult men and women with MDD. Wyeth submitted a NDA for MDD on December
22, 2005. The Company has also filed a NDA for VMS associated with menopause and expects an FDA action letter in the second quarte
of 2007. If approved, Pristiq will be the first and only non-hormonal medicine for the treatment of VMS associated with menopause.
Wyeth is a leader in both neuroscience and women's health care.
Wyeth discovered and developed the first SNRI approved by the FDA, which is currently the most widely used antidepressant in the
world. Pristiq represents Wyeth's latest efforts and continued commitment to developing therapies to help improve the lives of patients
suffering from mental health disorders.
According to a large depression trial funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, only 28 percent of patients with depression
achieved remission with initial antidepressant treatment. This leaves a large percentage of patients still suffering from depression.
Clearly, additional medicines are needed for treating MDD.
About Antidepressants
Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in short-term studies in children and adolescents with
major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of any antidepressant in a child or adolescent
must balance this risk with the clinical need. Patients who are on such therapy should be observed closely for clinical worsening,
suicidality or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and
communication with their prescriber.
About Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder is a serious medical condition that is different from "feeling blue" and is not something that people just "get
over." Criteria for major depressive disorder include five or more of the following symptoms that have been present for at least two
weeks, and at least one of the symptoms must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.

* Depressed mood

Further, people with major depressive disorder may experience clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or
other important areas of functioning. If a person experiences these symptoms, he or she should speak with a health care professional.
Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder, affecting about 121 million people worldwide. In the United States, it is
estimated that depression affects about 19 million American adults each year. The lifetime risk of major depression has been assessed
from 10 to 25 percent for women and five to 12 percent for men. Research has shown that hormonal changes, including estrogen
decline, or life stressors experienced by women may contribute to a major depressive episode.

Wyeth Submits Two New Drug Applications for Women's Health Therapies
Simultaneous Initial Submissions Represent a Company First and Wyeth's Ongoing Commitment to Leadership in Women's Health
MADISON, N.J., June 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of Wyeth (NYSE: WYE), announced today that the
Company has submitted two New Drug Applications (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The first NDA is for the
approval of bazedoxifene, a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) investigated for the prevention of postmenopausal
osteoporosis. The second NDA is for desvenlafaxine succinate, a non-hormonal agent studied for the treatment of moderate to severe
vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats.
"If approved, both bazedoxifene and desvenlafaxine succinate will give physicians additional options to help meet the individualized
needs of their menopausal patients," says Joseph Camardo, MD, Senior Vice President, Global Medical Affairs, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.
"The simultaneous submission of these two separate NDAs emphasizes Wyeth's position as a leader and innovator in women's health.
Wyeth continues to support clinical research and drug development with the goal of meeting the health care needs of women
worldwide."
About Osteoporosis
During menopause women begin losing bone mass more rapidly, making them increasingly susceptible to osteoporosis. According to th
National Osteoporosis Foundation the number of women of menopausal age who have osteoporosis or are at risk for developing the
disease will increase from almost 30 million in 2002 to nearly 41 million in 2020.
About Vasomotor Symptoms
According to the North American Menopause Society, there are approximately 40 million women in the United States of menopausal
age. As many as 93 percent of women going through menopause experience vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, which can
greatly impact a woman's life. However, many women remain untreated for their vasomotor symptoms.

Wyeth Receives Approvable Letter from FDA for PRISTIQ for the Treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms
Associated with Menopause
COLLEGEVILLE, Pa., July 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of Wyeth (NYSE: WYE), announced today that
it received an approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PRISTIQ(TM) (desvenlafaxine), a serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), currently under review as a treatment for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (hot
flashes and night sweats) associated with menopause.
In its letter, the FDA said that before the application could be approved, it would be necessary for Wyeth to provide additional data
regarding the potential for serious adverse cardiovascular and hepatic effects associated with the use of PRISTIQ in this indication. The
Agency requested that these data come from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a duration of one year or more conducted
in postmenopausal women. The Agency also requested that Wyeth address certain CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls)
deficiencies prior to approval.
The FDA also made additional clinical and chemistry requests, which the Agency stated were not approvability issues.
"Wyeth remains committed to the development of PRISTIQ as a potential treatment for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms
associated with menopause," says Gary L. Stiles, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. "We
will work with the Agency to satisfy its requests for additional data and move the medicine forward in the FDA review process."
On January 22, 2007, the Company received an approvable letter for PRISTIQ for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),
which did not require submission of additional clinical studies prior to approval for this indication. As previously announced, Wyeth
intends to submit its complete response to the MDD approvable letter at the end of August, and the Agency is expected to act on the
application during the first quarter of 2008.

Abstract

Figure 4. Cumulative Percentage Achieving Reductions in Moderate-to-Severe HFs From
Baseline to Week 12 (ITT LOCF)

Table 1. Baseline Demographics

Objective: Compare efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS) with placebo in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, nighttime
awakenings due to hot flushes (HFs), and mood disturbances associated with menopause

DVS 50 mg

Design: This was a 12-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Efficacy evaluations were reported at week 12

Results: 689 subjects received DVS or placebo. At week 12, all groups had significant decreases from baseline in all measures. The
placebo group experienced a 50% reduction in number of HFs. Compared with placebo, the reduction was significantly greater for the
100-mg (64%; P=0.005) and 150-mg (60%; P=0.020) DVS groups; the 100-mg (P=0.002) and 200-mg (P=0.024) groups had a significantly
greater reduction in severity of HFs; and the 100-, 150-, and 200-mg groups had significantly fewer awakenings (all P<0.045). The 50-,
100-, and 200-mg groups had significantly better total mood disturbance scores (all P<0.048). Nausea was the most common adverse
event and resolved quickly (median=3 days)
Conclusions: DVS is an effective treatment for alleviating HFs, nighttime awakenings due to HFs, and mood disturbances associated with
menopause, and is generally safe and well tolerated

Adverse Drug Reactions
➢ Mild-to-moderate nausea was the most common ADR associated with DVS treatment and resulted in more discontinuations compared
with placebo only during the first week of treatment
— During the first week, there was a significantly lower incidence of nausea in the 50-mg group (18%) compared with the higher doses
(33%, 39%, and 42% for the 100-, 150-, and 200-mg groups, respectively). These results suggest that women may benefit from the
use of the 50-mg dose when initiating DVS treatment
— The median duration of nausea episodes for DVS-treated subjects was 3 days
➢ There were no differences between groups in the incidence of newly emergent adverse events after the first week
➢ Most ADRs and discontinuations due to ADRs were dose dependent
➢ There was no significant incidence of weight gain in DVS-treated subjects compared with placebo
Cardiovascular Events
➢ Five DVS-treated subjects (0.8%) reported cardiovascular events: 2 myocardial infarctions (MI) and 3 coronary occlusions with
revascularization (including 1 with secondary MI). No cardiovascular events were reported in the placebo group (0/77)
➢ Each of the 5 subjects had 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors at baseline, and in all cases, cardiac catheterization revealed evidence
of extensive occlusion, suggestive of long-standing coronary atherosclerosis
➢ Due to multiple underlying cardiac risk factors in the subjects who experienced cardiovascular events, the lack of dose-clustering, and
because those events were rare, no dose or causal relationship could be ascertained
Discontinuation Symptoms
➢ Discontinuation symptoms were reported by 24 subjects (31%) in the placebo group and 291 subjects (48%) in the
DVS-treatment groups
➢ Dizziness (15.0%), nausea (13.6%), and headache (13.2%) were the most commonly reported discontinuation symptoms in
DVS-treated subjects
➢ Longer therapy duration (ie, 12 weeks or more) was associated with a higher incidence of discontinuation symptoms for all DVS groups

➢ Primary endpoints were assessed at 4 and 12 weeks and included change from baseline in daily number of moderate and severe HFs
and change from baseline in average daily severity score, calculated as [(number of mild HFs x 1) + (number of moderate HFs x 2) +
(number of severe HFs x 3)] / total number of HFs on that day

➢ Missing data were handled via a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach but were ignored when calculating average

➢ Subjects included healthy, postmenopausal women who experienced at least 7 moderate-to-severe HFs per day or 50 per week, who
were randomized to DVS 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg/d or placebo for 52 weeks

➢ Primary efficacy analyses were completed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and secondary outcomes were assessed using

Nighttime Awakenings and Mood
➢ At week 12, the decrease in the mean daily number of awakenings in the DVS 100-mg, 150-mg, and 200-mg groups was significantly
greater compared with the placebo group (P=0.048)
➢ The mean total mood disturbance scores observed in all DVS groups and in the placebo group decreased significantly from baseline at
week 12
➢ The DVS 50-mg, 100-mg, and 200-mg groups were different at the P=0.048 level from the placebo group in the total mood disturbance
score at week 12

➢ DVS is an effective non-hormonal treatment for moderate-to-severe HFs in postmenopausal women
➢ The 100-mg dose showed the most consistent results and produced significant improvements compared with placebo on several end
points, including:
— Reduction in the frequency and severity of moderate-to-severe HFs
— Reduction in the number of nighttime awakenings due to HFs
— Improvement in POMS total mood score
➢ There was a rapid onset of action—within 1 week of starting therapy
➢ Efficacy was maintained throughout the 52-week study period
➢ DVS was generally safe and well tolerated over the 52-week study period, with a tolerability profile consistent with that of other SSRIs
and SNRIs
➢ To manage adverse events, women may benefit from the use of a 50-mg dose when initiating treatment with DVS, and gradual reduction
of DVS may also be beneficial to patients when discontinuing treatment

HIGHLIGHTS
• With the “new” FDA’s hyper-focus on drug safety issues, we think it is worthwhile to contemplate
how the agency could handle WYE’s Pristiq, for the treatment of post-menopausal vasomotor
symptoms (VMS, or “hot flushes”). Pristiq’s PDUFA date is July 23rd.
• Pristiq is in a class of drugs that reliably raise blood pressure, and in one large trial recently presented
5 patients on Pristiq had cardiovascular events vs 0 on placebo. Could this be worrisome given that
Pristiq is intended for a patient population whose risk of heart disease is already elevated due to (a)
older age and (b) post-menopausal status?
• In all situations, a drug’s safety needs to be balanced against its efficacy. On efficacy, Pristiq appears
to be only modestly better than placebo. Results from one trial recently released showed Pristiq's
efficacy to be no better than placebo.
• How will FDA come out on Pristiq’s risk: benefit calculation? We think the drug will get approved,
but wonder to what degree the label could reflect cardiovascular safety concerns. In the current FDA
environment all possible outcomes need to be anticipated.
DISCUSSION
In more ordinary times, Pristiq would likely have no problem getting approval for VMS. Even today, we
believe the product will receive approval at the upcoming July 23rd PDUFA date. The only potential
liability we see is how the label might read relative to safety. In a post-Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
environment, where end-users are already skittish about safety issues, any adverse labeling with Pristiq

could potentially dampen enthusiasm for the product. In the current environment - where FDA appears to
be “in crisis” when it comes to matters of drug safety - investors are probably best advised to consider all
possible regulatory outcomes a little differently than before.
In the case of Pristiq, the product appears to offer only modest efficacy above placebo (in one trial it was
no better than placebo) yet it predictably has at least some adverse impact on the cardiovascular system in
a population whose cardiovascular risk is already a little bit higher. Results from one recent trial (the first
pivotal trial done in VMS) have been recently released showing that 5 patients on Pristiq inexplicably had
either myocardial infarctions (n=2) or coronary occlusions (n=3), versus none on placebo. WYE says this
was the only trial in which events like this were seen, but this may have been influenced by the fact that
WYE changed enrollment criteria for subsequent trials.
Pristiq for VMS will be reviewed by a different division of FDA than will Pristiq for depression.
Sometimes, different arms of the FDA view the risk: benefit of a given molecule differently. One need
only look to Eli Lilly’s (LLY: $59.37; Overweight rated) Cymbalta/Yentreve for a relevant example.
Cymbalta was approved for depression, but the same molecule (under the different brand name of
Yentreve) was essentially turned down as a treatment for urinary incontinence, due to FDA’s concern that
potential safety issues of Cymbalta outweighed the drug’s potential efficacy in this particular indication.
Cymbalta is mechanistically the same as Pristiq - both are serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
(SNRIs).
Pristiq has increasingly been viewed by the investment community as a significant commercial
opportunity for WYE, despite the fact that it is essentially a repackaged version of depression drug
Effexor XR. Despite its relative lack of novelty, effective marketing could lead to substantial sales
nonetheless. By 2012, we forecast w/w sales of Pristiq of $1.24B. Some forecasts on the Street appear to
be substantially higher than this.
In this note, we review the safety and efficacy of Pristiq, based on key data that has been presented thus
far. Pristiq’s late-July PDUFA date is one of the more important near-term catalysts for WYE. Our
rating on WYE is Neutral Weight.
BACKGROUND ON PRISTIQ. WYE’s Pristiq is the follow-on to its top selling product, Effexor XR
(for depression). Pristiq is being studied for two separate, but partially overlapping, indications of (a)
vasomotor symptom control (VMS, or “hot flushes” related to menopause), and (b) depression. WYE
first filed for approval of each indication in 2006, but for each indication there have been delays. As it
currently stands, the VMS indication is scheduled to receive FDA action first by July 23rd, following a
90d extension that was announced in late April. The delay was triggered by WYE’s submission of
additional data showing that dose titration with lower doses of Pristiq can lower the prominent side effect
of nausea and vomiting.
The active ingredient in Pristiq is desvenlafaxine, which is the sole active metabolite of Effexor XR
(venlafaxine). The clinical benefit of directly packaging the active metabolite of Effexor XR, in the form
of Pristiq, is unclear. A similar situation exists with Schering-Plough’s (SGP: $33.14; Overweight rated)
Clarinex, which is the active metabolite of Claritin. The two products appear to have a near-identical
clinical profile.

In the case of Pristiq, however, WYE is attempting to take the product into a new direction by conducting
clinical trials not only in depression, but also in VMS. Currently, Effexor XR and other antidepressants
are used “off label” to some degree in VMS already, but no depression drug has an official VMS
indication. Pristiq would be the first product, apart from hormone replacement therapy (HRT), to have a
VMS indication. If all goes well, it will also ultimately have a depression indication (1Q’08), and there
are a substantial number of post-menopausal patients that have both hot flushes and depression.
Pristiq’s opportunity in VMS was borne out of safety issues that arose with HRT in 2002 following
publication of results of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) suggesting that WYE’s Prempro raised the
risk of breast cancer, stroke, and heart attacks. Usage of nearly all forms of HRT for menopause
plummeted. WYE hopes to fill the void this created with Pristiq. Recently, however, reanalysis of the
WHI data has shown that in women who are early in their menopause, HRT does not increase the risk of
coronary heart disease, although the risk of stroke observed in the WHI was confirmed across all age
groups. The average age of menopause is around 50, and the reanalyzed data from WHI showed no
increased risk of coronary heart disease for women who initiate therapy close to menopause. The average
age of Pristiq patients in trials for VMS was around 53-54.
PRISTIQ’S SAFETY. Pristiq belongs to a class of drugs known as serotonin norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors (SNRIs). Also included in this class are Effexor XR (the “parent” to Pristiq) and LLY’s
Cymbalta. Because of these drugs’ impact on norepinephrine, an endogenous catecholamine, they
reliably cause a slight average increase in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate that is dose dependent. As
would be expected, there are outlier cases in which BP and heart rate reach higher levels.
The blood pressure effects of SNRIs has been well recognized for years, and at least in the Effexor XL
product label this is already reflected in the form of a “warning.” The extensive post-marketing
experience with SNRIs could help to assuage any potential concerns FDA may have about Pristiq’s
impact on blood pressure, but at the same time there are key differences between Pristiq and the other
SNRIs that may need to be taken into consideration:
•

•

One difference is the patient population that will be using Pristiq. Specifically, Pristiq for VMS is
intended to be used by patients who naturally have an elevated risk of having cardiovascular
disease due to their (a) older age, and (b) post-menopausal status. Longitudinal studies have
shown a clear correlation between both of these characteristics and cardiovascular disease. As
mentioned, the average age of the Pristiq user from several different clinical trials was around 5354 years. This is likely to be higher than the average age of users of depression drugs antidepressants are widely prescribed almost across the entire age spectrum. Blood pressure
elevation in younger patients is less important than blood pressure elevation in older patients.
A second difference relates to how long Pristiq patients will be on therapy. In depression, the
average duration of therapy is less than one year, but in VMS the average duration of therapy
could be 2-3X longer. This means patients on Pristiq for VMS will be exposed to blood
pressure/heart rate elevations for a longer period of time than those patients who take SNRIs for
shorter duration indications like depression. Supporting the likelihood of longer usage (or
“persistence”) is that in the Pristiq clinical trials, the average patient enrolling in the trials was
approximately 3-4y post-menopause yet was still having hot flush symptoms. In a “real world”
setting, initiation of therapy for VMS is likely to occur at or near the onset of menopause. Data
from the WHI also suggests that patients have post-menopausal symptoms for an extended period
of time, which led to long treatment times (albeit with HRT).

Recently, at the annual meeting of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), new
data from Pristiq was presented in the form of 5 separate posters. Three different placebo-controlled trials
were presented evaluating Pristiq in VMS, looking at both efficacy and safety/tolerability. In one of
these studies (the ‘315 study) 5 patients on Pristiq had adverse cardiovascular events (2 myocardial
infarctions and 3 occlusions) warranting intervention, compared to 0 patients on placebo. This seemed to
get little attention from the investment community, and we only discovered this finding recently. This
was the first phase III trial done evaluating Pristiq for VMS, and it completed in 2004. The poster
describes these patients as having 3 or more pre-existing conditions, and upon catheterization they were
also found to have evidence of long-standing atherosclerotic disease. The poster suggests that despite the
imbalance in the number of events, there is no clear link to the usage of Pristiq (despite the basic
underlying science that says that noradrenergic stimulation can increase strain the cardiovascular system).
WYE says there was no apparent dose-event correlation. In this first trial for VMS, WYE appeared to
have more open inclusion/exclusion criteria. In subsequent trials, after seeing these 5 events, we
understand that the enrollment criteria were tightened up modestly to exclude patients who were at high
risk for cardiovascular events. In a real-world setting, where “all comers” with/without cardiovascular
disease will potentially try Pristiq for VMS, could this be a source of concern?
In only one trial of Pristiq for VMS (study ‘315) was the rate of hypertension called out specifically. It
described hypertension as being prevalent in 4% of 50mg users, 5.2% of 100mg users, 6.4% of 150mg
users, and 7.9% of 200mg users. This is versus 1.3% for patients on placebo. Prior trials of Pristiq in
depression have shown placebo-adjusted elevations in BP ranging from 1.8mmHg (at the 100mg dose) to
3.8mmHg (at the 400mg dose). Put into context, this BP increase is similar to that caused by Pfizer’s
(PFE: $27.42; Neutral Weight rated) torcetrapib, a cholesterol modifying drug. WYE has not yet
released data on the 50mg dose for depression that will be submitted to FDA later this year.
PRISTIQ’S EFFICACY. In the field of pharmaceutical sciences, efficacy usually comes at a price –
side effects. Therefore, to judge the importance of Pristiq’s potential impact on the cardiovascular
system, one needs to balance this against Pristiq’s efficacy.
In the studies released at ACOG, it becomes clear that Pristiq’s efficacy is only modestly better than
placebo. One of the necessary efficacy endpoints required for regulatory approval for a new drug like
Pristiq in VMS is a reduction in the number of hot flushes from baseline as measured at weeks 4 and 12.
In the three pivotal studies presented, placebo led a reduction in hot flushes from baseline of between 4757% at week 12. Pristiq, on the other hand, led to a reduction from baseline of around 60% on average.
The absolute difference between Pristiq and placebo from these pivotal trials is about 10%, a modest
difference.
•

•

In one of these studies (study ‘315), at week 4 Pristiq was not shown to be statistically
significantly better than placebo for either the low dose (50mg) or the high dose (150 mg dose),
but the middle dose (100mg) was better than placebo. At week 12, the 50mg dose of Pristiq was
not statistically significantly better than placebo, but the two higher doses of Pristiq were. This
was the study in which there were 5 adverse cardiovascular events.
In a second study (study ‘319), Pristiq at doses of 100mg and 150mg was found to be statistically
significantly better than placebo the 4 week and the 12 week intervals. There was no 50mg dose
in this trial.

•

In a third study (study ‘321) - the only one to have an “active comparator” (tibolone, a hormone
similar to WYE’s Premarin) - Pristiq at 100mg (the only dose studied) was not statistically
significantly better than placebo at either the 4 week or the 12 week interval. In this trial, WYE
notes that the placebo response rate of 58% (at week 12) was higher than that seen in the earlier
two trials, and claims that this soured the statistical analysis. WYE also says this placebo
response rate was higher than that noted in a 2004 Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of prior
HRT trials. However, our review of the Cochrane report showed that the average placebo
response rate was in fact 58%, matching what was seen in WYE’s ‘321 study. In study ‘321,
tibolone led to an 81% reduction in hot flushes at week 12.

On another pivotal endpoint against which FDA judges new therapies - a reduction in the average “daily
severity score” of hot flushes - Pristiq fared better vs placebo at all doses in all trials. Pristiq also fared
better on various secondary endpoints such as mood and sleep.
SUMMARY. Pristiq remains an important new product for WYE, with emphasis in the near-term being
placed on the VMS indication because of its earlier timing (July 23rd) compared to the depression
indication (likely 1Q’08). With modest efficacy, at least some cardiovascular safety risk, and a patient
base that has at least slightly higher cardiovascular risk because of their age and post-menopausal status,
we wonder whether a seemingly cautious FDA could cause a wrinkle in the pending regulatory outcome.
The worst-case scenario would be a rejection of Pristiq for VMS, or substantial additional delays, but the
odds of this appear low. A more realistic worst case scenario, in our view, is that Pristiq’s labeling has
safety warnings that impact its commercial potential, or that in the absence of a label change
prescribers/payors/patients at least view the product with less enthusiasm (we recently did a large survey
of managed care payors who said that reimbursement of Pristiq would not likely be favorable based on
the clinical profile known as the time; see our May 8th report titled “WYETH: Payors Do Not Appear
Overly Impressed With Pristiq, For Hot Flushes”).
At present, our sales forecasts do not encompass any adverse regulatory outcome with Pristiq. We model
w/w sales of Pristiq of $50M in 2007, $420M in 2008, $727M in 2009, $981M in 2010, $1.15B in 2011,
and $1.24B in 2012.
VALUATION AND RISK DISCLOSURE. WYE currently trades at approximately 14x our 2007 EPS
estimate of $3.53. Our price target on WYE is $59, representing an approximate 15x P/E multiple on our
2008 EPS estimate of $3.96. WYE’s historic forward multiple range has been between 13-30x. The
current global group multiple is approximately 17x our 2007 EPS estimates.
Risks that may impede achievement of our price target: the potential that generic Prilosec and/or OTC
Prilosec, or competitive pressures in the PPI category undermine Protonix to a greater degree than what
we’ve modeled; the potential that LLY’s new drug Cymbalta undermines Effexor/Effexor XR to a greater
degree than what we’ve modeled; the potential that WYE is forced to assume significantly greater
reserves for the ongoing diet drug litigation than what we have forecasted; the potential that late-stage
pipeline products fail to materialize; and the potential that WYE fares worse in its ongoing Prempro
litigation that what we currently expect.

* In accordance with applicable rules and regulations, we note above parenthetically that our stock
ratings of “Overweight,” “Neutral Weight,” and “Underweight” most closely correspond with the more
traditional ratings of “Buy,” “Hold,” and “Sell,” respectively; however, please note that their meanings
are not the same. (See the definitions above.) We believe that an investor’s decision to buy or sell a
security should always take into account, among other things, that the investor’s particular investment
objectives and experience, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. Rather than being based on an
expected deviation from a given benchmark (as buy, hold and sell recommendations often are), our stock
ratings are determined on a relative basis (see the foregoing definitions).
Prior to September 8, 2003 our rating definitions were Buy, Hold, Sell. They are defined as follows:
When we assign a Buy rating, we mean that we believe that a stock of average or below-average risk
offers the potential for total return of 15% or more over the next 12 to 18 months. For higher-risk stocks,
we may require a higher potential return to assign a Buy rating. When we reiterate a Buy rating, we are
stating our belief that our price target is achievable over the next 12 to 18 months.
When we assign a Sell rating, we mean that we believe that a stock of average or above-average risk has
the potential to decline 15% or more over the next 12 to 18 months. For lower-risk stocks, a lower
potential decline may be sufficient to warrant a Sell rating. When we reiterate a Sell rating, we are stating
our belief that our price target is achievable over the next 12 to 18 months.
A Hold rating signifies our belief that a stock does not present sufficient upside or downside potential to
warrant a Buy or Sell rating, either because we view the stock as fairly valued or because we believe that
there is too much uncertainty with regard to key variables for us to rate the stock a Buy or Sell.
When we assign an industry rating of Favorable, we mean that generally industry fundamentals/stock
prospects are improving.
