v.

Acting Secretary of Health
and Human Services,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY
FEES UNDER THE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT

I.

INTRODUCTION

This Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs totaling
$57,567.34 under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) because the Secretary’s decision to
litigate this case was substantially justified. Although the Court found that the Secretary erred in
concluding that the requested continuous glucose monitor (CGM) did not meet the regulatory
definition of Durable Medical Equipment (DME), such a finding does not automatically entitle
Plaintiff to attorney fees and costs under EAJA. Indeed, the Secretary acted reasonably in
reaching his decision that the requested CGM was not covered by Medicare because it does not
serve a medical purpose. Specifically, in reaching his conclusion, the Secretary relied on the
statutory language requiring that items and services be reasonable and necessary to diagnose or
treat an injury or illness, he relied on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’s (CMS)
Medicare Benefit Policy Manual’s interpretation of what it means to serve a medical purpose for
Medicare coverage purposes, and he relied upon the evidence in the record confirming that the

data CGMs provide is unreliable and should not be used in treating diabetes. In light of the
Secretary’s reasonable position, Plaintiff is not entitled to a fee award under EAJA.
II.

BACKGROUND

The facts in this case are undisputed. Plaintiff is a Medicare beneficiary diagnosed with
Type I diabetes. AR 5, 25, 148, 285, 472. Additionally, she suffers from hypoglycemia
unawareness. AR 249, 283, 472. Plaintiff requested that her Medicare Advantage (MA)
organization, UnitedHealthcare/SecureHorizons (SecureHorizons), provide coverage for the
long-term use of a CGM. Under the MA program, 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-21 et seq., MA
organizations are required to offer, at a minimum, the same benefits offered by Medicare Parts A
and B. 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-22(a)(1); 42 C.F.R. § 422.100(c)(1). Additionally, MA organizations
are required to comply with National Coverage Decisions (NCDs), general coverage guidelines
included in Medicare manuals and instructions, and written coverage decisions of Medicare
Administrative Contractors (MACs) with jurisdiction for claims in the geographic area in which
services are covered under a MA plan. 42 C.F.R. § 422.101.
SecureHorizons denied Plaintiff’s request for a CGM based on Policy Article A47238,
which states that CGMs are precautionary devices not covered under Medicare’s DME benefit.
AR 266. The Secretary upheld SecureHorizons’ decision denying coverage. Plaintiff challenged
the Secretary’s final decision before this Court. While the Court agreed that the Secretary
correctly found that coverage for a CGM did not exist under NCD 40.2 or LCD L27231, the
Court found that the Secretary erred in relying on Policy Article A47238 to deny coverage.
Consequently, the Court remanded the case to the Secretary to assess whether the requested
CGM is reasonable and necessary and not otherwise excluded from coverage.

2
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 2 of 16 Document 27

Plaintiff requested over $26,000 in attorney fees after the Court issued its May 26, 2015
decision. Dkt. No. 53 (Plaintiff’s Petition for Fees and Costs dated June 26, 2015). However,
the Court found that even though the Secretary’s position was ultimately unsuccessful, it was
substantially justified. Dkt. No. 66 (Order Denying Fees and Costs dated September 9, 2015).
Specifically, the Court held that it was reasonable for the Secretary to rely on a policy article to
fill the coverage gap left by NCD 40.2 and LCD L27231. Id. Moreover, the Court held that the
non-precedential decisions of other administrative law judges in similar cases did not result in
the Secretary’s position being not substantially justified. Id.
In response to the Court’s May 26, 2015 decision, on August 28, 2015, the Council
remanded the case to the ALJ for a determination regarding whether the requested CGM
qualified as DME. AR 199-203. The Council stated that in analyzing whether Medicare
coverage exists for an item or service, the relevant inquiry must first determine if the item or
service falls within a statutory benefit category. AR 202. If it does, the adjudicator then decides
if the item or service is reasonable and necessary. Id. In this case, the Council pointed out that
the ALJ’s focus had been on whether the requested CGM was reasonable and necessary. He did
not address whether the CGM met the definition of DME. Id. Thus, the Council instructed the
ALJ to:
[C]onsider whether the Policy Article constitutes binding
guidance for the Medicare Advantage Plan, pursuant to 42
C.F.R. section 422.101(b)(3). Only if the ALJ determines
that the CGM systems meet the definition of DME, then
should the ALJ analyze whether the CGM system is medically
reasonable and necessary for the enrollee in this case, pursuant
to the District Court’s Order.
Id.

3
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 3 of 16 Document 27

The ALJ found that the requested CGM qualified as DME. AR 20-35, 1152-1202. In
addition to finding that the CGM qualified for coverage under the DME benefit category, the
ALJ found that the CGM was reasonable and necessary for Plaintiff. AR 31-33. The ALJ noted
that he was not required to give substantial deference to Policy Article A47238 because it is not a
coverage determination. AR 33. The ALJ also noted that SecureHorizons was not bound by
Article A47238 because it was not the type of guidance referred to under 42 C.F.R. §
422.101(b)(3). Id. Finally, despite this Court’s ruling that NCD 40.2 and LCD L27231 did not
provide coverage for CGMs, the ALJ found that they did not differentiate between home blood
glucose monitors and CGMs. AR 33-34. The ALJ thus found that coverage was available for
CGMs under NCD 40.2 and LCD L27231. Id.
SecureHorizons again appealed the ALJ’s decision to the Council. AR 82-86.
SecureHorizons argued that the specific CGM for which Plaintiff sought preauthorization, i.e.
the Medtronic MiniMed System, is not covered under the Medicare DME benefit because it is a
precautionary device that should not be used to make therapeutic decisions. AR 83-84.
SecureHorizons pointed out that the FDA approval for the requested CGM stated, among other
things, that it must be used with a blood glucose meter, no treatment decisions should be made or
changed based on the results of the CGM’s readings, and the results of the CGM’s readings must
be confirmed by a finger stick test. AR 84, 102. SecureHorizons acknowledged that Plaintiff
had since obtained a Dexcom G4. AR 84. However, SecureHorizons added that the Dexcom G4
was also a precautionary device. Id. To support its position, SecureHorizons submitted the
Dexcom G4’s FDA approval which stated the readings from this system are not intended to
replace the information obtained from a standard home blood glucose monitor. AR 84, 104.
Rather, the Dexcom G4 is intended to compliment the information obtained from the traditional

4
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 4 of 16 Document 27

test. Id. In response, Plaintiff argued that the CGM is the standard of care for Type I diabetics
with hypoglycemia unawareness. AR 76-77. Plaintiff acknowledged, though, that CGMs need
to be used in connection with finger stick tests. Id.
After reviewing the record, the Council concluded that CGMs do not qualify for coverage
because they are not DME, which means that CGMs, even if considered medically necessary, are
not covered by Medicare because they do not fit in a defined benefit category. AR 9. The
Council explained that DME must be primarily and customarily used for a medical purpose. AR
10. The Council stated that CGMs are not primarily and customarily used for a medical purpose
because they are precautionary items. AR 10. While the Council acknowledged that the term
precautionary is not statutorily defined, the Council found that this means that the device itself
must be used for a medical purpose. Here, the Council found that the requested CGM was not
used for a medical purpose because it did not measure glucose in the blood and therapeutic
decisions were not supposed to be made based on its readings, without first confirming blood
glucose levels with a finger stick test. In other words, the CGM was not a substitute for finger
stick tests. Rather, the CGM simply provided an added precaution. AR 10. The Council added
that the ALJ erred by ignoring this Court’s holding that neither NCD 40.2 nor LCD L27231
provide coverage for CGMs. AR 10.
After briefing and oral argument, this Court held that the Secretary erred in concluding
that the requested CGM did not satisfy the regulatory requirements for DME set forth at 42
C.F.R. § 414.202. Dkt. 19 (Decision and Order). Specifically, the Court found that the
requested CGM satisfied the requirement that it be primarily used to serve a medical purpose
because the Secretary did not articulate a non-medical purpose for the CGM. Id. at 11-12.
Additionally, the Court held that the regulations do not exclude coverage for equipment that

5
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 5 of 16 Document 27

must be used in conjunction with another device. Id. at 13. Finally, the Court found that the
Secretary’s decision not to cover a CGM for Plaintiff was arbitrary and capricious because the
device was covered for other beneficiaries. Id. at 14-15. Having prevailed before this Court,
Plaintiff filed the instant application for fees under EAJA.
III.
A.

ARGUMENT

The Equal Access to Justice Act
The EAJA is not an automatic fee shifting statute. See Federal Election Comm’n v. Rose,

806 F.2d 1081, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 155 (1990).
The EAJA provides for an award of attorney fees and other expenses to a party who prevails in
litigation against the United States if: (1) he was a “prevailing party”; (2) the government’s
position was not “substantially justified”; (3) there exist no special circumstances that would
make an award unjust; and (4) he filed a timely application. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412(d)(1)(A),(B).
In the present case, Plaintiff is a prevailing party because the magistrate judge remanded
the case to the Secretary pursuant to Sentence 4 of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). Shalala v. Schaefer, 509
U.S. 292, 301-302 (1993). Additionally, no special circumstances would make an award unjust
and the application for fees was timely filed. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A). Thus, the primary
issue before the Court is whether the Secretary’s position was substantially justified. Id.
The Secretary bears the burden of showing that his position was substantially justified.
Marcus v. Shalala, 17 F.3d 1033, 1036 (7th Cir. 1994). Although the phrase “substantially
justified” is not defined in the EAJA, the Supreme Court has explained that the government’s
position is substantially justified if it is “‘justified in substance or in the main’—that is, justified
to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.” Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565

6
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 6 of 16 Document 27

(1988). In offering further guidance regarding the substantially justified standard, the Supreme
Court stated:
[A] position can be substantially justified even though it
is not correct, and we believe that it can be substantially
(i.e., for the most part) justified if a reasonable person could
think it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.
Id. at 566 n. 2. Thus, substantially justified does not mean “justified to a high degree,” but rather
is satisfied if there is a “genuine dispute” or if reasonable people could differ as to the
appropriateness of the contested action. Stein v. Sullivan, 966 F.2d 317, 320 (7th Cir. 1992)
(citing Underwood, 487 U.S. at 565).
Moreover, a loss on the merits does not equate with a lack of substantial justification.
See Underwood, 487 U.S. at 569 (“[O]bviously, the fact that one agreed or disagreed with the
Government does not establish whether its position was substantially justified. Conceivably, the
agency could take a position that is not substantially justified, yet win; even more likely, it could
take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose.”) (emphasis added). Therefore, a court’s
statement in its merits decision that the government did not have a rational ground for its
decision does not imply a lack of substantial justification for the agency’s position. Kolman v.
Shalala, 39 F.3d 173, 177 (7th Cir. 1994).
Significantly, the substantial justification standard is distinct from the substantial
evidence standard, which governs review of the Secretary’s final decision. Cummings, 950 F.2d
at 498. As Cummings observed, these two standards of review “are used at different stages and
involve different tests.” Id. At the EAJA stage, the court must take a fresh look at the case from
the EAJA perspective and reach a judgment independent from the ultimate merits decision.
Rose, 806 F.2d at 1087-90. In other words, at the EAJA stage, the test is “whether the agency
had a rational ground for thinking it had a rational ground for its action.” Kolman, 39 F.3d at
7
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 7 of 16 Document 27

177. As such, this Court should deny the application for EAJA fees as long as the Secretary
reasonably argued this case. See Underwood, 487 U.S. at 565; Stein, 966 F.2d at 320.
B.

The Secretary’s Position Was Substantially Justified
When considering whether to award attorney fees under EAJA, the court determines

whether the government’s position during the administrative and litigation phases was
substantially justified. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(D); Cummings, 950 F.2d at 496. However, the
court need only make one determination as to whether the government’s position as a whole was
substantially justified during the entire civil action. Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154,
159 (1990).
The Secretary’s position throughout the administrative proceedings and the litigation
before this Court has been substantially justified. During the most recent administrative
proceedings and before this Court, the key issue was whether a CGM qualifies as DME under 42
C.F.R. § 414.202. The focus has been on whether the requested CGM “is primarily and
customarily used to serve a medical purpose.” 42 C.F.R. § 414.202(3). The Secretary’s position
that the requested CGM did not serve a medical purpose for Medicare coverage purposes, while
ultimately unsuccessful, was substantially justified.
As a starting point, it is important to recall that in order for any item or service to be
covered by Medicare, the item or service must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or
treatment of an injury or illness. 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A). As the Secretary explained, the
requested CGM does not treat Plaintiff’s diabetes. Indeed, the undisputed evidence established
that CGMs should not be relied upon to make any treatment decisions. The manufacturer’s
instructions for the Medtronic MiniMed and the Dexcom G4 both warn individuals that their
treatment regimens should not be altered solely on the basis of the CGMs’ readings. AR 84, 104.

8
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 8 of 16 Document 27

Thus, the Secretary’s argument that Medicare coverage was unavailable for the requested CGM
was directly related to the plain statutory language guiding all coverage decisions.
Moreover, the medical literature submitted by Plaintiff confirmed that the Secretary
correctly determined that CGMs should not be used to make treatment decisions. For example,
the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recognized that CGMs should only be used as a
supplemental tool for managing hypoglycemia unawareness. Record at 18, ADA Position Paper.
In other words, the ADA agreed with the Secretary that CGMs were not technologically
advanced enough to be used in treating diabetes. Similarly, a study published in the Journal of
Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics directed participants to “use CGM data as an adjunct to,
and not a replacement for [self-monitoring if blood glucose] finger sticks when making diabetesrelated treatment decisions (e.g. insulin does modifications)” and concluded that the accuracy of
CGMs does not yet equal the accuracy of self-monitoring of blood glucose. Record at 18,
Attachment 1. Thus, the Secretary reasonably concluded that coverage does not exist for the
requested CGM because the device itself is not used to diagnose or treat an injury or illness, as
required by 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A).
Similarly, the Secretary’s position that the requested CGM does not serve a medical
purpose was substantially justified even if it, too, was unsuccessful. Again, as noted above, the
Court’s review of the Secretary’s position in connection with a petition for fees is not to
determine if the Secretary’s position was ultimately correct. Rather, the Court is reviewing the
Secretary’s position and determining whether the Secretary’s position was “justified to a degree
that could satisfy a reasonable person.” Pierce, 487 U.S. at 565. Here, the Secretary acted
reasonably when relying on the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (MBPM) in determining that
the requested CGM does not serve a medical purpose. Neither the Medicare Act nor its

9
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 9 of 16 Document 27

implementing regulations define the parameters of what it means “to serve a medical purpose.”
The Secretary is in the best position to define the parameters of coverage because of his technical
expertise and because he has an obligation to preserve the limited resources of the Medicare
Trust Fund. In other words, as the Secretary explained, determining coverage issues is not an
easy task. Regardless, the Secretary must make difficult decisions when it comes to coverage
issues because Congress did not intend for Medicare to cover every item or service that a
beneficiary requests. Consequently, in defining the parameters of what it means to serve a
medical purpose, it was entirely reasonable for the Secretary to look to the MBPM for guidance.
This is so because the MBPM is issued by CMS, the agency responsible for administering the
Medicare program. CMS’s guidance regarding the type of equipment that is considered to serve
a medical purpose states, “first-aid or precautionary-type equipment (such as preset portable
oxygen units) . . . are considered non-medical in nature” and therefore, “are not considered
covered DME.” MBPM, Ch. 15, § 110.1-B-2. In light of this guidance, it was not unreasonable
for the Secretary to conclude that the requested CGM was precautionary, and therefore nonmedical in nature, given the undisputed evidence establishing that CGMs cannot be relied upon
to make treatment decisions. Instead, the Secretary equated the CGM to an alarm that prompted
Plaintiff to take an additional action in order to treat her diabetes, thereby rendering the CGM a
precautionary device. While the Secretary accepts that this Court disagreed with his position, the
Court’s decision does not necessarily mean that the Secretary was not substantially justified in
his position.
The Secretary additionally submits that the consistency of his argument throughout the
administrative proceedings and before this Court highlights his thoughtful, reasonable approach.
Moreover, the Secretary’s decision to cover therapeutic CGMs confirms the Secretary’s

10
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 10 of 16 Document 27

consistent position. As the Secretary has explained, CMS Ruling No. 1682 provides coverage
for therapeutic CGMs. The reason coverage exits for the therapeutic CGMs is because they may
be relied upon to make treatment decisions. Therefore, therapeutic CGMs meet the statutory
requirement that items and services be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of
an injury or illness. The rationale used as the basis for covering therapeutic CGMs is the same as
the rationale for denying coverage for the requested CGM. In other words, logic dictates that if
the device that cannot be relied upon to make a treatment decision is not covered, then the device
that can be used to make treatment decisions should be covered. This is because both satisfy the
statutory requirement that coverage is only provided when an item or service is used to diagnose
or treat an illness or injury.
Finally, the Secretary submits that the fact that unrelated administrative proceedings led
to the coverage of CGMs for other beneficiaries does not render the Secretary’s position not
substantially justified. Magistrate Judge Duffin specifically held that non-precedential decisions
of other administrative law judges do not render the Secretary’s position not substantially
justified. Just as the findings of other administrative law judges do not render the Secretary’s
position not substantially justified, the decision in Finnigan v. Burwell, 189 F.Supp.3d 201 (D.
Mass. 2016) also does not render the Secretary’s position not substantially justified. The
Supreme Court in Pierce stated:
Obviously, the fact that one other court agreed or disagreed
with the Government does not establish whether its position
was substantially justified. Conceivably, the Government
could take a position that is not substantially justified, yet win;
even more likely, it could take a position that is substantially
justified, yet lose.
Pierce, 487 U.S. at 568.

11
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 11 of 16 Document 27

Overall, the Secretary’s position was substantially justified even if it was rejected by this
Court. The Secretary’s argument that the requested CGM should not be covered is supported by
the plain language of the Medicare Act and the sub-regulatory guidance that informs the public
as to what types of equipment are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose.
Accordingly, the Secretary respectfully requests that this Court deny Plaintiff’s request for over
$50,000 in fees and costs.
B.

Attorney Parrish Is Not Entitled To A Fee Enhancement

In the event that this Court finds that the Secretary’s position was not substantially
justified, the Secretary urges this Court to hold that Plaintiff’s request for over $50,000 in fees
and costs is excessive. The EAJA provides that the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded:
shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and
quality of the services furnished, except that . . . attorney fees
shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the court
determines that an increase in the cost of living [since 1996,
when the current version of the Act was passed] or a special factor,
such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the
proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.
28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii).
While the EAJA clearly sets the hourly rate for an attorney to be $125, the Secretary does
not dispute the appropriateness of adjusting that amount to take into account a cost of living
adjustment. Thus, if an award of fees is granted, the Secretary accepts Plaintiff’s calculation of
the hourly rates as adjusted by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Secretary, though, disputes that a special factor enhancement should be applied for
the work performed by Attorney Deborah Parrish. As the Supreme Court stated in Pierce, the
EAJA “is not designed to reimburse reasonable fees without limit.” Pierce, 487 U.S. at 573.
Although the statute specifically sets a $125 cap on the hourly rate, adjustments can be made for

12
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 12 of 16 Document 27

cost of living or if a special factor is present. In Pierce, the Supreme Court found that an upward
adjustment based on a special factor is only available if the availability of qualified attorneys is
limited and if the nature of the case makes it necessary to retain the services of attorneys
qualified in “some specialized sense, rather than just in their legal competence.” Id. at 572. The
Court stated:
We think it [the special factor] refers to attorneys
having some distinctive knowledge or specialized skill
needful for the litigation in question – as opposed to an
extraordinary level of the general lawyerly knowledge and
ability useful in all litigation.
Id. The Seventh Circuit has interpreted Pierce to require an inquiry into whether a case presents
such unusual circumstances that it requires an attorney with “specialized training and expertise
unattainable by a competent attorney through a diligent study of the governing legal principles.”
Raines v. Shalala, 44 F.3d 1355, 1361 (7th Cir. 1995).
Here, Attorney Parrish argues that she is entitled to an upward adjustment in her fees
because of her degree in Biomedical Engineering and her previous experience at the Department
of Health and Human Services. According to Attorney Parrish, her education uniquely qualified
her to understand the present litigation and the complexities of product approval by the
Department of Health and Human Services. Although the Secretary acknowledges Attorney
Parrish’s accomplishments, they do not support the significant upward adjustment she seeks.
Contrary to Attorney Parrish’s assertion, the present case does not require that an attorney
have any specific scientific expertise. This is because the issue was not whether a CGM should
be approved for public use, but whether a specific CGM (that is already approved by the FDA)
should be covered by Medicare under the DME benefit. Without having a scientific background,
it is easy to understand that a CGM operates by continually measuring the glucose levels in the

13
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 13 of 16 Document 27

fluid just below a person’s skin. When the person’s glucose level falls outside a predetermined
level, an alarm sounds to alert the person that a finger stick test should be performed. Because
the present case did not delve deeper into the inner workings of a CGM, Attorney Parrish’s
scientific background was not necessary to her providing effective counsel on behalf of Plaintiff.
In other words, an attorney with an understanding of administrative and federal court
litigation would likely have been able to adequately represent Plaintiff regardless of possessing
specific scientific knowledge. Indeed, it is unclear why Attorney Pledl required co-counsel in
light of his statement that he has 36 years of experience in federal court litigation, including
extensive experience in administrative litigation in the disability law and Medicaid coverage
contexts. By retaining two attorneys, Plaintiff unnecessarily increased the overall fees in the
case, which would have been approximately $7,000 had Attorney Pledl handled the case on his
own. Instead, the requested fees exceed $50,000 for a device valued at less than $3,000.
Additionally, it is also difficult to understand why Plaintiff sought counsel from another
state to serve as co-counsel. Attorney Parrish suggests that Plaintiff could not locate an attorney
in Milwaukee who could understand how CGMs operate and who had experience handling
Medicare coverage cases. According to the Milwaukee Bar Association, there are approximately
4,000 attorneys in Milwaukee County. See http://milwbar.org/about.php. It is unreasonable to
suggest that not one of the 4,000 attorneys located in Milwaukee County could understand the
purpose of a CGM or how to navigate Medicare’s appeal process. Again, had Plaintiff retained
local counsel to serve as co-counsel, the fees being requested would be substantially less (and
there would not be $700 in travel costs). This is supported by Attorney Pledl’s statement that his
prevailing rate is $300 after 36 years of experience, rather than the $500-$525 charged by
Attorney Parrish.

14
Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 12/21/17 Page 14 of 16 Document 27

If an award of fees is granted, the Secretary urges this Court to deny the application of a
special factor enhancement to the hourly rate charged by Attorney Parrish. This case involved a
straightforward review of the Secretary’s final decision denying coverage for a CGM. No
scientific knowledge or otherwise specialized skills were required to adequately represent
Plaintiff. Accordingly, Attorney Parrish’s request for an enhanced fee should be denied.
IV.

CONCLUSION

The Secretary’s position throughout the administrative proceedings and before this Court
was and is substantially justified. While this Court disagreed with the Secretary’s position, that
disagreement does not automatically equate to a fee award under the EAJA. If, however, the
Court finds that the Secretary’s position was not substantially justified, the Secretary urges this
Court to deny Attorney Parrish’s request for an enhanced fee and only award reasonable costs
based on the rate set forth in the EAJA (with an adjustment for cost of living).
