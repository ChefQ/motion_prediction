JILL A. WHITCOMB,

Case No. 17-CV-14

ERIC D. HARGAN,
Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health
and Social Services,
Defendant.
______________________________________________________________________________
PLAINTIFF'S PETITION FOR FEES AND COSTS
______________________________________________________________________________
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Jill A. Whitcomb (“Ms. Whitcomb”), by her undersigned counsel, respectfully
requests that this Court order the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“Defendant”) to
reimburse the Plaintiff for her attorney’s fees and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice
Act (“EAJA”). Despite a Congressional mandate for timely adjudication, Defendant has sent Ms.
Whitcomb on an incredible quest through the Medicare appeals system. She endured six years of
litigation to obtain coverage for her life-sustaining continuous glucose monitor (“CGM”) device.
After losing its first argument, the Defendant pivoted and denied CGM coverage on the grounds
that a CGM is not “primarily and customarily used for a medical purpose” and, therefore, is not
durable medical equipment (“DME”). It did so without identifying any other purpose for a CGM.
Moreover, it maintained this stance while more than 35 Administrative Law Judges (“ALJs”) told
the Secretary that this position was not justified, not a single authority supported the Secretary’s
claim, and the Secretary’s own Civil Remedies Division told the Secretary that this position did

not pass the “reasonableness” test. The Secretary’s position was not substantially justified and this
is precisely the type of situation for which Congress enacted the EAJA statute.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
This case began in 2011 when Ms. Whitcomb requested pre-authorization for a Medtronic
MiniMed CGM device. That request was denied, and Ms. Whitcomb pursued the denial of her
claim through the multi-step Medicare appeals process without counsel. She was victorious before
an ALJ, only to have the Medicare Appeals Council (“MAC”) reverse the ALJ’s decision on the
grounds that an “article” barred coverage of the CGM as “precautionary.” Again, representing
herself, Ms. Whitcomb filed a Federal court appeal in September 2013. She was unable to secure
legal counsel until March of 2014. Magistrate Judge William Duffin reversed the MAC decision
and directed the Secretary to apply the appropriate legal standard to determine whether CGM is
reasonable and necessary for Ms. Whitcomb or is otherwise excluded from Medicare coverage.
Whitcomb v. Burwell, 2015 WL 3397697 (E.D. Wis. 05/26/2015). Judge Duffin denied a request
for EAJA fees. 2015 WL 5254518 (E.D. Wis. 09/09/2015).
Although the statute requires the MAC to rule on a matter within 90 days, it took no action
in response to the Court’s 05/21/15 Order. After the matter had been pending for more than 90
days, Ms. Whitcomb requested that the MAC send the case back to the District Court. Rather than
ruling on the issues, the MAC remanded the case back to the ALJ. The ALJ conducted another
hearing and issued a second ruling finding that the MiniMed CGM met the definition of DME and
also was reasonable and medically necessary for Ms. Whitcomb. Again, the decision was appealed,
and again, the MAC did not rule within the statutory 90 days. When Ms. Whitcomb again sought
to have the case returned to District Court because of the unreasonable delays, the MAC asserted
that the CD of the ALJ hearing was missing and remanded it back again to the ALJ. Then the ALJ

2

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 2 of 16 Document 23

sent back the file noting the CD of the hearing was already in the file and included a second copy.
More than a year later, the MAC again reversed the ALJ, this time holding that a CGM is
“precautionary” and is not “primarily and customarily used for a medical purpose.”
In January 2017, Ms. Whitcomb filed suit seeking to overturn the MAC’s decision on the
grounds that it failed to follow the statute and was otherwise arbitrary and capricious. The
Secretary persisted in his claim that a CGM is not “primarily and customarily used for a medical
purpose” and raised other issues. On 10/26/2017, this Court reversed the MAC finding that it
committed legal error and that its decision was arbitrary and capricious. [Dkt. 19: 10/26/17
Decision and Order at 13 and 14.] The Court found that “[t]he glucose monitor at issue here
indisputably satisfies th[e] unambiguous definitional phrase” that requires DME to primarily and
customarily serve a medical purpose. The Court found that the MAC’s decision was arbitrary and
capricious when compared to other covered DME and coverage of CGM claims for numerous
other Medicare beneficiaries. [Decision at 14 and 15] The case was remanded under Sentence
Four of 42 U.S.C. §405(g). [Id at 16]
Ms. Whitcomb, as the prevailing party in this litigation, now seeks to recoup her costs and
attorneys’ fees under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). Ms. Whitcomb seeks fees only for the period after the
first District Court remand and does not seek fees that accrued while she endured the second ALJ
hearing and the back-and-forth between the MAC and ALJ. However, Ms. Whitcomb’s
administrative odyssey is evidence of the Secretary’s overall litigation strategy.
LEGAL STANDARDS
A party that prevails against the United States in any litigation should be awarded “fees
and other expenses, in addition to any costs . . . unless the court finds that the position of the United
States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.” 28 U.S.C.

{Client Documents/230394/000/00046494.DOCX}

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 3 of 16 Document 23

§ 2412(d)(1)(A). The purposes of the Equal Access to Justice Act are threefold: (1) to encourage
private litigants to pursue their administrative and civil actions against the government and not be
deterred by the cost of litigation; (2) to compensate parties for the cost of defending against
unreasonable government action; and (3) to deter the federal government from prosecuting or
defending cases in which its position is not substantially justified. Berman v. Schweiker, 713 F.2d
1290, 1297 (7th Cir. 1983); Kholyavskiy v. Schlecht, 479 F. Supp. 2d 897, 900 (E.D. Wis. 2007).
An EAJA fee petition must include: (1) a showing that the applicant is a prevailing party;
(2) a showing that the applicant is eligible to receive an award; (3) an itemized statement containing
time expended and rates charged; and (4) an allegation that the position of the United States was
not substantially justified. Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 408 (2004). After the plaintiff
makes that allegation, the government bears the burden of proving that its position was
substantially justified. Goad v. Barnhart, 398 F.3d 1021, 1025 (8th Cir. 2005).
The EAJA awards attorneys’ fees to litigants who meet the other criteria unless the
government can show that its position was “substantially justified.” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).
The EAJA does not define the term.

The Supreme Court, however, has explained that

“substantially justified” means “justified in substance or the main—that is, justified to a degree
that could satisfy a reasonable person.” Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988). In other
words, a position that is substantially justified must have some reasonable basis in law or fact.
United States v. Thouvenot, Wade & Moerschen, Inc., 596 F.3d 378, 381 (7th Cir. 2010).

DISCUSSION
I. MS. WHITCOMB WAS THE PREVAILING PARTY.
Eligibility for fees under EAJA differs based on the type of remand under 42 U.S.C.
§405(g). There is a "distinction between a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation
with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six remand, which does not." Shalala v. Schaefer,
509 U.S. 292, 301 (1993). Under Sentence Four, "[t]he court shall have power to enter, upon the
pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision
of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing." 42
U.S.C. §405(g). A Sentence Four remand order which reverses a benefit denial is the type of
judicial success that does establish prevailing party status. Id. at 301-2; Uphill v. Barnhart, 271
F.Supp.2d 1086, 1090 (E.D. Wis. 2003).
This Court reversed the MAC and ordered the Secretary to authorize the Medicare
Advantage Plan to provide coverage for Ms. Whitcomb’s CGM. [Decision at 16] Therefore, Ms.
Whitcomb is the prevailing party under the EAJA.
II. MS. WHITCOMB IS FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AN EAJA AWARD
EAJA fee awards are available to private litigants with a net worth not exceeding
$2,000,000. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(B)(i). Ms. Whitcomb's in forma pauperis motion was granted
in the prior action. [Case No. 13-CV-990-WED Dkt. #8]. She is also verifying her current financial
status. [Jill Whitcomb Declaration] Ms. Whitcomb’s net worth has never exceeded $2,000,000.
She is eligible to receive an EAJA award.
III. THE SECRETARY’S POSITION WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY JUSTIFIED
At base, all that is needed to decide this issue is the fact that for more than two years the
Secretary denied Ms. Whitcomb CGM coverage on the grounds that a CGM is not “primarily and

{Client Documents/230394/000/00046494.DOCX}

5

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 5 of 16 Document 23

customarily used for a medical purpose.” That position is so at odds with reality that it is hard to
understand how anybody could hold that belief.
The government has the burden to show that its litigation position rests upon (1) a
reasonable factual basis; (2) a reasonable basis in law; and (3) a reasonable connection between
the facts alleged and the legal theory. U.S. v. Hallmark Const. Co., 200 F.3d 1076, 1080 (7th Cir.
2000). A court must consider the government’s actions during the entire dispute. Id. at 1081;
Gatimi v. Holder, 606 F.3d 344, 346 (7th Cir. 2010); see also Quality C.A.T.V., Inc. v. NLRB, 969
F.2d 541, 545-6 (7th Cir. 1992) (“conduct on remand was even more egregious”). For example, in
Tripoli Rocketry Ass’n., Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 698
F.Supp.2d 168, 174 (D.D.C. 2010), the government’s position in the initial court proceedings was
substantially justified, but its legal position upon remand was not. The Court’s decision to deny
EAJA fees in the first round does not save the government from the consequences of an entirely
new legal position. It merely set the stage for this Fee Petition.
There was and is no real dispute about the facts here. Without a CGM, Ms. Whitcomb
experienced, on average, 22 hypoglycemic events per month – often rendering her unconscious
and in need of emergency medical treatment. [Decision at 2] With a CGM, Ms. Whitcomb had
only two hypoglycemic events in the last six years through the date of the hearing, both of which
were the result of trying to stretch her funds by using expired supplies. Ms. Whitcomb’s use of a
CGM has been described as “a life-saver,” [Dkt. #12 – Administrative Record at 32], and
“remarkably successful.” [Decision at 3] The Secretary begrudgingly acknowledged that Ms.
Whitcomb “… may benefit from using a CGM …” [Dkt. #16 – Secretary’s Response at 2] During
the oral argument, the Secretary conceded that the CGM met all but one of the statutory elements.

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 6 of 16 Document 23

[Id.] The Court found the ALJ’s determination that CGM is medically reasonable and necessary
for Ms. Whitcomb is supported by substantial evidence. [Decision at 15].
This case hinged on the meaning of a regulation. An agency’s misreading of a statute or
regulation is generally more egregious in the substantial justification calculation than a mistake of
fact. Id. quoting F.J. Vollmer Co. v. Magaw, 102 F.3d 591,595 (D.C. Cir. 1996). An agency’s
misinterpretation of its own regulations failed the EAJA test in Halverson v. Slater, 206 F.3d 1205,
1211-1212 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. at 569, the seminal EAJA case,
involved an agency’s unreasonable interpretation of a statute.
The central issue in the case was whether a CGM is or is not “primarily and customarily
used to serve a medical purpose.” The Secretary also resorted to the word “precautionary.” This
Court found that the Secretary’s position was arbitrary and capricious. First, it held that the asserted
interpretation of the Medicare statute and regulation was unreasonable. Then it held that the denial
of Ms. Whitcomb’s CGM was inconsistent with numerous ALJ decisions which had approved
CGMs for other Medicare beneficiaries. Either one of these conclusions is sufficient to show that
the Secretary’s position was not substantially justified.
A. The Secretary’s interpretation of 42 C.F.R. §414.202 was unreasonable.
The Court found that 42 C.F.R. §414.202 was clear on its face, and the agency’s
interpretation was unreasonable in several ways. “First, the agency’s interpretation defies the
syntax of the definitional phrase.” [Decision at 12] “Second, the agency’s interpretation does not
provide any guidance on what type of equipment will satisfy its reformulated definition. Neither
the Act nor the regulations use the term “precautionary.” [Id.] “The glucose monitor at issue here
indisputably satisfies that unambiguous definitional phrase.” [Id. at 14] The Court went to hold
that the MAC’s decision was arbitrary and capricious because it made no sense to deny coverage

{Client Documents/230394/000/00046494.DOCX}

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 7 of 16 Document 23

for a CGM while approving other devices, like a self-contained pacemaker monitor, that also have
a secondary medical purpose. [Id.]
An agency that “attempt[s] to overcome the plain language” of a statute or regulation will
be unable to meet its burden of showing substantial justification. Halverson v. Slater, 206 F.3d at
1210. The Secretary’s whole legal strategy was to put forward a novel and unsupported
construction of 42 C.F.R. §414.202. The Court’s characterization of the Secretary’s legal position
as “indisputably” wrong, arbitrary and capricious makes the substantially justified analysis easy.
The Secretary’s litigation position was both unreasonable and unjustified.
B. Decisions in other cases placed the Secretary on notice.
The outcome of other similar cases, although not dispositive, can show the lack of
justification for the government's position. “[A] string of losses can be indicative . . .” Pierce, 487
U.S. at 566. By the time the issue reached this Court, more than 35 different Medicare ALJs had
issued more than 40 decisions concluding that CGM is covered as durable medical equipment.
That is, more than 35 experts in the Department’s rules and regulations considered the Secretary’s
position, found it lacking, and told the Secretary so more than 40 times. Somewhere in the middle
of that “string of losses” the Secretary should have realized that his position was not well founded.
Yet the Secretary marched on.
The Secretary argued that those ALJ decisions were non-precedential and fact-specific, but
the Court held that this missed the point. The “threshold question” of whether CGM is DME would
not vary from one Medicare beneficiary to another. [Decision at 15] Therefore, the Court decided
that it was arbitrary and capricious to find that those other CGMs were primarily and customarily
used to serve a medical purpose while taking the opposite position in Ms. Whitcomb’s case. [Id.]
In Pierce, the presence of nine adverse decisions when the government chose its litigation strategy

{Client Documents/230394/000/00046494.DOCX}

8

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 8 of 16 Document 23

was a factor in upholding the district court’s determination that it was not substantially justified.
487 U.S. at 570. Here, the Secretary ignored 40 adverse decisions.
Even if all of those ALJ decisions were not quite enough, the Secretary also received a
stern warning from a district court in Finigan v. Burwell, 189 F.Supp.3d 201 (D. Mass. 2016). The
case was decided on other grounds, but the Court had this to say about the legal argument regarding
the Secretary’s “precautionary” concept:
Even apart from the erroneous deference, the Secretary's construction of the term
“precautionary” to include CGMS because Finigan's CGMS is “not intended to replace
[Finigan's] traditional blood glucose monitoring[,]” but only to supplement it, Def.'s Mem.
15, is head-scratching, or at least under-explained. The Secretary's argument here seems to
go: since Finigan uses CGMS to monitor her diabetes symptoms in conjunction with
another piece of equipment, her CGMS cannot be “durable medical equipment.” It is far
from clear, though, why the fact of her having other equipment is dispositive: the CGMS,
as used by Finigan, helped her manage her diabetic symptoms, and, while it would not
qualify were the category “Primary Device Used to Treat Symptoms,” her blood-testing
regime seems irrelevant to whether her CGMS is “durable medical equipment.” Cf. Currier
v. Leavitt, 490 F.Supp.2d 1, 9 (D.Me. 2007) (ordering reimbursement for claimant even
though the purported “durable medical equipment” did not “cure the underlying condition
but only alleviate[d] its symptoms”).
189 F.3d at 207 n. 6. That decision was issued on May 19, 2016 which was five and a half months
before the MAC’s decision in this case.
The Secretary had ample notice that its litigation strategy in this case was “indisputably”
unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious because it was unsupported by the applicable law.1 The
Secretary cannot meet the significant burden it bears under EAJA. The legal positions taken during
the administrative appeal process and in this Court were not substantially justified.

1

Moreover, because no doctor, study, professional organization, industry party/group, or
competent authority of any kind has ever opined that a CGM is not “primarily and customarily used for a
medical purpose,” the Secretary’s legal position was also wholly without a factual basis.

IV. COUNSELS’ HOURLY RATES SHOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND A
SPECIAL FACTOR ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE APPLIED
Once the entitlement to fees is established, a district court is to apply the factors from
Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983), to determine an appropriate fee. Comm’r, INS v.
Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 161 (1990). Developing the theory of the case and drafting pleadings are
fully compensable. Webb v. Board of Education, 471 U.S. 234, 243 (1985). Fees incurred to
litigate a fee petition are also compensable. Comm’r, INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. at 163-65.
Ms. Whitcomb's counsel submitted declarations and billing statements. Parrish Law
Offices’ total fees and expenses are $52,301.60 based on customary rates. McNally Peterson’s
total fees and expenses are $19,299.66, again based on customary rates. However, the attorneys’
fees must be recomputed using the statutory EAJA rate adjusted for inflation. Counsel from both
firms are entitled to that inflation-adjusted rate. In addition, Atty. Parrish is entitled to a special
factor enhancement because of her exceptional expertise.
A. The $125/hr statutory rate must be adjusted for inflation.
The EAJA provides that attorneys should be paid at the prevailing market rate for similar
services, up to $125 an hour. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii). However, the statutory rate was
adopted in 1996 and must be adjusted for inflation. Sprinkle v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 421 (7th Cir. 2015).
It is not necessary to prove the unavailability of competent counsel to obtain a cost-of-living
adjustment, and counsel need not demonstrate that his or her individual practice involves unusual
costs that would justify a higher amount. Id. at 426-7. However, there must be some evidence that
the inflation adjusted rate does not exceed the community's prevailing rate in similar cases by
comparable lawyers. Id. at 429-430. A single affidavit will be sufficient. Id. The declarations
submitted by Atty. Parrish and Atty. Pledl clearly establish that the prevailing community rates are
much higher than the inflation-adjusted EAJA rates.

Case 2:17-cv-00014-DEJ Filed 11/30/17 Page 10 of 16 Document 23

Courts should "generally award the inflation-adjusted rate according to the [consumer price
index], using the date on which the legal services were performed." Sprinkle v. Colvin, 777 F.3d
at 427-8 (citations omitted). “[A]ppropriate cost-of-living increases are calculated by multiplying
the $125 statutory rate by the annual average consumer price index figure ... (“CPI–U”) for the
years in which counsel's work was performed.” Thangaraja v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 870, 876–77
(9th Cir.2005); see also Am. Wrecking Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor, 364 F.3d 321, 330 (D.C.Cir.2004)
(approving use of the CPI as “inflation calculator” for EAJA cost-of-living adjustments). Sprinkle
v. Colvin left it to the district courts to decide whether to use the national CPI or the CPI index in
the metropolitan statistical area where the litigation took place. The national CPI-U has been
applied in the Eastern District based on the month that the legal services were provided. Seefeldt
v. Colvin, 2016 WL 5793683, *2 (E.D. Wis. 2016). The latest monthly CPI is at

Since the November CPI will not be available until December, the October CPI is being used
instead. The Department of Labor actually provides the monthly CPI to three decimal places, but
rounding it to one decimal place and rounding the monthly adjustment factor to two places
produces a more usable hourly rate. The adjusted hourly rates range from $193.75 to $198.75.

[Robert Pledl Declaration – Exhibit A] Therefore, McNally Peterson requests $6,718.76 for
attorney fees and $1,440.00 for paralegal fees. Paralegal fees are reimbursable under EAJA based
on prevailing market rates. Richlin Sec. Services Co., v Chertoff, 553 U.S. 571 (2008).
McNally Peterson also seeks reimbursement for $1,662.16 in Westlaw charges. [Pledl
Decl. ¶12] “[A] charge for . . . computer research is appropriate.” Hirschey v. F.E.R.C., 777 F.2d
1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 1985). “[E]lectronic legal research . . . [is] consistently held to be recoverable under
EAJA.” Brass v. United States, 127 Fed.Cl. 505, 514 (2016) (citations omitted).
To summarize, the respective law firms seek the following EAJA fees and expenses:
Parrish Law Office attorneys’ fees
Parrish Law Office expenses

$22,191.51
$699.99

McNally Peterson attorneys’ fees

$6,718.76

McNally Peterson paralegal fees

$1,440.00

McNally Peterson expenses

$1,662.16

B. It is appropriate to apply a special factor enhancement for Atty. Parrish.
In addition to the inflation adjustment, the EAJA rate may be enhanced using the "special
factor" provision in 28 U.S.C. §2412(d)(2)(A)(ii). "We think it refers to attorneys having some
distinctive knowledge or specialized skill needful for the litigation in question—as opposed to an
extraordinary level of the general lawyerly knowledge and ability useful in all litigation." Pierce
v. Underwood, 487 U.S. at 572. The Seventh Circuit has interpreted it to require "an identifiable
practice specialty not easily acquired by reasonably competent attorney or special non-legal skills."
Raines v. Shalala, 44 F.3d 1355, 1361 (7th Cir. 1995). For example, the enhancement was awarded
to an attorney with expertise in “military and conscientious objector law” based on a declaration
stating that there were fewer than a dozen such lawyers across the country. Martin v. Secretary of
Army, 463 F.Supp.2d 287, 293 (N.D.N.Y. 2006). Certain experience can only be gained through

government employment. U.S. v. Scheingold, 293 F.Supp.2d 447, 452 (D.N.J. 2003) (enhancement
awarded to tax attorney who was a former IRS Special Agent).
Ms. Whitcomb could not locate an attorney in Wisconsin who understood the science of
CGM and had experience in the Medicare appeals process. Atty. Pledl was only willing to serve
as co-counsel with an attorney who has that expertise. [Pledl Decl. at ¶7] Therefore, it was
necessary for Ms. Whitcomb to retain counsel from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Atty. Parrish did not
just bring litigation expertise or even Medicare litigation expertise to the case. Her main
contributions were scientific knowledge about CGM (she has a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering)
and the complexities of product approval within the Department of Health and Human Services
(she had worked in the DHHS Office of Research Integrity). Ms. Parrish is a member of the
American Health Lawyers Association, the National Association of College and University
Attorneys, the Council of Science Editors and Society for Research Administrators and has
handled Medicare appeals since 1989. http://dparrishlaw.com/attorneys/debra-parrish/ (visited
11/30/2017) There is no way an attorney without this background could acquire this knowledge
even with diligent study. Atty Parrish’s experience in other CGM Medicare appeals was a bonus.
Atty. Parrish customarily charges $525 per hour in Medicare cases. [Parrish Decl. ¶7]. In
this matter she requests an award of her customary rate in view of the substantial effort required
over an extended period of time in multiple venues caused by the Secretary’s failure to not only
render a decision supported by law, but repeatedly rendered tardy in breach of statutory deadlines.
In order to compute the enhanced fee, Atty. Parrish’s share must first be backed out of the
adjusted rate totals. Atty. Parrish worked 75.72 hours on the case and her adjusted-rate EAJA fee
is $14,898.08. (The monthly amounts are: 11/16 – 3.0 - $581.25; 12/16 – 1.6667 - $226.04;
01/17 - .5 - $97.50; 05/17 – 5.92 - $1,161.80; 06/17 – 23.5 - $4,611.88; 07/17 – 1.0 - $196.25;

08/17 – 22.8 - $4,501.30; 10/17 – 17.8332 - $3,522.06.) Therefore, the firm’s basic EAJA fees of
$22,191.51 would first be reduced by $14,898.08 and then increased by $39,753.00 ($525 x 75.72).
The Parrish firm’s total attorneys’ fee request including the enhanced rate is $47,046.43.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff Jill Whitcomb is the prevailing party and she meets the financial eligibility criteria
in the Equal Access to Justice Act. The legal and factual positions asserted to defend this case were
not substantially justified. The Secretary should be ordered to pay Ms. Whitcomb’s attorneys’ fees
and expenses in the amounts set out above.
