DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
Defendants Judicial Watch, Inc. (“Judicial Watch”) and Paul Orfanedes (“Orfanedes”),
by undersigned counsel, hereby oppose the Motion for Extension of Time 1 to respond to the
Defendants’ Motion to Disqualify Larry Klayman (“Klayman”) as counsel for the Plaintiff.
1.

Defendants note that at no time have they been consulted regarding the relief

requested in the Motion for Extension.
2.

Defendants’ Motion to Disqualify was filed on April 22, 2008. Pursuant to LCvR

7 and Rule 6(d), Klayman’s response was due on or before May 6, 2008. As a professional
courtesy, Defendants agreed to a ten day extension of the deadline for Klayman to respond. See
05/06/08 Email from Defendants’ counsel to Klayman, attached hereto as Exhibit 1. 2
3.

Although Klayman has already had 28 days in which to prepare a response, he

now requests an additional twenty days bringing the total time for preparing a response to fortyeight (48) days. Defendants object to this amount of time as too much. No explanation or
1

2

Defendants note that the Motion incorrectly identifies Larry Klayman as the Plaintiff in
this action. The Plaintiff is actually Peter Paul.
Although Defendants believed they were agreeing to extend the deadline for ten calendar
days, Klayman represented that Defendants agreed to an extension of ten “business” days
thereby obtaining a fourteen day extension.

justification has been provided for an additional twenty days. Accordingly, Defendants only
agree to an additional extension of ten (10) calendar days, which is more than sufficient to
prepare a response.
4.

This litigation has been pending since early February of 2007, more than a year

and three months. During that time, Klayman has used the existence of this litigation as a
fundraising tool in connection with his anti-Judicial Watch advertising campaign. To vindicate
themselves, Defendants are anxious to move this matter through discovery and final disposition.
Further delay is prejudicial to Defendants’ ability to prepare a defense to this claim.
WHEREFORE, for all of the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the
Court DENY Klayman’s Motion and enter an order for only a ten calendar day extension.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/

Subject: Paul v. JW

Richard:
Pl advise if you will agree to a ten day extension to file a response to your motion to disqualify.
The tenor of your response in the JW case does not bode well. I thought that our discussion had
perhaps advanced things in terms of my thinking and resolving that case. I guess not. Its exactly
this type of response which has caused the current situation.
Just let me know your position. I will do what I have to do.
