UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
RADIANSE, INC.,
Plaintiff,
CIVIL ACTION NO. 10-10120-RGS

v.
TWIN CITY FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY,
Defendant.

TWIN CITY FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY’S OPPOSITION
TO RADIANSE’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Twin City Fire Insurance Company (“Twin City”) submits this Memorandum
in Opposition to Plaintiff Radianse, Inc.’s (“Radianse”) Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.
Summary of Twin City’s Argument
Twin City agrees with Radianse that whether Twin City had any duty to defend or
indemnify Radianse for the Underlying Action is a matter of law appropriate for summary
judgment.1 As set forth in Twin City’s Memorandum of Law in support of its Motion for
Summary Judgment (the “Twin City Motion”), the Underlying Action is unambiguously
excluded from coverage under Section V.(A)(1) of the Policy. Twin City Motion, Ex. E (the
“Exclusion”). The Exclusion consists of two clauses: (i) a declaration that broadly excludes “any
claim” that is “in any way related,” “to any liability under,” “any contract or agreement;” and
(ii) a “carve back” that substantially limits the reach of the exclusion by making it inapplicable

Twin City maintains that Radianse’s claims for bad faith can also be disposed of as a matter of law, regardless of
the outcome of Radianse’s other claims. Twin City’s denial of coverage was, at the very least, reasonable and in
good faith. There is simply no potential for bad faith in this case. See Twin City Motion, at 15-16.

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 2 of 12

“to the extent that liability would have been incurred in the absence of such contract or
agreement.”2
In the Underlying Action, AccountAbility sued its former employee, Diane Marcou, for
breach of her employment contract and sued Radianse for inducing that breach. Thus, the claims
in the Underlying Action arose from or were in some way related to liability under a contract;
specifically, Marcou’s employment contract. Moreover, because no liability could have been
incurred without Marcou’s employment contract, the “carve back” to the Exclusion does not
apply.
Radianse argues that the Exclusion does not apply for various reasons.

This

memorandum will address each of these reasons in turn below.
I.

AccountAbility’s Claims Against Radianse Arose From Liability Under A
Contract

Radianse first argues that the Underlying Action did not involve “liability under” a
contract, but rather “damage to property” (apparently under the mistaken belief that its D&O
policy is a general liability policy that covers “property damage”). See Radianse Motion, at pp.
8-9. Radianse’s logic is as follows: 1) AccountAbility’s contractual right (to insist that Marcou
not work for its clients) was a “property interest”; 2) Radianse, by inducing a violation of that
interest, allegedly “damaged” AccountAbility’s “property”; 3) and therefore, AccountAbility’s
claims involved “damage to property” and not contractual liability.
For the proposition that a contractual right is a property interest, Radianse cites the
unpublished case of United States v. Roxse Homes, Inc., 1993 WL 100102 (D. Mass. Mar. 29,
1993). Roxse Homes involved foreclosure on a real estate development. A previous court order
2

The full text of the Exclusion reads: “(A) The insurer shall not pay Loss under Insuring Agreement (C) for any
Claim: (1) based upon, arising from, or in any way related to any liability under any contract or agreement, provided
that this exclusion shall not apply to the extent that liability would have been incurred in the absence of such
contract or agreement; . . .”

2

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 3 of 12

had placed all “property” of the development in the possession of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, as guarantor of the mortgage. At issue in the case was whether the
development’s breach of contract claim against the roofing contractor constituted “property” for
the purposes of the order. The court answered this question in the affirmative.
The court did not rule that the breach of contract claim against the contractor was
somehow not contractual. The court did not rule that the claim constituted “property” as
opposed to a contractual right. Rather, the court simply held that the development’s claim for
breach of contract was included among its “property” for the purposes of the court order.
Furthermore, Roxse Homes did not involve claims for tortious interference; it involved a simple
breach of contract claim. Thus, Radianse’s is a blunderbuss argument. It leads to the absurd
conclusion that even a claim for breach of contract does not relate to contractual liability.
Furthermore, this entire line of argument is a red herring. The Policy does not exclude
“liability under a contract”; it excludes any claim “based upon, arising from, or in any way
related to any liability under any contract or agreement.” Even if Radianse’s own liability is not
“liability under a contract,” Marcou’s undoubtedly is. Radianse does not assert otherwise. And
Radianse cannot dispute that its liability in the Underlying Action was “based upon, arising from,
or in any way related to” Marcou’s liability.
Radianse also attempts to escape the holding of this court in GE HFS Holdings, Inc. v.
National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA, 520 F. Supp. 2d 213 (D. Mass. 2007). Radianse
states that the claim against Ingoldsby in GE HFS was for “negligent conduct for breach of
contractual duties.” See Radianse Motion, at 9. This is wrong. The claim was for negligent
supervision. See 520 F. Supp. 2d at 228.3

3

The claim was actually titled “Negligent Misrepresentations,” but the court assumed for its discussion that, as
Ingoldsby argued, the claim was really one for “negligent supervision.” See 520 F. Supp. 2d at 228.

3

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 4 of 12

Radianse makes several other statements about the GE HFS case, however, that are
correct and which demonstrate that the holding in GE HFS strongly supports Twin City’s denial
of coverage. Radianse acknowledges that Ingoldsby was not a party to the contract. Radianse
Motion, at 9. Radianse says that while the claim against Ingoldsby sounded in tort, the duty
underlying the claim flowed from a contract. Id., at 9-10. Radianse emphasizes that according
to Heller, Ingoldsby owed Heller a duty to ensure that the certificates required “under the Loan
Agreement” were accurate. Id. at 10.
These facts are all perfectly analogous to this case. Radianse was not a party to Marcou’s
employment contract. However, the duty not to hire Marcou flowed entirely from Marcou’s
employment contract. According to AccountAbility, Radianse knew about the contract and its
non-compete provision and therefore had a duty under tort law not to induce a breach of that
contract. Radianse points out that it “had no obligations under [Marcou’s] agreement with
AccountAbility” and that “[a]ny obligations of Radianse arose out of tort law.” Id. at 10. But
the same was the case in GE HFS. Ingoldsby did not personally have any obligations under
MHCS’ contract with Heller, but Heller asserted that Ingoldsby had a duty under tort law to see
that Heller’s contractual rights were not violated.
Radianse also discusses how the court in GE HFS distinguished other cases where the
contract only “provided the context” of the tort. But the fact is this case is far more similar to
GE HFS than those other cases. For example, Radianse points out that in GE HFS, “the contract
‘provided more than context’ and ‘the obligation to provide information [under the contract]
form[ed] the basis of Heller’s claims.’” See Radianse Motion, at 10-11; GE HFS, 520 F. Supp.
2d at 229. But again, the same is the case here. Marcou’s obligation under her contract not to
compete with AccountAbility forms the basis of AccountAbility’s claims in the Underlying

4

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 5 of 12

Action. True, Radianse had no obligations under the contract; but Marcou did, and under tort
law, Radianse had a duty not to cause a breach of her obligations (assuming the other elements of
“intentional interference with contractual relations” were met). Again, AccountAbility’s alleged
right to prevent Marcou from working for its clients, and Marcou’s and Radianse’s liability for
violation of that right, stemmed entirely and exclusively from Marcou’s employment contract.
AccountAbility did not allege any independent or pre-existing “fraudulent intent” on the part of
Radianse. See GE HFS, 520 F. Supp 2d at 229; Radianse Motion, at 11.
II.

“Any contract” Means Any Contract

The Policy excludes “any claim … (1) based upon, arising from, or in any way related to
any liability under any contract or agreement . . . .” (emphasis added). This Exclusion (unlike
others, such as the one in GE HFS) is not limited to contracts to which an insured is a party. The
Exclusion says, “any contract,” and this means any contract. See Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v.
Sowell, 603 F. Supp. 2d 914, 931 (N.D. Tex. 2009) (holding that an exclusion for claims arising
from “any” contract “cannot be reasonably read … to apply only to claims involving a contract
to which [an insured] was a party”).
Radianse argues that this conflicts with its “reasonable expectations.” It complains that a
straightforward application of the unambiguous language would “restrict[] the insured’s rights
based on obligations it did not voluntarily assume, and where the insured may not have even
known the contract existed.” Radianse Motion, at 11. Radianse’s complaints are misdirected.
These are reasons why Radianse would not be liable in the underlying case. If Radianse had no
knowledge of Marcou’s employment contract, the elements of “intentional interference with
contractual relations” would not be met and it would have no liability.

5

According to the

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 6 of 12

Underlying Complaint, Radianse induced the breach of a contract it well knew existed. See
Twin City Motion, at 9.
Furthermore, Radianse cannot re-write the insurance contract by citing “reasonable
expectations” in the face of an unambiguous exclusion. The insured’s “reasonable expectations”
generally only come into play “when the task is to interpret an ambiguous provision.” See
Aguiar v. Generali Assicurazioni Ins. Co., 47 Mass. App. Ct. 687, 691 (1999). Put another way,
Defendants could not reasonably have expected to be covered when the express terms of the
policy exclude coverage. See id. at 690-91 (holding that insured could not have “reasonable
expectation” of coverage in the face of an unambiguous exclusion); Spencer Press, Inc. v. Utica
Mut. Ins. Co., 42 Mass. App. Ct. 631, 635 (1997) (holding that insured’s claimed “reasonable
expectations” do not alter the fact that no reasonable policyholder would expect coverage “from
the language of the policy”). See also Board of Regents of the Univ. of Minn. v. Royal Ins. Co. of
Am., 517 N.W.2d 888, 891 (Minn. 1994) (“The reasonable expectation test is not a license . . . to
rewrite the exclusion solely to conform to a result that the insured might prefer.”).
III.

The Exclusion’s Carve Back Does Not Apply

Radianse also argues that the last clause of the Exclusion applies, because even if
Marcou’s contract did not exist, Radianse would have liability for “interference with business
relations” or misappropriation of trade secrets. See Radianse Motion, at 12. This argument is
another red herring. Without Marcou’s contract and its alleged non-compete provision, there
would be nothing left in the Underlying Complaint to support any claim at all.
If Diane Marcou had no employment contract, or if her contract lacked any non-compete
provision, she would have been an ordinary, terminable-at-will employee. She would have been
free to quit as she pleased and then to work for whomever she chose. And Radianse would have

6

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 7 of 12

incurred no liability for simply hiring her. Massachusetts law holds that “at-will employees
should be allowed to change employers freely and competition should be encouraged.” Augat,
Inc. v. Aegis, Inc., 409 Mass. 165, 172 (1991). “If an employer wishes to restrict the postemployment competitive activities of a key employee, it may seek that goal through a noncompetition agreement.” Id. See also BBF, Inc. v. Germanium Power Devices Corp., 13 Mass.
App. Ct. 166, 173 (1982) (“[A]n employer, at least in the absence of the use of ‘wrongful
means,’ ordinarily may hire such an employee (at will) of another employer without becoming
subject to liability to the earlier employer.”). As the Restatement explains:
If the third person is free to terminate his contractual relation with the plaintiff when he
chooses, there is still a subsisting contract relation; but any interference with it that
induces its termination is primarily an interference with the future relation between the
parties, and the plaintiff has no legal assurance of them. As for the future hopes he has no
legal right but only an expectancy; and when the contract is terminated by the choice of
the third person there is no breach of it. …
An employment contract, however, may be only partially terminable at will. Thus it may
leave the employment at the employee's option but provide that he is under a continuing
obligation not to engage in competition with his former employer. Under these
circumstances a defendant engaged in the same business might induce the employee to
quit his job, but he would not be justified in engaging the employee to work for him in an
activity that would mean violation of the contract not to compete.
Restatement (Second) Torts § 768, comment i.
Thus, the existence of a contractual restriction is pivotal in this case. Where there is no
contractual provision restricting an employee’s post-termination activities, there is no liability if
the employee simply exercises her right to work somewhere else.

Without a contractual

restriction, there can only be liability if the new employer uses some “wrongful means” to violate
the existing employer’s known “expectancy” of a continued relationship by inducing the
termination. The case of Swanset Dev. Corp. v. City of Taunton, 423 Mass. 390 (1996), cited by
Radianse, is completely inapposite to the facts alleged by AccountAbility in the Underlying
Action. In Swanset the plaintiff developer brought suit under the Massachusetts Civil Rights

7

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 8 of 12

Act, arguing that the defendants interfered with both his contractual relations (three signed
leases) and his future business relations. The plaintiff recited a litany of alleged wrongful
conduct by a number of defendants, including the Mayor and municipal counsel of Taunton, who
allegedly acted in concert to deny the plaintiff a needed special use permit. See id. at 396- 397.4
In the Underlying Action AccountAbility asserted only a claim for interference with an
existing contract, not for interference with a prospective contract.

Every allegation in the

Underlying Complaint is founded on the fact that Marcou was contractually prohibited from
working for Radianse.5 The Underlying Complaint never even suggests any other basis for its
contention that Marcou’s employment with Radianse was improper. AccountAbility alleged that
Radianse’s conduct was improper only because Radianse knew of Marcou’s non-compete
agreement and induced a breach of that agreement, anyway. Asserting any claim without the
contract would have required pleading an entirely new set of allegations. Only facts “within the
range of the allegations in the complaint” give rise to a duty to defend, not the theoretical
allegations of a theoretical complaint. See Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 17 Mass. App.
Ct. 316, 318 (1983). “[O]therwise, an insurer's duty to defend could arise in a virtually endless
number of situations, constrained only by the imagination of the insured, regardless of what is, in

4

Further, when the court in Swanset referred to interference with “business relations,” it was referring to
“intentional interference with prospective contractual relations” under Restatement (Second) Torts § 766B, as
opposed to intentional interference with an existing contract under §766. See United Truck Leasing Corp. v.
Geltman, 406 Mass. 811 (Mass. 1990) (cited by Swanset, discussing “what elements a plaintiff must prove in order
to present a jury question (1) on a claim of intentional interference with a contract and (2) on a claim of intentional
interference with a prospective contractual relation.”).
5

As explained in Twin City’s Motion, the basis for AccountAbility’s claim against Radianse was laid out in Count
IV of the Underlying Complaint. See Ex. A, at ¶¶ 56-62. To review, Count IV alleged the following: that the
Consulting Agreement between AccountAbility and Marcou constituted a “binding contract” (¶57); that Radianse
had “actual notice” of that contract (¶58); that Radianse “knowingly and willfully interfered with AccountAbility’s
contractual relations with Marcou” by employing her (¶59); that Marcou accepted employment with Radianse “in
violation of the non-solicitation provisions of her Agreement with AccountAbility” as a direct result of Radianse’s
“knowing and willful interference” (¶60); that Radianse’s interference with Marcou’s contractual performance was
“improper in motive or means” (¶61); and that as a result, AccountAbility suffered damages (¶62).

8

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 9 of 12

fact, alleged in the underlying complaint.” Schilberg Integrated Metals Corp. v. Continental
Cas. Co., 819 A.2d 773, 788 (Conn. 2003).
Moreover, AccountAbility not only omitted any allegations supporting a claim for
intentional interference with prospective contract or “business relations”; it could not have
asserted such a claim under the facts alleged. According to the Underlying Complaint, Marcou
independently decided to resign from AccountAbility when negotiations over her salary failed.
See Twin City Motion, Ex. A, at ¶15. It was only after Marcou quit AccountAbility that she
allegedly solicited employment with Radianse.

See id., at ¶¶ 20 et seq.

At that point,

AccountAbility had no legal right or even expectancy that could be violated, other than the noncompete provision in Marcou’s employment contract. Without that provision, there could not
possibly have been any liability. See Ryan, Elliott and Co., Inc. v. Leggat, McCall & Werner,
Inc., 8 Mass. App. Ct. 686, 693 (1979) (holding that defense verdict was proper where employee
had “already decided to leave” the plaintiff’s company before defendant offered him
employment). Put another way, Radianse was not alleged to have induced Marcou to leave
AccountAbility; it was only alleged to have induced Marcou to work for Radianse, after Marcou
had already quit on her own.
Radianse also attempts to pin a duty to defend on a claim for misappropriation of trade
secrets. This attempt must fail for several reasons. First, the Underlying Complaint does not
actually contain a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets or allege that Radianse actually
misappropriated any specific information. Rather, it merely speculates that Marcou is likely to
commit such a misappropriation and seeks an injunction to prevent this from happening in the
future. See Twin City Motion, Ex. A, at ¶34. Second, any claim for misappropriation of trade
secrets would also have arisen from Marcou’s employment contract, which prohibited such

9

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 10 of 12

misappropriation and circumscribed her obligations.

See id., at ¶¶ 11-13.

Third, any

misappropriation claim would not be covered under the Policy, even without Marcou’s contract.
The Policy expressly excludes “any claim … based upon, arising from, or in any way related to
infringement of … trade secrets, or other intellectual property.” See Twin City Motion, Ex. E, at
§V.A.(5).
IV.

Twin City’s Reading Does Not Render Any Language “Superfluous”

Radianse also argues that Twin City’s reading renders various words “superfluous.”
First, Radianse argues that Twin City ignores the words “liability under any.” See Radianse
Motion, at 13. Twin City does no such thing. As explained above, AccountAbility’s asserted
right to prevent Marcou from working for its clients was derived exclusively from Marcou’s
contract, and therefore liability for violating that right was “liability under any contract.” Even if
Radianse is correct that its own liability was not “under” a contract, Marcou’s liability certainly
was, and Radianse’s liability clearly was “related to” her liability.
In perhaps its strangest and most confusing argument, Radianse also states that a
“reasonable interpretation of the contract requires circumstances in which the exclusion would
not apply, but where liability would not ‘have been incurred in the absence of [the] contract.’”
See Radianse Motion, at 13. “Otherwise,” says Radianse, “the first half of the Exclusion would
be surplusage.” Id. This makes absolutely no sense. Without the first half of the Exclusion,
nothing at all would be excluded. There is simply nothing in the Policy or in logic requiring that
the “circumstances” formulated by Radianse exist.
The parties to the insurance contract intended to exclude any claims arising from or in
any way related to contractual liability, but sought to leave intact the tort and statutory claims
that would exist in the absence of any contractual liability and are otherwise covered under D&O

10

Case 1:10-cv-10120-RGS Document 31 Filed 09/10/10 Page 11 of 12

policies – for example, securities fraud or derivative claims. The language of the Exclusion as
written represents a perfectly efficient and clear way of effecting this intent, and Radianse has
offered no alternative formulation with the same effect and with less “surplusage.” If Radianse
nonetheless demands an example of a claim that is covered even without the Exclusion’s carve
back, most securities fraud claims would fit the bill. Claims for securities fraud (e.g., under
§10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are derived from statute and generally do not arise
from any contractual liability. AccountAbility’s claims, on the other hand, are derived entirely
from its rights under Diane Marcou’s employment contract and her liability thereunder.
In any case, there is no need to play Radianse’s game of hypotheticals. The language of
the Policy is unambiguous and clearly excludes coverage in this case, regardless of any
theoretical scenarios that Radianse or Twin City may construct. Therefore, Twin City’s denial of
coverage was proper and in good faith, and Radianse’s Motion should be denied.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above and in Twin City’s Motion for Summary Judgment,
Radianse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment should be denied and Twin City’s Motion for
Summary Judgment should be granted.
