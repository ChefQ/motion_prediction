DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE BRIEF IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT’S REBUTTAL
IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

COMES NOW, the Defendant, City of Wiggins, Mississippi (the “City” or “Wiggins”), by
and through the undersigned counsel of record, and files its Response Brief in Opposition to
Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike Defendant’s Rebuttal in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment and in support thereof would show as follows, to wit:
Counsel for Wiggins admits that his Memorandum Brief in Support of Motion for Summary
Judgment [ECF No. 92] and Rebuttal Brief [ECF No. 104] exceed the thirty-five page limit
prescribed by Local Rule 7(b)(5) and humbly apologizes for this mistake. However, a complete
striking of the pleading for exceeding the page limit by only five pages is a drastic remedy and the
City would respectfully request that the Plaintiffs’ Motion be denied.
This Court has stated that a “motion to strike is a drastic remedy which is disfavored by the
courts and infrequently granted.” Conn v. U.S., 823 F.Supp.2d 441, 444 (S.D.Miss. 2011)(quoting,
Int'l Longshoremen's Assoc., S.S. Clerks Local 1624, AFL–CIO v. Virginia Int'l Terminals, Inc., 904
F.Supp. 500, 504 (E.D.Va.1995)). Additionally, such motions “generally should not be granted
absent a showing of prejudice to the moving party.” Id. at 446 (citing, Augustus v. Bd. of Pub.

Instruction of Escambia Cnty., Fla., 306 F.2d 862, 868 (5th Cir.1962); Mullins v. Chevron Oil Co.,
344 F.Supp. 1063, 1067 (E.D.La.1972)).
In the present matter, the Plaintiffs did not argue in their Motion or Brief that they were
prejudiced by the City exceeding the page limit in their summary judgment briefs. Thus, this Court
should not grant the extraordinary relief because the Plaintiffs have not made the requisite showing
of prejudice to support the remedy.
Also, as noted by the Plaintiffs in their Brief, this Court has discretion concerning
enforcement of its local rules. Precision Spine, Inc. v. Zavation, LLC, 2017 WL 939278, at *2
(S.D.Miss. 2017)(citing, United States v. Rios-Espinoza, 591 F.3d 758, 760 (5th Cir. 2009)). The
City would humbly request that this Court use that discretion to allow the extra five pages making
up briefs.
In the Precision Spine case cited above, this Court granted a motion to strike because a party
exceeded the page limit found at Local Rule 7(b)(5). Id. at *1. However, the offending party in that
case filed thirteen summary judgment motions and far exceeded the page limit by hundreds of pages.
Id. That is not present in the matter sub judice. Here, Wiggins exceeded the page limit by a mere
five pages.
Even the authority relied upon by the Plaintiffs in support of the instant Motion does not
stand for a concrete finding that the pleading should be stricken. They rely on Kelly v. Dedicated
Logistics, LLC, 2017 WL 3880317 *1 (N.D.Miss. 2017) but in that matter the Court, using its
discretion, instead of striking or not considering the pleadings, cautioned counsel that future noncompliant filings may not be considered by the Court.
Counsel admits that he made a mistake by exceeding the page limit of Local Rule 7(b)(5).
2

It was an oversight and will not happen in the future. Nonetheless, the error should not lead to a
complete striking of the City’s Rebuttal Brief. As noted above, the Local Rules are meant to be
followed but are not inflexible and this Court enjoys broad discretion concerning their enforcement.
As such, Counsel humbly asks that this Court allow the additional five pages and deny the Plaintiffs’
Motion.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this the 1st day of December, 2017.
