PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT OF
THEIR MOTION TO STRIKE

COME NOW Plaintiffs, Theresa D. Fortenberry and Tralvis Fortenberry d/b/a Caring Hands
Personal Care Home by and through their attorneys of record, Rushing & Guice, P.L.L.C, and file
this their Memorandum of Authority in Support of their Motion to Strike Defendant’s Rebuttal in
Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment in the above styled cause and state as follows:
On October 20, 2017, Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment (Dk#91) and
accompanying Memorandum Brief (Dk#92). The Memorandum Brief is twenty-eight (28) pages long
not including the certificate of service page. In rebuttal to Plaintiffs’ Response in Opposition to
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Dk#100), Defendant filed its Rebuttal in Support of
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Dk#104) on November 20, 2017. This filing is twelve
(12) pages long not including the certificate of service page.
Pursuant to Local Rule 7(b)(5), a “[m]ovant’s original and rebuttal memorandum briefs
together may not exceed a total of thirty-five pages.” Not counting the certificate of service pages,

Case 1:16-cv-00320-LG-RHW Document 106 Filed 11/22/17 Page 2 of 3

Defendant’s original and rebuttal memoranda together equal forty (40) pages. Defendant’s original
and rebuttal briefs clearly exceed thirty-five (35) pages. Defendant has not sought leave of the Court
to exceed the page limits set by L.U.Civ.R. 7(b)(5).
Enforcement of the local rules by striking non-complying filings is a matter within the
Court's discretion. See United States v. Rios-Espinoza, 591 F.3d 758, 760 (5th Cir. 2009).
Additionally, “[a]ttorneys practicing before the district courts of Mississippi are charged with the
responsibility of knowing the Local Rules . . . and may be sanctioned for failing to comply with
them.” See Preamble to the Local Civil Rules; See also Kelly v. Dedicated Logistics, LLC, 4:16-cv215-DMB-JV, n. 1, United States District Court, N.D. Mississippi, September 5, 2017 (the Court
cautioning counsel that future filings which fail to comply with the local rules will risk not being
considered by the Court).
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiffs respectfully move this Court to strike
Defendant’s Rebuttal in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, as exceeding the page
limitations set by L.U.Civ.R. 7(b)(5).

Respectfully submitted this 22nd day of November, 2017.
