IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS
FORT SMITH DIVISION
TRIBUILT CONSTRUCTION GROUP, LLC
v.

PLAINTIFF

CASE NO. 10-CV-02052 (JLH)

INTERNATIONAL FIDELITY INS. CO.

DEFENDANT

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION
1.

Plaintiff incorporates its own summary judgment motion, brief, and facts

in response to Defendant’s summary judgment motion.
2.

Defendant argues that it will be “left holding the bag” if the attorneys who

make a recovery for Defendant’s benefit are compensated for their efforts. On the
contrary, Defendant is not going to be left “holding the bag” — it will be the beneficiary
of Plaintiff’s attorney’s efforts. Basically, Defendant wants something for nothing. It
refuses to exercise its subrogation rights and take over the litigation — it wants Plaintiff
to bear that expense — but would like to receive all the benefits, even at Plaintiff’s
attorney’s expense.
3.

But the law does not work that way, and because of the oldest of reasons:

Defendant’s position is simply not fair. “to allow the others to obtain the full benefit
from the plaintiff's efforts without requiring contribution or charging the common fund
for attorney fees would be to enrich the others unjustly at the expense of the plaintiff.”
Millsap v. Lane, 288 Ark. 439, 442 (Ark. 1986) (in context of the common fund doctrine)
citing Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714 (1966). See also Ark.
Code Ann. 16-22-304 (creating attorney’s lien on all causes of action).

Finally, to the extent that Defendant “disputes” Statement of Fact #32, that

is not a dispute of fact, but is actually a question of law for the Court. This Court can
determine, as a matter of law, if a subrogee can enjoy the benefits of recovered funds
without compensating the attorneys who recover it.
