STATEMENT OF UNDISPU"rED FACTS BY DEFENDANT
Comes now defendant, and submits the following material facts not in dispute, which
establish plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment:

1.

International Fidelity Insurance Company (IFIC) is a corporation organized under the

laws of New Jersey. Its principal business office is located in New Jersey.
2.

TriBuilt Construction Group, LLC (TriBuilt) is a limited liability company organized under

the laws of Arkansas. Its principal business office is in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The owners of
TriBuilt are Alan M. Harrison and Joseph E. Marrone.
3.

TriBuilt's principal business activity is acting as general contractor for commercial

construction projects.
4.

On or about August 8, 2008 TriBuilt, as prime contractor, entered into a fixed amount

contract with NISHA, LLC (NISHA), as owner, to construct a Country Inn and Suites hotel in

Case 2:10-cv-02052-PKH Document 24

Filed 06/28/10 Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 451

Conway, Arkansas in exchange for the sum of $3,628,000.00. A true copy ofthis contract with
"Addenda" is attached as Exhibits 2 and 3 to Ex. F (Harrison dep.) to defendant's Response
to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Response). Article 9, section 9.4 required TriBuilt
to furnish NISHA with a "performance bond".
5.

TriBuilt applied to IFIC for a performance bond for the NISHA project in a penal sum

equal to the construction contract amount. IFIC did not agree to write a $3,628,000.00 bond,
however, IFIC did agree to furnish a series of bonds in smaller amounts to be issued upon
completion of the work covered by the prior bonded work.

IFIC also agreed to furnish

"phased" Labor and Material Payment bonds in amounts equal to the performance bonds.
True and correct copies of the bonds issued by IFIC are attached to IFIC's Counterclaim as
Exhibit 1. After the first Performance and Labor and Material Bond dated October 20, 2008
(Bond No. LRIFSU 0361508) was issued IFIC required NISHA's architect to certify completion
of each "phase" - or Work Order - before IFIC furnished the next and subsequent Performance
and Labor and Material Payment Bonds. Harrison dep., p. 17 and Ex. 5 to it.
6.

The construction contract also required TriBuilt to furnish NISHA with interim and final

lien waivers from TriBuilt's subcontractors and materialmen as a condition of receiving periodic
and final payment. TriBuilt furnished NISHA many partial lien waivers as part of the payment
process, however, in the summer or fall of 2009, NISHA began receiving notices from some
of TriBuilt's subcontractors that they were not being paid.
7.

TriBuilt substantially completed the hotel project on or about August 21,2009, however,

TriBuilt has not received final payment from NISHA. Harrison dep., pp. 19, 20.
8.

In September, 2009 NISHA held $375,000.00 in earned but unpaid funds allegedly

2

Case 2:10-cv-02052-PKH Document 24

Filed 06/28/10 Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 452

owed TriBuilt, consisting of the "retainage" on the project. Harrison dep., p. 22.
9.

$116,961.08 of the retainage allegedly has been utilized by NISHA to pay three TriBuilt

subcontractors who asserted mechanic's liens against the hotel project. Those payments leave
$258,038.92 in retainage.
10.

TriBuilt and NISHA were unable to resolve their dispute over the final payment process.

NISHA asserted TriBuilt had to furnish final lien waivers from all subcontractors and material
suppliers prior to its obligation to make final payment of the retainage. TriBuilt asserted, on
the other hand, that NISHA and its lender, Centennial Bank, had to make final payment prior
to TriBuilt's obligation to supply final lien waivers by virtue of the October 15, 2008
"Authorization to Release Payment" attached as part of Exhibit A to the Response. TriBuilt also
asserted NISHA owed an additional $291,462.12 for "change order" work. NISHA denied
liability for the change orders and asserted TriBuilt is liable for $144,000.00 in liqUidated
damages. Harrison dep., pp. 22-24 and Ex. 9 to it. Ex. B to Response to Motion for Summary
Judgment.
11.

On November 4, 2009 TriBuilt sued NISHA and Centennial Bank in the Sebastian County

Circuit Court, Fort Smith Division, Case No. CV-2009-2097(I), for breach of contract, seeking
damages of $666,462.12 ($375,000.00 retainage plus $291,462.12 in change orders). On
December 4, 2009 TriBuilt filed an Amended and Substituted Complaint, adding other claims
against both NISHA and Bank.

NISHA and Bank responded with Motions to Dismiss, to

Transfer and to Compel Arbitration. TriBuilt has not filed or asserted a Mechanic's Lien on the
Project in Faulkner County, Arkansas.
12.

On January 12, 2010 the Circuit Court entered an Order compelling arbitration of
3

Case 2:10-cv-02052-PKH Document 24

Filed 06/28/10 Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 453

TriBuilt's contract claims against NISHA but retaining jurisdiction ofTriBuilt's tort claims against
NISHA and all TriBuilt claims against Bank. A true copy of this Order is attached as Exhibit A
to the Response. On January 3, 2010 NISHA Demanded arbitration with TriBuilt, asserting
TriBuilt owed NISHA $275,000.00, including liquidated damages of $144,000.00. A true copy
of this Demand is attached as Exhibit B to Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment.
13.

Meanwhile, on November 5,2009 NISHA notified IFIC of over $664,000.00 in potential

Payment and Material Bond Claims against the eight bonds furnished by IFIC, as surety.
Attached as Exhibit C to the Response is a true copy of NISHA's letter to IFIC with the
enclosure, a list of unpaid project bills in excess of $664,000.00.
14.

Upon receipt of the Exhibit C letter and list IFIC wrote NISHA a letter requesting NISHA

withhold further payment to TriBuilt pending IFIC's investigation. A true copy of this letter is
attached as Exhibit D to the Response.
15.

Since November 5, 2009 IFIC has received claims from TriBuilt's subcontractors and

material suppliers in the sum of $535,607.49. IFIC has paid the sum of $343,460.23 in claims
against the payment bonds it furnished NISHA on behalf of TriBuilt. The remaining claims are
being processed and investigated. Affidavit of Genise Teich attached as Exhibit G to Response.
16.

On April 26, 2010 IFIC made written demand on TriBuilt to deposit all monies received

or to be received pursuant to any and all construction contracts bonded by IFIC into a trust
account. A true copy of this demand is attached as Exhibit E to the Response.
17.

The amount in controversy is at least $75,000.00 since TriBuilt seeks 24% of

$660,000.00 as an attorney fee.

Paragraph 9 of Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts should read that the Agreement

of Indemnity - not the construction contract - is included in the moving papers as Exhibit "A".

19.

Paragraph 10 of Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts should read that the

Contractor (TriBuilt) undisputedly "substantially" completed construction of the hotel. NISHA
contends, however, that TriBuilt has not performed certain punch list work.
