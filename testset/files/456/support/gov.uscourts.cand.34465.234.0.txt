Notice of Motion and Motion
TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on November 10, 2008 at 9:00 a.m., or soon thereafter as
the matter may be heard, in Court Room 8 of the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, San Jose Division, defendant Google Inc. ("Google") will, and hereby,
does, move the Court for partial summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' claims that Google's
policy of delivering "clicks" valued at up to 120% of a user's designated "Daily Budget" is a
deceptive trade practice that violates California's Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code 0x00A70x00A7 17200 et seq., and False Advertising Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 0x00A70x00A7 17500 et seg. This
motion is made on the ground that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring those claims because even if
Google's policies were somehow deceptive (which Google denies), Plaintiffs suffered no injury
in fact and lost no money or property as a result. For the same reasons, Google moves for partial
summary judgment dismissing any claims that Plaintiffs overpaid for campaigns that were
cancelled after a portion of a month ("partial month" campaigns).

Google's motion is based on this Notice of Motion, the accompanying Memorandum of
Points and Authorities, the supporting Declarations of Adam Samet and David T. Biderman, filed
concurrently herewith, and the papers and records that are on file in this action, and such other
matters and arguments as may be presented to the Court prior to or at the hearing on the motion.

Memorandum of Points and Authorities

This is an action against Google by two participants in "AdWords," Google's online
advertising program. The AdWords program allows advertisers to have ads displayed in response
to particular search queries by internet users. A participating advertiser sets a "Daily Budget" to
control its costs, which in most cases are determined by the number of users that "click" on its
advertisement and are thus linked to that advertiser's designated website or sites. Because
internet traffic and query volumes fluctuate significantly, Google's software delivers more clicks
on some days to make up for other days when delivery is below the targeted level. In particular,
as Google explains when advertisers sign up, the AdWords program may deliver additional clicks

and charge advertisers up to 120% of their Daily Budget on a given day to make up for shortfalls.

This "120% Rule" ensures that advertisers' expenses in a given month equal, or nearly equal,
their Daily Budget times the number of days in that month, without going over that limit.

In its previous orders on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, this Court
granted summary judgment for Google on Plaintiffs' claims for breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment. See ECF Document No. 193 [Aug. 21, 2007
Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("ECF #
193")] at 16-17, 20; ECF Document No. 223 [May 14, 2008 Order Granting in Part and Denying
in Part Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("ECF # 223")] at 3-4. The Court also
denied summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claims for (1) breach of contract; (2) violation of
California's Unfair Competition Law ("UCL"), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 0x00A70x00A7 17200 et seg.; and (3)
violation of California's False Advertising Law ("FAL"), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 0x00A70x00A7 17500 et
seq. See ECF # 193 at 16, 19; ECF # 223 at 3-4, 8, 11. On Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim,

this Court held that

[uJnder the plain language of the AdWords Agreement, Google is
not in breach of the "Daily Budget" provision if the following two
things are true: (1) in any particular day in which a customer's ad
campaign is running, Google charges that customer no more than
120% of his or her "Daily Budget;" and (2) in any particular month
iii which a customer's ad is running, Google charges a customer no
more than his or her "Daily Budget" multiplied by the days in
which the ad ran in the month. Accordingly, the Court finds that
Google's practice of charging customers up to 120% of their
"Daily Budget" does not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of
the AdWords Agreement.

ECF # 223 at 8 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted). On the other hand, the Court determined
that a breach might exist if advertisers "were charged more than their `Daily Budget' multiplied
by the number of days in which their ad campaigns were running," potentially including
customers running "partial month" campaigns and customers who "paused" their campaigns
during the month. See id. at 15-16.

On Plaintiffs' UCL and FAL claims, this Court found that there were triable issues of fact
as to whether a reasonable consumer would have been deceived by Google's use of the term

"Daily Budget." See ECF # 193 at 19; ECF # 223 at 10-11. In addition to the "partial month"

and "pausing" issues described above, this Court suggested that confusion over the term "Daily
Budget" may have injured advertisers who on certain days received more clicks than the targets
that their Daily Budgets implied. ECF # 223 at 11, fn.10.

Unlike the potential injury from "partial month" and "pausing" issues, the potential injury
from receiving more than the targeted number of clicks on particular days is not that advertisers
paid more for clicks than they had agreed. See id. at 8 (holding that Google's application of the
120% Rule did not violate the AdWords Agreement). Rather, the Court indicated that such an
injury might arise if an advertiser lost business opportunities to obtain new customers or retain
old ones due to the delivery of clicks in excess of its Daily Budget on certain days. As the Court
put it, "the system could result in `overexposure' on certain days, which could create difficulties
in meeting demand and maintaining customer satisfaction." Jd. at.11, fn.10.

This motion focuses primarily on the purported injury caused by Google's occasional
delivery of clicks above Plaintiffs' Daily Budget pursuant to the 120% Rule. As a matter of law,
to have standing to assert UCL or FAL claims, a private plaintiff must allege and prove that (1) he
suffered an injury in fact; and (2) he lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition
or false advertising. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 0x00A70x00A7 17204, 17535. As to the occasional delivery of
clicks above their Daily Budgets, the named Plaintiffs cannot meet this standing requirement.
First, Plaintiffs have no evidence that receiving more visitors to their websites on certain days
caused them to lose any business or caused them any other injury. Second, even if Plaintiffs had
such evidence, lost business opportunities do not qualify as "lost money or property" within the
meaning of the UCL and FAL.

At a minimum, even if Plaintiffs could show an injury in fact and a loss of money or
property from an occasional increase of clicks and traffic to their websites, Plaintiffs have no
standing to seek restitution of that money or property for the period after they learned that Google
delivered clicks and charged advertisers up to 120% of their Daily Budgets on some days.
Standing under the UCL and FAL requires a causal nexus between the acts of unfair competition
or false advertising and a plaintiff's injury. Once Plaintiffs had the 120% Rule explained to them,

any previous confusion was moot and could no longer cause them compensable injury.

Finally, Plaintiffs also cannot maintain any claim that they were injured and lost money or
property as a result of running "partial month" campaigns. As discussed below, the evidence is
clear and indisputable: neither Plaintiff was ever charged more than its Daily Budget multiplied
by the number of days in which its advertising campaign ran in any month. The only claims on

which Plaintiffs can conceivably proceed to trial are their "pausing" claims.

Statement of Facts

A. The AdWords Program, "Daily Budgets," the "120% Rule," and Pausing

Under the AdWords program, Google posts "sponsored link" ads on its websites or its
syndication partner websites. ECF # 193 at 2; ECF #223 at 2; ECF Document No. 88
[Declaration of Michael Schulman in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment ("Schulman
Decl.")], 43. When an internet user clicks on a sponsored link, he or she is sent to the website or
sites designated by the advertiser that purchased the advertisement. ECF # 193 at 2; ECF # 223 at
2; Schulman Decl., 5. Google generally charges advertisers based on the number of times their
ads are clicked on by users, using a methodology called cost-per-click ("CPC"). Schulman Decl.,
95.

In creating their AdWords campaigns, advertisers set a Daily Budget. ECF # 193 at 2-3;
ECF # 223 at 3; Schulman Decl., 9. Through their Daily Budget, advertisers can control the
charges they incur over the course of a month. ECF # 193 at 2-3; ECF # 223 at 3; Schulman
Decl., { 9; ECF Document No. 90 [Declaration of M. Christopher Jhang in Support of First
Motion for Summary Judgment ("Shang Decl.")], Ex. D (Excerpts of FAQs for AdWords
program at 84 & 125 of 489).

The number of clicks that an advertiser receives for a campaign can vary from day to day
depending on the usage patterns of internet users. Schulman Decl., 0x00A7 7. To account for this
fluctuation, and to make up for days when the number of clicks delivered is below the targeted
amount and advertisers accordingly are charged less than their Daily Budget, the AdWords
program may deliver more clicks and charge advertisers up to 120% of their Daily Budget on
other days in the same month. ECF # 193 at 4, 6-7; Jhang Decl., Ex. D (Excerpts of FAQs for
AdWords program at 84 & 125 of 489); ECF Document No. 206-12, Ex. F [Deposition of

Heather Wilburn ("Wilburn Depo."')] at 67:22-68:20. Over the course of a month, this "120%
Rule" is designed to make an advertiser's charges equal or come as close as possible to its Daily
Budget times the number of days in that month-but never exceed that amount. ECF # 193 at 4;
Jhang Decl., Ex. D (Excerpts of FAQs for AdWords program at 84 & 125 of 489); Wilburn Depo.
at 67:22-68:20. If an advertiser's daily charges ever exceed 120% of its Daily Budget or its
monthly charges exceed its Daily Budget times the number of days in that month, Google
provides the advertiser an "overdelivery credit." ECF #193 at 3; Jhang Decl., Ex. D (Excerpts of
FAQs for AdWords program at 84 & 125 of 489).

At all times, an AdWords advertiser has the option of "pausing" its campaign to stop its
ads from being displayed. ECF # 193 at 3, 7; Jnang Decl., Ex. D (Excerpts of FAQs for
AdWords program at 261 of 489). No charges accrue to an advertiser when its campaign is
paused. ECF # 193 at 7; Jhang Decl., Ex. D (Excerpts of FAQs for AdWords program at 261 of
489). Advertisers may "un-pause" their campaigns when and if they wish to resume delivery of
clicks. Jhang Decl., Ex. D (Excerpts of FAQs for AdWords program at 261 of 489).

B. Plaintiffs' Advertising Campaigns

Plaintiff CLRB Hanson Industries, LLC is an industrial printing business that began
running campaigns with Google's AdWords program in July 2002. ECF # 223 at 2; Declaration
of David T. Biderman in Support of Google Inc.'s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on
Plaintiffs' "120% Rule" and "Partial Month" Claims ("Biderman Decl."), 42, Ex. A [Deposition
of CLRB Hanson representative Brett R. Hanson ("Hanson Depo.")] at 20:10-15. Plaintiff
Howard Stern runs a homework-solving business called "homeworksolver.net" and began
running AdWords campaigns in October 2003. See ECF # 223 at 2; Biderman Decl., 93, Ex. B
[Deposition of Howard Stern ("Stern Depo.")] at 20:10-17.

Plaintiffs were sometimes charged more than 100% of their Daily Budgets on particular
days, but only when Google delivered additional clicks to offset shortfalls occurring during the
same month. Declaration of Adam Samet in Support of Google Inc.'s Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' "120% Rule" and "Partial Month" Claims ("Samet Decl."), J

11. Consistent with Google's policy, neither Plaintiff was ever charged more than 120% of its

Daily Budget on a given day. Jd. Moreover, Plaintiffs' monthly charges never exceeded their
Daily Budgets multiplied by the number of days in each month. Jd. When either Plaintiff
canceled an advertising campaign after only part of a month, Google did not charge that Plaintiff
more than its Daily Budget times the number of days that its campaign was running in that month.
Id.

Both Plaintiffs testified that they paused their AdWords campaigns when they did not
want to receive clicks. Hanson Depo. at 72:18-25, 82:5-13; Stern Depo. at 75:19-76:11. Brett
Hanson, the representative of CLRB Hanson, paused CLRB Hanson's advertising campaigns
when there was "[lJack of capacity within the plant" to take on additional work. Hanson Depo. at
72:18-25. Hansen also paused the campaigns when CLRB Hanson "met [its] targeted return on
investment at that point and there [was] no need to continue expending money" on clicks. Jd.
Hanson paused CLRB Hanson's campaigns on weekends as well. Jd. at 82:5-13. For his part,
Plaintiff Stern testified that he paused his campaigns "on the weekends because I don't think
people are going to be responding, and I'm not available to work on these problems on the
weekends" and when he was "out of [his] home on vacation." Stern Depo. at 75:19-76:11.

Both Plaintiffs sent emails to Google complaining about being charged more than their
Daily Budget on certain days. Hanson Depo. at 132:19-134:4, 137:23-138:20, 174:3-17; Stern
Depo. at 99:17-24, 104:2-16. In both cases, Google employees responded to these emails by
explaining the 120% Rule. Hanson Depo. at 135:20-137:15, 169:16-170:15, 177:19-178:9; Stern
Depo. at 99:17-100:15, 104:2-105:24. Specifically, Google informed Brett Hanson in March
2005 of its practice of sometimes charging advertisers up to 120% of their Daily Budget. Hanson
Depo. at 135:20-137:15, 169:16-170:15, 177:19-178:9. Google explained to Hanson: "In
general, we try to keep your daily cost fluctuation to no more than 20 percent above your daily
