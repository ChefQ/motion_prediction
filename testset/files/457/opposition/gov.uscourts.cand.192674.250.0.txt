The Court’s Order Granting In Part And Denying In Part Plaintiff’s Motion For Summary

INTRODUCTION

3

Judgment Of Non-Infringement And Denying Defendants’ Motion For Partial Summary

4

Judgment Of Infringement (the “Order”), as understood by AB, is correct in all respects. The

5

Order correctly determines that the SOLiD System employing two-base encoding, which is the

6

only SOLiD System ever sold, does not infringe the ’341 or ’597 patents. The Court correctly

7

ruled that Illumina waived the doctrine of equivalents as to the ’341 and ’597 patents by failing to

8

respond to AB’s direct and specific (not “vague and conclusory”) doctrine of equivalents

9

argument in its Summary Judgment Motion. The Court’s ruling is also correct that the Agencourt

10

one-base encoding prototype did not infringe the ’341 patent. In the prototype the initializing

11

oligonucleotide probe did not hybridize to the target polynucleotide as required by the claims of

12

the ’341 patent and the Court’s claim construction.

13

AB does not understand the Order to grant summary judgment that the one-base encoding

14

prototype does not infringe the ’597 patent. AB did not seek that relief in its motion. This does

15

not mean, as argued by Illumina in seeking reconsideration, that it is entitled to summary

16

judgment that the one-base encoding prototype does infringe the ’597 patent. As explained herein

17

and in AB’s summary judgment briefing, multiple fact issues regarding infringement and AB’s

18

affirmative defenses preclude the granting of Illumina’s motion.

DISCUSSION
A.

Solexa Waived its Infringement Argument Under the Doctrine of
Equivalents and Has Not Established Grounds for Reconsideration.

Solexa acknowledges that “[a] motion for leave to file a Motion for Reconsideration must

23

specifically show that one or more of three specific grounds for reconsideration exist. L. R. 7-

24

9(b)(1)-(3).” (Mot. at 3.) These three grounds are (1) a material difference in fact or law than

25

that which was previously presented to the Court before entry of the order at issue; (2) new

26

material facts or a change of law since entry of the order at issue; and (3) “manifest failure by the

27

Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments which were presented to the Court

28

before such interlocutory order.” L. R. 7-9(b)(1)-(3). However, in requesting that this Court

1

reconsider its holding that Solexa waived the doctrine of equivalents, Solexa fails to establish, or

2

even attempt to establish, the existence of at least one of these three grounds as required under the

3

Rules of this Court.

4

Solexa does not dispute the Court’s finding that in its opposition, “Solexa made no

5

infringement argument under the doctrine of equivalents despite the fact it was raised by AB in its

6

opening brief.” (Mot. at 5.) Because Solexa did not dispute AB’s doctrine of equivalents

7

argument in its opposition, Solexa cannot now contend (1) that there is “a material difference in

8

fact or law than …was presented to the Court”; (2) that there are “new material facts or a change

9

of law”; or (3) that the Court manifestly failed “to consider material facts or dispositive legal

10

arguments which were presented to the Court.” L.R. 7-9(b)(1)-(3). This Court properly

11

considered the absence of such facts and arguments in the face of AB’s arguments, and affirmed

12

that “[i]f a party fails to assert a legal reason why summary judgment should not be granted, that

13

ground is waived and cannot be considered or raised on appeal.” (Order at 19 n.6 (internal

14

quotation omitted).) The Local Rules do not authorize a motion for reconsideration under these

15

circumstances.

16

Instead of demonstrating grounds for leave to file a Motion for Reconsideration, Solexa

17

makes the argument that it failed to make in its opposition, and thus waived. In doing so, Solexa

18

selectively cites a portion of AB’s doctrine of equivalents argument from its Motion for Summary

19

Judgment: ”Illumina is estopped based on the arguments it made during prosecution because

20

Macevicz’s arguments clearly and unambiguously narrowed the scope of the claims.” (Mot. at 6

21

(internal quotation omitted).) Solexa then ignores the rest of AB’s argument, falsely telling this

22

Court that “AB did not identify which ‘arguments’ it was relying upon.” (Id.)

23

In fact, the portion of AB’s Motion selectively quoted by Solexa goes on to identify the

24

arguments at issue as those “Macevicz made to the PTO” in which he “clearly and

25

unambiguously narrowed the scope of the claims, surrendering subject matter relating to when in

26

the claimed process the ‘identifying’ step must be performed.” (AB’s Motion at 16, Docket No.

27

207.) AB then cites pages 13-14 of this Court’s Claim Construction Order, in which the Court,

28

on page 14, quotes in full Macevicz’s arguments to the PTO that were at issue. AB’s citation to

Macevicz’s PTO arguments is a more than sufficient ground for this Court’s grant of summary

2

judgment under Celotex, which states that a motion for summary judgment “may, and should, be

3

granted so long as whatever is before the district court demonstrates that the standard for the entry

4

of summary judgment, as set forth in Rule 56(c) is satisfied.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.

5

317, 323 (1986).

6

Solexa moves from selective quoting to disingenuousness when it claims to be so

7

unfamiliar with AB’s prosecution history argument that it could not be “required to ‘fill-in-the-

8

blanks’ in a speculative attempt to rebut AB’s two vague and wholly conclusory sentences about

9

Macevicz’s ‘arguments’ during prosecution.” (Mot. at 6.) Solexa is intimately familiar with

10

AB’s prosecution history estoppel arguments in this case. The Court, in fact, poked a little fun at

11

the parties in its Claim Construction Order on this subject: ”[t]he parties spill much ink over how

12

the term ‘identifying’ should be construed.” (Claim Const. Order at 13, Docket No. 133.) In

13

light of both parties’ extensive, prior briefing of the estoppel issue, Solexa made a strategic

14

decision not to respond to AB’s doctrine of equivalents argument, and instead concentrate on

15

literal infringement. Indeed, Illumina did not address the doctrine of equivalents at the motion

16

hearing despite AB having pointed out Illumina’s waiver in its reply brief. (AB’s MSJ Reply Br.

17

at 7, Docket No. 225.)

18

Because Solexa chose not “to assert a legal reason why summary judgment should not be

19

granted [with respect to AB’s doctrine of equivalents arguments], that ground is waived and

20

cannot be considered or raised on appeal.” (Order at 19 n.6 (quoting Vaughner v. Pulito, 804

21

F.2d 873, 877 n.2 (5th Cir. 1986)).) This Court was correct in holding that “Solexa has thus

22

waived its reliance on” its “infringement argument under the doctrine of equivalents.” (Id.)

23

B.

24

The One-Base Encoding Prototype Did Not Infringe the ’341 Patent
Because The Initializing Oligonucleotide Probe Was Hybridized to the
Binding Region, Not the Target Polynucleotide.

25

In its motion for reconsideration, Solexa neglected to mention that AB also argued that the

26

one-base encoding prototype did not infringe the ’341 patent because the “initializing

27

oligonucleotide probe” was not “hybridized to the target polynucleotide” as required by all of the

28

claims of the ’341 patent. (See AB’s Opp’n at 11, Docket No. 216.) A key limitation of claim 1

1

of the ’341 patent is that step (a) requires “an initializing oligonucleotide probe hybridized to a

2

target polynucleotide.” In its Claim Construction Order, the Court held that the express language

3

of the claim requires that the initializing oligonucleotide probe hybridize to the target

4

polynucleotide, not the binding region. (Claim Const. Order at 8-9.) No accused product –

5

including the one-base encoding prototype at issue in Illumina’s motion – met this limitation.

6

Therefore, the Court correctly concluded that the one-base encoding prototype did not infringe

7

the ’341 patent as a matter of law.

8
9
10
11
12

There was no dispute over how this aspect of the prototype worked. The only dispute was
the correct construction of “hybridized to a target polynucleotide,” which the Court already
resolved in determining the correct construction of “initializing oligonucleotide probe.”
In its Claim Construction Order, the Court found that the patent clearly distinguishes
between the binding region and the target polynucleotide:

13

The language makes clear that a binding region and the target
polynucleotide are connected, and together form the template. . . .
The binding region, target polynucleotide, and template are each
distinct items.

14
15
16

(Id. at 8-9 (emphasis added).) The Court held that the express language of the claim requires that

17

the initializing oligonucleotide probe hybridize to the target polynucleotide, not the binding

18

region. (Id.)

19

Illumina sought to reargue, through its expert, the same claim construction position the

20

Court already rejected. Dr. Backman tried to conflate the “binding region” and the “target

21

polynucleotide,” despite the Court’s conclusion that the terms are distinct: “I respectfully

22

disagree with Judge Alsup’s statement that the use of the term ‘target polynucleotide’ in claim 1

23

represents a ‘drafting error.’” (Comer Decl. Ex. I (Backman Report) ¶ 136, Docket No. 212.) Dr.

24

Backman then repeated Illumina’s legal argument that the distinctions between the target

25

polynucleotide, the binding region, and the template can be ignored as only part of a preferred

26

embodiment. (Id. ¶ 136; Solexa’s Reply Claim Const. Br. at 8, 11, Docket No. 100.) That

27

position was addressed and rejected during claim construction. (Claim Const. Order at 9 (“The

28

binding region, target polynucleotide, and template are each distinct items.”).)

AB also showed that amendment-based estoppel barred Illumina from asserting the

2

doctrine of equivalents because Macevicz narrowed the scope of the claim limitation at issue

3

through an amendment in response to a rejection by the Patent Office. Norian Corp. v. Stryker

4

Corp., 432 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo

5

Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722, 741 (2002)). In the original application, Macevicz drafted claim 1

6

to read “extending an initializing oligonucleotide along the polynucleotide.” (Comer Decl. Ex. N

7

at 28, Docket No. 212 (emphasis added).) This used the broad term “polynucleotide,” rather than

8

any of the specific terms Macevicz used in the specification: target polynucleotide, binding

9

region, or template. The Examiner rejected this language as indefinite. (Id. Ex. D at 3.) In

10

amending the claim in response to the rejection, Macevicz could have chosen to replace

11

“polynucleotide” with any of the three specific terms he used in the specification – “target

12

polynucleotide,” “binding region,” or “template.” He chose “target polynucleotide” and thereby

13

relinquished any additional claim scope that would have been covered by those other terms or by

14

the original term “polynucleotide.” (Id. Ex. E at 2-3.) Illumina cannot recapture that relinquished

15

claim scope through the doctrine of equivalents.1

16

Illumina’s only response was to try to duck under an exception that applies when “the

17

rationale underlying the amendment . . . bear[s] no more than a tangential relation to the

18

equivalent in question.” Festo Corp., 535 U.S. at 740. (Illumina’s Opp’n at 18-19, Docket No.

19

213.) The Federal Circuit cautions that this exception “for overcoming the Festo presumption is

20

very narrow.” Cross Med. Prods., Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 480 F.3d 1335, 1342

Even if Illumina had been entitled to assert the doctrine of equivalents, it could not (and
did not attempt to) show that hybridizing the primer to the binding region is equivalent to
hybridizing the primer to the target polynucleotide. Its expert, Dr. Backman, had already
admitted that hybridizing the primer to a fully-known binding region provides advantages in
efficiency, consistency, and convenience:
Linking the target polynucleotide to a binding region of known
sequence is advantageous because it allows predesigned initializing
oligonucleotides to be used in the claimed method. . . . Because
these regions and oligonucleotides are pre-designed, they can be
tested, optimized, and kept conveniently at hand for use.

1

(Fed. Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 614 (2007). The amendment changing “polynucleotide”

2

to “target polynucleotide” does not fit this very narrow exception for two alternative reasons.

3

First, no rationale was given for the amendment. “If the prosecution history reveals no

4

reason for the narrowing amendment, the presumption is not rebutted. Silence does not overcome

5

the presumption.” Honeywell Int’l, Inc. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 523 F.3d 1304, 1315-16

6

(Fed. Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). Illumina conceded that no reason was given:

7
8
9

[In the amendment] in which the applicant explained the rationales
underlying the various amendments to the pending claims, there is
no discussion of the change of “polynucleotide” to “target
polynucleotide” (or of the terms “binding region” or “template”).

10

(Illumina’s Opp’n at 19, Docket No. 213.) This was an admission that the tangential relation

11

exception cannot be met.

12

Second, if there were any reason for changing “polynucleotide” to “target

13

polynucleotide,” it was to overcome the indefiniteness rejection by specifying where the

14

initializing oligonucleotide hybridizes, which is directly related to the equivalent in question. The

15

indefiniteness rejection was based on where the initializing oligonucleotide hybridizes:

16
17
18
19

The claims are vague and indefinite because in the independent
Claim 1, it is unclear as to what limitations are involved in the
identifying step (b) and how it is related to step (a), for instance, the
relative position of the nucleotide(s), with respect to the initializing
oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide probe and the duplex, which is
to be identified is not recited.

20

(Comer Decl. Ex. D ¶ 3, Docket No. 212 (emphasis added).) Amending the claim to specify “an

21

initializing oligonucleotide probe hybridized to a target polynucleotide” surrendered any claim

22

scope over potential equivalents based on hybridizing the initializing oligonucleotide probe

23

elsewhere, such as the binding region or template. Illumina was therefore precluded from

24

asserting the doctrine of equivalents.

25

Illumina further precluded itself from relying on the doctrine of equivalents by not

26

addressing it in opposition to AB’s motion. PC Connector Solutions LLC v. Smartdisk Corp.,

27

406 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (affirming summary judgment of noninfringement where

28

patentee offered only “conclusory statements regarding equivalence”). Illumina’s opposition did

1

not even offer conclusory statements regarding equivalence – it simply asserts without

2

explanation that there is a “factual dispute.” (Illumina’s Opp’n at 17, Docket No. 213.)

3

Accordingly, Illumina waived the doctrine of equivalents as a ground for opposing summary

4

judgment of noninfringement as to this limitation as well.

5
6
7

C.

The One-Base Encoding Prototype Was Used To Identify A Base
Within Each Cycle, But It Did Not Infringe.

Solexa argues that the Court did not consider the arguments regarding whether the one-

8

base prototype infringed the ’341 and ’597 patents. AB raised a number of noninfringement

9

grounds in opposition to Solexa’s motion for summary judgment as to the prototype. Each of

10
11
12

these grounds supported, and required, denial of Solexa’s motion.
1.

The Use of the Prototype was De Minimis.

AB argued in its opposition to Solexa’s motion for summary judgment that infringement

13

cannot be found because the use was de minimis. (See AB’s Opp’n at 17-18, Docket No. 216.)

14

The one-base prototype is so insignificant that Illumina did not have its damages expert evaluate

15

damages attributable to the prototype. (Pai Decl. Ex. 3 (Siuta Dep.) at 160:1-7, Docket No. 219

16

(“Q. If we assume that the two base encoding version of the SOLiD system is found not to

17

infringe, what are the appropriate damages in this case? A. I don’t have an opinion on that at this

18

moment. That’s not something that I considered.”).)

19

The Federal Circuit recognizes a de minimis exception to patent infringement. Embrex,

20

Inc. v. Serv. Eng’g Corp., 216 F.3d 1343, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2000). While the Federal Circuit has

21

not set precise boundaries for the exception, there is a question of fact as to whether AB’s use of

22

the prototype, which was used for internal research and never marketed or sold to the public,

23

qualifies for the exception. See Baxter Diagnostics Inc. v. AVL Scientific Corp., 924 F. Supp.

24

994, 1016, modified on other grounds, 954 F. Supp. 199 (C.D. Cal. 1996) (de minimis

25

infringement exists where the manufacture or sale is insignificant in amount and where alleged

26

infringing activity is terminated at the de minimis stage); Maxon Premix Burner Co. v. Eclipse

27

Fuel Eng’g Co., 471 F.2d 308, 317 (7th Cir. 1972) (holding that manufacture and sale of a single

28

experimental prototype would be excused as de minimis activity). Factual disputes regarding the

1

nature and extent of Agencourt’s use of the one-base encoding prototype required denial of

2

Illumina’s motion for summary judgment.

3

2.

4

AB’s Defenses Based On Ownership Precluded Summary
Judgment.

5

AB also argued in opposition to Illumina’s motion that even if the Court were to accept

6

every representation and argument offered by Illumina, its motion must still be denied because

7

Illumina failed to overcome AB’s affirmative defenses. (See Order at 11, Docket No. 88 (statute

8

of limitations defense basis for denial of summary judgment).) The issues of fact regarding AB’s

9

defenses, which were never addressed by Illumina, preclude summary judgment of infringement.

10

Summary judgment of infringement is precluded unless Illumina demonstrated that there is no

11

genuine issue of material fact that all of AB’s affirmative defenses must fail. See 10B Charles

12

Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2734, at 256 (3d ed. 1998)

13

(“A claimant is entitled to summary judgment only when . . . every one of the defenses asserted

14

legally are insufficient”). Illumina did not do so. AB’s defenses ─ ownership, standing, shop

15

rights, equitable rights to practice the patents, estoppel, and unclean hands ─ are all based on its

16

legal or equitable title to the Macevicz patents and Illumina’s misconduct in claiming title to the

17

patents. (See Docket Nos. 61, 70.) The Court has already held that there are disputed issues of

18

fact that require trial.2 (See Orders, Docket Nos. 88, 180.)

19

III.

20

On all of the issues presented by the parties’ motions for summary judgment, the Court’s

21

rulings are correct. They should not be reconsidered. Illumina’s complaints are that it disagrees

22

with the Court’s rulings or that it wants the Court to provide further explanation for its rulings.

23
24
25
26
27

CONCLUSION

2

Even if the Court had ruled on statute of limitations grounds that AB was precluded from
making an affirmative claim of ownership of the patents, evidence of ownership would remain
relevant to AB’s affirmative defenses. See Styne v. Stevens, 26 Cal. 4th 42, 51 (2001) (“Under
well-established authority, a defense may be raised at any time, even if the matter alleged would
be barred by a statute of limitations if asserted as the basis for affirmative relief.”); see generally
3 Bernard E. Witkin, California Procedure § 423 (4th ed. 1996). Thus, even if AB’s affirmative
state law causes of action had been barred, defenses based on Macevicz’s misconduct would still
be viable.

To the extent that Illumina disagrees with the Court’s rulings, it has not shown grounds for

2

reconsideration under Local Rule 7-9. To the extent that it seeks further explanation, its request

seems presumptuous, given that Illumina’s arguments on the key summary judgment issues
