INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF RELIEF SOUGHT
Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-9, Solexa seeks clarification of, and leave to file a motion

Document 236

seeking reconsideration of, the Court’s August 22, 2008 Order.1
First, Solexa requests that the Court clarify that its grant of summary judgment of non-

4
5

infringement regarding the ‘341 and ‘597 patents applies only to the “two-base-encoding” version

6

of the SOLiD System. As written, the Court’s holding of non-infringement of the “identifying”

7

limitation in the asserted claims might be interpreted to apply not only to the two-base-encoding

8

version of the SOLiD System (which was the sole subject of AB’s arguments regarding non-

9

infringement of the “identifying” limitation), but also to the one-base-encoding version (which, in

10

its opposition brief, AB expressly admitted satisfied the “identifying” limitation). Indeed, in dis-

11

cussion between counsel, AB has indicated that it considers the Order as having “resolved” the

12

‘341 patent in regard to infringement by the one-base-encoding version and as having left “only

13

the ‘597 and ‘119 as open issues,” i.e., AB takes the position that the Court has granted summary

14

judgment of non-infringement of the ‘341 patent as to both the two-base- and one-base-encoding

15

versions of the SOLiD System. Solexa requests that the Court clarify its Order so that the parties

16

can go forward with a clear understanding of what issues remain for trial in this case regarding

17

the one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System.

18

Second, given AB’s admission of infringement, Solexa seeks leave to file a motion seek-

19

ing reconsideration of the Court’s denial of Solexa’s motion for summary judgment of infringe-

20

ment of the ‘341 and ‘597 patents by the one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System.
Finally, Solexa seeks leave to file a motion seeking reconsideration of the Court’s holding

21
22

that Solexa waived reliance on the Doctrine of Equivalents with regard to the “identifying” limi-

23

tation in the asserted claims of the ‘341 and ‘597 patents, because AB’s vague and conclusory

24

comments about that issue in its opening brief were wholly inadequate to require a response by

25

Solexa.

ARGUMENT

2

A.

3

The Court should clarify that its holding of non-infringement of the ‘341 and
‘597 patents applies only to the two-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System

4

It is undisputed that AB has made, used, and sold the “two-base-encoding” version of the

5

SOLiD System, which the Court has found does not infringe the ‘341 or ‘597 patents. But it is

6

also undisputed that AB’s predecessor-in-interest, Agencourt, also made and used a “one-base-

7

encoding” version of the SOLiD System.2 In its motion for summary judgment, AB requested that

8

the Court find “(1) that all versions of the SOLiD System (including any one-base-encoding pro-

9

totypes) do not infringe any asserted claims of the ‘341 and ‘119 patents; and (2) that all two-base

10

encoding versions of the Solid System do not infringe the sole asserted claim of the ‘597 patent.”3

11

But AB never sought summary judgment that the one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD Sys-

12

tem did not infringe claim 1 of the ‘597 patent (on any ground), and it never sought summary

13

judgment that the one-base-encoding version did not satisfy the “identifying” limitation in the

14

claims of either the ‘341 or ‘597 patents.
Although the Court’s discussion in the Order was limited to how the two-base-encoding

15
16

version of the SOLiD System does not satisfy the “identifying” term in the claims of the ‘341 and

17

‘597 patents, the Order nevertheless includes the blanket statement that “summary judgment of

18

non-infringement as to all asserted claims of the ‘341 and ‘597 patents is GRANTED,” without

19

specifying whether the grant was with regard to the two-base-encoding or one-base-encoding ver-

20

sions (or both) of the SOLiD System.
Because it is currently unclear what issues remain for trial with regard to infringement of

21
22

these patents by the one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System, Solexa respectfully re-

23

quests that the Court clarify that it has only granted summary judgment of non-infringement with

24
25
26
27
28

2

As AB admitted in its Opposition (Docket No. 216 at 17-18), the “one-base-encoding” version of the SOLiD System used oligonucleotide probes where the fluorescent labels on the probes
corresponded to the identity of a single base, while the “two-base-encoding” format uses oligonucleotide probes where the fluorescent labels on the probes correspond to the identity of two adjacent bases.

regard to the two-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System, because the two-base-encoding

5

The Court should reconsider its denial of Solexa's motion for summary
judgment of infringement of the ‘341 and ‘597 patents by the one-baseencoding version of the SOLiD System

The Local Rules for the Northern District of California provide that a motion for recon-

6

sideration may not be noticed “without first obtaining leave of Court to file the motion.”4 A mo-

7

tion for leave to file a Motion for Reconsideration must specifically show that one or more of

8

three specific grounds for reconsideration exist.5 In this case, because the record shows “a mani-

9

fest failure by the Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments which were pre-

10

sented to the Court”6 regarding Solexa’s motion for summary judgment of infringement of claim

11

1 of the ‘597 patent and claim 1 of the ‘341 patent by the one-base-encoding version of the

12

SOLiD System, the Court should reconsider its denial of Solexa’s motion.

13

Solexa moved for partial summary judgment that the one-base-encoding version of the

14

SOLiD System infringed both the ‘341 and ‘597 patents.7 As AB admitted in its Opposition to

15

Solexa’s motion,8 the one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System, developed and used by

16

Agencourt, used sets of oligonucleotide probes in which each oligonucleotide probe in the set was

17

assigned a fluorescent dye (“label”) corresponding to the identity of one of the bases in a specific

18

position (the “interrogation position”).9

19

1

Solexa’s motion for summary judgment of infringement as to the one-base-encoding version. The

2

Order does not provide a basis for denial of Solexa’s motion with regard to the one-base-encoding

3

version of the SOLiD System,10 or, indeed, any indication that the Court considered the evidence

4

presented in Solexa’s motion (or the admission in AB’s opposition brief) that the one-base-

5

encoding version satisfied the “identifying” limitation in the claims of the ‘341 and ‘597 patents.

6

The Order suggests that the Court only considered the operation of the two-base-encoding

7

version of the SOLiD System in reaching its conclusion regarding the parties’ motions for sum-

8

mary judgment. For example, the Order states:

9

The record is clear that the Solid System does not literally determine the identity
of a base in the target sequence on each and every cycle when a new probe is hybridized to the target sequence. This, of course, is because the Solid System employs a two-base identification scheme with software at the back end of the system
to decode the sequence.11

10
11
12

Such statements in the Order suggest that the Court did not consider the operation of the
13
one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System, or whether this system infringed the ‘341 and
14

‘597 patents as alleged by Solexa in its motion for partial summary judgment.12 The Court’s ap-

Id. at 14. See also id. at 6 (“The Solid System is a DNA sequencing machine that operates
by interrogating two bases of an unknown DNA sequence at a time.”) (emphasis added), and id.
at 7 (“Unlike the inventions in the asserted patents, however, the Solid System assigns a color label that is based on the identity of two bases in the probe - not one.”) (emphasis added). Likewise,
none of the Figures used in the Court’s discussion of the operation of “the SOLiD System” relate
to the one-base-encoding version. See id. at 7-10, Figures 5-8 (indeed, Figure 6 is specifically entitled “SOLiD Two Base Encoding”) (id. at 8).
12

Based on other statements in the Order, it appears that the Court would agree with Solexa
that a one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System would satisfy the “identifying” limitation
in the asserted claims of the ‘341 and ‘597 patents. For example, the Court stated that the ‘341
patent describes the use of oligonucleotide probes in which “each oligonucleotide probe in the set
of probes is assigned a label corresponding to the identity of one of the bases located in the same
position as the other probes.” Id. at 3 (emphasis added). These probes are one-base-encoding
probes, not two-base encoding probes. See id. at 4, Fig. 1, and 5, Fig. 2. The Court further stated
that when one-base-encoding probes are hybridized to a target, “[t]he specific oligonucleotide
probe that hybridized may then be identified by recording the label that had previously been assigned to it (e.g., yellow) . . . . Once the color for the probe has been determined, the user then
knows the specific identity of a nucleotide in the probe (e.g., the fifth nucleotide is an A)” (id. at
4) (emphasis added), that “[r]epeating this process by ligating further oligonucleotide probes to
the previously ligated probe allows additional nucleotide bases in the DNA target sequence to be

parent oversight justifies granting Solexa leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the denial

2

of its motion.

3

Most importantly, the Court should reconsider its denial of Solexa’s motion because in its

4

Opposition brief,13 AB admitted that the one-base-encoding version of the SOLiD System satis-

5

fied the “identifying” limitation. AB admitted that “the prototype [i.e., the one-base-encoding

6

version of the SOLiD System] used one-base encoded probes in which the label on each probe

7

corresponded one-to-one with the identity of the target nucleotide being interrogated, and was

8

therefore used to determine the identity of a base within each cycle.”14 AB’s only arguments re-

9

garding infringement by the one-base-encoding version were that its infringement was excusable

10

as de minimis15 and that its affirmative ownership defenses precluded summary judgment.16

11

Solexa fully rebutted both of these arguments in its Reply brief,17 and will not repeat its argu-

12

ments here.

13

In light of AB’s admission, the Court should grant Solexa leave to file a motion seeking

14

reconsideration of its motion for partial summary judgment that the one-base-encoding version of

15

the SOLiD System infringed the ‘341 and ‘597 patents, and on reconsideration should grant

16

Solexa’s motion for partial summary judgment.
C.
The Court should reconsider its holding that Solexa waived any arguments
regarding infringement of the “identifying” term under the Doctrine of
Equivalents

17
18

In its Order, the Court held that Solexa had waived its reliance on the Doctrine of Equiva19
lents as to the “identifying” limitation because “Solexa made no infringement argument under the
20

doctrine of equivalents despite the fact it was raised by AB in its opening brief.”18 Solexa requests

that the Court reconsider this holding because, although AB mentioned the Doctrine of Equiva-

2

lents in two paragraphs in its opening brief,19 other than providing quotes from cases, all AB said

3

was that “Illumina is estopped based on the arguments it made during prosecution” because

4

“Macevicz’s arguments clearly and unambiguously narrowed the scope of the claims.”20 AB did

5

not identify which “arguments” it was relying upon, or offer any explanation whatsoever as to

6

how or why these unidentified “arguments” narrowed the scope of any claim or would preclude

7

application of the Doctrine of Equivalents. There was simply no substance to which Solexa had to

8

respond.

9

As the Supreme Court has held, “[i]t is not enough to move for summary judgment with-

10

out supporting the motion in any way . . . .”21 To the contrary, “[t]he moving party bears the bur-

11

den of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”22 As the Supreme Court held

12

in Celotex,

13

a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions
of “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits, if any,” which it believes demonstrate the absence of a
genuine issue of material fact.23

14
15
16

Solexa was not required to “fill-in-the-blanks” in a speculative attempt to rebut AB’s two
17
vague and wholly conclusory sentences about Macevicz’s “arguments” during prosecution, and
18
consequently should not be held to have waived any argument regarding the Doctrine of Equiva19
lents.
