loans and pool them together into groups to create investment revenue for purchasers of

certificates representing a piece of the mortgage pool the Defendants created. Unfortunately for

the buyers of those certificates, the Defendants represented that the mortgage pools were

statements, and `the `incorrect `information rating agencies `ike Moody' s Rating Service oe

("Moody's") (also in reliance on the defendants misinformation) t to make decisions to purchase o - .

BNY again attempts to avoid silty for failing to amend or correct the Prospectus
Supplement, on which the certificatecholders relied to purchase. the certificates, that its
predecessor, Bank One, had input in preparing and issuing. Bankers alleges `that Bank One

should have amended the Prospectus Supplement to reflect that there were delinquent mortgage

' BNY CAN BE HELD LIABLE AS A SUCCESSOR TO-
BANK ONE FORB BANK ONE'S MISCONDUCT

BNY attempts to avoid liability by claiming that it j is impossible for it to be liable to

. Bankers because. BNY..was not the. trustee at the time. the. acts alleged in the complaint were

committed. This argument is evidently based on the general premise that a corporation that

acquires the assets of another corporation is not liable for the torts of its predecessor. Therefore,

or between Bank One and its successor, .P Morgan Chase & Co., and subsequently yen between J P. BoE

oS `Morgan Chase & Co. and _BNY. Indeed, page 2 of "Exhibit B *spenfaly states that a etetve a : : a :

: : Additionally, page 2 of Exhibit C states that a P. Morgan sold its comporate trust business to he oo -

Bank [of New York for the net asset value . 1? These documents demonstrate that the Bank

One-J. P. Morgan transaction was clearly a merger, and the iz P. -Morgen-BNY transaction was - oo

| continuation of the J. P, Morgen' 0x00A7 business. To the extent that this was not the case, `BNY has
failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that it should not be liable for Bank One's conduct. See
In re: Carver, 144 B.R. at 643. By purchasing the asset in question (that is, the right to act as
trustee for this particular Ic loan mn portfolio), B BNY is responsible for its predecessor trustee's actions

for the s same 1e portfolio.
