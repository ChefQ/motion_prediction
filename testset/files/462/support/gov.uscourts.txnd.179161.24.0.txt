WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.'S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo") files this motion for summary

judgment and in support states as follows:
I. Summary

1. Plaintiffs allege claims against Wells Fargo for false imprisonment, gross
negligence, assault, defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. Wells Fargo seeks summary judgment as to all claims alleged by Plaintiffs. As set
forth more fully in Wells Fargo's Brief in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, none of
these claims are supported by the facts. To the contrary, each claim fails as a matter of law.

Thus, summary judgment is in order.

2. Specifically, Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for
false imprisonment because as a matter of law Plaintiffs are unable to establish that there was a
willful detention by Wells Fargo, that such detention was without consent or that the detention
was without authority of law.

3. Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for negligence
because as a matter of law Plaintiffs cannot establish that Wells Fargo owed a duty to Plaintiffs,
that there was a breach of any duty or that Plaintiffs sustained damages proximately caused by
that breach.

4. Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for gross
negligence because, in addition to being unable to establish the elements of negligence, as a
matter of law Plaintiffs cannot establish that there was an act or omission by Wells Fargo which,
when viewed objectively at the time of the occurrence, involved an extreme degree of risk
considering the probability and magnitude of harm to others, or that Wells Fargo had actual
subjective awareness of the risk involved but nevertheless proceeded with conscious indifference
to the rights, safety or welfare of others.

5. Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for assault
because as a matter of law Plaintiffs cannot establish that Wells Fargo's employees intentionally,
knowingly or recklessly caused bodily injury to Plaintiffs, intentionally or knowingly threatened
Plaintiffs with imminent bodily injury, or intentionally or knowingly caused physical contact
with Plaintiffs or should have reasonably believed that Plaintiffs would regard any contact as
offensive or provocative.

6. Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for defamation

because as a matter of law Plaintiffs cannot establish that Wells Fargo made any false and

"defamatory" statement concerning Plaintiffs, that Wells Fargo published or permitted the
"publication" of any defamatory statement to a third party without a legally recognized privilege
to do so or that Wells Fargo caused special harm to result from publication of any defamatory
statement.

7. Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for invasion of
privacy because as a matter of law Plaintiffs cannot establish that Wells Fargo intentionally
intruded on Plaintiffs' private affairs in a manner that would be offensive to a reasonable person.

8. Lastly, Wells Fargo is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for
intentional infliction of emotional distress because as a matter of law Plaintiffs cannot establish
that Wells Fargo's employees acted intentionally or recklessly, that any alleged conduct by Wells
Fargo's employees was extreme and outrageous, that Wells Fargo's actions caused Plaintiffs
emotional distress or that Plaintiffs' emotional distress, if any, was severe.
