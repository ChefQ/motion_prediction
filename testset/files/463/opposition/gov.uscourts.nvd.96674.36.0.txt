MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2 I.

INTRODUCTION.

3

This is a fraudulent transfer case. Defendants Yoel and Tikva Iny, the Y&T Iny

4 Family Trust, Noam and Rachel Schwartz, and the Noam Schwartz Trust (collectively,
5 “Guarantors”) are the guarantors of two loans from Wells Fargo totaling in excess of $27.8
6 million that have fully matured and not been repaid in full. After guaranteeing these loans,
7 and while indebted to Wells Fargo, Guarantors initiated a web of fraudulent transfers
8 conveying millions of dollars in assets to the other named Defendants in this action.
9 Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act requires that
10 Wells Fargo only have a “claim” against the Guarantors in order to bring this action.
11 Under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, a “claim” is broadly defined as any claimed
12 right to payment whether it be disputed or undisputed, contingent or unliquidated. As the
13 Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals explained, a creditor with a fraudulent transfer claim
14 does not lose its status as a creditor “simply because debtor or a third party has a legal
15 defense to the claim.” DFS Secured Healthcare Receivables Trust v. Caregivers Great
16 Lakes, Inc., 384 F.3d 338, 351 (7th Cir. 2004).
17

More significantly, the legitimacy of Wells Fargo’s claim against the Guarantors is

18 presently the subject of a breach of guaranty action that has been pending in Maricopa
19 County Superior Court since 2012 as Cause No. CV2012-009373.1/

1 subrogation, and expressly rejected precisely the same assertion. In First Credit Union v.
2 Courtney, 309 P.3d 929 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003), the Arizona Court of Appeals found that a
3 lender could pursue a guarantor even when liability against the borrower had been
4 extinguished or was barred because the lender had not pursued the borrower. Here, the
5 guaranty agreements expressly provide that the Guarantors would remain liable even if
6 Wells Fargo elected to release the borrowers or if Wells Fargo refused to pursue its
7 remedies against the borrowers.

Accordingly, Defendants’ legal argument is without

8 merit.

UNDISPUTED FACTS.
A.

11

Guaranty Of El Monte Loan.
1.

On or about February 28, 2008, Wells Fargo made a loan to GAC

12 Storage El Monte, LLC (“GAC”) as borrower in the original principal amount of
13 $12,650,000 (“El Monte Loan”).
14

2.

The El Monte Loan was secured by, among other things, a Deed of

15 Trust (“El Monte Deed of Trust”) recorded against certain real property consisting of a
16 self-storage unit located in El Monte, California (“El Monte Property”). A true and correct
17 copy of the El Monte Deed of Trust is attached to the Motion as Exhibit 5.
18

3.

Guarantors each executed and delivered to Wells Fargo an

19 Unconditional Guaranty dated February 28, 2008, jointly and severally guaranteeing
20 GAC’s payment and performance of the El Monte Loan (“El Monte Guarantees”). True
21 and correct copies of the El Monte Guarantees are attached to the Motion as Exhibit 3.
22

4.

Guarantors and GAC each expressly agreed that the El Monte

23 Guarantees and other El Monte Loan documents would be governed by Arizona law.
24 (Motion, Ex. 3, at § 11(e); Motion, Ex. 5 at § 24)
25

5.

As described in the El Monte Deed of Trust, the parties selected

26 Arizona law because, among other things, the parties “conducted a substantial part of the
27 negotiations for the transaction in the State of Arizona, the Loan has been originated and
28 funded from the State of Arizona.” (Motion, Ex. 5 at § 24)

6.

Importantly, each of the El Monte Guarantees contain extensive

2 waiver provisions that stated, among other things, that the Guarantors waived “any right to
3 which guarantor is or may become entitled to be subrogated to the bank or its affiliated
4 rights against the borrower. . . .” (Motion, Ex. 3 at § 5).
5

7.

Guarantors further agreed that they would remain liable under the El

6 Monte Guarantees even if Wells Fargo were to “settle, release, or compromise with
7 Borrower.” Id. at § 4.
8

B.

9

Guaranty Of Makena Loan.
8.

On or about September 10, 2007, Wells Fargo made a loan to the

10 Makena Great America Anza Company, LLC (“Makena”) as borrower in the original
11 principal amount of $15,150,000 (“Makena Loan”).
12

9.

The Makena Loan was secured by, among other things, a Deed of

13 Trust (“Makena Deed of Trust”) recorded against a certain self-storage facility located in
14 Westminster, California (“Makena Property”). A true and correct copy of the Makena
15 Deed of Trust is attached to the Motion at Exhibit 6.

LEGAL ARGUMENT.

9

A.

10

Legal Standard.

When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at

11 trial, it must come forward with evidence that would entitle it to a directed verdict if the
12 evidence went uncontroverted at trial in order to establish that it is entitled to summary
13 judgment. C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co., Inc. v. Darden Restaurants, Inc., 213 F.3d 474,
14 480 (9th Cir. 2000). In such a case, the moving party has the initial burden of establishing
15 the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue material to its case. Rivera v. Philip
16 Morris, Inc., 395 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir. 2005). An issue of fact is genuine “if the
17 evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”
18 Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1061 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting
19 Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). If the moving party fails to
20 meet its initial burden, summary judgment must be denied and the court need not consider
21 the nonmoving party’s evidence. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 160
22 (1970).
23

In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the trial court must draw

24 all reasonable inferences supported by the evidence in favor of the non-moving party.
25
26

Wells Fargo requests that the Court take judicial notice of these court filings
pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). United States ex rel. Robinson Rancheria Citizens
27 Council v. Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992) (Federal court may “take notice
of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal system, if those
28 proceedings have a direct relation to the matters at issue.”).

1 Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1061. Summary judgment cannot be granted where contrary
2 inferences may be drawn from the evidence as to material issues. Easter v. Am. W. Fin.,
3 381 F.3d 948, 957 (9th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). The court also must view the

Wells Fargo Has A Claim And Is A Creditor Under The Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act.

The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act broadly defines those entitled to bring a

9 fraudulent transfer claim as “creditors,” and “creditors,” in turn, are defined as any
10 individual or entity who holds a “claim” against a debtor. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 4411 1001(4); NRS § 112.150(4).6/ Importantly, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act makes
12 clear that claims broadly include any “right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced
13 to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
14 undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 44-1001(2);
15 NRS § 112.150(3) (emphasis added).
Courts addressing the issue have further made clear that a “claim” exists even

16

17 where the debtor has a potential legal defense and disputes the claim.

Interpreting

18 Indiana’s enactment of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, the Seventh Circuit Court of
19 Appeals held that “a ‘creditor’ with a colorable claim cannot lose its status as ‘creditor’
20 under the IUFTA simply because the debtor or a third party has a legal defense to the
21 claim.” DFS Secured Healthcare Receivable Trust, 384 F.3d at 351. The court explained
22 that the statutory definition of “claim” includes those claims that are “disputed.” Thus, the
23 fact that a debtor disputes the plaintiff’s claim does not change the plaintiff’s status as a
24 creditor under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. Id.
25
26
27

By citing Nevada law, Wells Fargo is not admitting that Nevada law is applicable.
Nonetheless, Nevada and all other jurisdictions with a connection to these claims have
28 enacted the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and the provision are identical.

Here, even if facially valid (which it is not), Defendants’ defense to Wells Fargo’s

2 claims under the Guaranty Agreements does not impact or affect Wells Fargo’s status as a
3 “creditor” and the propriety of this fraudulent transfer action.

Under the Uniform

4 Fraudulent Transfer Act, a claim – even if disputed – entitles a creditor to pursue a
5 fraudulent transfer action.

The Validity Of The Guaranty Agreements Is The Subject Of The
Arizona Litigation.

Wells Fargo’s breach of guaranty action has been pending in Maricopa County,

9 Arizona Superior Court since June 2012. Discovery in that matter closed on January 24,
10 2014. Principals of judicial efficiency weigh against this Court making a ruling as to the
11 enforceability of the Guaranty Agreements, which are governed by Arizona law, given that
12 this precise issue is presently before the Maricopa County, Arizona Superior Court, and
13 has been for more than a year-and-a-half.
14

While Defendants did not formally plead a claim for declaratory relief, Defendants’

15 Motion effectively seeks a declaration from this Court that the Guaranty Agreements are
16 invalid. Defendants’ efforts to “forum-shop” this issue to what Defendants apparently
17 perceive is a more friendly venue results in a waste of judicial resources and impinges
18 upon the same basic principles that would prevent a direct declaratory judgment claim
19 requesting that this Court rule on an issue already pending before a state court. See
20 Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. Am., 316 U.S. 491, 494-495 (1942) (the district court should:
21 1) avoid needless determinations of state law; 2) discourage declaratory actions as a means
22 of forum shopping; and 3) avoid duplicative litigation).

Wells Fargo filed suit in Arizona against the Guarantors in June 2012, prior to the

1 pursue the borrowers, GAC or Makena, because Wells Fargo has foreclosed upon their
2 sole remaining asset, and those entities are effectively defunct. Indeed, subsequent to the
3 bankruptcy court granting Wells Fargo’s motion for stay relief, the court dismissed GAC’s
4 and Makena’s bankruptcy cases based upon unopposed motions by the U.S. Trustee stating
5 that GAC and Makena had “no remaining assets” after the foreclosures. [Exs. 7 and 8]
6

Contrary to Defendants’ erroneous assertions, Arizona law clearly allows a lender

7 to pursue a guarantor even when the lender elects not to pursue the borrower and any
8 subrogation right has been eliminated. The Arizona Court of Appeals in First Credit
9 Union v. Courtney, 309 P.3d 929 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2013), expressly found that a guaranty
10 agreement could provide waivers that allow a lender to pursue a guarantor even after the
11 lender had waived or released its claims against the borrower. In Courtney, the lender
12 foreclosed upon real property owned by the borrower and proceeded to file a lawsuit
13 against the guarantors only. Id. at 931. Ninety (90) days after the foreclosure, A.R.S.
14 § 33-814 precluded the lender from filing suit against the borrower.

The guarantor

15 defendants asserted that extinguishment of the borrowers’ debt rendered the guarantees
16 unenforceable, having destroyed the guarantors’ right to subrogation. Id. at 934. The
17 court rejected the guarantor’s argument and, instead, enforced the express provisions of the
18 guaranty contract which allowed the lender to “resort for payment or to proceed directly or
19 at once against any person, including borrower.” Id. at 935. The guaranty agreement
20 further included a waiver of any defense based upon “any election of remedies by lender
21 which destroys or otherwise adversely affects guarantor’s subrogation rights.” Id.
22

As with the defendants in Courtney, the Guarantors in this case expressly agreed in

23 each of the Guaranty Agreements that Wells Fargo could pursue them “with or without
24 resort for payment to any other party.” [Motion, Exs. 3 and 4, at § 5] Guarantors further
25 waived “any right to which Guarantors are or may become entitled to be subrogated to
26 Bank or its affiliates’ rights against Borrower . . . .” Id. In addition, Guarantors agreed
27 that Wells Fargo could “proceed against, settle, release or compromise with Borrower”
28 without affecting Guarantors’ liability under the Guaranty Agreements. Id., Exs. 3 and 4,
753174.3\0313491

10

Case 2:13-cv-01561-MMD-NJK Document 36 Filed 01/24/14 Page 11 of 15

1 at § 4] Under Arizona law, the terms of the Guaranty Agreements are enforceable and
2 render Defendants’ arguments in this case a nullity.
3

The only Arizona case Defendants cite, D.W. Jaquays & Co. v. First Security Bank,

4 419 P.2d 85 (Ariz. 1966), does not change this result. Even in 1966, Arizona recognized
5 that subrogation rights could be waived in a guaranty agreement. Id., 419 P.2d at 89.
6 Further, even if not waived, a guarantor is only entitled to a reduction in liability equal to
7 “his loss.” Id. Here, even if the Guarantors had not waived their right to subrogation
8 (which they did), their loss would be nothing because the borrowers are without any assets.
9 [See Exs. 7 and 8]
10

E.

11

In a desperate effort to avoid the clear implication of Arizona law, Defendants argue

Arizona Law Governs The Guaranty Agreements.

12 that the Arizona choice of law provisions in the loan documents are void as against Nevada
13 public policy. Under Nevada law, however, “it is well settled that the expressed intention
14 of the parties as to the applicable law in the construction of a contract is controlling if the
15 parties acted in good faith and not to evade the law of the real situs of a contract.” Key
16 Bank of Alaska v. Donnels, 787 P.2d 382 (Nev. 1990) (citing Sievers v. Diversified
17 Mortgage Investors, 603 P.2d 270, 273 (Nev. 1979)). Nevada courts regularly enforce
18 choice of law provisions agreed to by the parties to a contract. “Parties are permitted
19 within broad limits to choose the law that will determine the validity and effect of their
20 contract.” Pentax Corp. v. Boyd, 904 P.2d 1024, 1026 (Nev. 1995) (citations omitted).
21

Defendants have not introduced any evidence, nor did their motion for summary

22 judgment even suggest, that the parties acted in bad faith or attempted to evade the laws of
23 the situs of the contract. Rather, the parties selected Arizona law to govern their loan
24 agreements because, among other things, the parties “conducted a substantial part of the
25 negotiations for the transaction in the State of Arizona, the Loan has been originated and
26 funded from the State of Arizona.” [Motion, Exs. 5 and 6, § 24]
27

Despite the clear choice of law provision, Defendants argue that the application of

28 Arizona law would violate Nevada public policy. Contrary to Defendants’ claims, NRS

1 40.453 is not so broad that it voids any choice of law provision that selects a state’s law,
2 which deviates from Nevada law. Key Bank of Alaska v. Donnels, 787 P.2d 382 (Nev.
3 1990) is instructive, as it concerns a choice of law question in a loan transaction. In Key
4 Bank, the note was governed by Alaska law, while the deed of trust provided for
5 foreclosure under Nevada law. The Nevada Supreme Court upheld the Alaska choice of
6 law provision even though it differed from Nevada’s anti-deficiency statute.

Moreover, Nevada courts have recognized that NRS 40.453 should not be read so

8 broadly to prohibit choice of law provisions:

the language of NRS 40.453 is ambiguous to the extent that a strict
application of the extremely broad language of NRS 40.453 would lead to an
absurd result. In particular, if the legislature actually intended to prohibit the
waiver of any right secured by law, then such things as arbitration
agreements, forum selection clauses and choice-of-law provisions would be
unenforceable. The Nevada Legislature could not have intended such a
result when it enacted NRS 40.453.

13 Lowe Enters. Residential Ptnrs., L.P. v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 40 P.3d 405, 412
14 (Nev. 2002) (emphasis added). Even this court has found that “it cannot be a proper
15 reading of § 40.453 that a choice-of-law provision that selects for a state whose deficiency
16 judgment law are identical to Nevada’s in all but one slightly weaker respect would be
17 invalidated.” Behringer Harvard Lake Tahoe, LLC v. Bank of America, N.A., case no.

Furthermore, Defendants’ argument that a guarantor cannot prospectively waive

20 subrogation rights is fatally flawed and lacks any legal support. First, Defendants rely
21 solely on NRS 40.495 to support this argument. Yet, Defendants only cite to a portion of
22 NRS 40.495 to claim (Motion at 13) that the statute “expressly provides that the guarantor
23 may waive his right of subrogation ‘only after default’.” Defendants ask this Court to
24 completely ignore the following section that states that a “guarantor, surety or obligor,
25 other than the mortgagor or grantor of a deed of trust, may waive the provisions of NRS
26 40.430.” Indeed, NRS 40.495 states, in pertinent part:
27

1.
The provisions of NRS 40.475 and 40.485 may be waived by the
guarantor, surety or other obligor only after default.

2.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, a guarantor, surety or
other obligor, other than the mortgagor or grantor of a deed of trust, may
waive the provisions of NRS 40.430. If a guarantor, surety or other obligor
waives the provisions of NRS 40.430, an action for the enforcement of that
person’s obligation to pay, satisfy or purchase all or part of an indebtedness
or obligation secured by a mortgage or lien upon real property may be
maintained separately and independently from:
(a)
An action on the debt;
(b)
The exercise of any power of sale;
(c)
Any action to foreclose or otherwise enforce a mortgage or lien
and the indebtedness or obligations secured thereby; and
(d)
Any other proceeding against a mortgagor or grantor of a deed
of trust.

As previously discussed, the Guarantors each expressly waived any right they may

10

11 have to require Wells Fargo to proceed first against the borrowers. NRS 40.430 is the
12 Nevada statutory one-action rule that would have required a lender to first proceed against
13 the borrower. Given that Nevada law allows a guarantor to waive that right, such a waiver
14 in the Guaranty Agreements (under Arizona law) that allowed Wells Fargo to proceed
15 against Guarantors without pursuing the bankrupt borrowers is clearly not against public
16 policy.
Defendants have no authority for their argument. Defendants cite to only one

17

18 Nevada case in support of their assertion, First Interstate Bank of Nevada v. Shields, 102
19 Nev. 616, 730 P.2d 429 (1986). Yet, Shields has no relevance to their argument regarding
20 subrogation. Rather, Shields finds that guarantors of a promissory note secured by a deed
21 of trust on real property are entitled to the protections of the deficiency judgment statutes.
22 Id.
23

Defendants’ citation to the California case Union Bank v. Gradzky also has no

24 application whatsoever. The court in Gradzky expressly stated that a guarantor could
25 prospectively waive its rights of subrogation and allow the creditor to pursue the guarantor
26 even where recovery against the borrower is barred. 265 Cal. App. 2d 40, 48 (1968).
27 Indeed, California has enacted a specific statutory provision that allows guarantors to
28 prospectively waive their rights under Gradzky and any right to subrogation the guarantors

1 might acquire. See Cal. Civil Code § 2856. Thus, under California law, a waiver of the
2 right to subrogation certainly is not against public policy.
3

The sole Nevada statute that mentions the right to subrogation, NRS 40.475,

4 similarly recognizes that a lender may waive, release, or otherwise have limited its rights
5 against the borrower.

NRS 40.475 simply provides that, upon full payment (the

6 Guarantors have not paid any portion of the debt in this matter), a guarantor succeeds to
7 whatever right the lender “then has” under the loan documents. Importantly, by expressly
8 providing that the rights were limited only to those that the lender “then has,” the Nevada
9 legislature acknowledged that a lender may have waived, released, or otherwise
10 extinguished certain rights that may have existed previously.
11 IV.

CONCLUSION.

12

Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Wells Fargo respectfully requests that the Court

13 deny Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.
