STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES

24

This Motion raises two straightforward legal issues:

25

1. Is the alleged debt of the Guarantor-Defendants enforceable under applicable law?

26

2. In the absence of any enforceable debt, can Plaintiff maintain its action for allegedly

27
28

fraudulent transfers?
The answer to both of the above questions, as demonstrated below and as a matter of law,
1549642 (8237-23)

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff alleges in this diversity action that it made two separate loans secured by

4

California real property (the "Loans"), each of which was guarantied by Defendants YOEL INY

5

6 and TIKVA NY, husband and wife; YOEL NY, as trustee of the Y&T INY FAMILY TRUST
AGREEMENT, dated June 8,1994; NOAM SCHWARTZ and RACHEL ELMALAM, husband

7

8 and wife; and NOAM SCHWARTZ, as trustee of the NOAM SCHWARTZ TRUST, dated
9 August 19, 1999 (collectively, the "Guarantor-Defendants"). As alleged by Plaintiff, these loans
are:

10

1.

11

Plaintiff to have been secured by real property in Los Angeles County,

12
H -

California (the "GAC Property"); and

-

-

I’

I-

A loan to GAC Storage El Monte (the "GAC Loan"), elsewhere alleged by

2.

14
OC

E

A loan to The Makena Great American Anza Company, LLC (the "Makena
Loan"), secured by real property in Orange County, California (the "Makena

15

Property")

-’

Plaintiff further alleges that each of the Guarantor-Defendants executed an

17
18

"Unconditional Guaranty" relating to each of the Loans (collectively, the "Guaranties").

19

Plaintiff further alleges that each of the borrowers under the Loans defaulted on their obligations

20

I

in connection therewith.

21

Because of those alleged defaults, on or about June 19, 2012, Plaintiff commenced an

22

action against the Guarantor-Defendants the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona,

23

I

seeking to enforce the Guaranties (the "Arizona Action"), which remains pending.

24

While the Arizona Action was pending, and following a dismissal of the two bankruptcy

25

cases of both GAC and Makena, Plaintiff ultimately completed non-judicial foreclosure sales of

26

the real property securing the Loans (collectively, the "Properties") under California law. On

27

May 9, 2013, the GAC Property was sold by non-judicial foreclosure to Pacifica El Monte LLC

28

for a successful bid of $10,001,000.00, and on May 9, 2013, the Makena Property was sold by
1549642 (8237-23)

Page 3 of 18

Case 2:13-cv-01561-MMD-NJK Document 24 Filed 12/24/13 Page 4 of 18

1 non-judicial foreclosure to 123 Westminster Storage, LLC for the successful bid of
2 $11,550,000.00. No action was ever commenced against either the two borrowers to enforce any
3 deficiency claim. True and correct copies of the Trustee’s Deeds Upon Sale Sales recorded in

4

connection with the Properties are attached hereto as

Exhibits "1" and "2", respectively.’

On August 28, 2013, Plaintiff commenced the instant action, seeking a judicial

5

6 determination that certain transfers alleged to have been made/received by the Defendants were

7

fraudulent in light of the Guarantor-Defendants’ alleged debt to Plaintiff.
This is actually the sixth separate legal proceeding on the two alleged debts, apart from

8

9 the two non-judicial foreclosures, including an identical action to this one, filed in the Superior
10 Court of Los Angeles, County, California, on April 19, 2013.
An essential element of a cause of action for fraudulent transfer is the existence of a valid
debt held by a creditor. In this case, however, as will be further discussed below, any liability
13

that the Guarantor-Defendants might once have had to Plaintiff has been extinguished as a matter

14

of law. As there is no debt, there is obviously no basis for an enforceable claim for fraudulent

15

transfer. Thus, even if the Court accepts all of Plaintiff’s factual allegations as true, a complete

16

defense is manifest as to each of Plaintiffs claims, and the Defendants are entitled to summary

17

judgment with respect to each and every claim in the Complaint.

1. Standard for Summary Judgment

21

Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:

22

(a)... The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows
that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law...

The Defendants respectfully request that the Court take judicial notice of these public records pursuant to Fed. R.
Evid. 201(b). See, e.g., Outten v. Bank of New York Mellon, 2013 WL 6086899, *1 (CD. Cal. 2013) ("Trustee’s
deed upon sale and other recorded documents were "public records, the authenticity of which is capable of accurate
and ready determination by sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.").

The United States Supreme Court has made clear that "Rule

1
2

a ’disfavored procedural shortcut’ but instead ’as an integral part of the ... Rules as a whole,

3

which are designed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action."

4

Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986).
Indeed, in Celotex, the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant moving for

5
6

summary judgment need only demonstrate, by "showing," that there is an absence of evidence to

7

support any one of the prima facie elements of the non-moving party’s case.

8

Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). As explained in Celotex:

N

12
z 10

F

Celotex Corp. v.

[T]he plain language of Rule 5 6(c) mandates the entry of summary
judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion,
against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish
the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on
which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a
situation, there can be "no genuine issue as to any material fact,"
since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element
of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts
immaterial. The moving party is "entitled to a judgment as a matter
of law" because the nonmoving party has failed to make a
sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect
to which she has the burden of proof.

In this case, with respect to the discrete issues discussed below, there is no genuine

17
18

dispute as to any material fact that would prevent this Court’s summary adjudication, as Plaintiff

19

is precluded from any further enforcement of the Guaranties against the Guarantor-Defendants

20

with respect to the GAC and Makena Loans. That conclusion likewise provides a complete

21

defense to each of the fraudulent transfer claims.
2. Standard for Determining Choice of Law.

22
23

Since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), it has been the rule that, in cases

24

brought in United States District Court based upon its diversity jurisdiction, "the law to be

25

applied in any case is the law of the state" in which the action is brought.

This Court must therefore turn to the laws of Nevada to determine the correct law to

26

apply in this case.

In Sievers v. Diversified Mtg. Investors, 95 Nev. 811, 603 P.2d 270 (1979), the Nevada

1
2

Supreme Court expressed Nevada’s general choice of law rule as follows:
It is well settled that the expressed intention of the parties as to the
applicable law in the construction of a contract is controlling if the
parties acted in good faith and not to evade the law of the real situs
of the contract. Under choice-of-law principles, parties are
permitted within broad limits to choose the law that will determine
the validity and effect of their contract.

Sievers, 95 Nev. 815, 603. P.2d at 273 (internal citations omitted).
Sievers, however, went on to articulate two important exceptions to the general rule that

8
9

the choice of law identified by the agreement governs the parties’ relationship:
[1] The situs fixed by the agreement, however, must have a
substantial relation with the transaction, and [2] the agreement
must not be contrary to the public policy of the forum.

12

Thus, a court sitting in Nevada is only required to apply the law of the state specified in

13

the agreement if: (1) that state as a substantial relation with the transaction; and (2) it would not

14

offend Nevada’s public policy to do so.

15

In this case, section 11(c) of each of the Guaranties executed by the Guarantor-

16

Defendants, provides that "this Guaranty shall be governed by and construed under the laws of

17

the State of Arizona without regard to conflict of laws principles." Copies of the Guaranties for

each of the GAC and the Makena Loans are attached hereto as composite Exhibits "3" and

respectively.

B. The Alleged Debt of the Guarantor-Defendants Is Legally Unenforceable.

Plaintiff completed its non-judicial foreclosure of both the GAC and Makena Properties

8

on May 9, 2013, in California. As discussed below, by electing to foreclosure non-judicially and

9

failing to preserve any deficiency rights against the borrowers, Plaintiff has destroyed the

10

Guarantor-Defendants’ rights of subrogation against GAC and Makena. Those rights were

11

inadequately waived in the Guaranties, and even if they

12

would be unenforceable as violative of Nevada’s public policy. Having destroyed the Guarantor-

13

Defendants’ rights of subrogation, the Guarantor-Defendants are exonerated from any further

other recorded documents were the appropriate subjects of judicial notice).
For purposes of this Motion only, and except as expressly stated herein, the Defendants concede that the law of the
State of Arizona applies to the guarantees. Accordingly, this Motion presents no factual issues as to the appropriate
choice of law. In the event that this case proceeds to trial, however, the Defendants expressly reserve all factual
issues bearing upon the appropriate choice of law.

the ability to seek a deficiency judgment against GAC and Makena for any balance that would

otherwise have remained owing on the Loans as a matter of California law.

Moreover, the State of California’s absolute bar to seeking a deficiency judgment against

the borrower following a non-judicial foreclosure would apply in this case notwithstanding any

other references to Arizona law.
In SBKC Service Corp. v. 1111 Prospect Partners, L.P.,

969 F. Supp. 1254, 1263 (D.

12

Kan. 1997), the court was faced with a deficiency action following the non-judicial foreclosure

13

of a California property. The court concluded that where the deed of trust provided for a

14

bifurcated choice of law similar to the one in this case, with California law to govern the

15

foreclosure aspects, California law would also be applied to prohibit seeking a deficiency against

16

the borrower. The court explained:

Plaintiff’s non-judicial foreclosure of the Properties has therefore resulted in its loss of

-

rID

The court concludes that California law applies. Cal. Civ. Pro. Code
§ 580d is entitled "Foreclosure under power of sale; no deficiency
judgment; exceptions." Based on the clear reference to foreclosure

17
18
19
20

Cal. Civ. Pro. Code § 580d was amended by the California Legislature on July 11, 2013, pursuant to 2013 Cal.
Legis. Serv. Ch. 65 (S.B. 426). This amendment, inter alia, added the following provision:

21

(b) The fact that no deficiency shall be owed or collected under the
circumstances set forth in subdivision (a) does not affect the liability that a
guarantor, pledgor or other surety might otherwise have with respect to the
deficiency, or that might otherwise be satisfied in whole or in part from other
collateral pledged to secure the obligation that is the subject of the deficiency.

22
23
24

25
26
27
28

Notwithstanding the addition of subsection (b), however, Section 1 the bill provides that "[t]he Legislature finds
and declares that this measure is not intended to and does not impact existing law regarding the liability a guarantor,
pledgor or other surety may have with respect to a deficiency, nor does it impact existing law regarding other
collateral pledged to secure an obligation that is the subject of a deficiency."
Accordingly, it was the clearly-expressed intent of the California Legislature to preserve the well-established
existing law articulated in Union Bank v. Gradsky, 71 Cal. Rptr. 64 (Ct. App. 1968) and its progeny, as discussed
above.
More importantly, however, the non-judicial foreclosures of the Properties occurred prior to the passage of the
amendment, and would therefore be unaffected by the amendment.
1549642 (8237-23)

Page 8 of 18

Case 2:13-cv-01561-MMD-NJK Document 24 Filed 12/24/13 Page 9 of 18

in the statute’s title, it is apparent that § 580d is part of California’s
real estate foreclosure law by which the parties agreed to be bound,
and the plaintiff offers no persuasive argument to the contrary.
Furthermore, the existence of a purported waiver of California’s
antideficiency laws contained in the agreement to extend the Note
is an indication that the parties believed that § 580d was applicable
under the choice of law clauses contained in the Note and Deed of
Trust. Thus, the court concludes that ¶ 11.12 of the Deed of Trust
requires the application of § 580d as part of California’s real estate
foreclosure law and, if there were nothing further, the plaintiff
would be precluded from recovering a deficiency in this matter.

Accordingly, under California law, Plaintiff is barred from seeking a deficiency against

barred from seeking a deficiency against either of the borrowers as well.

Even if Arizona law were to apply to a deficiency action brought by Plaintiff, Plaintiff is

Under A.R.S. § 33-814(A), "within ninety days after the date of sale of trust property

13

under a trust deed pursuant to § 33-807, an action may be maintained to recover a deficiency

14

judgment against any person directly, indirectly or contingently liable on the contract for which

15

the trust deed was given as security including any guarantor of or surety for the contract and any

16

partner of a trustor or other obligor which is a partnership."

Con

t

17

Subsection (D) of that statute provides that "[i]f no action is maintained for a deficiency

18

I judgment within the time period prescribed in subsections A and B of this section, the proceeds

19

of the sale, regardless of amount, shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of the obligation and

20

no right to recover a deficiency in any action shall exist."

21

In this case, the deadline for Plaintiff to have commenced a deficiency action against

22

either GAC or Makena would have been August 7, 2013. Having failed to do so, Plaintiff is

23

irrevocably barred from seeking a deficiency judgment against the borrowers under Arizona law.
c. Nevada Law

24
25

Nevada law similarly provides that "upon application of the judgment creditor or the

26

beneficiary of the deed of trust within 6 months after the date of the foreclosure sale or the

27

trustee’s sale held pursuant to NRS 107.080, respectively, and after the required hearing, the

1

court shall award a deficiency judgment to the judgment creditor or the beneficiary of the deed of

2

trust..." N.R.S. § 40.455(1).
Thus, the deadline for Plaintiff to have commenced a deficiency action against either of

3
4

the borrowers under Nevada law would have been November 9, 2013. Having failed to do so,

5

Plaintiff is irrevocably barred from seeking a deficiency judgment against the borrowers under

6

Nevada law.

7

Accordingly, whether California, Arizona or Nevada law applies, Plaintiff is absolutely

8

barred from seeking a deficiency judgment against either GAC or Makena - whether because its

9

nonjudicial foreclosure itself destroyed the right to pursue such a deficiency, or due to the

10

expiration of the relevant deadline by which such an action must have been brought.

14

the Guarantor-Defendants, who would have succeeded to Plaintiffs rights against GAC and

17

required to satisfy that judgment, they will have no recourse against the borrowers.

18

As discussed below, it is well-settled law that a lender may not simultaneously destroy a

19

guarantor’s rights of subrogation and still seek to recover from that guarantor. Destruction of the

20

Guarantor-Defendants’ rights of subrogation therefore exonerates the Guaranties as a matter of

21

law.

22
23
24

It has long been held that a secured lender may not destroy a guarantor’s rights of
subrogation. See, e.g., Union Bank v. Gradsky, 71

Cal. Rptr. 64 (Ct. App. 1968).

In Gradsky, the court held that, because there is no right to a deficiency against the

25

borrower under California law, the guarantors’ rights of subrogation had been destroyed where a

26

lender proceeded with a non-judicial foreclosure, as that action left the potentially-subrogated

27

guarantor without recourse against the borrower. Accordingly,

28

dismissal of the action against the guarantor.

Gradsky affirmed the trial court’s

Similarly, in D. W Jaquays & Co. v. First Sec. Bank, 419 P.2d 85, 88 (Ariz. 1966). The

2

Arizona Supreme Court held that where a guarantor’s right of subrogation was destroyed, the

3

guarantor would be "released from that liability to the extent of the injury caused by the

4

[destruction of the right of subrogation]."
Although the Nevada Supreme Court has not directly addressed a situation in which the

5

lender has destroyed a guarantor’s right of subrogation, its decision in First Interstate Bank of

Nevada v. Shields, 102 Nev. 616, 730 P.2d 429 (1986) implicitly recognizes that a guarantor’s

8

right of subrogation is a key ingredient of the package of rights and protections to which a

9

guarantor is entitled. Thus, in Shields, the court explained:
[I]f a guarantor were obligated to pay the judgment for the
deficiency, the debtor arguably could be obligated to reimburse the
guarantor for amounts paid on the debtor’s behalf. Thus, unless the
guarantor were entitled to the protection of the deficiency
judgment laws, the debtor might be indirectly subject to the
payment of the deficiency that the statutes were designed to
prevent...

Although the maker of the note would likely assert the deficiency
statute as a defense against the guarantor, if successful the result
would be to subject the guarantor to a defense which he never
contemplated, and which does not result from his own actions, but
from the creditor’s neglect [or imposition].

Shields, 102 Nev. at 620, 730 P.2d at 432 (internal citations omitted; emphasis added).
Although the ultimate holding in Shields was to extend the protections of Nevada’s

19

statutory limitations on deficiency judgments to guarantors, implicit in its holding was that the

20

guarantors’ rights of subrogation must be preserved. Thus, it is similarly clear under Nevada law

21

that destroying a guarantor’s rights of subrogation is an unacceptable result, and one from which

22

a guarantor is to be protected.

23

Nothing less is required on the facts of this case. There is no dispute that Plaintiff non-

24

judicially foreclosed upon the Properties. Further, there can be no genuine dispute that Plaintiff

25

has not commenced and is now barred from filing a deficiency action against either GAC or

26

Makena. There can be no dispute that, were the Guarantor-Defendants to be subrogated to

27

Plaintiffs position, they too would be barred from seeking any recovery from GAC or Makena.

28

This destruction of the Guarantor-Defendants’ rights of subrogation exonerates them from any

a. Nevada’s public policy prohibits a pre-default waiver of the right of

Irrespective of the choice of law ultimately adopted by the Court, matters of public policy

are an exception to the general rule that choice-of-law provisions in contracts are enforceable.

Thus, the Nevada Supreme Court has stated:

will determine the validity and effect of their contract." Sievers v.
Diversified Mtg. Investors, 95 Nev. 811, 815, 603 P.2d 270, 273
(1979). Sievers imposed two requirements for the validity of a
choice of law provision: "The situs fixed by the agreement ... must
have a substantial relation with the transaction, and the agreement
must not be contrary to the public policy of the forum." Id.

It is thus black letter law that a court sitting in the State of Nevada is only required to

20
21

Nevada’s public policy to do so.
In this case, N.R.S. § 40.453 provides as follows:

22

Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.495:

23

1. It is hereby declared by the Legislature to be against public
policy for any document relating to the sale of real property to
contain any provision whereby a mortgagor or the grantor of a
deed of trust or a guarantor or surely of the indebtedness secured
thereby, waives any right secured to the person by the laws of this
state.

24
25
26

2. A court shall not enforce any such provision.

Case 2:13-cv-01561-MMD-NJK Document 24 Filed 12/24/13 Page 13 of 18

N.R.S. § 40.495 then expressly provides that a guarantor may waive its right of

1

eI

2

subrogation "only after default"; i.e., not in the underlying guaranty itself. Importantly, the

3

language of N.R.S. § 40.453 that includes a guarantor or a surety within its protections was

4

added by SB 359 in the 1987 amendments to the Nevada Revised Statutes - simultaneously with

5

the subrogation provisions set forth in N.R.S. §§ 40.465 through 40.495(1) themselves. The

6

legislative history surrounding these amendments makes clear that the Nevada Legislature was

7

concerned with a lender’s ability to strip away the protections and rights available to guarantors

8

by requiring waivers of all such rights in the loan documents as a condition to making the loan.

9

Accordingly, and to address these concerns, the guarantor subrogation statutes were enacted, and

10

accompanied by an extension of the Nevada’s anti-waiver statute to guarantors - all as a matter

11

th
of public policy. See Nev. Sen. 359, Leg. Hist., 46 Sess. (1987).

12

Since, Nevada law provides that, as a matter of public policy, the pre-default waiver of a

13

guarantor’s right of subrogation is unenforceable, a contrary rule from another jurisdiction is not

14

enforceable, and it is Nevada law that governs attempts to enforce such a waiver. In short,

15

Plaintiff’s failure to pursue an action for a deficiency against GAC and Makena exonerates the

16

Guaranties.

b. Even if a clear waiver of the Guarantor-Defendants’ rights of
subrogation would otherwise be enforceable, the waivers contained
within the Guaranties are inadequate.

17
18

The most explicit waiver contained within the Guaranties is set forth in Section

19
20

I

5(i), and

provides as follows:
Guarantor waives and releases the following rights, demands, and
defenses Guarantor may have with respect to Bank. . . and collection
of the Guaranteed Obligations: (i) Any right to which Guarantor is
or may become entitled to be subrogated to Bank or its affiliates’
rights against Borrower or to seek contribution, reimbursement,
indemnification, payment of the like, or participation in any claim,
right or remedy of Bank or its affiliates against Borrower or any
security which Bank or its affiliates now has or hereafter acquires,
until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully
satisfied beyond the expiration of any applicable preference period.

21
22
23
24
25
26

However, as the court held in Union Bank v. Gradsky, 71 Cal. Rptr. 64, 70 (Ct. App.

27
28 11968):

1549642 (8237-23)

Page 13 of 18

Case 2:13-cv-01561-MMD-NJK Document 24 Filed 12/24/13 Page 14 of 18

The language of the guarantee agreement does not specifically
waive the guarantor’s defense based upon an election of remedies
which destroys both the guarantor’s subrogation rights and his right
to proceed against the principal obligor for reimbursement. In
absence of an explicit waiver, we shall not strain the instrument to
find that waiver by implication.

1

The extent to which the waiver discussed in Gradsky must be explicitly disclosed was

6

further developed in Resolution Trust Corp. v. Titan Financial Corp., 22 F.3d 923, 924-25 (9th

7

Cir. Nev. 1994), in which the court explained as follows:
In Cathay Bank, the court held that even though the "Gradsky
defense" may be waived by a guarantor, ...the waiver must be
explicit.

8
9

Cathay Bank is controlling authority that the waiver language of
the guaranty signed by Sellan was not sufficiently explicit to waive
his Gradsky defense. Cathay Bank establishes that the waiver
language must do more than tell the guarantor that he may lose
subrogation rights; it must explain "that if the lender selects
nonjudicial foreclosure, he or she will have a defense to a
deficiency judgment [the Gradsky defense], and it is that defense
which the guarantor is now being asked to give up in advance."
In other words, the waiver language must tell the guarantor that he
has a Gradsky defense.

In Titan Financial Corp, the Ninth Circuit ultimately concluded that the waiver in that

17

case - which was virtually identical to the above waiver in the Guaranties - was not sufficiently

18

explicit to validly waive the guarantor’s Gradsky defense. Id. at 925.

Arizona similarly requires that waivers of rights of subrogation be clear and

Moreover, the waivers in the Guaranties are actually not really waivers at all, inasmuch

26

as Section 5(i) of the Guaranties actually preserves at least a "springing" right of subrogation

27

once "the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully satisfied beyond the expiration of any

28

applicable preference period." This express language makes clear that, to the contrary:

Case 2:13-cv-01561-MMD-NJK Document 24 Filed 12/24/13 Page 15 of 18

1

Guarantor-Defendants will have rights of subrogation upon their payment of the Guaranteed

2

Obligations - which is of course the very nature of a right of subrogation.

3

As A.R.S. § 12-1643 provides, in pertinent part:
When a person who is surety on an undertaking is compelled to
pay a judgment or part thereof, or makes a payment upon a
judgment by reason of suretyship, such judgment shall not be
discharged by such payment but shall remain in force for the use of
the surety and shall be considered as assigned to the surety
together with all rights of the creditor thereunder to the extent of
the payment made by the surety, and interest thereon.

t

A.R.S. § 12-1643(A).
A right of subrogation thus does not mature until "a payment upon a judgment by reason

10

of suretyship." A fair reading of Section 5(i) of the Guaranties might support the conclusion that,

11

whereas A.R.S. § 12-1643(A) permits a right of subrogation to mature upon even a partial

12

payment of a judgment, the Guaranties require that the "Guaranteed Obligations have been fully

13

satisfied beyond the expiration of any applicable preference period" before the rights of

14

subrogation are matured.

15

Thus, rather than absolutely waiving their rights of subrogation, Section 5(i) in fact

16

preserves the rights of subrogation, although it makes clear that such rights are triggered only

17

upon the full satisfaction and discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations.

18
19

Accordingly, the Guarantor-Defendants submit that the purported waivers of their rights
of subrogation contained within the Guaranties are insufficient and invalid as a matter of law.

20

Their rights of subrogation having thus initially been preserved, notwithstanding any

21

language in the Guaranties to the contrary, they were then destroyed by Plaintiff’s election to

22

non-judicially foreclose on the Properties. The situation with which the Guarantor-Defendants

23

are faced is thus identical to the circumstances present in

24

foreclosure itself destroyed the ability to seek a deficiency against the borrower, thus

25

emasculating the guarantor’s right of subrogation. In this case, Plaintiff has taken action that has

26

similarly barred it from seeking a deficiency against the borrower. The Guarantor-Defendants

27

will have no recourse against the borrower by virtue of their rights of subrogation, as Plaintiff’s

28

actions have destroyed those rights. Accordingly, the Guaranties are exonerated.

C. Since the Guaranties Have Been Exonerated, There is No Debt, and There is No
Basis for a Claim for Fraudulent Transfer.

1
2

As the GuarantorDefendants are not liable to Plaintiff under the Guaranties, there is no

3

"debt" that would form the basis for a claim of fraudulent transfer.

4

Both sections 112.180 and 112.190 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provide begin with

5

the words: "A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor..."

6

Pursuant to N.R.S. § 112.150(6), "Debtor" means "a person who is liable on a claim."

7

(Emphasis added.)

8

Pursuant to N.R.S. §

9

112.150(4), "Creditor" means "a person who

has a claim."

(Emphasis added.)

10

Finally, pursuant to N.R.S. § 112.150(3), "Claim" means "a right to payment, whether or
not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,

j12
JO
n

fixed, contingent, matured,

unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured." (Emphasis added.)

13

As demonstrated above, the Guarantor-Defendants are not "Debtors" under Chapter 112,

14
15

as they are not liable to Plaintiff. Nor is Plaintiff a "Creditor" under Chapter 112, as it has no

16

"Claim" against the Guarantor-Defendants.

Accordingly, the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment against Plaintiff on

CONCLUSION
For the aforementioned reasons, the Defendants respectfully request that this Court enter an

23

every claim asserted in the Complaint; (2) granting Defendants their attorneys’ fees and costs for

alternative, that their claim for attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with the above causes of

action is expressly reserved pending further order of this Court; and (3) for such other relief as the
