UNITED STATES’ MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
BY PLAINTIFF SCOTT E. YOUMAN, SR.
Defendant United States of America moves for an order compelling
Plaintiff Scott E. Youman, Sr. to produce, within ten (10) days, those documents
and materials requested on September 6, 2006 (Exhibit A).
Defendant requested nineteen categories of documents and materials.
Although Plaintiff produced certain medical records which are ostensibly
responsive to Requests 1 – 4, no response or objection to the request was ever
filed, nor were any documents or materials responsive to Requests 5 – 19 ever
produced.
This is a medical malpractice wrongful death action. Among the materials

disability records, which are obviously central to the damages claim, and which
are necessary in order to depose the Plaintiff Scott Youman, who is the
