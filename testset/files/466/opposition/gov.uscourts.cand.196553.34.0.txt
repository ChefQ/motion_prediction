Allan Candelore respectfully submits this Memorandum of Points and Authorities in

2 Opposition to the Motion of Shahpour Javidzad for Relief from the Court’s Scheduling Order.
3

By the Order dated November 14, 2007 (the “November 14 Order”), this Court set forth the

4 necessary steps to follow for those investors wishing to be lead plaintiffs in this action. Among
5 other things, the November 14 Order directed that movants seeking appointment as lead plaintiffs
6 complete and attach the questionnaire that was appended to the November 14 Order (the
7 “Questionnaire”) by November 21, 2007, and that any oppositions to those motions should be filed
8 by November 27, 2007.
9

Mr. Javidzad did not comply with the November 14 Order and, instead, filed a motion

10 seeking relief from it. Specifically, Mr. Javidzad contends that the Court should extend the deadline
11 for filing motions for lead plaintiff because the notice requirement of the Private Securities
12 Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”) provides that investors have “not later than 60 days”
13 from the date of the first-filed notice to seek appointment as lead plaintiff. Since the notice was
14 issued on October 9, 2007, Mr. Javidzad claims that the deadline should be “not later than,” – or, in
15 his view, end no earlier than – December 10, 2007.
16

Regardless of whether or not the actual “motions” for lead plaintiff may be filed by

17 December 10, 2007, this Court set a specific deadline of November 21, 2007 for filing answers to the
18 Questionnaire. Mr. Javidzad did not complete the Questionnaire by that deadline, despite admittedly
19 knowing about it prior to then. While Mr. Javidzad then claimed that he could not respond to the
20 Court’s request in a “single day,” it is now a full week later and he has still not completed the
21 Questionnaire or otherwise provided any evidentiary support for the claims he made in his motion to
22 support his candidacy for lead plaintiff. Indeed, based on the present record, there is no evidence that
23 Mr. Javidzad is even a member of the class in this case.

Thus, for these reasons, the Court should deny Mr. Javidzad’s motion for relief from the

2 scheduling order for failing to comply with the Court’s November 14 Order, including failing to file
3 answers to the Questionnaire by November 21, 2007.
