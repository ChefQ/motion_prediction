Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 4 of 16 PageID #: 3446

AT&T Mobility respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to
amend their antitrust complaint because the proposed amendment would be futile. 1 The
proffered Second Amended Complaint, like the previous amended complaint, would fail to state
a claim on which relief may be granted because it fails to allege facts sufficient to support the
claim that Defendants entered into an unlawful conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws.
Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint introduces no new facts indicative of a conspiracy;
indeed, in their memorandum, Plaintiffs do not cite to a single specific allegation that they have
added to the Second Amended Complaint, nor do they attempt to explain why any such
allegations differ from what Plaintiffs previously alleged and argued. Their motion simply reargues points already, and properly, rejected by the Court.
INTRODUCTION
The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their complaint because the
allegations they seek to add fail to remedy the deficiencies that led this Court to dismiss their
First Amended Complaint. In its August 31, 2012 Memorandum Opinion (“Op.”), the Court
correctly held that the first amended complaint failed to state any claim based on Defendants’
alleged participation in the 3GPP standard-setting process because Plaintiffs failed to allege that
Defendants conspired “to employ . . . any improper practices within the standard setting process”
that would “subvert[]” that process or turn it “into a sham.” Op. 21. The Second Amended
Complaint supplies no such allegations – to the contrary, Plaintiffs concede that the 3GPP
process was followed “to the letter,” Mot. 8, and the added allegations in the Second Amended
Complaint confirm that fact. As this Court has recognized, disputes about the technical merits of

1

The proposed Second Amended Complaint continues to name AT&T Inc. as a defendant but
contains no new allegations concerning conduct by AT&T Inc. AT&T Inc.’s pending motion to
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is not affected by the proposed amendment.

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 5 of 16 PageID #: 3447

standards adopted through a valid standard-setting process cannot be the basis for a conspiracy
claim. Plaintiffs have alleged nothing more.
BACKGROUND
1.

The First Amended Complaint sought to allege claims under Sections 1 and 2 of

the Sherman Act based on four types of actual or anticipated conduct: alleged manipulation of
3GPP standard-setting; alleged delay in the development of Band 12 standards and devices;
alleged potential agreements between AT&T Mobility and device manufacturers to restrict the
supply of devices to Plaintiffs; and the alleged possibility that AT&T Mobility might refuse to
allow Plaintiffs’ customers to “roam” onto AT&T Mobility’s network. Based on these
allegations, Plaintiffs set out five antitrust claims under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and
a single claim under the Communications Act of 1934.
2.

On August 31, 2012, after extensive briefing and a full day of oral argument, the

Court dismissed the amended complaint.
a.

With respect to the claim that Defendants had conspired unlawfully to

manipulate the 3GPP process, the Court noted that Plaintiffs had provided “no factual allegations
to plausibly show the existence of an agreement.” Op. 18. Plaintiffs offered no direct
allegations concerning the time, place, or participants in any agreement, “or even what such an
alleged agreement entailed.” Id. The fact that all of the Defendants participated in the 3GPP
process relating to the creation of Band 17 did not support Plaintiffs’ claim, because Defendants’
joint participation in standard-setting does not provide a basis for an antitrust claim in the
absence of allegations that Defendants “bias[ed] the standard setting process . . . through the use
of improper and unfair practices and procedures.” Op. 21. “While Plaintiffs argue that
Defendants’ technical justifications set forth during the 3GPP process are merely pretext for

2

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 6 of 16 PageID #: 3448

anticompetitive behavior, the 3GPP process was followed to the letter. That is, there are no facts
demonstrating procedural irregularities within the process, that the 3GPP process was subverted
or turned into a sham, or that the Defendants agreed to employ – or indeed did employ – any
improper practices within the standard setting process.” Id. The Court thus distinguished Allied
Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492 (1988), in which the Supreme Court
held that conspirators are not immune from antitrust liability when they employ such improper
means to bias a standard-setting process.
b.

The Court held that the amended complaint likewise failed to allege any

facts to support the claim that Defendants reached any agreement to delay development of Band
Class 12 standards and devices. Op. 25-26. The Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ remaining claims –
based on AT&T Mobility’s alleged exclusive-dealing arrangements with device manufacturers
and its alleged refusal to provide roaming services access to Plaintiffs – because “conclusory
speculation regarding what could happen at some unknown date in the future . . . fails to
plausibly state a violation of federal antitrust laws.” Op. 26; see Op. 32. With respect to
Plaintiffs’ roaming-related claim, the Court noted that AT&T Mobility is subject to regulatory
requirements; “Cellular South has not alleged that AT&T has presently failed to comply” with
those obligations. Op. 26-27. And the Court noted, in any event, Plaintiffs did not allege any
basis for a claim that AT&T Mobility has any duty, under the antitrust laws, to provide roaming
services to the Plaintiffs. See Op. 29-30. With respect to Plaintiffs’ “exclusive dealing”
allegations, the Court also held that the amended complaint “fail[ed] to allege facts” in support of
the assertion that any such arrangements could “harm competition.” Op. 32.
c.

The Court further held that the foregoing deficiencies were also fatal to

Plaintiffs’ claims under Section 2. See Op. 32-39.

3

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 7 of 16 PageID #: 3449

3.

Plaintiffs filed their motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint; the

new allegations in the proffered complaint provide additional detail concerning 3GPP’s
deliberative process related to the adoption of Band 17 standards. The purpose of the allegations
appears to be to support Plaintiffs’ argument that (1) despite broad membership in 3GPP, a small
number of interested parties may influence the consideration and resolution of certain issues, and
that occurred in this case (Mot. Ex. A ¶¶ 209-237); and (2) Plaintiffs and other similarly situated
licensees did not pay attention to the proposed creation of Band 17 because they assumed that
development would continue on existing Band 12 (id. ¶¶ 238-250). But the basis for Plaintiffs’
standard-setting-related claims has not changed: Plaintiffs concede that “[t]he heart of this
antitrust claim is and was the allegation that the interference justifications offered by the
Defendants to justify the creation of Band 17 were simply not true.” Mem. 6 (emphasis added);
cf. Mot. Ex. A ¶ 257 (acknowledging that “the two types of interference described above as
justification for the creation of Band 17” are “real” but claiming that they nonetheless “provided
no justification for the creation of Band 17”).
ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs’ proposed amendments make clear that their only remaining antitrust claim is a
direct attack on the 3GPP’s decision to create a new Band 17. Plaintiffs make no attempt to
resuscitate claims related to (1) delay in development of Band 12 standards or devices;
(2) alleged exclusive-dealing arrangements in the future; or (3) alleged future denial of access to
roaming. Accordingly, those claims remain dismissed.
The Court should reject Plaintiffs’ effort to revive their claims related to establishment of
Band 17 because Plaintiffs offer no new factual allegations to support the claim that Defendants
unlawfully conspired to subvert the 3GPP process. The decision whether to grant a motion for

4

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 8 of 16 PageID #: 3450

leave to amend rests within the sound discretion of this Court. See United States ex rel. Adrian
v. Regents of Univ. of California, 363 F.3d 398, 403 (5th Cir. 2004). Such a motion should be
denied where, as here, the proposed amendment is “futile” because the amended allegations fail
to state a claim. See In re Enron Corp. Sec., 535 F.3d 325, 334 n.6 (5th Cir. 2008); In re
Southmark Corp., 88 F.3d 311, 314-15 (5th Cir. 1996); see also Mem. 3 (admitting that leave for
amend is properly denied when “amendment [is] deemed to be futile”). Denial of leave to
amend is particularly appropriate in this case because Plaintiffs’ motion is, in substance, a
motion for reconsideration of the Court’s order of dismissal. Plaintiffs do not argue that they
have offered any new direct allegations to support the claim that Defendants entered into an
unlawful agreement, when the alleged agreement was entered into, or who the individuals
participating were. The proposed Second Amended Complaint contains no allegations regarding
any specific statements or conduct by AT&T Mobility. Nor do Plaintiffs offer any new factual
allegations to support their assertion that Defendants illegally subverted the 3GPP standardsetting process. To the contrary, Plaintiffs simply argue what they have argued all along: that
Defendants’ concerns about interference were pretextual and that this allegation is sufficient to
state a claim under Section 1 – even though the 3GPP process was followed “to the letter” and
even though there is no allegation that Defendants ever submitted any false or misleading data to
the 3GPP. 2 Plaintiffs’ amended allegations continue to ask the Court simply to infer that the

2

Plaintiffs repeatedly claim – as they did in their First Amended Complaint – that “the
interference claims which were submitted by [Defendants] to justify the creation of Band 17
were in fact false and pretextual.” Mot. Ex. A ¶ 253. Compare First Am. Compl. ¶ 200 (filed
June 8, 2012) (ECF No. 75) (“none of the interference claims had any merit”; “all of [them] were
pretextual”). But Plaintiffs acknowledge that “the two types of interference described above as
justification for the creation of Band 17” are “real.” Mot. Ex. A ¶ 257. See also id ¶ 255
(“[T]here is no dispute that a nearby Channel 51 broadcast station will interfere with a wireless
carrier if it operates on the Lower A Block.”). In fact, there is no allegation at all that any
defendant ever submitted any falsified or inaccurate data concerning interference, so Plaintiffs’
5

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 9 of 16 PageID #: 3451

conspiracy “had to have” occurred. Op. 17-18. This Court has already ruled that Plaintiffs’
theory is untenable; Plaintiffs offer no reason for the Court to revisit its prior resolution of this
legal issue. 3
THE NEW ALLEGATIONS OF THE PROPOSED SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
DO NOT SUPPORT ANY CLAIM THAT DEFENDANTS CONSPIRED
TO SUBVERT THE 3GPP PROCESS
1.

Plaintiffs argue that their antitrust claim may proceed because they have

adequately alleged that “the 3GPP deck . . . was stacked” against Cellular South and that the
“ ‘spirit’ of 3GPP” was “not satisfied by the process that led to the creation of Band 17.” Mem.
10. Such conclusory assertions cannot supply the factual allegations required to demonstrate an
agreement in violation of the Sherman Act. 4 As this Court correctly ruled, in the absence of
allegations that Defendants conspired to subvert the 3GPP process or turn it into a sham, the
assertion that challenged standards are “anticompetitive” either in their purpose or in effect fails
to state a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Op. 21. Despite access to the records of the
3GPP proceedings, including all of the submissions considered therein – not to mention the
benefit of extensive Federal Communications Commission proceedings addressing these very
issues – Plaintiffs not only are forced to concede that the 3GPP process was followed to the

allegation of “falsity” appears to refer to nothing more than a disagreement as to whether the
interference data provided a justification for the creation of Band 17. That is not a basis for any
antitrust claim.
3

Plaintiffs’ assertion (at 12) that there is “uncertainty” concerning pleading requirements after
Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), is unsupported; more important, it is
irrelevant because nothing in the proposed Second Amended Complaint “cure[s] the pleading
defects” of the prior amended complaint, Mem. 13. To the contrary, the proposed pleading
offers no new factual allegations to support the inference that Defendants illegally conspired.
4

Not only are these assertions conclusory, but they also contradict the factual allegations of the
complaint, which acknowledge – as noted below – that substantial players in the wireless
industry, such as Ericsson, Nortel, and Verizon, did have a meaningful opportunity to raise
objections to the approval of Band 17 and to oppose that approval if they had concluded the
action was unjustified. See infra p. 9.
6

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 10 of 16 PageID #: 3452

letter, but also fail to identify a single piece of data that any of the Defendants submitted to 3GPP
that was false or misleading. As this Court correctly noted:
The highly complex and technical arguments in favor of creating Band Class 17
were set out in writing for evaluation by experts, and the concerns relating to such
creation of Band Class 17 were duly contemplated at 3GPP meetings. The 3GPP
acted by a consensus as it relates to the creation of Band Class 17, and there was
no objection from any person or entity, including the Plaintiffs and Verizon
Wireless, who also holds spectrum licenses in the Lower A Block.
Id. Plaintiffs do not and cannot take issue with this conclusion.
Plaintiffs mischaracterize the Court’s holding, however, when they claim that the Court
found that “the action of 3GPP made it implausible that the interference claim was false.” Mem.
8. As an initial matter, as noted in note 2, supra, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants’
interference claims are false; to the contrary, they affirmatively allege that interference exists.
See, e.g., Mot. Ex. A ¶¶ 255, 257. Rather, they argue that interference concerns did not justify
the creation of a separate Band Class because such interference would not affect carriers
operating in certain portions of Band 12. And the Court never questioned that assertion; that is,
the Court did not reject the technical validity of Plaintiffs’ arguments about the necessity for the
creation of a separate Band 17. See Op. 21. The Court nevertheless correctly ruled that such
disputes about the technical merits of a standard adopted through a bona fide standard-setting
process do not provide the basis for an antitrust claim – and that does not change because a
plaintiff accuses the participants in the standard-setting process of anticompetitive motives.
2.

Plaintiffs argue that the allegations of the proffered Second Amended Complaint

give greater force to their argument that the 3GPP process described in the complaint was
comparable to the actions of the defendants in Allied Tube. Plaintiffs have alleged nothing of the

7

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 11 of 16 PageID #: 3453

kind. 5 As this Court explained, in Allied Tube, the defendants conspired to block approval of the
plaintiff ’s product by packing a meeting with voters who had no professional interest in the
standards at issue. See Op. 20. It was thus an “egregious case where it [was] clear that the
exclusion can have no other purpose than facilitation of collusion or the exclusion of a superior
product.” XIII Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 2232b, at 415 (2d ed. 2005). As this Court
explained, Allied Tube involved a standard-setting process “that was biased through the use of
improper and unfair practices and procedures.” Op. 21 (citing Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil
Pipe Inst., 851 F.2d 478, 488 (1st Cir. 1988)). Nothing comparable is alleged here; to the
contrary, all the participants in the standard-setting process were legitimate parties with an
undisputed interest in the standards governing wireless spectrum.
Plaintiffs argue that it is enough for them to assert that AT&T Mobility “took advantage
of an existing forum at which its friends were present and in control,” to bring their allegations
within Allied Tube. Mem. 11. But the same type of conclusory allegation can be put forward
with respect to any standard-setting activity. It is always possible for a plaintiff to assert that
interested members of a standard-setting organization took a more vigorous role in deliberations
than other members with less at stake; that non-participants did not appreciate the importance of
an issue; or that the organization failed to conduct an adequate investigation. If such assertions
were sufficient to subject every industry standard to antitrust scrutiny, standard-setting would
grind to a halt. See Op. 21-22 (citing Golden Bridge Tech., Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 547 F.3d 266,
273 (5th Cir. 2008)).

5

This Court has already considered and rejected Plaintiffs’ arguments based on Allied Tube. See
Op. 20-21. Plaintiffs nevertheless devote a substantial portion of their memorandum re-arguing
the applicability of that precedent, see Mem. 8-11, illustrating that their motion is an improper
motion for reconsideration that should be rejected for that reason as well.
8

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 12 of 16 PageID #: 3454

Moreover, the factual allegations of the complaint provide no support for Plaintiffs’
characterization of the process that the 3GPP followed in this case: as alleged in the complaint,
several companies (not just Defendants) actively participated in the deliberations that led to the
creation of Band 17, and the 3GPP acted in a manner consistent with the technical
recommendations submitted. See Mot. Ex. A ¶¶ 225-229 (acknowledging, but downplaying,
participation by Ericsson, Nortel, and T-Mobile). Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ readiness to accuse
Defendants of having made “false” claims, they do not allege that anything in the technical
papers that Motorola and AT&T Mobility submitted to the 3GPP was false. Plaintiffs concede
that Verizon Wireless – AT&T’s largest competitor – participated in the 3GPP process; Verizon
had a critical interest in the standards for the Lower A Block because it is a major owner of that
spectrum. See id. ¶ 234. While Plaintiffs assert that Verizon was indifferent to standard-setting
for the Lower A Block, see id., that assertion is implausible: even if Verizon had no immediate
plans to exploit that spectrum, it would be economically irrational for Verizon to fail to protect
the economic value of spectrum for which it had paid hundreds of millions of dollars. And
though Plaintiffs fault Defendants for failing to give them better “notice” of contemplated 3GPP
action, id. ¶ 242, the complaint does not contest that 3GPP agendas and planned actions were
publicly announced. Plaintiffs may regret that they did not take a more active role in the 3GPP
process, but that does not give them an antitrust claim.
The standards governing antitrust challenges to standard-setting activity reflect the procompetitive importance of legitimate standard-setting, which necessarily involves concerted
action and which virtually always favors some interests over others. See AT&T Mobility Mem.
13-16 (filed May 23, 2012) (ECF No. 66). Absent a factual basis for the claim that standardsetting was turned into a sham designed to exclude competitors, such activity is lawful. Leaving

9

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 107 Filed: 10/18/12 13 of 16 PageID #: 3455

conclusory rhetoric to one side, Plaintiffs allege nothing but a disagreement with the consensus
judgment of the 3GPP, reached after legitimate deliberations that followed the organization’s
lawful procedures “to the letter.”
3.

Plaintiffs’ reliance on the district court’s denial of the defendants’ motion to

dismiss in TruePosition, Inc. v. LM Ericsson Telephone Co., Civil Action No. 11-4574, 2012
WL 3584626 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 21, 2012) – which the Court already considered in its previous
order 6 – does not support Plaintiffs’ effort to allege a violation of Section 1. The TruePosition
court found that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to support the claim that the defendants
had agreed to manipulate the 3GPP standard-setting process by using positions of power within
3GPP to circumvent 3GPP rules and by relying on “false” data to prevent or delay consideration
of a rival technology. See id. at *10-*20 (reviewing allegations related to improper manipulation
of 3GPP process), *22 (summarizing detailed allegations). Here, Plaintiffs have failed to allege
any such improper manipulation and subversion of the 3GPP process. See Op. 21-22.

6

See Op. 2 n.2. Plaintiffs cite the district court’s denial of the defendants’ motion for
reconsideration (decided after this Court ruled) but that brief memorandum contains no
additional substantive analysis of the complaint at issue there.
