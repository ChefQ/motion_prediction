MOTOROLA’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION
TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT
Defendants Motorola Solutions, Inc. and Motorola Mobility LLC (f/k/a Motorola
Mobility, Inc.) (collectively, “Motorola”) submit this Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’
Motion to Amend Complaint [Doc. No. 105], and request that the Motion be denied in its
entirety. As explained in Motorola’s Memorandum Brief in Support of Motorola’s Response in
Opposition, denial of Plaintiffs’ Motion is warranted because further amendment of the
complaint would be futile.
This Response in Opposition is based on the accompanying Memorandum Brief, the
supporting Declaration of Chahira Solh (“Solh Declaration”), Defendant AT&T Mobility LLC’s
Response in Opposition and the Memorandum of Law submitted in support thereof, Defendant
Qualcomm Incorporated’s Response in Opposition and the Memorandum of Law submitted in
support thereof, and all other documents submitted in support thereof, as incorporated by
reference hereby; the pleadings, records, and papers already on file in this action and those filed
herein, and such other matters and oral argument as may be presented at any hearing on
Plaintiffs’ Motion.

Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Rule 201(d) provides that the court “shall take judicial notice if requested
by a party,” as long as the court is “supplied with the necessary information” to show that the

stage of the proceedings.1
