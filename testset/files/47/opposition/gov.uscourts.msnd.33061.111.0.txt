DEFENDANT QUALCOMM INCORPORATED’S RESPONSE
IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendant Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) hereby submits this Response
in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint.
1.

Plaintiffs have had multiple opportunities in which to allege facts sufficient to

show an entitlement to relief—in an Amended Complaint filed after Defendants filed motions to
dismiss, and at the oral argument on Defendants’ motions to dismiss—and this Court held that
the Plaintiffs did not, despite these opportunities, state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
In so holding, this Court pointed to multiple specific and repeated shortcomings in the Plaintiffs’
allegations.
2.

Plaintiffs are now seeking leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. Leave to

amend may be denied where amendment would be futile because the proposed amended
complaint fails to state a claim. See In re Southmark Corp., 88 F.3d 311, 314-15 (5th Cir. 1996).
But the Plaintiffs’ proposed Second Amended Complaint cures none of the deficiencies
identified by this Court; instead it rehashes old allegations that have been extensively briefed,

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 111 Filed: 10/18/12 2 of 5 PageID #: 3663

considered and rejected by this Court, and raises “new” allegations that are based on information
that has been publicly available for several years and are also completely insufficient to show
any plausible entitlement to relief.
3.

For example, the proposed Second Amended Complaint still does not make

plausible allegations of an agreement among the Defendants. It completely fails to identify
“who” entered into any such alleged agreement, “when” such an agreement was entered, and
“what” any agreement entailed. In addition, Plaintiffs’ “new” allegations regarding 3GPP at the
time Band 17 was created do not show any violation of the antitrust laws, including under Allied
Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492 (1988). Instead, the Plaintiffs’
allegations regarding 3GPP are really an improper attempt to relitigate this Court’s prior
interpretation and application of Allied Tube.

Lastly, the remaining “new” allegations in

Plaintiffs’ proposed Second Amended Complaint fail to show that Qualcomm’s technical
concerns regarding Band 17 were pretextual.
4.

Consequently, the proposed Second Amended Complaint fails to state a claim and

would therefore be a futile attempt to seek relief from this Court.
5.

In support of this Response, Qualcomm relies on the arguments and authorities set

forth in the accompanying Memorandum of Law in Support and the materials attached to this
Response as Exhibits A through D:

6.

Additionally, Qualcomm relies upon and incorporates by reference the Responses
