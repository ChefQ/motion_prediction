MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT
Plaintiffs Corr Wireless Communications, L.L.C., Cellular South, Inc. and Cellular South
Licenses, LLC (collectively, Cellular South) submit this Motion to Amend Complaint and seek
to file a Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint against AT&T, Inc., AT&T Mobility
LLC, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Motorola Mobility, Inc. (collectively, Motorola), Qualcomm
Incorporated, and John Does 1-10 (collectively, Defendants).1

A true and correct copy of

Cellular South’s proposed Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint is attached as Exhibit
1.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) expressly provides that “[t]he court should freely
give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.” “Rule 15(a) expresses a strong presumption in
favor of liberal pleading . . . .” Lowrey v. Texas A&M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 245 (5th Cir.
1997) (emphasis added) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). Additionally, courts
have recognized that allowing amendment “is especially advisable when such permission is

Cellular South amended its Complaint once as of right in order to correct minor technical points and to
add references to matters that had occurred since the original Complaint was filed.

sought after the dismissal of the first complaint.” Barry Aviation, Inc. v. Land O’Lakes
Municipal Airport Comm’n, 377 F.3d 682, 687 (7th Cir. 2004). “Unless it is certain from the
face of the complaint that any amendment would be futile or otherwise unwarranted, the district
court should grant leave to amend after granting a motion to dismiss.” Id.
In Foman v. Davis, the Supreme Court set forth the criteria for determining whether a
court should grant leave to amend a complaint and held as follows:
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith
or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies
by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by
virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave
sought should, as the rules require, be “freely given.”
371 U.S. at 182 (emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has time and again
reinforced the liberal standard set forth in Foman for determining whether to grant or deny a
motion to amend. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Willard. v. Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc.,
336 F.3d 375, 386-87 (5th Cir. 2003) (noting that leave to amend “should be granted absent some
justification for refusal”).
Accordingly, Cellular South’s Motion to Amend under FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a) should be
granted if there is no finding of: (1) undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive; (2) repeated
failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed; (3) undue prejudice to the
Defendants by virtue of allowing the amendment; or (4) futility.
First, Cellular South’s Motion to Amend is not made for purposes of undue delay, in bad
faith, or with dilatory motive. It cannot be disputed that Cellular South has sought expeditious
review throughout these proceedings. Cellular South requests leave to amend its Complaint in a
candid effort to cure pleading deficiencies identified by the Court. Second, there has not been
“repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed.” This is the first time

2

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 105 Filed: 10/01/12 3 of 6 PageID #: 2816

Cellular South has sought to amend its Complaint following the Court’s Memorandum Opinion,
which identified pleading deficiencies. Third, Defendants cannot show that allowing Cellular
South to amend its Complaint will cause them “undue prejudice.” Last, allowing Cellular South
an opportunity to amend its Complaint would not be futile. As explained in detail in the Cellular
South’s Memorandum in Support of this Motion to Amend, Cellular South’s proposed Second
Amended and Supplemental Complaint sets forth additional factual allegations addressing the
perceived deficiencies identified by the Court in its Memorandum Opinion. The Second
Amended and Supplemental Complaint alleges facts which demonstrate that Defendants’ claims
of interference were false and that Defendants’ actions at 3GPP violated the spirit of 3GPP’s
rules. Accordingly, there is no apparent reason or substantial justification to deny Cellular
South’s Motion to Amend.
Moreover, it is apparent that there is uncertainty in the courts as to the level of specificity
required for pleading a claim under the standard set forth in Twombly. As a result of this
uncertainty, courts should, in situations such as the one at hand, allow a party whose pleading is
dismissed based on the Twombly pleading standard an opportunity to amend after the court has
made its decision. See, e.g., Indep. Trust Corp. v. Stewart Info. Servs. Corp., 665 F.3d 930, 943
(7th Cir. 2012) (“In applying Rule 15(a), the uncertainty in pleading standards resulting from the
Supreme Court’s decisions in Iqbal and Twombly also provides powerful reasons to give parties
a reasonable opportunity to cure defects identified by a district court.”).
CONCLUSION
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and precedent of the Supreme Court and Federal
Courts of Appeals make clear that leave to amend should be freely given. Additionally, there is
no apparent reason or substantial justification for the Court to deny Cellular South’s Motion to

Amend. Cellular South seeks leave to plead facts necessary to remedy the deficiencies in its
First Amended and Supplemental Complaint, perceived by the Court in its Memorandum
Opinion. Finally, the uncertainty that exists in the wake of Twombly and Iqbal weighs heavily in
favor of granting Cellular South’s Motion to Amend. For these reasons, the Court should grant
Cellular South leave to file its Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint.
