MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT
Plaintiffs Corr Wireless Communications, L.L.C., Cellular South, Inc. and Cellular South
Licenses, LLC (collectively, Cellular South) submit this Memorandum in Support of their
Motion for leave to file a Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint against AT&T, Inc.,
AT&T Mobility LLC, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Motorola Mobility, Inc. (collectively, Motorola),
Qualcomm Incorporated, and John Does 1-10 (collectively, Defendants). A true and correct
copy of Cellular South’s proposed Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint is attached to
the Motion to Amend as Exhibit 1.
As established by the United States Supreme Court and reiterated by the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, a motion to amend under FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a) should be granted unless it
would cause undue delay, would be futile, would cause undue prejudice to defendants, is deemed
to have been made in bad faith or with a dilatory motive, or if there has been a repeated failure to
cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed. Because none of those circumstances exist
here, this Court should grant Cellular South leave to amend its Complaint, allowing Cellular

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 2 of 16 PageID #: 3428

South an opportunity to cure the pleading deficiencies identified by the Court in its
Memorandum Opinion.
I.

The Court Should Freely Give Leave to Amend Absent Some Apparent Reason
or Substantial Justification Otherwise.
Although the determination of whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is within the

sound discretion of the court, that discretion is limited by the explicit language of FED. R. CIV. P.
15(a), which provides that “[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so
requires.” See also Lowrey v. Texas A&M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 245-46 (5th Cir. 1997).
“Rule 15(a) expresses a strong presumption in favor of liberal pleading . . . .” Lowrey, 117 F.3d
at 245 (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). While it is acknowledged that leave
to amend is not automatic, the United States Supreme Court has held that “[i]f the underlying
facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be
afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182
(1962); see also Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., 417 F.2d 203, 205 (5th Cir. 1969)
(“Summary disposition of litigation, especially antitrust cases, is disfavored and amendments
should be liberally granted so that all cases may be decided on their merits.”).
In Foman v. Davis, the Supreme Court set forth the criteria for determining whether a
court should grant leave to amend a complaint and held as follows:
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith
or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies
by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by
virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave
sought should, as the rules require, be “freely given.”
371 U.S. at 182.
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has time and again reinforced the liberal standard set
forth in Foman for determining whether to grant or deny a motion to amend. For example, in
2

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 3 of 16 PageID #: 3429

United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc., 336 F.3d 375, 386-87 (5th
Cir. 2003), the Fifth Circuit noted that leave to amend “should be granted absent some
justification for refusal.” 336 F.3d at 386. The court elaborated:
The liberal amendment policy underlying Rule 15(a) affords the court broad
discretion in granting leave to amend and, consequently, a motion for leave to
amend should not be denied unless there is “undue delay, bad faith or dilatory
motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by
amendments previously allowed [or] undue prejudice to the opposing party by
virtue of allowance of the amendment . . . .”
Id. (quoting Foman, 371 U.S. at 182). The court in Humana Health, a False Claims Act case,
ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend because the
party seeking amendment failed to expressly request leave to amend before the district court,
because that party had already twice been granted leave to amend but failed to cure the
complaint’s lack of specificity, and because amendment was deemed to be futile. Id. at 387-88.
See also Surgical Care Ctr. of Hammond, L.C. v. Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 1 of Tangipahoa Parish,
309 F.3d 836, 841 (5th Cir. 2002) (“[A] district court must have a ‘substantial reason’ to deny a
request for leave to amend.” (citation omitted)).
Allowing amendment “is especially advisable when such permission is sought after the
dismissal of the first complaint.” Barry Aviation, Inc. v. Land O’Lakes Municipal Airport
Comm’n, 377 F.3d 682, 687 (7th Cir. 2004). “Unless it is certain from the face of the complaint
that any amendment would be futile or otherwise unwarranted, the district court should grant
leave to amend after granting a motion to dismiss.” Id. (citing Bisciglia v. Kenosha Unified Sch.
Dist. No. 1, 45 F.3d 223, 230 (7th Cir. 1995) (reversing denial of leave to amend because record
was not clear that plaintiff could state no set of facts upon which relief could be granted); Rohler
v. TRW, Inc., 576 F.2d 1260, 1266 (7th Cir. 1978) (“The permission to amend a complaint
should be refused only if it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff cannot state a claim upon
3

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 4 of 16 PageID #: 3430

which relief can be granted.”); Polich v. Burlington N., Inc., 942 F.2d 1467, 1472 (9th Cir. 1991)
(“Dismissal without leave to amend is improper unless it is clear . . . that the complaint could not
be saved by any amendment.”)).
The Circuit Courts of Appeals unanimously recognize the Supreme Court’s admonition
that leave to amend a complaint should be freely given under Rule 15(a) in the absence of some
substantial justification or apparent reason for denial. See, e.g., Sanofi-Aventis v. Apotex, Inc.,
659 F.3d 1171, 1181-82 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 373 (3d Cir. 2000); C.F.
ex rel. Farnan v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 654 F.3d 975, 985 (9th Cir. 2011) (policy of
allowing complaints to be freely amended should be “applied with extreme liberality”); New
Albany Tractor, Inc. v. Louisville Tractor, Inc., 650 F.3d 1046, 1052-53 (6th Cir. 2011); In re
Interbank Funding Corp. Sec. Litig., 629 F.3d 213, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2010); Oliver Schools, Inc. v.
Foley, 930 F.2d 248, 253 (2d Cir. 1991) (“Where the possibility exists that the defect can be
cured and there is no prejudice to the defendant, leave to amend at least once should normally be
granted as a matter of course.”).
As explained in greater detail below, Cellular South seeks leave to amend in order to set
forth more extensive factual allegations and remedy the pleading deficiencies identified by the
Court in its Memorandum Opinion. Consistent with the precedent of the Supreme Court and
Circuit Courts of Appeals, district courts also generally allow a movant to amend its complaint to
include additional factual allegations to cure deficiencies identified in a ruling on a motion to
dismiss. See, e.g., Universal Grading Serv. v. eBay, Inc., 2012 WL 70644, at *3 (N.D. Cal 2012)
(noting court had previously granted leave to amend antitrust complaint to plead specific facts
supporting Sherman Act § 1 claims following dismissal); Rio Grande Royalty Co. v. Energy
Transfer Partners, L.P., 786 F. Supp. 2d 1190, 1200-02 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (granting defendant’s

4

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 5 of 16 PageID #: 3431

motion to dismiss but also granting plaintiff leave to amend complaint to include factual
allegations “that raise a reasonable expectation of a conspiracy” between defendants and noting
that, under the federal rules, such leave should be “freely granted,” especially where plaintiff
“has not received numerous chances to amend without correcting pleading flaws”); E.I. Du Pont
De Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 683 F. Supp. 2d 401, 427 (E.D. Va. 2009) (granting
motion to dismiss but also granting leave to amend antitrust complaint to allege relevant
geographic market and anticompetitive conduct therein); In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust
Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1113 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (granting motion to dismiss after finding
that, as initially drafted, antitrust complaint lacked sufficient allegations specific to each
defendant but also granting leave to amend complaint to enhance specific facts); Arnold
Chevrolet, LLC v. Tribune Co., 418 F. Supp. 2d 172, 192-93 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (granting motions
to dismiss only to extent that court could “not conceive of any possible permutation on the facts
as pled that might support an amendment” and granting leave to amend complaint to “address the
pleading concerns” enunciated by the court).
II.

There is No Apparent Reason or Substantial Justification for Denying Cellular
South’s Motion to Amend.
The Court should grant Cellular South’s Motion to Amend if there is no finding of the

following: (a) undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive; (b) repeated failure to cure pleading
deficiencies by amendments previously allowed; (c) undue prejudice to the Defendants by virtue
of allowing the amendment; or (d) futility of amendment.
A.

No Undue Delay. First, it should be clear that Cellular South’s Motion to Amend

is not made for purposes of undue delay or with dilatory motive for the simple and obvious
reason that Cellular South has sought expeditious review throughout these proceedings.

5

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 6 of 16 PageID #: 3432

Additionally, this Motion to Amend is not made in bad faith. Cellular South requests leave to
amend its Complaint in a candid effort to cure pleading deficiencies identified by the Court.
B.

No Repeated Failure to Cure Pleading Deficiencies. Second, there has not

been a “repeated failure to cure pleading deficiencies by amendments previously allowed.” This
is the first time Cellular South has sought to amend its Complaint following the Court’s
Memorandum Opinion, which identified pleading deficiencies.1 Cellular South now seeks to
amend its Complaint in an effort to cure the pleading deficiencies identified by the Court.
C.

No Undue Prejudice. Third, Defendants cannot show that allowing Cellular

South to amend its Complaint will cause them “undue prejudice.” In Lowrey v. Texas A&M
Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d at 245-46, the court opined that “the touchstone of the inquiry under rule
15(a) is whether the proposed amendment would unfairly prejudice the defense by denying the
defendants notice of the nature of the complaint.” 117 F.3d at 245. At this stage of the
proceedings, the Defendants are more than sufficiently aware of the nature of Cellular South’s
claims against them, and they will suffer no undue prejudice from the amendment.
D.

Not Futile. Allowing Cellular South an opportunity to amend its Complaint

would not be futile. Cellular South’s proposed Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint
sets forth additional factual allegations addressing the perceived deficiencies addressed by the
Court in its Memorandum Opinion. The heart of this antitrust claim is and was the allegation
that the interference justifications offered by the Defendants to justify the creation of Band 17
were simply not true. The Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint alleges that the claims
of interference were false as a matter of science and engineering. That is a fact that Cellular

1

Cellular South did amend its complaint once after the Motions to Dismiss were filed but
before the Memorandum Opinion was issued to correct some technical defects in the original
complaint, and allege new facts which had developed since the initial filing.
6

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 7 of 16 PageID #: 3433

South contends must be accepted for purposes of this litigation.2 Cellular South would never
have instituted this litigation if there really had been genuine interference issues that would have
actually impeded the utilization of Band 12 by carriers such as AT&T.
Because the Defendants have asserted no reason for creating Band 17 other than
interference – and because the claim that “interference” required the creation of Band 17 is
demonstrably false as a matter of science – Cellular South alleges that the only plausible reason
for the creation of Band 17 was to craft a private ecosystem for AT&T, resulting in the multitude
of anticompetitive effects outlined in the First Amended and Supplemental Complaint. The First
Amended and Supplemental Complaint alleged that, because those interference claims are
demonstrably false, they were a mere pretext to allow creation of a private ecosystem for AT&T
for anticompetitive purposes.
The Court’s Memorandum Opinion did not directly address this critical issue of whether
the claims of interference were true or false. Instead, the Court stated:
Unlike Allied Tube, which involved a standard setting process that was biased
through the use of improper and unfair practices and procedures, see Clamp-All
Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute, 851 F.2d 478, 488 (1st Cir. 1988) (Breyer,
J.) (discussing Allied Tube), in this case sub judice, the Defendants’ conduct
during the 3GPP process in 2008 is, on its face, lawful. While Plaintiffs argue
that Defendants’ technical justifications set forth during the 3GPP process are
merely pretext for anticompetitive behavior, the 3GPP process was followed to
the letter. That is, there are no facts demonstrating procedural irregularities within
the process, that the 3GPP process was subverted or turned into a sham, or that
2

The proposed Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint alleges additional facts that
have come to light since the First Amended and Supplemental Complaint was filed which makes
it not only plausible but indisputable that Defendants’ claims of interference are false. For
example, Cellular South has learned that Qualcomm has manufactured and is selling a chip
which works on Band 12 and U.S. Cellular is actually operating a Band 12 network (albeit with a
limited number of Band 12 devices and no prospect for Band 12 roaming). It is virtually
impossible to reconcile those facts with the Defendants’ contentions advanced at 3GPP to justify
the creation of Band 17. Moreover, the FCC has already made it clear that most of the
interference concerns offered to 3GPP have no merit and is seriously considering whether any
interference concerns justify the separation of Band 17 from Band 12.
7

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 8 of 16 PageID #: 3434

the Defendants agreed to employ—or indeed did employ—any improper practices
within the standard setting process. The highly complex and technical arguments
in favor of creating Band Class 17 were set out in writing for evaluation by
experts, and the concerns relating to such creation of Band Class 17 were duly
contemplated at 3GPP meetings. The 3GPP acted by a consensus as it relates to
the creation of Band Class 17, and there was no objection from any person or
entity, including the Plaintiffs and Verizon Wireless, who also holds spectrum
licenses in the Lower A Block.
(Memorandum Opinion at 21.)
In short, the Court found that the action of 3GPP made it implausible that the interference
claim was false. Cellular South believes that the Defendants’ vague descriptions of the 3GPP
process led the Court to attribute far more reliance on the 3GPP process than is warranted under
the facts shown in the Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint. Those facts make it clear
that Allied Tube and Clamp-All require a different result.
Plaintiffs agree that 3GPP followed its own rules “to the letter.” However, that does not
reach the more fundamental question that determined the outcome in Allied Tube. As made clear
by then-Judge Breyer in Clamp-All, the fundamental question for antitrust analysis is not whether
there has been compliance “with the letter” of the rules of standard setting organizations, but,
rather, whether there has been compliance with the “spirit” of those rules:
See Indian Head, Inc. v. Allied Tube & Conduit Corp., 817 F.2d 938 (2d Cir.)
(antitrust claim stated where defendant conspired with other steel companies to
block the approval of plaintiff’s product by a national certifying organization;
defendant acted within the letter of the organization’s rules, but violated
their spirit by paying for and packing a meeting with voters who had little to no
professional interest in the subject matter), aff'd, 486 U.S. 492, 108 S.Ct. 1931,
100 L.Ed.2d 497 (1988) . . . .
Clamp-All Corp., 851 F.2d at 488 (emphasis added).
Allied Tube dealt with the National Fire Association – a body in which the steel conduit
manufacturers were able to obtain a small majority by taking legal efforts to “turn out the vote.”
Allied Tube involved a decision by the standards setting body whose process was followed
8

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 9 of 16 PageID #: 3435

“within the letter.” 817 F.2d 938, 940, 947 (2d Cir.), aff’d, 486 U.S. 492 (1988). That action –
like that of 3GPP – was, on its face, lawful. There was nothing improper in the conduct of the
proponents of steel conduit, who did nothing more than make sure that the steel supporters, all
legitimate members of the Association, turned out and voted. The problem in Allied Tube was
not the “turn out the vote” effort, which was perfectly permissible under the rules. Instead, the
problem in Allied Tube was that the facts raised a real concern that the decision that “polyvinyl
chloride conduit is unsafe” was not the result of science or good judgment, but, rather, the result
of the greater voting power of the steel conduit manufacturers.
However, Allied Tube held that a standard setting organization, even it follows the rules,
cannot adopt standards to exclude competitors based on pretextual concerns which favor the
majority. As the United States Supreme Court noted in its affirmation of the Second Circuit’s
decision in Allied Tube:
That rounding up supporters is an acceptable and constitutionally protected
method of influencing elections does not mean that rounding up economically
interested persons to set private standards must also be protected.
486 U.S. 492, 504 (1988). The Supreme Court in Allied Tube went on to say:
The antitrust validity of these efforts is not established, without more, by
petitioner’s literal compliance with the rules of the Association, for the hope of
procompetitive benefits depends upon the existence of safeguards sufficient to
prevent the standard-setting process from being biased by members with
economic interests in restraining competition.
Id. at 509. The process followed by the steel-favoring members of the National Fire Association
– even though they followed the rules of the Association to the letter – provided no assurance
that there had been unbiased consideration of the actual merits of the claim that polyvinyl
chloride conduit was safe. As the Supreme Court stated:
What petitioner may not do (without exposing itself to possible antitrust liability
for direct injuries) is bias the process by, as in this case, stacking the private
standard-setting body with decisionmakers sharing their economic interest in
9

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 10 of 16 PageID #: 3436

restraining competition.
Id. at 511. Thus, the fact that 3GPP followed its own procedures to the letter does not end the
inquiry. The problem in this case is that the 3GPP deck, like the deck in Allied Tube, was
stacked. Indeed, the situation at 3GPP was far worse than in Allied Tube, since the RAN 4
Working Group included no members who had a substantial economic interest in resisting
AT&T’s efforts to restrain competition. Allied Tube teaches that decisions on issues of science
made by private bodies stacked in favor of one result are not entitled to deference.
The “spirit” of 3GPP – if it is to be afforded deference by this Court – must include an
understanding that technical issues be made in a context that provides some basic fairness and an
opportunity for presentation of competing views. That requirement was not satisfied by the
process that led to the creation of Band 17. The decision to create Band 17 was effectively made
by the Defendants alone. 3GPP’s decision was not based on the independent review of expert
opinions other than those offered by the Defendants. There is no evidence and no reason to
believe that any company or expert, other than Ericsson which expressed its opposition to the
interference claims, made any substantial effort to review or analyze whether the technical
conclusions of AT&T, Motorola and Qualcomm were correct. Instead, the members of 3GPP
simply followed the general practice of deferring to those with an interest in the proposal. In
this case, 3GPP did not include or consider the views of the other Lower A Block licensees who
had no notice of the proposal to create Band 17. Even though the 3GPP record notes the need to
get feedback from operators in the Lower A Block, Qualcomm and Motorola chose not to
consult with Cellular South or other licensees of Lower A Block spectrum or advise them of the
proposal to fragment Band 12, even though they knew of its anticompetitive effect. In short, a
determination by a standards setting organization which considers only one side of an issue

10

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 11 of 16 PageID #: 3437

proposed by a primary member – without any notice to competitors with other interests – is not
entitled to any deference as having been based on a ground other than the desire to achieve an
anticompetitive result.
The 3GPP’s decision to create Band 17 is worthy of even less deference than that in
Allied Tube because at least the National Fire Association conducted a full and open debate in
which all parties could participate. Here, AT&T took advantage of an existing forum at which
its friends were present and in control – just as the steel conduit proponents took advantage of
their majority in the National Fire Association. Under those circumstances, it is no surprise that
3GPP reached the result urged by AT&T. Indeed, one would fully expect that the few members
who took any notice of the action to create Band 17 at RAN 4 or 3GPP would have approved if
no one protested. The 3GPP proceedings, while technically legal, were not in the spirit of a
standards setting body that attempts to resolve issues fairly and on the merits, rather than to
provide a competitive advantage to a member. Certainly, the 3GPP’s decision is not one upon
which this Court can rely in finding implausible the claim that interference concerns are false.
Indeed, in TruePosition, Inc. v. LM Ericsson Tel Co., the court recently denied a Motion
for Certification for Interlocutory Appeal or, in the Alternative, for Reconsideration of its denial
of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion concerning antitrust claims arising out of actions taken by
Qualcomm and others at 3GPP stated: “The context of the conspiracy alleged by TruePosition
is not only within the confines of a standard-setting organization, but includes the premise that
the Corporate Defendants cloaked themselves with the authority of 3GPP, and allegedly abused
3GPP’s rules and procedures, in order to frustrate competition in the marketplace.” No. 11-4574,
2012 WL 4050798, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 14, 2012). That is exactly what occurred here.
Motorola, Qualcomm and AT&T cloaked themselves in the authority of 3GPP to create Band 17

11

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 12 of 16 PageID #: 3438

without technical justification and for anticompetitive purposes. Further, the additional factual
allegations in the proposed Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint demonstrate that the
Defendants had no technical justification for the creation of Band 17, that the failure of Verizon
to object to the creation of Band 17 was merely because Verizon would not be adversely
impacted by the creation of Band 17, and that AT&T had a more than plausible motive to act for
anticompetitive purposes. Along that line, and as alleged in the proposed Second Amended and
Supplemental Complaint, AT&T has gained a competitive advantage over smaller competitors
by depriving them of a Band 12 iPhone 5 and has increased the likelihood of acquiring Lower
700 MHz spectrum from smaller licensees on a favorable basis. The proposed Second Amended
and Supplemental Complaint more precisely describes the actual proceedings of 3GPP related to
the creation of Band 17. Therefore, granting Cellular South leave to file its Second Amended
and Supplemental Complaint would not be futile.
In sum, there is no justification to deny Cellular South’s Motion to Amend because:
(1) such amendment is not sought for purposes of undue delay, bad faith, or with dilatory motive;
(2) Cellular South has not repeatedly failed to cure pleading deficiencies by amendments
previously allowed; (3) the Defendants would not be unduly prejudiced by virtue of allowing the
amendment; and (4) allowing amendment would not be futile.
III.

The Uncertainty of the Level of Specificity Required under Twombly Warrants
an Opportunity to Amend
Moreover, it is apparent that there is uncertainty in the courts as to the level of specificity

required for pleading a claim under the standard set forth in Twombly. As a result of this
uncertainty, courts should, in situations such as the one at hand, allow a party whose pleading is
dismissed based on the Twombly pleading standard an opportunity to amend after the court has
made its decision. See, e.g., Indep. Trust Corp. v. Stewart Info. Servs. Corp., 665 F.3d 930, 943
12

Case: 3:12-cv-00036-SA-SAA Doc #: 106 Filed: 10/01/12 13 of 16 PageID #: 3439

(7th Cir. 2012) (“In applying Rule 15(a), the uncertainty in pleading standards resulting from the
Supreme Court’s decisions in Iqbal and Twombly also provides powerful reasons to give parties
a reasonable opportunity to cure defects identified by a district court.”); see also McCauley v.
City of Chicago, 671 F.3d 611, 627-28 (7th Cir. 2011) (Hamilton, J. dissenting in part and noting
the uncertainty that litigants, lawyers, and district courts face in the light of Twombly and Iqbal
and opining that “a party whose pleading is dismissed based on the Iqbal plausibility standard
should be entitled to an opportunity to amend the pleading after the court has made its
decision.”). It cannot be denied that the basis of dismissal in this case was the Court’s
determination that certain of the allegations in the First Amended and Supplemental Complaint
did not meet the level of plausibility required by Twombly. Accordingly, the Court should grant
Cellular South leave to amend its Complaint in an effort to cure the pleading defects identified
by the Court.
CONCLUSION
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and precedent of the Supreme Court and Federal
Courts of Appeals make clear that leave to amend should be freely given. Additionally, there is
no apparent reason or substantial justification for the Court to deny Cellular South’s Motion to
Amend. Cellular South seeks leave to plead facts necessary to remedy the deficiencies in its
First Amended Complaint, perceived by the Court in its Memorandum Opinion. Finally, the
uncertainty that exists in the wake of Twombly and Iqbal weighs heavily in favor of granting
Cellular South’s Motion to Amend. For these reasons, the Court should grant Cellular South
leave to file its Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint.
