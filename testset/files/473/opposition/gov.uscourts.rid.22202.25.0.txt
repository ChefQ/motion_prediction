C.A. No. 07-123 S

DEFENDANT ANISA INTERNTIONAL, INC.’S OBJECTION TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE A PORTION OF DEFENDANT’S
REPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO
DISMISS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO TRANSFER TO THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA

Defendant Anisa International, Inc. (“Anisa International” or “AI”) submits this
memorandum of law in support of its objection to Plaintiff’s motion to strike a portion of AI’s
Reply Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, to Transfer to the
Northern District of Georgia
I.

ARGUMENT
Plaintiff’s motion to strike is grounded exclusively on a hypertechnical and inaccurate

interpretation of Local Rule (Civ) 7 (“Motions”), and particularly subpart (b)(2), which concerns
the contents of reply memoranda. There is no dispute regarding the applicable rule. It provides
that “A reply memorandum shall consist only of a response to an objection and shall not present
additional grounds for granting the motion, or reargue or expand upon the arguments made in
support of the motion.” (Emphasis added). Where a reply “responds” to an objection, therefore,
its content is only objectionable if its arguments consist of additional grounds to support the

motion, reargument, or an expansion upon the arguments previously made. Because none of
these apply to AI’s reply memorandum, Plaintiff’s motion to strike should be denied.
There is no question but that AI’s arguments with respect to the so-called Cruz factors1
“responded” to Plaintiff’s objection to the motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer this
case. Plaintiff concedes that it raised the Cruz decision for the first time in its memorandum in
support of its objection to the motion. See Pl.’s Mem. at 4.
The fact that AI had not previously expressly mentioned the Cruz decision does not make
its discussion of the case a “new ground” for granting the motion to transfer. The grounds for
the requested motion to transfer were precisely the same at the time AI moved as they are now:
28 U.S.C. § 1404 (should the Court find it has personal jurisdiction over AI) or 28 U.S.C. § 1631
(if it does not). Plaintiff made arguments based on the application of facts to the law, using this
Court’s decision in Cruz as a backdrop, and now objects that AI has responded in kind. This is
precisely the type of argument that is absolutely “responsive” to an objection and proper material
for a reply brief. The facts here are entirely distinct from those in the cases cited by Plaintiff.
See Willis v. Brown U., 184 F.3d 20, 34-35 (1st Cir. 1999) (in reply, plaintiff asserted new
“hostile environment” theory); Aetna Cas. Surety Co. v. P&B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1571 (1st
Cir. 1994) (issue as to propriety of including prejudgment interest on trebled damages waived
where raised for first time in reply); Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st
Cir. 1992) (doctrine of equitable tolling may not be raised for first time in reply brief); Walden v.
City of Providence, 495 F. Supp. 2d 245, 257 n. 16 (D.R.I. 2007) (summary judgment movant
added additional argument in support of a finding of no liability in reply brief). By citing to
these cases as analogous to this one, Plaintiff would have the Court believe that discussing Cruz

amounts to a new and different ground for transferring this case, something separate and apart
from 28 U.S.C. § 1404. Such an argument is just silly, though, since Cruz was interpreting and
applying Section 1404.
Plaintiff’s contention that permitting AI to respond to its discussion of the Cruz decision
would “den[y Plaintiff] the opportunity to fully address the application of the Cruz factors to this
case” (Pl.’s Mem. at 4 n.2) is without merit. Plaintiff had a full and unhampered opportunity to
discuss the Cruz decision: when it raised them – for the first time – in its opposition papers.
That it now feels that its discussion of those factors was somehow inadequate is purely the result
of its own decisionmaking.
Finally, even if the Court is persuaded that AI’s discussion of the Cruz factors is
improper material for a reply, striking that portion of the brief is inappropriate. Plaintiff offers
no support for such a remedy. See Willis, 184 F.3d at 34-35 (no motion to strike filed); Aetna
Cas., 43 F.3d at 1571 (no discussion of striking any portion of brief); Rivera-Muriente v. AgostoAlicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992) (same); Walden, 495 F.Supp.2d at 257 n. 16 (same).
II.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s motion to strike should be denied in its entirety.
