MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF JKA, INC.’S MOTION TO
STRIKE A PORTION OF DEFENDANT’S REPLY MEMORANDUM IN
SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
TO TRANSFER TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA
Plaintiff JKA, Inc. d/b/a Diversified Distribution (“Diversified”) submits this
memorandum of law in support if its motion to strike a portion of Defendant Anisa International,
Inc.’s (“Anisa”) Reply Memorandum In Support Of Its Motion To Dismiss Or, In The
Alternative, To Transfer To The Northern District Of Georgia (“Reply”). As set forth below,
Anisa’s Reply presents new and additional arguments in support of its motion to transfer this
action, in direct contravention of the Local Rules applicable to this proceeding and First Circuit
precedent. Accordingly, Diversified respectfully requests that this Court strike these arguments
from Anisa’s Reply.
Background
Diversified initiated this patent infringement action alleging that Anisa has been and is
making, using, offering for sale, and selling cosmetic cases which infringe upon U.S. Design
Patent No. D-475,918, of which Diversified is the assignee.

PRV 935341.1

In response to Diversified’s

Case 1:07-cv-00123-S-DLM

Document 24

Filed 02/12/2008

Page 4 of 8

Complaint, Anisa filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction or, in the
alternative, to transfer the action.

In its motion, Anisa argued that this action should be

dismissed because the Court lacks either specific or general personal jurisdiction over Anisa.
(Anisa’s Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal
Jurisdiction or, in the Alternative, to Transfer to the Northern District of Georgia (“Anisa’s
Motion”) at 7-17.) In the alternative, Anisa argued that even if the Court finds that it does have
jurisdiction over Anisa, it should transfer the matter to the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404 or § 1631. (Id. at 17.)
Diversified subsequently filed an objection to Anisa’s motion to dismiss or, in the
alternative, to transfer. In response to Anisa’s argument that this action should be transferred to
the Northern District of Georgia, Diversified’s objection pointed out that Anisa’s motion failed
to discuss the factors that this Court traditionally weighs in considering a transfer request
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404, as set forth in Cruz v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., No. C.A. 005-38S,
2005 WL 1231965, at *2 (D.R.I. May 20, 2005) (the “Cruz factors”).

(Diversified’s

Memorandum in Support of its Objection to Anisa’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal
Jurisdiction or, in the Alternative, to Transfer to the Northern District of Georgia at 18.)
Specifically, Diversified’s objection stated as follows regarding this deficiency in Anisa’s
motion: “Apart from the bare fact that it is based in Georgia, Anisa has not presented any facts
which demonstrate that the Cruz factors militate in favor of transferring the case. Anisa’s failure
to adduce any supporting facts requires that its transfer request be denied.” (Id.)
On or about February 8, 2008, Anisa filed its Reply. In its Reply, Anisa, for the first
time, discussed the Cruz factors as they relate to its argument that this action should be
transferred to the Northern District of Georgia. (Reply at 6-7.) The arguments that Anisa

presents in its Reply relative to these factors were not addressed (or even mentioned) in its
original motion and, accordingly, constitute new and additional grounds in support of its motion
to transfer.
Argument
It is well-settled in this Court that new or additional arguments are not properly presented
in a reply memorandum.

Indeed, this Court’s Local Rules specifically and unequivocally

prohibit the presentation of new arguments in a reply brief, stating as follows: “A reply
memorandum shall consist only of a response to an objection and shall not present additional
grounds for granting the motion, or reargue or expand upon the arguments made in support of the
motion.” Local Rule Cv 7(b)(2); see also Walden v. City of Providence, 495 F.Supp.2d 245, 257
n. 16 (D.R.I. 2007) (finding that additional argument presented in reply brief was not
appropriately raised under LR Cv 7(b)(2)). Accordingly, a reply memorandum is properly used
only to respond to an objection filed by an opposing party, not to present additional or expanded
arguments in support of the underlying motion. See Local Rule Cv 7(b)(2); see also Wills v.
Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 27 (1999) (“Reply briefs are to counter the appellee’s arguments, not
to offer new theories of error for the first time.”). It is firmly established under the law of the
First Circuit that arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief will not be addressed because
the other side is not given an adequate opportunity to respond. See Aetna Cas. Surety Co. v.
P&B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1571 (1st Cir. 1994) (“When an argument is raised first in a reply
brief, the appellee is not given an adequate opportunity to respond.”); Rivera-Muriente v.
Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992) (“It is well settled in this court . . . that a legal

argument made for the first time in an appellant’s reply brief comes too late and need not be
addressed.”).1
This Court should strike the portion of Anisa’s Reply discussing the application of the
Cruz factors to this case because these arguments were not raised in Anisa’s original motion to
dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer the action. Accordingly, Anisa’s arguments relative to
these factors are new and additional grounds in support of its motion to transfer, and are not
properly included within its Reply. Indeed, by discussing the Cruz factors in its Reply, Anisa is
attempting to improperly expand on the argument contained in its original motion to transfer, in
direct contravention of both the Local Rules applicable to this action and the law of the First
Circuit. See Local Rules Cv 7(b)(2); see also Wills, 184 F.3d at 27; Aetna Cas. Surety Co., 43
F.3d at 1571; Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 354; Walden, 495 F.Supp.2d at 256 n.16. Because
these arguments were raised for the first time in Anisa’s Reply, Diversified has not been (and
will not be) presented with an adequate opportunity to respond to Anisa’s contentions relative to
application of these factors to the specific facts of this case.2 Accordingly, under both the Local
Rules and First Circuit precedent, the Court should strike this portion of Anisa’s Reply.

1

The rule that a party may not present new or additional arguments in a reply memorandum is also well-established
in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., Multi-Ad Svs., Inc. v. Nat’l Labor Relations Bd., 255 F.3d 363, 370 (7th Cir. 2001)
(“It is well-settled that parties may not raise new arguments or present new facts for the first time in reply.”); Stump
v. Gates, 211 F.3d 527, 533 (10th Cir. 2000) (“This court does not ordinarily review issues raised for the first time in
a reply brief. . . . The reasons are obvious. It robs the appellee of the opportunity to demonstrate that the record does
not support an appellant’s factual assertions and to present an analysis of the pertinent legal precedent that may
compel a contrary result.”); Eyiowuawi v. Sv. Employees Int’l Union Local 20, No. 05C5216, 2006 WL 2355529, at
*4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 11, 2006) (“It is elementary that parties may not raise new arguments or present new facts in their
reply, thus depriving their opponent of an opportunity to respond.”).
2

To the extent that Anisa may argue that the discussion of the Cruz factors in its Reply was somehow in response to
Diversified objection (and thus allowable under the Local Rules), this argument is without merit. Diversified
mentioned the Cruz factors in its objection simply to point out a deficiency in Anisa’s motion. Because Anisa did
not present any argument relative to these factors in its motion, Diversified’s objection did not thoroughly address
the application of these factors to the instant litigation. Accordingly, if the Court were to consider the arguments
raised by Anisa in its Reply, Diversified would be denied the opportunity to fully address the application of the Cruz
factors to this case.

Conclusion
For these reasons, Diversified respectfully requests that this Court strike the portion of
Anisa’s Reply discussing the Cruz factors as they relate to this litigation.
