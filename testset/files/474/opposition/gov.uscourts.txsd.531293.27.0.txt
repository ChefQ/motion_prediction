UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
CLAIMANT’S MOTION TO MITIGATE OR REMIT FORFEITURE
United States opposes Claimant George J. Kioussis’ motion to mitigate or
remit forfeiture.
1. Rule G(e) of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims
and Asset Forfeiture Actions state that “A claimant may seek to mitigate a
forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment by motion
for summary judgment or by motion made after entry of a forfeiture judgment . . .”
The Claimant filed a motion for summary judgement and in that motion he
sought to mitigate the forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause. Docket 9. This
motion was denied by the Court. Docket 18.
2. The Claimant has now filed a second motion seeking to mitigate the
forfeiture under the Excessive Fines clause. Docket 24. It is suggested that the
Court treat this motion as a motion to reconsider the Court’s order denying the

Claimant’s motion for summary judgment based on Excessive Fines Clause. In
the present motion, the Claimant does not present any evidence supported by an
affidavit or declaration to support his argument that a forfeiture would be
excessive. Nor does he present any legal or factual support for the Court to
reconsider the earlier order.
3. Accordingly, the Plaintiff requests that the Court deny the Claimant’s
motion.
