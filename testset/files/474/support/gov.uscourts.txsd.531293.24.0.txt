privacy. This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether

alleged criminal activity. That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of
the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities

traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical
withholding of information that identifies third parties In law enforcement recards is
ordinarily appropriate. As such, | have determined that the privacy interest in the identities
