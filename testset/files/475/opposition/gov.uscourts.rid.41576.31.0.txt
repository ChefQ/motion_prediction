INTRODUCTION

1
2

Defendants’ motion established that Fannie Mae and FHFA, as Fannie Mae’s

3

Conservator, are not government actors for purposes of constitutional claims because

4

conservatorship does not amount to permanent government control under Lebron, the governing

5

Supreme Court precedent. In response, Plaintiff argues that Defendants are government actors,

6

primarily because conservatorship purportedly puts the Enterprises under permanent government

7

control or because Lebron supposedly does not govern.
Plaintiff is wrong. Unanimous authority, including recent, on-point decisions of two

8
9

federal appellate courts and at least 36 federal district judges, confirms that Lebron controls and

10

that neither the Enterprises nor FHFA as their Conservator can be deemed a government actor

11

subject to constitutional claims because conservatorship, though indefinite, is inherently

12

temporary. 1
Facing this solid wall of authority, Plaintiff asserts that this case “involves a murky area

13
14

of constitutional jurisprudence”—and that the roughly 40 on-point federal decisions issued to

15

date are all “clearly erroneous or too cursory to be reliable,” and “have been widely criticized by

16

legal scholars” in publications such as Georgia Real Estate Finance and Foreclosure Law. Opp.

17

at 4-5 nn.2-3. Plaintiff is wrong again. These articles express their authors’ wish that the law

18

were different; they do not describe the actual state of the law this Court must apply. Even the

19

Georgia publication, whose authors include foreclosure-relief advocates rather than neutral

20

“legal scholars,” 2 acknowledges that the “initial lower federal court decisions [that] have

21

addressed the implications of the Lebron test as applied to the conservatorship of Fannie Mae

22

and Freddie Mac have concluded that state action is not present,” and reiterates that “[d]ecisions

23

that . . . evaluate the Lebron factors in light of the 2008 [conservatorship] conclude that state

24

action is not present.” F. Alexander et al., Georgia Real Estate Finance and Foreclosure Law

For the Court’s convenience, Defendants attach a list of the federal court decisions as

The authors include the general counsel of the Center for Community Progress and an
attorney with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society’s Home Defense Program.

§ 14:2 (emphasis added). 3

2

In any event, courts—who base their decisions on precedent—have carefully considered

3

the same arguments Plaintiff offers here and uniformly rejected them as foreclosed by Supreme

4

Court authority. The district court and Court of Appeals opinions in Herron, for example,

5

analyze and apply the governing precedents; they are neither “clearly erroneous [n]or too cursory

6

to be reliable.” See Opp. at 4 n.2. If some of the many other decisions—a few of which

7

expressly adopt the Herron district court’s analysis with little additional discussion—are brief,

8

that confirms the law is clear, not “murky” as Plaintiff suggests.
Plaintiff’s arguments fail, and the Court should grant Defendants’ Motion.

9

ARGUMENT

10
11

I.

12

FHFA AS CONSERVATOR IS NOT A GOVERNMENT ACTOR FOR
PURPOSES OF CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS.
Plaintiff argues primarily that FHFA is a government actor for purposes of this case

13
because it is a federal agency, and that Fannie Mae must therefore be one too because it operates
14
under FHFA’s conservatorship. Opp. at 5-6. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts.
15
No one could question that FHFA is a federal agency. But that is of no moment here,
16
because Plaintiff’s allegations as to FHFA concern only its capacity as Conservator of Fannie
17
Mae—a private corporation—not as a federal regulatory agency; Plaintiff neither alleges nor
18
could allege that FHFA, in connection with the foreclosure at issue, exercised any power or
19
authority beyond the private contractual rights it inherited as Fannie Mae’s statutory successor.
20
See 12 U.S.C. § 4617(b)(2)(A)(i) (The Conservator “immediately succeed[s] to . . . all rights,
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

3

Similarly, another of the articles Plaintiff cites—the law-student comment William E.
Eye, Comment, Are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac State Actors? State Action, Due Process, &
Nonjudicial Foreclosure—recites that the “[c]ourts that have considered this issue in recent years
have almost unanimously found that Fannie and Freddie do not satisfy the Lebron test,” then
advocates for “a novel approach to determin[ing] whether Fannie and Freddie are state actors.”
65 Emory L.J. 107, 109-10 (2015). Plaintiff also claims an article published in 2010—Grant S.
Nelson, Confronting the Mortgage Meltdown: A Brief for the Federalization of State Mortgage
Foreclosure Law, 37 Pepp. L. Rev. 583 (2010)—somehow “criticize[s]” decisions issued years
later. Opp. at 4-5 n.3. The early, oft-cited district court decision in Herron, for example, was
issued in 2012. See Herron v. Fannie Mae, 857 F. Supp. 2d 87 (D.D.C. 2012) (“Herron I”).
Plaintiff’s inversion of the timing was undoubtedly an honest mistake, but it shows how tenuous
Plaintiff’s argument is.

titles, powers, and privileges of the regulated entity” in conservatorship.). As the D.C. Circuit

2

recently explained, in its capacity as Conservator, FHFA is not a government actor for

3

constitutional purposes because it “step[s] into Fannie Mae’s private shoes,” thus becoming a

4

private actor itself for such purpose. Herron v. Fannie Mae, 861 F.3d 160, 169 (D.C. Cir. 2017)

5

(“Herron II”) (citing Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 848 F.3d 1072, 1103 & n.22 (D.C. Cir.

6

2017); Meridian Invs., Inc. v. Freddie Mac, 855 F.3d 573, 579 (4th Cir. 2017)); see also Freddie

7

Mac v. Shamoon, 922 F. Supp. 2d 641, 645 (E.D. Mich. 2013) (“FHFA, as conservator, merely

8

‘steps into the shoes’ of Freddie Mac, a private corporation.”); May v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA.,

9

No. 4:11-3516, 2013 WL 3207511, at *5 (S.D. Tex. June 24, 2013) (agreeing that “FHFA as

10

conservator ‘stepped into Fannie Mae’s private role’”); Syriani v. Freddie Mac Multiclass

11

Certificates, Series 3365, No. CV 12-3035, 2012 WL 6200251, at *4 (C.D. Cal. July 10, 2012)

12

(same).

13

Plaintiff attempts to avoid this on-point precedent by arguing that the “stepping into

14

shoes” metaphor is not “applicable.” Opp. at 7-8. But Plaintiff offers no support for her view,

15

and as the cases cited above confirm, federal courts have recognized that the “stepping into

16

shoes” metaphor is indeed applicable to constitutional claims concerning FHFA when it acts as

17

Conservator, as it did here. Parra v. Fannie Mae, No. 13-cv-4031, 2013 WL 5638824, at *3

18

(C.D. Cal. Oct. 16, 2013) (“FHFA, which took over as Fannie Mae’s conservator, also does not

19

qualify as a government actor” for purposes of the plaintiff’s Fifth Amendment claim.); Fannie

20

Mae v. Mandry, No. 12-cv-13236, 2013 WL 687056, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 26, 2013) (“Fannie

21

Mae and FHFA are not government actors that can be held liable for [a] Fifth Amendment due

22

process violation.”); Dias v. Fannie Mae, 990 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1061 (D. Haw. 2013)

23

(“Similarly, the FHFA, which took over as Fannie Mae’s conservator, also does not qualify as a

24

government actor.”).

25

Federal court precedent for other financial-institution conservators and receivers

26

operating under substantially the same statutory structure confirms the point. For example, the

27

Fifth Circuit has held that when acting as receiver for a failed bank, the Resolution Trust

28

Corporation (“RTC”) was not a government actor for constitutional purposes. United States v.

-3-

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 10 of 34 PageID #: 560

1

Beszborn, 21 F.3d 62, 68 (5th Cir. 1994). In Beszborn, the RTC receiver successfully pursued an

2

award of punitive damages against former officers and directors of the bank. Id. at 67. Later,

3

when the Department of Justice brought criminal charges against the same individuals

4

concerning the same conduct, they argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the

5

prosecution because the RTC was part of the government, making DOJ’s prosecution a

6

constitutionally barred second sovereign attempt to punish the same wrong. The Fifth Circuit

7

rejected that argument, explaining that “[t]he RTC as receiver of an insolvent financial institution

8

stands in the shoes of the bank” and concluding that “the RTC stands as a private, non-

9

governmental entity, and is not the Government for purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.”

10

Id.; see also United States v. Heffner, 85 F.3d 435, 439 (9th Cir. 1996) (agreeing with Beszborn);

11

United States ex rel. Petras v. Simparel, Inc., 857 F.3d 497, 503-04 (3d Cir. 2017) (applying

12

Beszborn in holding that the Small Business Administration, acting as a receiver, “did not qualify

13

as the Government”).
Despite Plaintiff’s suggestion to the contrary, Defendants do not argue that “when the

14
15

FDIC—or any other federal entity—is a receiver [and steps into the shoes of the private entity],

16

the federal entity becomes a private actor for all purposes.” Opp. at 8 (citing O’Melveny, 512

17

U.S. 79) (emphasis added). 4 Indeed, “an entity may be governmental for one purpose and

18

nongovernmental for another.” Alley v. Resolution Trust Corp., 984 F.2d 1201, 1206 (D.C. Cir.

19

1993); U.S. ex rel. Adams v. Aurora Loan Servs., Inc., 813 F.3d 1259, 1261 (9th Cir. 2016). But

20

when that purpose is the exercise of a purely private, contractual right of an entity in

21

conservatorship (i.e., the power of sale in a mortgage), there is no question FHFA is not

22

considered governmental for purposes of a constitutional claim, as the cases described above

23

confirm.

24

Indeed, Plaintiff identifies no case in which any court has ever deemed any federal

25

financial-institution conservator or receiver to be a government actor for constitutional purposes.

26
27
28

4

Plaintiff’s argument, notably, asks this Court to accept the opposite, untenable extreme.
According to Plaintiff, FHFA is a federal agency and is therefore a governmental actor in all
instances, regardless of the capacity in which FHFA acts.

Rather, she cites to two cases that do not present the issue at all, but instead involve purely

2

Countrywide Fin. Corp., 900 F. Supp. 2d 1055 (C.D. Cal. 2012), and FHFA v. Royal Bank of

Scotland Grp. PLC, No. 3:11-cv-01383, 2012 WL 3580522 (D. Conn. Aug. 17, 2012)).

5

Underscoring the point, each of those cases acknowledges the district court decision in Herron I

6

(the D.C. Circuit had not yet ruled), and expressly indicates that its ruling does not conflict with

7

Herron I.

8

In Countrywide, the court concluded that an ambiguous statute of limitations provision

9

governing litigation brought by the Conservator should be interpreted in FHFA’s favor. 900 F.

10

Supp. 2d at 1066. The court decided the issue as a matter of statutory interpretation, discerning

11

Congress’s intent from the interplay between various provisions of HERA. Id. The Countrywide

12

court plainly considered the question it faced to be different from that presented here, noting that

13

it would reach the same conclusion “regardless of whether the FHFA is a government [actor] for

14

purpose of [constitutional] claims.” Id. at 1066 n.9 (citing Herron I, 857 F. Supp. 2d 87).

15

In Royal Bank, the court held that FHFA, in its capacity as Conservator, was not subject

16

to a mandatory discovery stay under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”).

17

The court again based its decision on statutory-interpretation principles, considering the purpose

18

of the statute, reasoning that “the concerns motivating Congress in enacting the PSLRA are not

19

present here,” and concluding that FHFA’s case was not a “private action” as that term is used in

20

the PSLRA. Royal Bank, 2012 WL 3580522, at *2. Confirming that it was not applying the

21

constitutional principles at issue here, the Royal Bank court denied a motion to reconsider its

22

ruling after the Herron I decision was issued, emphasizing the differing legal context of the two

23

holdings: “Herron does not address the meaning or scope of the term ‘private action’ as used by

24

Congress in the PSLRA. Thus, Herron does not alter the court’s conclusion that where FHFA is

25

‘bringing this action pursuant to its Congressional authorization under HERA,’ the action ‘is not

26

a private action under the PSLRA.’” Order re Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration at 3,

27

Royal Bank, No. 11-CV-01383 (D. Conn. Sept. 30, 2013), ECF No. 201. The Royal Bank

argument has been raised in at least one other foreclosure-related case, and the court rejected it

1

sub silentio in holding that FHFA and Fannie Mae are not government actors subject to the

2

plaintiff’s due process claim. 5 Thus, Countrywide and Royal Bank do not support Plaintiff’s

3

argument.
Plaintiff also cites to an appellate brief FHFA filed in another Second Circuit case,

4
5

similar to Royal Bank, that also did not involve a constitutional claim. Opp. at 7 (quoting Brief

6

at 56 n.15, FHFA v. UBS Americas Inc., No. 12-3207 (2d Cir. Oct. 25, 2012)). Plaintiff

7

overlooks the fact that in the very quote she presents, FHFA expressly limited its analysis to

8

“purposes of statutory interpretation.” Id. Therefore, contrary to Plaintiff’s argument, FHFA did

9

not “concede[]” anything relevant to this case. Unlike UBS, Royal Bank, and Countrywide, this

10

case involves a question of constitutional status, not one of “statutory interpretation.” 6
Plaintiff’s assertion that the Supreme Court’s ruling in FDIC v. Meyer decides this issue

11
12

is also wrong. Opp. at 8-10 (citing 510 U.S. 471 (1994)). Meyer does not stand for the

13

proposition that FHFA, as Conservator, is a government actor subject to constitutional

14

constraints. Instead, Meyer addressed the jurisdictional issue of immunity. 510 U.S. at 475, 479.

15

In Meyer, the Supreme Court held that FDIC’s sue-and-be-sued clause waived its sovereign

16

immunity for purposes of plaintiff’s due process Bivens claim. But that waiver did not

17

automatically make FDIC subject to plaintiff’s claim. Id. at 483. Indeed, as Plaintiff

18

acknowledges, the Supreme Court ultimately held that FDIC was not subject to the due process

It is worth noting that courts applying statutory-interpretation principles often hold that
federal financial-institution receivers and conservators are not the government for certain
statutory purposes. See, e.g., Schock v. FDIC, 118 F. Supp. 2d 165, 169 (D.R.I. 2000) (FDIC as
receiver is not a government body subject to an Equal Access to Justice Act claim, because
“[w]hen the FDIC acts in its capacity as a receiver, its main objective is not to carry out
governmental policy.”), aff’d on other grounds, 254 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001); AG Route Seven
P’ship v. United States, 57 Fed. Cl. 521, 534 (2003) (FDIC receiver not the government for
Tucker Act purposes: “In its capacity as receiver . . . FDIC is merely standing in the shoes, and
thus asserting the claims, of the defunct thrift. . . . Consequently, the FDIC’s attendant role
herein is tantamount to that of a private party, and not the government per se.”); Ambase Corp. v.
United States, 61 Fed. Cl. 794, 796-97 (Fed. Cl. 2004) (similar: “[T]he FDIC receiver could
intervene against the United States. Under prevailing constitutional law, the FDIC receiver
therefore cannot be the government as well.”).

claim. Opp. at 9. Here, FHFA has not argued that, as Conservator, it is immune from Plaintiff’s

2

due process claim or that this Court lacks jurisdiction. Instead, FHFA argues that as a matter of

3

law, Plaintiff’s claim fails. Plaintiff’s “reasoning conflates two ‘analytically distinct’ inquiries.

4

The first inquiry is whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. If there has been

5

such a waiver . . . , the second inquiry comes into play—that is, whether the source of

6

substantive law upon which the claimant relies provides an avenue for relief.” Meyer, 510 U.S.

7

at 484. Here, because the FHFA as Conservator is not a government actor for constitutional

8

purposes, the avenue Plaintiff has selected is closed.

9

As the Ninth Circuit has confirmed, Meyer “did not purport to determine the status of the

10

FDIC when . . . taking over a failed bank as receiver,” United States v. Ely, 142 F.3d 1113, 1121

11

(9th Cir. 1998), nor did it address whether a conservatorship or receivership transforms an

12

otherwise private actor into the government for purposes of constitutional claims. Plaintiff relies

13

heavily on Meyer because it is a Supreme Court decision, but the decision does not support

14

Plaintiff’s argument—nor does it justify a different conclusion from all prior courts that have

15

addressed this issue, all of which would have been bound by Meyer if it applied to the question

16

presented.
FHFA as Conservator is not a government actor subject to constitutional claims.

II.

FANNIE MAE IS NOT A GOVERNMENT ACTOR FOR PURPOSES OF
CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS.
Neither is Fannie Mae a government actor for purposes of this case. As Defendants

20
explained in their Motion, Lebron controls the analysis of whether Fannie Mae—in or out of
21
FHFA conservatorship—is a government actor for purposes of Plaintiff’s constitutional claim.
22
Under Lebron, Fannie Mae is not a government actor because the government lacks permanent
23
structural control over Fannie Mae. FHFA’s control as Conservator (even if assumed incorrectly
24
to be governmental control) is temporary rather than permanent.
25
Plaintiff responds that, contrary to the decisions of every federal court to consider the
26
issue, Fannie Mae is a government actor under Lebron because FHFA’s conservatorship of
27
Fannie Mae has no predetermined endpoint, and therefore purportedly constitutes permanent
28
government control. Opp. at 11-19. Plaintiff is wrong once again. Lebron and the numerous

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 14 of 34 PageID #: 564

1

decisions on the issue make clear that while FHFA’s control over Fannie Mae has no

2

predetermined endpoint and is therefore indefinite, that does not constitute permanent

3

government control for purposes of Lebron. As the D.C. Circuit explained, FHFA’s “indefinite

4

but temporary control does not transform Fannie Mae into a government actor.” Herron II, 861

5

F.3d at 169. 7
Plaintiff also argues that Treasury’s financial support to Fannie Mae converts Fannie Mae

6
7

into a government actor. Opp. at 22-25. That too is wrong. It is common for the government to

8

invest in financial institutions during a financial crisis without the financial institution becoming

9

a government actor for constitutional purposes. Treasury’s financial support is neither

10

permanent nor indicative of structural control. Plaintiff’s arguments to the contrary lack merit.

Sprauve v. W. Indian Co., 799 F.3d 226, 233 n.8 (3d Cir. 2015)). “There is nothing in [HERA]
that makes [FHFA’s] conservatorship permanent.” In re Kapla, 485 B.R. 136, 152 (Bankr. E.D.
Mich. 2012). Rather, the conservatorship is temporary. Indeed, HERA mandates that FHFA
reorganize or rehabilitate Fannie Mae or wind up its affairs; either circumstance would bring the
conservatorship to a close at some future date. 12 U.S.C. § 4617(a)(2). Plaintiff’s argument that
there should be a “specified end date” or “an automatic termination” of the conservatorship to
make it temporary, Opp. at 16-17, is incorrect and not consistent with Lebron. Lebron v. Nat’l

remains as non-federal agencies for purposes of [the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949.] [T]he fact that FHFA has the statutory responsibility as conservator to

R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 399 (1994). Even if conservatorship is assumed to embody

2

government control—it does not, see supra at 2-7—Lebron makes clear that indefinite

3

government control is not permanent government control. Rather, permanent government

4

control requires structural elements that cannot be altered other than by act of Congress, such as

5

statutory charter provisions entitling the President to appoint a majority of the entity’s governing

6

body. Lebron, 513 U.S. at 397.

7

Indeed, the federal courts that have addressed this issue have applied Lebron and found

8

that the Enterprises are not government actors for purposes of constitutional claims because the

9

government lacks such permanent, structural control. See Appendix A. For example, the D.C.

10

Circuit held that “the conservatorship over Fannie Mae did not create the type of permanent

11

government control that is required under Lebron.” Herron II, 861 F.3d at 169. Similarly, the

12

Sixth Circuit held that “Congress, by statute, empowered the FHFA to become conservator for

13

Fannie Mae for the limited purpose of ‘reorganizing, rehabilitating, or winding up [its] affairs.’

14

. . . This is an inherently temporary purpose.” Rubin, 587 F. App’x at 275 (alteration in original)

15

(citation omitted); accord Adams, 813 F.3d at 1261 (“[A]ssuming that Lebron outlines the

16

correct analytical framework for False Claims Act purposes, relators’ argument still fails,

17

because relators do not allege that the conservatorship represents the federal government’s

18

retention of permanent authority to control Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.”); 8 Meridian Invs.,

19

Inc., 855 F.3d at 579 (applying Lebron and concluding that “the government does not exert

20

control over Freddie Mac such that it loses its private-party status”). Thus, when and how the

21

conservatorship terminates is not relevant to the Court’s analysis. 9

Plaintiff contrasts the absence of allegations of permanent control in Adams with the
presence of such allegations—albeit unsupported and contrary to law—here. Opp. at 4 n.2. But
what Adams teaches is simply that permanent government control has always been and remains a
required element of the Lebron test, a proposition Plaintiff disputes elsewhere in her brief. See
Opp. at 19-20 (arguing that “the gravamen of the Lebron test is the degree of government
control, not the duration.”).
9

Consequently, that “FHFA’s control over the GSEs has already lasted over nine years,”
Opp. at 16, does not make the conservatorship permanent. FDIC receiverships, which operate
under a materially identical legal structure and have never been held to convert an otherwise
private financial institution into a government actor, have an average duration of 8.7 years.

Nevertheless, Plaintiff argues it is “illogical and inconsistent with the reasoning of

1
2

Lebron” for the Conservator’s control over Fannie Mae to be indefinite but remain temporary.

3

Opp. at 17-18. This is because Plaintiff misunderstands Lebron and the Supreme Court’s

4

endorsement, in that case, of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases—an earlier decision in

5

which the Supreme Court held that Conrail, another federally supported railway subject to

6

extensive government control, was not a federal actor because the government’s control was

7

indefinite rather than structurally permanent:

8

[Amtrak] also invokes . . . the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases . .
., which found . . . Conrail[] not to be a federal instrumentality, despite the
President’s power to appoint, directly or indirectly, 8 of its 15 directors . . .
. But we specifically observed in that case that . . . ‘full voting control . . .
will shift to the shareholders if federal obligations fall below 50% of
Conrail’s indebtedness.’

Lebron, 513 U.S. at 399 (citing Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 152

13

(1974) (emphasis added)). Notably, in Regional Rail, voting control would shift to the Conrail

14

shareholders only if federal financial support fell below a certain level—meaning that even

15

though the government’s control over Conrail had no obvious or fixed end date, control could

16

shift back to the shareholders without further legislation. 10 Thus, even though Conrail did not

17

have “a provision automatically terminating the government’s control” at some predetermined

18

time, Opp. at 17, the government’s control, though functionally complete, was only indefinite

19

and temporary, not permanent.

can appoint itself as receiver of Fannie Mae someday, Opp. at 16 n.7 (citing 12 U.S.C.
§ 4617(a)(4)(D)), does not establish current permanent control.
10

As a practical matter, and though the Supreme Court obviously could not have known it
at the time of the Regional Rail decision, the government’s control over Conrail lasted
approximately 13 years. Regional Rail, 419 U.S. at 111; James Sterngold, 85% U.S. Stake in
Conrail Sold for $1.6 Billion, N.Y. Times (Mar. 27, 1987), http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/27/
business/85-us-stake-in-conrail-sold-for-1.6-billion.html?scp=1&sq=conrail&st=nyt. That is
roughly three years longer than Fannie Mae has been in conservatorship to date, yet no decision
indicates any court ever considered that lengthy but inherently indefinite term of government
control sufficient to convert Conrail into a government actor. See Morin v. Consol. Rail Corp.,
810 F.2d 720, 723 (7th Cir. 1987) (agreeing “with the Second Circuit that Conrail . . . is not an
entity of the federal government for purposes of the due process clause” even after 13 years of
government funding).

1

The Supreme Court distinguished its holding that Conrail was not a government actor

2

from its holding that Amtrak was a government actor on the ground that the government’s

3

authority to appoint the majority of Conrail’s board of directors was contingent on the

4

continuation of federal financial support rather than baked into Conrail’s organic statute.

5

Lebron, 513 U.S. at 399. Even though there was no certainty as to when the federal financial

6

support would end, and therefore no certainty whether (and, if so, when) voting control would

7

ever shift back to the Conrail shareholders, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding that Conrail

8

was not a government actor in the context of a constitutional claim. Id. Notwithstanding that the

9

government was able to exercise control over Conrail’s board of directors, the Supreme Court

10

explained that the indefinite duration of that government control meant that it did not constitute

11

permanent control required by Lebron. Simply put, the government’s authority to appoint the

12

board of directors of Conrail could cease without an act of Congress, whereas the government’s

13

authority to appoint Amtrak’s board could not.

14

Nor is it plausible to argue that Conrail’s financial prospects somehow made its

15

emergence from government control more likely or foreseeable than Fannie Mae’s exit from

16

conservatorship appears today. Indeed, when the Supreme Court determined that Conrail was

17

not a federal actor in 1974, that corporation’s economic outlook was every bit as bleak—and its

18

dependence on federal support as great—as Fannie Mae’s has ever been:

19
20
21
22
23

The record makes abundantly clear what all the parties concede, that
Conrail, though dubbed “a for-profit corporation” . . . shows no prospect
of being an enterprise operating on a profitable basis. Penn Central
losses between June 21, 1970, and December 31, 1973, were $851 million,
and the Reorganization Court . . . found that reorganization on an income
basis was not possible. The values that ride on today’s decisions are
therefore not based on the prospect of future profitable operations.
Regional Rail, 419 U.S. at 163-64 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (emphases added).

24
To the same effect, the Supreme Court also identified “a private corporation whose stock
25
comes into federal ownership” as an example to illustrate the absence of permanent government
26
control over the corporation. Lebron, 513 U.S. at 398 (“Amtrak is not merely in the temporary
27
control of the Government (as a private corporation whose stock comes into federal ownership

1

might be.” (emphases added)). Thus, the Supreme Court itself has unequivocally confirmed that

2

indefinite control is not permanent control.

3

Seeking to neutralize this portion of Lebron, Plaintiff points the Court to dicta describing

4

the Panama Railroad Company, characterizing the passage as indicating that the government’s

5

“ownership of [that company’s] stock . . . confer[red] sufficient control that the . . . company

6

qualified as a government actor.” Opp. at 24 (emphasis added). Plaintiff appears to have made

7

another honest-but-telling mistake. See supra n.3. Lebron’s “detailed recitation of ‘the long

8

history of corporations created and participated in by the United States,’” Sprauve, 799 F.3d at

9

230 (quoting Lebron, 513 U.S. at 386), never indicates whether the Panama Railroad Company

10

ever was, or should have been, deemed a government actor. See Posey v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 93

11

F.2d 726, 727 (5th Cir. 1937) (distinguishing Panama Railroad Company, as “a corporation

12

created under the general laws of some state or territory, [and] whose stock the United States

13

happen[s] to own,” from government-created and controlled corporations that are “plainly . . .

14

government agenc[ies]”).

15

Plaintiff has no persuasive answer to the relevant portions of Lebron, or the more than 30

16

cases applying Lebron in holding the Enterprises are not government actors for constitutional

17

purposes. Instead, Plaintiff asks this Court to look to other, off-point authorities to define an

18

“indefinite time period” to determine if FHFA’s conservatorship is temporary or permanent.

19

Opp. at 15-16. But it is illogical for Plaintiff to ask this Court to look to authorities “[i]n other

20

contexts,” like employment and disability law, Opp. at 15, when Lebron and the more than 30

21

cases following it are the controlling authority on, and clearly address, the very issue of this case.

22

For the same reason, the Court should not accept Plaintiff’s invitation to rely on

23

dictionary definitions when there is case law directly on point. “[C]ase law [is] a preferable

24

source of authority” when “the plaintiffs’ use of a . . . dictionary definition in support of their

25

argument [is] inconsistent with the existing case law.” Basinger v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No.

26

98-334-P-H, 1999 WL 33117106, at *4 n.5 (D. Me. Jan. 27, 1999). Nevertheless, even under the

27

definition Plaintiff cites, FHFA’s conservatorship remains “temporary,” which Plaintiff’s

28

dictionary equates with “lasting for a limited time.” See Opp. at 15 (citing Merriam Webster

1

online dictionary). That a circumstance’s duration is limited does not mean it has a “definite

2

temporal limitation,” i.e., a “specified end date,” as Plaintiff argues. Opp. at 15-16. For

3

example, we are all on this earth for only “a limited time,” but few if any of us know when our

4

time will conclude; our lifetimes, though indefinite, are surely temporary. 11 Similarly, while no

5

one can know today exactly when the Fannie Mae conservatorship will end, it is temporary

6

rather than permanent in the Lebron sense; not even Plaintiff argues that a new legislative

7

enactment is necessary to end it. Perhaps anticipating the point, Plaintiff observes that “nothing

8

is permanent” in a “strict” philosophical “sense.” Opp. at 18. That tautological assertion proves

9

too much; it conflicts directly with the test the Supreme Court prescribed in Lebron, which

10

depends on the premise that some things—such as the Government’s statutorily mandated

11

structural control over Amtrak—are permanent in a different, but equally strict, legal sense.

12

Plaintiff also asks this Court to look to three cases for the proposition that because

13

permanent conservatorships exist in other contexts, FHFA’s conservatorship must be permanent.

14

Opp. at 15 (citing Mitchell v. Ensor, 412 F.2d 155, 158 (1969); United States v. Peelle Co., 224

15

F.2d 667, 669 (2d Cir. 1955); Propper v. Clark, 337 U.S. 472, 476 (1949)). These cases do not

16

involve federal financial-institution conservatorships or receiverships, or any other

17

conservatorship or receivership imposed under a similar statutory structure, and they do not

18

evaluate whether the very different conservatorships at issue were government actors for

19

constitutional purposes. Plaintiff offers no reason why these cases should apply here, and there

20

is none. Defendants need not establish that no conservatorship can ever be permanent in order to

21

prevail. What is at issue are the conservatorships of financial institutions—and they are

22

inherently temporary. Indeed, a financial-institution conservatorship is usually directed toward

23

the eventual resumption of the institution’s private business activity. As one court explained, “a

Indeed, the dictionary Plaintiff cites confirms that indefinite circumstances fit well within
the definition of “temporary”—Merriam Webster illustrates its definition with the quotation
“Investors are weighing whether the sharp swings this week are the start of a deeper correction or
just a temporary bump in the nine-year bull market.” Merriam Webster online dictionary (entry
for “temporary”), last visited Feb. 23, 2018 (citation omitted, emphasis in original). As of today,
no one can know when recent market volatility will end; the circumstance is paradigmatically
indefinite, yet Merriam Webster deems it quintessentially “temporary.”

1

conservator is a person or entity, including a government agency, appointed by a regulatory

2

authority to operate a troubled financial institution in an effort to conserve, manage, and protect

3

the troubled institution’s assets until the institution has stabilized or has been closed by the

4

chartering authority.” Ameristar Fin. Servicing Co., LLC v. United States, 75 Fed. Cl. 807, 808

5

n.3 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

6

Plaintiff further argues that conservatorships cannot be inherently temporary because

7

“Congress could establish conservatorship entities completely controlled by the government and

8

with indefinite duration as a means of avoiding compliance with the United States Constitution.”

9

Opp. at 14. First, Plaintiff’s policy argument cannot negate the legal requirements under Lebron.

10

Second, Plaintiff’s argument fails because the premise is wrong and misconstrues the nature of

11

FHFA’s conservatorship and of conservatorships and receiverships generally. Indeed, Plaintiff

12

disregards the policy supporting conservatorships. The FDIC and FHFA are authorized by

13

statute to place a failing financial institution in conservatorship or receivership to facilitate their

14

safety and soundness. After doing so, these agencies step into the shoes of the regulated entity as

15

Conservators and do not control the regulated entities as part of the government for purposes of

16

constitutional claims. See supra at 2-7.

17

Lastly, Plaintiff contends that Lebron requires courts to look beyond Congressional

18

“labels,” such as a “conservatorship,” when determining whether a corporation is a government

19

actor for purposes of constitutional claims. Opp. at 13-14 & n.6. The discussion in Lebron to

20

which Plaintiff refers, however, merely explains that Congress’s pronouncement that a

21

corporation is not a government actor is not dispositive of that entity’s status for constitutional

22

claims. For example, in Lebron, the Supreme Court explained that Congress could not avoid the

23

restrictions of the Fourth Amendment by issuing a pronouncement that the Federal Bureau of

24

Investigation was not a government actor. 513 U.S. at 392-93. In any event, the more than 30

25

federal decisions to reject Plaintiff’s claim have not relied on a Congressional pronouncement

26

regarding Fannie Mae’s status post-conservatorship. See Appendix A. Indeed, no such

27

Congressional pronouncement exists. Instead, the unanimous federal decisions to reject

Plaintiff is likewise incorrect in asserting that the Treasury’s financial support of Fannie

Mae establishes that Fannie Mae is a government actor for constitutional purposes. Opp. at 2225. As explained in Defendants’ Opening Brief, Mot. at 9-10, Treasury’s investment in Fannie
Mae is irrelevant to Fannie Mae’s status for constitutional purposes because the financial support
does not give Treasury permanent control over Fannie Mae. See Lebron, 513 U.S. at 398
(characterizing a private corporation “whose stock comes into federal ownership” as only “in the
temporary control of the Government”).
Indeed, it is common for the government (through Treasury and FDIC) to invest in

Treasury’s Financial Support of the Fannie Mae Conservatorship Does Not
Establish Permanent Government Control Under Lebron.

troubled financial institutions to support the broader financial system. In prior financial crises,
the government purchased equity of, and provided substantial financial support to, troubled
banks, often under detailed contracts. See, e.g., Holland v. United States, 75 Fed. Cl. 483 (2007);
Caroline Hunt Trust Estate v. United States, 470 F.3d 1044 (Fed. Cir. 2006); FDIC v. Morley,
867 F.2d 1381 (11th Cir. 1989). This financial support does not convert the subject institutions
into government actors. See, e.g., Wiggins v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, 2:14-cv-11103, 2015 WL
868933 (S.D.W.V. Feb. 27, 2015) (recipient of TARP funds not a government actor). 12 Despite
arguing that the federal support provided to the Fannie Mae conservatorship makes Fannie Mae a
government actor, Plaintiff identifies no case—because there is none—in which a private
financial institution has been deemed a government actor by virtue of accepting federal
assistance while in conservatorship or receivership.
12

Similar to Treasury’s financial support of the Fannie Mae conservatorship, “Treasury
used the TARP authority to make investments loans and asset guarantees and purchases in or
from a range of financial institutions. In exchange for this assistance, Treasury, on behalf of the
taxpayer, received financial instruments including equity securities (preferred stock, common
stock and warrants) . . . .” U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, Where Did The Money Go?(Nov. 15,

1

Lebron and Regional Rail are dispositive here. Lebron makes clear that even if

2

government financial support results in the government retaining a controlling interest in a

3

corporation for an indefinite (but non-permanent) period, that support is insufficient to convert

4

the corporation into a government actor. 513 U.S. at 399 (reaffirming the holding in Regional

5

Rail that Conrail, a private corporation, was not converted into a government actor despite the

6

government’s considerable support as guarantor). This is so because “when the government

7

acquires an ownership interest in a corporation, it acts—and is treated—as any other

8

shareholder.” Meridian Invs., Inc., 855 F.3d at 579 (citing Lebron, 513 U.S. at 398, and Bank of

9

U.S. v. Planters’ Bank of Ga., 22 U.S. 904, 907 (1824)).

10

Moreover, Plaintiff is incorrect that “the Lebron court actually counted the directors of

11

Amtrak that the federal government elected by virtue of its present holding of Amtrak’s preferred

12

stock in finding Amtrak was a government actor.” Opp. at 23. The Supreme Court only

13

analyzed whether Amtrak’s governance structure under its organic statute reflected permanent

14

government control; it did, because the chartering statute allowed the government to appoint six

15

of the nine directors. Lebron, 513 U.S. at 385. Because Amtrak was always under permanent

16

government control, the Court could not and did not ground its decision that Amtrak was a

17

government actor on any aspect of the incremental control the government gained through its

18

financial assistance arrangement. That temporary arrangement was superfluous to the

19

government’s pre-existing permanent control, and therefore irrelevant—the Supreme Court made

20

no mention in its analysis of the additional appointment power the government gained by

21

acquiring Amtrak’s stock. Id. at 397 (“As we have described, six of the corporation’s eight

22

externally named directors (the ninth is named by a majority of the board itself) are appointed

23

directly by the President of the United States . . . .”).

24

Here, Fannie Mae’s charter does not grant the government permanent authority to appoint

25

Fannie Mae’s directors—“The Federal National Mortgage Association shall have a board of

26

directors, which shall consist of 13 persons . . . who shall be elected annually by the common

27

stockholders.” 12 U.S.C. § 1723(b). Moreover, in applying Lebron, the court in Herron I

28

- 16 -

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 23 of 34 PageID #: 573

1

rejected Plaintiff’s argument that Treasury’s ownership of Fannie Mae’s stock gives it permanent

2

control over Fannie Mae:

3

The Stock Agreement did not give the government permanent control over
Fannie Mae. The Stock Agreement provided Treasury with a warrant to
purchase 79.9% of the total shares of Fannie Mae common stock
outstanding on the date of exercise at a nominal price. . . . As of this date,
Treasury has not exercised this warrant. The Stock Agreement also
required Treasury to provide funding to Fannie Mae to ensure a positive net
worth in exchange for shares of Senior Preferred Stock that pay a certain
dividend. . . . Senior Preferred Stock conferred no voting rights. . . . Thus,
Treasury’s warrant to purchase common stock and its ownership of nonvoting Senior Preferred Stock do not give the United States permanent
control over Fannie Mae and do not make Fannie Mae a government entity
under Lebron.

6
7

9
10

857 F. Supp. 2d at 96 (emphasis added). That conclusion was plainly correct; as noted above,
11
Lebron specifically identifies “a private corporation whose stock comes into federal ownership,”
12
as lacking permanent government control. Lebron, 513 U.S. at 398.
13
In any event, Treasury does not own common stock and has not obtained any voting
14
rights through its purchase of Senior Preferred Stock. Thus, according to Plaintiff’s own
15
reasoning, Treasury’s financial support does not transform Fannie Mae into a government entity
16
because Treasury’s “ownership of shares [does not] confer[] a controlling interest over the
17
operations of [Fannie Mae]”—much less a permanent controlling interest. Opp. at 25.
18
Moreover, Plaintiff concedes that Fannie Mae’s “directors are currently appointed by FHFA as
19
[C]onservator,” and that Treasury could potentially have authority to appoint Fannie Mae’s
20
directors (if it purchases common stock) when the conservatorship ends. Opp. at 25. Plaintiff
21
cannot then argue that Fannie Mae is currently under Treasury’s permanent control based on
22
Treasury’s hypothetical ability to appoint Fannie Mae’s directors after conservatorship.
23
Treasury’s financial support does not amount to permanent government control under
24
Lebron and does not impose government-actor status onto Fannie Mae.

LEBRON CONTROLS THESE ISSUES AND SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS DO
NOT UNDERMINE LEBRON’S PERMANENCY REQUIREMENT.
Unable to identify a single, supportive decision involving a federal financial-institution

conservatorship or receivership—all of which favor our arguments and, to the extent they

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 24 of 34 PageID #: 574

1

address Lebron’s permanency requirement, adopt it—Plaintiff argues that decisions after Lebron

2

“teach us that the gravamen of the Lebron test is the degree of government control, not the

3

duration.” Opp. at 19-21. Similarly, Plaintiff argues that “[Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] are

4

government actors, subject to the constraints of the Constitution” because FHFA has “complete”

5

control over them. Opp. at 11-13. Plaintiff also cites to various decisions to argue that this

6

Court can find that Fannie Mae is a government actor under alternative tests. Opp. at 25-28. All

7

of Plaintiff’s arguments fail.

8
9

First, as explained in Defendants’ Opening Brief, Lebron provides the controlling test to
determine if a private, federally-chartered corporation is a government actor for constitutional

10

purposes. Mot. at 6-10. Lebron makes clear that to make an otherwise private entity

11

governmental, permanent control by the government is required. 513 U.S. at 400; see also

12

Herron II, 861 F.3d at 167 (“[W]e apply the framework the Supreme Court established

13

in Lebron for determining whether a ‘Government-created and -controlled corporation[ ]” is a

14

government actor for constitutional purposes”; and “permanency is ‘a necessary condition

15

precedent’ to consider a government-created corporation part of the government.”); Mik v.

16

Freddie Mac, 743 F.3d 149, 168 (6th Cir. 2014) (same); Am. Bankers Mortg. Corp. v. Freddie

17

Mac, 75 F.3d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir. 1996) (same). Indeed, the First Circuit confirms that

18

permanent control is the requirement. Barrios-Velazquez v. Asociacion de Empleados del Estado

19

Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, 84 F.3d 487, 492 (1st Cir. 1996). In Barrios-Velazquez, the First

20

Circuit applied Lebron and held that there was no government action because “neither party in

21

the instant case has contended that the Government of Puerto Rico has retained permanent

22

authority over the directors of the [regulated entity].” Id. (emphasis added).

23

Second, Plaintiff cites Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic

24

Association to argue that permanent control is not a requirement under Lebron because the case

25

“make[s] no mention of the word ‘permanent.’” Opp. at 19 (citing 531 U.S. 288, 296 (2001)).

26

But the Supreme Court in Brentwood was not analyzing a government-created entity and

27

therefore did not conduct its analysis under Lebron; accordingly, it did not need to analyze

28

whether permanent structural control rested with the government. Nevertheless, the Supreme

- 18 -

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 25 of 34 PageID #: 575

1

Court plainly endorses the Lebron holding, citing to it as an “example[] from our cases . . .

2

showing that the character of a legal entity is determined neither by its expressly private

3

characterization in statutory law, nor by the failure of the law to acknowledge the entity’s

4

inseparability from recognized government officials or agencies.” Brentwood Acad., 531 U.S. at

5

296.

6

Brentwood provides an alternative test that applies to entities other than federally

7

chartered corporations—pervasive entwinement. Because Fannie Mae (like Amtrak) is a

8

federally chartered corporation, Lebron rather than Brentwood controls. Regardless, Fannie Mae

9

would not be deemed a government actor under Brentwood either. Under Brentwood, for a

10

private entity to be deemed a government actor, the entity must be pervasively entwined with a

11

government agency or official that is “acting in their official capacity.” 531 U.S. 298-300. But

12

as we explained above in Section I, when FHFA as Conservator directs Fannie Mae’s operations,

13

it does so in a non-governmental capacity. See supra at 2-7. Hence, conservatorship is

14

irrelevant under Brentwood. Herron I, 857 F. Supp. 2d at 96 (rejecting plaintiff’s “entwinement”

15

theory because “Brentwood did not change the law of conservatorship and receivership . . .

16

Fannie Mae was a private entity; when FHFA took over as conservator of Fannie Mae, it stepped

17

into Fannie Mae’s private role”). Similarly, because “when the government acquires an

18

ownership interest in a corporation, it acts—and is treated—as any other shareholder,” Meridian

19

Invs., Inc., 855 F.3d at 579, Treasury is not pervasively entwined with Fannie Mae to make

20

Fannie Mae a government actor under Brentwood.

21

Nor could Plaintiff plausibly argue that anything about the government’s relationship

22

with Fannie Mae (and Freddie Mac) other than FHFA’s conservatorship and Treasury’s financial

23

support somehow demonstrates “pervasive entwinement,” as that would mean the Enterprises

24

were government actors for constitutional purposes before conservatorship. That proposition

25

was uniformly rejected whenever asserted. Roberts v. Cameron-Brown Co., 556 F.2d 356, 359-

26

60 (5th Cir. 1977) (rejecting due process claim brought by a borrower against pre-

27

conservatorship Fannie Mae for commencing a non-judicial foreclosure); Northrip v. Fannie

28

Mae, 527 F.2d 23, 30 (6th Cir. 1975) (rejecting claim that pre-conservatorship Fannie Mae was a

- 19 -

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 26 of 34 PageID #: 576

1

federal actor subject to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment); Am. Bankers Mortg.

2

Corp., 75 F.3d at 1406 (holding that similarly-situated, pre-conservatorship Freddie Mac was not

3

a government actor for purposes of a Fifth Amendment due process claim).

4

Third, Plaintiff cites to Department of Transportation v. Association of American

5

Railroads to argue that Lebron does not require that “the government’s control over the

6

corporation be permanent.” Opp. at 19-20 (citing 135 S. Ct. 1225 (2015)). Wrong. Nothing in

7

American Railroads alters Lebron. Indeed, the Supreme Court approvingly cites Lebron in

8

reaffirming that Amtrak was a government actor; it never purports to criticize or limit Lebron’s

9

analysis. Ass’n of Am. R.R., 135 S. Ct. at 1233. And after American Railroads, other courts

10

have continued to recognize permanency as a required element under Lebron. Indeed, in

11

rejecting the same argument Plaintiff makes here, the D.C. Circuit “d[id] not read Department of

12

Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, as dispensing with the permanency

13

requirement,” instead holding specifically that “permanency is a necessary condition precedent

14

to consider a government-created corporation part of the government.” Herron II, 861 F.3d at

15

168 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Adams, 813 F.3d at 1261; Sprauve,

16

799 F.3d at 233; Loren v. City of New York, No. 16-cv-3605, 2017 WL 5903358, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

17

Nov. 28, 2017) (denying a motion for reconsideration because “the government did not retain the

18

permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors to [the entity]’s board, and thus did not

19

meet the standard set out in Lebron”).

20

Regardless, American Railroads does not discuss the permanence of government

21

authority over Amtrak because the Supreme Court had already found it in Lebron and the parties

22

did not dispute it. Instead, they argued about a different issue: the Amtrak “‘charter’s disclaimer

23

of agency.’” Ass’n of Am. R.R., 135 S. Ct. at 1233. The Court applied Lebron to resolve that

24

argument: “Lebron teaches that, for purposes of Amtrak’s status as a federal actor or

25

instrumentality under the Constitution, the practical reality of federal control and supervision

26

prevails over Congress’ disclaimer of Amtrak’s governmental status.” Id.

27
28

Fourth, Plaintiff’s citation to Becker v. Gallaudet University for “[f]urther support that
Lebron focuses on the degree of control and not the duration” fares no better. Opp. at 20-21

- 20 -

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 31 Filed 02/28/18 Page 27 of 34 PageID #: 577

1

(citing 66 F. Supp. 2d 16 (D.D.C. 1999)). In that case, the court states that permanent control is

2

a required element under Lebron. 66 F. Supp. 2d at 20. After applying the Lebron test, the

3

Court held that the defendant, Gallaudet University, was not a government actor because “[t]he

4

number of public positions on Gallaudet’s Board of Trustees, [3 of 21], is a strong indication that

5

the federal government does not exercise sufficient control.” Id. at 20-21. It was not necessary

6

for the court to analyze whether the government exerted permanent control, because the court

7

found that the government did not exert any control.
Finally, Plaintiff also cites Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts of

8
9

Philadelphia, a three-paragraph opinion that pre-dates Lebron. Opp. at 27 (citing 353 U.S. 230,

10

231 (1957)). City Trusts does not govern here and in any event is entirely consistent with

11

Lebron’s requirement of permanent structural control. In City Trusts, “an act of the

12

Pennsylvania legislature” expressly provided for the board of a state college to be controlled by

13

“an agency of the State.” Pennsylvania, 353 U.S. at 231. 13 The Court reached the unremarkable

14

conclusion that the college’s admission decisions constituted state action. Id. By contrast, when

15

FHFA acts as Conservator, it directs Fannie Mae’s operations in a non-governmental capacity

16

and without permanent structural control. See supra at 2-7. Likewise, Treasury “acts—and is

17

treated—as any other shareholder” when it supports financial institutions through stock

18

ownership. Meridian Invs., Inc., 855 F.3d at 579. Thus, Plaintiff’s argument that the

19

government controls Fannie Mae for purposes of Lebron or any other state-action test applicable

20

to constitutional claims must fail.

21

CONCLUSION

22

For the reasons set forth herein, Fannie Mae and FHFA respectfully request that the

23

Court grant their motion for judgment on the pleadings and enter judgment in their favor.

24
25

Respectfully submitted,

26
27
28

13

Of course, the mere legislative creation of an entity is not sufficient alone to make the
agency a government actor, as that is but one element of the test set forth in Lebron.
