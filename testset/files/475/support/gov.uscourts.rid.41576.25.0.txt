MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE
PLEADINGS PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 12(c)
Plaintiff claims that Defendants Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”),
a federally chartered private corporation, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”), a
federal agency acting as Fannie Mae’s Conservator, violated her Fifth Amendment due process
rights when Fannie Mae conducted a non-judicial foreclosure of her property pursuant to state
law. But neither Fannie Mae nor FHFA as its Conservator is a government actor subject to Fifth
Amendment constraints. As a result, Plaintiff’s claim fails as a matter of law.
Every federal court to consider whether Fannie Mae or the similarly-situated Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), which is also under FHFA conservatorship,
is a government actor for constitutional purposes—including the Sixth and D.C. Circuits—has
held that they are not. See, e.g., Herron v. Fannie Mae, 861 F.3d 160, 169 (D.C. Cir. 2017); Mik
v. Freddie Mac, 743 F.3d 149, 168 (6th Cir. 2014).
These courts rely on Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374
(1995), which provides the test for when an otherwise-private corporation can be deemed a
government actor for constitutional purposes. That test requires, among other things, that the
government retain permanent control over the corporation. Because Fannie Mae was not a
government actor before conservatorship, and conservatorship does not give the government
permanent control over Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae cannot be deemed a government actor under

300877401v1 0995019

Lebron.
FHFA, as Fannie Mae’s Conservator, likewise is not a government actor for purposes of

3

constitutional claims. Rather, the Conservator assumes Fannie Mae’s private status when

4

overseeing Fannie Mae’ s ordinary business activities, such as foreclosing on defaulted

5

mortgages. Accordingly, Fannie Mae and FHFA are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Town of Johnston v. FHFA, 765 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir. 2014).
In July 2008, Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008

12

(“HERA”), Pub. L. No. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654 (codified as 12 U.S.C. § 4511 et seq.), which

13

established FHFA. Compl. ¶ 9. FHFA is an independent federal agency with regulatory and

14

oversight authority over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Id.

15

In September 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (together, “the

16

Enterprises”) into conservatorships “for the purpose of reorganizing, rehabilitating, or winding

17

up [their] affairs.” 12 U.S.C. § 4617(a)(2); Compl. ¶¶ 10-11. In its capacity as Conservator,

18

FHFA succeeded to “all rights, titles, powers, and privileges” of the Enterprises and their

19

respective stockholders, boards of directors, and officers. See 12 U.S.C. § 4617(b)(2)(A)(i);

20

Compl. ¶¶ 15, 21. Thus, FHFA assumed the power to oversee Fannie Mae’s operations. Id.

21

HERA also amended the Enterprises’ statutory charters to grant the Treasury authority to

22

purchase securities issued by the Enterprises, so long as they reached “mutual agreement” on the

23

terms. See 12 U.S.C. § 1719(g)(1)(A) (Fannie Mae); 12 U.S.C. § 1455(l)(1)(A) (Freddie Mac).

Pursuant to this authority, Treasury and the Conservator entered into Senior Preferred Stock

Plaintiff’s sole cause of action in this matter is deprivation of property without due

11

judicial foreclosure violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States

Constitution. Compl. ¶¶ 53-54. Based upon these purported due process violations, Plaintiff

13

claims deprivation of ownership in the Property, cloud on title, impairment of her ability to sell,

rent or otherwise alienate the Property, damage to her credit rating, reduced chance of obtaining

15

a future mortgage, eviction, and loss of security in her dwelling. Compl. ¶ 55. Plaintiff further

LEGAL STANDARD

20

A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is decided under the same

21

standard as a motion to dismiss. Trombley v. Bank of Am. Corp., 715 F. Supp. 2d 290, 292

22

(D.R.I. 2010). A complaint cannot survive such a motion if “the plaintiff can prove no set of

23

facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36,

24

43 (1st Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). In deciding the motion, the Court must “view the facts

25

contained in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion—here, the

26

plaintiff—and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.” Id.

ARGUMENT

2

Plaintiff asserts that Fannie Mae and FHFA denied her due process under the Fifth

3

Amendment of the United States Constitution. Compl. ¶¶ 51-61. Plaintiff’s assertion fails as a

4

matter of law. “It is well-settled that the due process provision of the Fifth Amendment serves as

5

a limitation only on governmental, not private, action.” Velez-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry, 421 F.3d

6

71, 79 (1st Cir. 2005). Fannie Mae is not a government entity, nor do Fannie Mae’s actions

7

constitute federal action for purposes of triggering constitutional due process protections. Prior

8

to conservatorship, Fannie Mae was a private corporation. No one contends it was a government

9

actor, nor could anyone—precedent confirms unequivocally that it was not. During

10

conservatorship, FHFA controls Fannie Mae but that control is neither permanent nor

11

governmental, as applicable precedent requires for an otherwise-private corporation to be

12

deemed a government actor. Indeed, when acting as Conservator of Fannie Mae, FHFA is not a

13

government entity for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. When FHFA placed Fannie Mae into

14

conservatorship, the agency stepped into the shoes of a private corporation to conduct its day-to-

15

day operations and thereby assumed Fannie Mae’s private status, not vice versa. Thus, FHFA,

16

as Conservator, does not act as part of the government for purposes of constitutional claims.

FANNIE MAE IS NOT A GOVERNMENT ACTOR FOR PURPOSES OF
CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS
For almost 50 years, Fannie Mae has operated as a private corporation “created by federal

charter to support the development of the secondary mortgage market.” Town of Johnston, 765
F.3d at 82. Originally created by the National Housing Act of 1934, Congress transformed
Fannie Mae’s status from a government entity into a private entity in 1968. Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-448, 82 Stat. 476 (1968). Since 1968 and prior to
conservatorship in 2008, Fannie Mae was not a government actor for purposes of constitutional
claims. See Roberts v. Cameron-Brown Co., 556 F.2d 356, 359 (5th Cir. 1977) (rejecting due
process claim brought by a borrower against pre-conservatorship Fannie Mae for commencing a
non-judicial foreclosure); Northrip v. Fannie Mae, 527 F.2d 23, 30 (6th Cir. 1975) (rejecting
claim that pre-conservatorship Fannie Mae was a federal actor subject to the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment); see also Am. Bankers Mortg. Corp. v. Freddie Mac, 75 F.3d 1401,
-4300877401v1 0995019

1

1409 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Lebron and holding that pre-conservatorship Freddie Mac was not a

2

government actor for purposes of a constitutional claim).

3

The key issue here, therefore, is whether conservatorship converted Fannie Mae into a

4

government actor. It did not. Federal courts have unanimously held that Fannie Mae, even in

5

conservatorship, maintains its private identity for purposes of constitutional claims. These courts

6

rely on Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374 (1995), which

7

governs the analysis of whether a federally chartered, private corporation can be deemed a

8

government actor. Under the Lebron framework, Fannie Mae is not a government actor because

9

FHFA’s conservatorship—even if assumed to amount to government control—does not involve

10

permanent control. 1

Every federal court to have considered the issue has held that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, while in conservatorship, are not government actors for purposes of constitutional claims.
See, e.g., Herron, 861 F.3d at 169; Mik, 743 F.3d at 168. Most recently, the D.C. Circuit held
that conservatorship “does not transform Fannie Mae into a government actor” and dismissed the
plaintiff’s First Amendment Bivens claim. Herron, 861 F.3d at 169. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit
held that “Freddie Mac is not a government actor who can be held liable for violations of the
Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.” Mik, 743 F.3d at 168; see also Rubin v. Fannie Mae,
587 F. App’x 273, 275 (6th Cir. 2014) (same for Fannie Mae in the context of a non-judicial
foreclosure).

Federal Courts Have Unanimously Held That the Enterprises Are Not
Government Actors While in Conservatorship for Purposes of Constitutional
Claims

Likewise, district courts routinely hold that the Enterprises are not part of the government
for constitutional purposes while in conservatorship. As one district court explained, “[b]ecause
the FHFA lacks permanent control over Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae is not a state actor, and
Plaintiff’s constitutional claims cannot survive.” Matveychuk v. One W. Bank, FSB, No. 1:13cv-3464-AT, 2016 WL 4059681, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 28, 2016); see also, e.g., Dias v. Fannie
1

As discussed in Section II below, FHFA’s conservatorship of Fannie Mae does not
constitute governmental control.

3

virtue of the FHFA conservatorship.”); Freddie Mac v. Shamoon, 922 F. Supp. 2d 641, 645 (E.D.

4

Mich. 2013) (“FHFA’s conservatorship of Freddie Mac does not and cannot transform that

5

9

does not become a governmental actor for Fifth Amendment purposes merely because it is

10

placed into conservatorship.”). Notably, the majority of these authorities involve foreclosure

11

disputes, just as this case.

12

Applying these decisions here, it is clear that by placing Fannie Mae into conservatorship

13

and acting in its capacity as Conservator of Fannie Mae, FHFA did not transform Fannie Mae

14

into a government actor for purposes of constitutional claims.

Lebron Controls the Government-Actor Analysis for Constitutional Claims
against Otherwise-Private Corporations and Requires that the Government
Retain Permanent Control

The federal courts above have relied on and correctly applied Lebron in determining that
the Enterprises are not government actors for purposes of constitutional claims. See, e.g.,
Herron, 861 F.3d at 167 (“[W]e apply the framework the Supreme Court established in Lebron
for determining whether a ‘Government-created and -controlled corporation[ ]’ is a government
actor for constitutional purposes.”); Mik, 743 F.3d at 168. And two additional Courts of Appeals
have applied Lebron to hold that the Enterprises are not government actors for other purposes.
See Meridian Invs., Inc. v. Freddie Mac, 855 F.3d 573, 579 (4th Cir. 2017); U.S. ex rel. Adams v.
Aurora Loan Servs., Inc., 813 F.3d 1259, 1261 (9th Cir. 2016). Thus, four federal appellate
courts agree that under Lebron Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not government actors even
though they are in FHFA’s conservatorship. These courts’ uniform analysis and application of
Lebron is correct.
In Lebron, the Supreme Court held that where “[1.] the Government creates a corporation
-6300877401v1 0995019

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 25 Filed 12/15/17 Page 7 of 13 PageID #: 501

1

by special law, [2.] for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and [3.] retains for itself

2

permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation, the corporation is

3

part of the Government for purposes of the First Amendment.” 513 U.S. at 399 (emphasis

4

added). In holding that Amtrak was part of the government, the Supreme Court emphasized that

5

“Amtrak is not merely in the temporary control of the Government (as a private corporation

6

whose stock comes into federal ownership might be),” but rather was under permanent

7

government control. Id. at 398 (emphasis added). Lebron remains the operative test and

8

permanent control is a necessary element. See Dep’t of Transp. v. Ass’n of Am. Railroads, 135

9

S. Ct. 1225, 1233 (2015) (citing favorably to Lebron); Barrios-Velazquez v. Asociacion de

10

Empleados del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, 84 F.3d 487, 492 (1st Cir. 1996)

11

(recognizing that permanent control is a necessary element).

12

Lebron confirms that conservatorship does not transform Fannie Mae into a government

13

actor for purposes of constitutional claims because the conservatorship does not grant the

14

government permanent authority to appoint a majority of Fannie Mae’s directors. Plaintiff

15

alleges that “the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae is entirely appointed by FHFA,” Compl. ¶ 31,

16

but omits that as a matter of law, FHFA holds that prerogative only as Conservator, not as Fannie

17

Mae’s regulator. Compare 12 U.S.C. § 1723(b) (Fannie Mae charter provision stating that “[t]he

18

Federal National Mortgage Association shall have a board of directors, which shall consist of 13

19

persons . . . who shall be elected annually by the common stockholders.”) with 12 U.S.C.

20

§ 4617(b)(2)(A)(i) (FHFA, when appointed “as [C]onservator,” shall “by operation of law,

21

immediately succeed to . . . all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of [Fannie Mae], and of any

22

stockholder, officer, or director.”). Accordingly, FHFA’s authority to appoint Fannie Mae’s

23

directors will last only as long as the conservatorship remains in place, and conservatorship is

24

inherently temporary.

25
26
27
28

As the D.C. Circuit explained in Herron:
While the conservatorship authorized the government to exercise
substantial control over Fannie Mae, “that control is temporary, ‘as
a private corporation whose stock comes into federal ownership
might be.’” See Meridian Invs., 855 F.3d at 579 (quoting Lebron,
513 U.S. at 398, 115 S. Ct. 961). Thus, the government’s
-7300877401v1 0995019

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 25 Filed 12/15/17 Page 8 of 13 PageID #: 502

1

indefinite but temporary control does not transform Fannie Mae
into a government actor. See Lebron, 513 U.S. at 399, 115 S.Ct.
961 (citing Reg'l Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102,
152, 95 S. Ct. 335, 42 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1974)).

2
3
4

861 F.3d at 169.
Plaintiff’s assertion that “[t]here is no other law, regulation, policy or directive that

5
6
7
8
9
10

provides either a date or specifies conditions by which FHFA’s control over Fannie Mae will
terminate,” Compl. ¶ 22, is true but beside the point. Whatever might be argued (or speculated)
about the possible duration of the conservatorship, Fannie Mae is not subject to permanent
control by the government, as the conservatorship did not grant FHFA permanent authority to
appoint a majority of Fannie Mae’s directors.
Rather, in HERA, Congress empowered FHFA to act as conservator of Fannie Mae for

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18

purposes of “reorganizing, rehabilitating, or winding up [its] affairs.” 12 U.S.C. § 4617(a)(2).
This naturally limits the Conservator’s authority to a certain resolution—“reorganizing,
rehabilitating, or winding up [Fannie Mae’s] affairs”; it does not grant FHFA permanent
authority. Indeed, “[a]lthough there is no specific termination date, the purpose of the
conservatorship is to restore Fannie Mae to a stable condition.” Herron, 861 F.3d at 169. As a
result, FHFA’s (assumed) control is merely indefinite, not permanent. “Thus, the government’s
indefinite but temporary control does not transform Fannie Mae into a government actor.” Id.
Nor can Plaintiff point to anything inherent in Fannie Mae’s structure as indicative of

19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

permanent government control, as a comparison with Amtrak’s structure in Lebron confirms. In
Lebron, Amtrak’s charter established permanent government control because “six of the
corporation’s eight externally named directors (the ninth is named by a majority of the board
itself) are appointed directly by the President of the United States.” 513 U.S. at 397. By
contrast, Fannie Mae’s charter has no such structure where the government permanently appoints
Fannie Mae’s directors—“The Federal National Mortgage Association shall have a board of
directors, which shall consist of 13 persons . . . who shall be elected annually by the common
stockholders.” 2 12 U.S.C. § 1723(b).
2

In Lebron, the Supreme Court focused solely on the permanent, structural control the government retained under
the provision of Amtrak’s charter that granted the President authority to appoint six of Amtrak’s nine directors.
(Footnote Cont’d on Following Page)

Case 1:17-cv-00042-JJM-LDA Document 25 Filed 12/15/17 Page 9 of 13 PageID #: 503

Additionally, although the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) included the

1
2

Enterprises’ operations in the federal budget and has said that the Enterprises are “effective[ly]”

3

part of the government for CBO’s purposes, Compl. ¶¶ 12-14, the CBO has not said that the

4

existing government control will be permanent, which is the relevant factor in the Lebron

5

analysis. In fact, the CBO has noted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac “are not legally

6

government agencies, and their employees are not civil servants.” Compl., Ex. 2 at 2.
Plaintiff also seems to claim that Fannie Mae is under permanent control because “[e]ven

7
8

if the conservatorship were terminated[,] Fannie Mae will remain subject to the control of the

9

United States Treasury through the senior preferred stock purchase agreement [PSPA], senior

10

preferred stock, and warrant to purchase common stock.” Compl. ¶ 23. But as the Fourth

11

Circuit recently held, “although the government does exert some control . . . through the PSPA

12

with Treasury, that control is temporary . . . . The Supreme Court has long held that, when the

13

government acquires an ownership interest in a corporation, it acts—and is treated—as any other

14

shareholder.” Meridian Invs., Inc., 855 F.3d at 579 (holding that Freddie Mac is not a

15

government actor for statute-of-limitations purposes under 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a)) (citing Lebron,

16

513 U.S. at 398 and Bank of U.S. v. Planters’ Bank of Ga., 22 U.S. 904, 907 (1824)) (emphasis

17

added).

18

Indeed, while the government undoubtedly would have temporally indefinite control over

19

“a private corporation whose stock comes into federal ownership,” that is the precise example

20

the Supreme Court uses to illustrate the absence of permanent government control over the

21

corporation. Lebron, 513 U.S. at 398 (“Amtrak is not merely in the temporary control of the

22

Government (as a private corporation whose stock comes into federal ownership might be)

23

(emphases added).”). Thus, conservatorship does not amount to permanent government control

24
25
26
27
28

(Footnote Cont’d From Previous Page)

Lebron, 513 U.S. at 397. The Court did not deem it significant that the President also had temporary authority, by
virtue of a financial assistance arrangement, to appoint two additional directors; rather, the Court recites that as a
fact but omits it completely from the analysis of whether Amtrak would be deemed a government actor. Id. at 39799. This confirms that only permanent and structural indicia of control are significant to the analysis.

1

and does not impose government-actor status onto Fannie Mae; rather, Fannie Mae retained its

2

pre-conservatorship status as a private actor for purposes of constitutional claims.
Under the Lebron framework, and as numerous courts have held, Fannie Mae is not a

3
4

government actor that can be held liable for constitutional violations. This Court should hold the

5

same.

6

II.

7

THE CONSERVATOR IS NOT A GOVERNMENT ACTOR FOR PURPOSES OF
CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS
Nor can Plaintiff plausibly argue the FHFA, as Fannie Mae’s Conservator, is a

8

government actor for purposes of Plaintiff’s constitutional claim. 3 Federal courts that have

9
addressed the question of whether FHFA, as Conservator, is a federal actor for purposes of
10
constitutional claims have, again, unanimously held that it is not. This is so because HERA
11
provides that the Conservator—by operation of law, upon the inception of conservatorship—
12
succeeds to “all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the regulated entity, and of any
13
stockholder, officer, or director.” 12 U.S.C. § 4617(b)(2)(A)(i). As the D.C. Circuit explains,
14
HERA “evinces Congress’s intention to have the FHFA step into Fannie Mae’s private shoes” and
15
for FHFA to “shed[] its government character,” not vice versa. Herron, 861 F.3d at 169
16
(alteration in original) (citation omitted). Here, when FHFA acts in its capacity as Conservator,
17
it stands in the shoes of Fannie Mae. Plaintiff’s claim against FHFA is effectively a claim
18
against Fannie Mae, which is not a government entity. Thus, acting as Conservator, FHFA is no

longer acting as a government entity for purposes of constitutional claims.

All district courts that have addressed the issue have held the same. See, e.g., Parra v.

Plaintiff sues FHFA in its capacity as Conservator of Fannie Mae, not as Regulator, and offers no allegation that
could support a claim against FHFA as regulator.

of Freddie Mac . . . .); Shamoon, 922 F. Supp. 2d at 645 (“FHFA, as conservator, merely ‘steps

2

into the shoes’ of Freddie Mac, a private corporation.”).
Similarly, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits each applied Lebron to FHFA as Conservator

3
4

and held that because the Conservator assumes the Enterprises’ private status it is not a

5

government actor. In the Fourth Circuit, the court held that “as conservator[, FHFA] steps into

6

Freddie Mac’s shoes, shedding its government character and also becoming a private party.”

7

Meridian Invs., Inc., 855 F.3d at 579 (applying Lebron test in holding that Freddie Mac was not

8

a government actor for statute-of-limitations purposes under 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a)). Similarly,

9

the Ninth Circuit held that conservatorship “places FHFA in the shoes of Fannie Mae and

10

Freddie Mac, and gives the FHFA their rights and duties, not the other way around.” Adams,

11

813 F.3d at 1260-61 (applying Lebron test in holding that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not

12

“officers, employees, or agents of the federal government” for purposes of the False Claims

13

Act). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit in Herron cited to these cases in its ruling. Herron, 861 F.3d at

14

169.

15

Cases involving other federal agencies acting as conservators or receivers confirm the

16

point that they assume the private status of the entity in conservatorship or receivership and do

17

not act as the government. In O’Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, the Supreme Court construed the

18

materially identical language of 12 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(2)(A)(i), which applies to FDIC

19

receiverships, as “indicat[ing] that the FDIC as receiver ‘steps into the shoes’ of the [pre-

20

existing institution], obtaining the rights ‘of th[e] institution’ that existed prior to receivership.”

21

512 U.S. 79, 86 (1994). 4 As Judge Lagueux of this District held, this is because “when the

22

FDIC is acting as a receiver it is performing a function normally accomplished by a private

23

entity rather than a federal agency. As a receiver, the FDIC does not act on behalf of the

24

United States government, and it does not perform any function unique to the federal

25

government. Instead, it acts on behalf of the failed bank in the interest of that bank’s

26
27
28

4

Because their statutory schemes are similar, courts routinely look to FDIC precedent as helpful in interpreting the
legal obligations raised by HERA. See, e.g., Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 605 (D.C. Cir. 2017);
Cty. of Sonoma v. FHFA, 710 F.3d 987, 993 (9th Cir. 2013).

creditors.” Schock v. FDIC, 118 F. Supp. 2d 165, 169-70 (D.R.I. 2000). Accordingly, the

2

appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver of a financial institution means the FDIC

3

assumes that entity’s private status. See, e.g., Ameristar Fin. Servicing Co. LLC v. United

4

States, 75 Fed. Cl. 807, 812 (2007) (dismissing claim because the FDIC as conservator “was

5

not acting as the United States”); see also United States v. Beszborn, 21 F.3d 62, 68 (5th Cir.

6

1994) (When acting “[i]n its capacity as receiver, the [Resolution Trust Corporation] stands as

7

a private, non-governmental entity, and is not the Government for purpose of the Double

8

Jeopardy Clause.”).

9

Because FHFA as Conservator does not act as the United States for constitutional

10

claims, the Court should enter judgment against Plaintiff.

11

CONCLUSION

12

For the reasons set forth herein, Fannie Mae and FHFA respectfully request that the

13

Court grant their motion for judgment on the pleadings and enter judgment in their favor.
