Case No. 5:12-cv-299 RS-EMT

PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS

COMES NOW, Plaintiffs, and response to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, as
follows:
1.

"We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under
12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as
true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff." Hill v.
White, 321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003) M.T.V. v. Dekalb County School
Dist., 446 F.3d 1153 (11th Cir., 2006)

The amended complaint does allege

exhaustion or futility and there is a final order attached to the amended complaint
which dismisses the claims raised. Attached to this response is Plaintiffs’
Amended Due Process Request that includes the facts and the claims JCSB denies
have been exhausted.
2.

JCSB’s argument that Plaintiff’s Count I for Injunctive Relief, and Count II for
Declaratory Relief must be dismissed because of failure to exhaust disregards

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 2 of 41

both the law and the facts.

The relevant Individuals with Disabilities Education

Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. (“IDEA”) section states that:
(l) Rule of Construction. Nothing in this title shall be construed to restrict or limit
the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [42 USC § 12101] title V of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, [29 USC § 790] or other Federal laws protecting the
rights of children with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action
under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this part, the
procedures under subsections (f) and (g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as
would be required had the action been brought under this part. Emphasis added.
While Plaintiffs’ amended due process request does not specifically ask
for either injunctive or declaratory relief, it does ask the ALJ to consider the facts
that underlie Plaintiffs’ request for that relief.
Neither injunctive nor declaratory relief is available in an administrative
hearing. The ALJ in dismissing the claims in the final order appealed in this case
said: “Thus, since the Division does not have injunctive authority, the only
remedies for a stay-put IEP, which no longer meets the educational needs of the
child, is for the parties to either agree to a change in placement or for one party to
seek a preliminary injunction. Wagner, supra.” [Final Order DOAH 12-1273E,
p.6-71]

The ALJ on page 7 of that order cited MP v. Leon County School Board in DOAH 04517 for the proposition that “a school was under no obligation to amend or review an IEP that
was the subject of such litigation because when stay-put is in effect”. The federal judge granted
the student a preliminary injunction when the DOAH determination (dismissal for lack of
jurisdiction to grant injunction, same as this case) was appealed, in MP2004 v. Leon County
School Board, et al, NDFL Case 04-c-69-SPM, saying that, “...Nothing in the terms of the stayput provision requires the District to keep MP frozen in his 2002 IEP. Under its plain terms, the
stay-put provision allows a school district or the state, with the consent of the parents, to make
changes to MP’s IEP....” p.6 “...Given the limited progress MP made under previous IEPs in the
District, the passage of time since the 2002 IEP [this was April 2004] and the progress MP has
Page 2 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 3 of 41

The Declaratory Relief requested concerns the First Amendment rights
under the U.S. Constitution, and a Florida Statute which JCSB uses to deny
Plaintiffs’ IEP meetings, and make it harder for MOTHER to prove her claims in
court, and to obstruct her ability to petition government for redress. But the First
Amendment rights that Plaintiffs’ seek declaratory relief for go beyond
interaction that is required by IDEA or other statutes designed to protect students
with disabilities: Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the First Amendment allows
them to record school district officials, employees and agents in the course of
their performance of their public duties without their consent. It is relief
concerning a district policy refusing to allow recording by parents. That is not
relief offered under IDEA, and therefore is explicitly excluded from exhaustion.
Plaintiffs did raise the issue of whether the policy of refusing to allow Plaintiff to
record was retaliatory under Section 504 in their amended due process complaint,
paragraphs 29-32, and Issue 4.
The Eleventh Circuit has said that “[t]he exhaustion of ... remedies is not
required where resort to administrative remedies would be (1) futile or (2)
inadequate." M.T.V. v. Dekalb County School Dist., 446 F.3d 1153, 1159 (11th
Cir., 2006) The Southern District of Florida determined that when the parent had
alleged a blanket policy, it would be futile to require individual administrative

made since then, the 2002 IEP at this point in time does not appear reasonably calculated to
provide educational benefit to MP.... [at the same time the court noted it was not expressing an
opinion on whether it provided educational benefit in 2002.] p. 8
Page 3 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 4 of 41

determinations that could be different. L.M.P. ex rel. E.P. v. School Bd., 516
F.Supp.2d 1294, 1305 (S.D. Fla., 2007)
None of the Eleventh Circuit key reasons for requiring exhaustion apply to
declaratory actions. “Key reasons for requiring the exhaustion of administrative
remedies are as follows: 1) to permit the exercise of agency discretion and
expertise on issues requiring these characteristics; 2) to allow the full
development of technical issues and a factual record prior to court review; 3) to
prevent deliberate disregard and circumvention of agency procedures established
by Congress; and 4) to avoid unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency
the first opportunity to correct any error. (Internal citation omitted.)... The
exhaustion requirement, however, is not jurisdictional and therefore " 'is not to be
applied inflexibly.' " (Internal citations omitted.) N.B. by D.G. v. Alachua County
School Bd., 84 F.3d 1376, 1378-9 (C.A.11 (Fla.), 1996)
3.

JCSB’s argument that Count III for Denial of FAPE Under IDEA, Count IV for
Section 504 Discrimination, Count V for Retaliation Under IDEA and Section
504 have not been exhausted, simply denies the facts2. The Count III-V claims in
this case were specifically raised in a amended due process request Plaintiffs filed
under IDEA on April 16, 2012 (see attached amended due process complaint,
page 1), and were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in the Final Order appealed in

2

It may also be moot, but plaintiffs’ counsel has not had sufficient time to review the 191
page final order that the ALJ issued in DOAH 10-10485E on December 29, 2012.
Page 4 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 5 of 41

this case (attached). How JCSB fails to acknowledge this in its Motion to
Dismiss is puzzling.
It is true that the ALJ’s final order on the claims in the second due process
case, dating after June 7, 2011 in DOAH 12-1273E does not specifically
determine Plaintiffs’ the second due process retaliation or discrimination claims:
the ALJ said the claims were all wrapped up in the one meeting (which Plaintiffs
dispute). Plaintiffs’ counsel memory is unsure whether that was because the ALJ
orally dismissed them in the hearing which Plaintiffs was required to pay for court
reporting for, and which has not been transcribed because Plaintiffs are indigent;
or whether it is simply because the ALJ has already said in the earlier first due
process case that she has no jurisdiction over Section 504 or ADA claims. (See
dismissal in first due process case, attached.) But that doesn’t change the fact
that the issues were raised and the facts were alleged (to the level required in a
due process request, which has minimum pleading requirements).

Plaintiffs

cannot be penalized if DOAH dismisses the claims they brought. (See related
discussion McNeal v. Duval County School Board, 58 IDELR 7, 111 LRP 73952
(MDFL 2011).
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act anticipates that a
student’s needs would change over time. What might be free appropriate
education at one point, may absolutely not be at a different point. That is why
Congress requires that the student’s Individual Education Program be updated “at
least annually”:

Page 5 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 6 of 41

1414(d)(4) Review and Revision of IEP. (A) In General. The local educational
agency shall ensure that, subject to subparagraph (B), the IEP Team– (i) reviews
the child’s IEP periodically, but not less frequently than annually to determine
whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved; and (ii) revises the IEP
as appropriate to address– (I) any lack of expected progress toward the annual
goals and in the general education curriculum, where appropriate; (II) the results
of any reevaluation conducted under this section; (III) information about the child
provided to, or by, the parents, as described in subsection (c)(1)(B); (IV) the
child’s anticipated needs; or (V) other matters. 20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(4)(See also:
“(2) At the beginning of each school year, each local educational agency, State
educational agency, or other State agency, as the case may be, shall have in effect,
for each child with a disability in theagency’s jurisdiction, an individualized
education program, as defined in paragraph (1)(A). 20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(2)
Congress also gave explicit permission that claims did not have to be all
raised at one time: “Separate Complaint. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to preclude a parent from filing a separate due process complaint on an
issue separate from a due process complaint already filed.” 20 U.S.C. 1415(o)
JCSB argues that the First Due Process must be finished before the court
considers later claims, as though any decision in that case is dispositive for the
new claims raised in this one. That due process was filed in November 2010.
The ALJ explicitly refused to consider even evidence that occurred after the date
of filing except as to the student’s progress: she surely refused to consider new
claims arising after November 2010 filing. The claims in this case (and the
appealed due process hearing which began April 6, 2012) began on June 7, 2011,
and continue today. JCSB misrepresent that it is the November 2010 claims that
are being considered in this case, or relevant to this case.

Further, Plaintiffs

consented to only a single one week delay to that first hearing, and three days
delay when Plaintiffs’ counsel was unable to attend scheduled hearing dates due

Page 6 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 7 of 41

to illness or unexpected travel emergencies. Yet the hearing was not complete
until April 2012, and the transcript was not filed until July 2012. In Radcliffe v.
School Bd. of Hillsborough County, 38 F.Supp.2d 994 (M.D. Fla., 1999), the
Middle District of Florida cited the Second Circuit: "[i]f state administrative
bodies persistently fail to render expeditious decisions as to a child's educational
placement, district courts have the power under § 1415(e)(2) to assume
jurisdiction over the review process on the grounds that exhaustion would be
futile or inadequate." Frutiger v. Hamilton Cent. Sch. Dist., 928 F.2d 68, 74 (2d
Cir.1991) That would make JCSB’ argument that Plaintiffs had failed to exhaust
as required plainly wrong, even if a court were to mistakenly conclude that (a)
there is a requirement to wait beyond the 45 statutory deadline for the Division of
Administrative Hearing to issue a final order, or (b) that Plaintiff’s first due
process is dispositive or even relevant to their claims that arose at least six months
after the ones in that case.
JCSB mentions in its motion that it brought a claim (that has been unclear
to Plaintiffs since it was raised) about the recording issue. Plaintiffs found it very
strange that after successfully urging the ALJ to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims about
retaliation that included denying MOTHER permission to record meetings after
she engaged in protected activities, that she was permitted to record before having
done so; and without ever having adopted any rule prohibiting recording; JCSB
filed a due process claim against Plaintiffs apparently seeking DOAH’s approval
for its refusal to hold statutory meetings under IDEA if Mother recorded, and

Page 7 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 8 of 41

refusal to allow her to record, in the third due process (DOAH 12-2562E). It
made no sense since how can an ALJ determine whether free appropriate public
education has been denied, or IDEA procedures have been violated by the
recording, when JCSB did not identify any specific instances in its complaint. In
a un-transcribed hearing, the ALJ did inform JCSB that she did not believe that
Individual Education Program meetings held pursuant to IDEA could be
considered private meetings [in which individuals had any reasonable expectation
of privacy which is required for Section 934.02-03, Fla. Stat. to apply].
But, be that as it may, the statutory 45 day period for filing the final order
has long since expired. More importantly, there is no statute that gives DOAH
jurisdiction to declare the rights of citizens under the First Amendment, which is
what Plaintiffs are asking this court to do. The most DOAH could do is find that
JCSB does not have to have any lawfully enacted policy and can deny MOTHER
(and others) recording privileges without having one and without standards, and
that it doesn’t violate IDEA by doing so generally. Therefore, waiting for the
ALJ would be futile, and wholly inadequate to the declaratory action Plaintiffs
have brought here, in any case.

The All Writs Act (“AWA”), 28 U.S.C. §1615 was enacted in 1911 and states:
“[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by act of Congress may issue all
writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and
agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” It does not limit the court’s writ

Page 8 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 9 of 41

jurisdiction to federal officers. This court has jurisdiction to require JCSB to
perform its statutory duty under 20 U.S.C. 1415 to provide the transcript of due
process hearings, including all mandatory discussions with the judge. “Fed. R.
Civ. P. 81(b) largely abolished common law writs of mandamus in federal civil
proceedings. However, federal courts may still issue writs of mandamus under the
All Writs Act so long as the writ is “‘in aid of their respective jurisdictions and
agreeable to the usages and principles of law.’” The Florida Bar Journal, June,
2011 Volume 85, No. 6, p.89

Plaintiffs are asking the court to exercise its

common law writ jurisdiction in issuing the writ to JCSB. But if not Plaintiffs
seek an order requiring JCSB to provide the transcript required by IDEA.
JCSB’s argument that Count VI claim for Writ of Mandamus fails because
bringing it in an IDEA hearing at the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings
would be futile. DOAH has no extraordinary writ jurisdiction, and it the ALJ in
the underlying case has already refused to order JCSB to provide the electronic
transcript which IDEA requires.
JCSB’s argument that the claim for Writ of Mandamus fails because its
obligation to provide the transcript is not settled, turns on whether the plain
language of the statute (and its intent to give parent a full record that can be
reviewed by a court) means what it says. It is standard jurisprudence (the DOAH
rule saying that no reporting of preliminary hearings is required) that mandatory
hearings in which arguments and critical decisions are made that may not make it
into written documents are part of the complete record. This court is not bound

Page 9 of 10

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 10 of 41

by the interpretation of federal law that any ALJ has made (though Plaintiffs have
attached two ALJ rulings on this issue in two of the due process cases involving
the same parties, for the court’s information).

For all of the above reasons, JCSB’s Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, or
for failure to exhaust on all counts must be denied.

FINAL ORDER OF DISMISSAL
On April 26, 2012, Respondent, Jackson County School Board
(JCSB), filed a Motion to Dismiss Amended Verified Request for
Impartial Due Process Hearing.

After several extensions,

Petitioner, on May 24, 2012, filed a response.

On May 29, 2012,

Respondent requested a hearing on its Motion to Dismiss.
Thereafter, Petitioner objected to scheduling such a hearing.
After review of the pleadings, and record in this matter,
Respondent’s Motion for Hearing on its Motion to Dismiss was
denied since the record on the issue of stay-put is complete and
needs no further evidence.

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE

The issue in this proceeding is whether the stay-put
provisions of 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j) are in effect regarding
Petitioner’s IEP.
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
On April 6, 2012, Respondent JCSB received a Verified
Request for Impartial Due Process Hearing from the attorney for
Petitioner.

The request was forwarded to the Division of

Administrative Hearings (DOAH).

Later on April 16, 2012,

Petitioner filed an Amended Verified Request for Impartial Due
Process Hearing.

Petitioner’s request for due process is wholly

based on the JCSB’s failure to hold an IEP meeting.

After a pre-

hearing conference with all of the parties, a Notice of Hearing,
scheduling the due process hearing for June 18, 2012, in
Marianna, Florida, was entered.
As indicated, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss
Petitioner’s due process hearing request.

The motion was based

on the fact that Petitioner has a pending due process case before

2

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 19 of 41

the Division of Administrative Hearings and that the automatic
stay provisions (stay-put) regarding Petitioner’s Individualized
Education Plan (IEP) provided in 20 U.S.C. section 1415(j) are in
effect.

Indeed, in this case, there is no dispute that the

parties to this action attempted to schedule an IEP meeting and
failed, albeit the reason for that failure is in dispute.
However, such reason is immaterial to the issue of stay-put
and whether an administrative remedy can be utilized to impose
injunctive relief to lift the automatic stay imposed by section
1415(j).
Section 1415(j) provides as follows:
. . . during the pendency of any proceedings
conducted pursuant to this section, unless
the State or local educational agency and the
parents otherwise agree, the child shall
remain in the then-current educational
placement of such child, or, if applying for
initial admission to a public school, shall,
with the consent of the parents, be placed in
the public school program until all such
proceedings have been completed.
Under this section, school districts may have the obligation
to attempt to review and propose revisions to a child's IEP
during the course of litigation.1/

However, they do not have the

authority to make unilateral changes to such placement.

See

Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 323 (1988) and Town of Burlington v.
Dept. of Educ. for the Cmmw. of Mass., 736 F.2d 773, 797 (1st
Cir. 1984) (Burlington II).

3

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 20 of 41

Burlington II involved an IEP that was found to not provide
FAPE by a state administrative judge and private school funding
was ordered.

The school district then appealed the decision to

federal district court.

The district court, after an evidentiary

hearing, found the contested IEP provided a free appropriate
education (FAPE) and ordered reimbursement to the district for
the money it had expended for the private school.

Importantly,

for purposes of this case, the district court took additional
evidence regarding the appropriate educational placement of the
subject student for the years which had passed during the
litigation of the case, but for which IEPs had not been prepared
and had not been the subject of review at the state
administrative level.
By the time Burlington II occurred, all of the parties
agreed that the original contested IEP did not provide FAPE, but
disagreed over which school, public or private, could provide
FAPE.

After an in-depth review of the IDEA, the First Circuit

Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and
remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing,
including an evidentiary hearing on the issues developed during
the intervening years.

On the issue of placement for years after

the contested IEP for which no IEPs had been completed and no
state administrative review had occurred, the First Circuit,
while noting that the IDEA, in its opinion, did not address the
4

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 21 of 41

issue of whether IEPs are to be revised during the pendency of
federal review and ignoring the practical effects of the
mandatory stay-put requirements of the IDEA, developed a judicial
rule that IDEA required schools to continue to develop IEPs while
litigation was pending, with such IEPs perhaps being reviewed at
the state administrative level.

The court felt that such a

policy would, among other purposes, assist in promoting
settlements.

Id.

The First Circuit viewed the mandatory annual

review of the IEP as an ongoing obligation of a school even while
litigation is pending.

The Court reiterated this principle when

it stated that school districts cannot avoid their IDEA duties by
not reviewing a child's IEP during "stay-put," as holding
otherwise would reward school districts for "misfeasance or
nonfeasance in providing appropriate education services" during a
"stay-put" placement.

Indeed, the Burlington II court viewed the

mandatory language of subsection 1415(j) more as a guideline when
the issue was reimbursement for a unilateral change in placement
prior to the end of litigation.

See Maine Sch. Admin. Dist. No.

35 v. Mr. and Mrs. R., 321 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 2003); MM ex rel.
DM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 303 F.3d 523, 536 (4th
Cir. 2002); Amann v. Stow Sch. Sys., 982 F.2d 644, 651 (1st Cir.
1992); Anderson v. Dist. Of Columbia, 877 F.2d 1018, 1023 (D.C.
Cir. 1989).

Significantly, however, even without such state

administrative review, the First Circuit also recognized and
5

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 22 of 41

approved the authority of the district court to hear and take
evidence on these later years under its power to grant
appropriate relief incident to its determination of the contested
IEP for the initial year.

Id. at 396.

Of importance is the fact

that the hearing being discussed in Burlington II and Anderson
was an evidentiary hearing before a district court with
injunctive powers.

Of greater significance is that the

Burlington II court did not address whether administrative
tribunals have the authority to issue injunctive relief and force
the development of an IEP or alter the IEP without IEP team
input.
As noted, the language of section 1415(j) is automatic and
prevents any change to Petitioner's earlier placement.

In Wagner

v. Board of Education of Montgomery County, 335 F.3d 297 (4th
Cir. 2003), the Fourth Circuit ruled that the district court
erred when it ordered the school board to offer an alternative
placement when the stay-put placement became unavailable without
utilizing traditional preliminary injunction criteria.
The Fourth Circuit found that section 1415(j) was
prohibitive in nature and did not impose any affirmative
obligations on the school board to seek an alternative placement.
Thus, since the Division does not have injunctive authority, the
only remedies for a stay-put IEP, which no longer meets the
educational needs of the child, is for the parties to either
6

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 23 of 41

agree to a change in placement or for one party to seek a
preliminary injunction.

Wagner, supra.

The issue was similarly addressed in Kuszewski v. Chippewa
Valley Schools, 131 F. Supp. 2d 926 (E.D. Mich. 2001).

The

federal district court held that because of the mandatory stayput provisions of the IDEA, a school was under no obligation to
amend or review an IEP that was the subject of such litigation
because when stay-put is in effect, the school district is
powerless to alter a child's IEP without the explicit agreement
of the parents.

1151, 1155-56 (11th Cir. 2007); Digre v. Roseville Sch.
Independent Dist. No. 623, 841 F.2d 245 (8th Cir. 1988); and

2002); See also M.P. v. Leon Cnty. Sch. Bd., DOAH Case No. 040517E (DOAH Mar. 30, 2004) and K.G. v. Santa Rosa Cnty. Sch. Bd.,
DOAH Case No. 04-1588E (DOAH Aug. 31, 2004).
As stated earlier, the parties' attempts to hold an IEP
meeting have failed.

The decision in the earlier case has not

yet been rendered and the stay-put provisions of section 1415(j)
are in effect.

Additionally, the issues raised in this case are

wholly based on the failure of the parties to meet in an IEP
meeting and develop a new IEP for A.L.2/

However, this

administrative tribunal has no authority to dissolve the stay-put
injunction and require the development of a new IEP.

Therefore, because of the automatic stay, this

action should be dismissed.

The Petitioner did raise an issue of FAPE based on JCSB's
refusal to permit the parent to record all meetings with JCSB
regarding Petitioner. The parent has, in part, based continued
refusal to participate in an IEP meeting on this inability to
record such a meeting due to some of the staff's refusal to grant
permission to record them during meetings with the parent.
However, the issue of recordation is based on the application of
chapter 934, Florida Statutes, and specifically section 934.03
which makes it a crime to intercept certain oral communications
without the permission of all the participants to that
communication. Resolution of this issue would involve injunctive
relief and can only be addressed by the civil courts. IDEA
simply cannot address issues involving the application of
criminal statutes and an individual's right to privacy as
determined by the Florida Legislature in the educational arena.

Case No. 10-10485E

ORDER DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION TO COMPEL
On April 18, 2011, Petitioner filed a Motion to Compel that
seeks to require Respondents to provide a court reporter for all
hearings in this matter. Petitioner's motion is premised upon
20 U.S.C. § 1415(h), which provides, in relevant part:
(h) Safeguards. Any party to a hearing
conducted pursuant to subsection (f) or (k),
or an appeal conducted pursuant to
subsection (g), shall be accorded-(1) the right to be accompanied and
advised by counsel and by individuals with
special knowledge or training with respect
to the problems of children with
disabilities;
(2) the right to present evidence and
confront, cross-examine, and compel the
attendance of witnesses;
(3) the right to a written, or, at the
option of the parents, electronic verbatim
record of such hearing. . . (Emphasis added)

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 28 of 41

Florida Administrative Code Rule 6A-6.03311(9) provides the
corresponding Florida statement of due process hearing rights as
follows, in relevant part:
(v)

An ALJ shall use the provisions of Rules
6A-6.03011 through 6A-6.0361, F.A.C., for
conducting due process hearings and shall
conduct such hearings in accordance with the
Uniform Rules for Administrative
Proceedings, Chapter 28-106, F.A.C. Minimum
procedures for due process hearings shall
include the following:
1. Hearing rights. Any party to a due
process hearing has the right:
a. To be represented by counsel or to be
represented by a qualified representative
under the qualifications and standards set
forth in Rules 28-106.106 and 28-106.107,
F.A.C., or to be accompanied and advised by
individuals with special knowledge or
training with respect to the problems of
students with disabilities, or any
combination of the above;
b. To present evidence, and to confront,
cross-examine, and compel the attendance of
witnesses;
c. To prohibit the introduction of any
evidence at the hearing that has not been
disclosed to that party at least five (5)
business days before the hearing;
d. To obtain written, or, at the option of
the parents, electronic verbatim record of
the hearing at no cost to the parents; and
e. To obtain written, or, at the option of
the parents, electronic findings of fact and
decisions at no cost to the parents....
(Emphasis added)

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 29 of 41

At the motion hearing held on May 5, 2011, it was apparent
that there is no dispute that Respondent Jackson County School
Board is responsible for ensuring that a written or electronic
verbatim record of the final evidentiary hearing is made
available to Petitioner at no cost to Petitioner. There is also
no dispute as to any party's right to bring a court reporter, at
its own expense, to preliminary hearings. The parties disagree,
however, as to Petitioner's contention that the Jackson County
School Board should be required to pay for a court reporter to
attend and transcribe all preliminary hearings.
Petitioner frankly concedes that there is no case law
directly on point, but argues that prehearing conferences and
motion hearings are essential parts of the due process hearing.
The purpose of the "verbatim record" requirement is to ensure
that there is a complete record of the proceeding. Important
rulings are made during preliminary hearings, and the absence of
a transcript could jeopardize the ability to appeal such
rulings. See Huffman v. Carr, 880 So. 2d 818 (Fla. 1st DCA
2004) ("We must affirm the final judgment in this case, because
we have not been supplied with a transcript of the pretrial
conference. In the absence of a record, we have no way of
knowing whether Mr. Huffman objected to the lack of proper
notice on any issue he did not intend to concede.")
The cases cited by Petitioner establish Petitioner's right
to have a court reporter at the preliminary hearings, but not
the right to have the Jackson County School Board pay for the
court reporter. The undersigned's independent research found
only one case that references the possibility of a parent's
right to have a motion hearing recorded at school board expense.
In Amann v. Stow School System, 982 F.2d 644, 652-653 (1st Cir.
1992), the court stated the following in its review of a claim
under the predecessor to § 1415(h)(3):
[T]he BSEA [Massachusetts Bureau of Special
Education Appeals] committed at worst a
harmless error by failing to give the Amanns
a transcript of a hearing held on
December 7, 1990, at which the BSEA heard
the Amanns' request to re-open the
proceedings. The hearing was recorded but
the BSEA apparently lost the tape. The lack
of a transcript may have violated the IDEA,
see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(d)(3) (party to agency
hearing has "right to a written or
electronic verbatim record of such

3

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 30 of 41

hearing"), but, because the hearing officer
spelled out in writing her reasons for
denying the request to re-open, and because
we have found that she was within her
discretion to make the denial, the BSEA's
procedural negligence caused no substantive
injury.
On one hand, it could be argued that the Annan court
presumed that the parents had the right to have the agency
record their motion hearing, else there would have been no
conclusion that the agency's loss of the tape was "harmless
error" under the circumstances. (Annan predated the requirement
that the method of creating the verbatim record is at the
parents' option.) On the other hand, it could be as cogently
argued that the "harmless error" in Annan followed only from the
agency's botching of its voluntary undertaking to record the
motion hearing.
In any event, it is concluded that Annan is insufficient to
justify a broad departure from the common understanding of the
undefined term "due process hearing" as the evidentiary hearing
that forms the basis of the findings of fact in the ALJ's final
order. The context of 20 U.S.C. § 1415 points to the impartial
due process hearing as a single point in time, with various
events leading up to that point and consequences following from
it. As to the Florida law aspects of the meaning of "due
process hearing," it should be noted that Florida Administrative
Code Rule 6A-6.03311(9)(v) provides that due process hearings
are to be conducted in accordance with Florida Administrative
Code Chapter 28-106. Florida Administrative Code Rule 28106.214(1) states that the agency is responsible for "preserving
the testimony at final hearings." This responsibility is
consistent with the language of 20 U.S.C. § 1415(h)(3) and
Florida Administrative Code Rule 6A-6.03311(9)(v)1.d.
Based on the foregoing, it is
ORDERED that Petitioner's Motion to Compel is DENIED.

ORDER DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION TO REQUIRE RESPONDENT TO

OF TELEPHONE CONFERENCE AND ALL HEARINGS
On May 3, 2012, Petitioner filed a Motion to Require
Respondent to Provide Court Reporting and Verbatim Transcripts
of Telephone Conference and All Hearings wherein Petitioner
seeks to require Respondent to provide a court reporter for all
hearings in this matter. Petitioner’s motion is premised upon
20 U.S.C. § 1415(h), which provides, in relevant part:
(h) Safeguards. Any party to a hearing
conducted pursuant to subsection (f) or (k),
or an appeal conducted pursuant to

Florida Administrative Code Rule 6A-6.03311(9) provides
that the corresponding Florida statement of due process hearing
rights as follows, in pertinent part:
(v) An ALJ shall use the provisions of
Rules 6A-6.03011 through 6A-6.0361, F.A.C.,
for conducting due process hearings and
shall conduct such hearings in accordance
with the Uniform Rules for Administrative
Proceedings, Chapter 28-106, F.A.C. Minimum
procedures for due process shall include the
following:
1. Hearing rights. Any party to a due
process hearing has the right:
a. To be represented by counsel or to be

under the qualifications and standards set
forth in Rules 28-106.106 and 28-106.107,
F.A.C., or to be accompanied and advised by

b. To present evidence, and to confront,

the hearing at no cost to the parents; and
e. To obtain written, or, at the option of
the parents, electronic findings of fact and

(Emphasis added).
Under IDEA, it is clear that Respondent Jackson County
School Board is responsible for ensuring that a written or
2

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 35 of 41

electronic verbatim record of the final evidentiary hearing is
made available to Petitioner at no cost to Petitioner. However,
the issue here is whether the Jackson County School Board should
be required to pay for a court reporter to attend and transcribe
all preliminary or motion hearings.
Petitioner argues that prehearing conferences and motion
hearings are essential parts of the due process hearing.
Further, she argues that the purpose of the “verbatim record”
requirement is to ensure that there is a complete record of the
proceeding. Important rulings are made during preliminary
hearings, and the absence of a transcript could jeopardize the
ability to appeal such rulings. See Huffman v. Carr, 880 So. 2d
818 (Fla. 1st DCA 2004) (“We must affirm the final judgment in
this case, because we have not been supplied with a transcript
of the pretrial conference. In the absence of a record, we have
no way of knowing whether Mr. Huffman objected to the lack of
proper notice on any issue he did not intend to concede.”).
However, the cases cited by the Petitioner in the motion
only establish Petitioner’s right to have a court reporter at
preliminary hearings. The cases do not establish the right to
have Jackson County School Board pay for the court reporter.
There is only one judicial case which references the possibility
of a parent’s right to have a motion hearing recorded at school
board expense. In Amann v. Stow School System, 982 F.2d 644,
652-653 (1st Cir. 1992), the court stated the following in its
review of a claim under the predecessor to § 1415(h)(3):
[T]he BSEA [Massachusetts Bureau of Special

see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(d)(3) (party to agency

spelled out in her writing her reasons for
denying the request to re-open, and because
we have found that she was within her

3

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 36 of 41

procedural negligence caused no substantive
injury.
Importantly, Amann predated the requirement that the method
of creating the verbatim record is at the parents’ option.
Given that, the Amann court presumed that the parents had the
right to have the agency tape record their motion hearing, else
there would have been no conclusion that the agency’s loss of
the tape was “harmless error” under the circumstances. However,
it is unclear that the “harmless error” in Amann resulted from
the agency’s botching of its voluntary undertaking to record the
motion hearing or the parents’ right to such a recording. The
case did not address the issue of whether a court reporter was
required to preserve the record of a motion hearing or who
should pay for a court reporter.
However, the language of 20 U.S.C. § 1415 points to the
impartial due process hearing as a single point in time, with
various events leading up to that point and consequences
following from it. Given that language, Amann is insufficient
to justify a broad departure from the common understanding of
the undefined term “due process hearing” as the evidentiary

Case No. 10-10485E

ORDER
On April 7, 2011, Respondent Jackson County School Board
("School Board") filed a Motion to Strike suggesting that
certain allegations in the Verified Amended Request for
Impartial Due Process Hearing ("Petition") were either
inappropriate in the IDEA context or were time barred. At the
May 5, 2011, motion hearing, the School Board agreed to submit
an amended motion that more specifically delineated the items in
the Petition to which the School Board objected as well as the
reasons for the objections. On May 13, 2011, the School Board
filed an Amended Motion to Strike that set forth the School
Board's specific objections.
This order partially grants the School Board's Amended
Motion to Strike. The specific items stricken from the Petition
are set forth below. The parties should note that the items
stricken are those that the undersigned considered to be
unarguably beyond the scope of this hearing. Other items were
not stricken because the undersigned determined that Petitioner
should be given the opportunity to prove the factual allegations
made and tie them to the IDEA.
The page and paragraph references are to the Petition. As
to the Petition generally, it should be understood that the
Order Dismissing Individual Respondents issued on May 6, 2011,
disposed of all the allegations lodged against individual
Respondents by the Petition. As to the specific remedies
requested on pages 31 through 37, it should be understood that
the only remedies available in this proceeding are those
provided by the IDEA.

Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 28 Filed 01/09/13 Page 39 of 41

Page 2: The School Board's motion to strike the third
through tenth paragraphs of the Preliminary Statement is GRANTED
to the extent that Petitioner requests immediate equitable
relief beyond the powers of the this tribunal under the IDEA.
It is noted that it is the relief request that is stricken, not
the underlying factual allegations contained in these
paragraphs.
Page 3: The School Board's motion to strike the "from
2007" language in paragraph H is GRANTED. This should be
understood to apply to each instance in which the Petition makes
allegations regarding events more than two years before the
filing of the original Petition on November 24, 2010.
Petitioner's evidentiary presentation at the hearing may include
the period preceding two years before November 24, 2010, but the
relief sought is limited to that two year period.
Page 5: The School Board's motion to strike paragraphs DD
and EE is GRANTED insofar as they specifically seek relief under
statutes other than the IDEA. Petitioner will not be barred
from attempting to make a claim under the IDEA based on the
facts alleged in these paragraphs.
Page 8: The School Board's motion to strike paragraph AAA
is GRANTED because discrimination against the child's mother is
not an IDEA issue. The School Board's motion to strike
paragraphs BBB, CCC, DDD, and FFF is GRANTED because this is not
a rule challenge proceeding. Petitioner will not be barred from
attempting to make a claim under the IDEA based on the facts
alleged in these three paragraphs.
Page 28: The School Board's motion to strike paragraph 51
is GRANTED. The School Board's provision of records to the
child's mother is not an issue under the IDEA. The School
Board's motion to strike paragraph 60 is GRANTED insofar as it
is framed as a discrimination claim rather than an IDEA claim.
Petitioner will not be barred from attempting to make a claim
under the IDEA based on the facts alleged in paragraph 60.
Page 29: The School Board's motion to strike paragraph 62
is GRANTED insofar as it is framed as a discrimination claim
rather than an IDEA claim. Petitioner will not be barred from
attempting to make a claim under the IDEA based on the facts
alleged in paragraph 62.

Page 30: The School Board's motion to strike paragraph 63
is GRANTED insofar as it is framed as a retaliation claim rather
than an IDEA claim. Petitioner will not be barred from
attempting to make a claim under the IDEA based on the facts
alleged in paragraph 63. The School Board's motion to strike
paragraph 64 is GRANTED. Discrimination against the child's
mother is not an issue in this IDEA proceeding. The School
Board's motion to strike paragraph 65 is GRANTED insofar as it
is framed as a retaliation claim rather than an IDEA claim.
Petitioner will not be barred from attempting to make a claim
under the IDEA based on the facts alleged in paragraph 65. The
School Board's motion to strike paragraph 66 is GRANTED.
Retaliation against the child's mother is not an issue in this
IDEA proceeding, though the facts alleged may constitute an IDEA
claim as to the child.
Page 31: As to paragraphs 67, 68, and 69, the School
Board's motion to strike is DENIED without prejudice. On their
face, Petitioner's claims regarding basketball do not appear to
implicate FAPE, but Petitioner will be given an opportunity to
demonstrate that participation in basketball is necessary for
FAPE.
