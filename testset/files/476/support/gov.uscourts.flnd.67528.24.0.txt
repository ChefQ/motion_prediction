undersigned counsel, moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule
12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., and states the following grounds:

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

I. Plaintiffs' Claims in Counts I, Il, II, [V and V of the Complaint Must be

Dismissed as Plaintiffs Have Failed to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ("IDEA" or "Act") sets forth an
extensive framework under which parents can "present complaints with respect to any matter
relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision
of a [FAPE] to [a] child." 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1415(b)(6). Under the IDEA, parents first have the
opportunity for "an impartial due process hearing, which shall be conducted by the State
educational agency or by the local educational agency, as determined by State law or by the State
educational agency." 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1415(f)(1)(A). In Florida, such hearings are conducted by the
Division of Administrative Hearings. 6A-6.03311(9)(u), F.A.C. Only after a decision is made in
such administrative proceeding is an aggrieved party entitled to "bring a civil action with respect
to the complaint presented pursuant to this section, which action may be brought in any State
court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States, without regard to the
amount in controversy." 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1415@(@)(A); see JP. v. Cherokee County Bd. of Ed., 218
Fed.Appx. 911, 913 (11th Cir. 2007)("Once the administrative proceedings are complete, the

IDEA provides that either party may challenge those proceedings in state or federal court.").
Accordingly, as part of its extensive framework, the IDEA requires that a plaintiff must
first exhaust its administrative remedies by filing and completing an administrative proceeding
prior to bringing an action in any State court of competent jurisdiction or district court of the
United States. See 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1415(b)(6), (f), @)(2)(A); ZP., 218 Fed. Appx. at 913. A parent's

failure to exhaust administrative remedies by not requesting and participating in a due process
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 24 Filed 12/26/12 Page 3 of 9

proceeding to completion will result in dismissal of the civil action. See J.P., 218 Fed.Appx. at
913.

Consistent with the unambiguous language set forth in sections 1415(b)(6) and (1), the
Eleventh Circuit has interpreted the IDEA's exhaustion requirement to apply to a "broad
spectrum of claims" including those under the ADA, Section 504, or the First Amendment.
MTV. v. Dekalb County Sch. Dist., 446 F.3d 1153, 1157-1159 (11th Cir. 2006); JP, 218
Fed.Appx. at 913; 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1415(b)(6), (J). Accordingly, any student or parent who desires
relief available under the IDEA must exhaust his remedies pursuant to the IDEA's administrative
scheme, even if he invokes a different statute. AZ7.V., 446 F.3d at 1158 (Thus, whether claims
asserting the rights of disabled children are brought pursuant to the IDEA, the ADA, Section
504, or the Constitution, they must first be exhausted in state administrative proceedings.");
Babicz v. Sch. Bd. of Broward County, 135 F.3d 1420, 1422 n. 10 (11th Cir. 1998), GJ. v.
Muscogee County Sch. Dist., 704 F.Supp.2d 1299, 1311 (M.D. Ga. March 25, 2010). Plaintiffs
may not "avoid the exhaustion requirement simply by asking for relief that administrative
authorities cannot grant." G./,, 704 F.Supp.2d at 1311; NB. v. Alachua County Sch, Bd, 84 F.3d
1376, 1379 (11th Cir, 1996).

On March 15, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a Verified Amended Request for Impartial Due
Process Hearing in DOAH Case No, 10-10485 ("AL I"). Plaintiff's Verified Amended Request
for Impartial Due Process Hearing resulted in an approximately six week administrative hearing
which concluded on April 5, 2012. Despite the conclusion of the final hearing, that matter
remains pending as a final order has not yet been issued by the Administrative Law Judge. See
AL. v. Jackson County Sch. Bd., DOAH Case. No. 10-10485. In that administrative proceeding,

Plaintiffs raised numerous and various issues regarding the provision of FAPE to A.L., including
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 24 Filed 12/26/12 Page 4 of 9

his identification, evaluation, and educational placement. In particular, Plaintiffs challenged
many aspects of A.L.'s education, including the sufficiency of A.L.'s existing June 2010 IEP, the
necessity and content of A.L.'s November 2010 IEP, the implementation of A.L.'s June, 2010
IEP, the consideration and inclusion of Dr. Kytja Voeller's recommendations, the provision of
assistive technology, and A.L.'s performance on standardized testing.

Subsequently, on July 27, 2012, the School Board filed a Petition for Due Process
wherein it sought resolution of issues pertaining to the provision of FAPE to A.L. as a result of
P.L.B. and A.L.'s continued demand to record IEP meetings. The School Board's Petition for
Due Process Hearing was assigned DOAH Case No. 12-002562 ("AL II"). In response to the
School Board's Petition for Due Process, on August 13, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a counterclaim
wherein they asserted claims for retaliation under IDEA and Section 504/ADA. See Jackson
County Sch. Bd. vy. A.L. and P.L.B., DOAH Case. No. 12-002562. The School Board's Petition
for Due Process and Plaintiffs' Counterclaim were heard at a hearing conducted by the same
Administrative Law Judge who conducted the first hearing (DOAH Case No. 10-10485) on
September 10, 2012. Despite the conclusion of the final hearing, that matter remains pending as
a final order has not yet been issued by the Administrative Law Judge. Id.

The issues raised in Counts I through V of Plaintiffs' Complaint are identical to the issues
raised in AL I and AL H. As set forth above, neither AL I nor AL II have concluded as the
Administrative Law Judge has not yet entered a final order in either matter. Because AL I and
AL II are still pending and are not yet completed, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately exhaust
their administrative remedies with regard to all of Plaintiffs' current claims. Additionally,
Plaintiffs' attempts to couch their instant claims as injunctive relief as well as claims under the

First Amendment and Section 504 does not exempt them from the exhaustion requirements set
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 24 Filed 12/26/12 Page 5 of 9

forth in the IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1415(b)(6), (); MT-V., 446 F.3d at 1157-1159; AP., 218
Fed.Appx. at 913; Babicz, 135 F.3d at 1422 n. 10; GJ, 704 F.Supp.2d at 1311; NB, 84 F.3d at
1379. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and Counts |
through V of their Complaint must be dismissed.

II. Plaintiffs' Claims in Count VI of the Complaint Must be Dismissed for

Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can be Granted

Count VI of Plaintiffs' Complaint is a petition for writ of mandamus wherein Plaintiffs
seek an order requiring Defendant to provide a court reporter for a hearing which previously
occurred on May 4, 2012. Compl. { 67-72. Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action for
the issuance of a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1361 for two reasons: (1) Plaintiffs
have failed to plead facts sufficient to show that 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1361 is applicable to the parties or
matter at hand and (2) even assuming arguendo that such provision is applicable, Plaintiffs have
failed to plead all elements required for the issuance of a writ of mandamus by this Court.

Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part that "[t]he writs of
scire facias and mandamus are abolished." Pursuant to this rule, the common law "writ of
mandamus" was abolished. Grinberg v. Swacina, 478 F.Supp.2d 1350, 1355 n. 3 (S.D. Fla.
March 20, 2007). Accordingly, the sole provisions pertaining to writs of mandamus are now
codified in 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1361. /d. This provision provides:

The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in
the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the
United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the
plaintiff.
28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1361. The party seeking mandamus pursuant to this provision has the burden of

demonstrating that its right to the issuance of the writ is "clear and indisputable." Carpenter v.
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 24 Filed 12/26/12 Page 6 of 9

Mohawk Industries, Inc., 541 F.3d 1048, 1055 (11th Cir. 2008). In doing so, a Petitioner must
demonstrate (1) a clear right to the relief sought; (2) that respondents have a clear, non-
discretionary duty to act; and (3) no other remedy is available. Cash v. Barnhard, 327 F.3d
1252, 1257 (11th Cir. 2003). "[M]andamus is an extraordinary remedy which should be utilized
only in the clearest and most compelling of cases." Cash, 327 F.3d at 1257 (11th Cir. 2003),
citing Carter v. Seamans, 411 F.2d 767, 773 (Sth Cir. 1969).

Here, Plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandamus must be dismissed as Plaintiffs have
failed to plead facts sufficient to show that the provisions contained in 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1361 are even
applicable in this matter. In its Complaint, Plaintiffs seek a "writ of mandamus to JCSB
requiring that it transcribe the hearing, and pay the court reporter for recording the hearing."
Compl. 0x00A7 72. As set forth above, 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1361 may be utilized only to compel an officer or
employee of the United States or any agency thereof. By Plaintiffs' own admission, Defendant
School Board is not an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof. See
Compl. | 8. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not entitled to a writ of mandamus against the School
Board and Count VI of Plaintiff's Complaint must be dismissed.

Additionally, Plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandamus must be dismissed as Plaintiffs
have failed to allege the three required elements for issuance of a writ of mandamus. First,
Plaintiffs have failed to allege that they have a clear right to the relief sought. Compl. 0x00A7 67-72.
Although Plaintiffs' cite to 20 U.S.C. 1415(h)(3) as their basis for a right to a court reporter, this
provision falls far short of providing Plaintiffs a "clear right to the relief sought." Compl. 7 67.
This provision is, at best, ambiguous regarding whether the School Board is required to provide a

court reporter for a preliminary hearing and accordingly does not provide anything near "a clear
Case 5:12-cv-00299-RS-EMT Document 24 Filed 12/26/12 Page 7 of 9

right to the relief sought."' In fact, two separate administrative law judges have considered
Plaintiff's request for recording of a non-final hearing, have reviewed the case law, and denied
their request based upon the current law. Second, Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the School
Board has a clear, non-discretionary duty to act or that no other remedy is available. Compl. [J
67-72. Plaintiffs' failure to make such allegations is fatal to their petition for a writ of
mandamus, In addition, Plaintiffs allegations clearly show that their right to a writ of mandamus
is not "clear and indisputable" and that the issue at hand falls far short of the clear and
compelling case required for the issuance of such a writ. See Carpenter, 541 F.3d at 1055; Cash,
327 F.3d at 1257 (11th Cir. 2003), citing Carter v. Seamans, 411 F.2d 767, 773 (Sth Cir. 1969).
Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not entitled to a writ of mandamus against the School Board and
Count VI of Plaintiff's Complaint must be dismissed.
The undersigned counsel has conferred with the Plaintiff in compliance with
N.D.Fla.Loc.R. 7.1(B), The Piaintiff does not agree to the relief requested in this motion.
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant
to Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 26th day of December, 2012.

' Defendant has not wavered from its position that the provisions of 20 U.S.C. 1415(h)(3) clearly provide that the
School Board is not required to provide a court reporter for any proceeding other than a final due process hearing,
Accordingly, Defendant makes its statement as to the ambiguity of this provision solely for the sake of argument.
