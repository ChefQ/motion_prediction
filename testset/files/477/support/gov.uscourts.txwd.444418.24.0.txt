CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:10-cv-650-LY

DEFENDANT SETON HEALTHCARE’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
AGAINST PLAINTIFF ELIZABETH COOPER
Defendant Seton Healthcare d/b/a Seton Medical Center Williamson (“Defendant” or
“Seton”) files this, its Motion for Summary Judgment against all claims asserted by Plaintiff
Elizabeth Cooper, and respectfully shows the Court the following:
SYNOPSIS
Seton is entitled to summary judgment on all claims asserted against it by Plaintiff
Elizabeth Cooper, its former employee. Cooper’s sexual harassment claims under state and
federal law fail because she cannot show that she was subjected to severe or pervasive
harassment, or that Seton had any knowledge that she was contending that she had been
harassed. In addition, Cooper’s retaliation claims fail because she has admitted she was not
forced to resign; there is no evidence of a connection between her alleged protected activity and
any adverse employment action; and she has admitted that Seton had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not promoting her and for suspending her. Furthermore, Cooper’s
attempts to impose vicarious liability on Seton for the alleged assaults of a Seton nurse,
Defendant John Butler, fail as a matter of law because he was not acting in the course or scope of

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 2 of 20

his employment when he allegedly assaulted Cooper, and because there is no evidence Seton
ratified the alleged assault. Finally, Cooper’s various negligence claims against Seton are barred
because Seton is a workers’ compensation subscriber.
SUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE
Seton offers the following evidence in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment:
•

Ex. 1: Excerpts from the deposition of Plaintiff Elizabeth Cooper, with select exhibits
(“Cooper Dep.”);

•

Ex. 2: The affidavit of Cooper’s supervisor, Hue Nguyen,1 with exhibits (“H. Nguyen
Aff.”);

•

Ex. 3: The affidavit of Human Resources Generalist Tracie Thor, with exhibits (“Thor.
Aff.”); and

•

Ex. 4: The affidavit of Seton’s Director of Human Resources Operations, Cheryl
Williams (“Williams Aff.”).
STATEMENT OF FACTS

A.

Background
Seton hired Elizabeth Cooper in April of 2007.

Cooper Dep. 13:18-23.

Cooper

transferred to the medical/surgical unit of Seton Medical Center Williamson (“Seton
Williamson”), the facility where the events giving rise to this lawsuit took place, in January
2009. Cooper Dep. 14:7-14, 38:18-23. Seton Williamson opened in February 2008, and at all
times and without interruption, Seton maintained workers’ compensation insurance coverage for
all employees of this facility. Williams Aff. ¶ 3. During her time at Seton Williamson, Cooper
was a level two clinical assistant (“CA II”). Cooper Dep. 39:8-9. Her responsibilities included
assisting with patient care and taking vital signs, until she switched to the night shift in early
April 2009, at which point she monitored the cardiac monitors fulltime. Cooper Dep. 23:5-15,
1

Hue Nguyen and one of the plaintiffs, Jennifer Nguyen, have the same name but are not related. Seton’s motion
will use the first and surnames for both to avoid confusion.

Page 2

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 3 of 20

39:13-40:1.
Cooper worked on the third floor at Seton Williamson, as did the two other plaintiffs in
this case, Josie Taylor and Jennifer Nguyen, who were also clinical assistants, and the other
defendant, John Butler, a nurse. Cooper Dep. 39:5-7; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶¶ 4-5. Taylor, Cooper,
and Jennifer Nguyen are friends and socialize outside of work. Cooper Dep. 28:23-29:18, 33:39. Cooper and Butler’s schedule only overlapped for less than three months, between January
25, 2009 and April 3, 2009. Cooper Dep. 122:23-123:4; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 7. At all times
relevant to this lawsuit, the clinical manager for the third floor at Seton Williamson was Hue
Nguyen, and she was Cooper’s supervisor. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶¶ 2-5; Cooper Dep. 38:18-25. The
Seton Human Resources Generalist with responsibility for Seton Williamson at all times relevant
to this lawsuit was Tracie Thor. Thor Aff. ¶ 2.
B.

Cooper’s contemporaneous statements to Seton about Butler did not indicate that
she observed or experienced any inappropriate conduct by Butler.
Within the first two months of starting work for Seton, Hue Nguyen completed a “New

Hire Check In” with Cooper, which solicited information about Cooper’s satisfaction with her
job. Cooper Dep. 51:18-20 & Ex. 3; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 6 & Ex. A. Cooper did not indicate that
she had any issues with Butler, and in fact stated on the form that Butler had been especially
helpful to her. Cooper Dep. 53:19-24, 54:15-23; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 6. The form also asked
Cooper to indicate any frustrations that she had experienced with the job, and the only frustration
she mentioned was the patient load. Cooper Dep. 56:7-11; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 6. Moreover,
Cooper stated there was nothing that she would change about the unit, that she did not have any
concerns about the job, and that she “loved” all of the staff, which included Butler. Cooper Dep.
56:19-57:14; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 6. She signed the document and testified that she did so because
she agreed with what it said. Cooper Dep. 52:22-24; H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 6.

Page 3

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 4 of 20

In addition, in April of 2009, Cooper indicated to Seton she had no issues with Butler. At
that time, Seton was investigating Josie Taylor’s claims that Butler had harassed Taylor in April
2009. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 8. As part of that investigation, Hue Nguyen interviewed Cooper. H.
Nguyen Aff. ¶ 8. After the interview, Nguyen typed a statement and emailed it to Cooper for her
to review. Hue Aff. ¶ 8 & Ex. B. Cooper emailed the statement back to Hue Nguyen the next
day and confirmed it was accurate. Hue Aff. ¶ 8 & Ex. B. In her statement, Cooper indicated
that she did not witness any sexual misconduct on the third floor; that she had not been touched
inappropriately by anyone on the third floor; that Butler had hugged her once “in a thankful
way”; and that she did not have any concerns regarding sexual misconduct on the third floor. H.
Nguyen Aff. Ex. B Although Cooper now claims she does not remember sending the email, she
does not deny that she sent it either. Cooper Dep. 65:11-21.
In June 2009, Cooper again indicated to Seton that she did not have any issues with
Butler. At that time, Seton was conducting another investigation into claims by Josie Taylor
involving Butler.

Thor Aff. ¶ 3.

HR Generalist Tracie Thor, who was involved in the

investigation, contacted Cooper to follow up regarding the questions Cooper had been asked in
April. Thor Aff. ¶ 3. Cooper confirmed to Thor that her April statement was accurate and that
she had nothing to add, and Thor noted that on her copy of the statement. Thor Aff. ¶ 3 & Ex A.
Although Cooper now claims that she does not remember what she said to Thor in June, she does
not deny that she affirmed her statement either. Cooper Dep. 66:7-25.
C.

Cooper now claims Butler touched her inappropriately in the spring of 2009.
Notwithstanding the documented statements set forth above, Cooper now claims that

Butler’s inappropriate conduct began when she first started working at Seton Williamson.
Cooper Dep. 41:17-42:5. Specifically, she claims that on her first day at Seton Williamson,

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 4

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 5 of 20

Butler put his hand on her shoulder. Cooper Dep. 43:8-14. She also claims that shortly after she
started at Williamson, on February 7, 2009, he “put his arm around [her] waist and pulled [her]
into the supply closet.” Cooper Dep. 44:24-45:15. He did not touch her in any private area, just
on her hip as he directed her into the supply closet. Cooper Dep. 46:13-18, 123:18-18, 150:8-14.
Butler did not touch her again once they were inside the supply closet; he just talked to her about
drawing blood. Cooper Dep. 150:15-19; 47:13-20. Cooper claims that a week later, on February
14, 2009, she was in the supply closet again and Butler came in and put his arms around her
waist from behind (without touching her breast area). Cooper Dep. 46:19-47:9. She later
clarified that she thought he had squeezed her too tightly but that it only lasted a couple of
seconds. Cooper Dep. 150:20-151:5; 153:3-7. According to Cooper, during this incident, Butler
again talked to her about drawing blood. Cooper Dep. 47:13-20. He also said something about
having to beat her “with a wet noodle.” Cooper Dep. 47:15. Cooper testified that she did not
know what he meant by that but it made her uncomfortable. 50:16-25. Cooper also now claims,
despite the documented statements set forth above, that she reported Butler’s touching to both
Hue Nguyen and Tracie Thor in February 2009. 2 Cooper Dep. 71: 6-25.
Hue Nguyen and Tracie Thor have both testified that Cooper never complained to them
about Butler, and the first they heard of any complaints by Cooper was when they received the
EEOC charge that she filed in the autumn of 2009. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 9; Thor Aff. ¶ 4. Seton’s
harassment policy “strongly urges the reporting of all incidents of discrimination, harassment, or
retaliation, regardless of the offender’s identity or position.” H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 12 & Ex. F. The
policy directs employees who have experienced or observed conduct that they believe is
harassing to report to the conduct to their supervisor or to Human Resources. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶
12 & Ex. F. There is no other evidence in the record of any complaints by Cooper.
2

Notably, Cooper testified that she never witnessed Butler touch Jennifer Nguyen or Taylor. Cooper Dep. 126:4-6.

D.

Cooper was disciplined in December 2009 for lying.
In December of 2009, Cooper was disciplined by Seton when she lied to Seton about why

she had to edit her time entry, claiming she had lost her badge when she had not. H. Nguyen
Aff. ¶ 10 & Ex. C. Cooper was caught in the lie and she admitted in her deposition both that she
lied and that Seton was justified in disciplining her for lying. Cooper Dep. 105:10-108:10 & Ex.
10. Seton suspended her without pay for this misconduct. Cooper Dep. 105:10-106:3; H.
Nguyen Dep. ¶ 10.
E.

Cooper voluntarily resigned; she testified that she was not forced to resign.
The day she was scheduled to return to work following her suspension, Cooper was tardy.

Cooper Dep. 111:1-18. Afraid of the impact of her tardiness occurring immediately after she had
been suspended for lying, Cooper sent Hue Nguyen an email resigning and then contacted Hue
Nguyen the following morning to talk. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 11 & Ex. D. Hue Nguyen documented
the conversation in an “anecdote,” and Cooper testified that the anecdote accurately reflects their
conversation. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 11 & Ex. D; Cooper Dep. 111:25-112:7. & Ex. 12. In the
conversation, Cooper informed Hue Nguyen that it was stressful working two jobs and over 70
hours per week. Cooper Dep. 112:15-23. Her conversation with Hue Nguyen took place at 7:30
a.m. on January 6, 2010, and Cooper forwarded her resignation email to Tracie Thor shortly
thereafter. Cooper Dep. 113:8-13, 108:12-109:1 & Ex. 11. In Cooper’s email, one of her
reasons for quitting was that she could not be promoted to the “CA III” position at Seton
Williamson because the third floor did not need CA IIIs, who are used on intensive care floors
and in emergency rooms. Cooper Dep. Ex. 11 & 109:2-11, 116:7-11.
Cooper testified in her deposition that she is not claiming that Seton forced her to resign.
Cooper Dep. 113:22-24. She admitted that she resigned because she thought it would look better

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 7 of 20

than a termination, which was the consequence she anticipated for being tardy immediately after
a suspension for lying; moreover, no one at Seton told her to resign. Cooper Dep. 114:12115:11.
ARGUMENT
The Court should grant Seton’s summary judgment against Elizabeth Cooper pursuant to
Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. There is no genuine issue as to any material
fact and Seton is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Cooper’s claims of sexual
harassment, retaliation, vicarious liability for assault, and negligence. See Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).
A.

Cooper’s hostile work environment claims under Title VII and the TCHRA fail
because there is no evidence that she was subjected to severe or pervasive
harassment, or that she ever told Seton that she was being harassed.
Cooper claims that Butler sexually harassed her by creating a hostile work environment.

To prevail on this claim, Cooper would have to prove that: (1) she belongs to a protected group;
(2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on
her sex; (4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) Seton
knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt, remedial action. See
Hockman v. Westward Comms., LLC, 407 F.3d 317, 325 (5th Cir. 2004).
1. The record contains no evidence of “severe” or “pervasive” harassment.
For alleged harassment “to affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment, it must
be both objectively and subjectively abusive.” Id. (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S.
17, 21 (1993)). “Whether an environment is objectively hostile or abusive is determined by
considering the totality of the circumstances.” Id. These circumstances include the frequency of
the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a
mere offensive utterance; whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 7

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 8 of 20

performance; and whether the alleged harassment “unreasonably undermines the plaintiff’s
workplace competence.” Id. at 325-26.
Applying this standard to a case involving considerably more egregious allegations than
Cooper’s, the Fifth Circuit in Hockman held that the alleged conduct did not constitute severe or
pervasive harassment as a matter of law and affirmed summary judgment for the employer on the
plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim. Id. at 328-329. In that case, the plaintiff claimed the
alleged harasser, over the course of one and half years, had made a comment about another
employee’s body, slapped her on the behind once with a newspaper, “grabbed or brushed”
against the plaintiff’s breasts and behind, held her cheeks and tried to kiss her, asked the plaintiff
to come to the office early so that they could be alone, and had once stood in the door of the
bathroom while she washed her hands.

The Fifth Circuit held that this evidence did not

constitute evidence of severe or pervasive harassment. In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth
Circuit noted that these allegations were not as egregious as the conduct alleged in another case
where the Fifth Circuit had affirmed summary judgment for the employer, in which the alleged
harasser had remarked on the color of the plaintiff’s nipples and the size of her thighs and had
attempted to look down her clothes. Id. (citing Shepherd v. Comptroller of Pub. Accounts, 168
F.3d 871, 872 (5th Cir. 1999)). The Hockman court characterized the harasser’s comments as
perhaps boorish or offensive but not sufficiently severe, describing them as “simple teasing.” Id.
at 328. The Court also noted that the alleged brushings were not sufficiently severe or pervasive,
and contrasted them to cases where the harasser made contact “repeatedly” or multiple times per
week. Id. at 328.
The conduct Cooper has described is simply not as egregious as the conduct of the
alleged harassers in Hockman or Shepherd, and summary judgment was affirmed for the

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 8

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 9 of 20

employers in both of those cases. As is laid out in the Statement of Facts, when asked in her
deposition to explain all incidents that serve as the bases for her allegations of sexual harassment,
Cooper testified that Butler put his hands on her shoulder, that he touched her hip once, that he
embraced her from behind once, and that he used the expression that he would “beat her with a
wet noodle.” The “wet noodle”

3

comment was, at worst, “simple teasing,” and the incidents

where Butler allegedly touched Cooper in non-private areas are less severe than those alleged by
the plaintiff in Hockman, who was alleging contact with her breasts and bottom, and less
pervasive, since Cooper alleges that he touched her hip once and embraced her from behind
once.
Furthermore, the plaintiff’s subjective reaction to the alleged conduct is dispositive in
analyzing hostile work environment claims, and Cooper herself indicated in her April and June
2009 statements to Seton that she had not experienced any harassing conduct. In sum, the set of
incidents alleged by Cooper do not constitute harassment that is either “severe” or “pervasive,”
and therefore Seton is entitled to summary judgment on Cooper’s claim.
2. Cooper cannot prove that Seton knew or should have known of the alleged
harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action.
An employer who takes prompt remedial action after a plaintiff informs it of alleged
harassment can avoid liability for that harassment if it takes prompt remedial action. Hockman,
407 F.3d at 329. Here, the evidence establishes that during the time frame that Cooper now
alleges that Butler subjected her to harassment—approximately January 27, 2009 to April 3,
2009—Cooper’s statements to Seton were that she had no issue with Butler and that she had not
witnessed him harassing anyone else. See Statement of Facts, §§ A—B, infra. Because Cooper
3

Seton requests that the Court take judicial notice that “lashes with a wet noodle” is an expression largely attributed
to Ann Landers, who used it to describe a mild punishment for small offenses, and that it has no known sexual
connotation. See, e.g., Margalit Fox, Ann Landers, Advice Giver To the Millions, Is Dead at 83, NY Times, June 23,
2002 (describing “40 lashes with a wet noodle” as Ann Landers’s “customary penance” in her obituary.)

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 9

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 10 of 20

did not report any alleged harassment, Seton’s duty to take prompt remedial action was not
triggered, and Cooper’s harassment claim therefore fails on this prong as well.
Furthermore, the Court should disregard Cooper’s new contention that she complained
about Butler in February. Seton disputes that Cooper made any such complaints in February; as
the Statement of Facts explains, her claims that she complained in February are contradicted by
the overwhelming evidence in the record of the statements she made to Seton in the Spring of
2009. At the summary judgment stage, credibility determinations should usually be left for trial
but “a court may disregard testimony and render judgment as a matter of law when no reasonable
jury could find the testimony credible.” Cooper v. Wal-Mart Transp., LLC, 662 F. Supp. 2d 757
(S.D. Tex. 2009) (relying on the language in Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 546, 575
1985, that factors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to
believe a witness; documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness’s story; or the
story may be so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable fact finder
would not credit it).
However, even if the Court assumes that Cooper did make a complaint in February, the
Fifth Circuit has held on multiple occasions that employers are entitled to judgment as a matter
of law on hostile work environment claims if the evidentiary record establishes that the allegedly
harassing behavior ceased after the plaintiff reported the harassment. See Skidmore v. Precision
Printing & Pckg. Inc., 188 F.3d 606, 616 (5th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases). In this case, Cooper
stated in the investigation interview that Butler was not harassing her, and Cooper stopped
working the same shifts as Cooper by April 2, 2009; therefore, the record establishes any
allegedly harassing conduct ceased.

B.

Cooper’s retaliation claims fail on a prima facie level and because Seton has
proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons its actions.
In addition to alleging she was harassed, Cooper alleges that she was retaliated against

for exercising her rights under Title VII and the TCHRA. Specifically, Cooper claims that Seton
failed to promote her from CA II to CA III, suspended her, and constructively discharged her for
engaging in protected activity. Where, as in this case, there is no direct evidence of
discriminatory retaliation, a plaintiff alleging retaliation can only survive a motion for summary
judgment if she can meet the evidentiary burden established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework,
the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation lies with the plaintiff. DeCorte
v. Jordan, 497 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir. 2007). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, only
then does the burden shift to the employer to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its
actions. Id. If the employer offers such a reason, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to
show that the justification is merely pretext for discrimination. Id.

This burden shifting

framework applies to retaliation claims under the TCHRA as well under Title VII. See Pineda v.
United Parcel Service, Inc., 360 F.3d 483, 487 (5th Cir. 2004).
1. Cooper admits she was not forced to resign and so Seton is entitled to summary
judgment on her retaliation claim based on constructive discharge.
Cooper has alleged that she was constructively discharged in retaliation for engaging in a
protected activity. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation based on constructive discharge,
a plaintiff “must prove that working conditions would have been so difficult or unpleasant that a
reasonable person in [her] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.” Harvill v. Westward
Communications, L.L.C., 433 F.3d 428, 439-440 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation omitted).
However, in this case, Cooper herself testified that she is not claiming that Seton forced her to
resign. Cooper Dep. 113:22-24. She admitted that she quit after she was tardy to work after

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 11

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 12 of 20

having been legitimately suspended for lying to her employer and she wanted to quit because she
thought a resignation would look better on her record that an involuntary termination. Cooper
Dep. 114:12-115:11. There is no evidence that she quit because of Butler’s alleged harassment
as she quit in January 2010, and she had not worked with Butler since the spring of 2009. See
Statement of Facts, infra. There is also no testimony that anyone else at Seton was subjecting
her to the type of harassment that would have compelled her to resign. Therefore, Seton is
entitled to summary judgment on Cooper’s claim that she was constructively discharged in
retaliation for engaging in a protected activity.
2. Cooper cannot prove a prima facie case of retaliation based on Seton’s failure to
promote her, and Seton can show she was not promoted for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.
Cooper also contends that she was not promoted from CA II to CA III in retaliation for
engaging in protective activity. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must
present evidence that (1) she engaged in an activity protected by Title VII or the TCHRA; (2) her
employer took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) a causal connection exists
between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Pineda., 360 F.3d at 487.
Cooper cannot prove the third element. She alleges in her complaint that she expressed an
interest in a promotion in August 2009, but the promotion was denied in retaliation for
complaints she allegedly made about Butler seven months earlier in February.
As is explained, infra, Seton disputes that Cooper made any such complaints in February
and her claims that she complained in February are contradicted by the overwhelming evidence
in the record of the statements she made to Seton in the Spring of 2009. Because Cooper’s
deposition testimony contradicts her own multiple contemporaneous statements and all other
objective evidence in the record, the Court should disregard it. See Cooper v. Wal-Mart Transp.,
LLC, 662 F. Supp. 2d 757 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (holding that at the summary judgment stage, “a
Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 12

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 13 of 20

court may disregard testimony and render judgment as a matter of law when no reasonable jury
could find the testimony credible.”).
However, even if the Court considers Cooper’s testimony and assumes for purposes of
summary judgment only that she did make a complaint in February, there is no evidence in the
record that any alleged report in February had any impact on Seton’s decision whether to
promote her from to CA II to CA III in August. A plaintiff alleging retaliation must present
“some evidence of a causal link.” Ackel v. Natl. Comm., Inc., 339 F.3d 376, 385 (5th Cir. 2003)
(emphasis in original). A plaintiff can rely on the temporal proximity between an adverse
employment action and the protected activity to satisfy the causal link element of the prima facie
case, but the temporal proximity must be “very close.” Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden,
532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (citing cases that held that gaps of three and four months are too long
to establish the causal connection element). Here, there was almost a seven month gap between
Cooper’s alleged reports and the August promotion decision, and therefore Cooper has failed to
adequately support her prima facie case.
Regardless, even if Cooper could establish a prima facie retaliation case based on Seton’s
promotion decision, Seton has met its summary judgment burden to establish legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not promoting Cooper to CA III, because, as Cooper has admitted, the
floor where Cooper was assigned to work only requires CA IIs; in fact, one of the reasons
Cooper gave Seton in support of her decision to resign was the fact that she could not “grow” in
that position since the third floor did not need CA IIIs. Cooper Dep. 109:2-11, 116:7-11, & Ex.
11. It is also important to note that Seton gave Cooper a pay raise in October 2009, which is at
odds with her claim that it was retaliating against her. Cooper Dep. 97:3-21. & Ex. 8. In short,
Seton is entitled to summary judgment on Cooper’s retaliation claim because she has failed to

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 13

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 14 of 20

meet her prima facie burden, and because Seton has proffered evidence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not promoting her.
3. Cooper has admitted that she was suspended in December 2009 for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, and therefore her final retaliation claim also fails.

Cooper’s final allegation of retaliation is that Seton suspended her in December 2009 in
retaliation for engaging in protected activity. Again, Cooper cannot support her prima facie case
because she can point to no evidence of a causal connection between her December 2009
suspension and any protected activity that she allegedly engaged in. See Pineda., 360 F.3d at
487 (third element of a prima facie case is that a causal connection exists between the protected
activity and the adverse employment action).
However, even assuming that she could establish a prima facie case, it is undisputed that
Cooper was disciplined for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons, as Cooper’s own testimony
proves. She was disciplined when she lied to Seton about why she had to edit her time and she
was caught in the lie; she testified in her deposition both that she lied and that Seton was justified
in disciplining her for lying. Cooper Dep. Ex. 10 & 105:10-108:10. Because it is undisputed
that Seton had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for suspending Cooper, it is entitled to
summary judgment on the retaliation claim based on this adverse employment action as well.

Seton is entitled to summary judgment on Cooper’s claims that it should be
vicariously liable for any assault by Butler.
In addition to suing Seton for sexual harassment and retaliation, Cooper has sued John

Butler for assault based on his touching her on the shoulder and the two incidents in the supply
closet, and she seeks to impose vicarious liability upon Seton for those alleged assaults.
However, Seton cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged assaults based on either
vicarious liability claim pled in her complaint, respondeat superior or ratification. Assuming
without conceding that Cooper even could prove the elements of her assault claim, Seton would

not be vicariously liable for Butler’s alleged assaults because there is no evidence that Butler was
acting in the course and scope of his employment, that he was acting on Seton’s behalf, or that he
was acting with Seton’s approval when he committed any alleged assault.
1. Seton is not liable for any alleged assault on a respondeat superior claim, and
Cooper has waived any vice principal claim against Seton.
Cooper has asserted a respondeat superior claim against Seton based on Butler’s alleged
assault. To impose liability on an employer for an assault by an employee via a respondeat
superior claim, a plaintiff must show that the alleged assailant was acting in the course and scope
of his employment when he committed the assault. See Buck v. Blum, 130 S.W.3d 285, 288
(Tex. App. –Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.). In Buck, the Houston Court of Appeals awarded
summary judgment to a neurological institute when one of its doctors, while performing a grip
test, placed his penis in the patient’s hand instead of the appropriate instrument. Id. at 289. The
patient sued the institute, alleging a respondeat superior claim based on the doctor’s assault, and
the appellate court affirmed summary judgment for the institute noting that “it cannot be
fathomed that the action was in furtherance of the employer’s business or for the
accomplishment of an objective for which he was employed,” and held as a matter of law, that
the assault was not in the course and scope of the doctor’s employment. Id. In reaching this
conclusion, the court distinguished situations where an assault might be in the course and scope
of employment, for instance where a security guard charged with protecting an employer’s
property uses too much force. Id.
Cooper’s situation is more analogous to the situation in Buck than to the security guard
situation; assuming without conceding that Butler made any sexual or offensive physical contact
with Cooper, such contact between Butler (a nurse) and Cooper (a clinical assistant) was not in
furtherance of Seton’s business of providing care to patients; nor would it be in furtherance of

Seton’s Mtn. for Summ. J. Against Cooper

Page 15

Case 1:10-cv-00650-AWA Document 24 Filed 08/31/11 Page 16 of 20

any objective for which Butler was employed. Thus, Seton is entitled to summary judgment on
Cooper’s respondeat superior claim.
Cooper did not allege in her complaint that Butler was a vice principal, and therefore she
has waived any argument that Seton could be held vicariously liable for Butler’s alleged assaults
on that theory.4 However, even if Cooper had pled a vice-principal claim, it would fail as well.
An employer can be held liable for an assault committed by a vice principal, which is an
employee who is one of the following: (1) a corporate officer; (2) an employee with the authority
to hire, direct, or discharge employees; (3) an employee engaged in the performance of nondelegable or absolute duties of the employer; or (4) an employee to whom the employer has
confided the management of the whole business or a department of the business. Garrett v.
Great Western Distibuting Co., 129 S.W.3d 797, 802 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2004, pet. denied).
Butler is none of these things. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶¶ 5. Even if he were a vice principal, however,
his alleged assaults can only be imputed to Seton if the vice principal’s alleged tort “was
encompassed within the duties assigned” to him. Id. The duties Butler had as a Seton nurse did
not encompass any need for any physical contact with clinical assistants like Cooper.
2. The record contains no evidence that Seton ratified any assault by Butler.
Cooper’s ratification claim fails as well; Seton did not ratify Butler’s alleged assault of
Cooper. To prove that a defendant ratified the acts of an agent, the plaintiff must prove (1) that
the agent committed the act on behalf of the defendant, and (2) that the defendant approved of
the plaintiff’s act by word, act, or conduct after acquiring full knowledge of the act. St. Joseph
Hosp. v. Wolff, 94 S.W.3d 513, 536 -537 (Tex. 2002). The evidentiary record does not contain

4

See Direkly v. ARA Devcon, Inc., 866 S.W.2d 652, 655 (Tex. App. –Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ dismissed w.o.j.)
(holding that plaintiffs who amended their petition and abandoned their vice-principal claim had waived that claim
because the amended petition only contained a respondeat superior claim); see also Garrett, 129 S.W.3d at 802
(treating vice principal and a respondeat superior claims as distinct claims and analyzing the claims separately).

evidence that would support either element. First, assuming without conceding that Butler
touched Cooper in the manner that she alleges, none of those touchings were acts on behalf of
Seton. Second, there is no evidence that Seton acquired full knowledge of an assault and then
approved it by word, act, or conduct. Instead, the evidence shows that Cooper did not even
report the alleged assault to Seton at the time that they occurred. See Statement of Facts, infra, at
§ B.

And when Cooper filed her EEOC charge several months later, Seton had already

investigated the other plaintiffs’ allegations but was unable to substantiate them. H. Nguyen Aff.
¶ 9. Moreover, by the time Cooper filed the EEOC charge, Butler had already been transferred
to a different Seton facility to avoid any further contact between Butler and the other two
plaintiffs. H. Nguyen Aff. ¶ 9. That simply does not equate to ratification.
D.

Cooper’s negligence claims against Seton are barred because Seton is a workers’
compensation subscriber.
Finally, Seton is also entitled to summary judgment on Cooper’s various negligence

claims.

Under Texas law, the Workers’ Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy for

negligence claims by employees of workers’ compensation subscribers. Tex. Lab. Code §
408.001 (West 2006); Reed Tool Co. v. Copelin, 689 S.W.2d 404, 406 (Tex. 1985). To trigger
the workers’ compensation bar, a defendant must prove that (1) the employee asserting the claim
was acting as an employee at the time of the alleged tort, and (2) the defendant was a workers’
compensation subscriber. See Martinez v. H.B. Zachry Co., 976 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex. App.—
Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied). The first element is not in dispute—Cooper alleges that
Butler assaulted her while she was on duty at Seton. Compl. ¶ 30-33, 36, 53. It is also
undisputed that that Seton is, and was at all times relevant to this lawsuit, a workers’
compensation subscriber. Williams Aff. ¶ 3. Therefore, Cooper’s negligence claims are barred
as a matter of law.

grant any additional relief to which it may be justly entitled.
