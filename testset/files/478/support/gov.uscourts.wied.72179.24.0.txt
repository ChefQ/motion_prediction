WILLIAM M. SCHMALFELDT, SR. Case No. 2:15-cv-01516-NJ JON W. SANFILIPPO
Plaintiff pro se, ) MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT CLERK
v. ) PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO
SARAH PALMER, ET AL., ) DISQUALIFY DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL
Defendants ) (ECF 18) WITH ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT AARON
WALKER'S INCOMPETENCE AND
MENTAL INSTABILITY

 

NOW COMES Plaintiff William M. Schmalfeldt Sr. with this MOTION TO
SUPPLEMENT PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL
(ECF 18) WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT AARON WALKER'S
INCOMPETENCE AND MENTAL. Plaintiffs intent with this motion is to lay before this
honorable Court the "big picture" about Walker's lack of competence and unstable mental
condition to show that he is incapable of giving Defendants Palmer and Johnson a full and
competent defense in the instant case.

I.
WALKER HAS BEEN A DIRECT PARTICIPANT IN A THREE YEAR ATTACK ON

PLAINTIFF WHICH RESULTED IN HIS HAVING TO RELOCATE FROM
MARYLAND TO WISCONSIN

1. On information and belief, Walker has been acting as something of a de facto
legal adviser in the cases filed against Plaintiff by non-parties William John Joseph Hoge III
(HOGE) who Walker now refers to as his "paralegal" despite Hoge's lack of any recognized

legal training.

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ_ Filed 03/18/16 Page 1of12 Document 24
2. Plaintiff does not consider being called "fat" defamatory. He does note, however,
that Walker until recently has used his Twitter feed (http://twitter.com/aaronworthing) as a
vehicle to make snide, inappropriate juvenile jokes about Plaintiff for years. (Exhibit 1)

3. Walker's "paralegal" Hoge has asked the Carroll County, Maryland, to bring a
total of three hundred sixty seven (367) criminal charges against Plaintiff. Only one of these
charges ever made it out of the Carroll County State's Attorney and Plaintiff was acquitted at the
trial. He has secured two peace orders against Plaintiff by confusing an elderly Carroll County
circuit court judge about how Twitter is used, claiming that it's harder to block a person on
Twitter than it is to change your telephone number to avoid telemarketers.

4, Walker's "paralegal" Hoge filed a horribly botched Copyright Infringement Suit
against Plaintiff. Many of the technical and procedural errors made by Hoge can be seen in
Exhibit 2.

5. Walker's "paralegal" attempted to seek a "Contempt of Court" charge against
Plaintiff in Carroll County in which, at the hearing, he produced a letter "proving" Plaintiff had
contacted him against the order of the Court. The letter was not written by Plaintiff and bears a
signature obviously traced from a previous document submitted by Plaintiff. The contempt
petition was denied.

6. After his second Peace Order tolled, Walker's "paralegal" Hoge tried several
more times to get further Peace Orders against Plaintiff. By this time, Plaintiff was aware of
Maryland Code CJ 0x00A7 6-201 which states in relevant part:

"Subject to the provisions of 0x00A70x00A7 6-202 and 6-203 and unless otherwise provided by

law, a civil action shall be brought in a county where the defendant resides, carries
on a regular business, is employed, or habitually engages in a vocation."

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ_ Filed 03/8/16 Page 2 of 12 Document 24
As Plaintiff lived in Howard County and Hoge lives in Carroll County, his efforts to
secure another Peace Order were barred in Carroll County, and denied in Howard County. Hoge
appealed all the way to the Carroll County Circuit Court, which denied the appeal.

7. At practically every one of his "paralegal's" court appearances, Hoge received
direct legal advice and support from Walker, who sat in the courtroom observing the
proceedings, and then using his blog to blame the Maryland legal system for Hoge's multiple
defeats.

8. In March 2013, when the Howard County State's Attorney declined to
accommodate Walker and his "paralegal" Hoge and dropped criminal charges they sought to
bring against Plaintiff, together they conspired to launch a campaign to slow down or stop law
enforcement efforts in the county by what is called a "blogswarm" which they called "Everyone
Blog About Howard County" day. Hoge posted in his blog:

I propose the following. Over the next couple of weeks, I encourage bloggers to

contact the Howard County State's Attorney Dario J. Broccolino for comments on

those cases and the following questions in particular:

1. Is it the position of the State's Attorney that operation of a blog allows one

unlimited license to contact another person without regard to Maryland Criminal

Statutes 3-803 and/or 3-805?

2. Does Mr. Broccilino (sp) believe that a public person such as himself may not seek

to demand that someone cease contacting him as provided by Maryland Criminal

Statutes 3-803 and/or 3-805?

3. Is it the policy of State's Attorney that non-residents of Maryland must or should
avoid entering the state if they are being stalked by a Maryland resident?

On Monday, 8 April, 2013, I suggest that those bloggers who have contacted the
Howard County State's Attorney post the answers they have received along with
any comments they feel would be appropriate-8 April should be Everyone Blog
About the Howard County State's Attorney Day.

In his blog, Aaron Walker wrote:

To set the scene a little, on March 1, 2013, I had filed harassment and electronic
harassment charges against Bill Schmalfeldt. As you know by now, convicted
terrorist Brett Kimberlin chose that day to stalk my wife as we were waiting to get a
temporary peace order, and he stalked me again the next Friday when I had to be in
court for a continuance of the peace order hearing.

The next Monday (March 11), I had to meet with Assistant State's Attorney Jim
Brewer of Howard County, Maryland. I shared the story with Becca Lower and she
was kind enough to publish it. Do read the whole thing, please. Brewer told us he
was going to dismiss the harassment charges against Schmalfeldt. So I asked him
also about the stalking, telling him what Kimberlin had done. First he said, "it's a
public place" as if that made a difference. For instance, in Hackley v. State, one of
the acts of "stalking" included driving down a public street in front of the victim's
home and the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld that decision. In fact what the
Court of Appeals held was that any activity that created a reasonabie fear of any
kind of assault would support a stalking charge whether or not it involved following
a person around or not.

I tried to explain to him this about the law and somewhere in that conversation is
when he uttered that phrase in the face of my tearful wife:

"If you're so concerned for your safety, don't come to Maryland."

You got that? Good, peaceful, law-abiding citizens who don't want to be
terrorized-or for their wives to be terrorized-shouldn't come to

Maryland. Indeed by this logic, I guess all the good people presently living there
should just leave.

My flippant attitude is hiding, to a degree, my anger about what happened. What
this represents is an abdication of their duty to protect the public.

So if you agree that this is outrageous, then there may be something you can do to
help. My goed friend John Hoge has suggested an Everyone Blog About the

Howard County State's Attorney Day. What he is suggesting, in essence is a
blogswarm where we all try to get a comment from the Howard County state's

attorney about the matter and report back what happened.

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ_ Filed o3/f8/16 Page 4 of 12 Document 24
 

So please read what Mr. Hoge has to say and consider participating in it. No state

in our union should be off limits to peaceful, law-abiding citizens in favor of

unreformed domestic terrorists. And it is disgusting that we are reduced to fighting

for such a basic principle. (See http://allergic2bull.blogspot.com/2013/03/everyone-

blog-about-howard-county-md.html)

This organized effort to harass Howard County Law Enforcement for failing to prosecute
Plaintiff was joined with, among other things, an attempt to make a profit off the situation by the
sale of merchandise, such as the "Maryland is for Stalkers" bumper stickers which are still

available online for $4.20 each.

Maryland 15 for Stalkers

(See http://www.zazzle.com/maryland is for stalkers car_bumper_sticker-

128096459467617799)
9. When Plaintiff's wife died in June 2015, Plaintiff concluded that these attacks

d

|

 

would continue as long as Plaintiff remained an easy target by staying in Maryland. He relocated
to Wisconsin in August 2015.

10. The harassment did not stop. Defendant Johnson, who had been promulgating the
false and defamatory conclusion that Plaintiff was dealing in Child Pornography, made at least
two direct contacts with the management of the Juniper Court apartment complex making his
ridiculous and actionable accusations against Plaintiff. He also posted on at least one website a
list of the names and addresses of all members of the Cardinal Capital Management board of
directors, the entity that manages Juniper Court for the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi who own

the complex, urging readers to call and demand Plaintiff's eviction as the "friend of a terrorist"

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ_ Filed 03/78/16 Page 5 of 12 Document 24
 

and a man who creates "child pornography." On information and belief, these actions were done
under the guidance and blessing of Mr. Walker.

11. A non-party in Shirley, MA, applied for a Restraining Order in his state, knowing
that Plaintiff's medical condition precluded a long trip to that state, because Plaintiff sent him a
"Tweet" after the non-party demanded he cease. On information and belief, this was done in
coordination and under the guidance of Mr. Walker.

12. _` Plaintiff believed that a non-party living in St. Charles, IL, might be the
anonymous blogger Paul Krendler. In an effort to ascertain if that was true, Plaintiff left two very
polite, non threatening phone messages with the non-party's parents, with whom she lives. The
non-party declared those innocent phone messages to be harassment and won an uncontested
restraining order against plaintiff. On information and belief, this was also accomplished in
coordination with Mr. Walker.

13. When Plaintiff noticed that Defendant Palmer was operating a commercial blog
with the Plaintiff's name as part of the title, he contacted Palmer ordering her to cease and desist.
She not only refused, she demanded Plaintiff cease contact and subsequently got a Rockingham
County, North Carolina, court to issue a restraining order for herself and for her three-year old
grandson. Plaintiff denies ever illegally contacting or harassing anyone, let alone a toddler. On
information and belief this was done under the guidance of Mr. Walker.

14. Mr. Walker by rights should be disqualified as counsel of record for defendants as
he has been complicit and an active participant in the very torts Plaintiff is asking this court to
decide. He should be dismissed as he has exposed himself to allegations of in-concert liability.

15. | Thornwood v. Jenner & Block, 344 N.E.2d 15 (II_App. 2003) provides a classic

example of an in-concert liability claim against a lawyer in the context of a fraud claim. In that

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ_ Filed 03/8/16 Page 6 of 12 Document 24
 

 

 

case, Jenner & Block was alleged to have aided one partner in the purchase a partnership interest
from another partner. At that time, unbeknownst to the selling partner, the purchasing partner
was negotiating a deal which was about to make the partnership very valuable. Jenner & Block
was accused of aiding the purchasing partner in the negotiation while knowing that the selling
partner had no knowledge of this impending deal. The lawyer participated in the transaction
including counseling the purchasing partner and drafting all of the documents. The Ilinois Court
of Appeals, in overturning dismissal on a motion to dismiss, held that these alleged acts
constituted knowing substantial assistance, which was sufficient to state a claim for aiding and
abetting the alleged fraud committed by the purchasing partner.

16. By advising his "paralegal" Hoge in his hundreds of attempts to put Plaintiff in
jail, by providing material support to non-parties in Massachusetts and Illinois seeking bogus
restraining orders, by assisting defendants Palmer and Johnson in the execution of their tortuous
activities, this Court would be well within its rights to find that Mr, Walker has made himself
vulnerable to a charge of in-concert liability. Thus, he should be immediately removed as
defense counsel for defendants who, on information and belief, Walker assisted in committing
the torts alleged in the instant case.

Il.
WALKER'S ALLEGED MENTAL INSTABILITY AND INCOMPETENCE COULD
DEPRIVE DEFENDANTS OF A FAIR TRIAL

17. This Court should consider whether or not Mr. Walker is mentally stable or
competent enough to act as Defendant's Counsel in the instant case.

18. | Walker's involvement in the anti-Islam smear campaign is well known.

"The Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris France were attacked by terrorists on the

morning of January 7th 2015, killing 12 people, with a total of 17 people dead before
the crisis was over. The attack was supposedly in retaliation for cartoons of the

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ Filed 03/48/16 Page 7 of12 Document 24
 

Prophet Muhammed that the Hebdo cartoonists published. Law enforcement
agencies have clamped down to prevent further violence, but several prominent
right wingers in the United States have viewed this attack as an opportunity to score
political points. One of the more prominent examples is Aaron Walker, who hails
from Manassas, Virginia. For years now, Mr.Walker has produced "cartoons"
(stick-figure drawings, really) of Islam's founder that are far more explicit and
offensive than anything the staff ever produced at Charlie Hebdo. Even before the
incident was over, Walker went on a mini jihad on Twitter, posting cartoons from
his old #EveryoneDrawMohammed cartoon database. These depictions
concentrated on one of Aaron Walker's personal pet peeves when it comes to the
Prophet, namely allegations of pedophilia because of his marriage to a child bride.
Aaron Walker used this meme throughout the aftermath of the Paris crisis while
recruiting others to spread his, um, `cartoons' born from an extreme right wing
ideology. To Walker, the Charlie Hebdo attack was a personal vindication of his
tasteless and talentless efforts to inflame opinion and invite attacks - on other
people. (Exhibit 3) Mr. Walker has been producing these cartoons for more than
four years. Although his work is still protected by the First Amendment, it's not
comedy or satire. It's juvenile extremism designed to invite the worst possible
response from a world away. Walker seeks more than attention; he claims to carry a
revolver and actively taunts terrorists to "come and get me, bitches." On his
EverybodyDrawMuhammad blog, he called on other people to submit "fatwa-
worthy cartoons" and drawings that would get them put on some terrorist's death
list. He even claims in his tweets that he wants to die or be killed. Walker used to be
an anonymous figure, but due to a legal fight he picked in 2011, `Aaron Worthing'
was identified as attorney Aaron Walker of Manassas, Virginia. Walker had lied to
everyone about his name. After fighting numerous legal battles with his arch
nemesis through a mentally ill proxy, his real name came out, and he finally had to
explain to his readers that he had lied to them all along. The reason he lied to them?
Because his wife (who, let us reiterate, checks under the family car every day for
bombs while he stays inside to provide covering fire with his little six-shooter) didn't
want him to have a public battle with real terrorists. She rather wisely wanted him
to remain anonymous while producing said images of Mohammed. And of course
there is Walker's rank cowardice which shows a yellow streak down his back a mile
long. However Walker continued to encourage readers to submit their pen sketches
under their real names and locations to show how courageous they were." (See
http:/Awww.breitbartunmasked.com/2015/01/23/the-manassas-virginia-jihad-aaron-
walker-is-no-charlie-hebdo/)

19. When his identity was revealed, Mr. Walker displayed a callous lack of concern
for his former coworkers. The attorney hired by his employer to dispose of him attempted to get
Walker to post on his blog that he was no longer connected to the home health care firm, for

which he was employed as a compliance attorney. (Exhibit 4)

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ Filed 03/88/16 Page 8 of 12 Document 24
 

20. | Walker's reply to Mr. Hodges was almost uncanny in its careless attitude for the
lives of his coworkers. He didn't care less if they were harmed or killed. Walker was only upset
that Mr. Hodges and his former employer were treating him "shabbily;" his most pressing
concern was dinner at home with his wife that evening. (Exhibit 5)

21. The e-mail sent by James Hodges, the attorney hired by PHRI to dispense with
Mr. Walker's services (ECF 17, Exh. 3) in which he outlines the reasons for firing Walker

contained a very telling "P.S." at the end. (Exhibit 6)

1H.

ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF, WALKER AND HIS "PARALEGAL" HOGE ARE
FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATRED AGAINST PLAINTIFF AND ENCOURAGING
THREATENING MESSAGES TO BE SENT IN THE APPARENT HOPE OF
INTIMIDATING PLAINTIFF

22. The messages are always sent through anonymous, overseas servers. No one ever
uses their own name. But the messages are in line with the meme being promulgated by Walker
and his "Paralegal" Hoge.

23. Plaintiff has received the following threats through the comment section of his
blog, http://thepontificator.com (Exhibit 6):

Bill, your admissions in this post prove you are the DumbFuck Of All DumbFucks.

It's only going to get worse from here. If you ever get incarcerated, being a known

child stalker is not going to workout well for you. Your best bet may be to take the

cure. I hear it's painless. ("The cure" is a constant reference as to how Plaintiff can

cure his Parkinson's disease by shooting himself in the head.)

His Lawsuit Needs a Name - The Stage I Dementia Lawsuit of Perceived
Conspiracy and Evil Confederates

Only a Dumbfuck like yourself would stoop so low...I bet you get your ass handed
to you! That will be epic! Can't wait...

As a human judge and jury; It is painfully evident that you really need a new hobby.

Case 2:15-cv-01516-NJ Filed 03/28/16 Page 9 of 12 Document 24
 

Or just end it in a Darwin Award sense.

You bring nothing to humanity except your whining and complaining.
You're lost and will unlikely never be found.

We pray you rest in peace.

Bill, it's been speculated that one of the reasons that Neal [redacted buy plaintiff]
has not been apprehended on swatting charges is that he's working a deal with law
enforcement. So, Bill, if he starts snitching on Team Pedophile, what will he say
about you? Did you receive any communication and/or communicate about the
Buffalo FBI Conspiracy? Your past as a former Breitbart Unmasked writer may
come to bite you and bite hard. And projecting on Twitter how you would like to
you would like to shake a innocent baby around in your teeth just like a dog would
is not going to look good in court. Your in deep now and you can't back out without
consequences. What ever are you going do to when they take your computer. You
are more than fucked!

Mark in MD and Bill Schmalfeldt seem to have the same complex issues. If they
can't decide on which Mommy-girls gets the mayonnaise flowing, they let a loved
one die alone and neglected while deciding about which scouts look like dear old
dad!

Hey Bill, I understand that 21 grams is a convenient way to still keep turning out a
Truck Stop Dolly after death. Only deranged cyberstalker; such as yourself, can
really ash up Juniper Court. (The "Truck Stop Dolly" is a reference to Plaintiff's late
wife, who died on June 17, 2015. This group takes delight in referring to Gail
Schmalfeldt as a truck stop prostitute. Same is true as to any reference to urns or ashes.)

Bill, you are a DumF uck extraordinaire. People have tried to give you advice but
you are too much of a DumbFuck to listen to any decent common sense. An
adjudicated child stalker; such as yourself, who is also documented child
pornographer belongs behind bars being forced to do the the old in-n-out. You seem
to be a DumbF uck hell-bent on achieving this feat. Keep going Fat Boy more head
dent await you.

Your fucking with teh wrong people. Let this go. That is my final warnings. Sarah is
a grandmother for fucksake. Your attacking a grandmother!!!! Back the fuck off.

Billy, your such the toddler stalker! Yes,you did publish a picture of [redacted] child
as a corpse. Yes you did, you toddler stalker. Is it because of your homosexual
tendencies that seems to be geared toward cub scouts? Anyway, here little
Valentine's Day card you should find entertaining.

This one is going to bite you in the ass, Dumbfuck! I can't wait!

Like you're going to be believed in court...that will be funny to see, Dumbfuck! A
Turd-rolling Dumbfuck!
