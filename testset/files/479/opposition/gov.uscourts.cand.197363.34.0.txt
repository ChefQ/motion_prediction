SUMMARY OF OPPOSITION

2

Defendant Digital Networks’ motion for stay should be DENIED as there is a

3

substantial likelihood that the non-moving Plaintiff will suffer substantial prejudice

4

if a complete stay of the litigation is granted, and the Court has insufficient

5

information to determine whether judicial economy would be served by a stay.

6

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court issue an alternative order, which

7

is a PARTIAL stay of the case, postponing claim construction briefing and trial, but

8

allowing the parties to proceed with discovery related to production methods, sales

9

data, and other matters for which claim construction is not critical, to avoid the

10

serious risk of loss of evidence that would prejudice Plaintiff.

11
12

FACTUAL SUMMARY

13

The ‘184 patent. This case involves patent infringement allegations related to

14

U.S. Patent No. 4,935,184, a process patent relating to multi-shot injection molding

15

of plastics. A common application of use of this patent is dual plastic ski boots,

16

consumer electronic products, kitchen utensils, and rubberized grips on the handles

17

of power tools. Kramer Decl. ¶ 4.

18

The ‘184 patent has been licensed for use by such household name companies

19

as 3M Company, BMW, Newell Rubbermaid, Hitachi-Maxell, Mercedes-Benz USA,

20

Daimler-Chrysler, Philips Electronics, Robert Bosch, Thales (Magellan), Garmin

21

International, Head USA, Nordica USA, Tecnica USA, Rossignol, Atomic Ski, Skil,

22

Irwin Tools, Dremel, Strait-Line, Chicony Electronics, The Stanley Works,

23

Milwaukee Electric, Welch Allyn, Griffin, Stanley Electric, Fluke, Acco, Harper

24

Brush, Woodstream, and Roche. Kramer Decl. ¶ 5.

25

The ’184 patent provides a long-sought elegant solution to a pervasive

26

problem in the injection molding of hollow plastic products: i.e., how to stabilize the

27

mold parts against relative movement during the highly pressurized injection of

28

melted plastic. This mold part relative movement problem causes misalignment of

1

the mold parts and results in products with walls of uneven thicknesses if not

2

adequately controlled. Kramer Decl. ¶ 6.

3

The ‘184 patented method is directed toward stabilizing the mold parts against

4

relative movement during the second injection of injection molding of laminated

5

plastic parts produced sequentially in two cavities made up of at least one common

6

mold part and at least two different complementary mold parts. Kramer Decl. ¶ 7.

7

The ‘184 patent teaches a method to stabilize the mold parts during the second

8

or later plastic injection by molding one or more stabilizing regions into the first

9

plastic material component(s) that rigidly secure the two mold parts against

10

displacement during the second or later injection. Kramer Decl. ¶ 8.

11

By stabilizing the mold parts against mold part relative movement during the

12

injection process, hollow products may be produced having more controlled

13

dimensions. Kramer Decl. ¶ 9.

14

Accused products and the Defendants. The products accused of infringement

15

in this case are Rio-brand MP3 players. Rio MP3 players were originally produced

16

by Diamond Multimedia. Diamond Multimedia was sold to Taiwanese graphics chip

17

company S3. S3 then sold its chip business and morphed into SonicBlue. SonicBlue

18

declared bankruptcy in early 2003. Kramer Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.

19

DNNA was created in July 2003 (apparently by D&M Holdings Inc.) and

20

acquired the Rio line from the SonicBlue bankruptcy estate. Shortly thereafter, in

21

August 2003, DNNA announced the launch of five new MP3 players and aggressive

22

strategies for building the Rio line. Kramer Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.

23

However, by summer of 2005, DNNA’s parent company announced that it

24

was selling off most of its Rio technology to SigmaTel, with most of the design and

25

technical personnel being hired by SigmaTel. DNNA has claimed that it ceased

26

sales of the accused MP3 players in September 2005.

Kramer Decl. ¶ 14.

27
28

Despite DNNA’s claim, sales of the originally accused Rio MP3 players, and
other models that also appear to infringe, continue to be sold via DNNA’s website

Status of company records relating to manufacture, import, and sale of accused

2

products. Before the filing of this litigation, Defendant’s counsel, Mr. Hulbert,

3

represented to Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms. Kramer, that the SigmaTel acquisition left

4

DNNA’s records in a state of disarray and represented that DNNA would have

5

difficulty finding actual sales numbers of the accused products. Although DNNA

6

appears to still be in business, Dun and Bradstreet reported an inability to confirm

7

operations as recently as March 2007. Kramer Decl. ¶¶ 15-16.

The Rio products that were formerly produced by DNNA were
manufactured overseas by third-party contract manufacturers. DNNA
has requested input from these manufacturers concerning the issues
raised in your letter as it relates to the Rio products. Communications
with overseas contract manufacturers often move slowly
notwithstanding diligent efforts. Not having continuing business with
these entities increases the difficulties.
Kramer Decl. 17, Exhibit G.
Neither Mr. Meisels nor DNNA’s outside counsel ever confirmed receipt of
information from these manufacturers or otherwise revealed the status of those
requests.

Plaintiff does not know the identity or contact information for those

companies. Kramer Decl. ¶ 18.
Pre-litigation communication between the parties.

Plaintiff’s counsel, J.

Michael Kaler, sent an initial infringement notice to DNNA in October 2004. Cocounsel Melody Kramer followed up on those efforts both in writing and by
telephone with representatives for DNNA. At no time during those communications
did DNNA represent that it was claiming that the ‘184 patent was invalid. To the
(www.digitalnetworksna.com) which links to a website run by co-defendant Legacy
Support Services, Ltd., a company doing business as S2G.

contrary, at least the last year of communications could be categorized as

2

negotiations over an appropriate licensing/release fee. No agreement was reached

3

and thus this suit was filed. Kramer Decl. ¶ 19.

4

Reexamination and the Black & Decker case. Plaintiff commenced patent

5

infringement litigation against Black & Decker Corporation in August 2006. After

6

almost a year of intense litigation, with a claim construction and trial of affirmative

7

defenses and willfulness already scheduled, and within days after entry of an order

8

requiring Black & Decker to turnover documents from its late in-house counsel’s

9

files, Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc. filed a request for reexamination of the ‘184 patent.

10

Kramer Decl. ¶ 21.
The reexamination request was accepted by the USPTO and Plaintiff is

11
12

currently awaiting receipt of a first office action. Kramer Decl. ¶ 22.

I.

A DISTRICT COURT MUST CONSIDER THREE FACTORS IN
DETERMINING A REQUEST FOR STAY—PREJUDICE TO NONMOVING PARTY, HARDSHIP TO MOVING PARTY, AND JUDICIAL
ECONOMY.
A district court is not required to stay judicial resolution of a patent

infringement dispute in view of a pending reexamination. Viskase Corp. v. American
Nat. Can Co., 261 F.3d 1316, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2001). A court must weigh the parties
competing interests as presented by the specific facts of the case at bar. Jain v.
Trimas Corp., 2005 WL 2397041, at *1 (E.D.Cal. Sept. 27, 2005).
When determining the appropriateness of a stay pending reexamination, courts
consider three factors: “(1) whether a stay would unduly prejudice or present a clear
tactical disadvantage to the nonmoving party; (2) whether a stay will simplify the
issues in question and trial of the case; and (3) whether discovery is complete and

whether a trial date has been set. Ricoh Co. v. Aeroflex Inc., 2006 WL 3708069, at

2

*2 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 14, 2006) (quoting ASCII Corp. v. STD Entertainment USA, Inc.,

3

844 F. Supp. 1378, 1380 (N.D.Cal. 1994)); see also Jain, 2005 WL 2397041, at *1;

4

KLA-Tencor Corp. v. Nanometrics, Inc., 2006 WL 708661, at *2 (N.D.Cal. Mar. 16,

5

2006).

6

Defendant’s motion should be denied as there is a substantial likelihood that

7

the non-moving party, Plaintiff, will suffer great prejudice if a complete stay of the

8

litigation is granted, and, further, judicial economy can be served without entry of a

9

complete stay at this stage in the proceedings, because the deteriorating situation

10

with the manufacturer and its former suppliers indicates that loss of critical evidence

11

is highly likely; and witnesses are likely to be scattered to the four winds over time.

12

A.

13
14
15
16
17
18

Plaintiff will likely suffer substantial prejudice if Defendants request for a
complete stay is granted because Defendant’s own representations demonstrate a
high risk of loss of critical evidence if this case is stayed before preliminary
discovery is conducted. Such a showing of prejudice and clear tactical disadvantage
weighs strongly against a stay.

19
20
21
22
23
24

There Is A Strong Likelihood Of Evidentiary Prejudice To Plaintiff
If The Requested Stay Is Granted.

For instance, in Telemac, motions to stay pending patent reexamination were
denied where the likely length of reexamination served to exacerbate the risk of lost
evidence. One of the defendants’ individual sales records had already been lost, and
the other defendant was in a precarious financial position.

Telemac Corp. v.

Teledigital, Inc., 450 F.Supp.2d 1107, 1111 (N.D.Cal. 2006). As the Telemac court
noted:

25
26
27
28

[Defendant’s] failure to preserve individual records suggests that
further delay could lead to further loss of information. Although the
likely length of reexamination is not, in itself, evidence of undue
prejudice, in the circumstances of this case, a possible lengthy delay
5.

would put [plaintiff] at a clear tactical disadvantage. The Court finds
that this favor weighs strongly against a stay.

Document 34

Id.
Here, due to repeated turnover in corporate ownership and personnel of the
accused product line, as well as the involvement of a series of contract overseas
manufacturers, it may be extraordinarily difficult to locate information regarding the
process used to manufacture the accused products, much less evidence relating to
issues of damages and willfulness. The likely length of reexamination2 will only
serve to exacerbate the high risk of loss of evidence in this case. Thus, as in
Telemac, a stay will serve to unduly prejudice Plaintiff and place Plaintiff at a clear
tactical disadvantage in its efforts to prove its case of infringement.

Repeated turnover of corporate ownership during relevant time periods. The
products accused of infringement in this case are Rio-brand MP3 players. The
ownership and control of the Rio product line and suppliers of components have
changed hands repeatedly during its years of existence and production of the
products appears to have ceased, making it difficult to ascertain the identity of
knowledgeable persons and custodians of relevant records.
Rio MP3 players were originally produced by Diamond Multimedia.
Diamond Multimedia was sold to Taiwanese graphics chip company S3. S3 then
sold its chip business and morphed into SonicBlue. SonicBlue declared bankruptcy
in early 2003.
DNNA was created in July 2003 (apparently by D&M Holdings Inc.) and
acquired the Rio line from the SonicBlue bankruptcy estate. Shortly thereafter, in

August 2003, DNNA announced the launch of five new MP3 players and aggressive

3

However, by summer of 2005, DNNA’s parent company announced that it

4

was selling off most of its Rio technology to SigmaTel, with most of the design and

5

technical personnel being hired by SigmaTel. DNNA has claimed that it ceased

7

as time passes beyond the completion of production by foreign-based contract

suppliers is even greater.

Before the filing of this litigation, Defendant’s counsel, Mr. Hulbert,

10

represented to Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms. Kramer, that the SigmaTel acquisition left

11

DNNA’s records in a state of disarray and represented that DNNA would have

Turnover in personnel. Plaintiff’s initial infringement notice to DNNA in

16

October 2004 went to President, Hugh Cooney, at DNNA’s Santa Clara, California

17

address. He never responded to that notice. Plaintiff made further attempts to

18

contact DNNA, finally receiving a letter from David Meisels, General Counsel for

19

D&M Holdings US, Inc. (presumably DNNA’s parent company) who advised that

20

Mr. Cooney was no longer employed by DNNA.

21

In May 2006, outside counsel for DNNA, Mr. Hulbert, sent Ms. Kramer a

22

declaration relating to a claimed cessation of sales of the accused MP3 players as of

23

September 2005 signed by Bernie Sepaniak identifying himself as President of

24

Digital Networks North America, Inc.

Despite DNNA’s claim, sales of the originally accused Rio MP3 players, and
other models that also appear to infringe, continue to be sold via DNNA’s website

whether Mr. Sepaniak even was President of DNNA or the Rio line. Kramer Decl. ¶

4

25, Exhibit H.
Additionally, public reports show that a portion of the Rio personnel were

5
6

transferred to SigmaTel, making them difficult to identify and locate.
Substantial difficulty in obtaining manufacturing information. Mr. Meisels’

7
8

February 2006 letter stated:

9

The Rio products that were formerly produced by DNNA were
manufactured overseas by third-party contract manufacturers. DNNA
has requested input from these manufacturers concerning the issues
raised in your letter as it relates to the Rio products. Communications
with overseas contract manufacturers often move slowly
notwithstanding diligent efforts. Not having continuing business with
these entities increases the difficulties.

information from these manufacturers or otherwise revealed the status of those
requests. Because Plaintiff does not know even the identity or contact information
for those companies, Plaintiff has no means of doing any independent investigation
either.
There is no reasonable assurance that records relating to the acquisition,
design, manufacture, import, and sales of the accused MP3 players will still be
available, or locatable, when reexamination of the ‘184 patent is complete. DNNA
already claims difficulty in finding records now. That situation can only get worse
over time. It is likely that all records and persons with knowledge of relevant
information will be gone and untraceable after the passage of another year or two for
the completion of the reexamination. Furthermore, if Plaintiff is unable to ascertain
the location of records of sales, it will be greatly prejudiced in its ability to prove

likely disappear as well.

3

If DNNA’s informal representations are correct, that manufacture has ceased

and that manufacture was done by overseas, third-party contract manufacturers, both

sides will suffer prejudice in preparing their infringement and non-infringement

Defendant Will Not Suffer Any Hardship If A Stay Is Not Granted
At This Stage Of The Proceedings.

“The suppliant for a stay must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in
being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which
he prays will work damage to someone else.” IMAX Corp. v. In-Three, Inc., 385
F.Supp.2d 1030, 1032 (C.D.Cal. 2005) (emphasis added) (quoting Unidisco v.
Schattner, 210 U.S.P.Q. 622, 629 (D.Md.1981) (citing Landis v. North Am. Co., 299
U.S. 248, 255, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936)).
As described above, there is a significant risk that the requested stay would
damage Plaintiff, and even possibly damage the moving party. Therefore, Defendant
DNNA must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity if no stay is ordered.
Defendant has not done so.
DNNA’s moving papers have failed to identify any particular hardship that it
would suffer as a result of no stay being granted other than things that are the natural
result of being a defendant in a patent infringement case.
DNNA cites the Bausch & Lomb case for the proposition that Defendant could
suffer irreparable harm if the Court found the patent valid and infringed, and
Defendant would pay damages that they could not recover in the event of a later
USPTO finding of invalidity. This sole claim of prejudice is entirely mooted if the

1

Court issues a partial stay, staying only claim construction and trial of the case until

2

after completion of the reexamination, while allowing discovery and other matters to

3

go forward.

4

Plaintiff is not proposing that this case progress all the way to the eve of trial,

5

or even claim construction, during the pendency of the reexamination. Rather,

6

Plaintiff agrees that expert depositions on claim construction, claim construction

7

briefing and hearing, as well as trial on infringement, can and should wait until

8

conclusion of the reexamination proceedings. However, Defendant will not suffer

9

any prejudice by filing a responsive pleading to the complaint, and responding to

10

limited discovery requests aimed at preservation of evidence. Some examples of

11

critical discovery that does not require completion of the reexamination include: (1)

12

information on the manufacturing processes used; (2) production and sales numbers;

13

and (3) the identities and locations of knowledgeable witnesses, documents and

14

physical evidence.

C.

Judicial Economy Is Best Served By Only a PARTIAL Stay Of This
Case.

Some courts have found that judicial economy does not warrant a stay pending
reexamination. Although reexamination may simplify issues for trial, it often leaves
a myriad of issues unresolved and unaddressed for long periods of time. IMAX, 385
F.Supp.2d at 1033; Telemac, 450 F.Supp.2d at 1111; Gladish v. Tyco Toys, Inc., 29
U.S.P.Q.2d 1718, 1993 WL 625509, at *2 (E.D.Cal. Sept. 15, 1993).

As some courts have noted, when reexamination potentially will
eliminate only one issue out of many, a stay is not warranted.” In
Cognex Corp. v. Nat’l Instruments Corp., No. Civ. A. 00-442-JJF,
2001 WL 34368283 (D. Del. June 29, 2001), for example, the court
concluded that a stay would not simplify the issues because the
complaint alleged “a variety of claims which are not linked to the
patent infringement claim.” Id. at *2. Similarly, in Gladish v. Tyco
Toys Inc., 1993 WL 625509, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1718, 1720
10.

(E.D.Cal.1993), the court noted that “[t]he reexamination proceeding
will not finally resolve all the issues in the litigation.” In that case,
invalidity was asserted on more grounds than prior publications and
patents, the only grounds the PTO considers during reexamination.
The court concluded that it was “the only forum for complete
consideration of ... evidence of invalidity.” Id. Because even after the
reexamination, invalidity would continue to be an issue (unless all
claims were cancelled), a stay would not preserve many resources.
Id.; see also Enprotech Corp. v. Autotech Corp., 1990 WL 37217, 15
U.S.P.Q.2d 1319, 1320 (N.D.Ill. 1990) (denying motion to stay in part
because PTO would not resolve claims of inequitable conduct).
IMAX, 385 F.Supp.2d at 1032-33.

10

There is no indication to what degree the reexamination will resolve issues in

11

dispute between the parties to this suit, if any. DNNA has not filed any answer or

12

responsive pleading (and has been granted an extension to file same). Therefore, the

13

parties and the Court do not even know if DNNA takes the position that the ‘184

14

patent is invalid (DNNA never asserted invalidity during the three-year pre-litigation

15

communications) nor on what grounds. Nor do the parties or the Court know which

16

affirmative defenses or counterclaims will be asserted in this case, if any. Given the

17

stage of the litigation, the factor of judicial economy cannot be properly weighed in

18

the analysis of whether to stay this suit.

19
20

CONCLUSION

21

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny Defendant DNNA’s motion

22

for stay as framed, require Defendants to respond to the Amended Complaint, and

23

allow the parties to conduct limited discovery to avoid the loss of necessary evidence

24

during the time that the ‘184 patent is in reexamination. The Court could then wait

25

to schedule claim construction briefing and trial for a time after the reexamination is

26

concluded. Specifically, Plaintiff requests the Court to issue an order as follows:
