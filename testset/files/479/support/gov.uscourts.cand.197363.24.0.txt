Case 3:07-cv-05568-JSW Document 24 ~ Filed 12/11/2007 Page 2of3

TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that on January 18, 2008 at 9:00 a.m., or as soon

thereafter as the matter may be heard by the above-entitled Court, defendant Digital

 

Networks North America, Inc. ("`DNNA") will and hereby does respectfully move for a stay
of the above-captioned proceeding pending the outcome of the ongoing United States
Patent & Trademark Office ("PTO") reexamination of the patent in suit, U.S. Patent No.
4,935,184 ("the `184 patent').

A stay is warranted given the current status of this case. The original Complaint
was served on November 12, 2007. An Amended Complaint was filed on November 27,
2007. Discovery has not yet begun, no trial date has been set, and the parties have not yet
submitted initial Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures. A stay will conserve the resources of both the
Court and the parties and will also provide the benefit of simplifying (if not eliminating) the
issues for trial. Given that the `184 patent will be expiring in approximately three months
and that discovery has not yet begun, Plaintiff Jens Erik Sorensen, as Trustee of Sorensen
Research and Development Trust (``Plaintiff" or "Sorensen"), would not be prejudiced in
any way by entry of an order staying the present litigation pending the PTO's ongoing
reexamination of the `184 patent. Failure to grant a stay may result in prejudice to the

Defendant.

the `184 patent.
