Case 3:07-cv-05568-JSW Document25 ~ Filed 12/11/2007 Page 5 of 14

I. ISSUE TO BE DECIDED

Whether a stay of the above-captioned proceeding should be granted pending the
ongoing United States Patent & Trademark Office ("PTO") reexamination of the patent-in-
suit, U.S. Patent No. 4,935,184 ("the `184 patent').

IH. STATEMENT OF FACTS

On November 1, 2007, Plaintiff Sorensen, as Trustee of Sorensen Research and
Development Trust ("Plaintiff? or "Sorensen") filed a Complaint for patent infringement
against Digital Networks North America, Inc. (""DNNA"), asserting the `184 patent. U.S.
District Court California Northern District (San Francisco), Civil Docket for Case #3:07-
CV-05568-JSW ("Docket"), Docket #1. The patent is set to expire in February of 2008.
(Declaration of Kurt W. Rohde ("Rohde Decl."), Exhibit E, p. 36.) Sorensen filed an
Amended Complaint on November 27. Docket No. 12. On December 3, 2007, DNNA
filed a stipulation whereby the parties agreed to extend the deadline to answer or otherwise
respond to the original complaint until January 4, 2008. Docket No. 14. Sorensen has
contended that they have properly served the Amended Complaint and that a response is
due by January 4, 2008. Prior to the original filing of the complaint, the United States
Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) had ordered that the patent-in-suit (the `184 patent)
undergo reexamination. (Rohde Decl., Exhibit C, page 11.) On October 11, 2007, the PTO
notified Sorensen that newly submitted prior art resulted in 13 new "substantial questions of
patentability" regarding the `184 patent. (Rohde Decl., Exhibit C, pages 13-24.)
Approximately three weeks later, Sorensen filed the instant patent infringement action
against DNNA asserting the `184 patent.

The request for reexamination, which prompted the reexamination order, arose after
Sorensen sued Black & Decker Corporation, among others, for infringement of the `184
patent. Jens Erik Sorensen, as Trustee of Sorensen Research and Development Trust v. The
Black & Decker Corporation, et al., Case No. 06-cv-1572 (S.D. Cal. August 7, 2006). On
July 30, 2007, Black & Decker filed the request for reexamination. (Rohde Decl., Exhibit

B, pages 3-4). The request sought reexamination of all claims of the `184 patent, except for

dependent claims 3 and 5, based on newly submitted prior art. (Rohde Decl., Exhibit B,
pages 5-7). Sorensen has never asserted claims 3 or 5, or any elements of claims 3 or 5,
against DNNA and DNNA does not believe that claims 3 and 5 are relevant to any issues in
this litigation. (Docket #1, original Complaint at 9931-56; Exhibit C of original Complaint;
Docket #12, Amended Complaint at {3 1-56; and Exhibit C of Amended Complaint).

After requesting the reexamination, Black & Decker moved to stay the litigation
with Sorensen, pending the outcome of the `184 reexamination. Sorensen contested the
motion. On September 10, 2007, the Court ordered a complete stay of all litigation
proceedings, except as to the resolution of two minor non-patent issues. (Rohde Decl.,
Exhibit E, pages 34-39.)
Il. INTRODUCTION

DNNA moves to stay the litigation pending the outcome of the PTO's
reexamination of the `184 patent. A stay will conserve the resources of both the Court and
the parties and will provide the benefit of simplifying or eliminating the issues for trial.
Given that the `184 patent will expire in less than three months independently of the
reexamination and that this litigation remains in its incipient stages, Plaintiff will not be
prejudiced in any way by entry of an order staying the present litigation pending the PTO's
ongoing reexamination of the `184 patent. Further, failure to grant a stay may result in
prejudice to the Defendant. As discussed herein, the Defendant's motion is well grounded
in both law and fact, and should therefore be granted by the Court.
IV. LEGAL STANDARD FOR A STAY PENDING PTO REEXAMINATION

A district court has the inherent power to control and manage its docket. Gould v.
Control Laser Corp., 705 F.2d 1340, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 935
(1983). This power includes the authority to order a stay pending the outcome of
reexamination proceedings in the PTO. Ethicon v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1426 (Fed. Cir.
1988); Gould, 705 F.2d at 1342. Determining whether to grant a stay pending the outcome

of the PTO's reexamination is a matter soundly within the discretion of this district court.

Case 3:07-cv-05568-JSW Document25 Filed 12/11/2007 Page 7 of 14

Photoflex Prods., Inc. v. Circa 3 LLC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37743, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal.
May 24, 2006) (White, J.).

In ruling on a motion to stay, courts generally consider: (1) whether a stay would
unduly prejudice or present a clear tactical disadvantage to the non-moving party, (2)
whether a stay will simplify the issues in question and trial of the case, and (3) whether
discovery is completed and whether a trial date has been set. Nanometrics, Inc. v. Nova
Measuring Instruments, Ltd., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXTS 18785, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 26,
2007); Photoflex Prods., Inc. v. Circa 3 LLC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37743, at *2-3 (N.D.
Cal. May 24, 2006); Target Therapeutics, Inc. v. SciMed Life Systems, Inc., 33 U.S.P.Q.2d
2022, 2023, 1995 WL 20470, at *1 (N.D. Cal. 1995). "There is a liberal policy in favor of
granting motions to stay proceedings pending the outcome of reexamination proceedings."
ASCII Corp. v. STD Entertainment USA, Inc., 844 F.Supp. 1378, 1381 (N.D. Cal. 1994);
Nanometrics, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18785, at *4; Photoflex Prods., 2006 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 37743, at *3.

`A stay is particularly justified where the outcome of the reexamination would be
likely to assist the court in determining patent validity and, if the claims were cancelled in
the reexamination, would eliminate the need to try the infringement issue." See Jn re
Cygnus Telecommunications Tech., LLC Patent Litigation, 385 F.Supp.2d 1022, 1023
(N.D. Cal. 2005). Indeed, with respect to the issue of patent claim validity, the Federal
Circuit has recognized that the reexamination procedure serves to "eliminate trial of that
issue (when the claim is cancelled) or to facilitate trial of the issue by providing a district
court with the expert view of the PTO (when a claim survives the reexamination
proceeding)." Gould, 705 F.2d at 1342.

Several additional benefits associated with staying litigation pending the PTO's
resolution of reexamination proceedings have been recognized:

1. Prior art presented to the court will have been first considered by the PTO,

with its particular expertise.

2. Many discovery problems relating to prior art can be alleviated by the PTO
examination.
3. In those cases resulting in effective invalidity of the patent, the suit will
likely be dismissed.
4. The outcome of the reexamination may encourage a settlement without the
further use of the court.
5. The record of reexamination would likely be entered at trial, thereby
reducing the complexity and length of the litigation.
6. Issues, defenses, and evidence will be more easily limited in pretrial
conferences after a reexamination.
7. The cost will likely be reduced both for the parties and the court.
Broadcast Innovation, LLC v. Charter Communs., Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46623, at
*9-10 (D.Colo. Jul. 11, 2006).

In this case, each and every relevant consideration weighs heavily in favor of
staying the present litigation pending the outcome of the PTO's reexamination of the `184
patent.

V. A STAY OF THE LITIGATION PENDING THE PTO'S REEXAMINATION

OF THE `184 PATENT IS WARRANTED

A stay in this case is particularly appropriate for at least the following reasons: (1)
Defendant's motion for a stay is timely; (2) Sorensen will not be prejudiced by a stay; (3) a
stay will simplify the issues for trial; (4) discovery has not yet begun and no trial date has
been set; and (5) a stay will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties as well as the
Court.

A. Defendant's Motion For A Stay Is Timely

Upon determining that a complaint had been filed, DNNA promptly filed this
motion to stay. This motion is clearly timely as this case is in its incipient stages. A
response to the Amended Complaint is not yet due. A stay is favored when litigation is in

its early stages. Photoflex Prods. , 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37743, at *3-4 (granting stay

following service of interrogatories and requests for production, as case was still in "early
Stages"); Target Therapeutics, 33 U.S.P.Q.2d at 2023, 1995 WL 20470, at *1 (granting
stay, as case was still in incipient stages prior to discovery or setting of trial date).

B. Plaintiff Sorensen Will Not Be Prejudiced By A Stay

Sorensen will likely suggest that he would be prejudiced by a stay due to typical
length of reexamination proceedings before the PTO or due to the progression of the
present litigation. Neither of these arguments has any merit.

Sorensen cannot be prejudiced by the length of the reexamination process within the
PTO. On October 11, 2007 the PTO determined that there is a "substantial new question of
patentability" affecting the claims of the `184 patent. (Rohde Decl., Exhibit C, page 12.)
The PTO is required to conduct all reexamination proceedings with "special dispatch." 35
U.S.C. 0x00A7 305 (1984). Such proceedings do take time - the PTO reports that the average
pendency of a reexamination proceeding is between 17 and 23 months (Rohde Decl.,
Exhibit D, page 29). However, as this court has stated, "{g]ranting a stay does not cause the
nonmoving party undue prejudice when that party has not invested substantial expense and
time in the litigation." Photoflex Prods. , 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37743, at *5. Courts have
repeatedly held that "{t]he delay inherent to the reexamination process does not constitute,
by itself, undue prejudice." Id. ; Nanometrics, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18785, at *9; KLA-
Tencor Corp. v. Nanometrics, Inc. , 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15754, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar.
16, 2006) (White, J.). Moreover, some delay in the instant litigation "is more than off-set
by increased certainty of whether this single patent will survive reexamination and whether
there will be any need for litigation." Nanometrics, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18785, at *10.

Sorensen cannot be prejudiced due to the progression of the instant litigation, as
there has been no substantial progress. Stays of litigation pending reexamination are
favored where the litigation has not progressed beyond the initial stages and where there is
an "absence of `significant discovery' or `substantial expense and time ... invested' in the
litigation." Photoflex Prods. , 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37743, at *3-4. Courts may
additionally consider evidence of dilatory motives or tactics on the part of the moving

party. Id. at 5. However, there has been no undue delay by DNNA in secking a stay. The
complaint in the instant litigation was filed on November 1, 2007, and DNNA was not
served until November 12, 2007. The Amended Complaint was filed on November 27 and
Sorensen has contended that they have properly served the Amended Complaint and that a
response is due by January 4, 2008. "This is not a case where reexamination is sought on
the eve of trial or after protracted discovery." KLA-Tencor, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15754,
at *8.

Finally, a stay would in no way prejudice Sorensen by way of damages. The `184
patent will expire in February of 2008 independently of the reexamination. Given that a
trial on the merits cannot realistically occur prior to that date, Sorensen has no entitlement
to an injunction against the Defendant. His claim is solely for past monetary damages,
which will not change regardless of whether the case is stayed at the present time.
Nanometrics, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18785, at *9. Since Plaintiff cannot realistically
obtain injunctive relief in this case, there is no potential prejudice to Sorensen from a stay.

In sum, there is no identifiable prejudice which would impact Sorensen as a result of
a stay being entered in this case. The case remains at a relatively early stage, and the
present time is appropriate for the requested stay.

Cc. Defendant DNNA May Be Prejudiced By a Failure to Enter a Stay

The Federal Circuit has recently confirmed that the determinations of this court do
not bind the PTO in its reexamination of patents. In re Trans Texas Holdings Corp. 2006-
1599 and 2006-1600, 498 F.3d 1290, 1296-1298 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 22, 2007). While this will
not prejudice the patent holder Sorensen, it may prejudice the defendant DNNA. As
explained by the court in Bausch & Lomb, Inc. v. Alcon Lab., Inc., 914 F. Supp. 951, 952
(W.D.N.Y. 1996):

Not only could the Court and the PTO reach conflicting determinations, but

one possible scenario could result in irreparable harm to [Defendant]; if this

Court finds that the [patent] is not invalid and that [Defendant] has infringed

it, and orders [Defendant] to pay damages to [Plaintiff] for such

infringement, then [Defendant] would have no ability to recover those
damages if at a later date the PTO determined that the [] patent is invalid.
