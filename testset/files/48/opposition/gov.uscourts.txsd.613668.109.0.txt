CASE NO. 1:08-CV-446

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
REGARDING RELATOR’S FALSE CLAIMS ACT CLAIMS
Plaintiff, the United States of America ex rel. Michael N. Swetnam, Jr. (“Relator”)
files this Response to Defendants Valley Baptist Health System and Valley Baptist
Medical Center’s (collectively, “VBMC” or “Defendants”) Motion for Summary
Judgment Regarding Relator’s False Claims Act Claims (the “Motion”), and in support
thereof, would show the Court as follows:
SUMMARY OF THE RESPONSE
On August 6, 2012, this Court denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment
regarding the Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), wherein Defendants argued that Relator
had no evidence that Defendants intended to induce referrals through the XOL
Program. (Doc. 70). In rejecting Defendants’ argument, the Court specifically held in its
Memorandum Opinion and Order (the “Order”) that “Relator has produced enough
evidence to convince this Court that there is an issue of material fact involved”
regarding Defendants intent to induce referrals. (Id. at 18). Now, two years later –
desperate to avoid a jury hearing the facts of the case – Defendants have filed their
instant Motion on the very same basis previously overruled by this Court – that Relator

Case 1:08-cv-00446 Document 109 Filed in TXSD on 08/21/14 Page 2 of 9

has no evidence of intent to induce referrals. Defendants offer no new legal theories or
arguments to support their Motion, hoping simply that based on the passage of time,
the Court will ignore its prior ruling that Relator has come forward with sufficient
evidence of inducement to create an issue of fact.
Accordingly, the Court should summarily deny Defendants’ Motion based on its
prior Order.

Indeed, the evidence the Court relied on then – Relator’s testimony

contained in his Declaration – has not changed, and such testimony alone, as the Court
previously held, is sufficient to defeat summary judgment.

Further, any contrary

evidence Defendants highlight to demonstrate their purported lack of intent to induce
referrals simply goes to the credibility and weight of Relator’s testimonial evidence, not
its sufficiency to create a fact issue under Rule 56. Finally, in addition to his testimony,
Relator has come forward with additional evidence showing Defendants’ intent to
induce referrals through the XOL Program. Defendants’ Motion, therefore, must be
denied.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate only if no genuine issue of material fact exists
and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c).
“Under Rule 56(c), the moving party bears the initial burden of ‘informing the district
court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it
believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.’” Employers Ins. Co.
v. Penn-America Ins. Co., 705 F.Supp.2d 696, 704 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (quoting Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)). “When the moving party has met its Rule 56(c) burden
. . . the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing
that there is a genuine issue of trial. Id. (citing Duffie v. United States, 600 F.3d 362, 37071 (5th Cir. 2010)). To that end, “there must be evidence on which the jury could
reasonably find for the plaintiff.” Id. “In deciding a summary judgment motion, the
court reviews the facts drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to
the nonmovant.” Id. (citing Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.3d 219, 229 (5th Cir.
2010)). The Court may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.
Harvill v. Westward Communications, L.L.C., 433 F.3d 428, 436 (5th Cir. 2005)
ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES
I.

This Court Previously Held that Relator Has Produced Enough Evidence to
Create an Issue of Material Fact on the Issue of Defendants’ Intent to Induce
Referrals.
In order to prove a violation of the AKS, a party must show that the defendant

“knowingly and willfully made a payment or offer of payment as an inducement to the
payee to refer an individual to another for the furnishing of an item or service that
could be paid for by a federal healthcare program.” United States v. Miles, 360 F.3d 472,
479 – 80 (5th Cir. 2004); see also 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b). As such, a relator in a qui tam
case must show that defendant “(1) caused claims to be submitted to the Government;
3

Case 1:08-cv-00446 Document 109 Filed in TXSD on 08/21/14 Page 4 of 9

(2) remunerated physicians with a purpose to induce referrals; and (3) knew that its
actions violated the AKS.” United States ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Centers of Am.,
565 F. Supp. 2d 153, 160 (D.C. 2008).
“Though lacking a ‘smoking gun’, [a] relator[] may survive summary judgment
if [he has] produced sufficient circumstantial evidence to create a jury question as to
whether defendant violated the AKS.” Id. at 162. In that regard, “[r]elator is under no
burden to prove with absolute certainty his claims.” Id. at 166. As mandated by the
rules of summary judgment, the Court’s analysis must be “based on the facts as viewed
in a light favorable to relator, and all justifiable inferences are drawn in his favor.” Id.
Citing Pogue1, this Court held in its prior Order that Relator had produced
enough evidence to create an issue of material fact regarding Defendants’ intent to
induce referrals. (Doc. 70 at 15 – 18). This evidence consisted of testimony contained in
Relator’s Supplemental Declaration (Doc. 54). In their Motion, Defendants make the
false assertion that the Court relied on only one statement from the Supplemental
Declaration to reach its decision – an alleged explicit admission from Defendants’ CEO
Ben McKibbens that the XOL Program was good because it helped with patient
referrals. (Mot. at 9). In fact, the Court also relied on several additional points of
testimony from the Supplemental Declaration, including:
-

that the XOL Program’s coverage benefit was offered only with respect
to patients who were admitted to Defendants’ hospital;

-

that the XOL Program was used to recruit new physicians to become
members of VBMC staff, often from other valley-area hospitals; and

1

Defendants’ attempt to use Pogue to support its flawed argument is baffling and erroneous. (Mot. at 78). Contrary to Defendants’ seeming contention, Pogue does not provide a checklist of evidence a plaintiff
must provide to defeat summary judgment on the inducement factor of an AKS claim. To the contrary,
and as the Court correctly noted in its Order, Pogue stands for the proposition that, as here, a Relator may
defeat summary judgment based on sufficient circumstantial evidence of the inducement factor, despite
lacking a “smoking gun.” Pogue, 565 F. Supp. 2d at 162. Defendants’ Motion - just as its previously
denied motion – is based on the erroneous argument that Relator lacks a smoking gun in this case.

-

that Medicare and Medicaid referrals increased after initiation of the
XOL Program, as did physician enrollment and patient referrals.

(Doc. 70 at 17 (citing Doc. 54 at ¶¶ 23, 28, 31-32)). This evidence, taken as a whole, was
enough to “convince the court that there is an issue of material fact involved.” (Id. at
18). This evidence has not changed, and Relator will provide this exact same testimony
at trial.2
In hopes that the Court will reverse its prior decision, Defendants’ point to an
email sent by Relator wherein he purportedly admitted that “’[t]he hospital’s XOL
Program was never based upon the physician’s referral of any patient to the hospital
facility.”

(Mot. at 9 (citing Ex. B)).

Defendants contend that Relator’s previous

summary judgment evidence (i.e. his Supplemental Declaration) should be
“disregarded” because of this alleged admission. (Id. at 8 – 9). Defendants’ argument
fails for several reasons.
To begin, Defendants’ fail to tell the whole story regarding the email in question.
As Relator states in his Second Declaration attached to this Response, Exhibit B to
Defendants’ Motion is an email he sent to Patsy Nichols on May 11, 1998. (Ex. B at ¶ 2).
Ms. Nichols was one of Defendants’ attorneys at that time, practicing in Fulbright &
Jaworski’s Austin office (Id.). The email to Ms. Nichols was drafted and sent at
Defendants’ direction during the time in which Defendants were trying to organize
their HMO insurance coverage. (Id. at ¶ 3). The Defendants’ CEO, Ben McKibbens,
specifically told Relator that he expected VBMC’s insurance agents (including me) to
support the hospital’s position with respect to the XOL Program. (Id.). Defendants’
position was that the XOL Program was legal, and Mr. McKibbens wanted VBMC’s
attorneys and insurance agents to support that position. (Id.). As previously set forth in

2

Defendants have yet to take Relator’s deposition.

5

Case 1:08-cv-00446 Document 109 Filed in TXSD on 08/21/14 Page 6 of 9

Relator’s Supplemental Declaration, Defendants’ intent in implementing the XOL
Program was to remunerate physicians with a purpose to induce referrals. (Id. at ¶ 4).
Defendants cannot cite to any case or rule of civil procedure to support their
contention that Relator’s prior Supplemental Declaration testimony should be
disregarded by the Court due to the language contained in the 1998 email. Indeed,
none exists. In reality, what Defendants are asking the Court to do is play they role of
fact-finder and weigh the evidence. But as the Court stated in its prior Order, “[i]t is not
the Court’s duty to weigh the evidence at the summary judgment phase.” (Doc. 70 at
18). As such, “[t]he decision of whether Defendants actually initiated the XOL Program
to induce referrals or did so solely to protect themselves should be left to the factfinder.” (Id.). Defendants will have ample opportunity to cross-examine Relator both
during his deposition and at trial regarding the 1998 email. It is for the jury to weigh
that evidence against Relator’s testimony and other evidence regarding Defendants’
intent regarding the XOL Program.3 Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion must be denied.
II.

Additional Evidence Supports the Court’s Conclusion that an Issue of Material
Facts Exists on the Issue of Defendants’ Intent to Induce Referrals.
As the Court held in its prior Order, Relator has already come forward with

sufficient evidence regarding Defendants’ intent to induce referrals through the XOL
Program to create an issue of material fact and defeat summary judgment. (Doc. 70 at
18).

Nevertheless, since that time, Relator has discovered additional documentary

evidence that further supports his testimony regarding Defendants’ intent to induce
referrals through the XOL Program. That evidence consists of the following:
3

Defendants also highlight depositions taken of certain former executives of VBMC, including Beverly
Ferrell and James Springfield, wherein they testified that the intent of the XOL Program was not to
induce referrals. (Mot. at 10 – 11). But this testimony does not extinguish Relator’s testimony to the
contrary. Here again, Defendants improperly ask the Court to weigh the evidence. In any event, it is not
surprising that these witnesses would deny violating federal criminal law. Further, despite repeated
requests, Defendants so far have refused to produce Ben McKibbens and current corporate
representatives for deposition. As such, Relator recently filed his Motion to Compel. (Doc. 107).

Meeting minutes dated July 13, 1993 from VBMC Insurance and
Claims Management Committee Board of Trustees, stating that as a
result of the XOL Program "the medical center will be provided
benefits in regard to physician retention, recruitment, collaboration
and more physician involvement in risk management. The medical
center will also incur increased premium expenses and in increase
in assumption of risk for the coinsurance and deductibles . . . ." (Ex.
C (emphasis added)).

-

Meeting minutes dated July 16, 1993 from VBMC Special Meeting
regarding Physician’s Liability Insurance Proposal, stating that the
XOL Program "does not cover physicians at other hospitals" [i.e.,
physicians have to bring their patients to VBMC to be covered by
this increased free insurance], "may result in additional physicians
becoming active staff members”, and that "additional ER Pool
Physicians should result in better recruiting.” (Ex. D (emphasis
added)).

-

VBMC Medical Staff Development Update dated April 22, 2002,
graphically showing the ever-increasing patient discharges for
VBMC from 1995-2000 (years during XOL Plan's existence); the
ever-increasing number of VBMC physicians from 1992 through
2002, and the net changes by year; and the ever-increasing patient
and inpatient numbers from 1997 through 2001. (Ex. E at 10-12, 22).

In addition, Relator’s damages expert, Paul C. Benoit, includes a table in his expert
report showing the vast increase in VBMC physicians subsequent to the
implementation of the XOL Program, from 1994 through 2003. (Ex. F at 16, Table 1). All
of this evidence directly ties in and supports Relator’s testimony regarding Defendants’
intent to induce referrals through the XOL Program.
Citing Polk County v. Peters, 800 F. Supp. 1451, 1454 (E.D. Tex. 1992), Defendants
argue that physician recruitment and retention, in and of itself, does not satisfy the
requisite intent to induce referrals. (Mot. at 12-13). While in a vacuum this may be true,
such facts do constitute strong circumstantial evidence that Defendants’ intent
implementing the XOL Program was to induce referrals. See Pogue, 565 F. Supp. 2d at
162. Quite logically, more recruited and retained physicians means more referrals to
VBMC. Further, Defendants claim that Polk, “provides an example of what Relator
must show to prove that physician recruitment or retention violates the AKS.” (Mot. at
7

Case 1:08-cv-00446 Document 109 Filed in TXSD on 08/21/14 Page 8 of 9

12 (emphasis added)). Although Relator disagrees with the premise of that statement, it
is irrelevant for purposes of summary judgment because Relator is not required to
prove his case at this stage. Defendants’ slip of the pen in this regard further illustrates
their improper attempt to have the Court play the role of the fact-finder and weigh the
evidence.
Accordingly, as the Court previously had held even absent such additional
evidence, “Relator has presented sufficient evidence to survive the summary judgment
motion as to the AKS-based claims.” (Doc. 70 at 18). Defendants’ Motion, therefore,
must be denied.
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that Defendants’ Motion be denied, and that
Plaintiff be granted such other and further relief to which he may be justly entitled.
