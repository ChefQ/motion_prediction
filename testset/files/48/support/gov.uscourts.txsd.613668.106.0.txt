DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
REGARDING RELATOR’S FALSE CLAIMS ACT CLAIMS
Defendants, Valley Baptist Health System (“VBHS”) and Valley Baptist Medical Center
(“VBMC”) (collectively, “Valley Baptist” or “Defendants”), file this Motion for Summary
Judgment Regarding Relator’s False Claims Act Claims (“Motion”) and in support thereof would
show the Court as follows:
I. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1.

Relator has prosecuted this case—in which the Government declined to

intervene—under a theory that Valley Baptist violated the False Claims Act (“FCA”)1 by falsely
certifying in its Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement requests that it complied with the AntiKickback Statute (“AKS”).2 Relator claims that Valley Baptist violated the AKS because the
medical services for which Valley Baptist sought reimbursement were provided through an
illegal kickback scheme—the XOL Program—that Valley Baptist instituted with the intent to
induce patient referrals.3 However, Relator’s claim is without merit because:



Relator admitted the “XOL Program was never based upon the physician’s
referral of any patient” to VBMC;



Despite engaging in two years’ worth of voluminous written discovery and taking
the depositions of 5 “key” witnesses, Relator lacks any evidence that XOL
Program’s purpose was to induce referrals; and



Because Relator lacks any evidence that Valley Baptist instituted the XOL
Program with the intent to induce referrals, Relator will likely claim that XOL
Program violates the AKS because it benefitted Valley Baptist with physician
recruitment and retention. However, recruitment and retention, without the
requisite intent to induce a referral, is not an AKS violation.

Because an AKS violation is a necessary component of Relator’s FCA claims, and because that
claim fails, Relator’s FCA claims also fail. For these reasons, Valley Baptist is entitled to
summary judgment.
II. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
2.

The Court is familiar with the facts underlying Relator’s lawsuit.4 Therefore,

Valley Baptist only includes those additional facts that are necessary to resolve the underlying
Motion.
A. The XOL Program’s implementation
3.

In 1993, Valley Baptist implemented the XOL Program in response to malpractice

and insurance crisis that then existed in the Rio Grande Valley.5 Simply stated, the XOL
Program provided physicians that enrolled in the program an excess layer of insurance
($300,000/$900,000) so long as the physicians met certain requirements. These requirements
included a requirement that the physician:
1. obtain and pay for a primary layer of coverage in the minimum amount of
$200,000/$600,000;
2. participate in any medical staff or Valley Baptist quality assurance activities as
assigned;

3. participate on the emergency call roster without compensation and treat any
emergency patient regardless of insurance coverage; and
4. complete all patient medical records within thirty days of discharge.6
B. Relator’s statement that the XOL Program’s intent was not to induce
referrals
4.

In 1998, Smith Raegan, Valley Baptist’s long-time insurance agent, corresponded

with Fulbright & Jaworski regarding certain tax issues surrounding the XOL Program.7
Importantly, and as it relates to the claims Relator is now trying to make, Relator expressly
stated:
The hospital’s XOL program was never based upon the physician’s referral of
any patient to the hospital facility. It was based and conditioned upon each
participating physician’s agreement to do three items: 1) provide “on-call” in the
hospital’s emergency room; 2) to complete the patient’s medical records within
(30) days of the patient’s discharge date; and 3) to participate in the hospital’s
Q/A programs.8
C. This Court’s August 6, 2012 Memorandum Opinion and Order
5.

As the Court is aware, in July of 2011, Valley Baptist moved for summary

judgment on Relator’s Stark, Anti-Kickback and two of Relator’s FCA claims.9 At that time,
Relator claimed that—after almost three years of litigation—he had not been given an adequate
opportunity to engage in discovery, including being “unable to depose key individuals who could
shed light on the [AKS] intent issue.”10 The Court granted Valley Baptist’s motions with respect
to Relator’s Stark claim and one of Relator’s three FCA claims.11 The Court—relying solely on

Relator’s Declaration—found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as the other FCA claim
on which Valley Baptist sought summary judgment.12
D. Relator’s extensive discovery since the August 6, 2012 Memorandum
Opinion and Order
6.

Since 2011, Relator has engaged in extensive discovery on his claims. For

example, Relator served on Valley Baptist at least 8 different sets of requests for production
comprising approximately 234 separate requests.13 Relator also served Valley Baptist with 20
separate interrogatories.14 In response to Relator’s discovery requests, Valley Baptist produced to
Relator more than 6,500 documents.15 In addition, Relator has had the opportunity to depose the
following “key” individuals about his claims:


Dr. Rella Adams (Valley Baptist’s former Senior Vice President of Nursing);



Beverly Farrell (Valley Baptist’s former Risk Manager);



William Morgan Hay (Valley Baptist’s former Vice President of Finance);



Dr. Eric Six (Valley Baptist’s former Medical Director); and



James Springfield (Valley Baptist’s former CEO).16

Drs. Adams and Six served in the above roles at Valley Baptist during the entire period of the
XOL Program.17 These individuals would logically be two of the best positioned Valley Baptist
employees to offer evidence on the issue of whether the XOL Program’s intent was to induce
patient referrals, yet neither was asked that question.18 This is not surprising as both would have

testified just as Relator himself stated in 1998—“The hospital’s XOL Program was never based
upon the physician’s referral of any patient to the hospital facility.”19
III. ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
7.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, Valley Baptist moves for

summary judgment on Swetnam’s remaining claims because there is no genuine issue of material
fact that Valley Baptist did not institute the XOL Program with the intent to induce referrals.
A.

Summary Judgment Standard.

8.

“The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no

genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a
matter of law.”20 “A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support
the assertion by citing to particular parts of materials in the record . . . .”21 “[T]he plain language
of Rule 56[] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and
upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of
an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at
trial.”22
9.

“Initially, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a

genuine issue of material fact.”23 If the burden of proof at trial lies with the non-moving party,
the movant may satisfy its initial burden by “‘showing’—that is, pointing out to the district
court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party’s case.”24 While the

party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of
material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant’s case.25
10.

“When the moving party has met its Rule 56[] burden, the nonmoving party

cannot survive a summary judgment motion by resting on the mere allegation of its pleadings.”26
The nonmovant must identify specific evidence in the record and articulate how that evidence
supports that party’s claim.27 “This burden will not be satisfied by ‘some metaphysical doubt as
to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a
scintilla of evidence.’”28
B.

To recover on his FCA claims, Relator must prove Valley Baptist violated the
AKS.

11.

This Court has previously granted summary judgment as to Relator’s Stark Claim

and one of Relator’s three FCA claims.29 Relator’s only remaining claims are that Valley Baptist
violated sections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the FCA.30 Those sections establish liability for any person
who:
(1) knowingly presents, or cause to be presented, to an officer or employee of the
United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or
approval; (2) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false
record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the
Government.31
A claim can meet the falsity requirement if it is either factually false or legally false.32 “It may be
factually false if it incorrectly describes the goods or services provided or a request for goods or

services provided, or it may be legally false because of an express false certification or an
implied false certification.”33
12.

Here, to identify purportedly legally false claims, Relator attempts to derive

falsity from the documents Valley Baptist submitted to Medicare and Medicaid wherein it
requested reimbursement for the medical services it rendered to low income and elderly
patients.34 Relator claims these reimbursement requests were false because Valley Baptist
certified that it had complied with applicable laws and regulations when, in fact, it had not done
so.35 Specifically, Relator claims Valley Baptist falsely certified compliance with the AKS.36
According to Relator, Valley Baptist violated the AKS because the XOL Program’s purpose was
to induce referrals to VBMC, which the AKS prohibits. 37 Therefore, to prove the falsity element
of his FCA claims, Relator must first prove Valley Baptist violated the AKS—i.e., that the XOL
Program’s purpose was to induce referrals.
C.

There is no genuine issue of material fact that the XOL Program’s purpose
was not to induce referrals to VBMC.

13.

As the Court recognized in its August 8, 2012 Memorandum Opinion and Order,

to establish that Valley Baptist violated the AKS—and hence the FCA—“Relator must show that
Defendants … remunerated physicians with a purpose to induce referrals….”38 The case on
which the Court relies for this statement—United States ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment
Centers of America—is illustrative on this issue.39 In Pogue, the Government alleged that the
defendant induced its medical directors to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims in
33

Id. The Fifth Circuit, however, has not adopted an implied false certification theory. See United States ex rel.
Steury v. Cardinal Health, Inc., 625 F.3d 262, 268-69 (5th Cir. 2010).

violation of AKS by tying the medical directors’ remuneration to the number of referrals the
medical directors provided to the defendant’s treatment center.40 In that case, the court concluded
that the following evidence was sufficient to impose liability under the AKS:

14.



The medical directors’ performance was evaluated, in part, by the medical
directors’ referral sources to the defendant treatment center;



The medical directors’ contracts required the medical directors to identify and
develop referral sources for the defendant treatment center;



The defendant treatment center had the right to terminate the medical directors’
contracts in the event the medical directors did not meet the contractual referral
requirements;



The medical directors were compensated more for referring patients to
defendant’s facilities;



The defendant treatment center focused on referral numbers when conducting
contract negotiations with medical directors and hospitals; and



At least one witness testified that the program’s purpose was to induce referrals.41
Here, unlike in Pogue, there is no evidence that the XOL Program’s purpose was

to induce patient referrals. In fact, and as set forth above, Relator himself admits the XOL
Program’s purpose was not to induce referrals.42 Rather, the undisputed facts show that Valley
Baptist instituted the XOL Program in an attempt to find adequate malpractice insurance
coverage for its physicians.43
i.

Relator’s previous summary judgment evidence should be disregarded in light of
Relator’s admission that the “XOL Program was never based upon the physician’s
referral of any patient” to VBMC.

15.

Because Relator has had an adequate time to conduct discovery on his claims, the

Court should not allow Relator to survive summary judgment on the unsupported beliefs and
conjecture contained in the Declaration he signed in response to Valley Baptist’s previous

Motions for Summary Judgment. With that Declaration, the Court concluded that a fact issue
existed because Relator’s “declaration includes an (alleged) explicit admission from Defendants’
CEO that the XOL Program was good because it helped with patient referrals.”44 That statement,
however, says nothing about Valley Baptist’s intent with respect the XOL Program. Rather,
assuming it is true, the statement merely addresses that the XOL Program “helped” with patient
referrals. That statement does not show that Valley Baptist “knowingly and willfully” instituted
the XOL Program with the intent to induce referrals, as is required under the AKS.45
16.

What the evidence does show is that inducing referrals was not Valley Baptist’s

intent. For example, and as set forth above, in response to a letter from Valley Baptist’s counsel,
Relator admitted “[t]he hospital’s XOL [P]rogram was never based upon the physician’s referral
of any patient to the hospital facility.”46 As discussed below, Relator’s admission is supported by
other evidence. Because Relator admitted that Valley Baptist did not institute the XOL Program
with the intent to induce referrals, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Valley
Baptist violated the AKS.
ii.

Despite the voluminous discovery and depositions that have taken place, there is
no evidence that Valley Baptist instituted the XOL Program to induce referrals to
VBMC.

17.

As the Court noted in its Memorandum Opinion and Order more than two years

ago, Relator claimed that he had not been given an ample opportunity to conduct discovery on
his claims.47 Since them, Relator has engaged in extensive discovery by:


serving on Valley Baptist no less than 8 sets requests for production comprising 234
separate requests for documents.



serving on Valley Baptist no less than 20 interrogatories; and



deposing no less than five “key” current or former Valley Baptist employees with
knowledge of the XOL Program.48

In response to Relator’s discovery requests, Valley Baptist produced to Relator more than 6,500
documents.49 Surprisingly, none of Relator’s requests for production or interrogatories inquire
about or relate to Valley Baptist’s intent to induce referrals under the XOL Program.
18.

With respect to the depositions that Relator requested of Valley Baptist’s “key”

witnesses, none of these deponents testified that the XOL Program’s purpose was to induce
referrals to Valley Baptist. In fact, Relator’s counsel only asked two of the five witnesses about
the XOL Program’s purpose, and neither witness testified that the purpose was to induce
referrals. For example, Valley Baptist’s former Risk Manager, Beverly Ferrell, testified as
follows:
Relator’s counsel:

Can you explain for the jury what the purpose or benefit of
the XOL program was?

Ms. Ferrell:

If memory serves me, the – what we’re calling XOL is a
layer of insurance.

Relator’s counsel:

Okay.

Ms. Ferrell:

And if that – there was an insurance – we called it a crisis
in Texas regarding the physicians – at one point in time the
insurance for physicians became prohibitively costly and
some of them for certain specialties, it was very expensive
and I can’t tell you what – how relative that is. I don’t
know what the dollar amounts are but in their opinion it
was too expensive and then it became not the affordability
side of it but availability.50

…
Relator’s counsel:

Thank you. Now, the XOL Program changed that or
modified that coverage in what way?

Ms. Ferrell:

It was an additional insurance. After they had exhausted in
one claim that amount of $200,000, then this policy that the
hospital was paying for provided by an insurance carrier
was going to step in and pay the next 300,000 up to a
maximum of 500,000 for any one claim.51

…
Relator’s counsel:

Well, I’m asking you. Whether it says that or now, that was
– that was the benefit, the purpose, the function.

Ms. Ferrell:

Not to save doctor’s money. It was so they could get it. It
was availability at that point. We never did anything
because the physicians said it was not affordable.52

Likewise, James Springfield, Valley Baptist’s former CEO, never testified that the XOL
Program’s purpose was to induce referrals. Instead, as the following passage shows, Mr.
Springfield testified that he did not recall certain benefits that Relator’s counsel suggested Valley
Baptist was intending with the XOL Program:
Relator’s counsel:

In fact, at least two of the stated benefits that Valley Baptist
was intending or was actually receiving from the XOL
Program were physician retention and physician
recruitment, correct?

Ms. Springfield:

… I don’t recall that.53

19.

Put simply, after multiple rounds of written discovery to Valley Baptist and third

parties, the production of more than 6,500 documents of data, and the opportunity to take the
depositions the “key” witnesses with knowledge of the XOL Program, Relator has no evidence
to support any reasonable and legitimate basis that Valley Baptist’s intent for the XOL Program
was to induce referrals.

iii.

Because Relator lacks any evidence that Valley Baptist instituted the XOL
Program with the intent to induce referrals, Relator will likely claim that XOL
Program violates the AKS because it benefitted Valley Baptist with physician
recruitment and retention. However, recruitment and retention, without the
requisite intent to induce a referral, is not an AKS violation.

20.

Because there is no evidence that Valley Baptist instituted the XOL Program to

induce referrals, Relator will likely claim the XOL Program violates the AKS because it
benefitted Valley Baptist with physician recruitment and retention. Accepting as true that the
XOL Program aided in physician recruitment and retention, that evidence, alone, does not
impose liability under the AKS because it does not show Valley Baptist’s intent. The AKS “is
aimed at the inducement factor.”54 That is to support an AKS violation, Relator must show that
Valley Baptist offered the XOL Program to induce patient referrals.55
21.

Polk County v. Peters provides an example of what Relator must show to prove

that physician recruitment or retention violates the AKS.56 In Polk, a hospital brought suit against
a physician in an attempt to recover money advanced pursuant to a recruiting contract between
the physician and the hospital’s predecessor-in-interest.57 The hospital claimed that the
recruitment contract should not be enforced because it violated the AKS.58 The court found the
recruitment contract violated the AKS because the hospital clearly and explicitly intended to
induce referrals because the recruitment contract required the physician to refer patients to it.59
Here, the contrary is true. The XOL Program said nothing about patient referrals, did not require
any physician to refer a patient to Valley Baptist, and the physician received the XOL coverage

even if he or she referred no patients to Valley Baptist.60 That aside, evidence relating to
physician recruitment or retention is a red herring. That is, it does not show that the XOL
Program was implemented with the intent to induce patient referrals to the hospital. Because
there is still no evidence of the intent to induce a referral, the fact that the XOL Program
benefitted physician recruitment and retention is not an AKS violation.
D.

Despite Relator’s claims, the evidence shows Valley Baptist instituted the
XOL Program to address the lack of adequate malpractice insurance.

22.

Relator suggests—without any evidence—that Valley Baptist instituted the XOL

Program with the intent to induce patient referrals.61 However, the evidence shows that is not
correct. For example, as discussed above, Ms. Ferrell testified that Valley Baptist instituted the
XOL Program to address the malpractice insurance “crisis” that physicians were experiencing.62
Ms. Ferrell’s testimony—and Valley Baptist’s intentions—are further bolstered by the recorded
minutes of a meeting wherein Valley Baptist discussed the hospital’s need to assist physicians
with finding malpractice insurance and Kevin G. McAnaney’s Declaration. In the meeting
minutes—which were taken before the XOL Program was instituted—nowhere does it mention
that the XOL Program should put in place because it will induce referrals.63 Rather, the minutes
specifically reference the need for Valley Baptist to assist physicians to find adequate
malpractice insurance.64 Likewise, in his declaration, Mr. McAnaney states that “[t]he XOL
Program was adopted in response to the reported difficulties of VBMC medical staff in obtaining
sufficient malpractice coverage to meet the medical staff requirements at a reasonable cost.”65
Indeed, Mr. McAnaney further states that the XOL Program was not unique and that the Office
