RE:  Rakeman, et al. v. MLD Mortgage Inc., et al.; 16-CV-00453 (JFB)(GRB)
Honorable Sir:

This office represents the Plaintiffs in the above-referenced matter. Pursuant to Section ITI(B) of
Your Honor's Individual Practice Rules, kindly accept this correspondence as the Plaintiffs'
response and partial opposition to the March 30, 2017 letter motion of Defendants' counsel,
Thomas D. Gearon, Esq., to be relieved as counsel. [D.E. 24].

The Plaintiffs only oppose the portion of the letter motion in which Defendants request that the
Court issue an Order staying the proceedings for sixty (60) days. A sixty-day stay of the
proceedings is not warranted and would only result in further prejudice to the Plaintiffs who have
already experienced undue delay, through no fault of their own, in moving forward with the
Settlement Conference and discovery in this action. Further, it is my understanding that Defendants
have already retained substitute counsel. As such, Defendants do not need any longer than the
customary thirty-day period as an accommodation.

Accordingly, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny the portion of Defendants'
letter motion seeking a sixty-day stay of these proceedings.

   

ime and attention to this matter.

  

We thank the Court

ce: Thomas Gearon, Esq.
