PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
REQUESTING AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff, Malibu Media, LLC (“Plaintiff”), respectfully requests this Court deny Defendant’s
Motion Requesting an Evidentiary Hearing. First, there are no questions of fact that require this
Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing because Defendant has already testified that he
committed spoliation. Second, allowing Defendant’s friends to testify regarding the content of
the destroyed hard drive would in effect reward Defendant for his act of spoliation. In other
words, despite having destroyed his hard drive, and any incriminating evidence thereon,
Defendant will now be able to present the self-serving testimony of his friends as to what was on
the drive. In sum, having destroyed key evidence, Defendant now seeks to “re-create” it on his
own terms. Clearly, the Court should see through this ploy and deny Defendant’s request.
Defendant’s actions have prevented Plaintiff from inspecting a potentially critical piece of
evidence and caused irreparable harm to Plaintiff’s case. The testimony of Defendant’s friends
is no substitute. For the foregoing reasons, as explained more fully below, this Court should
deny Defendant’s Motion.

II.

ARGUMENT
a. There Are No Questions Of Fact Because Defendant Has Already Testified
To His Spoliation Of Evidence

An evidentiary hearing is not necessary because there are no material issues of fact that
require a hearing. Under LR 7-5(d)(1), the Court may “grant or deny a request for oral argument
or an evidentiary hearing in its sole discretion.” Courts in the Seventh Circuit have held
evidentiary hearings in the spoliation context to determine fact issues, such as: (1) whether
evidence was missing, (2) whether there was alternative information available to the opposing
party; and (3) whether or not evidence was tampered with. See, e.g., Gilbane Bldg. Co. v.
Downers Grove Cmty. High Sch. Dist. No. 99, 2005 WL 838679 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (holding an
evidentiary hearing to determine if evidence was missing, if there were alternate sources of
information available, and whether the evidence was necessary for an expert to formulate an
opinion); Oleksy v. Gen. Elec. Co., 2014 WL 3820352 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (holding an evidentiary
hearing to determine whether industry standards required GM to preserve evidence and whether
spoliation occurred); Exe v. Fleetwood RV, Inc., 2013 WL 2145595 (N.D. Ind. 2013) (holding an
evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not a party tampered with a bolt to a mobile home
during an inspection). Such is not the case here. Defendant’s testimony clearly establishes that
he committed spoliation, and did so in bad faith, warranting severe sanctions. Defendant has
testified to the following facts:
In October of 2012, Defendant received a notice from Comcast
announcing that Plaintiff filed this lawsuit for online copyright
infringement and that he had been identified as the alleged infringer. See
CM/ECF 237-1 at 15:20-25; 16:1-6; CM/ECF 237-6.
In January of 2013, instead of saving the hard drive to his gaming
computer, Defendant took the drive to his old employer to recycle it. See
CM/ ECF 237-1 at15:17-19; 16:7-18.
2

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 258 Filed 10/20/14 Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 1952

The recycling company crushed and then melted the hard drive. Id. at
15:17-19; 16:7-18.
There are no records and no copies of this hard drive. Id. at 18:12-25.
Defendant used this hard drive during the time of the infringement. See
CM/ECF 237-2, Response ¶4.
Defendant subsequently failed to disclose the existence of the hard drive
in his responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories. See CM/ECF 237-2.
Defendant failed to indicate that the hard drive was destroyed, as
instructed to do so by Plaintiff’s request for production. See CM/ECF
237-3 and 237-4.
Defendant produced only a single receipt—indicating a new hard drive
had been purchased in the name of a third party. See CM/ECF 237-7.
Based on these facts, (1) Defendant was on notice of the lawsuit, and therefore, he had a duty
to preserve evidence; (2) Defendant breached this duty when he destroyed the hard drive; and (3)
Defendant acted in bad faith as evidenced by his failure to disclose the hard drive in his
discovery responses and his efforts to avoid purchasing a new hard drive in his own name. Thus,
as a matter of law, Defendant committed spoliation; the spoliation was committed in bad faith
and requires severe sanctions. An evidentiary hearing is not necessary and would waste judicial
resources and time.
b. Allowing Witnesses To Testify Regarding The Contents Of The Destroyed
Hard Drive Defeats The Purpose of Spoliation Sanctions
“[S]anctions are intended to serve one or more of the following purposes: (1) to ameliorate
the prejudice caused to an innocent party by a discovery violation; (2) to punish the party who
violates his or her obligations; and/or (3) to deter others from committing like violations.” Danis
v. USN Commc'ns, Inc., 2000 WL 169, at *31 (N.D. Ill. 2000). Allowing witnesses to testify as
to the contents of the destroyed hard drive defeats all three purposes of imposing sanctions and
allows Defendant to benefit from his own wrongdoing.
3

First, witness testimony cannot

Case 1:12-cv-01117-WTL-MJD Document 258 Filed 10/20/14 Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 1953

ameliorate the prejudiced caused to Plaintiff by Defendant’s destruction of the hard drive.
Witness testimony is no substitute for a computer expert’s forensic examination of the hard
drive, which may have reveal additional devices, evidence of BitTorrent use, or copies of Malibu
movies themselves. Moreover, allowing witness testimony following Defendant’s spoliation
effectively allows Defendant to manufacture his own “replacement” evidence.
Second, sanctions are intended to punish Defendant for his wrongful actions. By allowing
witnesses to testify, Defendant escapes the repercussions of his actions. Defendant denied
Plaintiff the opportunity to inspect the hard drive, and in return, now seeks to present one-sided
evidence about the contents of the drive he destroyed in the first place. Allowing such testimony
doesn’t punish Defendant; it lets him off scot-free.
Third, if Defendant is allowed to present evidence regarding the content of the spoiled drive,
other defendants will follow suit and adopt the erroneous position that destruction of evidence is
not to be taken seriously so long as some witness can testify as to some of the destroyed
contents. The take-away from granting Defendant’s request would be a dangerous one, i.e., if
caught committing online infringement, just destroy your computer and have your friends come
in and testify about its contents. This obviously should not stand.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court deny Defendant’s

Motion.
DATED: October 20, 2014.
