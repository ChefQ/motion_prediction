STATEMENT OF NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff Donald M. Durkin (“Durkin”) has requested sanctions related to the City of
Newark’s production of documents, filing a Motion, Opening Brief and Supplemental Brief.
Newark filed an Answering Brief and this is its Supplemental Answering Brief.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Newark’s obligation to provide attorney-client privileged documents did not arise until
the privilege was waived, as ruled by the Court on September 12, 2006. Newark’s obligation to
provide documents withheld under the joint-defense privilege did not arise until the privilege no
longer applied, which occurred on September 5, 2006. Newark provided such documents within
one week of the Court’s order. The documents highlighted by Durkin are irrelevant to Newark’s
counterclaim.
The recent production contains only one new, relevant document and the explanation for
its absence in previous productions has a reasonable explanation.
Newark’s good-faith compliance with the Court’s order makes punitive dismissal
completely inappropriate. Durkin has not remotely satisfy the criteria to such a drastic sanction.
In fact, Durkin itself has failed to produce certain documents and never produced a privilege log.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Newark incorporates herein the statement of facts set forth in its Answering Brief.

ARGUMENT
A.

THE RECENT DOCUMENT PRODUCTION ONLY
CONTAINS ONE NEW RELEVANT DOCUMENT AND
THE EXPLANATION IS REASONABLE

There is a credible explanation for the documents discovered on September 22, 2006: the
documents were in a folder marked “RFP Reservoir” and contained proposals submitted by
various engineering firms in 2000 - before URS was retained and thus before the reservoir
design was generated. As a result, the contents of the folder would be irrelevant to the litigation
and non-responsive to Durkin’s document requests. (Nevertheless, Newark produced the folder
in its entirety to Durkin). In fact, as was explained in counsel’s email at Exhibit A, of those 26
documents contained in the RFP folder, 11 were duplicates of documents which have been
produced already. Of the remaining 15 documents, 13 were dated September or October 2000,
again, pre-dating the reservoir design and therefore clearly irrelevant. Of the remaining two
documents, one was a March 17, 2005 email from URS referencing their construction oversight
and may have already been produced by URS. The final document was hand-written notes of
Carol Houck from a September 11, 2003 teleconference with URS.
The handwritten notes are actually helpful to Newark and had Newark known they
existed there would have been no reason to withhold them. Counsel’s forthcoming disclosure of
these documents in the face of Durkin’s motion for sanctions is proof of Newark’s ongoing good
faith. The documents were not purposefully misplaced, and were likely misfiled by a Newark
secretary. Affidavit of Carol Houck, Exhibit B, Para. 7. Houck looked in the file to refresh her
recollection regarding the terms of URS’s November 6, 2000 contract, as it is one basis for
Newark’s Third-Party Claim against URS for contribution and indemnity. Id. at Para. 3. There

is a logical and reasonable explanation, and Newark cannot be sanctioned for what amounts to a
clerical error.
B.

THE DOCUMENTS HIGHLIGHTED BY DURKIN WERE
WRITTEN POST-TERMINATION AND ARE IRRELEVANT
TO THE DEFENSE OF NEWARK’S COUNTERCLAIM

Durkin’s characterization of the undated memo from Carol Houck is wrong. This
document was generated by Houck after Durkin was terminated and constitutes Houck’s
thoughts regarding reaching a new agreement with Durkin which would include Durkin returning
to the project and completing the project as-designed. Exhibit B, Aff’d Houck, Para. 8. The
document was generated after termination, after Durkin’s counsel contacted counsel for Newark
regarding the termination notice (which prompted the February 4 letter providing Durkin an
additional seven days of notice). Houck recalls drafting the document during that period, while
waiting for assurance from Durkin. Id. at Para. 9. No response was received. Since the undated
memo was written post-termination and litigation was certainly contemplated, Newark was not
under any obligation to produce the document until ordered to so by the Court.
The second document highlighted by Durkin, being a memo from City Manager Carl Luft
to the Mayor, was also written after termination and was generated for the same reason Houck
penned her thoughts; the possibility of garnering Durkin’s agreement to finish the project as
designed, which it had refused to do up to that point.
Durkin points to the production of these two documents as hindering its ability to mount a
defense to Newark’s counterclaim, but Newark’s counterclaim is all about Durkin’s refusal to
perform before termination. Because the documents post-date the February 3, 2004 termination

notice, they have no bearing on the counterclaim, except as further evidence of Durkin’s refusal
to perform.
Durkin also points to an email written by counsel which was copied to URS. As Newark
explained in its Answering Brief, Newark had a right to assert the joint-defense privilege and
should not be sanctioned for doing so simply because the privilege was ultimately determined to
not apply, which did not occur until September 5, 2006 (not May 9, 2006 as asserted by Durkin).
Finally, Durkin cites document NEW13604, a duplicate of NEW245, which constitutes a
fax coversheet written from counsel to Newark and URS. The joint-defense privilege applied up
until September 5, 2006, as explained above. The document references an attached report written
by Dr. Richardson, of which all parties possess a copy. In neither form does the actual report
follow the cover sheet, and since all parties have a copy of the referenced report, Durkin’s
complaint is meritless.
Durkin has requested 19 additional documents in their Supplemental Brief Appendix.
Newark noted in its Answering Brief that the Motion for Sanctions was the first notice that
Durkin was dissatisfied with Newark’s production, and its Supplemental Brief the first notice
with respect to specific documents. Newark will respond further at oral argument.
As to Durkin’s contention that Newark has an on-going obligation to update its privilege
log, Rule 26(e) provides only that a party has a duty to supplement its disclosures if ordered by
the court (as is the case here). Rule 26(e) subparts (1) and (2) require supplementation if the
party learns that its disclosures were incorrect or incomplete which is not applicable as the
documents here were only produced because of the recent rulings. Rule 37(c)(1) allows

-4-

sanctions for failure to disclose information required by Rule 26 without substantial justification.
Here, the privileges provided justification, so sanctions are completely inappropriate.
C.

THE SANCTIONS SOUGHT BY DURKIN ARE DRASTIC
AND UNWARRANTED BY THE FACTS

In the face of Durkin’s complaints about Newark, it must be noted that Durkin has
produced absolutely no emails or a privilege log, ever. A privilege must exist, as Durkin
retained counsel as early as 2002. Exhibit C, Deposition of Donald Durkin, Page 74, Lines 7-14.
That fact alone should bar the relief sought by Durkin.
As Newark has advised the Court, it has, in good faith, endeavored to produce all
documents it was ordered to produce. Newark had the right to assert and withhold protected
documents on the basis of the attorney-client and joint-defense privileges until those were ruled
and determined to be inapplicable on September 5 and September 12, 2006. Durkin’s
Supplemental Brief is devoid of a response to Newark’s point that it had no obligation to produce
these documents earlier, and acknowledges that documents were properly held on the basis of
joint-defense privilege at least as late as May 9, 2006.
Durkin has provided no evidence of flagrant bad-faith or willful and intentional conduct,
a necessary component for punitive dismissal. Poulis v. State Farm & Cas. Co., 747 F.2d 863,
868 (3d Cir. 1984), see also National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427
U.S. 639. In considering dismissal as a sanction, the Court must also find a “history of
dilatoriness” of which none can be shown in this case. Id. Durkin has pending arguments with
respect to destruction of the briefing packets, however, as Newark has argued, there has been no
evidence showing that documents were purposefully destroyed, rather, the evidence indicates that
those documents were destroyed in the regular course of business. See Brewer v. Quaker State

Oil Refining Corp., 72 F.3d 326, 334 (3d Cir.1995) (“[I]t must appear that there has been an
actual suppression or withholding of the evidence.” also quoting 31A C.J.S. Evidence § 156(2);
29 Am.Jur.2d Evidence § 177: “Such a presumption or inference...does not arise where the
destruction was a matter of routine with no fraudulent intent.”).
The criteria for punitive dismissal also require consideration of the party’s failure to meet
scheduling orders; here Newark provided the documents within one week of the Court’s order, so
there is no failure to comply. Id. Additionally, the criteria for a punitive dismissal requires
consideration of the meritoriousness of the claim or defense; here Newark obviously has
meritorious defenses to this action. Id.
The chief case cited by Durkin stands for the proposition that dismissals are extreme and
drastic sanctions which should be reserved for cases where there is a clear record of delay or
disobedience.1 Poulis, 747 F.2d 863. In Poulis, plaintiffs’ counsel failed to file discovery or
answer interrogatories, was late filing the pre-trial statement, and when requested to do so by the
district judge, failed to comply. Id. This situation is hardly analogous.
Because Newark had justification for withholding privileged documents (as set forth
herein and in greater detail in Newark’s Answering Brief at D.I. 256), no sanction is appropriate.
Even if the Court were to decide that Newark’s best efforts to produce documents in compliance
with the Court’s order fell short of the Court’s intent, the appropriate action would be to order
production of those specific documents. Rule 37(b) states that sanctions are not appropriate if
the court finds the failure was substantially justified. If the Court were still inclined to sanction

Durkin also cites Barnett & Son, Inc. et. al. v. Outboard Marine, et al., 611 F.2d 32 in support of its argument that
punitive dismissal is warranted. In that case, certain defendants failed to appear at scheduled depositions, failed to
produce documents and failed to answer interrogatories in the face of three court orders to do so. Barnett is not
remotely analogous.

Newark (which would necessitate a finding that Newark had an obligation to produce such
documents before the privilege was waived), there are other less punitive sanctions which would
be more reasonably related to Newark’s actions. Dismissal or default judgment is the ultimate
sanction for discovery violations, and should only be used sparingly. Lehman Capital v. Lofland
ex rel. Estate of Monroe, 2006 WL 2465410 at *7 (Del.Supr.,2006). Houck’s September 11,
2003 notes were simply mis-filed, which rises only to the level of neglect and does not warrant
penalty.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Defendant City of Newark respectfully requests that this Court deny
Durkin’s Motion for Sanctions.
