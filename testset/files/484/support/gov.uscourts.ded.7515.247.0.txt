I. NATURE AND STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS

Plaintiff and Third Party Defendant Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. ("Durkin") filed an
action against Defendant City of Newark and members of City Council (collectively "the City") arising
out of the City's improper termination of Durkin's Contract for default. Durkin files this Motion for
sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b), (c) and (d).

I. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

The City has blatantly violated discovery in this matter. Based on the City's continued refusal to
supplement its discovery responses, withholding documents that are clearly not privileged, and failure to
fully comply with this Court's Order regarding privileged documents, Durkin is entitled under Rule 37(b),
(c) and (d) to foreclose the City from cross examining any witness called by Durkin or offering any
evidence on the issue of liability or damages on any claims asserted by Durkin.

II. CONCISE STATEMENT OF FACTS

By way of summary and background, Durkin incorporates the Certification of Paul Logan,
Esquire which provides a detailed history of the City's continued disregard for their obligations under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and this Court's Order. (Certification of Paul Logan, Esquire, Appendix
("App."). Al-A103).

Further to Mr. Logan's certification, the City's discovery abuses continued most recently with
regard to this Court's September 12, 2006 Order. The Court ruled that the May 16, 2006 correspondence
from Carol Houck to Paul Cottrell, litigation counsel for the City, was a disclosure that constituted a
subject-matter waiver of an attorney-client privileged communication. (Order 9/12/06 App. A104-A105).
The Court then ordered production of documents within the five (5) designated categories that were
disputed by the City. Of the approximately seventy-eight (78) documents produced pursuant to this
Court's Order, a large segment of those documents were not privileged and also did not pertain to the five
(5) designated categories where waiver of the attorney-client privilege was found to have occurred. Many
of the remaining documents on the City's privilege log, that the City is obligated to produce but to date
has yet to produce, arguably pertain to the five (5) designated categories where the waiver occurred.

Durkin asked the City to provide more information on those documents that the City continued to

Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 247 Filed 09/22/2006 Page5of8

withhold in order to fully evaluate the claimed privilege, especially in light of the waiver. (Email from
David T. Bolger, Esquire to Paul Cottrell dated September 6, 2006 App. A106-A108). The City has not
responded with additional information.

There were only approximately nineteen (19) documents that were produced pursuant to this
Court's recent Order on waiver that were not on the privilege log. Interestingly, it appears that some of
those documents should have been on the City's privilege log - but were not.' Some of the
approximately nineteen (19) documents are in no way privileged or protected from production and should
have been produced over a year ago."

Finally, the most recent document produced pursuant to this Court's Order on the privilege
waiver is dated September 2, 2004. It is unfathomable that no documents were generated in 2005 and
2006 that pertained to those subject matters in the Court's recent order were generated - that is, other than
the privileged document that prompted this Court's Order, which is dated May 16, 2006.

IV, ARGUMENT

A. The City has Boldly Ignored its Discovery Obligations and Engaged in Serious
Abuses of the Rules, Therefore Durkin is Entitled to An Order Precluding the City
from Cross Examining Durkin's Witnesses or Presenting Evidence on the Issues of
Durkin's Claims and Damages, or in the Alternative, Durkin is Entitled to an Entry
of Judgment by Default

Despite the clear direction and order of the Court, the City persists in its blatant defiance of its
discovery obligations and the directives of the Court. As set forth in the Certification of Durkin's
Counsel, Durkin has numerous times conferred in good faith with counsel for the City attempting to
obtain the City's cooperation. (App. Al-A103). However, such good faith attempts have been to no
avail. In fact, Durkin did not know the full nature of the discovery abuses until September 18, 2006 when
the City produced some documents pursuant to this Court's Order.

The City has engaged in a pattern of abuses of the Rules, misrepresented the availability of

documents, purposefully concealed and withheld documents - including case-dispositive documents -

 

' By way of example only, documents that should have been on the outdated January 18, 2005 Privilege
Log but were not included: Email from Petrone to Houck, 12/29/03 (App. A109-A110); Fax from Houck
to Cottrell, 2/5/04 (App. A111-A112); and Fax from Houck to Petrone, 4/5/04 (App. A113-A114).
* By way of example only, the Memorandum from Funk to Luft, 9/2/04 (App. A115) should never have
been withheld from Durkin.

obstructed the discovery process and ignored the Court's Order. Accordingly, Durkin is entitled to

sanctions under Rule 37(b), (c) and (d). See Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 37(b), (c) and (d). Under Rule 37, a

sanction for a discovery abuse, including the preclusion of evidence, is warranted except when a party's

conduct is either substantially justified or harmless. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37; Praxair, Inc. v. ATML Inc.,

2006 USS. Dist. LEXIS 57857, 20-21 (D. Del. 2006).The City's withholding of documents (which

continues) that are clearly not privileged or should be produced under this Court Order on the privilege

waiver is neither substantially justified or harmless. Durkin has been severely prejudiced by the City's

discovery abuses, as set forth below.

A recently produced February 5, 2004 memorandum from the City Manager, Carl Luft to
the Mayor and Members of City Council, was withheld until a few days ago on the basis
of "privilege". (App. A121-A122) This memorandum provides confirmation and
information about the immediate effect of the termination of Durkin on February 2, 2004,
a fact disputed by the City. The memorandum was never privileged, has been available
to the City since the commencement of this lawsuit, and would have been an essential
piece of information in connection with Durkin's discovery depositions.

A memorandum dated January 23, 2004, from Assistant City Manager Carol Houck to
City Manager Carl Luft was also withheld (App. A116-A117). This document, withheld
notwithstanding there being no privilege reasonably attendant to this document, contains
information respecting the motives and decision of the City to terminate Durkin, and
precedes by approximately one (1) week the vote of City Council to terminate Durkin's
contract. This information was withheld from Durkin and Federal and was not available
during the depositions of Ms. Houck, the City's Rule 30(b)(6) designee, Mr. Luft, any of
the URS representatives or members of City Council.

A memorandum from City Manager Luft to the Mayor and City Council dated December
9, 2003, was withheld. (App. A118-A119) This is the same type of information sought
respecting the "Briefing Packets" provided to City Council members and should have
been available well in advance of the depositions of Ms. Houck, Mr. Dombrowski, City
Council Members and Mr. Luft.

A memorandum from attorney Vicky Petrone on or about January 20, 2004, days before
the termination of Durkin, and sent to Ms. Houck and a third party ~ Jill Voeller of URS.
(App. A120) There was not then, nor is there now, any "joint defense" privilege; indeed,
the Court's earlier order to produce the Executive Session meeting minutes from
February 2, 2004 was based upon the presence of a URS representative that the Court
found vitiated the attorney-client privilege. (App. A120) The document should have been
produced as part of the initial disclosures, or at the very latest, following the Court's
order concerning the Executive Session meeting minutes, and made available to Durkin
and Federal with regard to their Motions for Summary Judgment and ensuing discovery.

A memorandum from Mayor Vance Funk to City Manager Carl Luft dated September 2,
2004, was withheld. In that memorandum, Mayor Funk states: "In talking to 5 out of the
6 City Councilmen over the past few days, it appears that all of us agree that any major
decision made by the City regarding the reservoir should be made with our advice and

-3-

consent, If this requires calling a special meeting or any other discussion forum that you
are aware of, please let me know quickly so I can consult with my fellow Councilmen."
(App. A115). This document is consistent with the claim by Durkin that City Council was
not made aware of all of the facts that should have been provided to them at the time they
voted to terminate Durkin. Mayor Funk was deposed by Durkin and Federal, however
this document, which is not privileged, was withheld by the City.

In terms of any attorney-client communications within the subject areas that were deemed waived
in the Court's most recent order, Durkin has observed the following concerning what has been produced
in response thereto:

1, In the materials produced, there are no written communications whatsoever authored by
the City solicitor, Mr. Roger Akin;

2. In the materials produced, there are only two (2) written communications authored by
litigation counsel Paul Cottrell, which consist of two electronic mail messages (and no letters) dated
February 17, 2004 and July 14, 2004, respectively; and

3. There are no written communications of any form dated later than September 2, 2004,
despite the fact that the letter which prompted the Court's order was dated May 16, 2006, so there was
unquestionably a requirement to produce all documents responsive to the Court's Order at least as of the
date of the letter.

In view of the fact that Mr. Akin was involved as the City solicitor since (at least) the inception of
the project, and is known to have authored correspondence to the City Council (e.g., the May 27, 2004
memorandum to City Council reporting on Dr. Calabria's investigation), it is difficult to conclude that
there was no other written communications from his office on any of the subject matters as to which
privilege was deemed waived. The same is true of Mr. Cottrell, especially in light of the intensive
pleading and discovery activity that has taken place over the past two years. Added to this remarkable
paucity of documents is the complete absence of any communications at all post-dating September 2,
2004 on any of the subject matters-except when the silence was broken by Ms. Houck in her May 16,

2006 letter to Mr. Cottrell-with no apparent further communications on those subject matters up through

the date of the Court's order.

Case 1:04-cv-00163-GMS Document 247 Filed 09/22/2006 Page 8of8

In light of the serious discovery abuses that have taken place, notwithstanding the Court's clear
admonitions and orders compelling the production of these documents, Durkin is entitled to have
meaningful additional sanctions entered against the City that are commensurate in severity with the City's
knowing and improper continued withholding of materials, together with attorney's fees and costs.

V. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff Donald M. Durkin Contracting, Inc. respectfully requests
that this Court grant its Motion for Sanctions Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b), (c) and (d)
and foreclose the City from cross examining any witness called by Durkin or offering any evidence on the
issues of liability or damages on any claims asserted by Durkin against the City and prohibiting any
testimony or evidence by the City on the issues of liability or damages on any claims asserted by Durkin
against the City' and award Durkin its attorney's fees and costs. In the alternative, Durkin respectfully
requests that the Court enter an Order of a judgment by default against the City on the claims by Durkin
and award Durkin its attorney's fees and costs, together with such additional relief as this Court deems

necessary or appropriate.
