CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:07-cv-03691

UNITED STATES RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO CLAIMANTS’
MOTION TO MITIGATE FORFEITURE
United States responds in opposition to Claimants’ motion to mitigate the
forfeiture of $32,000. Docket # 25.
Background
1. On September 5, 2007, Sant Hoa Mai and Vu Hoang, Claimants, arrived
into the United States from Panama City, Panama, at the George Bush
Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas, on board Continental Airlines flight 889.
While conducting a routine Customs inspection at the airport, a United States
Customs and Border Protection Officer (Customs Officer) asked Sant Hoa Mai
and Vu Hoang whether they were transporting more than $10,000 in cash or
monetary instruments into the United States. Each of them falsely stated verbally

Filed in TXSD on 07/06/09 Page 2 of 10

and in writing that they were not bringing into the United States more than
$10,000 in cash or monetary instruments. During the Customs inspection, the
Customs officers found that they were both carrying more than $10,000 and in
total they were carrying approximately $64,000 in cash and money orders.
2. The discovered funds were seized by the Customs Officials and the
United States filed a complaint against the $64,000 in which the United States
sought the forfeiture of the $64,000 because these funds were involved in a
violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5316. Under 31 U.S.C. § 5316, a person is required to
report when they are transporting more than $10,000 in currency or monetary
instrument into the United States. Docket #1. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(2),
the United States may seize and forfeit any funds involved in a violation of 31
U.S.C. § 5316.
3. The parties settled the case by the Claimants agreeing to the forfeiture of
$32,000 (50% of the $64,000) and the United States agreeing to return $32,000 to
the Claimants. The Claimants reserved their right to move to mitigate the
forfeiture of the $32,000 as an Excessive Fine under the Eighth Amendment.
Docket # 23 and 24. On June 5, 2009, the Claimants filed their motion to mitigate
the forfeiture. Docket # 25.

Applicable Law
4. Under 18 U.S.C. § 983(g) and Rule G(e), Supplemental Rules for
Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions, the Claimants may
petition the Court to determine whether the forfeiture was constitutionally
excessive. In making this determination, the Court shall compare the forfeiture to
the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture. United States v. Bajakajian,
524 U.S. 321, 334 (1998) and 18 U.S.C. § 983(g)(2). The Claimants have the
burden of establishing that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional by a
preponderance of the evidence. If the Court finds that the forfeiture is grossly
disproportional to the offense, the Court shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as
necessary to avoid a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth
Amendment of the Constitution. 18 U.S.C. § 983(g).
5. The Eighth Amendment provides that: “Excessive bail shall not be
required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment
inflicted.” U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The Supreme Court has held “that a punitive
forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the
gravity of a defendant's offense.1” Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 334. The Eighth

Although this was announced in a criminal forfeiture case, this rule was

made applicable to civil forfeiture case by the enactment of 18 U.S.C. § 983(g).

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 26

Amendment does not require strict proportionality between the amount of the
punitive forfeiture and the gravity of a criminal offense, it only prohibits gross
disproportionality. Id., 336. The pertinent factors in an Excessive Fine analysis
include (1) whether the claimant falls into the class of persons at whom the
criminal statute was particularly directed; (2) other penalties authorized by the
legislature, (3) the harm caused by the claimant. Id., 337-40.
Argument
The Claimants Committed a Serious Felony Violation
6. In determining whether a forfeiture is excessive the Supreme Court stated
“that judgment about the appropriate punishment for an offense belongs in the first
instance to the legislature.” Id., 336. After Bajakajian, Congress enacted a bulk
cash smuggling statute, 31 U.S.C. § 5332. In that enactment Congress made the
following findings that are relevant to the currency reporting violations in this
case:
(1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting requirements of
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and the
regulations prescribed under such subchapter, has forced drug dealers
and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid using
traditional financial institutions.
(2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial institutions, drug
dealers and other criminals are forced to move large quantities of
currency in bulk form to and through the airports, border crossings,
4

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 26

Filed in TXSD on 07/06/09 Page 5 of 10

and other ports of entry where the currency can be smuggled out of
the United States and placed in a foreign financial institution or sold
on the black market.
(3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form may now
be the most common form of money laundering, and the movement of
large sums of cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug
trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion
and similar crimes.
(4) The intentional transportation into or out of the United States of
large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, in a manner
designed to circumvent the mandatory reporting provisions of
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, is the
equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.
115 Stat 272, 336 -337.
7. The reporting violation in this case is similar to the reporting violation in
Bajakajian. However, since Bajakajian the Congress made the above findings
which underscores the importance of the currency reporting violation. Although
there is no evidence that this offense is related to another crime, this is a
significant violation as noted by these Congressional findings post Bajakajian.
A $32,000 Forfeiture for Two Violators Is Not Grossly Disproportional
To a Cumulative Sentencing Guidelines Fines of $10,000
and Statutory Fines of $500,000
8. In translating the gravity of a crime into monetary terms, the Eleventh
Circuit held that “if the value of the forfeited property is within the range of fines
prescribed by Congress, a strong presumption arises that the forfeiture is
5

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 26

Filed in TXSD on 07/06/09 Page 6 of 10

constitutional” and “if the value of the property forfeited is within or near the
permissible range of fines under the sentencing guidelines, the forfeiture almost
certainly is not excessive. United States v. 817 N.E. 29th Drive Wilton Manors,
Fla., 175 F.3d 1304, 1309-1310 (11th Cir. 1999). In United States v. Wallace, 389
F.3d 483, 486 (5th Cir. 2004), the Fifth Circuit upheld a district court’s ruling that
a forfeiture was not excessive based upon United States v. 817 N.E. 29th Drive
Wilton Manors, Fla.
9. In this case, each Claimant would have faced a sentencing guidelines
maximum fine of $5,0002. This results in a cumulative sentencing guidelines
maximum fine of $10,000. A $32,000 forfeiture is less than 4 times the
Sentencing Guidelines fine. In contrast, the forfeiture struck down in Bajakajian
exceeded the maximum Guidelines fine by a factor of more than 70. See also
United States v. Jose, 499 F.3d 105, 112 (1st Cir. 2007) (forfeiture less than 4
times the maximum Sentencing Guidelines fine was upheld); United States v.
Fifthy-Nine Thousand Dollars, 2007 WL 824122 (S.D. Fla.. 2007)(forfeiture

[2B1.1(b)(1)(D)] -6 [2S1.3(a)(1)(b)(3)] = 6 and b) Maximum Fine of $5,000
under 5E1.2(c)(3).

$49,000 when the Sentencing Guidelines maximum fine was $5,000 was
constitutional.). In considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the admonishment of
Judge Kennedy should be noted: “The purpose of the Guidelines, however, is to
select punishments with precise proportion, not to opine on what is a gross
disproportion.” Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 350. See also U.S.S.G. §
1A.1.1Commentary ( . . . Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a
system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of
different severity.).
10. In considering an offense's gravity, the statutory fine is relevant
evidence. Here, Congress has authorized a maximum fine of $250,000. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3571. To show unconstitutionality, the Claimants must prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the forfeiture was grossly disproportional.
Also, the Claimants must rebut the strong presumption of constitutionality because
the forfeiture is substantially less than the statutory fine. See also United States v.
Cekosky, 171 Fed. Appx. 785, 788 (11th Cir. 2006) (“Because the forfeiture
amount is smaller than [the statutory] maximum, we hold that it is
constitutional.”); United States v. Wagoner County Real Estate, 278 F.3d 1091,
1100 (10th Cir. 2002) (“Maximum statutory fines provide guidance on legislative
view of the seriousness of the offense. . . ‘if the value of forfeited property is
7

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 26

Filed in TXSD on 07/06/09 Page 8 of 10

within the range of fines prescribed by Congress, a strong presumption arises that
the forfeiture is constitutional.’”)(quoting 817 N.E. 29th Drive Wilton Manors,
Fla., 175 F.3d at 1309-1310 (11th Cir. 1999)).
11. The excessive fine prohibition has not been violated by this $32,000
forfeiture for two violator who faced cumulative sentencing guidelines fines of
$10,000 and statutory fines of $500,000.
Claimants Failed to Meet Their Burden of Proof
12. The question is not what would be a more appropriate forfeiture but
rather is the present forfeiture of $32,000 grossly disproportional for two
Claimants who lied to Customs official. This issue was not addressed by the
Claimants. Their extensive discussion about a $64,000 forfeiture is not relevant to
the forfeiture of $32,000 in this case. The Claimants have not presented any
evidence or argument to rebut the strong presumption of constitutionality for a
forfeiture that is substantially less than the cumulative fine of $500,000 for the two
violators.
13. The absence of a criminal case is also immaterial. It is the United State
discretion to decide whether to prosecute a currency violation by criminal or civil
means. The Bajakajian opinion noted Justice Joseph Story’s 1827 observation
that “[T]he practice has been, and so this Court understand the law to be, that the
8

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 26

proceeding in rem stands independent of, and wholly unaffected by any criminal
proceeding in personam.” Bajakajian at 330 (quoting The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1,
14-15, 6 L.Ed. 531 (1827)). A criminal prosecution of the Claimants is immaterial
to civil forfeiture proceedings. The failure to prosecute has no effect on the
United States’ ability to pursue civil forfeiture. Pimentel v. U.S. Drug Enforcement
Admin., 99 F. Supp.2d 420, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Even an acquittal of the
underlying criminal charges does not affect the United States’ right to seek a civil
forfeiture. United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354, 361362 (1984) (acquittal on gun violation under 18 U.S.C. § 922 does not bar civil
forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. § 982(d)); One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United
States, 409 U.S. 232, 234-35 (1972) (acquittal on criminal smuggling charge does
not bar later civil forfeiture).
Conclusion
14. Here there were four violations of 31 U.S.C. § 5316. Each Claimant
lied twice to the Customs Officer about the amount of funds he was bringing into
the United States. The forfeiture of $32,000 is not grossly disproportionate to
these violations of 31 U.S.C. § 5316. The Claimants have not rebutted the strong
presumption that the forfeiture is constitutional when the amount is less than the
statutory fine. Nor have the Claimants met their burden of proving beyond a
9

Filed in TXSD on 07/06/09 Page 10 of 10

preponderance of the evidence that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional.
Accordingly, the United States requests that the Court deny Claimants’ motion to
mitigate this forfeiture.
