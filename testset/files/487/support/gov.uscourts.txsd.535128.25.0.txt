MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

3

On September 5, 2007, the defendant $64,000 in money orders and cashier’s check was

4

seized by United States Customs Agents at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston,

5

Texas. On November 1, 2007, plaintiff filed its Verified Complaint for Forfeiture In Rem. On

6

November 29, 2007 and December 5, 2007, claimants Phung Lee and Sant Mai filed their

7

respective Claim(s) Opposing Forfeiture. On December 18, 2007, the claimants filed their

8

Answer(s) to Complaint for Forfeiture and Demand for Jury Trial. On April 10, 2008, the parties

9

appeared before this Court for the Rule 16 Scheduling Conference and on that date executed a

10

consent to proceed before Magistrate Judge. On April 21, 2008, the matter was ordered

11

reassigned to this Court by the Honorable David Hittner, United States District Judge. On May

12

5, 2009, the parties entered into an agreed Motion for Forfeiture Judgment, and on May 7, 2009,

13

the parties motion was granted. The judgment provided that fifty (50) percent of the defendant

14

$64,000 in money orders and cashier’s check would be forfeited to the United States while fifty

15

(50) percent of the defendant money orders and cashier’s check would be returned to claimants.

16

That Order further provided that the claimants reserved their right to move for Mitigation of

17

Forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment of the United States

18

Constitution pursuant to Rule G(8)(e) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and

19

Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions.

20
21

STATEMENT OF THE FACTS
On September 5, 2007, claimants Sant Mai and Phung Lee returned to the United States

22

with approximately $49,000.00 in money orders which they had purchased here in the United

23

States and taken to Panama. In addition, Mr. Mai returned with a Wells Fargo Bank cashier’s

24

check in the amount of $15,000.00 which had been purchased here in the United States and

25

forwarded to Panama, but returned because the payee’s name was misspelled.

INTRODUCTION
It is generally accepted that the failure to declare currency and/or monetary instruments
(as defined in Title 31 of the Code of Federal Rule of Regulations) subjects the property to
2

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 25

Filed in TXSD on 06/05/09 Page 3 of 11

1

forfeiture. Nevertheless, the United States Customs Service’s own publications on the subject

2

fail to list money orders as “monetary instruments” which must be declared upon exit or entry

3

into the United States. In that regard, in a publication entitled “Do I have to declare currency

4

when entering the U.S. in-transit to a foreign destination?” on the United States Customs’

5

website, the following instructions are given to travelers:

6

“Do I have to declare currency when entering the U.S. in-transit to a foreign
destination?”

7
Question
8
9

“Do I have to declare currency when entering the U.S. in transit to a foreign
destination?”

10

Answer

11

“When entering the U.S. in-transit to a foreign destination, you will be required to
clear U.S. Customs Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement. If
you have “monetary instruments” (i.e. currency, personal checks, travelers checks,
gold coins, securities or stocks in bearer form) valued at $10,000.00 or more in
your possession a “Report of International Transportation of Currency or
Monetary Instruments” form FinCEN 105 must be submitted to a CBP officer
upon your entry into the United States . . . (See Exhibit “A”.)

12
13
14
15

An additional section entitled “Traveling with money, checks, etc., do I have to pay duty?” states
16
the following:
17
“Traveling with money, checks, etc., do I have to pay duty?”
18
Question
19
“Traveling with money, checks, etc., do I have to pay duty?”
20
Answer
21
22
23

“Customs does not collect duty on currency. However, travelers leaving or
entering the United States are required to report monetary instruments (i.e.
currency or checks) valued at $10,000 or more and file “Report of International
Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments” form FinCen 105. . .” (See
Exhibit “B”.)

24
Thus, the U.S. Customs Services’ own publications fail to warn travelers they are
25
required to declare money orders upon exit or entry into the United States.
26
Additionally, as briefly addressed above, the facts regarding the cashier’s check are as
27
follows: Mr. Mai had retained the services of an attorney by the name of Francisco Lambrano28
3

Borrero in Panama in connection with a business venture described below. He forwarded the

2

cashier’s check to the lawyer prior to his trip to Panama. Upon his arrival, he learned the lawyer

3

was unable to cash the check because his name was misspelled on the check. Mr. Mai then

4

brought the check back to the United States.

I

7

THE FORFEITURE OF THE ENTIRE RES CONSTITUTES
AN EXCESSIVE FINE

8
9
10

Rule G(8)(e) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims
reads in relevant part:

11

(e) Excessive Fines.

12

A claimant may seek to mitigate a forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause of
the Eighth Amendment by motion for summary judgment or by motion made after
entry of a forfeiture judgment if:

13
14

(i) the claimant has pleaded the defense under Rule 8; and

15

(ii) the parties have had the opportunity to conduct civil discovery on the defense.

16

It is undisputed claimants both pled the defense of excessive fines in their respective

17

answers (See Third Affirmative Defense in Answer[s] of Sant Mai and Phung Lee, at pg. 2, lines

18

20-23 respectively.) Additionally, the parties were afforded the opportunity to conduct civil

19

discovery in the case. (See Scheduling Order, filed 4-17-08, at item # 4.)

20

The seminal case for the evaluation of the legality of a forfeiture in light of the Excessive

21

Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution is United States v.

22

Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998). Although that case was a criminal forfeiture, the Supreme

23

Court has held that both civil and criminal forfeitures are punishment for the purposes of

24

applying the Excessive Fines Clause. Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 621-22 (1993).

25

Other courts have also applied Bajakajian to civil forfeitures. See, e.g., United States v.

26

$273,969.04 in United States Currency, 164 F.3d 462, 466 (9th Cir. 1999).

27

In Bajakajian, the government sought criminal forfeiture under 31 USC § 5317 of

28

$357,144.00 that Bajakajian failed to report when leaving the country. Bajakajian pled guilty to
4

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 25

Filed in TXSD on 06/05/09 Page 5 of 11

1

failing to report currency in violation of 31 USC § 5316, the underlying statute relied upon in the

2

government’s complaint. Id. at 324-25. At a bench trial on the government’s claim that criminal

3

forfeiture was appropriate, the district court found that imposition of a complete forfeiture would

4

be “extraordinarily harsh” and “grossly disproportionate to the offense in question,” and it would,

5

therefore, violate the Excessive Fines Clause. The district court ordered forfeiture of $15,000.00,

6

and imposed a sentence of 3 years probation with a fine of $5,000.00. The Ninth Circuit

7

affirmed the district court’s ruling.

8
9

The Supreme Court agreed with both the district court and the court of appeals holdings
that forfeiting all of the money would violate the Excessive Fines Clause — it would “be grossly

10

disproportional to the gravity of his offense.” Id. at 324. The Court went on to establish four

11

factors to be analyzed in determining the appropriateness of a forfeiture, which have come to be

12

known as the “Bajakajian Factors,” which are:

13

(1)

14
15

The essence of the crime of the respondent and its relation to other criminal
activity;

(2)

16

Whether the respondent fits into the class of persons for whom the statute was
designed;

17

(3)

The maximum sentence and fines that could have been imposed; and

18

(4)

The nature of the harm caused by the respondent’s conduct. Id. at 337-39, 338

19
20
21
22

n.13.
The Bajakajian Court concluded that seizing the entire amount of money would be
grossly disproportional to the crime of failing to report the money because:
(1)

23
24

his currency” and that it was legal for him to be in possession of the currency;
(2)

25
26

His violation was unrelated to any other illegal activity and the currency was not
the proceeds of illegal activity;

(3)

27
28

The respondent’s crime was “failing to report the wholly legal act of transporting

He did not fit into the class of persons for whom the statute was designed, i.e., a
money launderer, a drug trafficker, or tax evader;

(4)

His maximum length of imprisonment was six months and his maximum fine was
5

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 25

Filed in TXSD on 06/05/09 Page 6 of 11

1

$5,000.00 under the Sentencing Guidelines, which confirmed a minimum level of

2

culpability; and

3

(5)

The harm he caused was minimal because his failure to report the currency

4

affected only the government and in a relatively minor way because the

5

government was deprived “only of the information [that money] had left the

6

country.” Id. at 37-39.

7

After Bajakajian, 18 USC § 983 was enacted as part of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform

8

Act of 2000 (CAFRA). Section 983(g) essentially codifies the holding of Bajakajian: “[T]he

9

court shall compare the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture,” to

10

determine whether the forfeiture is constitutionally excessive. This section also sets out the

11

procedures to be utilized in civil forfeitures such as that involved in this case. Moreover, Rule

12

G(3)(e) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, which applies to

13

this case, authorizes a claimant to seek to mitigate a forfeiture under the Excessive Fines Clause

14

by either a motion for summary judgment, or by a motion made after entry of a forfeiture

15

judgment, provided the claimant has pleaded the defense under Rule 8, and the parties have had

16

the opportunity to conduct civil discovery on the defense.

17

In this case, as set forth above, the analysis of the Bajakajian factors compels the

18

conclusion that the appropriate forfeiture to be levied here is no more than $5,000.00. Although

19

the maximum penalty for a violation of 31 USC § 5316 is five years in prison and a $250,000

20

fine, Bajakajian, itself, strongly suggests that the appropriate measure of the sentence and fines

21

that could have been imposed in evaluating Factor (3) is that resulting from an application of the

22

Sentencing Guidelines. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 349 n.14 (“That the maximum fine and

23

Guideline sentence to which respondent was subject were but a fraction of the penalties

24

authorized, however, undercuts any argument based solely on the statute, because they show that

25

respondent’s culpability relative to other potential violators of the reporting provision — tax

26

evaders, drug kingpins, or money launderers, for example — is small indeed.” ). Here, the

27

application of Guideline § 2S1.3 for claimants would have been 0 to 6 months in custody, with a

28

fine range under § 5E1.2(c) (3) of $500 to $5,000.00. Accord, United States v. 817 N.E. 29
6

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 25

Drive, Wilton Manors, Florida, 175 F.3d 1304, 1310 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Beras,

2

183 F.3d 22, 29 n.5 (1st Cir. 1999)(noting that Bajakajian “suggests that the maximum penalties

3

provided under the Guidelines should be given greater weight than the statute because the

4

Guidelines take into consideration the culpability of the individual defendant.”).

5

Here, the application of each of the Bajakajian Factors supports the result advocated by

6

claimants:

7

(1)

Their “crime” consisted only in failing to report the monetary instruments in their

8

possession, none of which were currency, and it was legal for them to be in possession of these

9

monetary instruments;

10
11
12
13
14
15
16

(2)

Their violation was unrelated to any other illegal activity, and the monetary

instruments were not the proceeds of illegal activity;
(3)

They do not fit into the class of persons for whom the statute was designed, i.e., a

money launderer, drug trafficker, or tax evader;
(4)

The maximum length of imprisonment is six months and maximum fine is

$5,000.00 under the Sentencing Guidelines, which confirms a minimal level of culpability; and
(5)

The harm they caused was minimal because their failure to report the monetary

17

instruments affected only the government in a relatively minor way because it was deprived only

18

of the information that money which had originated in this country was returned to this country

19

in the form of money orders and a cashier’s check.

20

Notably, this case does not involve a violation of 31 USC § 5332, commonly referred to

21

as the Bulk Cash Smuggling Statute, enacted in October, 2001, as part of the USA Patriot Act.

22

Cases which have upheld greater proportional penalties than that advocated here overwhelmingly

23

involved violations of that statute, rather than §5316, as here. See, e.g., United States of America

24

v.Otilio Jose, 499 F.3d 105, 114 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. $100,348.00 in U.S. Currency,

25

354 F.3d 1110, 1123 (9th Cir. 2003); United States v. $293,316.00 in United States Currency, 349

26

F.Supp. 2d 638, 651 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (Hon. Jack B. Weinstein).

27

Having discussed this matter at length with the government it is anticipated it will rely on

28

authority which is clearly distinguishable from the instant case. In United States v. Wallace, 389
7

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 25

Filed in TXSD on 06/05/09 Page 8 of 11

1

F3d 483 (5th Cir. 2004), the government sought forfeiture of the defendant’s airplane, valued at

2

$30,000, as a consequence of his guilty plea to count 1 of the indictment, which charged him

3

with knowingly and willfully operating an unregistered aircraft in violation of 49 USC §

4

46306(b)(5)(A). The criminal case and criminal forfeiture arose out of Mr. Wallace’s arrest by

5

local authorities after he arrived at the Springhill, Louisiana airport in his Cessna airplane. At the

6

time, he was under investigation by U.S. Customs Service Agents who were investigating him on

7

suspicion of transporting illegal drugs. Because no evidence of drug trafficking was found, the

8

government filed a federal criminal case against Wallace which was resolved by his guilty plea,

9

resulting in a sentence of one year unsupervised probation and a special assessment of $100.

10

Following a bench trial on the forfeiture count of the indictment, the district court upheld the

11

forfeiture of the entire airplane, which was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit. Significantly, in that

12

case, there was no guideline range in existence at the time of the commission of the criminal

13

offense. Id. at 486. Even though the court in that case quoted from the language of Bajakajian

14

which you have excerpted that the forfeiture of the $30,000 airplane was certainly “not grossly

15

disproportionate” to the $250,000 statutory maximum fine, it went on to analyze the issue using

16

as a bench mark the original $15,000 statutory maximum fine in existence under the predecessor

17

statute, which it used for guidance. The court there noted that even using the previous $15,000

18

statutory maximum under the predecessor statute, the $30,000 forfeiture differed from that

19

maximum fine by only a factor of two. The court noted that the $357,000 forfeiture sought by

20

the government in Bajakajian by contrast, was “over seventy times of $5,000 under the

21

Sentencing Guidelines.” Id. at 486-487. In our case, on the other hand, the forfeiture of the entire

22

$64,000 at issue would result in a forfeiture 12.8 times greater than the $5,000 maximum

23

guideline fine. Perhaps more importantly, the Wallace Court noted that the gravity of the offense

24

giving rise to the forfeiture was greater than that analyzed by the Supreme Court in Bajakajian.

25

In the case before it, Wallace had owned the airplane for seven years without re-registering it in

26

his name, even though he had owned four other airplanes and had registered all of them. The

27

court there also noted the most recent registration certificate on file for the airplane at issue,

28

showing its registration to the Arkansas Forestry Commission, “increased the damage to the
8

Case 4:07-cv-03691 Document 25

Filed in TXSD on 06/05/09 Page 9 of 11

1

integrity of Federal Aviation Safety and Security Systems caused by [his] operation of an

2

unregistered airplane”, as airplanes registered to governmental agencies are permitted to engage

3

in low-level flight, below radar coverage, without attracting a law enforcement response as these

4

agencies conduct low-level flights for research and survey purposes. These suspicious

5

circumstances, suggesting Wallace’s involvement in drug trafficking, coupled with an analysis of

6

the Congressional record indicating the draftsmen of this legislation sought to give law

7

enforcement agencies the authority to seize aircraft operated in violation of the statute “whether

8

control substances are involved or not,” contributed to the Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that the

9

forfeiture at issue there was not violative of the Excessive Fines Clause. Moreover, the Eleventh

10

Circuit case quoted in Wallace, United States v. 817 N.E. 29th Drive, gave much greater weight

11

to the permissible range of fines under the sentencing guidelines than that accorded to the general

12

statutory maximum of $250,000. Id. 486.

13

The other case it is anticipated the govenremtn will rely on is United States v. Bernitt,

14

392 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 2004) is even more dissimilar to the facts underlying this case. There, the

15

government sought forfeiture of the defendant’s property, valued at $115,500, where the

16

defendant was convicted of cultivating 110 marijuana plants ranging in height from 2 to 8 feet

17

growing alongside his house; 248 well tended marijuana plants in his garden; and 281 marijuana

18

plants found in a wooded area of the 30 acre property as well. Clearly, Mr. Bernitt, who was

19

sentenced to the minimum mandatory 5 year penalty for his offenses, was the type of offender for

20

whom the forfeiture provisions were designed--the operator of a large scale cultivation of

21

marijuana for financial gain operation. Moreover, even though the Bernitt Court made reference

22

only to the statutory maximum fine of up to 2 million dollars applicable to the defendant’s

23

convictions, the November, 2001, Sentencing Guidelines applicable to Bernitt’s offenses

24

provided for a guideline fine range of between $12,500 to $125,000 under section 5E 1.2(c)(3) of

25

those guidelines. Thus, the amount of the forfeiture upheld by the 7th Circuit in that case was less

26

then the maximum guideline fine, as well as the statutory maximum. These circumstances serve

27

to clearly distinguish that case from this one, and clearly suggest that our position is more legally

28

tenable than that which the government is expected to advance.
