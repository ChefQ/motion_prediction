MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES

The Rendon Group, Inc. ("TRG"), by counsel,, hereby moves pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
Proc. 45(c)(1) for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses arising from State Farm's failure to
comply with its obligation to use reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on
TRG in connection with the subpoena duces tecum issued in this matter. For the reasons set
forth below, TRG requests an award of fees and expenses totaling $15,744.60.

I. Fees and Expenses Incurred As A Result of Overbroad Subpoena

As aresult of State Farm's failure to comply with Rule 45(c), TRG has incurred legal fees

and expenses totaling $15,744.60, as follows:

(a) Russell J. Gaspar $ 8,892.00
(b) Andrew Wible 6,396.00
(c) Expenses 456.60

These fees and expenses were incurred for: (1) filing objections to the subpoena; (2) conducting
discussions with State Farm in an unsuccessful effort to narrow the scope of the subpoena to

reasonable bounds; and (3) filing and arguing a motion to quash and/or to modify the subpoena.
Case 1:10-mc-00164-HHK -JMF Document 25 Filed 07/01/10 Page 2 of 5

Time spent by Mr. Gaspar and Mr. Wible on the Objections and Motion to Quash, as well as an
explanation and justification of the hourly billing rates charged to TRG, are set forth in detail in
the attached Declaration of Mr. Gaspar, and the supporting billing invoices to TRG.

The fees and expenses sought in this motion are not the total fees and expenses incurred
by TRG in this matter, and do not include any fees or expenses incurred in complying with the
Court's Order of June 16, 2010.

An award of these fees and expenses is warranted by Rule 45(c)(1), which states that the
Court "must" enforce the issuing party's duty to take reasonable steps to avoid undue burden and
expense, and must "impose and appropriate sanction - which may include lost earnings and
reasonable attorneys' fees" on a party that fails to comply. The record of this case demonstrates
that TRG raised the overbreadth of the subpoena with State Farm early in the matter, but was
unable to negotiate a resolution of the issue because State Farm insisted that TRG produce a vast
quantity of documents that was clearly outside the scope of the matters being litigation in the
Underlying Litigation. See Memorandum in Support of Motion to Quash, Docket No. 2, Mar. 9,
2010, and Exhibits thereto; Reply Memorandum of The Rendon Group and Exhibits thereto,
Docket No. 9, April 6, 2010.

In particular, TRG demonstrated, and the Court agreed, that the permissible scope of
discovery from TRG was limited by two Orders that had been entered in the Underlying
Litigation, which State Farm clearly knew about well before it issued a subpoena to TRG. See
Mem. Opinion, Docket No. 24, at 2-3. The Court noted that a subpoena issued to a third party
required "greater sensitivity" to the burdens imposed, and concluded that the scope of State
Farm's subpoena was so far beyond the litigation, as narrowed by judicial order, that neither

State Farm's claimed need for the information nor its claimed relevance was sufficient to
Case 1:10-mc-00164-HHK -JMF Document 25 Filed 07/01/10 Page 3of5

overcome the burden imposed. /d. at 6-8. Therefore, the Court granted TRG's motion is
substantial part, and modified the subpoena to reduce its scope to two arguably relevant
categories of information: documents concerning the Relators, and documents concerning the
qui tam case they filed. It rejected or severely limited 19 other categories of documents listed in
the subpoena.

TRG therefore submits that the Court has found that State Farm failed to take reasonable
steps to avoid imposing under burden on TRG through the subpoena, and that an award of
attorneys' fees is therefore appropriate under Rule 45(c)(1).

TRG also submits that its request for fees is reasonable. See Adolph Coors Co. v. Truck
Ins. Exchange, 383 F.Supp.2d 93, 95 (D.D.C. 2005), citing Huffman v. Saul Holdings Ltd.
P'ship, 262 F.3d 1128, 1134 (10th Cir. 2001). The District of Columbia Circuit generally
employs the following three-part framework to evaluate the reasonableness of fee awards: (1)
determination of the number of hours reasonably expended in litigation; (2) determination of a
reasonable hourly rate; and (3) the use of multipliers as merited. Covington v. District of
Columbia, 57 F.3d 1101, 1107 (D.C.Cir. 1995). The burden of establishing the elements of the
fee award, including "entitlement to an award, documentation of appropriate hours, and
justifications of the reasonableness of the billing," rests with the moving party. Smith v. District
of Columbia, No. Civ. A.02-373, 2005 WL 914773, at *2 (D.D.C. Apr.18, 2005).

To satisfy the first element, a plaintiff must submit invoices that are sufficiently detailed
to "permit the District Court to make an independent determination whether or not the hours
claimed are justified." Nat'l Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec'y of Def, 675 F.2d 1319, 1327

(D.C.Cir. 1982).
Case 1:10-mc-00164-HHK -JMF Document 25 Filed 07/01/10 Page 4of5

With regard to the reasonableness of the attorney's hourly rate, the rate billed is
presumptively reasonable when "in line with those prevailing in the community for similar
services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation." Martini v. Fed.
Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n, 977 F.Supp. 482, 485 (D.D.C. 1997). Moreover, the actual rate billed to a
private litigant in the market is highly relevant proof of the prevailing community rate. See Nat'l
Assoc. of Concerned Veterans, supra, at 1324. TRG does not request any multipliers.

The attached affidavit of counsel and supporting documents establish the required
elements of the fee award and prove that TRG actually and reasonably incurred legal fees and
expenses totaling $15,744.60 in connection with the litigation over the scope of the subpoena. In
this regard, the Court should consider in particular that: (1) State Farm's failure to recognize the
limitations on discovery established by Orders previously entered in the Underlying litigation;
(2) its failure to tailor the subpoena issued to TRG in light of those limitations, in order to avoid
subjecting TRG to undue burden and expense; and (3) its persistence, in its very lengthy
Opposition to the Motion to Quash, in claiming that it was entitled to all of the requested
documents despite the clear meaning of those orders; caused TRG to have to litigate at
considerable expense a dispute that could have and should have been avoided or resolved.

Ii. Conclusion

For these reasons, TRG should be awarded attorneys' fees and expenses totaling

$15,744.60.
