PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSING POINTS AND AUTHORITIES TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE WITH RELATED CLASS ACTION
Plaintiff, Daniel Simmons, by and through his Attorney of Record, Joan A.
Harvill, respectfully moves this Honorable Court to deny Defendant’s Motion to
Consolidate this pending case with Related Class Action and as grounds therefore
avers the following:
1.

There exist some similarities between this pending case and a class action

suit presently before the court, Carl A. Barnes, et al., v. District of Columbia, Civil
Action No. 06-315 (RCL), which has been certified as a class of overdetained prisoners --F.R.D. ---, 2007 WL 896282 (D.D.C. March 26, 2007).
In Carl A. Barnes, et al., v. District of Columbia, supra, the Plaintiffs have
asserted only two claims. These are overdetention and a strip search upon return to the
D.C. Detention Center immediately after the court released them from criminal charges.
In this pending case, Plaintiff has alleged he was overdetained. However,
Plaintiff in this case had not been to court and then strip searched upon his return as in
Barnes. Some weeks after the charges had been dismissed Plaintiff was subjected to an
unreasonable strip search when correctional officers were looking for a large radio that
had been misappropriated by an inmate not housed near where Plaintiff was housed.

Since Plaintiff was not strip searched upon his return from court, the facts he must prove
at trial are decidedly different from those the class action plaintiffs must prove. In this
pending case, Plaintiff, Daniel Simmons, must prove the search was unreasonable.
According to this Court’s Order dated March 27, 2008 Plaintiff’s, Daniel
Simmons, overdetention claim “does not meet the criteria for membership in the Barnes
Strip Search Class.”
Additionally Plaintiff’s initial Complaint and his pending Motion to Amend his
Complaint with proposed Amended Complaint attached filed on May 6, 2008 avers
additional causes of action which are not contained in the class action suit that Defendant
seeks to have Plaintiff’s complaint consolidated with. These are:
A.

In Plaintiff’s proposed Amended Complaint in Count Three Plaintiff

alleges Negligence. This claim is not part of the Barnes Strip Search Class.
B.

In Plaintiff’s proposed Amended Complaint in Count Four, Plaintiff

alleges Negligent Supervision, Training and Hiring. Again this claim is not part of the
Barnes Strip Search Class. In Count Three and Four of Plaintiff’s proposed Amended
Complaint the proofs required at trial are distinctly different from those required in the
Barnes Strip Search Class.
POINTS AND AUTHORITIES:
F.R.C.P., Rule 42 ( a) permits the Court to consolidate claims where the cases
involve common questions of law or fact. Plaintiff’s pending amended Complaint and
the Barnes Strip Search Class do not involve common questions of law and fact
sufficient to warrant consolidation.
F.R.C.P. 42 ( a ) “is permissive and vests a purely discretionary power in the

district court.” In re Air Crash Disaster at Florida Everglades, 549 F.2d 1006, 1013 ( 5th
Cir. 1977). See also 9 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure Section 2838 at 439-40 (1994) (although consolidation under Rule 42 ( a ) may
be warranted because of a common issue of law or fact, it is not required).
In determining whether consolidation of cases is appropriate, the court must
“weigh considerations of convenience and economy against considerations of confusion
and prejudice.” Scarborough v. National Association of Surety Bond Producers, 474 F.
Supp. 2d 64 (D.C. 2007).
In its Memorandum Opinion of March 28, 2008 this Court has already determined
this pending case does not meet the criteria needed to consolidate it with the Barnes Strip
Search Class. That Decision constitutes the Law of the Case and should not be disturbed.
WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth herein and the pleadings on file, Plaintiff,
Daniel Simmons, respectfully requests the Defendant’s Motion be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
