DEFENDANT, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA’S, MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND
AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE WITH PENDING
CLASS ACTION
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), Defendant, the District of Columbia (hereinafter “the
District”), by and through undersigned counsel, moves this Court for an order consolidating the
above-captioned action with a pending certified class action, and in support thereof avers:
I.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, in the above captioned action, alleges that he was overdetained in the D.C. Jail,

based upon the District’s alleged practice of allowing jail inmates to stay past their term of
incarceration. Plaintiff’s claims are similar, if not identical, to those alleged in Carl A. Barnes, et
al., v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315 (RCL), which has been certified as a class
of overdetained prisoners. ---F.R.D.---, 2007 WL 896282 (D.D.C. March 26, 2007). Both
actions are based on the same factual allegations and legal theories.
II.

LEGAL ARGUMENT
Under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may consolidate

separately filed cases when the cases involve a common question of law or fact. See Fed. R. Civ.

Case 1:07-cv-00493-RCL

P. 42(a). Although it is sufficient for purposes of Rule 42(a) if the actions involve only one
common question of law or fact, the Barnes and Simmons actions involve a multitude of
common questions of both law and fact. Those common questions are not peripheral issues; they
go to the very heart of these two actions. The common questions of law and fact include, but
certainly are not limited to those stated by this Court in its Memorandum Opinion in Simmons, to
wit:
The allegations in this case are similar, if not identical, to the claims made
in two class action lawsuits previously before this Court, Bynum v. District
of Columbia, Civil Action No. 02- 956 (RCL) and Barnes v. District of
Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315 (RCL). In those cases and in this one,
plaintiffs alleged that they had been detained by the District of Columbia’s
Department of Corrections (“DOC”) beyond the point at which their release
had been ordered. Plaintiffs in the prior two suits further alleged that they
were subjected to strip searches during the period of their overdetention. In
the instant matter, plaintiff claims, inter alia, that he was subjected to a
body cavity strip search during the weeks after charges against him were
dropped.

(Memorandum Opinion [Dkt. 18], March 24, 2008, page 1). Indeed, the Barnes and Simmons’
actions are so nearly identical that the common legal and factual issues overwhelm any minor
issues that are not common to both cases. See Allen v. McEntee, Nos. 92-0776, 92-2151, 1993
WL 121,513, at *3 (D.D.C. Apr. 5, 1993) ("The near identity of the complaints in these two
actions provides ample basis for consolidation.").
This Court should exercise its discretion to consolidate these actions because such
consolidation will serve the interests of justice. See 9 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,
Federal Practice and Procedure § 2383 (2d ed. 1995). Among other things, consolidation will
produce significant savings of time and resources for the Court and the parties. In contrast,
having virtually identical cases proceed in a parallel fashion would generate needless duplication
of effort.

Consolidation will achieve substantial efficiencies and savings without sacrificing
fairness. These cases are at nearly the same point in the pretrial process. Simmons has yet to file
an amended complaint; Barnes is in pretrial informal discovery. As a result, consolidation will
not cause the trial of one action to be delayed while discovery is completed in the other action, as
is sometimes the case.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons of fact and law, the District of Columbia requests that this

Court enter an order consolidating Daniel Simmons v. The District of Columbia, et al., Civil
Action 07-00493, with Carl A. Barnes, et al., v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315
(RCL).

ORDER
Before the court is the motion to consolidate filed by the Defendant, District of
Columbia, in the above-captioned civil action, Daniel Simmons v. The District of Columbia, et
al., Civil Action 07-00493. Defendant moves for consolidation of this case with another case
Carl A. Barnes, et al., v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315 (RCL), which has been
certified by this Court as a class of overdetained prisoners. ---F.R.D.---, 2007 WL 896282
(D.D.C. March 26, 2007).
Under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may consolidate
separately filed cases when the cases involve a common question of law or fact. See Fed. R. Civ.
P. 42(a). The Court enjoys broad discretion when deciding whether to grant a motion to
consolidate.
Upon careful consideration of defendant’s motion to consolidate, the plaintiff’s response,
and the entire record, the Court, having determined that these cases involve the same or similar
legal issues, concludes that consolidation of the above-captioned cases is appropriate.
Accordingly, it is this ___________ day of _________________, 2008, hereby

Case 1:07-cv-00493-RCL

ORDERED that defendant’s motion to consolidate is GRANTED; and it is further
ORDERED that the matters of Daniel Simmons v. The District of Columbia, et al., Civil
Action 07-00493 and Carl A. Barnes, et al., v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315
(RCL) are hereby CONSOLIDATED; and it is further
ORDERED that all further pleadings and other matters related to the consolidated cases
be file in Carl A. Barnes, et al., v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 06-315 (RCL).
