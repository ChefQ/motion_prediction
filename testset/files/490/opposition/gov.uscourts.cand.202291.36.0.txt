Introduction

2
3

Filed 06/20/2008

In Plaintiff’s “Motion for Sanctions,” Plaintiff claims Defendants and their counsel acted
in subjectively bad faith. Defendants addressed Issues 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 in their separate
“Opposition to Plaintiff TVIA’s Motion to Remand” and incorporate that Opposition by
reference here. Defendants showed in their separate Opposition their legal arguments are

6

supported by the U.S. Supreme Court cases, as well as the plain language of several statutes.
7

Therefore, only Issues 3 and 8 remain.

Legal Analysis

9
10
11

A.

PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS UNDER RULE 11 IS IMPROPER
Plaintiff asks for sanctions under Rule 11. See Plaintiff’s Motion, 5:11 (“28 U.S.C.

12

§1446(a) expressly incorporates the Rule 11 standard.”) See also Plaintiff’s caption, “NOTICE

13

OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §§ 1927

14

AND 1446(a), FRCP 11, AND, LR7-8.” (Emphasis added.)

15
16
17

Under Rule 11, a motion for sanctions “shall not” be filed with or presented to the court if
the opposing party corrects the alleged violation within the 21 day “safe harbor” provided under
the Rule:

18
19
20
21
22
23

A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from
other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct
alleged to violate subdivision (b) . It shall be served as provided in
Rule 5, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless,
within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other period as the
court may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention,
allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected .
[Emphasis added.]
Plaintiff never mailed or emailed its Motion for Sanctions to Defendants or their counsel;

24

therefore, Plaintiff, in attempting to receive sanctions under Rule 11, violated the very rule it
25

seeks to use. See Declaration of Matthew Rafat, paragraph 10.
26
27
28

In this Circuit, "[t]he procedural requirements of Rule 11(c)(1)(A)'s safe harbor are
mandatory.” Radcliffe v. Rainbow Constr. Co., 254 F.3d 772, 789 (9th Cir. 2001). "[A] motion

for sanctions must not be filed if the alleged violation is corrected by the opposing party within

2

the twenty-one day `safe-harbor' period." Giganti v. Gen-X Strategies, Inc., 222 F.R.D. 299, 305-

3

5

Elliott v. Tilton, 64 F.3d 213, 216 (5`'' Cir . 1995). Having failed to comply with Rule 11,
Plaintiff is not entitled to sanctions. In addition, its improper filing for sanctions demonstrates

6

that it is Plaintiff, not Defendants, who are making unnecessary, unsupported filings.

B.

EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL PREVENTS PLAINTIFF FROM SEEKING
SANCTIONS

9

Once Defendants accepted Plaintiff’s counsel’s offer to remand “or” be faced with a fee

10
11

request, equitable estoppel prevents Plaintiff from changing its position. As the United States
Supreme Court noted, one “who, by his language or conduct, leads another to do what he would

12

not otherwise have done, shall not subject such person to loss or injury by disappointing the
13

expectations upon which he acted.” Dickerson v. Colgrove, 100 U.S. 578, 25 L. Ed. 618 (1879).
14
15
16

See also: Olson Distributing Systems, Inc. v. Glasurit America, Inc., 850 F.2d 295 (6th Cir.
1988).

17

Once Defendants’ counsel Gregory Charles accepted Defendants’ agreement to

18

voluntarily remand the action (saying, “Thank You”), Plaintiff waived any fees associated with

19

the federal action. See Decl, Rafat, emails attached as Exhibit 1. Mr. Charles made an

20

“either/or” offer—either Defendants agree to a remand, which they did, “or” they would be liable

21

for attorneys’ fees. Mr. Charles broke his own word solely to generate attorneys’ fees and harass

22
23

Defendants.
If Plaintiff alleges that Defendants were demanding that Plaintiff waive all possible fees

24

in a case that had just started, its position is unreasonable and unsupported by law or fact. Such a
25

position is not legally possible, because a federal judge cannot order parties to waive fees in an
26
27
28

underlying state action once s/he remands the case. A federal judge, after remand, lacks
jurisdiction to make any substantive orders affecting the state court proceedings.

If Plaintiff alleges that it had to file a response to the outstanding 12(b)(6) motion, its

2

argument does not comport with equitable estoppel, nor the intent Defendants’ counsel expressed

3

on May 5, 2008, to file the motion to dismiss in state court. Indeed, there would be no reason for

4
5

Defendants’ counsel to ask for a hearing date for a demurrer unless he intended to remove the
12(b)(6) motion to the state format of a demurrer per CCP 430.90(a).

6

Thus, it is only because of Plaintiff’s misunderstanding of CCP 430.90(a), and its
7

unreasonable refusal to provide a hearing date for a demurrer (the state version of a 12(b)(6)) that
8
9
10

Defendants and this Court are here. It is telling that at no point in time did Plaintiff ever provide
a hearing date. Under Santa Clara County Superior Court local rules, a hearing date must be

11

cleared before filing a motion.

Issue Number 8: Plaintiff Acted Unreasonably and Sought to Improperly Avoid a
Demurrer

13

1.
14
15
16
17

Defendants’ Counsel Agreed to a Stipulation after One Email Requesting a
Voluntary Remand

Plaintiff claims that Defendants and their Counsel demanded that Plaintiff waive any
right to seek costs and attorney’s fees as a condition to a stipulation for an order of remand.
Plaintiff is misleading the Court. The emails attached to Matthew Rafat’s separate Declaration

18

for this Opposition show Defendants’ counsel did everything possible to get this case back to
19

state court without the need for further motions or court intervention.
20
21
22

On May 1, 2008, Gregory Charles, Plaintiff’s outside counsel, sent an email at 5:47PM
stating that if he did not hear back from me by May 5, 2008, he would file a motion for remand.

23

His exact words were, “Unless you stipulate to a remand, we will be forced to file a motion,

24

which will subject you to costs and attorneys’ fees…In that event [if Defendants refused to a

25

stipulation], we will include in our request for fees the time associated with the aforementioned

26

motion.” This email indicated a simple offer: agree to a stipulation, or be subject to fees and

27

costs. Plaintiff’s counsel offered an “Either/Or” proposition.

Page 5 of 11

On May 1, 2008, at 8:04PM—less than three hours later—Defendants’ counsel replied,

2

stating, “I have spoken to my clients. We are amenable to voluntarily remanding this action to

3

state court…Defendants will voluntarily remand this action back to state court, and of course,

4
5

since no filings have occurred, TVIA is not entitled to any attorneys’ fees or costs.”
On May 2, 2008, Defendant’s counsel wrote an email to Mr. Charles, stating, “I am

6

happy to sign anything you want; however, I have already requested that the judge remand the
7

case voluntarily.” [emphasis added] The intent of this email was to demonstrate good faith and a
8
9
10

willingness to voluntarily remand to state court on the terms Mr. Charles had offered on May 1,
2008 (i.e., stipulate to a voluntary remand, “or” be faced with paying attorneys’ fees).

11

On May 2, 2008, at 1:32PM, Mr. Charles wrote back, saying, “Thank You.”

12

Nothing happened between May 2, 2008 and May 5, 2008, except for one event. On May

13

5, 2008, at 12:12PM, Plaintiff’s counsel asked, Mr. Stamp, Plaintiff’s in-house counsel, for a

14

date for the demurrer once the Court remanded the Complaint to state court. This request for a

15

date apparently upset Mr. Stamp, causing a complete reversal of Plaintiff’s willingness to

16
17

cooperate.
On May 5, 2008, Plaintiff’s in-house counsel sent an email showing he did not want to be faced

18

with a demurrer in state court:
19
20
21
22
23

It is inappropriate to schedule a motion in the state court
action while the case is still pending in federal court. Also,
your refusal to copy Mr. Charles on your request to clear dates
also constitutes a violation of the court's rules.
Mr. Stamp’s refusal to provide a date for the demurrer in state court violated the
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.90(a), which allows the scheduling of a demurrer

24

as a matter of right. See CCP 430.90(a):
25
26
27

Where the defendant has removed a civil action to federal court without
filing a response in the original court and the case is later remanded for
improper removal, the time to respond shall be as follows:

If the defendant has not generally appeared in either the original or
federal court, then 30 days from the day the original court receives the case on
remand to move to dismiss the action…if the court has not ruled on a similar
motion filed by the defendant prior to the removal of the action to federal court.
Since nothing substantive happened between the agreement to remand back to state court

5

and the request for a date for Defendants’ demurrer, the only rational explanation for the

6

adversarial stance after May 5, 2008, is that Plaintiff’s in-house counsel did not want to be

7

subject to a demurrer and decided to violate local state court rules.

8
9
10
11

After this email exchange between Jeff Stamp and Defendants’ counsel, Mr. Charles’
willingness to move forward on the agreement to voluntarily remand changed. See email dated
May 6, 2008, less than twenty-four hours after the email requesting a date for Plaintiff’s
demurrer: “We are tired of your constant posturing…My client has now incurred over a

12

$1,000.00 in fees dealing with your patently improper removal of the case.”
13

Nothing substantive except a request for a demurrer date occurred between the “Thank
14
15
16
17

You” and the latter email, suddenly demanding $1,000 in fees. (All emails mentioned above are
attached to Matthew Rafat’s Declaration, submitted along with this separate Opposition.)
Defendants agree with Mr. Charles’ rationale for sanctions as stated in Plaintiff’s Motion

18

for Sanctions. Plaintiff cites 28 U.S.C. §§ 1927. Section 1927 authorizes sanctions against an

19

attorney who “multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.” Emails

20

show Mr. Gregory Charles, acting on the direction of Mr. Jefferson Stamp, refused to adhere to

21

his own offer to stipulate to a remand and then suddenly demanded 1,000 dollars from

22
23

Defendants. As a result of failing to cooperate with Defendants’ counsel, Mr. Charles and Mr.
Stamp fall within the definition of sanctionable conduct they themselves give the Court.

24

Defendants’ conduct smacks of bad faith, violates the very Rule they have invoked, and should
25

not be condoned. Therefore, Defendants request sanctions against them and their client, as stated
26
27

in Mr. Rafat’s Declaration, paragraph 11.

Plaintiff’s Decision to Take an Unreasonable Stance Should not Raise Costs for
Defendants

2

4

Defendants are individuals. They are not a corporation that has a litigation budget set
aside, and no insurance policy is covering their attorneys’ fees in this case. As a result,

5

Defendants’ counsel had and has a strong incentive to cooperate with Plaintiff’s counsel to

6

minimize attorneys’ fees. It is Plaintiff’s prerogative if it wants to file unnecessary motions. It

7

apparently has the funds to do so. But to transfer their unwise choice to Defendants does not

8

comport with notions of fair play.

3.

Plaintiff’s Sudden Demand for Attorneys’ Fees is Suspicious

Plaintiff will argue in its reply that Defendant’s counsel wanted Plaintiff to waive their
attorneys’ fees. But at the time Defendants’ counsel agreed to sign a stipulate, the offer to

12

remand was based on no attorneys’ fees being transferred to defendants. Mr. Charles email
13

dated May 1, 2008 demanded that Defendants agree to a remand “or” be faced with “fees for the
14
15
16

time associated with the aforementioned [remand] motion.” Once defendants and their counsel
agreed, even stating, “I am happy to sign anything you want,” they relied on Plaintiff’s

17

representation and were not liable for any of their fees. In addition, Plaintiff had not expended

18

1,000 dollars on May 1, 2008 when it sent its email offering a stipulation, or even by May 5,

19

2008, when a total of six one page emails had been sent back and forth between counsels. The

20

mere fact that by May 6, 2008, Plaintiff was suddenly demanding 1000 dollars and is now

21

demanding over 8,000 dollars should indicate that these motions before the Court were filed to

22
23

manufacture attorneys’ fees. Defendants cannot tell Plaintiff how to spend its money—but
Defendants should not be liable for fees not wisely spent. Plaintiff’s counsel never spent the five

24

minutes it would have required to draft a stipulation to remand this case back to state court. See
25

Declaration of Matthew Rafat, paragraph 12. Had either of Plaintiff’s counsels drafted a
26
27
28

stipulation including the terms of their offer to voluntarily remand to state court on May 1, 2008,
none of these motions before the Court would have been necessary.

Issue Number 9: Plaintiff Accuses Defendants’ Counsel of Taking Frivolous
Positions

2
3
4

Plaintiff raises the following issue: “Mr. Rafat has acted in subjective bad faith and taken
frivolous positions.” While defendants believe that their Opposition to the Motion to Remand

5

sufficiently refutes this accusation, and sanctions are improperly requested under Rule 11,

6

Plaintiff is also asking for sanctions under 28 USC Section 1927, where sanctions “must be

7

supported by a finding of subjective bad faith….[R]eckless nonfrivolous filings, without more,

8

may not be sanctioned.” There is no evidence that supports any finding of subjective bad faith

9

on the part of defendants or their counsel.

10
11

In addition, Defendants are skeptical that Plaintiff had to incur 8,000 dollars in fees to
remand this case after an agreement to remand in principle was reached within the same day as

12

Defendants’ May 1, 2008 request for a voluntarily remand.
13

This Court should not view Defendants’ counsel’s willingness to remand voluntarily as an
14
15
16

indication of the underlying legal support for the removal. The only indication this Court should take
from the immediate willingness to voluntarily remand was an effort to minimize Defendants’

17

attorneys’ fees and costs through cooperation. Thus, a finding of subjective bad faith would run

18

contrary not only to the facts, but to the Rule 11 standard, which allows for vigorous representation.

19

Indeed, if anyone has demonstrated subjective bad faith, it is Plaintiff. This case before this

20

Court is the third case Plaintiff has filed against these Defendants in the last three years. Plaintiff has

21

filed two other cases against Defendants in Santa Clara County Superior Court. One case was

22
23

dismissed, and Plaintiff continues to refuse to reimburse Defendants for their filing fees, despite the
filing of a memorandum of costs.

24

The other state court case involved 14 motions and 219 filings and is set for trial on
25

September 15, 2008. See Decl, Rafat, paragraph 4. It is notable that Plaintiff did not file this new
26
27
28

case until it became apparent that Defendants were willing to go to trial. Much of the filings in the
state court case involved discovery matters that would have never occurred had the case been in

1

federal court’s less adversarial (and some might say, more civilized) discovery system. Thus,

2

Defendants had reasonable grounds under an objective as well as subjective reading of the law in

3

filing their notice of removal to federal court.

4
5

Plaintiff cites Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132 (2005) in asking for sanctions.
First, the Martin Court’s holding supports Defendants’ position:

6

We hold that, absent unusual circumstances, attorney’s fees should
not be awarded when the removing party has an objectively reasonable
basis for removal… when an objectively reasonable basis exists, fees
should be denied. See, e.g., Hornbuckle, 385 F.3d, at 541; Valdes v.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 199 F.3d 290, 293 (CA5 2000)” (emphasis added)

7
8
9

Thus, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that attorneys’ fees had to be awarded

10
11

automatically upon remand. Defendants have cited Supreme Court cases, such as United States v.

12

O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 650 (1997), supporting its arguments in their Opposition to Plaintiff’s

13

Motion to Remand. They had an objectively reasonable basis for removal. Second, this case is

14

distinguishable because it involves a class action.

15

E.

16
17

Issue Number 3: Plaintiff Misrepresents the Import of a State Discovery Ruling
Plaintiff alleges that “Mr. Rafat deliberately misrepresented Wang’s residency in the

Notice of Removal (“NOR”).” In plain language, Plaintiff is accusing Defendants’ counsel of

18

lying to the Court, a serious allegation.
19

Plaintiff cites a state discovery ruling that required Defendant Wang to travel from China
20
21
22

to California for his deposition. First, the basis for Mr. Wang’s residency was supported by his
own earlier declaration, which was attached as “Exhibit B” to the Notice of Removal. This

23

declaration stated that Mr. Wang lived in China. See Exhibit 2 attached to Decl of Rafat, “I am

24

currently in China.” Second, the state court found residency in the state of California for

25

purposes of a deposition appearance. Prior to signing with The Law Office of Matthew Rafat,

26

Mr. Wang had been pro se. While pro se, he listed a Santa Clara County, California address to

27

receive papers as a courtesy to Plaintiff. The state court interpreted that courtesy as evidence

that Mr. Wang had sufficient contacts with California to order him to travel from China to

2

California for his deposition.

3
4
5

Under FRCP 28(b), the result may have been different had a federal judge considered the
difficult issue of ordering a Chinese resident who spends most of his time in China to travel to
California for his deposition. A discovery ruling by a state court judge is not dispositive, and is

6

certainly not evidence of any deliberate misrepresentation to the Court.
7

Conclusion
8
9
10
11
12
13

Plaintiff presented to the Court, in violation of Rule 11, a Rule 11 motion for the improper
purposes of obtaining an unfair advantage over Plaintiffs, biasing the Court against Plaintiffs, and
needlessly increasing the cost of litigation.
Defendants will let Justice Stevens have the last word, from a dissent in Cooter & Gell v.
Hartmarx, 496 U.S. 384 (1990):

14

Despite the changes that have taken place at the bar since I left the
active practice 20 years ago, I still believe that most lawyers are wise
enough to know that their most precious asset is their professional
reputation. Filing unmeritorious pleadings inevitably tarnishes that asset.
Those who do not understand this simple truth can be dealt with in
appropriate disciplinary proceedings, state law actions for malicious
prosecution or abuse of process, or, in extreme cases, contempt
proceedings. It is an unnecessary waste of judicial resources and an
unwarranted perversion of the Federal Rules to hold such lawyers liable
for Rule 11 sanctions in actions in federal court.

15
16
17
18
19
20

Defendants hope they have shown the court that they and their counsel care about their

21

profession reputation and tried to do everything possible, within reason, to avoid burdening this Court

22

with unnecessary motions.
