The undersigned, Matthew Rafat, being first duly sworn, declares as follows:
19

1.

I am over 18 years old, am competent to testify, am basing my statements on personal

20

knowledge, and if called to testify, I will do so willingly.

21
22

2.

at 28 N 1st St., Suite 305, San Jose, CA 95113. I represent Mr. McKee, Wang, and Silva.

23
24

My mailing address is PO Box 111351, Campbell, CA 95011-1351. My office is located

3.

25

Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions. All emails attached in Exhibit 1 are true

26

27

and myself from May 1, 2008 to May 6, 2008.

Attached as Exhibit 2 is a true and accurate copy of Mr. Steve Wang’s declaration in a

2

state case where Plaintiff sued him as well as my other clients. This case involved 14

3

motions and 219 filings and is set for trial on September 15, 2008. Mr. Gregory Charles

4

and Mr. Jefferson Stamp have requested thousands of dollars of sanctions against my

5

clients and my firm in state court, but the state court has not awarded any sanctions

6

requested by them.
7

5.

This Court would be the first Court to grant Plaintiff or their counsels any request for

8

sanctions as of June 19, 2008. This Court would also be the first Court to ever enforce

9

written sanctions against my firm.

10
11

6.

Mr. Jefferson Stamp violated the spirit of California Code of Civil Procedure Section

12

430.90(a) by refusing to provide a hearing date for Defendants’ demurrer (See Exhibit 1,

13

Jefferson Stamp’s email dated May 5, 2008 at 11:41AM).

14

7.

15

Mr. Jefferson Stamp has a pattern of violating court rules. Recently, Mr. Stamp appears to
have violated a state court order expressly barring him from attempting to view

16

Defendants’ personal records. On February 14, 2008, Judge Manoukian of Santa Clara

17

County Superior Court entered an order barring Plaintiff’s in-house counsel from viewing

18

Defendants’ personal records. See true and accurate copy of Court Order, attached as
19

Exhibit 3: “limited to attorneys’ of record, not including in-house counsel.” During the ex
20

parte hearing, Judge Manoukian told Plaintiff’s counsel he had intended in a prior order to

21

prevent in-house counsel Jeff Stamp from viewing any of Defendants’ personal records.

22
23

8.

On, June 13, 2008, Jefferson Stamp signed and sent a subpoena to California Pacific Bank

24

asking for “Any and all documents relating, referring or pertaining to Qibee, Inc.” See

25

Exhibit 4, attached, for true and accurate copy of subpoena. Plaintiff’s case in state courts

26

alleges a conspiracy between defendants and Qibee, but testimony of Plaintiff’s own

1

business partners establishes that Plaintiff lost no money as a result of any alleged

2

transaction with Qibee.

3

9.

4

If Plaintiff’s case relies upon an assumption that my clients engaged in a “conspiracy”
with another company involving Qibee, Mr. Stamp should have carved out an exception to

5

his subpoena to ensure compliance with a court order and failed to do so.

6

10.

Plaintiff and its counsels never mailed or emailed their Motion for Sanctions to

7

Defendants or my firm 21 days prior to filing it. They violated the safe harbor provisions
8

of Rule 11.

9
10

11.

My firm has spent in excess of twenty hours drafting oppositions and declarations to

11

Plaintiff’s Motions. My clients are being charged at a rate of 190/hr. They owe $3,800.

12

Defendants and I believe accepted Mr. Charles’ offer to voluntarily remand to state court

13

and were still faced with numerous motions, some of which were filed improperly (e.g.,

14

no safe harbor, etc). Due to Plaintiff’s reneging of its original offer on May 1, 2008, my

15

clients have had to spend $3,800 in fees. We request that they be reimbursed for these

16
17

fees by order of the Court.
12.

At no point in time did either Mr. Gregory Charles or Mr. Jefferson Stamp provide me

18

with a stipulation they drafted or desired.
19

13.

I am a graduate of Santa Clara Law School and take my obligations to adhere to the

20
21
22

principles of “compassion, competence, and conscience” seriously. I am on the Consumer
Affairs Advisory Commission for Santa Clara County and was a volunteer Supervising

23

Attorney for the Katharine & George Alexander Community Law Center, which provides

24

pro bono advice and representation. I have intended to act in bad faith in any cases in

25

which my firm is involved.

26

28

The undersigned hereby declares under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct under
the laws of the State of California and executes this Declaration on June 20, 2008 in San Jose, CA.
Dated: June 20, 2008
