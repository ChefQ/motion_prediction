TO THE HONORABLE SAMUEL CONTI AND BENJAMIN SILVA, TSU HSIEN “STEVE” WANG,

17
18

MATTHEW MCKEE, AND MATTHEW RAFAT, ESQ. AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT on July 11, 2008 at 9:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as the matter

19

may be heard in Courtroom 1 of the United States District Court for the Northern District of

20

California, located at 450 Golden Gate Ave., San Francisco, California, Plaintiff Tvia, Inc. (“Tvia”)

21

will and hereby moves to sanction Benjamin Silva (“Silva”), Tsu Hsien “Steve” Wang, Matthew

22

McKee (“Mckee”), and Matthew Rafat, Esq. in the amount of $8,172.50. This motion is predicated

23

upon fact that the Defendants and Mr. Rafat lacked any objectively reasonable basis to remove this

24

case to federal court based upon the following considerations.

25
26

1. Silva, Wang, and McKee (“Defendants”) removed this case from the Superior Court for the
State of California on April 9, 2008 citing “Diversity Jurisdiction and Preemption Under
Securities Laws” as a bases for subject matter jurisdiction;

27

2. Tvia and at least three of the Defendants are residents of the State of California;

28

3. Mr. Rafat deliberately misrepresented Wang’s residency in the Notice of Removal (“NOR”);

4. Even if there were diversity, a defendant cannot remove a case in his or her home state;

2

5. The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which the Defendants did not attach to the NOR,
only asserts causes of action arising under state law;
6. Only three of the Defendants joined in the NOR;

4

7. The Defendants did not attach “all process, pleadings, and orders” served on the Defendants
to the NOR;

5

8. The Defendants and their Counsel insist that Tvia waive any right to seek costs and
attorney’s fees and this Court enter an order scheduling deadlines in state court as a
condition to a stipulation for an order of remand;

8

9. Mr. Rafat has acted in subjective bad faith and taken frivolous positions.

9

This Motion for Sanctions is based on this Notice of Motion, the following Memorandum of

10

Points and Authorities, the accompanying Declaration of Gregory J. Charles, Esq. and its exhibits,

11

the Request for Judicial Notice, the pleadings and evidence on file in this action, and on such other

12

evidence and argument as may be presented by Tvia at the hearing on the motion.

POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
A. Procedural History.

14
15

Tvia filed this case in the Superior Court on February 1, 2008. The Plaintiff is a Delaware

16

Corporation that maintains its principal place of business in Santa Clara County, California (R.J.N.,

17

Ex. 1). Tvia served Silva, Wang, and Bjorkstrom more than thirty days ago (Charles Dec., Ex. 1).

18

The Defendants removed this case on April 9, 2008 (Doc. No. 1).

1

19

B. Sanctions are appropriate when the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable
basis for seeking removal.

20
21

The Supreme Court settled the standard for awarding attorney’s fees when remanding a case

22

to state court in Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132 (2005). The Court held that “the

23

standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal” Id. at 141. Sanctions

24

are available, “where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking

25
26
27
28

1

Incredibly, the Defendants did not attach the FAC to the Notice of Removal, so the Court has nothing before it
indicating subject matter jurisdiction. Tvia attached the First Amended Complaint to a request for Judicial Notice for
the convenience of the Court but reserves all substantive and procedural remedies regarding the Defendant’s noncompliance with 28 U.S.C. 1446(a).

removal” Id. “Bad faith need not be demonstrated” to award fees. Moore v. Permanente Med.

2

Group, Inc., 981 F.2d 443, 448 (9th Cir. 1992).
C. Since Tvia, Wang, Silva, & Mckee are residents of the State of California, the
Defendants could not objectively assert that the parties are diverse.

4
5

The NOR cites diversity of citizenship as a basis for jurisdiction but fails to state the

6

residency of each party. If the plaintiff and any defendant share citizenship of the same state,

7

diversity is incomplete, and the federal court lacks jurisdiction. Inecon Agricorporation v. Tribal

8

Farms, Inc., 656 F.2d 498, 500 (9th Cir. 1981). Tvia, Silva, Wang, and Mckee are residents of

9

California (R.J.N., Ex. 1 & Charles Dec., Ex. 1).

2

10

D. Since a federal question does not appear on the face of the FAC, the Defendants could
not objectively remove this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331.

Document 25

When federal question is cited as a basis of removal, the question “must be disclosed upon

13

the face of the complaint, unaided by the answer or by the petition for removal.” Gully v. First Nat’l

14

Bank in Meridian, 299 U.S. 109, 112-13 (1936). Thus, the rule enables the plaintiff, as “master of

15

the complaint,” to “choose to have the cause heard in state court” by eschewing claims based on

16

federal law. Calif. ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynegy, Inc., 375 F.3d 831, 839 (9th Cir. 2004). Here, the

17

Defendants did not attach the FAC to the NOR. Therefore, nothing before the Court indicates a

18

federal question. Moreover, the FAC asserts no federal claims (R.J.N., Ex. 1). In Rains v. Criterion

19

Systems, Inc., 80 F.3d 339, 344 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit wrote:

20

Rains chose to bring a state claim rather than a Title VII claim, and was entitled to
do so … A plaintiff “may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state
law.” Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 2429, 96
L.Ed.2d 318 (1987); see also Ethridge v. Harbor House Restaurant, 861 F.2d
1389, 1395 (9th Cir.1988) (“If the plaintiff may sue on either state or federal
grounds, the plaintiff may avoid removal simply by relying exclusively on the
state law claim”).

21
22
23
24

Here, Tvia did just that. While the case involves insider trading, the Plaintiff only asserts causes of

25

action under state law, and the allegations of the FAC do not disclose a federal question. Thus, the

26

Defendants acted in an objectively unreasonable manner.

27
2

28

The Defendants concede the point. On May 6, 2008, their Counsel stated, “I do not contest that (sic) defendants lack
diversity jurisdiction” (Charles Dec., Ex. 2).

In the present matter, the Defendants do not assert an objectively reasonable basis for
3

3

asserting complete preemption as a basis for subject matter jurisdiction. In fact, the Defendants’

4

Counsel admits that he did “extensive research” but could not find a single case “relating to this pre-

5

emption.” Despite finding no authority, the Defendants and their Counsel assert that subject matter

6

jurisdiction is somehow established by “a good faith belief that federal securities laws pre-empt a

7

state court complaint that alleges securities fraud based on shareholder diminution in value” (Doc.

8

No. 17, ¶18).

E. Reliance on the Doctrine of Complete Preemption is objectively unreasonable.

2

Campeau Goodsell Smith

Document 25

4

While the Defendants could not find a single case supporting their position, the Supreme

10

Court directly addressed this issue in 2006. The holding demonstrates that the Defendants’ “good

11

faith belief” is not objectively reasonable. Specifically, the Defendants rely on the Private Securities

12

Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) as a basis for complete preemption, but the assertion is

13

specious. In fact, the 9th Circuit expressly noted that “class action attorneys avoided its reach by

14

filing their securities class actions in state court under state and common law.” U.S. Mortg., Inc. v.

15

Jensen, 494 F.3d 833, 841 (9th Cir. 2007). The fact that the PSLRA addresses federal securities

16

claims further demonstrates the Defendants’ bad faith.

17
18

3

The notion of complete preemption is an exception to the well pleaded complaint rule, but the doctrine is rarely
invoked and carefully limited.

19

The jurisdictional doctrine of complete preemption serves as an exception to the well-pleaded complaint
rule. Balcorta v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 208 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir. 2000). It provides that,
in some instances, “the preemptive force of [federal statutes] is so strong that they completely preempt an
area of state law. In such instances, any claim purportedly based on that preempted state law is
considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under federal law.” … Complete
preemption, however, arises only in “extraordinary” situations. Id. at 1183-84 … The United States
Supreme Court has identified only three federal statutes that satisfy this test: (1) Section 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185; (2) Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1132; and (3) the usury provisions of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C.
§§ 85, 86. Beneficial Nat’l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 156 L. Ed. 2d 1, 123 S. Ct. 2058, 2062-64
(2003). Ansley v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co., 340 F.3d 858, 862 (9th Cal. 2003).

Mr. Rafat stated in a declaration under penalty of perjury.
Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges securities law violations and shareholder loss based on insider trading. Its
complaint alleges that the stock price of TVIA decreased as a result of insider trading and fraud. Thus, Section
10(b) of the 1934 Act may pre-empt California Corporations Code 25502.5, because the Corporations Code
allows a lower standard of pleading than what is allowed under the PSLRA. As such, there may be a direct
conflict between federal and state securities law. However, my firm has done extensive research, and we
have not found any case on point relating to this pre-emption (emphasis added) (Doc. No. 17, ¶20).

to the migration of class actions to state court to avoid the PSLRA, but the statute only applies to

3

class action lawsuits for securities fraud. Consequently, it cannot have an objectively reasonable

4

application in a case in which a single plaintiff is suing six defendants. The Supreme Court

5

specifically addressed this issue in Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 126 S. Ct.

6

1503, 1514 (2006) and expressly held that SLUSA does not preempt any state law claims asserted

7

by an individual plaintiff. While conducting their “extensive research,” the Defendants must have

8

found this recent Supreme Court decision directly contrary to their “a good faith belief.” Thus, the

9

Defendants acted in bad faith and in an objectively unreasonable manner.

5

F. Sanctions against Mr. Rafat are warranted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1927 & 1446(a).

The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA) was enacted in response

10

Campeau Goodsell Smith

Document 25

28 U.S.C. §1446(a) expressly incorporates the Rule 11 standard. Further, §1927 authorizes

12

sanctions against an attorney who “multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and

13

vexatiously …” Here, Mr. Rafat falsely certified that the parties are diverse. Although the FAC

14

only asserts causes of action under state law, he falsely asserted that a federal question exists on the

15

face of the pleading which Mr. Rafat did not attach to the NOR. Finally, recent 9th Circuit and

16

Supreme Court cases demonstrate that complete preemption has no applicability to the instant

17

matter. These facts are undisputed.

6

18
19

The deliberate misstatement regarding Wang’s residency demonstrates that Counsel acted
with subjective bad faith. Mr. Rafat stated in the NOR.

20

Plaintiff claims to have served Steve Wang, a resident of China, by substitute service in
California. However, Steve Wang is a resident of China and lives in China. Plaintiff

The Court held, “SLUSA does not actually pre-empt any state cause of action. It simply denies plaintiffs the right to
use the class-action device to vindicate certain claims. The Act does not deny any individual plaintiff, or indeed any
group of fewer than 50 plaintiffs, the right to enforce any state-law cause of action that may exist.”
6

The standard is well defined in this circuit.
[S]ection 1927 sanctions “must be supported by a finding of subjective bad faith.” “Bad faith is present
when an attorney knowingly or recklessly raises a frivolous argument, or argues a meritorious claim for the
purpose of harassing an opponent.” For sanctions to apply, if a filing is submitted recklessly, it must be
frivolous, while if it is not frivolous, it must be intended to harass. Thus, while it is true that reckless filings
may be sanctioned, and nonfrivolous filings may also be sanctioned, reckless nonfrivolous filings, without
more, may not be sanctioned. (internal citations omitted). Moore v. Keegan Mgmt. Co. (In re Keegan

Wang submitted the referenced declaration in opposition to a Motion to Compel his

deposition in those proceedings entitled Tvia, Inc. v. NBG, et al. (Case No. 1-07-CV-084211)

4

pending in the Superior Court. Wang is a party, and Mr. Rafat is his counsel. On January 11, 2008,

5

the Court determined that Wang is a resident of Santa Clara County and ordered his deposition based

6

upon that finding of fact. Since this judicial determination occurred only three months before the

7

removal of this case, Mr. Rafat’s misrepresentation was deliberate, and he acted in subjective bad

8

faith. Thus, the NOR is both reckless and frivolous.

knew that Mr. Wang resided in China, because a declaration had been served on
Plaintiff before. See Exhibit “B.” (Doc. No. 1).

Campeau Goodsell Smith

Document 25

Moreover, Mr. Rafat is also counsel for Silva and Mckee in Tvia, Inc. v. NBG, et al. The

10

Complaint alleges that the Defendants are residents of California (Charles Dec., Ex. 3, ¶¶3-5). The

11

answer admits the allegations of residency (Charles Dec., Ex. 4, ¶3). Tvia’s principal place of

12

business is located in the State of California (R.J.N., Ex. 1, ¶3). Given this fact, an attorney admitted

13

to practice in federal court cannot claim subjective good faith when he removed a case with actual

14

knowledge that the parties are not diverse. Finally, when pressed on this issue, Mr. Rafat conceded,

15

“I do not contest that (sic) defendants lack diversity jurisdiction” (Charles Dec., Ex. 2).

16

Consequently, subjective bad faith and frivolity are admitted.

8

9

17

Mr. Rafat’s bad faith conduct and gamesmanship continued after he removed the case. Tvia

18

7

20

The Court wrote.
In the instant case, although Wang maintains that he is currently in China, Plaintiff offers evidence that Wang
maintains a residence in Saratoga ... This evidence includes Wang’s admission to an allegation in Plaintiff’s
complaint that Wang resides in Saratoga. At this time, there is no evidence before the Court to contradict these
assertions. Additionally, there is no evidence currently before the Court to suggest that Wang has permanently
relocated to China and has no intent to return to Saratoga. The Court accordingly finds that Wang is a
resident of Saratoga and Santa Clara County (emphasis added) (R.J.N., Ex. 2, p. 4).

21
22
23

24

Even if Mr. Rafat somehow feigns ignorance regarding Tvia’s residence, removal is precluded as this action is pending
in the state of the Defendants’ residency. 28 U.S.C. 1441(b).

25

26
27
28

Two other considerations demonstrate that Mr. Rafat should be sanctioned pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1927 & 1446(a).
All defendants must join an effort to remove a case. Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 703 (9th Cir. 1998). Although
Defendant Bjorkstom was served with process on March 10, 2008 (Charles Dec., Ex. 1), Mr. Rafat did not obtain her
approval to remove the case. Finally, “A defendant … desiring to remove any civil action … from a State court shall file
... all process, pleadings, and orders served upon such defendant …” 28 USCS § 1446. Mr. Rafat attached nothing to the
NOR.

Page 7 of 9

attempted to resolve this matter amicably and sent correspondence to him on May 2, 2008 noting

2

each of the aforementioned considerations (Charles Dec., Ex. 5). Mr. Rafat, however, insisted that a

3

stipulation for an order of remand include unsatisfactory conditions such as Tvia waiving any right

4

to seek costs and attorney’s fees and this Court entering an order managing the docket of the

5

Superior Court after the case is remanded.

10

Since the May 2, 2008 correspondence explained in detail why the removal was defective

7

and this Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, a reasonable attorney would have

8

immediately advised his clients to stipulate to an order of remand. The logic is simple. At that

9

point, the attorney’s fees were insignificant as Tvia properly tried to resolve this issue without resort

10

to expensive motion practice. Although advised in writing that he improperly removed the case, Mr.

11

Rafat interposed unacceptable conditions and forced Tvia to file an administrative motion, a motion

12

to remand, and a motion for sanctions.

Document 25

Moreover, his insistence upon an order from this Court regarding time to file responsive

14

pleadings in state court is completely egregious. Tvia objected to the issue as it properly felt that

15

this Court not should enter orders managing the docket of the Superior Court. Moreover, the

16

confabulated “risk of default” is completely frivolous and represents subjective bad faith. A party

17

has thirty days to file responsive pleadings after a case is remanded. Cal. Code Civ. Pro. §430.90.

18

Since Mr. Rafat is admitted to practice law in California, he cannot feign ignorance with respect to

19

this code section. Thus, he had no basis to condition voluntary remand upon a provision in the order

20

setting deadlines to file responsive pleadings.

21
22

10

23
24
25
26

I also want to ensure that my clients are not at risk for a default once the action is remanded to state court.
As a result, the proposed stipulation and order requested a reasonable time wherein my clients would be
able to file a responsive pleading, either a demurrer or an answer, in state court (Doc. No. 18, ¶¶ 5-6).

27
11

28

As of May 7, 2008, Mr. Rafat continues to maintain this position.
I want to be clear: I am not asking the Court to waive anyone’s rights to attorneys’ fees or costs in the
underlying action once the complaint is remanded to state court. The stipulation dealt only with the federal
court awarding fees and costs related to any remand. I am merely ensuring that my clients do not have to
pay for any fees or costs associated with the remand ordered by the federal court. I indicated this to Mr.
Charles at around 12:40AM on May 7, 2008 in an email.

Tvia had to file the motion to remand by May 9, 2008 to preserve its procedural objections (Charles Dec., ¶8).

Instead of moving to remand the case, Mr. Rafat filed a “Notice of Intent to Remand to State

2

Court and Request for Stay of All Federal Court Proceedings.” (Doc. No. 9). In this document, Mr.

3

Rafat failed to advise the Court that Tvia objected to his inappropriate conditions regarding a

4

stipulated remand, yet he attached to the document a proposed order with the following language.
IT IS ORDERED that this case be remanded to Santa Clara County Superior Court,
where DEFENDANTS will file a demurrer or an answer to the Complaint and that
no further action be taken by this Court. Each side is to bear his/her/its attorneys’

This effort to obtain an ex parte order adjudicating Tvia’s statutory right to seek costs and attorney’s

9

fees is simply unconscionable. Mr. Rafat’s bad faith conduct continued. Instead of re-noticing the

10

Motion to Dismiss pursuant to LR 7-7, he left it on the docket forcing Tvia to file an administrative

11

motion as its opposition to the Motion to Dismiss was due in less than two weeks (Charles Dec., ¶8).

12

In this context, Mr. Rafat cannot claim ignorance of the Local Rules. Counsel for Tvia specifically

13

advised Mr. Rafat to re-notice the Motion to Dismiss to avoid the administrative motion.

12

14

G. Silva, Mckee, Wang, and Rafat should be sanctioned in the amount of $8,242.50.

15

The Defendants and Mr. Rafat are completely responsible for the circumstances in which

16

they find themselves. Since parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction upon this Court, Tvia

17

properly noted the jurisdictional issue (Charles Dec., ¶6). Although the Defendants and Mr. Rafat

18

could have resolved this matter on May 2, 2008 without resort to expensive motion practice, they

19

imposed impermissible and frivolous conditions upon a stipulation for order of remand. Since the

20

NOR is based upon blatant misrepresentation of fact and has no basis in law, the Defendants and

21

Mr. Rafat have no excuse for their conduct. Moreover, as late as May 7, 2008, the Defendants and

22

Mr. Rafat still maintain that voluntary remand is subject to their frivolous conditions (Doc 18, ¶¶ 5-

23

6). Given these considerations Tvia has incurred the following attorney’s fees.
