M.B.D. No. 11 mc 91078-JLT

Government’s Opposition to Motion of Putative
Intervenors to File Reply Memorandum
The United States of America, by and through Assistant United States Attorney John T.
McNeil, respectfully submits this opposition to Motion of Intervenors to File Reply
Memorandum to Government’s Opposition to Motion for Leave to Intervene [D.25].

Having

already filed 157 pages of pleadings and attachments with their initial motion [D.18], the putative
intervenors now seek to file an additional pleading of unspecified length. [D.25]. The grounds
for their request essentially are that there are “substantial issues at stake” and“matters of first
impression” at issue. [D.25 at 1-2]. The putative intervenors neither claim that the government’s
response raises any new issues, nor that there are any issues which now need to be briefed of
which they were not aware at the time they filed their initial brief. Allowing a reply
memorandum would simply delay resolution of this matter, permit duplicative and unnecessary
briefing in this case, and reward the putative intervenors for failing to state their complete case in
their initial pleading.
