MOTION FOR
LEAVE TO REPLY
L.RR. 112.1; 7.1(b)(3)

MOTION OF INTERVENORS TO FILE REPLY
MEMORANDUM TO GOVERNMENT’S OPPOSITION
TO MOTION FOR LEAVE TO INTERVENE
Ed Moloney and Anthony MacIntyre (collectively, the “Intervenors”), by
and through undersigned counsel, Eamonn Dornan of Dornan & Associates
PLLC, 10-40 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, New York 11101, appearing
pro hac vice, and James J. Cotter, III MA BBO 101620, Attorney at Law, Post
Office Box 270, N. Quincy, MA 02171, pursuant to L.R. 112.1 and L.R.
7.1(b)(3),

hereby move the Honorable Court for leave to file a Reply

Memorandum in response to the Government’s Opposition to Motion for Leave
to Intervene, and in support of this motion state as follows:
1.

The Intervenors respectfully request leave to file a Reply

Memorandum in light of the substantial issues at stake in this matter, in addition
to the fact that their Motion for Leave to Intervene raises matters of first

1

Case 1:11-mc-91078-WGY Document 25 Filed 09/28/11 Page 2 of 6

impression, and involves rules of statutory construction and international treaty
law.
2.

The Intervenors filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene on August

31, 2011, along with their proposed Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Writ
of Mandamus and Injunctive Relief (“Complaint”).
3.

In moving to file the Complaint, the Intervenors seek, inter alia,

the Honorable Court’s determination and declaration regarding the failure of the
Government’s nondiscretionary duties under the US-UK Mutual Legal
Assistance Treaty (“US-UK MLAT”) upon which the Government relies in its
subpoenas issued on behalf of the United Kingdom.
4.

The Government filed its Opposition to Motion for Leave to

Intervene on September 21, 2011. In essence, the Government posits that the
Intervenors are barred from asserting any private right of action pursuant to
Article 1, § 3 of the US-UK MLAT, which states that the Treaty “is intended
solely for mutual legal assistance between the Parties. . . [and] shall not give
rise to a right on the part of any private person to obtain, suppress, or exclude
any evidence, or to impede the execution of a request.”
5.

The Government further seeks to dismiss the Intervenors’ claims

for relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Declaratory Judgment
Act, and the mandamus statute fail under the same analysis, namely, that “no
law that supports a claim for relief against the Attorney General.”

2

6.

However, neither the Intervenors nor indeed the Government rely

solely on the terms of the US-UK MLAT. The subpoenas could not be issued to
Boston College without the Government’s petition under 18 U.S.C. §3512,
which in turn raises the question of the Government’s compliance with F.R.
Crim.P. 17(c)(2).
7.

Moreover, the Intervenors have raised claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

§1361, and 28 U.S.C. §1331, praying for a writ in the nature of mandamus to
compel the Attorney General, and those acting under him, to perform the
nondiscretionary duties he owes to the United States, to the Intervenors and to
Boston College under the US-UK MLAT, in conjunction with both 18 U.S.C.
§3512 and F.R. Crim.P. 17(c)(2).
8.

The Intervenors also seek judicial review in the form of a

declaratory judgment that the subpoenas issued by the Commissioner under 18
U.S.C. §3512, on behalf of the Attorney General, are arbitrary, capricious or an
abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law and contrary to F.
R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2).
9.

In their Motion for Leave to Intervene, the Intervenors seek to raise

substantial questions with regard to their constitutional rights under the First
and Fifth Amendments; the rights or obligations of both the U.S. and the U.K.
under another bilateral agreement relating to the subject matter of the
subpoenas; whether the request for assistance (a) would impair the essential
interests of the United States (b) would be contrary to important public policy
3

Case 1:11-mc-91078-WGY Document 25 Filed 09/28/11 Page 4 of 6

considerations of the United States; and, (c) is directed to an offense of a
political character; whether the Government’s actions were arbitrary, capricious
or an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; and whether
the request for assistance is unreasonable or oppressive contrary to F.R. Crim.
P. 17(c)(2).
10.

In their Motion for Leave to Intervene, the Intervenors raise

matters of first impression with the Honorable Court. The statute at 18 U.S.C.
§3512 (the Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act of 2009) is very recent,
having come into effect on October 19, 2009, and there is as yet no case law on
the application of the statute, or its relationship to the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, and in particular to F. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2). A reply memorandum
would, it is submitted, be of assistance to the Court in determining the issues.
11.

The Motion for Leave to Intervene further raises rules of statutory

construction and interpretation of international treaty law regarding the
Intervenors’ claims to a private right of action.
12.

As the subpoenas seek information regarding purported crimes

committed almost 40 years ago, there will be no prejudicial delay to the
Government in granting the Intervenors’ request.
13.

Accordingly, upon good cause shown, it is respectfully requested

that the Intervenors be permitted to file a Reply Memorandum.

14.

Counsel for the Government, Mr. John T. McNeil, has been

contacted to ascertain if the government has any opposition to this motion, and
Mr. McNeil confirms that the Government opposes the instant motion.
15.

This motion is not being filed for the purposes of causing delay,

but rather to allow the Intervenor fully to enunciate their legal remedies.

WHEREFORE, the Intervenors respectfully request that the Court grant them
leave to file a Reply Memorandum to Government’s Opposition to Motion for
Leave to Intervene.
