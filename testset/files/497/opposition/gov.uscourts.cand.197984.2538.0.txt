INTRODUCTION

White & Case LLP

701 Thirteenth Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005

1
2

By its motion for leave, Sharp seeks to undo the Court’s Order of March 13, 2014,

3

which was the product of full briefing by the parties and thoughtful consideration by the

4

Court. Sharp somehow believes that the Court erred in dismissing its case against the

5

Toshiba Defendants due to the existence of Sharp’s joint-and-several claims. Although

6

there have been several rounds of briefing concerning the Toshiba Defendants’ motion to

7

dismiss, Sharp never argued (until now) that its joint-and-several claims should remain in

8

the case. Whether Sharp has failed to previously raise this argument out of carelessness or

9

because of a strategic decision, the result is the same. Sharp’s motion should be denied.

10

Sharp’s motion for leave to amend is merely a motion for reconsideration in thin

11

disguise — and Sharp itself admits as much (Sharp Br. at 11 n.6). — but Sharp

12

inexplicably does not even acknowledge the existence of Local Rule 7-9, addressing

13

motions for reconsideration.

14

dismissed its case in its entirety because the forum-selection clause of the Basic

15

Transaction Agreement (“BTA”) only applies to claims based on sales between the Toshiba

16

Defendants and Sharp, not to Sharp’s joint-and-several claims against the Toshiba

17

Defendants. By our motion, however, we sought dismissal of Sharp’s First Amended

18

Complaint (“FAC”) in its entirety as against the Toshiba Defendants, not merely a part of

19

it. In responding to our motion to dismiss, it was incumbent upon Sharp to present all of its

20

arguments to the Court as to why the requested dismissal was inappropriate. Sharp never

21

argued in its response that dismissal of the FAC would be inappropriate because the BTA

22

did not apply to its joint-and-several claims involving the Toshiba Defendants. In relevant

23

part, Local Rule 7-9(b) allows for reconsideration where there has been “[a] manifest

24

failure by the Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments which were

25

presented to the Court before [the challenged] interlocutory order.” This standard cannot

26

be met where the relevant arguments were never presented to the Court. See Travelers

27

Property Casualty Co. of America, No. 11-3638-SC, 2012 WL 2135315, at *1 (N.D. Cal.

28

June 12, 2012) (Conti, J.) (“As Travelers’ forfeiture theory was never mentioned before,

By its motion, Sharp argues that the Court improperly

the Court could not have wrongfully failed to consider it in deciding Centex’s motion for

2

partial summary judgment.”).

3

argument to the Court in opposing our motion to dismiss, it has waived that argument.

Because Sharp never presented its joint-and-several

4

Even if the Court were to consider the merits of Sharp’s motion for leave — and it

5

should not — it should still deny the motion because any amendment of Sharp’s FAC

6

would be futile.

7

As this Court has already recognized in its March 13 Order, the doctrine of forum non

8

conveniens is the appropriate mechanism for enforcing forum-selection clauses. Order at 3

9

(citing Atlantic Marine Const. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the W. Dist. Of Texas, 134

10

S.Ct. 568, 580 (2013)). As discussed herein, the BTA, with its forum-selection clause

11

referring generally to “disputes,” “doubts,” and “unsolved items,” plainly reflects a mutual

12

intention of the two Japan-based corporate families to resolve all the issues between them

13

in Japan, whether based on direct sales or otherwise. The plain intention of these Japanese

14

parties to commit all such issues between them to the courts in Japan is presumably why

15

Sharp did not even attempt to argue (until now) that some but not all of its claims were

16

covered by the BTA. Furthermore, Sharp’s original Complaint and FAC indisputably

17

contained claims based on direct sales. Sharp’s attempt now to artfully plead away claims

18

based on direct sales cannot change the fact that this “litigation” relates to the BTA and is

19

therefore subject to its choice of forum clause.

20

In any event, the doctrine of forum non conveniens is committed to the sound

21

discretion of a district court and applies in a variety of circumstances. Sometimes the

22

doctrine applies to give meaning to a forum-selection clause, such as the one contained in

23

the BTA. The doctrine, however, is sufficiently flexible to warrant dismissal even if a

24

forum-selection clause does not control, applying the conventional considerations and

25

private and public interest factors. These criteria mandate dismissal of Sharp’s joint-and-

26

several claims against the Toshiba Defendants, even if the Court were to conclude that

27

those claims are not covered by the forum-selection clause of the BTA. In this case, the

28

Court has already ruled upon the adequacy of the Osaka District Court, which would

possess jurisdiction to entertain the antitrust dispute between Sharp and the Toshiba

2

Defendants.

3

examine a variety of factors. They will consider whether the plaintiff is suing in its home

4

forum or in a foreign forum. They will consider the location of the witnesses. They will

5

consider the court’s own congestion. And they will consider whether dismissal of related

6

claims will allow a plaintiff’s entire claim to be resolved in one forum. All of these factors

7

favor dismissal of Sharp’s joint-and-several claims involving Toshiba. Given Sharp’s

8

previous concessions concerning the close relationship between the two Sharp Plaintiffs

9

and Sharp Corporation in Japan, it is apparent that this district is a foreign forum with

10

respect to Sharp, not its home forum. Most of the witnesses for the Toshiba Defendants

11

reside in Japan. Dismissal of Sharp’s joint-and-several claims will lessen the congestion of

12

this Court. Finally, dismissal of Sharp’s joint-and-several claims will further efficiency

13

because the Osaka District Court is the only court that can entertain both the joint-and-

14

several claims as well as the claims arising from Sharp’s purchases directly from the

15

Toshiba Defendants.

In assessing the private interest and public interest criteria, courts will

16

All told, Sharp has no basis for seeking reconsideration under Local Rule 7-9 and, in

17

any event, this Court’s March 13 Order was well within this Court’s sound discretion under

18

the forum non conveniens doctrine.

19

BACKGROUND

20

On October 13, 2013, the Toshiba Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Sharp’s

21

original Complaint. Toshiba Attachment (“Toshiba Att.”) 1. The parties later stipulated

22

that this motion to dismiss would also apply to the FAC. By this motion, the Toshiba

23

Defendants stated that they “will and hereby do move the Court for an order dismissing the

24

Complaint of Sharp Electronics Corporation and Sharp Electronics Manufacturing

25

Company of America, Inc. (collectively, the ‘Plaintiffs’ or ‘Sharp’) (‘Complaint’) as

26

against the Toshiba Defendants pursuant to Rules 12(b)(3) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal

27

Rules of Civil Procedure.” Id. at 1. This language unmistakably signified that the Toshiba

28

Defendants were seeking dismissal of Sharp’s entire action, without limitation. In support

Case3:07-cv-05944-SC Document2538 Filed04/16/14 Page8 of 24

1

of this motion, the Toshiba Defendants relied upon the forum-selection clause of the BTA,

2

a 1977 agreement between Sharp Corporation and Tokyo Shibaura Electric Corporation.

3

On November 6, 2013, Sharp filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss. Toshiba

4

Att. 2. In its opposition, Sharp explained that the motion to dismiss should be denied

5

because: (1) the Sharp Plaintiffs are not parties to, or bound by, the BTA; (2) the Sharp

6

Plaintiffs’ claims do not relate to the BTA; and (3) enforcing the forum-selection clause of

7

the BTA would violate public policy. Sharp did not argue, as it does now, that even if the

8

forum-selection clause of the BTA applied to commerce between Sharp and the Toshiba

9

Defendants, that clause would not apply to Sharp’s joint-and-several claims against the

10

White & Case LLP

701 Thirteenth Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005

11
12

Toshiba Defendants.
On November 20, 2013, the Toshiba Defendants filed their reply memorandum in
support of their motion to dismiss. Toshiba Att. 3.

13

On December 9, 2013, the Toshiba Defendants filed a motion for leave to amend

14

their motion to dismiss Sharp’s Complaint. Toshiba Att. 4. By this motion, the Toshiba

15

Defendants sought to amend the procedural grounds underlying their motion to dismiss in

16

light of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Atlantic Marine Const. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dist.

17

Ct. for the W. Dist. Of Texas, 134 S.Ct. 568 (2013), which observed that the proper

18

procedural grounds to enforce a forum-selection clause is by use of the doctrine of forum

19

non conveniens. The Toshiba Defendants included a proposed amended motion to dismiss

20

which, in relevant part, stated that they “will and hereby do move the Court for an order

21

dismissing the Complaint of Sharp Electronics Corporation and Sharp Electronics

22

Manufacturing Company of America, Inc. (collectively, the ‘Plaintiffs’ or ‘Sharp’)

23

(‘Complaint’) as against the Toshiba Defendants pursuant to the doctrine of forum non

24

conveniens and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” Toshiba Att. 4 at

25

Ex. A. Again, the Toshiba Defendants expressly sought dismissal of Sharp’s Complaint

26

without qualification.

27

On December 17, 2013, the Court granted the Toshiba Defendants’ motion for leave

28

to amend their motion to dismiss. Toshiba Att. 5. By this order, the Court stated that the

1

Sharp Plaintiffs could respond to the amendment within seven days, if they felt it

2

necessary.

3

On December 24, 2013, Sharp responded to the amended motion to dismiss. Toshiba

4

Att. 6. In its response, Sharp stated that “[f]orum non conveniens ‘is a drastic exercise of

5

the court’s inherent power because, unlike a mere transfer of venue, it results in the

6

dismissal of a plaintiff’s case.’” Id. at 4 (citation omitted). Once again, Sharp made no

7

arguments concerning its joint-and-several claims with respect to the Toshiba Defendants.

8

Sharp did not argue that, even if the forum-selection clause of the BTA applied to

9

commerce between Sharp and the Toshiba Defendants due to the doctrine of forum non

10

conveniens, that clause would not apply to Sharp’s joint-and-several claims against the

11

Toshiba Defendants.

12

On January 13, 2014, the Toshiba Defendants filed a supplemental reply in which

13

they confirmed that “this Court should find that the forum-selection clause requires the

14

Sharp Plaintiffs to pursue any claims in the Osaka District Court.” Toshiba Att. 7 at 3

15

(emphasis added). Sharp responded to this brief on January 24, 2014. Toshiba Att. 8.

16

On March 13, 2014, the Court issued an Order Granting Toshiba’s Motion To

17

Dismiss Sharp’s First Amended Complaint. Toshiba Att. 9. In this Order, the Court

18

recognized that the Toshiba Defendants sought to dismiss Sharp’s FAC in its entirety. See

19

id. at 3 (“Toshiba now moves to dismiss this action, arguing that the BTA’s forum-

20

selection clause requires this action to be litigated in Japan.”). The Court then considered

21

and resolved all of the material arguments raised by Sharp in its response to our motion to

22

dismiss (i.e., that the two Sharp Plaintiffs are not parties to the BTA, that the Sharp

23

Plaintiffs’ claims do not relate to the BTA, and that enforcing the BTA’s forum-selection

24

clause would violate public policy).

25

unpersuasive, the Court granted the motion to dismiss: “The complaint is DISMISSED

26

WITH PREJUDICE.” Id. at 10.

Id. at 5-10.

Finding Sharp’s arguments to be

27

On April 2, 2014 — nearly three weeks later — Sharp filed its present motion for

28

leave to file an amended complaint. Sharp’s Motion for Leave to Amend, In re: CRT

1

Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 07-5944 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2014), ECF No. 2520 (“Sharp Br.”).

2

In this motion, Sharp explained that it seeks to file an amended complaint “to eliminate all

3

damages claims against any defendant based on sales made by any Toshiba entity to any

4

Sharp entity, and clarify that Sharp has a remaining claim against Toshiba based upon

5

Toshiba’s joint and several liability as a co-conspirator for sales made to Sharp by other

6

conspirators.” Id. at 1. If granted, this motion would render all prior briefing and the

7

Order concerning the motion to dismiss an effective nullity, given Sharp’s assertion that the

8

overwhelming majority of its clams would be revived.

12

ARGUMENT
The Court Should Deny Sharp’s Motion For Leave To Amend Its Complaint
Because That Motion Merely Seeks Reconsideration Of The Court’s Dismissal
Order And The Standards For Reconsideration Are Not Met
Sharp understands that the relief it seeks is in the nature of reconsideration — it

13

blithely acknowledges that the Court could “consider this to be a motion for

14

reconsideration of the portion of its ruling that granted the dismissal against Toshiba with

15

prejudice, as opposed to without prejudice” (Sharp Br. at 11 n.6), but believes that any such

16

motion for reconsideration would only be governed by Rule 59 or Rule 60 of the Federal

17

Rules of Civil Procedure, which pertain to final orders or judgments. Id. at 6. Because of

18

this perceived lack of authority, Sharp states that it has fashioned its motion as one seeking

19

leave to amend its Complaint. Sharp reaches this conclusion because it has failed to

20

consult the Local Rules of this Court.

10

White & Case LLP

11

I.

21

Local Rule 7-9, entitled “Motion for Reconsideration,” contains a subpart (a) that

22

provides that, “[b]efore the entry of a judgment adjudicating all of the claims and the rights

23

and liabilities of all the parties in a case, any party may make a motion before a Judge

24

requesting that the Judge grant the party leave to file a motion for reconsideration of any

25

interlocutory order on any ground set forth in Civil L.R. 7-9(b).” In turn, subpart (b) of

26

Local Rule 7-9 provides that the moving party must show reasonable diligence in bringing

27

the motion as well as one of the following: “(1) That at the time of the motion for leave, a

28

material difference in fact or law exists from that which was presented to the Court before

1

entry of the interlocutory order for which reconsideration is sought. The party also must

2

show that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the party applying for reconsideration did

3

not know such fact or law at the time of the interlocutory order; or (2) The emergence of

4

new material facts or a change of law occurring after the time of such order; or (3) A

5

manifest failure by the Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments

6

which were presented to the Court before such interlocutory order.”

7

The Local Rules of the Court thus provide a means by which parties may seek

8

reconsideration of interlocutory orders, such as the March 13, 2014 order dismissing

9

7

F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir. 1999)).

8

Sharp concedes that its original Complaint and its FAC both asserted joint-and-

9

several claims against Toshiba. See Sharp Br. at 3 (citing to Sharp’s Complaint and FAC

10

and stating that Sharp “sought damages from each defendant based on joint and several

11

liability for all sales to the Sharp Plaintiffs by defendants and their co-defendants”). Thus,

12

when faced with our motion to dismiss and amended motion to dismiss — both of which

13

sought, without qualification, “an order dismissing the Complaint of Sharp Electronics

14

Corporation and Sharp Electronics Manufacturing Company of America, Inc. (collectively,

15

the ‘Plaintiffs’ or ‘Sharp’) (‘Complaint’) as against the Toshiba Defendants” (Toshiba Att.

16

17

now. That is, Sharp could have argued that the forum-selection clause of the BTA does not

18

cover its joint-and-several claims or that forum non conveniens should not otherwise apply

19

to those claims. Because Sharp failed to raise these arguments in responding to our motion

20

to dismiss, those arguments have been waived. See Valley Forge Ins. Co. v. Zurich Am.

13

however, does not permit parties to simply present new arguments to the Court. There

change in law, or a “manifest failure” of the Court to consider material facts or dispositive

Sharp’s position, we did not argue that Sharp’s claims should be dismissed “insofar” as

they were based on purchases governed by the BTA. Id. That is a mischaracterization.

Our motion to dismiss sought dismissal of the FAC as it pertained to the Toshiba

10

Similarly unpersuasive is Sharp’s argument that neither party argued to the Court that

11

any dismissal should be with prejudice. Sharp Br. at 9. When the Toshiba Defendants

12

filed their motion for leave to file an amended motion to dismiss (Toshiba Att. 4), they

13

explained that they sought to proceed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens due to

14

the Supreme Court’s decision in Atlantic Marine Const. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the

15

W. Dist. Of Texas, 134 S.Ct. 568 (2013).

16

conveniens, the Atlantic Marine Court recognized the “harsh result” of that doctrine:

17

“Unlike a § 1404(a) motion, a successful motion under forum non conveniens requires

18

dismissal of the case.” Id. at 583 n.8. Sharp understood the significance of Atlantic

19

Marine: in responding to our motion for leave to amend, Sharp stated that “[f]orum non

20

conveniens ‘is a drastic exercise of the court’s inherent power because, unlike a mere

21

transfer of venue, it results in the dismissal of a plaintiff’s case.’” Toshiba Att. 6 at 4

22

(citation omitted). Sharp should have known that any dismissal for forum non conveniens

23

would be with prejudice. See Raima, Inc. v. Myriad France, SAS, C12-1166JLR, 2012 WL

The Court Should Deny Sharp’s Motion For Leave To Amend Its Complaint
Because Any Amendment Of Sharp’s Complaint Would Be Futile

5

Even if the Court were to consider the merits of Sharp’s procedurally improper

6

motion to amend, it would still deny that motion because the standards for amendment are

7

not met. As stated by Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962), “[i]f the underlying facts

8

or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be

9

afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.” The Court considers several

10

factors in determining whether to grant leave to amend, “such as undue delay, bad faith or

11

dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by

12

amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of

13

allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. . . .” Id.

14
15

II.

A.

Sharp’s Proposed Amendment Would Not Add Any New Facts Or
Circumstances

16

As an initial matter, Sharp’s proposed amendment will not add any “facts or

17

circumstances” that might allow Sharp to test its claims on the merits. Rather, the purpose

18

of Sharp’s proposed amendment is “to eliminate all damages claims against any defendant

19

based on sales made by any Toshiba entity to any Sharp entity, and clarify that Sharp has a

20

remaining claim against Toshiba based upon Toshiba’s joint and several liability as a co-

21

conspirator for sales made to Sharp by other competitors.” Sharp Br. at 1. The first part of

22

the proposed amendment is simply an acknowledgement that the Court ruled against Sharp

23

with respect to the forum-selection clause of the BTA. The second part of the proposed

24

amendment is redundant because the existing FAC already asserts a claim against the

25

Toshiba Defendants for joint-and-several liability, a fact that Sharp admits. Sharp Br. at 3.

26

Far from adding new “facts or circumstances,” Sharp merely deletes facts and reorganizes

27

its claims. Consequently, there is no reason to permit any amendment whatsoever.

B.

Sharp’s Proposed Amendment Is Futile Because The Forum-Selection
Clause Of The BTA Covers Sharp’s Joint-And-Several Claims

Putting this threshold issue aside, the Court should still deny Sharp’s proposed

4

amendment because that amendment is futile.

Even if the Court were to allow the

5

amendment, it would still dismiss Sharp’s FAC under forum non conveniens.

6

“Dismissal for forum non conveniens reflects a court’s assessment of a ‘range of

7

considerations, most notably the convenience to the parties and the practical difficulties

8

that can attend the adjudication of a dispute in a certain locality.” Sincochem Int’l Co. Ltd.

9

v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 429 (2007) (citation omitted). “A party

10

moving to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens must show two things: (1) the

11

existence of an adequate alternative forum, and (2) that the balance of private and public

12

interest factors favors dismissal.” Lockman Foundation v. Evangelical Alliance Mission,

13

930 F.2d 764, 767 (9th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).

14

determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Piper Aircraft Co. v.

15

Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 257 (1981). “It may only be reversed when there has been a clear

16

abuse of discretion; where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest

17

factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves

18

substantial deference.” Id. (citations omitted). The Supreme Court’s recent decision in

19

Atlantic Marine Const. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the W. Dist. Of Texas, 134 S.Ct. 568,

20

582 (2013), held that a forum-selection clause specifying a foreign tribunal should be

21

addressed under the rubric of forum non conveniens, and that if the clause applies it trumps

22

other private-interest factors.

“The forum non conveniens

23

In its motion, Sharp merely assumes that its joint-and-several claims are not governed

24

by the forum-selection clause of the BTA. Sharp Br. at 2. This assumption ignores the fact

25

that the BTA reflects the intent of two Japanese companies to resolve their business

26

disputes in Japan. That intent is discerned by reference to the language actually used by

27

the parties. See DOE 1 v. AOL LLC, 552 F.3d 1077, 1081 (9th Cir. 2009) (interpreting a

28

1

the terms of a contract are clear, the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the

2

contract itself.”).

3

Article 21 of the BTA, entitled “Resolution of Doubt or Disputes,” contains the

4

forum-selection clause at issue in this case. Article 21.1 of the BTA provides that, “[w]hen

5

there are disputes or doubts that arise in relation to this Agreement or individual

6

Agreement, or when there are unsolved items in this Agreement or individual Agreement,

7

resolutions shall be made between Party A and Party B in good faith.” Article 21.2 of the

8

BTA provides that, “[i]n terms of litigation related to this Agreement or the individual

9

Agreement, the Osaka District Court shall be the court of competent jurisdiction.” In

10

determining the scope of the forum-selection clause, the Court should read the BTA

11

holistically and, in particular, read the two subparts of Article 21 together.

12

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 202 (1981) (“A writing is interpreted as a whole, and

13

all writings that are part of the same transaction are interpreted together.”).

See

14

Article 21 reveals the signatories’ understanding that there might be different types of

15

disagreements that arise in relation to the BTA (or individual agreements under the BTA).

16

One type of disagreement would be a “dispute” — for example, a dispute about the

17

meaning of the BTA or one party’s performance under an individual agreement. Per

18

Article 21.1, the parties agreed that they would resolve such disputes in good faith. Per

19

Article 21.2, any resulting litigation would occur in the Osaka District Court. Another type

20

of disagreement would be a “doubt” or an “unsolved item.” By use of these terms, the

21

parties understood that there might arise questions about the breadth or scope of the BTA

22

or an individual agreement. Per Article 21.1, the parties agreed that they would resolve

23

such doubts or unsolved items in good faith. Per Article 22.2, any resulting litigation

24

would occur in the Osaka District Court.

25

Sharp’s claim of joint-and-several liability involving the Toshiba Defendants raises a

26

“dispute” in relation to the BTA. By Article 1.1 of the BTA, entitled “Basic terms and

27

conditions,” the parties agreed to “set their foundation on mutual trust and respect for

28

mutual benefits.” By its Complaint and FAC, Sharp alleges that the Toshiba Defendants

1

entered into a price-fixing conspiracy with other co-conspirators, thereby incurring joint-

2

and-several liability. If this allegation is true, then the Toshiba Defendants have violated

3

their commitment to Sharp to show “respect for mutual benefits” as between Sharp and

4

Toshiba. That dispute must be resolved by the Osaka District Court.

5

If there is “doubt” as to whether joint-and-several claims are covered by the BTA,

6

then such doubt must be resolved in the first instance by the Osaka District Court. Cf.

7

Moses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983) (“any

8

doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,”

9

including where “the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself.”).

10

Alternatively, it may be the case that, in executing the BTA, the parties did not anticipate

11

the possibility of there being a question of joint-and-several liability that might arise in the

12

future. Such an unforeseen issue is an “unsolved item,” as that term is used in the BTA.

13

“Unsolved items” must also be resolved in the first instance by the Osaka District Court.

14

It is a well-accepted tenet of contract law that all terms of a contract should be given

15

meaning. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 203 (1981) (“[A]n interpretation which

16

gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an

17

interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect.”). Applying this

18

principle, the Court should give meaning to the parties’ use of the words “dispute,”

19

“doubt,” and “unsolved item.”

20

construction, it is apparent that Sharp and Toshiba intended to send any and all of their

21

disagreements, whether known or unknown at the time of the BTA’s signing, to the Osaka

22

District Court for resolution.

When all of these terms are given a reasonable

23

There is a separate reason why Sharp’s joint-and-several claims are subject to the

24

forum-selection clause of the BTA. The forum-selection clause of the BTA addresses

25

“litigation” related to the BTA or individual agreements that arise under the BTA. When

26

Sharp filed its original Complaint, it made a decision to commence litigation involving

27

both its purchases from the Toshiba Defendants as well as joint-and-several claims

28

involving the Toshiba Defendants. Together, these two categories of claims made up the

14

1

“litigation.” Even if Sharp’s joint-and-several claims are not directly covered by the BTA,

2

they are covered because they form part of the litigation commenced by Sharp, litigation

3

that relates to individual agreements under the BTA. Again, the BTA plainly reflects the

4

intention of the two Japanese corporate groups to resolve issues between them in Japan.

the forum-selection clause of the BTA.
1.

The Osaka District Court Is An Adequate Alternative Forum

12

In its Order Granting Toshiba’s Motion To Dismiss Sharp’s First Amended

13

Complaint, the Court considered and rejected Sharp’s arguments concerning the

14

jurisdiction of the Osaka District Court and the remedies provided by that Court. Toshiba

15

Att. 9 at 8-10. The factors considered by the Court all support the conclusion that the

16

Osaka District Court is an adequate alternative forum for resolution of Sharp’s joint-and-

17

several claims against the Toshiba Defendants.

18
19

The Private Interest Factors Favor Dismissal Of Sharp’s Joint-AndSeveral Claims

20

One private interest factor considered by the courts is whether the plaintiff is suing in

21

its home forum or in a foreign forum. A plaintiff’s choice of forum “is entitled to greater

22

deference when the plaintiff has chosen the home forum” because “it is reasonable to

23

assume that this choice is convenient.” Piper Aircraft, 454 U.S. at 255-56. “When the

24

plaintiff is foreign, however, this assumption is much less reasonable.” Id. at 256. Stated

25

differently, “[b]ecause the central purpose of any forum non conveniens inquiry is to ensure

26

that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiff’s choice deserves less deference.” Id. In this

27

case, Plaintiff SEMA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharp Electronics (FAC ¶ 24) and

28

Plaintiff Sharp Electronics is a wholly owned subsidiary of Osaka-based Sharp Corporation

(FAC ¶ 22). The Court has already recognized the very close relationship between the

2

Sharp Plaintiffs and Sharp Corporation, both in terms of their corporate structure as well as

3

their internal transactions. Toshiba Att. 9 at 2, 8. In commencing this lawsuit in the

4

Northern District of California, Sharp has selected a foreign forum. Sharp’s home forum is

5

Osaka, Japan. Thus, the Court should not defer to Sharp’s choice of forum.

6

Another private interest factor considered by the courts is the availability of witnesses

7

for trial. See Lockman, 930 F.2d at 770 (“All or nearly all of the witnesses relating to

8

TEAM’s claim of copyright are in Japan, several of whom are apparently elderly and

9

infirm and who would have a difficult time traveling to the United States.”). This factor

10

favors dismissal of Sharp’s joint-and-several claims because most of the witnesses for the

11

Toshiba Defendants are located in Japan.

12

Presumably, those witnesses are also located in Japan.

Sharp itself may have witnesses for trial.

13

Perhaps the most important private interest factor is the fact that the Osaka District

14

Court is now the only court with jurisdiction to entertain all of the disputes between Sharp

15

and the Toshiba Defendants. Numerous courts have recognized that it is more convenient

16

to the parties for multi-issue disputes to be resolved in the same forum. See Lockman, 930

17

F.2d at 770 (“Given the district court’s dismissal of the copyright claims, Japan remains the

18

only forum in which the entire case may be tried.”); Contact Lumber Co. v. P.T. Moges

19

Shipping Co., Ltd., 918 F.2d 1446, 1452 (9th Cir. 1990) (“Only the Philippine court has

20

jurisdiction over all of the related cases. In contrast, if the district court were to retain

21

jurisdiction, Moges would be forced to defend in the United States while simultaneously

22

pressing and defending claims in the Philippines.”); Salton, Inc. v. Philips Domestic

23

Appliances and Personal Care B.V., 391 F.3d 871, 876 (7th Cir. 2004) (“There are obvious

24

advantages to consolidating this three-sided dispute involving Philips, Salton, and E & E in

25

one court, and at this point the only court in which that can be done appears to be the High

26

Court of Hong Kong.”). In Lockman, for example, the plaintiff originally asserted both

27

copyright and non-copyright claims in the Central District of California. The district court

convenient forum. On appeal, the plaintiff only challenged the dismissal of the non-

2

copyright claims. “Because Lockman does not challenge the dismissal of its copyright

3

claims, it must pursue them in Japan, if at all.” 930 F.2d at 770. The Ninth Circuit

4

concluded that this factor favored dismissal of the non-copyright claims per forum non

5

conveniens “because trying all claims in one case would prevent fragmented litigation.” Id.

6

The forum-selection clause of the BTA is broad enough to cover Sharp’s joint-and-

7

several claims involving the Toshiba Defendants. But even if these joint-and-several

8

claims are not covered by the forum-selection clause, it remains true that the Osaka District

9

Court is the only forum that can entertain all of Sharp’s claims against the Toshiba

10

Defendants. Sharp itself has conceded the importance of keeping claims together so as to

11

avoid fragmented litigation. See Toshiba Att. 6 at 2 (“‘[t]here is an advantage to resolving

12

all disputes arising out of a particular incident in a single forum[.]’”) (citation omitted).

13

This factor undoubtedly favors dismissing Sharp’s joint-and-several claims so that Sharp

14

can bring all of its claims against the Toshiba Defendants in the Osaka District Court.

15
16

The Public Interest Factors Favor Dismissal Of Sharp’s Joint-AndSeveral Claims

17

By dismissing Sharp’s joint-and-several claims, the Court would further the goals of

18

judicial efficiency and economy by ensuring that all of Sharp’s claims involving the

19

Toshiba Defendants would be resolved in one forum. See Contact Lumber, 918 F.2d at

20

1453 (“Given the common factual predicate that links the many lawsuits that have been

21

filed, efficiency and economy militate in favor of consolidating all claims in one trial.”).

22

Also relevant to this inquiry is the congestion of the Court. Lueck v. Sundstrand Corp., 236

23

F.3d 1137, 1147 (9th Cir. 2001). Dismissing Sharp’s joint-and-several claims will further

24

streamline this case and reduce the burden Sharp has imposed on the Court.

3.

Sharp’s Remaining Arguments Are Unpersuasive

25

D.

26

In its brief, Sharp makes several remaining arguments in support of its motion. None

27

of these arguments is persuasive.

1

Sharp asserts that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Crostley v. Lamar Cnty., Tex., 717

2

F.3d 410 (5th Cir. 2013), somehow supports its decision to file a motion for leave to amend

3

in response to the Court’s order to dismiss its case with prejudice. Sharp Br. at 6. We

4

disagree. The district court in Crostley had dismissed all section 1983 claims that were

5

filed against Lamar County, with prejudice, finding that the complaint had failed to

6

sufficiently allege the official policy or custom that inflicted their purported deprivation of

7

constitutional rights. 717 F.3d at 418. Subsequent to that dismissal order, the plaintiffs

8

took numerous depositions that, in the plaintiffs’ view, provided new information that

9

would support their section 1983 claims. Id. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for leave so

10

that they might amend their complaint with this new information. Id. The district court

11

denied this motion. Id. at 419. In Crostley, the Fifth Circuit held that the denial of the

12

motion for leave was an abuse of discretion because amending the complaint to again assert

13

a section 1983 claim against Lamar County was not futile. Id. at 421. In this manner,

14

Crostley is fundamentally different than Sharp. After the dismissal with prejudice, the

15

Crostley plaintiffs identified new information to support their section 1983 claim. Sharp,

16

in contrast, has not identified any new information. Rather, it merely seeks amendment so

17

that it can turn back the clock and make an argument now that it should have made in

18

response to our motion to dismiss.

19

Sharp argues that “justice requires” that it be allowed to pursue its joint-and-several

20

claims against Toshiba given the amount of damages that might arise from those claims.

21

Sharp Br. at 3. It would be a more just result, however, to require Sharp to adhere to the

22

terms of the 30-year contract it had with Toshiba, as well as the Local Rules of the Court.

23

In any event, it is not the case that Sharp will be left without a remedy if the Court’s March

24

13, 2014 Order is left undisturbed. The volume of commerce of the Toshiba Defendants

25

can remain in the case and Sharp can utilize that volume of commerce to seek damages

26

from the other defendants in the case.

27

In filing its motion for leave to amend its complaint, Sharp is much like the plaintiff

28

in Lockman. There, after the district court dismissed the case on forum non conveniens

grounds, “Lockman moved to amend its complaint, seeking to drop the copyright claims.”

2

930 F.2d at 771. This motion was denied by the district court. The Ninth Circuit saw no

3

error in the district court’s decision because “[t]he late request for leave to amend here

4

appears ‘to be nothing more than a desperate attempt at persuading the [district] court to

5

retain jurisdiction,’ such as the one we rejected in Contact Lumber, 918 F.2d at 1454.” Id.

6

at 772. The Court should reach the same conclusion here with respect to Sharp’s motion

7

for leave to amend.
CONCLUSION

10

For these reasons, the Court should deny Sharp’s motion for leave to amend its
complaint.
