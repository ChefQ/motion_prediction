DEFENDANT MICHAEL PEINOVICH’S MOTION TO RESTRAIN
ROBERTA KAPLAN, ESQ. AND KAPLAN AND COMPANY LLP FROM
FURTHER IMPROPER AND UNETHICAL EXTRAJUDICIAL STATEMENTS
AND FOR SANCTIONS; AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

Defendant Michael Peinovich, Pro Se, invoking this Court’s inherent authority to assure a
fair trial and to discipline attorneys who appear before it, as well as its authority under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 16(c)(P) to issue pretrial orders “facilitating… the just, speedy, and inexpensive
disposition of the action,” moves for a pretrial order restraining Roberta Kaplan, Esq., and
Kaplan and Company LLP, attorneys for the plaintiffs, from further extrajudicial statements that
prejudice Peinovich’s and the other defendants’ right to a fair trial and that violate ethical rules.
Peinovich also respectfully requests sanctions, including dismissal of the complaint. Peinovich
submits the following memorandum in support.
INTRODUCTION
As shown below, Roberta Kaplan, Esq., attorney for the plaintiffs, has been conducting
an aggressive campaign, based on Twitter and in major web and print media outlets, against
Peinovich and the other defendants, making extrajudicial statements that have reached

1
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 1 of 19 Pageid#: 1662

potentially millions of Internet and social media users. Through her tweets, speeches, interviews
and statements, Kaplan has outrageously linked defendants to suspected school shooter Nikolas
Cruz, abortion clinic bombers, the Holocaust and offensive statements by persons who are not
defendants in this case. Additionally, Ms Kaplan has been variously implying, or tacitly agreeing
with the implications raised by others in her public presence, that she has special access to and
influence with this Court.

Further, Ms. Kaplan has repeatedly issued extrajudicial, public,

widely-read and heard statements disparaging the defendants and characterizing plaintiffs’ claims
in a tendentious, non-neutral, pro-plaintiff light. In doing so, she has waived plaintiffs’ attorney
client privilege and made herself a fact witness in this case.
BACKGROUND
Ms. Kaplan is very active on many widely used and viewed social media platforms
including Twitter where she has a substantial following of approximately 500 users. Although
this may seem like a relatively small following, the nature of Twitter, and the basis of its
popularity and influence is the ability of its users to freely engage others on the platform, include
users they do not “follow,” and to rebroadcast (“retweet”) others’ content to their respective
audiences of followers. Thus the audience for Ms. Kaplan’s tweets is not 500 but actually a large
multiple of this. Such tweets and retweets are not geographically limited. Ms. Kaplan’s tweets
reach all across the country and the world, including into the potential jury pool for the Western
District of Virginia.
In violation of ethical rules and to the prejudice of Peinovich and the other defendants,
Ms. Kaplan and her law firm have chosen to tweet repeatedly about this case. Ms Kaplan has
also appeared on a video talking about – and tendentiously characterizing – the plaintiffs’ claims

2
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 2 of 19 Pageid#: 1663

in this case.

She has also given numerous interviews to large media outlets in which she

interpreted the facts and legal underpinning of the case in such a way as to prejudice the
defendants and, more outrageously, implied or permitted the implication that she possesses
special influence with this Court.
A. Ms. Kaplan’s Tweets. The following is a non-exhaustive sampling of Ms. Kaplan’s
tweets regarding this case. It is revealing that Ms. Kaplan, after she became aware
that Peinovich knew of the tweets, blocked Peinovich on twitter in an attempt to
conceal them and deleted or otherwise made unavailable many of these tweets.
1) Tweet linking defendants in this case to accused school shooter Nikolas Cruz:

3
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 3 of 19 Pageid#: 1664

This tweet emotively links Nikolas Cruz, the man suspected of murdering 17
children and whose name is indelibly at the forefront of current public consciousness and
opinion, to “the American Nazis who planned the violence in Charlottesville.” Indeed,
the link suggests Cruz was a member or supporter of the defendants in this case. But
Cruz is not a defendant in this case and even plaintiffs’ 112 page amended complaint
neither suggests nor provides a factual basis to support, any links between Cruz and any
defendant, and certainly not Peinovich, who condemns Cruz’s actions. Even if Cruz
actually did have “swastikas on his ammunition magazine,” as stated in her tweet, this
would not justify her in publicly linking Cruz to the defendants. As a matter of fact,
however, asserted links between Cruz and white nationalists have been shown to be
false. (See, e.g.: http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/19/media-run-withunconfirmed-report-tying-florida-school-shooter-nikolas-cruz-to-white-nationalistgroup.html) Ms. Kaplan, however, has never sought to correct the harm her vicious tweet
has inflicted on Peinovich and the other defendants. In any event, it would not be
possible at this point to unring that bell.

2) Tweets linking defendants to the “American Identitarian Party.”

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 4 of 19 Pageid#: 1665

5
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 5 of 19 Pageid#: 1666

Here, Ms. Kaplan tweets links to offensive posts by some unknown person or
entity that calls himself, herself, or itself the “American Identitarian Party.” (This
designation is obscured in the second image, which is from the same Twitter user.) Ms.
Kaplan comments: “This is what the Hamans of today are saying about people like me
who are fighting them in court re #Charlottesville. On this #Purim, help us fight back
against the rise in anti-Semitism. Donate to @Integrityfor USA today.”

The second

tweet contains a similar message, mentioning the Jewish holiday Purim, linking
defendants to “a rise in antisemitism”, calling defendants “nazis” and “white
supremacists” and appealing for funds to “fight back” against them. Ms. Kaplan thus
indicates that the defendants in this case — “them” who she is “fighting … in court in
#Charlottesvile” — made or approved this post. But the “American Identitarian Party”
is not a party in this case; Peinovich has never heard of it, and to his knowledge neither
have any of the other defendants. For all that appears, the poster could be an online troll,
acting like an immature juvenile on social media, an unfortunately common occurrence.
Or it could be a provocateur—someone sympathetic to or even actually allied with
Kaplan or the plaintiffs—who is seeking to injure the defendants.

In any event, it was

highly inappropriate, unethical, and damaging for Ms. Kaplan to broadcast such tweets.
3) Here, Ms. Kaplan broadcasts a tweet again accusing the defendants of being “modern
day Hamans” and linking them to a 93% rise in anti-semitic incidents in K-12 schools
and colleges:

6
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 6 of 19 Pageid#: 1667

4) The following tweet by Ms Kaplan is similar to the prior tweet discussed above. Here
again she characterizes the defendants as “modern day Hamans” who are responsible
for a rise in anti-semitic incidents:

!
5)

In this tweet Ms. Kaplan retweets alleged evidence against the defendants in this case
offered to the public by someone with the name or alias of Luke O’Brien, and comments
that “[t]he violence, injuries and deaths that occurred were no accident.”

7
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 7 of 19 Pageid#: 1668

6) In the following tweet Ms. Kaplan comments on an alleged statement by Matthew
Heimbach, one of the defendants in this case, that “Of course we look up to men like
Adolph Hitler.” Offensive though such an alleged statement may be, Mr. Heimbach had
a First Amendment right to say it, if he did say it. Ms.Kaplan’s comment suggests her
true motives in organizing and filing plaintiffs’ complaint: to use the Court as a vehicle
to harass, intimidate and bankrupt the defendants and prevent them from expressing
opinions Ms. Kaplan deems “unacceptable.”

7)

In the archived tweets collected on the following chain (which Ms. Kaplan has now
deleted or otherwise made unavailable other than through a web archive) Ms. Kaplan
explicitly characterizes the complaint as what amounts to a strategic lawsuit against
public participation (SLAPP). Herein she acknowledges that plaintiffs’ motives are to
restrain defendants’ exercise of their right to demonstrate, e.g., “We have sued 24 of the
people and entities who together planned and incited the violence. Our goal? To make
it clear that this can never happen again”; criticizes President Trump and the Department
of Justice for not fighting for justice; and exposes her thought processes in drafting the

8
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 8 of 19 Pageid#: 1669

complaint, i.e., she “conceived lawsuit against organizers of #Charlottesville rally from
20 year old case against website that supported conspiracy against doctors who
performed abortions,” thus waiving her attorney client privilege and becoming a fact
witness as to the plaintiffs’ motivations for bringing this lawsuit.

https://web.archive.org/web/20180213104639/https:/twitter.com/kaplanrobbie

B. Ms. Kaplan’s Speeches. In addition to regular tweeting and retweeting, Ms. Kaplan
has been giving speeches to large audiences discussing this case. In her speeches she
repeatedly characterizes plaintiffs’ lawsuit as a heroic attempt at justice by innocent
plaintiffs who have been badly injured by the intentional violence of hateful Nazis
and white supremacists. See, e.g.,
1) “Lesbians Who Tech” Speech:

9
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 9 of 19 Pageid#: 1670

In this speech Kaplan reveals her underlying contempt for the basic notion of and
right to free speech by implying that defendant Spencer, occasionally
accompanied by defendant Peinovich, is somehow engaging in violence and
rights violations simply by exercising his First Amendment right to speak on
college campuses. Spencer’s right and ability to do so has been vindicated several
times by federal district Courts through injunctions against various public
universities seeking to prevent Spencer’s speech and activity. These proceedings
have been widely publicized in the national and international media. Nonetheless,
Kaplan persists in portraying Spencer’s actions, and by extension Peinovich’s, as
an unrestrained, lawless campaign of intimidation, terrorism, and violence.
Kaplan appears uninterested in the judicially-recognized distinction between, on
the one hand, speech she happens to dislike and, on the other, unlawful violence
and aggression.
2) MAKERS Conference talk with Marissa Blair:
In the following speech from the feminist MAKERS conference, which Ms.
Kaplan promoted on Twitter and which was streamed and broadcast on several
Internet outlets including the website of The Huffington Post. Ms. Kaplan talked
about the present case and showcased one of the plaintiffs, Marissa Blair. This
was highly inappropriate on several levels. For one, it shows the dissimulation in
plaintiffs’ contentions that they are so vulnerable to attacks from defendants and
their supporters that some must use John and Jane Doe aliases. On the one hand,
when it suits plaintiffs’ purposes to poison the Court’s mind against the

10
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 10 of 19 Pageid#: 1671

defendants, they claim defendants are so dangerous that some plaintiffs’ identities
must be kept secret; on the other hand, when it serves plaintiffs’ purposes to
fundraise and invoke widespread sympathy for plaintiffs’ claims, other plaintiffs
openly appear together with Ms. Kaplan before large audiences. It is not at all
clear why, and plaintiffs do not seek to explain, why certain of them require this
protection while others do not. The reasoning cannot be that African-American
plaintiffs are more vulnerable to retaliation since Ms. Blair is African American.
Moreover, Ms. Blair talks at length, with Ms. Kaplan’s approval, about the
Charlottesville events, acknowledging that she and other counter-protestors
travelled to Charlottesville to confront the pro-monument protestors, a fact that is
critical for purposes of First Amendment analysis and at odds with the tenor of
the plaintiffs’ complaint. Ms. Blair presents the facts as she sees them favorably
to the plaintiffs, including characterizing the events as a “KKK rally“ and stating
“they didn’t come out there to just, you know, First Amendment, freedom of
speech, right to assemble, right to bear arms.

They were out there to incite

violence, to scare people.” It is inconsistent with the notion of a fair jury trial for
plaintiffs’ attorneys to be encouraging plaintiffs to broadcast their alleged
evidence around the nation, including in the Western District of Virginia, while
this litigation is pending.
It is notable also that, to achieve maximum publicity, the Editor in Chief
of The Huffington Post also participated in Ms. Kaplan’s event. Video of the
event was taken in front of a live audience at MAKERS, a well-attended feminist

11
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 11 of 19 Pageid#: 1672

conference which also featured such luminaries as former Presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton, and that was streamed live on the website of The Huffington Post
and posted to the MAKERS webpage. It is unclear how many times this video
was viewed by visitors to the respective websites, but it potentially reached an
audience of millions.
The video, including a written transcript, can be found at: https://
www.makers.com/videos/5a7b62b31e64220ff8bee6a5 (See transcript of talk
attached as Exhibit 1).

Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 12 of 19 Pageid#: 1673

C. Ms. Kaplan’s Interviews.
1) In an interview published in the web outlet newsy.com (which can be viewed at
https://www.newsy.com/stories/unite-the-right-rally-organizers-going-to-court/), Ms.
Kaplan expressed herself at length about the present case, carefully distinguishing her
central purpose in the filing the lawsuit.

“We want this case to act as a deterrent to others ... Anyone thinking about
doing that [engaging in defendants’ behavior] pauses and changes their
mind because they understand if they do, there's going to be a very large
lawsuit filed against them with potentially huge monetary damages
awarded…”

Kaplan thus expressly, specifically confirmed that the litigation she first conceived,
before then seeking and soliciting plaintiffs, is in fact a strategic lawsuit against
public participation, directed not towards the factual reality and legal merits but
instead as a deterrent against perceived political opponents regardless of the ultimate
legality of their activity.
In the article’s final sentence the author indicates that “[t]he judge plans to meet
with Kaplan and make a decision on the motion to dismiss the lawsuit sometime in

13
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 13 of 19 Pageid#: 1674

mid-March.” This language implies that Ms. Kaplan enjoys special authority and
access to this Court, such that the Court intends to meet individually with Kaplan
herself regarding the defendants’ motions to dismiss. While it is possible that this
language is a product of inartful phrasing by the author, its appearance (and Kaplan’s
apparent failure to correct it, while still aggressively promoting the article on social
media) gives rise to the possible inference that Kaplan believes and perhaps directly
boasts of her special influence with the Court. Regardless, Kaplan, through her
sustained solicitation of media attention, has subjected herself to the peril that her
statements may not always be reported with perfect accuracy, with consequential
results. The simpler and more likely explanation is that Kaplan made the statements
to the author as he reported them.
2) In a February 12, 2018 article in the New York Times (which can be viewed at
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/us/charlottesville-lawsuit-far-right-heatherheyer.html), Ms. Kaplan’s statements given during an interview are summarized as
follows:
“Though all of the plaintiffs live in Virginia, the suit was conceived and filed by a
New York lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan …
After the Charlottesville rally exploded into chaos, Ms. Kaplan started thinking of
a lawsuit modeled on the one brought 20 years ago against the Nuremberg Files, a
website where anti-abortion activists posted the names and addresses of doctors
who performed abortions. That suit used civil conspiracy law to prove that the
website had led to the murder of doctors, and resulted in a judgment of more than
$100 million. Though the damages were eventually reduced, the site was taken
down.
‘I thought you could bring a suit under that same strategy,’ Ms. Kaplan said,
‘against the groups in Charlottesville.’”

14
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 14 of 19 Pageid#: 1675

.
Ms. Kaplan thus not only disclosed the legal theory of her complaint, thus to that
extent waiving attorney-client privilege, but likened the defendants in this case to
anti-abortion extremists who murdered doctors, in a newspaper that reaches millions
of readers across the country.
3) In a March 8, 2018 article appearing on the website vox.com (and that can be
viewed at https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17071832/alt-right-racists-charlottesville),
Ms. Kaplan is quoted as follows:
“As someone growing up as a Jewish kid in Cleveland, Ohio in the ‘70s and ‘80s,
my entire religious education was imbued with imagery of facts about the
Holocaust. That was something I very much grew up with and had a huge impact
on me as a kid,” she told me. “I think if you had told me back then that something
like [Charlottesville] would ever happen on the streets of an American city, I
would have told you you were nuts. And when it happened, I think I, like many,
many people, was kind of in a state of shock.”
Kaplan said that the idea behind the suit against the Unite the Right organizers
came from a 1990s lawsuit against the creator of the “Nuremberg Files” website,
which listed the names and personal information (including home addresses) of
abortion providers, complete with a legend: “Black font (working); Greyed-out
Name (wounded); Strikethrough (fatality).” In Planned Parenthood v. American
Coalition of Life Activists, a US district court eventually ruled that such websites
that clearly encouraged readers to take a violent action constituted a “true threat.”

Ms. Kaplan thus likened the defendants not only to murderers of doctors but
perpetrators of the Holocaust. And again, as she has repeatedly, Kaplan talked openly
of the legal theory behind plaintiffs’ complaint.
RELEVANT LEGAL AUTHORITY
This is a jury trial case. Ms. Kaplan has made repeated prejudicial remarks that she knew
or reasonably should have known would be disseminated widely to the public through a variety
15
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 15 of 19 Pageid#: 1676

of well-read print and web outlets with global readerships. In the course of these remarks
Kaplan, explained the plaintiffs’ legal theory of the case and described the alleged evidence they
claim they will offer in support of their claims. More disconcertingly, in a series of emotionallycharged statements Kaplan again and again linked the defendants to accused school shooter
Nikolas Cruz, to perpetrators of the Holocaust, to murderers of doctors, to a supposed rise in acts
and expressions of anti-semitism across the country, and to offensive posts by unknown persons.
Kaplan facilitated the provision and publication of lengthy accounts of the purported facts and
critical aspects of the Charlottesville events by a plaintiff. Kaplan knew or reasonably should
have known that the audience for all of this media output included potential jurors in the Western
District of Virginia. Her activity , has thus fatally undermined the right of Peinovich and the
other defendants to a fair trial in this case. This Court has the inherent authority to rectify Ms.
Kaplan’s abusive and prejudicial conduct by dismissing plaintiffs’ amended complaint. See, e.g.,
United States v. Shaffer Equipment Company, 11 F.3d 450, 461-62 (4th Cir. 1993).

Peinovich

respectfully requests this sanction.
It is instructive in this regard that Ms. Kaplan’s media campaign of extrajudicial
statements patently contravenes Section 3.6 of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct.
Section 3.6 provides:
(a) A lawyer who is participating in or has participated in a criminal or civil
matter shall not make an extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or
reasonably should know will be disseminated by means of public communication
and will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative
proceeding in the matter. (b) A statement ordinarily is likely to prejudice
materially an adjudicative proceeding when it refers to a civil matter triable to a
jury, a criminal matter or any other proceeding that could result in incarceration,
and the statement relates to: (1) the character, credibility, reputation or criminal

16
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 16 of 19 Pageid#: 1677

record of a party, suspect in a criminal investigation or witness, or the identity of a
witness or the expected testimony of a party or witness …

Virginia’s Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6, it is true, appears to apply only to criminal matters.
Virginia’s decision to limit Rule 3.6 to criminal matters, however, does not, Peinovich submits,
give parties in civil cases a blank check to mount publicity campaigns that taint the jury pool and
compromise an opposing party’s fundamental right to a fair trial.

See, e.g., Stradtman v.

Republic Services, Inc., 121 F.Supp.2d 578, 581 (E.D. Va. 2015) (court has inherent authority to
sanction an attorneys conduct even if procedural rules exist which sanction the same conduct).
This Court’s authority over the attorneys who practice before it, including those admitted pro
haec vice, is a matter of federal law; the Court may adopt the local state’s Rules of Professional
Conduct. See, e.g., Laugier v. City of New York, 2014 WL 6655283 at * 2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24,
2014). The overarching and controlling principle is the Court’s inherent authority to assure a fair
trial. In any event, under Rule 8.4 of the Virginia Rules, “It is professional misconduct for a
lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or
induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.” “Rules of Professional Conduct”
in this context can reasonably be interpreted as encompassing the Rules of Professional Conduct
of the state in which a pro haec vice attorney is licensed and practices law.
Ms. Kaplan has also violated other ethical rules, under the Virginia and New York Rules.
Her apparent insinuation that she has preferred access to the Court contravenes 8.4(d) of the
Virginia rules, which declares that an attorney shall not “state or imply an ability to influence
improperly or upon irrelevant grounds any tribunal, legislative body, or public official,” and Rule
8.4(e) of the New York rules, which is similar.

Ms. Kaplan’s repeated public discussions

17
Case 3:17-cv-00072-NKM-JCH Document 258 Filed 03/10/18 Page 17 of 19 Pageid#: 1678

regarding the purpose of the plaintiffs’ lawsuit, including the cases it is modeled after, not only
waive plaintiffs’ attorney client privilege as to this topic but makes Ms. Kaplan a fact witness, in
contravention of Rule 3.7 of the Virginia and New York rules.

Defendants have repeatedly

contended, in their motions to dismiss and elsewhere, that the plaintiffs’ complaint is an
improperly motivated SLAPP suit, making the motivations of the plaintiffs and attorneys in filing
it a live issue.
Finally, if the Court does not order dismissal of the suit as an appropriate sanction, it has
authority under FRCP 16(c)(P) to “take appropriate action on … facilitating in other ways the
just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of the action.”

The just, speedy, and inexpensive

disposition of this action requires, at a minimum, that Ms. Kaplan be instructed to cease her
social media and print and television media campaign against Peinovich and the other
defendants.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, Peinovich respectfully requests that plaintiffs’ amended complaint
be dismissed as an appropriate sanction for Ms. Kaplan’s numerous, unethical, and prejudicial
extrajudicial statements in this jury trial case. In the alternative, Ms. Kaplan should be instructed
to cease her publicity campaign against the defendants.
