Filed 12/23/11 Page 7 of 23

1

Plaintiff Liliana Cardenas (“Plaintiff”) files this Opposition to Defendants NBTY,

2

Inc.’s and Rexall Sundown, Inc.’s (collectively “Defendants”) Motion to Dismiss the Second

3

Amended Complaint (“Mot.”). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants’ Motion lacks

4

merit and should be denied in its entirety.

5

I.

INTRODUCTION

6

Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) challenges Defendants’ advertising

7

campaign wherein Defendants conveyed a uniform joint health message on the packaging of

8

their Osteo Bi-Flex products,1 in commercial advertisements, on their website, and in other

9

marketing media through their representations that the same core ingredients that are present

10

in each of these Products help “promote mobility”, “renew cartilage”, “maintain healthy

11

connective tissue” and improve joint comfort (“the joint health benefit claims”). Plaintiff’s

12

SAC asserts claims for violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”), Civil

13

Code §1750, et seq., the Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”), Bus. & Prof. Code §17200, et

14

seq., and breach of express warranty created by Defendants’ advertising. Defendants seek to

15

dismiss Plaintiff’s SAC on multiple grounds – all lacking merit.

16

Defendants first argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert claims, either individually

17

or on behalf of the Class, because she purportedly did not view all of the advertising and

18

representations that Defendants made about their Osteo Bi-Flex products and because she did

19

not purchase each of the Osteo Bi-Flex products. Defendants’ standing argument ignores that

20

the conduct at issue involves Defendants’ common course of conduct – an unfair and

21

deceptive advertising campaign wherein Defendants uniformly make the same false

22

representations about virtually identical Products and their purported ability to provide joint

23

health benefits.

24

Next, simply ignoring and misconstruing the actual allegations of the SAC,

25

Defendants recast this consumer protection action as something it is not - a lack of scientific

26
1

27
28

The Osteo Bi-Flex products include: (1) Osteo Bi-Flex One Per Day; (2) Osteo Bi-Flex Triple
Strength; (3) Osteo Bi-Flex Double Strength; (4) Osteo Bi-Flex Triple Strength with Vitamin D;
(5) Osteo Bi-Flex MSM; (6) Osteo Bi-Flex Energy Formula; (7) Osteo Bi-Flex Regular Strength;
and (8) Osteo Bi-Flex Advanced (collectively, “Osteo Bi-Flex” or “the Products”).
1

Case 2:11-cv-01615-LKK -CKD Document 29

Filed 12/23/11 Page 8 of 23

1

substantiation case - and then argue that because there is no private right of action for

2

unsubstantiated claims, Plaintiff’s SAC should be dismissed in its entirety. To the contrary,

3

the SAC alleges false and deceptive advertising, namely that Defendants present a uniform

4

message on all of the Products’ packaging and advertising that the Products will provide

5

specific joint health benefits when, in fact, the scientific evidence says they do not. Plaintiff

6

supports her allegations that Defendants’ joint health benefit claims are false, misleading and

7

likely to deceive the public by alleging that clinical cause and effect studies have found no

8

causative link between the core active ingredients present in the Products and the prevention

9

or lessening of joint degeneration or relief from joint discomfort. In short, the scientific

10

evidence demonstrates that these Products do not work as Defendants represent. Making

11

statements that a product has attributes which it does not have is deceptive advertising under

12

the UCL and CLRA. That the SAC further buttresses the foregoing, by alleging that

13

Defendants have no competent scientific evidence to the contrary does not make this case a

14

lack of substantiation case. These latter allegations merely further corroborate the fact that

15

the scientific evidence is clear that these products do not work as Defendants represent.

16

Finally, Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s claims fail to meet the requirements of

17

Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). However, Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) pleading standards apply because the SAC

18

does not “sound in fraud.” The SAC easily satisfies Rule 8(a)’s notice pleading standards.

19

Further, even if the Court finds the heightened standards of Rule 9(b) apply - which they do

20

not - Plaintiff’s allegations are particularly pled such that Rule 9(b) pleading requirements

21

have been satisfied.

22

As more fully described below, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be denied.

23

II.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

24

Defendants manufacture, distribute, and sell the Osteo Bi-Flex line of joint health

25

dietary supplements comprised of eight virtually identical products.2 SAC ¶¶1, 13. Each of

26
27
28

2

While Plaintiff believes that the identical nature of the Products and the corresponding
misrepresentations has been plead in the SAC, to the extent that the Court deems it necessary for
it to be pled more clearly, Plaintiff seeks leave to amend her Complaint.
2

Case 2:11-cv-01615-LKK -CKD Document 29

Filed 12/23/11 Page 9 of 23

1

the Osteo Bi-Flex products have the same two main ingredients – glucosamine and

2

chondroitin sulfate. ¶¶16, 18.3

3

Since the Products’ launch, Defendants have engaged in an extensive, nationwide

4

advertising campaign, uniformly representing to consumers, including Plaintiff, the joint

5

health benefits associated with taking Osteo Bi-Flex products. ¶¶1, 2, 28. The core of

6

Defendants’ fraudulent representations concerning Osteo Bi-Flex consist of one overriding

7

message with regard to each of the Products: Osteo Bi-Flex will help “promote mobility”,

8

“renew cartilage”, “maintain healthy connective tissue” and improve joint comfort for all

9

joints in the human body for adults of all ages and for all stages of joint disease. ¶28.

10

Defendants conveyed and continue to convey this deceptive message on the Products’

11

packaging, and though a variety of media, including print, television, radio, website and

12

online promotional materials. ¶¶1, 2, 15, 23, 27. In fact, despite minor variations in the

13

Products’ packaging, each and every Product label states that Osteo Bi-Flex helps to

14

“promote mobility”, “renew cartilage”, “maintain healthy connective tissue” and improve

15

joint comfort. ¶¶1, 2, 15, 23. Similarly, all the Osteo Bi-Flex labels include the following

16

graphic emphasizing the Products’ purported joint health benefits (see ¶23):

17
18
19
20
21
22

In truth, Defendants’ Osteo Bi-Flex products do not provide the promised joint health
23

benefits. ¶¶1, 24, 30. Scientific studies have found no causative link between the ingredients
24

in Osteo Bi-Flex and the prevention of joint degeneration or relief from joint discomfort –
25

these studies demonstrate that the Products do not work as represented. ¶¶1, 16-23. In
26

addition, Defendants do not have any competent and reliable scientific evidence to counter
27
28

3

Osteo Bi-Flex One Per Day is the only exception. It does not contain chondroitin sulfate.

1

these studies that have proven that Osteo Bi-Flex does not work as Defendants represent.

2

¶¶16-24. Defendants’ representations are thus false, misleading and reasonably likely to

3

deceive the public. Id. ¶¶1, 15, 22, 24, 29.

4

During the last year and a half, Plaintiff Cardenas purchased Osteo Bi-Flex Regular

5

Strength from a Rite-Aid store in Roseville, California. ¶8. Prior to her purchase, Plaintiff

6

was exposed to Defendants’ advertising campaign. ¶29. She saw and reviewed the label,

7

including the joint health benefit claims. ¶¶8, 29. Indeed, the label reproduced in the

8

Complaint mirrors the label Plaintiff read and relied upon in purchasing the Osteo Bi-Flex

9

Product. ¶23. Defendants’ joint health benefit claims were a material factor in Plaintiff’s

10

decision to purchase the Osteo Bi-Flex Product. ¶29. If Plaintiff had known that Defendants’

11

representations were false and misleading, she would not have purchased Osteo Bi-Flex. ¶¶8,

12

29. As a result, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of the purchase price of the

13

Product. ¶30.

14

III.

DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT SATISFIED THEIR HEAVY BURDEN

15

Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s SAC should be dismissed with prejudice. Not only is

16

Defendants’ “with prejudice” request premature, they have failed to demonstrate that

17

dismissal is appropriate.4 To survive dismissal, a complaint must simply state “enough facts

18

to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face” and “suggest” the required elements of

19

the plaintiff’s claim. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 570 (2007). A claim

20

may proceed even if actual proof is “improbable” and ultimate recovery “unlikely.” Id. The

21

issue “is not whether the plaintiff will prevail in the action, but whether the plaintiff is entitled

22

to offer evidence in support of the claim.” Laster v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 407 F. Supp. 2d

23

1181, 1192 (S.D. Cal. 2005). This Court must accept the factual allegations of the SAC as

24

true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Plaintiff. Cahill, 80 F.3d at 338; see

25

also In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, and Prods.

26
27
28

4

Only under “extraordinary” circumstances is Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal with prejudice proper,
such as where “plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling [him] to relief.” Cahill v. Liberty Mut.
Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 338 (9th Cir. 1996).

Liab. Litig., 754 F.Supp.2d 1145, 1169 (C.D. Cal. 2010). Here, Plaintiff has properly pled her

2

claims and dismissal is not warranted.

IV.

ARGUMENT
A. Plaintiff Has Standing To Assert Claims Based on The Advertised
Representations Pertaining to All the Osteo Bi-Flex Products.

6

Defendants’ challenge Plaintiff’s standing to pursue claims regarding: (1) the Osteo

7

Bi-Flex products she did not purchase; and (2) advertisements she did not view. Mot. at 9.

8

Neither of Defendants’ standing arguments have merit.

9

As an initial matter, Defendants’ contention that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring

10

claims relating to the Osteo Bi-Flex products she did not purchase is a premature and

11

erroneous Rule 23 typicality argument, made under the guise of a standing argument.

12

Plaintiff has standing to pursue her claims because she was injured by Defendants’

13

misrepresentations.

14

regarding Defendants’ joint health benefit representations on the Osteo Bi-Flex Regular

15

Strength packaging – the Osteo Bi-Flex product she purchased. Mot. at 10. This admission

16

ends the standing inquiry since Article III standing is limited to a determination as to whether

17

the named plaintiff has been injured and has individual standing. See, e.g., In re VeriSign,

18

Inc., No. C 02-02270, 2005 WL 88969, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (named plaintiffs need only

19

satisfy threshold standing, i.e., that they suffered a concrete injury because of defendants’

20

wrongdoing; they need not satisfy individual standing as to every injury alleged by the class);

Rule 23 after a class certification record has been developed. In re VeriSign, Inc., at *5. In

2

this vein, District Courts in California have routinely held that whether a class representative

3

“may be allowed to present claims on behalf of others who have similar, but not identical,

4

interests depends not on standing, but on an assessment of typicality and adequacy of

5

representation.” Bruno v. Quten Research Inst., LLC, -- F.R.D. --, 2011 WL 5592880, at *3

(C.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2011) (citing cases and concluding that plaintiff had standing based on

7

her purchase of defendants’ liquid product and whether the plaintiff could represent a class of

8

purchasers of defendants’ gelcap products with similar but different representations would be

9

analyzed “solely under Rule 23”).5

10

When Plaintiff files her class certification motion, she will demonstrate that her claims

11

are typical of all other purchasers of Osteo Bi-Flex products because all 8 Products are

12

essentially the same: same name (“Osteo Bi-Flex”); same core active ingredients

13

(glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate); and same joint health benefit representations. And,

14

Plaintiff – like all other Osteo Bi-Flex purchasers - was injured by Defendants’ uniform

15

misrepresentations about these Products.6

16

Even if they were not identical in all material respects, Plaintiff would still have

17

standing to pursue claims on behalf of those consumers who, like her, were injured as a result

14

Bi-Flex Product. ¶¶2, 8, 15, 28-29. Plaintiff, like all others who purchased any of the Osteo

15

Bi-Flex products, was injured by Defendants’ common course of conduct. To allow non-

16

material differences in these products to result in Defendants not being held accountable for

17

this common course of conduct would merely reward Defendants for creative packaging and

18

eviscerate the heart of California’s consumer fraud laws – consumer protection.

Moreover, courts have rejected similar contentions that plaintiffs should not be

20

permitted to challenge the uniform joint health benefit claims made by Defendants (though

the claims are the same) that are made in other forms of advertisements they may or may not

25

3

sense. Were it otherwise, every class action would need a representative for every type of

4

advertisement – one for radio, one for television, one for labeling, one for the internet, etc.,

5

despite the fact that, as Plaintiff alleges here, all of the advertisements carried the same

6

message and misrepresentations. Moreover, the core of Defendants’ misrepresentations start

7

and end with the packaging of the Products which on each package includes the same

8

misrepresentations – misrepresentations that the SAC alleges Plaintiffs read and relied upon.

9

B. Plaintiff Properly Alleges Claims for False and Deceptive Advertising

10

Defendants attempt to cast Plaintiff’s case as something it is not - a “lack of

11

substantiation” case – rather than the false advertising case that it is. Mot. at 11.10 In doing

12

so, Defendants cherry pick allegations out of context and completely ignore other allegations

13

that clearly demonstrate that this is not a lack of substantiation case. It is black letter law that

14

the Complaint must be read as a whole. See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551

15

U.S. 308, 322 (2007) (“Courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other

16

sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss.”). When

17

read as a whole, Plaintiff does plead that the advertising statements are “false or misleading.”

18

Specifically, the SAC alleges that Defendants’ joint health benefit claims are false,

19

misleading and likely to deceive the public because: (1) the Products do not work as

20

advertised; (2) clinical cause and effect studies have found the ingredients in the Products are

21

not effective in preventing joint degeneration or relief from joint discomfort; and (3) as

22

further corroboration of this, Defendants do not have competent and reliable scientific

23

27
28

See also Fitzpatrick v. General Mills, Inc., 263 F.R.D. 687, 694 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (a plaintiff
seeking to prove the deceptiveness of an advertisement “may rely on any evidence concerning
that message, including the advertisements to which he or she was not personally exposed”)
(review granted by the Eleventh Circuit on unrelated issues)).
10
Likewise, Plaintiff does not allege a “nondisclosure claim.” Mot. at 18. Rather, Plaintiff’s
claims are premised on the fact that Defendants represented that their Osteo Bi-Flex products had
certain joint health benefits when, in fact, those representations were false, misleading, likely to
deceive consumers because, inter alia, the scientific evidence has demonstrated that they do not
work as Defendants represent.

evidence to suggest otherwise.11 See, e.g., ¶¶2, 15-24, 27, 29-30, 59. The Court is required to

2

take these allegations as true. Syverson v. IBM Corp., 472 F.3d 1072, 1075 (9th Cir. 2007).12

3

Further, to the extent the Court finds Plaintiff’s complaint includes a “lack of

4

substantiation” claim,13 Defendants’ contention that the “lack of substantiation” claims are

5

improper has been rejected on several occasions and for good reason – representing that

6

something has proven attributes when no such proof exists is false, deceptive and misleading.

7

For example, in Rikos, the plaintiff alleged that P&G’s representations regarding the

8

“clinically proven” digestive benefits of “Align,” a daily food supplement, were false,

9

misleading and reasonably likely to deceive because there was no clinical data showing that

10

Align improved digestion. P&G, like Defendants here, argued that these were improper “lack

11

of substantiation claims.” 2011 WL 1707209, at *3. The court in Rikos soundly rejected this

12

argument holding: “Defendant alleges that, in a false advertising case, plaintiff must plead

13

and prove that the advertising statements are ‘false or misleading’—which is exactly what

14

Plaintiff pleads,” and, therefore, the Rikos court declined to find that the plaintiff’s complaint

15

“was filed under an alleged ‘lack of scientific substantiation’ theory.” Id.; see also Morey,

16

2010 WL 2473314, at *1 (denying motion to dismiss where the plaintiff alleged that the

17

defendants’ advertising and labeling claims were false, misleading and reasonably likely to

18

deceive the public because “the GoodBelly products have never been clinically tested and

19

NextFoods has no basis to make these claims.”). Thus, even if one were to characterize

20
11

21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

To the extent that Defendants contend that this last prong is a lack of substantiation claim, such
a contention takes it out of its context – a context in which Plaintiff has affirmatively plead that
the accepted scientific evidence is that these products do not work as represented.
12
Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, Plaintiff need not provide detailed factual allegations
regarding the clinical cause and effect studies referenced in the SAC. Plaintiff’s allegations are
sufficient to put Defendants on notice that studies have found Defendants’ products do not work
as represented and that their joint health benefit claims are false, misleading and deceptive. Rule
8 requires nothing more.
13
Defendants’ continued references to the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in this motion are
nothing more than attempts to distract this Court from the actual allegations alleged against them
in the operative SAC. It is black letter law that once a plaintiff files an amended complaint, the
original pleading no longer serves any function in the case. See Loux v. Rhay, 375 F.2d 55, 57
(9th Cir.1967) (“The amended complaint supersedes the original, the latter being treated
thereafter as nonexistent.”); Lino v. Small, No. 09cv1834 2011 WL 4353119, at *4 (S.D. Cal.
Mar. 11, 2011). As such, even if the FAC was primarily a lack of substantiation case (which it is
not), this Court is required to accept as true the allegations in Plaintiff’s SAC.

1

Plaintiff’s claims as alternatively relying upon a purported lack of substantiation claim, as

2

these cases demonstrate that, regardless of what label one places upon the claim alleged, it is

3

actionable conduct when a manufacturer makes false and misleading health benefit claims

4

about a product without having competent scientific proof supporting those claims.

5

Defendants’ citations to “lack of substantiation” cases are inapposite.

See, e.g.,

6

Barrera v. Pharmavite, LLC, No. CV 11-04153 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2011) (unlike here, the

7

complaint in Barrera “primarily allege[d] the claims on defendant’s labels lack

8

substantiation.”);14 Chavez v. Nestle, USA, Inc., No. CV 09-9192, 2011 WL 2150128 (C.D.

9

Cal. May 19, 2011) (plaintiffs offered no support for the contention that lack of substantiation

10

could render Defendant’s claims misleading); Fraker v. Bayer Corp., No. CV F 08-1564,

11

2009 WL 5865687 (E.D. Cal. May 4, 2011) (after the court struck the FTC allegations in the

12

complaint, there was nothing else that alleged false and deceptive conduct on the part of the

13

defendant).

14

Finally, Defendants’ purported Rule 11 claim that Plaintiff failed to conduct a

15

reasonable investigation prior to alleging her false and deceptive advertising claims is

16

nonsensical. For example, Defendants’ citation to Johns v. Bayer, No. 09CV1935, 2010 WL

17

476688 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2010) - where the court struck certain allegations because it

18

determined the allegations were merely borrowed from a FTC complaint letter and not part of

19

an independent investigation – has no application here where, as Defendants acknowledge,

20

that Plaintiff did not borrow from a FTC or FDA complaint. In fact, Plaintiff’s allegations are

21

a result of Plaintiff’s and counsel’s independent investigation and there is nothing in the

22

record – other than Defendants’ ipse dixit - to support their unfounded Rule 11 contentions.

23

As such, Defendants’ rattling of the Rule 11 saber is without basis and should be rejected.

Plaintiff has pled claims for violations of the UCL and CLRA for “fraudulent”

2

business practices – not common law fraud. Under the UCL, a “fraudulent” business practice

3

“is one which is likely to deceive the public” and does not require actual falsity or fraud. See

7

predicated on deceptive conduct only constitute actual fraud claims when the elements of

8

common law fraud have been pled. See Bank of the West v. Valley Nat’l Bank, 41 F.3d 471,

9

477 (9th Cir. 1994) (the elements of actual fraud include a false “representation”, “knowledge

10

11

476688, at *5 (holding that false advertising claims under the UCL and CLRA were not

12

“grounded in fraud” and therefore, Rule 9 did not apply because plaintiff did not allege all the

13

elements of fraud, namely, knowledge of falsity or intent to induce reliance). Unless a

14

“fraudulent” business practice claim is specifically predicated on common law fraud, the

15

principles of Rule 8(a) notice pleading apply. See In re Mattel, Inc., Toy Lead Paint Prods.

16

Liab. Litig., 588 F. Supp. 2d 1111, 1118 (C.D. Cal. 2008).

17

Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions are likely to

18

and did deceive reasonable consumers.15 See, e.g., ¶¶3, 8, 29-30, 51. Plaintiff does not allege

19

intent or other elements of common law fraud.16 Plaintiff’s situation is similar to that in In re

20

Mattel, Inc., where the plaintiffs brought claims premised on the defendants making

21

representations about its toy products that likely deceived the consuming public. 588 F.

22

Supp. 2d at 1118. In that case, the court distinguished the plaintiffs’ action from that in Vess

23

28

Plaintiff’s claim is that the Products are unable to provide the joint health benefits Defendants
promised. Contrary to Defendants’ argument, it is not “unreasonable” for consumers who are
purchasing the Osteo Bi-Flex products to help them with their joint-related health problems to
believe that a product advertised as having joint health benefits actually has those benefits.
16
The Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., 567 F.3d 1120 (9th Cir. 2009) case, upon which Defendants
rely, is distinguishable. There, the court found that the plaintiff’s UCL claim sounded in fraud
and therefore Rule 9(b) applied. Id. at 1127. However, in Kearns, unlike here, the plaintiff
specifically alleged all the elements of common law fraud—including the element of “intent.” Id.

alleged facts that necessarily constituted fraud, whereas the plaintiffs in Vess had based their

3

UCL claim on a fraudulent scheme. See id.

4

representations and material omissions Defendants made concerning the effectiveness of the

5

Products are false, misleading and deceived Plaintiff and Class members into purchasing the

6

Osteo Bi-Flex products. Because Plaintiff’s UCL and CLRA claims are not predicated on

7

common law fraud, the principles of Rule 8(a) notice pleading apply.

8

Here, Plaintiff similarly alleges that the

2. Plaintiff Has Satisfied Rule 8(a)

9

Plaintiff’s allegations satisfy Rule 8(a) by providing “fair notice” of Plaintiff’s claims.

10

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ Osteo Bi-Flex advertising campaign deceptively

11

misrepresents the joint health benefits of the Products. See, e.g., ¶¶1, 2, 15-24, 26, 29, 50.

12

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ representations are further false and misleading because

13

clinical cause and effect studies have found no causative link between the ingredients in

14

Osteo Bi-Flex and the prevention of joint degeneration or relief from joint discomfort and

15

Defendants do not have any competent and reliable scientific evidence to support their joint

16

health claims. See, e.g., ¶¶1, 16-24, 27. And, Plaintiff alleges that she relied on Defendants’

17

joint health benefit claims in purchasing the Osteo Bi-Flex Product and as a result suffered

18

damage in the amount of the purchase price. See, e.g., ¶¶8, 29-30. Thus, Defendants are

19

clearly on notice of the conduct of which it must defend against.

20

Defendants improperly attempt to hold Plaintiff to an unreasonable pleading standard

21

for her claims, which are not grounded in fraud.

22

Plaintiff’s allegations concerning “clinical cause and effect studies” are insufficient because

23

she has not identified the researchers, the length or duration of the studies, or the

24

methodology and specific conclusions. Mot. at 15. Plaintiff, however, need not prove her

25

case at this stage of the litigation but need only give the defendant “fair notice of the claim

26

and the grounds upon which it rests.” Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007) (citing

(under Rule 9(b), a pleading must “identif[y] the circumstances of the alleged fraud so that

10

the defendant can prepare an adequate answer.”).17

11

Indeed, it has been held that plaintiffs sufficiently “establish[ed] the time, place, and

12

specific content requirements of Rule 9(b)” where they alleged that during a certain period of

13

time the defendant made certain labeling claims on its drink products, submitted examples of

14

the labels, explained what was misleading about the labels, and alleged that they would not

15

have purchased the products had they known the truth. Von Koening v. Snapple Beverage

16

Corp., 713 F. Supp. 2d 1066, 1077-78 (E.D. Cal. 2010); In re Ferrero Litig., No. 11-205,

17

2011 WL 5438979, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2011) (“Plaintiffs also provide the ‘when’ by

18

stating that the long term advertising campaign occurred during the Class Period[]. These

19

allegations are sufficient to meet Rule 9(b)’s pleading standards.”).

20

Here, the SAC describes a long-term advertising campaign and specifies the exact

21

language Defendants have used to describe the Products on their packaging and

22

advertisements, as well as attaching the specific Product label Plaintiff viewed. ¶¶2, 13, 15-

23

28. Plaintiff further alleges the place the advertising was seen (the Product packaging), the

24

place of purchase (Ride-Aid), the time of exposure, review and purchase (before purchasing

17

Pursuant to Rule 9(b), allegations of knowledge may be alleged generally. See Robbins v.
Hometown Buffet, Inc., No. 94-1655-J (BTM), 1995 WL 908194, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 1995)
(Rule 9(b) satisfied by generally alleging “that each Defendants knew of the falsity of the
misrepresentations and omissions”). Here, Plaintiff has generally alleged Defendants knew of the
falsity or deceptiveness of their representations. See, e.g., ¶¶25-28.

the Product a year and a half ago), which Osteo Bi-Flex Plaintiff purchased (Osteo Bi-Flex

2

Regular Strength), and the specific joint health claims Plaintiff was exposed to and relied

3

upon in making her purchase. ¶¶8, 29. Plaintiff further alleges she would not have purchased

4

the Product had she known that clinical cause and effect studies have found that the

5

ingredients in Osteo Bi-Flex do not provide the joint health benefits represented. Id. As

6

such, the SAC meets Rule 9(b)’s requirements and provides all pertinent details concerning

7

the content, place, and time of the particular deceptive misrepresentations made to the

8

Plaintiff by Defendants. These allegations are sufficiently particular for Defendants to defend

9

themselves. See, e.g., Von Koening, 713 F. Supp. 2d at 1077-78.

10

Thus, Plaintiff has undoubtedly put Defendants on notice by clearly pleading facts

11

showing that Defendants (the “who”) promised that Osteo Bi-Flex would provide joint health

12

benefits (the “what”) in their advertisements, including the Products labeling and packaging

13

(the “where”) going as far back as 1996 (the “when”). See, e.g., ¶¶13, 15. Rather than

14

disclose their knowledge that the Osteo Bi-Flex products did not provide the promised

15

benefits as advertised, Defendants continued to build on their deceptive messages and make

16

more and more false promises (the “how”), which induced Plaintiff and others to purchase the

17

Products (the “why”). See, e.g., ¶¶15-30. Defendants cannot genuinely contend that they are

18

not now on “notice of the particular misconduct” against which they must defend.

19

Neubronner v. Milken, 6 F.3d at 666, 671-72 (9th Cir. 1993). None of the cases cited by

20

Defendants require more.

21

V.

CONCLUSION

22

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Second

23

Amended Class Action Complaint should be denied in its entirety. If, however, the Court

24

dismisses any portion of the Complaint, Plaintiff requests leave to amend.18

25
18

26
27
28

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) (leave to amend should be “freely given when justice so requires”);
Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Dismissal with
prejudice and without leave is not appropriate unless it is clear on de novo review that the
complaint could not be saved by amendment.”). Indeed, in the cases Defendants rely on where
the plaintiffs proffered less evidence than in this case, courts still granted leave to amend. See,
e.g., Fraker, 2009 WL 5865687, at *10; Barrera, No. CV 2:11-04153 (same).
