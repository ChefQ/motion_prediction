INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs, Ari Weitzner and Ari Weitzner, M.D., P.C. (collectively “Weitzner”), submit this
Memorandum of Law in support of Plaintiffs’ motion, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure, for an Order: (1) granting reconsideration of, and vacating, the Order of this
Court, dated February 22, 2013, which dismissed the Complaint as barred by claim preclusion and
issue preclusion; (2) vacating the Judgment of this Court dated March 5, 2013 (ECF No. 23); (3)
administratively closing the present case pending the resolution of the appeal of Ari Weitzner, M.D.,
P.C., on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated v. Cynosure, Inc. (Massachusetts Appeals
Court, No.2013-P-0264); and (4) granting Plaintiffs any additional relief authorized by law.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
The present action was commenced on July 23, 2012. Plaintiffs, each of whom are residents
of New York, see Compl., ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 5, 6, received four unsolicited facsimile advertisements from
Defendant, Cynosure, Inc. (“Cynosure”). See id., ¶¶ 8-11 (a copy of the facsimile advertisements is
annexed to the Complaint as Exhibits “A” through “D”). Those facsimiles were among at least 10,000
1

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 6 of 13 PageID #: 571

such facsimiles that were sent by Cynosure. See id., ¶ 13. The sending of those facsimiles violated the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 (“TCPA”), which states that “[i]t shall be
unlawful for any person within the United States . . . to use any telephone facsimile machine,
computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.”
47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(C). Each recipient of such a facsimile is entitled to statutory damages of a
minimum of $500.00 per violation. See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3). The TCPA also awards injunctive
relief. See id. Weitzner seeks both statutory damages and injunctive relief individually and on behalf
of the putative class. See Compl., Wherefore Cl., (a) - (d).1
In an action brought in Massachusetts state court on May 24, 2005, by Ari Weitzner, M.D.,
P.C. (but not by Ari Weitzner individually) (Ari Weitzner, M.D., P.C., on behalf of itself and all
others similarly situated v. Cynosure, Inc., Mass. Super. Ct., Middlesex Co., No. 05-1778), which
arose upon the receipt of the same four facsimiles that gave rise to Weitzner’s claims in the present
action, the complaint defined the class on a nationwide basis, see Massachusetts Complaint at ¶¶ 1-5
(a copy of which is annexed as Exhibit “A” to the Declaration of Todd C. Bank (“Bank Decl.”)).
On August 10, 2005, Cynosure served a motion to dismiss the Massachusetts Complaint on
the basis that the Massachusetts action was brought primarily for monetary damages rather than
equitable relief and that, therefore, the class allegations, insofar as they pertained to a nationwide
class, were precluded by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because
Massachusetts law does not provide opt-out rights to class members. On January 31, 2006, the
Massachusetts court denied that motion. See Bank Decl., Exh. “B.” Extensive discovery, both written

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 7 of 13 PageID #: 572

and oral, ensued.
On February 6, 2008, Weitzner served a motion for class certification in the Massachusetts
action. Nearly four years later, on January 24, 2012, a judge to whom the Massachusetts action had
been reassigned after the denial of Cynosure’s dismissal motion expressed his disagreement with the
denial by the first judge and ruled that certification of a nationwide class was precluded by the Due
Process clause. See Bank Decl., Exh. “C,” at 2-5. Although this ruling alone precluded class
certification, the court proceeded to find that Weitzner had not satisfied some of the Massachusetts
class-action prerequisites. See id. at 6-10.
With the only remaining claims in the Massachusetts action being the individual claims of
Ari Weitzner, M.D., P.C., Plaintiffs commenced the present action on July 23, 2012, because they
wished to continue to seek to represent a nationwide class of facsimile recipients.
On November 28, 2012, the Massachusetts trial court entered a judgment in response to a
motion brought by Cynosure (which Weitzner opposed). The motion had sought (1) the entry of
judgment in favor of Weitzner with respect to his individual claims and (2) the recovery of the costs
that Cynosure incurred following an offer of judgment that Cynosure had made to Weitzner in 2007.
The judgment stated as follows:
FINAL JUDGMENT: Pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54 and 58,
Judgment hereby enters as follows: 1. In accordance with the Court’s
Memorandum of Decision and Order dated January 24, 2012, the
Class Allegations of the Complaint are hereby dismissed, with
prejudice. 2. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff under Count I on his
individual claim under 47 U.S.C. S.227, and Plaintiff is awarded the
sum of $6,000, without costs. 3. Defendant Cynosure, Inc., its
officers, directors, employees and agents are permanently enjoined
from using any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other
device to send an unsolicited advertisement to telephone facsimile
number (718) 256-5465 and/or any other telephone facsimile number
3

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 8 of 13 PageID #: 573

which the Plaintiff by affidavit filed and served within 30 days after
entry of Judgment demonstrates it either subscribes to or uses in the
ordinary course of its business. 4. Pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 68,
Defendant is awarded the costs it inc[u]rred in defending this action
accrued since July 3, 2007, in the amount $3,495.12 for costs of
transcripts only.
(a copy of the judgment is annexed as Exhibit “D” to the Declaration of Todd C. Bank).
In response to the dismissal of Weitzner’s claims by the Massachusetts trial court, this Court
issued an order on December 11, 2012 directing Weitzner to “brief the Court on why the Court
should not dismiss the action based on claim and/or issue preclusion” and permitting Cynosure to
submit a reply. Both Weitzner and Cynosure submitted responses to the Order. See ECF Nos. 19-21,
and 22, respectively). Weitzner did not submit arguments regarding claim and/or issue preclusion
but, in light of the fact that Weitzner had already filed a notice of appeal of the Massachusetts trial
court’s judgment, instead “submit[ted] that a stay pending the resolution of the appeal in
Massachusetts would be more appropriate, more logical, and, ultimately, more efficient.” Plaintiffs’
Memorandum of Law, ECF No. 19, at 1.
On February 22, 2013, this Court issued the following minute entry announcing the dismissal
of the Complaint: “Minute Entry for proceedings held before Judge Margo K. Brodie: Motion
Hearing held on February 22, 2013 re [12] MOTION to Dismiss. Daniel A. Osborn appeared on
behalf of Plaintiffs. Michael Wood appeared on behalf of Defendant. For the reasons stated on the
record, the Complaint is dismissed because the action is precluded under claim preclusion and issue
preclusion.”

ARGUMENT
POINT I
THIS ACTION SHOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVELY
CLOSED PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL OF
THE JUDGMENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS TRIAL COURT
A.

This Court has Broad Discretion to Grant the Relief Sought
In Stevens v. Miller, 676 F.3d 62 (2d Cir. 2012), the court explained that:
Rule 60(b)(6) authorizes a district court to grant relief to a
moving party for “any other reason that justifies relief.” It is a grand
reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case. But that
reservoir is not bottomless. Recognizing Rule 60(b)(6)’s potentially
sweeping reach, courts require the party seeking to avail itself of the
Rule to demonstrate that “extraordinary circumstances” warrant
relief. Of particular concern is that parties may attempt to use Rule
60(b)(6) to circumvent the one-year time limitation in other
subsections of Rule 60(b).
Recognizing this concern, we have found that Rule 60(b)(1)
and Rule 60(b)(6) are “mutually exclusive,” such that any conduct
which generally falls under the former cannot stand as a ground for
relief under the latter. Where a party’s Rule 60(b) motion is premised
on grounds fairly classified as mistake, inadvertence, or neglect, relief
under Rule 60(b)(6) is foreclosed.

Id. at 67 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, Weitzner does not make a claim of mistake,
inadvertence, or neglect; nor, of course, is Weitzner circumventing the one-year time limitation in
other subsections of Rule 60(b).
B.

This Action Should be Administratively Closed
In Penn West Associates, Inc. v. Cohen, 371 F.3d 118 (3d Cir. 2004), the court noted that

“[t]he Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has addressed the purpose and significance of
administrative closings in Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio L.L.C., 166 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir.1999).”

5

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 10 of 13 PageID #: 575

Id. at 126. As Penn West detailed:
The Lehman Court explained the nature of an administrative
closing as follows:
Administrative closings comprise a familiar, albeit
essentially ad hoc, way in which courts remove cases from
their active files without making any final adjudication. See
Corion Corp. v. Chen, 964 F.2d 55, 56-57 (1st Cir.1992)
(holding that an order deeming a case “administratively
closed” was not a final, appealable order absent a separate
document to signal the court’s “view that the case had
concluded”). The method is used in various districts
throughout the nation in order to shelve pending, but dormant,
cases. See, e.g., id.; In re Arbitration Between Phila. Elec. Co.
v. Nuclear Elec. Ins. Ltd., 845 F.Supp. 1026, 1028
(S.D.N.Y.1994); Mercer v. Allegheny Ludlum Corp., 132
F.R.D. 38, 38-39 (W.D.Pa.1990), aff’d, 931 F.2d 50 (3d
Cir.1991). We endorse the judicious use of administrative
closings by district courts in circumstances in which a case,
though not dead, is likely to remain moribund for an
appreciable period of time.
Properly understood, an administrative closing has no
effect other than to remove a case from the court’s active
docket and permit the transfer of records associated with the
case to an appropriate storage repository. “In no event does
such an order bar a party from restoring the action to the
Court’s active calendar upon an appropriate application.” In
re Arbitration, 845 F.Supp. at 1028 (S.D.N.Y.1994).
Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).
Id. at 127 (emphases in first paragraph added).
As the Penn West court further explained:
Lehman’s view of administrative closings has been followed
by the Courts of Appeals for the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits. See,
e.g., Florida Ass’n for Retarded Citizens v. Bush, 246 F.3d 1296,
1298 (11th Cir.2001) (“Designating a case ‘closed’ does not prevent
the court from reactivating a case either of its own accord or at the
request of the parties.”); Cantrell v. International Broth. of Elec.
6

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 11 of 13 PageID #: 576

Workers, AFL-CIO, Local 2021, 69 F.3d 456, 457 (10th Cir.1995);
see also American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, 294 F.3d 702, 715
(5th Cir.2002) (Dennis, J., concurring) (“[T]he administrative closure
reflects nothing more than the federal courts’ overarching concern
with tidy dockets; it has no jurisdictional significance.”); cf.
Mickeviciute v. I.N.S., 327 F.3d 1159, 1161 n. 1 (10th Cir.2003)
(noting that an “[a]dministrative closure of [an immigration] case
temporarily removes the case from an immigration judge’s
calendar.... The administrative closing of a case does not result in a
final order. It is merely an administrative convenience which allows
the removal of cases from the calendar in appropriate situations”).
Lehman presents a reasoned explication of a device that, when
used in correct context, enhances a district court’s ability to manage
its docket. We adopt that rationale and hold that an order merely
directing that a case be marked closed constitutes an administrative
closing that has no legal consequence other than to remove that case
from the district court’s active docket.
***
As the Lehman Court noted, a district court can provide, in the text of
its order, a built-in timetable under which the administrative closing
may automatically expire, or, alternatively, mature into a final
decision. See 166 F.3d at 392 n. 4.
Id. at 128 (emphases added). As Penn West and Lehman make clear, an administrative closure would
benefit this Court in two ways: it would remove the present case from the active docket while, at the
same time, enable this Court to maintain sufficient control of the case.
Another key benefit of an administrative closure is that, whereas an order of administrative
closure is not appealable, the dismissal that this Court has issued is, of course, appealable. Thus, the
promotion of judicial efficiency would be promoted by an administrative closure because Weitzner
would otherwise be forced to commence the appellate process in this action, which, insofar as it
would be predicated upon the dismissal of the Massachusetts action, would have to be vacated if
Weitzner’s appeal of the Massachusetts dismissal were successful. An administrative closure, on the
7

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 12 of 13 PageID #: 577

other hand, would render the Second Circuit’s involvement, as well as the parties’ involvement
before the Second Circuit, unnecessary.
Furthermore, and significantly, the Penn West court added that “‘the power to resurrect [an
administratively closed case is not] reserved to the parties. The court, too, retains the authority to
reinstate a case if it concludes that the administrative closing was improvident or if the circumstances
that sparked the closing abate.’” Penn West 371 F.3d at 127, quoting Lehman, 166 F.3d at 392. Thus,
in the event that Weitzner’s Massachusetts appeal is unsuccessful, this Court would have the
authority to sua sponte reinstate the present action and issue a final dismissal.
The facts of the present case are analogous to those at issue in Aurecchione v. Schoolman
Transp. System, Inc., 426 F.3d 635 (2d Cir. 2005), in which an order of administrative closure was
issued. In Aurecchione, the plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint against her former employer
with a state agency, which, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, filed a copy of
the complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”). See id. at 637. The
state agency subsequently issued a decision in the plaintiff’s favor, see id., and in the same month
that the state agency did so, the EEOC issued the plaintiff a Notice of Right to Sue in federal court.
See id. The plaintiff thereafter commenced a federal action. See id. However, the plaintiff had also
taken an appeal from the state agency’s decision. See id. (specifically, “[she] appealed the [agency]’s
award to the New York State Supreme Court for Suffolk County because, inter alia, the [agency]
refused to include pre-judgment interest in the award. She was subsequently awarded this interest
when, three years later, the Court of Appeals of New York ultimately decided the state law
computation of interest question in [her] favor,” id. at 637, n.1). As the court noted, “[the] federal
suit was administratively closed . . . [and] was later reinstated to active status . . . when the state
8

Case 1:12-cv-03668-MKB-RLM Document 27 Filed 08/14/13 Page 13 of 13 PageID #: 578

appeal was resolved.” Id. at 637 (emphases added). Just as the federal court in Aurecchione
administratively closed its case pending the resolution of the plaintiff’s state-court appeal, in which
the state-court appeal stemmed from the same facts that gave rise to the plaintiff’s federal action, this
Court should do likewise in the present action.
CONCLUSION
Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court, pursuant to Rule
60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, issue an Order: (1) granting reconsideration of, and
vacating, the Order of this Court, dated February 22, 2013, which dismissed the Complaint as barred
by claim preclusion and issue preclusion; (2) vacating the Judgment of this Court dated March 5,
2013 (ECF No. 23); (3) administratively closing the present case pending the resolution of the appeal
of Ari Weitzner, M.D., P.C., on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated v. Cynosure, Inc.
(Massachusetts Appeals Court, No.2013-P-0264); and (4) granting Plaintiffs any additional relief
authorized by law.
