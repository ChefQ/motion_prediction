DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Wen Y. Chiang (“Plaintiff”), a serial litigant1, filed this action on November 14,

2008, attempting to assert various claims against Defendants FIA Card Services, N.A. (“FIA”),2
and Bank of America, N.A. (collectively “Defendants”), all of which were entirely premised on
the propriety of Defendants’ credit furnishing conduct in 2008 prior to the filing of his action.
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on December 15, 2008, asserting additional
claims for Constitutional violations based on the same alleged conduct. This Court previously

1 Plaintiff has filed over 35 lawsuits in two years. Moreover, this is the third action in two years

Plaintiff has filed against Defendants in an effort to avoid debt obligations and extract a
settlement. In 2006, Plaintiff filed an action which was pending before Judge Saris and
Magistrate Judge Alexander, Case No. 06-12258-PBS. Judge Saris granted Defendants’ motion
for summary judgment in July 2009 and judgment was entered in favor of Defendants. Plaintiff
also filed a separate action, purportedly for his brother, which was pending before this Court,
Case. No. 07-11733. This Court recently dismissed Plaintiff’s claim in that action for violation
of this Court’s order, and further issued sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel.
2 FIA was formerly known as MBNA America Bank, N.A. (and erroneously sued herein as

MBNA (A Bank of America Company)).

dismissed all of Plaintiff’s claims on the pleadings, with the exception of his Count IV brought
under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), which is the only remaining claim.
On July 28, 2009, counsel for Plaintiff and Defendants participated in a scheduling
conference in which the Court sought to narrow the issues and, in part, ordered Plaintiff to
identify the specific account(s) at issue in this action, permitting him to amend his FAC to clarify
this issue within five days of the scheduling conference. Plaintiff did not comply with this
Court’s Order. Instead, in blatant disregard of the Court’s order and the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, over a month later, Plaintiff improperly filed his Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”). Further, not only did Plaintiff fail to comply with this Court’s existing Order or obtain
leave of court, he also expanded his allegations beyond the scope allowed by the Court in its
previous limited order. Contrary to responding to this Court’s directive and efforts to focus this
case, Plaintiff again attempts to complicate and confuse the issues, raise distractions and delay.
Accordingly, the Court should grant FIA’s motion and strike Plaintiff’s SAC in its entirety.

LEGAL ANALYSIS
A.

Legal Standard For Motion To Strike

A court may strike “from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant,
immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(f); Cool Light Co., Inc., v.
GTE Products Corp., 832 F.Supp. 449, 463 (D.Mass. 1993). Any answer or other pleading filed
beyond the time permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by a court may be stricken
under rule 12(f) as untimely if the pleader failed to obtain leave to file the pleading late. See,
e.g., Hamilton v Myerow, 2009 WL 885957, *3 (Mass. Land Ct. 2009) (granting motion to strike
plaintiff’s supplemental brief as untimely and redundant to material already on record); Diana v.
Wallace, 2004 WL 225055, *1 (D. Mass. 2004) (affirming order granting appellee’s motion to
strike cross-motion in its entirely as untimely where appellant filed after court ordered deadline);
Sesostris, S.A.E., v. Transportes Novales, S.A., 727 F.Supp. 737, 740 (D.Mass. 1990) (applying
motion to strike as standard for opposing pleading as untimely); Martin v. Hunt, 28 F.R.D. 35,

-2US_ACTIVE-102347974.1

Case 1:08-cv-11908-RWZ Document 27

Filed 09/25/09 Page 3 of 5

35 (D.Mass. 1961) (granting motion to strike in toto where Complaint was argumentative,
redundant, and verbose).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a litigant may amend a pleading once
as a matter of right before a responsive pleading is filed and subsequently by the parties' consent
or “by leave of court.” Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 15(a); Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Intern. of Puerto Rico,
Inc., 156 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1998) (denying Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend for undue
delay where the amended complaint would result in an additional four months of discovery and
extend the trial by one year.)
B.

Plaintiff’s SAC Should Be Stricken In Its Entirety As Untimely And For
Failure To Obtain Leave Of Court

Plaintiff filed his SAC on September 11, 2009, after FIA had already filed an answer to
his FAC and without leave of court or FIA’s consent. To the extent the Court gave limited
permission to Plaintiff to amend his FAC at its July 28, 2009 scheduling conference, Plaintiff
failed to comply with the limited leave granted. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s SAC should be
dismissed in its entirety because it is untimely and was filed without leave of court.
C.

Allegations Improperly Expanded In Plaintiff’s SAC Without The Court’s
Permission Should Be Stricken

In the event the Court does not strike Plaintiff’s SAC in its entirety, portions of the SAC
improperly expanding allegations should be stricken. Specifically, the Court should strike
paragraph 10 of Plaintiff’s SAC, which alleges:
10.
When Plaintiff learned that defendants had sent negative reports to
credit reporting agencies, plaintiff sent written disputes to credit reporting
agencies regarding his accounts ending in 1736 (formerly ending in 9211.
These written disputes were sent by certified mail at various times
between April 25, 2007 and May 14, 2009. These credit reporting
agencies notified defendants of plaintiff’s disputes and defendants were
required to conduct a reasonable investigation and report back to the credit
reporting agencies within 30 days to indicate that the defendants’ initial
negative report is correct or to make any necessary changes. SAC at ¶ 10.

Paragraph 10 of Plaintiff’s SAC improperly expands the relevant time frame for this
action without the Court’s permission. At the July 28, 2009 scheduling conference, the Court
permitted Plaintiff to amend his FAC to clarify the accounts at issue in this action. Instead of
limiting his SAC to the identification of accounts, Plaintiff improperly seeks to expand the time
frame of the allegations without the Court’s permission. Plaintiff’s FAC alleges that Plaintiff
first sent disputes to Credit Reporting Agencies in July 2008. FAC at ¶¶ 5-6. Plaintiff’s SAC,
however, alleges that the relevant time frame is April 25, 2007 to May 14, 2009. SAC at ¶ 10.
In other words, Plaintiff identifies a time period over a year prior to the time Plaintiff, by his own
admission, first sent a dispute notice!3 Indeed, in an email from Dean Carnahan, Plaintiff’s
counsel, to FIA’s counsel concerning the SAC, Mr. Carnahan concedes that at the scheduling
conference, “the Court instructed plaintiff to file an amended complaint if the relevant account
numbers were other than the account ending in 1736 (formerly 6419).” (Emphasis added.) Mr.
Carnahan does not, and indeed cannot, point to any instruction by the Court allowing him to
expand the allegations to cover a larger time period and, further, has no explanation for failing to
comply with the Court’s prior Order. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of
Mr. Carnahan’s email to FIA’s counsel. Accordingly, the Court should at a minimum strike
paragraph 10 of Plaintiff’s SAC.

3 Plaintiff in fact cannot allege that the relevant time frame for an action based on section 1681s-

2(b)(2) ends in May 2009 when he filed his Complaint on November 14, 2008. Section 1681s2(b)(2) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act provides that a furnisher of credit has at least thirty days
from receipt of the dispute to complete an investigation of a dispute by a consumer. See 15
U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(1)(A). Therefore, Plaintiff’s claim cannot be based on any conduct within the
thirty (30) days preceding the filing of his complaint on November 14, 2008, and certainly
cannot be based on conduct after November 14, 2008.

CONCLUSION
This Court gave Plaintiff an opportunity to clarify the accounts at issue in his latest action

against FIA. Rather than comply with the Court’s order, however, Plaintiff has filed an untimely
and improper SAC. Accordingly, FIA respectfully requests the Court strike Plaintiff’s SAC in
its entirety.
