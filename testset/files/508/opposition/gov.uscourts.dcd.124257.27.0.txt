DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME
Defendants Judicial Watch, Inc. (“Judicial Watch”) and Paul Orfanedes (“Orfanedes”),
by undersigned counsel, hereby oppose Plaintiff’s second Motion for Extension of Time1 to
respond to the Defendants’ Motion to Disqualify Larry Klayman (“Klayman”) as counsel for the
Plaintiff.
1.

This is Plaintiff’s second Motion for an extension of time to respond to

Defendants’ Motion to Disqualify Counsel.
2.

On May 28, 2008, this Court granted Plaintiff’s First Motion to Extend.

3.

Pursuant to LCvR 7 and Rule 6(d), Plaintiff’s response pursuant to the extension

was due on or before today, June 10, 2008.
4.

Plaintiff’s Counsel, Larry Klayman, has known this Opposition is due since the

Court granted Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion on May 28, 2008 but he chose to file this Motion last
minute, the day his response would otherwise be due.
5.

1

Defendants’ Motion to Disqualify was filed on April 22, 2008.

Therefore,

Defendants note that the Motion incorrectly identifies Larry Klayman as the Plaintiff in
this action. The Plaintiff is actually Peter Paul.

Plaintiff’s counsel, pursuant to LCvR 7 and Rule 6(d), has already had over a month since May

condition. Mr. Klayman, however, found time to file a lawsuit against OPEC yesterday, June 9,
2008, and to conduct a press conference yesterday, June 9, 2008, regarding said lawsuit. (See
Ex. 1, copy of Compl.; see also Ex. 2, copy of press release by Larry Klayman dated June 9,
2008; see also Ex. 3, copy of a NY Times article about lawsuit filed by Larry Klayman.).
Defendants submit that this is just another delay tactic by Mr. Klayman.
8.

This litigation has been pending since early February of 2007, more than a year

and three months. Defendants are prejudiced by delay in this matter because Klayman uses the
existence of this litigation as a fundraising tool in connection with his anti-Judicial Watch
advertising campaign. (See Ex. 2, pp. 2-3; see also Ex. 4, copy of savingjudicialwatch.org
homepage). To vindicate themselves, Defendants are anxious to move this matter through
discovery and final disposition. Further delay is prejudicial to Defendants’ ability to prepare a
defense to this claim.
WHEREFORE, for all of the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the
Court DENY Klayman’s Motion for another extension.

LARRY KLAYMAN’S FREEDOM WATCH FILES
ANTITRUST COMPLAINT AGAINST OPEC
CHARGING USE OF OIL AS FORM OF ECONOMIC
TERRORISM

PRESS CONFERENCE

Date: Monday, June 9, 2008
Time: 12 noon
Place: Venezuelan Consulate
In Front of Building
1101 BRICKELL AVENUE, MIAMI
(Monday, June 9, 2008). Larry Klayman, the founder of
Freedom Watch, and former U.S. Department of Justice
Antitrust Division prosecutor who helped break-up AT&T in
the early 1980’s, today will announce the filing of an antitrust
lawsuit for price fixing, market division and other unlawful
anticompetitive restraints on trade by OPEC, which is
comprised of members, such as Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela,
and Arab states on the U.S. State Department’s list of
certified terrorist nations.
The complaint, which was filed earlier today in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami,
alleges that OPEC has raised the price of oil to levels which
are intended to severely harm the economies of the United
States and its Western allies as a latent means of economic
terrorism by nation states who are bent on spreading
communism and radical Islam throughout the world. These

nation states are cleverly using the “economic” weapon
because other means have not produced the “desired”
results. This illegal conduct is also intended to influence the
2008 American presidential and congressional elections.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW COMPLAINT
At the press conference today, Mr. Klayman will explain in
detail the bases of these charges, which the U.S.
government, under both Republicans and Democrats, refuse
to confront because of complex relations with not only Hugo
Chavez of Venezuela, but the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia,
many of the other members of OPEC, as well as politically
powerful U.S. oil companies which are profiting handsomely
from OPEC’s price fixing and market division. These
anti-competitive acts have artificially raised the price of oil to
a record high of $140.00 per barrel and last Friday set the
stock market into a tailspin.

To Bring Justice To The Clintons
As We Retake Judicial Watch
“Judicial Watch earned its reputation in the 1990s
for lawsuits that ... allowed the group to depose
several Clinton officials.
But it’s largely been out of the news since Klayman
left Judicial Watch — and filed a lawsuit against it.”
Washington Post, April 6, 2007

After ten years of success...
in fighting government and legal corruption at Judicial Watch,
which I conceived of and founded, I left the public interest
watchdog in 2003 to run for the United States Senate. The
person who later assumed control of Judicial Watch – the
current president Tom Fitton – has misused the organization
for his own ends, improperly dissipating and squandering
donor monies and turning the group into a very bad joke,
which mostly boasts of the appeals it is forced to take
following a string of defeats since I left.
As a result of this damage, in order to save Judicial Watch, I
have sued Fitton. See www.SavingJudicialWatch.org. In a
landmark victory, the court in my case ruled that, if

successful, I can retake control of this once great
organization. Given the corruption of Hillary and Bill Clinton,
and their plan to retake control of the White House in 2008, a
renewed and powerful Judicial Watch – the People’s Justice
Department – can come none too soon.
Many supporters have given generously to this noble goal of
“liberating” Judicial Watch from the clutches of Tom Fitton
and his ethically challenged “yes men” on his Board of
Directors. While my case progresses, we must take
immediate action against corrupt politicians and others such
as Hillary and Bill Clinton.
Now, poised to win our case against Fitton and retake
Judicial Watch, I have created a legally separate “twin” public
interest group, using the trademark Freedom Watch, to
rekindle my corruption fighting efforts without wasting any
time. I, and those who I have brought into Freedom Watch to
assist me, will not wait until Judicial Watch is liberated. We
will begin the task of holding the Clintons and others of their
ilk accountable under our rule of law, now! Once we retake
the organization, we will then combine the two for an even
stronger public interest mission – to fight government and
legal corruption domestically (through Judicial Watch) and
spread freedom throughout the world (through Freedom
Watch).
As you may know from reading my complaint, when I left
Judicial Watch, Fitton gutted the organization, shutting down
virtually every regional office, even closing the organization’s
radio and television shows. The real talent of Judicial Watch,
the regional directors I had hired and who were loyal to me
and you, were fired – so no one could challenge Fitton and
his minions of “yes men.” Now I have reassembled this
“Dream Team” along with talented and dedicated
professionals who are committed to me, you and the
“American way.”
One of our first tasks is to finally bring justice to the Clintons.
To do this Freedom Watch and I have acquired a new client,
former New York Post freelance journalist and reporter,
Jarred Stern, whose livelihood was ruined at the hands of Bill
and Hillary. This case represents the biggest legal threat to
the Clintons, since the time I successfully sued them as
Judicial Watch president, over a decade ago. Read about the
case at www.FreedomWatchUSA.org
So, my friends and fellow supporters, the “Dream Team” is
back, and it is in business once again to hold Hillary and Bill

So, after spending $66 to fill up his Cadillac CTS sedan, Mr. Klayman,
a lawyer and conservative gadfly, filed a federal lawsuit here on
Monday accusing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries of price fixing.
“It’s now quite obvious that what they’re doing is intentional,” he said. “What they’re
trying to do is bring Western economies to their knees. It’s extremely clever.”
Mr. Klayman said OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela in particular hoped to
extract concessions from the United States by highlighting America’s energy
vulnerabilities. With Democrats likely to benefit on Election Day, he said, he sued, arguing

Mr. Klayman, 56, made a name for himself as the founder of Judicial Watch, a
conservative group that filed at least 18 suits against the Clinton administration in the
1990s contending cover-ups. More recently, he sued Vice President Dick Cheney,
demanding the release of records of his energy group. The Supreme Court backed up
executive privilege in the case.
This time, Mr. Klayman has more friends on the left than the right. Last month, House
Democrats passed a bill to allow the government to sue OPEC for conspiring to
manipulate the world oil prices. Many Republicans have avoided such an action.
Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, warned suits against OPEC
could inspire harsh retaliation that “may even limit the availability of gasoline to the
United States.”

Mr. Klayman said he was not surprised by the response. In his view, the government has

SAVING JUDICIAL WATCH - A NATIONAL TREASURE!
Cleaning Up Corruption From Within My "Own" Organization

In 1994, almost twelve years ago, I conceived of and founded
Judicial Watch to be the nation's "True Independent Counsel."

In 2003, I left Judicial Watch to run for the U.S. Senate in Florida. My idea was to take the
concept of Judicial Watch right inside the government itself, and like a Trojan Horse, fight
corruption from within.
Now, I face an even bigger challenge -- Saving Judicial Watch! After I left Judicial Watch, we
were betrayed by those who we had trusted to lead the organization. As explained in a
complaint that I was forced to file, they lied to donors and supporters, misused their monies,
failed to honor their agreement with me, and disparaged my name and reputation, all in a
selfish power grab. And since I left, the energy, creativity and success of the organization
has dwindled down to almost nothing, with one defeat after another in cases that I had filed
to clean up corruption in government and the legal systems.
Not only have the donors and supporters of Judicial Watch been served badly, but the
financial condition of Judicial Watch has worsened to the point where, if this keeps up, there
will be no Judicial Watch in two or four years. The current leadership is effectively writing
checks to itself, until the considerable monies which we previously raised to clean up
corruption run dry.
I thus have been forced to step in to save "my baby," the only public interest group that,
without fear, had the guts to do what was right for the American people. Read the complaint
posted on this website and please support me in Saving Judicial Watch. We have too many
good things to accomplish together, in bringing our country back to honest and decent
government, to let Judicial Watch be killed by those who would use it for their own personal
agenda.
I need your support to save Judicial Watch for you and other supporters! The country needs
a forceful and ethical Judicial Watch to keep government and the legal system honest!
Sincerely,
