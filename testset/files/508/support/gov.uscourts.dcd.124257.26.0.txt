v.
JUDICIAL WATCH, INC., et al.,
Defendants.

MOTION FOR SHORT ADDITIONAL SEVEN DAY EXTENSION OF TIME TO
RESPOND TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL
Plaintiff, Larry Klayman, moves this honorable court for an order of seven additional
business days to respond to the above styled motion, as Plaintiff, Larry Klayman, has
been preoccupied with the convalescence of his wife and taking her to various physicians.
No prejudice will result to any party and this is the last request for an extension of time,
as his wife has been very ill. Plaintiff has contacted Defendants counsel who is on
vacation and is awaiting a response.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests an additional seven business days, or until and
including June 19, 2008 to respond.

Respectfully submitted,
s/Larry Klayman__________
