'SUMMARY OF FACTS
Plaintiff Shirley Schumacher (“Schumacher”) was employed at Fairfield Resorts
or its predecessor for approximately five and one half years. At the time of her
termination she was sixty-three years old. (Schumacher Amended Complaint
(“Complaint”) at ¶ 5,)
Schumacher complained to Fairfield employees Lemlar and Coppa that her
supervisor Joseph Hutnick (“Hutnick”) had called her a “cunt” and“bitch” Both Lemlar
and Coppa reported to Hutnick what Schumacher had told them. (Deposition of Shirley
Schumacher (“Schumacher Deposition”), p.88 attached hereto as Exhibit B) Before
Schumacher left for her scheduled vacation Hutnick told her that when she returned that
she would no longer be manager. (Schumacher Deposition, p. 106) Schumacher went to
Florida for vacation but was unable to relax and became more depressed over the
demeaning incidents with Hutnick. Consequently, she quit her vacation early and
returned to Rhode Island where she sought the care of her physician Dr. James D. Gloor.
Dr. Gloor began treating Schumacher for stress that she contributed to her
hostile work environment. (Deposition of Dr. James D. Gloor (“Gloor Deposition”) pp 9 13. Dr. Gloor provided Schumacher with a disability certificate indicating that she could
not work from February 11, 2004 through April 11, 2004. (Exhibit A, Schumacher
Affidavit (“Affidavit” ¶ 3 Exhibit, 2)
Schumacher provided this Disability Certificate to her employer Fairfield
Resorts, Inc (“Fairfield”). (Exhibit A, Schumacher Affidavit, ¶ 3 ) She also contacted Jan
Weber, Leave and Disability Coordinator at Fairfield to notify her that she would be

requiring a leave of absence. ( Schumacher Deposition, p. 97) Fairfield placed
Schumacher on leave as of February 11, 2004 (Exhibit A, Schumacher Affidavit,

¶ 4,

Exhibit 3)
Core in a letter dated February 25, 2004 advised Schumacher that her medical
leave entitlements would run concurrently with any approved disability absence. That if
her Short term disability was denied she would have seven (7) days to provide her
medical Certification. (Affidavit,

¶ 5, Exhibit 4)

On February 26, 2004 Schum acher contacted Core, Inc. (“Core”) to tell it that she
was not making application to Core for short term -disability that she had elected instead
to receive Temporary Disability Insurance (“TDI”) through the policy provided by the
State of Rhode Island because she would receive more money. (Schumacher Deposition,
pp. 130-131); (Affidavit,

¶ 6, Exhibit 5)

Schumacher had no further contact with Core until she contacted it on April 30,
2004, (Affidavit, ¶ 9, exhibit 5) that it was Fairfield and not Core who notified her that
her FMLA leave had been denied. (Affidavit, ¶1 1, Exhibit 7)
On May 6, 2004 Schumacher contacted Core by telephone to appeal her denial
and was advised of the appeal process. (Affidavit,¶ 12, E xhibit 5) Schumacher submitted
her appeal to Core. (Affidavit, ¶ 13 Exhibit 8) It was denied because it was due April 26.
2004 and therefore out of time. (Schumacher Affidavit,

¶ 14, Exhibit 9)

ARGUMENT
Schumacher Can Establish that Core is an employer for purposes of
the FMLA
Schumacher is pursuing her Employment Discrimination and Family Medical Leave claims
under both the burden- shifting method of proof outlined in McDonnell-Douglas
- v. Green, 411
U.S. 792 (1973), Texas Dep’t of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981) and the mixedmotive analysis standards articulated in Price Water House v. Hopkins,
490 U.S. 228 (1989),
Desert Palace v. Costa, 590 U.S. 90 (2003). The Plaintiff may elect to proceed simultaneously on
both fronts and the trial court, at the appropriate time in the litigation, will channel the case into
one format or the other Fernandez v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 581 (1st. Cir.
1999).
Fairfield retained Core as its agent to evaluate request by employees for benefits under the
Family Medical leave Act (“FMLA”) and the Rhod e Island Parental and Family medical leave
Act. (“PFMLA”) (Memorandum in Support of Core’s Motion for Summary Judgment
(“Memorandum”) at 5) Core is within the scope of the FMLA definition of employer because it
acted in the interest of Fairfield. See 29U. S.C. § 2611 (4) (A)(ii)(I) (defining the term
“employer” to include'' any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer.

Core interfered with Schmacher’s FMLA and PFMLA entitlement
Core argues that it properly denied Schumacher’s FMLA entitlement based on her failure
to submit a completed FMLA Medical Certification Form. (Memorandum at 1 1)
That therefore, Schumacher cannot establish a prima facie claim of interference because she
failed to show that she was entitled to FMLA leave (Memorandum at 13).

Core interfered with Schumacher’s FMLA and PFMLA entitlements in two ways. First,
by informing Fairfield that it had denied her application for FMLA protected leave and secondly,
denying her appeal. Schumacher
Schumacher justifiably believed that Fairfield was processing her FMLA application
based upon Fairfield’s statements and conduct. The notice to Schumacher from Core made in it’s
letter of February 25, 2004 did little to explain what exactly Schumacher was required to do
regarding her FMLA leave since she did not make application for short term benefits to Core and
therefore her application for Short -Term disability benefits was not denied. Schumacher’s contact
with Core on February 26,2004 did nothing to clarify what was required of Schumacher and she
heard nothing more from Core. Subsequent to Schumacher’s call to Core all the signals
Schumacher received regarding her FMLA leave came from Fairfield not from Core. Schumacher
had no further contact with Core until she contacted it on April 30, 2004 concerning her denial of
FMLA leave and termination by Fairfield.
Core and Fairfield provided no information to Schumacher to suggest that she would be
subject to termination and denied her FMLA entitlement if she did not make application for FMLA
leave to Core. Moreover, Fairfield did and said nothing to suggest to Schumacher that by
cooperating with Fairfield regarding her FMLA application she would be jeopardizing h er
entitlement to FMLA protected leave and subject to termination. Core and Fairfield cannot now
justify denying Schumacher her FMLA entitlement and terminating her employment for failing to
make application for FMLA leave and not providi ng Medical Certification to Core. Fairfield
acknowledged Schumacher’s application for FMLA leave, provided her with the Medical
Certification Forms to make her application and directed Schumacher to return these forms back to
Fairfield.

''An employer who by his silence misled an employee concerning the employee’s
entitlement to family leave might, if the employee reasonably relied and was harmed as a result, be
estopped to plead the defense of ineligibility to the employee’s claim of entitlement to family
leave. Dormeyer v. Comerica Bank-Illinois, 223 F.3d 579, 582 (7th Cir. 2000)
Here, Core did not notify Schumacher that her FMLA leave entitlement had been denied
because it mailed the April 20, 2004 letter to the wrong address. (Affidavit, ¶1 1, Exhibit 6)
Schumacher submitted an appeal (Affidavit, exhibit 8) her appeal was denied because it was not
submitted within the time frame designated in the letter of denial that she did not receive.
(Affidavit, ¶ 15, Exhibit 9) Core’s actions denied Schumacher a fair opportunity to have her appeal
objectively reviewed and thereby interfered with her FMLA and PFMLA entitlement.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE DENIED IN THIS CASE
Schumacher has shown there are genuine issues of material facts in dispute that would
preclude summary judgment.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons Core's request for summary judgment should be d enied.

Respectfully submitted,
Plaintiff Shirley Schumacher
