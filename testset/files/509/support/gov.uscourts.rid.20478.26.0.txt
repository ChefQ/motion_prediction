MEMORANDUM OF CORE. INC. LN SUPIPORT
OF ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant CORE, Inc. ("CORE") moves pursuant to F.R.C.P.
56(b) for summary
judgment dismissing with prejudice d l counts in plaintiffs amended complaint against it.

I. FACTS

Faifield Resorts, Inc. (TairF~eld")is a corporation engaged in the sale of

timeshare vacations. Statement of Undisputed Facts, ¶ 1. Plaintiff Shirley Shumacher was
employed by Fairfield and its predecessor for approximately five-and-a-hdf years.

Id.at ¶ 2.

Fairfield retained CORE at relevant times to evaluate requests by employees for leave pursuant
to the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Rhode Island Parental and Family Medical Leave
Act ("Leave").

at ¶ 3. Shumacher was not employed by CORE and never performed any

services on behalf of CORE.

at 14. Apart from determining requests fox Leave benefits,

CORE had no control over the terms and conditions of the employment of Shumacher or of any

other Fairfield employee.

Id.at

3. CORE had no authority to discipline or terminate

Shumacher or any other Fairfield employee.

Id.

Page 4 of 21

On or about February 19,2004, CORE was notified that Shumacher requested a

leave of absence from Fairfield.

Id.at ¶ 5. CORE then reviewed Fairfield's employment records

to determine whether Shumacher was eligible for Leave.

Td.at q[ 6. CORE determined that she

had worked 1,224 hours in the twelve-months preceding the first day of her leave, which was
less than the minimum hours required by the FMILA.

Id.

CORE notified Fairfield of its determination and requested that it confirm
Shumacher's hours.

Id.at q 7. CORE advised Fairfield that if it did not receive the requested

information within two business days, Shumacher would be deemed eligible for Leave.

Id.

CORE received no response from FairFeld to its request to verify Shumacher's
hours.

Id.at ¶ 8.

Leave.

Id.

Therefore, on February 25,2004, CORE deemed Shumacher eligible for

That same day, CORE wrote Shumacher informing her that she was eligible for

Leave.

Id.at P 9. That letter also stated,
You are under no further obligation to provide c h i d
documentation for FMLA as long as your absence is being
reviewed for or is approved for short term disability
benefits. If your short-term disability is not approved for
the full length of your absence, the attached certification
form must be completed by your physician and returned to
CORE within 7 business days of the STD decision.

Id. A Family and Medical Leave Act ("TMLA") Certification form to be completed by
Shumacher and her health cm provider and returned to CORE was enclosed with CORE'S
February 25" letter.

Id.

On February 26,2004, Shumacher called a CORE representative. Id.at 110. She

advised that she had been approved to receive disability benefits from the State of Rhode Island
and that she did not want CORE to process her claim for short-term disability ("STD") benefits.

Id. Shumacher received Temporary Disability hsurance ('TDI") benefits from the State of
Rhode Island during the period of her absence from Fairfield.
benefits for a total of 26 weeks.

Id.at 11 1.

She received TDI

Id.

On March 8,2004, CORE closed Shumacher's STD claim.

Id.at P 12. Pursuant

to CORE'S policy, as explained to Shumacher in the February 25' comspondence, Shumacher

was therefore required to submit the completed FMLA Certification form to CORE within seven

business days.

Id.
Shumacher failed to complete or return the FMLA Certification form to CORE as

required. Id, at 'jI 13. Consequently, CORE denied Shumacher's request for Leave benefits,
effective March 30,2004.

Id.

On April 20,2004, CORE advised both Shumacher and Fai5eld that

Shumacher's request for Leave had been denied. Id,at 114. The April 20'~letter to Shumacher

also stated, "You may request administrativereview of this decision by submitting the request in
writing to COFtE, along with any substantiating information. Our office must receive the q u e s t

via fax or mail on or before 4/26/2004.''

Id.(emphasis in original).

Shumacher had no further communication with CORE until May 14,2004, when

CORE received, via facsimile, an appeal by Shurnacher from the denial of her request for Leave.
Id. at q 15. Included with the appeal were a copy of an E;MLA Certification form, signed by
-

James D. GIoor, M.D.,and a document entitled Physician's Statement of Fitness-for-Duty

Release ("Release"). Id, The Release, signed by Dr. Glwr, stated that Shumacher was not
"physically and mentally fit to return to work."

Page 6 of 21

On May 25,2004, CORE wrote Shumacher advising her that the denial of her
leave was being upheld because her "appeal request was received after the allowable time
frame."

Id.at 'J[ 16.
On or about September 21,2004, Shumacher filed a Charge of Discrimination

("Charge") against Faifield with the b o d e Island Commission for Human Rights and the Equal
Opportunity Commission.

Id.at ¶ 17. The Charge alleged that Fairfield had discriminated

against Shumacher on the basis of sex and age. &
I The Charge did not name or contain any

allegations against CORE.

a Subsequent to the May 25n letter, CORE had no further contact

with Shumacher until it was served with the complaint in this case.

Id.

11. ISSUES

I) Is CORE an Tmployer" of Shumachex subject to the statutes upon which her
amended complaint is based?
2) Did CORE properly deny Shumacher's leave request based on her failure to

submit a completed medical certification form?
3) Did CORE retaliate against Shumacher in violation ofher FMLA rights?
111. ARGUMENT

Shumacher has pled counts under numerous statutes governing the employment
relationships: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VE'), the Age Discrimination in

Employment Act ("'ADEA"),the FMLA, the Rhode Island Fair EmpIoyment Practices Act
(TEPA"), the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act of 1990 ("RICRA") and the Rhode Island Parental

and Family Medical Leave Act ("PFMLA"). Shumacher also pled counts for violation of public
policy, "breach of the express and implied understanding and agreement between the defendant's

[sic) and the plaintiff' and estoppel, all of which are based on the employment relationship.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 7 of 21

Shumacher also moved to file an amended complaint that added a count for retaliation in
violation of Title VII and the FMLA, which she fded JuIy 12,2006.' Shurnacher has pled each

of her counts against both Fairfield and CORE.
Shumacher admits, however, that she was never employed by CORE. Shumacher

was employed exclusively by Fairfield. Fairfield hired CORE as the third-party administrator for
employee Leave requests and STD benefits. The statutes on which Shumacher relies prohibit
unlawful conduct by an "employer,"as that term is defined in each statute. CORE, as third-party

administrator to F-eld,

is not within the scope of any of those definitions. As such, all counts

against CORE should be dismissed.

A.

All Counts Apainst CORE Should Be Dismissed Because It Was Not
Shumacher's Emplover.

1. Count One: Title VII

In Count One, Shurnacher alleges that "defendant's [sic] have violated Title VD
by discriminating against plaintiff' and that she has suffered damages "as a result of defendant's

purposeful discriminatory practices

. . .." Amended Complaint at 'j[ (f 19,21. It appears that

Shurnacher has dIeged conduct against only one defendant, notwithstanding that she has named
both Fairfield and CORE as defendants and has failed to differentiate between them in her

statement of claims. Because CORE did not employ Ms. Shumacher, it appears that.FairfieIdis

the one "defendant" identified by her in Count One.
Moreover, Shurnacher did not name CORE in her administrative charge jointly
filed with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Nghts ("'IUCHR) and the Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). See_ Amended Complaint at Ex. A. A

On February 13,2006, plaintiff filed a motion to amend her complaint and attached a copy of
her proposed amended complaint as Exhibit A. On March 1,2006, the Court granted plaintiffs
motion to amend. Plaintiff failed to file her amended complaint until July 12,2006, however.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 8 of 21

plaintiff is required to exhaust available administrative remedies by faling a timely charge with

the EEOC before pursuing a Title VII claim in court. Noviello v. Citv of Boston, 398 F.3d 76,
85 (1" Cir. 2005). A party that is not named in a plaintiffs administrative charge may not

subsequently be sued in federal court for an alleged violation of Title VU. Russell v. Enternrise
Rent-a-Car Co. of Rhode Island, 160 F. Supp. 2d 239,253 (D.R.I. 2001).
Finally, Title VII prohibits only unlawful employment practices engaged in by an
"employer," 42 U.S.C. 9 2000e-2(a). Because CORE was not Shumacher's "employer," it

cannot be held liable for a violation of Title VIZ. $ee Crawford v. West New Jersey Health SYS.,
847 F. Supp. 1232, 1236 (D.N.J. 1994) (dismissing plaintiffs claims under Title VII and the

ADEA against two entities named in addition to plaintiff's employer because "plaintiff neither
alleges that these related entities were her employers, nor that they acted as agents by rna[kingJ
the final decisions regarding employment matters" (~uothgOdriozola v. Sumrior Cosmetic

Distribs., Inc., 531 F. Supp. 1070, 1075-76 (D.P.R. 1982))). Therefore, Count One of
Shumacher's amended complaint should be dismissed as to CORE.
2. Count Two: ADEA

Shumacher alleges in Count Two that "defendant's" [sic] improperly based its

decision "to demote and subsequently terminate the plaintiff from her empIoyment . .. on age in
violation of ADEA." Amended Complaint at q[ 23. As in Count One, Shumacher only refers to a
single defendant, which would appear to be her employer, Fairfield.
As a prerequisite to filing her ADEA claim in court, Shumacher was required to

exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC. $ee 29 U.S.C. 5 626(d)

("Nocivil action may be commenced by an individual under this section until 60 days after a
charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 9 of 21

Commission7');Parisi v. Boeinn Co., 400 F.3d 583,585 (8' Cir. 2005) ("Exhaustion of
administrative remedies is a condition precedent to the filing of an action under the ADEA in
federal court"). Shumacher fded no such claim against CORE with the EEOC.

Finally, the ADEA only prohibits unlawful conduct by an "employer." See 29

U.S.C. 5 623(a)(stating that it shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any
individual based on age with respect to the terms or conditions of his or her employment); 29
U.S.C. 3 630(b) (defining an "employer" as "a person engaged in an industry affecting

commerce who has twenty or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more

calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year"). Because CORE was not
Shumacher's employer, as a matter of law she is precluded from maintaining a cause of action
under the ADEA against it. Crawford, 847 F. Supp. at 1236. Therefore, Count Two should be

dismissed with respect to CORE.

3. Count Three: FMLA

In Count Three,Shumacher alleges that "defendants"- plural, in contrast to her
other use of "defendant or defendant's" in other counts -violated her rights under the FMLA
by denying her request for medical leave and summarily terminating her. Amended Complaint
at 'j[ 26. The FMLA prohibits an ""employer"from interfering with its employees' rights

thereunder. 29 U.S.C. 5 2615. As argued above, however, CORE did not employ Shumacher.
Therefore, Count Three should be dismissed with respect to CORE.
4. Count Four: FEPA

Shumacher alleges in Count Four that ""defendant's"[sic] violated the FEPA and
that she has suffered damages as a result of "defendant's purposeful discriminatorypractices."

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 10 of 21

Amended Complaint at q[ [I29,30. Again, it appears that this Count refers to a single defendant,

to the exclusion of CORE.
Moreover, Shumacher failed to name CORE as a party to her administrative

charge filed with the RICHR.

Amended Complaint at Ex. A. The FEPA, however, requires

a plaintiff to exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a charge with the RICHR before filing
a complaint in court. Power v. City of Providence, 582 A.2d 895,899 @.I. 1990). Where a

plaintiff fails to comply with the exhaustion requirement, the defendant is entitled to summary

judgment in its favor. Paulo v. Coolev, Inc., 686 F. Supp. 377,382 fD.R.1. 1990)("Because
plaintiff has failed to comply with the statutory prerequisites to commencing a judicial action
under the Mode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, this Court holds that defendant is
entitled to summary judgment as to any claims arising under that Act").
Finally, the FEPA, like its federal counterparts, applies only to conduct by an
"employer." R.I. Gen. Laws 5 28-5-6(7)(i) (defining an "employex" as "the state and all

political subdivisions of the state and any person in this state employing four (4) or more
individuals, and any person acting in the interest of an employer directly or indirectly"). CORE

did not employ Shumacher and does not meet the statutory definition in the FEPA. See id.
Therefore, summary judgment should be entered in favor of CORE with respect to Count Four.
5. Count Five: RICRA

Count Five of Shurnacher's amended complaint alleges that ""defendant's[sic]

violated the RTCRA [Rhode Island Civil Rights Act] and that she has suffered damages as a

result of "defendant's purposefd discriminatory practices." Amended Complaint at q[ 32.
RICRA, which is the only statute pled by Shumacher that prohibits conduct by individuals other

tban an "employer," essentially protects individuals from discrimination in the making of

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

contracts.

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 11 of 21

R.I. Gea. Laws 9 42-1 12-1. See also Vingi v. Rho& Island, 991 F.Supp. 44,53

(D.R.I.1997)(holdingthat RICRA '$mhibits discrimination in the making of contracts on the
basis of gender"). Shumacher has not alleged that CORE has impaired any of the rights
enumerated in RICRA. Therefore, COFtE is dso entitled to summary judgment on Count Five,

Shumacher's claim under that statute. See Socha v. Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers, 883 F. Supp.
790,807 (D.R.I. 1995) (holding that where plaintiff "fails to allege rn impairment of any of the
rights listed in [RICRA]," a claim under that statute must be dismissed).

6. Count Six: PFMLA
Shumacher alleges in Count Six that "Defendant's termination or constructive
termination of the plaintiff violates the laws of the Rhode Island ParentaI and Medical Leave
Act." Amended Complaint at P 35. Although Shumacher does not state to which of the two
defendants she refers in this count, it is undisputed that Fairfield, not CORE,terminated her

empIoyment. Therefore, summary judgment shouId be granted to CORE with respect to Count
Six.
7. Count Seven: Public Policy

In Count Seven, Shumacher alleges that "Defendant's termination or constructive

termination of plaintiffs employment on account of her work related injury was a violation of
the public policy of Rhode Island." Again, Shumacher refers to only a single defendant, which

she fails to identify. Because Shumacher's employment was terminated solely by Fairfield,
however, it is apparent that the allegations in this count do not apply to CORE.
Moreover, it is well established that Rhode Island adheres to the doctrine of
employment at-will, under which an employee that is hired for an indefinite term "is terminable

at the will of either party at any time for any reason or for no reason at all." Roy v. Woonsocket

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 12 of 21

Instit. for Sav., 525 A.2d 915,917 (R.I. 1987). Courts will not create rights for employees in

derogation of this rule based on generalized notions of public policy that have not been expressly

codified.

Pacheco v. Raytheon Co., 623 A.2d 444,465 (R.I. 1993)("1t is not the role of the

courts to create rights for persons whom the LegisIature has not chosen to protect"). Therefore,

summary judgment should be granted to CORE with respect to Count Seven.
8. Count Eight: Breach of Contract

Shumacher alleges in Count Eight that "Defendant's wrongful acts constitute .. .
a breach of the express and implied terms and conditions of the understanding and agreement

between the defendant's and the p1,aintiffas employer and employee." Amended Complaint at 'l[
41. As in several previous counts, Count Eight thus refers to only a single employer. CORE had
no "express or implied

.. . understanding or agreement" with Shurnacher regarding her

employment, the terms of which were controlled exclusively by Faideld.

In addition, consistent with the at-will employment doctrine, Rhode Island does
not recognize implied contracts of employment.

See Neri v. Ross Simons, Inc., 897 A.2d 42,47-

48 (R.I. 200B)(holding that any policy that is subject to unilateral revision by the employer

cannot give rise to a breach of contract claim). Therefore, summary judgment should be granted

to CORE with respect to Count Eight.
9. Count Nine: Personnel Manual

Count Nine of Shumacher's amended complaint alleges that "Defendants should

be estopped to deny their promises and commitments to the plaintiff to follow the policies and

procedures set forth in their personnel manual . . . ." Amended Complaint at 144. CORE made
no "promises or commitments" to Shumacher regarding the terms and conditions of her

employment with Fairfield and was not a party to the personnel manual, which was provided to

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 13 of 21

her by Fairfield in connection with her employment. In any event, an employee handbook that is
subject to unilateral revision by an employer cannot serve as the basis for a breach of contract

claim under Rhode Island law.

w,897 A.2d at 42. Therefore, summary judgment should be

granted to CORE with respect to Count Nine.

10. Count Ten: Retaliatory ~ermination*
Plaintiffs amended complaint, which was filed July 12,2006, contains an

additional count, Count Ten, in which she alleges, "Defendant retaliated against the plaintiff by
terminating her employment and denying her employment opportunities" on the basis of her
protected conduct.

Amended Complaint at Ex. A, R 47. Although Shumacher does not state

to which of the two defendants she refers in this count, it is undisputed that Fairfield, not CORE,
terminated her employment. Therefore, to the extent that Shumacher is permitted to proceed

under her amended complaint, summaryjudgment should be granted to CORE with respect to
Count Ten.

B.

CORE Properly Denied Shumacher's Leave Reauest Based on Her Failure to
Submit a Completed FMLA Medical Certification Form
CORE anticipates that Shumacher may argue that, even though it was not her

employer, CORE is liable to her under Count Three,for violation of the FMLA. Shumacher may

argue that CORE is within the scope of the FMLA3definition of "employer" because it acted "in
the interest of' her actual employer, Fairfield.

29 U.S.C.9 2611(4)(A)(ii)(I) (defMng the

The complaint originally fled by Shumacher contained only nine counts. Although plaintiff
was granted leave to amend her complaint, however, which she filed on July 12,2006.
Shumacher also pled a claim under the PFMLA in Count Six of her complaint- Io Count Six,
she alleges that the "Defendant's termination or constructive termination of the plaintiff violates
the laws of the m o d e Island Parental and Medical Leave Act." As discussed above, it is
undisputed that Fairfield, not CORE,terminated Shumacher's employment. Therefore,
Shumacher has not alleged any violation of the PFMLA against CORIE.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 14 of 21

term "employer" in the FMLA to include "any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the

interest of an employer"). Even if CORE is deemed to be an "employer" for purposes of the
FMLA, however, the court should grant summay judgment to it with respect to Count Three.

CORE advised Shumacher in a letter dated February 25,2004that her Leave
request was being processed in conjunction with her claim for STD benefits and, as a result, she

had "no obligation" to provide any documentation with respect to her Leave request, so long as
her STD claim remained pending. If her STD claim was not approved, the letter stated, she was
required to submit the medical certification form completed by her healthcare provider to CORE

within seven days. A copy of the form was provided to Shumacher with the Febmary 25'h

correspondence. Shortly thereafter, Shumacher contacted CORE and requested that it terminate
her claim for STD benefits. On March 8,2004, CORE closed its file on Shurnacher's STD
claim.

Notwithstanding the termination of her STD claim at her request, however,

Shumacher failed to return the completed FMLA Certification form as directed. The FMLA
provides:

.

An employer may require that a request for leave under .. this
title be supported by a certification issued by the health care
provider of the eligible employee or of the son, daughter, spouse,
or parent of the employee, as appropriate. The employee shall
provide, in a timely manner, a copy of such certification to the
employer.
29 U.S.C. $2613(a).

An employee who faih to provide her employer with a completed medical
certification form is not entitled to claim the rights contained in the FMLA. Ra~erv. Dade

Behrinn, Inc, 210 F.3d 776,778-79 (7* Cir. 2000)(affirming summary judgment in favor of
employer that terminated employee who failed to return FMLA medical certification form

completed by her health care provider); Urban v. Dolgencorr, of Texas, Inc., 393 F.3d 572,57677 (5h Cir. 2004) (vacating summary judgment e n t e ~ din favor of employee with respect to her

FMLA claim and granting summary judgment to employer based on employee's failure to
submit a medical certification form). Because Shumacher failed to provide a completed medical

certificationform to CORE, she is not entitled to the protection of the FMLA or the PFMLA, and
CORE properly denied her request for Leave.

1. Shumacher Has Not Established the Prima Facie Elements ofHer
Claim Against CORE for Interference with Her FMLA Rights
Shurnacher's claim against CORE under the FMLA must be analyzed using the

three-step McDonnell Dougtlas framework. Hodgens v. General Dvnamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151,
160-61 (lStCir. 1998). Under that framework, the employee bears the initial burden of
establishing a prima facie claim of unlawful interference with her rights under the FMLA.

at

160. If the employee meets her initial burden, the burden shifts to the employer to estabIish a

"legitimate,non-discriminatoryreason" for the adverse action. Td. If the employer proffers a
legally-suff~cientbasis for the action, the burden shifts back to the employee, who bears the

"ultimate burden of showing that the empIoyerYsstated reason for [the adverse action] was in
fact a pretext . .

. ."

at 161.

To establish a prima facie claim of interference with FMLA rights, a pIaintiff
must establish: "(I) that [slhe was entitled to FMLA leave, (2) that some adverse action by the

employer interfered with h[er] right to take FMLA leave, and (3) that the employer's action was
related to the exercise or attempted exercise of h[er] FMLA rights." Jones v. Denver Pub. Schls.,
427 F.3d 1315, 1319 (lothCir. 2005). Where the plaintiff fails m prove each of these elements,

summary judgment must be granted in favor of the defendant.

Id.at 1323, fn. 2.

Case 1:05-cv-00500-T-DLM

Document 26

Filed 07/17/2006

Page 16 of 21

As discussed above, Shurnacher failed to provide CORE with a medical

certification from her healthcare provider, as required by CORE!in accordance with the FMLA.

& 29 U.S.C.Q 2613(a). Because Shumacher failed to satisfy this mandatory requirement, she
was not entitled to leave under the FMLA. See Rager, 210 F.3d at 778-79; Urban, 393 F.3d at

576-77.As such, Shurnacher cannot establish the first element of her prima facie case of
interference with her FMLA rights a matter of law. Therefore, even if the Court concludes that

CORE is an "employer" of Shumacher for FMLA purposes, it should grant summary judgment
to CORE with respect to Count Three of Shumacher's amended complaint.

C.

CORE Did Not Retaliate Against Shumcher in Violation of Her FMLA
Rights.

Shumacher has also asserted a claim for retaliation under the FMLA.~In order to

prevail on her claim of retaliation, Shumacher must prove the prima facie elements of that claim.
Hodnens, 144 F.3d at 160-61. To establish a prima facie claim for retaliation in violation of the

FMLA, Shumacher must prove: (1) she engaged in a protected action under the FMLA; (2) she

suffered an adverse employment action; (3) there is a causal connection between her protected
activity and the employer's adverse employment action. CoIburn v. Parker Hmnifm/Nichols
Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325,336 (lS' Cir. 2005). If Shumacher cannot establish each of these

elements, CORE is entitled to summary judgment with respect to that claim. Orta-Castro v.

Merck. Sharp & Dohme Quimica P.R.,hc.,447 F.3d 105,112 (1'' Cir. 2006).
In this case, Shumacher was employed by Fairfield, which exclusively contl.olled
the terms and conditions of her ernpIoyment. h fact, Fairfield terminated Shumacher's

employment after the denial of her leave request. CORE, on the other hand, did not take any

Shumacher's dlegation that she was retaliated against in violation of the FMLA is in Count Ten
of her Amended Complaint. See fn. 1.

adverse action against Shumacher, as it had no ability or authority to affect her employment
status. Therefore, Shumacher cannot establish the second essential element of a prima facie case

of employment discrimination against COFtE.

D.

Because No Dis~utedIssues of Fact Exist, CORE Is Entitled to
Summary Judgment as a Matter of Law.

Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the standard for
ruling on a motion for summaryjudgment:
The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.

Summaryjudgment is only available when there is no dispute as to any material fact and only
questions of law remain. United States ex. rel. D'Arnbra Constr. Co.. hc.,24 F.Supp. 2d 218
(D.R.I. 1998). In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the court must view

the facts on the record and all inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving
party. Continental Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 370 (1st Cir. 1991), citing

Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46 (1st Cir. 1990).
To determine whether summaryjudgment is appropriate, ''the test is whether the
nonmovant has presented specific facts sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find in its favor."
Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corn., 963 F.Supp. 102,105 @.R.I. 1997). "When a motion for

summary judgment is directed against a party that bears the burden of proof, and the motion is

supported by facts that

. . .indicate a lack of proof to support that case, the nonmoving party is

obliged to proffer enough contrary evidence to establish that there is a genuine factual dispute
lrequiring a trial." "Unsupported allegations" or "promises that such evidence will be produced
at trial are insufficient" to allow the party to avoid summary judgment.

In this case, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. It is undisputed that
CORE did not employ Shumacher or exert any control or influence over the terms and conditions
of her employment. Furthermore, Shumacher does not dispute that she failed to provide a

medical certification form completed by her healthcare provider to CORE within the time
allowed, notwithstanding that CORE had advised her that the submission of that fom was a
condition of the approval of her leave. CORE'S denial of Shumacher's Leave request based on
her failure to submit is consistent with the F'MLA and the PFMLA. Therefore, the Court should
grant summary judgment to CORE with respect to all of the counts in Shurnacher's amended
complaint.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Shumacher's claims against CORE should be

dismissed with prejudice.
