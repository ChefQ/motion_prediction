DEFENDANTS' MOTION AND
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM
OF LAW FOR SANCTIONS AND AN
AWARD OF COSTS INCURRED IN
OPPOSING_PLAINTIFFS' MOTION
TO COMPEL AGAINST SIMPSON
THACHER & BARTLETT LLP

Defendants John L. Steffens, Gregory P. Ho, Spring Mountain Capital, G.P., LLC, Spring
Mountain Capital, LP, and Spring Mountain Capital, LLC ("Defendants") seek the imposition of
sanctions, and an award of costs in an amount to be determined at a hearing, against Plaintiffs
Daniel R. Goldenson, Suzanne K. Goldenson, SKG Partners, L.P. and SKG General Corp.
("Plaintiffs") for legal fees and expenses incurred by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP ("STB"),
and Defendants' counsel in this proceeding, Spears & Imes LLP, in defending against Plaintiffs'
motion to compel the production of documents by STB pursuant to a subpoena issued to STB by
Plaintiffs out of the United States District Court for the Southern District ofNew York ("Motion
to Compel").
I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs issued a Rule 45 subpoena to STB in the Southern District of New York in
October 2011, calling for production of an enormous volume of privileged materials relating to
STB's attorney-client relationship with certain Defendants. After STB made a timely objection
on grounds of privilege, Plaintiffs gave notice to STB in December 2011 of Plaintiffs' intention

Case 2:10-cv-00440-JAW Document 106 Filed 04/18/12 Page 2 of 11

PageID #: 1798

to abandon the subpoena. In February 2012, Plaintiffs made a document request to Defendants
seeking the same privileged materials directly from Defendants that they had previously sought
from STB. However, after a period of intense and acrimonious discovery disputes before this
Court in February 2012, Plaintiffs executed a 180 degree tum, commencing a subpoena
enforcement proceeding against STB in the District Court in New York and abandoned their
direct request to Defendants. In pursuing that course, Plaintiffs made misleading statements to
the District Court in New York and willfully disregarded an order of this Court. At a hearing
before the District Court in New York, that Court summarily dismissed Plaintiffs' Motion to
Compel.
Plaintiffs' conduct amounted to the kind of improper discovery tactics that warrant
sanctions under the law. Accordingly, Defendants seek the imposition of sanctions against
Plaintiffs, specifically an award of costs to Defendants for the legal fees and expenses incurred
by STB and Spears & Imes in connection with their mutual opposition to the Motion To Compel,
in an amount to be determined by this Court at a hearing.

II. FACTS 1
STB is a large international law firm with offices in New York City and other locations.
STB was retained by various Spring Mountain entities and affiliates ("Spring Mountain") in
December 2008 in the aftermath of, and in response to, the arrest of Bernard Madoff on
December 11, 2008, and the consequent public revelation of the large-scale fraud Madoff had
orchestrated. See SDNY Dkt. No. 20,

On October 24, 2011, Plaintiffs served on STB in New York City a Rule 45 subpoena
calling for the production of documents relating to STB's attorney-client relationship with Spring
Mountain. See Spears Decl. Ex. A. The two requests for documents set out in the subpoena read
as follows:
1.

All documents ... concerning your provision of professional legal services
to the investors of the Spring Mountain Partners QP I, LP (the "Fund"), or
to persons or entities having authority to obtain professional legal services
on behalf of the Fund or its investors, between December 1, 2008 and the
present; and

2.

All non-privileged documents ... arising out of your provision of legal
services to any of the following persons or entities, or to persons or
entitles having authority to obtain professional legal services on behalf of
the following persons or entities:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

John L. Steffens;
Gregory P. Ho;
Spring Mountain Partners QP 1, LP;
Spring Mountain Capital GP, LLC;
Spring Mountain Capital LP; or
Spring Mountain Capital, LLC,

between January 1, 2001 and the present, that relate to or reference J. Ezra
Merkin, Bernard Madoff, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, LLC,
Ascot Partners, L.P., the Ascot Fund, Ascot Fund Limited, Gabriel
Capital, L.P., the Gabriel Fund, Ariel Capital, L.P. or the Ariel Fund.
On November 7, 2011, STB objected to the subpoena in its entirety. See Spears Decl. Ex. B. On
December 8, 2011, Plaintiffs wrote to STB signaling Plaintiffs' intention to take no further action
with regard to the subpoena, but rather to make arguments at the trial of this proceeding
regarding STB's refusal to produce in response to the subpoena. See Spears Decl. Ex. C.
Two months later, on February 9, 2012, Plaintiffs issued to Defendants a Second Request
For The Production Of Documents And Things ("Second Request"). See Spears Decl. Ex. D.
Plaintiffs' Request No. 13 was clearly intended to fill in for their abandoned Rule 45 subpoena to

3

Case 2:10-cv-00440-JAW Document 106 Filed 04/18/12 Page 4 of 11

PageID #: 1800

STB, as Request No. 13 is strikingly similar to Request No. 1 of Plaintiffs' subpoena to STB.
Request No. 13 calls for:
All documents ... concerning communications occurring among or between
Spring Mountain and Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett LLP regarding the
transactional, structural, regulatory and litigation issues for which Spring
Mountain sought their legal advice on behalf of Spring Mountain's investors
between December 1, 2008 and the Present.
On February 28, 2012, Defendants moved before this Court for a protective order striking
Requests No. 1-10 and 12 ofthe Second Request; but Defendants did not seek relief from the
Court with regard to Request No. 13. On March 12, Defendants made a timely formal objection,
to Request No. 13 on the grounds, among others, that it calls for documents protected by the
attorney-client privilege and/or the work product privilege. See Spears Decl. Ex. E.
On March 6, 2012, before receiving Defendants' objection to Request No. 13, and
knowing only that it was not a subject of Defendants' motion for a protective order, Plaintiffs
filed their Motion To Compel in the District Court in New York, seeking to enforce the October
24, 2011 subpoena to STB. Prior to filing that Motion, Plaintiffs did not contact Defendants to
discuss Plaintiffs' intention to commence the subpoena enforcement action against STB, and in
particular (1) the overlap between Request No. 1 in the subpoena to STB and Request No. 13 in
Plaintiffs' Second Request, and (2) the overlap between Request No.2 in the subpoena to STB
and all of the Requests Plaintiffs had addressed to Defendants in discovery.
On March 20, 2012, STB filed its opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel, a 25-page
memorandum of law, see SDNY Dkt. No. 19, accompanied by declarations from a partner at
STB, the General Counsel of Spring Mountain, and counsel for Defendants in this action, see
SDNY Dkt. No. 20, No. 21, No. 22. The declaration from Defendants' counsel in this action
(undersigned counsel) informed the District Court in New York that (1) Plaintiffs had sought the
same privileged documents from Defendants directly in this action that they were seeking from
4

Case 2:10-cv-00440-JAW Document 106 Filed 04/18/12 Page 5 of 11

PageID #: 1801

STB in the subpoena enforcement proceeding; and (2) after Defendants had formally objected,
Plaintiffs had taken no further action. See SDNY Dkt. No. 22, ~~ 14-15.
On March 22, 2012, this Court conducted a hearing to address a large number of
discovery disputes, including Defendants' motion for a protective order relating to portions of
Plaintiffs' Second Request. During the four hours of argument and dialog with the Court at the
hearing, Plaintiffs never addressed Defendants' privilege objection to Request No. 13 in
Plaintiffs' Second Request or sought any relief from this Court relating to that Request. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Court denied Defendants' motion for a protective order regarding
portions of the Second Request, but the Court made clear that it expected Plaintiffs to limit the
materials they were seeking under the Second Request so that Defendants could make full
production in response by April 29. The Court ordered the parties to meet and confer by April 5
with respect to all of the materials Plaintiffs would be seeking under the Second Request, and to
submit letters to the Court by April 9 pointing out any disagreements regarding Defendants'
obligations under the Second Request. The Court also adjusted certain dates in its prior
Scheduling Order, including setting a new date for discovery cut off of May 7, 2012. 2

2

On March 28, the Court entered its Order formalizing the rulings it had made orally on March 22. See
Dkt. No. 98. Among other things, the Order provided:
I DIRECTED counsel for the parties to meet and confer, no later than AprilS, 2012, to narrow the
scope of the Second [Document Request] sufficiently to enable the defendants reasonably to
produce all documents responsive to that [Document Request], as narrowed, within 30 days of the
instant hearing date, or by April23, 2012. I further DIRECTED that, to the extent that any
dispute remains, the parties submit to me, by noon on April 9, 2012, nonargumentative letters not
to exceed five pages single-spaced per side. The plaintiffs shall describe how, in their view, they
have narrowed the Second [Document Request] sufficiently to make it possible that the defendants
can produce responsive documents by Apri123, 2012, and the defendants shall explain why, in
their view, that is not possible. I anticipate convening a teleconference during the week of April 9,
2012, to resolve any remaining dispute on that point.
(Emphasis on "all" added).

On March 26, 2012, in the District Court in New York, Plaintiffs filed their reply
memorandum to STB's opposition to Plaintiffs Motion To Compel, accompanied by a
declaration of Plaintiffs' counsel. In the declaration, after acknowledging that Plaintiffs had
served Defendants with the Second Request on February 9, 2012, and that the request "sought, in
part, the very same documents" that Plaintiffs were seeking to compel STB to produce in New
York, Plaintiffs' counsel made the following statements regarding developments in this Court
relating to Request No. 13 and Defendants' motion for a protective order:
[T]he Spring Mountain Defendants immediately moved for protection from this
request, which the [Plaintiffs] opposed. On March 22, 2012, the United States
District Court for the District of Maine denied the Spring Mountain Defendants'
motion, but declined to insert itself into the issue of privilege now pending before
this Court.
See Spears Decl. Ex G. These statements were inaccurate because Defendants had not sought a
protective order with regard to Request No. 13 in the Second Request, and consequently this
Court had not denied such a motion; and because this Court had said nothing at all at the March
22 hearing regarding the "issue of privilege ... pending before" the District Court in New York.
See Spears Decl. Ex. F.
In response to this Court's oral order on March 22 requiring the parties to meet and
confer regarding the Second Request, on March 27, 2012, Plaintiffs' counsel sent to Defendants'
counsel an email setting out "Plaintiffs' proposals for narrowing the scope of their Second
Document Request." The email addressed all ofthe Requests except No. 13, as to which counsel
stated: "We expect this request to be resolved in the Southern District ofNew York next week."
Spears Decl. Ex. H.
On April 2, 2012, Defendants, as Intervenors in the subpoena enforcement proceeding,
filed an opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel against STB. See SDNY Dkt. No. 37. In that
opposition, Defendants detailed the facts discussed herein, and argued that the proper venue for

PageID #: 1803

Plaintiffs' efforts to breach Defendants' attorney-client privilege was this Court, and not the
District Court in New York. On April3, Plaintiffs' counsel and Defendants' counsel appeared
before United States District Judge Barbara S. Jones in the District Court in New York. Upon
taking the bench, Judge Jones immediately informed the parties that she had spoken with this
Court earlier in the day, and that she and this Court agreed that the proper place for Plaintiffs to
seek to breach Defendants' privilege was before this Court; and accordingly she summarily
dismissed Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel against STB. Plaintiffs' counsel immediately
represented to Judge Jones in open court that this Court- the Court in Maine- knew about
Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel against STB in the District Court in New York and was fine with it.
See Spears Decl. Ex. H. Judge Jones repeated what she had said seconds before regarding her

telephone conversation with this Court, and stated again that Plaintiffs' Motion was dismissed.
In connection with Plaintiffs' Motion To Compel against STB, STB and Defendants'
counsel in this proceeding jointly incurred a substantial amount of fees and expenses.
Defendants are prepared to prove the amount of fees and expenses with particularity at a hearing.

III. ARGUMENT
"[T]he decision as to whether discovery sanctions are warranted and the choice of what
sanctions should be imposed are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court." US. v.
Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1, 30 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts have an

"inherent power" to sanction a party for misconduct in the course of a litigation, including
improper discovery tactics. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32,42 (1991); see also id. at 44
("A primary aspect of [a court's] discretion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for
conduct which abuses the judicial process."); id. at 50 (finding that a court "may safely rely on
its inherent power" to sanction a party even when there are no statutes or rules that specifically
reach the improper conduct at issue); In re Villa Marina Yacht Harbor, Inc., 984 F.2d 546, 548
7

Case 2:10-cv-00440-JAW Document 106 Filed 04/18/12 Page 8 of 11

PageID #: 1804

(1st Cir. 1993) (District Court has the "inherent power" to "fashion appropriate sanctions for
abuses of the judicial process"); Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co. v. Puerto Rico Ports Auth., 193 F.R.D.
26, 31 (D. Puerto Rico 2000) (sanctioning improper discovery conduct in the litigation and
invoking the court's "inherent powers that enable it to enforce standards of conduct during
discovery."); cf Bose BVv. Zavala, No. 09 Civ. 11360,2010 WL2733621, at *2 (D. Mass. July
8, 2010) (making reference to the "recent sanctions imposed under [Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure] 3 7 for the on-going abusive discovery tactics in this case").
Plaintiffs' actions in seeking to compel the production of privileged documents from STB
in New York rather than seeking the intervention ofthis Court were the kind of improper
discovery conduct that merits the imposition of sanctions and an award of costs to Defendants.
First, it was improper for Plaintiffs to commence the proceeding against STB at all.
Plaintiffs had given an unmistakable indication of intent to abandon the subpoena to STB and
had subsequently sought the very same documents directly from Defendants in this proceeding.
However, based upon Plaintiffs' motion practice before this Court in February, including the
resistance they encountered from Defendants and the resulting uncertainty as to how they would
fare before this Court, Plaintiffs elected to try their luck before a different court.
It is well-established that a party should pursue discovery available from other parties
before burdening non-parties to an action. See, e.g., Burns v. Bank ofAmerica, No. 03 Civ.
1685,2007 WL 1589437, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) ("Subpoenas under Rule 45 are clearly not

meant to provide an end-run around the regular discovery process under Rules 26 and 34. If
documents are available from a party, it has been thought preferable to have them obtained
pursuant to Rule 34 rather than subpoenaing them from a non-party witness [pursuant to Rule
45].") (emphasis added); Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC, 2011 WL 781198, at *4-*5

8

Case 2:10-cv-00440-JAW Document 106 Filed 04/18/12 Page 9 of 11

PageID #: 1805

(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 2011) (reversing order compelling production of subpoenaed documents
because "speculation that the non-parties ... may have relevant documents" was outweighed by
"the significant burden ... [the subpoena] placed on the non-parties" and stating that production
should be compelled "from a non-party only after . .. [the court has} reason to believe that the
documents sought from the non-party could not be obtained from the defendant") (emphasis in

original).
Plaintiffs flouted this well-established rule. Their pivot from this Court to the District
Court in New York was a transparent attempt to make an "end-run around the regular discovery
process" that was taking place in this Court. There was no legitimate reason for Plaintiffs to
abandon the track they were already on in this Court and burden STB with the Motion to Compel
in New York, particularly when they had already communicated to STB that they would not
pursue the subpoena in New York. Abruptly changing courts and switching their target, as
Plaintiffs did, was plainly an improper exercise in forum shopping that created unnecessary and
burdensome expense. Plaintiffs' commencement of proceedings against STB is deserving of
sanctions.
The manner in which Plaintiffs pursued those proceedings also warrants sanctions. The
Plaintiffs misstated the facts regarding the proceedings before this Court in the declaration they
filed with the District Court in New York. Supra at 6. This was a cynical and improper attempt
to exploit the New York Court's unfamiliarity with the proceedings in this case, by misstating
the procedural history and seeking to lead the New York Court to believe that this Court had
already rejected a privilege motion by Defendants and actually approved of Plaintiffs' efforts in
the New York Court. Further, Plaintiffs flagrantly disregarded and violated this Court's order to

9

Case 2:10-cv-00440-JAW Document 106 Filed 04/18/12 Page 10 of 11

PageID #: 1806

meet and confer with Defendants as to "all" of the documents they were seeking under the
Second Request.
In short, Plaintiffs' strategic ploy in bringing proceedings against STB in New York, and
the indefensible manner in which they pursued those proceedings, warrant the imposition of
sanctions.

IV.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court sanction
Plaintiffs and award Defendants costs, in an amount to be determined at a hearing, for the legal
fees and expenses incurred in opposing the Motion to Compel.
