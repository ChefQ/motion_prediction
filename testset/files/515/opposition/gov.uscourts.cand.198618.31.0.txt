MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

When Ohkubo starts contesting his own translation of a single-sentence
forum selection clause, and proper translation and construction of the entire
Investment Contract is at issue (Ohkubo Sur-Reply at 2:18-24), it is hard to imagine a
better argument in support of Defendants' argument that the Tokyo District Court is
the proper forum for the present dispute.

While we appreciate the point, the Court has been subjected to enough
briefing without the need for a sur-reply (or a sur-sur-reply in response). There is
nothing "new" about the language of the forum selection clause, or the importance of
Suzuki, the Investment Contract, or the Japanese Litigation. These are obvious issues
that were addressed in Defendants' opening papers. (See, e.g., Motion at 3:18-20;
8:20-22; 5:19-21).

Ohkubo is also missing the point (and/or intentionally misleading the
Court). The purpose of Defendants' Motion is to determine the proper forum for this
dispute. The burden is on the parties to identify the major issues in dispute so the
Court can determine the proper forum to resolve them. That is what Defendants have
done. Ohkubo, by contrast, is trying to engage in a battle of the declarations over who
supposedly drafted the Investment Contract, or about whether Ohkubo really speaks
English. Those are substantive issues which are more appropriate for trial. The point
at this stage is simply to identify them as issues, so the Court can determine the forum
best suited to address them.

For all of these reasons, we respectfully request that Ohkubo's
application be denied. To the extent the Court concludes otherwise, we will be
prepared to respond to the issues raised and, as necessary, provide additional evidence

at the hearing to address any questions the Court may have.
