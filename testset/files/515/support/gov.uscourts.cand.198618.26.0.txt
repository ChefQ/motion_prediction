INTRODUCTION
In Defendants’ Reply Brief in Support of their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Izumi

3

Ohkubo’s Complaint, Defendants present numerous unsupported factual assertions and new

4

arguments not found in their Opening Brief. To briefly address these issues, Mr. Ohkubo

5

respectfully requests that the Court permit Mr. Ohkubo to file the attached 5 and one-half page

6

Sur-Reply and Objections to Evidence (attached hereto as Exhibit A), the attached Rebuttal

7

Declaration of Izumi Ohkubo (attached hereto as Exhibit B) and the Declaration of Miharu

8

Furihata (attached hereto as Exhibit C), which, together constitute less than eight pages of text.

9

Counsel for Mr. Ohkubo requested that Defendants stipulate to this MAR, but Defendants refused.

10

Declaration of Joseph A. Meckes (“Meckes MAR Decl.”) at ¶8 submitted herewith

11

II.

THERE IS GOOD CAUSE FOR THE COURT TO CONSIDER MR. OHKUBO’S
SUR-REPLY

12
13

Defendant’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support of their Motion to Dismiss

14

was approximately 10 and a half pages long and contained virtually no facts to support dismissal

15

for improper venue or forum non conveniens, as Defendants requested. Meckes MAR Decl. at

16

¶2 submitted herewith. Although Defendants argued that the parties’ agreement contained a

17

mandatory forum selection provision, they did not explain how this provision (which provides

18

solely for jurisdiction) can be considered mandatory under applicable Ninth Circuit law (which

19

required forum selection provisions to contain clear language indicating exclusivity). Id. at ¶3.

20

Moreover, Defendants argued that the Court should dismiss under the doctrine of forum non

21

conveniens because there “critical” evidence was located in Japan but made no effort to describe

22

the nature of the alleged evidence or to explain why it was critical. Id. at ¶4.

23

After receiving Mr. Ohkubo’s Opposition Memorandum, Defendants have set out to cure

24

these deficiencies, primarily by making factual assertions and arguments that should have been

25

made in their Opening Brief, if at all. Id. at ¶5. Defendants provide no evidentiary support for

26

most of their factual assertions, many of which are contradicted by documents Defendants

27

themselves created or by the very pleadings Defendants cite. Id. at ¶6. In a footnote, Defendants

28

also apparently challenge the authenticity of the Investment Contract by claiming that there is a

1

“actual” contract between the parties that is different from the Investment Agreement that they

2

are relying on in support of their Motion--but without providing the Court a copy of this alleged

3

“actual” agreement. Id. at 7.

4

In his proposed Sur-Reply, Mr. Ohkubo limits his brief discussion to five matters: (1)

5

Defendants’ new, unsupported factual contention that someone other than Defendants drafted the

6

parties’ Investment Contract, (2) Defendants’ new argument that Article 9 of the Investment

7

Contract contains language making it a mandatory forum selection clause, (3) Defendants’ new

8

argument and factual assertions why Toshiaki Suzuki is a critical witness, (4) Defendants new

9

position that the “actual” contract between Mr. Ohkubo and the Defendants is not the same

10

Investment Contract that they are relying on in support of their motion, and (5) Mr. Ohkubo’s

11

objections to various factually incorrect or unsupported assertions. Although there are numerous

12

other new arguments that should have been presented by Defendants’ in their Opening Brief,

13

these core issues go to the heart of Defendants’ Motion and could have been easily addressed by

14

Mr. Ohkubo in his Opposition Brief had Defendants not saved these facts and arguments for

15

Reply.

16

Accordingly, for good cause shown, Mr. Ohkubo respectfully requests that the Court

17

permit him to file the attached Sur-Reply and Objections, the Rebuttal Declaration of Izumi

18

Ohkubo and the Declaration of Miharu Furihata. Mr. Ohkubo believes these documents contain

19

information that will be essential to the Court in ruling on the pending Motion.
