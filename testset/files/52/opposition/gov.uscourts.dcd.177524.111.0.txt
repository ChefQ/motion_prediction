PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO
DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT
COME NOW the Plaintiffs herein, and hereby respond to the Motion to dismiss filed by
individuals and private entities named as Defendants herein. Defendants argue that this Court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction based on the political question doctrine and the act of state
doctrine. The Motion should be denied for a number of reasons. First, local District Court Judge
Rosemary Collyer has rejected the invocation of the political question doctrine or the act of state
doctrine in very similar circumstances. See Biton v. Palestinian Interim Self-Government
Authority, 412 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2005). Second, the D.C. Circuit has recently in affirmed in
Simon v. Republic of Hungary, 812 F.3d 127 (D.C. 2016) that alien Plaintiffs can rely on the
Alien Tort Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1350, hereinafter ATS, to pursue claims based on the illegal
confiscation of private property located abroad. Plaintiffs have alleged herein that belligerent
settlers and rogue army personnel have stolen tens of thousands of acres or private Palestinian
property. The D.C. Circuit concluded that private property confiscation in violation of
international law is a war crime akin to genocide, especially if it involves the destruction of
homes. As alleged in the complaint (Introduction), 49,000 Palestinian homes have been

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 2 of 23

demolished or confiscated by belligerent settlers and rogue Israeli army personnel. They receive
$2 billion every year from U.S. based pro-occupation tax-exempt entities like Defendants
Friends of Ariel [Defendant Adelson’s favorite settlement], and Friends of the Israeli Army. In
2014 the Israeli Army received $104 million from Friends of the Israeli Army to maim and
murder Palestinian landowners.
The third reason why the motion should be denied is that, as recognized by District Judge
Royce Lamberth in Doe v. Exxon Mobil, ATS claims like the ones asserted herein have been
recognized by federal district courts for at least 40 years. Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, 69 F.
Supp. 3d 75 (D.D.C. 2014). In that case, Judge Lamberth analyzed the “touch and concern test”
at great length. Based on allegations contained in the introduction and venue sections, re: the
extensive criminal conduct engaged in by the Defendants on U.S. soil, (money laundering,
income tax fraud, and arms trafficking), the Plaintiffs have satisfied this touch and concern test
based upon Judge Lamberth’s analysis. The fourth reason the motion should be denied is that
various courts have agreed with Justices Collyer and Lamberth’s analysis regarding virtually the
identical claims made herein. Other District Court judges, for example Judge Nina Gershon of
the Eastern District of New York, have thoroughly analyzed the political question doctrine as it
applies in the context of ATS and ATA claims. That decision alone affords this Court a valid basis
to deny the motion to dismiss premised on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

ARGUMENT
I.

This District Has Rejected Application of the Political Question Doctrine as a Bar to
Hearing Similar Claims
As a fair reading of Defendant’s memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss, the
overriding theme is that the political question doctrine bars claims made by the Plaintiffs herein
because somehow they have the potential to undermine the separation of powers doctrine
designed by our founding fathers. (See Defendant’s Memorandum at 13). While the Defendants’
memorandum is premised on the invocation of the political question doctrine, it does not address
relevant political question authorities from this District for an obvious reason. Those decisions
support the proposition that the political question doctrine has no application on our facts.
Based on Defendants’ memorandum, the motion to dismiss essentially relies on a single
case in this jurisdiction, i.e. Judge Bates’ opinion in Doe v. State of Israel, 400 F. Supp. 2d 86
(D.D.C. 2005). While the Defendants argue that this Court should dismiss the complaint based
upon the Doe opinion, nothing therein compels dismissal. First, the Doe Plaintiffs inexplicably
requested an award of declaratory relief that necessarily implicated the political question
doctrine, i.e. they sought a ruling from Judge Bates that “Israel was a terrorist state.” That is
something for the State Department or the Executive Department to decide. Plaintiffs of course
have made no such request.
They are instead requesting entry of a monetary judgment against the financiers [donors,
tax exempt entities], and profiteers [corporations and bank entities named herein], of settlement
expansion, which necessarily entails ethnic cleansing and genocide. They allege in the suit, for at
least 30 years, the Defendants have aided and abetted and financed the illegal appropriation of
private property, wholesale violence, and perpetration of war crimes. And they are not requesting

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 7 of 23

that this Court opine that settlements are illegal, even though, based on the discussion infra, it
appears that they are.
Moreover, the Doe plaintiffs never alleged that the Defendants have violated: a) nine
separate criminal statutes; b) a number of Treasury tax-exempt regulations; c) President Clinton’s
1995 Executive Order; and d) the newly enacted legislation called JASTA (Pub. L. No.114-222).
Both JASTA and that Presidential executive order prohibit U.S. citizens from participating in or
financing violence in the Middle East. U.S. Defendants here have been financing violence in the
Middle East for at least 30 years. In fact, even today they send approximately $2 billion in
charitable donations every year overseas to fund settlement expansion, the purchase of
Kalashnikovs, M16s, sniper scopes, body armor, and the murder and maiming of innocent
Palestinian Civilians. (See Introduction).2 The Defendants’ goal is to force all non-Jews in the
OPT to abandon their 200-year-old homes and olive groves. That is classic ethnic cleansing.
That conduct not only violates 50 years of America’s anti-settlement public policy, but
also 35 years of Israel anti-settlement public policy. See Compl. Introduction; ¶¶ 97, 146, 158).
That is only one of many reasons why the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have violated
numerous Treasury Department tax-exempt regulations. Those regulations prohibit U.S. taxexempt entities from using charitable donations to fund criminal conduct in the U.S. or abroad,
or finance activities which violate the recipient country’s public policy or its criminal statutes.
Israel’s public policy is definitely anti-settlement. The nine federal criminal statutes which have
been violated by all the U.S. Defendants are: money laundering, arms trafficking, wire and mail
fraud, financing a foreign militia unit, conspiring to defraud a U.S. government agency, income
2 Even former U.S. Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, in a Huffington Post piece, noted that one ProOccupation tax-exempt entity raises money through two Brooklyn non-profits “to train and equip
guard units for settlements. Its website encourages donors to ‘send a tax-deductible check for
night-vision binoculars, bulletproof vehicles and guard dogs’”.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 8 of 23

tax fraud, engaging in interstate or foreign travel to solicit funds to promote criminal activity
abroad, and perjury. (See for example, 18 U.S.C. § 2339C [financing international acts of
terrorism]; 18 U.S.C. § 960 [funding a foreign army]; and 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(2) [moneylaundering], 18 U.S.C.§ 371 [conspiracy to defraud]).
As for the question as to whether or not the settlements are illegal, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance answered that question emphatically 40 years ago: “‘United States Policy regarding
settlements is unequivocal and has been a matter of longstanding record…settlements are illegal,
and Article 49 paragraph 6 of GCIV is applicable,’ i.e., ‘all occupiers [like Israel] are bound to
preserve private properties for the rightful owners.’” ¶ 97. Moreover, numerous Secretaries of
State and U.S. Presidents, including Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Obama have all publicly
concluded that they are illegal (See U.S. Anti-Settlement Public Policy section herein). That
conclusion is consistent with senior Israeli Attorney Theodore Meron’s opinion. He opined, just
like Secretary of State Vance, that “civilian settlements in the administered territories contravene
the explicit provisions of the Geneva Convention.” 3
Whether or not settlements are legal, the bottom line question remains—how does the
outrageous criminal conduct financed by these Defendants to intimidate a civilian population, i.e.
genocide and ethnic cleansing, impede the ability of our President to conduct foreign affairs?
And, how does suing American citizens who abuse the U.S. tax code, or engage in money
laundering or fund a foreign army and conspire on U.S. soil to injure civilians located overseas
impede our President’s ability to conduct foreign affairs? The reason why money-laundering is a
serious issue is because it: a) promotes other criminal conduct; and b) because it damages the
American economy by forcing other citizens to shoulder an additional burden in terms of income
taxes. Arms trafficking not only provokes tension in the OPT, it also results in hundreds of

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 9 of 23

needless civilian deaths.
As already referenced earlier, Defendants have ignored a number of relevant opinions
issued in this District that can serve as a basis for denying their motion to dismiss. In Biton I and
Biton II, Judge Collyer opined that the Court was competent to rule on similar claims made
herein. 412 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 2005). Judge Collyer analyzed both the political question
doctrine and act of state doctrine at length, and rejected the Defendant’s argument that having the
case go forward would violate those doctrines. Citations from her opinions significantly bear on
the issue before the Court, i.e. disposition of the Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction.
As Judge Collyer pointed out in Biton II: “Defendants argue that the Court would be
required ‘to assess the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the illegality of Israel’s oppressive actions
in its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.’” Id. She rejected that argument because,
“Defendants misperceive the status of the case. Plaintiffs complain that Defendants’ actions
caused them injury; while the ATA provides jurisdiction for the suit in federal court, the basic
elements of the claim lie in tort, not in the relations between Palestine and Israel”. Id. at 5-6.
(emphasis added). In rejecting the identical argument advanced in the Defendants’ memorandum,
Judge Collyer also explained in Biton II:
“‘This is a tort suit brought under a legislative scheme that Congress enacted for the
express purpose of providing a legal remedy for injuries or death occasioned by acts of
international terrorism.’ There is no flaw in this Court’s ability to address Plaintiff’s
claims: Congress explicitly committed these issues to the federal courts under the ATA.
Similarly, the Court has access to ‘judicially manageable standards for resolving the
issues before it,’ id., from both existing ATA caselaw and traditional tort caselaw.
The ‘initial policy determination’ involved here has already been made by the U.S.
Congress: Americans injured by terrorist acts can sue their attackers in U.S. courts and
the Court can manage this case to resolution of Defendants’ alleged liability without
‘expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government.’ Baker, 369 U.S.
at 217. The Fifth and Sixth factors from Baker v. Carr do not apply because a decision in

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 10 of 23

this individual case will have no consequences concerning ‘political decisions already
made’ and will raise only the question of Defendants’ alleged liability regarding this
single bombing of a bus. Thus, nothing in Baker v. Carr counsels against having this case
proceed.” Biton II, 412 F. Supp, 2d at 6.
Similar to the holding in Estate of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 424 F. Supp. 2d 153, 162
(D.D.C. 2006), the tortfeasors named herein “have made no attempt to distinguish any of these
prior decisions in their moving papers.” Just as in Biton II, a decision on Plaintiffs’ claims
alleged herein can be resolved by this Court by deciding the liability of the Defendant
tortfeasors, thus it would have no consequences concerning “political decisions already made.”
Biton II at 6. The Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the Motion to Dismiss can be denied based
solely on the holdings in Biton I and Biton II. The bottom line is that it would be judicial error
for this Court to grant the motion to dismiss based on Judge Bates’ holding.
They are two entirely different cases, e.g. the Doe Plaintiffs never alleged that the
Defendant tortfeasors were engaging in a $2 billion money laundering scheme on U.S. soil
designed to rid the West Bank of all non-Jews. All Defendants know that the fulfillment of that
goal—ridding the West Bank of all non-Jews—necessarily entailed ethnic cleansing and
genocide. Thus, they were financing war crimes. Without the funding provided by the U.S. based
tax-exempt entities and donors, belligerent settlers would never have had the financial resources
to accomplish that job. Evidence thereof is the fact that equipping a fifty-member militia unit
with body armor or Kalashnikovs or M-16s could run as much as $200,000. None of the
settlements have that amount of money lying around to purchase military hardware. The solution
—have pro occupation tax-exempt entities’ and donors’ financial backing.
II.

The D.C. Circuit has Affirmed that Aliens Can Sue for Illegal Property Confiscations
Defendants have also ignored the recent D.C. Circuit opinion in Simon v. Republic of
Hungary, 812 F.3d 127 (D.C. 2016). The Plaintiffs therein complained that their homes and

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 11 of 23

private property had been illegally confiscated by the Hungarian government and a Hungarian
state-owned railway. Just like the Plaintiffs herein, the Plaintiffs in that case alleged that
destroying or confiscating their homes constituted a grave war crime, i.e. genocide. The D.C.
Circuit allowed the case to go forward against the state-owned railroad and overruled the District
Court for failing to recognize claims based on expropriation of private property in violation of
international law. The identical claims are made herein.
Contrary to Judge Bates’ Doe v. Israel opinion cited repeatedly in Defendants’ motion to
dismiss, the D.C. Circuit concluded that a Federal District Court judge could competently hear
and determine claims that are virtually identical to the ones alleged herein. See Simon v.
Republic of Hungary, 812 F.3d 127 (D.C. 2016). Plaintiffs Ali, Abulhawa, and Kateeb, who are
U.S. citizens, have specifically alleged that they have lost their private property as a result of
funding coming from U.S. Defendants tax-exempt entities and their donors who sent $104
million to the Israeli army in 2014. The theft of private property included two steps: a) settlers,
armed with Kalashnikovs and body armor threaten to kill Palestinian land owners who are forced
to evacuate the area fearing family members will be murdered; b) After the settlers move in,
rogue Israeli soldiers, financed by the American taxpayer, encircle their homes and refuse
Palestinian homeowners reentry.
Contrary to Defendants’ argument, individuals who do not actually terrorize a civilian
population or maim and murder them, but provide the necessary financing to do so can be
deemed to be collaborators in the commission of war crimes. See re: Count II – War Crimes).
District Court Judge Lamberth, in a similar setting, has also held that claims against a defendant
for injuries caused by Indonesian soldiers employed overseas by the defendant therein did not
violate the act of state doctrine, nor warrant dismissal under the political question doctrine. See

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 12 of 23

Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, 69 F. Supp. 3d 75 (D.D.C. 2014). In that case, Judge Lamberth
found that federal courts may recognize private claims under the ATS as a manner of federal
common law if those claims sufficiently ‘state a violation of law of nations with the requisite
definite content and acceptance among civilized nations.’” Id. at 94 (quoting Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at
1663). The entire world recognizes that ethnic cleansing and genocide violate the law of nations.
Our founding fathers thought so much of the law of nations concept that a law of nations clause
is enshrined in our Constitution. U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 10. Judge Lamberth further recognized
that “authorities and sources confirm aiding and abetting liability is clearly established in the law
of nations and consequently such liability is available under the ATS.” Id. (quoting Doe VIII, 654
F.3d at 32). Defendants of course do not address this issue in their memorandum.
The U.S. Supreme Court, as reiterated by the Judge Lamberth in Doe v. Exxon Mobil,
“noted that in certain situations, claims arising under the ATS might ‘touch and concern the
territory of the United States’ with ‘sufficient force to displace the presumption against
extraterritorial application.’” Id. (quoting Kiobel at 1669). In ultimately concluding that the
Plaintiffs’ claims in Doe v. Exxon Mobil sufficiently touched and concerned the United States to
allow the ATS claims to go forward, the Court specifically referenced the 4th Circuit opinion of
Al Shimari v. CACI Premier Tech., Inc., 758 F. 3d 516 (4th Cir. 2014), noting “the ATS was
properly applied [there] because, among other reasons, plaintiffs alleged relevant U.S. based
conduct indicating knowledge and encouragement of international law violations abroad.” Id. at
95.
The Plaintiffs have repeatedly alleged, and have detailed the U.S. based criminal activity
engaged in by both pro-occupation U.S. donors and U.S. tax-exempt entities. The donors and the
entities solicit charitable donations on U.S. soil to send millions of dollars overseas which

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 13 of 23

provides assistance to tortfeasors based overseas like rogue Israeli Army personnel and
belligerent settlers to finance theft of private property, settlement expansion, arms trafficking,
and ethnic cleansing and genocide. They also alleged that all Defendants knew that their
charitable donations would be used to maim and murder Palestinians and forcibly remove
thousands of Palestinian families from the OPT. Their funding made that criminal activity
possible and resulted in 400,000 Palestinian civilians being deported from the OPT in violation
of the Geneva Convention.4 Compl. ¶ 107.
In any event, Defendants’ argument can and should be rejected for the same reasons that
Judge Lamberth relied on in Doe v. Exxon Mobil. He rejected the argument that adjudicating the
plaintiffs’ claims “would require the Court to declare invalid an official act of the [State].” Id. at
87. As explained by the Court, “[t]he act of state doctrine requires American courts to presume
the validity of an official act of a foreign sovereign performed within its own territory.” Id. He
denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss because “[Defendant] has made no showing that
plaintiffs were injured pursuant to official military orders as required by the act of state
doctrine.” Id.
Plaintiffs allege armed belligerent settlers are “out of control” according to 700 Israeli
army veterans. As sworn to in their book “Our Harsh Logic”, their mission in the OPT was not to
protect Israel, but to protect belligerent settlers when they went on violent rampages against
Palestinian farmers, almost a daily occurrence. In their memorandum, the Defendants have not
claimed that any of this criminal activity that they financed was engaged in based on official
military or government orders, nor could they. Not a single civilized nation has ever issued
official government orders that compel murdering and maiming civilians, burning down their
homes and places of worship, buying military hardware to intimidate landowners, stealing
4 See “Israelis Excel at Camouflaging the Expulsion of Palestinians” Haaretz, Oct. 20, 2014.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 14 of 23

private property, or engaging in war crimes like ethnic cleansing and genocide. Therefore, the
Act of State doctrine cannot be invoked herein as a basis for granting the instant motion to
dismiss.
Judge Lamberth ultimately concluded in Doe v. Exxon Mobil that because the Defendant
“provided material support to its security personnel by, for example, constructing facilities,
providing funding for weapons, providing supplies and equipment, and paying for the services of
consultants in training and equipping the personnel” that the claims were actionable under the
ATS. Id. at 96 (emphasis added). As alleged in the Complaint, the Plaintiffs make the identical
claims as the Plaintiffs did in Doe v. Exxon Mobil. They allege that Defendants have provided the
funding for the purchase of body armor, sniper scopes and automatic weapons [arms trafficking],
building military barracks, providing supplies [ammunition], and providing the necessary
training to ensure that settlement militia members knew how to use sniper scopes so they could
murder Palestinian farmers trying to harvest their olive groves. The result - 400,000 Palestinians
no longer live in the West Bank, forced out by belligerent settlers. That is classic ethnic
cleansing.
III.

Alien Torts Statute Claims Have Been Entertained by Federal Courts for over 40 Years
A case remarkable on its facts to the case sub judici, is Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation
Organization, 583 F. Supp. 2d 451 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). The Sokolow plaintiffs alleged that the
Defendants, much like what is alleged in this lawsuit, have carried out and utilized violent
physical attacks on an innocent civilian population in order to terrorize and intimidate them.
Here, Palestinian nationals alleged that they have been intimidated and coerced into abandoning
their homes and olive groves as a result of armed violent settlers threatening to murder them. The
court in Sokolow, quoting Estates of Ungar v. Palestinian Authority, 315 F. Supp. 2d 15 (D.R.I.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 15 of 23

2004), noted that “[t]he [Defendants] PA and PLO repeatedly fail to realize that the nonjusticiability doctrine is one of political questions and not political cases.” Id. at 456.
The Defendants raise many of the same foreign policy concerns as the PLO did in
Sokolow and Klinghoffer, with the Second Circuit observing that “[t]he fact that the issues before
[the court] arise in a politically charged context does not convert what is essentially an ordinary
tort suit into a non-justiciable political question.” Id. (quoting Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille
Lauro, 937 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1991)). See also Biton at 6, noting that “the ATA provides
jurisdiction for suits in federal courts, the basic elements of the claim lie in tort, not in the
relations between Palestine and Israel.”
In addition, federal courts, such as the Second and Ninth Circuits have recognized tort
liability for torture, genocide, and war crimes committed by both state and non-state actors.
Apartheid Litig. At 248-49. The Ninth Circuit has also held “that a court’s jurisdiction to hear
claims under the ATCA is not limited by ‘the focus of the injury’.” Id. at 247 (quoting In re
Marcos, 978 F. 2d 493, 500 (9th Cir. 1992). A tort that violates customary international law will
be recognized under the ATS if “the norm alleged (1) is defined with a specificity comparable to
the 18th-century paradigms discussed in Sosa. (2) is based upon a norm of international character
accepted by the civilized world, and (3) is one that States universally abide by, or accede to, out
of a sense of legal obligation and mutual concern.” Apartheid Litig. At 248 (quoting Abdullahi v.
Pfizer, Inc., 562 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2009). As this Court knows, genocide and ethnic cleansing are
war crimes, and violate norms of international character accepted by the civilized world.
Plaintiffs also allege the international crime of denationalization, which has been
recognized as an actionable tort basis for jurisdiction under the ATCA. See Apartheid Litig. at
252 (“A state actor commits arbitrary denationalization if it terminates the nationality of a citizen

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 16 of 23

either arbitrarily or on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or political beliefs”); see also
the 1907 Hague Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land (individuals have
a right to retain their citizenship, even in the fact of a hostile invasion). The Plaintiffs have
alleged herein that state actors like out of control Israeli soldiers and belligerent settlers have
committed arbitrary denationalization based on race, religion, ethnicity, and political beliefs.
Defendants here make essentially the same arguments as the Defendants did in Apartheid
Litigation, re: that the Court does not have jurisdiction to address tort claims based on
extraterritorial events. Although the physical injuries complained of herein, i.e. maiming and
murdering Palestinian civilians, occurred outside the U.S., this is no bar to jurisdiction. See
Apartheid Litig. at 246. As detailed in the venue section, pro-occupation U.S. donors and 501(c)
(3) officials have conspired on U.S. soil for approximately 30 years to finance horrific criminal
activity—maim and murder Palestinians, steal their property, engage in ethnic cleansing and
genocide. “It is not extraordinary for a court to adjudicate a tort claim arising outside of its
territorial jurisdiction.” Filartiga, 630 F.2d at 885.
The Defendants have also suggested that there should be a requirement imposed on the
Plaintiffs to trace specific wire dollar transfers to specific physical attacks on innocent
Palestinian civilians. That requirement has been repeatedly rejected by our federal courts. See
Strauss v. Credit Lyonnais S.A, 925 F. Supp. 2d 414, 433-34 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). (“Plaintiffs who
bring an ATA action are not required to trace specific dollars to specific attacks to satisfy the
proximate cause standard. Such a task would be impossible and would make the ATA practically
dead letter.”) It would be impossible to trace specific dollars to specific attacks on our facts
because the named Defendants have been executing wire transfers for approximately thirty years.

Based on the allegations made herein, a reasonable juror could conclude that the
significant amount of money sent by U.S. Defendants overseas [$2 billion a year] was a
substantial reason why sister Israeli based NGOs intent on ridding the West Bank of all nonJews, belligerent settlers, and rogue Israeli army soldiers were able to finance the horrific
terrorist attacks described herein.
It also would be obvious to any juror hearing this case, that an annual subsidy of $2
billion is quite a staggering sum. Besides the amount of the subsidy, another reason why those
funds were so crucial is that the Israeli government had prohibited charitable donations to
settlements, which cut off a significant source of income. Likewise, Secretary of State Baker was
assured by Prime Minister Shamir in 1992 [the Baker/Shamir Accord], that no part of American
financial aid would be used to set up new settlements or finance expansion of existing
settlements. Thus, except for some minimal funding coming from Prime Minister Netanyahu,
(“under the table financing”), the settlers did not have any source of funding to: a) properly equip
a 50-member local militia unit; and b) build vital infrastructure improvements like electric power
grids and sewage hookups.
IV.

Other Federal Courts Have Also Found That Claims Based on the ATA or the ATS Do
Not Bar a Federal Judge From Hearing Such Claims
It is not just Judge Collyer, Judge Lamberth, and the D.C. Circuit that have decided to

reject the argument that Courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to entertain claims based on
violation of international norms. Other Courts have decided to reject the application of the
Political Question doctrine based on similar allegations made herein. For example, in Linde v.
Arab Bank, Judge Gershon of the Eastern District of New York rejected the invocation of the
political question to bar her from hearing similar claims made herein. Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC,
384 F. Supp. 2d 571 (E.D.N.Y. 2005). She analyzed the political question doctrine at length, and

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 18 of 23

rejected the Defendant’s argument for dismissal premised on the fact that the ATS statute
empowers courts to hear a dispute between foreign nationals concerning extra territorial conduct.
Id. As Judge Gershon observed, this argument was unavailing to the Defendant. Foreign
plaintiffs sued foreign defendants for extra territorial conduct in both Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630
F. 2d 876 (2d Cir. 1980) and Caddick v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232 (2d Cir. 1995). Id. And Judge
Gershon remarked further that indeed “a recent 2nd Circuit case upheld the availability of aiding
and abetting liability for conduct of foreign defendants in South Africa.”
In Linde, just like the Plaintiffs herein, the Defendant Bank had, through the provision of
financial services to groups that engaged in terrorist activity, knowingly and intentionally aided
and abetted violent criminal attacks on civilians in Israel in violation of international law. The
only difference between those allegations and the allegations pled herein is that the injured
Plaintiffs therein were innocent Israeli citizens, not Palestinians. The Plaintiffs herein, just like
the Plaintiffs in Linde, have alleged that they’ve been injured by the Defendants providing
substantial financial assistance to promote that criminal activity.
Defendants rely significantly on the Baker v. Carr holding to justify dismissing the
lawsuit based on non-justiciable political questions. Much like the Defendants herein, the
Defendant in Linde v. Arab Bank laid out the elements that identify a non-justiciable political
question. Judge Gershon then concluded, however, that “these elements do not exist in this case,
in particular no action by a coordinate branch of the us government is involved here.” Id. She
also pointed out that “it ignores government concerns that charitable donations purportedly for
humanitarian services are being funneled to terrorist entities.” Id.
Judge Gershon went on to point out that as set forth in Almog v. Arab Bank, PLC, 471 F.
Supp. 2d 257 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), the three theories of international law violations asserted in the

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 19 of 23

case were all based upon principles to which the United States has expressed strong adherence.
Id. at 318. Just as the Plaintiffs alleged in Almog, U.S. senior officials like Senator Leahy have
expressed strong adherence to international law conventions, like the Geneva Convention.
Senator Leahy has, among others, specifically condemned the extra judicial killings that are
alleged in this complaint. And senior State Department officials have repeatedly condemned not
only extra judicial killings, but settlement expansion and the violence it promotes.
Moreover, successful prosecution of this lawsuit will, if anything, reinforce U.S. public
policy concerns about settlement expansion, the frustration of U.S. foreign policy objectives, and
encouraging criminal activity like money laundering, arson and arms trafficking. As this Court
knows, money-laundering and arms trafficking are prosecuted on a daily basis by the Justice
Department. As recited in Mamani v. Berzain, 654 F. 2d 1148 (11th Cir. 2011), the claims alleged
therein simply required the court to evaluate the lawfulness of the conduct of the
Defendants/tortfeasors named therein. For example, the claims in Mamani, such as extra judicial
killings occurring in Bolivia by government officials, did not require the Court to decide the
legitimacy of U.S. executive branch foreign policy decisions. Mamani at 1151 (quoting Cf.
hinder v. Portocarrero, 963 F.2d 332, 332 (11th Cir. 1992)). Just like here, the claims asserted by
the Plaintiffs [genocide, denationalization of a civilian population and ethnic cleansing] do not
require this court to decide the propriety of the U.S. executive branch’s foreign policy decisions
as they pertain to the Middle East.
Finally, Defendants urge this Court to accept the argument that suing individuals who are
financing war crimes abroad somehow impact the ability of the political branch to function.
Besides being an absurd argument to embrace based on relevant case law in this District, such a
decision would likely violate provisions contained in the International Covenant on Civil and

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 20 of 23

Political Rights. As this Court surely realizes, foreign plaintiffs should be able to access U.S.
court to have legitimate property and civil rights claims adjudicated, especially where they
complain about ethnic cleansing and genocide. These are classic war crimes, which violate
international norms recognized by the world. Thus, if foreign plaintiffs are denied that right, this
Court could possibly be violating relevant provisions contained in the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights.
Defendants further argue that having the Court decide the issues raised in the Complaint
would violate the standards set forth in Baker as to issues best left to the political branches of
government. The Court pointed out in Baker, however, that “An action does not lie beyond
judicial cognizance solely because it raises questions touching upon foreign relations.” 369 U.S.
186 (1962). The Second Circuit noted that “[w]ith respect to the first Baker test, while foreign
policy is committed in the first instance to the Executive, tort claims against foreign countries
and individuals under the law of nations, as well as issues of sovereign immunity, are
constitutionally committed to ‘none other than our own Judiciary.’” Whiteman v. Dorotheum
GmbH & Co. KG, 431 F.3d 57 (2d. Cir. 2005) (quoting Kadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, 249 (2d
Cir. 1995). See also Alperin v. Vatican Bank, 410 F.3d 532, 551 (9th Cir. 2005).
As for the second and third Baker tests, just like in Whiteman, they are met by applying
not only the traditional adjudication process, but also through “the universally recognized norms
of international law [invoked by the Plaintiff].” Whiteman. at 77. The Second Circuit noted, for
example, that the “FSIA “‘provide[s] judicially … manageable standards for adjudicating suits’
and ‘obviate[s] any need to make policy decisions of the kind normally reserved for non judicial
discretion.’” Id. (citing Kadic, 70 F.3d at 249). As further outlined in Whiteman, “[t]he fourth and
sixth tests are basically coterminous with the fifth, that they involve cases where an exercise of

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 21 of 23

jurisdiction, although not per se outside the judiciary’s authority, would somehow contradict
actions taken by the political branches; [the Court] will therefore discuss them together.” Id.
It is important to reiterate that a ruling in this case would in no way contradict prior
decisions taken by the other political branches—executive or legislative. Id.; see also Japan
Whaling Ass’n v. American Cetacean Society, 478 U.S. 221 (1986) (the Supreme Court for
example unanimously declined to dismiss as non-justiciable a claim that the Secretary of
Commerce had violated federal statutory law by refusing to certify that Japan’s whaling practices
were undermining the effectiveness of an international fishing conservation program). If
anything, this case serves to reinforce fundamental principles of international law approved by
12 American Presidents and at least 10 Secretaries of State—i.e., ethnic cleansing, genocide, and
denationalization of a civilian population are horrific war crimes.
Finally, the Defendants failed to address Amnesty International’s principles on universal
jurisdiction as recognized by the district court of Jerusalem in the case of Israel v. Eichmann
(1962). The District Court of Jerusalem held, regarding jurisdiction, that the universal character
of the crimes in question, i.e. war crimes, which are grave offenses against the law of nations
itself, grants jurisdiction to any domestic court hearing such claims. As repeatedly pled herein,
grave war crimes, like genocide and ethnic cleansing, committed or funded by the Defendants
named herein are an appropriate basis to conclude that the Court had subject matter jurisdiction
herein.
Defendants’ intentions regarding displacement of Palestinian landowners are well-known.
For example, there are at least 200 Rav Shatz Israeli Guards in the OPT. One former Rav Shatz
“patrolled outside the settlement to frighten neighboring Palestinians so they would move away,”

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 111 Filed 02/24/17 Page 22 of 23

driving the Palestinians off the land clears the path for settlement expansion. 5 He explained
further that expansion is the primary goal of Israeli West Bank Settlers. The One Israeli fund, just
like the U.S. tax-exempt entities named herein, transfers sophisticated military equipment to
these guards, who use that equipment to intimidate and push out Palestinians.
In the Memorandum (page 6), the Defendants claim that none of them have actually
engaged in any actions causing personal injuries, nor have they taken forcefully or otherwise any
property from any Plaintiff. That is a true statement, but it is totally irrelevant because the
Defendants have financed these criminal acts. As detailed in the Complaint Count II, genocide is
defined to mean that if you aid and abet the commission of war crimes, you can be accused of
being a war crime collaborator simply because you have financed these crimes.
And it is rather disingenuous on the Defendants’ part to claim that U.S. Defendants have
been engaging in “normal business transactions” with settlers by financing the commission of
international acts of terrorism. These are not “normal business transactions” which a U.S. taxexempt entity can engage in. They constitute money laundering (i.e. sending funds overseas to
promote criminal activity and arms trafficking). In fact, these alleged “normal business
transactions” violate both President Clinton’s Executive Order and the new JASTA legislation.

Based on the authorities cited herein from this judicial district, and the detailed
allegations contained in the Complaint, this Court has ample precedent to deny the instant
motion based on subject matter jurisdiction.
