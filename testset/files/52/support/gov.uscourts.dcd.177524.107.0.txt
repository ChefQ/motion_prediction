BASSEM AL-TAMIMI, et al.,
Plaintiffs,

Case No. 16-cv-445 (TSC)

v.
SHELDON ADELSON, et al.,

[Oral Argument Requested]

Defendants.
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendants Sheldon Adelson*+, Lawrence Ellison*, John Hagee*, Irving Moskowitz+,
Haim Saban*, American Friends of Ariel*, American Friends of Ulpana Ofra*, American
Friends of Bet El Yeshiva, Christian Friends of Israeli Communities*, Efrat Development
Foundation*, Falic Family Foundation, Inc., Friends of the Israel Defense Forces*, Gush Etzion
Foundation*, Honenu National Legal Defense Organization*, The Hebron Fund*, Bank Leumi
Le-Israel B.M.*, Bank Leumi USA*, Bank Hapoalim B.M.*+, RE/MAX, LLC, Access
Industries, Inc.+, Veolia Environnement S.A.*+, Veolia North America, LLC*, Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Co.*, Hewlett Packard (Israel) Ltd.*, Motorola Solutions, Inc.*, Motorola Solutions
Israel Ltd.*+, and Jewish National Fund (Keren Kayemeth Le Israel) Inc.* (collectively
“Defendants”) move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (the “Complaint” or “AC”).
As detailed in the accompanying Memorandum of Law, Defendants move this Court for
an order dismissing the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) as none of the claims asserted in the
Complaint is justiciable under the political question and act of state doctrines. A proposed order
is attached to this Motion.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 2 of 39

As previewed in the Notice previously filed by Defendants (Dkt. 93), Defendants also
move to dismiss the Complaint under Rule 12(b) on the grounds that it fails to plead an
actionable claim and improperly seeks to invoke jurisdiction over extraterritorial matters under
the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”) and, in the event of dismissal of the federal ATS claims, it fails to
establish diversity jurisdiction over the non-federal claims. In addition, each defendant above
whose name is designated with an asterisk (“*”) also moves on the ground of lack of personal
jurisdiction, and each defendant above whose name is designated with a plus sign (“+”) also
moves on the ground of lack of proper service of process. Pursuant to the Court’s December 15,
2016 Order (Dkt. 97), the accompanying Memorandum of Law does not brief these further
grounds for dismissal, pending further instruction by the Court.

National Fund (Keren Kayemeth Le Israel) Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”) respectfully submit
this memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint
(Dkt. 77, the “Complaint” or “AC”) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). 1
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The Complaint in this action is a strident political diatribe, thinly garbed as a legal
pleading. Its subject, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (and, in particular, the settlements
established by Israel in the West Bank after the 1967 War), is one of the world’s longest-running,

1

Pursuant to the Court’s order of December 15, 2016 (the “December 15 Order”), this
memorandum is limited to Defendants’ contention that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
under Rule 12(b)(1). It does not address the failure of the AC to state an actionable claim.
Because of the unique nature of the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”) as a jurisdictional grant, the
numerous pleading deficiencies in the AC’s ATS claims could be resolved under Rule 12(b)(1).
The jurisdictional issues, however, are intertwined with Plaintiffs’ failure to plead an actionable
claim under that statute, and Defendants understand that the December 15 Order defers such
briefing. Because this brief does not address ATS-specific issues, it also does not address
Plaintiffs’ failure to establish diversity jurisdiction over the non-federal claims, which would be a
basis for dismissal of those claims in the event that the federal ATS claims were dismissed.
Should the AC survive the Rule 12(b)(1) arguments briefed here, Defendants would
thereafter intend to brief all the deficiencies in the ATS claim at one time. Also, in accordance
with the December 15 Order, this memorandum does not address other aspects of Defendants’
Motion, including issues of personal jurisdiction or service, which the affected Defendants also
will brief, if necessary, at a later time as instructed by the Court.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 13 of 39

most tragic, and, so far, regrettably intractable political controversies. This dispute is of great
consequence not only to the U.S. but to the rest of the world community, which recognizes the
importance of the dispute in the complex politics of the entire Middle East. The rights and
wrongs of the parties to that conflict, including with respect to Israel’s settlements, have been,
and will continue to be, fiercely debated in the political arena. The most recent United Nations
Security Council resolution on the settlements in December 2016 and the hotly contested
positions of various countries (and within U.S. domestic politics) demonstrate that debate
surrounding this issue endures in the international and national political arenas and that the
position of the U.S. Government itself may well be fluid.
Whatever else the settlement dispute might be and wherever else it may be decided, it is
not a proper subject for adjudication by a U.S. court. This Court recognized the
non-justiciability of this conflict over a decade ago in Doe v. State of Israel, 400 F. Supp. 2d 86
(D.D.C. 2005) (Bates, J.) (“Doe I”), when it dismissed a complaint by anonymous Palestinians
that, except for the identity of the defendants, was nearly identical to this one. This Court held,
inter alia, that claims similar to those asserted here regarding settlement activities in the West
Bank are non-justiciable under the political question and act of state doctrines.
The present Complaint suffers from the same defects. While Plaintiffs have spent a great
deal of time presenting a generalized account of alleged mistreatment of unnamed Palestinians
by unnamed soldiers and settlers, they have not pleaded claims justiciable in a U.S. court.
Whatever forum may be appropriate for presenting this political controversy, this Court is not it.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 14 of 39

ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT 2
The Complaint is premised on an alleged conspiracy among Defendants, the Israeli
military, and unidentified settlers living in Israel and in the area referenced in the Complaint as
the “Occupied Palestinian Territories” (or “OPT”). AC at 12-13, 16, ¶ 124 (referring to
settlement leaders as co-conspirators), ¶¶ 214-215 (alleging the Israel Defense Force (“IDF”) as
co-conspirator with the settlers); Ex. C at 1 (identifying the Israel Air Force (“IAF”) as a
“perpetrator” with the IDF, settlers, and Israeli-based non-governmental organizations).
Plaintiffs’ claims are centered on activities occurring in the “OPT” (hereinafter also referred to as
“the West Bank and Gaza”). The Complaint defines “settlements” as “all Israeli civilian
communities built on lands occupied or otherwise administered by Israel during its second
occupation (post-1967 Six-Day War) . . .” and the “OPT” as “[East Jerusalem], the West Bank,
Gaza, and other Palestinian territory.” 3 AC at 11 nn.1 & 2. Throughout, the Complaint employs
politically charged terms that highlight the political and diplomatic questions Plaintiffs would
have this Court adjudicate. In substance, Plaintiffs seek to litigate in U.S. court almost 50 years
of politically fraught relations between Israel and the Palestinian inhabitants of the West Bank
and Gaza.

2

We recite the salient allegations of the Complaint to show that, on their face, they
demonstrate that this is not a justiciable case or controversy. See, e.g., Doe I, 400 F. Supp. 2d at
112-14 (referencing complaint’s allegations to determine applicability of the political question
and act of state doctrines). Defendants do not accept the truth of these allegations.

All Defendants herein join fully in the legal arguments and relief sought in the Motion
and this Memorandum. However, some Defendants take issue with the usage of certain
terminology in describing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the words used to describe
the geographic area where the settlements are located, which they believe should be called Judea
and Samaria. The views of these Defendants are summarized in the attached Appendix A.
Nevertheless, in recognition of the fact that the Court’s task is to resolve a motion to dismiss and
not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the terms used in the Complaint are used herein.

Conduct By Israeli Settlers And The Israeli Government
The Complaint contends that, since 1967, Israeli settlers, aided by the IDF, have
“threaten[ed] and intimidate[d] the local Palestinian population on a daily basis,” resulting in
“the expulsion of approximately 400,000 Palestinians from the OPT” and “the demolition or
confiscation of 49,000 Palestinian homes,” as well as the denial of medical care and the
destruction of schools, mosques, and hospitals in the West Bank and Gaza. AC at 16 & ¶¶ 78,
92, 176. Plaintiffs further allege that settlers have committed a long list of misdeeds, including
“daily violent attacks on Palestinian homeowners and farmers, . . . the slaughtering of livestock
and the poisoning of water wells and destruction of electric grids, . . . [and] devastation of the
Palestinian agricultural sector, especially destruction of olive groves . . . .” 4 AC ¶ 79. The
purported goal of the alleged conspiracy is “the expulsion of all non-Jews from [the] OPT and
the creation of new segregated ‘Jewish-only’ cities and villages.” AC at 12. The Complaint
alleges that the founding and expansion of settlements have been encouraged by the Israeli
government since “Prime Minister Sharon’s advice to seize any and all Palestinian-owned
hilltops” forty years ago, AC ¶ 120, and asserts that, while settlement activity is illegal under
Israeli and international law and has been condemned by U.S. policymakers, it has been
consistently condoned by Israel throughout this period through the active participation of the
Israeli army in the alleged illegal activity. AC at 16.
The Plaintiffs
Plaintiffs claim to be American citizens or Palestinian nationals whose relatives, or
themselves, allegedly have suffered physical injury, death, or property damage or loss as a result

The Complaint extensively quotes from a 2012 book entitled Our Harsh Logic, see, e.g.,
AC at 13 n.9, 30 & ¶¶ 89, 187-189, 205, 208, which is a compilation by an advocacy group of
stories allegedly told by anonymous Israeli soldiers.

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 16 of 39

of Israeli settlement activity. AC ¶ 29. Only a few of Plaintiffs are alleged to be American
citizens; the others are apparently Palestinians, but many are unnamed altogether, being merely
referred to as a “Village Council” or as a family who allegedly suffered damages represented by
a named Plaintiff. AC ¶ 29; see also caption.
While disclaiming a challenge to IDF confiscations or a request that the Court resolve the
legality of the settlements or Palestinians’ “right to return to their homeland,” AC at 30,
Plaintiffs nonetheless seek $1 billion in damages (reduced from $34.5 billion in the original
complaint) from Defendants based on injuries alleged to have been suffered by Palestinians
generally as a result of “heinous war crimes committed by IDF personnel in the OPT” and
establishment of settlements in the West Bank encouraged by Israeli government officials. See,
e.g., AC at 30-31 & ¶¶ 29, 80-81, 83, 85, 88, 91. Strikingly, no attempt is made to link any harm
suffered by a particular Plaintiff to the conduct of any particular Defendant. 5 Rather, the
Complaint asserts in generic and conclusory terms injuries such as unpaid rent; loss of
unidentified businesses owned by unspecified individuals; loss of unidentified infrastructure
improvements; theft of unidentified land, both by settlers and in connection with the separation
wall and roads built by the Israeli government; costs of counseling services for “thousands of
traumatized Palestinian children”; the destruction of “thousands of homes”; and deaths of
unspecified relatives. AC at 30-31.
Typical of this generic and improper pleading technique is the allegation that Plaintiffs
and/or their unnamed relatives suffered “loss of loved ones including children, destruction of
5

Attached to the Complaint is an Exhibit C that is titled “Plaintiff’s [sic] Initial Damages
Database” and purports to describe individual Plaintiffs’ damages. It fails, however, except in
wholly conclusory fashion, to link any particular Plaintiff’s injury with any particular
Defendant’s conduct. Instead, it simply repeats formulaic accusations that various categories of
Defendants either donated or transferred funds to generally unidentified persons who allegedly
caused an injury.
5

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 17 of 39

homes, destruction of revenue-producing arable property, poisoning of water wells, slaughtering
of livestock, destruction of electric grids, diminished water supply capacity, and destruction of
schools, mosques and hospitals” as “the direct and proximate result” of Defendants’ conspiracy.
AC ¶ 176. What is alleged, in short, are generalized grievances by “Palestinians” as a group,
over the course of decades, which have little or nothing to do with the alleged injuries suffered
by identified Plaintiffs described in Exhibit C.
The Defendants
Defendants in this case are not the unidentified settlers or IDF members who allegedly
have committed those wrongs. Rather, they are a number of U.S. individuals, U.S. tax-exempt
charities, foreign banks, and U.S. or foreign corporations that allegedly have “knowingly”
supported Israeli settlers’ activities for decades in connection with the expansion of settlements.
AC ¶¶ 33-77. None of the named Defendants is alleged to have engaged in any violent actions
causing personal injuries in the West Bank and Gaza or elsewhere, nor is alleged to have taken,
forcefully or otherwise, any property from any Plaintiff or other unidentified Palestinian. 6
Defendants instead, at most, are alleged to be secondarily liable for the actions of
unidentified settlers or soldiers simply by virtue of their financial or moral support or provision
of routine banking and commercial services or products to these persons. Supposedly, based on
“common knowledge,” public statements by media, NGOs, and international organizations (and,
in the case of the banks, alleged “know your customer protocols”), Defendants “know” that such
support “causes” criminal mistreatment of Palestinians. AC ¶¶ 151, 205, 212. In substance, and
shorn of its pejorative rhetoric, the Complaint alleges that Defendants should be held liable either
6

The Complaint does state that Defendant Jewish National Fund participated in
unspecified “physical destruction of many villages” and “military operations,” AC ¶ 54. This
lone conclusory allegation is so vague and non-specific that it cannot be considered “well-pled”
under any standard.
6

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 18 of 39

for donating or raising funds for U.S. tax-exempt charitable organizations that, in turn, donate
money to settlements and IDF veterans, advocating in support of Israeli settlement policies, or
engaging in normal business transactions with settlers, settlements, and parts of the Israeli
government that, in turn, allegedly promote settlement expansion – all without any allegation
that Defendants direct or control the actions of either these settlers, settlements, or the Israeli
state. AC ¶¶ 32-77.
The Complaint groups Defendants into five categories. 7 The first category is comprised
of eight individuals and one foundation based in the U.S. who allegedly donated funds to U.S.
tax-exempt entities (“Donor Defendants”). 8 See AC ¶¶ 32-40. Plaintiffs allege that Donor
Defendants “share a pro-Zionist agenda and are dedicated to doing anything they can to promote
the growth of settlements in the OPT.” AC ¶ 32. Equating settlement support with criminal
conduct, the Complaint asserts that “individual donors knew and intended that their donations”
would be used in support of illegal settler or IDF activities, AC ¶ 105, that “necessarily entail the
ethnic cleansing of all Palestinian families living near OPT settlements,” AC ¶ 32. The
Complaint (including the newly added Exhibit C) does not contain any non-conclusory factual
allegations of any specific donation by a Donor Defendant, or the transmission of any such
donation to a specified recipient, that caused any alleged injury to any Plaintiff.

7

Not all Defendants are named in all counts, and the allegations differ even as to
Defendants in the same “group.” The issues on Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) motion are
sufficiently common to all Defendants such that, in this consolidated brief, it is unnecessary to
discuss the particular allegations against each Defendant.
8

The Donor Defendants are Sheldon Adelson, Norman Braman, Lawrence Ellison, Daniel
Gilbert, John Hagee, Lev Leviev, Irving Moskowitz, Haim Saban, and the Irving I. Moskowitz
Foundation. AC ¶¶ 32-40.
7

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 19 of 39

The second category, identified in the Complaint as “Settlement and IDF
Advocate/Promoter,” is comprised of one person, Defendant Elliott Abrams (“Abrams”),
represented in this action by the U.S. Government. AC ¶ 41.
The third category of Defendants is comprised of thirteen U.S. tax-exempt charitable
entities (“Charitable Entity Defendants”) that allegedly provided funds to support settlement
expansion by transferring money to Israeli settlements and in support of the IDF. 9 AC ¶¶ 42-54.
Plaintiffs – again asking the Court to subscribe to their mantra that settlements are inherently
criminal – claim that these transfers of funds were conducted “knowing that those funds would
be used by settlement leaders to arm the local settlement population and have them engage in
ethnic cleansing and wanton property destruction . . .,” as well as to enable the IDF to commit
purported war crimes. AC ¶¶ 103, 215-216. Among these generalizations, the Complaint
alleges that Charitable Entity Defendants “partially financed the [Israeli government’s] Second
(2008) and Third (2014) Gaza Invasions” – armed conflicts between Israeli troops and rocketfiring terrorist groups designated as such by the U.S. – through donations to support the IDF.
AC ¶ 216. As with Donor Defendants, the Complaint does not contain any non-conclusory
factual allegations regarding any specific money transfers to a particular recipient that related to
any alleged injury suffered by any Plaintiff.

9

Charitable Entity Defendants are American Friends of Ariel, American Friends of Bet El
Yeshiva, American Friends of Har Homa, American Friends of Ulpana Ofra, Christian Friends of
Israeli Communities, Efrat Development Foundation, Falic Family Foundation, Friends of the
Israel Defense Forces, Gush Etzion Foundation, Honenu National Legal Defense Organization,
Karnei Shomron Foundation, The Hebron Fund, and the Jewish National Fund. AC ¶¶ 42-54.
American Friends of Har Homa is listed in the case caption, a single footnote, and the
“illustrative” “Causal Chain of Damages for Har Homa Plaintiffs,” but is not referenced in any
allegation made by Plaintiffs or included in the “Defendants” section of the AC. AC at 4, 18.
8

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 20 of 39

The fourth category of Defendants is comprised of three banks (“Bank Defendants”). 10
AC ¶¶ 55-56. The Complaint makes conclusory allegations that Bank Defendants transferred
funds from unidentified customers to similarly unidentified settlements for the purpose of
encouraging settlement expansion. AC ¶¶ 55-56, 109. However, it lacks any allegation
regarding any specific transfer of funds by the Bank Defendants, and it does not identify any
specific transferor or recipient. The Complaint does not even contain any factual allegation that
identifies which particular Donor or Charitable Entity Defendant (if any) deposited funds with
which Bank Defendant (if any) or transferred funds through which Bank Defendant (if any).
The Complaint alleges that, “[b]ased on the banking protocol ‘Know Your Customer,’
[Bank Defendants’] officials knew exactly what the funds would be used for . . . promotion of
wholesale violence, arms trafficking, ethnic cleansing, theft and malicious property destruction.”
AC ¶ 109. But there is no allegation, nor could there be, that “Know Your Customer” rules
require banks to fully investigate the recipient of funds transferred from a customer or to “know”
the use to which a particular funds transfer would be put by them. The only requirements are to
take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient is not a sanctioned entity or individual and to
report suspicions of unlawful activity. Notably, none of Defendants is alleged to have violated
any sanctions imposed by the U.S. by sending funds, or otherwise directly or indirectly giving
support, to any sanctioned individual or organization.
Finally, Bank Defendants also are alleged to have engaged in other routine business
activity purportedly in support of settlement expansion, including operating bank branches and
ATMs in settlement areas, AC ¶ 240, discussing the financing of construction projects involving
settlements, AC ¶ 135, and “offering essential banking services and below-rate long-term
10

Bank Defendants are Bank Leumi Le-Israel, Bank Leumi USA, and Bank Hapoalim. AC
¶¶ 55-56.
9

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 21 of 39

mortgage financing to settler customers,” AC ¶ 152. Again, there is no allegation relating these
activities to any alleged injury suffered by a particular Plaintiff.
The last category of Defendants is comprised of U.S., international, and Israeli
corporations (collectively, “Construction/Support Defendants”), eight of which allegedly provide
construction, real estate development, and infrastructure services to settlements in the West Bank
and eleven of which allegedly provide support services and products to other Defendant
companies, the settlements (such as security-related services and products), or the Israeli
government (such as buses and equipment for Israeli prisons and military technology for the
Israeli army allegedly used in the so-called “Gaza invasions”). 11 AC ¶¶ 57-77. None of the
Complaint’s allegations states any facts that connect these Defendants’ business activities to any
alleged injury suffered by a Plaintiff.
Plaintiffs’ Claims
Plaintiffs set forth their claims in four Counts. In Count I, Plaintiffs allege a civil
conspiracy “to expel all non-Jews from the OPT.” AC at 103. Count I claims that “U.S.

11

Construction/Support Defendants are RE/MAX, LLC, RE/MAX Israel – Impact Property
Developers Ltd., Africa Israel Investments, Ltd., AFI USA, Danya Cebus Ltd., Veolia
Environnement S.A., Veolia North America, LLC, Veolia Environmental S.A. (Israel) Ltd., G4S
PLC, G4S North America, G4S Israel, Volvo Group, Volvo Bussar AB, Merkavim
Transportation Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Hewlett-Packard (Israel) Ltd.
(collectively, “HPE”), Motorola Solutions, Inc., Motorola Solutions Israel Ltd., and Orbital
ATK, Inc. AC ¶¶ 57-77.
Six additional companies are mentioned in the Complaint, but Plaintiffs do not appear to
press any claims against them. The Court already has dismissed one, Hanson Israel, Ltd., see
Dec. 15, 2015 Order, Dkt. 97, and the Complaint should be summarily dismissed as to the rest.
Two companies – Access Industries and CRH PLC – are listed in the caption but have been
deleted from the “Defendants” section. See AC ¶¶ 57-77. There is only a single footnoted
allegation with respect to these two Defendants – claiming that they engaged in unspecified
lobbying activities in the U.S. See AC ¶ 19 & n.63. Another three companies – Readymix
Industries (Israel) Ltd., Nesher Israel Cement Enterprises, and HeidelbergCement AG – were
deleted from the caption as well as the “Defendants” discussion, but are referenced in scattershot
allegations throughout the body of the Complaint.
10

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 22 of 39

donor/entities and their co-conspirators, including [Elliot] Abrams and [Bank Leumi
Le-Israel/Bank Hapoalim’s] U.S. employees, have all conspired to encourage, raise, solicit,
contribute, or transfer significant sums overseas to promote settlement expansion,” knowing that
those funds would be used, inter alia, to “arm the settler population with military hardware” and
“encourage militia members, with the assistance of IDF/G4S personnel, to terrorize and violently
expel their Palestinian neighbor[s] who were peacefully occupying nearby property tracts that the
settlement leaders coveted.” AC ¶ 127. Plaintiffs further allege in Count I that
“construction/support firms . . . made it possible for the settlements to thrive and expand” by,
inter alia, “destroy[ing] Palestinian villages . . . and buil[ding] expensive housing developments,
shopping malls, and infrastructure improvements (tunnels, highways, light rail, solid waste
facilities) on private Palestinian property.” AC ¶ 130.
In Count II, Plaintiffs allege “war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.” AC at
145. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants named in this count are “war criminals” who “funded,
promoted, encouraged, assisted, and facilitated wholesale violence, ethnic cleansing, arms
trafficking, malicious wounding of their Palestinian neighbors, and theft and destruction of
private property.” AC ¶ 182; see also, e.g., AC ¶ 186. Plaintiffs separately allege “aiding and
abetting the commission of war crimes” in Count III, AC at 180, which “relies upon and
specifically tracks the allegations made in Count II, i.e., the commission of war crimes,” AC
¶ 228. Finally, in Count IV, Plaintiffs allege an “aggravated and ongoing trespass against all
defendants who have been trespassing on private Palestinian property during the occupation.”
AC at 184.
The Complaint asserts, in generic and sweeping terms, that the expansion of settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza over several decades would not have occurred without the

11

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 23 of 39

“knowing” conduct of Defendants, see, e.g., AC ¶¶ 83, 86, and that “each one of the Plaintiffs
named herein can trace the cause of his damages from violent settlers in nearby settlements back
through Israel-based settlements and their bank accounts to U.S. 501(c)(3) entities and wealthy
U.S. donors,” AC at 17. But there is no non-conclusory allegation that any one of Defendants
did anything except to somehow “support” Israel, and, in particular, the Israeli army, Israeli
settlers, settlements, and settlement policies – that is to say, Plaintiffs are asking the Court to take
one side, rather than the other, in a highly controversial political dispute that has gone on for
years without diplomatic resolution. This is quintessentially the stuff of politics and decisionmaking by the political branches of our Government, and not of judicial adjudication.
ARGUMENT
THE POLITICAL QUESTION AND ACT OF STATE DOCTRINES BAR ALL OF
PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS
The Complaint fails to state a justiciable claim against any of Defendants and should be
dismissed in its entirety pursuant to both the political question doctrine and the act of state
doctrine. The Complaint calls into question and asks this Court to substitute its judgment for the
delicate policy decisions and choices made by the governments of Israel and the U.S. during the
course of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the half century since the 1967 Six-Day War.
In order for Plaintiffs to obtain relief on any of the Counts, the Court necessarily would
have to make an adjudicative determination that Israel does not have sovereign rights over the
disputed land where the settlements are located, notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ acknowledgement
that the “settlements” are comprised of land that the Israeli government has “occupied” or
“administered.” See AC at 11 n.1. The Court also would have to make an adjudicative
determination that the funding of settlement activity and related Israeli military activity, as well
as the performance of construction and other services in the West Bank and Gaza, are unlawful.
12

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 24 of 39

Further, for Plaintiffs to obtain relief on their ATS claims, the Court would have to make
adjudicative determinations on whether the Israeli activities in the West Bank and Gaza
constitute international crimes, including “war crimes,” “genocide,” and “ethnic cleansing.” For
Plaintiffs to obtain relief on Count IV, the Court again would have to adjudicate whether the
settlement activity in the West Bank is tortious in nature under U.S. law.
The Court is thus explicitly invited by Plaintiffs to step into the middle of what is both an
internal Israeli political controversy and a major international political dispute and to add its own
policy views to those of the U.S. Executive Branch and Congress, which have been wrestling
with how to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute for decades. Courts lack jurisdiction over
inherently “political” questions, such as these, which arise out of and are intertwined with
sensitive issues of foreign policy, and actions that challenge the acts of a recognized sovereign
state taken within its own territory. The Court cannot resolve the questions outlined above
without making pronouncements on, and thereby interjecting itself into, sensitive and complex
foreign policy issues that are the province of the Executive and Legislative Branches.
Furthermore, the Court cannot resolve these issues without judging the sovereign actions of the
Israeli government taken within its own territory or otherwise in the context of armed conflicts.
For all these reasons, the Complaint fails to state a justiciable claim against any of Defendants
under the political question and act of state doctrines.
A.

Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Justiciable Under The Political Question Doctrine

Under the political question doctrine, federal courts may not resolve “controversies which
revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution
to the halls of Congress or the confines of the Executive Branch.” El-Shifa Pharm. Indus. Co. v.
United States, 607 F.3d 839, 840 (D.C. Cir. 2010). The political question doctrine is rooted in
the Constitutional separation of powers and recognizes that decisions clearly committed to the
13

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 25 of 39

political branches of the Government are non-justiciable. The seminal decision on the political
question doctrine is Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), in which the Supreme Court held that a
question is political and therefore non-justiciable when any one of the following six factors is
present:
[1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a
coordinate political department, or
[2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it, or
[3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind
clearly for non-judicial discretion, or
[4] the impossibility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution without
expressing a lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government, or
[5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already
made, or
[6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by
various departments on one question.
369 U.S. at 217. Virtually all these factors apply directly to Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
1.

The Issues Raised In The Complaint Previously Have Been Deemed
Political Questions Under Baker v. Carr

The application of the political question doctrine to claims like these, stemming from the
decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, already has been confirmed in this
district. In Doe I, Palestinian plaintiffs filed a complaint remarkably similar to this one, asserting
claims under the ATS, the Torture Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”), assorted international
conventions and agreements, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”),
and other laws, against the President and Secretary of State, the State of Israel, and a number of
its officials, including several generals of the army, a number of American defense contractors
and manufacturers, and so-called “settler defendants,” including a New Jersey congregation and
its rabbi, who allegedly raised funds for Israeli settlers in the West Bank. The court, in a lengthy
14

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 26 of 39

and carefully reasoned opinion by Judge Bates, dismissed the complaint as to all defendants
based, inter alia, on the political question and act of state doctrines. Doe I, 400 F. Supp. 2d at
96.
In finding that the plaintiffs’ complaint raised non-justiciable political questions, Judge
Bates wrote: “It is hard to conceive of an issue more quintessentially political in nature than the
ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has raged on the world stage with devastation for both
sides for decades.” Id. at 111-12. Judge Bates explained that the plaintiffs’ claims “would have
this Court adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the Palestinian and Israeli people,” requiring
determinations (i) regarding “to whom the land in the West Bank actually belongs,” (ii) “that
Israel’s self-defense policies are tantamount to terrorism,” (iii) “that the Israeli settlement
activities are illegal or tortious,” and (iv) “characteriz[ing] the ongoing armed conflict in the
West Bank as either ‘genocide’ . . . or self-defense.” Id. at 112. The court found that it could not
rule on these issues:
The Court can do none of this. Whether plaintiffs dress their claims in the garb of
RICO or other federal statutes, or the tort laws of various states, the character of
those claims is, at its core, the same: peculiarly volatile, undeniably political, and
ultimately nonjusticiable. A ruling on any of these issues would draw the Court
into the foreign affairs of the United States, thereby interfering with the sole
province of the Executive Branch.
Id. The court further held that a conclusion that Israeli settlement activities are illegal or tortious
“would also implicitly condemn American foreign policy by suggesting that support of Israel is
wrongful. Conclusions like these present a potential for discord between the branches that
further demonstrates the impropriety of a judicial decision on these quintessential political
issues.” Id.
These findings and assessments by Judge Bates in Doe I are equally applicable in this
case. Plaintiffs seek a U.S. judicial determination that Israeli activities in the West Bank and
15

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 27 of 39

Gaza constitute unlawful activity (Count I), war crimes (Counts II and III), and aggravated and
ongoing trespass (Count IV). All of these Counts rest on the notion that Israeli settlement
activities have taken place on Palestinian land and resulted in “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide”
of Palestinian nationals, as well as “malicious theft and destruction of property” belonging to
Palestinians. See generally AC at 11-32 (Introduction/Summary). All of Plaintiffs’ alleged
injuries as described in Exhibit C arise from those activities or Israeli military activities during
armed conflicts in the West Bank and Gaza. See generally Ex. C. Like the claims found
non-justiciable in Doe I, Plaintiffs’ claims would improperly require the Court to decide “to
whom the land in the West Bank actually belongs,” to declare “that the Israeli settlement
activities are illegal or tortious,” and to “characterize the ongoing armed conflict in the West
Bank as [] ‘genocide.’” 400 F. Supp. 2d at 112. As in Doe I, the claims set forth in the
Complaint are non-justiciable as to all Defendants.
2.

The Baker v. Carr Factors Confirm That Plaintiffs’ Complaint Raises
Non-Justiciable Political Questions

The political climate has not changed meaningfully since the Doe I decision, other than to
have become, if anything, even more politicized, volatile, and complicated. Accordingly, the
Baker v. Carr factors require that the Complaint be dismissed.
First, the conduct of foreign policy, which is at the heart of this case, unquestionably is
committed to the political branches of the Federal Government. Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292
(1981) (“Matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper
subjects for judicial intervention.”); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 589 (1952)
(observing that matters relating “to the conduct of foreign relations . . . are so exclusively
entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry
or interference”). America’s policy toward the State of Israel and Israel’s conflict with the
16

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 28 of 39

Palestinians are among the most delicate and vexing foreign policy issues of our time and have
been so for decades. The U.S. Government has provided over $100 billion in aid to Israel during
the past 20 years, including over $40 billion in grants for its military forces, and the U.S. State
Department recently announced additional grants of $38 billion in military aid over the next 10
years. 12 Every President and Secretary of State during the last 40 years has tried to find a
delicate balance that provides a path to peace between Israel and its neighbors and protects U.S.
national interests. Recent debates concerning the United Nations Security Council’s resolution
on Israeli settlements further reinforce the political nature of the issues. What the Supreme Court
recently said concerning Jerusalem in Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2081
(2015), is equally applicable to the West Bank and Gaza:
Questions touching upon the history of the ancient city and its present legal and
international status are among the most difficult and complex in international
affairs. In our constitutional system those matters are committed to the
Legislature and the Executive, not the judiciary.
Second, as noted above, Plaintiffs contend that the activities of Israeli settlers and the
Israeli armed forces constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The
government of Israel and others take an opposite view. They advocate that the settlers’ activities
constitute lawful economic development, and its military’s activities constitute lawful
self-defense against persons and organizations who have publicly advocated for the destruction

of Israel. Regardless of how any litigant or this Court might view this dispute along any point
between the ends of this political spectrum, the simple fact remains that this dispute is a political
question that this forum cannot resolve: U.S. courts are simply in no position to find “judicially
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving” these disputed issues. Baker, 369 U.S. at
217. These issues would require the Court “to measure and balance a myriad of thorny foreign
and domestic political considerations,” rendering them “inherently political” questions that
cannot be resolved by the law of torts or other statutory law. Schneider v. Kissinger, 310
F. Supp. 2d 251, 262 (D.D.C. 2004); accord Doe I, 400 F. Supp. 2d at 112-13.
Third, the Court cannot decide the issues raised in the Complaint without rendering
“initial policy determination[s] of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.” Baker, 369 U.S. at
217 (factor 3). To grant Plaintiffs relief, the Court would have to characterize the conflict in the
West Bank and Gaza and the actions of the Israeli government (through the IDF or in
constructing infrastructure, such as the separation wall, see AC ¶¶ 91-92) as “genocide” and
“ethnic cleansing,” and the construction and development activities performed by certain
Defendants as “aggravated trespass” and “malicious destruction of property.” The entire
Complaint depends upon the notion that each of the activities alleged to underlie Plaintiffs’
claims – donations and fundraising for lawful entities, political advocacy, and normal banking
and commercial transactions with counterparties that have not been sanctioned by the U.S.
Government – becomes unlawful because Plaintiffs allege that any dealings with Israeli
settlements, settlers, or armed forces are ipso facto violations of international law or otherwise
inherently unlawful. It is hard to imagine a more blatant case of a court being asked to make a
political judgment on matters that our legal system properly leaves to the political branches. See
Corrie v. Caterpillar, Inc., 503 F.3d 974, 984 (9th Cir. 2007) (dismissing ATS case against

18

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 30 of 39

Caterpillar for selling to the Israeli army bulldozers used to demolish Palestinian homes in the
West Bank because “[a]llowing this action to proceed would necessarily require the judicial
branch of our government to question the political branches’ decision to grant extensive military
aid to Israel”).
Fourth and fifth, Plaintiffs call for a judgment by this Court that, if granted, would
express “a lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government” and raise “the potentiality
of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.”
Baker, 369 U.S. at 217 (factors 4 & 6). Executive Branch officials and members of Congress
consistently voice support for the Israeli government, 13 and, while they have tried to walk a fine
line on activities in the West Bank and Gaza, they have never suggested that support for Israeli
settlements is illegal – which this Court would have to do to find in favor of Plaintiffs. For
example, the U.S. voted against U.N. General Assembly Resolution 66/225, dated March 29,
2012, which stated that Israeli settlements are contrary to international law and Israel’s legal
obligations, 14 and it abstained on the recent U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, dated

the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of
peace.” 15 Any judgment from a U.S. court suggesting that settlement activity is unlawful,
criminal, or tortious surely would serve only as a prop to be brandished by opponents of U.S.
policy in the U.N. and elsewhere. 16 Such action could only undermine coordinate branches of
Government and further complicate an already very difficult and delicate political situation.
It would also undermine the Legislative Branch. In the TFTEA, Congress prohibited
domestic courts from recognizing or enforcing foreign civil judgments entered against U.S.
persons and entities doing business in Israel (including “any territory controlled by Israel”) or
with Israeli entities if the judgment is based in whole or part on a determination that such
business dealings constitute a violation of law. See TFTEA § 909(e). It would be entirely
incongruous if Plaintiffs could obtain a judgment from a U.S. court based on a determination that
doing business with Israel or Israeli settlements was illegal, where the same court would be
barred from enforcing such a judgment if Plaintiffs had pressed their suit overseas.

agreement? Unfortunately, this draft resolution risks hardening the positions of both
sides. . . . While we agree with our fellow Council members – and indeed, with the wider
world – about the folly and illegitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity, we think it
unwise for this Council to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide Israelis and
Palestinians.”).

East’s delicate diplomacy”).

Further, the decisions each and every year by the President to request, and Congress to
authorize, financial support to the military forces of Israel reflect a judgment that the interests of
the U.S. warrant such support and that it is consistent with American values. 17 Plaintiffs are
asking this Court to determine that alleged general financial support to those same military forces
by Defendants constitutes participation in war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
Such a decision would implicitly condemn the consistent policy decisions of the Executive and
Legislative Branches over the past several decades.
Finally, the President has exercised his power under laws enacted by Congress to deal
with “grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace
process.” Exec. Order No. 12,947, 60 Fed. Reg. 5079 (Jan. 25, 1995). That order prohibits
donations by U.S. persons to persons or organizations specified in or pursuant to the order. The
list includes Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, but it does
not include the Israeli army, Israeli settlements, or anyone claimed in the Complaint to have
engaged in terrorism. 18 Plaintiffs make the patently false claim that a donor’s financial support
to IDF soldiers “directly contravenes this Executive Order.” AC ¶ 97(e). On the contrary, the
order reflects a determination by the President as to what organizations in the Middle East may
not receive contributions by Americans because of their acts of terrorism, and the President has
not included the organizations alleged to have received donations in this case. In effect,
Plaintiffs seek to have a court overrule the President’s determination, which he is exclusively
authorized to make. Such a judicial decision would not only intrude upon the authority of the

continued in effect by President Obama on January 20, 2016 (Notice No. 2016-01427, 81 Fed.

political branches to conduct foreign affairs, but would also present the final description of a
political question in Baker – one presenting “the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious
pronouncements by various departments on one question.” 369 U.S. at 217.
The Supreme Court has stated that the existence of any one of the six Baker factors
requires dismissal. Id. Here, where five of the six factors are clearly present, there can be no
doubt that this Complaint must be dismissed under the political question doctrine. 19
B.

Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Justiciable Under The Act Of State Doctrine

The act of state doctrine also precludes all of Plaintiffs’ claims. The act of state doctrine
prevents U.S. courts from inquiring into the validity of public acts committed by a foreign
sovereign within its own territory. Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 401
(1964); accord World Wide Minerals Ltd .v. Republic of Kazakhstan, 296 F.3d 1154, 1164-65
(D.C. Cir. 2002). The doctrine applies “when the outcome of the case turns upon [] the effect of
official action by a foreign sovereign.” W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Envtl. Tectonics Corp., Int’l,
493 U.S. 400, 407 (1990). Like the political question doctrine, the act of state doctrine is rooted

19

The reasoning set forth in Doe I and the facts detailed above fundamentally distinguish
the instant case from those such as Biton v. The Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority,
310 F. Supp. 2d 172 (D.D.C. 2004) and 412 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2005). The court in Biton
held justiciable a suit against the Palestinian Authority and others for a terrorist attack under the
Anti-Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2331 et seq. (the “ATA”), because it was an “ordinary tort suit”
that could be judicially resolved based on the statutory definition of “international terrorism” and
the common law of tort and presented no separation of powers concerns since the Executive and
Legislative Branches had “‘expressly endorsed’” suits against terrorist organizations by enacting
the ATA. 310 F. Supp. 2d. at 175, 184. In that case and others like it, the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict was the contextual backdrop and perhaps the motivation for the defendants’ alleged
unlawful acts, but it was not the central issue for resolution. By contrast, the foundation of
Plaintiffs’ claims here is the proposition that they own land allegedly unlawfully seized and
settled by Israel and that their injuries were allegedly inflicted by the Israeli military and settlers
during Israel’s purportedly wrongful occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Resolution of these
issues would require the Court to directly decide the core issues that lie at the heart of the
political conflict, namely, the proper owners of the disputed land in the West Bank and Gaza and
the legitimacy of Israel’s self-defense and settlement policies and activities.
22

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 34 of 39

in the Constitutional separation of powers, “reflecting ‘the strong sense of the Judicial Branch
that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder’ the
conduct of foreign affairs.” W.S. Kirkpatrick, 493 U.S. at 405 (quoting Banco Nacional de
Cuba, 376 U.S. at 423).
An essential question – indeed, the essential question – raised in Plaintiffs’ Complaint is
the propriety of decades of Israeli activities in the West Bank and Gaza. That issue underlies all
Counts of the Complaint. The applicability of the act of state doctrine to such Israeli activities in
the West Bank and Gaza already has been confirmed by the Doe I court, which found that
“federal courts have long recognized that the exploitation of natural resources and land within a
nation’s own borders is, by legal definition, an act of state.” 400 F. Supp. 2d at 114. Notably,
while the plaintiffs in Doe I disputed whether the challenged actions occurred within Israel’s
“borders,” Judge Bates found that this argument itself “raises a political question – the court is
not competent to adjudicate whether the West Bank, in dispute for decades, belongs to the
Israelis or the Palestinians.” Id. at 114 n.6. The court held that the defendants’ alleged taking of
land for the use of Israel and its people was an act “of the Israeli state, through individual actors
carrying out the mandate of the state for its benefit.” Id.
Plaintiffs here ask the Court to find that the alleged financial support provided to
settlements and the IDF by the Donor and Charitable Entity Defendants, purportedly through the
Bank Defendants, and the services allegedly provided in the West Bank and Gaza by
Construction/Support Defendants constitute war crimes, trespass, and other tortious and criminal
activity. Deciding these claims would require the Court to “adjudicate sensitive issues of a
political nature that would offend notions of international comity,” which it cannot do under the
act of state doctrine. Id. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that Defendants are private

23

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 35 of 39

actors rather than the State of Israel and its officials or the fact that the Complaint, in part, targets
the actions of “armed settlers” that allegedly were supported or encouraged by certain
Defendants. 20 See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 79, 87, 96. In this respect, the instant case is no different from
Glen v. Club Mediterranée, S.A., 450 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir. 2006), in which the plaintiffs brought
state law claims of trespass and unjust enrichment against a hotel chain as a result of its
operation of a resort on land that the Cuban government had expropriated from plaintiffs. The
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision dismissing the
plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the act of state doctrine. Id. at 1252. The Eleventh Circuit found
that the plaintiffs’ claims were “predicated on their continued ownership” of the property and
therefore “[t]he validity of the Cuban government’s act of expropriation is directly at issue in this
litigation.” Id. at 1254 (emphasis in original).
As recognized both in Doe I and by Plaintiffs here, the land on which Israeli settlements
have been built is land to which the Israeli government has laid claim. 400 F. Supp. 2d at 114;
AC at 11 n.1 (“The term ‘settlements’ includes all Israeli civilian communities built on lands
occupied or otherwise administered by Israel during its second occupation . . . .”) (emphasis
added). Defendants that are alleged to have developed and funded the development of land in
the West Bank have done so in connection with actions of the Israeli government. Yet,
Plaintiffs’ claims depend on the notion that Palestine has sovereign rights over the land in
question. This is not a justiciable dispute for a federal court to resolve.
20

Plaintiffs’ allegations differ from those found not to raise act of state issues in cases like
W.S. Kirkpatrick and Abu Ali v. Ashcroft, 350 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 2004). In those cases, the
issue was not the legality of conduct by a foreign government but rather the role that non-foreign
entities played in “obtaining” or “procuring” the actions of the foreign government. See W.S.
Kirkpatrick, 493 U.S. at 406; Abu Ali, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 59. The Complaint does not allege –
nor could it – that Defendants obtained or procured Israeli government actions in the West Bank
and Gaza; rather, it is based on the notion that these settlements themselves are illegal and that
anything that helps the settlements is therefore also inherently illegal.
24

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 36 of 39

To a great extent, Plaintiffs rest their claims on support by Defendants for alleged actions
of the armed forces of the State of Israel. Indeed, as to Defendants Friends of the Israel Defense
Forces, Lawrence Ellison, and Haim Saban, their alleged financial support to the IDF is the sole
basis for Plaintiffs’ claims. For the Court to entertain these claims would necessarily require it to
adjudicate whether the Israeli armed forces engaged in war crimes or other tortious conduct on
Israeli soil, including second-guessing the legality of specific targeting and other real-time
military decisions under the laws of war. The Court has no jurisdiction to make these
adjudications under the act of state doctrine.
The acts of the military of a foreign nation within its own borders are classic acts of state.
In Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U.S. 250 (1897), the plaintiff – an American citizen – sued a
Venezuelan military commander who had allegedly assaulted and detained him in Venezuela.
Declaring that “the courts of one country will not sit in judgment of the acts of the government of
another,” id. at 252, the court held the damages lawsuit against the commander presented a
political question. In Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297 (1918), the Court reached the
same conclusion where an army general in revolutionary Mexico ordered the seizure of hides
from a dealer who refused to pay a tax levied for support of the army. After the hides were sold
by the army and shipped to the U.S., the plaintiff filed suit in replevin, claiming the hides were
its property which had been assigned to the Mexican dealer. Although neither Mexico nor any of
its officials was a defendant in the lawsuit, the Court held the seizure “was the action, in Mexico,
of the legitimate Mexican government when dealing with a Mexican citizen,” and “is not subject
to re-examination and modification by the courts of this country.” Id. at 311.
While the Complaint comments on misconduct by individual Israeli soldiers, it is
unquestionably the Israeli army itself, not rogue individuals, whose activity Plaintiffs ask the

25

Case 1:16-cv-00445-TSC Document 107 Filed 01/27/17 Page 37 of 39

Court to characterize as war crimes and genocide. Compare Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 69
F. Supp. 3d 75, 88 (D.D.C. 2014), where plaintiffs did not claim “that Exxon’s security forces,
while admittedly soldiers in the Indonesian military, injured them pursuant to official policies of
the GOI [government of Indonesia] or orders from military commanders.” Here, the support
provided by Friends of the Israel Defense Forces was allegedly to the army itself, not to any
particular soldiers. See, e.g., AC at 21 (Defendants “directly fund the Israeli army and the
criminal activities that its personnel have engaged in.”). Further, Plaintiffs cannot credibly argue
that the actions of the IDF in the territories occupied by Israel as a result of the 1967 Six-Day
War are not within its “borders” for purposes of the act of state doctrine. That argument was
made in Doe I, supra, and Judge Bates correctly noted that it “also raises a political question –
the court is not competent to adjudicate whether the West Bank, in dispute for decades, belongs
to the Israelis or the Palestinians.” 400 F. Supp. 2d at 114 n.6.
In sum, Plaintiffs seek rulings regarding the legitimacy of actions by a foreign sovereign,
and their case largely depends on the Court’s determinations of those questions. The Court
cannot make these determinations as they are constitutionally committed to the political branches
of our Government. Plaintiffs’ Complaint is therefore non-justiciable under the act of state
doctrine.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss the Complaint in its entirety with
prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).

APPENDIX A
Separately, Defendants Gush Etzion Foundation, American Friends of Ariel, American
Friends of Ulpana Ofra, Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Honenu National Legal
Defense Organization, The Hebron Fund, and the Efrat Development Foundation state as
follows: These Defendants object to the use of the terms “OPT” and “West Bank” in this case
and to the implied premise that suggests that the Plaintiffs enjoy any rights, let alone superior
rights, to Judea, Samaria, the City of Jerusalem, or any part of the land of Israel. This is another
reason why the current action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for lack of
justiciability under the political question doctrine. The area in question has been part of the
Jewish homeland, and constant home to an unbroken succession of Jewish people, for over 3,000
years. 1 For centuries, emissaries from the Land of Israel have engaged in collecting charitable
contributions from Jews and Gentiles the world over for the support of Jewish communities in
Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem, a time-honored practice that Plaintiffs allege the indigenous NGO
Defendants continue to engage in.
The entire area at the heart of this lawsuit was part of the territory acknowledged as and
earmarked for a Jewish homeland in 1920 at the San Remo Conference that drafted the League
of Nations Charter. Two years later, the League of Nations Mandate explicitly stated that the
Mandatory Power was responsible for putting into effect the Balfour Declaration 2 in favor of a
Jewish national home in Palestine, and that Jews have the right to settle anywhere therein,

including Judea, Samaria and all parts of Jerusalem. 3 That same year, a joint resolution of
Congress, H.J. Res. 360, unanimously endorsed the legality of the Mandate and confirmed the
irrevocable right of Jews to settle anywhere between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean
Sea. 4 In 1947, Israel agreed to the UN Partition Plan, as approved by the General Assembly and
recommended to the Security Council. The other relevant parties did not agree, however, and so
the Resolution was never acted upon and rendered a dead letter legally. 5 Israel was attacked by
the Arab world in 1948 and Jordan illegally attempted to annex Judea, Samaria and ancient
Jerusalem. 6 As a result, the legal status of Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem remained subject to the
terms of the League of Nations Mandate and therefore was preserved to this day by Article 80 of
the UN Charter. 7 In 1967, Israel liberated those territories in a clearly defensive war under
Article 51 of the UN Charter 8 thereby legitimately regaining full possession and control over
land it already had rights to. The volatile political nature of the issue addressed in this Appendix
alone should make it clear that this is, at the very least, a deeply political question.
