Where . . . the field which Congress is said to have preempted includes
areas that have been traditionally occupied by the States, congressional
intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest. Here, there is
not clear intent of Congress to occupy the field of immigration to the
exclusion of state regulation of labor and employment of migrant
workers. The Court concludes that the IRCA does not preempt
Plaintiff's claim for breach of contract with regard to the [H-2A]
clearance orders. [internal quotation and citation omitted]; 2008 WL
833055 at *13 (E.D.Wash., March 27, 2008), (attached hereto).

See De Canas y. Bica, 424 U.S. 351 (1976); see also cases cited in Plaintiffs'

Sur-Reply, Ct. Rec. 46.

Ill. PLAINTIFFS HAD NO MEANS TO APPEAL THE U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FINDINGS

In support of the claim that plaintiffs have no right of action under state
contract law, defendants have represented that Congress has provided H-2A
workers with exclusive recourse to administrative enforcement, including
review by the Secretary of Labor (Ct. Rec. 50, at 3, 4). Contrary to
defendants' representations, the administrative enforcement process provided
in 29 C.F.R. 0x00A7 501 ef seg. does not provide H-2A workers with any
opportunity for administrative review. Under this enforcement scheme, once
a worker has complained of work contract violations, it is completely within
DOL's discretion whether and how to conduct its investigation. 29 C.F.R 0x00A7
501.5 (a). Moreover, once DOL completes an investigation and makes a
determination, the Department notifies only the person against whom action is

being taken. 29 C.F.R. 0x00A7 501.31. See, Disadvantaged by Design: How the

Law Inhibits Agricultural Guest Workers From Enforcing Their Rights, 18
Hofstra Lab. & Emp. L.J. 575, 599 (2001). The affected worker does not
receive notice of the determination. Therefore, the worker also does not
receive notice of the right to request a hearing or the time and method for
requesting a hearing. 29 C.F.R. 0x00A7 501.32. Clearly, the administrative review
process provided in 29 C.F.R. 0x00A7 501 ef seg. is intended only for the use of the
employer or other person found to be in violation of the H-2A regulations.

If Congress had intended that the DOL enforcement scheme be the H-
2A workers' exclusive remedy for violations of their employment agreements
with employers, Congress would have said so clearly and explicitly and set up
an administrative process with meaningful procedural protections for workers.
In the absence of any indication of Congressional intent to strip H-2A
workers of their contract rights under state law, this Court should deny

defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims and allow plaintiffs the
