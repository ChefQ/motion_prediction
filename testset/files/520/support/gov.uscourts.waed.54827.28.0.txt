NATURE OF THE MOTION
The Defendants, Max and Ann Fernandez (hereinafter “Fernandez”), bring this

20

motion pursuant to FRCP 12(b). The Defendants assert that the Court lacks subject matter

21

jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ action for breach of contract (Third Cause of Action). The

22

other causes of action, including the actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (First Cause

23
24
25

of Action), and the state law claims under the Washington Wage and Hour Law (Second
Cause of Action) and Quantum Meruit (Fourth Cause of Action) flow from, and are based
upon, the breach of contract claim. As a result, the court also lacks subject matter
jurisdiction of those claims.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

2
3
4
5

The Plaintiffs are sheepherders admitted into the United States under an H-2A nonimmigrant visa that allows a foreign national to work in temporary or seasonal agricultural
work. The terms and conditions of such temporary work are governed by regulations
adopted by the United States Department of Labor. Congress entrusted the investigation and

6

enforcement of complaints and contracts under the H-2A program to the Secretary of the

7

Department of Labor. As a result there is a comprehensive statutory and regulatory

8

procedure in which complaints can be investigated and addressed. The procedure allows

9

enforcement by the Department of Labor and provides remedies, including recovery of

10

wages, specific performance, reinstatement, civil penalties, debarment, and increased bonds.

11

The statute specifically limits the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court to cases brought by

12
13
14

the United States. As a result, the appropriate method of resolving a claim of breach of
contract is before the Department of Labor and its administrative procedures, not the courts.
Since the other causes of action are predicated on the breach of the underlying contract, the
court also lacks subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.

SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
The Federal District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction possessing only the power

authorized by the Constitution and Congress. U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sect 2; Exon Mobile
Corp. V. Allpaita Services, Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 552 (2008); Bender v. Williamsport Area
School District. 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986) Federal Courts have no power to consider claims

21

for which they lack subject matter jurisdiction. Wang v. Fine Corp., 975 F.3d 1412, 1415 (9th

22

Cir., 1992) The courts must “presume that a cause of action lies outside this limited

23

jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting

24

jurisdiction.” Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).;

Document 28

Filed 10/20/11

In the Complaint, the Plaintiffs assert that jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

2

Federal courts have jurisdiction over those actions “arising under the Constitution, laws or

3

treaties of the United States.” In determining whether the Federal District Court has “arising

4

under” jurisdiction over a claim, it must be understood “the basic principle marking the

5
6

boundaries of federal question jurisdiction of the Federal District Court is the well-pleaded
complaint rule.” Metro Life Ins. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63 (1987); Calstar v. State
Compensation Ins., 636 F.3d 538, 541 (9th Cir. 2011)

7
8

Because the basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim is breach of contract, and enforcement of

9

such contracts is relegated to the U.S. Department of Labor, the Court lacks subject matter

10

jurisdiction. Metropolitan Life Insurance v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63 (1987); Watsonville

11

Lowes HIW Colstor v. State Compensation Ins., 636 F.3d 538, 541 (9th Cir., 2011) Under the

12

well pleaded complaint rule the Court must determine whether the right or immunity created

13
14

by the Constitution or laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of
the Plaintiffs’ cause of action.

15

In this case the Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon and flow from the allegations a

16

contract was breached (Complaint ¶ 66-75). The Plaintiffs were non-immigrant foreign

17

workers admitted by an H-2A visa under 8 U.S.C. § 1188 and the regulations adopted by the

18

Secretary of the Department of Labor. 20 CFR 655. 655.100 The Plaintiffs claim Fernandez

19

breached the contract with them by requiring them to engage in work that was outside the job

20

description. However, it is the Department of Labor, as authorized by statute and regulation,

21
22

that sets the job description, wages and conditions of employment receives, investigates and
prosecutes violations.

23

Congress delegated enforcement of regulations to the Secretary of the Department of

24

Labor. 8 U.S.C. § 1188(g)(2). The District Court’s jurisdiction was limited by Congress to

25

“causes of action…brought by the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1329.

Background

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (Pub. L. 82-414, 66 Stat 163, enacted
June 27, 1952) restricted immigration into the United States. The Act primarily governs
immigration to and citizenship in the United States. The Act, and its modifications, are

Temporary Agricultural Workers - H-2A Visas

An H-2A non-immigrant visa allows a foreign national entry into the United States
for temporary or seasonal agricultural work. 8 U.S.C. ' 1188. To qualify for H-2A nonimmigration classification, an employer must show to the Secretary of the Department of
Labor that (1) the job offered is of a temporary or seasonal nature, (2) the employer must
demonstrate that there are not sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualify and
available to do the temporary work, (3) the employer must show that the employment of H2A workers will not adversely affect wages and working conditions of similarly employed
U.S. workers. 8 U.S.C ' 1188.

13

1.

Failure to pay minimum wage under the Fair Labor
Standards Act;

2.

Failure to pay wages due under the employment contracts

3.

Breach of Employment Contact, the plaintiff should have
been paid at a different rate than the specified in the
contract;

4.

Quantum Meruit, the same claim as Breach of Contract;

5.

Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.

14

This motion addresses the first four (4) causes of action. Those claims all begin with and are

15

derived from a contract. The contract includes, by reference, the sheepherder job description

16

and the wage rate authorized by the special procedure. (Exhibit 2) The plaintiffs do not

17

claim that the wages specified by the special procedures and contract were not paid. Instead,

18
19

it is claimed the wage rate should have been different than that specified and paid because
they performed work outside the job description. (Complaint ¶ 41-44) The other claims
follow from that proposition.

The Washington Supreme Court has held that sheepherders are excluded for the
definition of employee contained in the State Wage and Hour Law because they sleep at the place
of employment and spend a substantial portion of work time subject to call. As such
sheepherders were not subject to the minium wage and overtime requirements of the state law.
Berrocal v Max Fernandez, 155 Wn.2d 585, 598 (2005). Sheepherders are exempt from the
FLSA by 20 CFR 655.120 (...@the employer must offer, advertise in its recruitment, and pay a
wage rate that is the highest of the ACWR, the prevailing hourly wage or piece rate, the agreed
upon collective bargaining wage or federal or state minium wage, except where a special
procedure is approved for an occupation or specific class of agricultural employment.@)

NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION EXISTS
Cort v Ash: The Method of Analysis

The fact that a federal statute may have been violated and some person harmed does
not automatically give rise to a private right of action “in favor of the person.” Cannon v.
University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 688 (1979) Congress did not provide a private right of

8

action in the Act. As noted above, Congress conferred authority upon the Secretary of

9

Department of Labor and limited the Federal District Court=s jurisdiction.

10
11

The Supreme Court has created a four factor test for determining the existence of an

12

implied right of action Ain a statute not expressly providing one.@ Cort v Ash, 422 U.S. 66

13

(1975). A court determining whether a private right of action is implied in a statute must

14

consider:

15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26

1.

Whether the plaintiff is Aone of the class for whose
especial benefit the statute was enacted@;

2.

Whether Athere [is] any indication of legislative intent,
explicit or implicit, either to create such remedy or deny
one@;

3.

Whether a cause of action is Aconsistent with the
underlying purposes of the legislative scheme@ and;

4.

Whether Athe cause of action [is] one traditionally
relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of
states, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of
action based solely on federal law.@
Cort, 422 U.S. at 78.

In subsequent cases, the Supreme Court went further to note that each of the factors is not
equal in weight. In Touche Ross & Co. v Reddington, 442 U.S. 560 (1975) the Court said
Athe central inquiry@ was whether Congress intended for there to be a private right of action.

This circuit has decided that in analyzing the Cort, factors it will focus on the second factor,

8

starting point in discovering Congressional intent is the existing statutory text@). In

9

conducting this examination the court must consider Athe entire statutory scheme provided by

10

Congress to determine if a private cause of action exists, noting that analogous provisions

11

expressly provided for private causes of action can imply Congressional intent not to create

an implied cause of action.@

The Statute: An Analysis

Congressional Intent

19
20

When a federal statute provides for administrative remedies in lieu of, or as a

21

prerequisite to a right to sue, a private right of action does not exist Aunless Congressional

22

intent can be inferred from the language of the statute, the statutory structure, or some other

23

source.@ Karahalios v Nat=l. Fed=n of Fed. Employees, 489 U.S. 527, 532-33 (1989).

24

Congressional intent is the focal point in determining whether to infer a private right of

25

action from a federal statute. As the Supreme Court has stated:

Congress knows how to grant a private right of action when it intends to do so. The plaintiffs
have relied upon such a clear grant of a private in action in the fifth cause of action, relying
upon 18 U.S.C. ' 1595 which provides a civil remedy for violation of the TUPRA. See also:
ADA, 42 U.S.C. ' 12117; Rehab Act, 29 U.S.C. ' 794(a)(A)(2). Here Congress did not
provide such a remedy.

17
18

No known case addresses the issue of whether there is a private right of action by H-

19

2A workers. 2 However, several courts have held that similar provisions under H-1B Visas do

20

not provide a private right of action. AH-1B@ petitions refer to applications filed under a

21

provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 101 (a)(15)(h)(i)(b), as amended, 8

The District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of all
cases, civil and criminal, arising under and of the provisions of this
subchapter.

The effective date of the amendment was September 30, 1996 (Ex 6).

11

The elimination of the District Court’s jurisdiction to hear “all cases” and the limitation

12

to the District Court’s jurisdiction to cases “brought by the United States” conclusively shows

13

Congressional intent. No private right of action exists.

The other Cort v. Ashe Factors

In apprising the first Cort factor, courts look to whether the plaintiffs who claim a

17

cause of action exists are specifically mentioned as beneficiaries in the statute. Cannon v.

20

Univ. Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 690-91 (1979); Touche Ross v. Redington, 442 U.S. at 568.
“The question is not simply who would benefit from the law, but whether Congress intended
to confer federal rights upon beneficiaries.” California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 294
(1981).

22

H-2A workers are mentioned in the statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1188, but the subchapter does

23

not grant the H-2A workers substantive rights. Only federal statutes, and not rules adopted

24

pursuant to the statute, can provide the source of an implied right of action. Touche Ross,

25
26

442 U.S. at 477 n 18 No benefit is conferred upon the H-2A workers by the statute. The
statute was enacted to allow growers and ranchers a source of labor when the needed labor is
not available. The “especial benefit” is to the growers and ranchers and to protect U.S.

workers in the local market area. The benefit to the temporary worker is incidental. The first

2

Cort factor does not suggest that a private right of action exists.

The third Cort factor, whether an implied cause of action is consistent with the
underlying purposes of the legislative scheme must be answered in the negative. Congress
intentionally removed language in 1996 that gave the District Court jurisdiction. Congress
intended that all questions be brought by the U.S. Department of Labor. 8 U.S.C. § 188(g)(2)

7

A private right of action is not consistent with the underlying purposes. The U.S.

8

Department of Labor provides a uniform interpretation and application of its regulations and

9

an administrative remedy.

10
The fifth Cort factor, whether a cause of action is traditionally one relegated to state

11
12
13
14

law is answered no. The court has consistently (for more than 100 years) ruled that the
federal court has broad and exclusive power to regulate immigration. Fong Yue Ting v. U.S.,
149 U.S. 698, 711 (1893); De Canas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 354-55 (1976) State and local
laws that regulate immigration are preempted. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 355

THE DISTRICT COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE CLAIMS
BASED UPON THE CONTRACT.

The claims under the Fair Labor Standards Acts (First Cause of Action) and those

20

under state law, the Washington Wage Law (Second Cause of Action) and the state common

21

law, Quantum Meruit (Fourth Cause of Action) are based upon the breach of contract claim.

22

The plaintiffs claim that the contract was breached because they performed work outside the

23

job description and they are therefore entitled to a different wage. Because the wage was not

24

paid, they are entitled to recourse under the state and federal wage and hour laws and the state

25

common law claim of quantum meruit.

However, as demonstrated above, the contract claim is actually a claim (albeit

2

disguised) under the INA. The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of such claims and thus

cannot decide the three claims without deciding matters under the INA.

CONCLUSION

The Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims of breach of

contract, FLSA, state wage, and quantum meruit. There exists a method of addressing such

claims through administrative procedures. The claims should be dismissed.
