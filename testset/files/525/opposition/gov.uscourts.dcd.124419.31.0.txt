DEFENDANTS DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND CORRECTIONS
CORPORATION OF AMERICA’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT
Defendants District of Columbia (“District”) and Corrections Corporation of
America (“CCA”), by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby oppose Plaintiff’s
Motion for Entry of Default against Defendant Correctional Health and Policy Studies,
Inc. (“CCHPS”).
On April 30, 2007, Plaintiff filed a proof of service claiming to have served
CCHPS through its registered agent, CT Corporation, on April 26, 2007. Dkt. No. 16.
Plaintiff thereafter served CCHPS, again through CT Corporation, a copy of the Joint
Motion for Extension of Time. On May 23, 2007, CT Corporation submitted a letter to
the Clerk returning the Joint Motion and stating that their “statutory representation
services were discontinued and all process sent to the last known address on our records
was returned as undeliverable.” Dkt. No. 23. Plaintiff’s subsequent services upon
CCHPS through CT Corporation have been returned to the Clerk in the same manner and
with the same cover letter. See Dkt. Nos. 28 & 29.

Plaintiff now seeks an entry of default pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). This
Rule provides that where “a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is
sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is
made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party’s default.” Fed.
R. Civ. P. 55(a). The District and CCA submit that it is not clear that CCHPS has
intentionally failed to defend.
“It is ‘axiomatic that service of process must be effective under the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure before a default or a default judgment may be entered against a
defendant.’” Haldane v. Crockford, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6450 *9 (D.D.C. Apr. 23,
1998), quoting Maryland State Firemen's Assoc. v. Chaves, 166 F.R.D. 353 (D. Md.
1996); see also Dahl v. Kanawha Inv. Holding Co., 161 F.R.D. 673, 685 (N.D. Iowa
1995) (Rule 55(a) “requires a showing that the party has ‘failed to plead or otherwise
defend as provided by these rules.’ . . . because it appears from the record that [plaintiffs]
have never properly served the defendants, none of the defendants has failed to plead or
defend as required by the rules of civil procedure, and neither entry of default nor entry
of default judgment would be proper.”).
Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that CCHPS has been properly served.
Indeed, CCHPS’s former registered agent has informed the Court and Plaintiff that
papers sent to CCHPS have been returned as “undeliverable.” It is thus unclear whether
CCHPS has intentionally failed to defend, or simply has not received proper notice of the
claims against it. Moreover, it does not appear that Plaintiff has attempted service
pursuant to D.C. Code § 29-101.12(b), which provides for service on the Mayor of the
District of Columbia as registered agent for a corporation that fails, as CCHPS apparently

has, to maintain a registered agent in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, the District
and CCA submit that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that an entry of default is appropriate
at this time, and Plaintiff’s Motion for an entry of default should be denied.
