STATEMENT OF POINTS AND AUTHORIEIS IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT

Pursuant to Local Rule 7(a), Plaintiffs hereby submit this Statement of
Points and Authorities in support of their Motion for Entry of Default Judgment under

Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).

Plaintiff filed suit in this case on February 22, 2007. Plaintiff sent Center
for Correctional Health and Policy Studies (CCHPS) a waiver of summons on March 15,
2007 via certified mail, return receipt requested. As Defendant CCHPS never responded
to the waiver of summons, Plaintiff served its Resident Agent with a Complaint and
Summons on April 20, 2007 via certified mail, return receipt requested, as permitted by
the Federal Rules. Plaintiff received the return receipt, postmarked April 26, 2007, and
subsequently filed this receipt as proof of service with this Court. Defendant CCHPS'

Answer was due May 16, 2007.

Prior to sending the Complaint and Summons to CCHPS' resident agent,

Plaintiff's counsel verified the corporate status of the corporation, both to see whether it

 
Case 1:07-cv-00386-RCL Document 27 ~~ Filed 06/12/2007 Page5of5

was still active and to ensure that the appropriate address of the resident agent.
Currently, CCHPS is still listed as an "Active" corporation on the District of Columbia
website.

As such, because Defendant CCHPS has failed to respond despite proper
service, has never answered or moved to dismiss this case, and has failed to defend

entirely.

In view of the foregoing, Plaintiff requests that a default be entered against
CCHPS. At such time as default is entered, the Plaintiff will move that judgment be

entered pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b) with accompanying affidavit.

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Ivy A. Lange
