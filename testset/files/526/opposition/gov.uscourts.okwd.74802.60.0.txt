CLASS ACTION
PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO
UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO DISMISS AMENDED
COMPLAINT

Case 5:09-cv-01114-D

In addition to Chesapeake Energy Corporation (“Chesapeake”) and the Individual
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the Underwriter Defendants filed their own Motion With
Brief in Support to Dismiss Amended Complaint (“Underwriter Defs.’ Mot.”) asserting that
plaintiff has failed to allege that the Underwriter Defendants were “sellers” under §12(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933. Underwriter Defendants’ Underwriter Defs. Mot. at 2. This
argument ignores the properly plead allegations of the Amended Complaint for Violation of
the Federal Securities Laws (“Complaint”) and the Underwriter Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss should be denied.
As the Underwriter Defendants concede, the Supreme Court in Pinter v. Dahl, 486
U.S. 622 (1988), expands the definition of “seller” under §12(a)(2) to include a “person who
successfully solicits the purchase, motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own
financial interests or those of the securities owner.” Id. at 647. Solicitation includes
preparation and circulation of the prospectus as well as participation in roadshows to
promote the offering. Capri v. Murphy, 856 F.2d 473, 478 (2d Cir. 1988) (finding that
participation in preparation and circulation of prospectus sufficiently established seller
status); In re Am. Bank Note Holographics Sec Litig., 93 F. Supp. 2d 424, 439 (S.D.N.Y.
2000) (finding that participation in preparation of registration statement and prospectus and
in roadshows sufficient to show solicitation); In re OPUS360 Corp. Sec. Litig., No.
01Civ.2938(JGK)(JCF), 2002 WL 31190157, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2002) (same).
The Underwriter Defendants were sellers under §12(a)(2) because they solicited
purchases in the Offering. As alleged in the Complaint, the Underwriter Defendants
merchandised Chesapeake stock by arranging multi-city roadshows in which they (along

with certain of the Individual Defendants) met with potential investors and presented highly
favorable information about Chesapeake. ¶22.1 Additionally, the Underwriter Defendants
assisted in the planning of the Offering and engaged in “drafting sessions” in which they
determined: (i) the strategy to best accomplish the Offering; (ii) the terms of the Offering,
including the price at which Chesapeake stock would be sold; (iii) the language to be used in
the Registration Statement (including the financial statements incorporated therein by
reference); and (v) what responses would be made to the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with its review of the Registration Statement. ¶¶23, 24. The
Underwriter Defendants also drafted and disseminated the Offering documents and received
fees of more than $51 million collectively. ¶¶22, 25. These allegations are more than
sufficient to allege seller status under §12(a)(2).2
The Underwriter Defendants rely on two cases that are inapplicable here. Underwriter
Defs.’ Mem. at 2-3. In In re Royal Ahold N.V. Sec. & ERISA Litig., 351 F. Supp. 2d 334 (D.
Md. 2004), the court based its decision that the plaintiffs’ allegations were insufficient on
their failure to provide factual support rather than conclusory statements. Id. at 406. As
demonstrated above, this is not the case here as plaintiff has provided a number of factual

Paragraph references (“¶_” or “¶¶__”) are to the Complaint.

Whether a particular defendant engaged in sufficient solicitation to render itself liable
under §12(a)(2) is ultimately a question of fact, and plaintiff need not plead solicitation with
particularity as Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b)’s specificity requirements do not apply. In re Portal
Software, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. C-03-5138 VRW, 2006 WL 2385250, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug.
17, 2006); Degulis v. LXR Biotechnology, No. 95 Civ. 4204 (RWS), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
381, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 1997).

allegations to support the Underwriter Defendants’ solicitation in the Offering. Also, in In re
Countrywide Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 588 F. Supp. 2d 1132 (C.D. Cal. 2008), there was no
discussion regarding solicitation by the underwriters, as is alleged in this case. Id. at 1183.
Moreover, courts have held that plaintiffs need not identify from which defendant they
purchased shares in order to give underwriter defendants fair notice of the basis for the
claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. See, e.g., In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 294 F. Supp. 2d
392, 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). The Complaint properly alleges that the Underwriter Defendants
were “sellers” under §12(a)(2).
Accordingly, the Underwriter Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be denied.
