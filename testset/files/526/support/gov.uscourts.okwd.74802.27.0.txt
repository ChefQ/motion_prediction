Case No. CV-09-01114-D

UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS’ MOTION WITH BRIEF
IN SUPPORT TO DISMISS AMENDED COMPLAINT
Plaintiff asserts two causes of action against defendants UBS Investment Bank,
ABN Amro, Banc of America Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities (the
“Underwriter Defendants”), a claim under Section 11 (Count I) and under Section
12(a)(2) (Count II) of the Securities Act of 1933. For the reasons stated in the Motion to
Dismiss and Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion to Dismiss submitted by
Chesapeake Energy Corporation and the Individual Defendants, plaintiff’s claims should
be dismissed as to the Underwriter Defendants.

In addition, plaintiff’s claim against the Underwriter Defendants under Section
12(a)(2) should be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to allege with specificity that it
purchased securities from or was solicited by any of the Underwriter Defendants. Section
12(a)(2) of the Securities Act provides a remedy for a person who purchases a security
from another person who “offers or sells a security by means of a prospectus…which
includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact.” 15 U.S.C.
§77l(a)(2). In Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622 (1988), the Supreme Court held that liability
as a statutory seller under Section 121 applies to the person who passes title to the
securities, and extends “to the person who successfully solicits the purchase, motivated at
least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities
owner.” Id. at 647. See also, Maher v. Durango Metals, Inc., 144 F.3d 1302, 1307 (10th
Cir. 1998). According to the Court in Pinter, liability under Section 12 extends only to
“immediate sellers, or those who were directly involved in the actual solicitation of a
securities purchase.” Pinter, supra, 486 U.S. at 644, n. 21.
To state a claim under Section 12, plaintiff must at a “minimum allege facts” that
defendant either sold the securities at issue to plaintiff or solicited his purchase of them.
Maher, supra, 144 F. 3d at 1307. See also, In re Royal Ahold N.V. Sec. & ERISA Litig.,
351 F. Supp. 2d 334, 406 (D. Md. 2004)(“the complaint must allege by whom the

Although the holding in Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622 (1988), applied only to Section
12(a)(1) violations, the definition of a statutory seller has been applied by the courts to
Section 12(a)(2). See Maher v. Durango Metals, Inc., 144 F.3d 1302, 1307 n. 10 (10th
Cir. 1998) (citing Craftmatic Sec. Litig. v. Kraftsow, 890 F.2d 628, 635 (3d Cir. 1990));
Burford White Lumber Co. Profit Sharing and Savings Plan & Trust v. Octagon
Properties LTD, 740 F. Supp.1553, 1557-58 (W.D. Ok. 1989).

plaintiffs were solicited and from whom they purchased shares; these assertions must be
supported by specific factual allegations demonstrating a direct relationship between the
defendant and the plaintiff-purchaser.”); In re Countrywide Financial Corporation
Securities Litigation, 588 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1183 (C.D. Cal. 2008)(Court dismissed
Section 12(a)(2) claim, as “[p]laintiffs fail to plead that they purchased the securities
directly from specific underwriters, as required.”)
In the Amended Complaint, plaintiff fails to allege that any of the Underwriter
Defendants sold to plaintiff or solicited for purchase any of the securities at issue.
Accordingly, plaintiff’s Section 12(a)(2) is deficient, and it must be dismissed as to the
Underwriter Defendants.
