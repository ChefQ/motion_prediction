Document 35

Defendants First Bank of Delaware (the “Bank”); Check ‘n Go of California, Inc.,

3

Southwestern & Pacific Specialty Finance, Inc., and Avante Teladvance, Inc. (collectively the

4

“Check ‘n Go Defendants”); and Monetary Management of California, Inc. and Money Mart

5

Express, Inc., (collectively the “Money Mart Defendants”) removed this case on two independent

6

bases: federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and diversity jurisdiction

7

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. As is clear from the Defendants’ Opposition to the City Attorney’s

8

Motion to Remand filed concurrently herewith,1 this case was properly removed, and there is no

9

basis for the City Attorney’s Motion for Fees and Costs. The Motion for Fees and Costs should,

10

therefore, be denied.

11
12

ARGUMENT
I.

13

STANDARD
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), an order remanding a case may require payment of costs

14

and expenses incurred as a result of removal. In Martin v. Franklin Capital Corporation, 546 U.S.

15

132, 140 (2005), the Supreme Court held that courts may generally award attorney’s fees only

16

where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal and,

17

conversely, where an objectively reasonable basis for removal exists, fees should be denied. See

18

also Durham v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 445 F.3d 1247, 1254 (9th Cir. 2006) (reversing award of

19

attorney’s fees where removal objectively reasonable).

20

II.

22

DEFENDANTS HAD AN OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE BASIS TO
ASSERT FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION
The City Attorney (the “City Attorney”) for the City and County of San Francisco (the

23

“City”) has named the Bank as a defendant in this action; the Bank is a state-chartered, federally

24

insured bank. See Compl. ¶ 10; see also Declaration of Alonzo Primus, attached to Defendants’

25

Notice of Removal, ¶¶ 2-3 (the Bank is chartered under the state of Delaware and is insured by the

Defendants’ objectively reasonable grounds for removal are set forth more fully in Defendants’
Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand; Memorandum of Points and Authorities, which is

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). The City Attorney’s single-count Complaint

2

unequivocally alleges that the Bank has violated California usury law. See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 2, 12, 15,

3

18, 23, 31-32, and 36c. Further, whether the Complaint calls the claim against the Bank “usury,”

4

“aiding and abetting,” or a violation of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200

5

arising from transactions the City Attorney claims to be usurious, it challenges the rate of interest

6

charged by the Bank on the installment loans at issue, and thus, it falls within the scope of Section

7

27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), 12 U.S.C. § 1831d.

8

Section 27 of the FDIA is the statutory counterpart to Sections 85 and 86 of the National

9

Bank Act (“NBA”), 12 U.S.C. §§ 85-86. See Greenwood Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 971 F.2d

10

818, 826-27 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1052 (1993). For this reason, it is well-settled

11

that Section 27 of the FDIA and Sections 85 and 86 of the NBA should be read in pari materia.

12

Id. at 828 (“when Congress borrows language from one statute and incorporates it into a second

13

statute, the language of the two acts should be interpreted in the same way”).

14

In Beneficial National Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 10-11 (2003), the Supreme Court

15

held that a state law usury claim against a national bank was completely preempted by Sections 85

16

and 86 of the NBA. Defendants here argue that this same principle applies under Section 27 of the

17

FDIA. Each of the two circuits of the federal Court of Appeals to consider the issue have reached

18

the same conclusion relied upon by Defendants. See Discover Bank v. Vaden, No. 06-1221, 2007

19

WL 1695758, at *9 (4th Cir. June 13, 2007); In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 418 F.3d 277, 295-96 (3d

20

Cir. 2005). Indeed, in Vaden, the Court of Appeals stated: “[W]e are hard-pressed to conclude

21

other than that Congress intended complete preemption of state-law usury claims under the FDIA.”

22

2007 WL 1695758, at *9. See also Cross-Country Bank v. Klussman, 74 Fed. App’x 796, 797 (9th

23

Cir. 2003) (“[I]t appears that the rationale of the Supreme Court’s decision in [Beneficial] would

24

extend to usury claims against state chartered, federally insured banks such as [appellant]”);

25

Forness v. Cross Country Bank, No. 05-CV-417, 2006 WL 240535, at *3 (S.D. Ill. Jan. 13, 2006)

26

(claim challenging fees charged by state-chartered bank is completely preempted); Hill v.

27

Chemical Bank, 799 F.Supp. 948, 952 (D. Minn. 1992) (holding that Section 27 “completely

28

preempts the field of usury claims against federally insured state banks”).

§ 1332(a)(1). The City Attorney admits that Defendants are all incorporated in states other than

7

California and have their principal places of business outside of California. See Compl. ¶¶ 6-10.

8

The City Attorney also does not dispute that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. See

9

Notice of Removal ¶¶ 19, 27-33.
In an attempt to defeat removal, the City Attorney claims that the Plaintiff is not a citizen

10
11

of the State of California. The City Attorney argues that because he brought this action in the

12

name of the “People of the State of California,” the State of California is the real party in interest.

13

See Remand Memo at 13. This argument is wrong as a matter of fact and law. First, the City

14

Attorney, as an elected official, represents only the City. See San Francisco Charter art. VI., §

15

6.102.2 Second, by statute, the penalties he seeks are payable to the City for the exclusive use of

16

the City Attorney. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17206(f). Further, California cases hold that a

17

city attorney has no authority to represent all Californians as an entity separate and apart from the

18

city itself. See, e.g., California v. M & P Invs., 213 F. Supp. 2d 1208, 1216 (E.D. Cal. 2002).

19

Thus, the City, and not the State of California, is the real party to this controversy. See Navarro

20

Sav. Ass’n v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, 461 (1980) (“a federal court must disregard nominal or formal

21

parties and rest jurisdiction only upon the citizenship of real parties to the controversy”).
Because the City is the real party in interest as Plaintiff, its citizenship is relevant for the

22
23

diversity analysis. As the Supreme Court held in Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 717

24

(1973), a political subdivision of a State is a citizen of the State for diversity purposes.

25

Accordingly, because complete diversity exists among the parties and the amount in controversy is

over $75,000, Defendants’ removal of this action on the basis of diversity was also not only

objectively reasonable and proper, but entirely correct as well.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons expressed herein and in Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for

5

Remand, removal of this action based on federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction

6

was objectively reasonable and proper. Accordingly, the City Attorney’s Motion for Fees and

7

Costs, as well as its Motion to Remand, should be denied.
