MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

INTRODUCTION

3

Page 3 of 7

As the People have explained in their concurrently filed motion to remand this action to

4

state court, Defendants’ removal of this action was improper because this court lacks subject

5

matter jurisdiction over the People’s consumer protection enforcement action. This Court should

6

remand this action to its proper state court forum.

7

This Court should also order that the Defendants pay the People their fees and costs

8

incurred as a result of Defendants’ improper removal of this action.1 Section 1447(c) of Title 28

9

provides that “[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual

10

expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.” In Martin v. Franklin

11

Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132 (2005), the Supreme Court explained that a court should award fees

12

under section 1447(c) when the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for

13

seeking removal.

14

Defendants’ assertions regarding the existence of diversity and federal question

15

jurisdiction are not objectively reasonable, in view of the actual claims made in the People’s

16

Complaint and the overwhelming authority that has rejected the same position Defendants assert

17

here. Viewed in its entirety, Defendants’ removal of this action was not objectively reasonable.

18

Defendants’ removal has served only to delay the People’s enforcement of state law.

19

Defendants’ removal has needlessly increased the costs borne by the People. The Court should

20

order Defendants, and each of them, to pay the People’s fees and costs incurred as a result of

21

Defendants’ improper removal, $13,508.00.

Pursuant to N.D. Civil Local Rule 7-8, the People’s request for costs and fees incurred
as a result of Defendants’ improper removal must be filed separately from their motion for
remand. To limit the papers under submission to the Court, the People incorporate by reference
their motion for remand and will assume the Court and counsel’s familiarity with the arguments
on the merits made therein.

Document 27

I.

WHERE DEFENDANTS’ REMOVAL OF AN ACTION TO FEDERAL COURT
IS OBJECTIVELY UNREASONABLE, DEFENDANTS SHOULD PAY THE
PLAINTIFF’S FEES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE REMOVAL

3

Section 1447(c) of Title 28 provides that "[a]n order remanding the case may require

4
5

payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the

6

removal." In Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, ---, 126 S. Ct. 704 (2005), the

7

Supreme Court explained that the “appropriate test for awarding fees under § 1447(c) should

8

recognize the desire to deter removals sought for the purpose of prolonging litigation and

9

imposing costs on the opposing party.” Id. at 711. The Court held that there is no presumption

10

against, or in favor of, awarding fees under section 1447(c). Id. at 710. The Supreme Court held

11

that the appropriate test for a fee award was an objective one: a fee award was proper “where the

12

removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.” Id. at 711. The

13

Court rejected the argument that a plaintiff should be required to show that the removing party’s

14

position was “frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.” Id. at 710; see also Moore v.

15

Permanente Medical Group, Inc., 981 F.2d 443, 446 (9th Cir. 1992).

II.

THERE IS NO OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE BASIS FOR DEFENDANTS TO
ASSERT FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION
Defendants removed this action based on the alleged complete preemption effects of

Section 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("Section 27"), codified at 12 U.S.C. § 1831d
(“Section 27”). (Notice of Removal, Keith Decl. Exh. A.) But, as more fully explained in the
People’s accompanying motion to remand (at pp. 1, 9-11), Defendants’ position regarding
federal question jurisdiction relies on a mischaracterization of the claims made in the People’s
Complaint. Defendants assert that the Complaint makes state-law usury claims directly against
Defendant First Bank of Delaware. But the People’s Complaint asserts no such claim. The
People’s claim is that the First Bank of Delaware has aided and abetted violations of state law by
payday lenders Check 'N Go and its affiliates 2 and Money Mart and its affiliates. 3 (Complaint,

26
2

27

Check 'N Go and its affiliates are Check 'N Go of California, Inc., Southwestern &
Pacific Specialty Finance, Inc., and Avante Teladvance, Inc.

Keith Decl. Exh. B.) The People are aware of no authority that supports removal of such claims.

2

To the contrary, as described below, courts have uniformly found removal of such claims to be

3

improper.

4

Likewise, Defendants’ legal argument that “complete preemption” confers federal

5

question jurisdiction over the People’s claims is not tenable. As the People have explained in

6

their accompanying remand motion (at pp. 4-8), courts have found “complete preemption” only

7

in extraordinary circumstances, and no court has ever found preemption of the “aid and abet”

8

claims that the People assert in this Complaint. The People’s accompanying remand motion (at

9

pp. 6-8) identifies several district court cases 4 that have rejected assertions of “complete

10
11

preemption” that are identical or similar to Defendants’ claim in the present case.
Defendants are surely aware – or should be – of the status of the law in this area. We

12

note that Defendant First Bank of Delaware has advanced, and lost, a much less ambitious

13

version of the preemption argument that it makes here. In BankWest, Inc. v. Baker, 411 F.3d

14

1289, 1301 (11th Cir. 2005), vacated and appeal dismissed as moot, 446 F.3d 1358 (2006), First

15

Bank of Delaware and other parties sought an injunction against enforcement of Georgia laws

16

regulating relationships between state-chartered banks and payday lender affiliates. First Bank

17

of Delaware argued – as here – that such state regulation was preempted by federal law. Unlike

18

here, however, the First Bank of Delaware did not advance the more ambitious argument that

19

there was complete preemption of state regulations. Nonetheless, the District Court, and then the

20

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal, rejected First Bank of Delaware’s ordinary preemption

21

argument. The People recognize that this decision was vacated and the appeal was dismissed as

27

(footnote continued from previous page)
3
Money Mart and its affiliates are Monetary Management of California, Inc. and Money
Mart Express, Inc.
4
It is appropriate for the Court to consider unpublished decisions where, as here, the
Court is evaluating the objective reasonableness of a party’s legal position in view of existing
law. See, e.g., Prison Legal News v. Lehman, 397 F.3d 692, 701-02 (9th Cir. 2005) (unpublished
decisions may be considered in determining whether a reasonable government official would be
on notice that law is "clearly established" for purposes of qualified immunity). We also note that
these unpublished District Court decisions are citable pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-14.

moot when First Bank of Delaware represented to the Court that it was no longer entering the

2

subject loan agreements. 446 F.3d 1358, 1366-67. Nonetheless, the Georgia case demonstrates

3

that the First Bank of Delaware was aware that courts had already rejected the argument that

4

ordinary preemption blocked state regulation of relationships between payday lenders and out-

5

of-state banks. Given First Bank of Delaware’s unsuccessful argument for ordinary preemption,

6

it was objectively unreasonable for the First Bank of Delaware to have removed the present

7

action, on the basis of the far more ambitious assertion that similar regulations are completely

8

preempted by federal law.

9

In light of these cases, and in light of Defendants' mischaracterization of the People's

10

complaint in making out their complete preemption argument, Defendants' removal was not

11

reasonable. The circumstances of this case are even stronger than those in Braco v. MCI

12

WorldComm Communications, Inc., 138 F. Supp. 2d 1260 (C.D. Cal. 2001), where the court

13

awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiff even though the defendant's removal under the claim of

14

complete preemption was supported by some authority. Id. at 1270 ("Fees are appropriate in this

15

case because Defendant's claim of complete preemption under the FCA, while 'fairly supportable'

16

under the authority cited by Defendant, is nonetheless contrary to law, as it has been expressed

17

by the weight of authority."). Here, Defendants' removal effort is equally contrary to the weight

18

of authority, and fees are appropriate.

19

III.

THERE IS NO OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE BASIS FOR DEFENDANTS TO
ASSERT DIVERSITY JURISDICTION

20
As explained in the People’s accompanying remand motion (at pp. 12-15), Defendants’
21
assertions regarding diversity jurisdiction rely entirely on a misidentification of the sole plaintiff
22
in this action. Contrary to Defendants’ representations in their removal petition (Keith Decl.
23
Exh. B), the plaintiff is not “the City and County of San Francisco.” A glance at the caption of
24
the Complaint, and a review of its text, demonstrates that the only plaintiff in this action is the
25
“People of the State of California.” (Keith Decl. Exh. A.) Because the People of California are
26
the State – not a “citizen” of any state – there is no diversity jurisdiction.

1

Defendants' effort to remove this case based on diversity jurisdiction is equally

2

unreasonable: only by misstating the plaintiff as the City and County of San Francisco rather

3

than the People does Defendants' diversity jurisdiction claim become plausible. It was

4

objectively unreasonable for Defendants to misstate the identity of the plaintiff in this action.
CONCLUSION

5
6

Because the Defendants’ removal of this action was objectively unreasonable, the People

7

request that this Court order that the Defendants, and each of them, pay the People’s costs and

8

fees incurred as a result of the removal, in the amount of $13,508.00. (Keith Decl. ¶¶ 8-11.)
