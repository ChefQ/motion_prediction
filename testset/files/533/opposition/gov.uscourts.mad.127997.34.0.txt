Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 6 of 24

Plaintiff Jeffrey Wiener, suing derivatively on behalf of Eaton Vance Municipals Trust
(“Trust”), respectfully submits this opposition to the motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint
filed by the Independent Trustee Defendants and the Trust (“Motion”). Plaintiff incorporates by
reference the arguments made in his opposition brief to the motion to dismiss filed by defendants
Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc. and Thomas Faust (“Eaton Vance Distributors’ Motion’”).
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff complains derivatively that the Trust, his mutual fund, is using fund assets -- on
an ongoing and current basis -- to pay “asset-based compensation” to broker-dealers, in
contravention of a clear statutory ban on such compensation in the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, as definitively confirmed by Financial Planning Ass’n v. SEC, 482 F.3d 481 (D.C. Cir.
2007).
The Trust, as nominal defendant, defends on the ground that it has concluded, based on
the recommendation of a committee of the board that received advice of counsel, that the
challenged payments are legal and therefore plaintiff’s demand was properly refused.
As described in the Trust’s present motion, the board’s decision was based on purely
legal conclusions: (a) that “all asset-based compensation is not necessarily ‘special
compensation,’” as that term is employed in Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the Adviser’s Act, such
that the payments were lawful; and (b) that Financial Planning Ass’n “did not determine. . . that
Rule 12b-1 fees or any other particular form of ‘asset-based’ compensation constitutes ‘special
compensation’ for purposes of Section 202(a)(11)(C) in all instances.’” Motion at 8-10. The
board also determined that the benefit of pursuing litigation was outweighed by the likely actions
that broker-dealers would take in response to any corrective action by the Trust (i.e. requiring
advisory accounts or terminating the payments) during the pendency of the litigation. Id. at 1011.

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 7 of 24

The Trust’s position is itself completely untenable. However completely Massachusetts
common or statutory law may commit business decisions to corporate boards, all applicable
decisional law reserves to courts the ability, and indeed the duty, to determine whether the
company is committing ongoing violations of law. There can be no business judgment that it is
in the “best interests of the corporation” to violate the law. Nor can the Trust make a business
decision to insulate itself from any judicial review of its ongoing decisions to violate the law,
especially in view of the fact that the assertedly unlawful payments are being directly made from
the individually allocable assets owned by mutual fund shareholders like plaintiff – assets held
by the Trust solely in a fiduciary capacity.
Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint focuses on the ongoing illegal conduct at issue, and
makes no attempt to allege facts that rebut any business judgment of the board. Yet, remarkably,
the majority of the Trust’s argument focuses on the independence of the Trustees and other
factors pertinent to the business judgment rule – factors that plaintiff never sought to rebut. This
can all be disregarded. The only argument that the Trust makes concerning the Rule 23.1
allegations actually pleaded in the Amended Complaint is that “conclusory” allegations of illegal
conduct do not preclude the enforcement of the business judgment rule. Motion at 15-17.
However, the Trust has no support for its argument. Demand futility cases are inapposite. Those
cases (decided before Massachusetts’ adoption of a universal demand statute) held only that the
board should be given an opportunity to address the alleged illegal conduct before litigation is
commenced – an opportunity plaintiff’s demand gave the board here. In any event, the pertinent
caselaw, i.e. cases involving ongoing illegal conduct, demonstrates that plaintiff’s non-frivolous
allegations concerning the securities law violations at issue here are more than sufficient at this
stage of the litigation.

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Plaintiff also submits that the federal laws raised in his Amended Complaint, viz. the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Investment Company Act of 1940
(“ICA”), as applied to the payments at issue, preempt any state laws, including the business
judgment rule and any other state corporate governance laws, that arguably would impair or
prevent enforcement of the federal laws.
Moreover, plaintiff’s state law claims alleged against the Trustees are adequately
pleaded. Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim is a properly pleaded direct claim against the
Trustees arising from their ongoing failure to cease the illegal asset-based compensation
payments, which are harming the Trust and its shareholders. The corporate waste claim is
plausibly alleged because the Trust paid for advisory accounts on behalf of its shareholders and
never received that service.
Based on the foregoing, the Court should deny the Motion in its entirety.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
In the response to the demand, the Trustees rejected plaintiff’s legal position that assetbased compensation is the subject of the “no special compensation” prong of the statutory
Broker-Dealer Exclusion to the Advisers Act. AC ¶ 69. According to the Trustees, asset-based
compensation is not barred “in all instances.” Id. The response letter repeatedly concedes that
the payments are asset-based compensation. Id. In their motion, the Trustees incorporate the
arguments contained in Eaton Vance Distributors’ Motion, see Motion at 2 n.2, which argues
that the “fees are transaction-based compensation in that they are tied to the sale of particular
mutual fund shares.” Eaton Vance Distributors’ Motion at 2.
Both positions cannot be right. Either the 12b-1 payments are treated under the BrokerDealer Exclusion as ongoing asset-based compensation or are treated as a transaction-based sales
commission. The Trustees have no coherent theory of why the payments are lawful, much less
3

any business judgment on the subject.
The remaining relevant facts are set forth at length in plaintiff’s opposition to the Eaton
Vance Distributors’ Motion, which is being filed simultaneously herewith. To avoid repetition,
those facts will not be repeated here.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE DECISION WHETHER THE ONGOING PAYMENTS AT ISSUE ARE
LAWFUL IS PROPERLY COMMITTED TO THIS COURT, NOT TO THE
MUTUAL FUND’S BOARD
The Trust invokes Harhen v. Brown, 730 N.E. 2d 859, 865-67 (2000), to argue that its

refusal to stop making the payments at issue is protected by the business judgment rule, as
subsequently codified in 2004 by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156D, § 7.44. Motion at 12-13. The
Trust argues that the business judgment rule insulates all board decisions unless the complaint
particularizes reasons that the board was not “independent” and did not act in “good faith” after
conducting a “reasonable inquiry.” Id.
Consistent law from Massachusetts, Delaware, New York, and federal courts holds that
the business judgment rule does not and cannot insulate ongoing assertedly unlawful decisions or
conduct by corporate boards from judicial review.
The Harhen case -- the seminal case on the business judgment rule in Massachusetts -itself confirms plaintiff’s point, stating that: “Of course, where the failure to pursue a claim in
itself is an illegal act or results in the continuation of an illegal act, the business judgment rule
does not apply.” Harhen, 730 N.E. 2d at 866 n.7 (citing Miller v. American Tel & Tel. Co., 507
F.2d 759, 762 (3d Cir. 1974) (business judgment rule does not insulate directors from liability
stemming from current violation of federal statute)).1 The Amended Complaint clearly alleges

1

Although the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in Harhen dismissed the plaintiff’s action
based upon the business judgment rule, that conclusion has no applicability here, as the court
4

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 10 of 24

throughout that the Trust’s ongoing payments are unlawful. See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 4-5, 53-55, 57.
The distinction between past and ongoing illegal conduct in Miller was aptly explained
by the court in Gall v. Exxon Corp., 418 F. Supp. 508 (S.D.N.Y. 1976):
The Court [in Miller] noted that had plaintiffs’ complaint alleged only a failure to
pursue a corporate claim, application of the business judgment rule would support
the district court’s ruling that a shareholder could not attack the decision of the
directors. The Court went on to note, however, that where the decision not to
collect the debt owed to the corporation was itself alleged to be an illegal act, a
different rule would apply. Since the Court found that issues had been raised as to
whether the defendant directors had breached 18 U.S.C. § 610 as plaintiffs had
charged, it concluded that plaintiffs’ complaint stated a claim upon which relief
could be granted sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.
Id. at 518 n.19. Accordingly, when the board decision being challenged involves conduct that
assertedly remains unlawful on an ongoing basis, and the derivative plaintiff seeks to terminate
the unlawful conduct, the board’s “business” judgment is not involved and the business judgment
rule does not preclude the action.
For instance, a board can exercise its business judgment not to seek a damages remedy
for past illegal conduct (for example, the board of a manufacturing company may make a
business decision not to sue and antagonize a critical parts supplier even if payments to it were
unlawful). However, such an exercise of board authority is not permitted if the assertedly
unlawful conduct was continuing at the time the board was considering the shareholder’s
demand to cease the unlawful conduct. This is because engaging in illegal activity is ultra vires
and not a valid business judgment, and therefore it is a matter for a court to decide. See Gray v.
Barnett ( In re Dehon, Inc.), 334 B.R. 55, 66 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2005):
Under the facts presented in the Plan Administrator’s complaint, however, the
challenged distributions were not legitimate business decisions, regardless of
whether the Defendants believed that they were in the best interests of the Debtor,
noted that there was no allegation of ongoing illegal conduct by the plaintiff. Harhen, 730 N.E.
2d at 866 n.7.

5

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 11 of 24

since the Debtor’s insolvency renders such distributions unlawful under § 61. As
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court alluded to in Harhen, challenges to
business decisions involving illegal actions do not implicate the business
judgment rule. See Harhen, 431 Mass 838, 730 N.E.2d at 866 (citing Miller v.
Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 507 F.2d 759, 762 (3d Cir.1974)).

Those authorities, preserving for judicial review claims alleging that ongoing corporate
activity is unlawful, demonstrate that the business judgment rule is inapplicable here.
A.

Plaintiff Has Sufficiently Alleged the Trust’s Ongoing Securities Law
Violations

Defendants cannot cite a single authority suggesting that the business judgment rule
permits a board to conclude that it is in the “best interests of the corporation” to continue with
illegal conduct. Instead, defendants cite to cases that address the issue of demand futility (when
a plaintiff has filed litigation without first making a demand on the board), rather than cases
involving allegations of wrongful refusal of a demand. Recognizing the inapplicability of their
cases, defendants weakly claim that demand futility precedents are relevant because the pleading
standard is the same for demand futility and demand refusal. Motion at 16 n.57.
However, the operative pleading standard has nothing to do with the applicability of the
business judgment rule, as defendants’ own cases explain. In In re Kauffman Mutual Fund
Actions, 479 F.2d 257, 266-67 (1st Cir. 1973), the Court affirmed the granting of a motion to
dismiss a derivative action on the grounds that the shareholder had not demonstrated demand
futility because the board should have had the opportunity to address the alleged misconduct
without the need for litigation.3 The opinion does not address whether the board could have
relied upon the business judgment rule to reject a demand. Indeed, the Court expressly noted
that its decision was limited to the demand obligation, and that its decision did not bar a plaintiff

waste, illegality, fraud, or an ultra vires act, not even ratification by disinterested directors or
anything less than a unanimous shareholder vote will protect the transaction, or those
participating in it”); Desimone v. Barrows, 924 A.2d 908, 934 (Del. Ch. 2007) (directors have
“wide authority to take lawful action on behalf of the corporation” but “have no authority
knowingly to cause the corporation to become a rogue, exposing the corporation to penalties
from criminal and civil regulators”).
3

Kauffman was decided before Massachusetts implemented a universal demand requirement in
2004. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156D, § 7.42.

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

from pursuing the underlying cause of action in the future after making a proper demand. Id. at
267 (“In affirming we must, however, comment upon one phrase in the order of the district court
granting the motion to dismiss, that it is ‘without prejudice.’ This must mean without prejudice
as to the substantive cause of action. The dismissal is with prejudice on the issue of the
obligation to make a demand on the directors with respect to that substantive complaint.”).
The irrelevance of Kauffman to the issue of wrongful refusal was highlighted in Galef v.
Alexander, 615 F. 2d 51, 59-60 (2d Cir. 1980), where the Court stated, in pertinent part:
The decision as to whether a demand is excusable, however, does not necessarily
answer the question presented here, of whether a resolution by directors to seek
summary termination of the suit should be honored . . . A determination that
directors are not so interested in the underlying transaction as to excuse demand
on them does not mean that they are so disinterested as to enable them to
eliminate the lawsuit. The rationale of the cases holding that demand must be
made even if the directors have been or may be made defendants, is not that the
directors can preclude suit despite being defendants, but rather that they might
cause the corporation to pursue the suit despite being defendants. See In re
Kauffman Mutual Fund Actions, supra, 479 F.2d at 265 (additional citations
omitted).4
See also Evangelist v. Fidelity Management & Research Co., 554 F.Supp. 87, 90 (D. Mass.
1982) (“But the rationale of those cases [Kauffman and other demand futility cases] is not that
the directors are able to preclude suit entirely by refusing a demand. Rather, they rest on the
proposition that directors, despite being defendants, are still capable of making an honest
decision about whether to sue on the corporation’s behalf. Failure to make demand only

Landy v. D’Alessandro, 316 F. Supp. 2d 49 (D. Mass. 2004) and Litt v. Wycoff, No. 19083,
2003 WL 1794724, at *7 (Del. Ch. Mar. 28, 2003) (Motion at 16) also concern demand futility.
In those cases, the courts were considering claims that the boards had approved illegal
transactions in the past. Landy, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (allegations that board had awarded
executive compensation in violation of Plan of Reorganization); Litt, 2003 WL 1794724, at *1
(allegations of prior illegal lending activities, illegal bonus payments to officers, and illegal
commission payments to officers and directors). In contrast, here, plaintiff has alleged
substantial particularized facts concerning ongoing securities law violations, which the board has
refused to remedy. See AC ¶¶ 5, 70.

8

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

temporarily bars the shareholder’s suit. Whether the directors correctly assessed the merits of the
corporate claim in refusing plaintiff’s demand relates to plaintiff’s standing to sue, not to
whether intracorporate remedies have been exhausted.”) (citations omitted).
Defendants contend that conclusory allegations of illegal conduct cannot prevent the
dismissal of a complaint based upon a wrongful refusal of the demand. Apart from the fact that
there is no precedent for this assertion (defendants’ demand futility cases do not support it), it is
well established that the plaintiff does not have to prove his allegations of ongoing illegal
conduct in his complaint. See, e.g., Miller, 507 F.2d 763-64 (“[w]e have accepted plaintiffs’
allegation of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 610 as a shorthand designation of the elements necessary
to establish a breach of that statute. This is consonant with the federal practice of notice pleading.
. . . At the appropriate time, plaintiffs will be required to produce evidence sufficient to establish
three distinct elements comprising a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 610”) (citations omitted); Gall, 418
F. Supp. at 518 n.19 (noting that complaint in Miller was sustained because “issues had been
raised as to whether the defendant directors had breached 18 U.S.C. § 610”); Gray, 334 B.R. at
66 (sustaining derivative complaint because construing allegations in light most favorable to
plaintiff supported the inference that director-defendants had violated Massachusetts law by
authorizing stock repurchases and dividend payments when they knew that the company was
insolvent).
Here, plaintiff has met the “particularity” element of Fed R. Civ. P. 23.1(b)(3), because
the Amended Complaint explains that broker-dealers may not receive asset-based compensation,
¶¶ 20-34, explains how performance of the Distribution Agreement providing for such payments
involves participating in violations of the Advisers Act, ¶¶ 44-58, explains the duties that the
Trustees and Eaton Vance Distributors have under the ICA that directly pertain to the payments

at issue, ¶¶ 59-65, explains how the ICA requires that compliance with the ICA must trump any
conflicting contractual obligations, ¶¶ 71-80, and otherwise provides particular detail
demonstrating that the Trust and its shareholders are being harmed by improper use of Trust
assets on an ongoing basis, and therefore a derivative action is appropriate. ¶¶ 66-70.
II.

APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTS ANY STATE LAW THAT WOULD
OPERATE TO INSULATE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS FROM JUDICIAL
REVIEW
The Trust’s contention that state corporate governance laws prevent review by this Court

of alleged violations of federal securities laws also implicates the Supremacy Clause.5 In Burks
v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471 (1979), the Supreme Court -- in a case that, like this one, was a mutual
fund shareholder derivative action alleging violations of the ICA and the Advisers Act -- set
forth a two-step inquiry to determine whether the mutual fund board has the power to terminate
derivative litigation, consistent with the Supremacy Clause. First, the court should “determine
whether state law permitted [the mutual fund’s] disinterested directors to terminate respondents’
suit. If so, the next inquiry should have been whether such a state rule was consistent with the
policy of the ICA and [Adviser’s Act].” Id. at 480.
According to the Supreme Court, the ICA and the Advisers Act “do not require that
federal law displace state laws governing the power of directors unless the state laws permit
action prohibited by the Acts, or unless ‘their application would be inconsistent with the federal
policy underlying the cause of action . . . .’” Id. at 479 (citing Johnson v. Railway Express
Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 465 (1975)). “Federal courts must be ever vigilant to insure that
application of state law poses ‘no significant threat to any identifiable [federal] policy or

5

The United States Constitution and federal laws and treaties “shall be the supreme Law of the
Land;” and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2.

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 16 of 24

interest.’” Id. (quoting Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U.S. 63, 68 (1966)).
The Burks opinion is controlling authority here, and essentially follows the established
“conflict preemption” prong of Supremacy Clause jurisprudence. See O’Neal v. Smithkline
Beecham Corp., 551 F. Supp. 2d 993, 1002 (E.D. Cal. 2008) (“Conflict preemption can be either
direct or indirect. Direct conflict, or ‘impossibility preemption,’ occurs where it is ‘impossible
for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,’ indirect conflict, or
‘obstacle preemption,’ exists ‘where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and
execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.’” (quoting Sprietsma v. Mercury
Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 64 (2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted)). Regulations
promulgated pursuant to federal statutory authority “have no less pre-emptive effect than federal
statutes.” Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Ass’n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153 (1982).
This Court does not need to reach the preemption issue here because, under the first step
of the Burks test, the Court looks to Massachusetts law to determine if the business judgment
rule applies to ongoing illegal conduct. Since it does not, as described above, the board lacks the
authority to terminate the litigation, and therefore no conflict preemption analysis is necessary.
Even if the second step of the Burks test were to be reached, it is clear that, under the standards
for conflict preemption, this is a case of “direct conflict” because the business judgment rule, a
creation of state law, would act to shield ongoing violations of the federal securities laws.
The significance of Burks, as aptly summarized by the district court in SEC v. Keating,
91-6785, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14630, at *11 (C.D. Cal. July 24,1992), is that it is
“impermissible to allow the business judgment rule, a creation of state law, to supersede the
requirements, prohibitions, and policies of the federal securities laws”:
First, the business judgment rule usually applies to actions (generally those
brought by shareholders) to enjoin corporate acts or to seek damages from

11

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 17 of 24

directors based on the actions taken by the directors. Second, it would be
impermissible to allow the business judgment rule, a creation of state law, to
supersede the requirements, prohibitions, and policies of the federal securities
laws. A state business judgement rule cannot permit action otherwise prohibited
by the federal securities laws. Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 479, 99 S. Ct. 1831,
1838, 60 L. Ed. 2d. 404 (1979); Galef v. Alexander, 615 F.2d 51, 62 (2d Cir.
1980). State law cannot be used to supplement the federal securities law if the
state law would be inconsistent with the principles underlying federal law.
Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 111 S. Ct. 1711, 1717, 114 L. Ed. 2d
152 (1991). In sum, if Ligget’s conduct was in violation of the federal securities
laws, the business judgment rule could not be allowed to apply; if his conduct did
not violate those laws, the defense is superfluous.
Id. at *11-12.
Accordingly, the business judgment rule is inapplicable here, and, even assuming it were
applicable, it is preempted.
III.

PLAINTIFF’S STATE LAW CLAIMS ARE ADEQUATELY PLEADED
A.

Plaintiff Adequately Alleges a Claim for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
1.

Rule 9(b) Does Not Apply Because Plaintiff Does Not Allege Fraud

The Trustees argue that Rule 9(b) applies to plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim.
Motion at 17-18. Defendants are wrong. As this Court has held, a plaintiff alleging a breach of
fiduciary duty claim generally need only comply with Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. Gerber v. Bowditch, 05-10782, 2006 WL 1284232, at *13 (D. Mass. May 8, 2006)
(Woodlock, J.). Rule 9(b) applies to a breach of fiduciary duty claim only if the claim is
grounded in fraud. See North Am. Catholic Educational Programming Foundation Inc. v.
Cardinale, 567 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2009) (Rule 9(b) covers claims where the core allegations
effectively charge fraud); Gerber, 2006 WL 1284232, at *13.
Here, the Trustees do not claim, nor could they, that plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty is
based on fraud. Rather, the Trustees argue that Rule 9(b) applies because plaintiff alleged an
intentional breach of fiduciary duty. Motion at 17-18. However, the only cases on which they

12

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 18 of 24

rely for this proposition do not so hold and instead are consistent with this Court’s ruling in
Gerber that breach of fiduciary duty claims are subject to Rule 8(a), and the First Circuit’s ruling
in Cardinale that Rule 9(b) only applies if fraud is alleged. For example, the Trustees rely on In
re Stratus Computer, Inc Sec. Litig., 89-2075, 1992 WL 73555 (D. Mass. Mar. 27, 1992), and
Sachs v. Sprague, 401 F. Supp.2d 159 (D. Mass. 2005). Yet in Stratus, Rule 9(b) was applied
not because of an alleged intentional breach of fiduciary duty, but because the breach of
fiduciary duty “derives from conduct that is fraudulent.” Stratus, 1992 WL 73555, at *8.
Further, although the Sachs court did use the term “intentional breaches of fiduciary duties,” it
cites Insanaka v. Spectrum Technologies USA Inc., 131 F. Supp.2d 353 (N.D.N.Y. 2001), which
holds that: “When a claim for breach of fiduciary duty is based primarily upon alleged
fraudulent conduct, the heightened pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) apply.” Id. at 362
(emphasis added). Accordingly, the Trustees’ cases support plaintiff’s position here that Rule
9(b) does not apply because there are no allegations of fraud in the Amended Complaint.
2.

Plaintiff’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim Is Not a Caremark Claim

Although defendants contend that Rule 9(b) applies to plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty
claim, defendants do not assert that plaintiff failed to meet the particularity standards set forth in
Rule 9(b). Rather, the Trustees argue that plaintiff is making a Caremark, or failure to monitor,
claim, without pleading a “sustained or systematic failure” to exercise oversight. Motion at 18.
Defendants once again miss the mark because plaintiff pled direct liability for the Trustees’ own
actions in approving the payments at issue, not a failure to detect wrongdoing by corporate
personnel other than the Trustees.
In Caremark, the court states that it is ignorance of the liability creating activities that
triggers the Caremark standard, which are certainly not the facts here.

13

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 19 of 24

[A] claim of directorial liability for corporate loss is predicated upon ignorance of
liability creating activities within the corporation. . . . [O]nly sustained or
systematic failure of the board to exercise oversight such as an utter failure to
attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exits (sic)-will
establish the lack of good faith that is a necessary condition for liability.
In re Caremark In’l, Inc.Deriv. Litig., 698 A.2d 959, 971 (Del. Ch. 1996). See also In re Abbotts
Labs. Derivative S’holders Litig., 325 F.3d 795, 808-809 (7th Cir. 2003) (in Caremark, there was
no evidence to indicate that the Caremark directors knew of the violations of law and the
directors’ liability was “predicated upon ignorance” of the “liability-creating activities which
resulted in unconsidered failure to act.”).
Here, the board was aware of the “liability-creating activities,” i.e. the board was aware
that it was deciding to make asset-based compensation payments to broker-dealers, and
therefore, at all times, had the opportunity (indeed, the duty) to consider the compliance issues
raised by those payments. By contrast, in a Caremark claim, some low level employee will have
engaged in misconduct and the derivative shareholder seeks to hold the board liable for failing to
discover that the conduct that created liability for the corporation had occurred.
Here, the payments at issue are made out of Trust assets, which implicates SEC Rule
12b-1, and are being made to firms that sell Trust shares, which implicates the Securities
Exchange Act, and are of a form of ongoing compensation that implicates the Advisers Act, and
the Trust’s compliance with all of these laws and regulations is the direct and primary
responsibility of the board. AC ¶¶ 59-65; see also 17 C.F.R. § 270.12b-1(b)(3) (board
responsibilities to be aware of the uses of Rule 12b-1 payments out of Trust assets).
As such, the Amended Complaint alleges a direct breach of fiduciary duty claim against
the Trustees arising from their own misconduct in using Trust assets improperly, which resulted

14

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 20 of 24

in harm to the shareholders of the Trust.6 See AC ¶¶ 4, 5, 61. See also In re SFBC Int'l, Inc.
Sec. & Derivative Litig., 495 F. Supp. 2d 477, 484 (D.N.J. 2007) (noting that “[u]nlike other
theories of director liability,” a Caremark claim alleges “loss to the corporation resulting from an
unconsidered failure of the board to act”); Abbott Labs, 325 F.3d at 806 (facts are “exactly the
opposite of Caremark; members of the board in Abbott were aware of the problems.”); White v.
Panic, 793 A.2d 356, 363 (Del. Ch. 2000) (where gravamen of the complaint alleged that
defendant directors were “liable for their affirmative and intentional decisions allegedly reached
in bad faith or with a reckless disregard of their fiduciary duties,” then plaintiff did not plead a
Caremark claim).
Because the Trustees seek dismissal of plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim solely on
the grounds that it is an inadequately pleaded Caremark claim, a contention that has no merit, the
Trustees’ request to dismiss plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim should be denied.7
B.

Plaintiff Adequately Alleges a Claim for Corporate Waste

The Trustees argue that plaintiff has failed to adequately allege waste. Motion at 19-20.
However, plaintiff has met his pleading burden for this claim. “[A]lthough there is a stringent
standard to prove a claim of corporate waste at trial, [plaintiff] need only state a plausible claim
of corporate waste to survive a motion to dismiss under Iqbal.” Swingless Golf Club Corp. v.
Taylor, 679 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 1071 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (emphasis in original). See also Stern v.
General Electric Co., 86- 4055 (MJL), 1992 WL 8195, at * 5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 1992) (court
6

The Trustees concede as much in their Preliminary Statement in which they assert that plaintiff
alleges “conscious wrongdoing by the Independent Trustees in permitting the allegedly unlawful
payments.” Motion. at 2.
7

As plaintiff does not allege a Caremark claim, the cases cited by the Trustees are inapposite.
See, e.g., Desimone, 924 A.2d at 939 (plaintiff’s complaint alleged a Caremark claim based on
defendant directors’ “fail[ure] to adequately monitor” its finance reporting system); Canadian
Commer. Workers Indus. Pension Plan v. Alden, No.1184-N, 2006 WL 456786, at * 6-8 (Del.
Ch. Feb. 22, 2006) (plaintiff specifically alleged Caremark claim in the complaint).

15

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 21 of 24

acknowledged that the standard of proving a waste claim is “clearly very high,” but held
complaint’s allegations sufficiently pled a waste claim, and observed that “plaintiff’s claim must
succeed or fail after a thorough discovery process and elaboration of proof.”). As shown below,
plaintiff’s claim for corporate waste is plausible and properly pled.
“The essence of a claim of waste of corporate assets is the diversion of corporate assets
for improper or unnecessary purposes.” Hendersen v. Axiam, Inc., No. 962572D, 1999 WL
33587312, *53 (Mass. Super. Ct. June 22, 1999) (citing Michelson v. Duncan, 407 A.2d 211, 217
(Del. 1979)). Here, plaintiff has pled such a diversion of assets, i.e. use of Trust assets for
unlawful compensation payments to broker-dealers. AC ¶¶ 4, 5, 61, 65.8
The Trustees also contend that plaintiff has failed to allege facts that show that the
Trustees made an “egregious or irrational decision” that “could not have been in the Trust’s best
interest.” Motion at 19-20. They cite Blake v. Smith, No. 0300003 B, 2006 WL 4114305 (Mass.
Super. Dec. 11, 2006), in which an exculpatory clause barred plaintiff’s waste claim because the
claim as pled was too vague and lacked allegations exceeding the bounds of the clause in that
plaintiff did not plead bad faith. See id. at *10 (“Because the alleged conduct by the outside
directors in the claim for corporate waste amounts to ordinary inattention and/or inadvertence,
which does not exceed gross negligence, the exculpatory provision bars the [waste claim].”). In
this instance, plaintiff alleges that the Trustees acted in bad faith because they did not properly
exercise their responsibilities for compliance, and refused to seek a judicial declaration on the
disputed legal issue. See AC ¶¶ 70, 90.

8

The Trustees rely on Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (Del. 2000), in which the court stated that
no waste exists if “there is any substantial consideration received by the corporation.” Id. at 263.
Plaintiff alleges that the Trust and its shareholders were deprived of the advisory accounts for
which they paid, and were legally entitled to receive, which is a lack of consideration, given that
a brokerage account is not a comparable service. AC ¶ 25, 65.

16

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 34

Filed 08/20/10 Page 22 of 24

Finally, the Trustees assert that “significant harm” would “likely result to the Trust by
pursuing litigation” because, if the payments are found to be unlawful, then compliance with the
Advisers Act might be a burden on the broker-dealers. Motion at 20 (citing Response Letter at
7). However, this is just acknowledging that a threshold legal issue is in dispute, and is not
relevant to the adequacy of the waste claim. See In re Sabine, Inc. No. 05-1019, 2006 WL
1045712, at *9 (Bankr. D. Mass. Feb. 27, 2006) (defendant’s argument why waste claim should
be dismissed “is a legal one and inappropriate for motion to dismiss”).
Therefore, plaintiff’s claim for corporate waste, as with other waste claims based on the
payment of improper fees, should be upheld at the motion to dismiss stage. See, e.g., In re Teu
Holdings, Inc., 287 B.R. 26, 35 (Bankr.D.Del. 2002) (when viewed in the light most favorable to
plaintiff, allegation that payment of at least $2 million in fees and expenses for failed services
constituted waste were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); Independent Cellular
Telephone, Inc. v. Barker, No. 15171, 1997 WL 153816, at * 6-7 (Del. Ch. Mar. 21, 1997)
(although allegation that “[t]he payment of such fee is not justified by any service provided” was
“inartfully worded,” the complaint was “sufficiently particularized, and can reasonably be
regarded as alleging waste”).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Motion should be denied in its entirety.
