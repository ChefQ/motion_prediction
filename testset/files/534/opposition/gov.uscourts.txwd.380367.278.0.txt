GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S
SECOND MOTION FOR REVOCATION OF DETENTION ORDER AND REQUEST
FOR A DE NOVO EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND BOND
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
Comes now the United States of America, by and through the
United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, and in
response to Defendant's Second Motion for Revocation of Detention
Order and Request for A De Novo Evidentiary Hearing and Bond, and
respectfully opposes Defendant's motion for the reasons set forth
below:
I.
On September 8, 2009, the Honorable United States Magistrate
Judge J. Scott Hacker of the Southern District of Texas Laredo
Division entered a order detaining the Defendant without bond
pending trial.

In the order the court found amongst of things

that:
(1) There was probable cause to believe that the defendant has

violated a committed an offense for which a maximum term of
imprisonment of 10 years or more was prescribed;
(2) The defendant had not rebutted the presumption established
by the finding that no condition or combination of conditions
would reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as
required and the safety of the community.
On September 28, 2009, the defendant filed a motion to
reconsider bond. This motion was denied by United States Magistrate
Judge John W. Primomo on October 2, 2009.

On October 15, 2009 the

defendant filed his first Motion for Revocation of Detention Order
and request for a De Novo Evidentiary Hearing and Bond. On October
22,2009, the Court held the De Novo Evidentiary Hearing, and after
hearing the government’s evidence and evidence offered by the
defendant denied the defendant’s request for bond.
not appeal this order.

Defendant did

A copy of the transcript of that hearing is

attached as Government’s Exhibit 1.
II.
Under the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) the Bail Reform Act, the
existence of probable cause to believe that the defendant committed
a crime in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 801, et seq., creates a
rebuttable presumption that no conditions of release exist that
would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required
and the safety of the community. United States v. Rueben, 974 F.2d
580, 586 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 113 S .Ct. 1336 (1993).

When the defendant has presented considerable evidence of his
longstanding ties to the locality in which he faces trial, the
presumption of flight has been rebutted. United States v. Jackson,
845 F.2d 1262, 1266 (5th Cir.1988). However, the risk of continued
narcotics trafficking on bail does constitute a risk to the
community.

United

States

v.

Hare,

873

F.2d

796,

798

(5th

Cir.1989)(citing United States v. Hawkins, 617 F.2d 59 (5th Cir.),
cert. denied, 449 U.S. 952, (1980)).

For pretrial detention to be

imposed on a defendant, the lack of reasonable assurance of either
the

defendant's

appearance,

or

the

safety

of

others

or

the

community, is sufficient; both are not required. Hare, 873 F.2d at
799.
Because the defendant was indicted for a drug offense that
could result in terms of imprisonment for ten years or more, he
bares the burden of producing evidence that his release would not
pose a danger to the community. See Rueben

at 586. The production

of evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption does not completely
negate all probative value of the facts underlying the presumption;
the court may still consider the congressional finding that drug
offenders pose a special risk of dangerousness to society. Hare,
873 F.2d at 798-99. But the burden of persuasion then rests with
the government. Id. In determining whether the government meets its
burden, the district court must consider the factors set forth in
18 U.S.C. section 3142(g). These factors include:

3

Case 5:09-cr-00670-FB

Document 278

Page 4 of 9

(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including
whether the offense is a crime of violence or involves a narcotic
drug;
(2) the weight of the evidence against the person;
(3) the history and characteristics of the person, including(A) his character, physical and mental condition, family ties,
employment,

financial

resources,

length

of

residence

in

the

community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug
or

alcohol

abuse,

criminal

history,

and

record

concerning

appearance at court proceedings; and
(B) whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, he was
on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial,
sentencing, appeal, or completion of a sentence for an offense
under Federal, State, or local law; and
(4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the
community that would be posed by the person's release. 18 U.S .C.
§ 3142(g), see Rueben

at 586.
III.

At the October 22, 2009 De Novo hearing the government
proffered evidence of the Defendant’s involvement in the charged
drug conspiracy.

In summary the evidence showed:

(1) that the defendant was the brother in law of Ricardo
Cardenas, who is the main supplier of cocaine and marijuana in the
case and is currently a fugitive in the case;

4

Case 5:09-cr-00670-FB

Document 278

Filed 11/25/2009

Page 5 of 9

(2) that at the direction of Ricardo Cardenas, the defendant
along with co-defendants Gerardo Espinosa and Edgar Gutierrez
escorted approximately 1400 lbs of marijuana from Laredo, Texas to
Chicago, Illinois;
(3) that at the direction of Ricardo Cardenas, the defendant
met with an undercover government agent and provided $14,000 in
U.S. Currency to pay part of the transportation fee of the 1400 lbs
of marijuana, and that the defendants wife Lina Cardenas was
present at the time of this payment.
(4) that at the direction of Ricardo Cardenas, the defendant
was involved in the delivery of approximately 100 kilograms of
cocaine

from

Laredo,

Texas

to

co-defendant

Victor

Monroe

in

Cincinnati, Ohio, and that the defendants wife Lina Cardenas was
present

when

payments

for

cocaine

were

made

by

Monroe

in

Cincinnati.
At

the

De

Novo

hearing

the

defendant

presented

little

information not already contained in the pre-trial service report.
The only different information seems to be that he had reapplied to
attend a local community college and three letters of reference
from former employers.

The defendant did not call as a witness or

proffer any evidence from his wife.
IV.
In his Second Motion for De Novo hearing, the defendant
attaches as an exhibit cell phone records pertaining to telephone

5

Case 5:09-cr-00670-FB

number 956-285-0149.

Document 278

Page 6 of 9

Some of records show the phone subscribed to

by Sanjuana V. Cardenas and pertain to usage from September 18,
2009 until October 7, 2009; other records (apparently not official
bills)shown neither the subscriber nor the number which it pertains
to, and covers the period from 10/08/2009 until November 7, 2009;
and other records (again not official bills) that presumably shows
some of the

usage of 956-285-0149 with Lina Cardenas listed as

user for the period of August 14, 2009 until September 19, 2009.
It is the government’s position that these phone records do
not provide any evidence that is relevant to any issue in the case
nor rebut any presumptions in the case.

Presumably, these records

are being offered to establish that Lina Cardenas has not been in
contact with her fugitive brother.

These records in and of

themselves provide no such assurance.

All these records prove is

that someone (possibly Lina Cardenas) makes several hundred phone
calls per month to various numbers.

The records themselves to not

provide any information as to identify of the subscriber or user of
the phones receiving calls or making calls to this phone; the
physical location of these phones; or the contents of the phone
calls.
Further, even if the government could determine the identity
of the subscribers to these telephone numbers such information
still would not provide any assurance that phone was not being used
by Ricardo Cardenas or other conspirators.

during the investigation that led to the defendant’s arrest Title
III wire intercepts were used on three phones being utilized by codefendants Jose Omar Martinez and Gerardo Martinez. The subscriber
records showed the phones were subscribed to ROBERT SAINTCHARLES
with an address of PO Box 54988, Irvine, CA,
with an address of

YGKJHFGO KXTGHJZDG

PO Box 55026, Irvine, CA, and Omar MARTINE with

an address of 4117 St. Charles Bay, San Antonio, Texas. Because of
the proliferation of disposable cell phone providers and their
obvious lack of concern about the identity of the subscriber or
user, it is impossible to determine who has a cell phone or how
many cell phones a person has.
It is the government’s position that its case against the
defendant is strong, and will result in the defendant being
convicted.

respectfully requests that Defendant's Motion for Revocation of
