before the Honorable J. Scott Hacker, United States Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of
Texas, who granted the Government’s Request for Pretrial Detention on September 8, 2009. This
court granted an evidentiary hearing and heard live

testimony from defense witnesses on

October 22, 2009.
II.
EVIDENCE OFFERED AT THE EVIDENTIARY HEARING
At the evidentiary hearing the Government relied solely on the existence of an Indictment
against Francisco Espinoza and its corresponding presumption, albeit rebuttable, against bond.
The government further noted that Francisco Espinoza’s brother in law is Ricardo Cardenas, the
alleged head of the drug trafficking organization. The name Ricardo Cardenas has yet to be
released in a redacted indictment. The government did not call any witnesses nor presented any
documentary evidence. The government sole basis for recommending detention was Francisco
Espinoza’s relationship to Ricardo Cardenas and the fact that Cardenas has yet to be
apprehended. Francisco Espinoza provided that he has no prior criminal history, is a United
States Citizen and lifelong resident of Laredo, Webb County, Texas, gainful employment,
establishing his own business and returning to school on a full time basis. Francisco Espinoza
established he has no ties to Mexico, except a distant maternal aunt whom he has not visited
since childhoood and is not a flight risk. Francisco Espinoza’s sister, testified that she is a
Certified Public Accountant and she and her siblings and family would be willing to sign as cosureties of Francisco is granted a bond.

As stated earlier, the offense Francisco Espinoza is charged with raise a presumption for
pretrial detention. Once the presumption is triggered, the Defendant bears, at a minimum, the
burden of going forward with some credible evidence contrary to the statutory presumption (see
United States v. Alatishe, 768 F.2d 364 (D.C. Cir 1985); United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378
(1st Cir. 1985) and United States v. Hurtado, 779 F.2d 1468 (11th Cir. 1985); United States v.
Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001) (nothing in “presumption cases,” burden of
persuasion remains with government; defendant “bears a limited burden of production… to rebut
that presumption”).) Francisco Espinoza’s burden of production is “not a heavy one to meet”;
rather, any evidence “favorable to a defendant that comes within a category listed in §3142(g)
can suffice.” United States v. Hammond, 204 F. Supp. and 2d 1157, 1162 (E.D. Wis. 2002).
Francisco Espinoza conceded he was willing to wear an ankle monitor as a condition of his
release. (Use of electronic bracelet “arguably” rebuts presumption. U.S. v. O”Brian, 895 F.2d
810 (1st Cir. 1990); see Kin-Hong v. U.S., 926 F. Supp. 1180 (D. Mass. 1996); US v. Leyba, 10 4
F. Supp. 2d 1182 (S.D. Iowa 2000). Francisco Espinoza provided favorable evidence in more
than one category. In a De Novo hearing, Francisco Espinoza will provide further evidence to
show merits consideration for a bond.
IV.
REQUEST FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HERAING
A Magistrate’s “Order of Detention Pending Trial” is appealable pursuant to the
provision of 18 U.S.C. § 3134(B). This Court is entitled to hear evidence at a de novo hearing
on factors relevant to Francisco Espinoza’s Motion to Bond pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142.
Therefore, Francisco Espinoza respectfully requests that this Honorable Court set this matter
down for an evidentiary hearing in order to bring forward witnesses and other documentary

evidence. Defendant’s wife, Lina Espinoza is prepared to present her cell phone and home
numbers for the court’s consideration in order to show that there has been no communication
between her and her brother prior to and since August 25, 2009 as requested by this court. Refer
to documents attached as Exhibit “A” (cell phone records).
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Francisco Espinoza respectfully prays that this
Honorable Court enter an Order revoking the Magistrate’s “Order of Detention Pending Trial”,
and thereafter enter an Order setting conditions of release of Francisco Espinoza pending trial.
