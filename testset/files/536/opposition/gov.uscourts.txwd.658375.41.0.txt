DEFENDANT RICKHOFF’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST
FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND SUPPORTING BRIEF
TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE
ORLANDO GARCIA
NOW COMES Bexar County Clerk Gerard Rickhoff, in his official
capacity, to file this response to Plaintiffs’ Request for a Preliminary Injunction.
Mr. Rickhoff would show the court as follows:
1.

Plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit against the Bexar County Clerk as well

as several other defendants, including the Governor of the State of Texas and
Texas Attorney General. Plaintiffs wish to marry a person of the same sex but are
prevented from doing so by Texas state law and the Texas State Constitution.
Plaintiffs argue that these certain provisions of the Texas Family Code and the
1

Texas Constitution violate their United States constitutional due process rights and
equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. Plaintiffs are seeking both a
declaration that the Texas State laws are unconstitutional and a permanent
injunction prohibiting their enforcement. Currently pending before the Court is
Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.
2.

The Texas Office of the Attorney General represents the State

Defendants. In the State Defendants’ Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion
for Preliminary Injunction (document 40), the State Defendants address the
constitutional challenges to the statute and constitutional amendment in question.
More importantly at this time, the State Defendants also address the requirements
to be met before a preliminary injunction can be granted. These issues have been
briefed by both the Plaintiffs and the State Defendants.
3.

Plaintiff did not confer with County Clerk Rickhoff in regard to the

request for a preliminary injunction. There is no need to issue an injunction to
include Bexar County Clerk Rickhoff. If a preliminary injunction is entered that
these particular statutes and the constitutional amendment are unconstitutional,
Defendant Rickhoff intends to abide by this Court’s decisions unless such
judgment is reversed or stayed on appeal. In the event Defendant Rickhoff
threatens to disregard a federal judgment and adhere to state law should the state

law be declared unconstitutional, the Court is of course free to reconsider the
necessity of injunctive relief against Defendant Rickhoff.
4.

Defendant Rickhoff has filed a motion to be dismissed from this

lawsuit for failure to state a claim for which relief they seek can be granted. The
only action of Defendant Rickhoff has been adherence to mandated procedures of
existing state law. Defendant Rickhoff did nothing and does nothing different from
what the other 253 county clerks in Texas are required to do in regard to the Texas
Family Code and the stated Constitutional amendment. An injunctive order
against Defendant Rickhoff will not further resolve the issues of the
constitutionality of section 2.001 of the Family Code and the amendment to the
Texas Constitution.
THEREFORE, FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, Bexar County
Gerard Rickhoff would pray that he be dismissed from the above styled and
numbered cause, and for such other relief to which he may show himself entitled.

Respectfully submitted
