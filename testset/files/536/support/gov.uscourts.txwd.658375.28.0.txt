Preliminary Statement
Plaintiffs request that this Court immediately enter an order preliminarily enjoining

Defendants from enforcing Article I, section 32 of the Texas Constitution and corresponding
provisions in the Texas' Family Code (collectively, "Section 32).1 Section 32 denies Plaintiffs
access to the institution of marriage, its numerous rights, privileges, and responsibilities, for the
sole reason that they love and wish to be married to a person of the same sex. As such, Section
32 violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The

Constitution requires that these laws be declared unenforceable. Justice requires that this relief
be afforded immediately, fully, and for all time.
In a society that celebrates marriages of long duration, these Plaintiffs are unlikely ever to

celebrate the milestones many of our parents achieved because Section 32 expressly deems them
unworthy to be married, even while it makes that institution available virtually without
restriction to all heterosexual citizens of lawful age. Time and time again, the Supreme Court
has recognized and affirmed the fundamental right to marry. "The freedom to marry has long

been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by
free men." Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S.

1, 12

(1967). It is "the most important relation in life"

and of "fundamental importance for all individuals." Zablocki

v.

Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384

(1978). Because of its importance and fundamental nature, "[c]hoices about marriage" are

"sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard,
or disrespect." ML.B.

v.

S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).

The statutes include Tex. Fam. Code

204156357 v8

§

2.00 1 and Tex. Fam. Code

§

6.204.

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 13 of 61

Section 32 infringes on the fundamental due process right to marry, which is "central to

personal dignity and autonomy" and "central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth

Amendment." Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 574 (2003) (quoting Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa.

v.

Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851(1992)). "Persons in a homosexual relationship

may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do." Id. Preventing same-

sex couples in Texas from marrying and refusing to recognize same-sex marriages performed in

other states violates due process by denying Texan same-sex couples, like Plaintiffs, the
autonomy and liberty that the Constitution guarantees them.
Section 32 also violates the basic rule of equal protection that "the Constitution 'neither

knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." Romer
(quoting Plessy

v.

v.

Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 623 (1996)

Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting)). As the Supreme

Court recently recognized, restricting the rights, benefits, and responsibilities of marriage to

opposite-sex couples only "demeans the [same-sex] couple, whose moral and sexual choices the
Constitution protects." United States

v.

Windsor, 133 5. Ct. 2675, 2694 (2013) (citing Lawrence,

539 U.S. at 588). The Constitution prohibits laws that "impose a disadvantage, a separate status,

and so a stigma upon" gay men and lesbians. Id.; see Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 574 (2003); Romer,
517 U.S. at 635.

Just as the judicial branch protected the, fundamental right to marry and established that

discriminatory laws could not prevent mixed-race couples from exercising that right, the courts
again must step in, protect the marriage right, and establish that Section 32 is unconstitutional.

This Court should follow the Supreme Court's lead in Windsor, Lawrence, Romer, Loving, and
so many other cases that have enshrined the right to marry as a fundamental right and recognize

204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 14 of 61

that governments must give all of its citizens' choice of spouses the "same status and dignity"
regardless of whether they are same- or opposite-sex. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2689.
Unless this Court takes immediate action, Plaintiffs and others like them will continue to

suffer irreparable

harmnot in some theoretical sense, but in real human

terms. This morning,

Plaintiffs woke up in a world unimaginable to the majority of citizens, a world in which Plaintiffs
are denied equal rights, and thus deemed inferior, because of their sexual

orientationa

characteristic as immutable as their sex, their skin color, or their nationality. Today, children of
same-sex parents attended school and suffered the stigma that their parents are not permitted to
wed, that they are the product of relationships between citizens the state deems unworthy and
inferior, and they will wear that badge of inferiority to bed tonight. Today, or perhaps tomorrow,

someone in a long-term committed same-sex relationship will die without ever having been
married to the person he or she loves, or without having their marriage recognized by the State of
Texas.

There is no order this Court can enter at some later date that will heal the wounds

inflicted today, or restore the status deprived today, or repair the harm already incurred today.
But if this Court determines that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claimsas
it should, as it

mustthen the Court must afford preliminary relief as soon as practicable and

forestall the harm that is certain to occur tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. This

Court is uniquely charged to afford these Plaintiffs relief. "Under our constitutional system,
courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise
suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are non-conforming

victims of prejudice and public excitement." Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 241 (1940).

204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 15 of 61

Defendants are likely to come forth with justifications for this inequitable law that are not
only unfounded, but transparently false. There exist many sound, beneficial purposes to

marriage, but all of them apply with equal force to same-sex unions, and none of them are
undermined by permitting citizens of the same sex to marry. Strip away the fictions and pretext

surrounding Section 32, and it becomes clear that Section 32 is law only because there are votes
and political power to be won by fomenting fear and prejudice at an unpopular minority.
Treating all citizens equally under the law is not merely an aspiration but a constitutional
dictate. If morality is to be our guide, as Defendants may argue, let it be that fine quality of

morality enshrined in the Constitution, which requires that we treat all citizens with equal dignity
and respect under the law. It is the ingenious character of the Constitution that this equal

protection serves to permit members of minority groups to become full participants in society, so
that their talents and skills may be harnessed for the greater good. Denying gay and lesbian
citizens of Texas an equal right to marry signifies that they are inferior to other citizens. This not
only gives the green light to those who would exclude, mistreat, and demean them based on their
sexual orientation, but it perpetuates such discrimination. Unless and until this Court protects

Texas' gay and lesbian citizens, the history of discrimination and prejudice will continue
unabated.
Accordingly, this Court should find: (1) that Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of
success on the merits, i.e., that Section 32 is unconstitutional; and (2) Plaintiffs are irreparably

harmed by Texas' refusal to permit them to marry or have their out-of-state marriages

recognized. The Court should therefore award Plaintiffs injunctive relief and immediately enjoin
enforcement of Section 32.

II.

Texas' Constitution and Statutes Unconstitutionally Ban Same-Sex Marriage.
A.

The Texas Legislature Banned Same-Sex Marriage in 1997 And Broadened
the Ban By Enacting Texas' Defense of Marriage Act in 2003.

Texas Family Code

§

2.001, enacted in its current form in 1997, prohibits the county

clerk of any Texas county from issuing a license for the marriage of persons of the same sex.
In 2003, the Texas Legislature further amended the Texas Family Code to add

§

6.204,

which, among other things, prohibits recognition in Texas of lawful same-sex marriages from

otherjurisdictions. Ex. 11, S.B. 7,78th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2003); Ex. 12, H.B. 38, 78th Leg.,
Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2003). Section 6.204 declares void all marriages between persons of the same

sex and all civil unions. Tex. Fam. Code

§

6.204(b). Section 6.204 also prohibits the state and

any of its agencies and political subdivisions from giving effect to any:
(1) public act, record, or judicial proceeding that creates,
recognizes, or validates a marriage between persons of the same
sex or a civil union in this state or in any other jurisdiction; or

7
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 19 of 61

(2) right or claim to any legal protection, benefit, or responsibility
asserted as a result of a marriage between persons of the same sex
or a civil union in this state or in any other jurisdiction.
Tex. Fam. Code

§

6.204(c).

Supporters of § 6.204 claimed:
The procreative marriage relationship between a man and a woman
is a fundamental institution whose purpose is the propagation of
the species in humanity's collective interest. The state has an
interest in protecting this relationship, because it gives women and
children the surest protection against poverty and abuse, provides
for the healthy psychological development of children, and avoids
health risks of same-sex relations and promiscuity. The state's
recognition of same-sex marriages would undermine the institution
of marriage and society's ability to transmit its values to younger
generations.
Ex. 13, House Research Org., Report on Major Issues, 78th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 83 (Tex. 2003).
In addition to the grounds cited in the legislative report, supporters of the bill also

claimed it was necessary to prohibit the recognition of out-of-state civil unions because

recognizing civil unions: (1) "would create a new class of children without mothers or fathers"
that "would increase costs to corporations and governmental entities" because a family headed
by same-sex parents could not fulfill the children's needs; (2) "could lead to the recognition of

bigamy, voluntary incest, pedophilia, and group marriage" and (3)" [i]f the state does not draw

the line here, it would be difficult to draw anywhere." Ex. 14, House Research Org., Daily Floor
Report, 78th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 27-29 (Tex. April 29, 2003).
As Representative Chisum, one of the sponsors of the legislation, stated: "This bill does

discriminate. It allows only for a man and a woman to be married in this state and to be
recognized as married in this state. This bill does discriminate against any other kind of
marriage." Ex. 15, Rachel Stone, Same-Sex Marriage Ban Goes to Perry; Governor Expected to

San Antonio Express-News, May 1, 2003, at 6A

(emphasis added).
B.

After Twice Banning Same-Sex Marriage In Its Statutes, Texas Added A
Constitutional Amendment Banning Same-Sex Marriage.

Article I, section 32 of the Texas Constitution began as H.J.R. 6, which proposed to
amend the Texas Constitution to define marriage to "consist only of the union of one man and
one woman." Ex. 16, H.J.R. 6, 79th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2005). On April 25, 2005,

subdivision (b) was added to H.J.R. 6, which would expressly bar the state and any political
subdivision thereof from creating or recognizing any legal status identical or similar to marriage.
Ex. 56, House Journal, 79th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 2202 (Tex. Apr. 25, 2005).

The legislative history of H.J.R. 6 shows that the amendment was supported by the same

purported purposes as

§

6.204. The primary argument in support of H.J.R. 6 was:

[T]raditional marriage consisting of a man and a woman is the
basis for a healthy, successful, stable environment for children. It
is the surest way for a family to enjoy good health, avoid poverty,
and contribute to their community. The sanctity of marriage is
fundamental to the strength of Texas' families, and the state should
ensure that no court decision could undermine this fundamental
value.
Ex. 17, House Research Org., Bill Analysis, 79th Leg., Reg. Sess., at 3-4 (Tex. 2005). Not only

did the authors of the amendment draft the amendment to preclude same-sex couples from

marrying, but they also drafted it to preclude any "separate but equal" status, such as civil
unions. According to supporters of the amendment, "[t]his constitutional provision also would

protect the definition of marriage by ensuring that civil unions were not permitted in the future.
Civil unions are a way for same-sex couples to circumvent laws protecting marriage by creating
a legal arrangement that is substantially the same as marriage in all but the name." Ex. 18,

204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 21 of 61

House Research Org., Focus Report on Amendments Proposed for the 2005 Ballot, 79th Leg.,
Reg. Sess., at 9 (Tex. 2005).
Following votes in both houses of the Texas legislature, H.J.R. 6 passed. Under Texas
law, the governor's approval is not necessary to put a proposed constitutional amendment on the

ballot. See Tex. Const. art. 17,

§

1(a). Nevertheless, in early June 2005 Governor Perry

ceremonially signed the proposed constitutional amendment at the Calvary Christian Academy in
Fort Worth. Ex. 19, Jessica Leeder, Parental Consent Bill Signed into Law: Ceremony at

Christian School in Fort Worth Draws 250 Protesters, Dallas Morning News, June 6, 2005, at
1A. After doing so, a reporter asked Perry what he would say to gay and lesbian military

veterans who wanted to live in Texas. His response: "Texas has made a decision on marriage,
and if there's a state with more lenient views than Texas, then maybe that's where they should
live." Ex. 10, R.A. Dyer, Gay-rights group demands apology, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, June
10, 2005, at B5. In short, those denied equal protection under the laws

of the State of Texas by

virtue of Proposition 2 should "self-deport" to a state where they may enjoy their constitutional
rights.
After approval by Texas' legislature and Defendant Perry's unnecessary approval, H.J.R.
6 was on the ballot in 2005 as Proposition 2. Proposition 2 passed with approximately 76%

of

the vote. See Ex. 20, Janet Elliott, Gay Marriage Ban Put in Texas Constitution, Houston

Chronicle, Nov. 9, 2005, at Al; Ex. 48, Office of the Texas Secretary of State, Race Summary
Report, 2005 Constitutional amendment Election (Nov. 8, 2005). As a result, Article

of Rights) of the Texas Constitution included a new Section 32:
(a) Marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one

man and one woman.
(b) This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create
or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage.

Section 32 Causes Numerous Harms To Plaintiffs and All Similarly Situated SameSex Couples.
A.

Plaintiffs' Inability To Marry Affects Numerous Federal Protections,
Benefits, And Obligations.

Texas' refusal to permit Plaintiffs to marry or recognize their out-of-state marriage

deprives Plaintiffs of numerous federal protections, benefits, and obligations that are available to
married same-sex couples.

See Windsor, 133 S. Ct.

at 2683 (noting that over 1,000 federal laws

address marital or spousal status). These federal rights include, among others, having the same
rights as heterosexual married couples in one another's Social Security benefits, 42 U.S.C.
seeking protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C.
Medicaid benefits.

416,

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 23 of 61

Same-sex couples residing in Texas cannot rely upon an out-of-state marriage to confer
federal protections, benefits, and obligations. Texas same-sex couples who marry in another
state must contend with substantial uncertainty regarding whether the federal government will

recognize their marriage for all purposes. For instance, while the Internal Revenue Service
recently adopted a "state of celebration" rule in recognizing same-sex marriages, Ex. 21, Rev.

Ruling 2013-17, at 9 (Aug. 30, 2013), it is unclear what federal agencies will enact similar rules.
Indeed, the Department of Labor recently announced that the Family Medical Leave Act applies

only to same-sex couples that reside in states recognizing their marriage. See Ex. 22, Dept. of
Labor, Fact Sheet #28F: Qualifying Reasons for Leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act

(Aug. 2013).
Section 32 and the corresponding statutes similarly operate to deny certain benefits to gay

and lesbian service members. In an August 30, 2013 letter to military personnel at state-run
installations, Texas Military

Forces2

were directed to deny same-sex couples enrollment access to

federal healthcare and retirement benefits at Texas-based National Guard facilities. See Ex. 23,
Chris Tomlinson, Texas National Guard Commander Asks for Legal Opinion on Same Sex

Military Benefits, Tyler Morning Telegraph (Sept. 6, 2013); Ex. 24, Josh Hicks, Texas National

Guard Denies Benefits for Same-Sex Spouses, The Washington Post (September 4, 2013).
Instead, these service members and their families must travel to federal installations elsewhere in
the state to enroll and obtain access to standard military benefits. In response, United States
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel reprimanded Texas and the Texas National Guard for failing
to grant full spousal benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian members of the armed forces. Ex.

The Texas Military Forces comprises the Texas Army National Guard, the Texas Air
National Guard, and the Texas State Guard.

ARGUMENT
Courts consider four factors to determine if a preliminary injunction is proper. First, the
party seeking the preliminary injunction must show a substantial likelihood of success on the

merits. Deerfield Med. Ctr.

v.

City of Deerjleld Beach, 661 F. 2d 328, 332 (5th Cir. 1981).

Second, there must be "a substantial threat that plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the

injunction is not granted." Id. Third, the injury the plaintiff may suffer must outweigh the
potential harm, if any, that the injunction will cause the defendant. Id. Finally, the preliminary
injunction must not disserve the public interest. Id. Plaintiffs satisfy each of these requirements,

and the Court should issue a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from enforcing Section
32.

Below, Plaintiffs first demonstrate they have a substantial likelihood of success on the

merits by showing that Section 32 violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs then show that they have
satisfied the remaining requirements for a preliminary injunction.
I.

The Refusal To Marry Same Sex Couples Violates Due Process And EQual
Protection Under The United States Constitution.
Section 32 is unconstitutional. First, Section 32's prohibition of same-sex marriages

deprives Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss of due process in violation of the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, Section 32's prohibition of same-sex marriage deprives

Plaintiffs Holmes and Phariss of equal protection, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Third, although the Court should apply heightened scrutiny, Section 32
fails even the more-lenient rational basis inquiry. Defendants simply have no rational basis to

support Section 32 and, as the evidence shows, the bases offered in the past fail. Fourth, Section

32's refusal to recognize legal out-of-state marriages violates Plaintiffs De Leon's and

14
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 26 of 61

Dimetman's Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights. Finally, Baker v.
Nelson is not precedential because subsequent cases undermine its reasoning.

The Denial Of The Right To Marry Deprives Plaintiffs Holmes And Phariss
Of Due Process.

A.

The right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution.

E.g., Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 384 ("[D]ecisions of this Court confirm that the right to marry is of

fundamental importance for all individuals."); Loving, 388 U.S. at 12 (1967) ("The freedom to
marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit

of happiness by free men."). The Court has founded the right to marry in privacy, Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965); liberty, Meyer

v.

Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923);

and association, ML.B., 519 U.S. at 116. "Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse,
hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred." Griswold, 381 U.S. at 486.
This fundamental right entails the ability to marry the partner of one's choosing. See generally
Loving, 388 U.S. at 12 (due process is violated by denial of right to marry a person of another

race).

Most recently, the Supreme Court recognized that marriage involves one of "the most
intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime.

.

.

." Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 574

(quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 851). The right to marry is "central to personal dignity and

autonomy.

. .

central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment." Id. (quoting

Casey, 505 U.S. 833). And Lawrence recognized that "[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship
may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do." Id.

Denying homosexuals the right to marry and to select the partners of their choosing
violates due process in the same fashion as the anti-miscegenation laws struck down in Loving.
Holmes and Phariss seek to exercise the right to marry the partner of their choosing, just as the

15
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 27 of 61

plaintiffs in Loving did, despite the State's purported moral disdain for their choice of partner.
However, that the State may prefer to elevate one type of marriage over another does not permit
it to deny each citizen the "freedom of personal choice" in deciding whom to marry, nor may it

deny each citizen's decision the "same status and dignity." Windsor, 133 5. Ct. at 2689.
By denying Holmes and Phariss the fundamental right to marry, Texas denies their

relationship the same status and dignity afforded citizens who are permitted to marry. It also

denies them the benefits of marriagelegal, social, and financial that opposite-sex couples
enjoy. As the Supreme Court recently recognized, a state's "definition of marriage is the

foundation of the State's broader authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations with

respect to the protection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital

responsibilities." Id. at 2691 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Turner v. Safley, 482
U.S. 78, 96 (1987) ("[M]arital status often is a precondition to the receipt of government benefits

(e.g., Social Security benefits), property rights (e.g., tenancy by the entirety, inheritance rights),

and other, less tangible benefits (e.g., legitimation of children born out of wedlock).");

Massachusetts

v.

US. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 682 F.3d

1,

11(1st Cir. 2012) ("Loss of

survivor's social security, spouse-based medical care and tax benefits are major detriments on
any reckoning; provision for retirement and medical care are, in practice, the main components

of the social safety net for vast numbers of Americans.").
By categorically denying the right to marry to a class of citizens, Section 32 "interfere[s]

directly and substantially with the right to marry" and can withstand constitutional challenge
only if it survives strict scrutiny. See Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 386-87 (applying strict scrutiny

because statute that prevented non-custodial parents from marrying unless they provided proof of
compliance with child support obligations or obtained a court order would prevent some in the

16
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 28 of 61

affected class of people from ever marrying and would seriously intrude on the ability of those
who could comply). Section 32 survives strict scrutiny and is constitutional only if"it is
supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those

interests." See id. at 388; Carey

v.

Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 686 (1977).

As discussed below (Argument, Section I.C.), Defendants cannot satisfy their burden of

proving that Section 32 is constitutional.3 They cannot identify any compelling state interest that
is served by denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry and even

if they could,

any such interest could be served through less restrictive measures than a total ban on same-sex

marriages.
B.

The Denial Of The Right To Marry Deprives Plaintiffs Holmes And Phariss
Of Equal Protection.

"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State
shall 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,' which is

essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." City of
Cleburne,

Tex. v.

Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (quoting Plyler v. Doe, 457

U.s. 202, 216 (1982)). By refusing to permit a same-sex couple like Holmes and Phariss to
marry, Section 32 "demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution

protects." Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694 (citing Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 588). As with the federal
law before the Supreme Court in Windsor, Section 32 identifies a "subset" of relationships

(same-sex relationships) for which Texas denies the same equal rights, responsibilities, and
benefits that opposite-sex couples receive in their right to marry. Thus, Section 32 is squarely
subject to equal protection scrutiny under the federal and Texas Constitutions.

' The individual defendants are properly defendants in this case under 42 U.S.C.
as they were acting under color of state law at all relevant times.

Texas' Same-Sex Marriage Ban Should Be Subject To Heightened
Scrutiny.

1.

Not every equal protection challenge is subject to the same test. The Supreme Court has
recognized that the "promise that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws must
coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another,
with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons." Romer, 517 U.S. at 631 (citing Pers.
Admin. of Mass.

v.

Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 27 1-72 (1979)). However, the Supreme Court

consistently applies heightened scrutiny to laws that discriminate against a group that it considers
a suspect or quasi-suspect classification, i.e., one that has experienced a "history of purposeful

unequal treatment or [has] been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped
characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities." Mass. Bd. of Ret.

v.

Murgia, 427 U.S. 307,

313 (1976) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Pedersen

v.

Office ofPers.

Mgmt,, 881 F. Supp. 2d 294 (D. Conn. 2012) (finding statutory classifications based on sexual

orientation are entitled to heightened scrutiny); Golinski v. US. Office
Supp. 2d 968,

3

ofPers.

Mgmt., 824 F.

14-333 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (same). In addition to looking to the history of

discrimination, courts also consider whether the characteristics that distinguish the class indicate
a typical class member's ability to contribute to society, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-441; whether

the distinguishing characteristic is "immutable" or beyond the group member's control, Lyng v.

Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); and whether the group is "a minority or politically
powerless," Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Although gay men and lesbians fulfill all four factors supporting heightened scrutiny, no
single factor is dispositive. Murgia, 427 U.S. at 321. The presence of any of the factors is a
signal that the particular classification is "more likely than others to reflect deep-seated prejudice

rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some legitimate objective," thus triggering

interest" to pass constitutional muster. Plyler, 457 U.S. at 216.

Heightened Scrutiny Applies Because Gays and Lesbians Suffer a
Long History of Discrimination.

For centuries, the prevailing attitude toward gays and lesbians has been "one of strong
disapproval, frequent ostracism, social and legal discrimination, and at times ferocious

punishment." Ex. 26, Richard A. Posner, Sex and Reason 291 (1992); see also Ex. 27, Evan
Gerstmann, The Constitutional Underclass: Gays, Lesbians, and the Failure of Class-Based

Equal Protection 62-66 (1999) (cataloguing the "numerous legal disadvantages" suffered by gay
men and lesbians "in twentieth-century America"). Gay men and lesbians have been denied

employment, targeted for violence, publicly humiliated, and treated as perverts, sinners, and

criminals. See Ex. 28, American Psychological Association, Answers to Your Questions For A

Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation & Homosexuality (2008) ("Lesbian, gay, and
bisexual people in the United States encounter extensive prejudice, discrimination, and violence

because of their sexual orientation. Intense prejudice against lesbians, gay men, and bisexual

people was widespread throughout much of the 20th century."); Ex. 29, FBI, Hate Crime

Statistics 2011, http ://www.fbi .gov/about-us/cj is/ucr/hate-crime/20 11/tables/table-I (showing
that, after racial minorities, gays and lesbians are the most frequent victims of hate crimes).

v.

Marsh, 881 F.2d 454, 465-66 (7th Cir. 1989)

("Homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination and still do, though possibly now in
less degree."). Several recent decisions have recounted this long history of discrimination. See,

e.g., Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 314-15; Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 985-86; Perry

v,

Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 981-91 (N.D. Cal. 2010), aff'd, 671 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir.

district court's decision).
Through much of the twentieth century, homosexuality was characterized by the medical
establishment as a "disease," "mental defect," "disorder," or "degeneration." Such medical

pronouncements provided "a powerful source of legitimation to anti-homosexual sentiment,
much as medical science had previously legitimized widely held (and subsequently discarded)
beliefs about male superiority and white racial superiority." Ex. 30, George Chauncey, Why
Marriage? The History Shaping Today's Debate Over Gay Equality 17 (2004). Indeed, the Fifth
Circuit has observed that "the strong objection to homosexual conduct ... has prevailed in
Western culture for the past seven centuries." Baker

v.

Wade, 769 F.2d 289, 292 (5th Cir. 1985).

Homosexual conduct was a criminal offense in many state laws until the Supreme Court struck
down those laws in Lawrence. See Id.; see also Bowers

v.

Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 192 (1986),

overruled, Lawrence, 539 U.S. 558.
Federal laws also institutionalized discrimination against gays and lesbians. The military
formally barred gays and lesbians from serving in World War II. Ex. 31, Nathaniel Frank,
Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America 9 (2009).
During the 1950s, President Eisenhower issued an executive order requiring the discharge of

homosexual employees, among others, from all federal employment. Ex. 32, Exec. Order No.

10450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (1953). A Senate subcommittee investigated the "problem" of

government-employed homosexuals and determined that "homosexuals and other sex perverts
are not proper persons to be employed in Government for two reasons; first, they are generally

unsuitable, and second, they constitute security risks." Ex. 33, 5. Doc. No. 241, Employment of

Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government, 81st Congress, at

3

(1950). The federal

government's employment discrimination against gay men and lesbians continued until the late
1990s. See Ex. 34, Letter from John W. Macy, Chairman, Civil Service Commission, to the

Mattachine Society of Washington (Feb. 25, 1966) (rejecting the Society's request that the
federal government rescind its policy against employing homosexuals because of, among other

reasons, the "revulsion of other employees" and the "unavoidable subjection of the sexual
deviate to erotic stimulation through on-the-job use of the common toilet, shower and living

facilities"); Ex. 35, Exec. Order No. 13087, 63 Fed. Reg. 30097 (June 2, 1998) (adding "sexual

gays and lesbians from entering the country. Ex. 36, Immigration Act of 1917, Pub. L. No. 64301, §3, 39 Stat. 874, 875 (1917) (requiring exclusion of "persons of constitutional psychopathic

Discrimination against gays and lesbians is deeply entrenched in Texas. Although
Lawrence struck down as unconstitutional the Texas statute criminalizing sodomy, subsequent
and repeated efforts to repeal the unconstitutional statute have failed. See Ex. 38 (H.B. 3232,
H.B. 1701, and S.B. 538, 83rd Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2013) (passed out of committee); H.B.

Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2009) (same); H.B. 1326, 80th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2007) (same)). In Texas,

calling someone a "homosexual," or using a slang word implying the same, has been held to
constitute slander per se because doing so implies that the person has violated a criminal law.

Heady. Newton, 596 S.W.2d 209, 210 (Tex. App. 1980). State law does not prohibit
discrimination against gays and lesbians, and Texas courts have expressly found homosexuality
to be permissible grounds for denying employment. City of Dallas

Indeed, even after Windsor, Texas defiantly continues to discriminate against gays and

lesbians serving in the National Guard, by refusing to issue military IDs to same-sex spouses of

service members at National Guard facilities. This, in the words of the United States Secretary

of Defense, "causes division among the ranks, and it furthers prejudice, which DOD has fought

Heightened Scrutiny Applies Because Sexual Orientation Is Not
Related to the Ability of Gays and Lesbians to Contribute to
Society.

Like other suspect classifications such as race, national origin, and religion, sexual

orientation has no "relation to [the] ability" of a person "to perform or contribute to society."
City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-4 1 (citation omitted); Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 3 18-19

("[T]he long-held consensus of the psychological and medical community is that 'homosexuality

Sexual orientation also does not prevent same-sex couples from forming long-lasting and

successful relationships. Indeed, "[s]ame-sex couples are identical to opposite-sex couples in the

characteristics relevant to the ability to form successful marital unions. Like opposite-sex
couples, same-sex couples have happy, satisfying relationships and form deep emotional bonds

and strong commitments to their partners." Perry, 704

couples also are just as capable of raising well-adjusted children. Id. at 980-8 1 ("Children raised

successful and well-adjusted."). In the field of developmental psychology, "[t]he research

Heightened Scrutiny Applies Because Sexual Orientation is
Immutable.

A law is more likely to receive heightened scrutiny if it discriminates against an

individual based on a characteristic that he or she either cannot realistically change, or ought not
to be compelled to change because it is fundamental to his or her identity. See, e.g., Plyler, 457

U.S. at 220 (noting that illegal alien children "have little control" over that status); Nyquist v.

Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1,9 n.h (1977) (treating resident aliens as a suspect class despite their ability

24
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 36 of 61

to opt out of that class); Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 677, 689 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (noting that a

[c]lassification[] based on ... religion, of course, would trigger strict scrutiny").
Sexual orientation falls within this category of defining personal characteristics. As the
Supreme Court acknowledges, sexual orientation is so fundamental to a person's identity that one

ought not be forced to choose between one's sexual orientation and one's rights as an

individualeven if one could make such a choice. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 576-77 (recognizing
that individual decisions by consenting adults concerning the intimacies of their physical
relationships are "an integral part of human freedom"). Federal courts have repeatedly
recognized that "[s]exual orientation and sexual identity are immutable," Hernandez-Montiel

v.

INS, 225 F.3d 1084, 1093 (9th Cir. 2000); "[s]exual orientation is fundamental to a person's

identity," Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 964-66; and "[h]omosexuality is as deeply ingrained as

heterosexuality," Hernandez-Montiel, 225 F.3d at 1093 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The scientific consensus is that sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic. See,
e.g., Ex. 42, G.M. Herek, et al. Demographic, Psychological, and Social Characteristics ofSelf
IdentUled Lesbian, Gay, and BisexualAdults in a US. Probability Sample, 7 Sexuality Res. &
Soc. Pol'y 176, 186 and 188 (2010) (noting that in a national survey, 95 percent of gay men and
84 percent

of lesbian women reported that they "had little or no choice about their sexual

orientation"); Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 320-21 (finding that the immutability of sexual

orientation "is supported by studies which document the prevalence of long-lasting and
committed relationships between same-sex couples as an indication of the enduring nature of the
characteristic"). Courts that have examined literature and evidence have concluded that sexual
orientation is not something that people can change. E.g., Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 966 ("No
credible evidence supports a finding that an individual may, through conscious decision,

881 F. Supp. 2d at 321 (citing reports and statements by American Psychiatric Association,

American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of
Social Workers, and the American Academy of Pediatrics critical of programs that purport to

"treat" homosexuals to "change" their sexual orientation). An American Psychological
Association task force concluded that therapeutic programs designed to "change" sexual
orientation are not only ineffective, but actually harmful. Ex. 43, Am. Psychological Ass'n Task
Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation, 2009, Report of the Task
Force at 2-3.

Heightened Scrutiny Applies Because Gay Men and Lesbians Lack
Political Power to Eliminate Significant Constitutional and
Statutory Disadvantages.

Gay and lesbian citizens constitute a minority group that lacks sufficient political power
to protect themselves against discriminatory laws. Currently, there are six openly gay or lesbian

members of the House of Representatives and one Senatorconstituting about one percent of
the 535 members of Congress. Ex. 44, Jeremy W. Peters, Openly Gay, and Openly Welcomed in

Congress, N.Y. Times, January 26, 2013, at Al.
Texas' record of electing openly gay or lesbian lawmakers is even more sparse. In
January 2013, Mary Rodriguez became only the second openly gay or lesbian legislator in Texas
history. Ex. 45, Zahira Torres, Gay El Paso rep writes self into Texas Legislature history, El

Paso Times, Jan. 9, 2013. She is the only openly gay or lesbian legislator currently serving

among the 150 members of the Texas House. There has never been an openly gay or lesbian

member of the Texas Senate.
The history of same-sex marriage bans illustrate the lack of political power possessed by
gays and lesbians. Before 1993, only three states expressly restricted marriage to opposite-sex

couples. Andrew Koppelman, The Difference the Mini-DOMAs Make, 38 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 265
(2007). By 2006, 40 states had enacted such bans. Id. at 265-66. Between 1998 and 2006, thirty

states passed constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage. Most recently, North
Carolina passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2012. Ex. 46,
Campbell Robertson, Ban on Gay Marriage Passes in North Carolina, N.Y. Times, May 9, 2012,
at A 15.
In Texas, H.J.R. 6, the bill that became Article I, § 32, had five authors and 74 co-authors
in the House of Representativesa legislative body with 150 members. Ex. 57. Thus, more

than half of the state's representatives claimed authorship or co-authorship of the discriminatory
same-sex marriage ban, reflecting the legislators' enthusiasm to be seen not just as a proponent

of the law, but as its creator. H.J.R. 6 passed the House with a vote of 102-29 and the Senate
with a vote of 21-8. Ex. 47, H.J.R. Res. 6, 79th Leg. (Tex. 2005). It then was approved as

Proposition 2 by voters by a more than 3-to-i margin, receiving 76.25% approval. Ex. 48, Office

of the Texas Secretary of State, Race Summary Report, 2005 Constitutional amendment Election,
(Nov. 8, 2005). Previously, Family Code

§

6.204, which prohibits same-sex marriages and civil

unions, was enacted in 2003 by a vote of 118-9 in the Texas House, and by voice-vote in the
Texas Senate. Ex.

ii, Tex. S.B. 7,78th Leg., Reg.

Sess. (Tex. 2003).

Moreover, as discussed above, despite the fact that Texas' sodomy law is

unconstitutional, every attempt to repeal it has failed. It remains on Texas' books to this day, as
does the mandate that students be instructed that homosexual conduct is criminal.

These facts overwhelmingly demonstrate that gays and lesbians lack substantial political
power, establishing that this factor weighs in favor of applying heightened scrutiny to Section 32.
See also Ex. 5, DecI. of Gary M. Segura in Supp. of Pls' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. ¶ 10 ("Gay men

and lesbians do not possess a meaningful degree of political power and are politically

vulnerable."). However, even if the small strides that gays and lesbians have made politically
would suggest they have political power, courts give less weight to this factor than the others.
Indeed, the Supreme Court recognizes women as a quasi-suspect class despite the fact that this
group is neither a minority nor truly politically powerless. Frontiero

v.

Richardson, 411 U.S.

677, 686 n. 17 (1973) (plurality opinion) (acknowledging that women "do not constitute a small
and powerless minority"); Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 326-27 (recognizing this factor receives

less weight); see also In re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal.4th 757, 842-43 (2008) (concluding that

political powerlessness cannot be required for heightened scrutiny to apply because other groups
like women and African Americans continue to be accorded heightened protection although they
no longer lack political power).
2.

Past Cases Holding That Equal Protection Challenges By Gays And
Lesbians Are Not Subject To Heightened Scrutiny Are Not Controlling.

Defendants may argue that heightened scrutiny should not apply by citing older cases that
have analyzed equal protection claims using the rational basis test. The decisions in these cases

were premised on a foundation that no longer exists. Accordingly, this Court should follow

newer authority like Golinski and Pedersen, which carefully scrutinized the current legal
landscape in concluding that heightened scrutiny should apply.
The first set of older cases directly held that that equal protection claims by gays and

lesbians were not subject to heightened scrutiny and are only subject to rational basis review.
See, e.g., High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 571;

BenShalom, 881 F.2d at 456. However, as Golinski

explained, these cases relied on the pre-Lawrence decision in Bowers that upheld sodomy laws
and permitted the criminalization of homosexual conduct. Consequently, both cases rationalized

that if homosexual conduct could be criminal, it followed that gays and lesbians could not be a

28
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 40 of 61

suspect class. High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 571 (finding that because states could criminalize

homosexual conduct, "homosexuals cannot constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to

greater than rational basis review for equal protection purposes"); Ben-Shalom, 881 F.2d at 464
(same). Because the Supreme Court reversed Bowers and criminal sodomy laws are

unconstitutional, the underlying premise in cases finding that gay men and lesbians are not
entitled to heightened scrutiny is no longer apt. Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 984; Pedersen, 881
F.

Supp. 2d at 312-13.
Two other major reasons exist to reject those older decisions. First, as Golinski

recognized, High Tech Gays relied on the assumption the homosexuality was a behavioral
decision, not an immutable characteristic. Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 984 (citing High Tech
Gays, 895 F.2d at 5 73-74). As discussed above, that premise is wrong and, under Lawrence, not
a basis for justifying discriminatory legislation toward gays and lesbians. Id. at 984-85; see also

Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 575.
Second, cases like High Tech Gays and Ben-Shalom involved challenges to military

policy on homosexual conduct, which placed them in an unusual and very different context from
the claims here, which arise in civilian context. Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 3 12-13. Because

"individual rights must of necessity be curtailed" within the military, "courts have applied less

stringent standards to constitutional challenges to military rules, regulations and procedures than
they have in the civilian context" and consequently a court's "review of military regulations is
far more deferential than constitutional review .of similar laws or regulations designed for

civilian society." Able v. United States, 155 F.3d 628, 633 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Goldman v.
Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 507 (1986)). For this reason, cases applying a rational-basis review

29
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 41 of 61

in challenges to military policies toward gays and lesbians should not be conclusive in challenges

to non-military legislation. Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. at 3 12-13.

Defendants also may rely upon other decisions that apply rational basis review to laws
discriminating against gays and lesbians. Such cases would include Lawrence, though it was not
decided on equal protection grounds; Romer, 517 U.S. 620, which struck down a Colorado

constitutional amendment that prohibited the passage of measures designed to prevent

discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 532 (5th
Cir. 2004), a case involving a prisoner's challenge to the manner in which he was housed. These

cases did not hold that gays and lesbians are not a suspect classthey did not reach the issue

because the laws failed rational basis review. Romer and Lawrence held that the laws in question
failed rational-basis review, so there was no need for the Supreme Court to decide whether gays
and lesbians were a suspect

classification.5

The same is true of Johnson, which held that the

plaintiff stated a claim for an equal protection violation under a rational basis test. Johnson, 385
F.3d at 532. Because rational basis is the lowest level of constitutional scrutiny, these cases did

not require the courts to analyze whether heightened review was appropriate and, thus, they are

not dispositive of the issue of whether gays and lesbians are suspect classes in this case.
C.

Texas' Same Sex Marriage Ban Fails Both Heightened Scrutiny And Rational
Basis Examination.

To survive heightened scrutiny, Defendants must show that Section 32 is narrowly

tailored to effectuate an important government objective, Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 388, or that
Section 32 is "substantially related to an important governmental objective," Clark v. Jeter, 486
As Pedersen points out, "the word 'suspect' does not appear once in the Supreme
Court's decision in Lawrence and only the dissent in Romer mentions suspect class in a footnote
noting that respondents elected to not appeal to the Supreme Court of Colorado the trial court's
rejection of their argument that homosexuals constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class."
Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2dat3ll.

U.s. 456, 461 (1988) (applying intermediate scrutiny). Under this standard, the Court must find
that statutory classification reflects "a reasoned judgment consistent with the ideal of equal
protection by inquiring whether it may be fairly viewed as furthering a substantial interest of the

state." Plyler, 457 U.S. at 2 17-18. "The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or
invented post hoc in response to litigation," and it must not rely "on overbroad generalizations."
United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). Defendants cannot show that the same-sex

marriage ban satisfies heightened scrutiny. When the Constitution allows convicted felons to
marry, it is impossible to identify an important government objective served by denying the same

right to law-abiding same-sex couples. Turner, 482 U.S. at 94-96 (holding that prisoners were
entitled to fundamental right to marry).
The Court need not decide whether Section 32 fails heightened scrutiny because Section
32 cannot even satisfy the more-lenient rational basis test. Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. To survive

the rational basis test, Section 32 must bear at least some rational relationship to a legitimate

government purpose. Id.; see City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446 (holding that even when there is
a legitimate government purpose, the discrimination must bear at least some rational relationship
to that purpose); Heller

v.

Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 (1993) (rational basis test requires that the

proffered justification for a law "must find some footing in the realities of the subject addressed
by the legislation"). Thus, courts "insist on knowing the relation between the classification

adopted and the object to be attained." Romer, 517 U.S. at 632. A law will not survive rational
basis scrutiny unless it is "narrow enough in scope and grounded in a sufficient factual context

for [the court] to ascertain some relation between the classification and the purpose it serve[s]."
Id. at 632-3 3. "By requiring that the classification bear a rational relationship to an independent

31
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 43 of 61

and legitimate legislative end, we ensure that classifications are not drawn for the purpose of

disadvantaging the group burdened by the law." Id. at 633.
In prior litigation, Defendants identified two bases for Section 32: (1) "to encourage

responsible procreation"; and (2) "to increase the likelihood that children will be raised by a

mother and a father in the context of stable, long-term relationships." See Br. on the Merits of

Resp't the State of Texas, In the Matter of the Marriage ofJB. andH.B., No. 11-0024, at 30
(Tex. Sept. 26, 2011). In other words, the alleged rational basis is "to encourage stable family

environments for procreation and the rearing of children by a mother and father." Id. at 29.
These alleged bases are consistent with the arguments made by Section 32's supporters before
the Texas legislature. See, e.g., Ex. 17, House Research Org., Bill Analysis, 79th Leg., Reg. Sess.
(Tex. 2005) ("A traditional marriage consisting of a man and a woman is the basis for a healthy,

successful, stable environment for children."). These alleged bases do not withstand rational

basis

scrutiny.6

1.

Rather than Encouraging Stable Environments for Procreation, The SameSex Marriage Ban Destabilizes Them.

The notion that the same-sex marriage ban will encourage procreation assumes that

heterosexual marriage is "naturally procreative." But procreation is not and never has been a

6

Notably, neither of the alleged bases is "tradition." Tradition cannot, alone, form a
rational basis for a law. Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 239 (1970); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at
998 ("[T]he state must have an interest apart from the fact of the tradition itself."). "[T]he
argument that the definition of marriage should remain the same for the definition's sake is a
circular argument, not a rational justification." Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 998; see Romer, 517
U.S. at 635 (rejecting a law as "classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something
that the Equal Protection Clause does not permit"); see also Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862,
898 (Ia. 2009) ("A specific tradition sought to be maintained cannot be an important government
objective for equal protection purposes, however, when the tradition is nothing more than the
historical classification currently expressed in the statute being challenged."). Moreover, Section
32 is inconsistent with an important marriage traditionfree choice of marriage partner. See
generally Ex. 6, Decl. of Nancy F. Cott in Supp. of Pls' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. ("Cott Dccl.").

qualification for marriage. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[W]hat

justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples
exercising 'the liberty protected by the Constitution'? Surely not the encouragement of

procreation since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry."); Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at
993 ("The ability to procreate cannot and has never been a precondition to marriage."); Cott

Decl. ¶J 32-3 3.
Further, if Texas intended for Section 32 to reserve marriage for couples that can

procreate by having sex, then the ban is woefully underinclusive. Texas does not prevent the
marriages of the sterile, the elderly, and those who do not intend to have children. A marriage's

validity does not hinge upon consummation. These individualswho cannot or will not

procreateare allowed to marry.

Only same-sex couples are purportedly denied the right to

marry on the basis of this biological limitation. Section 32 makes "no sense in light of how [it]
treat[s} other groups similarly situated in relevant respects," and, consequently, "encouraging

stable environments for procreating" does not provide a rational basis for Section 32. See Bd. of
Trs.

of Univ. ofAla.

v.

Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366 n.4 (2001); Goodridge

v.

Dep't ofPublic

Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 962 (Mass. 2003) ("General Laws c. 207 contains no requirement that
the applicants for a marriage license attest to their ability or intention to conceive children by
coitus. Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have

never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married."); Baker v. State,
744 A.2d 864, 881 (Vt. 1999) ("It is equally undisputed that many opposite-sex couples marry

for reasons unrelated to procreation, that some of these couples never intended to have children,
and that others are incapable of having children. Therefore, if the purpose of the statutory

204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 45 of 61

exclusion of same-sex couples is to 'further the link between procreation and child rearing,' it is
significantly underinclusive.").
But even assuming, arguendo, that heterosexual marriage was "naturally procreative,"
Texas' logic rests on the notion that permitting same-sex marriage will somehow undermine

procreation among heterosexuals. Case law, statistics, and common sense tell us this fear is
unfounded. "Permitting same-sex couples to marry will not affect the number of opposite-sex

couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage or otherwise affect the
stability of opposite-sex marriages." Perry, 704 F. Supp. at 972. Same sex marriage does not

make it more or less likely that heterosexuals will marry and engage in activities that can lead to
procreation. See, e.g., id. at 999; Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 962 (stating that there was no
evidence "that forbidding marriage to people of the same sex will increase the number of couples
choosing to enter into opposite-sex marriages in order to have and raise children"). As the Ninth

Circuit aptly put it: "It is implausible to think that denying two men or two women the right to
call themselves married could somehow bolster the stability of families headed by one man and

one woman." Perry

v.

Brown, 671 F.3d 1052, 1089 (9th Cir 2012), rev'don other grounds, 133

S. Ct. 2652 (2013) (finding that appellees lacked standing to appeal district

court's decision).

Statistical evidence supports the case law: same-sex marriage has no effect on

heterosexual marriage or divorce rates. Ex. 7, Deci. of Lee Badgett in Supp. of Pls' Mot. for
Prelim. Inj. ("Badgett DecI.") ¶J 69-77. "[T]here is no evidence to conclude that heterosexual

marriage would be discouraged or made unstable if same-sex couples were allowed to marry."
Id. ¶ 69. Data from the Netherlands, the first country to allow same-sex marriage, and states that

have legalized same-sex marriage "show[] that patterns of marriage, divorce, and other indicators
are not affected when same-sex couples can marry." Id. "An analysis of demographic trends,

34
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 46 of 61

population-based surveys, and qualitative interviews in the Netherlands shows no evidence that
granting the right to marry to same-sex couples will have any effect on heterosexual couples'

willingness to marry, their probability of divorce, or the non-marital birth rate." Id. ¶ 70.
Similarly, "scholars compar[ing the experience of Massachusetts and other states that allow

same-sex couples to marry to the experiences of states that do not allow same-sex couples to
marry ... find no evidence of any negative effect on measures of heterosexual behavior related to

same-sex couples marrying." Id. ¶ 69.
The evidence showing that same-sex marriage has no impact on opposite-sex marriage is

unsurprising.
The results of more than a century of anthropological research on
households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and
through time, provide no support for the view that either
civilization or viab'e social orders depend upon marriage as an
exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological
research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types,
including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute
to stable and humane societies.
Ex. 49, Am. Anthropological Ass'n, Statement on Marriage and the Family (Feb. 26, 2004).

Thus, the argument that allowing same-sex couples to marry will undermine procreation in
others is the type of unsupported "overbroad generalization" that cannot be a basis for upholding

discriminatory legislation. Plyler, 457 U.S. at 217-18.
In fact, rather than serving the interest of encouraging stable environments for

procreation, Section 32 hinders the creation of such environments. As Plaintiffs De Leon and
Dimetman can attest, same-sex couples have children. See Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694
(recognizing that laws prohibiting same-sex marriage "humiliate[] tens of thousands of children
now being raised by same-sex couples"). Just like opposite-sex couples and individuals, samesex couples can have children through assisted reproductive techniques and through adoption.

35
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 47 of 61

See Gôlinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 992 ("[S]ame sex parents can and do have and adopt children.");

Baker, 744 A.2d at 882 ("[T]he reality today is that increasing numbers of same-sex couples are
employing increasingly efficient assisted-reproductive techniques to conceive and raise

children."). Texas does not prohibit same-sex couples from adopting or using assisted
reproductive techniques. Defendants can offer no justification why Texas permits same-sex

couples to procreate and adopt children outside of wedlock, while simultaneously claiming that
allowing them to marry undermines procreation. In so doing, Section 32 affirmatively destabilizes the environment for same-sex parents to procreate. Thus, Section 32 actually defeats

the very purpose it was supposedly designed to protect.
2.

Rather Than Encouraging Stable Environments for Child-Rearing, The
Same-Sex Marriage Ban Destabilizes The Environment For All Children
of Same-Sex Couples.

The second basis asserted in the prior

casethat the same-sex marriage ban encourages

stable environments for child-rearingis another overbroad generalization devoid of factual

support and common sense. As just discussed, same-sex couples in Texas can conceive and
adopt children. It follows that they, therefore, raise children, just as De Leon and Dimetman are

raising their child, C.
Far from encouraging a stable environment for child rearing, Section 32 denies children

of same-sex parents the protections and stability they would enjoy if their parents could marry.
Ex. 50, Ellen C. Perrin, Benjamin S. Siegel, and the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of

Child and Family Health, Promoting the Well-Being of Children Whose Parents Are Gay or

Lesbian, 131 Pediatrics 1374, 1377 (Apr.2013) ("Children who are raised by married parents
benefit from the social and legal status that civil marriage conveys to their parents."). It
precludes children of same-sex couples from enjoying the legal protections and emotional
benefits associated with having legally married parents. See supra, Factual Background
36
204156357 vS

§

IV;

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 48 of 61

Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694. Among other things, without undergoing formal adoption, children

of same-sex couples have no legal right to inherit from the non-biological parent and may be
denied rights such as hospital visitation if that parent becomes ill. The non-biological parent
may be denied similar visitation rights or the ability to make decisions about the child without
the biological parent in connection with legal, medical, or educational matters. Thus, for samesex families, Section 32 does not encourage stable environments for child rearing. See Perry,
704 F. Supp. 2d at 1000 (denying same-sex parents the right to marry denies them the benefits,

including stability, attendant to marriage). It does the very opposite; it ensures that children of
same-sex parents will never enjoy the benefits that would result from their parents' marriages.
Golinski, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 992 ("The denial of recognition and withholding of marital benefits
to same-sex couples does nothing to support opposite-sex parenting, but rather merely serves to

endanger children of same-sex parents."); Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 336-37 (finding that the
denial of marriage to same-sex parents "in fact leads to a significant unintended and untoward

consequence by limiting the resources, protections and benefits available to children of same-sex
parents"); Ex. 51, Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, Position Statement on Support of Legal Recognition of
Same-Sex Civil Marriage (July 2005) ("The children of unmarried gay and lesbian parents do not

have the same protection that civil marriage affords the children of heterosexual couples.").

Moreover, more than 25 years of research indicates that children and adolescents of
same-sex parents "are as successful psychologically, emotionally, and socially as children and

adolescents raised by heterosexual parents, including biological parents." Ex. 8, Decl. of
Michael E. Lamb in Supp. of Pls' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. ("Lamb Decl.") ¶ 13; see also Ex. 50,
Perrin, supra at 1377 ("A large body of scientific literature demonstrates that children and

adolescents who grow up with gay and/or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional cognitive,

204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 49 of 61

social, and sexual functioning as do children whose parents are heterosexual."). "[T]he concerns

often raised about children of lesbian and gay parentsconcerns that are generally grounded in

prejudice against and stereotypes about gay peopleare unfounded." Ex. 28, Am. Psychological

Ass'n, Answers to Your Questions For A Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation &
Homosexuality, at 5. While factors such as poverty, parental depression, parental substance

abuse, divorce, and domestic violence confer risk to a child's healthy development, "the sexual

orientation of their parents is not among them." Ex. 50, Perrin, supra at 1377.
"The parents' sex or sexual orientation does not affect the capacity to be good parents or

their children's healthy development." Lamb Decl. ¶ 14. Children do not need a male and
female

parentthey need parents.

Id. ¶ 14, 28, 31 ("The social science literature

overwhelmingly rejects the notion that there is an optimal gender mix of parents or that children
and adolescents with same-sex parents suffer any developmental disadvantages compared with

those with two different-sex parents."). A child's adjustment depends upon qualities such as "the

parents' affection, consistence, reliability, responsiveness, and emotional commitment, as well as
on the quality and character of the relationships between the parents and their intimates, and on

the availability of sufficient economic and social resources." Id. ¶ 21.

Leading medical, psychological, and social-welfare organizations oppose same-sex
parenting restrictions because of the abundant scientific evidence showing that children raised by
gay and lesbian parents are as likely to be well adjusted as children raised by heterosexual

parents. See Ex. 52, Am. Acad. of Pediatrics, Coparent or Second-Parent Adoption by Same-Sex

Parents, Feb. 2002; Ex. 53, Am. Psychological Ass'n, Sexual Orientation, Parents, & Children
(July 2004); Ex. 54, Am. Acad. of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, or

Transgender Parents Policy Statement (2009); Ex. 55, Child Welfare League of Am., Position

Statement on Parenting of Children by Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults.
Thus, the evidence shows that same-sex couples can and do have children and that those

children are as well-adjusted as children of heterosexual couples. Yet Section 32 hinders the

stability of same-sex parents and their children. See Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 963 ("[T]he task

of child rearing for same-sex couples

is made infinitely harder by their status as outliers to the

marriage laws."); Lamb Decl. ¶ 47 ("Many lesbians and gay men already are parents, and it is in
the best interests of their children for these families to have equal access to the protections,

benefits, social legitimacy and support afforded through marriage."). Recognizing this, the
American Academy of Pediatrics "concludes that it is in the best interest of children that they be
able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing and care that comes with the civil marriage

of their parents, without regard to their parents' gender or sexual orientation." Ex. 50, Perrin,

supraat 1381.
As the Supreme Court so aptly explained in Windsor, the same-sex marriage ban

"humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same sex couples. The law in
question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of
their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives."
Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694. Section 32 does nothing to encourage stable environments for child

rearing. As a result, "encouraging stable environments for child-rearing" cannot provide a
rational basis for Section 32. See Varnum

v.

Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 899 (Ia. 2009) ("Plaintiffs

presented an abundance of evidence and research, confirmed by our independent research,
supporting the proposition that the interests of children are served equally by same-sex parents
and opposite-sex parents.").

3.

Section 32 ImiDermissibly Targets Homosexuals.

Because every asserted basis for Section 32 fails to pass muster under even the most
forgiving standard, this Court must conclude that Section 32 was designed to disadvantage samesex couplesa clear violation of the Constitution. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 ("The

Constitution's guarantee of equality 'must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire
to harm a politically unpopular group cannot' justify disparate treatment.") (quoting Dep 't of
Agri.

v.

Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534-35 (1973)); Romer, 517 U.S. at 635 ("We must conclude that

Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them
unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do.").

The legislative history of Texas' statutory and constitutional provisions banning same-sex

marriage illustrates the animus against gay men and lesbians and the motivation behind the bans.

Although it did not rely on these grounds in its recent defense of Section 32, the arguments in
favor of Family Code

§

6.204 claimed that marriage between a man and a woman gives "women

and children the surest protection against poverty and abuse, provides for the healthy
psychological development of children, and avoids health risks of same-sex relations and
promiscuity." House Research Org., Report on Major Issues, 78th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 2003).
Texas was not content merely to deprive same-sex couples of the title "married," but even went
so far as to enact a provision ensuring that same-sex couples could never obtain any rights even

similar to marital rights. Tex. Const., art. I,

§

32(b).

In the House of Representatives, it was claimed that same-sex marriage "could lead to the

recognition of bigamy, voluntary incest, pedophilia, and group marriage." House Research Org.,
Daily Floor Report, 78th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. April 29, 2003). The necessary implication of

these statements, of course, is that gay men and lesbians are more likely than heterosexuals to be

poor and abusive, injurious to children's psychological development, and engage in risky
40
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 52 of 61

"promiscuous" acts; and that they are akin to bigamists, the incestuous, pedophiles, and
polygamists. These shameful slurs disclose the unfounded fear and irrational beliefs that

motivated Section 32 and show that it impermissibly targets gay men and lesbians.
Section 32 does not have a rational basis and it impermissibly targets a minority. Thus it

cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.

The Refusal To Recognize Same-Sex Marriages Lawfully Performed In
Other States Deprives Plaintiffs De Leon and Dimetman Equal Protection
And Due Process.

Under Texas law, marriages are presumptively valid in Texas and will be upheld against
claims of invalidity "unless a strong reason exists for holding the marriage void or voidable."
Tex. Fam. Code Ann.

§

1.101. Consistent with that presumption, "[t]he general rule is that a

marriage valid where contracted is valid everywhere, and that one void where contracted is void

everywhere," Porlwoodv. Portwood, 109 S.W.2d 515, 522 (Tex. Civ. App. 1937), and "[t]he
validity of a marriage is generally determined by the law of the place where it is celebrated,"

Husbandv. Pierce, 800 S.W.2d 661, 663 (1990). See also

Tex.

Emp'r Ins. Ass'n v, Borum, 834

S.W.2d 395, 399 (Tex. App. 1992) ("[T]he validity of a marriage is generally determined by the

law of the place where it is celebrated rather than the law of the place where suit is filed.");

Braddock v. Taylor, 592 S.W.2d 40, 42 (Tex. Civ. App. 1979) ("The validity of a marriage is
determined by the law of the place where it was celebrated."). Thus, even if Texas itself would
not allow a particular marriage to occur within its borders, that marriage generally must be

recognized in Texas if lawfully performed in another state or country. E.g., Husband, 800
S.W.2d at 662-63 (although no county clerk in Texas could have lawfully issued a marriage

license to Texas girl without her parents' consent or a court order, marriage performed in Mexico
was legal and would be recognized under Texas law);

cf

Braddock, 592 S.W.2d at 42 (refusing

marriages); Nevarez v. Bailon, 287 S.W.2d 521, 523 (Tex. Civ. App. 1956) (same because

Thus, because Texas will recognize heterosexual marriages from other

6.204;

Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 422 (1979) (Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require

one state to apply another state's law in violation of its own legitimate public policy). But
where, as here, that public policy is nothing more than a discriminatory animus that targets an

unpopular minority, the law cannot stand: a legislative "desire to harm a politically unpopular
group cannot' justify disparate treatment of that group." Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 (quoting
Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534-535). "The guaranty of 'equal protection of the laws' is a pledge of the

v.

Oklahoma ex rel.

Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942)).

Defendants may argue that the traditional rule that the place of celebration does not
govern, and courts should instead apply the significant contacts test under a choice of law
analysis to marriage cases. In re Marriage ofJB. andH.B., 326 S.W.3d 654, 668-69 (Tex. App.
2010), rev, granted. Aug. 23, 2013; Seth v. Seth, 694 S.W.2d 459, 462-64 (Tex. App. 1985).
However, that test makes no cognizabie difference, because even under traditional choice of law
analysis, the Texas Supreme Court has stated that Texas courts will enforce a valid contractual
choice of law provision. Duncan v. CessnaAircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d 414, 421 (Tex. 1984)
(stating that significant contacts test would apply "except those contract cases in which the
parties have agreed to a valid choice of law clause"). That would mean that a married couple
could agree contractually to have their marriage governed by the law of another state and Texas
would respect that decision under its choice of law analysis. Thus, the type of choice of law
analysis this Court uses is irrelevant. All that matters is that under either approach to choice of
law, Texas could still recognize a marriage under the law of another state even if that law were
not one that could otherwise be entered into in Texas in the first instance and void for public
policy would be the only grounds for refusing to recognize such marriages.

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 54 of 61

As discussed above (Argument, Section I.B.1.), because Section 32 targets gays and

lesbians, a suspect classification, the refusal to recognize same-sex marriages should be subject
to heightened scrutiny. However, under either heightened scrutiny or rational basis, Defendants

can offer no legitimate justification for Texas' refusal to recognize De Leon and Dimetman's

marriage. Having already married in another state, declaring that marriage void undermines the
alleged goal of fostering stable relationships and promoting families in which children are raised
by both parents. Indeed, despite being married at the time De Leon conceived and gave birth to
C, Dimetman was forced formally to adopt C so that she would be recognized as C's mother. In

other instances, however, where same-sex married couples have had children in states that
recognize their marriagesand thus do not require adoptions to confer parental rightsparents
could find that moving to Texas may strip them of parental rights that they had by virtue of their
marital relationship. Thus, far from serving the purpose of promoting families and stable
relationships, the refusal to recognize existing marriages lawfully performed in other states has
the exact opposite effect.

Nor can Defendants demonstrate how refusing to recognize same-sex marriages
performed in other states promotes procreation. As discussed above, there is no evidence that
same-sex marriage affects opposite-sex marriages or procreation among heterosexuals.
(Argument, Section I.C.) To the contrary, despite their Massachusetts marriage not being

recognized by Texas, De Leon and Dimetman had a child after they were married. So how does
Texas refusing to recognize that marriage promote procreation? Do Defendants believe they and

other married same-sex couples will be so discouraged by the lack of state recognition that they
will divorce their same-sex spouses, find heterosexual spouses, and then have children within
heterosexual marriages? The notion is preposterous.

Ultimately, as an Ohio district court recently found when confronted with this same
question, the only "purpose served by treating same-sex married couples differently than

opposite-sex married couples is the same improper purpose that failed in Windsor and in Romer:

'to impose inequality' and to make gay citizens unequal under the law." Obergefell v. Kasich,
No. 1 :13cv---501, 2013 WL 3814262, *6 (S.D. Ohio July 22, 2013). Because Ohio, like Texas,

recognized other state marriages that might otherwise not be permitted in Ohio, the Obergefell
court held that Ohio's refusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages violated equal

protection and issued an injunction requiring the state to recognize a same-sex marriage lawfully
performed in Maryland.
Obergefell also held that the refusal to recognize the plaintiffs' out-of-state marriage
violated due process, particularly implicating the associational rights discussed in cases like
Griswold, 381 U.S. at 486, and Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 384. Obergefell, 2013 WL 3814262, at *6.

"Even if there were proffered some attendant governmental purpose to discriminate against gay
couples, other than to effect pure animus, it is difficult to imagine how it could outweigh the
severe burden imposed by the ban imposed on same-sex couples legally married in other states."
Id. Even under a rational-basis test, the court could not find any grounds for refusing to

recognize "lawful, out-of-state same sex marriages that is not related to the impermissible
expression of disapproval of same-sex married couples." Id. The same is true here.
Defendants may argue that due process is not implicated by the refusal to recognize outof-state marriages because same-sex couples like De Leon and Dimetman are still able to

exercise their "right to marry." But refusing to recognize lawful out-of-state marriages is

tantamount to refusing to permit people to marry at all. As the Supreme Court has recognized,
marriage conveys a host of rights, responsibilities, and benefits beyond the mere act of engaging

44

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 56 of 61

in the ceremony

of marrying. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694-66 (listing various benefits and

rights). Just as the Supreme Court recognized that DOMA "divests married same-sex couples of
the duties and responsibilities that are an essential part of married life and that they in most cases
would be honored to accept were DOMA not in force," Section 32 prevents Texas same-sex

married couples from taking on those duties and responsibilities. Id. at 2695; see also Turner,
482 U.S. at 94 (finding even considering limitations imposed by prison conditions, "important

attributes of marriage remain" such as being "expressions of emotional support and public
commitment", matters of religious significance, precondition for benefits like Social Security,

property rights, and legitimation of children). By declaring existing, lawful marriages void and
denying married couples the rights, responsibilities, and benefits of marriages, Texas denies
same-sex couples who have been married in other states of due process just as it does to samesex couples that seek to marry within in Texas. That they are able to obtain a marriage certificate
or hold a ceremony in another state does not change that.

Accordingly, the refusal to recognize same-sex marriages lawfully performed in other

states violates the equal protection and due process rights of couples like De Leon and
Dimetman.

E.

Baker v. Nelson Is No Longer Binding Precedent Because Subsequent Cases
Undermined Its Reasoning.

In Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), the Court dismissed "for want of a substantial

federal question" an appeal from a Minnesota Supreme Court decision rejecting due process and
equal protection challenges to Minnesota's refusal to issue a marriage license to a same-sex

couple. See Baker

v.

Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). Supreme Court summary dismissals

are binding only "on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided." Mandel

v.

Bradley,

432 U.S. 173, 176 (1977) (per curiam). Even then, summary dismissals are binding on lower

45
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 57 of 61

courts only to the extent that they have not been undermined by subsequent cases. Hicks v.

Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344 (1975). Baker was decided more than forty years ago, and
subsequent doctrinal and societal developments completely undermine it.

Baker summary dismissal is not binding on the due process question here because it is
impossible to reconcile with the Court's subsequent decisions in Lawrence and Windsor. As the
Court found in Lawrence, the Constitution protects "personal decisions relating to marriage,
procreation, contraception, family relationships, [and] child rearing" and gays and lesbians "may
seek autonomy for these purposes." Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 574. More recently, Windsor

recognized that citizens' decisions to marry someone of the same-sex are protected by the
Constitution. Windsor, 133 5. Ct. at 2694.
Similarly, Baker 's equal protection ruling also has no precedential value. First, in Baker
the plaintiffs made an equal protection challenge based solely on sex discriminationnot on

discrimination based upon sexual orientation. Baker, 291 Minn. at 315; Jurisdictional Statement
at 16, Baker v. Nelson, No. 71-1027 ("The discrimination in this case is one of gender."). Baker

was decided before the Supreme Court recognized that sex is a quasi-suspect classification.

Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 688. Baker also was decided before the Court recognized that the
Constitution, including the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, protect gay men and
lesbians. Windsor, 133 5. Ct. at 2694; Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 574; Romer, 517 U.S. at 635-36.

Lastly, Baker was factually distinguishable, as it did not involve a state statute or constitutional

amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage, and it did not involve a same-sex couple married in
another state. See Baker, 191 N.W.2d at 185; see Ill. State Bd. of Elec.

v.

Socialist Workers, 440

U.S. 173, 182 (1979) (finding summary affirmance was not binding on "[q]uestions which

46
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 58 of 61

merely lurk in the record, are not resolved, and no resolution of them may be inferred") (internal

citations and quotations omitted).
Because Baker is premised on the subsequently rejected notion that the Constitution does
not protect gay men and lesbians from discrimination, Baker is not controlling of the issues here.

II.

The Court Should Issue A Preliminary Injunction Against Defendants' Enforcement
Of Section 32.
Courts consider four factors to determine if a preliminary injunction is proper: 1) the

plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits; 2) the threat of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs; 3)
whether the plaintiffs' potential injury outweighs any potential harm the defendant may suffer;
and 4) whether the preliminary injunction disserves the public interest. DeerfIeld Med. Ctr

v.

City of Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 332 (5th Cir. 1981).

Plaintiffs satisfy each of these requirements. Plaintiffs have shown that Section 32 and its
related statutes violate their Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights.
Thus, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. Because Section 32 violates their

constitutional rights and Defendants can point to no harm that they will suffer if they are required
to recognize and allow Plaintiffs' marriages, the equities greatly favor an injunction. See

Giovani Carandola, Ltd.

v.

Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. 2002) ("[A] state is in no way

harmed by issuance of a preliminary injunction which prevents the state from enforcing
restrictions likely to be found unconstitutional. If anything, the system is improved by such an
injunction."). Similarly, a preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest.

Ingebretsen v. Jackson Pub. Sch. Dist., 88 F.3d 274, 280 (5th Cir. 1996) ("The School Prayer
Statute is unconstitutional so the public interest was not disserved by an injunction preventing its

implementation."). To the contrary, protecting Plaintiffs' constitutional rights serves the public
interest. See Giovani Carandola, 303 F.3d at 521 ("[W]e agree with the district court that

47
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 59 of 61

upholding constitutional rights surely serves the public interest."); Jornaleros de Las Palmas v.
City of League City, Civil Action No. H-11-2703, 2013 WL2180013, at *15 (S.D. Tex. May 17,

2013).
Finally, Plaintiffs suffer irreparable harm, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm

because of Defendants' refusal to recognize and allow their marriages. An injury is irreparable if

money damages cannot compensate for the harm. Deerjleld Med. Ctr., 661 F.2d at 332. While
Plaintiffs undoubtedly suffer financial harm from their inability to marry, see Badgett Decl. ¶J
3 2-68

(listing economic harms that Section 32 causes same-sex couples), no amount of money

can compensate them for the denial of their constitutional rights. The fact that Section 32 denies
Plaintiffs their constitutional right to marry is per se irreparable harm. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.
347, 373 (1976) ("The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,

unquestionably constitutes irreparable harm."); Deerfield, 661 F.2d at 338 ("We have already
determined that the constitutional right of privacy is 'either threatened or in fact being impaired,'
and this conclusion mandates a finding of irreparable harm.") (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373).
Thus, Section 32 irreparable harms Plaintiffs, and this factor weighs in favor of a preliminary

injunction.
A preliminary injunction is necessary because there is nothing this Court can do at a later

date to erase the harms that Plaintiffs suffered today and will suffer every day forward until they
obtain justice. Plaintiffs will continue to suffer state-sanctioned discrimination and the stigma

that accompanies it until they too can enjoy the same rights that every heterosexual enjoys. See
Ex. 58, Decl. of Ilan S. Meyer in Supp. of Pls' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. ("Meyer Decl.") ¶ 81 (Texas'

same-sex marriage ban perpetuates the beliefs "that [lesbians and gay men] are uninterested in,

48
204156357 v8

Case 5:13-cv-00982-OLG Document 28 Filed 11/27/13 Page 60 of 61

unable to maintain, and, indeed, undeserving of close intimate relationships that are equal to

those of heterosexual couples"). Plaintiffs' injury demands immediate relief.
Section 32 violates the United States Constitution, it irreparably harms Plaintiffs, and

each factor necessary for a preliminary injunction weighs in favor of Plaintiffs. Thus, the Court
should issue a preliminary injunction against Defendants' enforcement of Section 32.
Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue an order

preliminarily enjoining Defendants from enforcing any constitutional or statutory provisions,
including article I, section 32 of the Texas Constitution and Texas Family Code § 2.001 and
6.204, that prevent Plaintiffs Phariss and Holmes from marrying on the basis that they are of the

same sex, or prevents the State from recognizing Plaintiffs' De Leon and Dimetman's marriage
on the basis that they are of the same sex. Plaintiffs further request that the Court enter a

preliminary injunction commanding Defendant Rickhoff to issue a marriage license to Plaintiffs
Phariss and Holmes.
