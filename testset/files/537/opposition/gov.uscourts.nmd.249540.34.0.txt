PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT GARY KING’S MOTION TO DISMISS
The Plaintiffs, JOHN W. JACKSON and SECOND AMENDMENT FOUNDATION,
INC., by and through undersigned counsel, and for their Response to Defendant GARY KING’s
Motion to Dismiss, asserts as follows:
The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer1, attorney and prosecutor2 in
the State. NMSA § 8-5-2.B requires the Attorney General to “ . . . prosecute and defend in any
other court or tribunal all actions and proceedings, civil or criminal, in which the state may be a
party or interested when, in his judgment, the interest of the state requires such action or when

1

Evidenced by NMSA § 29-7-3, which names KING as the chairman of the board of the New
Mexico law enforcement academy, which develops programs for law enforcement training and
qualifications for police trainers. NMSA § 29-7-4.B, C. The Board also may “issue, grant, deny,
renew, suspend or revoke a: (1) peace officer's certification for any cause set forth in the
provisions of the Law Enforcement Training Act. NMSA § 29-7-4.G.
2

NMSA § 29-1-1- states that “It is hereby declared to be the duty of every sheriff, deputy sheriff,
constable and every other peace officer . . . to cooperate with and assist the attorney general,
district attorney or other prosecutor, if any, in all reasonable ways.”

requested to do so by the governor.” Defendant King does not assert the State is not interested in
this litigation; in fact, the Defendants’ defense makes quite clear the State is claiming such an
interest. Presumably, this interest in enforcing NMSA § 29-19-4(A)(1), and its ultimate interest
in prosecuting violators, would be manifested through the Office’s Special Investigations Unit of
its Investigations Division, or its Prosecutions Division.
This comports with Defendant KING’s website, where the Office states its Litigation
Division, in relevant part: “ . . . prosecutes civil matters on behalf of state entities, and defends
state entities in civil matters in the U.S. District Courts and the State Courts.”
http://www.nmag.gov/the_office/litigation.
KING admitted this in his Answer to the Plaintiffs’ Complaint. Paragraph 13 of the
Complaint alleges as follows:
“13.

Defendant KING is the Attorney General of the State of New Mexico, and, in his

official capacity as such, is responsible for executing and administering the state of New
Mexico’s laws, customs, practices, and policies, including NMSA 1978, §29-19-4(A)(1). In that
capacity, KING is presently enforcing the laws, customs, practices and policies complained of in
this action, and is sued in his official capacity.”
KING’s Answer states:
“13.

Defendants admit the factual allegations contained in Paragraph 13.”

(See par. 13 of Plaintiffs’ Complaint (Docket #1); See also par. 13 of Defendants’ Answer
(Docket #10)).
KING also has, to date, vigorously participated in the case by responding to Plaintiffs’
pending Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. He further has made his interest in one of the main
issues of this case clear when he joined in the amicus brief in support of Plaintiff SAF in the

2

Filed 02/08/13 Page 3 of 4

pending Fourth Circuit case of Woollard v. Sheridan, 12-1437 (filed August 6, 2012). A copy of
this amicus brief was submitted to the Court in support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary
Injunction. It is disingenuous for KING at this point to say he should not be in the case and this
does not involve him.
Therefore, as the State’s chief law enforcement officer and prosecutor, KING is properly
a part of this case. However, should the Defendants stipulate (and the Court so find) that the
Plaintiffs may obtain full relief in this matter by proceeding solely against Defendant
HUBBARD, Plaintiffs will abide by that stipulation and finding.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs, JOHN W. JACKSON and SECOND AMENDMENT
FOUNDATION, INC., respectfully request this honorable Court to deny Defendant KING’s
Motion in its entirety.
