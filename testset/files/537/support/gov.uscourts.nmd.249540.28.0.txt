In their complaint Plaintiffs allege New Mexico Statutes 1978 section 29-19-4 violates
the 2nd and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. They also allege that the statute
is preempted by federal law. Plaintiffs claim that the Attorney General is responsible for
and currently is executing and administering the laws of the state of New Mexico,
including the law at issue. Plaintiffs mistake the role of the Attorney General. There is
no relief available to Plaintiffs from the Attorney General. As such they have failed to
state a claim as to the Attorney General upon which relief can be granted and have also
failed to meet the minimum requirements of standing.
ARGUMENT
Generally, a motion to dismiss on the grounds that a petition does not state a
claim on which relief can be granted admits all facts well pleaded, and the legal question
presented thereby is governed by the facts as pleaded. Galbreath v. Metropolitan Trust
Co., 134 F.2d 569, 570 (10th Cir. Colo. 1943) (citing Eberle v. Sinclair Prairie Oil
Company, D.C., 35 F.Supp. 296, Leimer v. State Mutual Life Assurance Company, 8
Cir., 108 F.2d 302, 305; Gallup v. Caldwell, 3 Cir., 120 F.2d 90;Cohen v. United States, 8
Cir., 129 F.2d 733; Continental Collieries, Inc., v. Shober, 3 Cir., 130 F.2d 631; Polk
Company v. Glover, 305 U.S. 5, 9, 59 S.Ct. 15, 83 L.Ed. 6.) Additionally, in order to
have standing to sue, Plaintiffs must allege an injury in fact, that the injury is traceable to
complained of conduct of the defendant, and that the requested relief will redress the
alleged injury. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 102, 118 S. Ct. 1003,
1016 (U.S. 1998) (Internal citations omitted).

Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently plead the traceability element of standing. Plaintiffs
assert broadly that as the Attorney General Defendant King is “responsible for executing
and administering the State of New Mexico’s laws, customs, practices, and policies,
including NMSA 1978 § 29-19-4(A)”2. (Complaint at para. 13). However, reviewing the
entirety of the Concealed Handgun Carry Act (NMSA 1978 §§29-19-1 through 29-19-14)
reveals no indication that the Attorney General has the responsibility to execute and
administer it, as Plaintiffs assert. There is no statutory provision supporting Plaintiffs’
assertion either. For example, nowhere in NMSA 1978, §8-5-1 (2010) et seq., the
provisions describing the Attorney General’s powers and duties, gives the Attorney
General authority over or responsibility for the Department of Public Safety or the
Special Investigations Division thereof. Nor does anything in the New Mexico
Constitution give the Attorney General the broad responsibilities which Plaintiffs
attribute to him. Plaintiffs have failed to allege action by or on behalf of the Attorney
General which is traceable to the alleged injury. As Attorney General, Defendant King
has no hand in the issuance or denial of concealed weapons permits.
Plaintiffs’ complaint against Defendant King also fails as a matter of law for the
independent reason that there is no relief available to Plaintiffs from Defendant King.
Because the Attorney General is in no way responsible for administering New Mexico’s
concealed carry scheme, the Attorney General cannot redress the alleged injuries suffered
by Plaintiffs. Without available relief from the Attorney General, not only do Plaintiffs
lack standing as to the Attorney General, they also fail to state a claim upon which relief
2

This is not an allegation of fact, but of law. The Court thus need not treat it as “true” for the purposes of
this matter.

can be granted. Taking, as the Court must for the purposes of this motion, all the
allegations in the Complaint as true, Plaintiffs still fail to state a claim upon which
Defendant Gary King can grant relief.
The Attorney General neither approves nor denies applications for the concealed
carry of a firearm. The Attorney General does not direct the Special Investigations
Division of the Department of Public Safety. The Attorney General has no input into the
issuance of concealed carry permits. An injunction against the Attorney General would
have no effect on securing Plaintiffs’ alleged rights. A declaratory judgment to the effect
that NMSA 1978 §29-19-4(A)(1) is unconstitutional would not alter, in any way, the role
of the Attorney General. There is no action of the Attorney General to be compelled or
halted. The Attorney General cannot grant the remedy sought—the ability of permanent
resident aliens to carry a concealed firearm.
WHEREFORE, Defendant Gary King, Attorney General, respectfully requests
this Court dismiss the Complaint with prejudice as to the Attorney General for lack of
standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
