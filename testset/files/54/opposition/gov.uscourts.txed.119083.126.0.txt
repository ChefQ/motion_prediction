No. 6:09-cv-448-LED

PLAINTIFF U.S. ETHERNET INNOVATIONS, LLC’S RESPONSE
IN OPPOSITION TO INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE
Plaintiff U.S. Ethernet Innovations, LLC (“USEI”) hereby makes and files this Response
in Opposition to Intel Corporation’s Motion to Intervene, respectfully showing the Court as
follows:
Intel Corporation (“Intel”) argues that it is entitled to intervene and file its Complaint in
intervention because it has agreed to “partially indemnify” some of the Defendants in this action
as to certain claims of the Patents-in-Suit.
Intel’s indemnification argument is premature at best. It is unclear whether any of the
claims upon which Intel has indemnified these defendants are also at issue in the case. In its
papers, Intel states that it has agreed to defend and indemnify the aforementioned [Defendants]

as to many of the claims of the Patents-in-Suit.” [Declaration of Mike Labbee at ¶ 3 (attached to
Intel’s Motion to Intervene).] USEI has asked Intel to identify the specific claims for which its
customers have requested indemnity, yet Intel has refused to disclose this information at this
time. [Declaration of Ryan Walsh at ¶¶ 4, 5 (attached as Exhibit A).] Without the benefit of this
information, it is not possible to determine whether any of the indemnified claims will even be at
issue in this litigation. Intel’s motion to intervene is therefore premature, at best, with respect to
Intel’s indemnification argument.
Intel similarly argues that it is entitled to intervene in this case because one accused
product sold by Defendant Dell was supplied by Intel. However, a review of Intel’s Complaint
in intervention demonstrates that Intel is improperly seeking to use this single product out of the
hundreds that are at issue as a way to seek broad sweeping relief to which it has made no
showing of entitlement as set forth above. Indeed, Intel’s Complaint in Intervention is not
limited to the single Dell product named in the Complaint, nor is it limited to those unnamed
claims for which Intel has indemnified some defendants. Under the circumstances, Intel has
failed to demonstrate that it has the substantial legal interest necessary for the broad relief sought
in its proposed Complaint in Intervention. Nisus Corp. v. Perma-Chink Systems, Inc., 497 F.3d
1316 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding district court did not err in denying motion to intervene where
third party lacked “a substantial legal interest in the underlying litigation”).
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff USEI respectfully requests that the Court deny Intel’s
motion to intervene. In the alternative, Plaintiff USEI respectfully requests that the Court defer a
ruling on the motion until such time as Intel can demonstrate that its indemnification obligations
are related to the patent claims at issue in this litigation.
