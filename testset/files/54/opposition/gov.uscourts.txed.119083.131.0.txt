Defendants.

REPLY IN SUPPORT OF INTEL’S MOTION TO INTERVENE
Plaintiff U.S. Ethernet’s brief opposition to Intel’s motion to intervene does not discuss
the tests for intervention under either Rule 24(a)(2) (intervention as a matter of right) or Rule
24(b)(1)(B) (permissive intervention). It also fails to deal with the compelling facts and
circumstances justifying Intel’s intervention.
I.

INTERVENTION AS OF RIGHT
As set forth in Intel’s moving papers, four criteria are to be considered under Rule

24(a)(2): (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the potential intervener’s interest in the property or
transaction that is the subject of the underlying lawsuit; (3) any impairment to the intervener’s
ability to protect its interest absent intervention; and (4) the adequacy of the representation of the

potential intervener’s interest by the existing parties. Ross v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 745, 753 (5th
Cir. 2005).
At best, U.S. Ethernet’s opposition is directed at factor (2); it completely fails to respond
to Intel’s points as to the other factors. As to factor (1), there can be no question that Intel’s
motion is timely. As to factor (3), Intel pointed out that as product manufacture it has strong
interests in validity, infringement and claim construction. Honeywell Int’l., 2005 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 22933, at *12-13. U.S. Ethernet does not respond. As to factor (4), Intel pointed out that
manufacturers have been held not adequately represented by their customers. Id. at *13.
Moreover, cases hold that it is also desirable to add manufacturers to cases since they have more
knowledge about their products than their customers. Id. at *4. Again, U.S. Ethernet does not
respond.
Presumably addressing factor (2), U.S. Ethernet merely argues that it is unknown which
claims it will assert and which claims Intel has agreed to indemnify and that Intel’s accused
product is just one of “hundreds” in the case. None of these contentions bear scrutiny.
First, it is clear from U.S. Ethernet’s complaint that it accuses Intel of infringement in
this case since it expressly names the Intel Pro/100 product. [Complaint (Dkt. 1), ¶ 25.] Thus, it
does not matter precisely which claims are at issue.
Second, as Intel informed U.S. Ethernet when meeting and conferring on Intel's motion,
although Intel's agreement to indemnify its customers is limited to certain claims of the patents in
suit, Intel has agreed to defend its customers on all claims to the extent they relate to products
containing Intel chipsets. Therefore, to the extent U.S. Ethernet asserts any claims against
products in which Intel chipsets provide ethernet functionality, Intel has agreed to defend its
customers on those claims.

Third, it is clear that Intel’s indemnity obligations relate to this case since its customers
sought, and obtained, indemnity in response to U.S. Ethernet’s complaint in this case.
Fourth, U.S. Ethernet should not be heard to complain that specific claims have not been
identified since only U.S. Ethernet knows what claims it will assert in this matter, and it has not
yet identified those claims. Because Intel need not indemnify its customers on claims that are
not asserted or for products that do not include Intel components, it does not make sense to
require Intel to identify indemnified claims in advance of discovery and before U.S. Ethernet
identifies asserted claims.
Fifth, to the extent that U.S. Ethernet is arguing that intervention should not be permitted
until it serves its Preliminary Infringement Contentions (identifying claims and products), it cites
no authority for this proposition, and such a rule would be contrary to efficient administration of
the case. Early intervention should be encouraged, not prohibited. The scope of Intel’s
indemnity will be determined by U.S. Ethernet’s Preliminary Infringement Contentions, but it is
clear that Intel will be involved and should be added as a party.
Sixth, in focusing on which claims Intel has agreed to indemnify, U.S. Ethernet neglects
the fact that Intel has an independent interest in this case as a manufacturer, apart from its
interest as indemnitor. Numerous cases hold that manufacturers have a strong interest in
intervening in suits against their customers. See cases cited at pp. 6-7 of Intel’s opening brief.1
U.S. Ethernet cites nothing to the contrary. Its Nisus case is not on point, as it merely holds that
a patent attorney lacked standing to intervene in patent litigation where a patent he prosecuted
was found unenforceable for inequitable conduct but where no sanctions had been levied against

the attorney. Nisus Corp. v. Perma-Chink Systems, Inc., 497 F.3d 1316, 1320-21 (Fed. Cir.
2007). This case has no bearing on the manufacturer issue discussed in so many other cases.
Seventh, U.S. Ethernet gives no reason to believe that even a “single” Intel product is
insignificant, particularly given the volume of Intel’s business and the high percentage of that
business derived from the other defendants in this case. Moreover, U.S. Ethernet is incorrect in
suggesting that its complaint identifies “hundreds” of products. In fact, it identifies only a
handful of specific products. Further, it is likely that several of those products use Intel chipsets
for ethernet functionality.
Finally, it is clear that Intel would have standing to file a declaratory judgment action,
since U.S. Ethernet has specifically accused Intel of infringement, and this goes well beyond
what is required under current declaratory judgment law. MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,
549 U.S. 118 , 127 S.Ct. 764 (2007); Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. v. O2 Micro Intern. Ltd.,
2007 WL 2318924, *3 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (finding DJ jurisdiction where products were not
accused but where patentee showed a willingness to pursue litigation). It would make little sense
for the Court or the parties to require Intel to file a separate action and then separately address
whether the cases should be consolidated.
II.

PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION
Permissive intervention is allowed when three criteria are met: (1) the motion is

sufficiently timely; (2) there is a common question of law or fact between the intervener’s claim
or defense and the main action; and (3) intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the
adjudication of rights of the original parties. Am. Tobacco, 1999 WL 1022129, at * 1.
U.S. Ethernet does not discuss this test at all, or the enumerated factors. Again, there can
be no question that Intel’s motion is timely. There can also be no question that there is a
common question of law or fact, even if there is only one Intel product at issue. And U.S.

Ethernet cites no reason to think that Intel’s intervention will cause delay or prejudice. If
anything, greater involvement of Intel in discovery will speed the case up.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Intel’s motion to intervene should be granted.
