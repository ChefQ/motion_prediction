No. 6:09-cv-448-LED

PLAINTIFF U.S. ETHERNET INNOVATIONS, LLC’S RESPONSE TO INTEL
CORPORATION’S SECOND NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY IN
SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO INTERVENE
In support of its Motion to Intervene, non-party Intel Corporation (“Intel”) has now filed
a brief, a reply brief, a notice of supplemental authority, and a second notice of supplemental
authority. Notwithstanding these serial filings, Intel has yet to produce a single Indemnification
Agreement, despite its prior agreement to provide them to Plaintiff U.S. Ethernet Innovations,
LLC (“USEI”) several weeks ago. In addition, while NVIDIA Corporation has stated that its
proposed intervention will not impact the current deadlines in the Docket Control Order, Intel
has made no such statements in any of its many filings. The absence of such a statement is

telling and raises concerns that Intel may be seeking to delay this action through its intervention.
For these reasons and those set forth in USEI’s prior filings, USEI respectfully requests that the
Court deny Intel’s motion to intervene, or, in the alternative, defer a decision on the motion until
such time as Intel has established standing to intervene in this action.
Respectfully submitted, this 8th day of April, 2010.
