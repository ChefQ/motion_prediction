INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, Intel Corporation (“Intel”) hereby moves
to intervene in this action as of right, or alternatively, with permission of the Court. Intel seeks
to intervene in this patent infringement action filed by U.S. Ethernet Innovations, LLC (“U.S.
Ethernet”) to protect both its interests and the interests of many of its customers who have been
named as defendants in this action.1 Intel is seeking to intervene because a number of the patent
infringement claims at issue relate to networking technology that Intel supplies to those

Intel’s customers include all of the Defendants, namely Acer, Inc., Acer America
Corporation, Apple, Inc., ASUS Computer International, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Dell Inc.,
Fujitsu Ltd., Fujitsu America, Inc., Gateway, Inc., Hewlett Packard Co., HP Development
Company LLC, Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation of America, Sony Electronics Inc., Toshiba
Corporation, Toshiba America, Inc., and Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc.
(collectively, the “Intel Customers”).

defendants. Indeed, the complaint in this action explicitly accuses Intel® Pro/100 network
adapters sold by Dell of infringement.
U.S. Ethernet’s assertion that computer systems in which Intel products provide
networking functionality infringe certain of its patents is tantamount to accusing Intel of
infringement. Intel, therefore, has a direct interest in the outcome of this litigation. Moreover,
Intel has agreed to defend and partially indemnify customers who have requested indemnity in
connection with U.S. Ethernet’s claims directed against Intel products incorporated into those
customers' products. As a result, Intel has a substantial direct financial interest in the outcome of
this litigation.
Intel can also offer unique technical knowledge and expertise as the designer and
manufacturer of networking technology that its customers incorporate into the accused products.
To the extent that U.S. Ethernet subsequently sues other Intel customers, Intel’s interest in the
issues to be litigated here, such as claim interpretation, validity, and infringement based on Intel
components, will extend beyond this case to those future actions. This case is still in its initial
pleading phase and granting Intel leave to intervene would not prejudice any of the parties.
Denying the motion, however, would significantly prejudice Intel and other companies that use
Intel products. If Intel is denied the opportunity to defend its technology against U.S. Ethernet’s
allegations, its products may be found to infringe without Intel ever having had the benefit of a
full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues.
Intel therefore requests leave to intervene as of right in this action under Rule 24(a)(2), or
in the alternative, seeks the Court’s permission to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b)(1)(B). In
accordance with Rule 24(c), a copy of Intel’s proposed Complaint in Intervention is attached as

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

This Case Is In Its Initial Pleading Stage.

The Complaint was filed on October 9, 2009 for alleged infringement of United States
Patents 5,307,459, 5,434,872, 5,732,094, and 5,299,313. [Dkt. 1] Defendants include many
Intel Customers. Defendants Apple Inc., Dell Inc., and Hewlett-Packard Co. filed answers and
counterclaims to the Complaint on December 17, 2009. The remaining Defendants received
extensions and answered in mid January, 2010, and U.S. Ethernet received an extension to
respond to counterclaims in February, 2010. [Dkts. 37, 43, 55, 68, 82]
B.

This Action Implicates Products That Intel Sells To Its Customers.

Intel manufactures and sells networking solutions -- including the Intel® PRO/100 and
PRO/1000 network adapters and computer motherboard chipsets with integrated network
adapters -- that enable computers to connect to and communicate with networks and the Internet.
The Intel Customers incorporate these network interface components into some of the products
that are alleged to infringe U.S. Ethernet’s patents. In fact, U.S. Ethernet’s Complaint expressly
accuses an Intel component of infringement with respect to one defendant, stating “Dell imports,
makes, uses, offers for sale, and/or sells certain products and devices which embody one or more
claims of the Patents-in-Suit, including, without limitation, the Intel PRO/100, E1405, D420,
and Inspiron 1525 (collectively, the ‘Dell Accused Products’).” [Complaint (Dkt. 1), ¶ 25
(emphasis added).]
Many of the named defendants are significant customers of Intel, accounting for more
than one third of Intel’s net revenue in 2007. [See Intel 2008 Annual Report
http://www.intc.com/intelAR2008/business/marketing/index.html (visited December 14, 2009).]
Although Intel vigorously denies that its products or technology infringe U.S. Ethernet’s patents,

INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE - Page 3

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 4 of 14

it appears clear that U.S. Ethernet is accusing Intel networking technology incorporated in some
of the Intel Customers’ products.
C.

Intel Has Agreed to Partially Indemnify Its Customers Against Claims that
Their Intel-Based Products Infringe U.S. Ethernet’s Patents.

In the wake of the filing of the Complaint, at least six Intel customers – Asus, Toshiba,
Fujitsu, Apple, Dell, and Sony – have already demanded that Intel indemnify, defend, and hold
them harmless from U.S. Ethernet’s claims in this action, based on indemnity agreements
relating to their purchases of Intel networking products. [Ex. B (Declaration of Michael
Labbee)] Based on the nature of the claims at issue in this suit, Intel has agreed to defend and
partially indemnify those customers. Id. Other customer defendants may make similar indemnity
demands.
II.

ARGUMENT
Intel is entitled to intervene in this action as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2).

Alternatively, the Court should permit Intel to intervene under Rule 24(b)(1)(B).
A.

Intel Is Entitled To Intervene As A Matter Of Right.

Rule 24(a)(2) permits intervention on timely motion for anyone who:
claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the
action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter
impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties
adequately represent that interest.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). In assessing a motion to intervene as a matter of right, four
criteria are to be considered: (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the potential intervener’s
interest in the property or transaction that is the subject of the underlying lawsuit; (3) any
impairment to the intervener’s ability to protect its interest absent intervention; and (4) the
adequacy of the representation of the potential intervener’s interest by the existing parties. Ross
v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 745, 753 (5th Cir. 2005); State of Texas v. Am. Tobacco Co., No. 5-98CV-

INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE - Page 4

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 5 of 14

270, 1999 WL 1022129, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 5, 1999). Where the intervener’s interest is
substantial, for example where a manufacturer seeks to intervene in a suit brought against its
customer, the intervener’s interest is to be given a greater weight. See, e.g., Honeywell Int’l Inc.
v. Audiovox Commc’ns Corp., No. Civ. A. 04-1337-KAJ et al., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22933, at
*9-10 (D. Del. May 18, 2005); accord LG Elecs., Inc. v. Q-Lity Computer Inc., 211 F.R.D. 360
(N.D. Cal. 2002).
“The inquiry under [Rule 24] subsection (a)(2) is a flexible one, which focuses on the
particular facts and circumstances surrounding each application…intervention of right must be
measured by a practical rather than technical yardstick.” Ross, 426 F.3d at 753 (emphasis
added). Thus, for example, intervention is proper when the prejudice to the potential intervener
outweighs the potential prejudice to the remaining parties, particularly where there have been no
legally significant proceedings other than discovery. See Diaz v. S. Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d
1118, 1125-56 (5th Cir. 1970); Ross, 426 F. 3d at 753 (“Intervention should generally be allowed
where ‘no one would be hurt and great justice could be attained.’”).
As explained below, Intel’s request for intervention as a matter of right is well-founded.
1.

Intel’s motion to intervene is timely.

When evaluating whether a motion to intervene is timely, the Fifth Circuit has “set forth
four factors that must be considered,” including:
Factor 1. The length of time during which the would-be intervener actually or
reasonably should have known of his interest in the case before he petitioned for
leave to intervene. Factor 2. The extent of prejudice that the existing parties to the
litigation may suffer as a result of the would-be intervener’s failure to apply for
intervention as soon as he actually knew or reasonably should have known of his
interest in the case. Factor 3. The extent of the prejudice that the would-be
intervener may suffer if his petition for leave to intervene is denied. Factor 4. The
existence of unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination
that the application is timely.
Ross, 426 F.3d at 754 (citing Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257 (5th Cir. 1977)).
INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE - Page 5

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 6 of 14

Here, Intel is seeking to intervene at the initial stages of the litigation. No discovery has
taken place, and a docket control order has not been issued. Intel’s intervention will not
prejudice any of the existing parties. There can be no question that Intel has moved timely to
intervene. Ross, 426 F.3d at 756 (unless some result can be demonstrated that would not have
occurred “but-for” Intel’s failure to file its motion to intervene earlier, there is no prejudice to the
other parties); Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197, 1213 (11th Cir. 1989) (motion to intervene
was timely when filed before discovery had begun); Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 229
F.R.D. 669, 672 (N.D. Ala. 2005) (motion to intervene was timely when court had not yet
conducted proceedings on the merits and intervention would not delay the proceedings);
Travelsource Corp. v. Old Republic Int’l Corp., No. 85 C 8116, 1986 WL 3848, at *2 (N.D. Ill.
Mar. 14, 1986) (motion to intervene was timely because suit was only six months old and no
pleadings had been filed other than the complaint and answer).
2.

Intel has a compelling interest related to the property at issue.

“A party has an interest relating to the subject matter of an action when it has a ‘direct,
substantial, legally protectable interest in the proceedings.’” Am. Tobacco, 1999 WL 1022129,
at *2. “[T]he interest ‘test’ is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as
many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.” Ross,
426 F.3d at 757 (citations omitted).
Intervention is routinely granted as of right in patent actions where, as here, accused
products incorporate components manufactured by the intervening party. Chandler & Price Co.
v. Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., 296 US 53, 55 (1935) (manufacturer’s intervention in patent
infringement action against its customers was “necessary for the protection of its interest”);
Tegic Commc’ns Corp. v. Bd. Of Regents of the Univ. of Tex. Sys., 458 F.3d 1335, 1344 (Fed.
Cir. 2006) (“[T]o the extent that [the interest of the manufacturer of allegedly infringing

products] may be impaired by the Texas litigation, [the manufacturer] may seek to intervene in
that litigation.”); Stewart-Warner Corp. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 325 F.2d 822, 826 (2d Cir.
1963) (“There is no doubt of the propriety of [a party’s] intervention as the manufacturer and
vendor to [defendants] and others of the equipment alleged by [plaintiff] to be an infringement of
its [] patent[s].”); Honeywell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22933, at *9-10 (“It is impracticable to try
an infringement case against 40 some defendants or third-party defendants with many different
accused devices, and it is unwise to attempt any such thing when liability depends exclusively
upon infringement being found as to an LCD component that the defendants do not manufacture
and when at least some of the manufacturers of the LCDs are before the court and are willing to
stand behind their products in this litigation.”).2
Further, Intel has a substantial and protectable interest in defending the customers it has
agreed to partially indemnify. See Fisherman’s Harvest, Inc. v. U.S., 74 Fed. Cl. 681, 685
(2006) (“An indemnitor may be allowed to intervene in a lawsuit brought against an indemnitee
in order to protect its interest under an indemnity agreement.”) (internal citations omitted); IBM,
1994 WL 706208, at *5 (patent infringement claims against an indemnitee are in effect claims
against the indemnitor); Lemelson v. Larami Corp., No. 80CIV6081, 1981 WL 319072
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 1981) (permitting intervention in patent infringement action by manufacturer
that had an indemnification obligation). Moreover, Intel has many other customers that

(“[An intervening manufacturer] has more than a speculative economic interest, as the products
that it sells will be at the heart of the [patent infringement] litigation”); IBM Corp. v. Conner
Peripherals, Inc., No. C-93-20117, 1994 WL 706208, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 1994)

controllers that allegedly infringed” and “should be able to present facts relevant to whether the
controllers actually did infringe”); Engineered Sports Prods. v. Brunswick Corp., 362 F. Supp.
722, 729 (D. Utah 1973) (“The manufacturer is the party of greatest interest in a determination of
the patent’s validity…”).

incorporate its networking technology in their products. Consequently, the potential impact of
this litigation on Intel and its customers may extend beyond claims made by those named in this
suit.
3.

The disposition of this action may impair Intel’s ability to protect its
interests.

The nature of the intervenor’s interest and the effect that the outcome will have on its
ability to protect that interest are closely related factors for determining whether a motion to
intervene should be granted. Chiles, 865 F.2d at 1214. “‘The second cannot be answered without
reference to the first.’” Id. (quoting Hobson v. Hansen, 44 F.R.D. 18, 30 (D.D.C. 1968)). As a
general rule, “[i]f an absentee would be substantially affected in a practical sense by the
determination made in an action, he should … be entitled to intervene.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24,
Advisory Committee Notes, 1966 Amendments.
Intel’s ability to protect its interest will be significantly impaired if it cannot intervene. A
manufacturer has a strong interest in being heard on validity, infringement and claim
construction issues where the accused products incorporate its components. See Honeywell
Int’l., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22933, at *12-13 (in a patent infringement action, a manufacturer’s
interests “will be impaired or affected, as a practical matter, by the disposition of the action,
unless it is involved in the case directly and able to make its positions [on validity and
infringement] known”). Even if the result in this case may not have preclusive effects on Intel or
its other customers, Intel’s relationship with its customers will be affected if, as a practical
matter, the outcome in this case effectively prohibits its customers from selling products that
incorporate Intel networking technology. Katz v. Lear Siegler, Inc., 909 F.2d 1459, 1464 (Fed.
Cir. 1990) (“it is a simple fact of life that a manufacturer must protect its customers, either as a
matter of contract, or good business, or in order to avoid the damaging impact of an adverse

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 9 of 14

ruling against its products”) (citing Codex Corp. v. Milgo Elec. Corp., 553 F.2d 735 (1st Cir.
1977)); LG Elecs., 211 F.R.D. at 365 (a manufacturer’s legally protectable interest “will
unquestionably be impaired” if injunctive relief is granted and the manufacturer is prohibited
from selling its product); see also Ranger Ins. Co. v. United Housing of New Mexico, Inc., 488
F.2d 682, 683 (5th Cir. 1974) (the potential for a negative ruling and the potential consequence
of such a ruling are sufficient to support intervention as of right); Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.
v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 578 F.2d 1341, 1345 (10th Cir. 1978) (“there can be little
question but that the interests of [a licensee] would be affected” if the parties to the litigation
prevail and licenses are revoked).
Finally, as already discussed, Intel has agreed to partially indemnify its customers. Given
the high cost of patent litigation and its potential effects, Intel should be allowed to protect its
interests first hand. Intel should not be required to stand back and watch its fate litigated without
a say in the outcome.
4.

The named defendants inadequately represent Intel’s interests.

In evaluating whether a potential intervener’s interests are adequately represented, the
Fifth Circuit has described this burden as “minimal,” noting that the potential intervener need
only show that “representation by the existing parties may be inadequate.” Ross, 426 F.3d at 761
(emphasis added); see Edwards v. City of Houston, 78 F.3d 983, 1005 (5th Cir. 1996) (minimal
burden of would-be intervener to show inadequate representation met by showing that
representation by existing parties “may” be inadequate); Thurmond v. Compaq Computer Corp.,
No. 1:99-CV-711, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20893, at *4 (E.D. Tex. June 26, 2000) (Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 24(a) should be “construed broadly, in favor of the applicant[] for
intervention”).

INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE - Page 9

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 10 of 14

Existing parties may not adequately represent the intervenor’s interests where they
“possess interests inimical” to the proposed intervenor. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Falls
Chase Special Taxing Dist., 983 F.2d 211, 216 (11th Cir. 1993) (granting intervention where the
party to the litigation possessed interests antagonistic to intervenor’s objectives). In Honeywell,
for example, the court found that because Seiko was uniquely situated to understand and defend
its own products, its interests were not adequately represented by existing parties to the litigation,
even though Seiko’s customers obviously had an interest in vigorously defending against the
allegations of infringement. See Honeywell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22933, at *13.
In this case, Intel cannot rely on the Intel Customers to protect its interests. A
manufacturer like Intel is presumed to have a greater interest than its customers in defending
against actions of patent infringement involving its products. In practical terms, it makes more
sense for the manufacturer of component parts rather than the customer who uses those parts to
litigate issues such as infringement. Honeywell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22933, at *11 (“[F]rom
the perspective of the host of defendants [plaintiff] has chosen to sue, and in the interest of
judicial economy, dealing with the manufacturers first is the fairest and most efficient way to
proceed.”)
Further, the Intel Customers do not have the same knowledge or level of expertise that
Intel has with its own technology. The Intel Customers incorporate Intel’s highly complex
networking technology components into their products, but do not design or manufacture them.
Therefore, the Intel Customers may not be in a position to assert all applicable non-infringement
defenses or invalidity arguments. Id. at *4 (because a manufacturer “is uniquely situated to
understand and defend its own product, its interest are not adequately represented by existing
parties to the litigation”).

INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE - Page 10

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 11 of 14

Moreover, the Intel Customers may not see this case through to judgment. Settlement
negotiations can begin and the cost of litigation often forces parties to settle without addressing
the merits of the claims. Additionally, because the Intel Customers may have alternative
suppliers, they may not have so great an interest as Intel does in obtaining findings of invalidity
and non-infringement. Intervention as of right should be granted to one who may potentially
present a “more vigorous presentation” of its interests than the existing parties. N.Y. Pub.
Interest Research Group, Inc. v. Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y., 516 F.2d 350, 352 (2d Cir.
1975).
B.

Alternatively, the Court Should Exercise Its Discretion to Permit Intel to
Intervene.

Although Intel believes it is entitled to intervene as a matter of right, it moves in the
alternative for leave to intervene with permission of the Court. Intervention is permitted on
timely motion for anyone who “has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a
common question of law or fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).
Permissive intervention is allowed when three criteria are met: (1) the motion is
sufficiently timely; (2) there is a common question of law or fact between the intervener’s claim
or defense and the main action; and (3) intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the
adjudication of rights of the original parties. Am. Tobacco, 1999 WL 1022129, at * 1.
Permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(2) should be construed liberally to permit intervention
“when an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in
common.” See Dayton Indep. Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Mineral Prods. Co., Civ. A. Nos. B-8700507¬CA, B-88-00429-CA, 1989 WL 237732, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 14, 1989) (“Rule 24(b)
‘plainly dispenses with any requirement that the intervener [shall] have a direct, personal or
pecuniary interest in the subject of the litigation.’”) (citation omitted).

INTEL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO INTERVENE - Page 11

Case 6:09-cv-00448-JDL Document 107

Filed 01/29/10 Page 12 of 14

As discussed previously, this motion has been filed timely. Moreover, there are issues of
law and fact common among the indemnified Intel Customers and Intel. U.S. Ethernet is
accusing them of infringement based on their use of Intel networking technology. The common
questions of law and fact include whether the claims asserted in the accused patents are valid and
enforceable and whether the Intel Customers’ products that incorporate Intel networking
technology infringe. Intel’s Complaint in Intervention, which seeks declaratory judgment of
non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the patents in suit, raises questions of law
and fact that overlap with the defenses that the Intel Customers will likely assert in this action.
See Reid v. Gen. Motors Corp., 240 F.R.D. 257, 260 (E.D. Tex. 2006) (granting manufacturer
permissive intervention in patent infringement action due to common issues); Lemelson, 1981
WL 319072, at *1 (common questions of fact and law exist when validity of patent is essential to
both named defendants and intervenor); Salem Eng’g Co. v. Nat’l Supply Co., 75 F. Supp. 993,
996 (W.D. Pa. 1948) (granting permissive intervention to manufacturer in patent infringement
action because “‘it is plain the applicant’s defense and the main action have a question of law
and fact in common.’”).
Finally, Intel’s intervention will not in any way delay the adjudication of these claims.
To the contrary, Intel’s intervention will simplify these proceedings given the complex nature of
technology and the patent infringement claims.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Intel respectfully requests that the Court grant its Motion to

Intervene as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2), or alternatively, to intervene by
permission pursuant to Rule 24(b)(1)(B).
