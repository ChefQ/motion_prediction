Defendants.

INTEL CORPORATION’S SECOND NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY
IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE
Intel’s motion to intervene (Dkt. 107) is pending. USEI continues to oppose this motion,
despite USEI’s specific allegations against numerous Intel products in its Rule 3-1 Infringement
Contentions.
USEI has now served two subpeonas on Intel seeking extensive discovery, as though
Intel were a party in this case. One subpoena seeks a 30(b)(6) deposition of Intel on topics that
essentially cover every aspect of the design, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of
Intel’s networking products implicated by USEI in this case, underscoring Intel’s extensive
involvement in this case. These topics also go beyond Intel’s own products, and seek Intel’s
knowledge of the USEI patents in suit and earlier litigations relating to these patents, the
inventors of the patents in suit, and even Intel’s own licensing and indemnity policies. (See

Exhibit A, USEI Subpoena to Intel to Produce Documents.) USEI served a companion subpoena
for production of documents on essentially the same topics. (Exhibit B, USEI Subpoena to Intel
for Deposition.)
In short, USEI is treating Intel as a party for purposes of discovery while still trying to
deny Intel the opportunity to participate in this case as a party. Intel requests that the Court grant
its motion to intervene.
