PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO STRIKE EXPERT REPORT OF
CHRISTOPHER WYATT
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiffs oppose Chase’s Motion to Strike the Expert Report of Christopher Wyatt.
The motion perversely attempts to confuse Mr. Wyatt’s discussion of the bases for his
opinions with the opinions themselves. The fact that Mr. Wyatt cogently summarizes the
HAMP guidelines and government reports supporting his opinions does not make the
opinions themselves inadmissible. As this Court has noted, the Court is “perfectly capable
of distinguishing admissible from inadmissible expert opinion.” Beal v. Blache, 2005 WL
352861, p. *1, n.2 (D. Mass. 2005). Here, there is nothing inadmissible whatsoever as the
factual and legal summaries of supporting materials are not being offered as expert opinion,
but rather as background material supporting Mr. Wyatt’s opinions. Including background
material in an expert report is expressly permitted by the relevant rule and the explanatory
Advisory Committee Notes.

In addition, for the reasons set forth below, Mr. Wyatt’s opinions are well-grounded
in both his uniquely relevant experiences and in material in the public record. There is no
reason to strike any portion of his report.
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Contrary to Chase’s position, Mr. Wyatt does not purport to offer legal opinions of
any kind. He is not a lawyer. Mr. Wyatt has over 20 years of experience working in the
residential mortgage loan servicing industry. Wyatt Report at 2. He has worked for
multiple lenders and as a private consultant on mortgage servicing issues. Id. Mr. Wyatt
has specific experience with servicer implementation of HAMP, having supervised the
implementation of HAMP at Litton Loan Servicing, LP, one of the nation’s largest loan
servicers, where he was responsible for identifying potential operational risks related to the
program and where he managed an “elevated call” center to address consumer complaints
regarding HAMP. Id.
In addition to his general experience in mortgage servicing and his specific
experience in implementing HAMP, Mr. Wyatt bases his expert opinion on a careful and
thorough review of the HAMP Program Documentation, the Servicer Performance Reports
prepared by Treasury and Chase’s testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives
Committee for Financial Services, regarding its understaffing and lack of adequate processes
for handling loan modifications. Id. at 1. Furthermore, Mr. Wyatt has personal experience
with Chase’s inadequate processing of HAMP applications from the outside, through
assisting a homeowner seeking a Home Affordable Modification from Chase. Id. at 2.
His opinions cover only the following issues:
2

1. Whether Chase routinely fails to comply with HAMP and why. (Mr. Wyatt
concludes that Chase has not complied with HAMP requirements because it
had inadequate staff who are inadequately trained.)
2. The likely number of class members in Massachusetts. (Mr. Wyatt concludes
that there are at least 250 class members – a conservative conclusion now
confirmed by Chase’s recent admission that there are more than 1850 class
members. Declaration of Karen Shine, (“Shine Decl.”) ¶ 4.)
3. The consequences to homeowners of Chase’s failure to convert TPPs into
permanent modifications. (Mr. Wyatt concludes that homeowners in
unconverted TPPs and/or those who receive delayed permanent modifications
suffer harm in the form of increased interest obligations, increased default
and delinquency charges, loss of valuable credit reporting benefits, and
various forms of stressful debt collection and foreclosure activities even if no
foreclosure ultimately occurs).
III. ARGUMENT
A. Mr. Wyatt’s Report Contains Relevant and Admissible Subject Matter, Not
“Legal Conclusions”
A fair assessment of Mr. Wyatt's report reveals that it is not a legal opinion nor does
it contain legal testimony. The rules expressly allow expert testimony where “scientific,
technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the
evidence” Fed. R. Evid. 702 (emphasis added). The Advisory Committee Note to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 702 states “[I]t might also be important in some cases for an expert to educate the
3

factfinder about general principles…” Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee Notes (2000
Amendments).
The expert opinions and the summary of HAMP requirements offered by Mr. Wyatt
are especially appropriate in this case because Chase acknowledges that the HAMP Program
Documentation is voluminous and complex. Mem. in Supp. of Def.s Mot. to Dismiss [Dckt
12] at 4 (“On April 6, 2009, Treasury issued its first Supplemental Directive. It has since
issued fourteen additional Supplemental Directives, the most recent of which was issued on
June 3, 2010.”); Id. at 3 (The guidelines, inter alia, “specify threshold criteria,” “enumerate
a sequence of steps for servicers to apply to the loans of potentially eligible borrowers” and
establish “a process for comparing the net present value (‘NPV’) of a HAMP modified loan
to the NPV of an unmodified loan”). Where an expert has extensive experience in a “highly
specialized world,” as Mr. Wyatt does, it is appropriate for the Court to give credence to his
conclusions regarding the meaning of documents. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Seven
Provinces Ins. Co., Ltd., 9 F.Supp.2d 49, 52 (D.Mass. 1998), aff’d, 217 F.3d 33 (1st Cir.
2000).
As the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 702 instruct, “[t]here is no more certain
test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the
untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible
degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having specialized
understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.” Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory
Committee Notes (2000 Amendments).

B. Mr. Wyatt’s Opinion is Based on His Extensive Experience in the Field at
Issue and on Reliable Public Information
Uniquely, Mr. Wyatt’s lending industry background makes him an expert in both
loan servicing issues and in the implementation of HAMP. See Section II. There is
probably no other person in the country with a background similar to Mr. Wyatt’s who is
willing to step forward to provide expert evidence for Plaintiffs in cases like the one before
the Court. That experience alone qualifies him to offer opinions to assist the Court. As the
Advisory Committee has noted:
Nothing in the amendment is intended to suggest that experience alone – or
experience in conjunction with other knowledge, skill, training, or education – may
not provide a sufficient foundation for expert testimony. To the contrary, the text of
Rule 702 contemplates that an expert may be qualified on the basis of experience.
Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee Notes (2000 Amendments).
Moreover, Chase does not meaningfully assert that the material in the public record
that Mr. Wyatt describes as the bases for his opinion – including the HAMP guidelines – are
unreliable or outside of the normal purview for expert assistance to the factfinder here.
Again, as the Advisory Committee Notes, “The Amendment does not alter the venerable
practice of using expert testimony to educate the factfinder on general principles.” Fed. R.
Evid. 702 Advisory Committee Notes (2000 Amendments). See Ji v. Bose Corp., 538 F.
Supp. 2d 354, 358 (D.Mass. 2008) (background information on industry standards and
practices are permissible expert testimony). While the general principles are otherwise
available in the record, Mr. Wyatt’s summary provides a direct connection between the
information he relies on and the Opinions he offers. See Suskind v. Home Depot Corp., 2001
WL 92183, at *1 (D. Mass., Jan. 2, 2001) (expert report properly summarizes materials

5

relied on). Had he not included it, Chase would undoubtedly be arguing that it could not
determine the specific basis for Mr. Wyatt’s otherwise admissible opinions.
IV.

Chase’s Motion to Strike the Expert Report of Christopher Wyatt should be denied.
