DEFENDANT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S MOTION TO
STRIKE EXPERT REPORT OF CHRISTOPHER WYATT

INTRODUCTION
In support of their motion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification,
plaintiffs submitted the expert report of Christopher Wyatt (“Wyatt”) regarding defendant
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s (“Chase’s”) alleged failure to convert Trial Period Plans (“TPPs”)
into permanent loan modifications as purportedly required under the Home Affordable
Modification Program (“HAMP”). [Dkt. 23.] As Federal Rule of Evidence 702 makes clear,
however, expert testimony is admissible only if it is both relevant and reliable. See Kumho Tire
Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147-49 (1999). Wyatt’s testimony is neither. First, Wyatt’s
expert report is not relevant because it merely states legal conclusions. Second, Wyatt fails to
establish a reliable basis for his opinions. Accordingly, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence
702, Chase moves this Court to issue an order striking Wyatt’s expert report in its entirety.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE COURT SHOULD STRIKE THE WYATT EXPERT REPORT
BECAUSE IT CONSISTS OF NOTHING MORE THAN INADMISSIBLE
LEGAL CONCLUSIONS.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, expert testimony should only be admitted if it is
relevant in the sense that it “will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine
a fact in issue[.]” Fed. R. Evid. 702; see also Cipollone v. Yale Indus. Prods., 202 F.3d 376, 380
(1st Cir. 2000) (“[T]he ultimate purpose of the [expert evidence] inquiry is to determine whether
the testimony of the expert would be helpful to the jury in resolving a fact in issue.”); RuizTroche v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal citation
omitted) (“To be admissible, expert testimony must be relevant not only in the sense that all
evidence must be relevant, but also in the incremental sense that the expert’s proposed opinion, if
admitted, likely would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.”); SEC v.
Goldsworthy, No. 06-10012-JGD, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62223, at *5-6 (D. Mass. Jan. 3, 2008)

1

(internal quotations and citation omitted) (“[A]n expert opinion must be helpful to the trier of
fact and should not be admitted where it would merely tell the jury what result to reach.”).
Legal conclusions, i.e. opinions on an ultimate issue of law, are not a proper subject of
expert testimony. See, e.g., Levin v. Dalva Bros., Inc., 459 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir. 2006)
(“Generally, an expert may not offer an opinion concerning a legal question.”); Gomez v. Rivera
Rodriguez, 344 F.3d 103, 114 (1st Cir. 2003) (“Courts generally have held legal opinion
testimony inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 702.”); United States v. Prigmore, 243 F.3d 1, 18-19
n.3 (1st Cir. 2001) (“[E]xpert testimony proffered solely to establish the meaning of a law is
presumptively improper.”). This is so because expert testimony that articulates and applies the
relevant law does not assist the decision-maker. Rather, it circumvents the decision-making
function by telling the judge or jury how to decide the case. See Nieves-Villanueva v. SotoRivera, 133 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 1997) (expert testimony containing legal conclusions cannot
properly assist the trier of fact); Ji v. Bose Corp., 538 F. Supp. 2d 354, 357-58 (D. Mass. 2008)
(citation omitted) (“An expert may not ‘assist’ the jury by expounding upon the law . . . .”);
Chapman v. Bernard’s, Inc., 167 F. Supp. 2d 406, 421 (D. Mass. 2001) (“[An expert] is not
qualified . . . to state conclusions of law because such conclusions do not ‘assist the trier of fact’
as required by Rule 702.”).
Exclusion of Wyatt’s expert report is proper here. The vast majority of Wyatt’s report
(15 of 18 pages) simply characterizes the Treasury guidelines and initiatives regarding HAMP.
Wyatt then purports to apply these guidelines to Chase’s conduct in order to assert his ultimate
legal conclusion — that “Chase fails to meet its obligations under TPP agreements.” (Wyatt
Expert Report at 16.) Wyatt’s interpretation of what is purportedly promised in the TPPs is a
naked legal conclusion far afield from any appropriate subject of expert testimony. See

2

Goldsworthy, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62223, at *11 (internal quotations and citations omitted)
(“[I]t is not appropriate to have experts opine as to the legal obligations of the parties under the
contract. The question of interpretation of the contract is for the jury and the question of legal
effect is for the judge. In neither case do [courts] permit expert testimony.”). This is a clear
attempt to circumvent the Court’s decision-making function by offering an “expert” opinion on
the legal effect of the TPPs and the proper legal interpretation of the HAMP guidelines.
Indeed, the court in Pelletier came to the same conclusion in a similar case. There, the
plaintiff argued that the district court improperly excluded the testimony of a safety expert
regarding the applicability of Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations to the
defendant’s conduct. Pelletier, 470 F.3d at 54-55. The Court of Appeals disagreed, explaining
that the expert testimony amounted to nothing more than an interpretation “about the law that
would impinge on the roles of the judge and the jury.” Id. Wyatt’s expert report does nothing to
assist the Court in resolving a fact at issue and should likewise be excluded.
Wyatt’s conclusions about Chase’s compliance with HAMP guidelines are also
irrelevant, even under plaintiffs’ theories of liability. All of plaintiffs’ claims are predicated on
the notion that borrowers who enter into TPPs, make the three initial payments as required, and
submit the requested documentation, are automatically entitled to a permanent HAMP
modification. (FAC ¶¶ 1-5, 33-43, 131, 145, 152, 158, 162, 165). There is no claim for breach
of the HAMP guidelines themselves. Moreover, Wyatt’s rank speculation about whether Chase
provided timely decisions on HAMP eligibility and why are of no legal consequence.
II.

THE COURT SHOULD STRIKE WYATT’S EXPERT REPORT FOR THE
ADDITIONAL REASON THAT IT IS UNRELIABLE.

In addition to being irrelevant, Wyatt’s expert report is also unreliable because it fails to
adequately support his conclusions. See Fed. R. Evid. 702 (expert testimony must be “the

3

product of reliable principles and methods,” which the expert must have applied “reliably to the
facts of the case”); see also Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. 137 at 142 (the district court has “the
same broad latitude when it decides how to determine reliability as it enjoys in respect to its
ultimate reliability determination”) (emphasis in original). For instance, Wyatt opines that,
“based on my experience in the industry, research, and my personal experience in assisting a
homeowner with a Chase loan modification, Chase’s failure to meet [its obligation under the
TPP agreements] is directly caused by inadequate staffing and procedures.” (Wyatt Expert
Report at 16.) However, Wyatt fails to demonstrate how his experience with a single
homeowner supports his conclusion that Chase is failing in its obligations to all homeowners.
Nor does Wyatt explain on what conceivable basis he concluded that Chase’s purported failures
as to this particular customer (or any other customers) were due to the lack of staff and adequate
procedures. Indeed, even if an expert witness relies “solely or primarily on experience, [he] must
explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient
basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 702
advisory committee’s note. Wyatt does not even attempt to meet this burden in his expert report.
Wyatt likewise fails to explain how Chase’s congressional testimony has any bearing on
its supposed failure to meet its obligations under TPP agreements. According to Wyatt, Chase
indicated in its congressional testimony that “it was undertaking aggressive initiatives designed
to convert eligible active TPP’s into permanent loan modifications” by “initiating, among other
things, new call campaigns, hiring hundreds of new staff, centralizing documentation and
tracking systems to effectively implement, manage, and timely convert eligible aged TPP’s into
permanent loan modifications.” (Wyatt Expert Report at 15.) Wyatt then concludes that Chase’s
alleged failure to convert TPPs is the result of “inadequate staffing and procedures.” (Id. at 16.)

4

This conclusion could only be supported, however, if Chase failed to follow through on its
publicly announced initiatives — a fact Wyatt wholly fails to address. Instead, he states only
that inadequate staffing and procedures have “persisted.” (Id.) As with his reliance on his
personal experience with a homeowner, Wyatt here too fails to make the required connection
between the basis for his opinion and his ultimate conclusion. See United States v. Certain Land
Located in County of Barnstable, 674 F.2d 90, 93 n.4 (1st Cir. 1982) (“The fact that a witness is
an expert does not justify an opinion for which he can show no basis or reason.”).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Wyatt’s expert report is both irrelevant and unreliable.
Accordingly, the Court should issue an order striking the report in its entirety pursuant to Federal
Rule of Evidence 702.
