DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR
CONDITIONAL CERTIFICATION AND JUDICIAL NOTICE1
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs are three current independent contractor distributors with Flowers Baking Co.

of Jamestown, LLC (“Flowers/Jamestown”) who have ever operated only out of 3 of
Flowers/Jamestown’s 24 warehouses.2 They seek, however, FLSA conditional certification of—
and notice to—a class of close to 230 current and former independent contractor distributors
who, among other things, work at all 24 warehouses throughout North Carolina and portions of
South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, with some 25 different managers who exercised
different levels of oversight, for different customers with different customer-service
requirements, who took advantage of different entrepreneurial opportunities. Alleging they are
misclassified as independent contractors under federal and state law, Plaintiffs ultimately seek an
order declaring them and other Jamestown distributors to be employees. Yet admittedly they do
not all seek this same relief: while one definitively testified that he wants to be an employee,

concurrently herewith.

Likewise, the 6 other individuals who have filed opt-in consents to join this action also ever worked only out of
these same 3 warehouses.

Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 1 of 28

another did not. And, just 1 day before Plaintiffs filed their Motion, another acted independently
by entering into a purchase agreement to sell what he advertised as his “independent distributor
business” to an outside buyer for $150,000.
Plaintiffs’ request for notice is based entirely on their contention that all Jamestown
distributors are misclassified as independent contractors, which is insufficient, as a matter of law,
to support their request. As discussed below, Plaintiffs fail to provide any factual evidence of a
common unlawful policy applicable to all Jamestown distributors in all 24 warehouses. In fact,
they uniformly testified at deposition that they know of no such common policies. What is more,
they all admit they have no personal knowledge about how other Jamestown distributors—in
their own or in the other 21 warehouses—operate their distributorships, how often they interact
with management, or what each manager’s individual practices are with respect to distributors.
While these admissions alone are fatal to Plaintiffs’ Motion, even under the “lenient
standard” typically applied at this stage, the individualized nature of their claims is an
independent basis upon which to deny their motion. To adjudicate Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court
must first analyze, for each Plaintiff and opt-in, whether, to what extent, and over what time
period each Jamestown distributor3: (1) was subject to control by his individual manager(s); (2)
took advantage of the various entrepreneurial opportunities available in different accounts (i.e.
utilizing helpers or assistants, buying or selling distribution rights, incorporating, etc.); (3)
realized the opportunity for profit or loss through individualized sales efforts, accounts opening
or closing in his defined territory, and the like; and (4) worked elsewhere, operated additional
businesses, or sold non-competitive products, among others—all of which Plaintiffs admit can,
and do, vary by distributor, geographic area, account composition, and over time. Even if all
these inquiries, on balance, did support employee status (they do not), the Court would then need

Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 2 of 28

to determine whether each individual is exempt under the outside sales and/or motor carrier
exemptions, both of which require substantial individualized inquiries and proof down to such
details as the specific weight of the vehicle driven and products ordered each day. And, as
Plaintiffs’ own testimony establishes, both factors can—and do—vary from distributor to
distributor and from day to day.
In short, Plaintiffs ask this Court to conditionally certify and send notice to all current and
former Jamestown distributors over a three-year period based on nothing more than their own
conclusory assertions, which are admittedly not based on any personal knowledge whatsoever
and do not even point to—let alone establish—a common unlawful policy. Plaintiffs’ purported
“evidence” fails to meet their burden. This Court should deny their Motion accordingly.
II.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

The Parties and Putative Opt-ins.

Headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia, Flowers Foods, Inc. (“Flowers Foods”) is the
parent holding company of numerous operating subsidiaries throughout the country, each of
which is organized as a separate legal entity and is responsible for its own day-to-day operations.
Flowers/Jamestown is one such subsidiary. (Affidavit of Chuck Rich ¶ 24; Affidavit of Paul
Holshouser ¶ 15.) Flowers/Jamestown contracts with independent contractor distributors6 who
purchase distribution rights to sell and distribute different branded products to customers in a
defined geographic territory. (Holshouser Aff. ¶¶ 6-8.) From 2009 to the present,
Flowers/Jamestown had contracted with—at one time or another—some 230 different
distributors. (Holshouser Aff. ¶ 13.) Flowers/Jamestown has a bakery in Jamestown, N.C.,

4

The Affidavit of Chuck Rich is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
The Affidavit of Paul Holshouser is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
6
As Plaintiffs themselves acknowledged, Flowers Foods is not a party to any of these contracts. (See, e.g., Riley
Dep. 64:4-10; Rehberg Dep. 90:24-91:8; Glavey Dep. 149:22-150:11; Ronchetti Dep. 29:14-30:16.)

Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 3 of 28

where it produces several bread and bun products and also operates 24 different warehouses
throughout North Carolina and portions of South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia from
which distributors pick up products for ultimate sale and distribution to end customers. (Id. ¶ 3.)
Each warehouse has its own sales manager(s), who serves as the primary point-of-contact with
distributors. (Riley Dep. 47:16-187; Holshouser Aff. ¶ 3.)

During the past three years,

Flowers/Jamestown has employed over 25 different sales managers and 7 additional Directors of
Sales, who typically only get involved in distributor-related issues from time to time.
(Holshouser Aff. ¶¶ 3-5.)
Plaintiff Rehberg has been a distributor since November 22, 2004, and has only ever
operated out of the Monroe/Indian Trail, N.C. warehouse. (Rehberg Dep. 10:11-24 & Ex. 5.)
Rehberg purchased his distributorship to build equity in a business and has been successful in
doing so. (Rehberg Dep. 15:2-9.) He recently advertised his distributorship for sale on
“Routesforsale.com,” describing it as an “independent” and “successful business” with “good
growth opportunity.” (Id. at 17:18-23, 22:7-24:18 & Ex. 1.) Just one day before Plaintiffs’ filed
their Motion, Rehberg independently entered into a purchase agreement with a prospective buyer
to sell his distributorship for $150,000. (Rehberg Dep. 15:19-16:15, 29:12-23 & Ex. 2.) Plaintiff
Riley has been a distributor since October 25, 1994 and has only ever operated out of the Rock
Hill, S.C. warehouse. (Riley Dep. 12:15-17 & Ex. 2.) Riley joined this lawsuit because he is
interested in becoming an employee. (Riley Dep. 145:1-3.) Plaintiff Ronchetti has been a
distributor since December 12, 2005 and has only ever operated out of the Concord, N.C.
warehouse. (Ronchetti Dep. 26:5-15 & Ex. 2.) Ronchetti, conversely, does not want to become
an employee. (Id. 79:20-80:2.) See also Holshouser Aff. ¶ 6 (noting contract dates).

The opt-in Plaintiffs, including Bobby Shillinglaw, Donald Keistler, Cliff Glavey, Paul
English, Johnny Easley, and Ken Kirk, have also ever operated only out of these same three
warehouses for different periods of time. All but one—namely Shillinglaw—are current
distributors. (Holshouser Aff. ¶ 6.) The two opt-ins who were deposed8 do not seek the same
relief Plaintiffs have requested in the Complaint. See, e.g., English Dep. 97:19-98:2 (does not
want to be an employee); Glavey Dep. 183:19-184:2 (seeking to have the contract to “allow us to
be independent distributors”).
B.

The Distributorship Model Contains Numerous Individualized Indicia of
Independent Contractor Status.

Jamestown distributors (“distributors”) purchase different products from the bakery at a
specified discount, which they sell and market to customers and potential customers in their
respective territories. (Holshouser Aff. ¶ 9). Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertions, distributors
determine what products to order for their customers based on their customers’ individual needs
by making adjustments to the suggested order in their handheld computers.9 (Riley Dep. 124:14125:4, 126:23-127:8.) Distributors can—and often do—make significant adjustments to the
suggested orders based on various individualized factors such as weather, holidays, competition
pricing, and the like. (Riley Dep. 128:12-129:22 (regularly adjusts suggested orders based on
different factors which change over time); Ronchetti Dep. 91:8-15 (responsible for ordering
products) & 105: 17-109:5 (adjusts orders based on experience.); Rehberg Dep. 119:5-120:16 &
Ex. 8 (makes adjustments to orders).) Products are then produced in response to these specific

8

Defendants were permitted to take the depositions of three opt-in Plaintiffs prior to filing their response: namely,
Cliff Glavey and Paul English. The third opt-in who was scheduled to be deposed, Donald Keistler, had a family
emergency. (Ct. Doc. No. 31.)
9
The type of products sold also varies by distributor, over time, and by region. (Riley Dep. 124:3-17; Rehberg Dep.
93:16-94:1; English Dep. 29:17-33:1 (discussing products he sold over time and changes thereto, including
TastyKake, which he just started selling over past year); 125:12-24 (discussing how some products, like TastyKake,
sell much better in more affluent areas); Riley Dep. 66:9-17 (focuses on selling all products equally); and Glavey
Dep. 151:5-7 (focuses on selling branded products).)

5
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 5 of 28

orders and are shipped to the warehouse for ultimate pick-up, distribution, and sale by
distributors to end customers for whom such products were ordered. (Holshouser Aff. ¶ 9.)
Many of these products, including all TastyKake and Blue Bird products, are produced by
bakeries out of state. (Id.) Distributors order these products in varying amounts and at different
times based on their customers’ needs. See, e.g., Riley Dep. 124:7-17 (ordering TastyKake some
but not all months) and 124:7-25 (ordering BlueBird regularly); Rehberg Dep. 97:9-10, 97:2498:2 (sells TastyKake and BlueBird). Distributors determine the hours they operate based on
their

needs

from

Flowers/Jamestown. (Rehberg Dep. 77:6-21; 78:24-79:24; English Dep. 73:1-19; Glavey Dep.
138:25-141:10.) The hours worked vary from distributor to distributor. (Riley Dep. 40:21-23;
42:8-10.)
The distributor business model used by Flowers/Jamestown has been repeatedly upheld
as an independent-contractor relationship.

It is premised on the belief that independent

distributors who own their own distribution rights will have more entrepreneurial incentive to
develop business and generate additional sales, based on their own individual efforts and
individualized sales strategies. (Rich Aff. ¶ 7.)10 Thus, the Distributor Agreement Jamestown
distributors sign contains numerous indicia of independent-contractor status, including
responsibility for all business-related expenses; purchase of a defined proprietary interest; and
the right, among others, to hire helpers, to advertise, to incorporate, to own outside businesses, to
perform work elsewhere, and to buy and sell distribution rights—in whole or in part. (Ex. 3 to
10

As Plaintiffs correctly point out, Flowers/Jamestown treats its distributors as “statutory employees” under the
Internal Revenue Code. However, Plaintiffs’ understanding “statutory employee” is incorrect. The term “statutory
employee” is specifically defined in a section of the Internal Revenue Code under which certain categories of
common law independent contractors, including bakery distributors, are treated as employees for Federal
Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) purposes only, and the appropriateness of this treatment as been confirmed by
the I.R.S. (Rich Aff. ¶¶ 3-6.) Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertions and misguided understanding, statutory
employee treatment, by definition, confirms—rather than undermines—independent contractor status.

Pls. Brief (Ct. Doc. No. 28-3).) As discussed below and as Plaintiffs freely admit, the extent to
which these opportunities are taken advantage of varies from distributor to distributor.
C.

Plaintiffs Uniformly Admit the Individualized Nature of Their Claims.

At deposition, Plaintiffs uniformly admit the individualized nature of their claims. First,
the composition of their customer base creates individualized differences in how they operate
their distributorships and how they have done so over time. Plaintiffs and other Jamestown
distributors service both cash and authorized charge accounts, like Wal-Mart, Food Lion, and
other chain accounts, the composition and profitability of which varies from distributor to
distributor. E.g., Rehberg Dep. 93:16-94:1 (“[S]ome guys have a lot of [cash accounts] some—
some don’t.”); 95:18-22, 104:7-9; Riley Dep. 84:22-25 (admitting number of cash and charge
accounts varies among distributors); Glavey Dep. 115:9-116:11, 130:9-11 (discussing Gail’s, a
non-chain account that is his most profitable and constitutes 45% of his total sales). The
composition of cash versus charge accounts also varies over time. E.g. Rehberg Dep. 94:1695:11 (had one cash account until recently when two were added); 99:17-100:6 (Bi-Lo and
Harris Teeter opened in territory over time); Glavey Dep. 128:10-19, 129:13-130:8, 137:9-138:5
(discussing increase in national accounts over time).
The different authorized charge accounts have different customer-service requirements,
which impacts how and when such accounts are serviced. (Riley Dep. 85:16-87:1; Rehberg Dep.
100:7-25; Glavey Dep. 105:17-106:7.)

In cash accounts, distributors can extend credit,

determine days and times of service, and may have more discretion on marketing, product mix,
displays, and the like. (Riley Dep. 81:4-16; Ronchetti Dep. 52:14-53:10; Rehberg Dep. 94:1995:17, 96:10-18; Glavey Dep. 144:4-9, 157:6-158:14.) Conversely, charge accounts may have
different marketing programs and promotions, hours of service requirements, and other service
procedures, which vary from account to account and over time. (Glavey Dep. 105:17-106:7;
7
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 7 of 28

112:15-114:12, 128:10-19, 129:13-130:8, 137:9-138:14 (discussing changes over time and
onslaught of charge accounts following closure of Hostess); English Dep. 71:23-72:25, 73:20-24;
Rehberg Dep. 79:14-80:4.)
Further, the extent to which Plaintiffs and other distributors take advantage of various
entrepreneurial opportunities afforded by the independent-contractor distributor model varies.
See, e.g., Ronchetti Dep. 34:25-35:14 (we all “do our own thing.”). For example, some Plaintiffs
solicit new accounts for new business, ask for displays, and engage in other individualized
activities to build their sales. See, e.g., Ronchetti Dep. 58:18-60:13 (has picked up some new
accounts on his own and asks for displays from time to time), 69:3-70:11; Glavey Dep. 181:10182:2 (gives holiday gift cards to customers to build business). Others do not. See, e.g., Riley
Dep. 82:12-83:3 (hasn’t tried to pick up new accounts in the past 3 years because has been “too
maxed out”); English Dep. 44:19-45:2 (same); Rehberg Dep. 81:16-24 (same). Some Plaintiffs
and distributors have purchased and sold off portions of their distribution rights for various
reasons in the past three years, and others have not. Compare Ronchetti Dep. 72:5-73:10 (sold
rights to Food Lion), Rehberg 46:19-47:3, 102:25-103:7 (sold portions “multiple times”), Glavey
Dep. 92:1-94:13 & Ex. 2 (arranging sale of distribution rights to store with other distributor) with
English Dep. 27:14-21 (hasn’t sold any portions in past three years).11 This, too, varies from
distributor to distributor and depending on the economy and other factors. (Rehberg Dep. 50:912; Glavey Dep. 95:6-25.)

Some Plaintiffs regularly hire helpers to assist with servicing

territories, even on a full-time basis, and others do not. Compare English Dep. 50:3-7, 12-21
(admitting he uses helpers “all but maybe ten” days a year, including on full-time basis) with
Glavey Dep. 47:7-49:2 (use of helpers less frequent). Hiring and using helpers varies from

11

In fact, some Plaintiffs are currently trying to sell their territories—in whole or in part—to outside buyers.
(Glavey Dep. 99:7-101:10; Rehberg Dep. 17:18-23, 22:7-24:18 & Ex. 1.)

8
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 8 of 28

distributor to distributor—“its all different.” (Rehberg Dep. 39:2-8.)

Some Plaintiffs and

distributors have changed the price on products sold to customers, and others have not. Compare
Ronchetti Dep. 109:16-110:1 (changed price on products sold to one account to keep account)
with Rehberg Dep. 95:23-96:3 (never changes price).
As the examples below illustrate, which are far from exhaustive, management policies
and practices also vary by warehouse, manager, from distributor to distributor, and over time:
•

different practices for group meetings- compare English Dep. 63:13-19, 64:1321 (management in Concord never has group meetings with distributors) with
Riley Dep. 38:6-14 (management in Rock Hill has group meetings with
distributors whenever there are new product promotions, among others);

•

different local management practices at different times regarding oversight
of distributors-see, e.g., Glavey Dep. 126:17-128:9 (describing two different
Concord sales managers with “definitely” different management styles—one who
had several rules and the other who treated him like more of an independent
distributor); Ronchetti Dep. 108:1-7 (management may help newer distributors
more with ordering);

•

different practices for approval of hiring helpers- compare Ronchetti Dep.
12:16-13:19 (management approval of helpers is required) with Glavey Dep.
50:8-11 (no such approval is required);

•

different practices for management changes to orders- compare Ronchetti
Dep. 97:1-19 (management in Concord has not made any changes to his orders in
the past year but before that, they did make changes to his orders from time to
time) with Riley Dep. 130:5-16 (management in Rock Hill makes changes to his
orders “quite a few times”—or “maybe 30, 40 times a year.”) and Rehberg Dep.
122:13-123:1 (Indian Trail management changes orders “numerous times”);12

•

different consequences for cutting orders added by management -compare
Ronchetti Dep. 62:13-65:10 (can cut orders management adds) with English Dep.
95:20-96:17 (cannot cut added orders because you will be “threatened” and
charged $200);

•

different protocol for handling stale products- compare Ronchetti Dep. 49:2451:19 (discussing that he sells stale product to Dollar Tree to make some money
on it) with Riley Dep. 58:14-59:15 (discussing policy in Rock Hill that he bring
stale back to warehouse and separate it into predetermined categories);

12

Riley Dep. 131:4-24, 132:3-133:12 (acknowledging that management’s practices regarding distributors cutting
product that has been added “changes by manager.”)

9
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 9 of 28

•

different practices regarding stale caps- see Rehberg Dep. 87:18-88:25
(testifying that some distributors in Monroe/Indian Trail are on “stale caps” to
control stale products, others are not.);

•

different practices about procuring vehicles- compare English Dep. 75:21-76:5
and Ronchetti Dep. 74:22-75:19 (only able to lease vehicle through company
program) with Riley Dep. 97:6-99:6 (has multiple vehicles and was not prohibited
from getting vehicles from outside source) and Glavey Dep. 163:15-165:17
(same).

All such factors are relevant to whether Plaintiffs and the distributors are—or are not—
truly independent contractors under the FLSA. See Schultz v. Capital Int’l Sec., Inc., 466 F.3d
298, 304-05 (4th Cir. 2006) (factors necessary to determination of independent contractor status
include: “(1) the degree of control that the putative employer has over the manner in which the
work is performed; (2) the worker's opportunities for profit or loss dependent on his managerial
skill; (3) the worker's investment in equipment or material, or his employment of other workers;
(4) the degree of skill required for the work; (5) the permanence of the working relationship; and
(6) the degree to which the services rendered are an integral part of the putative employer's
business.”) And, this limited deposition testimony establishes just how highly-individualized this
inquiry is, even within these three warehouses alone.
D.

Plaintiffs Uniformly Admit They Have No Personal Knowledge Of Any Common
Jamestown Policies or Procedures.

Plaintiffs argue that Defendants “dictate every aspect of [their’] jobs” through various
unidentified policies and procedures. (Pls.’ Mem. in Support of Mot. for Cond. Cert. and Judicial
Notice (Ct. Doc. No. 28-1) (“Pls.’ Brief”) Intro.) At deposition, however, Plaintiffs uniformly
admit they are not aware of any common policy applicable to all Jamestown distributors (other
than the Distributor Agreement itself, which by its terms establishes an independent-contractor
relationship and miscellaneous pricing information). See Riley Dep. 36:18-22 (admitting he has
no personal knowledge of any policies or procedures applicable to other Jamestown distributors);

Plaintiffs Uniformly Admit They Have No Personal Knowledge of How Other
Jamestown Distributors Run Their Distributorships.

Further, at deposition Plaintiffs uniformly admit they lack any personal knowledge
whatsoever about how other Jamestown distributors, current and former, both inside and outside

11
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 11 of 28

of their warehouses, operate their distributorships. See Exhibit E (attaching summary of
testimony establishing lack of personal knowledge).

As Plaintiff Ronchetti acknowledged,

“Everybody has their own style. We just—do our own thing.” (Ronchetti Dep. 34:25-35:14;
accord, Riley Dep. 120:10-16 (no knowledge of sales efforts by other distributors); Rehberg
Dep. 83:8-84:1 (same); Glavey 55:23-56:3, 122:2-123:2 (“I really don’t have much contact
with—with any of them” [i.e. other distributors at other Jamestown warehouses]).) Indeed,
Plaintiffs and the deposed opt-ins all testified they have never seen any other Jamestown
distributors servicing their customers in the field and their visits to other warehouses, if at all,
were for the sole purpose of picking up product. See, e.g., Rehberg Dep. 61:6-62:2 (sole purpose
of visiting limited number of other warehouses was for picking up product and never saw any
other distributors servicing territory); Ronchetti Dep. 33:16-34:2 (never personally observed
other distributors servicing territories and never visited other warehouses); English Dep. 19:2520:18 (sole purpose of visiting limited number of other warehouses was picking up product); Id.
43:21-44:18 (never witnessed other distributors in warehouse service their customers); Glavey
Dep. 118:17-120:12 (same); Riley Dep. 30:21-24 (never saw any postings in other warehouses).
Most importantly, despite the alleged “understanding” and “belief” set forth in their
cookie-cutter declarations, Plaintiffs uniformly admit they have no idea how many hours other
distributors—in their own and other warehouses—operate per week and, with limited exception,
have not seen their compensation records. See, e.g., Ronchetti Dep. 57:3-57:13 (no personal
knowledge of hours worked by other Jamestown distributors in Concord or other warehouses);
Riley Dep. 30:6-20, 39:25-40:2, 55:13-15 (same); Rehberg Dep. 43:5-44:13 (same).

F.

Plaintiffs Uniformly Admit They Have No Personal Knowledge About
Management Practices at Other Jamestown Warehouses or For Other Distributors
in Their Own Warehouse.

In addition, Plaintiffs uniformly admit that they have no personal knowledge regarding
management practices at other Jamestown warehouses or for other distributors at their own
warehouses. As opt-in English testified, “I know nothing about really what goes on at other
warehouses.” (English Dep. 80:11-14; accord, Rehberg Dep. 62:3-65:13, 71:9-15, 73:10-14 (no
personal knowledge of management’s interaction with Indian Trail distributors or management

ARGUMENT
Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows employees to seek

damages for alleged overtime and other wage/hour violations on behalf of themselves and others
“similarly situated.” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).

The decision whether to conditionally certify a

§ 216(b) collective action under the FLSA lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. See
Purdham v. Fairfax Cnty. Pub. Sch., 629 F. Supp. 2d 544, 548 (E.D. Va. 2009). Contrary to
what Plaintiffs imply in their Motion, conditional certification or notice is not automatic or
perfunctory. Rather, the court cannot facilitate notice unless “[t]he facts and the circumstances
of the case illustrate” that a class of aggrieved individuals who are actually “similarly situated”
does exist. Id. at 547 (citing Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U.S. 165, 170 (1989)). And,
the power to authorize notice must be used “only in appropriate cases.” Haynes v. Singer Co.,
696 F.2d 884, 886 (11th Cir. 1983) (quoting Hoffman-LaRoche, 493 U.S. at 170).

Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing a “reasonable basis” for their claim that other
individuals are in fact similarly situated to them. MacGregor v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2012 WL
2974679, at *2 (D.S.C. Jul. 20, 2012); Haynes, 696 F.2d at 887 (plaintiffs must establish a
“reasonable basis for crediting their assertions that aggrieved individuals exist in the broad class
that they proposed.”). To meet this burden, Plaintiffs must come forward with sufficient factual
evidence of a “common policy or plan that violated the law.” Ruffin v. Entm’t of the E.
Panhandle, 2012 WL 761659, at *4 (N.D. W.Va. Mar. 7, 2012) (quoting Choimbol v. Fairfield
Resorts, Inc., 475 F. Supp. 2d 557, 563 (E.D. Va. 2006)) (emphasis added). This requires more
than conclusory assertions with “meager factual support.” Bouthner v. Cleveland Constr., Inc.,
2012 WL 738578, at *4 ( D.Md. Mar. 5, 2012) (quoting D’Anna, 903 F. Supp. at 893)). Merely
submitting conclusory declarations from the named Plaintiffs alone is not sufficient. Brown v.
White’s Ferry, Inc., 2011 WL 5151394, at *2 (D. Md. Oct. 27, 2011) (plaintiffs’ own conclusory
declarations not sufficient for conditional certification); accord cases cited infra Section III(C).
When, as here, “sufficient evidence in the record at the initial ‘notice’ stage makes it clear that
notice is not appropriate, . . . a court can . . . deny certification outright.” Bouthner, 2012 WL
738578, at *4 (quoting Purdham, 629 F. Supp. 2d at 547).
As discussed below, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied because: (1) they have not
shown that all Jamestown distributors are uniformly subject to an unlawful policy or plan; (2)
their claims require highly-individualized factual inquiries that cannot be adjudicated collectively
without individualized hearings distributor-by-distributor; and (3) they have not shown that they
are similarly situated to each other—let alone some 230 other Jamestown distributors they seek
to represent.

A.

Plaintiffs Have Not Established the Existence of a Common Unlawful Policy or
Plan.

Plaintiffs’ Motion must first be denied because they uniformly admit they and other
Jamestown distributors are not, in fact, subject to any common policy, let alone an unlawful
policy, that would somehow render them employees. See testimony in Exhibit D and discussion
infra Section II(D).13
Further, despite their contentions, mere treatment as independent contractor is not
sufficient to justify conditional certification. Bouthner v. Cleveland Constr., Inc., 2012 WL
738578, at * 5 (D. Md. Mar. 5, 2012) (plaintiffs’ argument that defendants employed a “common
policy or scheme … [of] systematically misclassifying employees as independent contractors” is
not sufficient to warrant conditional certification); Slavinski v. Columbia Ass’n, Inc., 2011 WL
2119231, at *2 (D. Md. May 27, 2011) (denying conditional certification and holding that
“plaintiff's assertion that merely alleging an employer potentially misclassified employees [as
independent contractors] is sufficient to warrant conditional certification is an incorrect
statement of the law”); Bamgbose v. Delta-T Grp., Inc., 684 F. Supp. 2d 660, 669 (E.D. Pa.
2010) (“[e]valuation of whether [putative collective action members] are employees or
independent contractors … would not be possible on a collective basis because it would require
the Court to examine [their] distinct relationships with [defendant] and its various clients”).14
Plaintiffs repeatedly discuss unidentified “sales contracts” with national accounts, which
they contend “control every aspect of their jobs.” But this, too, fails. They uniformly admit at
13

See Holt v. Rite Aid Corp., 333 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1271 (“[T]his case is not a case where janitors are being
classified as exempt. As such, similarly situated inquiry requires examination of day-to-day tasks and conditional
certification [is] inappropriate.”).
14
Similarly, that Plaintiffs held the same “job title” and were all classified as exempt is likewise insufficient.
See 29 C.F.R. § 541.2 (“A job title alone is insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee.”); Grace v.
Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 2007 WL 2669699, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 6, 2007) (mere allegation of uniform
treatment as exempt insufficient to support conditional certification); Palacios v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharms.,
Inc., 2011 WL 6794438, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2011) (“as [d]efendant correctly points out, a defendant's policy
and practice of classifying a group of employees as exempt is not a basis for proceeding collectively.”).

Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 15 of 28

deposition that they have never seen any such contracts and have no personal knowledge
whatsoever of any negotiations between Flowers Foods, Flowers/Jamestown, and any such
customers. See, e.g., Ronchetti Dep. 83:1-16 (has no personal knowledge of any contracts or
negotiations between Flowers Foods or Flowers/Jamestown and any customers); Rehberg Dep.
104:13-106:21 (same); Riley Dep. 78:6-23 (never saw any contracts between Flowers Foods,
Flowers Jamestown or any of his customers and doesn’t know who sets rack space or approves
displays).

What is more, Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge that customer-imposed control is

irrelevant to whether they are independent contractors. See, e.g., FedEx Home Delivery v.
N.L.R.B., 563 F.3d 492, 501 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing C.C. Eastern, Inc., v. NLRB, 60 F.3d 855,
859 (D.C. Cir. 1995)) (“[C]onstraints imposed by customer demands and government regulations
do not determine the employment relationship.” ); Scruggs v. Skylink Ltd., 2011 WL 6026152, at
*3 (S.D. W.Va. Dec. 2, 2011) (requiring some compliance with certain specifications for a
customer “is entirely consistent with the standard role of a contractor who is hired to perform
highly technical duties”).
Moreover, the remaining factors Plaintiffs cite do nothing further to support their Motion.
Specifically, they assert that: (1) all Jamestown distributors sign a contract that outlines their
“compensation and job performance expectations” and are required use a handheld computer, (2)
“Flowers” can “terminate [their] contract[s]” if they do not meet the stated expectations, and (3)
Flowers controls prices of products. Even if Plaintiffs had supported these assertions with
factual evidence (they have not), these factors are also legally and factually inapposite. See
FedEx Home Delivery, 563 F.3d at 496-97 (citing North Am. Van Lines, Inc. v. NLRB, 869 F.2d
596, 599 (D.C. Cir. 1989)) (“‘[E]fforts to monitor, evaluate, and improve’ a worker’s
performance were deemed compatible with independent contractor status.”); Freund v. Hi-Tech

Satellite, Inc., 185 F. App’x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing Chao v. Mid-Atl. Installation
Servs., Inc., 16 F. App’x 104, 107 (4th Cir. 2001)) (upholding independent-contractor status and
finding “although the installers did not set the prices, the installers were ‘no less in control of
their net profits as a result of these variables than typical independent contractors.’”).15
The remaining factors Plaintiffs cite are equally unsupported by any record evidence
whatsoever16 and are directly contradicted by their own deposition testimony. For example, they
assert that “Defendants set the delivery schedule” and provide a “predetermined route,” (Pls.’
Brief 6, 15), but their testimony shows otherwise.

Rehberg Dep. 77:6-21, 78:24-79:24

(individual distributors determine what hours they work—they don’t receive any schedule from
company); Ronchetti Dep. 40:24-41:26 (he determines sequence in which he services his
customers by customer-service windows) and 42:18-43:1 (his decision to determine appropriate
delivery sequence); Riley Dep. 41:2-11 (he and “the product” determine schedule—no manager
tells him when to work). Likewise, they claim that “Defendants select the quantity and type of
products that Distributors deliver,” (Pls.’ Brief 15), but testify to the contrary. Riley Dep.
128:12-129:24 and Ex. 5 (admitting he determines what products to order his customers and
regularly makes adjustments to suggested order); Ronchetti Dep. 91:8-15, 107:4-109:5 (his
decision to make adjustments to suggested order and admitting “probably all” distributors adjust
their suggested orders based on sales history because the “suggested order does not work”).17

15

Plaintiffs also argue that all distributors are paid on a “piece rate” basis. Even if true (it is not), this, too, fails
because it pre-supposes an employment relationship exists. It does not. Further, payment on a “piece rate” basis is
not per se unlawful. See Section 14(c), FLSA (payment on piece rate basis).
16
See Pls.’ Brief 7-15, containing no citations to factual evidence, and ¶¶ 1-7, 9 of Pls.’ Declarations, which do not
extend beyond own individual circumstances.
17
Compare “Defendants mandate that Distributors load their trucks in a certain way” (Pls.’ Brief 15) with Rehberg
Dep. 84:6-11 (admitting he is “pretty much allowed to load the truck however [he] feel[s]”); English Dep. 73:2575:5 (same); and compare “Defendants reserve the right to—and regularly do—change orders placed by
Distributors” (Pls.’ Brief 6) with Ronchetti Dep. 97:1-19 (management in Concord has not made any changes to his
orders in the past year).

B.

Resolving Plaintiffs’ Claims Requires Highly Individualized Inquiries That
Cannot Be Adjudicated Collectively.

Even though Plaintiffs’ repeated admissions about the lack of any common unlawful
policies provide more than sufficient grounds to deny their Motion, the substantial individualized
inquiries involved in adjudicating their claims serves as yet another reason why collective action
treatment is inappropriate.
1.

Plaintiffs’ Claims Necessarily Implicate Individualized Practices.

In the absence of any common unlawful policy, Plaintiffs’ argument necessarily centers
on their contention that as a matter of fact, rather than formal policy, they are performing nonexempt duties. Thus, the inquiry regarding whether Plaintiffs and other distributors are exempt
and “similarly situated” turns on individualized inquiries about what each putative class member
does on a daily basis and the extent to which the individualized facts and circumstances weigh in
favor of—or against—independent-contractor status for each distributor, again, using the sixfactor, economic-realities test outlined above.
Specifically, to determine whether each distributor is properly treated as an independent
contractor, the Court would have to determine whether, to what extent, and over what time
period each individual, given his individual warehouse, individual sales manager, individualized
accounts, and other particularized circumstances:
•

was subject to control over the manner, method and means of performance;

•

took advantage of the various entrepreneurial opportunities available, such as
incorporation, hiring a helper, buying or selling portions of territory, soliciting
new accounts, and the like;

•

realized the opportunity for profit or loss through his individualized sales efforts,
accounts opening or closing in his defined territory, and the like;

•

had a substantial investment in the business; and

18
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 18 of 28

•

worked elsewhere, operated additional businesses, or sold non-competive
products, among others.

Assuming all such factors for each distributor did in fact weigh in favor of employee
status (they do not), the Court would then need to determine whether each distributor was
otherwise exempt from overtime pay under the motor-carrier or outside-sales exemptions. This
would require the Court to assess whether, to what extent, and over what time period, each
individual Plaintiff and opt-in:
For the motor-carrier exemption: 18
•

drove a vehicle with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of at least 10,001
pounds or whether his vehicle, with product, weighed at least 10,001 pounds—
proof of which must be offered at least once every four months per individual19;

•

drove—or was subject to driving— across state lines;

•

ordered products for customers that were produced out-of-state;

•

ordered products that remained in the “practical continuity” of interstate
commerce (i.e., they did not remain in the warehouse for long periods of time
after being ordered);

•

used trays and packaging for products delivered that traveled in “interstate
commerce;” and

•

was subject to delivering products or using trays in interstate commerce.

18

To establish applicability of the FLSA’s “motor carrier exemption” (MCA) (29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(1)), Defendants
must prove inter alia that “[the Distributor’s] employment duties involved the safety of operation of motor vehicles
weighing at least 10,001 pounds in interstate commerce.” Buckner v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 2012 WL 1596726,
at *4 (E.D.N.C. May 7, 2012). An individual who drives a wholly intrastate route can be nonetheless exempt under
the MCA exemption if the goods they deliver remain in the “‘practical continuity of movement’ between the
interstate segment and the overall interstate flow.” Walters v. Am. Coach Lines of Miami, Inc., 575 F.3d 1221, 1226
(11th Cir. 2009). Further, the MCA is applicable if the packaging and trays used flow in interstate commerce, even
if the individual delivering them doesn’t cross state lines. Talton v. I.H. Caffey Distrib. Co., Inc., 124 F. App’x. 760,
764-66 (4th Cir. 2005) (per curiam).
19
An individual is subject to the Secretary’s jurisdiction under the MCA for a four-month period, beginning with
the date the individual was called upon, or could have been called upon, to drive in interstate commerce. See
Badgett v. Rent-Way, Inc., 350 F. Supp. 2d 642, 657 (W.D. Pa. 2004) (quoting FOH § 24e01(b) (May 13,1982)).

19
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 19 of 28

For the outside-sales exemption:
•

had a “primary duty” of “making sales” or obtaining orders using the nine subfactors set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 541.504(b); see Archer v. Freedmont Mortg.
Corp., 2012 WL 5193828, at *3 (D. Md. Oct. 18, 2012) (citing same).

•

consummated his own sales and performed other activities that were “incidental
to and in conjunction with” his own sales; and

•

spent the majority of time outside of the office.

By Plaintiffs’ own admissions, these factors can—and do—vary from distributor to
distributor and over time. E.g., Riley Dep. 97:6-99:6 (discussing the 4 different vehicles he uses,
at his discretion and on different days, to service distributorship), 124:7-17 (discussing how
orders for Tasty products, which are produced out-of-state, vary from month to month); accord
testimony discussed supra Section II(C) (noting differences in sales efforts between Plaintiffs).
As courts have found, each of these sets of highly-individualized factual inquiries— all of which
are necessary to resolve independent-contractor and exempt status— is alone sufficient to deny
conditional certification:
•

Individualized inquiries in independent contractor analysis is inappropriate
for collective action treatment: E.g., Bouthner, 2012 WL 738578, at *7 (“to
determine the economic reality of the employment relationship between the
[d]efendants and the [plaintiff independent contractors], individualized questions
would necessarily predominate …”); Demauro v. Limo, Inc., 2011 WL 9191, at
*4 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 3, 2011) (conditional certification denied where “each
individual who may seek to join this case will be examined separately in order to
determine whether such individual is an employee or an independent contractor,”
which is a “necessarily individualized assessment [‘that’] eviscerates all notions
of judicial economy that would otherwise be served by conditional class
certification”); In re Fed Ex Ground Package Sys., Inc. Emp. Practices Litig., 662
F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1083 (N.D. Ind. 2009) (“lack of substantial similarity among
the putative class members” precluded conditional certification even where all
putative class members were bound by the same independent contractor operating
agreement).20

20

Accord, Andel v. Patterson Uti-Drilling, LLC, 280 F.R.D. 287 (S.D. Tex. 15, 2012) (conditional certification
denied because individualized inquiries involved in independent contractor analysis would “eliminate ‘the economy
of scale envisioned by the FLSA.’”); Sherman v. Am. Eagle, 2012 WL 248400 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2012)
(individualized inquiries involved in independent contractor analysis rendered conditional cert inappropriate);
Pfaahler v. Consultants for Architects, Inc., 2000 WL 198888, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 8, 2000) (same).

20
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 20 of 28

•

Motor-carrier exemption: E.g., See Gregory v. FedEx Ground Package System,
Inc., 2012 WL 2396873, at *13 (E.D. Va. May 9, 2012) (“[p]roving the [Motor
Carrier Act] exemption will require [defendant] to put on evidence of the dates
individual plaintiffs drove for [defendant] and the weights of the trucks they
operated,” thus warranting severing joint claims); Williams v. Md. Office
Relocators, 485 F. Supp. 2d 616, 619 (D. Md. 2007) (“the question of whether a
particular employee is a ‘loader’ [and thus falls within the Motor Carrier Act
exemption] requires an individualized determination into the actual work
performed by that employee”) (quotations in original); Bishop v. Petro-Chemical
Transp., LLC, 582 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1303 (E.D. Cal. 2008) (denying conditional
certification based on individualized inquires as to motor carrier exemption);

•

Outside-sales exemption: E.g., Evancho v. Sanofi-Aventis U.S. Inc., 2007 WL
4546100, at *4 (D.N.J. Dec. 19, 2007) (denying conditional certification due to
individualized inquiries associated with the outside sales exemption); Clausman v.
Nortel Networks, Inc., 2003 WL 21314065, at *4 (S.D. Ind. May 1, 2003)
(whether employees can be classified as an “outside salesman” would require
individualized determination).

Because these individualized inquiries simply “defeat the point of a collective action”
(Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 2007 WL 2669699, at * 2-3), Plaintiffs’ Motion must be denied.
2.

Courts Can—and Should—Consider These Required Individualized
Inquiries, Even at the Notice Stage, As Matter of Sound Case
Management.

Plaintiffs attempt to downplay the significance of these inherently individualized
inquiries by arguing that considering these inquiries is inappropriate at the notice stage. They are
wrong. Courts in this Circuit have repeatedly acknowledged the propriety of examining the
nature and extent of the individualized inquiries involved based on the evidence before them—
and thus the manageability of adjudicating the claims collectively—as a matter of sound case
management before determining whether notice is appropriate.

E.g., Bouthner, 2012 WL

738578, at *4 (“As a matter of sound case management, a court should, before offering [to assist
plaintiffs in locating additional plaintiffs], make a preliminary inquiry as to whether a
manageable case exists…”) (quotations omitted); Syrja v. Westat, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d 682, 689
(D. Md. 2010) (“[u]ltimately, the significance of manageability concerns at the notice stage is,

21
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 21 of 28

like other aspects of the conditional certification analysis, a decision for the Court on the facts
before it.”) This inquiry is necessary not only because “courts, as well as practicing attorneys,
have a responsibility to avoid ‘stirring up’ of litigation through unwarranted solicitation,”
D'Anna v. M/A–COM, Inc., 903 F. Supp. 889, 894 (D. Md. 1995), but courts must also manage
and resolve all claims that are certified for collective treatment.
When, as here, factual differences and individualized issues predominate, even among
these few deponents, courts have easily concluded that conditional certification and notice are
inappropriate. E.g., Bouthner, 2012 WL 738578, at *6 (denying collective action status as
unmanageable given factual differences of plaintiffs because “individualized factual and legal
issues” would predominate); Pelczynski v. Orange Lake Country Club, Inc, 284 F.R.D. 364, 369
(D.S.C. 2012) (denying conditional certification of timeshare salesmen’s FLSA collective action
due to manageability concerns, including the court’s determination that the case would require
individualized assessments of each salesman’s work activities).

Further, the fairness and

procedural considerations in play provide perhaps the most compelling reason to deny
conditional certification. Indeed, it is unfair both to Defendants and to Plaintiffs to attempt to
resolve such factually divergent claims collectively in one action.

See id. (fairness and

procedural considerations relevant to conditional certification at first stage). Here, Plaintiffs ask
this Court to send notice to their broad class based on nothing more than pages of argument
noticeably lacking in any citation to record factual evidence and to several conclusory
assertions—all of which their deposition testimony confirms are not true or are not based on any
personal knowledge whatsoever. Defendants have already had to spend significant time and
expense in responding to this patently deficient Motion. Neither the Court nor Defendants should
be saddled with the economic and administrative burden of continuing to adjudicate and defend

22
Case 3:12-cv-00596-MOC-DSC Document 32 Filed 01/04/13 Page 22 of 28

against a case that was filed without any competent factual basis for pursuing a collective or
representative action. D’Anna, 903 F. Supp. at 893-94 (“[a]n employer should not be unduly
burdened by a frivolous fishing expedition conducted by plaintiff at the employer’s expense.”)21
For this reason, among the many others discussed above, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied.
C.

Plaintiffs’ Motion Should Be Denied Because They Have Not Established That
They Are Similarly Situated to Each Other—Let Alone Distributors At All Other
Jamestown Warehouses.

Finally, Plaintiffs’ deposition testimony establishes that they are not similarly situated to
each other—let alone to the distributors at the 24 other warehouses who they seek to represent.
In fact, they do not even seek the same relief in this lawsuit. See supra Sections II(A), (C). Even
if the Court were to consider only the face of Plaintiffs’ Motion and their supporting declarations
in adjudicating this Motion, the result can be no different. The only “evidence” Plaintiffs offer is
their three cookie-cutter declarations, based exclusively on their own conclusory assertions—the
majority of which do not even extend beyond their own personal circumstances—and pages of
unsupported argument. Indeed, only 3 paragraphs of their entire 11-paragraph declarations even
attempt to discuss alleged policies and procedures applicable to other Jamestown distributors.
None offers any basis of personal knowledge to support the same. (E.g., Decls. of Riley,
Ronchetti & Rehberg ¶¶ 8, 10-11.)
Further, Plaintiffs’ declarations fail to provide competent evidence of even the most basic
assumption necessary to support their lawsuit: that other distributors actually worked overtime
and were unlawfully denied compensation. Plaintiffs’ conclusory statements in their declarations
based on “understanding” and “belief” are insufficient to carry their burden. See Bernard v.
21

What is more, despite their admitted solicitation efforts, Plaintiffs have only been able to find six individuals who
wish to opt-in— just 2% of the distributors in the Jamestown district. (Rehberg Dep. 52:2-56:13.) This, too,
supports denying Plaintiffs’ Motion. See Pelczynski., 284 F.R.D. at 368 (denying conditional certification and notice
where there was no evidence that other individuals wanted to join the action: “[E]vidence that other similarly
situated individuals desire to opt in to the litigation is … required.”) (citing Purdham, 629 F. Supp. 2d at 548).

D.

Even if the Court Were to Find that Plaintiffs Notice is Appropriate, It Should Be
Limited to the Three Warehouses Where Plaintiffs Work.

If the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are entitled to some sort of notice, which Defendants
deny and Plaintiffs’ own evidence fails to support, conditional certification and the facilitation of
notice must, at a minimum, be limited to only those distributors who operate out of the same
three warehouses as Plaintiffs: Rock Hill, Concord, and Indian Trail. District courts in this
Circuit routinely limit the scope of notice where, as here, plaintiffs fail to offer evidence that
individuals at other facilities were similarly affected by the same allegedly unlawful policy or
plan attributed to the defendant. E.g., Mitchel v. Crosby Corp., 2012 WL 4005535, at **1, 3-4
(D. Md. Sept. 10, 2012) (limiting conditional certification to employees who worked out of one
facility; only plaintiffs offered no evidence of allegedly unlawful policies affecting underwriters
at any facility other than their own); accord McLaurin v. Prestage Foods, 271 F.R.D. 465
(E.D.N.C. 2010) (narrowing scope of notice); Faust v. Comcast Cable Commc’ns. Mgmt., LLC.,
2011 WL 5244421, at *4 (D. Md. Nov. 1, 2011) (limiting notice to call center where Plaintiffs
and opt-in worked because they “failed to provide any concrete evidence demonstrating that
CAEs in other call centers are similarly situated”); Camper v. Home Quality Mgmt. Inc., 200
F.R.D. 516, 517, 519 (D. Md. 2000) (notice to the potential class was warranted for only the one
facility where plaintiffs made factual showing of unlawful policy). Assuming this Court finds
some notice is proper it should be similarly limited.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For all of the reasons set forth above, conditional certification and notice of Plaintiffs’

broad class is improper. Plaintiffs’ Motion for conditional certification and notice should be
denied entirely with prejudice.
