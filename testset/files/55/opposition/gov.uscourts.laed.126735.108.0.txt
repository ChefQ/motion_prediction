JACKSON HEWITT TAX SERVICE INC.’S AND JACKSON HEWITT INC.’S
MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF VICKI L. PINERO’S EX PARTE
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A REPLY TO DOCUMENT NO. 105
At the April 1, 2009 hearing before this Court on Plaintiff’s Rule 15(a) Motion
(“Motion”), Plaintiff, for the first time, requested leave to file supplemental briefing on the issue
of what appropriate peremptive or prescriptive period applied to her proposed new Count 10,
entitled “Violation of LA Loan Broker Statute.” In response, this Court’s Honor’s April 2, 2009
minute order directed that Plaintiff file a supplemental brief on that narrow issue by April 6,
2009. See Docket Entry No. 98. Your Honor also directed that Jackson Hewitt file its reply to
this memorandum by April 8, 2008, and ordered that the Motion would then be deemed fully
submitted on that day. Id. Plaintiff’s latest ex parte filing, on April 9, 2009, after the Motion
already had been fully submitted per this Court’s order, merely continues Plaintiff’s pattern of
disregard for this Court’s directives.1 Jackson Hewitt is therefore constrained to file an
opposition to her ex parte request.

Amend Document No. 77, Docket Entry No. 104 (discussing Plaintiff’s non-compliance with the
Court’s Orders).

Plaintiff now seeks leave to file a five-page reply to Jackson Hewitt’s supplemental
memorandum, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiff has already filed the following in support of
her Rule 15(a) Motion:
1) a 12-page initial memorandum;
2) a 17-page reply memorandum; and
3) a 14-page supplemental memorandum.
Jackson Hewitt respectfully requests that this Court deny Plaintiff’s ex parte request.
Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to be heard on this point, and this ex parte filing, after the
Motion has been fully submitted, is merely the latest in a string of attempts to present arguments
and filings to this Court in a manner that denies Jackson Hewitt a full, fair, and reasonable
opportunity to be heard.2 The Court should therefore disregard and strike Plaintiff’s reply to
Jackson Hewitt’s supplemental memorandum.

As a practical matter, Plaintiff’s reply memorandum is a red herring. Plaintiff cannot dispute
that “delictual actions” remain subject to a prescriptive period of one year under Louisiana Civil
Code Article 3492, nor that the distinction between delictual actions, or “quasi-offense” actions,
and contractual, or “quasi-contractual actions”, has long been a part of Louisiana’s jurisprudence
and remains so today, as indicated by cases well beyond 1995 using the same analysis. See, e.g.,
Dela Vergne v. Dela Vergne, 745 So.2d 1271, 1275 (La. Ct. App. 1999) (citing to Aetna Life and
Cas. Co. v. Dotson, 346 So.2d 762 (La. Ct. App. 1977), and holding that “if a cause of action is
considered to be a delictual action, i.e., an ‘offense’ or tort, under LSA-C.C. art. 3492 it cannot
also be considered an LSA-C.C. art. 3499 personal action because LSA-C.C. art. 3499 does not
apply where the legislature has provided another prescriptive period.”) Indeed, Plaintiff’s own
repeated citation to older case law, including cases from as far back as 1848, demonstrates that
Plaintiff does not, in fact, contend that the standard for what qualifies as delictual somehow
changed in 1995, despite the fact that the language of Article 3492 did not. See, e.g., Plaintiff’s
Supplemental Memorandum in Support of the Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended
Complaint at 5-9. Accordingly, the analysis of whether a claim is ex delicto or ex contractu
remains the same under Louisiana Law today as it was prior to 1995.
