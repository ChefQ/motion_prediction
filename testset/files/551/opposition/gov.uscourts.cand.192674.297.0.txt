INTRODUCTION
In its motion seeking leave to file a motion for reconsideration, AB posits a new “one-

2
3

part” test for claim vitiation that finds even less support in the law than its previously proposed

4

three-part test.1 AB’s motion seeking reconsideration is based solely on its misinterpretation of

5

the Federal Circuit’s Carnegie-Mellon decision.2 Contrary to AB’s arguments, Carnegie-Mellon

6

did not “resolve[] any ambiguity”3 in the law concerning claim vitiation; it merely applied

7

existing law to a very specific set of facts. Because Carnegie Mellon did not change the law

8

concerning claim vitiation (and because there has been no further development of the record since

9

the Court denied AB’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement), AB cannot satisfy

10

the requirements of Civil Local Rule 7-9(b)(1) or (2), and its motion seeking reconsideration must

11

therefore be denied.

12

II.

ARGUMENT

13

A.

To justify reconsideration, AB had to show that Carnegie-Mellon changed the
law regarding claim vitiation

14

AB argues that Carnegie-Mellon constitutes grounds for reconsideration under Civil Local

15

Rule 7-9(b)(1) and (2).4 But under Civil Local Rule 7-9(b)(1), AB had to show that “a material

16

difference in . . . law exists from that which was presented to the Court before entry of the

17

interlocutory order” and “that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the party applying for

18
19
20
21
22
23
24

1

When AB moved for summary judgment of non-infringement of claim 1 of the ’119 patent, it
argued that a three-factor test for “vitiation” precluded a finding that AB’s phosphorothiolate
bond could be equivalent to the phosphoramidate bond recited in claim 1. See Docket No. 231 at
20-21. In its opposition, Solexa pointed out that the test for claim vitiation requires consideration
of the “totality of the circumstances,” and that even under AB’s proposed test, a finding of
equivalence would not vitiate the claim limitation. See Docket No. 213 at 20-25. In its order
denying AB’s motion, this Court agreed that Federal Circuit precedent requires consideration of
the “totality of the circumstances,” noted that “Federal Circuit decisions on this issue seem to
blow hot and cold, at least arguably” and held that the “specific record presented on summary
judgment here is too undeveloped to be confident on this issue.” Docket No. 231 at 20-21.

reconsideration did not know such . . .law at the time of the interlocutory order.” Similarly, under

2

Civil Local Rule 7-9(b)(2), AB had to show “a change of law occurring after the time of such

3

order.” As explained below, because Carnegie-Mellon did not create either a “material

4

difference” in law or a “change of law,” but merely applied existing law already considered by

5

this Court, AB has failed to satisfy its burden to justify reconsideration under either Local Rule 7-

6

9(b)(1) or (2).

7

B.

8

AB’s motion fails because Carnegie-Mellon did not, either expressly or by implication,

9

Carnegie-Mellon did not change the law regarding claim vitiation

change the law regarding claim vitiation, and certainly did not create the new bright-line rule

10

urged by AB. To the contrary, the Carnegie-Mellon panel expressly applied the “totality of the

11

circumstances” test set out in the Freedman Seating case.5
“In order for a subsequently issued circuit decision to justify reconsideration of a district

12
13

court ruling, the circuit decision must effect a ‘change of law.’”6 A subsequent appeals court

14

decision that merely restates or reapplies existing legal principles does not represent a “change of

15

law,” material or otherwise, that justifies reconsideration.7

16

Nor does a subsequent appeals court decision change the law by implication where the

17

decision is based on existing precedent. For example, in the recent Stanford v. Roche case, the

18

defendant sought leave to file a motion for reconsideration of a claim construction order, arguing

19

that an intervening Federal Circuit decision had “caused an intervening change in the law”

because the Federal Circuit found that “after-arising technology could be infringing.”8 Judge Patel

2

denied the motion, explaining that a subsequent decision does not provide “a change in

3

intervening law” when it reaches a decision based on a case already considered by the court.9

4

Similarly here, the panel in Carnegie-Mellon was not “changing the law” set out in Freedman

5

Seating, it was merely applying it.

6

Although the Carnegie-Mellon panel expressly applied the “totality of the circumstances”

7

test stated in Freedman Seating, AB asks the Court to reconsider its denial of AB’s motion based

8

on the unsubstantiated assertion that the Federal Circuit now permits district courts, under some

9

undefined conditions, to set aside the Freedman Seating test in favor of a bright-line rule that “the

10

claim language alone, without further factual development”10 precludes application of the

11

Doctrine of Equivalents. But as Solexa pointed out in its Reply in Support of its Motion for

12

Partial Summary Judgment of Infringement,11 the Federal Circuit has already expressly rejected

13

the bright-line rule urged by AB (that restrictive claim language alone precludes infringement

14

under the Doctrine of Equivalents).12

15

Nothing in Carnegie-Mellon, including the passages cited by AB, indicates that the

16

Federal Circuit panel contemplated the new bright-line rule urged by AB, much less adopted it.

17

Indeed, the Carnegie-Mellon panel could not have adopted this alleged new rule, to the extent that

18

it would overrule the Freedman Seating or Abraxis Bioscience cases, since Carnegie-Mellon was

not an en banc decision.13 There is simply no basis for AB’s assertion that Carnegie-Mellon

2

changed the law concerning claim vitiation, “materially” or otherwise.

3

C.

AB misinterprets the holding in Carnegie-Mellon

4

AB misinterprets the holding in Carnegie-Mellon because AB fails to take into account

5

the totality of the circumstances in that case. Contrary to AB’s assertions, the Federal Circuit did

6

not affirm Judge Illston’s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement “based on the choice

7

of claim language alone.”14

8

The claim at issue in Carnegie-Mellon related, in part, to DNA encoding a protein called

9

DNA polymerase. The key issue for the Doctrine of Equivalents analysis was whether the claim,

10

which recited that the “bacterial source [is] E. coli,” covered the defendant’s product, for which

11

the “bacterial source” was Thermus aquaticus (“Taq”), a different species.
Although the Federal Circuit agreed with Judge Illston that “a finding that Taq is an

12
13

equivalent of E. coli would [vitiate] the ‘bacterial source [is] E. coli’ claim limitation,” the

14

opinion as a whole shows that the Federal Circuit panel did not do so solely on the basis of the

15

claim language. To the contrary, the panel had already affirmed Judge Illston’s decision that the

16

patent’s broader claims to any “bacterial source” were invalid because the specification only

17

described DNA polymerase-encoding DNA from E. coli, i.e., the patent did not provide adequate

18

written descriptive support for any broader claims (which would cover Taq).15 That is not the case

19

here (indeed, AB said nothing about claim 1 of the ‘119 patent in the section of its Final

20
21
22
23

13

Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, 458 F.3d 1345, 1351 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (the Federal
Circuit can only overrule precedent through an en banc decision). Even if Carnegie-Mellon had
announced a “materially changed” all-elements rule, AB’s request for reconsideration would still
be unwarranted because the Supreme Court decisions cited by Solexa, such as Graver Tank &
Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605 (1950), and Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton
Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 17 (1997), would still be controlling.

Docket No. 286 at 5.

15

26
27

The Carnegie-Mellon decision repeatedly indicates that the claims were limited to an E. coli
source for the DNA polymerase. See Docket No. 287-2 at, e.g., 5 (“Throughout the specification,
the patents teach that the host bacterial strain that is used to achieve that objective is E. coli.”), 15
(“[T]he narrow specifications . . . patents only disclose the polA gene coding sequence from one
bacterial source, viz., E. coli.”), and 17 (“We agree with the district court that the narrow
disclosure of the E. coli polA gene . . . fails to adequately support the entire claimed genus . . . .”).

III.

CONCLUSION
AB has failed to show that the law regarding claim vitiation has materially changed since

4
5

this Court denied AB’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. Instead, AB has

6

simply pointed to a Federal Circuit decision that applied the existing law to reach a decision that

7

AB thinks is favorable, that is, a case in which the Federal Circuit “blows hot” regarding claim

8

vitiation. Because this falls far short of satisfying AB’s burden under Civil Local Rule 7-9(b)(1)

9

or (2), this Court should deny AB’s motion seeking leave to file a motion for reconsideration.
