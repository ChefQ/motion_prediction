TO ALL DEFENDANTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

3

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT, as soon as this matter may be heard by the Court,

4

Plaintiff Applied Biosystems Inc., by and through its counsel, will move and hereby does move,

5

pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-9, for leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the denial of its

6

motion for summary judgment of noninfringement as to claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,969,119 (the

7

“’119 patent”). AB respectfully requests that the Court also set a briefing schedule that will allow

8

for a decision on this issue before phase II of trial commences.

9

This motion is based on the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the

10

Declaration of Steven E. Comer in Support of AB’s Motion for Leave to File Motion for

11

Reconsideration of Summary Judgment of Noninfringement of ’119 Patent (“Comer Decl.”), and

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2

I.

3

Plaintiff Applied Biosystems Inc. (“AB”) respectfully requests that the Court reconsider,

4

prior to Phase II of trial, whether Defendants (“Illumina”) are barred from claiming infringement

5

of claim 1 of the ’119 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. The Court reserved judgment on

6

this issue because of ambiguities in the Federal Circuit’s decisions on claim vitiation and to wait

7

for a more developed record. Two weeks later, on September 8, 2008, the Federal Circuit issued

8

a decision in Carnegie Mellon University v. Hoffmann-La Roche that resolves any ambiguity and

9

establishes that the claim language alone bars Illumina from seeking infringement under the

10

INTRODUCTION

doctrine of equivalents:

11

We agree with Roche and the district court that a finding that Taq is
an equivalent of E. coli would essentially render the “bacterial
source [is] E. coli” claim limitation meaningless, and would thus
vitiate that limitation of the claims. Indeed, in drafting the claims,
the patentees specifically chose to limit claim 4 to a recombinant
plasmid where the bacterial source is E. coli. Appellants cannot
now argue that any bacterial source, including Taq, would infringe
that claim. Accordingly, summary judgment of noninfringement
was appropriate.

DISCUSSION
A.

Illumina’s Assertion of the Doctrine of Equivalents Should be
Reconsidered in Light of the Federal Circuit’s Recent Decision in
Carnegie Mellon.

Claim 1 of the ’119 patent is limited to a probe containing a “NH” (phosphoramidate)

22

linkage. (Comer MSJ Decl. Ex. B, Docket No. 212-3.) Illumina concedes that AB’s probes do

23

not literally infringe this claim because they contain a different linkage, called a

24

phosphorothiolate. (Illumina’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Docket No. 203, at 8.) AB filed

25

a motion for summary judgment that the probes used in its systems also do not infringe claim 1 of

26

the ’119 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. (AB’s July 17, 2008 motion for summary

27

judgment; Docket No. 207.) AB argued that Illumina is barred from seeking infringement under

28

the doctrine of equivalents because extending the claim to cover a phosphorothiolate would

1

vitiate the phosphoramidate limitation, and because it is undisputed that the phosphorothiolate

2

linkage is cleaved under different and preferable conditions than the claimed phosphoramidate

3

linkage.

4

The Court denied AB’s motion as to the ’119 patent. (Docket No. 232 at 20.) The Court

5

noted that the Federal Circuit decisions on the issue of vitiation “seem to blow hot and cold.” (Id.

6

(citing Sage Products, Inc. v. Devon Industries, Inc., 126 F.3d 1420 (Fed. Cir. 1997) and Ethicon

7

Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 149 F.3d 1309 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).) The Court further

8

noted that the totality of the circumstances must be considered, and the specific record presented

9

on summary judgment was “too undeveloped to be confident on this issue.” (Id.) Accordingly,

10

the Court denied summary judgment of noninfringement of claim 1 of the ’119 patent without

11

prejudice to a later motion in limine at trial.

12

Two weeks after the Court issued its Order, the Federal Circuit issued its decision in

13

Carnegie Mellon. This decision clarifies the law on claim vitiation and establishes that in a case

14

such as this, the issue can be decided based on the claim language alone, without further factual

15

development. It therefore supports reconsideration of whether Illumina is barred as a matter of

16

law from pursuing its infringement of claim 1 of the ’119 patent under the doctrine of equivalents.

17

This decision could not have been raised earlier because it was issued two weeks after the Court’s

18

August 22, 2008 Order. (Docket No. 232.) The decision therefore presents grounds for

19

reconsideration under Civil Local Rule 7-9(b)(1) and (2).1

fact or law exists from that which was presented to the Court before
entry of the interlocutory order for reconsideration is sought. The
party also must show that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the

the time of the interlocutory order; or
(2) The emergence of new material facts or a change of law
occurring after the time of such order; or
(3) A manifest failure by the Court to consider material facts or

before such interlocutory order.

The Federal Circuit in Carnegie Mellon Barred the Patentee from
Arguing that a Claim Limited to a Plasmid Derived from E. coli
Extends to a Plasmid Derived from Taq.

3

The Federal Circuit’s decision in Carnegie Mellon establishes that when the patentee

4

chooses to limit a claim to one specific species, he cannot argue under the doctrine of equivalents

5

that the claim extends to a different species.

6

The patents in Carnegie Mellon relate to taking a DNA sequence that encodes for the

7

production of DNA polymerase (an enzyme that assists in DNA replication) and making that

8

sequence into a plasmid (a ring of DNA) that is inserted into a host bacterium that then creates

9

copies of the DNA plasmid as it grows and divides. Claim 1 of the ’745 patent broadly claimed a

10

plasmid containing DNA that codes for polymerase where that DNA sequence is derived from

11

any bacterial source:

12
13
14
15

1. A recombinant plasmid containing a DNA coding sequence for
the expression of DNA polymerase activity, wherein said DNA
coding sequence is derived from a source that encodes a bacterial
DNA Polymerase, said source not containing an amber mutation
affecting expression of said DNA polymerase activity, such that
when said plasmid is transformed into a bacterial host system the
host system can grow and divide thereby replicating said plasmid.

16

Carnegie Mellon, slip op. at 22 (emphasis added by Federal Circuit). Claim 4 more narrowly

17

claimed a plasmid containing DNA that codes for polymerase where that DNA sequence is

18

derived from one specific bacterial source, E. coli:

19
20

4. The recombinant plasmid of claim 3 wherein the bacterial host
system and the bacterial source are each E. coli; and wherein the
Nick-translation activity includes polymerase and 5'-3' exonuclease
activities.

21
22

Id. (emphasis added by Federal Circuit). The accused product used a plasmid containing DNA

23

that codes for polymerase, but the DNA sequence was derived from a different bacterial source,

24

Thermus aquaticus (“Taq”).

25

The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the Honorable Susan

26

Illston) granted Roche’s motion for summary judgment that claims 1-3 (among other claims) are

27

invalid for lack of written description. Id. at 7-8. The Court also granted summary judgment of

28

noninfringement of claims 4-11 (among other claims) under the doctrine of equivalents. Id. at 8.

On appeal, Carnegie Mellon argued that “the substitution of Taq for E. coli was an insubstantial

2

and unimportant change that resulted in an infringing equivalent.” Id. at 23. Roche responded

3

that Carnegie Mellon’s infringement theory would vitiate the E. coli claim limitation, and that the

4

differences between Taq and E. coli are not insubstantial. Id.

5

The Federal Circuit reiterated that “the ‘all limitations rule’ restricts the doctrine of

6

equivalents by preventing its application when doing so would vitiate a claim limitation.” Id.

7

(citing Warner Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 17, 29 (1997)).2 It also

8

reiterated the rule that in determining whether a finding of infringement under the doctrine of

9

equivalents would vitiate a claim limitation, the court must consider “the totality of the

10

circumstances of each case and determine whether the alleged equivalent can be fairly

11

characterized as an insubstantial change from the claimed subject matter without rendering the

12

pertinent limitation meaningless.” Id. (citing Freedman Seating Co. v. Am. Seating Co., 420 F.3d

13

1350, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2005)).

14

But the Federal Circuit concluded, based on the choice of claim language alone, that the

15

claim limitation requiring that the DNA source be E. coli cannot be extended to a product in

16

which the DNA source is Taq. The court held that because the patentee specifically chose to limit

17

claim 4 to a recombinant plasmid where the bacterial source is E. coli it “cannot now argue that

18

any bacterial source, including Taq, would infringe that claim.” Specifically, the court held:

19

We agree with Roche and the district court that a finding that Taq is
an equivalent of E. coli would essentially render the “bacterial
source [is] E. coli” claim limitation meaningless, and would thus
vitiate that limitation of the claims. Indeed, in drafting the claims,
the patentees specifically chose to limit claim 4 to a recombinant
plasmid where the bacterial source is E. coli. Appellants cannot
now argue that any bacterial source, including Taq, would infringe
that claim. Accordingly, summary judgment of noninfringement
was appropriate.

Some Federal Circuit decisions call the “all limitations rule” the “all elements rule.”
See, e.g., Cooper Cameron Corp. v. Kvaerner Oilfield Prods., 291 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (Fed. Cir
2002) (noting that the “all elements rule” is “more preferably” called the “all limitations rule”).

Illumina is Barred from Arguing that a Claim Limited to a Probe
Containing a Phosphoramidate Linkage Extends to a Probe
Containing a Phosphorothiolate Linkage.

Macevicz similarly chose to limit claim 1 of the ’119 to a single linkage. The clarity and

3
4

deliberateness of that choice is established by the claims in his related, and earlier-issued ’341

5

patent.3 In claim 7 of the ’341 patent, Macevicz broadly claimed the use of a probe containing

6

any “chemically scissile internucleosidic linkage:”

7

7. The method of claim 2 wherein said step of regenerating
includes cleaving a chemically scissile internucleosidic linkage in
said extended oligonucleotide probe.

8
9

(’341 Patent, Comer MSJ Decl. Ex. A, Docket No. 212-2.) In claim 8 of the ’341 patent,

10

Macevicz expressly limited the claim to one specific chemically scissile internucleosidic linkage

11

— a phosphoramidate:

12

8. The method of claim 7 wherein said chemically scissile
internucleosidic linkage is a phosphoramidate.

13
14
15

(Id.)
Claims 7 and 8 prove indisputably that Macevicz used the term “chemically scissile

16

internucleosidic linkage” to claim an entire class of linkages, and expressly defined a

17

phosphoramidate linkage as one specific linkage within that class. Subsequently, in the later-

18

issued ’119 patent, he chose the latter, narrow limitation. He specifically chose to limit claim 1 to

19

a probe containing a phosphoramidate linkage, not the broader class of “chemically scissile

20

internucleosidic linkage” Illumina now seeks to cover through the doctrine of equivalents.

21

Illumina cannot now argue that any chemically scissile internucleosidic linkage, including

22

phosphorothiolate, would infringe that claim. As in Carnegie Mellon, a finding that a

23

phosphorothiolate linkage is the equivalent of a phosphoramidate linkage would essentially

The ’341 patent issued on May 12, 1998. (’341 Patent, Comer MSJ Decl. Ex. A, Docket
No. 212-2.) The ’119 patent did not issue until 17 months later, on October 19, 1999. (Id. Ex. B,
Docket No. 212-3.) Macevicz filed responses to office actions in the ’119 prosecution on
May 12, 1998 and November 3, 1998. (Comer MSJ Decl. Ex. G, Docket No. 212-8; Comer MSJ
Reply Decl. Ex. 3, Docket No. 226-4.)

render the phosphoramidate claim limitation meaningless, and would thus vitiate that limitation.

2

Accordingly, summary judgment of noninfringement is appropriate.

3
4

D.

Vitiation is Established by the Current Record.

Although AB’s phosphorothiolate linkage has significant advantages over Macevicz’s

5

phosphoramidate linkage (see AB’s Trial Brief Re: (1) AB Does Not Infringe The ’119 Patent

6

Under The Doctrine Of Equivalents As A Matter Of Law; (2) Equitable Defenses To

7

Infringement Counterclaims; Docket No. 272 at 1-14), summary judgment of noninfringement is

8

appropriate without considering those advantages. In Carnegie Mellon, the Federal Circuit noted

9

that although Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize for discovering the use of Taq DNA polymerase,

10

the advantages of Taq played no part in its decision. “While we reach our decision irrespective of

11

those facts, we readily can see why appellants have attempted to broaden the scope of their claims

12

beyond the E. coli species disclosed.” Carnegie Mellon, slip op. at 24 n.4. Thus, on the basis of

13

the claim language alone, AB is entitled to summary judgment.

14

III.

15

AB respectfully requests permission to file a motion for reconsideration of the denial of its

CONCLUSION

16

motion of summary judgment of noninfringement of claim 1 of the ’119 patent. AB further

17

requests that the Court set a briefing schedule that will allow for a decision before phase II of trial

18

commences.
