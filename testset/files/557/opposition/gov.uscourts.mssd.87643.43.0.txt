CITY’S MEMORANDUM BRIEF SUBMITTED IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND
FOR URGENT CONSIDERATION OF SAME
The City of Pearl, Mississippi (“Pearl” or “City”) submits this Memorandum Brief In
Opposition To the Motion Of the Plaintiffs for a Preliminary Injunction.
SUMMARY
There is no case or controversy concerning the Plaintiffs’ state law rights under the
Mississippi Constitution and the City’s Zoning Ordinance. The Mississippi Supreme Court has
declared these “sacred rights” under state zoning law and these issues of state zoning law
between Homewood and the City, at Homewood’s election, are currently on appeal in the state
court system. The Plaintiffs have not shown that the City is not in compliance with state zoning
law and these issues are already before the state courts which are fully entitled to handled them.
The Plaintiffs, without a single citation to controlling authority, are attempting to have
this Court create from whole cloth a sacred federal right to eternally maintain a trailer park where
no such federal right currently exists. At the same time the Plaintiffs demand, without a single
Page 1 of 9

citation to controlling —Mississippi or Federal— authority, this Court to go even further than the
state courts, and declare the Plaintiffs exempt from the non-zoning health and safety regulations
of the City.

The Plaintiffs cite no authority because there is no such authority and for good

reason. Since the days of Plessy v. Ferguson 163 U.S. 537 (1896) and Lochner v. New York,
198 U.S. 45 (1905), the federal courts have consistently moved away from the concepts of
natural law and the antebellum concept of “vested rights” towards a proper recognition of the
scope of the police power.
Having no valid claim under state or federal law, the Plaintiffs can not obtain an
injunctions. Arnold v Garlock Inc., 278 F.3d 426, 441 (5th Cir. 2001). Moreover the Plaintiffs
have not shown that they do not have an adequate remedy at law, namely their Section 1983
damage claim. DSC Communications Corp. v. Next Level Communications, 107 F.3d 322, 328
(5th Cir. 1997).

The claim that the trailer park owners will suffer “substantial harm” is

histrionics. The parks are there and functioning. The parks will not be harmed by being made
safer. The public has no interest is these parks being exempt for health and safety regulations.
The claims of discrimination against the poor or their housing is false. The poor are entitled to
safe and healthy housing.
FACTS
The City is not seeking to force the Plaintiffs out of business. This hysterical accusation
is simply not true. The City is not seeking to “enforce” any state law zoning provision against
the Plaintiffs.

The City has not previously required any plaintiff to remove any of their structures
(vinyl/aluminum sided factory constructed boxes) from their trailer parks and will only do so
through this judicial process.
However, one of the Plaintiffs has moved one box into its Grove Acres trailer park
without complying with the non-zoning ordinances of the City. This lawlessness compounds the
dangerous life threatening conditions at said trailer park. This lawlessness and the dangerous life
threatening conditions at said trailer park are highly prejudicial to the City and the Public.
The City is located in a tornado alley: FEMA Wind Zone IV (250 mph).

On April 28, 2014, between the hours of 6:27 p.m., and 7:15 p.m., an EF-3 Tornado with
speeds up to 156 mph ripped a 400 yard wide path for 30.1 miles in Hinds, Rankin and Scott
Counties. The tornado caused 1 death and at least 20 reported injuries. Numerous persons were
injured in Pearl due to the foreseeable failure of boxes used as homes exactly like the boxes used
as homes located in the the trailer parks owned and operated by the Plaintiffs.
As seen below, the April 2014 tornado extensively destroyed and damaged trailers in a
“park” in Pearl, Mississippi and numerous lives where at risk of serious harm and death due to
the trailer parks owned and operated by the Plaintiffs.

Dave Malkoff of The Weather Channel covered the aftermath of the storm. The Weather
Channel’s coverage in Pearl, Mississippi shows the extent of the devastation and the need for

shelters.

watch?v=MvMdQlhrtwU).
The City has enacted municipal code provisions (non-zoning) which require the Plaintiffs
to undertake steps to make their trailer parks safer. These provisions include installation of storm
shelters. The City has also notified the Plaintiffs that the present locations of their moveable
boxes presents an unreasonable and unnecessary risk of harm to the inhabitants of these parks,
the neighboring property owners and inhabitants and the City’s first responders and that these
dangers should be corrected.
These provisions of law are not part of the City’s Zoning Regulations. The City’s Zoning
Ordinance is not an issue in this case. Within days of the Mississippi Supreme Court decision in
the Governing Authorities of the City of Pearl, Mississippi, adopted a resolution directing the
Department of Community Development to comply with Cleveland MHC, LLC v. City of
Richland, 2013-CT-00286-SCT (May 14, 2015). For the time being this Mississippi Supreme
Court case has resolved the state law issue of whether a zoning ordinance can prohibit the
replacement of trailers in a “nonconforming” park. Homewood and Pearl are currently involved
in a state court lawsuit over this very zoning issue. Homewood elected to present its zoning law
dispute to state court and it need not be litigated here.
Moreover, Pearl is in full compliance with the mandates of Cleveland MHC, LLC v. City
of Richland, 2013-CT-00286-SCT (May 14, 2015) and all state court orders concerning state
law.
The September 3, 2015, Letter speaks for itself and is not an attempt to circumvent the
current state zoning laws in Mississippi. The September 3, 2015, letter states:
Page 5 of 9

On June 2, 2015, the Governing Authorities of the City of Pearl, Mississippi,
adopted a resolution directing the Department of Community Development to
comply with Cleveland MHC, LLC v. City of Richland, 2013-CT-00286-SCT
(May 14, 2015). It is the City’s position that the City’s 2009 Zoning Ordinance
does not prevent Homewood from the lawful continuation of the Grove Acres
property as a nonconforming use. The 2009 Zoning Ordinance does not require the
lot by lot attrition of the lawful continuation of the Grove Acres property as a
nonconforming use.
The 2009 Zoning Ordinance does not prohibit the
replacement of a manufactured home that is removed from the Grove Acres
property with another manufactured home. To be clear, the City will fully comply
with the recent decision of the Honorable Judge John H. Emfinger unless and until
such decision is reversed or modified in accordance with law.
All required inspections will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of
the Mississippi and Federal Constitutions. If inspections are not allowed freely
and voluntarily then the City will proceed as allowed by law. The City welcomes
Homewood's cooperation with inspections to avoid any unnecessary delays.
Homewood has not complied with the City’s Rental Housing Code, Property
Maintenance Code and Fire Prevention Code. The City’s Fire Chief has concluded
that the high density of structures as are currently located in the Grove Acre Trailer
Park pose an unreasonable risk of harm to the occupants of such structures and the
neighboring occupants and property, in and outside the "park," in the likely event
of a severe wind storm or tornado.
These failures to comply and dangerous
circumstances prevent the approval of the placement of any new residential
structures on Homewood’s properties despite the allowance of replacement by the
City’s Zoning Ordinance. In addition, as you are aware the Untied States District
Court for the Southern District of Mississippi has jurisdiction over the City’s
action to abate the nuisances and dangerous circumstances and illegal
circumstances which exist at Homewood’s properties. Pending the outcome of this
federal litigation, the Department of Community Development and City’s Fire
Marshall will not approve the placement of any manufactured home on
Homewood’s property absent those properties being brought into compliance with
those non-zoning codes and the premises being made safe, in fact.

The present litigation in this court is the only litigation between the Plaintiffs and the City
concerning the City’s Rental Housing Code and the dangerous conditions on the Plaintiffs’
property.

ARGUMENT
The Plaintiffs cite seven (7) “authorities” in support of their Motion:

Homewood Company, LLLC. v. City ofPearl, Mississippi, Rankin Circuit Court
Civil Action No. 20 13-252, appeal pending before Mississippi Appellate Courts,
2015-TS-01469;
Cleveland MHC, LLC v. City ofRichland, Mississippi, 163 So. 3d 284 (Miss.,
May 14, 2015);
Asbury, MS Gray-Daniels, L.L.C. v. Daniels, 812 F. Supp. 2d 771, 776 (S.D.
Miss. 2011);
U. S. v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633 (1953);
Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F. 2d I 197, 1205 (2d Cir. 1970);
Elrod v.Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976), and,
Battle v. Municipal Housing Authority for City of Yonkers, 53 F.R, D, 423 (S.D.
N.Y. 1971).
Not one of these cases even comes close to suggesting that the Plaintiffs are exempt from the
non-zoning police power regulations of the City directed at safety and quality of life.
The Circuit Court judgment between Homewood and Pearl did not involve the
enforcement of the City’s Rental Housing Code or the removal of dangerous conditions. The
State Circuit Judge in no way exempted Homewood and the other Plaintiffs from the safety and
quality of life ordinances of the City. Moreover this state court opinion is on appeal.
The Cleveland v. Richland case did not involve a municipal rental housing ordinance.
The Mississippi Supreme Court expressly stated it was dealing with the intersection of state
zoning laws with “sacred rights” under the Mississippi Constitution. 163 So. 3d at 288 (“The
Court of Appeals correctly noted that ‘[a] citizen's right to be protected in 'the lawful use of his
Page 7 of 9

property is one of the most sacred rights reserved to him under our Constitution.' Cleveland
MHC, 2014 WL 4067207, at *3 (¶ 14) (quoting Fitzhugh v. City of Jackson, 132 Miss. 585, 97
So. 190, 192 (1923))”) (emphasis added).1 Wisely, there is no federal constitutional “sacred
right” to eternally have a trailer park by removing old structures and adding new structures.
More importantly no where in Cleveland v. Richland does the Mississippi Supreme Court even
suggest that no laws can be enforced against trailer parks.
The remaining cases simply do not support the conclusion that the City should be
enjoined from enforcing its Rental Housing Ordinance and taking other governmental actions
concerning health and safety.
The City incorporates by reference the Memorandum it submitted in support of its
Motion for a preliminary injunction.
This the 13th Day of October, 2015.
Respectfully submitted,
City of Pearl, Mississippi

The Cleveland opinion is a confused “vested rights” decision. The antebellum concept of “vested rights” reached
its height with Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) and was universally rejected over the next century. One
need only read the 1925 case of Fitzhugh to see that Cleveland takes the state of Mississippi zoning law back to
before Euclid v. Amber Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926). Fortunately the Mississippi Supreme Court can not drag
federal law centuries backward.
