PLAINTIFFS' MEMORANDUM BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

COME NOW Plaintiffs, Homewood Company, L.L.C.; Lodes, Inc.; and Cary S. and
Dorothy B. Bierdernan Revocable Trust, by and through the undersigned counsel, and
submit this Memorandum Brief in Support of Their Motion for Preliminary Injunction,
FACTS
The Plaintiffs are owners and operators of Hye manufactured home parks located in
Pearl, Mississippi. Plaintiff Homewood owns and operates Grove Acres, which has been
continually operated as a manufactured home park within the City of Pearl, Mississippi, for

over 50 years and consists of approximately II acres. Grove Acres is divided into 101
individual lots. The Plaintiff Home wood also owns and operates Oak Lake, which has been

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 2 of 21

continually operated as a manufactured horne park within the City of Pearl, Mississippi, for
over 20 ycars and consists of approximately 23 acres. Oak Lake is divided into 85 lots.

Robinson Park and Ramona Park have been continually operated as manufactured
home parks within the City of Pearl, Mississippi, for approximately 40 years, since before

the City was incorporated. They are currently owned and operated by Lodes, Inc. Robinson
Park currently consists of 78 individual lots, while Ramona Park consists of eight individual

lots.
Ricrdeman Park has been continually operated as a mobile home park by the

Bierdeman family within the City of Pearl, Mississippi, for approximately 50 years.
Rierdeman Park consists of I29 individual lots located on approximately 48 acres.
In 2009, the City of Pearl, M ississippi, passed a Revised Zoning Ordinance ("the 2009

Ordinance"). Under the terms of the 2009 Ordinance, Grove Acres, Oak

Lake,

Robinson

Park, Ramona Park and Bierdeman Park are each a "nonconfonning use." Mississippi law

recognizes a nonconforming use as a vested property right of the property owner, which runs

with the land and is a well-established substantial right. At all times since Plaintiffs began
operating the aforementioned manufactured home parks, up until approximately 2010, the

City's practice was to routinely allow them to replace on the same lot any manufactured
home which was removed from a lot.

2

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 3 of 21

Beginning in approximately 2010, the City of Pearl refused to allow these

manufactured home parks to replace manufactured homes removed from lots, contending that
the removal of the manufactured home previously located on the lot eliminates the

nonconforming status of that individual lot.
Using its 2009 Zoning Ordinance, the City of Pearl successfully shut down two

manufactured home parks in the City. In 2013 the City of Pearl reported the following:
Since the 2009 [ sic] at least two (2) pre-existing "parks" have come into
53.
full compliance with the Zoning Ordinance. One of these "parks, " Shady

Grove Park, 2526 Old Brandon Road, located approximately 100 yards east of
the City Hall Complex and approximately 300 yards from Grove Acres,
involved the removal of approximately ten (10) nonconforming structures.
Shady Circle Park was located at 3717 Old Brandon Road (near Paul Truitt
church) and involved the removal of approximately ifty-six (56)
nonconforming structures. The results have met with universal approval and
gratitude, especially from the neighboring property owners. The park owners
begmdgingly complied with the restrictions, but ultimately complied.
(Exhibit

1,

City of Pearl Legislative Findings of Fact and Conclusions.)' There were notably

no safety issues cited for the removal of these two manufactured home parks.

Safety

concerns for the manufactured home park tenants were also not likely issues for the
neighboring property owners, who expressed their "universal approval and gratitude" at the

removal of the manufactured homes.

All exhibits referenced herein are attached to Plaintiffs' .Motion for Prdiminary
Injunction.

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 4 of 21

Plaintiffs, howcycr, have refitsed to allow Defendants to force them out of business.

In an appeal action filed by Homewood in the Circuit Court of Rankin County, Mississippi,

in Home wood Company, L..L.C. v. City ofPearl, Mississippi, Civil Action No. 20 13-252, the
Circuit Court (Judge Emfinger) considered whether the City of Pearl's denial in 2013 of a
permit to Homewood to replace a mobile home in its Grove Acres Park was a violation of
Homewood's constitutional right to enjoy its property. The court stayed consideration of this
m.atter until the Mississippi Supreme Court rendered its decision in Cleveland MHC, LLC v.
City ofRichland, Mississippi, et at, 163 So. 3d 284 (Miss., May 14, 2015). (Exhibit 2.) in
Cleveland, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that the City of Richland's interpretation
of its zoning ordinance to prohibit a property owner's lawlid continuation of the property's

nonconforming use deprived the property owner of his constitutional right to enioy his
property.

After the Mississippi Supreme Court rendered its decision in Cleveland, the Rankin
County Circuit Court issued an order which reversed the action taken by the Board of
Aldermen of the City of Pearl as to Homewood and stated the following:

Homewood owns a mobile-home park that has operated as a nonconforming
use for decades. Based upon the authority of the Cleveland ruling, any effort
by the City of Peari to on act, on force or interpret the 2009 ordinance to prevent
Homewood from the lawful continuation ofthe property's nonconforming use
is a violation of Homewood's constitutional right to enjoy its property. . . .
IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that, to the extent the action by the City
would prohibit the replacement of a manufactured home that is removed from
4

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 5 of 21

the park with another manufactured home, such action is hereby reversed. The
City may not enact, enforce and/ or interpret the 2009 ordinance so as to
prevent the lawlid continuation of a nonconforming use.
(Order to Reverse Action Taken by the Board of Aldermen of the City of Pearl, Mississippi,

Exhibit 3.)
On or about September

3, 2015,

the City of Pearl sent a letter to counsel for the

Plaintiffs herein re "Ilamewood Requests for in formation" and stated that as of June 2, 2015,
the City of Pearl had adopted a resolution directing the Department of Community

Development to comply with the holding in the Cleveland

v.

City

of Richland case and

would, therefore, recognize the Grove Acres Park's lawlid continuation of its manufactured
home park as a nonconforming use. However, the City of Pearl then, in an obvious attempt

to circumvent the rulings of the Mississippi Supreme Court and the Rankin County Circuit
Court stated that Homcwood had not complied with the City's Rental f lousing code,
Property Maintenance Code and Fire Prevention Code, and would not be allowed to replace

manufactured homes in the parks pending the outcome of the City's counterclaim in this
litigation. (City of Pearl correspondence, September

After September
a utilities

3,

3,

2015, Exhibit 4.)

2015, the City of Pearl, in reliance on its letter (Exhibit 4), denied

ermit to a re lacement mobile home in Grove Acres. The Cit of Pearl has never

issued a complaint or citation of a violation against any of the Plaintiffs or their
manufactured home parks for any reason whatsoever. To do so now, as Exhibit 4 indicates

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 6 of 21

the City will do "in the near future, " is a clear effort by Defendants to chart a new method
of depriving Plaintiffs of their rights to use their property as the properties have been used
in the City for over fifty years.

The fact that the Defendants

now,

after 50 years, retisse to allow a utilities permit to

a manufactured home based on an alleged violation that has not even been specified indicates
clearly that Defendants are engaged in purposeful discrimination against Plaintiffs in the City
of Pearl. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should issue an immediate preliminary

injunction against the Defendants that prevents them from discriminating against Plaintiffs
and protects the manufactured home parks' valuable right to use their property in the same

way that it has been used for over 50 years in the City of PearL
ARGUMENT

This Court has held that a preliminary injunction should issue if the Movant
establishes:

(1)

a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,

(2)

a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued,

(3)

that the threatened injury ifthe injunction is denied outweighs any harm

that will result if the injunction is granted, and
(4)

that the grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.

Asbury, MS Gray-Danie/s, L.L.C. v. Daniels, 812 F. Supp. 2d 771, 776 (S.D. Miss. 2011).

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 7 of 21

I. Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits
in Asbury, this Court described the evidence necessary to show "substantial likelihood
of success on the merits." This Court stated as follows:

[ P] laintiffs must provide evidence sufficient to support a prima facie case, but
the evidentiary standard is not as high as would be required to entitle them to
summary judgment.
Id. at 776. In this case, PI.a.intiffs are able to provide more than sufficient evidence to support
a prima facie case of substantial likelihood of success on the merits. First, Plaintiffs have
already proven in state court that the City of Pearl sought to use its 2009 Zoning Ordinance
to prevent the manufactured home parks from lawful continuation of their property as a
nonconforming use. After an opinion directly on point was handed down by the Mississippi
Supreme Court in Cleveland MHC, LLC v. City of Richland, M.5', et al., 163 So. 3d 284
(Miss., May 14, 2015) (Exhibit 2), the Circuit Court of Ra.nkin County, Mississippi, ruled

that the City of Pea.rl could not use its 2009 Zoning Ordinance to prevent one of the Plaintiffs
herein, Homewood, from the lawful continuation of its property's nonconforming use. The

Circuit Court specifically found that the City's actions were "a violation of Homewood's
constitutional right to enjoy its property." (Exhibit 3 at p. 5.)

The Mississippi Supreme Court case of Cleveland MHC is instructive here. In that
case, the Court held that "the nonconformity is the use

7

of the property as a mobilc-home

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 8 of 21

park, and that use has not been destroyed or changed." Cleveland MHC, 163 So. 3d at 288,

The Court went on to observe the following:

The mobile-home park had been in operation for more than fifty years, most
of that time subject to the zoning ordinance and operating as a nonconforming
use. For more than thirty years, the City did not errforce the nonconforming
use ordinance as to each pad on the property. For three years under the new
ownership, the City said nothing about the removal and replacement of mobile
homes on the property.
The Court of A.ppeals correctly noted that
"[ a] citizcn's right to be protected in 'the lawful use of his property is one of
the most sacred rights reserved to him under our Constitution.'"
Id. at 288. (Internal citations omitted.)

As in Cleveland

MHC,

the Plaintiffs' manufactured home parks have been in

operation for more than 50 ycars in the City of Pearl. Not until 2010 did the City attempt to
restrict the mobile home park owners' usage rights in their property, Just as

in.

Cleveland

MHC, the City of Pearl's "decision to do so now seems to be without reason and implies a

disregard for the surrounding facts and settled controlling principles." Id. at 289.
The Plaintiffs are also substantially likely to be able to show "purposeful
discrimination" on the part of the Defendants in their attempts to apply other recently enacted
city ordinances to these manufactured home parks. Recognizing that it would not be abic to
eradicate manufactured housing parks with use of the 2009 Zoning Ordinance, the City of

Pearl on or about June

27, 2013,

adopted a Rental Housing Code, which was published on

September 17, 2014, and by its terms applies to all rental housing units in the City of Pearl,
including manufactured homes.

The Rental
8

Housing Code includes requirements

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 9 of 21

inconsistent with the due process rights of Plaintiffs as nonconforming uses and intentionally
discriminates against them and against moderate and low income housing. Application of

the requirements of this Code to the poc-cxisting manufactured home parks of the Plaintiffs
is irrational, arbitrary and capricious, vague and ambiguous, and is designed to deprive the
Plaintiffs oftheir constitutional property rights in their pre-existing manufactured home parks
in the City.2

In its September 3, 2015, correspondence to counsel for Plaintiffs herein, the City of
Pearl recognized that constitutional law would not allow the City to prevent the manufactured

home parks from the lawful continuation of their property as a nonconforming use. (See
Exhibit 4.) But the City did not give up its efforts to rid itself of manufactured home parks

and stated in its letter that PlaintilT Homewood had not complied with the City's Rental
1-lousing Code, Property Maintenance Code and Fire Prevention Code and that it "hoped" to

have a list of violations completed "in the near future." In spite of the fact that Homewood's

manufactured home park, Grove Acrcs, has ncycr in its entire existence in the City of Pearl
been cited or Ened for a violation, the City of Pearl shortly after writing the letter on

September

2

3,

2015, denied access to utilities to a replacement home in the park because of

One example of the arbitrary and capricious application of the City's ordinances is
the requirement that manufactured home parks install storm shelters suficient to house all
residents of a park during a storm. Notably, the C-2 district, in which Plaintiff Grove Acres is
located, also permits the location of "hotels and motels." Presumably, a hotel is at lease as dense,
if not more so, than a manufactured home park or apartment building. Why require an apartment
building or manufactural home park to build a storm shelter, but not require the same of a hotel'?

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 10 of 21

alleged violations that have to date not been disclosed to Home wood. Upon information and
bcilcf, the City of Pearl had not even inspected that manufactured home at the time it denied

access to utilities.
The Defendants' reliance on unnamed code violations to deny access to utilities in the
manufactured home parks is strong evidence of their intent to attempt an

"end-rtm"

around

the rulings of the Mississippi Supreme Court an.d Rankin County Circuit Court. These five

(5) manufactured home parks have operated in the City of Pearl for over ifty years without
a single code violation. The Rental Housing Code, passed in 2013, includes Section.

12-232

which contains detailed provisions about notiHeation of violations, describing a "notice to
comply" and a ch.ance to correct. Not only has the City not cited Plaintiffs with a code
violation, but it has also ncycr issued a "notice to comply" to Plaintiffs,

The absence of

citations highlights the Defendants' pretextual reliance on safety concems in their efforts to
shut down Plaintiffs' businesses.
The City's September 3, 20 15, letter to Plaintiffs' counsel also indicates the pretextual

nature of its intent to apply a Rental Housing Code, Property Maintenance Code or Fire
Prevention Code to keep the parks from replacing manufactured homes,

In that letter, it

states that "[ t] he City's Fire Chief has concluded that the high density of structures as are
currently located in the Grove Acre Trailer Park pose an unreasonabic risk of harm to the

occupants of such structures and the neighboring occupants and property, in and outside the

10

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 11 of 21

park, '

in the likely event of a severe windstorm or tornado."

(Exhibit 4)

But these

manufactured home parks have been in existence in the City of Pearl for over 50 years, with
essentially the saine lot layouts. The City has never attempted to impose restrictions on their

use or lot design based on an alleged concern for the safety of the tenants in the parks.
Moreover, the City's conclusion that the "high density" of the mobile homes in the
park poses an unreasonable risk of harm and allows the City to refuse to allow replacement

of manufactured hornes in the park, and for access to utilitics, is clearly a violation of the
manufactured home parks' nonconforming-use status. Miss. Code Ann.

917-1-9

states that

zoning regulations are designed to "secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to
provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration of population; to facilitate the adcquate provision of transportation, water,
sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements." (Emphasis added.) The City of

Pearl cited Miss. Code Ann.

(17-1-9

when it itupletnented its 2009 Zoning Ordinance, and

also stated in Section 101 of the 2009 Zoning Ordinance that its purpose "is to preserve and

promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City
of Pearl . . . through the regulation of: .

(Exhibit

5,

. . the density and distribution of population."

Excerpts from the 2009 Zoning Ordinance.)

As noted above, the Mississippi Court in Cleveland MHC has already ruled that the
manufactured horne parks are entitled to continue their non conforming use under the zoning

11

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 12 of 21

regulations. And the Rankin County Circuit Court has held that the City of Pearl may not use
its Zoning Ordinance to prevent 1-lomewood from the lawful continuation of its

nonconforming use. Thus, the City of Pearl is not entitled to use a density zoning regulation
that attempts to regula.te "concentration of population" to prevent the manufactured home
parks from using their parks in the same way that they have been used for decades. The

City's alleged concern that "the high density of structures" is a safety issue (see Exhibit 4)
is a pretextual attempt by the City to circumvent the rulings ofthe Mississippi Supreme Court
and the Rankin County Circuit Court.

The City's alleged concern for the "safety" of the manufactured home park residents
is also belied by a 2013 Statement of its Code Enforcement Officer, Brian McCairty.

(Exhibit 6.) In that Statement submitted in support of the City's response to a petition filed
by Plaintiff Home wood to reverse the interpretation of the 2009 Ordinance and to reverse the
denial of a permit to place a manufactured home in a park, Mr. McCairty criticized the

number and spacing of the structures in Grove Acres, but did not state that he had safety
concerns because of the density. Instead, Mr. McGairty stated only that "[ alesthetically the

great number and close spacing of the structures in Grove Acres is unsightly." (Emphasis
added.) As to so-called code violations, Mr. McGairty stated:
Grove Acres does not have an outstanding record of compliance with the
City's requirements. The presence ofthe 1louse trailer is just an example. The
City, in the last few years, has established an environmental court and assigned

sworn code enforcement officers to near exclusive duty in the code
12

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 13 of 21

enforcement area. Due to the size of the City, a systematic review of Grove
Acres has not been undertaken. However, a cursory ride-through by one ofthe
Code Officers indicated numerous code violations are present despite the
recent efforts to spruce up." (Exhibit 6.)
Despite these statements by the City's Code Enforcement Officer in 20 13, the City has
still not cited Grove Acres (or any other Plaintifl] with any code violations. Mr. McGairly

appears to be primarily concerned with the mere "presence of the House trailer, " not with
safety.

The City's Legislative Findings of Fact and Conclusions, drafted in 2013 in support
of its 2009 Zoning Ordinance, are instructive here as to the City's purposeful discrimination

against manufactured home parks and its continued discrimination against these parks after
the Cleveland MHC ruling. These statements are evidence that the City of Pearl is not
concerned for the safety and welfare of the manufactured home park tenants, but instead

wants to rid itself of "eye-sores" that are a "detriment on property values." In this 2013
report by the City of Pearl, it made the following detrimental statements, among others, about

manufactured home parks in Pearl:
32. In 2009, the Governing Authorities found that non-site built residential

land uses, within the City, have historically, tended to become eye-sores, a
detriment on property values and to present a disproportionate drain on city
services, including law enforcement.
33. In 2009, the Governing Authorities found that the commissioned housing
study completed in 2008, reflects that the City aircady has a more than

adequate supply ofapartments and manufactured housing and that the planners

13

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 14 of 21

feCOmillellded reducing "the land area zoned for manufactured liolnes within

the City of Pearl, Mississippi."
37. In 2009, the Governing Authorities of the City of Pearl, Mississippi, found
the clear and expressed [ ] public will is that the City should be, now and in the
future, generally a safe, low crime and low density community made up

primarily of single family residences in planned and platted neighborhoods

with vibrant, orderly and conveniently located commercial districts and
convenient opportunities for an array of educational, recreational, social and
cultural activities,

Grove Acres is not a quality manufactured home community.
Aesthetically the great number and close spacing of the structures in Grove
Acres is unsightly. The property is incongruent and inconsistent with the
commercial uses to the west and the single family site build [ sicj homes
(traditional pitched roofstructures with lawns, yards, landscaping and adequate
driveway parking) to the south and east and the commercial and governmental
uses (such as the City's New Library) to the north.
Because of the
manufactured homes' boxy appearance they are commonly referredto by many
of their occupants and others as "trailers." The boxy manufactured homes in
Grove Acres look nearly identical to the boxy pre-1976 mobile homes in the
"Hurst Tra.iler Court" just east of City Hall. There is little to make Grove
Acres a conununity. The tightly packed boxes do not allow the green space
and yard areas which would promote social interaction and a sense of
community. The small "play ground" is remote to most of the boxes and
appears to be little used. Only a few of the "lots" are of sufficient size to allow
any landscaping that might improve the appearance of the lots and Grove
Acres itself. Grove Acres is no where near to the minimum quality standards
set forth in the requirements for a Manufactured Home Subdivision in the
M HS District. (Emphasis added.)
75.

94. The City's Housing Study completed in 2008, recommended that the City
reduce the amount of manufactured housing in the City. The study remains

accurate and applicable to the circumstances in
101,

2013, .

It is exprcssly held that public interest in safety, aesthetics, protection of

the value and enjoyment of neighboring propertics, the quality of life and
livability of the area, and bringing the property into line with neighboring
14

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 15 of 21

commercial uses and having the subject property put to the highest and best
use, of the and the [ sic] general welfare must be balanced against the
unsubstantiated claims of harm or potential to Homewood. When this
balancing is done in this case, it is clear that the public interest should such
real or imagined
on Homewood should be, and
hereby is, deemed slight at worst and none [ sic.| existent at best. This is
especially true, given nature of the property as prime commercial real estate;
the time period for Homewood to recoup its investment and, by its own
choices, to control the speed at which manufactured homes are moved out of

Grove Acres.

C-2

There is absolutely no need for manufactured home parks in the
District. The highest and best use of the Grove Acres property is
. . .

commercial. . . .

I 58. Grove Acres and its boxy structures harm the neighboring property
values and views from those neighboring propertics.
(Exhibit 1.)
The statements made by the City in this report in 2013 indicate clearly the City's

disdain for manufactured home parks in the City and its clear desire to rid itself of these
parks no matter what. These statements are evidence that the City's expressed concern for

the safety and welfare of the manufactured home tenants is nothing more than a pretext for
the City's intent to destroy the Plaintiffs' manufactured home parks by attrition, if nothing

else.
The Housing Study completed for the City of Pearl in 2008 also demonstrates the City
of Pearl's dislike of rental housing, including manufactured homes, which are largely
occupied by those with low to moderate income, In that report, it stated that "City leaders

15

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 16 of 21

identified their concern with the growth of the rental housing community in the past fifteen
ycars, and particularly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina." (Housing Study 2()08 for the City

of Pearl, Mississippi, at p.

3,

Exhibit 7.) The City's "concern" was then associated with

items other than safety and welfare, including the socioeconomic status of the tenants.

The Housing Study indicated that homeowners had higher incomes than renters:
"Controlling for other social and economic factors, home ownership is positively associated
with household income for older adults in both rural and urban areas (Miller & Montalto,
1998)." (Id. at p. 17.) The Housing Study also stated:
This study indicates that families moving up the housing ladder, struggling
blue collar workers and black renters are most likely to be interested in
purchasing a home, but may have difficulties overcoming initial barriers to
purchase. The study also indicated that lifestyle renters and clderly life cycle
renters are least likely to be interested in purchasing a horne.
(2008 Housing Study at p.

23,

Bxhibit 7.) And: "[ rlenters tend to have lower household

incomes than homeowners. 2000 Census data indicated that the median household income

in Pearl for homeowners was

$42,281,

while the median houschold income for renters was

$26,899, 26.4% less." (2008 Housing Study at p. 24, Exhibit 7.)
II,

Irreparable Harm

In Asbury, this Court set forth what must be shown to prove irreparable harm:
In order for plaintiffs to be granted preliminary injunctive relief they must
show a substantial threat that they would suffer irreparable injury if an
injunction is not granted. In order to meet the burden of showing irreparable

injury if not awarded an injunction, plaintiffs need to establish that they are
under a substantial threat of harm which cannot be undone through monetary
damages.
16

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 17 of 21

812 F. Supp. 2d at 781.
The threat of irreparabic harm is clear in this case. Plaintiffs own and operate five

manufactured home parks that have been in business in the City of Pearl for over 50 years.
Since approximately 2010 the City ofPearl (primarily relying on the 2009 Zoning Ordinance)

has attempted to run these manufactured home parks out of the City of PearL Although the
City of Pearl was ordered by the Rankin County Circuit Court in August 2015 to rcycrse its

actions taken against these manufactured home parks in refusing to allow them to replace
manufactured homes, the City of Pearl as recently as September 2015 has indicated that it

will continue its refusal to allow manufactured homes to be replaced in the parks, and indeed
has refused access to utilitics to a home moved into one of the parks.
Thus,

in this

case,

Plaintiffs have shown that there is not just a thryt of thture

harm,

there is real and definite harm occurrine daily. The United States Supreme Court stated the

following:
The purpose of an injunction is to prevent fu lure violations .. . and, of course,
it can be utilized even without a showing of past wrongs. But the moving
party must satisfy the court that relief is needed. The necessary determination
is that there exists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation, something
more than the mere possibility which serves to keep the case alive.
U.

S,

v. WE Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633 (1953).

As a result of the City's actions, the manufitctured home parks have lost business and

will continue to lose business. Even though Plaintiffs are able to place a monetary value on
17

Case 3:14-cv-00907-HTW-LRA Document 30 Filed 09/29/15 Page 18 of 21

the amount of business aircady lost due to the City of Pearl's actions, it becomes very

difficult to place a monetary amount on the extent of damages to them if they are not allowed
in the future to continue to operate their manufactured home parks. The Second Circuit

Court of Appeals addressed this point in Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor

Co.,

429 F. 2d I 197, 1205 (2d Cir. 1970), when it stated the following: "Of course, Semmes'

[ plaintiffs|

past profits would afford a basis for calculating damages for wrongful

termination, and no one doubts Ford's ability to respond. But the right to continue a business

in which William Semmes has engaged for twenty years and into which his son had recently
entered is not measurable entirely in monetary terms, the Senunes want to sell automobiles,

not to live on the income from a damages award.
Importantly, when an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, such
as the Plaintiffs' constitutional right to enjoy their property as they have done for decades,

courts have held that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary. See Elrod

v.

Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976) (since First Amendment interests were clearly either threatened

or in fact being impaired at the time relief was sought, irreparable injury was shown and an
injunction was properly directed by the Court of Appeals); Battle v. Municipal Housing
Authority for City of Yonkers, 53

F.R, D,

423 (S.D. N.Y. 1971) (holding that a requirement

that welfare recipients obtain the co-signature of the county department of social services
before being allowed to rent municipal housing violated the Equal Protection Clause, so that

the continued exclusion of plaintiffs from public housing because of the lack of a
co-signature inflicted irreparable harm justifying a preliminary injunction).
The factor of irreparable harm weighs in favor of ordering a preliminary injunction.
III. Harm to the Plaintiffs versus Harm to the Defendants

The threat of injury to the Plaintiff manufactured home park owners clearly outweighs
the threat of injury that injunctive relief may cause the City of Pearl and its Mayor. The

threat of injury to the manufactured home park owners is substantial: they are unable to
operate their manufactured home parks in the same manner as they have done for the last 50

years. By contrast, granting injunctive relief against the City of Pearl and its Mayor will only
require them to allow the Plaintiffs to continue to operate in the City of Pearl in the same

manner as they have done for the last 50 years.
IV,

Public Interest

The public has an interest in insuring that municipalities are not allowed to
discriminate against low-income or moderate-income individuals and/or families who wish
to live in manufactured homes in the City of Pearl, Moreover, there is a public interest in
allowing property owners to exercise their constitutional rights to use and enjoy their
property in the same manner in which they have done for decades.

V. Conclusion
Pcnding trial of this matter on the merits, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court
grant their Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
Trial is currently set for March 21, 2016, but the City of Pearl has requested a lengthy

extension of deadlines which, if granted, will continue the daily harm to Plaintiffs based on
Defendants' patently un constitutional actions. Defendants should not be allowed during this
period to prevent the Plaintiffs from exercising their constitutional rights to use their
properties as they have done for over fifty years and as ordered by both the Mississippi
Supreme Court and the Rankin County Circuit Court.
