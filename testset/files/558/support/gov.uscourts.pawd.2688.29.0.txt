Civil Action No. 03-239 Erie
Judge Cohill

MOTION FOR
CONTINUANCE OF TRIAL DATE
AND NOW, comes the Defendant, the Pennsylvania State Police, by its attorneys,
Thomas W. Corbett, Jr., Attorney General, Scott A. Bradley, Senior Deputy Attorney General,
and Susan J. Forney, Chief Deputy Attorney General, Chief, Litigation Section, and moves for a
continuance of the trial date previously scheduled in the above captioned case:
1. This is an employment discrimination action brought pursuant to Title VII where
Plaintiff has alleged that he was subjected to a hostile work environment and disparate treatment
based on his race.
2. At a pretrial conference convened by the Court on August 7, 2007, the case was listed
for trial, with the final pretrial conference and jury selection scheduled for 1:30 o’clock p.m. on
Tuesday, October 9, 2007.
3. In the course of contacting witnesses for the defense of this case, undersigned counsel
was informed that Sidney Simon is not available for the scheduled trial date because of a
previously scheduled work commitment. Mr. Simon is currently the Security Manager for the
Hershey Company; he is scheduled to attend a national conference on corporate security in New

Orleans the week this case has been set for trial. All expenses associated with this conference
have been prepaid.
4. When previously employed by the Pennsylvania State Police, Mr. Simon was the
Plaintiff’s direct supervisor during critical portions of the times Plaintiff is claiming he was
subjected to a hostile work environment and disparate treatment by the Pennsylvania State
Police. Therefore, he is a critical witness for the defense, and the defense would be prejudiced if
he were not available to testify.
5. Plaintiff’s counsel has indicated that Plaintiff does not consent to this request for
continuance.
6. It appears that defense counsel and all necessary defense witnesses will be available
during this Court’s next scheduled trial term.
7. Accordingly, undersigned counsel requests a continuance of the trial date in this case
until the Court’s next scheduled trial term, or otherwise at the Court’s convenience.
