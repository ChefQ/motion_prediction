DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR REPLY, DOCKET 29

1. Magistrate Judge Pizzo considered plaintiff's request to reply at the February 7,
2014 status conference. The Court ruled after discussing the matter, and denied
leave to reply. This is an untimely motion for reconsideration 18 days later, but
three week days before the hearing. The present motion fails to mention the
Court's prior ruling, which was exactly on this point

2. Local Rules plainly prohibit this reply. Local Rule 4.06(2) requires all filings in
support of the motion to be filed with the motion. Even if plaintiff were opposing
the motion, any filing now would be out of time. Local Rule 4.06(3).

3. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(c)(2) plainly prohibits this reply.

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE: I HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing was served this 25%

day of February, 2014 to all persons participating in the ecmf filing system.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED
