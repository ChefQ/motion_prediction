PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION IN
SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Plaintiff hereby respectfully requests leave of this Court to file supplemental authority
– to wit, a supplemental declaration of Greg DuMont in further support of its motion for a
preliminary injunction filed on January 27, 2014 (doc. 2).
Defendant filed a response to Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction on
February 17, 2014. The response papers attach certain emails written by Mr. DuMont and
assert that Mr. DuMont’s initial declaration was “false,” “not honest” and “untrue.”
Although the facts set forth in the response declarations are largely true, they leave out key
facts, take Mr. DuMont’s emails out of context and create an overall impression which is
misleading. Plaintiff therefore submits that it would be appropriate and helpful to the Court
to allow Mr. DuMont to submit a supplemental declaration, responding to the Defendant’s
attacks on his integrity, placing his emails in context, and correcting the misleading
impression left by Defendant’s omission of key facts.

Specifically, Defendant’s response papers, though they concede that Defendant is
breaching its Exclusivity Agreement with Plaintiff, contend that such breach is excusable and
will not harm Plaintiff because Plaintiff was supposedly willing to assign its rights to “any
entity,” thus supposedly belying its claim of irreparable harm, as supposedly reflected in
emails written by Mr. DuMont. These assertions take use of Mr. DuMont’s words “any
entity” out of context and leave out the crucial point: Plaintiff was willing to assign its rights
to any entity with commercially aligned interests and under common ultimate ownership.
But Plaintiff never contemplated, and never would have permitted, assignment of its rights to
a party (like the party to whom Defendant is effectively transferring Plaintiff’s rights in
breach of the Exclusivity Agreement) that is not commercially aligned or under common
ultimate ownership. When Mr. DuMont’s emails are put in context, and the misimpression
conveyed by Defendant’s omissions are corrected, it is clear that Mr. DuMont’s emails are
not at all inconsistent with his initial declaration or Plaintiff’s claim that it is suffering
irreparable harm.
Mr. DuMont’s proposed supplemental declaration will be helpful to the Court in that
it will explain the context for the emails relied upon by Defendant and, by providing such
context and filling in key facts omitted from Defendant’s papers, demonstrate that
Defendant’s presentation is misleading and that Mr. DuMont’s initial declaration was not
“false” or “untrue.” The supplemental declaration is relatively brief (just over 6 doublespaced pages, including the case caption) and would not attach any exhibits.
Generation Z therefore respectfully requests that the Court enter an order granting
leave to file a Supplemental Declaration of Greg DuMont.
