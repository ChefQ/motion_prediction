Filed 07/15/10 Page 6 of 24

Defendants Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc. (“EVD”) and Thomas E. Faust Jr. (“Mr.
Faust”) submit this Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss the Amended
Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (“Amended Complaint” or “Am. Compl.”).
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This case is part of a broadside attack on fees paid by mutual funds in accordance with
Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“ICA”) that has already been rejected in
Smith v. Franklin/Templeton Distr. Inc., 4:09-cv-4775-PJH, 2010 WL 2348644 (N.D. Cal. June
8, 2010).1
Plaintiff is a shareholder in one of the mutual funds (“Funds”) that is a series of Eaton
Vance Municipals Trust (the “Trust”). EVD is the Trust’s distributor and the individual
defendants are its trustees (“Trustees”). In his Amended Complaint, plaintiff attacks 12b-1
payments from the Trust to EVD, which EVD uses to compensate broker-dealers who sell Fund
shares.
The core premise of the lawsuit is that the payment of 12b-1 fees to a broker-dealer that
is not also registered as an investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(“Advisers Act”) is illegal. According to plaintiff, the receipt of 12b-1 fees, which plaintiff
labels “asset-based compensation,” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33-34, transforms a broker into an
investment adviser under Advisers Act § 202(a)(11), which generally defines an investment
adviser as “any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others … as
to the value of securities.” Plaintiff recognizes that the Advisers Act expressly excludes from the
1

This is one of a number of lawsuits and “investigations” mounted by the same counsel
making essentially identical allegations and leveling the same legal challenge against the same
established practices. The plaintiff who filed the Franklin case also filed two other cases, Smith
v. Oppenheimer Funds Distr., Civil Action No. 10-CV-00655-JLK-KMT (D. Col.), and Smith v.
Oppenheimer Funds Distr., No. 1:10-CV-00654-JLK (D. Col.). In addition, the website for
plaintiff’s lead counsel states that they are “investigating” more than 20 other mutual fund
complexes. See www.milberg.com, “Investigation of Improper Mutual Fund Sales Practices.”

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

definition of an investment adviser “any broker or dealer whose performance of such services is
solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker and who receives no special
compensation therefor.” 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11)(C). Nonetheless, citing Financial Planning
Ass’n v. SEC, 482 F.3d 481 (D.C. Cir. 2007), plaintiff maintains that 12b-1 fees are “special
compensation,” rather than transactional commissions (which plaintiff concedes that a broker
may legally receive).
Plaintiff’s theory is meritless. Rule 12b-1 fees are transaction-based compensation in that
they are tied to the sale of particular mutual fund shares. And much of the purpose of Rule 12b-1
is to facilitate an investor’s ability to finance the payment of a sales load to his broker. See, e.g.,
Yameen v. Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., 394 F. Supp. 2d 350, 354-55 (D. Mass. 2005).
Accordingly, the SEC views Rule 12b-1 fees as the functional equivalent of a broker’s
commission, and they are regulated as such by the National Association of Securities Dealers
(“NASD”). See Exchange Act Release No. 30897, 1992 WL 159735, 57 Fed. Reg. 30,985,
30,986, 30,988-90 (July 13, 1992); Franklin, 2010 WL 2348644 at *8. As the Franklin court
recognized, moreover, Financial Planning “is irrelevant to the payment of the distribution fees
known as ‘12b-1 fees’ that plaintiff challenges in the present case.” Id. Indeed, Financial
Planning had no occasion to consider 12b-1 fees or the meaning of “special compensation.” It
merely struck down an unrelated SEC rule promulgated 25 years after Rule 12b-1.
While plaintiff’s failure to allege any unlawful conduct resolves the case in its entirety,
there are numerous additional grounds to dismiss each of the individual claims of the Amended
Complaint. Based on his erroneous theory that it is illegal for brokers to receive 12b-1 fees,
plaintiff asserts five purported shareholder derivative claims set out in separate “counts.” Each is
legally deficient.

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

Filed 07/15/10 Page 8 of 24

Count I (against EVD) is based on § 47(b) of the ICA, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-46(b). Plaintiff
alleges that the performance of the Trust’s Distribution Agreement with EVD pursuant to which
the Trust pays 12b-1 fees to EVD, ultimately results in a violation of the Advisers Act by the
recipient broker-dealers. Plaintiff claims that this implicates EVD’s “duties [that] arise under
Section 36(a) of the ICA and SEC Rule 38a-1 thereunder”; Am. Compl. ¶ 73. Therefore,
according to plaintiff, “[t]he Trust is obligated to void the broker-dealer compensation provisions
in its Distribution Agreement” and obtain restitution of the payments made to EVD. Am.
Compl. ¶¶ 74-75.
But plaintiff has no claim under § 47(b). See Franklin, 2010 WL 2348644 at *7-8. The
alleged violation of the Advisers Act does not render the Trust’s Distribution Agreement
voidable under § 47(b), which requires predicate violation of the ICA enforceable by plaintiff.
The vague duties conjured up by plaintiff under § 36(a) and Rule 38a-1 do not supply plaintiff
with a right of action. And plaintiff has failed to allege any contract that is itself unlawful (as
opposed to allegedly illegal transactions pursuant to a lawful contract) – another prerequisite to a
§ 47(b) claim. Moreover, defendants’ reliance on Rule 12b-1 in paying distribution fees
provides a complete defense under ICA § 38(c) to the claims under § 47(b).
Count II (against EVD) is similar to plaintiff’s § 47(b) claim. It seeks “contract voiding”
and restitution under state law, again relying on a purported violation of the Advisers Act by the
broker-dealers and supposed “duties [of EVD] created by the ICA,” not to make “unlawful”
payments. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 76-80.2 Count II is preempted because it seeks to impose additional
consequences under state law for the supposed illegality of the Distribution Agreement under

2

Paragraph 80 of the Amended Complaint is missing text. The intent appears to be to
track paragraph 75.

3

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

federal law. Even if it were not preempted, state law does not pile on additional and potentially
inconsistent sanctions based on the supposed illegality of a contract under a federal statute.
Count III alleges that EVD has breached its contract with the Trust based on EVD’s
breach of its warranty in its Distribution Agreement with the Trust “that it comply with the
federal securities laws.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 81-86. This claim is also preempted. And plaintiff has
simply distorted the contractual language and has failed to identify any provision of the
Distribution Agreement that would have been breached by EVD’s allegedly illegal conduct.
The Amended Complaint also includes two counts against Mr. Faust and the other
Trustees, which both turn on the alleged violation of the Advisers Act: Count IV, for alleged
breach of fiduciary duty in permitting the “unlawful” 12b-1 payments, and Count V, for waste in
authorizing the payments. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 87-96.
These claims must be dismissed for the separate reasons set forth in the Memorandum of
Law filed by the independent trustees and the Trust in support of their Motion to Dismiss the
Amended Complaint (“Trustees’ Memorandum”). As set forth in detail in the Trustees’
Memorandum, which is incorporated by reference herein, plaintiff’s effort to pursue these claims
derivatively in the Trust’s name fails. The Trust’s board has considered and rejected, for the
sound reasons described in the Trustees’ Memorandum, plaintiff’s demand that the Trust take
action on his claims.
BACKGROUND
The Amended Complaint contains few averments of fact3 but many conclusory legal
allegations setting out plaintiff’s position on Rule 12b-1 fees. It does allege that plaintiff owns
Class C shares of a single mutual fund, the Eaton Vance National Municipal Income Fund
(formerly the Eaton Vance National Municipals Fund) (“Income Fund”), a series of the Trust.
3

EVD and Mr. Faust reserve their rights to contest any of the facts as pleaded.
4

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

Am. Compl. ¶ 9. Plaintiff references the Trust’s public filings as a source of some of his
allegations (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 44). The Amended Complaint also describes, and in selective
instances quotes from, the Funds’ Distribution Plans, Distribution Agreement and the agreements
between EVD and the broker-dealers concerning the sale of Fund shares (“Selling Agreement”).
Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-46. Accordingly, the relevant facts are taken from the Amended Complaint
and the Registration Statement on Form N-1A filed by the Trust, and effective on February 1,
2009 (in effect at the time of plaintiff’s demand on the Trust’s board of trustees), which includes
the Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for the Income Fund describing the
Distribution Plans, and the Distribution Agreement and form of Selling Agreement, all of which
were filed publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).4
Plaintiff Jeffrey Wiener allegedly has owned Class C shares of the Income Fund since
May 17, 2007. Am. Compl. ¶ 9. Defendant EVD is a registered broker-dealer and a member of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the successor to the NASD. Am. Compl. ¶ 19. The
Trust is a registered investment company that has established the Funds as separate series. Id.
¶¶ 2, 10. Mr. Faust is one of nine Trustees of the Trust and has been classified as an “interested”
Trustee for purposes of the ICA. Id. ¶ 18. The remaining Trustees are all disinterested or
“independent.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11-17.
The Trust has elected to act as a distributor of its own shares. Id. ¶ 48. To effect this
distribution, the Trust has adopted Distribution Plans for certain classes of fund shares and has

Copies of the relevant documents are attached to the Declaration of Jeffrey B. Maletta
(“Maletta Decl.”) submitted with EVD’s and Mr. Faust’s motion to dismiss the initial complaint.
See Dckt. no. 15. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may take
judicial notice of matters of public record, documents sufficiently referred to in a complaint, and
other indisputably authentic documents underlying plaintiff’s claims. Beddall v. State Street
Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998). SEC filings fall within these parameters. In
re Stone & Webster, Inc., Securities Litig., 253 F. Supp. 2d 102, 128 n.11 (D. Mass. 2003).

entered into the Distribution Agreement with EVD, which appoints EVD as the principal
underwriter of the Funds. Am. Compl. ¶ 44. EVD buys from the Trust sufficient shares to fill
orders it has received from financial services firms. Maletta Decl. Ex. C at Section 2. Under the
Distribution Agreement, the Trust pays to EVD fees in accordance with the Distribution Plans.
Id. at Section 5(c) and (d).
The relevant Distribution Plans are described in the Prospectus in the Registration
Statement for the Income Fund, the Fund in which plaintiff allegedly owns shares. See id.;
Maletta Decl. Ex. A at 10.5 Individual investors such as plaintiff have a choice among different
classes of shares with differing fee structures. Maletta Decl. Ex. A at 10. See Yameen v. Eaton
Vance Distributors, Inc., 394 F. Supp. 2d at 352-53 (D. Mass. 2005) (describing generally
similar share classes available for Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.1).
Investors in Class A shares pay a sales charge or “load” at the time of purchase of up to
4.75 percent. Maletta Decl. Ex. A at 10, 12. Purchasers of Class B and Class C shares pay no
up-front sales charge. Id. These classes pay .75 percent of net assets annually as a distribution
fee to EVD. Id. Class B and C shareholders who redeem within certain periods after purchase
may pay a contingent deferred sales charge. Id. at 12. All three classes pay a .25 percent service
fee. Id. at 12.6
These distribution arrangements, which are typical of those in place for a multitude of
other mutual funds, give investors a choice of how to pay the sales charges associated with their
purchases of fund shares. The applicable 12b-1 fees are paid by each class to EVD under the
5

The Income Fund has four classes of shares outstanding, three of which – Classes A, B,
and C – have adopted Distribution Plans.
6

These fees are consistent with the limitations on sales compensation imposed by Rule
2830 of the NASD. See NASD Rule 2830(d). The Income Fund also offers Class I shares
through certain financial intermediaries. See Maletta Decl. Ex. A at 11.

Distribution Agreement. EVD, in turn, enters into contracts with the registered broker-dealers
who effect retail sales of Fund shares in the format of the Selling Agreement. Maletta Decl.
Ex. D at ¶ 1. The Selling Agreement spells out the broker-dealer’s obligations in selling Fund
shares and its compensation for its selling efforts. Those contracts provide for payments based
on the sale of Fund shares through transactional commissions, or through dealer discounts, and
service fees for servicing shareholder accounts holding Fund shares. Id.
ARGUMENT
To survive a motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,
accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.
Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009), quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). This
requires pleading “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the
defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. “[T]hreadbare recitals
of elements of cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id.
The Amended Complaint falls far short of this standard.
I.

THE PAYMENTS TO EVD UNDER THE DISTRIBUTION PLANS DO NOT
VIOLATE THE ADVISERS ACT
The Amended Complaint makes it very clear that plaintiff’s entire case hinges on

§ 202(a)(11) of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11)(C), and the Financial Planning
decision (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 4). Under plaintiff’s reading of that statute, a broker-dealer can
receive only “transactional commissions” and asset-based compensation is not a “transactional
commission,” it is “special compensation” for investment advisers. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31-33.
There are two flaws in this argument. First, to implicate the Advisers Act at all, the
payments must be “special compensation” for investment advice. There is no allegation that
EVD, the recipient of the payments under the Distribution Agreement under attack, is giving any

7

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

Filed 07/15/10 Page 13 of 24

investment advice to anyone. The payments received by EVD are expressly for sales
transactions and shareholder account services.
Second, and more fundamentally, the contention that these asset-based fees are not
functionally “transactional commissions,” Am. Compl. ¶ 33, is simply wrong. The amounts paid
to the selling broker-dealer are paid solely as the result of a transaction: the sale of Fund shares.
No sale, no payment. In addition, 12b-1 fees may differ based on the particular investment
company securities the broker sells and that are maintained in the brokerage account. Such
incentives provide much of the impetus for broker-dealer regulation.
Indeed, Rule 12b-1 is part of a longstanding and multilayered regulatory scheme
governing mutual fund distribution arrangements authorized by the ICA. Rule 12b-1 is expressly
authorized by § 12(b) of the ICA, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-12(b). Section 12(b) allows the SEC to adopt
rules under which a mutual fund may act as a distributor of its own shares, as the Trust has
elected to do here. In § 22(b) of the ICA, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-22(b), Congress granted the NASD
the power to regulate all charges for sales of mutual fund shares, including the distribution fees
at issue in this case. NASD Rule 28307, which was promulgated pursuant to § 22(b) and has
been approved by the SEC, see Yameen, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 354, demonstrates that much of the
purpose of Rule 12b-1 is to facilitate an investor’s ability to effectively finance the payment of a
sales load to his broker. See Exchange Act Release No. 30897, 1992 WL 159735, 57 Fed. Reg.
30,985, 30,989 (July 13, 1992) (“The [SEC] is of the opinion that the rule change carries out the
NASD’s congressional mandate to prevent excessive sales charges on mutual fund shares” and
ensures that “broker-dealers, sales personnel and underwriters … receive reasonable
compensation” and “that investors are charged reasonable sales loads”); id. (NASD’s authority to

Memorandum.

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

“regulate comprehensively mutual fund fees received by members” comports with “the statutory
mandate of section 22(b) that gives the NASD authority to prohibit excessive sales loads”);
Yameen, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 354 (Rule 12b-1 effectively allows investors in mutual funds “to
choose between paying distribution and service charges up front and spreading them out over a
period of several years”). Rule 2830(b)(8) accordingly includes “asset based sales charge[s]”
within the definition of “sales charges,” all of which are subject to the limitations of the Rule.
See Rule 2830(d). Rule 2830 similarly regulates service fees. See Rule 2830(d)(5).
Nothing in any of the federal securities laws states that an investor cannot elect to spread
a commission payment over a number of years, as plaintiff apparently elected to do in purchasing
Class C shares, rather than paying the whole, potentially higher commission, up front.
Financial Planning does not relate to this structure in any way. See Franklin, 2010 WL
2348644, at *8 (recognizing that Financial Planning is “irrelevant” in this context). Financial
Planning involved a challenge to a rule promulgated by the SEC in 2005 that, contrary to the text
of the Advisers Act, exempted broker-dealers who received “special compensation” for
providing investment advice from the requirement that they register as investment advisers. The
D.C. Circuit struck down the rule, concluding that the conduct permitted by the rule was outside
the scope of the statutory exemption granted in § 202(a)(11)(C) of the Advisers Act. 482 F.3d at
494. The court did not consider 12b-1 fees and did not address (let alone alter) the statutory
exemption for “any broker or dealer whose performance of [investment advisory] services is
solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer, and who receives no special
compensation therefor.”
Other courts, both before and after Financial Planning, have read the Advisers Act to
exempt broker-dealers from registration where the compensation related to sales and other

broker-dealer functions. See Thomas v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., No. CIV-07-0121-F, 2009
WL 2778663, *6-10 (W.D. Okla. Aug. 31, 2009) (registration not required where compensation
was for “making the sale”); Kassover v. UBS Fin. Serv., 619 F. Supp. 2d 28, 34 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)
(dismissing complaint that failed to allege broker-dealer was paid special compensation for
investment advice or that any advice was not solely incidental to maintenance of brokerage
accounts); Luzerne County Ret. Bd. v. Makowski, 627 F. Supp. 2d 506, 573-74 (M.D. Pa. 2007)
(compensation for transaction-related services and administration of investment fund is not
special compensation for investment advice); Kaufman v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith, Inc., 464 F. Supp. 528, 538 (D. Md. 1978) (broker-dealer not an investment adviser as any
investment advice was incidental to services as broker on account).
In short, the Advisers Act’s requirement that broker-dealers who receive “special
compensation” for investment advice must register as an investment adviser simply has no
application to payments under Rule 12b-1. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint should be
dismissed in its entirety.
II.

THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTS AGAINST EVD FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM
A.

The Amended Complaint Fails to State a Claim Under ICA § 47(b)

Section 47(b) does not regulate conduct; it provides a remedy under which the parties to a
contract may seek to rescind it if that contract violates another provision of this “subchapter” –
the ICA or the regulations issued under the ICA.8 See, e.g., Stegall v. Ladner, 394 F. Supp. 2d
358, 378 (D. Mass. 2005). This aspect of the statute compels dismissal of plaintiff’s § 47(b)
claim for two reasons.

8

Section 47(b)(1) provides that “[a] contract that is made, or whose performance involves
a violation of this subchapter, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder, is unenforceable by
either party . . . .” 15 U.S.C. § 80a-46 (emphasis added).

10

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

Filed 07/15/10 Page 16 of 24

First, since plaintiff’s allegations that duties owed under the ICA have been breached
depend entirely on his defective claim under the Advisers Act, he has not stated a violation of the
ICA to support a § 47(b) claim.
Second, plaintiff’s effort to bootstrap his way to a § 47(b) claim by alleging a supposed
“violation” of § 36(a) and Rule 38-1 fails. Numerous courts have recognized that § 36(a) does
not provide a private plaintiff with a right of action. See, e.g., Bellikoff v. Eaton Vance Corp.,
481 F.3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2007); Stegall, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 371-72. It therefore cannot serve
as a basis for a claim under § 47(b). See Stegall, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 378 (dismissing § 47(b)
claim after finding no private right of action under § 36(a)).
Moreover, § 36(a) is not a substantive provision of the ICA that can be violated. As the
SEC has recognized, the section provided no basis for finding a violation of the Act, even by the
SEC itself:
Neither before the [1970] amendment nor afterwards, does § 36 in
terms make anything unlawful. It simply authorizes the
Commission to file an action in the Federal court and empowers
the court to grant appropriate relief. Such language would not
normally lead to the conclusion that the conduct actionable under
the section is a violation of the Act. Moreover, violations of the
Act are criminal offenses. And . . . Congress in 1940 deliberately
determined that Section 36 should not be a basis for criminal
prosecution. . . . Hence . . . Section 36 cannot serve as the sole
basis for administrative sanctions.
In re Carl L. Shipley, Exchange Act Release No. 10870, 4 SEC Docket 476, 478, 1974 WL
161761, *3 (Jun. 21, 1974).
Thus, even though ICA § 9(b) authorizes the SEC to conduct an administrative
proceeding for “willful[] viola[tions] [of] any provision[] of . . . this Act,” the SEC has
concluded that § 36(a) cannot be the basis for an administrative action because it cannot be
“violated.” This analysis is equally applicable to § 47(b), which as a prerequisite to relief

11

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

Filed 07/15/10 Page 17 of 24

similarly requires a plaintiff to show “a violation of this subchapter or of any rule, regulation or
order thereunder.” 15 U.S.C. § 80a-46(b). This is the only plausible view of the statutory text.
It makes no sense to suggest that an enforcement provision that cannot itself be violated can
serve as the basis for a remedy under § 47(b). See Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 176-77 (1994) (federal courts lack authority to
“extend liability beyond the scope of conduct prohibited by the statutory text”); cf. Gonzaga
Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285 (2002) (“One cannot go into court and claim a ‘violation’ of
Section 1983 – for Section 1983 by itself does not protect anyone against anything.”).
Similarly, Rule 38a-1 imposes no obligations on EVD, the only defendant named in
Count I, or any other defendant. It imposes obligations only on registered investment companies
and their Chief Compliance Officers (“CCOs”). For example, an investment company must
adopt a compliance plan and designate a CCO. See Rule 38a-1(a)(1) and (4), 17 C.F.R. §
270.38a-1(a). The CCO must report violations of federal securities laws to the board. Rule
38a-1(a)(4)(iii), 17 C.F.R. § 270.38a-1(a)(4). There is no allegation that these requirements have
not been satisfied here. Plaintiff attempts to spin from these provisions affirmative obligations
on the part of the Trustees to take the action that he demands in the Amended Complaint. But
Rule 38a-1 imposes no such obligations. See Franklin, 2010 WL 2348644, at *7-8 (Rule 38a-1
creates no private right of action and “does not impose on funds a duty to assure that the brokerdealers comply with registration requirements”).
Count I also fails because plaintiff does not allege that the Distribution Agreement itself
is unlawful, only that its “performance” violates the duties arising under the ICA. See, e.g., Am.
Compl. ¶ 61. Section 47(b) does not support a claim absent an allegation that the relevant
contract itself (here the Distribution Agreement) is illegal. See, e.g., GFL Advantage Fund, Ltd.

12

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

v. Colkitt, 272 F.3d 189, 200-02 (3d Cir. 2001) (under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 §
29(b), only unlawful contracts may be rescinded, not allegedly unlawful transactions made
pursuant to lawful contracts); Zerman v. Jacobs, 510 F. Supp. 132, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), aff’d,
672 F.2d 901 (2d Cir. 1981). As noted above, the Amended Complaint contains no allegation
that the payments from the Trust to EVD under the Distribution Agreement are “special
compensation” to a broker-dealer to provide “investment advice” to any customer in exchange
for that compensation. Cf. ING v. Principal Protection Funds Litig., 369 F. Supp. 2d 163, 169
(D. Mass. 2005) (dismissing claims that 25 basis point service fee was excessive where no
allegation that fees are unrelated to services being rendered). In any event, as plaintiff
acknowledges, the retail broker-dealers can comply with plaintiff’s vision of the Advisers Act,
thus making the payments lawful even under plaintiff’s theory. See Am. Compl. ¶ 51.
Finally, to the extent that the Amended Complaint relies on a violation of the ICA, no
relief can be granted, as EVD has a complete defense under § 38(c) of that Act. 15 U.S.C.
§ 80a-37(c). Section 38(c) provides that “[n]o provision of this title imposing any liability shall
apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation or order of
the [SEC],” even if such rule, regulation or order may subsequently be rescinded or invalidated.
As plaintiff’s initial complaint itself alleged, the payments made under the Plans have been made
“as allowed by Rule 12b-1” (Compl. ¶ 45) and other SEC and NASD regulations. There is no
allegation that defendants could not rely in good faith on this regulatory framework. Therefore,
no liability may be based on § 47(b).
B.

The Amended Complaint Fails to State a Claim for “Contract Voiding”

Plaintiff’s Second Count, “Contract Voiding Pursuant to State Law Against Eaton Vance
Distributors,” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 76-80, expressly asserts that the “Trust is obligated to void the
broker-dealer compensation provisions in its Distribution Agreement between the Trust and
13

Case 1:10-cv-10515-DPW Document 30

Filed 07/15/10 Page 19 of 24

Eaton Vance Distributors, because performance cannot be accomplished without violating the
foregoing duties under the ICA and SEC Rule 38a-1 and the Advisers Act.” Am. Compl. ¶ 79.
This claim fails for two reasons.
First, it is preempted by federal law. Although state law generally governs the rights and
duties of sellers and purchasers of goods and services, “the effect of illegality under a federal
statute is a matter of federal law … even in diversity actions in the federal courts after [Erie R.
Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).” Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 519 (1959) (antitrust).
The express remedies provided by federal law should “not be added to judicially by including the
avoidance of private contracts as a sanction.” Id. (citing D.R. Wilder Mfg. Co. v. Corn Products
Refining Co., 236 U.S. 165 (1915). See also General Life of Mo. Inv. Co. v. Shamburger, 546
F.2d 774, 783 n.15 (8th Cir. 1976) (enforceability of stock subscription agreement in violation of
the Securities Act of 1933 was a matter of federal law); Rothberg v. Rosenbloom, 808 F.2d 252,
254 n.2 (3d Cir. 1986) (“We see no need to consider the defense of illegality under Pennsylvania
law because the public policy, even as alluded to by the district court, is one that underlies
federal securities law, not Pennsylvania law. Therefore, the analysis with respect to the illegality
defense is governed by federal law, not state law.”) (transaction allegedly in violation of Rule
10b-5).9
The conclusion that states are not free to impose additional or different consequences to
contracts in supposed violation of federal law is reinforced in this context given Congress’s
decision to reduce or eliminate overlapping and duplicative state and federal regulation of
9

See generally Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 476 (1979) (“When a federal statute
condemns an act as unlawful the extent and nature of the legal consequences of the
condemnation, though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless federal
questions, the answers to which are to be derived from the statute and the federal policy which it
has adopted.”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

investment advisers. See Advisers Act § 203A, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3a; S. Rep. No. 293, 104th
Cong. 2d Sess. 3 (1996) (in the Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act, Congress
sought to eliminate “overlapping regulatory responsibilities” over investment advisers by the
states and the SEC).10
Here, there is an express federal remedy for a contract that supposedly violates a federal
statute. A new and broader one cannot be created under state law.
Even assuming arguendo that the state law claims were not broadly preempted in this
context, state law requires dismissal of plaintiff’s § 47(b) claim and also dooms plaintiff’s state
law “contract voiding” claim.
Where, as here, legislation addresses in detail when a contract is voidable for alleged
illegality, Massachusetts courts have recognized that there is no need or persuasive basis to tack
on additional or different standards under the common law. See, e.g., City of Lawrence v.
Falzarano, 380 Mass. 18, 402 N.E.2d 1017, 1020 (1980) (“If a statute does not declare a contract
made in violation of its terms to be void, and if it is not necessary to hold the contract void in
order to accomplish the purposes of the statute, the inference is that the statute was intended to
be directory, and not prohibitory, of the contract.”); LeClair v. Norwell, 430 Mass. 328, 719
N.E.2d 464, 472 (1999) (similar); Town Planning and Engineering Associates, Inc., 369 Mass.
737, 342 N.E.2d 706, 711 (1976) (“Our cases warn against the sentimental fallacy of piling on
sanctions unthinkingly once an illegality is found.” In addition, “[c]ourts do not go out of their
way to discover some illegal element in a contract or to impose hardship upon the parties beyond

particularly § 203A of the Advisers Act).

The Amended Complaint Fails to State a Claim for Breach of Contract

Count III alleges a breach of contract based on purported violation of a warranty in the
Distribution Agreement that EVD “will comply with the federal securities laws.” Am. Compl. ¶
82. Plaintiff alleges no actual damages, but contends that this supposed contractual breach
resulted in a “per se” waste of Trust assets. Am. Compl. ¶ 85.
Plaintiff’s “per se damages” theory is preempted for the same reason as Count II: it seeks
to impose additional state law consequences based solely on the supposed illegality of the
Distribution Agreement under federal law.
In any event, the relevant provision in the Distribution Agreement, which is quoted
elsewhere in the Amended Complaint itself, states that EVD agrees it “will use its best efforts in
all respects duly to conform with the requirements of all state and federal laws relating to the
sale of such [Fund] shares.” Am. Compl. ¶ 46. See Maletta Decl. Ex. C at ¶ 4 (emphasis added).
Thus, there is no contractual term to support plaintiff’s sweeping claim. See Brooks v. AIG
SunAmerica Life Assur. Co., 480 F.3d 579, 586 (1st Cir. 2007) (to state a viable breach of
contract claim, plaintiff “must do more than allege, in conclusory fashion, that the defendant
breached the contract”; he must “describe[e], with ‘substantial certainty,’ the specific contractual
promise the defendant failed to keep”). As demonstrated in the preceding sections, the Amended
Complaint does not allege that EVD has even violated any of the securities laws, certainly none
relating to the sale of securities. And there are no facts alleged to support the conclusion that
EVD did not use its best efforts to conform to the law. Accordingly, Count III fails to state a
claim and should be dismissed as well.

THE CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND WASTE AGAINST
MR. FAUST SHOULD BE DISMISSED
The Amended Complaint contains no specific allegations concerning Mr. Faust that

distinguish him from the group of Trustees as a whole. As plaintiff concedes, his entire case,
including the claims against the Trustees for breach of fiduciary duty and for waste, depends on
the conclusion that the payment of asset-based compensation in connection with the sale of fund
shares and servicing of shareholder accounts violates the Advisers Act. As demonstrated above,
the Trust’s payment of Rule 12b-1 fees violates no law and is entirely consistent with the
regulatory framework. Accordingly, the claims against Mr. Faust and all Trustees should be
dismissed for failure to state a claim.
In addition, because there are no allegations of fact upon which to base these claims
against Mr. Faust, the claims should be dismissed on the grounds set forth in Parts II.A and B of
the Trustees’ Memorandum.
In the alternative, the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction of the
claims against Mr. Faust and the Trustees that are based on state law. The Amended Complaint
alleges jurisdiction under ICA § 44, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-43 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1337 over
Counts I, II and III. The remaining claims against Mr. Faust and the Trustees for breach of
fiduciary duty and waste are before the Court only on an allegation of supplemental jurisdiction
and 28 U.S.C. § 1367. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6-7. The Amended Complaint’s claims under the
Advisers Act and § 47(b) against EVD provide the only basis for federal jurisdiction. Since
plaintiff has failed to state a claim based on these provisions, the Court may decline to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction and dismiss Counts IV through V. See Stegall, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 378,
n.26.
