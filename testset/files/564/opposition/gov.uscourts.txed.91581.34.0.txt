PLAINTIFF DATATREASURY CORPORATION'S RESPONSE AND
OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STAY LITIGATION

COMES NOW DataTreasury Corporation ("DataTreasury"), Plaintiff in the
above-entitled and numbered civil action, and files the instant Response and Opposition
to the Motion to Stay filed March 24, 2006 by Defendants Wells Fargo & Company and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo").

Five other defendants in this litigation (SVPCo, Remitco/IPS, First Data,
Viewpointe and Magtek) have previously filed stay motions just like that filed by Wells
Fargo. Each of those motions has been comprehensively briefed for the Court by the
parties. Wells Fargo's contribution to the campaign to derail this litigation adds nothing
new. Indeed, Wells Fargo's brief pleading concedes that, apart from a few editorial
comments, Wells Fargo has no new argument or authority to add to that earlier adduced
by other defendants.

DataTreasury opposes the relief sought by Wells Fargo, as it has opposed all
motions to stay filed by other and earlier defendants. DataTreasury has elsewhere

debunked the notion that "the entire [reexamination] process is likely to be concluded in
eighteen months or less" (Stay Motion, pg. 2) and will not burden the Court here with a
repetition of the authority, statistics, and reasoning showing that this guess by Wells
Fargo is clearly unrealistic. Similarly, the Court is already aware that DataTreasury
disagrees with the view, espoused by Wells Fargo and several other defendants, that the
litigation path ahead resembles some form of fearsome gauntlet, and that the Court
should therefore take cover. See Stay Motion, pp. 2-3. The Court has already presided
over protracted litigation concerning these patents. The Court has construed the claims of
the `988 and `137 patents, and has received and considered all manner of summary
judgment pleadings pertaining to these patents. In view of the circumstances, discussed
in detail elsewhere, the road ahead for the Court in this litigation is not so arduous or
uncertain as to counsel in favor of a litigation stay.

Lastly, as is true of Bank of America and Wachovia (two other defendants
proceeding lockstep with this defendant, all of whom filed their stay motions
concurrently), Wells Fargo's lawyers were well-aware when they filed their stay motion
that a month previous, on February 24, 2006, DataTreasury filed a new lawsuit against
various defendants, including Wells Fargo, for infringement of additional patents recently
acquired by DataTreasury which are not subject to reexamination by the United States
Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). See EDTX Cause No. 2:06cv72 (DF). As
explained earlier by DataTreasury, the circumstances entailed by that filing render a
litigation stay ill-advised and inappropriate.

For the reasons stated herein, and based on the arguments and precedent adduced
in DataTreasury's briefing as to the stay motions earlier advanced by other defendants, no

stay should be granted in this litigation.
