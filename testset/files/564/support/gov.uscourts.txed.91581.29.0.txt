WELLS FARGO DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STAY

TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE DAVID FOLSOM:

1. Plaintiff Data Treasury Corporation ("DTC") did not serve this suit on Wells
Fargo & Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (collectively, "Wells Fargo") until September
2005. DTC alleges infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,910,988 and 6,032,137 ("the Ballard
patents"). Wells Fargo respectfully moves the Court to stay proceedings in this case pending the
reexamination of the Ballard patents currently underway at the United States Patent &
Trademark Office ("PTO"). There are ten DTC lawsuits before the Court involving the Ballard
patents in which the defendants have appeared and answered or otherwise responded. The
defendants in all of these cases have filed or are expected to file motions to stay proceedings
pending the PTO's reexamination. The nature and likely timing of the PTO's reexamination
process has been thoroughly described in motions to stay filed in other cases including Data
Treasury Corporation vy. Bank of America Corporation et al., No. 2-05-CV-00292; and Data

Treasury Corporation v. Wachovia Corporation, No. 2-05-CV-00293.' The gist of it is: Having

 

' The PTO reexamination is also one basis for motions to stay filed in DTC v. Viewpointe Archive Services,
L.L.C.,No. 2-05-CV-290; DTC v. Small Value Payments Co., No. 2-04-CV-85; and DTC v. First Data Corporation

ordered reexamination on all 93 claims of the Ballard patents, the PTO is likely to require
amendment of one or more claims of both Ballard patents, and the entire process is likely to be
concluded in eighteen months or less. Virtually any amendment of the Ballard patent claims will
significantly affect the discovery the parties do, the claims construction briefing, the invalidity
and noninfringement arguments, and the parties' trial preparation generally. Of greater concern
is the vast amount of time the Court will have to devote to pretrial matters in this case, even if it
is not tried before the PTO's reexamination is complete. If claims of the Ballard patents are
required to be amended in any meaningful way -- which appears likely -- the Court's work and
the parties' will have to be repeated.

2. DTC did not serve its complaints on Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or Wachovia
until September 2005. A docket control order was not entered in this case until January 3, 2006.
That Order schedules a final pretrial conference on October 1, 2007. The sum total of what has
been done to date in this case is that DTC has served, electronically, the same preliminary
infringement contentions and disclosures used in previous cases and the same documents
produced in previous cases. While Wells Fargo already has expended considerable time and
resources collecting potentially discoverable documents, an enormous amount of work remains
to be done. No depositions have been taken or scheduled, and claims construction briefing has
not begun.

3. DTC should admit, in all candor, that it will not be unduly prejudiced by a delay
of this case. If anything, DTC should be thankful that its resources and those of its counsel will
be conserved by a stay pending the results of the PTO's reexamination. The prospect of

prosecuting ten lawsuits set for trial in the next two years under the shadow of likely amendment

 

et al., No. 5-03-CV-39. To save space, Wells Fargo adopts and incorporates by reference descriptions of the PTO
proceedings contained in these motions and PTO documents attached to them.

of the underlying patent claims is daunting indeed. Despite any protestations to the contrary,
DTC is much closer to the beginning than the end of its litigation with Wells Fargo of the Ballard
patents.

4. The legal standard for a stay has been exhaustively briefed by defendants in other
DTC cases, and will not be repeated here. Obviously this Court's judgment in managing its
docket is paramount and unassailable. That a stay pending reexamination would simplify the
issues, however, is beyond dispute. This case is in its infancy, with no depositions taken or other
significant discovery completed. Trial has not been scheduled; rather, only a pretrial conference
has been scheduled, and that for October 2007, eighteen months away. As DTC is not an
operating company but an incorporated litigant, the only disadvantage it suffers from a stay is
inability to inflict continued and unproductive litigation expense on its adversaries, in hopes of
extorting settlements. DTC cannot complain of delay caused by the proper functioning of the
PTO, by whose authority DTC first secured the rights it seeks to vindicate.

5. Accordingly, Wells Fargo prays that (1) the Docket Control Order dated January
3, 2006, be vacated; (2) this case be administratively closed pending the outcome of the PTO's
reexamination of the Ballard patents; and (3) the parties report to the Court on a date to be

determined about the status of the PTO's reexamination.
