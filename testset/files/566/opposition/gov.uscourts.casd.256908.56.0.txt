INTRODUCTION
Courts do not reconsider rulings simply because a litigant disagrees with the outcome and

3

desires a second — or in Dell’s case, third — opportunity to present its arguments. Dell

4

nevertheless moves for reconsideration of three adverse summary judgment rulings based almost

5

exclusively on arguments that this Court has already carefully considered and properly rejected.

6

Standing alone, Dell’s failure even to attempt to identify legitimate grounds for reconsideration —

7

such as newly discovered evidence, an intervening change in law, or any “clear error” committed by

8

this Court (other than simply disagreeing with Dell’s previously stated positions) — warrants denial

9

of Dell’s motion.

10

Nor do Dell’s substantive arguments carry any more weight now than they did before. Dell’s

11

challenge to the dismissal of its license defense hinges on the erroneous contention — already

12

rejected by this Court on two separate occasions — that the Federal Circuit has established a per se

13

rule that an assignor’s retention of the right to veto subsequent transfers defeats a patent assignment.

14

Along the way, Dell both misrepresents the nature of this Court’s reliance on the Federal Circuit’s

15

recent Morrow decision and misapplies Federal Circuit law concerning prior precedential opinions.

16

Dell’s challenge to this Court’s dismissal of its counterclaim for tortious interference with

17

contract fares no better. In portraying that ruling as inconsistent with the denial of summary

18

judgment on Dell’s counterclaim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, Dell

19

focuses solely on the alleged identity of its factual allegations concerning the two counterclaims and

20

ignores the dispositive difference in their legal elements — namely, the requirement for proof that

21

Lucent induced a third-party’s failure to perform a contractual obligation. As this Court has

22

correctly held, the third-party at issue here — Alcatel — never had a contractual obligation to

23

license the video coding patents-in-suit, so there was no contract for Lucent to interfere with.

24

Finally, Dell’s challenge to this Court’s grant of summary judgment dismissing the defense

25

of unclean hands — a defense that Dell never even pled until summary judgment had already been

26

granted — also lacks merit. Dell simply regurgitates the arguments that its co-defendants

27

unsuccessfully raised and attempts to manufacture clear legal error by mischaracterizing the bases

28

for this Court’s unclean hands ruling. In reality, this Court properly determined that the evidence

presented by the defendants on summary judgment failed to create a triable issue as to whether

2

Lucent’s allegedly improper conduct impacted the equities between the parties to this case. That

3

determination hardly constitutes clear error, and amply supports this Court’s grant of summary

4

judgment.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
This consolidated action has been pending since 2002. In November 2006, Lucent formed a

7

Delaware Statutory Trust called the Multimedia Patent Trust (“MPT”) and transferred to MPT two

8

of the patents-in-suit: the Haskell ‘226 patent and the Netravali ‘272 patent (collectively, “the

9

“Video Coding Patents”). In January 2007, Multimedia Patent Trust was substituted for Lucent as

10

plaintiff for the Video Coding Patents. The circumstances surrounding Lucent’s formation of MPT,

11

transfer of the Video Coding Patents, and subsequent merger with Alctael S.A. (“Alcatel”) are

12

detailed in the briefing submitted by MPT and Lucent in support of their motions for summary

13

judgment on trust-related issues, and will not be repeated here. (See Case No. 02-CV-2060 D.I.

15

Trust’s And Lucent’s Motions For Summary Judgment On Trust-Related Defenses And

16

Counterclaims at 1-6.)

17

Beginning in February 2007, the defendants amended their pleadings to raise an array of

18

affirmative defenses and counterclaims based on Lucent’s creation of MPT, transfer of the Video

19

Coding Patents, and merger with Alcatel. For example, and despite knowing throughout this

20

five-year litigation that their respective licenses from the MPEG-LA patent pool gave them no rights

21

whatsoever in the Video Coding Patents, the defendants all asserted license defenses based on

22

Alcatel’s membership in MPEG-LA. (See Case No. 02-CV-2060 D.I. 2109, Oct. 1, 2007 Order

23

Granting In Part And Denying In Part Parties’ Motions For Summary Judgment (“the Oct. 1, 2007

24

Order”) at 4.) Gateway and Microsoft — but not Dell — also asserted the equitable defense of

25

unclean hands based on Lucent’s alleged failure to disclose to various government agencies its plan

26

to form MPT and transfer the Video Coding Patents. (See id. at 13.) In addition, the defendants all

27

asserted counterclaims for tortious interference with contract based on Lucent’s alleged interference

28

with their MPEG-LA Portfolio Licenses. (See, e.g., id. at 20-21.)

Page 7 of 18

On August 17, 2007, MPT and Lucent moved for summary judgment on many of the

2

defendants’ affirmative defenses and counterclaims, including the license, unclean hands, and

3

tortious interference with contract theories described above. By Order dated October 1, 2007, this

4

Court granted summary judgment in favor of MPT and Lucent on those issues. (See id.) In ruling

5

on the license motion, this Court rejected the defendants’ argument that Federal Circuit precedent

6

establishes a per se rule whereby retention of the power to block subsequent transfers defeats a

7

patent assignment. (See id. at 6.) The Court went on to conclude that — viewed as a whole and

8

weighed against the rights transferred to MPT — any rights retained by Lucent did not render its

9

assignment of the Video Coding Patents ineffective. (See id. at 6.)

10

In granting summary judgment in favor of MPT and Lucent on the equitable defense of

11

unclean hands, this Court found that the defendants failed to meet their burden on summary

12

judgment of presenting evidence sufficient to support a finding in their favor on a necessary element

13

of the unclean hands defense. Specifically, the Court concluded that the summary judgment record

14

lacked evidence demonstrating that the equities between the instant litigants were affected by the

15

alleged misconduct by Lucent — a supposed failure to disclose to governmental organizations its

16

plan to transfer the Video Coding Patents. (See id. at 13-14.)

17

Likewise, this Court granted summary judgment in favor of MPT and Lucent on the

18

defendants’ tortious interference with contract counterclaims because the defendants failed to come

19

forward with proof on a necessary element of those claims — namely, a third-party’s failure to

20

perform a contractual obligation. (See id. at 13-14.) This Court found that Lucent could not have

21

interfered with the defendants’ MPEG LA licenses by transferring the Video Coding Patents,

22

because MPEG LA had no right to license the Video Coding Patents.

23

In September 2007, Dell filed a motion to dismiss MPT’s infringement claims in a related

24

case pending before this Court, Case No. 07-CV-0747 (CAB) (“the 2007 litigation”). (See Case No.

25

07-CV-0746 D.I. 149, Oct. 9, 2007 Order Denying Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To

26

Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) (“the Oct. 9, 2007 Order”) at 3.) The three patents-in-suit in the 2007

27

litigation were also transferred to MPT by Lucent in November 2006. (See id. at 2.) In moving to

28

dismiss, Dell argued — just as it argues here — that the assignment of those patents to MPT was

ineffective because Lucent retained the right to veto subsequent transfers. (See id. at 7.)

2

By Order dated October 9, 2007, this Court denied Dell’s motion to dismiss the 2007

3

litigation. (See id. at 13.) Once again — and independently1 — this Court rejected Dell’s contention

4

that Federal Circuit authority sets forth a per se rule that retention of the power to block subsequent

5

transfers defeats a patent assignment. (See id. at 8 (“A closer reading indicates that reserving veto

6

power on the right to transfer is merely a factor weighing against standing, not a independently

sufficient condition to prevent it.”).)

ARGUMENT

11

A.

12

Motions for reconsideration “should not be granted, absent highly unusual circumstances.”

Legal Standards.

13

See 389 Orange Street Partners v. Arnold, 179 F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir.1999). Indeed,

14

reconsideration is appropriate only where (1) the court is “presented with newly-discovered

15

evidence,” (2) the court “committed clear error or the initial decision was manifestly unjust, or

16

(3) there is an intervening change in controlling law.” School Dist. No. 1J, Multnomak Cty. v.

17

ACandS, Inc, 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir. 1993). Where the moving party presents arguments that

18

the court already considered and rejected, the motion for reconsideration should be denied. See

19

Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1442 (9th Cir. 1991), citing Taylor v. Knapp, 871 F.2d 803,

20

805 (9th Cir. 1989). A motion for reconsideration “may not be used to raise arguments or present

21

evidence for the first time when they could reasonably have been raised earlier in the litigation.”

B.

Dell Presents No Basis For Reconsideration Of This Court’s Grant Of Summary
Judgment Dismissing Dell’s License Defense.

Dell fails to demonstrate that this Court committed clear legal or factual error warranting
reconsideration of its summary judgment rulings disposing of Dell’s license defense. Indeed, Dell’s
motion for reconsideration rests on a contention that this Court has twice properly rejected: namely,
the mistaken premise that under Federal Circuit precedent, an assignee’s retention of the right to bar
further assignment necessarily renders an express patent assignment ineffective. Nor did this Court
base its holding, as Dell contends, on a determination that any such precedent was overruled by the
Federal Circuit’s recent decision in Morrow v. Microsoft Corp., 499 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
Dell’s legal arguments therefore lack merit.
Likewise, because the defendants themselves admitted — even urged — during summary
judgment proceedings that Alcatel consented in writing to Lucent’s formation of MPT and transfer
of the Video Coding Patents, Dell cannot now credibly contend that this Court’s finding to that
effect constitutes “clear error.” Moreover, even if Alcatel failed to provide proper written consent,
and even if the lack of such written consent placed Lucent in breach of the merger agreement, such
breach would not nullify Lucent’s transfer of the Video Coding Patents. As such, Dell also fails to
demonstrate any clear error of fact — let alone material fact — committed by this Court.
1.

The Court Committed No Legal Error In Twice Rejecting Dell’s
Erroneous Interpretation Of Federal Circuit Precedent Concerning
Patent Assignments.

Dell contends that this Court committed legal error by relying on the Morrow decision to
overrule “clear” and “unequivocal” Federal Circuit authority holding that “an unfettered restriction
on alienation of [a] purportedly assigned patent defeats assignment.” Dell Br. at 7-8. As this Court
recognized in the October 9, 2007 Order, Dell’s argument fails from the outset because the Federal
Circuit never established such a bright line rule:
A closer reading [of the Federal Circuit’s precedent] indicates that
reserving veto power on the right to transfer is merely a factor weighing
against standing, not a independently sufficient condition to prevent it.
(Oct. 9, 2007 Order at 8 (emphasis added).) Judge Brewster independently reached the same

1

conclusion in the October 1, 2007 Order. (See Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 6 (“[W]here a party does not

2

have the unfettered right to assign, a finding that the party lacks ‘all substantial rights’ to the patent

3

has generally involved circumstances where the party lacks additional key rights . . ..”) (emphasis

4

added).) Dell provides no grounds — let alone new grounds — for assigning clear error to that legal

5

conclusion.

6

Nor did this Court improperly rely on Morrow to “overrule” prior inconsistent Federal

7

Circuit authority. Rather, this Court merely noted that the Morrow decision — which recognized

8

that veto power over subsequent alienation is “not significantly restrictive of [a title-owner’s]

9

exclusionary rights” to defeat assignment (see Morrow, 499 F.3d at 1342) — supports the Court’s

10

conclusion that Federal Circuit precedent never established a contrary per se rule in the first place.

11

(See Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 6; accord Oct. 9, 2007 Order at 9 (emphasis added).) As such, the

12

Morrow decision had nothing to “overrule.”

13

Moreover, even if the cases cited by Dell — including Sicom Systems Ltd. v. Agilent

14

Technologies, Inc., 427 F.3d 971 (Fed. Cir. 2005) and Propat Int’l Corp. v. RPost, Inc., 473 F.3d

15

1187 (Fed. Cir. 2007) — applied such a per se rule, reliance on Morrow in this case would not

16

violate the Federal Circuit’s rule concerning prior precedential opinions. That rule simply prevents

17

one Federal Circuit panel from overruling a previous panel decision “to the extent that the issues in

18

the [later] case are identical to those decide in [the former].” LaForte v. Horner, 833 F.2d 977, 980

19

(Fed. Cir. 1987). But as this Court has recognized, unlike here, the Sicom and Propat decisions

20

“involved the retention of legal title by the party purporting to make an assignment.” (Oct. 9, 2007

21

Order at 10 (emphasis added).) In light of that distinction, and the fact that the Sicom and Propat

22

decisions concerned the retention of key rights above and beyond the right to bar further alienation,

23

this Court had no reason to — and did not — hold that Morrow overrules Sicom or Propat.

24

Finally, Dell’s contention that this Court ignored certain rights in the Video Coding Patents

25

retained by Lucent has no basis in fact. In briefing and arguing motions for summary judgment, Dell

26

and its co-defendants vigorously called this Court’s attention to the complete set of rights that

27

Lucent allegedly reserved for itself when it assigned the Video Coding Patents to MPT, including all

28

of the rights that Dell now recites in support of its motion for reconsideration. While the October 1,

1

2007 Order does not expressly address each and every one of those rights, Dell’s contention that this

2

Court must therefore have ignored them is rank speculation, not proof of clear error. Indeed, the

3

the substance of what was granted.” (Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 5.) No basis exists to presume that this

6

Court failed to apply the very legal standard set forth in its Order.

Dell’s Alleged Factual Dispute Concerning Alcatel’s Consent To Lucent’s
Transfer Of The Video Coding Patents Is Neither Genuine Nor Material.

Dell also contends that this Court committed clear factual error by concluding that Alcatel
consented in writing to Lucent’s assignment of the Video Coding Patents to MPT. According to
Dell, absent such written agreement, Lucent breached its merger agreement with Alcatel, thereby
rendering the transfer of the Video Coding Patents a nullity. Dell’s argument for reconsideration
fails both because Dell can demonstrate no clear error in this Court’s factual determination, and
because any such error would not have altered the propriety of the summary judgment grant.
First, during summary judgment arguments, the Court inquired whether certain e-mails
between Lucent and Alcatel employees — which the defendants introduced into the summary
judgment record — demonstrate that Alcatel provided written consent for the transfer of the Video
Coding Patents. (Ex. A, Sept. 26, 2007 Hr’g Tr. at 73-74.)3 In response, counsel for Microsoft
agreed, stating “I think you could interpret it as being written consent.” (Id. at 74.) As such, Dell
Even if this Court erred in concluding that Lucent’s assignment of the Video Coding Patents to
MPT effected a transfer of ownership, reconsideration should be denied because that conclusion
was not essential to this Court’s grant of summary judgment. As this Court noted, Lucent
indisputably granted MPT the exclusive right to license and sublicense the Video Coding
Patents. (Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 6.) That finding independently vitiates Dell’s license defense,
because Dell’s license theory requires that Alcatel-Lucent be able to license the Video Coding
Patents. (Id. at 6-7.) Dell nevertheless fails to address this independent basis for summary
judgment in its reconsideration papers.

cannot credibly contend at this stage that the Court committed a clear error of fact in determining

2

that “the notice provisions were substantially performed by the parties.” (Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 9.)

3

Furthermore, even if that determination constituted clear error, this Court’s grant of summary

4

judgment would nevertheless stand. At most, failure to obtain Alcatel’s consent before transferring a

5

material asset might arguably constitute a breach of the merger agreement between Lucent and

6

Alcatel. But no legal authority exists for the proposition that breach of the merger agreement would

7

divest Lucent of its title to the Video Coding Patents or its right to assign the Video Coding Patent to

8

a third-party. Indeed, Dell has never cited a single case in support of that argument. In sum,

9

because Dell cannot demonstrate that this Court committed any clear error of fact — let alone a clear

error material to the grant of summary judgment — Dell’s motion for reconsideration concerning its

11

license defense should be rejected.

Dell Presents No Basis For Reconsideration Of This Court’s Grant Of Summary
Judgment Dismissing Dell’s Tortious Interference With Contract Counterclaim.

Dell contends that this Court should reconsider its grant of summary judgment dismissing
Dell’s tortious interference with contract counterclaim because Dell believes that this Court’s ruling
conflicts with the Court’s denial of summary judgment on Gateway’s tortious interference with
prospective economic advantage counterclaim. In so doing, Dell focuses on the overlap in factual
allegations concerning the two counterclaims. But Dell fails to consider the dispositive difference in
the legal elements of the two claims.
Specifically, a tortious interference with contract claim — unlike a tortious interference with
prospective economic advantage claim — requires proof that the defendant caused a third-party’s
failure to perform a contractual obligation to the plaintiff. As Dell itself concedes, tortious
interference with contract requires conduct “inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to
perform the contract” and “pecuniary loss resulting to the [plaintiff] from the failure of the third
person to perform the contract.” Dell Br. at 15 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766
(1979)). On summary judgment, Dell and its co-defendants pursued the theory that Lucent
interfered with their MPEG LA Portfolio Licenses by preventing them from receiving a license to
the Video Coding Patents. (Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 20.) But this Court properly granted summary

judgment in favor of Lucent because, at the time of Lucent’s alleged “interference,” the defendants

2

had no contractual right to the Video Coding Patents under their licenses with MPEG LA. (Id. at 20-

3

21.) Accordingly, this Court held that Lucent did not interfere with MPEG LA’s performance of any

4

contractual obligation to the defendants. (Id.)

5

Dell makes no attempt to demonstrate clear error in that ruling. Rather, Dell raises an

6

entirely new theory of tortious interference with contract, based on the MPEG LA Agreement

7

Among Licensors rather than Dell’s MPEG LA Portfolio License. Dell Br. at 15-16. As an initial

8

matter, Dell cannot seek reconsideration based on arguments that it failed to present during the

9

summary judgment proceedings. See Jackson, 2007 WL 2802171 at *1 (“In the absence of new

10

evidence or a change in the law, as is the case here, a party may not use a motion for reconsideration

11

to present new arguments or claims not raised in a summary judgment motion.”). Moreover, Dell

12

has identified no authority for the proposition that Dell can assert a tortious interference with

13

contract claim based on a contract to which it is not even a party.4

14

Dell’s new tortious interference argument fails on the merits as well. Contrary to Dell’s

15

assertion, Alcatel never had an obligation to license the Video Coding Patents. Hence, Dell can

16

present no evidence that Alcatel failed to perform a contractual obligation to MPEG LA. At most,

17

Alcatel’s obligation to MPEG LA has been to license any essential patents that it acquires the right

18

to license, after the point in time at which such right is acquired. But because Alcatel never acquired

19

the right to license the Video Coding Patents, Alcatel never incurred an obligation to license those

20

patents.

21

Absent any proof that Alcatel failed to perform its obligations to MPEG LA — let alone

22

proof that Lucent caused that failure — this Court’s summary judgment ruling cannot be considered

23

clearly erroneous, even under Dell’s new theory. At bottom, Dell alleges that Lucent prevented

24

Alcatel from incurring an obligation to license the Video Coding Patents — not that Lucent caused

25
26
27
28

4 Although Dell and its co-defendants are parties to MPEG LA Patent Portfolio Licenses, none of
the defendants is a party to the Agreement Among Licensors. Nor can they have rights as third
party beneficiaries to the Agreement Among Licensors, because the agreement expressly
prohibits such rights. See Blackburn Decl. Ex. 1 at 27 (§ 8.10).

Dell Presents No Basis For Reconsideration Of This Court’s Grant Of Summary
Judgment Dismissing Its Co-Defendants’ Unclean Hands Defenses.

Dell offers no new arguments concerning the equitable defense of unclean hands.6 Instead,
Dell tries to manufacture a legal error warranting reconsideration by mischaracterizing this Court’s
summary judgment analysis. Contrary to Dell’s reconsideration arguments, this Court did not hold
that the equitable defense of unclean hands requires proof of “conduct [that] would have had a
dispositive impact on the issues in the litigation.” Dell Br. at 18. Nor did this Court’s summary
judgment grant turn on the undisputed fact that Dell and its co-defendants were not directly harmed
by Lucent’s allegedly wrongful conduct — i.e., Lucent’s purported failure to disclose to certain
government agencies its intent to assign the Video Coding Patents.7 Id.
On the contrary, this Court granted summary judgment in favor of Lucent and MPT because
the defendants failed to come forward with evidence demonstrating that Lucent’s alleged misconduct
affected the equities between the parties in the instant litigation. (See Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 13-14.)
As this Court correctly noted, application of the doctrine of unclean hands is reserved for “violations
of conscience [that] in some measure affect the equitable relations between the parties in respect of
5 Dell’s reliance on Velop, Inc. v. Kaplan, et al., 301 N.J. Super. 32 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 1997),
is misplaced. In Velop, unlike here, the party accused of interference with a contract actually
caused a failure of performance by a third party — i.e., the purchaser. See Velop, 301 N.J.
Super. at 926 (“[T]he excessive soil removal was the cause of the Kaplans’ loss of their contract
with Velop.”).) As discussed above, Dell cannot establish that critical element of a tortious
interference with contract claim. Indeed, the summary judgment record contains no proof that
any party failed to perform any obligation under any contract.
6 Indeed, Dell never asserted an unclean hands defense in this case until after this Court had
granted summary judgment in favor of MPT and Lucent on that defense. (Compare Dell Br. at
17 n. 10 with Ex. B, Sept. 26, 2007 Hr’g Tr. at 149-150.) That fact alone warrants denial of
Dell’s motion for reconsideration of this Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of MPT
and Lucent on the unclean hands defense.

Ample authority establishes that an unclean hands defense fails absent proof of personal harm
to the defendant, See, e.g., Hopper v. Fin. Mgmt. Sys., Inc., Civ. A. No. 96-456 (TAF), 1997 WL
31101, at *3 (D.D.C. Jan. 23, 1997) (“[T]he unclean hands defense requires a defendant to show
that he himself — not a third party — has been harmed by the plaintiff’s conduct.”).
Accordingly, even if this Court’s summary judgment grant rested on the absence of harm to the
defendants — which it did not — such authority disposes of Dell’s contention that this Court
committed a clear error of law.

established maxim, this Court committed no clear legal error.

4

Nor can Dell demonstrate that this Court committed clear error in concluding that the

5

summary judgment record lacked proof sufficient to establish that Lucent’s alleged misconduct

6

impacted the equities between the parties in this case. This Court’s October 1, 2007 Order sets forth

7

numerous grounds — including failures of proof by the defendants — that amply support the

8

summary judgment grant. Specifically, the Court found that:

9

•

the defendants offered no evidence that the concerned government agencies would have

10

taken any different action with regard to the Lucent-Alcatel merger had they been aware of

11

Lucent’s alleged misstatements;

12

•

13
14

the defendants offered no proof that the fate of the Video Coding Patents would have been
different than it is now if the concerned government agencies had taken any action;

•

the defendants offered no proof that the eventual public disclosure of the formation of MPT

15

and transfer of the Video Coding Patents had any actual impact on the approvals granted by

16

government agencies; and

17

•

the defendants offered no proof that — had they known of Lucent’s plan to transfer the

18

Video Coding Patents — they would have sought or been able to take actions to prevent the

19

assignment.

20

In moving for reconsideration, Dell simply reiterates the same unsupported allegations and

21

speculations that the defendants offered in opposing summary judgment. See Dell Br. at 17-19. As

22

such, Dell does not — and cannot — rectify the deficiencies in the summary judgment record that

23

are fatal to an unclean hands defense. In sum, because Dell has demonstrated no clear error in this

No Good Cause Exists To Certify This Court’s License And Unclean Hands
Rulings For Interlocutory Appeal.

While 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) provides a mechanism by which litigants can bring an immediate
appeal of a non-final order upon the consent of both the district court and the court of appeals, the
Supreme Court has established that interlocutory appeal is reserved for “exceptional circumstances
[that] justify a departure from the basic policy of postponing appellate review until after the entry of
a final judgment.” Coopers & Lybrand v Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 475 (1978) (superseded on other
grounds); see also United States Rubber Co. v. Wright, 359 F.2d 784, 785 (9th Cir. 1966) (“The
legislative history of [1292(b)] indicates that it was to be used only in extraordinary cases….”).
Accordingly, a party seeking certification for interlocutory appeal bears the burden of persuading the
court that exceptional circumstances warrant interlocutory appeal. See Aktiebolag v. Waukesha
Cutting Tools, Inc., 640 F. Supp. 1139, 1141 (E.D. Wis. 1986). To meet that burden, a movant must
demonstrate that (1) the pertinent order involves a controlling question of law, (2) a substantial
difference of opinion exists as to that question of law, and (3) an immediate appeal of the order may
materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b); see also
Abbott Labs. v. Syntron Bioresearch Inc., No. 98-CV-2359 H (POR), 2000 WL 33967724, at *13
(S.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2000).
Here, Dell does not remotely approach its burden of establishing that this Court’s summary
judgment rulings on the defenses of license and unclean hands are appropriate for interlocutory
appeal. Rather, Dell offers only a superficial argument for certification, proclaiming that this
Court’s rulings concern a “controlling issue of law” without any explanation, let alone support. Dell
ignores the “substantial difference of opinion” requirement altogether. Dell has offered no evidence
that there is a substantial difference of opinion, such as conflicting opinions among the courts,
8 In seeking reconsideration, Dell also ignores the fact that the doctrine of unclean hands is
equitable in nature and therefore resides within the sound discretion of the district court. See
Princess Cruises, Inc. v. U.S., 397 F.3d 1359, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (“The trial court has broad
discretion under the doctrine of unclean hands.”). While Dell may disagree with this Court’s
decision not to exercise its discretion here, Dell’s dissatisfaction with this Court’s decision
hardly constitutes extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration.

regarding the legal standards for the license or unclean hands defenses.9 And as for advancing the

4

fact that the February trial involves three other patents not impacted by this Court’s summary

judgment rulings. An interlocutory appeal of this Court’s license and unclean hands rulings

6

concerning the Video Coding Patents therefore lacks any potential for advancing the ultimate

termination of the litigation as a whole. In sum, no exceptional circumstances exist to justify an

A party's strong disagreement with the Court's ruling is not sufficient for there to be a
“substantial ground for difference;” the proponent of an appeal must make some greater
showing. See Kern-Tulare Water Dist. v. Bakersfield, 634 F. Supp. 656, 667 (E.D. Cal. 1986),
aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 828 F.2d 514 (9th Cir. 1987). Courts have held
that § 1292(b) requires that the difference of opinion be between and among judicial bodies. See,
e.g., Environmental Protection Info. Ctr. v. Pacific Lumber Co., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6674,
*14-16 (N.D. Cal. 2004).
10 As explained in MPT’s briefing in opposition to the defendants’ trust-related summary
judgment motions, even if the defendants became licensed to the Video Coding Patents pursuant
to their agreements with MPEG LA when Lucent and Alcatel merged, their infringement liability
in this action cannot be extinguished. (See Case No. 02-CV-2060 D.I. 2016, Aug. 31, 2007
MPT’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motions For Summary Judgment On Trust-Related Defenses
And Counterclaims at 22-23.) For example, the defendants’ MPEG LA licenses are limited to
MPEG-2 implementations, whereas MPT’s infringement allegations extend to other video
compression technologies, such as WMV-9/VC-1. (See id.) Moreover, the defendants’ MPEG
LA licenses would not retroactively insulate them from infringement liability for the period
before the Lucent-Alcatel merger. (See id.) Indeed, because this Court declined to rule on “the
issues of retroactivity and specificity to MPEG-2 products” concerning the defendants’ alleged
licenses, the proposed interlocutory appeal cannot even resolve the parties’ litigation over the
Video Coding Patents. (Oct. 1, 2007 Order at 12, n. 2.)
