TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on December 7, 2007 at 9:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as
the matter may be heard, in the Courtroom of the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff of the United States
District Court, located at 880 Front Street, San Diego, California 92101-8900, defendant and
counterclaimant Dell Inc. ("Dell") will move, and hereby does move, pursuant to Local Civil Rule
7.1(i)(2) and this Court's "inherent jurisdiction to modify, alter, or revoke" any non-final order, see
United States v. Martin, 226 F.3d 1042, 1049 (9th Cir. 2000), for reconsideration of certain portions
of this Court's October 1, 2007 Order Granting In Part and Denying In Part Parties' Motions For
Summary Judgment Regarding Defendants' Affirmative Defenses And Counterclaims Pertaining
To The Transfer Of The Group 1 Patents To The Multimedia Patent Trust (the "Oct. 1 Order").
Specifically, Dell moves for reconsideration of the following rulings: (1) Order denying
Defendants' motion for summary judgment, and granting the motion by plaintiff and counterclaim
defendant Multimedia Patent Trust ("MPT") for summary judgment, on Defendants' defense of
license; (2) Order denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment, and granting the motion by
plaintiff and counterclaim defendant Lucent Technologies, Inc. ("Lucent") for summary judgment,
on Dell's and Gateway's counterclaim for tortious interference with contract; and (3) Order denying
Defendants' motion for summary judgment, and granting MPT's motion for summary judgment, on
Defendants' unclean hands defense. In the alternative, in the event the Court denies Dell's motion
for reconsideration, Dell moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1292(b), for certification of the Court's
ruling on Defendants' license and unclean defenses for interlocutory review.

Dell's motion is made on the following grounds. First, with respect to the Court's order
regarding Defendants' license defenses, Dell moves on three grounds: (i) the Court committed an
error of law in misconstruing Federal Circuit case law when it concluded that a patentee may
effectively assign its patents to another party even where it retains an unfettered right to veto any
future sales of patents; (ii) the Court's Oct. 1 Order failed to consider other significant reservations
of rights by Lucent, which defeat assignment; and (iii) the Court misapplied the summary judgment
standard in weighing the contradictory evidence regarding Lucent's compliance with the Merger

Agreement between Alcatel S.A. and Lucent. Second, with respect to the Court's order regarding

Case 3:07-cv-02000-H-CAB Document 29 _ Filed 10/31/2007 Page4of4

Defendants' tortious interference with contract counterclaims, Dell moves for reconsideration on
the ground that the Court erred as a matter of law in holding that an interference with a prospective
right under an existing contract would not support an interference with contract claim. Third, with
respect to the Court's order regarding Defendants' unclean hands defenses, Dell moves for
reconsideration on the grounds that (i) the Court erred as a matter of law in holding that the unclean
hands doctrine is applicable only to conduct that would have had a dispositive impact on the issues
in the litigation; and (ii) new facts that have arisen since the Court's Oct. 1 Order -- specifically, a
complaint filed by MPEG LA, L.L.C. seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the Video Coding
Patents are part of the MPEG LA patent pool -- demonstrate that, but for Plaintiffs' fraudulent
concealment and misleading public statements, action could have been taken by MPEG LA that
would have had a dispositive impact on this litigation.

Dell's alternative request for certification of the Court's orders with respect to Defendants'
license and unclean hands defenses is based on the grounds that these orders concern controlling
issues of law to which there is a substantial difference of opinion among the parties, and an
immediate appeal of the Court's orders on these issues may materially advance the ultimate
termination of this litigation.

This motion is based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum of Points and
Authorities in support thereof, the declaration of James S. Blackburn filed concurrently herewith,
the pleadings, records and files in this action, and upon such other and further evidence and

argument as may properly be presented prior to and at the hearing on the Motion.
