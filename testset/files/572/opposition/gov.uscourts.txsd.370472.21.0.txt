PLAINTIFF JOHN NELSON’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’
REPLY BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION
TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION
OR, ALTERNATIVELY, MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
COMES NOW Plaintiff John Nelson and files this, his Response to Defendants’ Reply
Brief in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction or,
Alternatively, Motion to Transfer Venue, and respectfully shows the Court as follows:
I.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
A.

Defendants are Subject to Personal Jurisdiction in Texas

Defendants have failed to carry “the burden of negating all bases of personal
jurisdiction.” Bellorin v. Bridgestone Firestone, Inc., 236 F. Supp. 2d 670, 678 (W.D. Tex.
2001). Other than making the conclusory, self-serving statement that Defendants maintain a
separate accounting system from their local marketing company, Destron, Inc. d/b/a MGM
Mirage Marketing (hereinafter “MGM MM”), Defendants offer no rebuttal evidence for their
contention that they are not subject to jurisdiction.
Defendants offer no evidence that MGM MM maintains a separate accounting system
other than a conclusory affidavit submitted by Bryan Wright. (See Exhibit A to Defs.’ Reply

Br.). In that affidavit, Wright simply states that MGM MM “maintains its own accounting
records separate and apart from MGM Mirage and every other MGM Mirage affiliated entity”
and that MGM MM “maintains separate bank accounts, payroll records, personnel records and
files its own tax returns.”

(See id.).

These conclusory statements are not facts and are

inadequate to satisfy Defendants’ burden of proof that jurisdiction is improper in Texas. See
Douglass v. USAA, 79 F.3d 1415, 1429 (5th Cir. 1996) (conclusory, speculative and
unsubstantiated assertions will not satisfy the party’s burden). Further, other than Wright’s
affidavit, Defendants have presented no evidence to rebut Plaintiff’s other contentions that
jurisdiction is proper in Texas. Instead, Defendants completely ignore Plaintiff’s clear, detailed
evidence of Defendants’ control over MGM MM’s employees, daily business activities, debt
collection, advertising, solicitation, etc., all of which are sufficient to confer jurisdiction over
Defendants in the State of Texas.
Defendants also attempt an “end run” around the personal jurisdiction analysis by
focusing on each of Defendants’ contacts in isolation, thereby concluding that jurisdiction is
improper. (See Defs.’ Reply Br., at pp. 12-13). Courts are clear their task is to evaluate a
defendant’s contacts with the forum state over a reasonable number of years, up to the date the
suit was filed, not to consider each contact in isolation as if it were the only available fact.
Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., 197 F.3d 694, 717 (5th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff
would agree that each contact, standing alone, would be insufficient to confer jurisdiction.
However, as is readily apparent from Plaintiff’s Response, that situation is not before this Court.
In fact, the opposite is true: Defendants’ maintain such continuous and systematic contacts
through its employees’ sales trips, marketing campaign, interactive website and solicitation in

2

Texas that Defendants should “reasonably anticipate being hailed into court” here. Worldwide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295 (1980).
Defendants have clearly failed to carry their burden and negate all bases of personal
jurisdiction in this case. Therefore, this Court should deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for
Lack of Personal Jurisdiction.
B.

Venue Is Proper in the Southern District of Texas

The facts of this case are straightforward and center on activities that took place between
Plaintiff John Nelson and the MGM Defendants. Simply stated, Plaintiff has been defrauded.
As stated above, jurisdiction is proper over Defendants in the State of Texas. Pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1391(a) and (c), venue in a diversity suit lies against a corporate defendant in any
district where the corporation “resides,” and a corporation resides in any district in which it is
subject to jurisdiction. Gorman v. Grand Casino of Louisiana, 1 F. Supp. 2d 656, 660 (E.D. Tex.
1998). Thus, Defendants reside in this District and venue is proper in the Southern District of
Texas, Houston Division.
Defendants contend this case must be transferred “for the convenience of parties and
witnesses” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).

However, Defendants bear the burden of

demonstrating to the Court that, in its sound discretion, the Court should transfer the action.
Peteet v. Dow Chemical Co., 868 F.2d 1428, 1436 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 493 U.S. 935 (1989);
Time, Inc. v. Manning, 366 F.2d 690, 698 (5th Cir. 1966). The Courts’ determination of whether
to transfer a case is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. U.S. v. Hemmingson, 157
F.3d 347, 356-57 (5th Cir. 1998).

3

1.

Convenience of the witnesses.

Defendants argue at great lengths that convenience of the witnesses is the most important
and conclusive factor in determining whether a case should be transferred pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1404(a). However, the trial court must consider “all relevant factors to determine
whether or not on balance the litigation would more conveniently proceed and the interests of
justice be better served by transfer to a different forum.” Peteet, 868 F.2d at 1436. In the instant
case, Defendants fail to prove with particularity the reasons why they are inconvenienced in the
Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. See Young v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 601
F. Supp. 399, 401 (N.D. Tex. 1984). Defendants have the burden of demonstrating why the
forum should be changed, and “carry a strong burden to prove that [the convenience] factors
clearly favor such a change.” See In re Triton Ltd. Securities Litigation, 70 F. Supp. 2d 678, 688
(E.D. Tex. 1999).
In support of their contention that venue is more convenient in Nevada, Defendants list
“over 20 MGM Grand employees with knowledge regarding [Nelson’s] gambling activities at
MGM Grand.” (See Defs.’ Reply Br., at p. 4). As admitted by Defendants, the twenty persons
listed as witnesses are employees of the MGM Grand. However, Defendants fail to identify
which, if any, of these employees are key witnesses, or to provide this Court with a brief
summary of their testimony to demonstrate why it would be inconvenient for them to testify in
Houston, Texas. See SMI-Owen Steel Co. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 113 F. Supp. 2d
1101, 1104 (S.D. Tex. 2000); see also Young, 601 F. Supp. at 401 (stating that movants “must
clearly specify the key witnesses to be called and must make a general statement of what their
testimony will cover”). Defendants merely submitted an affidavit of Mark Whitmore, which
names the witnesses and that they had “some involvement with Nelson” or “knowledge

4

concerning the events underlying Nelson’s allegations.” (See Affidavit of Mark Whitmore,
attached to Defs.’ Motion to Dismiss as Exhibit C). Defendants have failed to introduce any
evidence that testimony of even one of these twenty employees is necessary for trial in this
matter. See SMI-Owen, 113 F. Supp. 2d at 1101. As noted by the Young court:
If a party has merely made a general allegation that witnesses will be necessary
without identifying them and indicating what their testimony will be, the
application for transfer will be denied.
See Young, 601 F. Supp. at 401-02 (emphasis added). In addition, where, as here, witnesses are
employees of the defendant, this Court has held that their convenience is given less weight
because the party will be able to compel their testimony at trial. See Continental Airlines v.
American Airlines, 805 F. Supp. 1392, 1397 (S.D. Tex. 1992).
Further, the convenience of “one key witness may outweigh a great number of less
important witnesses.” See Dupre v. Spanier Marine Corp., 810 F. Supp. 823, 825 (S.D. Tex.
1993); Young, 601 F. Supp. at 401. As Defendants readily note, the one key witness to this cause
of action is John Nelson, who resides in Houston, Texas. Although Defendants are quick to
allege that “Nelson is a multi-millionaire who is certainly not inconvenienced” because he
routinely travels to Las Vegas, Defendants fail to disclose to this Court that they paid for all of
his trips to Las Vegas over the past ten years, including the trip made the basis of this lawsuit, to
entice him to gamble at the MGM Grand Casino. (See Defs.’ Reply Br., at p. 5).
In addition, Plaintiff will call employees of Southwest Bank of Texas as witnesses since
one of his causes of action arises out of the fact that he ordered Defendants to make a wire
transfer of his money from the MGM Grand Casino to Southwest Bank of Texas in Houston on
three occasions, two of which Defendants failed to execute. As non-party witnesses, the court
has greater concern for their convenience. See Mohamed v. Mazda Motor Corp., 90 F. Supp. 2d

5

757, 774 (E.D. Tex. 2000). The testimony of the bank employees will include wire transfer
procedures, receipt of any wire transfers from Defendants, whether any attempts were made by
Defendants to transfer Plaintiff’s money, and the length of time it takes for the bank to send
and/or receive wire transfers.

Plaintiff will also call Joan Riley, Matt Davis, and other

employees of MGM MM who work in the Dallas and Houston offices.

The MGM MM

employees are familiar with the Defendants’ comps policies, Nevada gaming regulations and
statutes, and are licensed by the state of Nevada. Moreover, as both Riley and Davis testified,
MGM MM shares databases with Defendants, which contain detailed information about
Defendants’ customers, including Plaintiff. (See Deposition of Joan Riley, attached to Pl.’s
Resp. as Exhibit C, at p. p. 44; Deposition of Matt Davis, attached to Pl.’s Resp. as Exhibit E, at
p. 37). This information is discoverable and readily accessible by the parties here in Houston.
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ have failed to prove with particularity the reasons
why they would be inconvenienced in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. Thus,
the convenience of the parties and the witnesses does not support transfer of this case to Nevada.
2.

The plaintiff’s choice of forum is a paramount consideration.

Contrary to Defendants’ assertions that a plaintiff’s choice of forum is not accorded great
deference, the law states otherwise. “A plaintiff’s choice of a proper forum is a paramount
consideration in any determination of a transfer request, and that choice should not be lightly
disturbed.” See Young, 601 F. Supp. at 401 (emphasis added); see also Ledoux v. Isle of Capri
Casinos, Inc., 218 F. Supp. 2d 835, 837 (E.D. Tex. 2002) (stating that the “plaintiff’s choice of
forum is given a great deal of deference in § 1404(a) analysis”); Engel v. W.R. Berkley Corp.,
2001 WL 238113, at *7 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 6, 2001)(stating that the plaintiff’s choice of forum is
given paramount consideration in determining whether a case should be transferred). Further, as

6

recognized by one court, the “judicial system inherently provides a plaintiff with his choice of
forum.” See Triton, 70 F. Supp. 2d at 688. As a resident of Houston, Texas, Plaintiff’s choice to
litigate his suit here should not be disturbed unless the balance of factors weighs strongly in
Defendants’ favor. See United Sonics, Inc. v. Shock, 661 F. Supp. 681, 683 (W.D. Tex. 1986).
As stated above and in more detail in Plaintiff’s Response, Defendants’ have failed to carry their
burden that this case should be transferred to the District of Nevada. Thus, Plaintiff’s choice to
litigate this case in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division should not be disturbed.
See Dupre, 810 F. Supp. at 828 (stating that “it is this Court’s consistent practice to honor a
plaintiff’s choice of forum, where factually justified”).
3.

Choice of law.

Defendants assert repeatedly that this case is governed by Nevada law. (See Defs.’ Reply
Br., at pp. 7-8). Although applicable law is one consideration in the Court’s analysis, this factor
is generally given little weight. See IBEW-NECA Southwestern Health & Benefit Fund v.
Gurule, 2003 WL 21281652, at *5 (N.D. Tex. May 22, 2003) (whether or not a foreign
jurisdiction’s law applies weighs neither in favor nor against transfer of the case); Engel, 2001
WL 238113, at *8 (the argument that another forum’s law may apply “carries little weight” and
that courts are “frequently called upon to apply the laws of other jurisdictions in diversity
cases”). As such, the fact that Nevada law may apply to some of Plaintiff’s claims in this case
does not support transfer to the District of Nevada.

II.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction or,
Alternatively, Motion to Transfer Venue should be denied. Defendants are clearly subject to
jurisdiction in Texas through their relationship with MGM MM and their continuous and
systematic contacts with the State of Texas.
In addition, the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the other factors clearly
outweigh any basis for transfer to Nevada. Further, as Defendants are corporations subject to
jurisdiction in the State of Texas, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a) and (c), a corporation resides
in any district in which it is subject to jurisdiction. Thus, venue is proper in this Court and the
interests of justice will best be served by denying Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue.
