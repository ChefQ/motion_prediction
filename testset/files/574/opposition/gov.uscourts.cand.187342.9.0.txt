Case 4:06-cv-07754-SBA Document9 Filed 12/20/2006 Page 3 of 16

I.
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Helio's papers artificially manufacture the appearance of a crisis in order to justify the
extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order; this type of gamesmanship on the eve of
Christmas week should not be rewarded. More than two months ago, on October 12, 2006, at the
major consumer technology tradeshow in New York, Palm publicly launched its holiday
advertising campaign that is the subject of Helio's complaint - plaintiff stood by and did nothing.
More than three weeks ago, Palm launched tens of thousands of outdoor-advertising units
throughout the country, including billboards, mass-transit advertisements, and taxi-tops, after
expending millions of dollars. Again, plaintiff stood by and did nothing. Yet now, with less than
a week before Christmas, knowing that Palm's marketing and legal resources are least available,
and without so much as a phone call or a letter requesting a change in Palm's advertising, plaintiff
rushes into Court and demands an extraordinary level of relief that would cripple Palm's business
during the critical holiday season. Plaintiff's delays in bringing this action and the secrecy under
which it prepared its papers speak volumes. If Helio were truly suffering irreparable injury as it
now tells the Court, it could have sought relief over two months ago. It did not. At a bare
minimum, it could have sent a cease and desist letter to Palm on December 12, 2006, when Helio
claims it first "discovered" Palm's international advertising campaign. Again, it did not. The
request for TRO is calibrated, instead, to maximize the disruption to Palm, rather than to preserve
any status quo.

Moreover, plaintiff's request demands that Palm immediately dismantle an international
advertising campaign with more than 20,000 outdoor advertising units-a Herculean task at any
time, let alone during the holiday season. This is not a request to preserve the status quo, but to
proactively injure Palm on less than 24-hour's notice. This demand is as impractical as it is
unjustified.

The campaigns are not confusingly similar. Palm's advertising campaign is focused on its
Treo mobile device, which is a well-known mark. Palm's campaign includes the slogan - in

highly stylized and distinctive font - "Not just a cell phone. A Treo." The Treo is emphasized

Case 4:06-cv-07754-SBA Document9 Filed 12/20/2006 Page 4 of 16

and is the centerpiece of the images. Helio, however, in its papers refers only to the first four
words of the slogan, completely ignoring the phrase "A Treo" that appears in every single instance
of the campaign. Helio's description of Palm's campaign without reference to "A Treo" is
fundamentally misleading.

Tellingly, after having months to develop its case and after seeking such an incredible
remedy, Helio has not provided a single scrap of evidence to support its claim of "consumer
confusion." Plaintiff has not provided a single expert declaration regarding confusion, linguistics,
likelihood of harm, market conditions, or other critical issues that it asks the Court to consider.
Helio certainly had time to conduct a consumer survey to support its claims of confusion, yet it
has provided the Court with no evidence to support its claims. Indeed, plaintiff failed to cite a
single email, phone call, conversation, or offhand comment from any consumer indicating that
Palm's advertising has resulted in any type of confusion. Instead, plaintiff simply relies on blind
speculation in seeking to derail Palm's advertising and disrupt sales during the critical holiday
shopping season. If plaintiff seeks such an extraordinary remedy, it should be required to provide
the Court with substantial, meaningful evidence to support its claims. It has not and a TRO is not
justified.

The prejudice to Palm if the TRO is granted would be devastating and far outweighs the
comparable harm to Helio of having to wait a short period for a date for a preliminary injunction
hearing. Indeed, by plaintiff's own admission, it has lost over $117,000,000 in the past year alone
and has never made a profit. If an injunction were to issue during the peak holiday shopping
season, Palm's losses would be staggering, yet Palm would likely never have any type of damage
remedy to recover from Helio, a company that is apparently teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.

Plaintiff itself delayed bringing this action for over two months and Palm should be
afforded more than 12 hours to address the complexities of the issues surrounding a $25 million
international advertising campaign. Because there are no circumstances that justify the
extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order and because Helio cannot establish that it

will suffer irreparable injury, Palm respectfully requests that the Court deny plaintiff's application

and adopt Palm's briefing schedule for a preliminary injunction hearing in mid-January.

Il.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
A. Background

Palm, Inc., headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a leader in mobile computing that
was founded in 1992. (Hancock Decl., 3.) The company's products include Palm(R) Treo0x2122
smartphones, Palm LifeDrive0x2122 mobile managers and Palm handheld computers, as well as
software, services and accessories. (/d.) Palm sells its products through select Internet, retail,
reseller, and wireless operator channels throughout the world, and at Palm Retail Stores and Palm
online stores. (/d.) For nearly 15 years, Palm has developed, supported, and protected a brand
that is known worldwide for innovation and quality and since its founding, Palm has shipped more
than 34 million mobile-computing products. (/d.) The Palm "Treo" trademark was registered
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on August 29, 2001. Ud.)

B. Development of the Palm Campaign

The development of Palm's current advertising campaign (hereinafter the "Campaign'"),
began nearly two years ago at the beginning of 2005, prior to Helio's existence. (Jd, 94.) At that
point, Palm's advertising agency, AKQA first developed the slogan, "NOT A CELL PHONE. A
TREO" and presented it to Palm. (/d.) At that time, AKQA created 14 advertising mockups that
each contained the tagline "not a cell phone. a Treo." (/d., Ex. B.) This tagline provided the
foundation of Palm's current advertising slogan, "NOT JUST A CELL PHONE. A TREO." This
final language was adopted by Palm in May 2006. (/d, 4 4.)

During the Digital Life electronics expo in New York City on October 12, 2006, a
significant electronics-industry event, Palm publicly launched the slogan, "NOT JUST A CELL
PHONE. A TREO." (d., 95.) At the event, Palm displayed a large banner over its exhibition
booth with the Campaign slogan. (/d., Ex. C.) Industry journalists covering the event, such as
James Miller, acknowledged Palm's new advertising campaign and wrote publicly about the
association of the slogan with Palm's new Treo 680 smartphone. (/d., Ex. D.) In an October 12,

2006 publicly-available online article discussing the launch of Palm's new product, Mr. Miller

stated, "To support the roll out of the Treo 680, Palm is going to roll out $25 million advertising
and marketing campaign. The main tag line will be 'Not Just A Cell Phone. A Treo.'" (Ud.)

At no point during the development of the Campaign were Helio's current claims, "Don't
call it a phone" and "Don't call us a phone company" ever discussed, considered or raised by
Palm. (/d., 46.) Palm's Campaign was never intended to have any relationship to Helio's current
advertising claims, nor was Palm's Campaign ever intended or expected to suggest any
relationship between Palm's well-known products and those of Helio. (/d.) Palm's Campaign and
its original slogan, "not just a phone. a Treo," were conceived prior to Helio's existence, let alone
Helio's current advertising campaign. (/d.)

C. Cost and Scope of the Palm Campaign

The slogan "NOT JUST A CELL PHONE. A TREO." is part of a $25 million print,
outdoor and online advertising campaign designed to promote Palm's Treo 680 smartphone. (/d.,
48.) The Campaign includes significant expenditures on outdoor advertising through billboards,
bus shelters, taxi tops and "wild postings" as well as on print advertising through newspapers and
magazines, in both the United States and Europe. (/d.) Outdoor advertising was launched on
November 27, 2006 and is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2006. (/d.)

Billboard, mass-transit station and taxi-top displays have already been launched in the top
10 advertising markets throughout the United States at a cost of more than $3,500,000. (Ud, 7 9.)
Print has also begun to run, of which approximately $3,500,000 has been spent to date. Palm has
also begun using "`street teams" that utilize the slogan in New York, Los Angeles and San
Francisco. (/d.)

All outdoor advertising associated with the Campaign, including billboards, taxi-top
displays and mass-transit displays, is scheduled to run only through December 31, 2006. (/d., 0x00A7
10.) Palm does not intend to run any such advertising beyond that date. (/d.)

At acost of more than $400,000, the Campaign also includes custom-designed and
manufactured interactive kiosks, which permit people to select and view category-specific content

on larger-than-life Treo smartphones. (/d., 0x00A7 11.) These kiosks contain a live monitor in place of

the Treo screen and are located at bus stops and window fronts in major metropolitan cities,

including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. (/d.) At a cost of approximately
$2,000,000 thus far, the Campaign also includes significant expenditures on online advertising,
including materials on Fandango, Google, The Onion, Orbitz, and Yahoo! (/d. 412.)

The billboards, taxi top and mass-transit advertising has been posted since November 27,
2006. (/d.{ 13.) There are over 21,000 of these outdoor units that can not be removed before the
scheduled media contract expiration date of December 31, 2006. (/d.) Print insertions in weekly
publications typically require at least six weeks' notice for removal, depending on the publication.
Online publication typically requires at least two weeks' written notice for removal. (/d.) The
Campaign is not being broadcast on any television stations, and Palm has no plans to do so. Ud. 0x00A7
15.)
D. Notice Provided by Helio

The first instance in which Helio provided any notice of concern with Palm's Campaign
was on December 19, 2006, when plaintiff's complaint and application were sent to in-house
counsel for Helio. (/d., 4 17.) Helio made no contact with anyone at Palm regarding the
Campaign prior to that time. (/d.) Outside counsel was not provided with a complete copy of
plaintiff's moving papers and declarations until approximately 5:00 p.m. on December 19, 2006.

Il.
DISCUSSION

"The basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and
the inadequacy of legal remedies." Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982);
Stanley v. University of So. Calif., 13 F.3d 1313, 1320 (9th Cir. 1994). An injunction cannot issue
as a matter of course: "In each case, a court must balance the competing claims of injury and must
consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requesting relief." Amoco
Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, Alaska, 480 US. 531, 535 (1984). "The critical element"
for the Court to consider is the "relative hardship to the parties. If the balance of harm tips
decidedly toward the plaintiff, then the plaintiff need not show as robust a likelihood of success on
the merits as when the balance tips less decidedly." State of Alaksa v. Native Village of Venetie,
856 F.2d 1384, 1389 (9th Cir. 1988).

A. A_TRO Should Not Issue Because Plaintiff Has Not Demonstrated That It Will Suffer

Irreparable Injury

Here, plaintiff cannot establish that it will suffer irreparable injury that cannot be
compensated through legal remedies. Instead of providing this Court with actual evidence that it
has or will suffer irreparable injury, plaintiff instead mistakenly cites multiple cases for the
proposition that in a trademark infringement claim, a presumption of irreparable injury should
arise from a showing of a likelihood of success on the merits. (Application, pp. 11, 12.) Plaintiff
fails to address the fact that it waited over two months to bring this action, and the courts have
repeatedly held "[{I]ack of diligence, standing alone, may...preclude the granting of preliminary
injunctive relief, because it goes primarily to the issue of irreparable harm...." Majorica, S.A. v.
R.H. Macy & Co., Inc., 762 F.2d 7, 8 (2d Cir. 1985); see also Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound
Products, 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding that in trade dress infringement case, delay in
seeking preliminary injunctive relief negates any presumption of irreparable harm).

Defendant publicly launched the allegedly infringing slogan on October 12, 2006, at a
significant electronics industry event in New York City. (Hancock Decl., 45.) Now, more than
two months after Defendant's initial use of the slogan, plaintiff seeks emergency relief and
attempts to claim that it will suffer immediate and irreparable injury if such relief is not granted.
Plaintiff's actions speak louder than words and this disconnect cannot be resolved in favor of
plaintiff. "Significant delay in applying for injunctive relief in a trademark case tends to
neutralize any presumption that infringement alone will cause irreparable harm pending trial, and
such delay alone may justify denial of a preliminary injunction for trademark infringement."
Majorica, 762 F.2d at 8 (quoting Citibank, N_A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 276 (2d Cir. 1985)).

Absent the presumption of irreparable injury, plaintiff presents this Court with no evidence
to support its claim. Helio had more than two months to develop its case, yet plaintiff has not
identified a single consumer who has been confused by Palm's Campaign, nor has plaintiff
identified the loss of a single sale as a result of the Campaign. Plaintiff has not provided a single
expert declaration regarding market share, loss of sales, loss of profit, loss of goodwill, or any

other showing of threatened or ongoing injury. In short, plaintiff provided this Court with nothing

but speculation regarding its claim of irreparable injury and as the Court made clear in Simula, Inc.
v. Autoliv, Inc. 175 F.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999), an injunction "may only be granted when the
moving party has demonstrated a significant threat of irreparable injury...." There has been no
such showing here and a TRO should not issue with the lack of evidence necessary to justify this
extraordinary remedy.
B. A TRO Should Not Issue Because The Balance of Harms Does Not Favor Plaintiff

As above, plaintiff has not provided this Court with evidence to establish that the balance
of harms weighs in favor of the issuance of a TRO. Plaintiff has not submitted a single declaration
establishing that Helio has lost or will lose customers as a result of Palm's Campaign. Indeed, the
only substantive financial information that Plaintiff has provided is the admission that Helio has
never earned a profit and in the nine months leading up to September 30, 2006--prior to the time
that Palm's Campaign even began--Helio lost more that $117,000,000. (Weeks Decl., 4 33.)
Helio is a company with no profits, no proven track-record, and no reasonable basis to claim that
the balance of harms weighs in favor of dismantling Palm's international advertising Campaign
during the holiday season.

In stark contrast, the harm to Palm if a TRO were to issue would be devastating. To date,
Palm has spent nearly $10,000,000 in deploying advertising as part of the Campaign, including
outdoor billboards, mass-transit posters and displays, taxi-top displays, interactive kiosks,
magazine inserts, and online advertising. (Hancock Decl., 9-12.) This advertising is widely-
distributed throughout the United States and Europe, and consists of more than 21,000 individual
outdoor advertising units alone. (Id., { 13.) In short, an attempt to recall this type of advertising
would require massive manpower on the ground to pull individual advertisements throughout the
country and would result in Palm losing the core piece of advertising it is running during the
holiday shopping season which, as plaintiff itself admits is "the most important revenue-

generating period in the year for consumer products companies, specifically in the wireless

industry." (Weeks Decl., | 41.)
These factors clearly weigh against the issuance of a TRO; on one hand, Helio might suffer

loss of customers or goodwill, based upon unsupported allegations of confusion and speculative

harm, while Palm would suffer significant losses in the form of high costs in attempting to pull all
of its advertising, the loss of the advertising itself, and the loss of product sales during the critical
holiday shopping season with only a few days remaining before Christmas. Moreover, as Helio
itself admits that it lost $117,000,000 in the first three quarters of 2006 alone, Palm would almost
certainly have no means to collect any damages if and when Palm prevailed at the time of trial.
Faced with speculative harm on one side and immediate, substantial and crippling damages on the
other, the balance of hardships tips strongly in favor of Palm and a TRO should not issue.
C. A TRO Should Not Issue Because Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Likelihood of Success on

the Merits

Even if Helio could establish that it would suffer irreparable injury and that the balance of
hardships favored plaintiff, it cannot establish a likelihood of success on the merits to support the
issuance of a TRO. In order to analyze the likelihood of confusion in a trademark infringement
case, courts in the Ninth Circuit employ the eight-factor test set forth in AMF, Inc. v. Sleekcraft
Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979). An analysis of the relevant facts under this test
demonstrates that plaintiff has no likelihood of success.

1. Strength of the Mark

The first Sleekcraft factor for the Court to consider is the relative strength of plaintiff's
mark. Plaintiff's papers would lead the Court to believe that Helio pioneered the use of the "not a
phone" and "not a phone company" claims in May 2006. A simple Google search, however,
reveals that variations of these phrases have been used in reference to different phones, products,
and companies, including Palm, for at least the past three years, beginning in 2003. (Colt Decl., 0x00A7
3.) For example, in a Forbes article dated December 1, 2003, Palm's founder, Jeff Hawkins,
stated, "We're not a cell phone company...." (d., Ex. A.) Nonetheless, Helio now argues that it is
the senior user of the slogan "Don't call us a phone company." Because the very phrases over
which plaintiff now asserts ownership have been in use for an extended period of time by other
companies, including Palm, the strength of plaintiffs alleged marks does not weigh in favor of the

issuance of a TRO,
