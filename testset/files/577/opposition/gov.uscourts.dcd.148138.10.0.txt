THE SEC’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND
AUTHORITIES IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT
ROBERT ROWEN’S MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT
Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) submits this memorandum
of law in opposition to defendant Robert Rowen’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s Complaint. For
the reasons set forth below, the defendant’s motion should be denied.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Defendant Robert Rowen offered, executed and sold the common stock of e-Smart
Technologies, Inc. to public investors even though the stock was not registered with the SEC and
he was not registered as a broker. In so doing, he violated the stock registration provisions of
Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the broker-dealer registration
requirements of Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). 15
U.S.C. §§ 77e and 78o(a)(1).
Rowen moves to dismiss the Complaint under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure on the purported grounds that the SEC fails to state claims upon which relief can be

1

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 10 Filed 07/25/11 Page 2 of 9

granted, the Court lacks personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and venue in this district is
improper. The Court should deny his motion.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
The SEC’s Complaint alleges that defendant e-Smart Technologies, Inc. (“e-Smart”)
offered and sold millions of shares of unrestricted stock that were not registered or exempt from
registration. Complaint (“Cmpl.”) ¶¶ 61-71. e-Smart structured these sales of stock to appear to
be loans to IVI Smart Technologies, Inc. and Intermarket Ventures, Inc., which were affiliates of
e-Smart. The purported loans were guaranteed with pledges of e-Smart stock. Id. ¶¶ 64-68. IVI
Smart Technologies and Intermarket Ventures did not have the ability to repay the loans and, in
fact, not one of them was repaid. Id. ¶¶ 69-70. Instead, pursuant to the pledges, the public
investors who extended the loans received unrestricted e-Smart stock. Id. ¶ 67. These
transactions were not bona fide loans entitled to an exemption from the stock registration
requirement. Id. ¶ 71.
Defendant Mary Grace was the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of e-Smart. Id. ¶ 17. She was also the
President, CEO, and majority shareholder of IVI Smart Technologies and Intermarket Ventures.
Id. ¶¶ 19-20. Grace originated and engineered the bogus loan and pledge transactions. Id. ¶¶ 7274. From her home in the District of Columbia, she coordinated the transfer of the loan proceeds
from public investors to e-Smart and directed that, pursuant to the pledges, the transfer agent
issue certificates for unrestricted e-Smart stock to the investors. Id. ¶¶ 17, 73. The transfer
agent, at Grace’s direction, mailed the certificates to the investors or to Grace, for distribution to
the investors. Exhibits 2 and 3 to the Declaration of Thomas B. Rogers (“Rogers Decl.”). 1 The

The SEC is relying on the Rogers Declaration only to support its arguments pertaining to jurisdiction and venue.

2

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 10 Filed 07/25/11 Page 3 of 9

investors’ money was wired at Grace’s direction to an account in the name of e-Smart at a branch
of PNC Bank located in the District of Columbia. Rogers Decl. Exs 1, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Defendant Rowen solicited investors to enter into the transactions. Cmpl. ¶ 75. From
August 2005 through June 2006, he sold to investors more than 4.5 million shares of e-Smart
stock, netting e-Smart more than $350,000. Id. ¶ 75. He received a 5-10 percent commission in
the form of e-Smart stock. Id. ¶ 78. He solicited and executed these stock transactions even
though he was not registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered
broker-dealer. Id. ¶ 79.
ARGUMENT
I. STANDARD OF REVIEW.
Rule 8 “requires only ‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is
entitled to relief,’ in order to ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the
grounds upon which it rests.’” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)
(quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). A court should deny a motion to dismiss if
the complaint contains sufficient factual matter to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face.” Id. at 570. The court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construes
them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73
(1984); Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004).
The standard for a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is virtually
identical. Personal jurisdiction is established by specific factual allegations making a prima facie
showing of jurisdiction. GTE New Media Services, Inc. v. Ameritech Corp., 21 F. Supp. 2d 27,
36 (D.D.C. 1998), remanded on other grounds sub nom. GTE New Media Services, Inc. v.
BellSouth Corp., 199 F.3d 1343 (D.C. Cir. 2000). In determining personal and subject matter

3

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 10 Filed 07/25/11 Page 4 of 9

jurisdiction, the court may consider material outside the pleadings. Jackson v. District of
Columbia Department of Health, 2007 WL 1307891, *1 (D.D.C. May 3, 2007); Caesar v. United
States, 258 F. Supp. 2d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2003); Novak-Canzeri v. Al Saud, 864 F. Supp. 203, 206
(D.D.C. 1994).
Venue is proper “in the district where the offer or sale took place, if the defendant
participated therein,” or “in the district where any act or transaction constituting the violation
occurred.” 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(a), 78aa.
II. THE COMPLAINT STATES CLAIMS AGAINST
ROWEN UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED.
A. Section 5 Claim.
Section 5 of the Securities Act prohibits the offer or sale of securities in transactions that
are not registered with the SEC. SEC v. Int’l Chem. Dev. Corp., 469 F.2d 20, 27 (10th Cir.
1972). A defendant violates Section 5 when: (1) there is no registration statement in effect as to
securities being offered or sold; (2) the defendant directly or indirectly offers or sells the
securities; and (3) instruments of interstate commerce are used. 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a); SEC v.
Phan, 500 F.3d 895, 902 (9th Cir. 2007); SEC v. Calvo, 378 F.3d 1211, 1214 (11th Cir. 2004);
SEC v. Cavanagh, 155 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 1998). All participants in the offer or sale are
liable for the violation. Int’l Chem. Dev. Corp., 469 F.2d at 32-33; Calvo, 378 F.3d at 1215.
Scienter is not an element. See Raiford v. Buslease, Inc., 825 F.2d 351, 354 (11th Cir. 1987).
Rowen has the burden of demonstrating that any exemption to the registration requirement
applies. SEC v. Ralston Purina, 346 U.S. 119, 126 (1953); Quinn & Co. v. SEC, 452 F.2d 943,
946 (10th Cir. 1971).
The e-Smart stock that Rowen offered and sold was not registered. Cmpl. ¶ 61. He
solicited investors who purchased more than 4.5 million shares of e-Smart stock. Id. ¶¶ 75, 78.
4

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 10 Filed 07/25/11 Page 5 of 9

These allegations are sufficient to state a claim that Rowen violated Section 5. SEC v. Phan, 500
F.3d at 902; SEC v. Calvo, 378 F.3d at 1214; SEC v. Cavanagh, 155 F.3d at 133.
B. Section 15 Claim.
Section 15 of the Exchange Act prohibits brokers or dealers from effecting any
transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any security unless
they are registered with the SEC. 15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1). Scienter is not an element. SEC v.
Corp. Relations Group, Inc., 2003 WL 25570113, at *17 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 28, 2003); SEC v.
Randy, 38 F. Supp. 2d 657, 667 (N.D. Ill. 1999). The Exchange Act defines a broker as “any
person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.”
15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)(A); accord SEC v. Martino, 255 F. Supp. 2d 268, 283 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).
Courts have found defendants to be brokers when they: (1) were active rather than passive
finders of investors; (2) received commissions rather than salaries; or (3) advised investors about
the merits of investments. Id. at 283.
For nearly a year, Rowen actively sought investors for e-Smart. Cmpl. ¶¶ 75, 78. He
received commissions for soliciting and executing transactions that resulted in the distribution of
more than 4.5 million shares of e-Smart stock. Id. ¶¶ 75, 78. He was not registered with the SEC
as a broker and was not associated with a registered broker-dealer. Id. ¶¶ 22, 79. These
allegations are sufficient to state a claim that Rowen violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act.
III. THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER
ROWEN AND THE CLAIMS AGAINST HIM.
Section 22(a) of the Securities Act and Section 27 of the Exchange Act provide that the
district courts of the United States have subject matter jurisdiction over violations of those Acts.
15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(a), 78aa; S.E.C. v. Banner Fund Intern., 211 F.3d 602, 608 (D.C. Cir. 2000);
5

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 10 Filed 07/25/11 Page 6 of 9

Europe and Overseas Commodity Traders, S.A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F.3d 118, 126
(2d Cir. 1998). The Complaint alleges that Rowen committed violations of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims.
With regard to personal jurisdiction, Section 22(a) of the Securities Act and Section 27 of
the Exchange Act provide that process in SEC enforcement actions “may be served in any . . .
district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant may be found.” 15
U.S.C. §§ 77t(a), 78aa. Rowen is an inhabitant of Sebastopol, California, and the SEC found and
served him with the Complaint in Santa Rosa, both of which are in the Northern District of
California. This is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction on this Court. SEC v. Knowles, 87
F.3d 413, 417 (10th Cir. 1996); SEC v. Carrillo, 115 F.3d 1540, 1542 (11th Cir. 1997).
IV. VENUE IS PROPER IN THIS DISTRICT.
Venue is proper “in the district where the offer or sale took place, if the defendant
participated therein,” or “in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation
occurred.” 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(a), 78aa. “By the reference to ‘any act,’ the [Exchange Act]
permits a plaintiff to bring suit in any district where any person has committed any act that
‘constitute[s]’ the offence with which the defendant is charged.” SEC v. Johnson, 2011 WL
2535601, at *3-4 (D.C. Cir. June 28, 2011).
The offer and sale of e-Smart securities, and acts or transactions constituting Rowen’s
securities violations, occurred in this district. Grace orchestrated the unregistered offering from
her home in the District of Columbia. Cmpl. ¶¶ 17, 72-73. At Grace’s direction, the investors
wire-transferred their funds to an account in the name of e-Smart at a branch of PNC Bank in the
District of Columbia. Rogers Decl. Exs. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. From her home in this district, Grace
instructed the transfer agent to issue the stock certificates directly to investors or to her for later

6

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 10 Filed 07/25/11 Page 7 of 9

distribution to them. Rogers Decl. Exs. 2, 3. These facts demonstrate that venue in this district
is proper.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court should deny Rowen’s motion to dismiss the
Complaint.
