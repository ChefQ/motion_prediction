Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document 3 Filed 07/08/11 Page 2of5

A defendant's right to represent himself, or herself, is believed to have first
surfaced in the Judiciary Act of 1789, as a statutory right given by 0x00A7 272 of the Judicial
Code, 28 USC 0x00A7 394 [28 USCS 0x00A7 394] [now 28 USCS 0x00A7 1654], Appearance personally
or by counsel. "In all the courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct
their own cases personally or by counsel... .". This right appears to have existed
basically unchatiged since i769

DEFENDANT'S LIMITED APPEARANCE

Mr. Rowen limited pro se appearance is solely for the purpose of challenging the
jurisdiction and venue of this court, by motion to dismiss, without waiver of any rights,
either expressed or implied, and reserving the right to amend or supplement pleadings
filed herein.

MOTION TO DISMISS

Mr. Rowen moves to dismiss the action, pursuant to Rule 12(b), Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, because the Mr. Rowen is not subject to the personal
jurisdiction of this court, venue is improper, and the complaint fails to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted.

1. LACK OF JURISDICTION:

Plaintiff's complaint fails to specifically assert either personal or subject matter
jurisdiction over Mr. Rowen. Plaintiff alleges only a general jurisdiction.

Plaintiffs complaint does not allege Mr. Rowen resides in this jurisdiction, and
does not allege Mr. Rowen resides in this district, and does not allege that any part of
the events or omissions giving rise to any of the specific claims against Mr. Rowen

occurred in this district.

Case 1:11-cv-00895-JEB Document3 Filed 07/08/11 Page 3of5

Jurisdiction cannot be presumed, and once challenged must be resolved before
the matter may proceed in Federal courts.

Therefore, Mr. Rowen moves to dismiss this action, as to this specific defendant,
pursuant to Rule 12(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Mr. Rowen is not
subject to the personal jurisdiction of this court.

Z. IMPROPER VENUE.

Plaintiffs complaint fails to assert that this court is the appropriate venue for this
defendant, either pursuant to the specific allegations against Mr. Rowen, where the
complaint does not specifically assert that any part of the events or omissions giving
rise to any of the specific claims against Mr. Rowen occurred in this venue.

Plaintiffs complaint also failed to allege that Mr. Rowen was connected to any
other defendant in the complaint by either contract or agreement. Therefore, Mr.

Rowen believes this venue is improper, and moves to dismiss this action, as to this
defendant, for improper venue, or. alternatively, for a change of venue for Mr. Rowen to
the District Court nearest Mr. Rowen's residence.

3. INSUFFICIENT COMPLAINT:

Mr. Rowen moves to dismiss the complaint against him for failure tc allege a
claim for relief that can be granted to the plaintiff as a clear and undisputed matter of
law. The complaint is defective and insufficient in failing to show with any degree of
specificity as to how Mr. Rowen is alleged to have violated any law, failed to identify a

single person or persons that Mr. Rowen is alleged to have committed any act with or

against that would be a specific violation of any law.

relief may be granted as a clear and undisputed matter of law, or in the alternative, an

committed any alleged act with or against, and specifically indicate how any act alleged
to nave been contiiiieu vy vir. Rowen dcludily vioiaied any law.

CONCLUSION

Rule 12(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Mr. Rowen is not subject to the
personal jurisdiction of this court; venue is improper, and the complaint fails to state a

claim upon which relief can be granted.
