Case 3:08-cv-00484-JSW

Document 9

Filed 01/28/2008

Page 2 of 5

On January 23, 2008, Plaintiffs in Center for Food Safety, et al. v. Connor, et al., 3:08-

1
2

cv-00484-JSW filed their complaint, and on the same date, an administrative motion to consider

3

whether that case should be related to Geertson Seed Farms, et al. v. Johanns, et al., 3:06-cv-

4

01075-CRB, because both cases allegedly involve “substantially the same parties and events,”

5

and because relating the cases will supposedly avoid “unduly burdensome duplication of labor

6

and expense and potentially conflicting results...” Plfs. Motion to Relate Cases at 1. Contrary to

7

Plaintiffs’ assertions, the cases do not meet the definition of related cases set forth in Local Rule

8

3-12 because they do not “concern substantially the same parties, property, transaction or event”

9

and do not create a likelihood of “unduly burdensome duplication of labor and expense or

10

conflicting results if the cases are conducted before different Judges.” Plaintiffs’ motion to

11

consider whether the cases should be related should be denied.

12

I.

13

The Parties, Events and Transactions Are Different.
Plaintiffs claim that Geertson Seed Farms and Center for Food Safety involve

14

substantially the same parties and events because both cases involve challenges to decisions by

15

the Department of Agriculture, which Plaintiffs argue are “similar” in that they involve

16

deregulation of genetically engineered alfalfa in the first case and sugar beets in the second.

17

Plfs. Motion to Relate Cases at 1. In other words, it should be dispositive of their motion that

18

Plaintiffs admit that the challenge in Center for Food Safety involves an entirely different agency

19

decision, and therefore a different event or transaction, than the challenge in Geertson Seed

20

Farms.

21

The Local Rules state that actions are related when the challenged event is “substantially

22

the same.” L.R. 3-12. Thus, in McGee v. Ross Stores, Inc., 2007 WL 2900507, *1 (N.D. Cal.

23

2007), this Court concluded that actions were related where the “alleged claims and events

24

giving rise to the alleged claims are the same” because in both cases the plaintiffs alleged the

25

same specific facts in claiming violations of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act.

26

Plaintiffs cannot, and do not, allege that the facts here are the same. Nor could they. The

27

decision to deregulate alfalfa and the decision to deregulate sugar beets are two entirely separate

1

and distinct decisions, which involve separate environmental assessments. The administrative

2

records for the two decisions are also different. Indeed, although they weakly allege that the

3

decisions and environmental assessments are “substantially similar in structure and content,”

4

Plfs. Motion to Relate at 1, it is telling that Plaintiffs make little effort to identify any common

5

facts or issues. The allegations of facts in each complaint also illustrates the differences between

6

the cases. See, e.g., Geertson Seed Farms Complaint, ¶¶ 74-86 (background on alfalfa) and

7

Center for Food Safety Complaint ¶¶ 38-41 (background on sugar beets). The administrative

8

record and agency decision in the alfalfa case will be irrelevant to the Court’s resolution of the

9

issues in the sugar beets case. Because they cannot show that the two challenges arise out of

10

substantially the “same,” transaction or event, which is the standard in the Local Rules, the Court

11

should deny the Plaintiffs’ motion to consider whether the cases should be related.

12

The absence of common parties provides a separate reason to deny the motion to relate.

13

Plaintiffs state that the two cases involve substantially the same parties, but the record shows that

14

the parties are not “substantially” the same, even though there are a couple of common plaintiffs,

15

the Sierra Club and the Center for Food Safety, both of which are national organizations. Unlike

16

the Center for Food Safety case, the Geertson Seed Farms challenge primarily involves entities

17

interested in alfalfa, such as Geertson Seed Farms and Trask Family Seeds, both of which are

18

family farmers. Geertson Seed Farms Complaint, ¶¶ 11-14. Geertson Seed Farms also involves

19

a number of other organizational Plaintiffs, including Beyond Pesticides, Cornucopia Institute,

20

the Dakota Resource Council, the National Family Farm Coalition, and the Western

21

Organization of Resource Councils, none of whom are Plaintiffs in Center for Food Safety, and

22

each of whom alleges different interests to the Plaintiffs in Center for Food Safety. See, e.g.,

23

Geertson Complaint, ¶¶ 27, 31, 35 (Beyond Pesticides alleges the alfalfa deregulation decision

24

affects it and its members “because the action will allow genetically engineered alfalfa to be

25

placed in the stream of commerce. . .”); (Cornucopia Institute alleges that “[s]ince alfalfa is used

26

as a primary feed for cows, USDA’s actions allowing the introduction of genetically engineered

27

glyphosate tolerant alfalfa into the environment may result in the contamination of organic

1

dairies and meats. . .”); (Dakota Resource Council also alleges that because alfalfa is a primary

2

feed for cows, the alfalfa deregulation decision may contaminate milk and meats.).

3

Further highlighting the differences among the various plaintiffs in the two cases, in

4

Center for Food Safety, there are two organizational Plaintiffs that emphasize their interests in

5

sugar beets, High Mowing Organic Seeds and Organic Seed Alliance. High Mowing Organic

6

Seeds alleges that it supplies commercial growers with organic vegetable, flower, and herb

7

seeds, including “nine varieties of table beets...” Center for Food Safety Complaint at ¶¶ 23, 25.

8

It alleges that the decision to deregulate sugar beets will cause economic and aesthetic injury to

9

the “beet and chard seed industry.” Id. at ¶ 25. Similarly, Organic Seed Alliance alleges that it

10

is concerned that deregulation of “sugar beets will contaminate organic varieties of related

11

species.” ¶ 17. Neither organization alleges any interest in alfalfa. Thus, merely because the

12

Center for Food Safety and the Sierra Club, two national organizations, are plaintiffs in both

13

cases, the Court should not conclude that the cases are related, where the interests of the majority

14

of the plaintiffs in the two cases are different.

15

II.

Denial of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Consider Relating the Two Cases Will Not Cause
Undue Burden, Nor Will It Create a Risk of Conflicting Results.

16
Plaintiffs also argue that the Court should relate the cases because they “involve many of
17
the same questions of law and fact...” Plfs. Motion to Relate at 1. But, as they point out, the
18
Court’s resolution of Geertson Seed Farms required review of “an extensive administrative
19
record. . .” Id. at 1. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), “[t]he task of the reviewing
20
court is to apply the appropriate APA standard of review, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), to the agency
21
decision based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.” Florida Power & Light
22
Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743-44 (1985). Plaintiffs claim that because this Court is “already
23
familiar with the highly technical scientific and agricultural issues surrounding the introduction
24
of crops that have been genetically engineered,” Plfs. Motion to Relate at 2, relation of the cases
25
will conserve judicial resources. But, Plaintiffs ignore the central fact that resolution of the
26
Plaintiffs’ challenge to the sugar beets decision will likewise require review of an extensive--but
27
entirely separate--administrative record. Moreover, the cases are in different procedural

postures. The claims in Geertson Seed Farms have been adjudicated and are on appeal, while the

2

complaint in Center for Food Safety was filed on January 23, 2008. The fact that the plaintiffs in

3

the two cases both allege NEPA violations does not change the outcome because review of the

4

distinct questions raised in the challenge to the sugar beets decision will require the judge

5

assigned to consider the adequacy of the administrative record associated with the sugar beets

6

decision.1/ Therefore, duplication of effort is not an issue. Finally, there is no risk of

7

inconsistent judgments because, as Plaintiffs admit, they are challenging a different decision in

8

Center for Food Safety.

9

CONCLUSION
Because Plaintiffs have not shown that they have met the requirements of Local Rule 3-

10
11

12 defining related cases, the Court should deny their motion to consider whether the cases

12

should be related.
