Case SOS er Og Document 3 Filed oe Page 2 of 4

Pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-12 and 7-11, plaintiffs Center for Food Safety et al. move the
Court to consider whether the above-entitled action is related to an action already on file in this
district before the Honorable Charles R. Breyer: Geertson Seed Farms, et al. v. Johanns, et al., No.
C 06-1075 CRB (N.D. Cal.). As detailed below, plaintiffs respectfully submit that relating the
instant case to Geertson Seed Farms is appropriate, because both cases involve substantially the
same parties and events, and it appears likely that there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of
labor and expense and possibly conflicting results if the cases are conducted before different judges.

STATEMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ACTIONS

L This Case and Geertson Seed Farms Involve Substantially the Same Parties and Events.

This case and Geertson Seed Farms involve substantially the same parties and events. In the
instant case, the Center for Food Safety, Sierra Club, Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing
Organic Seeds challenge a decision by the United States Department of Agriculture, through the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ("APHIS"), to deregulate a variety of sugar beet that has
been genetically engineered by Monsanto Company to resist glyphosate, the active ingredient in the
herbicide Roundup. In Geertson Seed Farms, the Center for Food Safety, Sierra Club and others
challenged a similar decision by the Department of Agriculture to deregulate a variety of alfalfa that
had likewise been genetically engineered by Monsanto to resist Roundup. The deregulation
decisions and associated environmental assessments at issue in both this case and Geertson Seed
Farms are substantially similar in structure and content.

Il. Relating this Case to Geertson Seed Farms Will Avoid Unduly Burdensome Duplication
of Labor and Expense and Conflicting Results.

The instant case and Geertson Seed Farms involve many of the same questions of law and
fact, such that their assignment to the same judge is likely to conserve significant judicial resources
and avoid the possibility of conflicting results. In Geertson Seed Farms, the Court resolved "a close
question of first impression: whether the introduction of a genetically engineered crop ... is a
`significant environmental impact' requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement."
Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 2007 WL 518624, *1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2007). After reviewing
an extensive administrative record and the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court

found ample evidence that the commercialization of Roundup resistant crops could result in genetic

contamination of conventional varieties, as well as the proliferation of Roundup resistant weeds. Id.
at *5-10. The Court therefore held that the Department of Agriculture's decision to deregulate
Roundup resistant alfalfa was a major federal action significantly affecting the environment
requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement under National Environmental
Policy Act ("NEPA"). Id. at *12.'

The instant case challenges the Department of Agriculture's deregulation of a different
Roundup resistant crop (sugar beets), but it raises equivalent legal claims under NEPA based on
essentially the same environmental concerns. As in Geertson Seed Farms, the plaintiffs in the
instant case allege that the Department of Agriculture failed to consider evidence that deregulating a
Roundup resistant crop will result in genetic contamination of conventional varieties and breed
herbicide resistant weeds. Consistent with the legal precedent established by Geertson Seed Farms,
plaintiffs in this case therefore allege that the Department of Agriculture violated NEPA by failing to
prepare an environmental impact statement in connection with its deregulation decision.

Because this case and Geertson Seed Farms involve nearly identical questions of law and
very similar questions of fact, the assignment of this case to Judge Breyer will conserve judicial
resources and ensure that there are consistent outcomes in both cases. Judge Breyer is already
familiar with the highly technical scientific and agricultural issues of first impression surrounding
the introduction of crops that have been genetically engineered by Monsanto to resist Roundup.
Judge Breyer is also familiar with the complex legal process through which the Department of
Agriculture decides whether genetically engineered plants meet the criteria for deregulation under
the Plant Protection Act and NEPA.

injunction in favor of the plaintiffs in Geertson Seed Farms. The Court stayed the plaintiffs'

CONCLUSION
Because the instant case and Geertson Seed Farms involve substantially the same parties and
events, and it appears likely that there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and
expense and possibly conflicting results if the cases are conducted before different judges, the cases

are related within the meaning of Civil Local Rule 3-12.
