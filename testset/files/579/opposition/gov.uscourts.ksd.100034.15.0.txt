DEFENDANT CLERKS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
Douglas A. Hamilton, Clerk of the District Court of Douglas County Kansas, and Bernie
Lumbreras, Clerk of the District Court for Sedgwick County, Kansas, concur in the Response
filed by KDHE Secretary Dr. Moser in opposition to Plaintiffs’ request for temporary restraining
order or preliminary injunction (Doc. 14).

Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Lumbreras submit this

response to emphasize certain points specific to their position as District Court Clerks in Kansas.
For the reasons stated by Dr. Moser and as elaborated upon briefly herein, Plaintiffs’ request
must be denied.
First, Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction
against two court clerks, judicial officers, is prohibited by federal law. Second, the Tenth Circuit
has already recognized that court clerks are not the proper defendants in an action such as this
seeking recognition of same-sex marriage as this is not the clerks’ role. Third, the Kansas
1

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 2 of 12

Supreme Court has already assumed jurisdiction over this matter in a case filed prior to this one,
State ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty and in that action, on October 10, 2014 ordered a stay on
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Johnson County, Kansas pending further order
of the Court, citing “the interest of establishing statewide consistency.” Granting Plaintiffs’
requested relief, assuming that were authorized by law, would conflict with the Kansas Supreme
Court’s Order, but also its supervisory authority over all of the clerks in Kansas. It would also
lead to a confusing and non-uniform situation in which clerks in two counties are doing one thing
and the other 103 are doing something else, implicating important federalist concerns by
disruption of a state court judicial system, concerns embodied in federal statute as well as
abstention doctrines.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. Douglas Hamilton and Bernie Lumbreras are Clerks of the District Court in Douglas
and Sedgwick Counties respectively. Complt. (Doc. 1), at ¶¶ 9-10.
2.

In Kansas, both clerks of the district court and judges have a statutorily prescribed
role in issuing marriage applications and licenses as stated in K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 232505.

3. The Complaint, filed on October 10, 2014, alleges that on October 7, 2014, Plaintiff
Wilks, who resides in Sedgwick County, sought a marriage license for the purpose of
marrying another woman and was told by Chief Judge Fleetwood of the 18th Judicial
District that she could not obtain a marriage license in Kansas to marry another
woman. Complt. (Doc. 1), at ¶ 19.
4. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff Marie, who resides in Douglas County, applied
for a marriage license at the Douglas County Clerk’s Office on October 8, 2014 and

2

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 3 of 12

was told to return on October 14, 2014. Complt. (Doc. 1), at ¶ 16.
5. According to the Complaint, on October 9, 2014, the Chief Judge of the Seventh
Judicial District, Robert Fairchild, issued Administrative Order 14-13 which states
that the court “is bound to apply and follow existing Kansas laws.” Complt. (Doc. 1),
at ¶ 17. The Order concludes: “The Clerk of the District Court shall not issue a
marriage license to these applicants or to any other applicants of the same sex.” Id.
6. In Kansas, district courts exist in all Kansas counties. K.S.A. 20-301. A clerk of the
district court is appointed in each county. K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 20-343. 1
7. Appointed clerks, their deputies and assistants “have such powers, duties and
functions as are prescribed by law, prescribed by rules of the supreme court or
assigned by the chief judge.” K.S.A. 20-343. The clerks of the district court “shall
do and perform all duties that may be required of them by law or the rules and
practice of the courts....” K.S.A. 20-3102. Clerks are expressly prohibited from
giving legal advice. K.S.A. 20-3133.
8. As per K.S.A. 54-106, “[a]ll officers elected or appointed under any law of the state
of Kansas shall, before entering upon the duties of their respective offices, take and
subscribe an oath or affirmation, as follows: ‘I do solemnly swear [or affirm, as the
case may be] that I will support the constitution of the United States and the
constitution of the state of Kansas, and faithfully discharge the duties of [my office].
So help me God.’”
9. Kansas is a unified court system. K.S.A. 20-101, Kan. Const. Art. 3, § 1 (“[t]he
supreme court shall have general administrative authority over all courts in this state”);

K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 20-318, K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 20-319. In Kansas, the district courts
are organized into thirty-one (31) judicial districts. Kan. Const., Art. 3, § 6; K.S.A. 4202, et seq. Chief Judges, including Judge Fairchild and Judge Fleetwood, are subject
to appointment by and supervision of the Kansas Supreme Court. See, e.g., K.S.A.
2014 Supp. 20-329. Clerks of the District Court Hamilton and Lumbreras, are Kansas
Judicial Branch officers, appointed by their respective Chief Judges and are Judicial
Branch employees. K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 20-343, K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 20-345. As of
June 30, 2013, there were 246 district judges in Kansas. Annual Report of the Courts
of Kansas, FY 2013, available at http://intranet.kscourts.org:7780/stats. 2
10. Citing the Attorney General’s reference to an “inconsistent practice among the state’s
31 judicial districts,” and “in the interest of establishing statewide consistency,” on
Friday, October 10, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court issued an Order in State ex rel.
Schmidt v. Moriarty, 112590, granting the Attorney General’s request for a temporary
stay of Chief Judge Kevin Moriarty’s Administrative Order allowing the issuance of
same-sex marriage licenses in Johnson County, Kansas. A certified copy of the
Supreme Court's Order is attached as Exhibit A hereto.

The Court also set an

expedited briefing schedule and set a hearing for November 6, 2014 at 10 a.m. to
determine the issues raised by Judge Moriarty's Order. Id.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
Plaintiffs request a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction against Ms.
Lumbreras and Mr. Hamilton, two of the 105 district court clerks, enjoining them from following
existing state law as well as the express direction of their respective Chief Judges and by
2

A court may take judicial notice under Fed. R. Evid. 201 of information on the Internet. See O’Toole v. Northrop
Grumman Corp., 499 F.3d 1218, 1225 (10th Cir. 2007).

4

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 5 of 12

implication, the October 10, 2014 Order of the Kansas Supreme Court. Plaintiffs’ request for
immediate injunctive relief against the Clerks must be denied for several reasons.
Federal Law Prohibits the Requested Injunction Against Judicial Officers
Plaintiffs premise their request for injunctive relief on 42 U.S.C. § 1983. However, since
the 1996 Amendment, Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-317, 110 Stat. 3847
(Oct. 19, 1996), 42 U.S.C. § 1983 expressly prohibits injunctive relief against judicial officers,
including the proviso: “except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or
omission taken in such officer’s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a
declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.” (Emphasis added).
Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Lumbreras are judicial officers, appointed by their respective
Chief Judges. K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 20-343. The Complaint alleges that they were acting in their
respective official capacities as clerks in this matter. See Complt. (Doc. 1), at ¶¶ 9-10. The
Complaint also alleges that Clerks Hamilton and Lumbreras were acting on orders of their
respective Chief Judges, Fairchild and Fleetwood. Id., at ¶¶ 17, 19. In Kansas, the issuance of
marriage licenses is a responsibility of clerks and judges, K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 23-2505, both of
which are judicial officers. See, e.g., Lundahl v. Zimmer, 296 F.3d 936, 939 (10th Cir. 2002).
Injunctive relief is expressly proscribed by 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Tenth Circuit has so held. See,
e.g, Landrith v. Gariglietti, 505 Fed. Appx. 701, 702-03, 2012 WL 6062668 (10th Cir. 2012);
Knox v. Bland, 632 F.3d 1290, 1292 (10th Cir. 2011).
To the extent that Plaintiffs complain of the Clerks’ respective actions in allegedly failing
to issue marriage licenses on the orders of their respective Chief Judges upon request on October
7-8, 2014, retrospective relief, this relief is also barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity as
stated in Buchheit v. Green, 705 F.3d 1157, 1159 (10th Cir. 2012), a case on point.
5

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 6 of 12

Similarly, under the somewhat unique circumstances presented by this case given the
action and October 10, 2014, Order of the Kansas Supreme Court, the Anti-Injunction Act
prohibits this court from granting injunctive relief against the Clerks. The statute, 28 U.S.C. §
2283, provides: “[a] court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings
in a state court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of
its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.” As explained by the U.S. Supreme
Court:
[t]he Act, which has existed in some form since 1793, see Act of Mar. 2, 1793, ch.22, § 5,
1 Stat. 335, is a necessary concomitant of the Framers’ decision to authorize, and
Congress’ decision to implement, a dual system of federal and state courts. It represents
Congress’ considered judgment as to how to balance the tensions inherent in such a
system. Prevention of frequent federal court intervention is important to make the dual
system work effectively. By generally barring such intervention, the Act forestalls ‘the
inevitable friction between the state and federal courts that ensues from the injunction of
state judicial proceedings by a federal court.’ Due in no small part to the fundamental
constitutional independence of the States, Congress adopted a general policy under which
state proceedings ‘should normally be allowed to continue unimpaired by intervention of
the lower federal courts, with relief from error, if any, through the state appellate courts
and ultimately this Court.’
Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U.S. 140, 146 (1988) (citations omitted).
An injunction ordering the Clerks to do as Plaintiffs suggest implicates the policies and
interests behind the Anti-Injunction Act. What Plaintiffs seek from this Court is an Order
enjoining the Orders of Chief Judges Fairchild and Fleetwood and, by implication, the Kansas
Supreme Court’s proceeding in State ex. rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty. In its October 10, 2014, Order,
the Supreme Court stated that it was assuming jurisdiction over the marriage license question “in
the interest of establishing statewide consistency” and establishing a briefing schedule and
hearing date to determine one or more issues set for briefing in the Order. The requested
temporary restraining order in this case interferes with the stay order and the pending proceeding

6

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 7 of 12

in State ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty. 3
Clerks Are Not Necessary or Proper Defendants in “Non-Recognition” Cases
Plaintiffs don’t just seek a marriage license; they seek recognition of their marriage for all
purposes. See Complt. (Doc. 1), ¶ 2 (implying that Plaintiffs seek “the legal sanction, respect,
protections, and support that heterosexuals and their families are able to enjoy through
marriage.”); ¶ 5 (referring to the need to eliminate “the myriad serious harms inflicted on them
by the marriage ban and Defendants’ enforcement of it”); ¶ 14 (stating that plaintiffs are without
“the same legal shelter, dignity, and respect afforded by the State of Kansas to other families
through access to the universally celebrated status of marriage. . . [plaintiffs are deprived of]
equal dignity, security, and legal protections afforded to other Kansas families.”); ¶ 28 (referring
to the right to inherit property and to file joint state tax returns); ¶ 29 (referring to “unique social
recognition” from marriage); ¶ 47 (referring to an interest in “obtaining full liberty, dignity, and
security for themselves, their family, and their parent-child bonds”); ¶ 60- ¶ 77 (alleging other
interests). Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, a favorable decision against two court clerks in two
of 105 Kansas counties will not “avoid the injuries described above,” or “prevent …irreparable
injuries.” Id., at ¶ 80.

Although out of candor counsel acknowledges some contrary indication in the Supreme
Court’s decision in Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225 (1972) (holding that the availability of an
equitable remedy in § 1983 and the facts of that case in which the state court proceeding was
alleged to be unconstitutional allowed for an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act), that 1972
decision obviously preceded the 1996 Amendment proscribing preliminary injunctive relief
against judicial officers (and hence, removing the underpinning for the holding as to state court
judicial officers). Further, Mitchum did not deal with the situation alleged here where the state
court proceeding is not itself alleged to be unconstitutional as stated in Hickey v. Duffy, 827 F.2d
234, 238 (7th Cir. 1987).

7

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 8 of 12

Accordingly, as the Tenth Circuit held in the Bishop case, the district court clerks are not
proper defendants as they don’t “recognize” marriages. Bishop v. Oklahoma, 333 Fed. Appx.
361, 2009 WL 1566802 (10th Cir. 2009), opinion after remand Bishop v. Smith, 760 F.3d 1070,
1091, n.13 (2014). This also goes to the related question of standing and appropriate relief, as
while even if this Court were to grant Plaintiffs’ requests, this would only result in paperwork
which would require still further action by one or more courts of competent jurisdiction to
determine if it had any validity or legal effect. See, e.g., In re Estate of Gardiner, 273 Kan. 191,
42 P.3d 120, cert. denied sub nom Gardiner v. Gardiner, 537 U.S.825 (2002). It will not
eliminate Plaintiffs’ alleged harms, nor will it achieve what Plaintiffs seek.
Otherwise put and as raised by this Court’s request for information on standing, “a
plaintiff must show: (1) that [she] has suffered a concrete and particular injury in fact that is
either actual or imminent; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the alleged actions of the
defendant; and (3) the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.” The issue at
hand turns on the third requirement – that of redressability – which is ‘not met when a plaintiff
seeks relief against a defendant with no power to enforce a challenged statute.’” Bishop v. Smith,
760 F.3d 1070, 1088 (10th Cir. 2014) (emphasis added; citations omitted). While the Clerks have
no evidentiary burden at this juncture, the Complaint clearly alleges that the Clerks are following
Kansas law as it exists today and that they have no legal authority to do otherwise. See, e.g.,
Complt. (Doc. 1), at ¶¶ 9-10 (alleging that the clerks “must ensure compliance . . . with relevant
Kansas laws, including those that exclude same-sex couples from marriage”); ¶¶ 22-27 (pointing
out that Kansas law as adopted by the Legislature as well as the constitutional amendment
prohibit same-sex marriage).

8

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 9 of 12

According to the Complaint, Clerks Hamilton and Lumbreras and their respective
deputies are complying with their oaths of office and the Orders of their respective Chief Judges.
Hamilton and Lumbreras have no power to remedy the other alleged harms set forth in the
Complaint such as the right to file joint tax returns or inherit property. Complt. (Doc. 1), at ¶ 28.
An injunction against the Clerks, even if that were legally possible and factually supported,
would not redress the Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries or harms; Plaintiffs have failed to posture their
suit correctly for standing purposes to obtain the recognition and relief they seek. See also,
Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099 (10th Cir. 2007) (questioning standing in a lawsuit
challenging a clerk’s refusal to issue a marriage license).
The Requested Injunction is Barred by Abstention
Although these issues may be extensively briefed at the appropriate time, the Court
indicated it was interested in the parties’ views on standing and abstention. Two abstention
doctrines mentioned by the Court stemmed from Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and
Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941), respectively. Those two doctrines
are addressed in Defendant Moser’s Response (Doc. 14, at 14-16), in which the Clerks concur.
Plaintiffs’ filing on this issue (Doc. 7) acknowledges that Younger bars federal injunctive
relief in “civil proceedings involving certain orders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’
ability to perform their judicial functions.” (Doc. 7, at 4, citing New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v.
Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 368 (1989)). Plaintiffs’ cursory analysis ignores
the general rule to impliedly suggest that only the two specific examples involved in the two
cases cited by the NOPSI Court (civil contempt order and requirement for the posting of bond
pending appeal), are within Younger. NOPSI and Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S.
Ct. 584 (2013), cited by Plaintiffs, involved underlying administrative actions and are not
9

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 10 of 12

factually analogous here. However, the rule stated in NOPSI, which was reiterated in Sprint, at
591, without much discussion, is not by its terms limited to civil contempt orders and orders
involving posting of bonds pending appeals. See Sprint, 134 S. Ct. at 588 (recognizing that the
Court has applied Younger to state civil proceedings that implicate a State’s interest in enforcing
the orders and judgments of its courts.”). In State ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty, the Court issued a
stay order on issuance of same-sex marriage licenses as part and parcel to its assuming
jurisdiction in that case, preserving the status quo pending its opportunity to rule on the questions
presented; that in and of itself is most assuredly a judicial function, as well as assuring
uniformity by clerks (as well as the 246 Kansas Judges charged by statute with performing this
function), in their performance of this function in the State of Kansas, the type of order “uniquely
in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to perform their judicial functions.”
Although this issue can be briefed extensively at the appropriate time, it bears noting that
the requested injunction against two of 105 clerks operating under the supervision of the Kansas
Supreme Court and its judicial system implicates the rationale and policies underlying the
abstention doctrine first announced by the Supreme Court in Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S.
315 (1943). In that case, a federal court proceeding was brought by Sun Oil Company to attack
the validity of an order of the Texas Railroad Commission granting Burford a permit to drill four
wells in a Texas oil field. The Court observed that even when a federal court may have
jurisdiction, it “is in the public interest that federal courts of equity should exercise their
discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in
carrying out their domestic policy.” Id., at 316-18. In that case, the Court observed that the issue
involved a Texas regulatory system, hundreds of operators, and important state interests being
overseen by the Texas Railroad Commission in a unified system. See id., at 318-30.

10

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 15 Filed 10/23/14 Page 11 of 12

As later elaborated upon by the Supreme Court, this doctrine has been applied “[w]here
timely and adequate state-court review is available, a federal court sitting in equity must decline
to interfere with proceedings or orders of state administrative agencies: (1) when there are
‘difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose
importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,’ or (1) where the ‘exercise of federal
review of the question in a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of state efforts to
establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.’” NOPSI,
491 U.S. at 361 (citing Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800,
814 (1986)) (emphasis added).
As a matter of state law as set forth above, Kansas court clerks operate as part of a unified
Kansas judicial system, operating under the control and supervision of the Kansas Supreme
Court. In issuing its October 10, 2014, Order in State ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty, the Court was
not only acting as a Court but also as an entity with administrative and supervisory authority over
Chief Judge Moriarty, Sandra McCurdy, Clerk of the Court of Johnson County, and all of the
other Clerks in the State of Kansas. The Court’s October 10, 2014, Order indicated it was
granting the stay on issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in Johnson County “in the interest of
establishing statewide consistency.” Obviously, an Order from this Court requiring issuance of
marriage licenses from two of 105 district court clerks in two of 105 counties is contrary to the
“interest of establishing statewide consistency” cited by the State Supreme Court. It also creates
a confusing, disruptive and non-uniform situation in this important area of substantial public
concern and state policy interests, implicating the policies behind the Burford abstention doctrine.

CONCLUSION
Defendants have no burden at this point, as their responsive pleadings are not yet even
due. As pointed out in Dr. Moser’s Response (Doc. 14, at 16-19), Plaintiffs bear the heavy
burden of showing that they are entitled to the extraordinary relief requested in this case.
Plaintiffs’ Complaint and request for immediate temporary restraining order and preliminary
injunction (Docs. 1, 3-4), fail to meet that burden. The request for temporary restraining order
and/or preliminary injunction against Clerks Douglas Hamilton and Bernie Lumbreras must be
denied by this Court.
