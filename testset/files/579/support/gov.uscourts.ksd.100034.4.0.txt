Case No. 14-cv-2518

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION AND TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
Introduction
This is a civil rights action for injunctive and declaratory relief seeking to declare unconstitutional and enjoin Defendants from enforcing Article 15, § 16 of the Kansas Constitution, Kansas Statutes Annotated §§ 23-2501 and 23-2508, and any other Kansas statute, law,
policy, or practice that excludes Plaintiffs and other same-sex couples from marriage. Simply put, “A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to
recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union.”
Kitchen v. Herbert, 755 F.3d 1193, 1199 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 83 U.S.L.W. 3102 (U.S.
Oct. 6, 2014).

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 2 of 11

In direct violation of the United States Constitution, the Kansas Constitution declares
that “Marriage shall be constituted by one man and one woman only. All other marriages are
declared to be contrary to the public policy of this state and are void.” KAN. CONST. art. 15,
§ 16. See also Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 23-2501 and 23-2508. Pursuant to these laws, Defendants
are refusing to issue marriages licenses to same-sex couples based solely on the sex of the
persons they wish to marry.
The Tenth Circuit held in Kitchen and Bishop v. Smith, 760 F.3d 1070 (10th Cir.), cert denied, 83 U.S.L.W. 3102 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014), that virtually identical marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma violated the Fourteenth Amendment. But despite this binding precedent, Defendants have
indicated that they will continue to enforce Kansas’s unconstitutional marriage bans until a court
enjoins them from doing so. Plaintiffs accordingly seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to force Defendants to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment in conformance
with binding Tenth Circuit precedent.
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a) and (b), Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order (1) enjoining Defendants and their officers, employees,
and agents from enforcing Article 15, § 16 of the Kansas Constitution, Kansas Statutes Annotated §§ 23-2501 and 23-2508, and any other sources of state law that preclude same-sex couples
from marriage and (2) requiring Defendants and their officers, employees, and agents in their
official capacities to permit issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, pursuant to the
same restrictions and limitations applicable to different-sex couples’ freedom to marry, and to
recognize marriages validly entered into by Plaintiffs.

Facts
Plaintiffs are two same-sex couples who wish to marry in Kansas. See Declaration of Kail
Marie, ¶ 3; Declaration of Michelle L. Brown, ¶ 3; Declaration of Kerry Wilks, Ph.D., ¶ 3; and
Declaration of Donna DiTrani, ¶ 3. Plaintiffs meet all of the requirements Kansas imposes for
the issuance of a marriage license except that they want to marry a person of the same sex. Id., ,
¶ 4.
On October 8, 2014, Kail Marie appeared in person at the office of the Clerk of the Douglas County District Court, and submitted a fully executed application for a marriage license to a
deputy clerk. Declaration of Kail Marie, ¶ 5. On Thursday, October 9, 2014, Chief Judge Robert
W. Fairchild of the Seventh Judicial District issued Administrative Order 14-13, which states
that “[t]he court performs an administrative function when it issues a marriage license” and indicates that in exercising that administrative function it is bound to apply and follow existing Kansas laws. See Admin. Ord. 14-13 re Same-sex Marriage License Applications, available at
http://www.douglas-county.com/district_court/docs/pdf/adminorder_14-13.pdf. The Administrative Order concludes by saying that “[t]he Clerk of the District Court shall not issue a marriage
license to these applicants or to any other applicants of the same sex.” Id. Thus, it is clear that
Plaintiff Marie’s application for a marriage license will be denied because she seeks to marry a
woman, Plaintiff Michelle Brown.
On October 9, 2014, Plaintiffs Wilks and DiTrani submitted a fully executed application
for a marriage license to a deputy clerk at the office of the Clerk of the District Court for the 18th
Judicial District in Wichita, Kansas. Declaration of Kerry Wilks, Ph.D., ¶ 5; and Declaration of
Donna DiTrani, ¶ 5. At that point, the deputy clerk – reading from a prepared statement – told
Plaintiffs Wilks and DiTrani that their application for a marriage license was denied because
3

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 4 of 11

same-sex marriages violate provisions of the Kansas Constitution and that the office of the District Court Clerk for the 18th Judicial District will not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples
until a court rules otherwise. Id.
Argument
On June 25, 2014, the Tenth Circuit held that state laws that treat same-sex couples differently from opposite-sex couples for purposes of marriage violate the Due Process and Equal
Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Kitchen, 755
F.3d at 1229-30. Although Kitchen concerned the laws and practices of the State of Utah, the
Tenth Circuit was explicit that its holding applied not only to the Utah law in question, but also
to “similar statutory enactments,” such as the Kansas laws at issue in this case. Id. at 1230. On
July 18, 2014, the Tenth Circuit likewise held that Oklahoma’s prohibition of marriage for samesex couples violated the principles of due process and equal protection, concluding that “states
may not, consistent with the United States Constitution, prohibit same-sex marriages.” Bishop,
760 F.3d at 1082.
The state defendants in both Kitchen and Bishop filed petitions for writs of certiorari in
the United States Supreme Court. On October 6, 2014, the United States Supreme Court denied
both petitions, along with petitions seeking to overturn similar decisions by the Fourth and Seventh Circuits. See Rainey v. Bostic, 83 U.S.L.W. 3102 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014); Bogan v. Baskin, 83
U.S.L.W. 3127 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014). The Tenth Circuit issued its mandate in both Kitchen and
Bishop the same day. See Kitchen v. Herbert, 2014 WL 4960471 (10th Cir. Oct. 6, 2014); Bishop
v. Smith, 2014 WL 4960523 (10th Cir. Oct. 6, 2014). The Tenth Circuit’s holding that “under the
Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, those who wish to
marry a person of the same sex are entitled to exercise the same fundamental right as is recog4

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 5 of 11

nized for persons who wish to marry a person of the opposite sex,” is now the law of the land in
Kansas. Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1229-30.
Despite this binding precedent, Defendants Hamilton and Lumbreras refuse to issue marriage licenses to otherwise-qualified same-sex couples in Douglas and Sedgwick Counties without direction from the courts. Other county clerks also are awaiting instruction from the courts
before issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. See, e.g., Same-sex Marriage in Limbo in
Kansas – All but one of 105 counties refusing to issue marriage licenses (Heather Hollingsworth,
Associated Press, Oct. 9, 2014), http://cjonline.com/news/2014-10-09/same-sex-marriage-limbokansas. In addition, on Friday, October 10, 2014, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed
a petition with the Kansas Supreme Court seeking a writ of mandamus to stop the Johnson County District Court from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Petition for Writ of Mandamus, State of Kansas ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty, Case No. 112,590 (Kan., filed Oct. 10, 2014)
available at http://www.kscourts.org/State_v_Moriarty/State%20v%20Moriarty%20Petition.pdf.
That same day, the Kansas Supreme Court granted a temporary stay of the Johnson County District Court’s Administrative Order 14-11, which had instructed the district court clerk’s office to
allow same-sex couples to apply for marriage licenses and to obtain such licenses if otherwise
qualified under Kansas law. State of Kansas ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty, Case No. 112,590
(Kan., filed Oct. 10, 2014) available at http://www.kscourts.org/State_v_Moriarty/112590.pdf.
The Kansas Supreme Court also established a briefing schedule and set a hearing for November
6, 2014. Id.
Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order requiring the Defendants to allow same-sex couples to marry and to issue marriage licenses to otherwisequalified same-sex couples. A movant is entitled to a preliminary injunction if the movant can
5

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 6 of 11

establish the following: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the case; (2) irreparable injury to the movant if the preliminary injunction is denied; (3) the threatened injury to the
movant outweighs the injury to the other party under the preliminary injunction; and (4) the injunction is not adverse to the public interest. Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1125 (10th Cir.
2012). For injunctions seeking mandatory relief, the movant must make a “strong showing” with
regard to the likelihood of success on the merits and with regard to the balance of harms. Id. In
light of binding precedent from Kitchen and Bishop, Plaintiffs easily meet these requirements.
I.

Plaintiffs Have Made a Strong Showing They Are Substantially Likely To Succeed On The
Merits.
“State laws . . . regulating marriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of

persons.” United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2691 (2013). Plaintiffs’ request for
injunctive relief seeks from the Court only what Kitchen expressly holds: “A state may not deny
the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based
solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union.” Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1199. The Tenth
Circuit’s decision is binding on this Court. See United States v. Spedalieri, 910 F.2d 707, 709 n.2
(10thCir. 1990) (“A district court must follow the precedent of this circuit”); Phillips v. Moore,
164 F. Supp. 2d 1245, 1258 (D. Kan. 2001) (“The [district] court, of course, is bound by circuit
precedent”) (citing Spedalieri).
In light of Kitchen and Bishop, the outcome of this case is a foregone conclusion. Because the Kansas laws and practices in question have virtually identical scopes and effects to
those overturned in Kitchen, the Kansas provisions are also unconstitutional. See Kitchen, 755
F.3d at 1230 (holding that both state constitutional amendments and “similar statutory enactments” limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violate the Equal Protection and Due Process
6

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 7 of 11

Clauses). As was also true of the Oklahoma marriage ban struck down by the Tenth Circuit, in
this case the Court’s “merits disposition is governed by [the] ruling in Kitchen.” Bishop, 760
F.3d at 1074. Because Kansas’s statutory definition of marriage and refusal to recognize the
valid marriages of same-sex couples do precisely what the Tenth Circuit held to be unconstitutional, there is an overwhelming probability that Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits.
II.

Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm If A Preliminary Injunction Does Not Issue.
There is no question that Plaintiffs suffer irreparable harm every day that Kansas’s un-

constitutional marriage bans remain in force. Deprivation of constitutional rights “for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable harm.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.
347, 373 (1976); see also Awad, 670 F.3d at 1131 (“Furthermore, when an alleged constitutional
right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”)
(citation omitted); Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 (6th Cir. 2001) (“[W]hen reviewing a
motion for preliminary injunction, if it is found that a constitutional right is being threatened or
impaired, a finding of irreparable injury is mandated.”); Quinly v. City of Prairie Village, 446
F.Supp.2d 1233, 1237-38 (D. Kan. 2006) (same).
Aside from the unquestionable irreparable harm suffered by Plaintiffs due to the Defendants’ refusal to allow Plaintiffs to enjoy the fundamental right to marry their partners, Kansas’s
treatment of Plaintiffs’ relationships as lesser than the relationships of opposite-sex couples who
are married or want to become married stigmatizes and demeans them, causes them anxiety and
stress, and harms their dignity as individuals and as couples. As recognized by the Tenth Circuit,
laws that treat same-sex couples as lesser than opposite-sex couples for purposes of marriage
“impose[] a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex
marriages.” Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1207 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2963). Laws that discrim7

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 8 of 11

inate against same-sex couples undermine “both the public and private significance” of same-sex
couples’ relationships by telling those couples, and all the world, that their marriages are unworthy of recognition. Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1207 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2964). Such laws
“‘humiliate[] tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples’ by making ‘it
even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family
and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.’” Kitchen, 755
F.3d at 1207 (quoting Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2964). With the passage of each day, these harms
accumulate. The United States Supreme Court “has long recognized that marriage is the ‘most
important relation in life.’” Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1209 (quoting Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190,
205 (1888)). The harms to Plaintiffs’ dignity that result from being deprived of this most important relation should be considered particularly irreparable because they cannot be adequately
compensated for in the form of monetary damages. See Awad, 670 F.3d at 1131; Prairie Band of
Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, 1251 (10th Cir. 2001). To continue to deny Plaintiffs the enjoyment and benefits of one of the most important liberties in life is to continue to irreparably harm them.
III.

The Harm To Plaintiffs Substantially Outweighs Any Harm To The Defendants.
The balance of harms tips decidedly in favor of Plaintiffs. Under binding Tenth Circuit

precedent Kansas’s marriage bans are unconstitutional, and it is well established that “when a
law is likely unconstitutional, the interests of those the government represents, such as voters do
not outweigh a plaintiff’s interest in having its constitutional rights protected.” Hobby Lobby
Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1145 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (plurality) (quoting
Awad, 670 F.3d at 1131), aff’d, 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). Thus, “if the moving party establishes a
likelihood of success on the merits, the balance of harms normally favors granting preliminary
8

Case 2:14-cv-02518 Document 4 Filed 10/13/14 Page 9 of 11

injunctive relief because the public interest is not harmed by preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of a statute that is probably unconstitutional.” ACLU of Ill. v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583,
589–90 (7th Cir. 2012). See also Quinly, 446 F.Supp.2d at 1237 (quoting Alvarez).
Before the Supreme Court denied petitions for certiorari in Kitchen, Bishop, and similar
cases from the Fourth and Seventh Circuits, some courts had denied preliminary relief or stayed
enforcement of injunctions to prevent confusion that would ostensibly result if a state were
forced to allow same-sex couples to marry pursuant to a lower court judgment that was subsequently reversed on appeal, Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1230 (staying mandate pending disposition of
petition for certiorari). But the Supreme Court’s decision on October 6 to deny certiorari and
allow the lower courts’ judgments to go into effect demonstrates that such stays are no longer
warranted. If the Supreme Court merely wanted to delay review until a circuit split arises, the
Supreme Court could have simply “held” the petitions and not taken any action on them until it
was prepared to grant certiorari in a case raising this issue. Instead, the Supreme Court denied
review outright, sending a strong signal that any remaining doubt about the Supreme Court’s ultimate resolution of the legal issue does not justify continuing to deny same-sex couples the freedom to marry.
IV.

Injunctive Relief Is In The Public Interest.
“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional

rights.” Hobby Lobby, 723 F.3d at 1145 (quoting Awad, 670 F.3d at 1131-32). “While the public
has an interest in the will of the voters being carried out . . . the public has a more profound and
long-term interest in upholding an individual’s constitutional rights.” Awad, 670 F.3d at 1132.
Accordingly, the relief requested serves the interest of the Plaintiffs, the Defendants and other
district court clerks, and the People of Kansas.

V.

A Temporary Restraining Order Is Warranted In This Case.
A party who is entitled to injunctive relief may also seek a temporary restraining order

upon a summary showing of immediate and irreparable injury. Given the constitutional magnitude of the issues at stake for the Plaintiffs in this case, the irreparable nature of the injuries to
the Plaintiffs, and the high likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs respectfully request that
the Court issue a temporary restraining order, for the maximum allowable time period under Fed.
R. Civ. P. 65, requiring Defendants to issue or permit issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex
couples, including the Plaintiffs, pursuant to the same restrictions and limitations applicable to
opposite-sex couples, and without regard to the gender or sexual-orientation of the applicants.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs are overwhelmingly likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional
claims and are suffering significant and irreparable harm every day that Kansas excludes them
from marriage. The balance of equities strongly favors an injunction, and an injunction is in the
public interest. Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue a preliminary injunction: (1) enjoining Defendants and their officers, employees, and agents from enforcing article 15, §16 of the Kansas Constitution, Kansas Statutes Annotated §§ 23-2501 and 23-2508, and
any other sources of state law to exclude same-sex couples from marriage, and (2) requiring Defendants and their officers, employees, and agents in their official capacities to permit issuance
of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, pursuant to the same restrictions and limitations applicable to different-sex couples’ freedom to marry, and to recognize marriages validly entered into
by Plaintiffs.

Plaintiffs request such injunction remain in effect until entry of final judgment in this action. Plaintiffs further request a temporary restraining order as set forth above.
