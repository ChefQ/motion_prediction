Case No. 14-cv-2518-DDC-TJJ

PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING ABSTENTION
The Court requested briefing on possible abstention issues in this case, presumably
because of the filing and pendency of the mandamus petition before the Kansas Supreme Court.
See State of Kansas ex rel. Schmidt v. Moriarty, Case No. 112,590 (Kan., filed Oct. 10, 2014),
available at http://www.kscourts.org/State_v_Moriarty/112590.pdf.1 The Court specifically
mentioned abstention under Railroad Comm’n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941) (Pullman
abstention) and under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971) (Younger abstention). Plaintiffs
brief will treat those two abstention doctrines as well as abstention under Colorado River Water
Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813 (1976) (Colorado River).
“In the main, federal courts are obliged to decide cases within the scope of federal
jurisdiction. Abstention is not in order simply because a pending state-court proceeding involves
the same subject matter.” Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584, 588 (2013).

The Kansas Supreme Court noted, in its Order dated October 10, 2014, that “the Attorney
General’s right to relief on the merits is not clear, nor is it apparent per the Rule ‘that no valid
defense to the petition can be offered,’ given the Tenth Circuit’s decisions in Kitchen v. Herbert,
755 F.3d 1193, 1199 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 83 U.S.L.W. 3102 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014), and Bishop
v. Smith, 760 F.3d 1070 (10th Cir.), cert denied, 83 U.S.L.W. 3102 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014).” See
Order, available at http://www.kscourts.org/State_v_Moriarty/112590.pdf.

“[T]here is no doctrine that the availability or even the pendency of state judicial proceedings
excludes the federal courts.” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New
Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 373 (1989) (hereafter “NOPSI”). Abstention under any doctrine is the
exception, not the rule. See Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 813; NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368.
Accordingly, every federal court in the past year that has been asked to abstain from
adjudicating the constitutionality of state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage has
rejected the request, See Guzzo v. Mead, 2:14-cv-0020, ECF #44, at 7-9 (D. Wyo. Oct. 17, 2014)
(rejecting abstention) (copy attached at Doc. 7-1); Burns v. Hickenlooper, No. 14–cv–01817–
RM–KLM, 2014 WL 3634834, at *5 n.3 (D. Colo., July 23, 2014); Wolf v. Walker, No. 14–cv–
64–bbc, 2014 WL 1207514 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 24, 2014); McGee v. Cole, 993 F. Supp. 2d 639,
646 (S.D. W. Va. 2014). Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to do the same.
Pullman Abstention
Under Pullman, “federal courts should abstain from decision when difficult and unsettled
questions of state law must be resolved before a substantial federal constitutional question can be
decided. . . . Pullman abstention is limited to uncertain questions of state law because
‘[a]bstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the rule.’” Hawaii
Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 236 (1984), quoting from Colorado River, 424 U.S. at
813. “Where there is no ambiguity in the state statute, the federal court should not abstain but
should proceed to decide the federal constitutional claim. We would negate the history of the
enlargement of the jurisdiction of the federal district courts, if we held the federal court should

2

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 3 of 10

stay its hand and not decide the question before the state courts decided it.” Wisconsin v.
Constantineau, 400 US 433, 439 (1971) (citation and footnote omitted).
The Tenth Circuit has held that, “[u]nder Pullman abstention, a district court should
abstain if three conditions are satisfied: (1) an uncertain issue of state law underlies the federal
constitutional claim; (2) the state issues are amenable to interpretation and such an interpretation
obviates the need for or substantially narrows the scope of the constitutional claim; and (3) an
incorrect decision of state law by the district court would hinder important state law policies.”
Lehman v. City of Louisville, 967 F. 2d 1474, 1478 (10th Cir. 1992). The fact that a case
pending in state court could have some impact on the issues pending in federal court is
insufficient to trigger Pullman abstention. Petrella v. Brownback, 980 F. Supp. 2d 1293, 1298-99
(D. Kan. 2013) (rejecting Pullman abstention where case involved “no unsettled question of state
law that should first be addressed by the state courts”).
In this case, the meaning of the challenged state constitutional and statutory provisions is
absolutely clear. The challenged laws unequivocally prohibit plaintiffs and other same-sex
couples from obtaining a marriage license and marrying a person of the same sex in Kansas. See
Kan. Const. art. 15, §16; Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 23-2501 and 23-2508. Thus, because this case
involves no uncertain issue of state law, Pullman abstention would be inappropriate. Lehman,
967 F.2d at 1478.
Younger Abstention
A unanimous Supreme Court in Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584,
(2013), recently declared in emphatic terms that Younger abstention is strictly limited to criminal

3

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 4 of 10

or quasi-criminal contexts and does not extend to “all parallel state and federal proceedings”
involving an “important state interest.” Id. at 593.
In Younger, plaintiff asked a federal court to enjoin enforcement of the allegedly
unconstitutional California Criminal Syndicalism Act despite the fact that plaintiff was then a
defendant in a state court prosecution under that law. The Court held that lower federal courts
should decline to enjoin state criminal prosecutions absent a “showing of bad faith, harassment,
or any other unusual circumstance that would call for equitable relief.” Younger, 401 U.S. at 54.
A few years later, the Court extended Younger to bar federal injunctive relief in “a state [civil]
proceeding which in important respects is more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil
cases.” Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 US 592, 604 (1975).2 Finally, the Court held that Younger
abstention applies to “civil proceedings involving certain orders ... uniquely in furtherance of the
state courts’ ability to perform their judicial functions.” NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368 (citing Juidice v.
Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 336, n. 12 (1977) (civil contempt order), and Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc.,
481 U.S. 1, 13 (1987) (state appeal bond requirement)). In NOPSI, however, the Court made
clear that “only exceptional circumstances justify a federal court’s refusal to decide a case in
deference to the States” under Younger. 491 U.S. at 368. In Sprint Communications, Inc. v.
Jacobs, moreover, the Court expressly held that “Younger extends to the three ‘exceptional
circumstances’ identified in NOPSI, but no further.” 134 S. Ct. at 594.

2

Cases falling into this category include state bar disciplinary proceedings and other state law
civil enforcement proceedings. See NOPSI, 134 S. Ct. at 592 (collecting cases).
4

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 5 of 10

Plaintiffs’ case in this Court does not present any of “the three ‘exceptional
circumstances’ identified in NOPSI.” Specifically, there is no pending criminal or quasi-criminal
civil enforcement case pending in state court; nor are plaintiffs seeking to enjoin any such state
court case. Furthermore, the present federal case does not purport to interfere with any “civil
proceedings involving certain orders ... uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to
perform their judicial functions,” such as a judicial contempt order or a state appeal bond
requirement. NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368.
Sprint makes crystal clear that because this case does not fall within one of three
exceptional categories in NOPSI, abstention is not permissible.
Colorado River Doctrine
The Tenth Circuit has said “the Colorado River Doctrine springs from the desire for
judicial economy, rather than from constitutional concerns about federal-state
comity.” Rienhardt v. Kelly, 164 F.3d 1296, 1303 (10th Cir. 1999). Colorado River presented
the Court with a case involving a federal suit to determine water rights along the Colorado River.
While the federal case was being litigated, the parties were also litigating a parallel case in a state
court. After concluding that “this case falls within none of the abstention categories,” including
Pullman and Younger abstention, the Court considered whether “there are principles unrelated to
considerations of proper constitutional adjudication and regard for federal-state relations which
govern in situations involving the contemporaneous exercise of concurrent jurisdictions, either
by federal courts or by state and federal courts.” 424 U.S. at 817. Ultimately, the Court
concluded that “the circumstances permitting the dismissal of a federal suit due to the presence

5

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 6 of 10

of a concurrent state proceeding for reasons of wise judicial administration are considerably
more limited than the circumstances appropriate for abstention.” Id. at 818. As part of the
Colorado River analysis, the Court mentioned the following factors: the inconvenience of the
federal forum, the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation, and the order in which
jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums; and it noted that “[n]o one factor is
necessarily determinative; a carefully considered judgment taking into account both the
obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors counselling against that
exercise of jurisdiction is required. Only the clearest of justifications will warrant dismissal.”
424 U.S. at 818-820 (citations omitted).
Here, there is no judicial economy concern because binding Tenth Circuit precedent
dictates the result in this case. Moreover, concerns about interfering with state proceedings are
dealt with under Younger abstention, which – as noted above – does not apply in this case. In
fact, by applying controlling circuit precedent and declaring the challenged provisions of the
Kansas Constitution and statutes unconstitutional, the Court here would be rendering assistance
to the Kansas Supreme Court, which will not have to address whether federal precedent from the
Tenth Circuit is binding in state courts. This court’s straightforward application of binding
circuit precedent advances judicial economy instead of hindering it.
In addition, the mandamus case and this lawsuit are not parallel proceedings for purposes
of Colorado River because the cases involve different parties and different claims.3 The

3

“Suits are parallel if substantially the same parties litigate substantially the same issues in
different forums.” Fox v. Maulding, 16 F.3d 1079, 1081 (10th Cir.1994).
6

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 7 of 10

mandamus case is between two governmental officials, the Kansas Attorney General as
petitioner against the Chief Judge of the Johnson County District Court and the clerk of that
court as respondents. The plaintiffs here are not involved in the mandamus case in any
way. Moreover, the mandamus case aims to prohibit the respondents from accepting
applications and issuing marriage licenses in defiance of the Kansas laws that clearly limit
marriage to “one man and one woman.” Not only does the mandamus case have nothing to do
with issuance of marriage licenses in Douglas and Sedgwick Counties – where plaintiffs seek to
obtain licenses – but the state forum offers no protection for plaintiffs’ rights. Cf. Wolf, 2014
WL 1207514, at *5 (“Plaintiffs have the right under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to bring a lawsuit to
vindicate their own constitutional rights.”).
Finally, the fact that this case presents a federal constitutional question dictated by federal
precedent strongly weighs in favor of exercising jurisdiction. See Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v.
Mercury Const., 460 U.S. 1, 26 (1983) (“[T]he presence of federal-law issues must always be a
major consideration weighing against surrender” of jurisdiction under Colorado River); Burns,
2014 WL 3634834, at *5 n.3 (“This Court declines to abstain from deciding, and thus to defer to
the state, matters of federal constitutional law.”).
Conclusion
None of the abstention doctrines apply to this case. As the Supreme Court noted only last
term,
Federal courts, it was early and famously said, have “no more right to
decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that
which is not given.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404, 5 L.Ed.
257 (1821). Jurisdiction existing, this Court has cautioned, a federal
7

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 8 of 10

court’s “obligation” to hear and decide a case is “virtually unflagging.”
Parallel state-court proceedings do not detract from that obligation.
Sprint Communications, 134 S. Ct. at 591-92 (citation omitted). Given the fast pace of
developments in similar cases around the country since the Supreme Court denied certiorari in
Kitchen, Bishop, and the other marriage equality cases on October 6, 2014, plaintiffs respectfully
urge the Court to exercise its jurisdiction over this case and to enter a preliminary injunction
against the challenged Kansas laws prohibiting same-sex marriage consistent with the controlling
circuit precedent.
Against the backdrop of binding circuit precedent, abstention would cause extreme
prejudice to Plaintiffs by delaying them from vindicating constitutional rights that have already
been clearly established and declared by the Tenth Circuit. In the two weeks since the Supreme
Court denied petitions for certiorari in other marriage equality cases, the Ninth Circuit has joined
the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits in holding that state laws excluding same-sex couples
from marrying violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Latta v. Otter, Nos. 14–35420, 14–35421,
12–17668, 2014 WL 4977682 (9th Cir. Oct. 7, 2014). Every district court within those four
circuits has rejected attempts by other states to argue that the circuit’s binding precedent is
somehow distinguishable from the marriage bans at issue in their own states. See See Guzzo v.
Mead, 2:14-cv-0020, ECF #44, at 7-9 (D. Wyo. Oct. 17, 2014) (Wyoming); Majors v. Horne, --F. Supp. 3d ----, 2014 WL 5286743 (D. Ariz. Oct 17, 2014) (Arizona); Fisher-Borne v. Smith,
--- F.Supp.3d ----, 2014 WL 5138922 (M.D.N.C., Oct. 14, 2014) (North Carolina); Hamby v.
Parnell, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2014 WL 5089399 (D. Alaska, Oct. 12, 2014) (Alaska); General
Synod of the United Church of Christ v. Resinger, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2014 WL 5092288,
8

Case 2:14-cv-02518-DDC-TJJ Document 7 Filed 10/18/14 Page 9 of 10

(W.D.N.C. Oct. 10, 2014). Similarly, the Supreme Court has rejected all requests by states for a
stay of lower court injunctions. See Otter v. Latta, No. 14A374 (U.S. Oct 10, 2014) (denying
stay request from Idaho); Parnell v. Hamby, No. 14A413 (U.S. Oct 17, 2014) (denying stay
request from Alaska).
Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court rule now to bring Kansas into line with
binding circuit precedent. Plaintiffs should not be prevented from vindicating their Fourteenth
Amendment rights while Kansas state officials engage in a futile exercise to delay the inevitable.
