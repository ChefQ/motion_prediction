CRST’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO RECONSIDER
Defendant CRST Expedited, Inc. (“CRST”), hereby responds in opposition to Plaintiff’s
Motion to Reconsider Summary Judgment [Dkt. #107] (the “Motion). This Court correctly
granted summary judgment in CRST’s favor, and it should not revisit the matter.
I.
NO BASIS EXISTS FOR RECONSIDERATION.
Plaintiff asks this Court to vacate its Opinion and Order [Dkt #100], under which it
granted summary judgment in favor of CRST (the “Summary Judgment Order”). His basis for
reconsideration is Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); however, reconsideration motions “are inappropriate
vehicles to reargue an issue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances
new arguments, or supporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.”
Servants of the Paraclete v. Catholic Mutual Relief Soc. of Amer., 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th
Cir.2000). Reconsideration is “not appropriate to revisit issues already addressed or advance
arguments that could have been raised in prior briefing.” Id. (citing Van Skiver v. United States,
952 F.2d 1241, 1243 (10th Cir.1991)). Put another way, “[a] Rule 59(e) motion is not a second
chance to direct the court to revisit issues already addressed or to present new arguments or

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 108 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/08/15 Page 2 of 6

supporting facts that could have been presented originally.” Kearns v. Johnson County Adult
Detention Center, 2006 WL 1006884 at *1 (D.Kan.)(citing Vanskiver).
In CRST’s summary judgment motion [Dkt #42] (the “CRST MSJ” or “CRST Motion”),
CRST raised undisputed facts bearing on the issue of ‘prior express consent’ under the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. § 227 (“TCPA”):
3.
In 2006, Plaintiff was actively looking for employment in the
trucking industry as a truck driver and contacted several trucking companies
throughout the country regarding employment opportunities. [Exhibit 2, Answer
to Interrogatory No. 5]
4.
On January 13, 2006, Plaintiff contacted CRST’s recruiting
department regarding employment opportunities by direct inquiry with a recruiter
or via an internet inquiry on a trucking recruiting website, and during that
exchange, Plaintiff provided his name, mailing address, primary phone number,
cell phone number and email address. [Exhibit 1, ¶ 3]
5.
Plaintiff provided 319-230-6334 as his primary phone number to
CRST. [Exhibit 1, ¶ 4]
6.
#02, ¶ 28]

Plaintiff’s cell phone number is 319-230-6334. [Complaint, Dkt

CRST MSJ at pp.1-2, ¶¶ 3-6. Plaintiff had every opportunity to attempt to controvert CRST’s
facts1 or meet its arguments in his response but elected not do so, even though CRST argued
specifically that Plaintiff had given prior express consent to be contacted on his cell phone or
landline, in the CRST Motion. Id. at pp.7-11.2

1

Plaintiff’s only alleged fact relating to consent related only to “express written consent,” a
different issue than prior express consent. See Response at p.2, ¶ 5; Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment [Dkt #61] at p.3, ¶ 6, made the subject of CRST’s Motion to Strike [Dkt #75] at pp.2-3, ¶ 2.
2
CRST’s argument was consistent FCC orders explaining that “the persons who knowingly
release their phone number have in effect given their invitation or permission to be called at the number
which they have been given, absent instructions to the contrary.” Report and Order (In the matter of
Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991), 2012 WL 507959,
27 FCC Rcd. 1830, ¶ 7 & n.20 (F.C.C.)(the “2012 TCPA Order”), summarizing the FCC’s findings in the
Report and Order (In the matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991), 7 FCC Rcd. 8752, ¶ 31 (F.C.C.1992) (the “1992 TCPA Order”). In addition, the
district court in Aderhold v. Car2go N.A., LLC, 2014 WL 794802 (W.D.Wash.), noted that some courts

2

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 108 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 05/08/15 Page 3 of 6

Plaintiff’s admission at footnote 4 of his Motion that, “In retrospect [he] could have
briefed the express consent more extensively,” and that the issue of prior express consent “was
clearly raised in [Plaintiff’s] Motion and Reply,” is reason enough to deny Rule 59(e) relief.
Motion at p.5 & n.4. See also Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt #74]
at pp.18-19 (urging prior express consent and citing authorities providing for prior express
consent); Plaintiff’s Reply [DKt #89] at pp. 7-8 (addressing same). Plaintiff’s Motion simply
rehashes arguments that were urged or could have been urged during summary judgment
briefing. As the Tenth Circuit instructs, Plaintiff’s Motion is improper and should be denied.
II.
THIS COURT SHOULD NOT VACATE THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT ORDER
Embedded in this Court’s Summary Judgment Order is its finding of all facts necessary to
support the fact that Plaintiff did give CRST prior express consent, consistent with the arguments
and authorities advanced in the CRST Motion and CRST’s response to Plaintiff’s summary
judgment motion. The Court specifically determined:
Salmon contacted numerous trucking companies concerning employment
opportunities, and CRST received information that Salmon was looking for
employment as a truck driver. [Dkt. #43-1, at 1] CRST received this information
from either a direct request to CRST or from a recruiting website, but Salmon
provided his name, mailing address, home phone number, cell phone number, and
email address to CRST. Dkt. # 42-1, at 3; Dkt. # 61, at…31.

take a “broad view of ‘prior express consent,’ suggesting that anyone who provides a cellular phone
number to a business consents to the business’s use of the number to contact him or her.” Id. at *4 (citing
cases). When people provide their telephone numbers in commercial transactions, it would be odd to
imagine that they do not consent to being contacted for purposes of completing that transaction.” Id. at
*8. See also Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc., 768 F.3d 1110, 1118 (11th Cir.2014)(citing the
1992 TCPA Order, noting, in the context of telemarketing (not present with CRST), the FCC specifically
referenced the House report that recognized that “if a person knowingly releases his phone number, calls
are permitted because ‘the called party had in essence requested the contact by providing the caller with
their telephone number for use in normal business communications”).

Summary Judgment Order at p.2. Noting that CRST had sought summary judgment on the
TCPA claim because its employment ad was not ‘telemarketing’ and “because Plaintiff gave his
consent to receiver communications from CRST” (Id. at p.5), the Court then determined, “CRST
is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s TCPA claim because it did not engage in any
prohibited conduct….” Id. at p.10. Then, the Court concluded:
CRST’s conduct in this case was at least partially consensual, because Plaintiff
admits that he voluntarily provided his contact information to a recruiting website
for truck drivers and should have expected to receive calls about potential
employment as a truck driver. In any event, CRST could not have been
substantially certain that it lacked plaintiff’s permission to contact him about
potential employment as a truck driver, and there was not a nonconsensual
invasion on plaintiff’s seclusion.
Id. at p.13. The Court clearly found CRST committed no violation of the TCPA and that
Plaintiff’s provision of his contact information sufficiently met the standard for prior express
consent in the TCPA.3
CRST put forth sufficient facts to establish, and thereby established, Plaintiff’s express
consent had been voluntarily and willfully given by Plaintiff when he willingly provided his
contact information, including his specific primary/cell phone number. CRST MSJ at pp.1-2 (¶¶
3-7); at pp.7-11; Response to Plaintiff’s MSJ at pp.7 (¶ 22), 18-19. The Court, in its findings in
the Summary Judgment Order, agreed. Summary Judgment Order at pp.2, 5, 10, 13.

There is

Plaintiff’s reliance on Thrasher-Lyon v. CCS Commercial, LLC, 2012 WL 3835089 (N.D.Ill.),
is misplaced. The facts of Thrasher-Lyon are unmistakably incongruent with the 1992 TCPA Order and
other court holdings and, otherwise, stretched the limits of providing consent. The plaintiff in the case––
involved in a car accident––provided her cell phone number to the policeman who provided an incident
report. The insurer ultimately contacted her about subrogation, and assigned the claim to a collection
agent who used technology to contact her. Id. at *1. The district court determined that the only “carveout” for prior express consent to be given by merely providing contact information was a creditor-debtor
relationship, absent in the case before it. Id. at *4-5. As a different judge of the same court noted in
Martin v. Comcast Corp., 2013 WL 6229934 (N.D.Ill.), “Thrasher-Lyon involved, as Comcast points out
and as the district court judge recognized, an unusual set of facts. The plaintiff got into a car accident and
gave her phone number to the owner of the car she hit and the police. It was thus a stretch to claim that
she had consented.” Id. at *3.

simply no basis to revisit the Court’s ruling, predicated upon proper evidence, administrative
agency guidance and judicial decisions that establish Plaintiff’s prior express consent and
CRST’s non-violation of the TCPA.
WHEREFORE, CRST prays the Court will deny the Motion, grant CRST its attorneys’
fees and costs herein incurred pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, § 2011.1, and grant CRST such
other and further relief deemed to be just and proper.
