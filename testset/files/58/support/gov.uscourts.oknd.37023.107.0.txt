Case No. 14-CV-0265-CVE-TLW

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO RECONSIDER SUMMARY JUDGMENT
COMES NOW the plaintiff, Caleb Salmon, pro se, and respectfully submits his Motion
to Reconsider Summary Judgment regarding the Court’s Order of March 25, 2015 granting
summary judgment to Defendant CRST Expedited Inc. [Doc. 100]. In support thereof, Plaintiff
states as follows:
INTRODUCTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW
In the Court’s Order of March 25, it granted summary judgment to CRST Expedited Inc.
(“CRST”) without a finding of fact that Plaintiff gave specific oral or written express consent to
CRST to contact him with a prerecorded message. Plaintiff and CRST spent most of their crossmotions for summary judgment and responses arguing over whether the message was
informational under 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(1) requiring prior express consent or
advertising/telemarketing under 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(2) requiring prior express written
consent. However, Plaintiff did not give express consent under either regulation, and CRST
failed to carry its burden to show that Plaintiff provided the required express consent. In order to
prevail on its affirmative defense of express consent, CRST had to prove that Plaintiff gave
either oral or written express consent specifically to be contacted on his cell phone with a

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 107 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 04/22/15 Page 2 of 7

prerecorded message. Merely providing a phone number is insufficient to establish express
consent under the TCPA.
A motion for reconsideration under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) filed within [twenty-eight (28)]
days1 after a district court’s order granting summary judgment is treated as a motion to alter or
amend the judgment. Comm. for the First Amendment v. Campbell, 962 F.2d 1517, 1523 (10th
Cir. 1992). Proper grounds for granting such a motion include correcting manifest errors of law,
id., or that “the court has patently misunderstood a party, has made a decision outside the
adversarial issues presented, [or] has made a mistake not of reasoning but of apprehension...”
Gregg v. Am. Quasar Petroleum Co., 840 F. Supp. 1394, 1401 (D. Colo. 1991).
Rule 59(e) applies here. The Court granted summary judgment to CRST without a
finding of fact that Plaintiff gave express oral or written consent to auto-dialing and pre-recorded
messages sent by CRST eight years later. CRST failed to carry the burden of its affirmative
defense to prove that Plaintiff provided express oral or written consent to the auto-dialing and
prerecorded messages in its Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. Therefore,
summary judgment for Defendant CRST must be vacated, and judgment entered for Plaintiff.
ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
Express Consent is Required to Use an Auto-Dialer or a Prerecorded Message to Contact a
Cellular Phone.
CRST was required to obtain Plaintiff’s express consent to be contacted by an auto-dialer
or with a prerecorded message on his cellular phone under the TCPA. Whether a message is
informational, advertising or telemarketing, the FCC requires express consent to contact a
cellular phone. Express consent to receive an informational message may be either oral or
written, while consent to receive a telemarketing message must be written. However, either

way, express consent must be given. CRST must ask Plaintiff’s permission to use an autodialer or prerecorded message to contact his cell phone, and Plaintiff must grant such
permission orally or in writing.
...we maintain the existing consent rules for non-telemarketing, informational
calls, such as those by or on behalf of tax-exempt non-profit organizations, calls
for political purposes, and calls for other noncommercial purposes, including
those that deliver purely informational messages such as school closings. Our
rules for these calls will continue to permit oral consent if made to wireless
consumers and other specified recipients, and will continue to require no
prior consent if made to residential wireline consumers...
...such calls, to the extent that they do not contain telemarketing messages, would
not require any consent when made to residential wireline consumers, but require
either written or oral consent if made to wireless consumers and other
specified recipients.
In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of
1991, 27 FCC Rcd 1830, 1841, ¶28 (F.C.C. 2012) (“2012 TCPA Order”)(emphasis added). In
order to prevail on the affirmative defense of express consent, CRST must offer evidence that
Plaintiff gave his written or oral consent to be contacted on his cell phone with an auto-dialer or
by a prerecorded message. Plaintiff must have written or spoken substantively the following: “I,
Caleb Salmon, give CRST permission to use an auto-dialer or a prerecorded message to contact
my cellular telephone.” Plaintiff gave no such consent.
Without express consent, CRST was limited to calling Plaintiff’s cellular phone with a
human person. “[T]he TCPA requires not merely consent to be called, but consent to be called
with automatic dialing equipment.” Aderhold v. car2go N.A., LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
26320, 15 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 27, 2014) (citing Thrasher-Lyon v. CCS Commercial, LLC., No.
11-c-4473, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125203, at *2-3, *7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 4, 2012).2
The question requiring interpretation is: "consent to what?" [Defendant] argues
that the recipient need only give "general unrestricted permission and consent to

be called at the subject number," which [Plaintiff] concedes she gave. [Plaintiff],
on the other hand, contends that the exception is triggered only by explicit
consent to receive robocalls, which [Defendant] agrees that she did not give...
...The Court concludes that the statutory language is not ambiguous and that
[Plaintiff’s] interpretation adheres to the plain language of the provision,
consistent with its purpose and the context of the overall statute. The exception
for "prior express consent" appears parenthetically within a broad prohibition on
contacting cell phone subscribers using "any automatic telephone dialing system
or an artificial or prerecorded voice." Thus, the sentence in which the exception
appears applies specifically, and only, to calls made with robocall technology...
...[Congress’s] protective purpose, and its implementation by way of restricting
the use of certain technology, further supports the view that the consumer must
give "prior express consent" to robocalls—not to telephone calls in general—if
they are to receive the automated calls that the legislature deemed invasive.
Thrasher-Lyon v. CCS Commer., LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125203, 6-7, 9 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 4,
2012)(citations omitted, emphasis added).
Plaintiff’s situation presents precisely the same question as Thrasher-Lyon. Was the
provision of Plaintiff’s number “general unrestricted permission” or did CRST require explicit
consent to send robocalls and prerecorded message to Plaintiff’s cellular phone? Like ThrasherLyon and Aderhold, Plaintiff did not give express consent to receive robocalls on his celluar
phone. If implied consent was sufficient to receive “informational” calls under 47 C.F.R. §
64.1200(a)(1), the express consent provision of the regulation is meaningless. 3

However,

express consent is clearly required.
Respectfully, the Court erred when it granted summary judgment to CRST without
finding that Plaintiff gave express consent of any kind, written or oral. [Doc. 100]. CRST must
offer evidence to prove Plaintiff provided oral or written express consent to be contacted with an
3

The only exception to this “express consent” rule is when the recipient has knowingly created a debt by
voluntarily opening an account or otherwise contracting to pay for some service. See Osorio v. State Farm Bank,
F.S.B., 859 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70466, 2012 WL 1671780 (S.D. Fla. May 10, 2012) (number
provided on credit card application). Consent may be implied in the creditor-debtor relationship; however that is
the sole exception. See In Re Rules and Regulations Implementing the TCPA of 1991, 23 FCCR 559, 2008 WL 65485,
at *3 (Jan. 4, 2008). Plaintiff had no such relationship with CRST.

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 107 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 04/22/15 Page 5 of 7

auto-dialer or pre-recorded message to his cellular phone. It has not and cannot do so, because
Plaintiff provided no such consent.
CRST Failed to Carry Its Burden to Prove Plaintiff Provided Express Written or Oral Consent
to be Contacted by An Auto-Dialer or Prerecorded Message to Plaintiff’s Cellular Phone.
Express consent is an affirmative defense. Levy v. Receivables Performance Mgmt.,
LLC, 972 F. Supp. 2d 409, 417 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). “’Prior express consent’ is, therefore, an
affirmative defense to an alleged TCPA violation, for which the defendant bears the burden of
proof.” See Grant v. Capital Mgmt. Servs., L.P., 449 Fed. Appx. 598, 600 n. 1 (9th Cir.2011)
(citing In re Rules Implementing the TCPA of 1991, 23 FCC Rcd. 559, 565 (2008)). CRST bears
the burden of proof on an affirmative defense. Plaintiff presented evidence in his Motion for
Summary Judgment which sets out a prima facie case for a TCPA violation. CRST entirely fails
to offer any evidence that Plaintiff provided either oral or written express consent to be contacted
on his cellular phone with an auto-dialer or a prerecorded message in its Response. Plaintiff
raised this issue in his Motion for Summary Judgment and his Reply.4 [Doc. 61 pg. 7, ¶26, pg.
12-13; Doc. 89 pg. 7-8]. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate for Plaintiff and not
CRST.
The express consent provision of the TCPA as applied to cellular phones exists because
society and the telecommunications industry could not bear the result of an implied consent rule.
If Plaintiff was subject to robocalls and prerecorded messages from every person or entity to
whom he provided his cellular phone number to in his entire life, together with their successors
and assigns, he would be flooded with unwanted spam texts, calls and voicemails. Switching his
phone number would not work because he would simply inherit the robodials of the phone
number’s predecessor. Revoking his “implied consent” to each of them and their successors and
4

In retrospect, Plaintiff could have briefed the express consent issue more extensively. Nevertheless, it was clearly
raised in his Motion and Reply.

Case 4:14-cv-00265-CVE-TLW Document 107 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 04/22/15 Page 6 of 7

assigns would be a Herculean task, one for which the TCPA relieves him. The vast majority of
businesses and persons to whom Plaintiff has provided his cellular phone number over the years
have respected Plaintiff’s withholding of consent, obeyed the TCPA, and left Plaintiff’s phone
alone. CRST must follow the TCPA like everyone else.
The TCPA “plac[es] the burden on the technology users rather than the consumers, who
are ill-equipped to mitigate the nuisance.” See Lozano v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 702
F. Supp. 2d 999, 1011 (N.D. Ill. 2010) ("[T]he TCPA serves a significant government interest of
minimizing the invasion of privacy caused by unsolicited telephone communications to
consumers."). This protective purpose, and its implementation by way of restricting the use of
certain technology, further supports the view that the consumer must give "prior express
consent" to robocalls—not to telephone calls in general—if they are to receive the
automated calls that the legislature deemed invasive. Thrasher-Lyon, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
125203 at 9.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Plaintiff prays this Court vacate summary
judgment for Defendant CRST Expedited Inc. granted on March 25, 2015 and enter summary
judgment requested for Plaintiff, or in the alternative set the matter for trial and all other relief
deemed just and proper by the Court.
