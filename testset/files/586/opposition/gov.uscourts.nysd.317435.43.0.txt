Non-parties 570 Park Avenue Apartments, Inc. (“570 Park”), 580 Park Avenue,
Inc. (“580 Park”), The Beekman Tenants Corporation (“Beekman”) (collectively, the “Coalition
Members”), and Susan Relyea, as Member of the Co-Op Board of 580 Park (“Ms. Relyea”)
(hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the “Neighbors”) submit this memorandum in
opposition to the motion to compel compliance with subpoenas served upon the Coalition
Members and Ms. Relyea by Plaintiff Third Church of Christ, Scientist, of New York City
(“Plaintiff”) and in support of their cross-motion to quash. Plaintiff’s motion to compel was filed
in response to the written objections made, pursuant to FRCP Rule 45(c)(2)(B), by the Coalition
Members and Ms. Relyea.
INTRODUCTION
The instant controversy involves a discovery dispute between Plaintiff and the
non-party Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea. It is respectfully submitted that to properly
determine the issues raised herein, it is critical to review the context of the dispute. Plaintiff
attempts to justify the overbearing discovery requests against the Coalition Members and Ms.
Relyea on the grounds of alleged improper pressure placed upon the New York City Department
of Buildings (“DOB”). In fact, as demonstrated in the Declaration of Phyllis H. Weisberg, dated
May 5, 2008, it was the Plaintiff and its Tenant-Caterer who engaged in misrepresentations in
seeking approval for an improper commercial use of the church building; the Coalition Members
and Ms. Relyea were properly exercising their First Amendment rights to petition the
government for redress of grievances in connection with such improper use.
Plaintiff brought this lawsuit to force the City and Defendant Patricia J. Lancaster,
in her official capacity as Commissioner of the DOB to permit a non-accessory commercial
catering use at its church premises at 583 Park Avenue in violation of the City’s zoning

1

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB

Document 43

Page 6 of 26

regulations as they relate to residential districts. In the Plaintiff’s Complaint and instant Motion
to Compel, Plaintiff tries to place the Coalition1 in a negative light for purportedly being the
catalyst that caused the DOB, on November 30, 2007, to revoke Plaintiff’s accessory use permit.
The Plaintiff’s gratuitous, pejorative and inflammatory allegations against the Coalition
Members and Ms. Relyea—i.e. that they, a group of “influential denizens of Park Avenue”,
organized a “NIMBY campaign,” “pressed pretextual complaints,” used “24-hour video
surveillance” to “spy” 2 and hired a lobbyist to refine their “spin” 3 -- are contrary to the facts.
Indeed, the City revoked the Plaintiff’s accessory use permit after it learned facts, evidenced by
the Plaintiff’s own contradictory, misleading and false filings with the City and New York State,
which the Coalition presented to it in a clear manner. See Declaration of Phyllis H. Weisberg.
Citizens, such as the Neighbors, have a legitimate role in presenting their
viewpoints to the governmental agencies such as the DOB. As recently demonstrated, the
DOB’s failure to investigate numerous public complaints about zoning and safety problems in
connection with the construction of a 43-story condominium—which the Commissioner admitted
was “mistakenly approved” because it was not zoned for a height above 30 stories—contributed
to the circumstances that led to a crane collapse. See Weisberg Decl. ¶6. An overworked DOB
needs to and should rely on the community in order to ensure that the information provided to it

The Coalition consists of cooperative apartment corporations that own the following buildings: 116 E. and 125 E.
63rd Street and 535, 550, 555, 563, 565, 570, 575, and 580 Park Avenue. These buildings are all located in the
immediate vicinity of Park Avenue and 63rd Street, where 583 Park is located. See Weisberg Decl. ¶1. Only 570
Park, 580 Park, Ms. Relyea and Beekman (575 Park Avenue), however, have received subpoenas from the Plaintiff.

See Weisberg Decl., footnote 5.

The Plaintiff states that the Coalition has done “far more than merely write a few letters to state their views,”
including hiring Howard Rubenstein “to help them refine their spin on what the Church is “really” doing.” See
Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Law at page 1. While it is true that the Coalition has been active in stating its views on
the Church’s commercial catering establishment, and has hired a public relations/lobbying person, the Plaintiff has
been no less active. See Weisberg Decl., footnote 4.

is accurate and its decisions are sound. This is all the more so when the issue is one of zoning
rather than construction since zoning is designed to maintain the character of the communities.
Given the extraordinary breadth of the subpoenas issued to the Neighbors,
concerned citizens, it seems Plaintiff is issuing such discovery to the Coalition Members in a bad
faith effort to quell the ongoing opposition and silence those who have exposed the improper
catering use for what it is and petitioned for redress in connection therewith. Plaintiff’s actions
have the effect of a SLAPP suit, which is prohibited under New York Civil Rights Law §70-a
because it retaliates against citizens’ public petition and participation. Additionally, Plaintiff’s
service of extraordinarily broad subpoenas on the Neighbors, as well as other non-parties – e.g.
the Riverside Church, St. Ignatius of Loyola Church and the Metropolitan Club – that are now
the subject of motion practice, suggests that Plaintiff, having been granted a temporary
restraining order that has been in effect for almost five (5) months, is using broad discovery that
engenders lengthy disputes as a possible way to postpone the preliminary injunction hearing and
continue the temporary restraining order.4
While the Beekman may be different from the other Coalition Members (strictly
residential buildings) and Ms. Relyea (a shareholder in one of the strictly residential buildings),
in that there is a small restaurant, Park Avenue Café, operated by the Beekman’s tenant in a
portion of the ground floor of its building, the Beekman is not similarly situated to the Plaintiff. 5
Further, unlike the Plaintiff, the Beekman’s tenant’s restaurant can only seat up to 75 persons or

In the context of determining whether a TRO can be appealed, it has been held that a TRO which continues until
resolution of the preliminary injunction motion and does not expire within 10-20 days under FRCP 65(b) becomes,
in effect, an appealable preliminary injunction. See In re Criminal Contempt Proceedings Against Crawford, 133
F.Supp.2d 249 (D.C.N.Y. 2001) citing Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 87-88 (1974); Pan Am. World Airways,
Inc. v. Flight Engineers’ Int’l Ass’n, PAA Chapter, AFL-CIO, 306 F.2d 840 (C.A.2d 1962).

Unlike the Plaintiff, the Beekman, an apartment hotel, is permitted to have a restaurant in its premises pursuant to
the City’s Zoning Resolution §12-10.

90 persons at a standing reception—a far cry from the massive catering hall for over 1000 people
that Plaintiff’s Tenant-Caterer operates, as described below and in the Weisberg Declaration.
Plaintiff’s assertion that the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea are objecting to
the subpoenas because they “do not want their conduct discovered,” is baseless. The Neighbors
have, in an attempt to resolve this matter without motion practice, stated in a letter dated April
25, 2008, that they are willing to produce relevant, non-privileged documents. See Weisberg
Decl. Ex. U. Plaintiff, however, essentially rejected this offer in its letter of April 28, 2008, in
which it demanded extensive and unwarranted additional materials. See Weisberg Decl. Ex. V.
This memorandum establishes that:
·

the Court’s discovery order does not authorize issuance of the subpoenas to the
Coalition Members or Ms. Relyea, who are not similarly situated and, therefore, the
subpoenas should be quashed in their entirety (see Point I, infra);

·

the Coalition Members’ and Ms. Relyea’s assertions of over-breadth and undue
burden are warranted, and, therefore, the subpoenas should be quashed and/or
modified (see Point II, infra);

·

the Coalition Members’ and Ms. Relyea’s assertion of work-product privilege is
permissible under federal case law, despite their being non-parties (see Point III,
infra); and

·

even if the Court agrees that the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea are subject to
discovery at this time, they are entitled to full or partial reimbursement of their costs
and/or additional time to compile the responsive documents and things (see Point IV,
infra).

BACKGROUND
The Declaration of Phyllis H. Weisberg, dated May 5, 2008, set forth background
information, which demonstrates that the alleged necessity for extraordinarily broad discovery of
the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea because they ‘improperly influenced’ the City is
pretextual and should be denied.
ARGUMENT
Under FRCP Rule 45 (“Subpoena”), subsection (c)(2)(B) (“Objections”), the
recipient of a subpoena duces tecum may serve “a written objection to inspecting, copying,
testing or sampling any or all of the materials.” In response, the serving party may make a
motion to compel production or inspection. See FRCP Rule 45(c)(2)(B)(i). Further, the order
compelling production or inspection “must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party’s
officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.” See FRCP Rule 45(c)(2)(B)(ii).
Additionally, under subsection (c)(3)(B) (“Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena”), on timely
motion, the court “must quash or modify a subpoena” that requires disclosure of privileged or
protected matter or subjects a person to undue burden. See FRCP Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(iii), (iv).
Case law indicates that subpoenas pose an unreasonable burden on non-parties if
they are permitted to degenerate into a pure fishing expedition. See Sea Tow Intern., Inc. v.
Pontin, 246 F.R.D. 421, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) citing United States v. Pelaez, No. 96 Cr. 464,
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11334, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 1997) (quashing subpoena where the
document request was “overbroad and a patent attempt at a forbidden ‘fishing expedition’”,
quoting United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 700, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974)).
Courts accord special weight to the burden on non-parties of producing documents for others
involved in litigation. See Ebbert v. Nassau County, No. CV 05-5445, 2007 WL 674725 at *4

I.

THE COURT’S MARCH 3, 2008 DISCOVERY ORDER DOES NOT
AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF THE SUBPOENAS TO THE
COALITION MEMBERS OR MS. RELYEA, WHO ARE NOT
SIMILARLY SITUATED, AND, THEREFORE, THE SUBPOENAS
SHOULD BE QUASHED IN THEIR ENTIRETY
The Court’s pre-hearing discovery order dated March 3, 2008 (“Order”) does not

expressly permit Plaintiff to issue any discovery to residential buildings, such as those owned by
the Coalition Members, in the Plaintiff’s neighborhood. See Pa Decl., Exs. J-M. Indeed, the
Order states that pre-hearing discovery can include:
requests for documents and depositions from several religious and
non-religious institutions that may conduct similar catered events
to those at issue in this matter, as well as document requests and
depositions of City officials who may have knowledge relevant to
the Church’s claims.
(emphasis added) See Pa Decl., Ex. A. Based upon the scope of the Order, the Coalition
Members, including the Beekman, and Ms. Relyea contend that Plaintiff has no legal right to
issue discovery at this point in the litigation, because they are not similarly situated: they do not
conduct any catered events, let alone similar catered events, at their buildings.
While the Beekman is different from the other subpoenaed parties-- Ms. Relyea (a
shareholder in one of the strictly residential buildings) and the other Coalition Members (strictly
residential buildings)-- in that there is a small restaurant, Park Avenue Café, operated by the
Beekman’s tenant in a portion of the ground floor of its sixteen (16) story building, the Beekman
is not similarly situated to the Plaintiff. Unlike the Plaintiff, the Beekman, an apartment hotel, is

6
194531.1

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB

permitted to have a restaurant6, Park Avenue Café, in its premises pursuant to the City’s Zoning
Resolution §12-10 (such restaurant is not limited to tenants only). See Weisberg Decl. ¶28.
Further, unlike the caterer in Plaintiff’s building, the Park Avenue Café—its Archive Room,
Townhouse and Kitchen Table combined-- can only seat up to 135 persons—a far cry from the
massive catering hall for over 1000 people that Plaintiff’s Tenant-Caterer operates.

See

Weisberg Decl. ¶29. Such place is not nearly comparable to the massive commercial catering
established at the church.
For the Plaintiff to suggest that the Park Avenue Café’s Townhouse, a private
dining room which seats a mere 50 guests, is a similarly situated “banquet facility” that has a
“robust” operation is disingenuous; even Plaintiff’s March 30, 2007 Confidential Private
Placement Memorandum, submitted to the New York State Attorney General and modified
apparently solely to silence community complaints – but not to change the operation-- does not
attempt to suggest that the Townhouse is potential “direct competition.”7 See Weisberg Decl.
¶21.

Even more revealing, Plaintiff’s original September 29, 2006 Confidential Private

Placement Memorandum lists “direct competition” that caters up to 2800 guests. See Id. Even
the Tenant-Caterer represented that it would not be financially feasible to operate catered events
of 100 persons or less at the church. See Weisberg Decl. ¶30.
Since the Plaintiff and the Coalition Members/Ms. Relyea are not comparable or
similarly situated, the testimony and documents sought are outside the scope of the Order.
________________________

The reason for having a restaurant in an apartment hotel, where the units are used for permanent occupancy but one
or more hotel services are provided, such as housekeeping, is because apartment hotels are designed with
kitchenettes, not full kitchens, so it is more comfortable and convenient for residents to dine at the restaurant. See
Weisberg Decl. ¶28.
7
Page 9 of the March 30, 2007 Confidential Private Placement Memorandum lists venues with estimated seated
dinner capacities of 200 through 700 guests as direct potential competition. Plaintiff previously stated in its
September 29, 2006 Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, submitted to the New York State Attorney
General, on page 15, that the venues comparable to it are those with seated dinner capacities of 400 to 2800 guests.
See Weisberg Decl. Ex. M.

Notwithstanding, Plaintiff takes the position that during the 90-day period granted in the Order,
Plaintiff has the right to pursue full, rather than limited, discovery. See Pa Decl., Ex. P. Plaintiff
argues that the Coalition Members’ and Ms. Relyea’s narrow reading of the Order is incorrect
because the Order says discovery can “include” and is not limited to the “examples” in the
Order, which it claims are merely illustrative. Because the discovery period is restricted to
ninety (90) days with no extensions, however, it does not make sense to interpret broadly the
Order to give Plaintiff full unrestricted discovery rights. But under Plaintiff’s interpretation,
discovery would be limitless both as to subject and categories of persons.
Most significantly, Plaintiff’s current “needs” for broad discovery are
contradicted by Plaintiff’s written representation to this Court on February 22, 2008 that only
“limited discovery” is sought. See Weisberg Decl. Ex. Q. In that letter, counsel for Plaintiff
stated that, “Plaintiff continues to believe that limited discovery of the City, as well as of nonparties, would help develop the factual record” (emphasis added). The fact that Plaintiff “needs”
in connection with its motion for a preliminary injunction all of the discovery sought by its
extraordinarily broad subpoenas, designed to provoke motion practice during the short discovery
period,8 appears to suggest that Plaintiff is trying to extend the temporary restraining order,
which has already been in effect for about five months, by fostering motion practice as to its
subpoenas.
Moreover, based on the allegations in the Complaint, it does not appear that
discovery from the Coalition Members or Ms. Relyea is relevant to Plaintiff’s motion for a

In addition to the Plaintiff’s instant Motion to Compel, according to the docket, The Metropolitan Club has filed a
Motion to Quash the subpoena pursuant to Rule 45 on the ground that the requests therein are irrelevant and an
undue burden on the Club. Additionally, both the Roman Catholic Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola and the
Riverside Church have opposed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel compliance with its subpoenas on the basis of privacy
and/or irrelevance.

preliminary injunction against Defendants. See Pa Decl., Ex. B. In its Motion to Compel,
Plaintiff has not indicated how discovery from the Coalition Members or Ms. Relyea will help it
prove any of the elements of its RLUIPA and Equal Protection claims. Even assuming, but not
conceding, that the Order’s scope includes discovery of these parties, as discussed below, the
broad nature of the requests goes well beyond the “limited discovery” contemplated by the
Order.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s subpoenas should be quashed entirely, including the

subpoena for Ms. Relyea’s deposition testimony.
II.

THE
COALITION
MEMBERS’
AND
MS.
RELYEA’S
ASSERTIONS OF OVER-BREADTH AND UNDUE BURDEN ARE
WARRANTED, AND, THEREFORE, THE SUBPOENAS SHOULD
BE QUASHED AND/OR MODIFIED

Assuming, without conceding, that Plaintiff has a need for the information contained in
the subpoenas, the need is outweighed by the burden upon the Coalition Members and Ms.
Relyea and availability elsewhere. Relevance is a factor in a balancing test that applies to nonparty subpoenas. Thus, an evaluation of undue burden requires the court to weigh the burden to
the subpoenaed party against the value of the information to the serving party and requires the
court to consider such factors as relevance, the need of the party for the documents, the breadth
of the document request, the time period covered by it, the particularity with which the
documents are described and the burden imposed. See Moon v. SCP Pool Corporation, 232
F.R.D. 633 (C.D. Cal. 2005) citing Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 228
F.R.D. 111, 113 (D. Conn. 2005) and United States v. IBM, 83 F.R.D. 97, 104 (S.D.N.Y. 1979).
A.

Plaintiff Readily Admitted The Temporal Scope Of The Subpoenas Is
Overbroad and Unduly Burdensome
In this case, it is unduly burdensome for the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea

to produce any and all documents for the period January 1, 2000 to the present, as the subject

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB

Page 14 of 26

controversy did not arise until late 2006 or early 2007, about one year after the Tenant-Caterer
signed the lease with the Plaintiff. See supra; also see Pa Decl. Exs. J-M. Although Plaintiff
was advised of this objection by letters dated April 10, 2008, and Plaintiff agreed that the
subpoenas were overbroad in their temporal scope in its letter of April 14, 2008 (Pa Decl., Ex.
P)—evidencing Plaintiff knew its request was “out of line”--Plaintiff had the audacity to
represent to the Court that “each objection” that KK&F has to the subpoenas “is baseless”. See
Memorandum of Law, p. 1. Plaintiff failed to limit the temporal scope of the subpoenas issued
not only to the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea, but also to the Riverside Church and St.
Ignatius of Loyola Church. See Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to
Compel The Riverside Church and St. Ignatius of Loyola at page 13. Such is evidence that
during this limited discovery period, Plaintiff is on a fishing expedition for documents, a
prohibited practice, and seemingly attempting to engender motion practice to delay the
preliminary injunction hearing, knowing that its claims cannot be substantiated. See Sea Tow
Intern., Inc. v. Pontin, 246 F.R.D. 421, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2007).
B.

The Definitions and Preamble of the Subpoenas Are Overbroad.
The subpoenas issued to the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea are overbroad.

For example, the meaning Plaintiff gives to the term “Social Events” in the Definitions section of
the subpoenas to 570 Park, 580 Park and Susan Relyea--“any catered or other social event”-- is
overbroad. The meaning Plaintiff gives to the term “Social Events” in the Definitions section of
the subpoenas to the Beekman--“any catered or other social event conducted at the Premises,
whether for residents of the Premises or for the general public”-- is likewise overbroad. This
was also pointed out in the Metropolitan Club’s Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of

Motion to Quash.9 In all subpoenas, Plaintiff defines the term by repetition of the same term – a
‘social event’ is a ‘social event.’ The Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea disputed that the term
“social events” was relevant to the Plaintiff’s claim by objection letters dated April 10, 2008,
insofar as it can be construed to mean any event in the private residences within the building,
such as small dinner parties and small social gatherings—events that are not commercial and no
way comparable or relevant to the commercial catering events held at 583 Park. See Pa Decl.
Exs. J-M.
Plaintiff now agrees with the Coalition that the term “Social Events” is overly
broad - but with respect to its subpoena to the Beekman only. See Plaintiff’s Memorandum of
Law, p. 14. Plaintiff’s failure, however, to give a clear definition of “social events” in the
subpoenas is indicative of its failure to propound clear document demands. This failure has
resulted in lengthy discovery disputes and motion practice, to Plaintiff’s advantage, as discussed
above.
Additionally, the meaning Plaintiff gives to the term “You” or “your” in the
Definitions section of the subpoena to Ms. Relyea is overbroad. The subpoena was issued to and
served upon Ms. Relyea in her capacity as member of the Co-Op Board of 580 Park Avenue, but
requires her to answer the subpoena in her individual capacity as well. Ms. Relyea believes
Plaintiff’s service of the Subpoena upon her is nothing more than an attempt to interfere with and
impede Ms. Relyea in her exercise of her First Amendment right to petition the government for

On page 6 of said Reply Memorandum, the Metropolitan Club states: “If a member sponsors an event or a dinner
for a family member, is that an event that the Church considers relevant? What if a member sponsors dinner for his
or her best friend? Is that something the Church deems relevant? There could be thousands of these events over the
requested period of time and not only does the Church want to learn the number of these events, but it also wants
documents demonstrating who attended the events, the revenues generated by the events, and any communications
with anyone about the events. This information is clearly burdensome, especially when the information is not
relevant to the Church’s underlying claims.”

redress. The subpoena should at least be narrowed to remove the requirement that Ms. Relyea
answer the subpoena or produce documents in her individual capacity, since her activities were
as board member only. Notably, if Ms. Relyea has to answer individually, given the definition of
“Social Events” – she would in effect have to produce her entire social calendar for the last six
years – which is intrusive, violates her privacy and is blatantly irrelevant.
Further, the “Document Requests” section of the subpoenas is overbroad because
it begins with the preamble, “All documents concerning or in any way related to.”

This

preamble to each and every document request makes the requests non-particular and overbroad.
For example, “all documents concerning or in any way related to (1) The Church” and “all
documents concerning or in any way related to (2) The Building” could encompass irrelevant
documents (i.e. letters written to Plaintiff stating that its light is shining in neighbor’s window,
roofing is loose, or other matters of a neighborly nature) as well as attorney-client privileged
information and/or attorney work product.
C.

Plaintiff’s Demand For Publicly Available Documents Is An Undue
Burden On The Coalition Members And Susan Relyea
The value of the information to the Plaintiff is outweighed by the burden upon the

Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea and the availability of the information from alternative
sources. Plaintiff has already obtained, through Freedom of Information Law (“FOIL”) requests
and through the Defendants’ submissions in this case, certain documents demanded from the
Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea. Also, Plaintiff’s requests are unduly burdensome to the
extent that some of the documents demanded by Plaintiff from the Coalition Members and Ms.
Relyea are publicly available (e.g. certificates of occupancy, letters

or applications to

governmental agencies). See Pa Decl., Ex. Q. These public documents are obtainable from

Defendant City of New York and/or other governmental agencies and should be sought from
those sources.10 As stated in the case cited by Plaintiff, Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co., 228 F.R.D. 111, 114 (D. Conn. 2005), where “the information appears to be
publicly available from a source that is more convenient, less burdensome or less expensive,” it
is an undue burden on the non-party to have to produce it. In fact, Plaintiff has already obtained,
through FOIL requests11 and through the Defendants’ submissions in this case, documents
demanded from the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea.
D.

Plaintiff’s Request For Confidential Information Is
Burdensome And Should Be Subject To A Protective Order

Unduly

The subpoenas require the production of certain documents such as board of
directors minutes, tax returns, non-public information such as passwords included in
communications with or about State and City Lobbying Commissions. It is hard to fathom how
these documents are remotely relevant. In any event, these documents are confidential and
should not be produced, if at all, without protective measures in place. Indeed, confidential
information that does not qualify as a constitutionally protected privacy interest may nevertheless
be entitled to protection against unwarranted public disclosure resulting from discovery in
federal civil litigation. See Long v. American Red Cross, 145 F.R.D. 658, 664 (S.D. Ohio 1993)
(protected privacy interest in blood donor’s medical condition); Borzillieri v. American National
Red Cross, 139 F.R.D. 289 (W.D.N.Y. 1991) (protected privacy interest in AIDS risk status).

Plaintiff has conceded this point already, in its April 17, 2008 letter, annexed to the Pa Decl., Ex. R, by
suggesting a “rolling response” to the subpoenas, so as to exclude duplication of materials produced by the City.

Through FOIL requests, the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea have obtained copies of letters from Plaintiff
responding to letters written by KK&F on behalf of the Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea to governmental
officials.

Plaintiff’s Subpoena To The Beekman Is Unduly Burdensome And
Should Be Modified, If Not Quashed.
As explained above in Point I, the Beekman is admittedly different from the other

Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea. It is not a strictly residential building, but an apartment
hotel that houses the Park Avenue Café (Archive Room), a small restaurant with a maximum
seating capacity of 75 guests, the Park Avenue Café (Townhouse), a small private dining room
with a maximum seated capacity of 50 guests, and the Park Avenue Café (Kitchen Table),
literally one table for up to 10 guests, all operated by the same tenant under one lease. See
Weisberg Decl. ¶29. The Townhouse is not, as Plaintiff declares, a “catering event space” or
“separate banquet facility” that “openly engages in robust commercial catering activity.”
Plaintiff’s baseless mischaracterization of the Park Avenue Café is a desperate way to argue that
Plaintiff’s Tenant-Caterer is similarly situated.12
Neither the Archive Room, Townhouse nor Kitchen Table taken together, or
separately, could be seriously considered similarly situated to 583 Park. There is no comparison
between the Park Avenue Café, with a total seating capacity of 135 guests spread in three
different rooms, and 583 Park, which holds 1000+ persons—a truly “robust” operation—and is
available on a near daily basis. The Tenant-Caterer has already conceded this lack of
comparison, stating in its September 29, 2006 Confidential Private Placement Memorandum,
submitted to the New York State Attorney General, that the venues comparable to it are those
________________________

Similarly desperate is Plaintiff’s baseless reliance on a Second Amendment to Lease to support its argument that it
will suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction is not granted. Since that amendment never disclosed to or
approved by the New York Supreme Court, it cannot be the basis for relief. See New York Religious Corporation
Law §12; also see Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America v. Abrams, 162 Misc. 2d 850, 618
N.Y.S.2d 504 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. 1994); St. Andrey Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Cathedral Church, Inc. v. Bosakov,
272 A.D.2d 55, 707 N.Y.S.2d 95 (1st Dep’t 2000) (trial court properly found that alleged transfer of property from
diocese to church had been invalid because of failure to comply with New York Religious Corporations Law §12).

with seated dinner capacities of 400 to 2800 guests.

Filed 05/05/2008

Page 19 of 26

See Weisberg Decl. Ex. K. Further, as

indicated above, the Beekman, an apartment hotel, is permitted to have a restaurant, such as Park
Avenue Café, in its premises pursuant to the City’s Zoning Resolution §12-10. See Weisberg
Decl. Ex. O. Since the Beekman’s tenant is not similarly situated to the Tenant-Caterer, the
subpoena to the Beekman should be quashed. In the event that the Court disagrees as to the
similarity between the Beekman and the Tenant-Caterer at the Church, the subpoena should at
least be modified because it is vague, overbroad and unduly burdensome.
Contrary to Plaintiff’s statement, the Beekman has not refused to produce any
documents in response to the subpoena and has offered what it believes is relevant. In response
to the subpoena, the Beekman has stated that Plaintiff’s April 14, 2008 letter, read without
reference to the subpoena, suggests that Plaintiff merely seeks the lease agreements, to which the
Beekman has not specifically objected. See Pa Decl., Ex. P-Q. To the contrary, the subpoena
seeks “any and all documents concerning or in any way related to” the lease, which could
include, for example, numerous drafts, internal memos, etc. See Pa Decl., Ex. D. These are
unnecessary given the purpose stated on page six of Plaintiff’s aforesaid letter (to show that
several of the terms in the Church’s lease agreement are reasonable and common in the industry),
the Beekman’s objections are meritorious.
Further, the Beekman has told Plaintiff that the documents sought by the
subpoena, i.e. (1) documents relating to “Social Events,” (2) the lease and any amendments,
renewals or other agreements, (3) documents showing number of hours it takes for each “Social
Event,” (4) documents showing the number of guests that visit the Park Avenue Café are
presumably within the control and possession of the Beekman’s tenant, not Beekman. See Pa
Decl., Ex. L. The Beekman has no control over its tenant’s operations. See Weisberg Decl. ¶31.

194531.1

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB

Page 20 of 26

Plaintiff issued a separate subpoena to the Beekman’s tenant, who, upon information and belief,
has already responded, and, therefore, the documents are already available to Plaintiff. See
Weisberg Decl. ¶31.
Also, such documents as (5) the certificate of occupancy, (10) applications for
permits and applications, and (6), (11), (14), (15) & (16) communications with the City and
Elected Officials are publicly available, and as such, accessible to Plaintiff. See Pa Decl., Ex. Q.
They are also available through the Defendants. See Travelers, supra (where “the information
appears to be publicly available from a source that is more convenient, less burdensome or less
expensive,” it is an undue burden on the non-party to have to produce it). No legitimate purpose
can be served by seeking this information from Beekman – other than some ulterior motive – as
to stifle opposition or delay the proceedings.
The Beekman has also told Plaintiff that, (7) and (8) tax returns are confidential
(as stated above) and, as to attorney-client and work product privileged documents demanded, it
would produce a privilege log (work product objections are addressed in the next point). Finally,
as Plaintiff acknowledges, the definition of “Social Events” is vague and overbroad.
In light of these objections, the Plaintiff’s subpoena to the Beekman is unduly
burdensome and should be quashed, or, at least, modified. KK&F has already set forth a
proposal for resolving this discovery dispute in its April 25, 2008 letter to Plaintiff’s counsel
(rejected by Plaintiff in its April 28, 2008 letter). See Weisberg Decl. Exs. U and V. This
proposal stated as follows:
1. To the extent not produced by the City of New York in its
document production, we shall produce communications with
respect to 583 Park Avenue or the use thereof, between our firm on
behalf of the Coalition or any member thereof, and New York
City elected officials, the Department of Buildings, the Landmarks
Preservation Commission, the Parks Department, Community

Board 8, the Mayor’s Office or other city agencies, if any,
excluding however communications between our firm and the New
York City Law Department;
2. We shall produce communications with respect to 583 Park
Avenue or the use thereof, between our firm on behalf of the
Coalition or any member thereof, and New York State elected
officials and state agencies including the State Liquor Authority
and the Charities Bureau of the Attorney General’s Office;
3. As applies to the Beekman, we shall produce copies of the
Certificate of Occupancy, filings with the Department of Buildings
with respect to the first floor and /or Restaurant space, and subject
to an appropriate confidentially agreement, the Lease with the
restaurant operator and the Sale and Leaseback documents with the
restaurant operator;
4. Provided your client agrees to pay for duplication costs, we
shall produce copies of photographs and videotapes. Please note
that since our correspondence of April 10, 2008, we have obtained
7 additional DVD videos.
5. The production outlined above shall be deemed full compliance
with the 4 subpoenas identified in our letters of April 10, 2008.
6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this voluntary compliance
would be subject to all of the objections previously stated and
would not constitute a waiver of any of said objections, including
without limitation that the subpoenas themselves exceed the scope
of the Court’s order.
***
Given the over-breadth and burdensomeness of the subpoenas, they should be
quashed and/or modified.
III.

THE COALITION MEMBERS’ ASSERTION OF WORKPRODUCT PRIVILEGE IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER FEDERAL
CASE LAW
In objecting to the subpoenas, the Coalition Members asserted the attorney-client

and work product privileges. See Pa Decl., Exhibits J through O. While the general rule is that
the work product protection of FRCP 26(b)(3) (“Trial Preparation: Materials”) does not extend to

17
194531.1

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB

Document 43

Filed 05/05/2008

Page 22 of 26

“documents prepared by and in the hands of a third person,” the courts make an exception for
non-parties who are “interested in the action,” and courts have construed broadly the definition
of who is “interested.” See Polycast Tech. v. Uniroyal, No. 87 Civ. 3297, *2, 1990 WL 138968
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 1990). In Polycast, whether a non-party was “legally aligned” with a party
and “consistently maintained” that it had an interest in the outcome of the litigation were factors
in determining whether it was “interested.” See Id.
In this case, the Coalition Members are “interested” because they are “legally
aligned” with Defendants since they share the same interest in upholding the City’s
determination, as demonstrated by the fact that they would have had standing to sue if the City
had rendered a decision favorable to the Plaintiff. See e.g. Center Square Ass’n, Inc. v. City of
Albany Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 9 A.D.2d 651, 780 N.Y.S.2d 203 (3d Dep’t 2004); also see Pa
Decl., Ex. Q. Additionally, the Coalition Members have “consistently maintained” that they
have an interest in the outcome of this litigation. See Pa Decl., Ex. Q. Plaintiff even concedes
the Neighbor’s steady involvement stating, “the Neighbors are central to this case…The Church
has always maintained that the scope, nature, and intensity of their lobbying efforts, and the
impact of those efforts on the City, are at the very heart of this case.” See Memorandum of Law,
p. 6. Accordingly, contrary to Plaintiff’s assertions, the documents prepared by KK&F in the
course of representation of the Coalition Members, “interested parties,” are protected by the
work product doctrine.
Plaintiff relies too much on Ramsey v. NYP Holdings, Inc., No. 00 Civ. 3478,
2002 WL 1402055 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 2002) for the proposition that the Coalition’s interests are
not aligned with the City. Clearly, Plaintiff is trying to have it both ways so that it can get
“relevant” discovery from the Coalition—claiming it is an interested party central to this case--

194531.1

and work product from the Coalition—claiming it is a non-interested party that is not so central
to this case. Further, Plaintiff’s suggestion that the Coalition Members need to have a “direct
financial stake” to be interested is unsupported by any citation. Contrary to Plaintiff’s baseless
statement, case law does not make “direct financial stake” a factor in determining “interested
party” status.
It should be understood, however, that the Coalition Members are not asserting
work product with respect to any actual communication (but rather only drafts13 or related
documents) with the SLA, elected officials, the LPC or the DOB. See Pa Decl., Ex. Q.
IV.

EVEN IF THE COURT AGREES THAT THE COALITION
MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO DISCOVERY AT THIS TIME,
THE COALITION MEMBERS ARE ENTITLED TO FULL OR
PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT OF THEIR COSTS AND/OR
ADDITIONAL TIME TO COMPILE THE RESPONSIVE
DOCUMENTS AND THINGS
The Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea have set forth an objection that they

should not be required to review the voluminous documents, let alone produce them, without
adequate and fair compensation, and, of course, subject to other objections. See Pa Decl., Ex. Q.
The express language of FRCP Rule 45(c)(2)(B) provides that a non-party must be protected
from “significant expense resulting from compliance.”

Under this section, a demanding party

can be ordered to reimburse a nonparty for a portion of the reasonable costs of compliance,
including the costs of producing, inspecting, and photocopying the requested documents. See In
re First American Corp., 184 F.R.D. 234, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) citing In re Exxon Valdez, 142
F.R.D. 380, 383-85 (D.D.C. 1992). A non-party's legal fees, especially where the work benefits

The Coalition Members and Ms. Relyea also assert attorney-client privilege with regard to drafts exchanged with
clients.

the requesting party, have been considered a cost of compliance reimbursable under FRCP Rule
45(c)(2)(B). See First American Corp., supra.
Although the Coalition Members have an interest in the outcome of this litigation,
that does not preclude them from recovering costs from Plaintiff. See In re First American Corp.
at 242 (non-party required to absorb only a portion of the costs for which it seeks
reimbursement). Plaintiff’s suggestion in its April 14, 2008 letter that it cannot reimburse
KK&F’s clients because it faces “grave financial challenges” seems disingenuous and without
basis, in light of Plaintiff’s failure to demonstrate its inability to bear costs of the “limited
discovery” demanded by it, while, at the same time, retaining three (3) large law firms in
connection with various stages of this matter—Greenberg Traurig, LLP, Satterlee Stephens
Burke & Burke, LLP and Davis Wright Tremaine LLP-- and collecting rent and presumably
profits from its seemingly successful Tenant-Caterer. See Pa Decl., Exs. P-Q. Further, KK&F’s
clients reject Plaintiff’s suggestion that KK&F’s clients are among the wealthiest cooperative
building associations in New York City as meaningless and baseless. See Pa Decl., Ex. Q.
Plaintiff provides and has no basis to know the financial status of these buildings – or for that
matter any of the tenant shareholders, many of whom have lived in their apartments for many
years and may have purchased their apartments at a time when the co-op market was far different
than today. And one need only look at the multi-million dollar façade work occurring on some
of the Coalition’s buildings to comply with NYC Local Law 11 to understand the extent of the
extraordinary expenses these buildings face.
Finally, given the scope of Plaintiff’s requests and the breadth of the documents in
the Coalition Members’ control, the Coalition Members require additional time to respond to the
subpoenas and compile a complete privilege log. See Pa Decl., Ex. J-M. As already indicated to

20

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB

Page 25 of 26

Plaintiff on April 10, 2008, sorting out protected documents and compiling a detailing log would
result in significant professional, paralegal and clerical time and expense as there are over 8,600
e-mails, some of which include attachments, 42 Redwelds, well over 500 photographs, 31 DVD
videos and a substantial number of additional documents. See Weisberg Decl. ¶36. Apparently
realizing the extent of the documents requested, Plaintiff proposed on April 17, 2008 that the
Coalition Members make a rolling production. See Pa Decl., Ex. R. But before the Coalition
Members could properly respond to this proposition (as well as the rest of Plaintiff’s April 17,
2008 letter) and after KK&F on April 17, 2008 requested until April 22, 2008 to respond due to
KK&F’s need to consult with the Beekman’s general counsel, who were on Passover holiday
(see Weisberg Decl. ¶37), Plaintiff—which brought this federal action based upon its religious
status—ironically ignored the request (see id.) and filed the instant motion, unfairly claiming the
Coalition Members were “stonewalling.” See Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Law, p. 10.

CONCLUSION
In light of the fact that the subpoenas are not authorized by the Court’s discovery
order, and, even if they are construed to be authorized, unduly burdensome, overly broad, and
irrelevant, Plaintiff’s motion to compel should be denied and the subpoenas duces tecum to 570
Park, 580 Park, the Beekman and Ms. Relyea should be quashed and/or modified and the
subpoena ad testificandum to Ms. Relyea should be quashed.
