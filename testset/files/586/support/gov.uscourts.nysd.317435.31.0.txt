Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB Document31 Filed 04/21/2008 Page 4 of 22

Plaintiff Third Church of Christ, Scientist, of New York City (the "Church"), submits this
memorandum in support of its motion to compel non-parties 570 Park Avenue Apartments, Inc.,
580 Park Avenue, Inc., Susan Relyea, as a Member of the Co-Op Board of 580 Park Avenue,
Inc., and The Beekman Tenants Corporation (the "Beekman" (collectively, the "Neighbors"), to
comply with subpoenas served on them. This memorandum addresses all four subpoenas.

INTRODUCTION

The Neighbors caused this lawsuit. Until these influential Park Avenue residents
mounted their NIMBY campaign, the City had approved the Church's plan to raise revenues to
maintain their building by having catered events there. Though their neighborhood is full of
venues that conduct restaurant and catering activities - indeed, even the Beekman houses and
profits from a thriving restaurant and separate banquet hall - the Neighbors organized a
sweeping and, ultimately, effective lobbying campaign. The subpoenas seek simply to discover
the ways in which this campaign influenced the City to reverse course and make the unlawful
land use decision that the Church challenges here.

The Neighbors have done far more than merely write a few letters to state their views.
They have conducted extensive surveillance of the Church, lobbied not just the City, but other
elected officials, the State Liquor Authority and other agencies, reached out to other co-ops in
the neighborhood, retained lawyers, and apparently even hired Howard Rubenstein to help them
refine their spin on what the Church is "really" doing. The Complaint alleges that these
extensive lobbying efforts played a key role in this case.

The Neighbors do not want their conduct discovered. They have raised numerous
objections to the subpoenas and spurned the Church's several offers to compromise regarding
their scope. Each objection is baseless. This memorandum establishes that:

* this Court's discovery order authorized issuance of the Subpoenas (see Point I, infra);

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB Document31 Filed 04/21/2008 Page 5 of 22

* the Neighbors' assertion of work-product privilege to protect the substantial bulk of
their production is contrary to established federal law because they are non-parties to this
action (see Point II, infra);

* the boilerplate assertions of over-breadth and burden fatally lack the requisite
supporting details (see Point III, infra),

* the Neighbors' demand that the Church pay the costs associated with compliance
reflects hardball tactics only, and fee-shifting here is irreconcilable with the equities (see
Point IV, infra); and,

* the Beekman's relevance and other objections - directed at the separate subpoena that
seeks information concerning commercial restaurant and banquet activity there - are also
without merit (see Point V, infra).

BACKGROUND
A. The Neighbors Have Aggressively Lobbied the City

The City previously authorized the Church to host social events at its building to earn
supplemental income, a decision consistent with its established practice of permitting non-profit
groups and religious institutions to use their facilities for catered events for people or companies
not otherwise affiliated with the non-profit or religious institution. In reliance on the City's
decision, the Church and its caterer undertook a multi-million dollar renovation of the Church's
building. See Compl. 0x00A7 44. !

After the repairs were well underway, and its caterer had hosted several events (without
incident) and booked numerous events going forward, the City revoked its prior approval. Id.

55. The City now claims it did so only because the prior approval was a "mistake." See Hrg. Tr.

 

1 This Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Club's Motion to Quash and in Support
of Plaintiff's Motion to Compel refers to various papers submitted on its motion for a
preliminary injunction. Specifically, references are made to the Complaint, filed Dec. 3, 2007;
the Declaration of Jay A. Segal, dated Dec. 3, 2007 ("Segal Decl."); the Reply Declaration of Jay
A. Segal, dated Feb. 22, 2008 ("Segal Reply Decl."); the Declaration in Opposition to Plaintiff's
Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, dated Feb. 8, 2008 ("Brennan Decl.").

All defined terms set forth in the Subpoena and the Complaint are incorporated herein.

12/3/07 at 24:3-7, Compl. 52. But the Complaint alleges that the City reversed course only
because of political pressure. See Compl. 7 4.

The City changed its position and revoked approval only after a group of influential
denizens of Park Avenue - all of whom live within a few blocks of the Regency Hotel, the Park
Avenue Cafe, the Park Avenue Armory, the Council on Foreign Relations, and many other
institutions that regularly host large social events - complained that catered events in the
Church's building had transformed the Church into a commercial catering hall that causes
serious disruption in the neighborhood. Id. 0x00A7 4. These residents of 570, 575 and 580 Park
Avenue, branding themselves the "The Preservation Coalition," initiated a public relations
campaign against the Church, with the avowed purpose of maintaining the purported
"residential" character of their Park Avenue neighborhood. Jd. 447. They circulated flyers
claiming that the Church's hosting of catered events at its historic premises - although not
materially different than the practices of neighboring institutions - would cause significant
disruption in their backyard. Jd.,; Pa. Decl. Ex. F. They then pressed these pretextual complaints
on the City, sending at least three letters to the Department of Buildings ("DOB"), dated
March 12, 2007, March 30, 2007, and October 5, 2007. See Pa Decl. { 8, Ex. G.

On November 30, 2007, the City succumbed to the demands of these influential
neighbors, and the DOB sent a letter reversing itself and notifying the Church and its caterer that
it revoked its prior approval for the repairs and the catering at the Church's premises. See
Compl. 51; Pa Decl. Ex. H. The DOB stated that it re-evaluated its position in light of vocal
opposition by the Church's neighbors, and had now concluded that the catering events would not

be an "accessory use" to the Church's primary use as a house of worship. Jd. 952. As a result of

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB Document31 Filed 04/21/2008 Page 7 of 22

the City's illegal conduct, directly encouraged and instigated by the Neighbors, the Church has
been forced to initiate the instant lawsuit. Id. J 53.

The Neighbors have not stopped at pressing their pretextual complaints on the City and
on various local and state elected officials. The Church has since learned that the Neighbors'
lobbying efforts continue to be far-reaching, from petitioning local Elected Officials, mobilizing
neighborhood organizations, lobbying the State Liquor Authority, and even going so far as to
install video equipment so they can spy on the Church. See Pa Decl. J 10, 14, Ex. O, Weisberg
Decl. { 4-5.

B. The Neighbors Refuse to Comply with the Subpoena.

On March 3, 2008, the Court granted the Church's request and issued an Order permitting
the parties to conduct pre-hearing discovery. See Pa Decl. 0x00A7 2, Ex. A. Soon thereafter, the
Church served subpoenas on various non-parties, including the Neighbors, seeking narrow
categories of documents and deposition testimony from Susan Relyea, in her capacity as a
member of the 580 Park Avenue Building Cooperative Association. Jd. Exs. B-E. When
initially contacted by the Neighbors' counsel, the Church was flexible and offered to extend their
time to respond from March 26" to April 10". See id. 4] 12, Ex. I. On April 10, 2008, however,
the Neighbors served blanket objections to all of the requests in the Subpoenas, and claimed -
for the first time - that they were not required to respond at all to the subpoena because the
Court's order permitting pre-hearing discovery did not permit the Church to seek discovery from
them. Jd. J 13, Exs. J-M. The Neighbors also served a Categorical Privileged Documents Log
that refused to produce broad categories of documents and communications with various third-
parties, such as the City, Elected Officials, the Landmark Preservation Commission, the State
Liquor Authority, and other third-party entities and individuals, on the grounds of attorney client

and work product privileges. Jd. 14, Ex. 14. They also served the Declaration of Phyllis H.

Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB Document31 Filed 04/21/2008 Page 8 of 22

Weisberg, dated 10, 2008, ostensibly to set forth their justification for their privilege assertions.
Id. Ex. O.

On April 14, 2008, counsel for the Church replied with a letter disputing the Neighbors'
arguments and explaining why evidence from them was highly relevant and discoverable. Jd.

{] 15, Ex. P. The Church explained that the subpoenas were appropriate under the discovery
Order given how central a role the Neighbors played in this dispute, and that their vague
assertions of privilege were unsupportable. Yet, in an attempt to accommodate the Neighbors'
complaints of burden and over-breadth, the Church agreed to limit the temporal scope of the
Subpoenas by several years, and welcomed other suggestions for compromise.

On April 16, 2008, counsel for the Neighbors responded by letter. Jd. 0x00A7 16, Ex. Q.
Though never objecting that the documents the Neighbors possess are irrelevant, counsel
continued in his insistence that the Subpoenas were overbroad and outside the scope of the
Court's discovery order. He also demanded "fair compensation" for incurred expenses. Not
only did the Neighbors spurn the Church's attempts at compromise, they used the Church's
willingness to reduce the temporal scope of the Subpoena as a purported concession that they
were overly broad.

On April 17, 2008, the Church wrote back in another attempt to resolve this impasse. Jd.
4,17, Ex. R. It offered further to further limit various categories of documents sought by the
Subpoena. That afternoon, the Neighbors wrote back seeking additional time to respond. Jd. |
18, Ex.S. The Church, however, explained that, given the June 3, 2008 discovery cut-off date,
and the Neighbors' consistent refusal to acknowledge that they were going to produce responsive

documents, the Church would be required to file this motion in order to protect its rights.

ARGUMENT

Rule 45 governs the issuance of and compliance with subpoenas and the sanctions for
non-compliance. Discovery under Rule 45 "is intended to be as broad against a nonparty as
against a party[.]" See Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 45, Commentary 45-6; 9 MOORE'S FEDERAL
PRACTICE 3D 0x00A7 45.03[1], 45-24 (2007). The party resisting discovery bears the burden of
showing that the subpoena is improper and/or that compliance with the "subpoena would be
unduly burdensome." MacNamara v. City of New York, No. 04 Civ. 9612 (KMK) (JCF), 2006
WL 3298911, 15 (S.D.N-Y. Nov. 13, 2006).

Subpoenas are not voluntary requests. Each is issued in the name of the Court and non-
compliance can constitute contempt. See 9 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE 3D 0x00A7 45.02[1]; Fed. R.
Civ. P 45(e) ("Failure of any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon
that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued.").

I. The Order Authorizes Service of Subpoenas on the Neighbors

The Neighbors claim that they need not comply with the Subpoenas because the pre-
hearing discovery Order does not encompass discovery from them. See Pa Decl. Ex. A. This
narrow reading flouts the intention of the Order to permit the parties to develop a fuller factual
record on which the Court could base its ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction. There
is no question that the Neighbors are central to this case. The Church has always maintained that
the scope, nature, and intensity of their lobbying efforts, and the impact of those efforts on the
City, are at the very heart of this case. See, e.g., Compl. 9 47-51, Pl. Br. 2. The Court has read
extensive briefing, and heard oral argument on the application for the TRO in December (with
the Neighbors' counsel present in the courtroom, whom the Court invited to participate), and
therefore was well aware of the central role that the Neighbors' played when it granted the

Church's request to conduct discovery. See Hrg. Tr. 12/3/07, 2:11-13.

NYC 196167v1 0085520-000001 6
Case 1:07-cv-10962-DAB Document31 Filed 04/21/2008 Page 10 of 22

The Neighbors, however, selectively quote from the Court's order, claiming that it
permits limited discovery only to religious and non-profit secular institutions that may conduct
catered events. See Pa Decl., { 13, Ex. J at 1. The Order is not no so narrow. Instead, it granted
"pre-hearing discovery including Plaintiffs requests for documents and depositions from several
religious and non-religious institutions that may conduct similar catered events to those issues in
this matter" (emphasis added). The Order grants the right to take party and non-party discovery;
it uses the word "including" only in its normal, illustrative sense.

II. The Neighbors, Non-Parties to this Action, Cannot Assert a Work Product
Privilege

The Neighbors assert boilerplate attorney-client and work-product privilege objections to
every Request in the Subpoenas, and they submit a "Categorical Privileged Documents Log" that
sets forth categories of documents purportedly covered by these privileges. See Pa Decl. Ex. N. NN
The privilege log is telling. The Neighbors seek to withhold al] documents concerning
communications between and among the Neighbors and third parties, including the City,
CIVITAS and Defenders of the Historic Upper East Side (neighborhood groups that
unsuccessfully sought to submit an amicus brief in this action), the State Liquor Authority,
Elected Officials, Landmark Preservation Commission, the Church's neighbors and potential
Coalition members, and other consultants, videographers, and agents assisting the Neighbors.

The Neighbors maintain that all internal communications and documents between and
among themselves are protected by work product privilege. See Pa Decl. { 14, Exs. N, Q. This
is not the law. Instead, the express language of Rule 26(b)(3) and federal case law provides that,
because the Neighbors are not parties to this action, they cannot assert a work product privilege
at all. See Ricoh Co., Ltd. v. Aeroflex Inc., 219 F.R.D. 66, 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (holding that

"Courts have routinely held that documents prepared by one who is not a party to the case at bar
