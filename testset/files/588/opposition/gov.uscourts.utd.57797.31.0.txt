ARGUMENT

Plaintiff Lester Ruston filed his complaint in this matter on June 30, 2006.
Notwithstanding Ruston's failure to serve the complaint on the Church Defendants, on
November 15, 2006, the Church Defendants filed a motion to dismiss showing that Ruston's
claims are barred by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1915. Since that time
Ruston has filed a flurry of frivolous motions, most of which are pending before the Court.
Ruston's latest motion seeks to add the State of Texas as a defendant and requests that the court
grant a motion for temporary restraining order. The Church Defendants have never received a
motion for a temporary restraining order. The pending motion to dismiss is dispositive of all the
issues in this case. Accordingly, the Church Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant

its motion to dismiss Ruston's complaint.
