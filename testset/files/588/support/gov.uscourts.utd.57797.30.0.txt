PLAINTIFF'S OMNIBUS MOTION FOR JOINDER OF ADDITIONAL PARTIES
SUPPLEMENTATION TO REQUEST FOR A TRO
Comes now, Plaintiff, Lester Jon Ruston, and files this, his
Omnibus Motion for Joinder of Additional Parties for Just Adjudication,
pursuant to Rule 19(a) of the Fed.R.Civ.P. and his Supplementation to
Request for a Temporary Restraining Order, and would show this Honorable
Court as follows:
I.
Defendants have, and continue to, conspire with the State of Texas
to violate Plaintiff's rights under the U.S. Constitution, which is
"public record" in Ruston v. State of Texas, D-1-GN-07-001059 in
District Court 20lst, Travis County, Texas and Ruston v. Collin County,
Texas et al., 07-02829 in District Court 101st, Dallas County, Texas.
Pursuant to Rule 19(a), Plaintiff's moves the Court to add the State
of Texas as Defendants in this matter, for just injunctive relief,
and to obtain "discovery" of all suppressed and concealed "evidence",
pursuant to Rules 26-34 of the Fed.R.Civ.P. Proposed Defendants State
of Texas can be served with process by the U.S. Marshal's Service at
300 W. 15th Street, Austin, Texas 78701, Attn. Greg Abbott, Attorney
General of Texas, pursuant to Rule 4 Fed.R.Civ.P., which Plaintiff
moves the Court to do with this filing.
SUPPLEMENTATION TO REQUEST FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
This matter has been filed under 18 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1964, the R.I.C.0.
Racketeering Act. On the 18th day of June, 2007, Plaintiff made a
filing against the Defendants. On the 27th day of June, 2007, upon
information and belief, the Defendants did engage in another act of
"witness tampering" with the Bureau of Prisons, who did then commit
fraud, torture, abuse of process, and facially violated 28 CFR 541.22

by placing Plaintiff in Administrative Segregation, to impede his
access to various Courts, despite the holdings of the Courts in Allah
v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220 (3rd Cir. 2000) and Hewitt v. Helms, 459
U.S. 460 (1983). The Bureau of Prisons also gave Defendant Victor James
Ruston the Plaintiff's address, to allow him to attempt "witness
tampering" via the U.S. Mail. Further, the Defendants did openly con-
spire with B.O.P. staff to violate the Courts holding in Bounds v.
Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), by impeding Plaintiff's ability to act as
a "jail house lawyer", when Plaintiff is not a convicted criminal and
should not even be held in a prison, as clearly stated in Ruston v.
Gonzalez, 4:07-CV-40135 NG D. Mass. Federal Court.

The Defendants, upon information and belief, are also retaliating
for Plaintiff's status a a freelance journalist and writer by attempting:
to censor his outgoing mail with the B.0.P., despite the Courts holding
in Bressman v. Farrier, 825 F.Supp. 231 (N.D. Iowa 1993) and Abu-Jamal
v. Price, 154 F.3d 128 (3rd Cir. 1998). Multiple media outlets have
expressed interest in this matter, in particular CBS News and Time
Magazine. B.O.P. has retaliated for Plaintiff's communications to both
by falsifying documents to attempt to "punish" Plaintiff, despite his
clear rights pursuant to the lst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,
which the Defendants do not acknowledge, which is the reason for this
complaint.

Wherefore, premises considered, Plaintiff, Lester Jon Ruston, does
file this, his Omnibus Motion for Joinder of Additional Parties for
Just Adjudication, and Supplementation to Request for a Temporary
Restraining Order, pursuant to Rules 19(a) and 65(a), respectively,
and would move this Honorable Court to Grant this motion, and to take
judicial notice of supplement, pursuant to Rule 201 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence, and issue a TRO, as already requested in this case.
