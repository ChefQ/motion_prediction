Defendants Richard 0x00A7S. Guralnick ("Guralnick") and Schain Leifer Guralnick
("SLG"\(collectively, the "SLG Defendants") submit this memorandum of law in support of
their motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint ("Amended Complaint")! of plaintiffs Ira
Nathel and Sheldon Nathel ("Plaintiffs") as against them for failure to state a claim pursuant to
Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and alternatively for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Plaintiffs' action, insofar as asserted against the SLG Defendants, is premised on the
theory that they were misled into purchasing interests in partnerships engaged in oil and gas
exploration by misstatements concerning, among other things, the tax deductibility of certain
"intangible drilling costs" associated with the exploration activities. However, Plaintiffs do not
identify a single representation of any kind that is attributable to the SLG Defendants and that
was made to them prior to their purchase of interests in the partnerships. Indeed, the only
statements and conduct by the SLG Defendants alleged in the Amended Complaint are tax return
preparation services for the partnerships and responses to IRS inquiries-both of which
necessarily occurred after Plaintiffs acquired their partnership interests. Plaintiffs allege no facts
from which it could be inferred that the SIG Defendants made any representations, failed to
disclose any information or engaged in any conduct that induced them to purchase the
partnership interests. Notably, Plaintiffs do not allege any adverse determination by the IRS
regarding the partnerships-because there has been none.

Plaintiffs' claim against the SLG Defendants under Section 10(b) of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder is flawed for a number of reasons. Plaintiffs

 

' A copy of the First Amended Complaint is attached to the Notice of Motion as Exhibit 1.
Case 1:07-cv-10956-LBS Document31 Filed 01/25/2008 Page 6 of 26

fail to identify any material misstatement or omission by the SLG Defendants by which they
were-or could have been-induced to acquire their partnership interests. Plaintiffs also fail to
identify any allegedly fraudulent conduct by the SLG Defendants "in connection with" the
purchase or sale of a security (assuming that the general partnership interests are a "security" at
all). Since Plaintiffs fail to allege any misstatements or material omissions by the SLG
Defendants by which they could have been induced to purchase their partnership interests, they
cannot possibly establish the requisite elements of reliance and causation. Plaintiffs allege no
facts on which the "strong inference" of scienter required to maintain a securities fraud claim
could be founded. Additionally, Plaintiffs' claim is time-barred because they were on inquiry
notice of the facts underlying the purported fraud claim more than two years before they
commenced this action. Finally, Plaintiffs cannot possibly establish that any misrepresentation
by the SLG Defendants was the proximate cause of their alleged damage or that they have
suffered any actual damage within the meaning of Section 28(a) of the Exchange Act. For all of
these reasons, Plaintiffs' securities fraud claim must be dismissed insofar as it is asserted against
the SLG Defendants, (See Point I, infra} Since the federal securities claim is the only possible
basis for subject matter jurisdiction, dismissal of the securities claim should result in dismissal of
the action in its entirety. (See Point II, infra}

If the action is not dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the Court must still
consider-and should dismiss-Plaintiffs' common law claims against the SLG Defendants.
Plaintiffs' common law fraud claims must be dismissed for the same reasons as their securities
fraud claim since the requisite elements are largely the seame-and are entirely absent here.
Similarly, Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim should be dismissed because they allege

no actionable misrepresentation by the SLG Defendants, fail to allege any facts from which the
Case 1:07-cv-10956-LBS Document31 Filed 01/25/2008 Page 7 of 26

requisite duty of care could be inferred, and cannot allege the requisite reliance. (See Point IITA,
infra) Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim fails because they allege no facts that take this
action out of the general rule that accountants who function as tax preparers - which is the SLG
Defendants' role with regard to the Partnerships-are not fiduciaries of their clients. (See Point
IIIB, infra) Finally, Plaintiffs' professional malpractice claim against the SLG Defendants must
be dismissed because Plaintiffs cannot establish that any acts by the SLG Defendants
proximately caused their damages or that they have suffered any recoverable damages. In
addition, any malpractice claim would be barred, at least in part, by the three-year statute of
limitations for malpractice actions contained in CPLR 214(6). (See Point TIC, infra)
Accordingly, the Amended Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety as against the SLG
Defendants.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on or about December 3, 2007. Plaintiffs then filed
the Amended Complaint on or about December 13, 2007, and served it upon the SLG
Defendants on December 14, 2007.

In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs set forth seven claims for relief. The First Claim
alleges a violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder, by the SLG Defendants and others; the Second Claim alleges fraudulent inducement
against all defendants; the Third Claim alleges "fraudulent non-disclosure" against all
defendants; the Fourth Claim alleges negligent misrepresentation against all defendants; the Fifth
Claim alleges a breach of fiduciary duty against the SLG Defendants and others; the Sixth Claim
alleges breach of contract against several defendants, excluding the SLG Defendants; and the
Seventh Claim alleges professional malpractice against the SLG Defendants and defendant

Robert A. Trevisani.

STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS
A. General Factual Allegations

In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that their accountant, defendant Harvey
Josephson ("Josephson"), suggested Plaintiffs invest in eight general partnerships (the
"Partnerships") in the field of oil and gas exploration organized by defendant Richard Siegal
("Siegal"). Plaintiffs now claim they were misled by both Josephson and Siegal as to the tax
deductible nature of certain intangible drilling costs ("IDC Deductions") associated with the
exploration activities (Amended Complaint, {| 44, 45, 47 through 52, 62 through 65)}-even
though no adverse tax determination has been made against any of the Partnerships. Plaintiffs
also allege that they were misled as to other issues, including predicted annual returns, cash flow,
distributions, payment of exploration-related costs and drilling agreements (Amended
Complaint, f0x00A7 53 through 56). Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants fraudulently
misrepresented the Partnerships' oil and gas exploration activities and expertise (Amended
Complaint, ff] 84, 90, 94, 101), and that they relied generally on "Defendants" in making their
decision to purchase their interests in the Partnerships (Amended Complaint, { 66).7

But while Plaintiffs do attribute certain allegedly misleading statements to defendants
other than SLG and Guralnick, they do not allege a single statement made to them by the SLG
Defendants prior to their purchase of the interests in the Partnerships. The allegations with

regard to specific actions or statements by the SLG Defendants-as opposed to a mere mention

 

* Curiously, Plaintiffs state that their first purchase of an interest in the Partnerships (in High
Island Drilling) was made in August of 2001 (Amended Complaint, 0x00A7j 66), approximately three
months before Josephson is alleged to have proposed-for the first time-that Plaintiffs
participate in the Partnerships (Amended Complaint, {| 47).
Case 1:07-cv-10956-LBS Document31 Filed 01/25/2008 Page 9 of 26

that the SLG Defendants would be preparing tax returns for the Partnerships-all relate to
actions subsequent to Plaintiffs' decision to purchase their interests.

Plaintiffs allege that the IRS began investigating the Partnerships in or about
November of 2006 (Amended Complaint, 7 70).? Plaintiffs further allege that, during the
investigation, defendant Paul Howard ("Howard") expressed his concem that "the IRS is gomg
to see something they don't like" in the investment proposals requested by the IRS (Amended
Complaint, ] 73). Based on a comment by one IRS agent, Plaintiffs also allege that the IRS
deemed that the Partnerships "did not own a working interest in any [oil/gas] wells" (Amended
Complaint, 7 80). Of course, any and all allegations concerning the IRS inquiry-including
those pertaining to the SLG Defendants-necessarily relate to matters that occurred after
Plaintiffs acquired their interests in the Partnerships.

Plaintiffs allege that in 2007 they received documents from one of the non-SLG
Defendants concerning the Condor, Hurricane and Indian Village Partnerships, which
supposedly revealed that representations in the investment proposals, in the quarterly
distributions and in correspondence with the IRS (along with corresponding verbal
representations) were false and that material facts were withheld with respect to the Partnerships'
interests, the IDC Deductions and the expected returns to Plaintiffs (Amended Complaint, {/ 83).

B. Allegations Specific to the SLG Defendants

The Amended Complaint contains few allegations directed specifically to the SLG

Defendants. As noted above, nowhere do Plaintiffs allege that they relied on representations or

 

> Plaintiffs further allege that the New York State Department of Taxation also began to review
their returns in or about July of 2007 and that their interest in one of the Partnerships (Indian
Village) was subject to audit (Amended Complaint, {| 79).
Case 1:07-cv-10956-LBS Document31 Filed 01/25/2008 Page 10 of 26

assertions by the SLG Defendants in deciding to purchase their interests in the Partnerships.
Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the following with respect to the SLG Defendants:

0x00B0 that the SLG Defendants prepared the Partnerships' tax returns and Schedules K-
1, which were in turn provided to Plaintiffs for use in preparing their personal tax returns, and
which reflected the IDC Deductions that the SLG Defendants allegedly knew (or should have
known) were improper (Amended Complaint, ff] 67, 102, 141, 152).

. that on or about January 29, 2007, the SLG Defendants misinformed the IRS that
there were no promotional/marketing materials used to solicit investments in the Partnerships;
and that on or about October 16, 2006, the SLG Defendants misinformed the IRS that there was
no legal opinion or prospectus describing the material tax deductibility issues (Amended
Complaint, {J 77, 78).

0x00B0 that the Partnerships were structured as a "common enterprise" with the
expectation of profits "derived from the efforts of the promoter Siegal, the Managing Partners
and/or the Siegal Companies or other third parties including Defendants Guralnick and SLG"
(Amended Complaint, 7 61), though nowhere do Plaintiffs allege that the SLG Defendants had
any role in structuring the Partnerships or did anything other than prepare the Partnerships' tax
returns and respond to questions from the IRS about them.

. that the SLG Defendants and Josephson were "agents, and professional advisors
placed in a positions (sic) of trust by Plaintiffs' (Amended Complaint, 0x00A7 137), and that the SLG
Defendants were engaged "to render full accounting and tax services and advice to the
Partnerships" (Amended Complaint, 0x00A7 150). Once again, though, Plaintiffs do not allege that the
SLG Defendants made any statement or representation on which they relied in deciding to

purchase their interests in the Partnerships.
