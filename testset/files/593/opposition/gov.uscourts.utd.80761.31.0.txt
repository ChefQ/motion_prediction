R. Civ. P. pertaining to service of process, a process she would have learned as a first year law
student several years ago. The clerk properly dealt with Plaintiff’s last failed attempt at serving
improperly issued summons upon the numerous individuals she has listed in her caption. See docket
item 19. It is counsel’s understanding that none of the individuals listed in Plaintiff’s caption as
Defendants have been actually served. It is counsel’s further understanding that Plaintiff has failed
to have any summons properly issued by the clerk. Plaintiff cites no legal authority for the
proposition that she can merely move the court to waive any, or all, of the court’s rules. “Litigants
and Courts are governed by the Federal and Local Rules of Civil Procedure, not the Helpful
Suggestions of Civil Procedure.” Bettis v. Toys "R" Us, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32518 (S.D. Fla.
Apr. 13, 2009).
The caption of this case shows that Plaintiff listed as Defendants “ALL MEMBERS OF THE
ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THOMAS JEFFERSON SCHOOL OF LAW 2006-2011” in addition to
sixteen individuals. It is counsel’s understanding that Plaintiff has included as Defendants in her
caption, though not necessarily in the text of her amended complaint, virtually everyone associated
with Defendant Thomas Jefferson School of Law against whom she held a grudge for some reason
or another. Reading Plaintiff’s motion literally we would presume she is asking that the court deem
the unnamed members of the ethics committee served as well as the individuals who have been
listed in the caption.
The fact that the Defendant was dismissed from law school for plagiarizing the work of
others, twice, does not mean those involved in the process by virtue of their positions with the
school are by any stretch of the imagination civically liable to her. The Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure do not allow her to deem served with process everyone she dislikes. If Plaintiff is serious
about suing people she should be required to follow the same rules everyone else does.
In Chambers v. NASCO, 501 U.S. 32 (1991), the court upheld a trial court’s award of
attorneys’ fees against a party who had repeatedly taken actions which were without merit and
which delayed the proceedings. These attorneys’ fees were awarded against the party individually.
The test for awarding attorneys fees is objective. Defendant moves the court for an award of
attorneys’ fees expended in association with this baseless motion.
DATED 8th day of August, 2011.
