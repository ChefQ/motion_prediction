OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR
SUBSTITUTED SERVICE AND RELATED
MOTIONS

JESSE ANNE MAJORS,
Plaintiff,
v.

Case No.: 2:11cv00558 CW

THOMAS JEFFERSON SCHOOL OF LAW,
et al,
Defendants,

Defendant Thomas Jefferson School of Law objects to Plaintiff’s motion for substituted
service.
1. Plaintiff has apparently failed to comply with the first step in the process for having a
Defendant served by failing to have summons properly issued by the clerk of the court.
2. Plaintiff has failed to show that the individual erstwhile Defendants are actually or
presumptively avoiding service. Rather she relies on her own presumption that they are avoiding

service merely because the fail to respond to her improperly issued summons. Had they actually
been served the would have been entitled to ask the court to quash service as defective because the
summons are defective.
3. Plaintiff has generally failed to comply with Rule 4 Fed. R. Civ. P.
4. Plaintiff would appear to remain subject to the court’s prior order precluding her from
filing additional motions pending appearance of her appointed counsel. She currently has counsel
and that order should be read as directing her not to file motions without the assistance or advice of
that counsel.
5. Plaintiff’s quest for alternative service should be stayed by the court until there is a valid
complaint on file in this matter which has passed muster under Rule 12(b) Fed. R. Civ. P. in order to
determine who may actually be a properly identified individual Defendant, if there are in fact any
properly identified individual Defendants.
6. This action was filed May 12, 2011 in the Third District Court for the State of Utah.
Plaintiff failed to serve the erstwhile individual Defendants within the 120 days required by Rule
4(m) Fed. R. Civ. P. and the action has been dismissed as to them by operation of law.
DATED this 3rd day of October, 2011.
