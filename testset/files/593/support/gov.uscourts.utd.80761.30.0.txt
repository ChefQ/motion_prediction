Case 2:11-cv-00558-CW -SA Document 30 Filed 08/05/11 Page 2 of 10

I certify that I served a copy of the Complaint and Summons-on the following defendants
by mail, registered agent or commercial courier service that requires the defendant to signa

receipt and provides for return of that receipt to me.

The original document acknowledging receipt via registered agent was included with the

original proof of service.

Plaintiff made substantial effort to send a copy of Complaint and Summons to each
individual defepdant via Certified Mail, Restricted Delivery, but these copies were returned to
Plaintiff with notification from U.S. Postal Service and Postmaster that Defendants noted below

refused to claim the letters.

For those Defendants marked with a letter "A" next to their name, first attempt for
delivery was made on June 8, 2011; second attempt was made.on June 16, 2011; mail was

returned, via hand-delivery by Postmaster, "returned to sender" on July 8, 2011.

For those Defendants marked with a letter "B" next to their name, first attempt for
delivery was made on June.9, 2011; second attempt was made.on June.21, 2011; mail was
returned to the post office June 28, 2011; a note requiring Plaintiff to pick up mail was. left on

July 20, 2011 and July 26, 2011; Plaintiff picked up returned mail on July 28, 2011.

For those Defendants marked with a letter "C" next to their name, first attempt for
delivery was made on June 9, 2011; second attempt was made on June 21, 2011; mail was
returned to the post office June 28, 2011; a note requiring Plaintiff to pick up mail was left on

July 24, 2011; Plaintiff picked up returned mail on July 28, 2011.

Plaintiff argues that Defendants intentionally refused delivery of Plaintiff's documents
because Defendants knew what the documents were and did not want to accept them or were

advised by counsel not to accept any correspondence from Plaintiff.

Plaintiff further argues that refusing delivery essentially put Defendants on notice of said
action. After all, it is not common practice for a law school to refuse delivery of documents from

their students.
The original documents acknowledging refusal of delivery are attached.

This proof of service may no longer be required as Defendants are now represented by
counsel, ROBERT H. WILDE, ATTORNEY AT LAW, P.C., 935 East South Union Avenue
