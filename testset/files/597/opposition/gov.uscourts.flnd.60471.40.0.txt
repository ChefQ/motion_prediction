CASE NO. 1:10-cv-253-SPM-GRJ

DEFENDANTS KOPPERS INC., BEAZER EAST, INC.,
AND KOPPERS HOLDINGS, INC.’S MOTION TO STRIKE AND
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT

Defendants Koppers Inc., Beazer East, Inc., and Koppers Holdings, Inc., by their
attorneys, move the Court to strike Paragraph 15 of the Affidavit of Jamie Arjona and
Paragraph 5 of the Affidavit of Dale Turlington, filed in support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Remand, on the grounds that the affidavits contain inadmissible hearsay. In support of
this Motion, Defendants submit the following memorandum of law:
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
1.

In their Motion to Remand, Plaintiffs argue that several putative class

members should be excluded from the putative class because they signed a retainer
agreement with other counsel. To support this argument, Plaintiffs rely on the Affidavit

Case 1:10-cv-00253-SPM -GRJ Document 40

Filed 02/25/11 Page 2 of 5

of Jamie Arjona (“Arjona Affidavit”), who works as a legal assistant for Plaintiffs’
counsel and claims to have “conducted a comprehensive analysis of property owners and
parcels in the Affected Area” after Defendants removed this case. (Doc. 30-1 at ¶¶ 3-4).
2.

Paragraph 15 of the Arjona Affidavit contains inadmissible hearsay and

should be stricken by the Court. In particular, the Arjona Affidavit states:
•

Arjona “met with Mr. Tanner Andrews and was informed that he had signed
retainer agreements” with three putative class members (Karen Scott, Charles
Mills and Danielle Devincenzo King) “for representation in an [sic] tax
reassessment against the Alachua County Property Appraiser’s office”. (Doc.
30-1 at ¶ 15) (emphasis added);

•

Arjona “was informed that an additional four potential class members [James
Frank O’Steen, Farinda O’Steen, Selena Pak Patterson and Erik Hushelpeck]
have signed retainer agreements with” attorneys who filed a separate putative
class action relating to the Site. (Id.) (emphasis added); and

•

Arjona has “been informed” that other counsel is currently representing
another putative class member [Carla Melgarejo] in a separate individual
action. (Id.) (emphasis added).

3.

This paragraph recites nothing more than out-of-court statements allegedly

made by Mr. Andrews and other anonymous individuals, and Plaintiffs have offered these
alleged secondhand statements to prove the truth of the matters purportedly asserted by
the third party declarants. As such, this paragraph contains inadmissible hearsay and
should be stricken by the Court. See Stoudemire v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co.,
24 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1257 n.3 (M.D. Ala. 1998) (granting motion to strike affidavit
submitted in support of motion to remand); FED. R. EVID. 801(c), 802 (West 2010); See
also Lazaro v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 186 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1214 (M.D. Fla. 2001)
(holding that portions of certified report which recounted statements allegedly made by
third party declarant constituted inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence
801(c)).

Plaintiffs further argue that two additional putative class members, Susan

P. Turlington and Dale Turlington, should be excluded from the putative class because
they have opted out of this proceeding. To support this argument, Plaintiffs rely on the
Affidavit of Dale Turlington (“Turlington Affidavit”), which states in pertinent part: “I
told Attorney Paul S. Rothstein that I and my wife, Susan Turlington, did not want to be a
part of” this proceeding. (Doc. 30-9 at ¶ 5). Similar to Paragraph 15 of the Arjona
Affidavit, this paragraph recites an out-of-court statement allegedly made by Mr.
Turlington to Plaintiffs’ counsel. As such, this paragraph contains inadmissible hearsay
and should be stricken. Stoudemire, 24 F. Supp. 2d at 1257 n.3; FED. R. EVID. 801(c),
802; Lazaro, 186 F. Supp. 2d at 1214.
WHEREFORE, Defendants Koppers Inc., Beazer East, Inc., and Koppers
Holdings, Inc., respectfully request this Honorable Court to enter an Order striking
Paragraph 15 of the Arjona Affidavit and Paragraph 5 of the Turlington Affidavit and
award such additional or alternative relief as the Court deems just under the
circumstances.
CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE
Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, the undersigned hereby certifies that counsel for
Defendants Koppers Inc., Beazer East, Inc., and Koppers Holdings, Inc., have conferred
with counsel for Plaintiffs in a good faith attempt to resolve by agreement the issues
raised in the foregoing Motion to Strike but did not reach agreement regarding any of the
issues raised in Defendants’ motion.
Date: February 25, 2011

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Paul K. Freeborn
