MOVING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS SECOND AMENDED
COMPLAINT WITH INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendants Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company; Hartford Underwriters
Insurance Company; Direct General Insurance Company; Horace Mann Insurance
Company; Mercury Insurance Company of Florida; National General Insurance
Online, Inc.; Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company; Nationwide Insurance
Company of Florida; Sentry Insurance a Mutual Company; Westfield Insurance
Company; Windhaven Insurance Company; and Zurich American Insurance
Company (collectively, “Moving Defendants”), bring this motion to dismiss the
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).
On February 21, 2014, Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint broadly alleging
that all Defendants committed the same acts against all Plaintiffs. That Complaint
was dismissed due to its failure to comply with basic pleading requirements including
specifying who did what to whom. The Amended Complaint failed to correct those
pleading deficiencies and was likewise dismissed. 1 The meager specificity of the
Second Amended Complaint only serves to demonstrate that the individual Plaintiffs
do not have claims against the Moving Defendants. The Second Amended
Complaint fails to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure; and it fails to allege a plausible cause of action under Rule 12(b)(6)
for any of the Four Counts of the Second Amended Complaint.

1

The Moving Defendants hereby incorporate by reference the arguments made in the various
motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint. These briefs are Doc. 191, 192, 201, 204, 209-212, 215,
216, 235, 243, 249, 254, 270, 273, and 285-88. Moving Defendants also incorporate the arguments
asserted in the Motions to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint filed by all other Defendants.

1

In sum, Plaintiffs were given two full and fair opportunities after the original
Complaint to cure these fundamental and fatal pleading deficiencies as to all
Defendants, and they failed to do so. Accordingly, the Moving Defendants
respectfully request that the Second Amended Complaint be dismissed with
prejudice.

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

This is the third Complaint filed in this year-old case. The first complaint
(Doc. 1) was dismissed because it suffered from a “host of problems,” including that,
“with limited exceptions, the allegations of wrongdoing are attributed, collectively, to
every Defendant and alleged to have been perpetrated upon every Plaintiff.” (Doc.
110). This Court allowed Plaintiffs to re-plead on or before June 27, 2014.
Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on June 28, 2014, which was
substantively identical to the original Complaint, merely listing all Defendants by
name instead of simply using the term “all Defendants.” (Doc. 167). This Court
dismissed the Amended Complaint. (Doc. 291, amended on January 22, 2015 (Doc.
293)). The Court held that the prior deficiencies of the Complaint remained, and
additionally explained why each of the individual causes of action were not
supported by the general allegations in the Amended Complaint. Recognizing that
the term “Defendants” did not refer to all Defendants, the Court included this specific
instruction in its Order: “The Plaintiffs should insure that their references to ‘the
Defendants’ are, in fact, intended to encompass every single Defendant.” Id. at 6.
The Court allowed Plaintiffs to re-plead on or before February 10, 2015.
On February 11, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (Doc.
296). In the first two complaints, by broadly alleging that all Defendants committed
the exact same acts against all Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs tried to conceal that they did not
actually have facts to support the claims asserted by each of twenty (20) separate
Plaintiffs against each of thirty-nine (39) separate Defendants. Now, without the

3

camouflage of generalized pleadings, it is apparent that Plaintiffs do not have – and
never did have – specific factual allegations to support their claims against each of
the Defendants.
While some of the twenty (20) Plaintiffs have added some factual allegations
regarding some of the thirty-nine (39) Defendants, the Plaintiffs have failed to
provide such factual allegations as to all Plaintiffs and all Defendants. Furthermore,
to the extent the Second Amended Complaint contains additional allegations, they
are wholly immaterial. As to the Moving Defendants, the Second Amended
Complaint has not merely failed to correct the pleading deficiencies which caused
the dismissal of the previous two complaints, the addition of some isolated facts
shines a spotlight on the truth that Plaintiffs have no basis for their broad allegations
by all Plaintiffs against all Defendants, or even one Plaintiff against any one of the
Moving Defendants. Therefore, the Second Amended Complaint should be
dismissed with prejudice against the Moving Defendants.
The problems with the Second Amended Complaint fall into the following
primary categories:
1. The Second Amended Complaint fails to include any
specific substantive allegations as to the Moving
Defendants;
2. The few additional price and “posted” rate allegations
concerning some of the Moving Defendants do not show
any agreement, much less an unlawful one;
3. The allegations regarding membership in trade
organizations are not evidence of any purported
conspiracy; and

4

4. The few divergent factual allegations in the Second
Amended Complaint show that the Defendants are not
acting uniformly or pursuant to any anticompetitive
agreement.
The complete absence of any substantive allegations as to some Defendants, as
well as the scant and immaterial allegations directed at other Defendants, require
that the Second Amended Complaint be dismissed with prejudice as to the Moving
Defendants.
I.

THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC
AS TO THE MOVING DEFENDANTS
There are absolutely no allegations against the Moving Defendants regarding

the State Law Claims of Tortious Interference or Quantum Meruit. Even if shotgun
pleadings and group labels were allowed – which they are not – there are no factual
allegations to support these claims against any of the Moving Defendants.
Therefore, the State Law claims must be dismissed with prejudice.
Likewise, for the federal antitrust claims, there are no allegations supporting a
claim of an agreement to fix prices or an agreement to boycott suppliers as to the
Moving Defendants. The following Moving Defendants are alleged to have done
nothing more than to pay the same labor rate to four identified body shops during
2013: The Hartford, Horace Mann, Mercury, National General, Nationwide, Sentry, 2
and Westfield. SAC ¶¶ 171; 176-78 (Doc. 296). Other Moving Defendants are
alleged to have taken only one or two additional inconsequential acts: Nationwide
2

The Second Amended Complaint erroneously identifies Sentry as part of the “Farmers” group of
companies. SAC ¶¶ 211, 407. Since no such corporate relationship exists, the Farmers group
allegations are irrelevant to Sentry, and this error casts further doubt on all generalized allegations as
to the purported conduct of any Defendant. SAC ¶¶ 126, 211-14, 248-49, 334, 353, 407.

5

(Id. ¶ 185) (plaintiffs were told they are the only shops trying to raise their rates) and
(Id. ¶ 218) (only recently began paying for feather, prime and block); and Horace
Mann (Id. ¶ 302) (delays in sending appraisers where liability is clear). Two of the
Moving Defendants have no price allegations and are alleged only to have done the
following: Direct General demands pictures of each stage of repairs (Id. ¶ 120) and
Windhaven refuses to pay for denib and finesse (Id. ¶ 220). There are no
allegations of any actions taken by Zurich directed at any Plaintiff. Therefore, the
Sherman Act Claims against the Moving Defendants should be dismissed with
prejudice.
A.

The State Law Claims for Tortious Interference with Business
Relations and Quantum Meruit Must Be Dismissed.

Simply stated, there are no allegations in the Second Amended Complaint to
support Plaintiffs’ state law claims against any of the Moving Defendants. Although
some other Defendants are singled out in a series of customer vignette allegations
(SAC ¶¶ 266-91) (Doc. 296), there are no such allegations concerning the Moving
Defendants. There is no mention of any of the Moving Defendants in Count Three
(Tortious Interference) or Count Four (Quantum Meruit). Nor are there any shotgun
allegations in other parts of the Second Amended Complaint that even arguably
relate to these Counts. The lack of allegations, along with the substantive
arguments made in the prior briefing described above (see note 1, supra), dictates
dismissal of Counts Three and Four with prejudice as to the Moving Defendants.

6

B.

The Antitrust Claims Count I (Price Fixing) and Count II (Boycott)
Are Insufficiently Pled As to the Moving Defendants.

To state a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must allege:
(1) an agreement between two or more parties (2) that unreasonably restrains trade.
Levine v. Cent. Fla. Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th Cir. 1996). See
also Duty Free Americas, Inc. v. Estee Lauder Companies, Inc., 946 F. Supp. 2d
1321, 1328-29 (S.D. Fl. May 9, 2013) (“Both § 1 and § 2 conspiracy claims ‘require
the same threshold showing – the existence of an agreement to restrain trade.’”)
(quoting Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d 1438, 1460, n. 35 (11th
Cir.1991)).
With respect to both Sherman Act claims (price fixing and boycott), the
Second Amended Complaint contains absolutely no allegation as to any of the
Moving Defendants entering into any agreement to fix prices or to boycott suppliers.
That was a fatal defect in the prior complaints, and it has not been corrected. See
Order at 17 (Doc. 293) (stating that Plaintiffs’ allegations “fall far short” of alleging
enough factual matter, taken as true, to suggest that an agreement was made).
Further, undermining any suggestion of agreed-upon parallel action, the Second
Amended Complaint does not allege that the Moving Defendants: 1) engaged in
improper “steering;” 2) made disparaging remarks about any shop; 3) refused to deal
with any shop; or 4) changed their price in concert with that of any other Defendant.
Indeed, the few allegations directed at other Defendants make it clear that there are
no such allegations regarding the Moving Defendants. See e.g., SAC ¶¶ 218, 224,
261-291, 321-347 (Doc. 296). The maxim of statutory construction “expressio unius

7

est exclusio alterius” is compelling in its logic here – the addition of some facts as to
certain Defendants by certain Plaintiffs only serves to highlight the failure to plead
such facts as to the Moving Defendants. See, e.g., Henry v. Lipford, No. 5:12–cv–
34–RS–GRJ, 2013 WL 1799009, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Mar. 22, 2013) (on Second
Amended Complaint, dismissing claims against two defendants due to failure to
state specific facts as to those defendants, but allowing one claim to go forward as
to third defendant), report and recommendation adopted, 2013 WL 1799033 (N.D.
Fla. Apr. 29, 2013). To be clear, the Moving Defendants in no way suggest that the
few scattered allegations leveled against those other Defendants are sufficient to
support a cause of action against any of them. 3 The absence of such allegations as
to the Moving Defendants, however, exposes the absolute failure of the amended
pleading as to the Moving Defendants.
The only factual allegations added in the Second Amended Complaint
regarding the Moving Defendants are legally irrelevant and are wholly insufficient to
save this repeatedly-dismissed complaint. The Second Amended Complaint alleges
that some, but not all, of these Moving Defendants have these attributes:
•

Some, but not all, are alleged to have certain market share
percentages in Florida in 2012 (SAC ¶¶ 76,77) (Doc. 296);

•

Some, but not all, used DRP programs at some point, which are “not in
and of themselves a problem” (Id. ¶¶ 126, 130) (but there are no
allegations of any improper steering as to these Defendants);

3

The allegations against State Farm, GEICO, Progressive, Farmers, Infinity, USAA, Allstate,
Travelers and Florida Farm Bureau shall be addressed by those Defendants separately.

8

•

Some, but not all, paid $42 per hour for body labor to four (4) shops in
2013 (Id. ¶¶ 171-73, 176-78);

•

Different Moving Defendants used one of three different estimating
repair databases (Id. ¶¶ 197-200); and

•

Some, but not all, Moving Defendants are members of “at least one of
three major insurance industry trade associations” (Id. ¶¶ 352-76).

These vague allegations do nothing to nudge Plaintiffs’ antitrust claims across the
line to state a plausible claim against the Moving Defendants. Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). For example, simply having a DRP program is
not unlawful; and there are no allegations of improper steering or refusal to deal as
to the Moving Defendants. Likewise, alleging that some, but not all, Moving
Defendants paid $42 per hour to four shops in 2013 is not evidence of an antitrust
agreement. And there is no allegation of any of the Moving Defendants agreeing to
a refusal to deal. Therefore, the Sherman Act claims against the Moving Defendants
should be dismissed with prejudice.
II.

THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT’S ALLEGATIONS FAIL TO SHOW
ANY UNLAWFUL AGREEMENT
Aside from the lack of specificity, even the facts plaintiffs do allege have no

relevance to their claims. The pricing allegations do not show any anti-competitive
agreement; their “posted” rate allegations are meaningless; their allegations
regarding membership in various trade organizations are irrelevant; and their
remaining disparate allegations affirmatively demonstrate there is no agreement
among the defendants. Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed.

9

A.

The Price Allegations Do Not Show Any Anti-Competitive Agreement.

The price allegations of the Second Amended Complaint leveled against
selected Defendants are wholly inadequate to infer any type of agreement among
the Defendants. The Sherman Act prohibits an agreement among competitors to fix
prices in a relevant market. The Sherman Act does not prohibit competitors from
independently paying the same market price to suppliers.
Here, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that twenty-two (22) out of
thirty-nine (39) Defendants paid a labor rate of $42 per hour as to four (4) body
shops in Palm Harbor in 2013. SAC ¶ 168-71 (Doc. 296). The Second Amended
Complaint also alleges that some – but not all – Defendants paid $42 per hour for
labor in 2013 to four body shops in Central Florida. Only nine (9) of the Moving
Defendants are identified as having paid $42 per hour. See id. ¶¶ 171, 176-78. The
Second Amended Complaint does not allege that all Defendants paid $42 per hour
to all twenty (20) Plaintiff shops – or to all shops throughout Florida. Indeed, there
are no allegations regarding the prices charged or received by seventeen (17) of the
twenty (20) named Plaintiffs. The allegations regarding payments made to four
shops (three named Plaintiffs plus Ideal Auto), at some point in 2013, do nothing to
show any type of agreement to fix prices.
Even if Plaintiffs alleged the same price for all shops in some relevant
geographic market – which they have not – that would still not show or plausibly
suggest an agreement. Rather, healthy competition would result in price
convergence. See In re Graphics Processing Antitrust Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1011,

10

1022 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (“We must remember that competitive market forces will tend
to drive the prices of like goods to the same level, so like prices on like products are
not, standing alone, sufficient to implicate price-fixing.”). See also Quality Auto
Body, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 660 F.2d 1195, 1205 (7th Cir. 1981) (“the practice of
the insurance companies to calculate the reimbursement for its insured based upon
the lowest prevailing price in the market place (and to insure the integrity of that
estimate by having an open list of competing shops which will generally accept it) is
the very essence of competition.”) (quoting Chick’s Auto Body v. State Farm Mutual
Auto. Ins. Co., 168 N.J. Super. 68, 87 (1979)). This Court has already stated “[i]t is
not illegal for a party to decide it is unwilling to pay a higher hourly rate than its
competitors have to pay, and the fact that a number of the Defendants made
statements to that effect does not tip the scales toward illegality.” Order at 18 (Doc.
293).
Nor is it surprising that these insurance companies, who are in the market
buying repair services on a daily basis, would have a very good idea of the prices at
which various shops are willing to perform work. Beyond their daily negotiations, the
insurers have knowledge of various rates accepted by shops through their own DRP
relationships: “The vast majority of major insurers created DRPs over the years . . .
.” SAC ¶ 126 (Doc. 296). The Second Amended Complaint also discloses that
Plaintiff Stewart was a DRP shop for both State Farm and Progressive for portions of
2013-14. Id. ¶¶ 317-18. Likewise, A&E was a DRP shop for GEICO, State Farm,
and Liberty Mutual for all or a portion of 2013-14. Id. ¶¶ 336. And Express was a

11

GEICO DRP shop for the first few months of 2013. Id. ¶ 313. Accordingly, it makes
sense that these carriers, as well as “the vast majority of major insurers [which had]
created DRP’s” (Id. ¶ 126), would know what rates these shops were accepting in
2013. None of this supports a plausible inference of collusion or agreement.
While Plaintiffs allege generally that Defendants paid the same $42 per hour
rate, Plaintiffs also allege that State Farm and GEICO (and some unnamed, “other
Defendant insurers”) raised their rates to $44 per hour. Id. ¶ 182. Again, there are
no specific allegations regarding any of the Moving Defendants. Vague and
generalized group allegations that “[t]he Defendants all raise their ‘market rates’
within days of State Farm” (Id. ¶ 416) are contrary to this Court’s Orders demanding
that such allegations be made with specificity. See Orders dated June 11, 2014
(Doc. 110) and January 22, 2015 (Doc. 293). 4 Indeed, this broad, generalized
allegation is undercut by the allegation that: “Other [unnamed] Defendant insurers
[but not “all”] decided the market rate was $44 per hour within the following thirty
days.” SAC ¶ 182 (Doc. 296).
Nor would a price change show collusion if competitors were forced to raise
the price they must pay for services in order to keep up with competition. Williamson
Oil Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287, 1311 (11th Cir. 2003) (rejecting as

4

Further, improperly lumping together all “Defendants”, which this Court has twice told Plaintiffs is
improper and grounds for dismissal, remains a pervasive issue in this Second Amended Complaint.
As a continuing example, in paragraph 189 of the Second Amended Complaint Plaintiffs broadly
assert that, “[t]he Defendant insurers have over the course of years exerted their combined market
share power to refuse payment or full payment for repair processes and procedures required to return
vehicles to pre-accident condition.” That generalized allegation against all Defendants rests on the
factually unsupported inference that the Defendants have agreed to use their “combined market
share power.” Without factual allegations showing an agreement, the antitrust claims fail.

12

a plus factor competitors following price increases, as it was in the economic
interests of the competitors to do so). Moreover, the insurers, which are in the
market on a daily basis, would not need to collude to learn of a competitor’s price
movement. They would quickly learn about it from their own negotiations in the
market. Indeed, it would be the body shops that received higher rates from State
Farm and GEICO that would loudly trumpet such price information to all other
insurance companies and demand the same, higher rate.
B.

Four “Posted” Rates are Irrelevant.

Out of this entire 448-paragraph complaint, the twenty (20) named Plaintiffs
provide the posted rate of only four (4) identified body shops: 1) Premier Paint and
Body in Fort Walton Beach, $44 per hour (SAC ¶ 176) (Doc. 296); 2) Express Paint
and Body in Lakeland, $48 per hour (Id. ¶ 179); 3) C&C Automotive in Cocoa Beach,
$46 per hour (Id. ¶ 178); and 4) non-party Ideal Auto in Palm Harbor, $48 - $52 per
hour (Id. ¶ 168). There are no allegations regarding any rates posted for any other
Plaintiff or for any other body shop throughout all of Florida. 5
The Second Amended Complaint never explains why the “posted rate” is
relevant or meaningful. In fact, it is not. A body shop’s posted rate is as
meaningless as the “sticker price” in a car dealer’s showroom. While that might be
the price at which the seller would like to sell, it is not the actual, negotiated sale
price at which sales are made. And that is the only price that has relevance and
meaning. See Quality Auto Body, 660 F.2d at 1204 (“the insurer's refusal to pay
5

The Second Amended Complaint does allege that two of three, unnamed body shops in Palm
Harbor had posted rates of $44 per hour. SAC ¶168. There is no allegation regarding Plaintiff North
Bay Auto, which is alleged to be doing business in Palm Harbor, Florida. Id. ¶ 26.

13

more than the prevailing competitive rate is not illegal.”). Moreover, the Complaint
says nothing about what other competing shops were actually charging at the time.
Why would any insurer pay $44 per hour for labor if these four shops, as well as
other shops would do the same job for $42 per hour? Likewise, why would any
buyer agree to pay Ideal Auto $52 per hour to fix a European car when Plaintiff
Premier Paint posts a price of $44 per hour for all cars – and actually does the work
for $42 per hour? Indeed, each time a body shop agrees to take on a new job at
$42 per hour – regardless of its “posted rate” – that body shop is, in effect, setting
the actual market price. 6
C.

Mere Opportunities to Conspire Do Not Demonstrate Any Alleged
Agreement.

Plaintiffs allege that there have been numerous “opportunities for Defendants
to conspire”, citing trade association memberships for some of the Moving
Defendants. See SAC ¶¶ 352-76 (Doc. 296). These bare allegations, however, are
insufficient to demonstrate any alleged agreement among the Defendants:

6

Nor has the Second Amended Complaint placed these isolated prices in the context of any
meaningful and consistent geographic market from which to infer any agreement. At times, the
Second Amended Complaint refers to a market for the entire State of Florida (SAC ¶¶ 75, 79, 80)
(Doc. 296); various “metropolitan areas as well as discrete areas of a given state, such as Florida.”
(Id. ¶ 174); “across the entire central portion of the State” (Id. ¶ 175-79); “across vast geographic
areas of the State of Florida” (Id. ¶ 414); and the city limits of Palm Harbor, Florida. (Id. ¶¶ 168-71)
Yet, by choosing to allege only the rates paid to a handful of selected body shops in Palm Harbor,
Fort Walton Beach, Lakeland, and Cocoa Beach, the Plaintiffs would have this Court infer a massive
price-fixing scheme. See Thompson v. Metropolitan Multi-List, Inc., 934 F.2d 1566, 1573 (11th Cir.
1991) (stating that the Supreme Court has explained that the concept of a geographic market is
essentially an economic concept in which the courts should examine ‘supplier-customer relations’ and
that ‘The goal is to determine how economic actors function in terms of where buyers seek supplies
and sellers seek purchasers.’”). Here, not only do Plaintiffs fail to identify the various competitors who
compete for sales in any particular market, Plaintiffs fail to allege anything beyond the prices “posted”
by only four identified body shops.

14

The class posits that PM, RJR, B&W and Lorillard
enjoyed numerous opportunities to conspire, and that this
supports their collusion claim. We unambiguously held in
Todorov, however, that “the mere opportunity to conspire
among antitrust defendants does not, standing alone,
permit the inference of conspiracy.” 921 F.2d at 1456
(citing Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Med. Ctr., 891 F.2d 810, 827
(11th Cir.1990), overruled in part on other grounds by
City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., 499 U.S. 365,
111 S.Ct. 1344, 113 L.Ed.2d 382 (1991)). Indeed, the
opportunity to fix prices without any showing that
appellees actually conspired does not tend to exclude the
possibility that they did not avail themselves of such
opportunity or, conversely, that they actually did conspire.
Appellants may not rely on this proposition to support
their allegations in this case.
Williamson Oil, 346 F.3d at 1319. These allegations regarding diverse trade
association memberships do nothing to show an agreement.
D.

The Disparate Allegations of the Second Amended Complaint Militate
Against an Agreement.

Plaintiffs’ overall allegations show differences rather than any agreement to
act uniformly. For example, not all carriers use the same estimating databases;
some use CCC, some use Mitchell, and others use ADP/Audatex. See SAC ¶¶ 197200 (Doc. 296). Only twenty-two (22) out of the thirty-nine (39) defendants paid $42
per hour as a labor rate to four (4) body shops in Palm Harbor in 2013 (and, as
argued above, paying the same rate does not substantiate Plaintiffs’ claims). Out of
thirty nine (39) Defendants, the Second Amended Complaint identifies only twenty
(20) companies that have DRP shops. Id. ¶ 126. “Not all DRP’s are poor repair
facilities, not even most. Most are honorable, hardworking and professional collision
repairers.” Id. ¶ 129. Some Defendants are alleged to have engaged in isolated

15

instances of “steering” (Id. ¶¶ 261-320), but there are no such allegations as to
others. So too, Plaintiffs allege that some Defendants made false or disparaging
statements (Id. ¶¶ 261-92), but there is no such allegation regarding other
Defendants. Some (State Farm and GEICO) raised prices (Id. ¶ 182), while no
others are specifically identified as having done so.
The specific allegations leveled against a few Defendants underscore the fact
that not all Defendants are taking uniform action. For example, Direct General and
Allstate, alone, are alleged to demand photos at stages of repair. Id. ¶¶ 120, 122.
There is no allegation that any other insurer does the same. Some insurers – but
not others – are alleged to have told Plaintiffs that they are “the only shop” seeing a
price increase. Id. ¶ 185. Only the Farmers Defendants are alleged to use “NuGen
IT” software for inspections. Id. ¶ 211. Yet the Second Amended Complaint says
nothing about other insurers doing the same. According to the Second Amended
Complaint, “Defendants State Farm, Progressive and USAA . . . refused to pay” for
feather, block and prime procedure; but “GEICO and Nationwide” are alleged to be
“paying for this procedure . . . .” . Id. ¶¶ 218-19. The Second Amended Complaint
says nothing about the other insurers paying, or not paying, for feather, block, and
prime procedures. So too, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that some
insurers pay for denib and finesse, while others do not. Id. ¶¶ 220. These
numerous alleged differences between the Defendants cut against any inference of
agreement. It is fundamental that the variations alleged by Plaintiffs undermine their
assertion of collusion. See, e.g., In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 132

16

(3d Cir. 1999) (affirming summary judgment where the facts “refute rather than
support” plaintiffs’ allegations of parallel conduct). See also In re Beef Indus.
Antitrust Litig., 907 F.2d 510, 514 (5th Cir. 1990) (“When an antitrust plaintiff relies
on circumstantial evidence of conscious parallelism to prove a § 1 claim, he must
first demonstrate that the defendants' actions were parallel. The cattlemen have not
done this.”) (citations omitted); Aviation Specialties, Inc. v. United Technologies
Corp., 568 F.2d 1186, 1192 (5th Cir. 1978) (plaintiff “brought forth no evidence of
parallel behavior suggesting an unlawful agreement.”).
III.

THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITH
PREJUDICE
Plaintiffs have no right to file yet another Complaint. “The district court . . .

need not ‘allow an amendment (1) where there has been undue delay, bad faith,
dilatory motive, or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously
allowed; (2) where allowing amendment would cause undue prejudice to the
opposing party; or (3) where amendment would be futile.” Corsello v. Lincare, Inc.,
428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, all three of these rationales for
dismissal with prejudice are met.
First, this is already the third iteration of the Complaint in less than a year,
and this Court has already provided clear instructions to the Plaintiffs as to how to
cure their pleading deficiencies. They have ignored, or cannot comply with, this
Court’s direction. Second, allowing a further amendment to this Complaint would
unduly prejudice the Moving Defendants, as they have been forced to incur the
expenses of defending this litigation for over a year without seeing any specific,

17

substantive factual allegation against them. Finally, any amendment as to the
Moving Defendants would clearly be futile, as Plaintiffs obviously have no specific
allegations against the Moving Defendants, or else they would have included them in
the Second Amended Complaint. Indeed, Plaintiffs previous allegations of all
Defendants performing the exact same acts as to all Plaintiffs, have now been
shown to have been baseless. Thus, the Second Amended Complaint should be
dismissed as to the Moving Defendants with prejudice. See, e.g., Aquatherm
Industries, Inc. v. Florida Power & Light Co., 145 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 1998)
(affirming dismissal with prejudice because “we conclude Aquatherm can prove no
set of facts in support of its claims which would entitle it to relief under the federal
antitrust laws “); In re Online Travel Co. (OTC) Hotel Booking Antitrust Litig., No.
3:12–cv–3515–B, 2014 WL 5460450, at *6 (Oct. 27, 2014 N.D. Tex.) (denying leave
to amend because “[l]ike before, an obvious alternative narrative of innocent,
business-driven behavior is, at minimum, equally likely to explain the OTA
Defendants' parallel activities re-cast in the [second amended complaint].”); Ivanovic
v. Overseas Mgmt. Co., No. 11-80726-CIV, 2011 WL 5508824, at *4 (S.D.Fla., Nov.
09, 2011) (“As Plaintiff fails to . . . satisfy basic federal pleading standards, the
Amended Complaint must be dismissed as to all eight moving Defendants for failure
to state a claim. Such dismissal should be with prejudice because Plaintiff has
already once been granted an opportunity to amend and it is apparent that any
further amendment would be futile.”).

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth herein it is requested that this Court issue an Order
dismissing the Second Amended Complaint herein against Moving Defendants with
prejudice and granting Moving Defendants such other and further relief as this Court
deems just and proper.

Dated March 4, 2015
