1 || have asserted federal claims against defendants under the Fair Labor Standards Act
2 || ("FLSA") and Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA)',

3 || thereby providing the court with jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331. (Ct.

4 || Rec. 1 0x00A7 4). The Court has authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear

5 || plaintiffs' related state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1367(a). Defendants do

6 || not contest either of these bases for jurisdiction. The arguments that defendants do

7 || raise in their motion have no basis in established law. Therefore, defendants'

8 |} motions should be denied.

9 I. STATEMENT OF THE CASE
10 This is an action filed by three Chilean sheepherders who were recruited by
11 || defendant Western Range Association to work in the United States on a temporary
12 |} basis pursuant to the H-2A visa program. Plaintiff sheepherders were sent to work
13 || at defendant Fernandez' ranch in Centerville, Washington. Under the H-2A
14 || program, an agricultural employer may contract with temporary foreign guest
15 || workers if it obtains certification from the U.S. Department of Labor ("DOL") that
16 || qualified U.S. workers are not available and that employment of the foreign guest
17 || workers will not adversely affect wages or working conditions of similarly situated
18 || U.S. workers. Based on defendants' applications for H-2A certification and

19 || representations that plaintiffs would be employed as range sheepherders, the DOL

 

20
' Plaintiffs assert the FLSA claim against defendant WRA only and the TVPRA claim against Defendant Fernandez
only.

Case 2:11-cv-03088-RMP Document 33 _ Filed 11/08/11

1 || permitted defendants to contract with plaintiffs under terms that included a wage

2 || rate specific to sheepherders, $750 per month regardless of the number of hours

3 || worked. (Ct. Rec. 1 at ff] 11, 15, 27-30.)

4 However defendants did not assign plaintiffs to work primarily as range

5 || sheepherders. Instead, plaintiffs were put to work as ranch hands on defendant

6 || Fernandez' ranch, for which they were legally entitled to substantially higher

7 || wages than they were paid. Furthermore, defendant Fernandez treated plaintiffs

8 || abusively, threatened them with deportation if they left the boundaries of the ranch

9 || without his permission and otherwise restricted plaintiffs' contact with the outside
10 || world in violation of the TVPRA. (Ct. Rec. | at J] 42-44, 79-84.)
11 When considering a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, a court must accept "all
12 || allegations of material fact as true and construe them in the light most favorable"
13 || to the non-moving party. North County Community Alliance v. Salazar, 573 F.3d
14 || 738, 741 - 742 (9th Cir. 2009). Plaintiffs have asserted violations of the Fair Labor
15 || Standards Act, breach of contract, quantum meruit and violations of state wage
16 || laws against defendant WRA, and violations of the federal TVPRA, breach of
17 || contract, quantum meruit and violations of state wage law against defendants

18 || Fernandez. (See Ct. Rec. 1 0x00A7 60-84).

19 Il. ARGUMENT
20 A. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' federal
and state-law claims.

l This court has subject matter jurisdiction in this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

2 || 0x00A71331 over Plaintiffs' federal TVPRA and FLSA claims and pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

3 || 0x00A71367 over Plaintiffs' state contract and wage claims. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges

4 || a federal claim under the TVPRA against defendants Fernandez and a FLSA claim

5 || against defendant WRA. Plaintiffs' complaint also asserts related state-law causes

6 || of action under Washington wage law and contract law. Since the state claims arise

7 || out of the same facts as do the federal claims, the state claims are subject to

8 || supplemental jurisdiction under 0x00A71367.

9 Defendants do not dispute the Court's jurisdiction in this case pursuant to 28
10 || U.S.C. 0x00A71331 and 0x00A71367. Instead, defendants have raised arguments that have no
11 || basis in the law and misrepresent plaintiffs' asserted basis for jurisdiction. Given
12 || the Court's undisputed jurisdiction pursuant to 0x00A71331 and 0x00A71367, the arguments
13 || advanced in defendants' memorandum fail to establish any valid challenge to
14 || jurisdiction. Defendants' main point of attack of the Court's jurisdiction in this
15 || case -- that plaintiffs have no basis to remedy defendants' breach of their H-2A

16 || contract obligations in any court - is unsupported by any authority.

 

 

17 B. Defendants' arguments that state-law contract claims are not
available to H-2A workers are baseless.
18
i. H-2A workers may bring state contract claims for breach of
19 the H-2A clearance orders.
0 The Ninth Circuit has held specifically that H-2A contract claims, while not

1 || creating independent federal jurisdiction, do give rise to contract claims under state
2 || contract law. Nieto-Santos v. Fletcher Farms, 743 F.2d 638 at 641, n.5 (9th Cir.
3 || 1984). Defendants' contentions that breach-of-contract claims for H-2A contracts
4 || are precluded by DOL agency remedies or by 8 U.S.C. 0x00A71329 (Ct. Rec. 28 at 3 -
5 {| 11) are thus contrary to direct circuit precedent.
6 Defendants' arguments are also entirely unsupported even by persuasive
7 {| authority, since every court to consider contract claims by H-2A workers has, like
8 || Nieto Santos, held that H-2A clearance orders are employment contracts that can
9 || be enforced in court. See, e.g., Arriaga v. Fla. Pac. Farms, 305 F.3d 1228, 1233 n.
10 || 5 (clearance orders are contracts) and 1246 - 1248 (applying state contract law to
11 || the clearance orders' terms) (1 1th Cir. 2002); Salazar-Calderon v. Presidio Valley
12 || Farmers Ass'n, 765 F.2d 1334, 1342 (Sth Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1035
13 || (1986) (holding that the DOL regulations are incorporated into the contracts);
14 || Frederick County Fruit Growers v. McLaughlin, 703 F.Supp. 1021, 1030 - 1031
15 || (D.C.D.C. 1989); Hernandez v. Two Brothers Farm, 579 F.Supp.2d 1379, 1383
16 || (S.D. Fla 2008); Perez-Benites v. Candy Brand, 2011 WL 1978414 at *6 (W.D.

17 || Ark. 2011). Defendants have cited no case that has held to the contrary.

 

 

 

18 ii. Federal regulation of H-2A contracts does not preclude
workers' enforcement of contract rights; instead, the H-2A
19 contracts incorporate federal, state, and local regulations.

1 || law, courts have necessarily rejected defendants' argument (expressed in Ct. Rec.
2 || 28 at 3) that the existence of a federal agency enforcement mechanism precludes
3 state-law contract claims. See Arriaga, 305 F.3d at 1235 - 1237; Frederick County,
4 || 703 F.Supp. at 1030 - 1031; Centeno-Bernuy v. Becker Farms, 564 F Supp.2d 166,
5 || 183 - 185 (W.D.N.Y. 2008). Indeed, plaintiffs are not even required to exhaust
6 || administrative remedies before filing a contract action. See Centeno-Bernuy, 564
7 || F.Supp.2d at 184.
8 Defendants suggest that the federal regulatory scheme's relationship to
9 || Plaintiffs' contract claims requires the Court to conclude that H-2A workers have
10 || no contractual remedies under H-2A contracts, either because they are preempted
11 || by the regulatory scheme (Ct. Rec. 28 at 3 - 7) or because H-2A contract claims
12 || are "disguised" attempts to bring a private action to enforce a federal statutory
13 || scheme (Ct. Rec. 28 at 14), which is, in defendants' view, not allowed under Cort
14 || v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975). No court has adopted either of those arguments (See
15 || cases cited supra.)
16 Courts uniformly deal with the interrelation between the federal statute and
17 || the contract cause of action by finding that the "terms of a job clearance order
18 || which reflect DOL requirements become a part of the employment contract as a
19 || matter of law." (emphasis added) Frederick County, 703 F.Supp. at 1031, citing

1 || Circuit, find that H-2A contracts are enforceable under state contract law, and that

3 || state contract law remedy. See Nieto-Santos, 743 F.2d 638 at 641; Arriaga, 305

5 |} Cir.1994) (FLSA does not preempt state contract claims)).

6 This rule aligns with the Supreme Court's holding that a contract that

7 || incorporates federal statutory language does not necessarily create a federal cause
8 || of action; but it does leave such a contract enforceable under state contract law.

9 || Jackson Transit Authority v. Local Division 1285, 457 U.S. 15, 23 - 28 (1982).'. In
10 || Nieto-Santos, the Ninth Circuit applied Jackson Transit to state law claims arising

12 ii. Defendants offer no authority to contradict the settled rule that
workers may enforce H-2A contracts which incorporate terms

13 required under federal regulations

14 Defendants confusingly refer to 8 U.S.C. 0x00A71329 (Ct. Rec. 28 at 7) to argue

15 || that only the DOL, and not workers, can enforce H-2A contracts. But 0x00A7 1329 does
16 || not preclude a private individual from litigating in federal court, so long as another
17 || basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction is present (e.g. 0x00A71331 and $1367). Nor

7 iv. Defendants' Cort v. Ash argument is inapposite, since plaintiffs
have not alleged a private right of action under the H-2A statute
0x00B0 Defendants' assertion that under Cort v. Ash plaintiffs lack a private right of
0x00B0 action to enforce the H-2A statute is inapplicable to this case. (Ct. Rec. 28, 8 - 13).

" This court has subject-matter jurisdiction over all of plaintiffs' claims both
" pursuant to 0x00A71331 because of their federal claims under TVPRA and FLSA, and
" pursuant to 0x00A7 1367 supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims because these
0x00B0 claims are part of the same case or controversy and stem from a common nucleus
" of facts. Defendants' assertions that Congress meant to preclude state-law contract
