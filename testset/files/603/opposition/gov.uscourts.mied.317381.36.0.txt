PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ STATUS UPDATE AND
SUPPORTING DECLARATIONS
I.

The Government’s Motion Should Be Held In Abeyance.
As previously briefed, see Doc #20, Pg ID 136-141, the Government’s

positions in this case have been changing from day to day, and even hour to hour.
Although the Government now asserts that Executive Order 13769 does not apply
to lawful permanent residents, it offers no credible assurance that this voluntary
cessation will be continued in the future.
All that is clear at this point is that the government’s policy will continue to
change: the President stated on February 16, 2017, that “we will be issuing a new
and very comprehensive order to protect our people. And that will be done some

2:17-cv-10310-VAR-SDD Doc # 36 Filed 02/20/17 Pg 2 of 14

Pg ID 358

time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.”1 In the
government’s most recent filing in Ninth Circuit in State of Washington v. Trump,
also dated February 16, 2017, the Government stated, “Rather than continuing this
litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the Order and replace it
with a new, substantially revised Executive Order to eliminate what the panel
erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” [Defendants-Appellants’]
Supplemental Brief on En Banc Consideration, 17-35105 (9th Cir. Feb. 16, 2017),
Dkt Entry 154, p. 16, http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/16/1735105%20-%20Government%20supplemental%20brief.pdf.
The contents of the yet-to-be-issued Executive Order remain unknown, and
therefore any action that this Court might take would likely be superseded by
events very quickly. At the same time, the order issued by the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Washington currently protects the Plaintiffs in this
case.2 Therefore, Plaintiffs believe that the best course of action at this time is to
hold the government’s motion to dissolve the injunction in abeyance. At the
moment, dissolving this Court’s injunction would have no practical effect.
Moreover, as just quoted, the government intends to alter the operative facts
“[r]ather than continuing . . . litigation” in the Ninth Circuit. Indeed, the

As a result of this court’s injunction and the injunction in State of Washington v.
Trump, all of the current individual Plaintiffs have now entered the United States.

Government itself has urged the Ninth Circuit “to hold its consideration of the case
until the President issues the new Order . . . .” Id. Similarly, in a case in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia, the government successfully sought a
stay of the briefing schedule “in light of the President’s intent to rescind the
existing, currently enjoined Executive Order . . . and replace it with a new,
substantially revised version.” [Defendants’] Emergency Motion for Stay of
Existing Deadlines Pending Issuance of a New Executive Order, Pars Equality
Center v. Trump, 1:17-cv-00255-TSC (D.D.C. Feb. 16, 2017) , Dkt Entry 15, p. 5,
https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-DC-0026-0003.pdf.

The

government’s arguments for holding off on proceedings in other cases while events
surrounding the Executive Order unfold apply with equal force here.
The interests of judicial economy also militate against ruling on the
Defendants’ motion to dissolve the injunction. The Court should not expend
resources on Defendants’ motion so long as Judge Robart’s injunction remains in
place. Given the uncertainty about what steps the government will take next and
given that fast-moving developments could easily change the legal issues before
the court from one day to the next (as has already happened in this case and as the
President himself has indicated will happen again soon), this Court would be wise
to hold the motion in abeyance pending further developments and conserve its
resources for such time as its intervention is needed.

In the event that Judge Robart’s injunction is stayed, narrowed, or lifted, or
other events make it necessary for this Court to act, this Court could resume
consideration of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the injunction.
II.

If the Court Does Rule on the Motion, It Should Be Denied
In the event that the Court does decide to rule on Defendants’ motion,

Plaintiffs make the following submissions.
First, as requested by the Court in a February 6, 2017 email from Mr. Willett
and the Order Requiring Plaintiffs to Response to Defendants’ Status Update (Doc.
#35, Pg. ID 356), Plaintiffs file the attached declarations in support of their
Opposition to Motion to Dissolve Injunction (Doc #20, Pg ID 143).
These declarations show that, in light of the government’s changing position
on whether the Executive Order applies to lawful permanent residents, lawful
permanent residents from the banned countries remain unsure whether, if they
leave the United States, they will be able to return. Rula Aoun, director of the Arab
American Civil Rights League explains:
Because the government has repeatedly changed its position about
who can and cannot enter the country, and because the government
has been fighting to reinstate the ban in court, the Arab American
community in Michigan is very unsure about who will and will not
ultimately be covered by the ban. As the result, members of our
community are afraid to travel outside the country, even though many
of them have compelling personal and professional reasons – such as
ill relatives, family weddings and funerals, or business affairs – for
leaving the country temporarily.

Pg ID 361

Aoun Declaration, ¶ 15, Exh. C. Moreover, as Susan Reed, managing attorney of
the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center notes:
Lawful Permanent Residents in my experience tend to have
overwhelming equities in the U.S. and generally have extremely low
tolerance of risk with regard to being excluded or removed from the
U.S.
Reed Declaration, ¶ 18, Exh. A. If this Court were to dissolve the injunction
protecting lawful permanent residents, it would add to the current confusion and
discourage lawful permanent residents from relying on future court rulings for fear
that those protections could be taken away.
Given that many lawful permanent residents have built their lives in the
United States – establishing careers, buying homes, having families – they cannot
risk being denied entry again if they travel abroad. Accordingly, many lawful
permanent residents who have reasons to travel abroad are not doing so because
the government’s ever-changing position on the Executive Order has left them
uncertain whether further changes will occur while they are out of the country. See
Dr. Ahmed Shalabi Declaration, ¶¶ 18-21, Exh. D; Hana Almasmari Declaration,
¶¶ 11-12, Exh. G; Sabah Almasmary, ¶¶ 11-12, Exh. F; Mounira Atik Declaration,
¶¶ 11-12, Exh. E. For example, Dr. Ahmed Shalabi, a surgeon who is a lawful
permanent resident and holds a Sudanese passport, has cancelled trips to Egypt, the
United Arab Emirates, and Canada because of uncertainty surrounding the
Executive Order. Dr. Ahmed Shalabi Declaration, ¶¶ 18-21, Exh. D.

Second, the declarations show that neither the While House Counsel’s
February 1, 2017 memo (on which the government relies to claim mootness) nor
the earlier Department of Homeland Security January 29, 2017 statement that
lawful permanent residents will be “assessed for exceptions as appropriate”3 –
address the complexity of different types of immigration statuses. Michigan
Immigrant Rights’ Center attorney Susan Reed explains that the term “lawful
permanent resident”, as used in those documents, is itself unclear.
Immigrant visa holders are approved to become lawful permanent
residents. However, they do not become lawful permanent residents
(LPRs) until they are admitted to the U.S. If they are not admitted at a
port of entry, they are not lawful permanent residents.
Some immigrant visa holders only have “conditional” permanent
resident (CPR) status after they are admitted. For example, a holder
of a “CR1” immigrant visa will become a conditional resident upon
admission. To become a full LPR, a CPR must have that condition
removed either though the approval a joint petition with his or her
spouse to remove the condition or granting of a waiver of the joint
petition requirement by the Department of Homeland Security.
The Department of Homeland Security stated on January 29, 2017,
that LPRs would be “assessed for exceptions as appropriate”,
suggesting that the Department of Homeland Security believes that
LPRs are covered by the Executive Order but may be granted
exemptions from it. The White House Counsel’s February 1, 2017,
3

Department of Homeland Security, “Fact Sheet: Protecting the Nation From
Foreign Terrorist Entry To the United States,” (Jan. 29, 2017), available at:
https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entryunited-states.
6

2:17-cv-10310-VAR-SDD Doc # 36 Filed 02/20/17 Pg 7 of 14

Pg ID 363

memo acknowledged reasonable confusion but stated that the
Executive Order would not be applied to LPRs. However, the
Department of Homeland Security’s website continues to display their
January 29 statement.
It is unclear whether either the Department of Homeland Security
statement or the White House Counsel’s memorandum relates to
people who hold immigrant visas and will become LPRs or CPRs by
operation of law once they are admitted to the U.S. The Executive
Order specifically names immigrant visa holders, which seems to
indicate a strong intent to apply the travel ban to these pre-admitted
immigrant-visa-holding individuals. There is no other individual who
could be described as holding an immigrant visa. Yet upon entry,
these individuals become LPRs or CPRs.
Neither the Department of Homeland Security statement nor the
White House Counsel’s memorandum specifically discussed people
who are conditional permanent residents, such as individuals holding
“CR1” visas. It is therefore unclear whether the government believes
they are or are not covered by the Executive Order.
Second Reed Declaration, ¶¶ 5-9, Exh. B.
In short, the White House counsel memorandum, while stating that Sections
3(c) and 3(e) of the Executive Order do not apply to “lawful permanent residents”
does not address whether conditional permanent residents (CPRs) are or are not
covered by the Executive Order. Nor does the White House counsel memorandum
address whether that exclusion applies to individuals who were immigrant visa
holders at the time the Executive Order was entered, but have since entered the
country and become lawful permanent residents or conditional permanent residents

by operation of law. See Yusra Alsoufi Declaration, Exh. H; Kokab Algazali
Declaration, Exh. I; Walid Jammoul Declaration, Exh. J.
In short, the very government statements upon which Defendants rely (and
which can be changed at any time and indeed will be changed shortly) do not make
clear who is and is not covered by the Executive Order. Thus (and even before the
White House changes its position again, as the President has announced it will do),
the complexity of immigration law means that there is uncertainty about such basic
questions as, under the most recent governmental interpretation of the Executive
Order, who counts as a “lawful permanent resident”.
Third, Defendants continue to argue that the case is moot in light of the
February 1, 2017 White House Counsel Memo. See Defendants’ Status Update,
Doc. 33, Pg.ID# 348. The Ninth Circuit’s addressed precisely this issue in its
recent decision rejecting the government’s request for a stay of the injunction
against enforcement of the Executive Order that was issued by the United States
District Court for the Western District of Washington:
The Government has argued that, even if lawful permanent residents
have due process rights, the States’ challenge to section 3(c) based on
its application to lawful permanent residents is moot because several
days after the Executive Order was issued, White House counsel
Donald F. McGahn II issued “[a]uthoritative [g]uidance” stating that
sections 3(c) and 3(e) of the Executive Order do not apply to lawful
permanent residents. At this point, however, we cannot rely upon the
Government’s contention that the Executive Order no longer applies
to lawful permanent residents. The Government has offered no
authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to
8

2:17-cv-10310-VAR-SDD Doc # 36 Filed 02/20/17 Pg 9 of 14

Pg ID 365

issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order signed by
the President and now challenged by the States, and that proposition
seems unlikely.
Nor has the Government established that the White House counsel's
interpretation of the Executive Order is binding on all executive
branch officials responsible for enforcing the Executive Order. The
White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in
the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments.
Moreover, in light of the Government's shifting interpretations of the
Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by
White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist
past the immediate stage of these proceedings. On this record,
therefore, we cannot conclude that the Government has shown that it
is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not
reasonably be expected to recur.” Friends of the Earth, Inc., v.
Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145
L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (emphasis added).
Washington v. Trump, __ F.3d __; 2017 WL 526497, at *8 (9th Cir., Feb. 9,
2017).
Finally, Plaintiffs draw the Court’s attention to the inconsistency of the
government’s statements even within the court filings in this case to date. On the
one hand, Defendants argue, under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, that
the Executive Order should be interpreted not to apply to lawful permanent
residents because a contrary interpretation “ignores established law holding that
LPRs are entitled to travel abroad for periods of time without jeopardizing their
lawful status.” Defendants’ Reply In Support Of Their Motion to Dissolve
Injunction, Doc. 22, Pg.ID# 170. On the other hand, Defendants assert that non-

9

2:17-cv-10310-VAR-SDD Doc # 36 Filed 02/20/17 Pg 10 of 14

Pg ID 366

citizens “have no constitutional right to entry.” Defendants’ Opposition to
Plaintiffs’ Request For a Preliminary Injunction, Doc. 26-1, Pg.ID# 266.
Where Defendants cannot even maintain a consistent litigation position
about the legal rights of lawful permanent residents, Defendants cannot meet the
“‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct cannot
reasonably be expected to start up again.” Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189
(quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199, 203
(1968)).
III.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should hold in abeyance the

Defendants’ Motion to Dissolve the Injunction. Once the new Executive Order is
issued, plaintiffs respectfully request that they receive ten days to assess its effect,
and to provide the Court with fuller briefing in support of the existing injunction, if
appropriate.
If the Court does rule on the motion, the motion should be denied. Given
that the Court’s existing injunction order was written at an emergent moment, and
was therefore necessarily quite brief, the Court may wish, with the greater luxury
of time, to:

10

2:17-cv-10310-VAR-SDD Doc # 36 Filed 02/20/17 Pg 11 of 14

Pg ID 367

1) clarify that its order applies to both lawful permanent residents and
conditional permanent residents both prior to and upon entry into the United
States;
2) clarify that its order applies to all immigrant visa holders who have
entered the United States and become lawful permanent residents or conditional
permanent residents since the Executive Order was announced;
3) specifically state that, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 65(d)(2), its order
binds the parties; the parties’ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys;
and other persons who are in active concert or participation with them; and
4) more fully explain the Court’s reasoning in accordance with Fed. R. Civ.
P. 65.
