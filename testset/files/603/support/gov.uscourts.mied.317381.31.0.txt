SOUTHERN DIVISION
ARAB AMERICAN CIVIL
RIGHTS LEAGUE, et al.,
Plaintiffs,

Civil No. 17-10310
Hon. VICTORIA A. ROBERTS
Mag. Judge Stephanie D. Davis

v.
DONALD TRUMP, et al.,

____________________________________/
MOTION TO FILE STATUS UPDATE
In response to the Court’s recent communications, Defendants, by and
through counsel, respectfully request permission to file a status update with this
Court on Monday, February 13, 2017, and additionally request the Court defer ruling
on Defendants’ pending Motion to Dissolve Injunction and Amend Order Regarding
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order until such time as Defendants
have updated the Court on their position in light of recent developments. Defendants
are currently assessing the impact of the Ninth Circuit’s decision issued last night in
Washington v. Trump, as well as other developments nationwide, on Defendants’
position in this litigation. Without additional time to confer with our clients
regarding these matters, undersigned counsel will not be able to adequately address

the Court’s inquiries. Defendants intend to update the Court on Monday regarding
Defendants’ position and beg this Court’s indulgence to (1) authorize such a filing
and (2) to hold off ruling on the pending matter until such time as Defendants are
able to file their update with this Court. Given the current nationwide order
enjoining the enforcement of the Executive Order, Defendants believe the delay will
not prejudice the parties or the Court.
Pursuant to EDMI Local Rule 7.1, Government counsel sought concurrence
with opposing counsel. Opposing counsel consented to the filing of a status update.

Dated: February 10, 2017
