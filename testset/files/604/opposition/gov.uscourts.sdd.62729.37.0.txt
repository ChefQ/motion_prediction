and For

Special Appearance as fraudulently based. This OPPOSITION Brief and motion to strike is

UNDISPUTED FACTS UNDERLYING THIS BRIEF

Plaintiff HOLLI carried on service communications in this matter with the South

Dakota Dept. of Insurance both by phone and via email with the Department's purported
Counsel, Clayton Grueb, Dec. HOLLI, para. 1.

Attorney for American National Property and Casualty Insurance "ANPAC" in this
matter, Gregory John Sperlich, has filed false and deceptive papers identified as a motion to
vacate a default entered against ANPAC and a special appearance motion, both constituting
1

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 2 of 9 PageID #: 266

RICO instruments, and for which PETITIONS Plaintiffs OPPOSE and seek to STRIKE. Dec.
HOLLl, para. 2.

ANPAC's statutory agent of service, the Director of the Division of Insurance, Larry
Deiterwas served with 2 copies of the summons, 2 copies of the First Amended Complaint,
2 copies of admissions to service by mail referred to in my email communications to Clayton
Grueb as the "two returns I also sent you", see Doc. 32-2, PagelD #: 240, an instruction
letter and a $10 administrative fee which was cashed by my bank. The foregoing documents

were attached to Attorney Sperlich's affidavit and memorandum to vacate the default. Dec.
HOLLl, para. 3.

In the same affidavit of Attorney Sperlich, Sperlich provides a judicial admission

that Plaintiffs properly served the Dept. of Insurance Director via mail and that the Dept

admitted service by mall at: Doc. 32-2, PagelD #: 239, first paragraph. In this same first
paragraph at: Doc. 32-2, PagelD #: 239, the Department's counsel GRUEB also admitted
that the letter produced at Doc. 32-1 was a fraud upon this court in the following
statement:

I must apologize for my embarrassing oversight. You are correct and there
were two copies of the summons and complaint in your mailing. The Division
has admitted service and is forwarding the summons and complaint to
American National and Property Casualty Ins. Co. today.
Dec. HOLLl, para. 4.

Attorney GRUEB's emailed admission of proper service came AFTER Plaintiff
HOLLl told Attorney GRUEB that the mailed service to the Director of Insurance had been

taped, that HOLLl had three witnesses to the mailing, Doc. 32-2, PagelD #: 240, and AFTER
HOLLl had filed still shots of Plaintiffs services on the remainder private party defendants

into the court's record (the latter defendants who falsely claimed that they were served with

the original 16 page complaint in this matter as opposed too the First Amended Complaint
comprising of 88 pages.). Dec. HOLLl, para. 5.

Attorney Sperlich falsely indicates that the emails between HOLLl and department

attorney GRUEB were dated between the dates of December 13, 2017 to December 17,
2017. In fact these emails were dated between December 15, 2017 to December 17, 2017 as

shown by Sperlich's Doc. 32-2. Dec. HOLLl, para. 6.

There has been no changes in the service procedures that Plaintiffs employed

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 267

upon the South Dakota Insurance Director re ANPAC on November 28, 2017 when Plaintiffs
process server effected initial service, and the date Dept. of Insurance employee Eva Briggs
admitted service in her December 18, 2017 letter issued to correct the fraud committed
In GRUEB's December 13, 2017 letter at PagelD #: 237.

Accordingly, service was

admitted upon receipt of Plaintiffs process in November of 2017 by the Director, Larry Deiter.
Furthermore, there is no statutory provision that allows the Department of Insurance for
South Dakota as the statutory agent for ANPAC, to withhold service of court process for
three weeks before effecting service on the principal defendant. Dec. HOLLI, para. 7.

More importantly, Attorney Sperlich has intentionally omitted evidence from his
affidavit that Plaintiff HOLLI expressly notified GRUEB once the service fraud by tGRUEB
had been uncovered, that Plaintiffs were not agreeing to extend service. See exhibit "1"
attached to Dec. of Holli. Accordingly GRUEB had direct knowledge that Plaintiffs intended

to apply for default in this matter on December 19, 2017. Plaintiffs motion for default was
filed on December 28, 2017, ten days AFTER ANPAC was in default upon service to her
statutory agent, director Larry Deiter. Dec. HOLLI, para. 8.

Attorney Sperlich's fraud offenses do not stop here. Attorney Sperlich is correct in
asserting that he needs to prove the following elements to avoid the default on behalf of
ANPAC, to wit: (1) whether the conduct of the defaulting party was blameworthy or culpable.
(2) whether the defaulting party has a meritorious defense, and (3) whether the other party
would be prejudiced if the default were excused". Stephenson v. El-Batrawi, 524 F.3d 907 (8th
Cir. 2008). Dec. HOLLI, para. 9.

Attorney Sperlich asserts in his memo supporting ANPAC's motion to vacate the
default that because Plaintiff HOLLI knew that the Department had not yet served ANPAC,

that this somehow excuses ANPAC's default. PagelD #: 247.

Plaintiffs disagree.

IT IS

CLEAR FROM ALL OF THE EVIDENCE ATTACHED TO SPERLICH's affidavit that Director

Deiter and his employees sought to conspire with ANPAC to deprive Plaintiffs of jurisdiction
over their federal claims, including a RICO claim, in the state of South Dakota. HOLLI even

threatened to add department officials and GRUEB to Plaintiffs RICO complaint because of
this conspiracy. See Doc. 32-2, PagelD #: 238. ANPAC was part of this conspiracy to

obstruct justice in this forum based on service fraud and using the wires to defraud Plaintiffs
of their causes of action, the latter which constitutes RICO property. See Logan v.
Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422(1982)(a Cause of action is a species of property

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 268

protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. [Footnote 4]); DECK v.
ENGINEERED LAMINATES, 349 F.3d 1253 (2003)(RICO claim stated where the defendant

sought to extinguish a cause of action against them through RICO predicate acts.). It is also
well established that a defendant is committed by the acts of it's agents. Dec. HOLLI, para. 10.

Accordingly, since service was properly effected on November 28, 2017 on
ANPAC's statutory agent, then ANPAC was required to respond by December 19, 2017 and
Plaintiffs should not be held at fault for the defendants conspiratorial acts to obstruct

jurisdiction in this forum by service fraud and in employing the wires to effect this fraud.
Moreover, this court should not sustain the defendant's fraud by granting ANPAC's motion to

vacate and thus setting precedent for any insurance company to avoid prosecution by simply
conspiring with Department of Insurance employees to effectively reject service when all
protocols were followed. Dec. HOLLI, para. 11.
ANPAC then states at PagelD # 247 that the court is required to consider

prejudice to the Plaintiffs when vacating a default and has surreptiously continued ANPAC's
response date to January 8, 2017. Plaintiffs contend that the attempted scheme to commit
service fraud by denying what was actually served on the director on November 28, 2017
and thereby artificially inflate the time to respond; has severely prejudiced Plaintiff HOLLI
because ANPAC has not reinstated HOLLI's auto insurance policy under its original terms

and has thereby forced HOLLI to secure other avenues of transportation to protect against
4^^ amendment seizures given HOLLI cannot afford the quadruple insurance rates she would
now be forced to pay as a result of ANPAC's illegal lapse of her auto policy. Hence
ANPAC's fraudulently concocted delay is and was clearly prejudicial. Dec. HOLLI, para. 12.
In addition, ANPAC's service fraud follows suit with the service fraud committed by

the remainder defendants as previously identified by Plaintiffs in their r several petitions for a

contempt hearing against the other defendants. It is undisputed that all defendants in this
matter have lied to this court about what documents they were served in order to avoid

this court's jurisdiction over their persons. Moreover, ANPAC has furthered this fraud in
her motion to vacate the default by fraudulently advancing a service defect under FRCP rule
4(d) which ANPAC's own evidence recorded into this record by wire, shows was false as the
Director of Insurance ADMITTED TO SERVICE ALIBIET THREE WEEKS AFTER THAT
ADMISSION ACTUALLY OCCURRED. The filing of documents agreeing to admission of

service (albiet fraudulently late) defeats and MOOTS the subsequent special appearance

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 269

motion made by ANPAC's counsel Sperlich, at least in regards to the persona! jurisdiction
issue. See Commercial Gas. Ins. Co. v. Consolidated Stone Co., 278 U.S. 177 (1929) (a
Defendant may make a voluntary appearance by

affirmative conduct before the court);

"Actions of the defendant may amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court,
whether voluntary or not." Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59 (1938); Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S.
352, 356 (1927)("Challenges to personal jurisdiction or venue may be waived by either

express or implied conduct); Quenzer v. Quenzer, 653 R2d 295 (Wyo. 1982)(once made, a
general appearance may not be revoked by subsequent actions of filing a Notice of Nonparticipation citing Weaver Construction Company v. District Court in and for El Paso County,
4th Judicial District, 190 Colo. 227, 545 P.2d 1042(1976)). Hence in regard to filing an
attack re personal jurisdiction over ANPAC, this defense has now been waived by
ANPAC. Dec. HOLLl, para. 13.

Furthermore, contrary to ANPAC's contentions, ANPAC does not have meritorious
defenses under a purported "lack of subject matter jurisdiction defense."

Plaintiffs federal

claims against ANPAC include violations of: the Federal Racketeering Act, "RICO", 18 USC
section 1961, et seq.; the Electronic Funds Transfers Act, 15 U.S. Code § 1693, and the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S. Code § 1691. (See pg. 1 of FAC). ANPAC only addresses one
of these claims, i.e.

the Electronic Funds Transfers Act, 15 U.S. Code § 1693 to support a

fraudulent assertion that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.
See PagelD #: 247-248 where ANPAC argues:
ANPAC is an insurance company and cannot be in violation of the
Electronic Funds Transfers Act which only applies to financial institutions
which are defined as state or national banks, state or federal savings and loan
associations, mutual savings banks, credit unions, or any person who holds
an account belonging to a consumer. 12 C.F.R. 205.3(a). ANPAC.. .[is not a
financial institution] . . . nor does ANPAC have access to a device to permit a
consumer to initiate electronic funds transfers as required by 12 C.F.R. 205.2(a)
(1)(defining an access device). See Dec. HOLLl, para. 14.
First and foremost, ANPAC is defined as a financial institution under 31 U.S. Code §

5312(a)(2)(M) as shown in exhibit "2" attached to Dec. of HOLLl. Second access to a device
to permit a consumer to initiate electronic funds transfers. . . also includes an agreement
constituting the access device. See 12 CFR§ 205.2. Definitions.

For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
(a) (1 )Access device means a card, code, or other means of access

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 270

to a consumer's account, or any combination thereof, that may be

used by the consumer to initiate electronic fund transfers.
(2) An access device becomes an accepted access device when the
consumer: (1) Requests and receives, or signs, or uses (or authorizes
another to use) the access device to transfer money between accounts
or to obtain money, property, or services.
In this action, HOLLI admitted that she signed an agreement to allow ANPAC

to transfer specified amounts of money from her bank account to ANPAC's bank account in
return for insurance services. See allegations of the FAC:

para. 29 of the FAC reads;

Upon HOLLI agreeing to the premium amounts to be charged for homeowner's
coverage, automobile coverage and trailer coverage, HOLLI agreed to automatic
withdrawals from her credit card account of no more than $82.07 per month for all

of these coverages commencing April 8, 2017. An ANPAC agent sent HOLLI
notice of the monthly autopay amounts to be withdrawn from her credit card
account. See exhibit "7" attached. Dec. HOLLI, para. 15.
Exhibit "7" attached to the FAC IS ANPAC'S ADMISSION OF AN ACEPTED

ACCESS DEVICE. Dec. HOLLI, para. 16.

Moreover, ANPAC's liability under the EFTA in spite of ANPAC's identification

as a financial institution under the banking code (ex. "2" attached to Dec. of HOLLI) is further
established under the EFTA as. . . any person who holds an account belonging to a

consumer. 12 C.F.R. 205.3(a). There is no question that ANPAC held an insurance risk
account in HOLLI's favor. Moreover, other federal court's have identified persons within the

meaning of the EFTA

to Include fitness companies who enter into contracts with

consumers, see exhibit "3" attached, Wendorf v. Landers, 755 F. Supp. 2d 972(N.D. III. 2010);
Friedman v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc., 580 F. Supp. 2d 985 (C.D. Cal. 2008)(RICO claim

and EFTA claim sustainable against defendant; the latter as Plaintiffs' claim arises under
section 1693m, which provides for civil liability as against persons other than financial
institutions. See 15 U.S.C. § 1693m ("Except as otherwise provided, any person who fails to
comply...")): to Include Internet companies and their telemarketers, see Wike v. Vertrue,
Inc., 566 F.3d 590 (5th Cir. 2009), see material portions attached hereto as exhibit "4"; Terry
Johnson v. West Suburban Bank Tele-Cash Inc. County Bank of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware

Tele-Cash Inc. County Bank of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, 225 F.3d 366 (3^^ Cir. 2000)
(EFTA applies to companies loaning monies.) . . .and other entities as set out by federal
authorities and which Holli will not attach to stay within the 25 page limitation rule of this court.
6

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 7 of 9 PageID #: 271

HENCE ANPAC HAS DELIBERATELY AND FRAUDULENTLY REPRESENTED TO THIS
COURT THAT THE EFTA HAS NO APPLICATION TO ANPAC. THIS ONGOING FRAUD

DESERVES TO BE TREATED HARSHLY BY THIS COURT AS AN EFFORT TO DEPRIVE
PLAINTIFF HOLLI OF HER CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST ANPAC. .

In addition, that ANPAC committed material violations of the EFTA by failing to

obtain HOLLI's written consent authorizing alteration to the terms of

HOLLI's

EFTA

agreement with ANPAC is further set out in Plaintiff's FAC:
Para. 34 of the FAC reads:

ANPAC deceptively and fraudulently unilaterally canceled HOLLI's auto and
trailer policies without HOLLI's written consent as required under both the
Electronic Funds Transfers Act access device agreement and the insurance

policies, and also failed to give HOLLI written notice of these cancellations as
required under the insurance policies and regulations promulgated generally by
state insurance commissions. To further coverup their deception, ANPAC

reduced the premium amounts automatically withdrawn from HOLLI's bank
account to approximately $73 per month which were the originally agreed
coupled insurance premiums for both the homeowners insurance and the
insurance on two motorized vehicles. Hence when this corrected premium was

collected from HOLLI's bank account In August of 2017, HOLLI was deceived
into believing that ANPAC had partially corrected the electronic funds transfer
issues on all insured properties except her trailer. HOLLI would learn

approximately three weeks later when reporting malicious vandalism on her car
which occurred on the park's premises, that ANPAC had doubled HOLLI's
homeowners insurance premium without HOLLI's consent and unilaterally
lapsed HOLLI's auto and trailer policies; to thereby (1) defeat any
comprehensive coverage for the vandalism on her 1998 honda civic, (2) to

prevent HOLLI from obtaining like coverage from another insurer due to the
reported lapse without paying quadruple premiums for the same coverage, (3)
to prevent HOLLI from insuring additional vehicles on her policies, (4) to put
HOLLI at risk of 4'^ amendment seizure and Imprisonment for driving without
insurance, and (5) to cause other collateral injuries associated with the loss of
insurance.

Dec. HOLLI, para. 17.

Finally, in attacking this court's subject matter jurisdiction, ANPAC makes no
mention of Plaintiffs RICO claims against ANPAC.
Para. 32 of the FAC reads:

This action sues ANPAC for racketeering conduct re overcharges in HOLLI's
insurance premiums, for diminishing the value of at issue insured properties
covered to -0- without HOLLI's written consent and knowledge in order to aid and
abet an illegal abandonment scheme exercised by the OASIS defendants.
A number of federal courts have found that inflating insurance premiums over

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 272

market rate will justify a RICO claim when the premiums are paid by mail or wire.

See

Dornberger v. Metropolitan Life Ins., 961 F.Supp. 506, 523 {S.D.N.Y.1997) (finding a RICO
injury because plaintiff "was fraudulently induced to pay premiums for services she did not
receive but she bargained for/);

Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1259 (11th Cir. 2004)

(physicians had contracted with defendants to receive reimbursement for medical services,
but defendants engaged in a scheme to underpay plaintiffs' reimbursements when compared
to other market rates). Cannon v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. C-12-1376, 2014 WL 324556,
at *3 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 29, 2014) (Finding RICO violation properly alleged where bank was
accused of charging insurance premiums that were two times the market rate.) Chattanooga
Foundry & Pipe Works v. City of Atlanta, 203 U.S. 390, 396, 27 S.Ct. 65, 51 L.Ed. 241 (1906)
("[The city] was injured in its property, at least ... by being led to pay more than the worth of
the pipe.");

Neff v. Provident Life and Accident Insurance, 2:14-cv-06696-MMB (E.D. PA,

2014) (Atty sued for theft of attorney fees provided under contract for the settlement of
insurance claims, using RICO). See ex. "5" attached for RICO conviction for overcharge acts.
Dec. HOLLl, para. 18.
Finally under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, ANPAC unilaterally lapsed Plaintiffs
auto policies under a false theory that Plaintiff HOLLl had not paid her premiums. HOLLl
made numerous demands upon ANPAC to correct this corrupt conduct. Given the accepted
access device agreement HOLLl tendered to ANPAC to pay only the agreed contracted rate
of insurance on her auto policies was HOLLI's timely tender of payment and HOLLl holds no
responsibility for ANPAC manipulating that access agreement for transfer of payments, it is
undisputed that ANPAC fabricated a basis for falsely reporting HOLLI's credit worthiness.
HOLLl has therefore clearly stated FCRA claims against ANPAC thereby making ANPAC's
special appearance motion purporting to attack this court's subject matter jurisdiction, yet
another act of fraud upon this court

as well as a RICO instrument recorded by wire

with this court to obstruct the due administration of justice.
ARGUMENT

ANPAC admits that where setting aside the default would prejudice the plaintiff

by way of permitting fraud and collusion to "win the day",
aside.

the default should not be set

Berthelsen v. Kane, 907 F.2d 617, 621 (6th Cir. 1990). Given the record clearly

shows that ANPAC first attempted to commit service fraud through a conspiracy with

8

Case 5:17-cv-05088-JLV Document 37 Filed 01/05/18 Page 9 of 9 PageID #: 273

Department officials to deny what process ANPAC was truly served, and then ANPAC later
attempted to commit personal and subject matter jurisdiction fraud by both intentionally
misstating the facts and laws with respect to the matters before this court through counsel
SPERLICH, this court should not condone that criminal behavior by vacating the default
which Plaintiffs had every right to systematically pursue and even gave ANPAC notice that
that Plaintiffs intended to pursue through ANPAC's statutory agent's attorney GRUEB. Refer
back to exhibit "1" attached.

Based on the foregoing, ANPAC is cuplable for the acts of its agent; , ANPAC has

prejudiced PLAINTIFFS by way of failure to timely appear and by introducing fraud and
collusion into their defense of this case,

and ANPAC

HAS NOT PRESENTED ANY

MERITORIOUS DEFENSE TO THE FEDERAL CLAIMS ALLEGED AGAINST THEM IN THE

FAC. Accordingly this court should not bless ANPAC's criminal malfeasance by allowing
them to vacate the default that was properly entered against ANPAC.

In addition, since Plaintiffs have adequately shown that ANPAC's Motion to vacate

the Default and Motion to specially appear are fraudulent instruments wired into this court's
record, these petitions should be stricken as an offense to the due administration of justice,
the default should prevail, and Plaintiffs claims should be sent to a jury for a determination of
damages.
