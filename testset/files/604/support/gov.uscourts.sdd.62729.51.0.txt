AMERICAN NATIONAL PROPERTY
& CASUALTY’S MEMORANDUM IN
SUPPORT OF ANPAC’S REPLY TO
PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION BRIEF
AND JOINED MOTION TO STRIKE
[DOC. 37]

Defendant, American National Property and Casualty Insurance Co.
(“ANPAC”) hereby files this reply to the Plaintiff’s Opposition Brief and Joined
Motion to Strike as well as the Declaration of Telford [Doc. 37 and Doc. 38].
Telford asserts that a number of facts are undisputed as it relates to the
Motion to Set Aside Default [Doc. 37, p 1]. How Telford and Noble come to the
conclusion that these facts are undisputed is not explained. Furthermore, a
statement of undisputed material facts is not attached. Plaintiffs assert that in
addition to two copies of the Summons, two copies of the First Amended
Complaint, two copies of Admission of Service, an instruction letter and a
$10.00 Administrative Fee were sent to the Division of Insurance. The Division
1

of Insurance was unsure what to do with the Summons since, according to
them, no instructional letter accompanied the Summons and Complaint [Doc.
33-1]. Throughout the opposition brief Telford and Noble assert a conspiracy
between the South Dakota Division of Insurance and ANPAC. For instance, it
is asserted “IT IS CLEAR FROM ALL OF THE EVIDENCE ATTACHED TO
SPERLICH’S affidavit that director Deiter and his employees sought to conspire
with ANPAC to deprive Plaintiffs of jurisdiction over their federal claims
including a RICO claim, in the State of South Dakota” [Doc. 37, p. 3]. Telford
and Noble provide no support whatsoever for the assertion that there was some
conspiracy between the Division of Insurance and ANPAC. As the emails
between Telford and Attorney Grueb, for the Division, make clear the Division
was unsure what to do with the Summons and Complaints that they had
received from Telford and wrote to clarify [Doc. 32-1]
Later Telford and Noble continue to assert a conspiracy between the
South Dakota Division of Insurance and ANPAC claiming that the court should
not condone fraud by granting the motion to vacate which would allow
insurance companies to avoid prosecution by conspiring with Department of
Insurance employees to reject service [Doc. 37, p. 4]. No facts are offered to
support this conclusion either.
Plaintiffs have entitled this a Motion to Strike. They do not assert why
either the Motion to Set Aside or the Notice of Special Appearance are
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous. A motion to strike under
Rule 12(f) only allows the Court to strike for these reasons. A motion to strike
2

is “an extreme measure” and are viewed with disfavor and infrequently granted
in the 8th Circuit. EEOC v. Product Fabricators, Inc., 873 F.Supp. 1093, 1097
(D.C. Minn. 2012), citing Stanbury Law Firm P.A. v. Internal Revenue Service,
221 F.3d 1059, 1063 (8th Cir. 2000).
It seems the parties agree that the proper test regarding a motion to set
aside default is 1) the conduct of the defaulting party was blameworthy or
culpable; 2) whether the defaulting party had a meritorious defense; and 3)
whether the other party would be prejudiced if the default were excused.
Stevenson v. El-Batrawi, 524 F.3d 907 (8th Cir. 2008) [Doc. 37, p. 3]. Telford
and Noble point to no conduct of ANPAC that is blameworthy or culpable. The
8th Circuit focuses heavily on the blameworthiness of the defaulting party.
Johnson v. Dayton Elec. Mfg.Co., 140 F.3d 781, 784 (8th Cir. 1998). Indeed, the
day after the clerk entered default [Doc. 29] ANPAC filed a Motion and
Memorandum and Affidavit to Set Aside Default [Docs. 31, 32, 33]. Plaintiffs
appear to argue that the Division of Insurance’s failure to forward the
Summons and Complaint to ANPAC’s Registered Agent is somehow attributable
to ANPAC, hence all the unsupported references to a conspiracy between the
division and ANPAC. The Plaintiffs can point to no fact that ANPAC was 1)
provided notice of the suit until December 18th and 2) aware of or complicit
with the actions of the Division of Insurance prior to that date.
Plaintiffs assert that ANPAC does not have a meritorious defense as is
required to set aside the clerk’s entry of default. Plaintiffs then go on to cite a
number of claims made against ANPAC. [Doc. 37, p. 5]. Included in these
3

asserted claims is the Fair Credit Reporting Act. A review of the Plaintiffs’ ‘First
Amended Complaint demonstrates that the Fair Credit Reporting Act is only
brought against the “Oasis” defendants. [Doc. 8, ¶66]. Plaintiffs go on to say
that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, ANPAC unilaterally lapsed Plaintiffs’
auto policies [Doc.37, p. 8]. No such allegation is made in the complaint. The
only reference to the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the Complaint is in paragraph
66 of the Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint [Doc. 8, ¶66].
To determine whether a defaulted defendant has a meritorious defense,
the “likelihood of success is not the measure…rather, if any defense relied
upon states of defense good at law, then a meritorious defense has been
advanced. INVIST FINANCIAL GROUP, INC V. CHEM-NUCLEAR SYSTEMS,
INC, 815 F.2D 391, 398, 399 (6TH CIR. 1987), United Coin Meter Company, Inc.
v. Seaboard Coastline Railroad, 705 F.2d 839, 845 (6th Cir. 1983).
Furthermore, a defense is sufficient if it contains, “even a hint of a suggestion
which, proven at trial, would constitute a complete defense.” Kegel v. Key West
and Caribbean Trading Company, Inc., 627 F.2d 372, 374 (United States’ Court
of Appeals DC 1980). ANPAC has pointed out that the EFTA has no application
here. Further, ANPAC has no relationship with Noble. ANPAC insured no
property in Utah. Indeed, ANPAC only insured a home and automobiles in
Idaho [Doc. 42 attachment “1”].
Plaintiffs argue that ANPAC somehow admits that by setting aside default
would permit fraud and collusion to “win the day” and they cite Berthelsen v.
Kane, 907 Fd.2 617, 621 (6th Cir. 1990) [Doc. 37, p. 8]. In Berthelson the
4

District Court entered a default judgment against the Defendant but the Court
of Appeals reversed and found that even though the Defendant had willfully
evaded service of process the fact that the Defendant had meritorious defenses
and that the Plaintiff failed to show that he would be prejudiced by reopening
the case, the matter was reversed. Plaintiffs argue that undersigned counsel
ANPAC and the Division of Insurance acted criminally in arguing their case to
the court. With no facts in support of her allegations she alleges that ANPAC
entered into a conspiracy with the Division to deny service of process. [Doc. 37,
p. 8-9].
Plaintiffs then allege as to the requirement that the court show that the
court be convinced that the Plaintiff was prejudiced by the delay that their auto
insurance policy was not reinstated. In this case the time elapsed is a mere
matter of weeks. Plaintiffs do not address ANPAC’s arguments that no
discovery has been taken, that no depositions have been engaged in and that
none of the parties have even yet to answer the complaint. The Plaintiffs do not
cite to any concrete disadvantage that they find themselves in in the lawsuit.
The fact that ANPAC may have at some point prior to the events of the filing of
this suit cancelled insurance on one of the Plaintiffs does not prejudice the
Plaintiff in this lawsuit. Here the Plaintiff must show that the delay results in
some kind of prejudice in the lawsuit, such as the loss of evidence or
difficulties in discovery. Berthelson v. Kane, 907 F.2d 617, 621 (6th Cir. 1990).
The Plaintiffs need to show prejudice to their lawsuit. The proper
standard is whether the Plaintiffs’ claim or the ability to pursue the claim will
5

be hindered. TCI Group Life Insurance Plan v. Knoebber, 244 F.3d 691, 601 (9th
Cir. 2001) citing Falk v. Allen, 739 F2d 461. 463 (9th Cir. 1984). They cannot do
so.
CONCLUSION
ANPAC’s conduct relating to the default was neither blameworthy nor
culpable. ANPAC moved swiftly to set aside the clerk’s entry of default. ANPAC
has asserted meritorious defenses to the Plaintiffs’ claims and the Plaintiffs
cannot show that they would be prejudiced in their lawsuit if the default were
set aside.
