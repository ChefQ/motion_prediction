Criminal No. 12-40026-WGY

GOVERNMENT’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO SEVER COUNTS
AND RACKETEERING/OVERT ACTS
On October 16, 2013, Judge F. Dennis Saylor, IV ordered the parties in the abovereferenced case to file all substantive, pre-trial motions – including any motions to sever – by
October 30, 2013. See Docket Entry 146. On or about that date, each of the defendants filed
motions under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (“Rule”) 14 to sever the case as to their codefendants on the grounds that a joint trial would violate their rights under the Confrontation
Clause of the Sixth Amendment. See Docket Nos. 164, 168 and 179. Judge Saylor denied the
defendants’ motions for severance on January 9, 2014 and issued a written order to that effect on
January 17, 2014. See Docket Nos. 215, 227. Neither Judge Saylor, nor this Court, extended the
deadline for filing new substantive motions.
Nonetheless, on March 21, 2014, nearly five months after the filing deadline set by Judge
Saylor and six weeks prior to trial, the defendants filed a second motion for severance in this
case. This time, the defendants claim that the racketeering acts (“RAs”) and counts related to the
electronic monitoring (“ELMO”) hires are misjoined under Rule 8(a) and should be severed

under Rule 14 to avoid unfair prejudice.1 The defendants’ untimely motion should be denied for
the following reasons:
(1) The defendants have waived their severance claims under Rule 12(e) because they
failed to raise them by October 30, 2013, the pre-trial motion deadline set by the
district court;
(2) The ELMO RAs and counts are not misjoined because they are part of a pattern of
racketeering activity committed in furtherance of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy
charged in Counts One and Two of the Indictment; thus, they are “connected with or
constitute parts of a common scheme or plan” pursuant to Rule 8(a);
(3) Since joinder of the ELMO RAs and counts is proper, the defendants have not and
cannot make a strong and convincing showing of prejudice warranting severance
under Rule 14; and
(4) The defendants’ motion to sever the ELMO RAs amounts to an impermissible motion
to exclude evidence of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy charged in Counts One
and Two of the Indictment.
I.

Second Superseding Indictment

The thirty-count, Second Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) charges three defendants
with at least one of seven state and federal crimes. For purposes of this response, the Indictment
is summarized in the following chart. As illustrated therein, evidence regarding the 18 ELMO
hires is relevant (and necessary) to establish: (1) the RICO conspiracy charged in Count One, (2)
multiple RAs, all of which help to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity with respect to
the substantive RICO violation charged in Count Two; and (3) the conspiracy to commit bribery
concerning federal funds charged in Count 13.

1

There are 41 different hires involved in this case - twenty-three permanent hires and 18
temporary ELMO hires. All but one of those hires form the basis of at least one RA. Some of
those hires (all of which are RAs) also form the basis of a substantive count in the Indictment.
See Summary of Indictment, infra at Section I, and Indictment Hiring Chart, attached hereto as
Exhibit A.

Argument
A. The Defendants Have Waived Their Severance Claims Under Rule 12(e)
Because They Failed To Raise Those Claims By The Pre-trial Motion
Deadline
As a threshold matter, the defendants have waived their severance arguments by failing to

raise them on or before October 30, 2013, the pre-trial motion deadline set by the district court.
Pursuant to Rules 12(b)(3) and 12(e), a party “waives” any Rule 14 motion to sever charges if it
is not made by the motion deadline the court sets under Rule 12(c). Rule 12(e) states,
A party waives any Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request not
raised by the deadline the court sets under Rule 12(c) or by any
extension the court provides. For good cause, the court may grant
relief from the waiver.
2

Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e). See United States v. Lugo Guerrero, 524 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 2008)
(defendant waived his Miranda claim by raising it two and one-half months after the pre-trial
motion deadline set by the district court because “when a district court sets a deadline for pretrial motions pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(c), a party's failure to make
certain motions . . . by that deadline constitutes a waiver . . .”). A defendant may only obtain
relief from such waiver by showing “good cause” for his failure to file a timely Rule 12(b)(3)
motion. See id.
Here, the former trial judge set a substantive motion deadline of October 30, 2013. See
2

Rule 12(b)(3) expressly includes “a Rule 14 motion to sever charges or defendants.” Fed.
Rule Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(D).
4

Case 4:12-cr-40026-WGY Document 314 Filed 03/31/14 Page 5 of 12

Docket Entry 146. On or about that date, all three defendants filed motions to sever arguing,
under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), that a joint trial would violate their rights
3

under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. See Docket Nos. 164, 168 and 179.

No defendant moved to sever charges (or RAs) from the Indictment on the basis of misjoinder –
as they have here. See id. On January 9, 2014, the former trial judge denied the defendants’
motions for severance and, on January 17, 2014, issued an order to that effect. See Docket Nos.
215, 227. The defendants did not seek to supplement their severance motions; nor did the former
trial judge extend the pre-trial motion deadline. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 12(e), the
defendants have waived their newly raised severance claims unless they can establish “good
cause” for failing to raise those claims in a timely matter.
The defendants have not (and cannot) establish any cause, let alone “good cause” for
their failure. The Indictment has not changed since August 21, 2013. If the defendants believed
the ELMO counts were misjoined under Rule 8(a), requiring severance under Rule 14, there is
no reason they could not have raised this issue by the substantive motion deadline. While the
defendants do not address “waiver” in their motion (and thus make no express attempt to
establish “good cause”), they argue that the motion was prompted by this Court’s direction to
streamline the case for trial. See Defendant’s Motion at 1. Be that as it may, that explanation
does not establish “good cause” for the defendants’ failure to raise their severance claims in a
timely manner. While this Court has directed the parties to streamline the case, it has not
extended the deadline for defendants to file new substantive motions, i.e., a motion to suppress
evidence, or a motion to dismiss or sever on new grounds. Accordingly, the defendants’
severance claims are waived and their motion should be denied on that ground.
3

The defendants also filed a timely, joint motion to dismiss the indictment which was denied
by the district court on January 9, 2014.

B. The ELMO RAs And Counts Are Properly Joined Under Rule 8(a) Because
They Are Predicate Acts Committed In Furtherance Of The Charged RICO
Enterprise And Conspiracy
The ELMO RAs and counts are properly joined under Rule 8(a) because they are part of the
pattern of racketeering activity alleged in support of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy charged
in Counts One and Two of the Indictment. Rule 8(a) states, in relevant part: “The indictment . . .
may charge a defendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged . . . are
4

connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). It is
well established that “offenses committed pursuant to the same (charged) racketeering enterprise
and conspiracy may be joined in a single indictment since, in the terminology of Rule 8(a), they
are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a
common scheme or plan.” United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (internal
quotations omitted) (citing cases); see also United States v. Balta, 236 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2001)
(defendant’s offense of conviction was properly joined with RICO charges because the offense
was also charged as a racketeering act in furtherance of the alleged RICO enterprise and
conspiracy); United States v. Boidi, 2006 WL 456004 at *3 (D. Mass. 2006) (O’Toole, J.)
(joinder is proper under Rule 8(a) where alleged offenses are all part of a unitary pattern of
5

racketeering activity).

4

As a threshold matter, Rule 8(a) does not apply to RAs or overt acts that are charged as part
of a single racketeering or conspiracy count in an indictment. The Rule’s plain language permits
the government to join common offenses in “separate counts” of an indictment; it says nothing
about the joinder of RAs or overt acts charged as part of a single substantive count. Thus, while
Rule 8(a) may apply, in theory, to defendants’ argument that the ELMO counts are misjoined, it
does not apply to their similar claim regarding the ELMO RAs.
5

Likewise, it is well established that the joinder of defendants under Rule 8(b) is proper
where a single RICO count embraces all of the acts and transactions upon which the other counts
are based. See United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 245 (1st Cir. 1990) (“So long as there is a
responsible basis for the averments, charging an omnibus RICO conspiracy normally supplies
6

Case 4:12-cr-40026-WGY Document 314 Filed 03/31/14 Page 7 of 12

Reading the defendants’ motion, one would think that the Indictment alleged neither RICO
violations nor a conspiracy. In fact, in the nearly four pages devoted to misjoinder in their
motion, the defendants ignore the fact that the ELMO RAs (and corresponding substantive
counts) are charged as part of the pattern of racketeering activity alleged in furtherance of the
RICO conspiracy and racketeering charges in Counts One and Two of the Indictment. Because
they are so charged, the RICO RAs and counts are “connected with or constitute parts of a
common scheme or plan” and thus are properly joined under Rule 8(a). The defendants’ motion
to sever, therefore, should be denied on that ground.
C. Defendants Have Not And Cannot Make a Strong And Convincing Showing
Of Prejudice Warranting Severance Under Rule 14
The defendants’ request for severance under Rule 14 should be denied because they have
not made a strong and convincing showing of prejudice. Rule 14(a) states, in relevant part, “If
the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment . . . appears to prejudice a defendant . . .
6

the court may order separate trials of counts . . . .” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a). The United States
Supreme Court has instructed that, when defendants properly have been joined . . . a district
court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would
compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a

the glue necessary to bond multiple defendants together in a single proceeding where all are
accused of participating in the conspiracy.”)
6

As a threshold matter, Rule 14 does not expressly contemplate severance of RAs from a
single RICO count in an indictment. Indeed, the plain language of the Rule indicates that a court
may “order separate trials of counts.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a) (emphasis added). Rule 14,
therefore, does not specifically authorize a court to sever a single count – as the defendants
request here. Even the Rule’s “catch-all” provision - authorizing a court to “provide any other
relief justice requires,” does not necessarily provide the means for a court to sever RAs from a
RICO offense. See United States v. DeCologero, 364 F.3d 12, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussed
in more depth, infra).
7

Case 4:12-cr-40026-WGY Document 314 Filed 03/31/14 Page 8 of 12

reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.” Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993)
(emphasis added). Echoing this sentiment, the First Circuit has stated that a defendant seeking a
separate trial can succeed only by “making a strong showing of evident prejudice.” United
States v. O’Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing cases). As if the bar were not high
enough, severance is especially disfavored when defendants are charged with conspiracy, as in
this case. See, e.g., United States v. Celestin, 612 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2010); United States v.
Pena-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).
The defendants have not, and cannot, make such a showing here. As described, supra,
the ELMO RAs and counts are properly joined in the Indictment because they constitute
predicate acts committed in furtherance of the RICO enterprise and conspiracy charged in
Counts One and Two. Likewise, the three defendants are properly joined as participants in the
same RICO enterprise and conspiracy. See supra, footnote 4. Thus, neither the joinder of the
ELMO RAs and counts, nor the joinder of the three defendants - standing alone - can form the
basis of a strong and convincing showing of prejudice. That, however, is all that the defendants
argue. See Defendants’ Motion at 8 (“If the two charged schemes are not severed, the jury will
hear evidence of two unrelated alleged improprieties in hiring . . . This prejudice is particularly
acute with respect to defendants Tavares and Burke. They are not charged in connection with
the “ELMO hiring scheme” . . . .”). The defendants’ claims are premised on the argument that
the ELMO RAs and counts are misjoined (and, at least implicitly, that the defendants themselves
are misjoined). As those claims must fail, for the reasons described herein, so must the
defendants’ “garden variety” claim of prejudice. See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (“There is always
some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together—but such
“garden variety” prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice. . . . Even where large amounts of

8

Case 4:12-cr-40026-WGY Document 314 Filed 03/31/14 Page 9 of 12

testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement in an overall
agreement is far less than the involvement of others, we have been reluctant to secondguess
severance denials.”). For this reason as well, the defendants’ motion to sever should be denied.
D. The Defendants’ Motion Should Be Denied Because It Seeks To Exclude - Or
Even Dismiss - Portions Of The Government’s Evidence Of The Charged
RICO Conspiracy
The defendants’ motion to sever should be denied because it is, in effect, an improper
attempt to exclude (or dismiss) the government’s evidence in support of the alleged RICO
conspiracy. The First Circuit’s decision in DeCologero is instructive on this point. In
DeCologero, the government filed a twenty-three-count indictment, charging the appellant,
Decologero, and six others, with a RICO conspiracy and other, related crimes. DeCologero, 364
F.3d at 15. The indictment alleged 14 separate RAs (each with subparts, for a total of 38), some
of which were also substantive counts. Id. During a status conference prior to trial, the district
court sua sponte severed the case into two trials, ordering that the first trial consist of ten RAs
and seventeen substantive counts, and the second trial consist of the remaining four RAs and
three substantive counts. Id. at 16-17. The government moved for reconsideration, but the court
held firm citing its “inherent authority and responsibility for managing . . . trials before it so as to
protect the interests of the parties and the public in just determination of a criminal proceeding
with simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable
expense and delay.” Id. at 16 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The government filed
an interlocutory appeal, and the First Circuit agreed that the trial court’s decision was appealable
immediately. Id. at 19-20.
In deciding both the appealability and the merits of the district court’s severance, the First
Circuit treated the district court’s decision as an order to exclude evidence from the first trial. Id.
at 22 (“Such an exclusion of charged RAs to prove the pattern [of racketeering] is in our view an
9

Case 4:12-cr-40026-WGY Document 314 Filed 03/31/14 Page 10 of 12

exclusion of the evidence within the meaning of the second paragraph of section 3731 . . . it . . .
mean[s] that the government would be deprived of factual episodes that it would otherwise offer
to establish the pattern”) and at 24 (“By limiting the blocks of evidence that the government may
use, this exclusion can deprive the public permanently of rightful convictions. This loss of
evidence is not necessarily offset by the dubious possibility of a second trial, also on truncated
evidence.”). The First Circuit also recognized that the district court’s decision to exclude RAs
from the first trial could, effectively, constitute a dismissal of those RAs. Id. at 21. Since all of
the charged RAs constitute part of the same “pattern of racketeering,” the court explained, “a
second RICO prosecution based on the postponed acts would arguably itself be barred by double
jeopardy principles, the “acts” being different but the “pattern” being the same.” Id. If that is so,
7

said the court, “deferral was effectively dismissal.” Id.

While validating the district court’s concern with “trial management and jury
comprehension,” the First Circuit found that the court had overstepped its bounds, explaining
that, in its view, “telling the government that in order to simplify the trial it cannot prove RICO
acts for which it has secured an indictment (and which are otherwise proper under the statute and
rules of evidence) is more than mere housekeeping . . . [it] substantially weakens the charges that
remain in the first trial.” Id. at 23-24. Accordingly, the First Circuit held:
[I]n a RICO case, the exclusion of an RA or other criminal episode
in order to make the trial comprehensible for a jury may not be
wholly beyond the district court’s inherent authority . . . ; but it
would have to be a last resort where no more conventional method
existed to assure a fair trial and where the exclusion rested on
detailed and compelling findings. The test, in short, would be one
not of convenience but of last-ditch necessity.
Id. at 24. The district court’s rationale – (1) that it would be “virtually impossible to instruct the
7

The court did not need to decide the issue as it found that the district court’s order was
immediately appealable on the grounds that it constituted an exclusion of evidence. Id.
10

Case 4:12-cr-40026-WGY Document 314 Filed 03/31/14 Page 11 of 12

jury” if the case were not severed and (2) “to run a reasonable trial the jurors can understand that
is fair to both sides requires a break up of these wide ranging charges” – did not pass muster
under the First Circuit’s test. Id. (internal quotations omitted).
The defendants in this case fare no better than the district court in DeCologero. Indeed,
the defendants do not even cite DeCologero – despite its pertinence to their motion – let alone
attempt to explain how their request to exclude evidence of properly charged RAs is a “last-ditch
8

necessity” to assure a fair trial. Even if they had, any explanation would have fallen short given
the facts of this case. The thirty-count indictment focuses on 41 hiring decisions – 23 permanent
9

10

positions and 18 ELMO positions. Those hiring decisions form the basis of 62 RAs.

Unlike

many RICO indictments, this case involves only seven different state or federal offenses and 3
defendants, making it “virtually impossible” that a jury will be unable to understand this Court’s
instructions. As the First Circuit in DeCologero noted, “indictments of comparable or greater
complexity are regularly tried.” Id. (citing Boylan, a seven-defendant, 57-count indictment and
United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149-50 (2d Cir. 1989), a case that took seventeenmonths to try – both of which were upheld as acceptable in terms of length and complexity). In
sum, the defendants’ motion to sever RAs from a valid RICO indictment amounts to a motion to
exclude evidence. That motion should be denied as the defendants have not (and cannot) explain
– in compelling detail – the “last-ditch” necessity of their requested relief.
8

Of course, the defendants also seek to sever the ELMO counts in the indictment – a request
that does not directly implicate the First Circuit’s holding in DeCologero. However, each of the
ELMO substantive counts is also an RA. Thus, if the RAs cannot be excluded from the first
trial, neither prejudice nor efficiency would justify severance of the substantive counts.
9

As described in footnote 1, supra, and Exhibit A, one of the hires is neither a specified RA
nor a substantive count.
10

Thirty-nine of the RAs each contain one corresponding subpart.

For the reasons described herein, the defendants’ motion to sever the ELMO RAs and
counts should be denied.
