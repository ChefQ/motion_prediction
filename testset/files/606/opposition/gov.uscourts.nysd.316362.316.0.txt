PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN RESPONSE TO
MOTION TO WITHDRAW AS COUNSEL

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 316

Filed 07/19/12 Page 2 of 4

The EMI Music Publishing Plaintiffs and EMI Label Plaintiffs hereby submit this
response to Duane Morris LLP’s July 12, 2012 Motion to Withdraw (Docket No. 312). Plaintiffs
take no position with respect to Duane Morris LLP’s motion to withdraw as counsel for
Defendants, nor with respect to any dispute between Mr. Robertson and Duane Morris LLP.
However, Plaintiffs oppose any attempt to use such withdrawal or disagreement as a basis for
further delaying the progress of this litigation. The Motion to Withdraw strongly suggests that
Mr. Robertson deliberately created the circumstances triggering the dispute. The timing of the
dispute between Mr. Robertson and his counsel, much like the timing of MP3tunes’ bankruptcy
petition, thus appears to be another tactic by Mr. Robertson to further delay final resolution of
this action.
