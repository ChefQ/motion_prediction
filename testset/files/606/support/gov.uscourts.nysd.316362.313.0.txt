MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
WITHDRAW AS COUNSEL

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 313

Filed 07/12/12 Page 2 of 11

Pursuant to Southern District of New York Local Rule 1.4, Duane Morris LLP (“Duane
Morris”) respectfully submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion to withdraw as
counsel of record for defendants MP3tunes, Inc. (“MP3tunes”) and Michael Robertson
(“Robertson”) (collectively, “Defendants”) in the above-captioned matter and for all dates in the
case to be briefly adjourned pending the resolution of this motion and in the event that this
application is granted.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT AND BACKGROUND FACTS
As set forth more fully in the declaration of Edward M. Cramp, Esq. ("Cramp Dec."),
Duane Morris seeks leave to withdraw as counsel of record for Defendants because: (1)
Defendants failed to live up to their contractual obligations by failing to timely pay their legal
fees and expenses and breached an agreed upon payment plan for those fees; (2) a conflict of
interest exists because Duane Morris has become a creditor of MP3tunes in MP3tunes’
bankruptcy proceeding; and (3) Defendants and Duane Morris have divergent and irreconcilable
views regarding the litigation strategy to employ in this matter and Defendants’ actions have
seriously impaired Duane Morris’s ability to represent them.
Prior to making this motion, Duane Morris advised Defendants that it would be forced to
make a motion to withdraw on the grounds set forth herein. Defendant Robertson consented to
Duane Morris’s withdrawal as counsel for MP3tunes, but declined to consent to Duane Morris’s
withdrawal as counsel for Robertson in his personal capacity. Because Robertson declined to
consent to Duane Morris’s withdrawal as counsel for him in his personal capacity or to retain
substitute counsel, Duane Morris has had no choice but to proceed to seek leave to withdraw.
During the course of Duane Morris’s representation in this litigation, Duane Morris has
performed a substantial amount of work in connection with the pleading and discovery phases of

2

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 313

Filed 07/12/12 Page 3 of 11

this action, and has moved to dismiss some of Plaintiffs’ claims, prepared, and defended against,
dispositive cross-motions for Summary Judgment, and opposed Plaintiffs’ motion for
reconsideration and application for an interlocutory appeal.
Despite the substantial amount of work undertaken on their behalf, Defendants have
failed to live up to their contractual obligations to pay Duane Morris’s legal fees and expenses on
a timely basis. Notwithstanding Defendants’ agreement to pay invoices for Duane Morris’s legal
fees and repeated requests by Duane Morris for payment, Defendants have left substantial sums
unpaid and outstanding for legal services rendered in the above-captioned action as well as
extensive costs incurred on Defendants’ behalf.
As Defendants continued to fail to pay their legal fees, Duane Morris went to substantial
efforts and lengths to negotiate with the Defendants for payment of the outstanding amounts,
including communications, by telephone, in person, and through email. In an attempt to resolve
the outstanding legal fees with Defendants and in light of MP3tunes’ financial condition, Duane
Morris agreed to be paid on a quarterly basis, with each installment being a fixed amount.
However, after making just a few payments, Defendants failed to honor this arrangement and
failed to make any further payments of the significant fees and costs outstanding.
As a result of Defendants’ refusal to pay Duane Morris its legal fees and other significant
costs incurred in connection with the above-captioned matter, Duane Morris is also unable to
adequately represent the interests of Defendants. Recent communications with the Defendants
have made it clear that there has been a significant erosion of the attorney-client relationship.
Duane Morris and Defendants have divergent and irreconcilable views on the appropriate
strategy to employ in this litigation. Indeed, as a result of Defendants' failure to pay for legal
services and expenses incurred on its behalf, Duane Morris cannot pay vendors and expert

3

Filed 07/12/12 Page 4 of 11

witnesses in this litigation. Accordingly, Defendants' actions have seriously impaired Duane
Morris’s ability to represent them.
On April 27, 2012, defendant MP3tunes filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy
of the bankruptcy petition filed by MP3tunes. As set forth in the bankruptcy petition, Duane
Morris, among others, is identified among MP3tunes’ creditors. Because Duane Morris has been
identified as a creditor of MP3tunes in a bankruptcy proceeding, a substantial conflict of interest
may arise as a result of continued representation of Defendants by Duane Morris.
Duane Morris has advised Defendants of its intention to terminate its representation and
withdraw as their counsel. Duane Morris’s withdrawal will not prejudice the litigation, nor
substantially impede the progress of this action.
ARGUMENT
I.

The Rules of Professional Conduct and Local Rule 1.4 Relieve An Attorney Of
Record By Order Of Court
Pursuant to Local Rule 1.4 of the Southern District of New York, "an attorney who has

appeared as attorney of record for a party may be relieved . . . by order of the Court . . . . Such
an order may be granted only upon a showing by affidavit or otherwise of satisfactory reasons
for withdrawal . . . ." The New York State Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16 permits
withdrawal of counsel where the client "deliberately disregards an agreement or obligation to the
lawyer as to expenses or fees." N.Y. Prof. Conduct Rule 1.16.
II.

Defendants’ Failure to Pay Its Legal Fees and Expenses Alone Constitutes Sufficient
Good Cause for Permitting Withdrawal of Counsel
The Second Circuit has acknowledged that “where the client ‘deliberately disregarded’

financial obligations,” nonpayment of legal fees “may constitute ‘good cause’ to withdraw.”

Filed 07/12/12 Page 5 of 11

United States v. Parker, 439 F.3d 81, 104 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting McGuire v. Wilson, 735 F.
Supp. 83, 84 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) and N.Y. Code of Prof’l Responsibility D.R. 2-110(C)(a)(f)).
Similarly, this Court consistently has found the failure to pay legal fees to be a legitimate ground
for granting a motion to withdraw as counsel. See, e.g., Blue Angel Films, Ltd. v. First Look
Studios, Inc., No. 08 Civ. 6469 (DAB) (JCF), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16674, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 17, 2011) (“Although there is no clear standard for what may be considered a ‘satisfactory
reason’ for allowing a withdrawal, it seems evident that the non-payment of legal fees constitutes
such a reason.”); Diarama Trading Co., Inc. v. J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., Inc., No. 01 Civ.
2950 (DAB), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17008, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2005) (“‘Satisfactory
reasons include failure to pay legal fees.”) (internal citations omitted); Cower v. Albany Law Sch.
of Union Univ., No. 04 Civ. 0643 (DAB), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13669, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. July
8, 2005) (“It is well settled that nonpayment of fees is a legitimate ground for granting counsel's
motion to withdraw.”) (citation omitted); HCC, Inc. v. R H & M Mach. Co., No. 96 Civ. 4920
(PKL), 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10977, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 1998) (“It is well-settled that
non-payment of fees is a valid basis for granting counsel’s motion to withdraw.”); WABC-AM
Radio, Inc. v. Vlahos, 89 Civ. 1645, 1992 WL 276550, at *1-2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 1992)
(granting motions to withdraw on ground of client's failure to pay fees even if this would cause a
delay in the litigation).
Accordingly, courts regularly grant counsel’s motion for leave to withdraw where, as
here, a client fails to pay fees for legal services rendered or is unable or unwilling to pay for
services to be rendered in the future. Thus, in light of Defendants’ continual failure to honor
their contractual obligations to pay Duane Morris’s invoices for its legal fees and expenses, and

Filed 07/12/12 Page 6 of 11

later to make the fixed fee payments under the agreed upon payment plan, Duane Morris’s
motion to be relieved as counsel of record for the Defendants should be granted.
III.

Irreconcilable Differences With Client Further Warrants Withdrawal of Counsel
Under Rule1.16(c)(4) of The New York State Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer

may withdraw from representation where “the client insists upon taking action with which the
lawyer has a fundamental disagreement.” Furthermore, under Rule 1.16(c)(7), the lawyer may
withdraw where “the client fails to cooperate in the representation or otherwise renders the
representation unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out employment effectively.”
“‘[T]he existence of an irreconcilable conflict between attorney and client is a proper
basis for the attorney to cease representing his client.’” Bijan Karimian v. Time Equities, Inc.,
No. 10 Civ. 3773, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51916, at *4- *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2011) (citations
omitted); Dowler v. Cunard Line Ltd., No. 94 Civ. 7480, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9100 (S.D.N.Y.
June 28, 1996) (permitting withdrawal on the grounds that “strong evidence of a strained
attorney-client relationship regardless of the source of the strain is sufficient grounds” for an
attorney to withdraw); McGuire v. Wilson, 735 F. Supp. 83, 85 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (allowing
attorney to withdraw because "relationship between the parties has deteriorated beyond repair");
Hallmark Capital Corp. v. Red Rose Collection, No. 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16328, at *8-*9
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 1997) (“[T]he client and counsel have irreconcilable differences, that is a
satisfactory reason to allow counsel to withdraw.”).
Withdrawal has been permitted where “an irreconcilable conflict [] developed between
[counsel and client] regarding litigation strategy.” Hallmark Capital Corp., 1997 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 16328 (quoting Tufano v. City of New York, No. 94 Civ. 8655, 1996 WL 419912 at *1
(S.D.N.Y. July 25, 1996); citing Sansiviero v. Sanders, 117 A.D.2d 794, 795, 499 N.Y.S.2d 431,

6

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 313

431 (2d Dep't) (motion to withdraw granted in "light of the irreconcilable differences between"
counsel and his client "with respect to the proper course to be pursued by counsel in the
litigation”); see also Casper v. Lew Lieberbaum & Co., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7779 (S.D.N.Y.
May 24, 1999) (permitting withdrawal where plaintiffs and original counsel disagreed about
litigation strategy, the value of the case, [and] the strength of the case”). Furthermore, “counsel
ethically can withdraw where the client insists upon a course of conduct that is contrary to the
judgment and advice of counsel.” Ashcroft v. Dep't of Corr., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73624, 1416 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 18, 2008) (citing N.Y.S. Code of Prof. Responsibility, EC 7-8). Withdrawal
was also allowed where disagreement over witnesses arose. Whiting v. Lacara, 187 F.3d 317,
322 (2d Cir. 1999) (granted motion for withdrawal where client did not pay fees and the attorney
and client disagreed over pressing claims already dismissed and which witnesses to call).
As a result of Defendants’ continued failure and refusal to pay their legal fees and
expenses, an irreconcilable conflict and tension have developed between Defendants and their
counsel. Recent communications with the Defendants have made it clear that there has been a
significant erosion of the attorney-client relationship. Moreover, Duane Morris can no longer
adequately represent the interests of Defendants. Defendants and their counsel have extremely
diverging and irreconcilable views with respect to the appropriate strategy to employ in this
litigation and the resources which must be devoted in defense of this lawsuit. As a result of
Defendants' failure to pay legal expenses incurred on its behalf, Duane Morris’s ability to
zealously defend Defendants has been seriously compromised because Duane Morris cannot pay
expert witnesses and vendors in this litigation. Accordingly, Defendants' actions have seriously
impaired Duane Morris’s ability to represent them.

Filed 07/12/12 Page 8 of 11

Conflict of Interest Justifies Withdrawal
New York Courts have permitted withdrawal where a conflict of interest arises between

an attorney and client. See, e.g., International Business Counselors, Inc. v. Bank of Ikeda, Ltd.,
1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2550 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 1990). A conflict of interest occurs if, during the
course of the representation, the attorney's and client's interests diverge with respect to a material
factual or legal issue or to a course of action. See United States v. Malpiedi, 62 F.3d 465, 469 (2d
Cir. 1995)). Indeed, New York Courts have granted an attorney’s motion to withdraw where, as
here, an attorney becomes a creditor of the client in a bankruptcy proceeding and the attorney’s
dual status as creditor and attorney creates a conflict. See, e.g., In re Bond, 282 A.D.2d 93, 94
(N.Y. App. Div. 4th Dep't 2001) (where attorney had successfully moved to withdraw as counsel
based upon the conflict presented by his dual status as the clients' creditor and attorney).
Continued representation of Defendants by Duane Morris could give rise to a conflict of
interest as a result of Duane Morris’s dual roles as both creditor of MP3tunes in the bankruptcy
proceeding and counsel to Robertson. Moreover, if Duane Morris is forced to continue with its
representation of Defendants, Duane Morris will most likely be required to litigate, and counsel
Defendants on, issues that impact or relate to its own collections efforts in the bankruptcy against
Defendants.
V.

Withdrawal of Counsel Will Not Prejudice Defendants
Defendants will not be prejudiced by Duane Morris’s withdrawal as counsel. An

automatic stay is in effect as to any claims against MP3tunes.1 Furthermore, Defendant
Robertson’s summary judgment motion is fully briefed and is currently sub judice with the
1

Since the filing of the petition for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee for the MP3tunes estate
has not sought to retain Duane Morris to act as counsel for the MP3tunes estate. Nor has
such engagement been approved by the bankruptcy court as required by 11 U.S.C. § 327(e).

8

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 313

Court. Moreover, Duane Morris has requested a brief continuance of all dates, therefore “any
new counsel retained by [Defendants] would not be forced to ‘hit the ground running’ but would
instead have ample time to familiarize himself with the entire record in the case and thus prepare
himself either to proceed to trial should summary judgment be denied or prepare an appeal if
summary judgment is granted.” See Diarama Trading Co. v. J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., Inc.,
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17008 at *9 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (citing Furlow v. New York, 1993 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 3510 at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)) (holding that client would not be prejudiced by counsel’s
withdrawal while client’s summary judgment motion was sub judice).
Moreover, in light of the irreconcilable tension and conflict between Defendants and their
counsel and the conflict of interest presented by Duane Morris’s dual role as both creditor and
counsel to Defendants, Duane Morris respectfully submits that they should be allowed to
withdraw as counsel. Duane Morris also respectfully requests that a brief continuance of the
scheduled dates for the summary judgment hearing and for briefing on the motions for
reconsideration be granted pending the resolution of this motion and in the event that this
application is granted.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Duane Morris respectfully requests that the Court grant its
motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Defendants and briefly continue the scheduled dates
in the case.
