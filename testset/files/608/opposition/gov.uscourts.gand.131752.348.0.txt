I.

INTRODUCTION

The Subpoena served in this District at issue in this matter, as well as the
identical Subpoena served by Plaintiffs in the Southern District of Florida, see
Subpoena served on LSC in Southern District of Florida, attached hereto as Exhibit
“A,” are part of an attempt by Plaintiffs to continue to harass and burden LSC, a
non-party in the above-referenced action, with successive subpoenas requiring
production of documents, and now Electronically Stored Information (ESI), in
response to duplicative, overbroad, and vaguely worded requests. Plaintiffs have
failed to issue a single subpoena to LSC in the direct litigation that is presently
pending between the parties; instead, preferring to served successive, duplicative
non-party subpoenas upon LSC in various litigation to which LSC is not a party.
The Subpoena issued in this case is inappropriate because, as Plaintiffs are aware,
the documents at issue are located in LSC’s Florida office.

Moreover, the

Subpoena violates the express provisions of Rule 45(c)(1), which states that “[a]
party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall
take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person
subject to that subpoena.” As detailed herein, the Subpoena at issue consists of
twenty-four (24) separate categories of documents that are similar, if not identical
to twenty-four (24) categories of documents previously sought by Plaintiffs in a

2

non-party subpoena served upon LSC in a separate arbitration, Life Receivables
Trust v. Syndicate 102 at Lloyd’s of London, ICDR No. 50-198-T-0372-05 (the
“LRT Arbitration”). A copy of subpoena served in the LRT Arbitration is attached
as Exhibit “B.” As of this date, at great expense, LSC already has produced to
Plaintiffs approximately 18,515 pages in response to its prior subpoena for which
Plaintiffs have not paid anything.
Plaintiffs have taken an inappropriate and unreasonable position in an effort
to force LSC to produce identical documents and now ESI presently located in the
Southern District of Florida in response to a successive and substantially similar
subpoena. For these reasons, among others, Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce should be
denied.
II.
A.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Relevant Parties
1.

LSC

LSC, as originator, acquires in the secondary market life insurance policies.
With guidance from evaluations of the insureds’ life expectancies performed by
third-party independent professional estimators selected and approved by Plaintiffs
and after consideration of other factors, LSC determines the price discount for the
policies. The discount from the policy’s face value reflects a number of factors,

3

including but not limited to the insured’s life expectancy and future premium
payments required to maintain the policy. LSC then pays the premiums required to
maintain the insurance policies. Policies acquired by LSC from approximately
2000 through 2002, were then placed with a special purpose vehicle, Life
Receivables Trust (“LRT”).
In acquiring life insurance policies, there is a risk that the insureds will live
beyond their life expectancies, thereby requiring additional expenditures to
maintain the policies and, thus, diminishing its return. To reduce this risk, the
policies acquired during this timeframe were covered by contingency insurance
policies (“CCI Policies”) provided by Syndicate 102 of Lloyd’s of London
(“Syndicate 102”), who, in exchange for premium payments, agreed to pay the
policy amount if the benefits are not received within an expected time.
2.

Syndicate 102 and the Plaintiffs

Syndicate 102 is an underwriting agency for Lloyd’s of London. Plaintiff
Goshawk Dedicated, Ltd. is the current owner and sole member of Syndicate 102.
Plaintiff Kite Dedicated, Ltd. was the owner and sole member of Syndicate 102
from approximately 2001 through 2003.

Due to mismanagement, Lloyd’s of

London shut down Syndicate 102 to new business in October 2003 and placed it
into run-off. See Lloyd’s Statement on Goshawk Syndicate, dated October 31,

4

2003, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit “C.”
Pursuant to the CCI Policies, Syndicate 102 unconditionally agreed that, in
exchange for payment of premiums, should a covered policy not pay its benefits
within the insured’s life expectancy plus two years, Syndicate 102 would pay the
net death benefit.
B.

The LRT Arbitration
In September 2005, LRT initiated an arbitration against Syndicate as a result

of Syndicate’s refusal to uphold its obligation to pay the benefit in connection with
an insured, Cheng-Ching Wang (the “Wang Claims”), whose life insurance policy
was covered under CR010054 (“Policy 54”), one of the CCI Policies issued by
Syndicate 102. Under Policy 54, LRT was entitled to payment from Syndicate of
the policy death benefit. LSC is not a party to the LRT Arbitration.
C.

The Goshawk Arbitration
In July 2006, Plaintiffs filed a separate arbitration against LSC in ICDR No.

50-195-T-00337-06 (the “Goshawk Arbitration”). Although LSC had used the
independent medical evaluators selected and approved by Plaintiffs, including
American Viatical Services (AVS), the party defendant in this lawsuit, the
Plaintiffs’ claim that the life expectancies relied upon LSC in acquiring the
insurance policies were flawed. As of this date, a panel has not been assigned. In

5

addition, Plaintiffs have never sought discovery in that case.
D.

The LRT Subpoena
Instead of seeking discovery in the proper forum -- the Goshawk Arbitration

-- where LSC can confront Plaintiffs’ meritless allegations and have its day in
Court, Plaintiffs have embarked on a strategy of serving LSC with successive,
substantially identical subpoenas. Plaintiffs currently have served more than fiftyfour (54) separate requests, including subparts, between the LRT Arbitration and
this case.1
In derogation of the provisions of the CCI Policies, Syndicate 102 caused the
LRT Arbitration Panel (“Panel”) to issue a subpoena duces tecum (the “LRT
Arbitral Subpoena”) directed to LSC for pre-hearing production of documents.
The LRT Arbitral Subpoena itself is substantially duplicative of discovery served
upon LRT, a party in the arbitration. 18 of the 25 categories of documents sought
in the LRT Arbitral Subpoena were identical or substantially identical to the LRT
Request.

Where not duplicative, the LRT Arbitral Subpoena was patently

overbroad and expansive. The LRT Arbitral Subpoena went well beyond the
Wang Claims and purports to seek information wholly irrelevant to the LRT
Arbitration.
1

This does not include the identical subpoena served in this case and issued by the Southern District of Florida
where the documents are located.

6

LSC moved immediately to quash the Subpoena in the Southern District of
New York, challenging the Panel’s authority to issue the LRT Arbitral Subpoena.
The court ultimately denied LSC’s motion, which currently is on appeal. On July
31, 2007, after termination of a stay pending appeal, the Southern District of New
York ordered LSC to produce documents subject to any ruling by the Panel on
LSC’s objections to the LRT Arbitral Subpoena by September 28, 2007. After the
Panel declined to hear LSC’s objections in derogation of its obligations under
applicable law, LSC, at great expense and without waiver of its objections,
produced approximately 18,515 pages.
E.

The AVS Subpoena
On or about July 26, 2007, Plaintiffs’ counsel issued and served upon LSC

in this case identical subpoenas -- (1) the instant Subpoena that is the subject of
Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce served in Georgia even though Plaintiffs’ counsel was
aware that the documents were located in Florida and (2) an identical subpoena
issued in the Southern District of Florida.
A comparison of the LRT Arbitral Subpoena and the instant Subpoena
plainly demonstrates the duplicative, overbroad and burdensome nature of the
requests. Many of the requests are identical. For example, in Request No. 22,
Plaintiffs seek:

7

All LSC/Peachtree brochures, organizational charts, and all business
cards (including but not limited to Craig M. Lessner, Jeffrey K. Nipp,
Sergio Salani, Lori Wengatz, James Terlizzi, and Timothy Trankina)
over the relevant period.
While the relevance of this Request to any possible issue in the instant
litigation between Plaintiffs and AVS strains credulity, this Request is even more
burdensome and harassing given that it is identical to Request No. 23 of the LRT
Arbitral Subpoena.
Similarly, in Request No. 18, Plaintiffs seek:
All Documents and ESI concerning the policies or practices of
LSC/Peachtree for the preservation and/or destruction of records.
Again, while the relevance of LSC’s document retention policies to the
claims between Plaintiff and AVS is questionable, at best, the Request is truly
abusive as it is identical to Request No. 13 of the LRT Arbitral Subpoena.
In Request No. 19, Plaintiffs seek:
All Documents and ESI concerning the methodologies and/or factors
that LSC/Peachtree used to calculate the purchase price for the life
policies.
While overbroad in that this Request is in no way limited to LSC’s purchase
of life policies for which AVS, as Plaintiffs’ approved medical underwriter,
provided medical evaluations, this Request is identical of Request No. 14 of the
LRT Arbitral Subpoena. Request No. 16 of this Subpoena also is identical to

8

Request No. 8 of the LRT Arbitral Subpoena and Request No. 17 is identical to
Request No. 9 of the LRT Arbitral Subpoena .
All told, at least five (5) requests in the instant Subpoena are identical to
requests in the LRT Arbitral Subpoena and all twenty-four (24) requests are
substantially identical or otherwise subsumed within the requests in the LRT
Arbitral Subpoena. A chart summarizing the duplicative nature of the suboenas is
attached as Exhibit “D.”
III.

DISCUSSION

This Court should deny Plaintiffs motion to enforce the Subpoena pursuant
to Rule 45(c) for the following reasons: (1) the Subpoena issued and served in
Georgia seeks production of documents in Georgia that are maintained in LSC’s
offices in Boynton Beach, Florida; (2) the Subpoena is violative of the obligation
imposed by Rule 45(c)(1) on a party and its counsel to avoid imposing undue
burden or expense upon the responding party;(3) the Subpoena is identical or
substantially identical to prior requests covered in the LRT Arbitral Subpoena for
which LSC already has produced over 18,000 pages; (4) the Subpoena seeks
information irrelevant to this matter; (5) compliance with the Subpoena would

9

impose an undue burden upon LSC; and (6) the Subpoena seeks production of
LSC’s confidential and trade secret information.2
A.

Plaintiffs’ Subpoena Improperly Purports to Require Production In
This District Of Documents That Presently Are Located In LSC’s
Offices In Florida
At the outset, enforcement of the Subpoena issued by this Court should be

denied because the documents sought are located in Florida. It is well-settled that
a Rule 45 subpoena cannot be issued for the production of documents located
outside of the jurisdiction in which the subpoena is served. See Ariel v. Jones, 693
F.2d 1058, 1061 (11th Cir. 1982) (affirming order quashing subpoena seeking
production of documents in the Middle District of Florida on the basis that
documents that were the subject of subpoena were not located within that district
and holding that "[a] corporation may not realistically be considered fungible
everywhere it does business. Therefore, even positing that this court has personal
jurisdiction . . ., it is unreasonable to assume that these appellants' local offices
'control' all documents kept at their respective corporate headquarters . . . In the
absence of such control, therefore, even the existence of personal jurisdiction in
this court is insufficient to create jurisdiction over the documents which are outside
of this district."); see also Gutescu v. Carey Int., Inc., 2003 WL 25589034,

2

LSC incorporates by reference all objections to the Subpoena at issue, a copy of which is attached hereto.

10

*2 (S.D. Fla. June 25, 2003) (holding that "[t]his Court does not have the power to
issue a subpoena duces tecum to National Union, a non-party located in New York
City, for the production of documents located in the Southern District of New York
to a location within this District.").
Plaintiffs were aware that documents were located in Florida and, in fact,
served upon LSC an identical subpoena issued by the Southern District of Florida.
Following applicable law, Plaintiffs did not have authority to cause this Subpoena
to be issued in this District to compel production of documents located in Florida.
Accordingly, the motion to enforce must be denied.
B.

Plaintiffs’ Subpoena Violates the Obligation to Avoid Burden and
Expense Imposed By Fed. R. Civ. P. 45
While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 allows a party to “issue a

subpoena to compel a non-party to produce evidence independent of any
deposition,” paragraph (c)(1) of the Rule also imposes upon the party seeking
production and its counsel an affirmative obligation to avoid imposing a burden or
expense upon the respondent:
A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a
subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing an undue
burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. The court on
behalf of which the subpoena was issued shall enforce this duty and
impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this duty an appropriate
sanction, which may include, but is not limited to lost earnings and a
reasonable attorneys’ fees.
11

(Emphasis added).
As a preliminary matter, the information requested in the Subpoena must fall
within the permissible scope of discovery in general. See, e.g. Fed. R. Civ. P.
45(d) Advisory Committee’s Note 1970 Amendment (stating that “the scope of
discovery through a subpoena is the same as that applicable to . . . the other
discovery rules”). This means that the documents requested in the Subpoena must
be “relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.” Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(b)(1).
Ultimately, the Court’s determination depends on one question - whether
Plaintiffs’ claimed need for this undeniably duplicative discovery overcomes the
injury to LSC in being forced to comply with a Subpoena that requires the
production of documents maintained in Florida in this District Georgia in response
to overly broad and oppressive requests seeking irrelevant information beyond any
reasonable relation to the case at bar. See Heidelberg Americas, Inc. v. Tokyo
Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd., 333 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that arguments
relating to relevance, breadth of inquiry, undue burden and disclosure of trade
secrets all address one central question – whether the requesting party’s need for
the information overcomes the non-party’s rationale for resisting disclosure). See
also Travelers Indem. Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 228 F.R.D. 111, 113 (D. Conn.
12

2005).

Plaintiffs have not, and cannot, establish such an overwhelming need

because the information sought is duplicative of discovery in the LRT Arbitration
and in many instances has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying litigation
between Plaintiffs and AVS. Even if the information requested was somehow
relevant (which LSC emphatically denies), no modification to the Subpoena could
alleviate or overcome its defects and prevent the irreparable harm that LSC is
certain to incur as a result of the being required to make a duplicative and
unnecessary production.
C.

Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Should Be Denied On Grounds That It
Duplicative And Seeks Irrelevant Information
1.

The Subpoena Is Duplicative Of The LRT Subpoena

As detailed above, the Subpoena that Plaintiffs issued and served in this case
is in many respects completely identical to the LRT Arbitral Subpoena. Where it is
not completely identical, the instant Subpoena is substantially identical or
otherwise subsumed within the similarly broadly-worded requests in the LRT
Arbitral Subpoena.
In their memorandum of law, Plaintiffs devote substantial space to
misstatements regarding the proceedings with respect to the LRT Arbitral
Subpoena. LSC disputes Plaintiffs’ repeated mischaracterizations briefly below.

13

The LRT Arbitral Subpoena was served on or about December 28, 2006.
LSC sought to quash the Subpoena in the Southern District of New York on two
jurisdictional grounds: (1) that the Panel lacked the authority under the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”) to disregard the express “pay first” provisions of Policy
54 which required Syndicate 102 to pay the death benefit before it could take any
action; and (2) that the Panel lacked the authority to issue a pre-hearing subpoena
for documents under Section 7 of the FAA. At the same time, LSC served timely
objections to the LRT Arbitral Subpoena, objecting, as it has here, to, among other
things, the overbreadth, vague and abusive nature of the subpoena.

Those

substantive objections were asserted to the LRT Arbitration Panel who was
responsible for determining issues relating to the scope or propriety of the LRT
Arbitral Subpoena. On March 12, 2007, the court for the Southern District of New
York denied LSC’s motion from which LSC took an appeal to the Second Circuit.
LSC’s appeal has not yet been decided. During the pendency of the appeal, LSC
was granted a temporary stay from the Second Circuit which then was terminated
on June 13, 2007.
Following termination of the temporary stay, LSC sought ruling from the
LRT Arbitration Panel on its timely objections.

To date, and in apparent

contravention of applicable law, the LRT Arbitration Panel has never ruled upon

14

LSC’s timely objections. Nevertheless, on or about July 31, 2007, the district court
in the Southern District of New York ordered LSC to produce all documents
responsive to the LRT Arbitral Subpoena by September 28, 2007. On September
28, 2007, after diligent search done at great expense, LSC completed a production
of documents in response to the LRT Arbitral Subpoena consisting of 18,515
pages.
Although the LRT Arbitral Subpoena incorporates the provisions of Rule 45
requiring Syndicate 102, as the requesting party, to reasonably compensate LSC
for the expense of production, neither Syndicate 102 or Plaintiffs have paid LSC
anything for its expense in responding to the subpoena.

At bottom, despite

Plaintiffs’ misguided efforts to characterize the proceedings relating to the LRT
Arbitral Subpoena, LSC has always complied with its obligations and court orders
regarding same.
Notwithstanding LSC’s compliance with the LRT Arbitral Subpoena, even if
Plaintiffs take issue with LSC’s production, nothing in Plaintiffs’ motion to
enforce or memorandum of law can be read to permit Plaintiffs to cause this Court
to issue a substantially identical subpoena. Plaintiffs do not and cannot cite to any
provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or applicable federal case law
that would permit them to have another court in another district hearing another

15

case issue another subpoena seeking the same documents merely because Plaintiffs
were dissatisfied with LSC’s compliance with respect to the first subpoena.
2.

Plaintiffs’ Subpoena Seeks Irrelevant Information

Discovery simply may not be had regarding a matter that is “not relevant to
the subject matter in the pending action.” Micro Motion, Inc. v. Kane Steel Co.,
894 F.2d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In addition to the duplicative nature of the
Subpoena, time and again, Plaintiffs attempt to use this Court’s subpoena power to
require the production of information that has nothing at all to do with Plaintiffs’
claims against AVS.
For example, in Request No. 2, Plaintiffs seek all communications between
LSC and AVS regarding Mortality Experience in respect to LEs (life expectancies)
provided by “another LE Evaluator.” Inasmuch as the instant litigation concerns
Plaintiffs’ claims against AVS for allegedly providing inaccurate life expectancies,
life expectancies performed by other LE Evaluators, as that term is defined in the
Subpoena are of no consequence. In Request No. 9, Plaintiffs purport to require
LSC to produce documents and ESI concerning communications with rating
agencies or financial backers concerning AVS in any respect or “LE evaluations
generally.” Setting aside for the moment the obvious vagueness of Plaintiffs’
request for communications regarding “LE evaluations generally,” as phrased this

16

request is not in any way limited to life expectancies provided by AVS and, thus,
exceeds any possible relation to any issue in this case. Request Nos. 11, 12, 13,
14, and 17 contain similar language requesting documents unrelated to AVS and,
thus, are, similarly flawed. Here, in Request No. 20, Plaintiffs also purport to seek
communications between LSC and AVS regarding the LRT Arbitration.
Discussions regarding that separate litigation are irrelevant to Plaintiffs’ so-called
claims against AVS in this case.
D.

Plaintiffs’ Subpoena Imposes An Undue And Oppressive Burden on
LSC
1.

The Subpoena Seeks Production Of Identical Documents
For A Second Time

Even if the information sought by the Subpoena was not duplicative of the
LRT Arbitral Subpoena for which LSC already has produced more than 18,000
pages and somehow could be deemed relevant to any issue pending in this case,
“discovery is [still] not permitted where no need is shown, or compliance would be
unduly burdensome, or where harm to the person from whom discovery is sought
outweighs the need of the person seeking discovery of the information.” Micro
Motion, 894 F.2d at 1323; see also Allen v. Howmedica Leibinger, 190 F.R.D. 518,
521 (W.D. Tenn. 1999).

17

To evaluate the undue burden on LSC, the court must “weigh the burden to
the subpoenaed party against the value of the information to the serving party.”
Travelers Indemnity, 228 F.R.D. at 113; In re: Duque, 134 B.R. 679, 683 (S.D. Fla.
1991). This involves a fact-specific balancing test depending on “such factors as
relevance, the need of a party for the documents, the breadth of the document
request, the time period covered by it, the particularity with which the documents
are described and the burden imposed.” Travelers Indemnity, 228 F.R.D. at 113;
see also Cytodyne Technologies, Inc. v. Biogenic Technologies, Inc., 216 F.R.D.
533, 535 (M.D. Fla. 2003). LSC’s status as a non-party to the litigation is given
special weight in this balancing of interests. See Travelers Indemnity, 228 F.R.D.
at 113 (“courts also give special weight to the burden on non-parties of producing
documents to parties involved in litigation”); Allen, 190 F.R.D. at 521 (“ . . . courts
have considered nonparty status as one factor when weighing the burdens that
discovery may impose.”).
As a non-party, LSC would suffer an oppressive burden if forced to comply
with the Subpoena issued in this litigation. As discussed previously, the sweeping
broadly-worded requests would require LSC, a non-party, and its employees for a
second time to locate, sift through, sort, review and likely perform extensive
redaction on all of the documents in its possession.

18

Given

this

oppressive

and undue burden which would be imposed for a second time, Plaintiffs’ motion to
enforce should be denied.
2.

Much Of The Information Sought Is Available From Other
Sources

Where the information sought may just as easily be obtained from other
sources, including AVS, as a party defendant, the Subpoena is unduly burdensome
and must be quashed. See Premium Serv. Corp. v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 511
F.2d 225, 229 (9th Cir. 1975) (affirming the quashing of a subpoena where
compliance would have required “extensive sifting and analysis” by the nonparty’s employees because the requesting party’s need for the documents was not
sufficient to outweigh the burden and invasion of corporate privacy that would
have resulted to the non-parties to the action); see Travelers Indem. Co., 228
F.R.D. at 113 (quashing a subpoena as unduly burdensome where it called for the
review of all the non-party’s documents associated with over 1,000 insurance
policies kept in hundreds of boxes stored in numerous offices and warehouses in
several states and the documents were obtainable from the public record or from a
party to the litigation); Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Zeiss, 40 F.R.D. 318, 238 (D.D.C.
1966) (“Necessity for production is sharply reduced where an available alternative
for obtaining the desired evidence has not been explored”), aff’d, 384 F.2d 979
(D.C. Cir. 1967).
19

Absent a demonstrated inability to obtain that information from AVS, a
party in this case, Plaintiffs cannot even begin to request it from LSC. Travelers
Indemnity Co., 228 F.R.D. at 113; Premium Service, 511 F.2d at 229; Carl Zeiss,
40 F.R.D. at 238. Accordingly, the enforcement of the Subpoena should be denied.
E.

Plaintiffs’ Subpoena Seeks LSC’s Trade Secrets and Other Confidential
Commercial Information
It is considered oppressive and unreasonable to require a non-party to

disclose private and confidential business information. Hecht v. Pro-Football,
Inc., 46 F.R.D. 605, 607 (D.D.C. 1969) (recognizing the right to privacy and the
right to keep financial affairs as confidential and holding that it is oppressive or
unreasonable to require a non-party to disclose such information). This potential
loss of LSC’s corporate privacy far outweighs any purported need for the
information on Plaintiffs’ part. See also Northwestern Mem’l Hosp. v. Ashcroft,
362 F.3d 923, 927 (7th Cir. 2004) (quashing a subpoena issued by the Government
to a non-party hospital seeking information regarding some of the hospital’s
doctors on the grounds that the “balance of harms resulting from disclosure
severely out-weighs the loss to the government through non-disclosure”);
Travelers Indem., 228 F.R.D. at 113; Hecht, 46 F.R.D. at 607.
Compliance with the Subpoena would violate LSC’s corporate privacy
through the disclosure of Peachtree Life’s internal business and financial
20

information, analysis and strategy.

Request No. 19, for example, seeking

production of:
All documents and ESI concerning the methodologies and/or factors
that LSC/Peachtree used to calculate the purchase price for life
policies.
First and foremost, as with many of the requests, this Request is in no way
limited to life insurance policies for which AVS supplied medical evaluations.
Second, this Request is not limited to the medical evaluations at all, but seeks all
information regarding how LSC determines its purchase price for any life
insurance policy it acquired, whether or not AVS was involved. The medical
evaluations are but one factor used by LSC in calculating its purchase price. These
other factors are of no relevance whatsoever to Plaintiffs’ claims. In fact, what
LSC paid for the life insurance policies is of no apparent relevance to Plaintiffs’
claims against AVS. What this Request does is seek to force LSC to divulge its
pricing model, which is LSC’s confidential trade secret and business information.
In light of the obvious irrelevance, this invasion of LSC’s business information
should be denied.
Moreover, compliance with the Subpoena would also invade the privacy of
each and every one of LSC’s customers by disclosing, among other things, each
customer’s: (i) name, (ii) projected life expectancy based on his/her overall health

21

and medical condition, (iii) health and medical condition, (iv) estate planning
activities, and (v) personal financial information. As Appendix A to the Subpoena,
Plaintiffs identify one hundred forty-five (145) named insureds for whom they now
seek disclosure by LSC of confidential personal, medical and financial
information. Much of this information may be protected by Health Information
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and, even if not, much of this
information is wholly irrelevant to Plaintiffs’ claims against AVS. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the Subpoena should be denied.
F.

Even If the Court Orders LSC to Produce Documents in Response to
Some Portions of the Subpoena, Any Production Should Be Conditioned
Upon Plaintiffs’ Payment In Advance For All Costs Associated With
Any Production of Documents and ESI
As set forth above, LSC disputes that Plaintiffs are entitled to require LSC to

respond to nearly-identical requests for production a second time. In the event,
however, that this Court orders LSC to produce documents in response to some
portions of the Subpoena, under Rule 45(c) it may require Plaintiffs to compensate
LSC for all costs associated with the production. Notably, this Court has already
required Plaintiffs to pay for the costs of production of another non-party in this
case. By Order dated June 15, 2007, this Court already has ordered that Plaintiffs
pay the costs of production associated with a subpoena served upon another
provider, Portsmouth Settlement Company I, Inc.
22

Rule 45(c)(2)(B), as amended in 1991, requires that an order to compel
production of documents pursuant to a subpoena “shall protect any person who is
not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the
inspection, copying, testing or sampling commanded.” (emphasis added). Fed. R.
Civ. P. 45(c)(2)(B). “The mandatory language of this Rule represents a clear
change from old Rule 45(b), which gave district courts discretion to condition the
enforcement of subpoenas on the petitioner’s paying for the costs of production.”
In re Exxon Valdez, 142 F.R.D. 380, 383 (D.D.C. 1992) (original emphasis);
accord, Tutor-Saliba Corp. v. U.S., 32 Fed.Cl. 609, 611-12 (Fed. Cl.) (“the new
rule expressly provides that, when a court orders a nonparty to comply with a
subpoena, it must protect the nonparty from significant expense; previously, this
action was merely discretionary”), appeal dismissed, 52 F.3d 343 (Fed. Cir. 1995).
Under the rule now in effect, non-parties are entitled not only to their direct
production costs, but also to their legal fees, “where the work benefits the
requesting party.” In re First Am. Corp. (First American), 184 F.R.D. 234, 241
(S.D.N.Y. 1998); accord, e.g., Kahn v. General Motors Corp., 1992 WL 208286,
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 1992). Indeed, there is a strong presumption that nonparties should be fully recompensed for being compelled to comply with a
discovery subpoena:

23

Rule 45’s mandatory cost-shifting provisions promote the most
efficient use of resources in the discovery process. When nonparties
are forced to pay the costs of discovery, the requesting party has no
incentive to deter it from engaging in fishing expeditions for
marginally relevant material. Requestors forced to internalize the
costs of discovery will be more inclined to make narrowly tailored
requests reflecting a reasonable balance between the likely relevance
of the evidence that will be discovered and the costs of compliance.
Linder v. Calero-Portocarrero, 183 F.R.D. 314, 322-23 (D.D.C. 1998). The need
for cost-shifting is heightened where, as here, the proponent of the Subpoena seeks
ESI. See Opentv v. Liberate Technologies, 219 F.R.D. 474 (N.D. Cal. 2003)(in
order to determine whether cost-shifting is appropriate for discovery of electronic
data, factors that should be considered are: (1) the extent to which the request is
specifically tailored to discover relevant information; (2) the availability of such
information from other sources; (3) the total cost of production, compared to the
amount in controversy; (4) the total cost of production, compared to the resources
available to each party; (5) the importance of the issues at stake; and (6) the
relative benefits to the parties of obtaining the information); Guychemical
Company, Inc. v. Romaco AG, 243 F.R.D. 310 (N.D. Ind. 2007).
To date, Plaintiffs have not paid anything towards LSC’s prior production in
response to the nearly-identical LRT Arbitral Subpoena. To the extent that this
Court were to determine that Plaintiffs are entitled to any production, such
production should be conditioned upon Plaintiffs’ payment in advance of all costs
24

in obtaining documents and ESI that are responsive to the Subpoena.
V.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion to
enforce.
