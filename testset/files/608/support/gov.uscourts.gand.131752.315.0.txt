PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
FROM NON-PARTY LIFE SETTLEMENT CORPORATION D/B/A
PEACHTREE LIFE SETTLEMENTS
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37 and 45, Plaintiffs Goshawk
Dedicated Ltd. and Kite Dedicated Ltd. (“Plaintiffs”) hereby file their Motion to
Compel Non-Party Peachtree Life Settlement Corporation d/b/a Peachtree Life
Settlements (“Peachtree”) to produce the documents requested in Plaintiffs’
Subpoena for Production of Documents (the “Subpoena”).
As explained in Plaintiffs’ brief, the documents Plaintiffs have requested in
the Subpoena are highly relevant to this matter and are likely to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Nevertheless, Peachtree has refused to produce
any of the requested documents based upon meritless objections. On August 29,
2007, counsel for Plaintiffs and Peachtree conferred by telephone in a good faith

AO 1755333.1

effort to resolve the instant dispute. As no agreement could be reached, Plaintiffs
have filed this motion to compel.
Set forth verbatim below are the 24 categories of documents requested by
the Subpoena and Peachtree’s objections to each category.
Request No. 1
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with AVS with regard
to LE Evaluation, including without limitation Documents and ESI concerning
processes methodologies, practices, systems, tools (e.g. manuals, tables, models),
and confidence levels and including without limitation the manner in which LEs
(preliminary, final or revised) would be provided by AVS.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 1
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI as overbroad, vague, unduly burdensome,
and not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. As phrased,
Plaintiffs seek all communications with AVS “with regard to LE Evaluation.” The
term “LE Evaluation,” itself, is defined as “the process by which a life expectancy
(“LE”) date for individuals is developed by AVS or other entity.” (Emphasis
added.) Accordingly, as phrased, this request seeks documents and ESI relating to
communications with AVS regarding life expectancies developed by other entities.
2
AO 1755333.1

The request also seeks communications relating to transactions to which Goshawk
is not a party nor otherwise involved. Given the overbroad and vague definitions,
LSC should not be required to attempt to discern what Plaintiffs are seeking at
their own peril.
Request No. 2
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with AVS with regard
to Mortality Experience in respect of LEs developed by AVS or another LE
Evaluator.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 2
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI as overbroad, vague, unduly burdensome,
and not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Among other things,
Plaintiffs do not specify or otherwise identify in any meaningful way the
individual(s) or entity(ies) for which “Mortality Experience” they seek production.
By way of example, as phrased, this category of documents could be construed to
require production of not only any communications between LSC and AVS with
respect of any LE Evaluators’ “Mortality Experience,” but also all documents that
may have been mentioned or even considered by LSC in connection with its
communications with AVS, whether or not those documents were ever shared with
3
AO 1755333.1

AVS. The request also seeks communications relating to transactions to which
Goshawk is not a party or in which Goshawk is not involved. LSC should not be
required to proceed at its peril in trying to understand the scope of the production
sought by the Subpoena.
Request No. 3
All Documents and ESI concerning mortality reports, mortality profiles or
LE Evaluations or projections that AVS made, or AVS was requested to make, on
life insureds whose life insurance policies had been or were subsequently
purchased or originated by LSC/Peachtree for onward transfer of those life
insurance policies and/or any interest therein to LRT.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 3
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. By way of example, as phrased, the Subpoena would require
all documents and ESI concerning “mortality reports, mortality profiles or LE
Evaluations or projections” whether or not actually made by AVS, so long as AVS
merely “was requested to make” such evaluation. This potentially would require
LSC to make a wholesale production of LE Evaluations that may have been
4
AO 1755333.1

provided by LE Evaluators, as the term is defined in the Subpoena, completely
independent, separate and distinct from AVS, if LSC at any time requested AVS to
make such evaluation in connection therewith.
Request No. 4
All Documents and ESI concerning mortality reports, mortality profiles or
LE Evaluations or projections that AVS made, or AVS was requested to make, on
life insureds whose life insurance policies and/or any interest therein that
LSC/Peachtree considered for onward transfer to LRT.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 4
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. By way of example, as phrased, the Subpoena would require
all documents and ESI concerning “mortality reports, mortality profiles or LE
Evaluations or projections” whether or not actually made by AVS, so long as AVS
merely “was requested to make” such evaluation. This potentially would require
LSC to make a whole production of LE Evaluations that may have been provided
by LE Evaluators, as the term is defined in the Subpoena, completely separate and

5
AO 1755333.1

distinct from AVS, if LSC at any time requested AVS to make such evaluation in
connection therewith.
Request No. 5
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with AVS with regard
to any of the individuals listed on Appendix A hereto, including without limitation
Communications with regard to the LE of those individuals, or with regard to the
transfer, or possible transfer, to LRT of life policies (and/or any interest therein) on
which any of those individuals was an insured life.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 5
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. As phrased, Plaintiffs expressly seek communications
between AVS and LSC regarding approximately 146 life insureds without regard
to, or limitation of, the specific subject matter of the communication that is sought
by discovery.

6
AO 1755333.1

Request No. 6
All documents and ESI concerning the individuals listed on Appendix A
hereto, including but not limited to documents relating to the purchase of the life
policies of those individuals, any medical records or life evaluations of those
individuals and/or Communications with their physicians or other providers of
medical services.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 6
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. This category is particularly vexatious and harassing. As
phrased, by this category, Plaintiffs seek a fishing expedition into every single
document and ESI that in any way relate, refer, describe in any way any of the 146
named life insured referenced on Appendix A to the Subpoena. Such category is in
clear and total disregard for the limitations imposed by Rule 45(c)(1).

7
AO 1755333.1

Request No. 7
All invoices or billings issued by AVS in connection with LE Evaluations,
and all documents and ESI concerning such invoices, billings or payment of same
or concerning LEs referred to in such invoices and billings.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 7
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. The billings and invoices themselves or even
communications between AVS and LSC, if relevant, may be obtained by Plaintiffs
from AVS and, accordingly, LSC further objects to this category as duplicative and
harassing. Moreover, Plaintiffs make no attempt to limit the scope of the
Subpoena to documents or ESI relevant to any issues in the action. As phrased,
this category not only includes all invoices and billings issued by AVS, but also
would require production of all internal documents and ESI relating to all invoices
or billings, including even ministerial or clerical documents relating to issuance of
payment.

8
AO 1755333.1

Request No. 8
All contracts and agreements (including drafts) between AVS and
LSC/Peachtree and all documents and ESI concerning Communications with AVS
regarding any such contracts and agreements.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 8
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. The contracts and agreements between AVS and LSC, if
relevant, may be obtained by Plaintiffs from AVS and, accordingly, LSC further
objects to this category as duplicative and harassing. As phrased, this category
would require production of, among other things, LSC’s own internal documents
and ESI relating to communications with AVS without limitation to any particular
subject matter and would include, by way of example, any e-mails relating to the
time for scheduling a call with a representative of AVS. Again, Rule 45(c)(1) does
not allow parties to misuse their subpoena power in such a fishing expedition.

9
AO 1755333.1

Request No. 9
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with rating agencies or
with entities that provided, or considered providing financial backing (equity, debt
or guaranty) for LSC/Peachtree’s purchase or origination of life policies insofar as
such Communications were concerning i) AVS in any respect, or ii) LE evaluation
generally.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 9
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. Again, Plaintiffs refuse to limit the scope of the Subpoena in
any meaningful or reasonable way. As phrased, Plaintiffs seek, among other
things, production of documents and ESI reflecting or referring to communications
with rating agencies or actual or potential financial backers that themselves refer,
relate, describe, evidence LE evaluation generally. This category is potentially
limitless and again beyond what is permitted by Rule 45.

10
AO 1755333.1

Request No. 10
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with LRT, Babcock &
Brown, Allied Irish Bank of Dublin, Abbey National Bank, IIU, Davy or any other
entity with regard to AVS and its methodologies.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 10
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. As phrased, this category seeks not only production of
documents and ESI concerning communications with six (6) specified named
entities regarding AVS and its methodologies, but also seeks production of
documents and ESI reflecting communications with any entity whatsoever,
including ostensibly Plaintiffs, regarding AVS and its methodologies. To the
extent that Plaintiffs seek communications to which they themselves were parties,
this category is duplicative and harassing.
Request No. 11
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with LRT, Babcock &
Brown, Allied Irish Bank of Dublin, Abbey National Bank, IIU, Davy or any other

11
AO 1755333.1

entity concerning Mortality Experience with respect to LE Evaluations performed
by AVS or other LE Evaluators.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 11
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. Again, because Plaintiffs refuse to limit the scope of the
Subpoena in any meaningful way, this category, as phrased, would require
production of documents and ESI concerning communications with six (6) named
entities, as well as any other entity, regarding Mortality Experience with respect to
LE Evaluations whether or not performed by AVS.
Request No. 12
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with Lloyd’s of
London (including Lloyd’s Syndicate 102), Merlin Underwriting Agency, Ltd.,
Goshawk Syndicate Management Limited, or Gammell Kershaw & Company Ltd.
relating to AVS, LE Evaluations, the CCI or the LEs generally.

12
AO 1755333.1

Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 12
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. As phrased, this category includes documents and ESI
reflecting or relating to communications with four (4) different named entities
regarding topics including LE Evaluations, CCI and LEs generally, without any
reasonable nexus to AVS or the subject matter of this action.
Request No. 13
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with Portsmouth, Life
Benefactors, Hoyle Donnelly, or Larry Simon relating to the LEs generally, or the
methodologies of AVS.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 13
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. Again, Plaintiffs seek production of documents and ESI
concerning communications with four (4) separate entities without limitation to

13
AO 1755333.1

issues in this action. As phrased, this category includes documents and ESI
relating to LEs generally without regard to whether AVS was involved in the
valuation of same.
Request No. 14
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with any investor,
prospective investor, investor representative, investment advisor, investment
vehicle, broker, originator, servicer, trustee or agent relating to AVS, its LEs, its
methodologies, or its Mortality Experience, or relating to LE evaluations generally.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 14
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. As phrased, this category includes documents and ESI
relating to LE Evaluations generally without regard to whether AVS even was
involved in the valuation of same.
Request No. 15
All Documents and ESI concerning Communications with AVS with regard
to remuneration or other benefits paid or to be paid to AVS in connection with
14
AO 1755333.1

AVS’s preparation of LEs, including fees payable in respect of life policies
purchased and not purchased by LSC/Peachtree, or fees payable for any other
service.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 15
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. As phrased, this category would require, among other things,
production of LSC’s own internal ministerial or clerical documents and ESI
regarding payments to AVS for which there is no legitimate basis.
Request No. 16
All documents and ESI concerning LSC/Peachtree’s selection, hiring, and/or
use of AVS to perform Life Evaluations, including LE evaluator criteria or
methods, as well as compensation structure and any incentive targets or goals.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 16
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
15
AO 1755333.1

admissible evidence. As phrased, this category would include LSC’s internal
ministerial or clerical documents and ESI relating to LSC’s selection, hiring or use
of AVS to perform life evaluations. Moreover, LSC specifically objects to this
category as duplicative and harassing. This exact category was the subject of
Request No. 8 of the subpoena served in the above-referenced LRT Arbitration.
Request No. 17
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with AVS, Navisys
Guiding Insurance Solutions, International Underwriting Services, or any other
third-party consulting physician or group of consulting physicians, relating to the
CCI, including but not limited to payment records for services performed by AVS
or others for LE evaluations.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 17
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. As phrased, this category purports to include documents and
ESI concerning communications with three (3) named entities, and unidentified
third parties, concerning not only the five (5) specific CCI policies identified in the

16
AO 1755333.1

definition of “CCI” but also “the concept for such insurance.” Additionally, LSC
objects to this category as duplicative and harassing. This category is substantially
identical to Request No. 9 of the subpoena served in the above-referenced LRT
Arbitration.
Request No. 18
All documents and ESI concerning the policies or practices of
LSC/Peachtree for the preservation and/or destruction of records.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 18
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC specifically
objects to this category as duplicative and harassing. This exact category was the
subject of Request No. 13 of the subpoena served in the above-referenced LRT
Arbitration. Plaintiffs’ successive, identical requests for documents as harassing
and appear calculated only to harass and otherwise burden LSC, a non-party.
Request No. 19
All documents and ESI concerning the methodologies and/or factors that
LSC/Peachtree used to calculate the purchase price for life policies.

17
AO 1755333.1

Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 19
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. LSC’s calculation of the purchase price for life insurance
policies acquired is not at issue in this action.
Request No. 20
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with Phil Loy, AVS,
AVS’s counsel or other representatives, including but not limited to all
Communications between representatives or counsel of LSC/Peachtree and
representatives or counsel of AVS, regarding this litigation or regarding the
arbitrations pending between LRT and Syndicate 102.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 20
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. LSC further objects to the extent that this category includes
expressly documents and ESI protected as attorney-client communications,

18
AO 1755333.1

attorney work product or are otherwise immune from discovery under a joint
defense or common interest privilege. Moreover, LSC objects to this category on
grounds that to the extent that this information is discoverable at all it may be
obtained through AVS, a party to this action, and thus, this category is duplicative
and harassing.
Request No. 21
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with LRT, LRT’s
counsel Seward & Kissel or other representatives, including but not limited to all
Communications between representatives or counsel for LSC/Peachtree and
representatives or counsel for LRT regarding this litigation.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 21
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. LSC further objects to the extent that this category includes
expressly documents and ESI protected as attorney-client communications,
attorney work product or are otherwise immune from discovery under a joint
defense or common interest privilege. Moreover, LSC objects to this category on

19
AO 1755333.1

grounds that to the extent that this information is discoverable at all it may be
obtained through LRT, a party to a separate arbitration, and thus, this category is
duplicative and harassing.
Request No. 22
All LSC/Peachtree brochures, organizational charts, and all business cards
(including but not limited to Craig M. Lessner, Jeffrey K. Nipp, Sergio Salani, Lori
Wengatz, James Terlizzi, and Timothy Trankina) over the relevant period.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 22
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC specifically
objects to this category as duplicative and harassing. This exact category was the
subject of Request No. 23 of the subpoena serve din the above-referenced LRT
Arbitration. Plaintiffs’ successive, identical requests for documents are harassing
and appears calculated only to harass and otherwise burden LSC, a non-party.
Request No. 23
All documents and ESI concerning Communications with consultants
regarding the Mortality Experience of AVS, life expectancy evaluations prepared
by AVS, or life expectancy methodology used by AVS, or regarding eligibility
certifications delivered to the Trustee relating to life insurance policies.
20
AO 1755333.1

Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 23
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. Among other things, Plaintiffs do not define in any way the
word “consultants” as used in this category. Moreover, LSC specifically objects to
this category as duplicative and harassing. This exact category was the subject of
Request No. 8 of the subpoena served in the above-referenced LRT Arbitration.
Request No. 24
All documents and ESI concerning Dr. Carl Neuman, including but not
limited to (i) Dr. Neuman’s employment history with LSC/Peachtree, (ii) any
contracts between Dr. Neuman and LSC/Peachtree, and (iii) LSC/Peachtree
Communications with Dr. Neuman in which Dr. Neuman was either the author or a
recipient regarding AVS, Phil Loy or any of the individuals listed on Appendix A.
Peachtree’s Response to Request No. 24
Subject to and without waiver of its General Objections, LSC further objects
to this category of documents and ESI on grounds that the category is overbroad,
unduly vague, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to

21
AO 1755333.1

admissible evidence. LSC’s employment of Dr. Neuman is not related to any of
the claims asserted by Plaintiffs in this action and is little more than an
impermissible fishing expedition.
In addition to the foregoing, Peachtree provided the following “General
Objections” to the entire Subpoena:
1.

LSC objects generally to requests for documents and deposition set

forth in the Subpoena as violative of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(c)(1),
which expressly states that, “[a] party or an attorney responsible for the issuance
and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue
burden and expense on a person that is subject to that subpoena.” The Subpoena
served by Plaintiffs purports to require LSC to produce documents and
electronically-stored information (ESI) in response to twenty-four (24)
broadly-worded categories and to make its representative(s) available for
deposition on twenty-four (24) similarly broadly-worded topics. The production of
documents and ESI in response to the Subpoena and submission of LSC’s
representatives to testify on the topics for which testimony is sought by the
Subpoena would impose upon LSC an undue burden and expense in contravention
of the directives of Rule 45(c).

22
AO 1755333.1

2.

Pursuant to Rule 45(d)(1)(D), LSC objects generally to the production

of ESI on grounds that such information is not reasonably accessible because of
undue burden or cost. Plaintiffs have defined “ESI” broadly to include information
in electronic form contained in “any media or device, including computer hard
drives, disks, CD’s DVD’s, personal computers, personal digital assistants,
Blackberries (or comparable devices), voice mails, memory sticks, and jump
drives, and includes all backups of such data.” As phrased, this Subpoena purports
to require LSC to search every server, desktop, PDA, Blackberry, disk or storage
media or device of any kind to determine if there are documents responsive to the
twenty-four (24) broadly-worded categories of ESI sought by the Subpoena.
3.

LSC objects generally to this Subpoena as harassing and burdensome.

This Subpoena is duplicative of an identical subpoena issued by Plaintiffs from the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and served upon
LSC at its offices in Florida. The subpoenas seek the production of the same
documents and ESI at the same date and time (August 13, 2007 at 9:30 a.m.) in
both Florida and Georgia and further to make available LSC’s representatives for
deposition on the same topics at the same date and time (August 28, 2007) in both
Florida and Georgia.

23
AO 1755333.1

4.

LSC further objects generally to this Subpoena as substantially

duplicative of a subpoena duces tecum dated December 28, 2006, that Plaintiffs
caused to be issued in the arbitration styled In the matter of the Arbitration
Between Life Receivables Trust and Syndicate 102 at Lloyd’s of London, ICDR
No. 50-195-T-00372-05 (the “LRT Arbitration”), for which LSC timely asserted
detailed objections that have not yet been ruled upon by the arbitration panel. This
Subpoena is little more than an attempt by Plaintiffs to shop for a forum willing to
permit Plaintiffs’ fishing expedition.
5.

LSC objects to the Subpoena on the grounds that Goshawk is

attempting to misuse this Court’s subpoena power to obtain documents and other
information to which it has no right under the CCI policies.
6.

LSC objects generally to the “Definitions” and “Instructions” sections

of the Subpoena to the extent that they purport to impose obligations beyond the
requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
7.

LSC objects generally to the “Documents and ESI Subject to

Subpoena” section of the Subpoena that seek production of “any,” “all,” or “any
and all” documents to the extent that Plaintiffs purport to require LSC to do more
than use reasonable diligence to locate responsive and non-privileged or
24
AO 1755333.1

non-protected documents and ESI based upon an examination of those files that
reasonably may be expected to yield such documents or ESI. As phrased, the
Subpoena is vague, ambiguous, unduly burdensome, vexatious and not reasonably
calculated to lead to admissible evidence.
8.

LSC objects to the Subpoena to the extent that Plaintiffs purport to

require production of documents and ESI that are privileged as attorney-client
communications, immune from production as attorney work product, or otherwise
immune from production on the basis of any legally-recognized privilege,
including without limitation common interest and/or joint defense. LSC reserves
its right under Rule 45 to provide its “description of the nature of the documents,
communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding
party to contest the claim,” upon this Court’s determination of these objections.
9.

LSC objects generally to the Subpoena to the extent that Plaintiffs

purport to seek production of LSC’s trade secret and/or confidential and
proprietary information that may be contained within the Subpoena’s
broadly-worded, vague and ambiguous categories of documents. As phrased, the
Subpoena may be construed to require production of information that LSC

25
AO 1755333.1

considers to be its trade secrets or otherwise confidential and proprietary business
information.
10.

LSC objects generally to the Subpoena to the extent that Plaintiffs

purport to require production of documents and ESI that contains any life insured’s
“protected health information” as defined in the federal Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), or which is otherwise
protected from disclosure under applicable state or federal law. Among other
things, state law in Georgia, the state in which the action is pending in federal
court, restricts the ability of a life settlement provider to disclose to third parties a
life insured’s medical condition. See O.C.G.A. §33-59-6. The constitutional right
to privacy contained in the Florida Constitution has been similarly found to protect
against disclosure of personal information, including information regarding an
individual’s medical condition.
11.

LSC objects generally to the extent that Plaintiffs purport to request

production of documents outside of LSC’s possession, custody or control.
12.

LSC objects to the Subpoena under Rule 45 on grounds that, to the

extent that any portion of the information sought is discoverable, Plaintiffs have
failed to allow reasonable time for compliance.
26
AO 1755333.1

13.

LSC objects generally to the time period that Plaintiffs purport to

cover by the Subpoena, which is from January 1, 1998 to the present, as overbroad,
unduly vague and burdensome.
Plaintiffs and Peachtree attempted to meet and confer on these objections
and to resolve the issues listed above. Unfortunately, these meet and confer efforts
have not resolved the dispute, necessitating the instant motion. As explained in
Plaintiffs’ accompanying memorandum of law filed in support of this motion to
compel, Peachtree’s objections have no basis in fact or law and do not outweigh
Plaintiffs’ right to obtain the information under the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the Court to enter an Order compelling
Peachtree to produce the documents requested in the Subpoena.
A proposed order is filed herewith.
