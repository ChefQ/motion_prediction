Plaintiff Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ("CSHL") hereby opposes Defendants' Ropes &
Gray's ("R&G") and Matthew Vincent's ("Vincent") Motions to Dismiss the Amended
Complaint pursuant To FED. R. Crv. P. 12(b)(6).

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1999, CSHL scientist Dr. Gregory Hannon began research that rapidly lead to his
invention of a breakthrough technology that, in simplest terms, allows researchers to turn genes
"off" in mammalian cells and animals. (See generally, Amended Complaint, D.L# 107
("Amended Complaint"), at 0x00A70x00A7 7, 18.) CSHL and Dr. Hannon entrusted Defendants Ropes &
Gray (R&G) and its former partner Matthew Vincent with securing patents to Dr. Hannon's
invention. As CSHL's patent counsel, Vincent was responsible for drafting an original
description of Dr Hannon's invention distinguishing his invention from what others have already
done or described in the prior art. Vincent failed to perform this fundamental responsibility. In
drafting Dr. Hannon's patent applications, Vincent instead resorted to copying large portions of a
published patent application describing older technology (the Fire application). (/d. at {0x00A7 9, 27,
44.) Compounding his negligent drafting, Vincent expressly (but erroneously) directed the
patent examiner during prosecution to the copied Fire text as purportedly describing Dr.
Hannon's different invention. (Id. at F{ 35, 36.)

The "short hairpin" technology Dr. Hannon invented represented a breakthrough over the
prior art. (See, e.g., Declaration of Peter I. Bernstein ("Bernstein Decl."), Ex. A, Response to
August 30, 2010 Non-Final Office Action). Vincent knew or should have known that merely
copying prior art text would never serve to describe the innovative features of Dr. Hannon's new
approach. It did not. Vincent's slipshod work: 1) failed to show the PTO how Dr. Hannon's

invention is distinguishable from the prior art, including, but not limited to, the Fire patent
Case 1:11-cv-10128-RGS Document 114 Filed 09/09/11 Page 7 of 24

(Amended Complaint at { 42); 2) thwarted CSHL's efforts to obtain "short hairpin" claims
through the erroneous perception that Dr. Hannon had not invented anything new Cd. at { 45);
and 3) failed to provide proper priority support for such claims (/d. at 0x00A7 33). As result of
Vincent's negligence, the Hannon applications have languished in examination for a decade.
Defendants improperly seek dismissal of CSHL's complaint by factually arguing the
extent to which Vincent's negligence delayed or prevented issuance of claims directed to Dr.
Hannon's short hairpin technology. But such factual arguments as to causation have no merit in
a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Nonetheless, having billed CSHL more than half a million
dollars, Defendants now cynically contend Dr. Hannon was never entitled to a patent in the first
place and that their mishandling of CSHL's patent applications was therefore completely
excusable because it was not the "but for" cause of CSHL's failure to obtain patent claims.
Much of Defendants' argument relies on a misreading of CSHL's complaint. According
to Defendants, the only prejudice alleged by CSHL was limited to the PTO's rejection of short
hairpin claims based on Fire. On the contrary, Vincent's negligence caused far more damage.
Vincent's negligent prosecution left CSHL both with a compromised patent application and an
erroneous perception within the PTO that Dr. Hannon's short hairpin technology had already
been developed by others. The lack of a properly drafted disclosure has frustrated CSHL
attempts to explain to the Patent Office the patentable distinctions between Dr. Hannon's short
hairpin RNA technology and the prior art and, thus, overcome rejections based on Fire as well as
other prior art. The specific references in CSHL's Amended Complaint to the PTO's rejections
based on Fire merely illustrate one example of how Defendants' conduct severely compromised

CSHL's ability to obtain allowance of claims to the technology Dr. Hannon invented. The basis
Case 1:11-cv-10128-RGS Document 114 Filed 09/09/11 Page 8 of 24

for CSHL's claims extends well beyond evidence relating to the rejections over Fire. If there is
any doubt to that in Defendants' minds, it should be dispelled now.

With respect to the remaining claims for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence,
Defendants' motion is also based on factual issues of causation. Because these issues are not
amenable to disposition on a Rule 12 motion to dismiss, Defendants motion as to these
remaining claims should also be denied.

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Founded in 1890, CSHL is a private, not-for-profit research and education
institution at the forefront of efforts in molecular biology and genetics to generate knowledge
that will yield better diagnostics and treatments for cancer, neurological diseases and other major
causes of human suffering. (Amended Complaint at 0x00A7 13.) CSHL has been home to eight Nobel
Laureates, including James D. Watson who, along with Francis Crick, discovered the double-
helical structure of DNA. (/d. at 14.) Today, CSHL is one of the world's most influential
cancer research centers. (/d. at J 14.)

Inventor Dr. Gregory Hannon is a Professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute
Investigator at CSHL. (Ud. at 0x00A7 7.) The Hannon Laboratory at CSHL is focused on the study of a
cellular mechanism called RNA interference ("RNAi") and the application of RNAi as a cancer
research tool. (Amended Complaint at {{ 7, 18.) Generally, RNAi refers to the process by
which double stranded RNA functions to help regulate when genes are turned off and on in the
cell. Ud. at | 7.) Through his work at CSHL, Dr. Hannon developed inventive methods and
technologies to exploit RNAi as a research tool in mammalian cells, which Dr. Hannon achieved
by engineering RNA molecules called short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). (See id. See also

generally Bernstein Decl., Ex. A at 5-11.) Importantly, the particular structure of these
Case 1:11-cv-10128-RGS Document 114 Filed 09/09/11 Page 9 of 24

engineered RNA molecules, when stably expressed within a mammalian cell, allowed them to
effectively regulate gene expression without having a deleterious, toxic effect on the cell. (See
Amended Complaint at 0x00A7 29, Bernstein Decl., Ex. A at 9-10.)

Dr. Hannon's discovery was a breakthrough advance over other prior art, including the
long-stranded RNA technology developed by Dr. Andrew Fire ("Fire"), which failed to provide a
solution to how one could use RNA interference in mammalian cells without killing the cells,
among other deficiencies. (See Amended Complaint at {J 7, 29; Bernstein Decl., Ex. A at 8-11.)
Dr. Hannon's 2002 Genes & Development paper, "Short Hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) induce
sequence-specific gene silencing in mammalian cells" reported much of the work underlying the
presently claimed invention. For the four years after it was published, it was one of the most
highly cited papers in molecular biology and genetics. (See Bernstein Decl., Ex. A at 11; id., Ex.
B, March 22, 2011 Interview Slides at 17.) Dr. Hannon's research on RNA interference was
recognized by Science magazine as the Breakthrough of the Year in 2002 and in 2005 by Esquire
as a Breakthrough of the Decade. (Amended Complaint at 0x00A7 18; Bernstein Decl., Ex. A at 10-
11.) Since Dr. Hannon's invention, use of shRNA for gene silencing and regulation has become
a valuable and widely adopted technology, which is used today in many different fields of
medical and pharmaceutical research. (Amended Complaint at { 17; Bernstein Decl., Ex. A at
10-11.)

A. Facts Relating to Malpractice

CSHL's complaint contains over 50 paragraphs of detailed allegations relating to the
claim for malpractice, none of which are disputed by Defendants in their motion. Well beyond

simple notice pleading, the Complaint explains in great detail, how R&G, and Vincent in
 

Case 1:11-cv-10128-RGS Document 114 Filed 09/09/11 Page 10 of 24

particular, committed malpractice through their failure to conduct the prosecution according to a
reasonable standard of care.

As alleged, Vincent copied 11 pages of text from a patent application published by Fire
("Fire application") relating to Dr. Fire's long-stranded RNA technology into the Hannon
applications.' (Amended Complaint at Ff 9, 24.) About one-half of the "Detailed Description"
of the invention section of the Hannon applications consisted of text copied verbatim from the
Fire application. (/d. at 0x00A7 9, 27.) By merely copying text from the Fire application, Vincent
failed to describe critical distinctions between Dr. Hannon's shRNA technology and the prior art,
which had provided no solution for how to successfully exploit RNA interference to regulate
gene expression in mammalian cells.

To make matters worse, Defendants relied on and misrepresented the copied text of Fire
as describing Dr. Hannon's invention in statements before the PTO (/d. at {0x00A7 35, 36.)
Defendants made these misstatements knowing they would have to eventually distinguish Fire
during prosecution once the PTO became aware of it. (Amended Complaint at { 28.)

The patent examiner relied on these very representations in issuing a notice of allowance
of claims of one of the pending Hannon applications in 2005. (/d. at 0x00A7 38.) But Defendants'
negligent prosecution finally caught up with them. As CSHL anticipated the issuance of claims,

an event that ordinarily follows a notice of allowance, the examiner instead abruptly withdrew

 

' Arguing that the acts giving rise to the malpractice were not a breach of the standard of
care for a patent practitioner, Defendants cite - but do not attach - an opinion in the form of
hearsay from a book entitled PATENT IT YOURSELF. (R&G's Memorandum of Law in
Support of Its Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint ("Defs. Memo.") at 4, fn. 3.) This
layperson's reference, which purportedly states that copying is an accepted practice in patent
drafting because patents are not copyrightable, does not address the professional standard of
care. Here, the unattached book, directed towards the non-professional, does not pass muster
under any of FED. R. EvIp. 0x00A70x00A7 702, 802, and 901.
