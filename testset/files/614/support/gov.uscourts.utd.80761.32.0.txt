Immediate Injunction [sic] For Release of Educational Transcript" and Request for Attorney's

MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
Plaintiff moves the Court for sanctions against Defendants' counsel, Robert H. Wilde,
Bruce M. Franson, Associates working on this case, and Defendants under
Utah R.Civ.P. 11 and Fed.R.Civ.P.11. Plaintiff argues that Defendants' counsel violated
Rule 11(b) by filing motions and other legal documentation which included false,
unsubstantiated claims against Plaintiff, filing voluminous motions and responses to
Plaintiffs motions that do not directly involve Defendants or their counsel, violating
Plaintiffs right to privacy, making implications to the court that certain actions have
taken place when they have not, and by filing their most recent memoranda (Dockets 26
and 27),
Plaintiff further moves the Court for sanctions against Defense Counsel, Robert H.
Wilde, Bruce M. Franson, Associates assisting on this case and Defendants under 28
U.S.C.A, 0x00A7 1927, for multiplying pretrial proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously.
This statute permits "sanctions against attorney[s] who multiplies proceedings
unreasonable and vexatiously" because the "court has inherent power to impose variety
of sanctions to regulate its docket, promote judicial efficiency and deter frivolous

filings". Id.

A "Certificate of Good Faith" is attached to this Motion.

AFFIDAVIT OF FACTS

I, Jesse A. Majors, having been sworn and being under oath, hereby allege as follows:

Yam the Plaintiff in this lawsuit.

When I refer to Defense Counsel, I mean to include Robert H. Wilde, Bruce M, Franson

and all associates that have worked on this claim. I also incorporate Defendants as liable

for providing false information and/or directing Defense Counsel's misconduct.

I believe that I have a valid legal claim for this motion. The elements of this claim

include:

a. I filed an application to proceed in forma pauperis. This involves issues between
only the judge and I and does not directly involve the defense in any way.
Responding to this application was Defense Counsels' first and unwarranted
delay. It makes it even more egregious because it involves personal information
Defense Counsel should not have been allowed access to in order to make a
response, I am under the impression, and it has been confirmed by the court that
my Motion to Proceed Jn Forma Pauperis and its information are sealed and
inaccessible to the Defendants. Hence, the only conceivable way for defense to
gain access to said motion was through illegal means. For, if defense claims they
did not access those documents, what business is it of theirs to oppose
proceedings in forma pauperis? It seems their motive is retaliatory in nature and
in trying to gain an unfair advantage over me as much as possible.

b. If Defense Counsel did not access my private information, then they most

certainly filed an objection motion arbitrarily and vexatiously. Without the

pertinent information contained in the in forma pauperis application, Defense

Counsel would have no basis for filing the motion, Therefore, they filed the

 

motion objecting to my application in contravention to the very case they referred
to in their motion requesting an award for attorney fees (Chambers v, NASCO,
501 U.S. 32 (1991)).

Mr. Wilde recently sent me an email in which he states that he has "some
suggestions on places you might get some assistance so that we can focus on the
core issues of your claims and spend less time in the procedural periphery." Yet
when I motioned the court to provide me the assistance of the kind he is talking
about, he motioned the court against me. These inconsistencies are unfair and
should be treated by the court as such. Defense Counsel should want to handle
this lawsuit in the appropriate manner, against a represented litigant in a fair
environment, with equally represented parties. Defense Counsel seems to express
an unprofessional and unethical motive against it.

Forcing me to respond to false allegations is another valid basis for granting me
monetary sanctions against Defense Counsel. For example, Defense Counsel
stated that I was "expelled for not gaining the requisite skills for a legal degree or
attain the level of a legal professional." This was a blatant lie. At the time of that
statement, I had not been expelled. It was only in response to my motion to the
court for an injunction to release my transcripts, (again, proof of Defense

Counsel's retaliatory, unethical behavior), that a letter was sent to me from

Thomas Jefferson School of Law, dated July 22, 2011, stating my registration as a
student was suspended.

If Defense Counsel had made a reasonable investigation into the facts surrounding
this claim, it would have been revealed that no such documentation existed at that
time that showed I had been expelled from the law school. Because this was a lie
and is now in a legal document, Defense Counsel should be discharged from this
case and sanctioned appropriately for lying about me. In addition, because this
statement could end up negatively affecting me in the future, if not corrected and
retracted, Defense Counsel should be required to retract this statement as well.
Defense Counsel has been put on notice that Defendant law school and
Defendants Rudy Hasl, Beth Kransberger, Eric Mitnick, Jeff Joseph and Claudia

Ferguson have denied my access to my transcripts, which I have a legal right to. |

 

submitted an injunction and instead of Defense Counsel ensuring that I had copies
of my transcripts sent to the appropriate persons as noted in the Injunction so that
I could get on with my life and career, they chose to file this baseless response.
They chose to file this baseless motion when they should have placed more
importance on getting those transcripts sent out before deadlines. Their
purposeful misprioritizing and ignorance of more important matters, key to
finding honorable, well-paying, employment in the legal field, is hindering the
furtherance of my career, resulting in damages, at least as much as their alleged
attorney fees are, but more likely a greater amount, (completely justifiable in

awarding to me instead as sanctions for their purposeful ignorant behavior.)

Case 2:11-cv-00558-CW -SA Document 32 Filed 08/10/11 Page 8 of 16

In their most recent motion (Docket 27), Defense Counsel lied again. Defense
Counsel stated, in regards to my request for the release of transcripts, "Plaintiff
has submitted a motion, not supported by any memorandum... and not supported
by any affidavit or declaration... it is the Defendant's policy to issue transcripts
for students and prior students upon the receipt of a completed standard transcript
request form which the Defendant does not show the Plaintiff has submitted."

One of the largest sections in my "Memorandum Supporting Opposition to
Defendant's Motion To Dismiss", entitled "Constitutional Violations",
"Transcripts", included exact wording from emails from Defendants where |
asked for my transcripts and was systematically denied. I also related an
especially discriminatory, harassing incident in which I requested transcripts over
the phone, was ignored, transferred to Defendant Eric Mitnick where I left a voice
message and still received no response. I also factually stated I have a letter
confirming my request for transcripts be sent to the State Bar of California, I
factually stated I have copies of fax transmittals confirming receipt by Thomas
Jefferson School of Law of my transcript request. These documents are part of
the discovery process to be obtained and it is also Defense Counsel's
responsibility to make reasonable inquiries into facts before making baseless,
false statements. Again, I direct the court to the same case law Defense Counsel
had referred to regarding when awarding attorney fees is appropriate to prove to

the court that Defense Counsel is more egregiously guilty of doing exactly what
Case 2:11-cv-00558-CW -SA Document 32 Filed 08/10/11 Page 9 of 16

 

 

 

87 they are accusing me of and | am the appropriate person to be awarded fees

88 (Chambers v. NASCO, 501 U.S. 32 (1991)).

89 h, I would like to bring to the court's attention, that Defense Counsel has just

90 provided prima facie evidence that Defendants have violated my Constitutional

91 Rights to have access to my educational records, to be free from a hostile

92 educational environment and to be free from discrimination and harassment. In

93 Docket 27, Defense Counsel stated, "it is the Defendant's policy to issue

94 transcripts for students and prior students upon the receipt of a completed

95 standard transcript request form which the Defendant does not show the Plaintiff

96 has submitted. Plaintiff should be aware that any transcript from the Defendant

97 will reflect her removal as a student."

98 i, If Defendants had sent me transcripts as 1 requested, then I would have been

99 notified of my academic status. I argued exactly the same. I was never notified
100 of my academic status! I was threatened many times with expulsion, but it never
101 happened, I argue that Defendants used the threat of expulsion to intimidate me
102 and harass me into making bad decisions, hurt my educational experience and
103 inflict emotional distress. Indeed, not only did I provide facts, documentation,
104 names of persons involved in violating my rights, but I copied and pasted emails
105 into the body of my "Amended Complaint" demonstrating the harassing nature of
106 Defendants, especially Rudy Hasl, when I simply asked why I was denied a
107 transcript request. Rudy Hasl berated me, called me names and insulted me for an

k,

entire paragraph via email, never even responding to the transcript request
portion!

Because Defense Counsel just admitted that Defendants violated my
constitutional rights by not sending me transcripts, this case must go to trial! I
have the right to present evidence to prove my claim and disprove their lies
against me,

Defense Counsel again lied to the court in their "Memorandum Opposing Motion
To Set Aside Order Restricting E-Filing Access". Defense Counsel falsely stated
that I filed a Rule 60(b)(2) motion, I did no such thing. Defense Counsel stated,
"Plaintiff brings this motion under Rule 60(b)(2) Fed. R. Civ. P., which provides
for relief where there is newly discovered evidence... Plaintiff fails to describe
that newly discovered evidence and has certainly not listed it in her Affidavit of
Facts in Support of Motion." This is a blatant falsehood. I never suggested that I
was submitting new evidence and I never referred to said rule.

In this same memorandum, Defense Counsel implied that I had requested the
court to reverse the entire order made by Magistrate Judge Samuel Alba in
regards to e-filing, However, if Defense Counsel had taken the time to read my
motion properly, they would have understood from its contents that I had agreed
to not file documents electronically, but was unwilling to waive my right to
receive notices via U.S. Postal Service. This unjustly implies that I am blatantly
disregarding Judge Alba's order. I did no such thing and have every right to

request a re-evaluation of such Order.
