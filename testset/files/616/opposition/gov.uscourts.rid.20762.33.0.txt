DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
OBJECTION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM
Plaintiffs have not articulated any basis for granting their Motion to File
Supplemental Memorandum with regard to the State’s Motion to Dismiss, which already
has been briefed, including expanded briefing opportunities, and argued before this court.
The issue before this court is not whether the honorable Judge Anthony Ishii of the
Eastern District of California and the honorable Chief Judge William K. Sessions III of
the District of Vermont correctly decided the Motions for Summary Judgment and to

Dismiss, respectively before them. The issue is whether this court has jurisdiction to hear
Plaintiffs’ allegations in the above-captioned case, based on this court’s independent
review of the appropriate federal statutes, the briefs filed in this case, and the oral
argument presented in this case. While the travel of the cases that these Plaintiffs have
mounted in other federal districts is certainly of interest to the parties in this case, and to
this court, the conclusions reached by the federal courts in California and Vermont were
not based on the information presented to this court, nor was the summary judgment
motion based on the same standard of review. If supplemental memorandum is allowed
in this case to discuss the findings made by Judge Ishii in his decision on the State of
California’s Motion for Summary Judgment on The Issue of Ripeness, the parties will
present only their respective opinions on the logic, or lack thereof in Judge Ishii’s
conclusions. The State respectfully suggests, that this court can reach its own
conclusions, without supplemental briefing, about whether Judge Ishii’s decision is sound
and well-reasoned and whether it should have any bearing on the State’s Motion now
pending before this court.
