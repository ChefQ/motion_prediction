PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF OBJECTION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFFS’ EXHIBIT A (ATTACHED TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM)

Defendant moves to strike Exhibit A to Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Support of
Motion to File Supplemental Memorandum on the grounds that it purportedly is in violation of
Local Rule Cv 7(b). This contention is without merit. Plaintiffs followed the requirements of
§(b)(3) of Local Rule Cv 7 and filed their motion seeking leave of this Court to file a
supplemental memorandum in the form attached as Exhibit A to the supporting memorandum.
Plaintiffs have not filed an additional memorandum of law without having been granted leave of
court to do so, as alleged by the Defendant. To the contrary, Plaintiffs’ motion seeks leave from
this Court to file the supplemental memorandum.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny Defendant’s Motion to
Strike and grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Memorandum for the reasons
set forth in their motion.
