DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFFS’ EXHIBIT A
Plaintiffs attached an “exhibit”, labeled as Exhibit A, to their Motion for Leave to
File Supplemental Memorandum. Exhibit A, however, is Plaintiffs’ Supplemental
Memorandum of Law, and is not appropriately attached as an exhibit to a Motion
requesting leave to file same. Moreover, filing additional memorandum of law without
having been granted leave of court to do so, regardless of how the memorandum is

labeled is a violation of LR Cv 7(b)(3) which provides:
No memorandum other than a memorandum in support of a
motion, a memorandum in opposition, and a reply
memorandum may be filed without prior leave of the Court.

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that Plaintiffs’ Exhibit
A be stricken from the record.
