JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO EXPEDITE
Function Media has no objection to an expedited and agreed schedule for briefing

on Dauberl motions. Function Media's objection here is that Google's
schedule as to Mr. Bratic is way too rushed and premature

-

proposed

taking place literally at the

same time as six other expert depositions, over Christmas, and

with a proposed hearing

date before expert discovery is completed. Google has proposed a hearing date on this
issue on January 5, at the same time as the currently-scheduled hearing over exhibit and

deposition objections. Such a schedule makes no sense given the timing and the expert
discovery here. Google has given no reason for why

it is necessary to create such an

extreme schedule just to have the hearing date on January

5. This Court

can and should

hold a Daubert hearing after January 5 - when expert discovery is completed and to give
some minimum time for briefing.

Function Media represents that

it will be extraordinarily difficult for it to file

response to the forthcomin g Daubert motion against Mr. Bratic in

just one week

a

because

of the schedule for expert discovery and other pretrial matters.I During that same week,

t

Moreover, holidays notwithstanding, there is no good reason why Google compresses the schedule on
Function Media to force an opposition within one week, while proposing to give itself a further week

Function Media must also prepare and defend Mr. Bratic for deposition; prepare for and

take the deposition of Google's damages expert, Mr. Wagner; and attend to a host of
other pretrial matters (not to mention prepare for the holidays). Google thus proposes to

significantly shorten Function Media's time to respond to Google's forthcoming motion,
while also placing the response period at a uniquely inconvenient and burdensome time.
Moreover, Function Media intends to file a Daubert motion of its own against
Google's damages expert, Mr. Wagner. Function Media is not in the position to file that

motion by December 16 - nor does it believe
Wagner's deposition on December

it

should be forced to do so, prior to Mr.

22. To be sure,

Google's motion does not seek to

require Function Media to move against Mr. Wagner early. But because Google knows
that Function Media

will not file by December

16, Google seeks a tactical advantage in

having its Dauberl motion heard before Function Media's. That makes no sense. This
Court should take up each side's damages motions at the same time and on a schedule
that accommodates appropriate filing and reply dates.
Google complains that it would be unfair to hear its Daubert motion later, because

it requires clarity on the Daubert issues for its pretrial preparation. But, to the extent
there is even any "time crunch" on hearing Daubert issues, the fault lies entirely with
Google itself. Google suggested pushing back the various dates for expert reports -- on

four different occasions. See Exh. A (Google email of October 22 asking to push back
opening reports); Exh.
reports another time

B (Google request of October 23 to push back opening

- until November 3); Exh.

expert

C (Google email of October 29 asking for

extension of rebuttal reports until November 24); Exhibit D (Google email of November
simply to file a reply brief. If Google were concemed about the burden on ûre parties by its proposed
expàdited sctreduÈ, it would forego a reply brief andlor accord Function Media ûre full amount of time
allowed by the rules to respond to its motion.

asking for extension

to Nov 25). At each point, Function Media

consented to

Google's request. But because of those extensions, Google now asks for a rushed

-

schedule

with opening briefs

due

just two days from now on Wednesday December

and responses due one week later on December

23. During this one-week

16

period, the

preparation and depositions of the damages experts Walter Bratic and Michael Wagner

will

occur,

in addition to the deposition of one of the inequitable

conduct experts.

Google's schedule has replies due on December 30, but in addition to the Christmas

holiday, the preparation and deposition

of the other

inequitable conduct expert is

scheduled to occur during this timeframe, and the depositions of the parties' technical
experts are scheduled on December 30 and 31, respectively.2

Function Media has been trying to work with Google on an agreed schedule, but
Google has insisted on the schedule it proposes to the Court and has refused to consider

Function Media's altemative proposal or even to explain why

it is necessary to have a

hearing on January 5 as opposed to some other date before trial. See Exh E; Exh. F; Exh.

G (emails from Function Media counsel to Google asking to meet and confer on this
issue, explaining the hardships and the issues

in Google's proposed schedule, and asking

why a hearing date on January 5 is necessary)'
Function Media agrees with Google on one key point

- the parties should agree

on a briefing schedule. The disagreement is whether the briefing and hearing should take
place before or after expert discovery is complete

- a seeming prerequisite

for a Daubert

hearing. Thus, Function Media respectfully requests the following briefing

2

It is also no answer to say that the

damages Daubert motions

will concern only the damages experts,

because both damages experts rely in part on the technical experts.
