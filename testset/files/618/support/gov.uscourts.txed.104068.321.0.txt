Function Media, L.L.C. v. Google, Inc. et al

Doc. 321

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
MARSHALL DIVISION

FUNCTION MEDIA, L.L.C.,
v.

Civil Case No. 2:07-CV-279 (CE)
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

GOOGLE, INC. AND YAHOO!, INC.

EXPEDITED MOTION TO EXPEDITE BRIEFING AND CONSIDERATION OF
GOOGLE’S DAUBERT MOTION TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN TESTIMONY AND
OPINIONS OF MR. WALTER BRATIC

Google Inc. respectfully requests that the Court expedite briefing and argument on
Google’s intended Daubert Motion to Exclude Certain Testimony and Opinions of Mr. Walter
Bratic. Google’s Daubert Motion regarding Mr. Bratic -- the only Daubert motion that Google
intends to file -- will principally concern Mr. Bratic’s improper reliance on Google’s acquisitions
of entire companies in connection with his reasonable royalty analysis under Georgia Pacific
Corp. v. U.S. Plywood Corp., 318 F. Supp. 1116 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). These issues are inextricably
intertwined with Google’s Motion In Limine No. 10, which was fully briefed and argued at the
December 4, 2009 Pretrial Conference, and issues regarding the admissibility of evidence
regarding Google’s acquisitions to be addressed at the January 5, 2010 evidentiary hearing.
Accordingly, it is most efficient for all parties and the Court to have the hearing on Google’s
Daubert Motion on that same date. Moreover, Google requests that its Daubert Motion be heard
on January 5, 2010 so that Google can appropriately prepare for trial on January 19, 2010.

Google thus proposes the following schedule so that this Court can hear Google’s
Daubert Motion on January 5, 2010:1
December 16, 2009: Opening Brief Due
December 23, 2009: Response Due
December 30, 2009: Reply Due
January 5, 2010:

Hearing

Function Media opposes this request on the basis that “a condensed schedule in the midst
of expert depositions and Christmas so that the hearing can be on January 5 is prejudicial.”
(Ex. A.) The proposed schedule, however, is not prejudicial to Function Media, whose
opposition is due before Christmas. In fact, if anyone is disadvantaged by the proposed
schedule, it is Google. Under the proposed schedule, Google’s Daubert Motion regarding
Mr. Bratic would be filed two days before Mr. Bratic’s December 18, 2009 deposition. Not only
would Google not be able to refer to Mr. Bratic’s testimony in its Motion, but Function Media
would be able to use Google’s Motion to prepare Mr. Bratic for his deposition.
Despite these disadvantages, Google requests expedited briefing and consideration of its
Daubert Motion regarding Mr. Bratic so that Google can adequately prepare for the January 19,
2010 trial. The issues to be addressed in Google’s Daubert Motion will impact whether certain
fact witnesses will need to testify at all, the scope of other fact witnesses’ testimony, and the
scope of the parties’ damages experts’ testimony. If Google will need to conduct a mini-trial on
each of its acquisitions, Google needs to know that as soon as possible to prepare appropriately
and to line up necessary witnesses.

The Court’s January 24, 2008 Docket Control Order (Dkt. No. 45) set October 2, 2009
as the deadline for filing Daubert motions. However, because of changes to the timing of the
claim construction hearing, by that date, no claim construction order had issued and no expert
discovery had taken place.

In sum, Function Media will not be prejudiced by Google’s proposed schedule, but
Google’s trial preparation will be severely prejudiced if its Daubert Motion regarding Mr. Bratic
is not expedited. For these reasons, Google respectfully requests that the Court grant Google’s
Expedited Motion to Expedite Briefing and Consideration of Google’s Daubert Motion to
Exclude Certain Testimony and Opinions of Mr. Walter Bratic. A proposed order is submitted
herewith.
