Civil No. 7:08-cv-00283

DEFENDANTS’ REPLY TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
RETURN TO THE NORTHEAST OHIO CORRECTIONAL CENTER

COME NOW the defendants, by counsel, and state the following as their reply to the
plaintiff’s motion to return to the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center:
1. The plaintiff was transferred to this district, by order of this court, for his scheduled
trial with the understanding that his hearing in the Northern District of West Virginia will be
continued until after the plaintiff’s trial in this district with the agreement of the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of West Virginia.
2. Before his transfer, the plaintiff was housed in the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center
which is a privately run facility under contract with the Bureau of Prisons. The plaintiff was
being held there pursuant to his law suit in the Northern District of West Virginia. Plaintiff is not
represented by Ms. Sokolowski-Craft in his Northern District of West Virginia case. A local
West Virginia attorney represents the plaintiff in that litigation.
3. According to the U.S. Marshal’s Service (USMS), pursuant to order of this court, the
plaintiff was transferred by the USMS to this district for his trial which set for October 6-7, 2011
in the Big Stone Gap (BSG) Division. Plaintiff is presently housed in the Salem/Roanoke County
1

Jail where he will remain until moved to a facility in the BSG Division for his trial at a time to
be determined by the USMS based on when the USMS can undertake the move and the
availability of a facility in the BSG Division.
4. For security and man power efficiency, movement of prisoners is done at the
discretion of the Bureau of Prisons and the USMS with primary consideration given to security
for the move and the USMS’s schedule for movement of prisoners.
5. When the parties agreed to take the plaintiff’s deposition, it was unknown when the
plaintiff would be moved to this district for his trial. The parties had no agreement that the
plaintiff would remain in Ohio for his deposition or until shortly before his trial. Such an
agreement would be impossible knowing that the plaintiff could be moved at anytime at the
discretion of the Bureau of Prisons and the USMS. It may have been thought that he would be at
the Ohio facility at the time of his deposition, but that would have only been an assumption.
6. Plaintiff has retained Ms. Sokolowski-Craft as private counsel who had to know when
she agreed to represent the plaintiff in his case in this district that he has pending cases in two
districts and that he would be moved between the districts at the discretion of the USMS, the
Bureau of Prisons and the courts in the two districts. Ms. Sokolowski-Craft does not represent
the plaintiff in his Northern District of Ohio litigation.
7. That the plaintiff is in a local jail in this district is no obstacle to his deposition. Ms.
Sokolowski - Craft, as plaintiff’s privately retained counsel, has the option to travel to the
plaintiff’s deposition in this district in person, or attend by video conference from Ohio.
Attorneys practicing in the federal court in this district frequently do depositions by video
conference. Also, as plaintiff’s private counsel, she can meet with the plaintiff at the

2

Salem/Roanoke County Jail to plan for his trial and deposition. The USMS does not have the
budget or manpower to transport prisoners for the convenience of private counsel in civil cases.
THEREFORE, the plaintiff’s motion should be denied.
Dated: August 30, 2011.
Respectfully submitted,
TIMOTHY J. HEAPHY
