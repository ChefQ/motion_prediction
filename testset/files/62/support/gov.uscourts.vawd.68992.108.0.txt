IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA

 

 

ROANOKE DIVISION
DEMETRIUS HILL : CASE NO. 7:08-CV-00283
Plaintiff, : JUDGE JAMES C. TURK
: Senior United States District Judge
-VS-
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR
TERRY O'BRIEN, et al. ; TRANSFER TO OHIO FACILITY

Defendants.

Now comes Plaintiff, Demetrius Hill, by and through undersigned counsel and hereby
moves this Court for an Order to return Plaintiff Demetrius Hill to CI NE Ohio Correctional
Center in Youngstown, Ohio (""NEOCC") until 1-2 weeks prior to Plaintiff's Trial before this
Court.

Plaintiff Hill was housed in NEOCC as a result of a May 6, 2011 Order from the United
States District Court of West Virginia. Mr. Hill's West Virginia case, 3:06 cv 136, is currently
pending before Magistrate Judge John S. Kaull and will be set for its next hearing on a date after
Mr. Hill completes his matter before this Court. As such, West Virginia's orders do not impact
this Court in any way, as Mr. Hill is not returning to West Virginia until this matter before this
Honorable Court is complete.

On August 24, 2011, this Court issued an order directing the U.S. Marshal's service to
"have Demetrius Hill transported to the United States District Court ... so that he may be

present at his trial on October 6-7, 2011." (Docket 98). |

 
Case 7:08-cv-00283-JCT Document 108 Filed 08/30/11 Page 2 of 4

At this same time, counsel for Defendant requested to conduct a deposition of Plaintiff,
and counsel for both parties agreed on some dates in mid-September to conduct that deposition at
the NEOCC facility, On August 29, 2011, Defendants filed a Motion for Leave to Depose
Plaintiff. (Docket 103}. All agreements and scheduling between counsel relied on the fact that
Mr. Hill was housed at NEOCC in Youngstown, Ohio.

On August 30, 2011, today, Mr. Hill was picked up by the U.S. Marshal's office for his
transfer. Needless to say, counsel was not expecting that Mr. Hill would be transferred
approximately 1 '4 months prior to his trial date. Counsel and Mr. Hill had been preparing for
trial and counsel had not yet prepared Mr. Hill for deposition, nor testifying at trial. Mr. Hill was
in possession of certain trial documents that were being used for trial preparation and counsel
had scheduled meeting with Mr. Hill to address witnesses and exhibits. All of this preparation
has now halted.

Because it is unknown where Mr. Hill is going and how long he may potentially stay at
each facility, it appears extremely difficult to thoroughly prepare for trial. If, as counsel has been
advised, Mr. Hill transfers through several different facilities before he arrives in Virginia,
counsel will not be able to travel and visit Mr. Hill from Chio to whichever State Mr. Hill is in,
as he would likely be transferred right out of that facility within days after his arrival.

The trial before this Court is in thirty-eight (38) days and counsel does not know where
Mr, Hill is going or when he will settle into a location. If Mr. Hill is transferred through other
facilities before his arrival in Virginia, it will be impossible for counsel to follow him around
from State to State in preparation for trial. Moreover, a deposition of Plaintiff will be unlikely, as

locations and dates are unknown at this time.

It is also counsel's understanding that there are limited facilities in Virginia that are
designated to house a maximum security inmate, such as Mr. Hill. One of the only facilities in
Virginia that can house maximum security inmates with Mr. Hill's medical conditions is Lee
USP - the facility that Mr. Hill has named as a Defendant in this matter. Counsel can only hope
that the U.S. Marshal is aware of Lee USP being the Defendant in this matter and refrain from
housing Plaintiff Hill at Lee USP. Plaintiffs counsel; however, brings this to the attention of the
Court in case Mr, Hill is housed at Lee USP and as additional grounds for the return transfer of
Mr. Hill to NEOCC,
| Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Hill, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully
requests that this Court enter an order instructing the Marshal to transfer Mr. Hili back to
NEOCC until 1-2 weeks prior to trial, at which point the Marshal then transfer Mr. Hill to a

facility near Big Stone Gap, VA that is not Lee USP.
