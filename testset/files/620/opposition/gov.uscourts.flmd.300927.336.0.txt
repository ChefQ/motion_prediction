PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSED MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO SERVE DISCOVERY RELATING TO PLAINTIFFS’ AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
OF IMPLIED LICENSE

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 336 Filed 05/12/16 Page 2 of 6 PageID 9685

Pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(b), Plaintiff Barn Light Electric Company, LLC and ThirdParty Defendants Bryan Scott and Donna Scott (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), respectfully submit
this Opposition to Defendants’ Opposed Motion for Leave to Serve Discovery Requests Relating
to Plaintiff’s Affirmative Defense of Implied License (“Motion”), and state as follows:
I.

DEFENDANTS’ DISCOVERY REQUESTS VIOLATE PRACTICALLY EVERY
COURT-IMPOSED LIMITATION ON FURTHER DISCOVERY
Defendants’ discovery requests exceed the Court’s strict limits on more discovery

concerning the implied license defense. During the February 23, 2016 status conference, the
Court granted Plaintiffs leave to add implied license as an affirmative defense because the issue
was “fully litigated and discovered.” Status Conf. Tr. (“Transcript”) 83:23-24 (February 23,
2016); see Transcript 84:10-12 (“…it looks like everything was discovered in connection with
this [implied license defense].”). Since the defense was already the subject of complete
discovery, the Court substantially curtailed further discovery by issuing detailed directions/limits
about additional discovery, to the extent any was even necessary. 1
First, the Court required specificity in any further discovery requests, including
interrogatories and a single request for production for a specific document. See Transcript 83:
24 – 84:14 (“If there’s some specific interrogatory that you would like to propound….”)
(emphasis added); see also Transcript 84:3-5 (“limited to a specific document… I want a specific
document request.”) (emphasis added).
The present interrogatories are not specific. Rather, the interrogatories revisit the entirety
of the Plaintiff’s license defenses, which was already fully litigated and discovered. Regarding
1

Defendants suggest that—although present at the status conference—they were unaware of the Court’s express
limitations on further discovery. Defendants, even if unaware of the Court’s discovery limitations at the time they
sought more discovery, were aware of the limitations prior to the Local Rule 3.01(g) meeting for the Motion.
Nevertheless, as detailed infra at 3, Defendants refused Plaintiff’s requests that they limit the scope of their requests
to comply with the Court’s directive.

the license defense, Defendants ask for: “identification of all documents;” description of “all the
facts and circumstances;” and all materials subject to a license, including but not limited to on
Plaintiffs’ website. All the subject matter sought in the interrogatories was already the subject of
extensive discovery, including numerous requests for production, interrogatories, depositions and
requests for admissions from both parties. Likewise, the present request for production number
207 does not request or otherwise identify a “specific document.” It is broadly directed to
unspecified documents about the scope and/or limitations regarding the license defense.
Defendants offer a partial account about the basis for Plaintiffs’ objections to the
additional discovery requests. Plaintiffs objected to Defendants’ requests for multiple reasons,
not just the Defendants’ failure to seek leave as required by the Court. See Plaintiffs Objections
to Defendants 4th Set of Interrogatories, attaches as Ex. 1, 7-12; see also, Plaintiff’s Responses to
Defendants Sixth Request for Production of Documents (No. 207), attached as Ex. 2, 7. Beyond
Defendants’ failure to seek leave, Plaintiffs’ objected to the broad scope of the discovery
requests. See Ex. 1, 7-12; see also, Ex. 2, 7 (Plaintiffs “object to Request No. 207 on the basis of
Defendants’ and Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ failure to adhere to the Court’s directive that Defendants
and Counterclaim Plaintiffs limit the scope of any such Request to a ‘specific document.’”). That is,

the requests did not comply with the limitations set by the Court. Further, before and during the
Local Rule 3.01(g) meeting regarding the Motion, Plaintiffs repeatedly asked for Defendants to
propose alternative requests tailored to finding specific information or documents rather than
requests directed at general contentions. See Email Correspondence Dated April 21, 2016, Ex. 3.
Defendants refused.

When confronted with the Court’s specific limitations, Defendants

dismissively answered that they would not limit their discovery requests because they believe
“the Court is wrong” in limiting their scope.

Further still, Defendants failed to explain that the “Request for Production No. 207,”
(“Proposed RFP 207”) in Section 5.d of the Motion differs from the propounded Request for
Production 207 (“Propounded RFP 207”) that was referenced earlier in the Motion, objected to
by Plaintiffs, and subject to the Local Rule 3.01(g) meeting. As shown in Ex. 2, the Propounded
RFP 207 was even broader than the Proposed RFP 207, which was presented for the first time in
the Motion. The Propounded RFP 207 included precisely the “including but not limited to”
language expressly proscribed by the Court. The Court warned Defendants not to draft a request
with language such as “not limited to, all documents that refer, reflect or relate to…. I want a
specific document request.” Transcript 84: 3-5.
In short, Defendants disagreed with the Court’s order but nevertheless insisted on
propounding needlessly broad discovery requests.
II.

CONCLUSION
Defendants should not be permitted to re-take discovery on subject matter that was fully

litigated and discovered, and which was directly prohibited by the Court. Accordingly, the
Motion should be denied.
