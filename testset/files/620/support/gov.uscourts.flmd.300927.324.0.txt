DEFENDANTS' OPPOSED MOTION FOR LEAVE TO SERVE DISCOVERY
REQUESTS RELATING TO PLAINTIFF'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE OF
IMPLIED LICENSE

Pursuant to this Court's Order of February 25, 2016 [Dkt. 283, Paragraph 16] and Fed. R.
Civ. P. 33 and 34, Defendants Barnlight Originals, Inc., Hi-Lite Manufacturing Company, Inc.
and Jeffrey L. Ohai, (collectively "Defendants'"), by and through their undersigned counsel,
respectfully ask this Court for leave to propound four (4) discovery requests relating to Plaintiffs
newly pled Fourteenth Affirmative Defense of Implied License. In support of this Motion for
Leave, Defendants state as follows:
1. On February 25, 2016, this Court granted Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First
Amended Answer to Defendants' Second Amended Counterclaims and Third Party

Complaint to assert the affirmative defense of implied license. [Dkt. 283, Paragraph

7.
Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 324 Filed 04/25/16 Page 2 of 3 PagelD 9493

2. On March 3, 2016, believing this Court had previously granted permission to
propound discovery relating to its affirmative defense of implied license, Defendants
served their Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Sixth Set of Requests for Production to
Plaintiff.

3. Thirty-five (35) days later, on April 7, 2016, Plaintiff responded to Defendants'
discovery requests with a series of objections based upon this Court's statement
during the hearing of February 23, 2016 that Defendants should first file a motion
seeking leave to propound additional discovery requests. See Transcript of February
23, 2016 Hearing at 83:24 - 84:6. The transcript of the hearing, however, was not
available for review until after Defendants had propounded their discovery requests.
See [Dkt. 301].

4, Plaintiff has objected to responding to the discovery requests absent an Order from
this Court.

5. Accordingly, Defendants respectfully ask this Court for leave to serve the following
discovery requests upon Plaintiff. The subject requests are narrowly focused and
seek discovery on the existence and scope of Plaintiff's newly asserted affirmative
defense.

a. Interrogatory No. 26: Please identify all documents You believe support
Your Fourteenth Affirmative Defense of License.

b. Interrogatory No. 27: Please describe all of the facts and circumstances You
believe support Your Fourteenth Affirmative Defense of License.

c. Interrogatory No. 28: Identify all Materials You are currently using

(including but not limited to Materials appearing on any of Your websites)
Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 324 Filed 04/25/16 Page 3 of 3 PagelD 9494

that You contend are the subject of a license from Hi-Lite.
d. Request for Production No. 207: Documents sufficient to show the scope of
any alleged license and/or any limitations associated with any alleged license.
WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request leave of Court to serve the above
identified discovery requests upon Plaintiff.
Certification Pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(g)
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(g), I hereby certify that counsel for Defendants conferred

with counsel for Plaintiff, and counsel for Plaintiff opposes the requested relief.

Dated: April 25, 2016. Respectfully submitted,
