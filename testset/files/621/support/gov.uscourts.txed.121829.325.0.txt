UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
TYLER DIVISION
PARALLEL NETWORKS, LLC,
Plaintiff,
Civil Case No. 6:10-cv-111-LED
Hon. Leonard E. Davis

v.
ABERCROMBIE & FITCH CO., et al.,
Defendants.

AMAZON.COM, INC.’S MOTION TO COMPEL
RULE 30(b)(6) DEPOSITION OF PLAINTIFF PARALLEL NETWORKS, LLC
Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) hereby moves to compel the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of
Parallel Networks, LLC (“Parallel”), noticed by Amazon on December 21, 2010 to take place on
January 18, 2011. The deposition seeks the most basic answers in a patent case – what is
accused, and why? Yet, despite multiple meet-and-confers, Parallel has decided unilaterally that
it will not provide a witness. Parallel bases its refusal primarily on the assertion that so long as
Parallel has provided Amazon with infringement contentions in a timely manner, then Parallel is
immune from discovery on its infringement claims. Under this Court’s precedent, and the rules
of discovery, Amazon is unquestionably within its rights to pursue the discovery sought.
I.

BACKGROUND
This is the second time Parallel has sued Amazon on the same patent (U.S. Patent No.

6,446,111, or “the ’111 patent”) before this Court. Parallel first sued Amazon (and Google Inc.
and Kayak Software Corporation) on April 6, 2009. See generally Parallel Networks, LLC v.
Google Inc. et al., No. 6:09-cv-00154-LED (E.D. Tex.). In that case, after the exchange of
contentions, Amazon and the other defendants noticed Parallel’s deposition on its infringement
contentions. (See Ex. 1.) Before the deposition could be scheduled, however, Parallel
voluntarily dismissed its case, because its counsel (the Niro Scavone firm) did not wish to

Case 6:10-cv-00111-LED Document 325

Filed 02/18/11 Page 2 of 9

proceed with the case. Notably, Parallel held onto Amazon’s document production from the first
case, meaning Parallel has had documents regarding Amazon’s accused instrumentalities for at
least 14 months.
After finding new counsel (first the Collins firm, then the Spangler firm, and now the
Bosy firm), Parallel filed suit against Amazon and numerous other defendants on March 29,
2010, again alleging infringement of the same ’111 patent. (Parallel has since sued dozens of
other defendants in three other lawsuits before this Court on the ’111 patent.) Like in the
original case against Amazon, the complaint and its subsequent amendments generally identify
Amazon’s Internet web site, a few named features, as well as “[s]ystems and methods used to
operate www.amazon.com (including any subdomains)” and “[n]umerous JavaScript Applets
present on www.amazon.com (including subdomains) pages,” as allegedly infringing the ’111
patent. (See Ex. 2 at 13.) Given Parallel’s new counsel in this case, Amazon presumed that early
disclosures and discovery procedures would shed light on the full scope of specific products and
features Parallel was accusing, and provide details relating to Parallel’s theory of infringement
for each such product.
The contentions fail to provide the necessary detail. Parallel served its P.R. 3-1 and 3-2
disclosures on September 13, 2010, but substantially omitted details about the specific products
and features accused of infringement, and the manner in which they allegedly do so. In sum,
despite having had document discovery from Amazon for 14 months, the contentions are nearly
identical to the ones it served in the first case against Amazon and remain inexplicably deficient.
For example, Parallel continues to rely on general descriptive statements rather than specific
identification of all accused products for Amazon. Also, Parallel provided a single claim chart to
Amazon, notwithstanding Parallel’s obligation to present charts demonstrating how each element
of each asserted claim is allegedly found within each accused instrumentality. (See id.)
Consequently, Parallel has left Amazon to speculate as to the complete scope of the products and
features that are accused of infringement, and how each allegedly infringes in Parallel’s view.

With discovery underway and the claim construction process looming, on December 21,
2010, Amazon noticed a deposition of Parallel under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) to
investigate Parallel’s infringement contentions. (See Ex. 3.) The notice included four narrowly
drawn topics for deposition, all of which are directed at discoverable information related to
Parallel’s allegations of infringement:
1. The complete basis and foundation for PN’s contentions that Amazon infringes,
directly or indirectly, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, any asserted
claim of the ’111 patent, through the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale, and/or
importation of its Accused Amazon Technology or otherwise, and any documents
or things related thereto.
2. PN’s Infringement Contentions, the complete basis and foundation therefor, and
any documents or things related thereto.
3. PN’s understanding of the specific identity, structure, operation, architecture, and
function of each Accused Amazon Technology which PN contends allegedly
infringes any asserted claim of the ’111 patent.
4. PN’s contention as to whether each of the Accused Amazon Technologies, alone
or in combination, practices each and every limitation of the asserted claims of the
’111 patent, the basis and foundation therefore, and any documents or things
related thereto.
Id. On December 30, 2010, Parallel’s counsel sent a letter stating that “Parallel Networks
declines to provide a witness in response to Amazon’s Rule 30(b)(6) notice at this time.” (Ex.
4.) It is Parallel’s position that “[n]othing further is required from Parallel Networks at this
time.” (Id.) This is in direct opposition to the Federal Rules, Local Rules, and this Court’s
precedent regarding discovery.
Over the course of the ensuing six weeks, counsel for the parties repeatedly met and
conferred, but the process was unproductive. Parallel continues to refuse to submit to a Rule
30(b)(6) deposition on its contentions. Parallel’s unjustified refusal shields unquestionably
relevant, discoverable information from Amazon, thereby delaying the case and otherwise
prejudicing Amazon. Amazon has endured being named in two separate lawsuits, both under the
auspices of deficient contentions. It should be allowed to take discovery to establish what
exactly is being accused, and why Parallel is accusing it. For this reason, Amazon respectfully

3

requests that the Court order Parallel to provide a witness for deposition on the noticed topics
with five business days of the Court’s order on Amazon’s motion.
II.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
The facts and case law, including this Court’s Order in MyMail, Ltd. v. America Online,

Inc., Case No. 6:04-cv-189 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2004) (see Ex. 5), firmly support Amazon’s
motion to compel.
A.

Legal Standards1

“The Court has a policy of liberal, open, and forthright discovery.” Garmin Ltd. v.
TomTom, Inc., 2007 WL 2903843, at *8 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 3, 2007) (Davis, J.). Material is
discoverable if it is “relevant to any party’s claim or defense.... Relevant information need not be
admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(1); see also MyMail, at 2. This Court has plainly
stated that “one party may not unilaterally decide when to withhold discovery.” Garmin, 2007
WL 2903843, at *8.
In MyMail, AOL sought a corporate deposition of MyMail relating to “[t]he basis and
foundation for MyMail’s contention that AOL infringes any claim of the ’290 patent.” MyMail,
at 3. MyMail refused to produce a corporate designee on this and other topics on the grounds
that such a deposition was improper before discovery was substantially complete. Id. at 1, 3.
The Court granted AOL’s motion to compel the deposition, reasoning that “[i]nformation is
discoverable as soon as it becomes relevant; parties do not have authority to determine when
information will be disclosed.” Id. at 2. Finally, the Court warned all parties that: “[T]he Court
will not tolerate gamesmanship that attempts to conceal or delay the production of discoverable
items.” Id. (quoting STMicroelectronics, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 308 F. Supp. 2d 754, 756 (E.D.
Tex. 2004)).

Amazon provided Parallel with the relevant case authority cited in this motion. Parallel
apparently found such authority unpersuasive.

4

Case 6:10-cv-00111-LED Document 325

Filed 02/18/11 Page 5 of 9

Similarly, in Garmin, the Court heard cross motions to compel and for protection related
to a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, noticed by TomTom, including “three topics: 1) Garmin’s
Infringement Contentions, 2) knowledge of accused products, and 3) facts surrounding how
Garmin determined TomTom was infringing.” 2007 WL 2903843, at *8. Garmin unilaterally
cancelled the deposition, arguing that its infringement contentions had not been supplemented
with recently discovered information. Id. The Court granted TomTom’s motion to compel,
reasoning that Garmin could not delay discovery regarding its infringement contentions. Id.
Given this Court’s clear authority on the matter, Parallel’s attempt to shield itself from
the noticed deposition is untenable, especially given that this is Parallel’s second suit against
Amazon on the same patent, and the fact that Parallel has had Amazon’s documents for 14
months.
B.

Amazon Seeks and Should Be Granted Access to Relevant, Discoverable
Information

Amazon’s notice of deposition to Parallel includes topics that seek information plainly
relevant to its defenses—the identity of products accused of infringement, the theory of
infringement of each such product, a description of how each accused product meets the
limitations of the asserted claims of the ’111 patent, and the evidence that supposedly supports
those allegations. Simply stated, Amazon needs to know what to defend before it can mount a
suitable defense. This information should have been disclosed by Parallel under P.R. 3-1.
Parallel’s disclosures, however, have been woefully deficient. First, Parallel included a
general accusation that “Javascript applets present on www.amazon.com pages” infringe the
’111 patent. (Ex. 2, Chart at 1.) For the remaining named products and services, Parallel
included a single claim chart. Again, this not only ignores the requirements of the Local Rules to
provide a chart for each accused instrumentality, but shifts the burden to Amazon to seek
relevant information—withheld by Parallel—that should have been disclosed without request.
Ultimately, Parallel’s refusal to submit to deposition relating to its infringement contentions

5

Case 6:10-cv-00111-LED Document 325

Filed 02/18/11 Page 6 of 9

prevents Amazon from best defending itself and is the type of gamesmanship against which the
Court warned in MyMail and STMicroelectronics.
Parallel’s unilateral decision to withhold discovery also prejudices Amazon’s ability to
defend itself in this case. For example, for Amazon to ensure it has identified all of its relevant
witnesses, it needs a precise articulation of what exactly Parallel accuses. For Amazon to
participate in claim construction, it needs to know how Parallel is reading the asserted claims.
Furthermore, Amazon served its P.R. 3-3 invalidity contentions without the benefit of full
disclosure of Parallel’s theory of infringement – as the Court is aware, invalidity is informed in
part by the plaintiff’s apparent reading of the asserted claims.
The prejudice to Amazon from Parallel’s refusal to submit to discovery is tangible and
manifest. Amazon asks the Court to prevent any further prejudice to Amazon by compelling
Parallel to submit to deposition on the four topics noticed on December 21, 2010.
C.

Parallel Has No Basis for Withholding Relevant Discovery by Refusing to
Submit to Deposition

Parallel has cited no authority and has no reasonable basis for withholding its corporate
deponent from Amazon. Parallel has given three reasons for its refusal to provide a designee on
Amazon’s noticed deposition topics: (1) Parallel “has previously provided Amazon with its
infringement contentions in a timely fashion”; (2) discovery related to Parallel’s infringement
contentions is premature; and (3) Parallel “expects to provide a very limited number of Rule
30(b)(6) witnesses in this action; as a consequence, efficiency dictates that most or all topics be
covered in a limited number of depositions.” (See Ex. 4.)
The notion that simply providing timely P.R. 3-1 and 3-2 submissions forecloses
discovery of the plaintiff’s theories of infringement is squarely in conflict with established
procedure and the Court’s policy of forthright discovery. See, e.g., MyMail and
STMicroelectronics.
Moreover, Parallel improperly cites Amazon’s response to Parallel’s Interrogatory No. 1
for the proposition that infringement contentions discovery is premature. Parallel’s interrogatory

6

Case 6:10-cv-00111-LED Document 325

Filed 02/18/11 Page 7 of 9

sought to have Amazon describe why Amazon does not infringe (an interrogatory that Amazon
plainly cannot answer at least until Parallel articulates why Amazon does allegedly infringe).
The interrogatory thus effectively turned the appropriate burden of proof on its head.
Accordingly, Amazon directed Parallel to Jacobs Chuck Manuf. Co. v. Shandong Weida Mach.,
No. 2:05-cv-185-TJW (E.D. Tex. Aug. 18, 2006), in which Judge Ward denied a defendant’s
motion to compel a response to a contention interrogatory asking the plaintiff to “[i]dentify each
element of the asserted claims…not disclosed in each of the prior art references.” (See Ex. 6 at
1.) The Court reasoned that such an interrogatory was premature and would not need to be
answered until a claim construction ruling was issued. (Id. at 2.) In a footnote, the Court added:
“The court sees no reason why this holding would not apply equally to the reverse situation—an
interrogatory served by plaintiff early on in the case asking a defendant to identify all of the
limitations of an asserted claim that the defendant contends are not found in an accused product.”
(Id.) Parallel’s Interrogatory No. 1 is just such a non-infringement contention interrogatory that
seeks to reverse the burden of proof – just as in Jacobs Chuck.
In contrast, Amazon is seeking a deposition regarding an issue on which Parallel
indisputably has the burden of proof, infringement. Thus, it is appropriate for Amazon to rely on
Jacobs Chuck regarding its non-infringement position. And, nothing in Jacobs Chuck supports a
plaintiff withholding discovery of its infringement contentions. Discovery of Parallel’s
contentions should move forward without delay.
As to Parallel’s unilateral decision to provide “a very limited number” of corporate
depositions, Parallel’s position fails to recognize that Parallel decided to sue more than 120
defendants across four cases. It should have foreseen that it might have to subject its witnesses
to multiple rounds of depositions (though the defendants across the cases are working to
coordinate to reasonably streamline discovery). Beyond this, Amazon is differently situated than
nearly all of the other defendants – this is Parallel’s second bite at the apple with regard to
Amazon. After filing two lawsuits against Amazon, and having Amazon’s documents for more

7

Filed 02/18/11 Page 8 of 9

than a year, it simply is unreasonable for Parallel to maintain that Amazon is not yet entitled to
this critical discovery.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons described above, Amazon respectfully requests that the Court order

Parallel to identify a designee and, within five (5) business days, submit to Rule 30(b)(6)
deposition on all topics identified by Amazon in its December 21, 2010 Notice.
