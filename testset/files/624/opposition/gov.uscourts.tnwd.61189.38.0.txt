Case No. 2:12-cv-02143-cgc

Removal of Case No. CH-11-1757-3 From
Chancery Court for the State of Tennessee
in Shelby County

DEFENDANTS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO RECONSIDER
AND MOTION FOR STAY
On August 24, 2012, the Court Granted in Part, and Denied in Part Defendants’ Motion
for Sanctions (Dkt. 32, the “Sanction Order”). On September 4, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Motion
to Reconsider Sanctions (Dkt. No. 33, the “Motion to Reconsider”) and a Motion for Stay of
Sanctions Pending Appeal (Dkt. No. 34, the “Motion to Stay”) seeking the Court’s
reconsideration and a stay of the Sanctions Order, respectively.

Defendants, the Tennessee

Democratic Party (“TNDP”), and Chip Forrester (collectively the “TNDP Defendants” and
together with the Democratic National Committee and Debbie Wasserman Schultz the
“Defendants”) file this Consolidated Opposition to Motion to Reconsider and Motion For Stay.
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Reconsider and Motion for Stay, like the original complaint in this
case, have no basis in law or fact and is a continued attempt to multiply the proceedings and
1

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 2 of 16

unnecessarily prolong these proceedings.

PageID 598

The Court’s well-reasoned and well-supported

Sanctions Order should be upheld in its entirety, and should not be stayed. Plaintiffs’ Motions
should be denied in their entirety.
The Motion to Reconsider fails at the outset for failure to comply with Local Rule 7.3
which governs “Motion for Revision of Interlocutory Orders” of which the Motion to Reconsider
is not styled but acts as in substance. The Motion to Reconsider does not cite the correct
standard governing this Court’s decision to revise an interlocutory order and also fails as it
contains repetition of argument that is specifically prohibited under Local Rule 7.3(c).
Moreover, the substantive arguments offered in support of reconsideration are utterly baseless.
In fact, they contain provably false statements, for example,

the Plaintiffs claim that the

Sanctions Order violates Plaintiffs’ counsel’s due process because “Defendants’ motion for
sanctions did not assert that Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their suit, as grounds for its
sanctions motion” and therefore “Attorney Irion was not given any notice that he might be
sanctioned for failing to establish standing.” (Motion to Reconsider at 6.) However, this is
patently false, as the Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions contains 3 pages of argument regarding
standing and Plaintiff’s lack of standing is the very first argument raised in support of imposing
sanctions on the Plaintiffs. (Sanctions Motion at 6-8, and n. 4.) The Court should no longer be
surprised that the Plaintiffs would put forward such an absurd argument that is demonstrably
false, as this type of frivolity have been the touchstone of Plaintiffs conduct throughout this
lawsuit. 1
The Motion to Stay is equally defective, if not more so. The Motion to Stay fails to
satisfy all factors governing the Court’s evaluation of staying interlocutory orders pending
appeal, most notable of which is Plaintiffs’ utter failure to show how they would be “irreparably
1

Additionally, this factual assertion by the Plaintiffs is not one that requires interpretation or the drawing of
inferences. The assertion is simply false and as such raises questions about the Plaintiffs candor to the Court.

2

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 3 of 16

PageID 599

harmed” as a result of the Sanctions Order being given immediate effect. Since the staying of a
pending order is proper only in instances of a showing of irreparable harm, Plaintiffs have
offered no declaration, affidavit, or other evidence showing how the payment of a sanction award
in this case would result in any harm, let alone irreparable harm. The Motion for Stay must fail
on this basis alone; after all, if sanctions are ordered pursuant to the Sanctions Order, a simple
bond can be posted while on appeal to avoid payment until after the final resolution and if
Plaintiffs’ counsel elects to pay the sanctions pending appeal and the Court of Appeals
eventually determines the sanctions were improperly imposed, which is highly unlikely, the
sanctions could simply be repaid to Plaintiffs’ counsel. Since monetary damages or payments
are the exact antithesis to “irreparable harm,” Plaintiffs cannot carry their substantial burden of
showing a basis for staying the Court’s Sanctions Order.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs initially filed this case in Shelby County Chancery Court and Defendants
successfully removed the case to this Court. (Dkt. 1.) The operative complaint is a class action
complaint 2 seeking injunctive relief for the extraordinary purpose of keeping Barack Obama off
the Tennessee ballot for the upcoming November 2012 election on the basis that he did not satisfy
Article II’s “Natural Born Citizen” requirement to hold the office of President of the United
States. (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 1, 52-59.) This was not the first time parties have attempted to
delegitimize the President with these accusations.

2

(Dkt. No. 26, Defendant’s Motion for

The class is defined in the complaint to include all citizens of the United States who are either registered with the
Federal Election Commission to run for President of the United States or who “object to having a candidate that is
clearly no qualified to hold the office of President…”. Disturbingly, on his Liberty Legal Foundation website under
the Asked & Answered portion, Liberty Legal advertises that any “Any U.S. citizen can be a member of a Liberty
Legal Foundation class action. We just need to verify your identity by running a small credit card transaction. This
counts as a tax deductible donation to Liberty Legal Foundation and helps us cover the costs of the lawsuit.” This is
an additional major ethical issue because absent class members are being told that to remain a member of the
defined class in the complaint, they have to make a donation to Liberty Legal Foundation (Plaintiffs’ Class
Counsel’s foundation) – which violates the letter and the spirit of the law.

Sanctions, at p. 2-3 , the “Sanctions Motion”)(identifying the numerous “birther” cases that have
been filed in federal and state forums).
The Defendants filed three Motions to Dismiss (Dkt. 4, 6 and 8) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
P 12(b)(1) and (6), 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(3), and sent a Rule 11 letter requesting that the Plaintiff
immediately dismiss the lawsuit (Dkt. 26, Ex. A).
Shortly after the parties fully briefed the motions to dismiss, the Court granted the
Defendants’ consolidated Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 4, the “12(b)(1) Motion
to Dismiss”) on the basis that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Plaintiffs
lacked standing to pursue their claims. (Dkt. 31.) That Order is now final. Thereafter, the Court
granted the TNDP Defendants’ Sanctions Motion and found that the TNDP Defendants’ counsel
is entitled to the fees it incurred in drafting the consolidated Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) Motion to
Dismiss. (Dkt. 4 and 5.)
The Sanctions Order found that by filing the lawsuit the Plaintiffs violated 28 U.S.C. §
1927. (Sanctions Order at 7-11.) Specifically, the Court, relying on Sixth Circuit precedent
interpreting 28 U.S.C. § 1927, which held that sanctions were warranted here because:
The Court holds that Defendants have shown that counsel for
Plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that the claims in
this case had no basis in law. Specifically, counsel for Plaintiffs
reasonably should have known that plaintiffs lacked standing to
pursue their claims related to Defendants’ efforts to certify
President Obama as the Democratic Party’s nominee for the
Tennessee general election.

(Sanctions Order at 8.)
In response to the Sanctions Order and the Court’s directive therein, the TNDP
Defendants filed their Petition for Attorney’s Fees on September 14, 2012 seeking $22,800 in
attorneys’ fees covered by the Sanctions Order. (Dkt. No. 37.)
ARGUMENT
Neither the Motion to Reconsider or the Motion For Stay satisfies the applicable standard
for granting reconsideration or staying of the Sanctions Order. Accordingly, the Court should
deny both Motions and enter a fee award of $22,800 in attorney fees to the TNDP Defendants’
for having to defend against the meritless and frivolous claims brought by the Plaintiffs.
I.

The Motion To Reconsider Must Be Denied
Curiously, Plaintiffs Motion to Reconsider does not reference the standard governing

Motion for Reconsideration in this Court, presumably because Plaintiffs know they cannot meet
it. The standard governing motions for reconsideration in this Court, as provided in Local Rule
7.3, requires a motion to show:
(1) A material difference in fact or law from that which was
presented to the Court before entry of the interlocutory order for
which revision is sought, and that in the exercise of reasonable
diligence the party applying for revision did not know such fact or
law at the time of the interlocutory order; or (2) the occurrence of
new material facts or a change of law occurring after the time of
such order; or (3) a manifest failure by the Court to consider
material facts or dispositive legal arguments that were presented to
the Court before such interlocutory order.
Local Rule 7.3(b); see also Carbon Processing & Reclamation, LLC v. Valero Marketing and
Supply Co., Case No. 09-2127-STA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93969, ** 6-7 (W.D. Tn.) (J.
Anderson) (applying Local Rule 7.3 to a motion for reconsideration). The Local Rule goes onto
specifically prohibit a motion to reconsider from “repeating any oral or written argument made
by the movant in…opposition to the interlocutory order” and allows the Court to enter
5

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 6 of 16

PageID 602

“appropriate sanctions, including, but not limited to striking the filing” in the event the motion
violates this prohibition. Local Rule 7.3(c); see also Valero, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93969, **
7-8.
The Motion to Reconsider does not raise any allegation that would satisfy any of these
standards and clearly violates the prohibition against repetition of argument by repeating the
same standing argument Plaintiffs put forward in their opposition to the Sanctions Motion.
(Compare Motion to Reconsider at 2-3 with Opposition to Motion to Sanctions, Dkt. No. 29 at
18-19). On this basis alone the Motion to Reconsider should be denied, and should be stricken
from the record. Local Rule 7.3(c); Valero, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93969, **7-9 (denying
motion for reconsideration because motion to reconsider merely repeated arguments made in the
original briefing). 3
In any event, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Reconsider does not contain any argument 4 that new
law or new facts require a change to the Sanctions Order, nor could it, and therefore the Motion
fails both the first and second factor contained in Local Rule 7.3(b). Plaintiffs fail to attach any
declaration of affidavit that would offer new “facts” into the record or attempt to explain why
such facts were new or not known to the Plaintiffs at any relevant time. Plaintiffs also fail to
identify any change in law or new authority that would point to a different result or analysis.
Therefore, the only question presented is whether the Sanctions Order displays a “manifest
failure by the Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments.” Importantly,
Plaintiffs do not allege that the Court committed manifest failure, instead, Plaintiffs attempt to
raise three new legal arguments, that could have been made in the original opposition. Nothing

3

For this reason, the TNDP Defendants will not address the Motion to Reconsider’s arguments on standing, as this
ground has now been well trodden by the Defendants and the Court in this case.
4
TNDP Defendants are not conceding that mere argument is sufficient to meet the standard, instead, the TNDP
Defendants are pointing out that Plaintiffs did not even attempt to meet the first two prongs.

6

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 7 of 16

PageID 603

in Plaintiffs’ brief can even arguably be interpreted to raise to the level of “manifest failure”
requiring reconsideration of the Sanctions Order.
Moreover, Plaintiffs fully ignore the portion of the Court’s order that holds that counsel’s
conduct “lacked any reasonable justification” for filing suit on behalf of Maroney – a citizen, the
Court correctly noted, who has an “undifferentiated, generalized grievance” completely
insufficient to justify standing. (Motion for Sanctions at 8-9.) Presumably by filing on behalf of
Mr. Maroney alone, Plaintiffs’ counsel was subject to sanctions and he makes no further attempt
to justify his conduct in filing suit on Mr. Maroney’s behalf. On this basis alone the Motion for
Reconsideration should be denied in its entirety.

In any event, as explained below, all

arguments put forth in favor of reconsideration are utterly meritless.
1. This Is Not A Case Of First Impression And Even If It Were Sanctions Are Still
Appropriate
Plaintiffs incorrectly and without support allege that “sanctions under 28 U.S.C. § 1927
cannot be sound against an attorney relying upon legal arguments of first impression.” (Motion
to Reconsider at 3.) Initially, this is not a case of first impression as discussed in Defendants’
Motion to the Dismiss under 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (Dkt. Nos. 4-5

) and also in TNDP

Defendants Motion for Sanctions (Dkt. No. 25), standing is a well-developed area of law and has
been considered and ruled upon in similar circumstances by both district courts and courts of
appeals.
Plaintiffs allege cases of first impression enjoy absolute immunity from sanctions, but a
review of the case law cited by Plaintiffs for the proposition reveals cases of first impression
enjoy no such immunity, and even if such cases did, this is not a case of first impression. The
Sixth Circuit case relied upon by Plaintiffs declined to impose sanctions because Plaintiffs
“theory of liability was not so obviously precluded by existing precedent that the attorney should
7

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 8 of 16

PageID 604

have known that the claim was frivolous.” Smith v. Detroit Federation of Teachers Local 231,
et. al, 829 F.3d 1370, 1379 (1987).

Implicit in this statement, and contrary to Plaintiffs

contentions here, is that sanctions are appropriate - even in cases of first impression – when, as
here, Plaintiffs’ theory of liability was “so obviously precluded by existing precedent that the
attorney should have known that the claim was frivolous.” Therefore, Plaintiffs claims of
absolute immunity for cases raising issues of first impression is wholly unsupported by the Sixth
Circuit precedent on which Plaintiffs rely. Id.; see also United States v. Alexander, 981 F.2d
250, 253 (5th Cir. 1993) ("Of course, a claim that is utterly insupportable may be sanctionable
even if the circuit has not addressed the issue.").
One district court in the Sixth Circuit has already pointed out the absurdity of Plaintiffs’
position:
It simply cannot be the case that a party who raises an issue of first
impression in a jurisdiction is entitled to absolute immunity from
sanctions in raising the issue. Such a rule would require that a
patently frivolous, yet novel, legal argument would not be
sanctionable.
John Richards Homes Bldg. Co., L.L.C. v. Adell Broadcasting Corp., Case No. 06-13748, 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117968, * 8 (E.D. Mich. 2009) citing Ozee v. Amer. Council on Gift Annuities,
Inc., 143 F.3d 937, 941 (5th Cir. 1998) (rejecting as unpersuasive defendant's contention that it
should not be sanctioned for pursuing an appeal in a case of first impression).
Based on this case law, it is clear that a party and its counsel can be sanctioned for
pursuing a case of first impression when an attorney should reasonably know that its position is
precluded by existing case law, which as the Court has already ruled, is the case here. Plaintiffs’
counsel’s attempt to extend the doctrine of “competitive standing,” a doctrine that has not been
adopted in this circuit, to write-in candidates is utterly unsupported by existing precedent on
standing. (Sanctions Order at 9-10.) Specifically, the Sanctions Order correctly held that “[t]he
8

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 9 of 16

PageID 605

allegation that an individual from California who is merely a declared write-in candidate in
Tennessee is, without additional factual support, too speculative to show injury-in-fact.”
(Sanctions Order at 10.)
In short, Plaintiffs’ attempts to expand the bounds of competitive standing to the facts of
this case are neither supported by relevant case law or the facts. To this end, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
actions here are similar to another case in this circuit where sanctions were imposed, and the
Court correctly summarized sanctionable conduct as follows:
It is clear beyond peradventure, therefore, that sanctions should be
imposed against plaintiff for prosecuting this frivolous and
vexatious lawsuit. Though it is quite plain that plaintiff's counsel
fully believes in the correctness of his legal argument, good faith is
no longer a defense against sanctions in this judicial circuit, neither
under § 1927 nor under Rule 11...Counsel clearly has permitted his
enthusiasm for a skewed legal theory to blind him to plain reality:
his theory is not, and never has been during the pendency of this
litigation, supportable in existing law.
Newton v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., Case No. 86-CV-40480, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15736 (E.D.
Mich. 1987) (sanctioning attorney for prosecuting a “legally creative” case in the face of
precedent that clearly made plaintiff’s claims frivolous).
Finally, as Plaintiffs pointed out in its Sanctions Motion, no less than 18 cases have
brought these same, tired allegations about the President’s qualifications to hold the office of
President of the United States. 5 (Sanctions Motion at 2-3, and n.1.) Not only is this case not a
case of first impression, then, it’s not even a case of 19th impression. Given the growing body of
case law directly addressing the issues herein, Plaintiffs’ counsel, at a minimum should have
known that Plaintiffs here did not have standing as the facts necessary to establish standing in

5

In fact, these eighteen cases represent the cases in federal and state forums that have reached a reportable
decision that is searchable in the main legal databases. Some websites collect and track the myriad of birther
cases filed throughout the country and a full string cite of over 150 cases at the federal and state level raising these
same allegations can be found at :
http://tesibria.typepad.com/whats_your_evidence/BIRTHER%20CASE%20LIST.pdf.

9

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 10 of 16

PageID 606

these “birther” actions has clearly been established, and Plaintiffs here hardly cured the defects
in the previous birther cases by seeking to prosecute this case “on behalf of a California resident
who had registered to run for President but had failed to qualify for the ballot in the state of
Tennessee.” (Sanctions Order at 9-10.)
2. The Court’s Order Does Not Misstate Allegations
In its Sanctions Order the Court correctly identified the inherent defects in Plaintiff
Dummett’s standing status by noting that Plaintiff Dummett had:
Failed to plead that he was a Tennessee political party’s nominee
for the office, that his name would appear on the ballot for
Tennessee’s general election in November, that he was
campaigning in the state of Tennessee, that any registered voter in
Tennessee intended to cast a vote for him, or that President
Obama’s presence on the ballot would in any way injure his
campaign.
(Sanctions Order at 9, citing Order Granting Defs.’ Mot. To Dismiss (Dkt. No. 31).) Despite
these identified pleading defects, the Plaintiffs now argue the Court should have accepted as true
its conclusory allegation that Plaintiff Dummett “will be concretely and continuously harmed as
a direct and proximate result of the defendants actions.” (Motion to Reconsider at 5 citing
Amended Compl. ¶ 33. However, it is well settled that in ruling on a Rule 12(b) motion, the
Court need not accept as true “legal conclusions” contained in a complaint, and “standing cannot
be inferred from averments in the pleadings, but rather must affirmatively appear in the record,
nor will naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement suffice.” White v. United States,
601 F.3d 545, 552 (6th Cir. 2010) (upholding dismissal of claim because plaintiffs complaint
failed to plead facts with sufficient particularity supporting plaintiffs’ standing to bring suit.
Here, Plaintiffs’ complaint only contains a “naked assertion[] devoid of further factual
enhancement” that Plaintiff Dummet would suffer an injury in fact as a result of President
Obama remaining on the Tennessee ballot.

Plaintiff Dummet’s failure to plead he would
10

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 11 of 16

PageID 607

actually appear on the ballot to compete with President Obama for votes in this state doomed his
complaint, and Plaintiffs’ counsel should have known this given the well-settled case law on
standing and the plethora of other cases raising similar allegations about President Obama’s
qualifications to hold the Office of President of the United States. (Dkt. No. 31, Dismissal
Order, at 14; Sanctions Order at 9-10.)
In short, Plaintiffs’ argument that the conclusory legal conclusions concerning Dummet’s
standing to pursue his claims is obviously misplaced, and the Court has already correctly
identified the pleading defects justifying dismissal of this suit and the imposition of sanctions.
White, 601 F.3d at 552.
Moreover, even if there was a modicum of support for Plaintiffs new position, the Court’s
Sanctions Order does not raise to the level of “manifest disregard” of a fact in the record to
justify granting reconsideration of the Sanctions Order as required by Local Rule 7.3(b).
Accordingly, the Motion to Reconsider could be denied on this basis alone.
3. The Court’s Order Does Not Violate Attorney Irion’s Right To Due Process
Plaintiffs’ counsel saves his worst argument for last. Plaintiffs make the astounding
argument that “Defendants’ motion for sanctions did not assert that Plaintiffs lacked standing to
bring their suit” and therefore, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s due process rights were violated for lack of
notice for grounds on which sanctions may be imposed.

(Motion to Reconsider at 5-6.)

Although Defendants would challenge the legal authority Plaintiffs’ counsel cites in support of
this argument, it is utterly unnecessary given the blatant absurdity of the factual assertion. The
first, the very first, argument in favor of imposing sanctions in the Defendant’s Sanctions Motion
reads: “Plaintiffs Should Have Learned After A Reasonable Search That They Lacked
Standing To Challenge President Obama’s Qualifications To Hold The Office Of President
Of The United States.” (Sanctions Motion at 6)(Emphasis added). The Sanctions Motion goes
11

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 12 of 16

PageID 608

on for three additional pages discussing the legal and factual basis for the plaintiffs’ lack of
standing and why sanctions were warranted given the existing case law. (Sanctions Motion at 68).
In other words, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s argument is demonstrably false on its face. The
very fact Plaintiffs’ counsel spent two full pages in his Motion to Reconsider putting forth an
argument that he knew was false, shows the extent to which Plaintiffs’ counsel is willing to
continue his vexatious tactics in this litigation. . .
At a minimum, Plaintiffs believe this argument in and of itself is grounds for additional
sanctions under 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and obviously not a proper ground for granting
reconsideration of the Sanctions Order. Defendants’ reluctantly suggest that the Court should
additionally consider whether Plaintiffs’ counsel should be allowed to continue appearing pro
hac vice in this matter.
II.

The Motion To Stay Must Be Denied
The Motion to Stay contains numerous overlapping arguments as the Motion to

Reconsider, and the TNDP Defendants will not belabor their points above by repeating them
here. Rather, the TNDP Defendants will address the arguments specific to granting the Motion
to Stay.
The issuance of a stay pending appeal “is not a matter of right”, but “an exercise of
judicial discretion.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 129 S. Ct. 1749 (2009). A stay of a pending
interlocutory order is appropriate when the party appealing an order can demonstrate that the
moving party is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal; whether the moving party is likely
to be irreparably harmed absent a stay; whether or not others will likely be harmed if the court
grants the stay; and whether the public interest supports granting the stay. Workman v. Bredesen,
486 F.3d 896, 905 (6th Cir. 2007); Ne. Ohio Coal. for Homeless & Serv. Employees Int'l Union,
12

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 13 of 16

Local 1199 v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1009 (6th Cir. 2006).

PageID 609

“These factors are not

prerequisites that must be met, but are interrelated considerations that must be balanced
together.” Cooey v. Strickland, 589 F.3d 210, 218 (6th Cir. 2009).
Given that none of these factors are satisfied here, Plaintiffs Motion to Stay must be
denied.
1. The Appeal Is Meritless
Plaintiffs put forth the same arguments in support of its Motion to Reconsider as grounds
for claiming its appeal has merit. As already demonstrated, the Motion to Reconsider has no
merit, and accordingly Plaintiffs appeal is meritless. This is especially so given the fact that
“[a]n appellate court reviews a district court's award of sanctions for abuse of discretion.”
Stalley v. Mt. States Health Alliance, 644 F.3d 349, 351 (6th Cir. 2011) (upholding imposition of
sanctions for bringing frivolous claims). In other words, it is not enough for the Plaintiffs to
demonstrate this Court was wrong, but the Court had abused its discretion in imposing sanctions.
Given this high threshold and the well supported Sanctions Order, the appeal is not likely to
succeed, and therefore, this factor weighs heavily in favor of denying the Motion to Stay.
2. Plaintiffs’ Counsel Will Suffer No Irreparable Harm
“Potential monetary damage does not constitute irreparable harm.” Baker v. Adams
County/Ohio Valley Sch. Bd., 310 F.3d 927, 930 (6th Cir. 2002). Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot
argue that having to pay sanctions would constitute “irreparable harm.” Rather, Plaintiffs make
the unsupported allegation that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s “professional reputation” is at stake if the
order is not stayed. (Motion to Stay at 8.) However, Plaintiffs’ counsel provides no evidentiary
support for this allegation and does not provide any of the news articles he alleges are impinging

13

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 14 of 16

PageID 610

his reputation 6. This lack of support is sufficient for the Court to conclude that no irreparable
harm will accrue to Plaintiffs’ counsel. Michigan Coalition of Radioactive Material Users, Inc.
v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir. 1991) (“In order to substantiate a claim that
irreparable injury is likely to occur, a movant must provide some evidence that the harm has
occurred in the past and is likely to occur again.”); see also Brown v. District of Columbia, Case
No. 12-799, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122987, *14 (D.D.C. 2012) (‘Because plaintiff fails to
present any evidence that, absent injunctive relief, her professional reputation or ability to obtain
future employment will be irreparably harmed beyond notional assertions that they will, the only
other contentions of irreparable harm made by the plaintiff "are merely financial, and thus, not
irreparable.”
Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of denying Plaintiffs Motion to Stay.
3. No Other Parties Will Be Injured If The Stay Is Not Issued
Plaintiffs do not allege that any other party would be injured as a result of not issuing the
stay, and therefore, this factor weighs in favor of denying the Motion to Stay.
4. The Public Interest Favors Imposing Sanctions
Part of the purpose of 28 U.S.C. § 1927 is to vindicate the “public interest” in ensuring
that the legal system is used for proper as opposed to vexatious purposes. See Ruderer v. Fines,
614 F.2d 1128, 1132 (7th Cir.1980) ("The penalty aspect of the rule serves to vindicate public
interests."); see also Trohimovich v. Comm'r, 776 F.2d 873 at 876 (9th Cir. 1985) ("[Sanctions
penalize] the needless expenditure of judicial time, and [effectuate] our intent to deter further
frivolous appeals.") When an attorney runs afoul of its provision the public interest then is by

6

Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s reputation is somehow hindered by the Sanctions Order, staying
that order will not alleviate this harm. The Sanctions Order remains valid until and unless the Sixth Circuit overturns
it, which is highly unlikely. Therefore, granting a stay will not cure or mitigate the alleged irreparable harm to
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s reputation.

14

Case 2:12-cv-02143-STA-cgc Document 38 Filed 09/21/12 Page 15 of 16

PageID 611

definition injured. Putting off the imposition of sanctions under this statute only delays righting
this public wrong.
Plaintiffs incorrectly claim that a failure to impose a stay will “result in permanent
chilling of attorney advocacy in defense of the Constitution,” but this is an unsupported
allegation. In fact, to the extent that the Sanctions Order has a chilling effect, it would be to chill
frivolous, unsupported, and vexatious litigation, which would obviously serve the public interest.
Accordingly, this factor too weighs heavily in favor of denying the Motion to Stay.
CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, the Court should deny the Motion to Reconsider and the Motion
to Stay. Further, to the extent necessary, given the frivolous arguments put forth for both
motions by the Plaintiffs and specifically, the simply factually false claims made by the Plaintiff,
the Court should consider imposing additional sanctions under 28 U.S.C. § 1927.
