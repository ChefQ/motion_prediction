INTRODUCTION

10

Defendants keep trying to frame this case as one related to the State of Nevada’s right

11

to discipline attorneys; it is not. This case is a civil rights case based upon the State Bar of

12

Nevada’s violation of Plaintiff’s first amendment rights. This case seeks to determine whether

13

the State Bar may initiate a discipline grievance for political speech, not to address the merits

14

of the Bar’s grievance against Plaintiff. This Court cannot allow the State Bar to avoid

15

accountability for their attempt, whether intentional or not, to discipline a political candidate

16

for his speech. Not only has Plaintiff been sanctioned, but his due process rights have been

17

deprived, and his ability to serve on the Southern Nevada Disciplinary Board of the State Bar

18

has been interrupted.

19

Defendants bring their Motion on the grounds that the Younger abstention doctrine

20

prevents this Court from interfering with their ongoing disciplinary process, now that a formal

21

complaint has been filed against Plaintiff. Plaintiff does not disagree with this point. Plaintiff,

22

however, recognizes that there is a difference between abstention and dismissal, and that

23

nothing within the Younger doctrine prevents this case from proceeding with respect to

24

Defendants’ due process violations of Plaintiff’s rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully

25

requests that this Court DENY Defendants’ Motion.

26

requests that his Court allow Plaintiff to either amend his complaint or stay these proceedings

27

until the state judicial process has been completed.

At the very least, Plaintiff respectfully

LEGAL ARGUMENT

3
4

A. STANDARD FOR MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendants have requested this Court dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.

5

12(b)(1) on the grounds that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. “In reviewing the Rule
6

12(b)(1) dismissal, we must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.” Carson
7

Harbor Village, Ltd. v. City of Carson, 353 F.3d 824, 826 (9th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). In
8

a 12(b)(1) analysis “[i]t is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and
9

the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.” Assoc. of
10

Am. Med. Colls. v. United States, 217 F.3d 770, 778 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting Kokkonen v.
11

Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673 (1994)).
12

Dismissal of a complaint is disfavored and should only be granted in “extraordinary”
13

cases. Calstar LLC v. First Union Nat’l Bank, 35 Fed. Appx. 602, **1 (9th Cir. 2002), citing
14

United States v. City of Redwood City, 640 F.2d 963, 966 (9th Cir.1981).

However,

15

“[d]ismissal can be based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient
16
7201 W. Lake Mead Blvd., Suite 210
Las Vegas, Nevada 89128
(702) 405-6700 Telephone
(702) 685-4184 Facsimile

facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.” Id., citing Balisteri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901
17

F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir.1988). If a complaint lacks facts to support a legal theory, but those
18

facts could easily be supplied, the complaint should not be dismissed without leave to amend.
19

See Id., citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (stating that leave to amend should be “freely given”); Lopez
20

v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (“[A] district court should grant leave
21

to amend ... unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation
22

of other facts.”(quoting Doe v. United States, 58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th Cir.1995))).
23
24

B. ABSTENTION SHOULD NOT APPLY IN THIS CASE
25

The United States Supreme Court has stated that abstention of the federal courts is the
26

exception, rather than the rule. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424
27

U.S. 800, 813 (1976). This very Court has stated that “[a]bstention under Younger ‘is a
28

OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS - 3

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 34 Filed 10/25/10 Page 4 of 8

1

jurisprudential doctrine rooted in overlapping principles of equity, comity, and federalism.’”

2

see Document 13-1, citing San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce Political Action

3

Comm. v. City of San Jose, 546 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir. 2008). “[T]he limited circumstances

4

in which abstention by federal courts is appropriate remain the exception rather than the rule.”

5

Id., citing San Jose at 1092 (quotation omitted). Principals of federal abstention “are not rigid

6

pigeonholes into which federal courts must try to fit cases.” Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481

7

U.S. 1, 11, n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 1526, n. 9, (1987). Further, and most importantly as it relates

8

to the basis for which Defendants bring the instant Motion to Dismiss, the Supreme Court has

9

rejected Younger as a question of subject matter jurisdiction. See New Orleans Public Service,

10

Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 358 (1989) (“NIOPSI”) and Ohio

11

Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 626 (1986).
Under very limited circumstances, the federal courts should abstain from interfering

(702) 685-4184 Facsimile

12
13

with ongoing state court proceedings.

See Colorado River, supra.

14

circumstances set forth in Younger. Middlesex County Ethics Comm. V. Garden State Bar

15

Ass’n sets forth a three part test for determining the applicability of Younger: 1) there are

16

ongoing state proceedings that are judicial in nature; 2) the state proceedings implicate

17

important state interests; and 3) the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise

18

federal claims. 457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982).

Included are the

At this point, however, Plaintiff is no longer asking this Court to interfere with the

20

existing proceeding; rather, Plaintiff is seeking damages for the harms that have already

21

occurred.

22

highly concerned about his ability to raise the constitutional issues he has with the discipline in

23

that matter, however, such will be the subject of an appeal, in some form, not injunctive relief

24

from this Court. Such does not, however, prevent Plaintiff from recovering for the wrongs that

25

have occurred in this case.

C. PLAINTIFF HAS RAISED CLAIMS UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE
GRANTED
Defendants have harmed Plaintiff. Plaintiff has pled those wrongs sufficiently. For
example, Plaintiff has pled the following:

4

32. On April 13, 2010, at around 10:30 am, Benjamin Spillman, a
reporter for the Las Vegas Review Journal, called Mr. Hafter at
his office.
33. During that call, Mr. Spillman informed Mr. Hafter that Phil
Pattee, Esq., assistant bar counsel for Defendant , stated that
not only was Defendant not investigating Masto for the
allegations of misconduct, but that “an investigation and a
grievance file has been opened in relation to Mr. Hafter
himself.”

10
11

Document 32 at 6. Mr. Pattee’s actions were a violation of the Supreme Court Rules related to

12

the confidentiality of a disciplinary matter. This violation of Plaintiff’s right to confidentiality

13

is not an on-going violation. It was done and over once Defendant Pattee spoke to the Review

14

Journal reporter. The breach of confidentiality caused the matter to be improperly tried in the

15

press, depriving Plaintiff of adequate due process in defending the claim in a private matter.

16

Such deprivation can be addressed by this Court, without concern about the abstention

17

doctrine.

18

Plaintiff has also suffered other harms which he has adequately pled. For example,

19

Plaintiff also pled that “[s]ince April 13, 2010, Hafter has been banned by Defendant Clark

20

from performing his duties related to sitting on the Southern Nevada Disciplinary Board of the

21

State Bar of Nevada.” Complaint at ¶53.

22

that he interfered with Plaintiff’s service as a member of the Southern Nevada Disciplinary

23

Board of the State Bar when he said that he “absolutely” prevented Plaintiff from servicing as a

24

hearing panel member for a disciplinary hearing. Document 33 at 16. Defendant Clark then

25

tried to justify such in his Motion. As this is ultimately a dispute of fact, however, such must

26

survive a motion to dismiss.

In his Motion, Defendant Clark has acknowledged

27

Defendant Clark then tried to suggest that even if he did improperly prevent Plaintiff

28

from serving on the disciplinary board, such does not interfere with Plaintiff’s property rights.

1

Such is a legally impotent argument and the fact that it comes from Bar Counsel is outright

2

shocking. Professional licenses have been deemed to be property rights in the State of Nevada.

3

See e.g., Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Court For Dist. of Arizona, 349 F.3d 1169 (9th.Cir.,2003) (citing In

4

re Poole, 222 F.3d 618, 620 (9th Cir.2000); Sabow v. United States, 93 F.3d 1445, 1456 (9th

5

Cir.1996); and Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55, 64, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979)). The

6

courts have further stated that “a professional license, once conferred, constitutes an

7

entitlement subject to constitutional protection.” Id. at 1179.

8

With a professional license comes several various rights. The ability to serve on a

9

disciplinary board in the State of Nevada is a right that comes with membership to the bar.

10

S.C.R. 103. Once appointed, “[m]embers of the disciplinary boards shall serve at the pleasure

11

of the board of governors, or for a term of three years, subject to reappointment for three

12

additional terms.” S.C.R. 103(2).

13

Disciplinary Board of the State Bar. Accordingly, Petitioner has a right to serve, either at the

14

pleasure of the Board of Governors or for his term. Defendants, as bar counsel, cannot

15

arbitrarily impinge on that right.

16

Complaint, that the Defendants have interfered with that right.

CONCLUSION

21

Whenever the government takes action to suppress political speech, it is a grave

22

concern to all Americans.

The instant action comes before the Court as a result of the State

23

Bar’s attempts to investigate and prosecute Plaintiff, an attorney and former candidate for

24

political office, as a result of comments he made regarding the incumbent, against whom he is

25

running. In doing so, Plaintiff suffered numerous harms for which he seeks recourse through

26

this action. For the above reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court allow this

27

matter to proceed.
