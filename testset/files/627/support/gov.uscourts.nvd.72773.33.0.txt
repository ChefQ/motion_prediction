CORPORATIONS A through Z, inclusive,

Defendants.

 

Defendants hereby move moves pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for an Order
dismissing Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint on the grounds that, as set forth below,
and as admitted in Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint, there are pre-existing ongoing
disciplinary proceedings before the State Bar against Plaintiff. Therefore, pursuant to the
Younger abstention doctrine, this Court should abstain in favor of the state judicial
proceedings.

Furthermore, Defendants move pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the
Second Amended Complaint on the grounds that additional allegations Plaintiff has

incorporated fail to state claims for which relief can be granted.

This motion is based on the pleadings and papers filed herein, the Memorandum of
Points and Authorities which follow, and upon such further evidence and argument of

counsel as the Court may require or allow.

HI.
STATEMENT OF FACTS.

The nature and organization of Defendant is established through Nevada statute and
rules promulgated by the Nevada Supreme Court. Defendant, State Bar of Nevada, is a

public corporation created by statute. Nev. Rev. Stat. 0x00A7 7.275 (2001) provides,

Continuation as public corporation powers; rules of supreme court

1. The State Bar of Nevada, a public corporation heretofore created by statute, is hereby
continued under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the supreme court.

2. The State Bar of Nevada has perpetual succession and a seal and it may sue and be
sued. it may, for the purpose of carrying into effect and promoting its objectives:

(a) Make contracts.

(b) Own, hold, use, manage and deal in and with real and personal property.

(c) Do all other acts incidental to the foregoing or necessary or expedient for the
administration of its affairs and the attainment of its purposes.

3. Rules for the government of the State Bar of Nevada shall be made by the supreme court
pursuant to NRS 2.120 (emphasis added).

Nevada Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 76 expands upon this language, and provides,

1. The State Bar of Nevada, a public corporation heretofore created by statute, shall govern
the legal profession in this state, subject to the approval of the supreme court. The state bar
is under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the supreme court and is an
association of persons now or hereafter regularly licensed to practice law in the State of
Nevada.

2. The state bar has perpetual succession and a seal and it may sue and be sued. It may, for
the purpose of carrying into effect and promoting its objectives, make contracts, own, hold,
use, manage and deal in and with real and personal property, subpoena witnesses for the
purpose of aiding in cases of discipline, suspension or disbarment, or application for
admission, and do all-other acts.incidental to the foregoing or necessary-or expedient for the
administration of its affairs and the attainment of its purposes (emphasis added).

Finally, with respect to discipline of Nevada-licensed attorneys, SCR 99 states,

1. Every attorney admitted to practice law in Nevada or specially admitted by a court of this
state for a particular proceeding, or practicing law here, whether specially admitted or not, is
subject to the exclusive disciplinary jurisdiction of the supreme court and the disciplinary
boards and hearing panels created by these rules.

2. Nothing contained in these rules denies any court the power to maintain control over
proceedings conducted before it, such as the power of contempt, nor do these rules prohibit
any association from censuring, suspending, or expelling its members.

Moreover, SCR 104(1), in pertinent part, designates and directs the authority of Bar Counsel,

1. State bar counsel shall:

(a) Investigate all matters involving possible attorney misconduct or incapacity called to
bar counsel's attention, whether by grievance or otherwise.

(b) Subject to Rule 105(1), dispose of all matters involving alleged misconduct by
dismissal of the allegation(s) or by the filing of a written complaint.

(c) Prosecute all proceedings under these rules before all forums in the name of the

State Bar of Nevada.

Plaintiff is a Nevada-licensed attorney. Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint, yen 16.

Plaintiff filed this Second Amended Complaint on September 2, 2010.
As admitted in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, the State Bar has filed a written

disciplinary Complaint on July 26, 2010, ({] 49) and Plaintiff has answered the Complaint

(J 50).
SCR 105(2)(Procedure on receipt of complaint) provides in pertinent part,

2. Commencement of formal proceedings. Formal disciplinary proceedings are
commenced by bar counsel filing a written complaint in the name of the state bar. The
complaint shall be sufficiently clear and specific to inform the attorney of the charges against
him or her and the underlying conduct supporting the charges. A copy of the complaint shall
be served on the attorney and it shall direct that a verified response or answer be served on
bar counsel within 20 days of service; the original shall be filed with bar counsel's office. The
time to respond may be extended once by the chair for not more than 20 days for good cause
or upon stipulation of the parties. In the event the attorney fails to plead, the charges shall be
deemed admitted; provided, however, that an attorney who fails to respond within the time
provided may thereafter obtain permission of the appropriate disciplinary board chair to do so,
if failure to file is attributable to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

(a) Challenges to and ad hoc appointments of panel members. The complaint shall be
served with the list of members of the appropriate disciplinary board. The attorney, or each if
more than one, and bar counsel may exercise five peremptory challenges each to the people
on the list by delivering such in writing to bar counsel on or before the date a response to the
complaint is due.

Challenges to any member for cause under Rule 103(7) shall be made as soon as
possible after receiving either actual or constructive notice of the grounds for disqualification,
and shall be made by motion to the chair in accordance with these rules. In no event will a
motion seeking the disqualification of a member be timely if the member has already heard,
considered or ruled upon any contested matter, except as to grounds based on fraud or like
illegal conduct of which the challenging party had no notice until after the contested matter
was considered. Any challenge that is not raised in a timely manner shall be deemed waived.

The chair may make ad hoc appointments to replace designated panel members in the
event challenges or disqualification reduce the number to less than the number required for
the hearing panel. Ad hoc appointees shall be subject to disqualification under Rule 103(7)
and any remaining peremptory challenges unexercised by either the attorney(s) or bar
counsel. A hearing panel as finally constituted shall include a non-lawyer.

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 4 of 28

(c) Time to conduct hearing; notice of hearing; discovery of evidence against attorney.
The hearing panel shall conduct a hearing within 45 days of assignment and give the attorney
at least 30 days' written notice of its time and place. The notice shall be served in the same
manner as the complaint, and shall inform the attorney that he or she is entitled to be
represented by counsel, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence. The notice
shall be accompanied by a summary prepared by bar counsel of the evidence against the
attorney, and the names of the witnesses bar counsel intends to call for other than
impeachment, together with a brief statement of the facts to which each will testify, all of which
may be inspected up to 3 days prior to the hearing. Witnesses or evidence, other than for
impeachment, which became known to bar counsel thereafter, and which bar counsel intends
to use at the hearing, shall be promptly disclosed to the attorney. For good cause shown, the
chair may allow additional time, not to exceed 90 days, to conduct the hearing.

(d) Quorum; time for decision of panel; votes required to impose discipline. Any five
members of the panel shall be a quorum. The hearing panel shall render a written decision
within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing, unless post-hearing briefs are requested by
either bar counsel or the attorney and allowed by the panel or requested by the chair, in which
event the decision shall be rendered within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing. The
decision shall be served pursuant to Rule 109(1), accompanied by the panel's findings and
recommendation, all of which shall be filed with bar counsel's office. A decision to impose or
recommend discipline requires the concurrence of four members of the panel.

(e) Rules of evidence; support of panel's decision. The rules applicable to the admission
of evidence in the district courts of Nevada govern admission of evidence before a hearing
panel. Evidentiary rulings shall be made by the chair of the panel, if one has been designated,
or by the chair of the appropriate disciplinary board prior to such a designation. The findings of
the panel must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.

Thus, there is a pre-existing judicial proceeding that is ongoing at the time Plaintiff filed his

Second Amended Complaint.

lll.
DISCUSSION.

Although defendant is the moving party on a motion to dismiss, plaintiff has the burden
of establishing subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff is the party invoking the court's
jurisdiction. Stock West, Inc. v. Confederated Tribes, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989).
Under a 12(b)(1) motion attacking the complaint on its face, the court must consider the

allegations of the complaint as true. See, i.e. Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 549

F.2d 884 (3d Cir. 1977).

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 5 of 28

A. The Abstention Doctrine Set Forth In Younger v. Harris Mandates
That This Court Refrain From Intervening In Ongoing Disciplinary
Proceedings.

In Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971), the United
States Supreme Court reversed the lower court order to enjoin prosecution and enforcement
of California's Criminal Syndicalism Act on the grounds it was unconstitutionally vague and
overbroad. The Supreme Court found that the injunction was, "a violation of the national
policy forbidding federal courts to stay or enjoin pending state court proceedings except
under special circumstances." /d., at 749 (citing 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2283, "A court of the United
States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly
authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or
effectuate its judgments."). The Supreme Court also reversed the declaratory judgment
entered by the lower court, noting that, "declaratory relief is also improper when a
prosecution involving the challenged statute is pending in state court at the time the federal
suit is initiated." /d at n. 2.

In Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 102
S. Ct. 2515, 73 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1982), the Supreme Court extended the abstention doctrine to
attorney discipline cases. Absent "extraordinary circumstances," abstention in favor of state
judicial proceedings is required if the state proceedings (1) are ongoing, (2) implicate
important state interests, and (3) provide the plaintiff an adequate opportunity to litigate
federal claims. /d. at 432.

The Court noted that the proceedings were judicial in nature given the New Jersey
Supreme Court's authority to regulate the admission and discipline of its attorneys and the
delegation of that authority to the ethics and grievance committees. /d. In addition, the Court

recognized that, "[t]he State's interest in the professional conduct of attorneys involved in the

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 6 of 28

administration of criminal justice is of special importance." /d. at 434. After finding all three

conditions present, the Court in Middlesex concluded,
The importance of the state interest in the pending state judicial proceedings and in the
federal case calls Younger abstention into play. So long as the constitutional claims of
respondents can be determined in the state proceedings and so long as there is no showing
of bad faith, harassment, or some other extraordinary circumstance that would make
abstention inappropriate, the federal courts should abstain.
Id. at 435. See also, Hirsh v. Justices of Supreme Court of State of California, 67 F.3d 708
(9th Cir. 1995) (affirming dismissal on abstention grounds of suit brought to enjoin
disciplinary proceedings and seeking declaratory relief).

Here, the disciplinary proceedings are clearly judicial in nature. Defendant State Bar
is under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Supreme Court. Nev. Rev. Stat. 0x00A7 7.275
and SCR 76. Further, the Supreme Court has delegated its discipline authority of attorneys
to include the disciplinary boards and hearing panels. SCR 99. Finally, Plaintiff's Complaint
acknowledges that the discipline proceedings were initiated on April 13, 2010, three days
before Plaintiff filed this action and are thus ongoing. See, Gilbertson v. Albright, 381 F.3d
965, n. 4 (9th Cir. 2004) ("The critical date for purposes of deciding whether abstention
principles apply is the date the federal action is filed.")

As to the final prong, the Supreme Court rules governing discipline allow Plaintiff the
opportunity to present constitutional claims, as respondents have done in the past. See, i.e.
In-re. Discipline of Schaefer, 117 Nev. 496, 25 P.3d 191, as mod. 31 P.3d 365 (2001)
(Supreme Court considered First Amendment arguments and found rule void for vagueness,
overturning finding of misconduct). Moreover, "Minimal respect for the state processes, of

course, precludes any presumption that the state courts will not safeguard federal

constitutional rights." Middlesex County, 457 U.S. at 431, 102 S. Ct. at 2521 (original

emphasis).

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 7 of 28

Furthermore, in its Order issued May 20, 2010 (Doc. # 24), this Court determined that
once the matter proceeds past the investigatory stage, judicial proceedings are commenced.
As such, at the time Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint, the State Bar had not
only commenced judicial proceedings, Plaintiff had joined them by filing an Answer.

The Younger abstention doctrine bars the federal court from enjoining state
disciplinary proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances which are not present here.
Therefore, Defendants request that this court dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint
and allow this matter to proceed through the discipline process.

B. Plaintiff's Additional Allegations Fail State Claims Upon
Which Relief Can Be Granted.

Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a claim may be dismissed either because it asserts a
legal theory that is not cognizable as a matter of law or because it fails to allege sufficient
facts to support an otherwise cognizable claim. See, SmileCare Dental Group v. Delta
Dental Plan of California, Inc., 88 F.3d 780, 782-3 (9th Cir. 1996). In considering such a
motion, the court must presume as true all well-pleaded allegations, resolve all doubts in
favor of the pleader, and view the pleadings in the light most favorable to the non-moving
party. See, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.
Ed. 2d 929 (2007).

In his Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff adds additional general facts,

5. On or about May 27, 2010, Mr. Clark informed Mr. Hafter that the

screening panel "voted unanimously to impose a Letter of Reprimand" against
Plaintiff as a result of the aforementioned facts.

6. To this date, Plaintiff has still not received a copy of the alleged Letter
of Reprimand.
7. Further, Defendants have refused to provide Plaintiff with a timely

hearing as required under the Supreme Court Rules along with all associated

due process rights.
8. In so doing, Defendants have violated Plaintiff's rights under the First

and Fourteenth Amendment [sic] and Plaintiff seeks any and all remedies
available to him at law.

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 8 of 28

Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff elaborates on these facts in paragraphs 41-52, which
includes an allegation that Plaintiff has not been provided with the specific legal standard that
will be used in the case against him ({] 51-2) and that Defendant Clark has "banned" Plaintiff
from performing Plaintiffs duties as a member of the Southern Nevada Disciplinary Board
(53).

Plaintiff also adds Counts II and II] to the original Amended Complaint. Count II
asserts that Defendants are violating Plaintiff's rights by chilling his political speech, are
refusing to allow him to see the proposed Letter of Reprimand, and refusing to provide the
legal standards to be used against Plaintiff. Second Amended Complaint, ff] 65-77. Count
lll is directed specifically against Defendant Clark and reiterates that Plaintiff feels Defendant
has "banned" him from participating in an admitted "voluntary" activity (82) and that this
somehow violates Plaintiff's right to practice law ({] 90).

First, to the extent that Plaintiff is re-asserting that Defendants' conduct impacts his
free speech rights, this Court has already addressed and ruled against Plaintiff on this issue.
In its Order (Doc. #24), the Court concluded that Plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of
success on the merits with respect to the political speech arguments. Order of May 20, 2010
(#24), pp. 7-8.

Second, with respect to the alleged refusal to allow Plaintiff to see the proposed Letter
of Reprimand, Plaintiff raises not only a red herring, but a false one, as well. Attached as
Exhibit A is the Affidavit of David A. Clark. Within it is a true and correct copy of an email
thread between Plaintiff and this Defendant regarding the proposed Letter of Reprimand
(Exhibit A-1). The full statement from Defendant Clark (rather than the edited version

contained in 0x00A7] 44 of the Second Amended Complaint) is,

| have your letter dated June 9, 2010 in which you object to the Letter of Reprimand and
request a formal hearing even though the State Bar has not yet served upon you the
proposed Letter of Reprimand under SCR 105(1)(b). Given your election, would you be

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 9 of 28

agreeable to foregoing the service of the proposed Letter of Reprimand under SCR
105(1)(b) and proceeding directly to filing of the complaint and setting the matter for
hearing? As you know, informal hearings are based upon the proposed Letter of
Reprimand and formal hearings proceed upon the filing of complaint.

In response to this offer, Plaintiff replied (rather than the edited version contained in {| 45 of
the Second Amended Complaint),
Whatever moves this process along. It appears that now (perhaps because the election

is over and | lost), the Bar is no longer in a rush to deal with this matter. | want to get this
matter resolved as soon as possible.

Further, | am anxious to see the evidence that was presented to the screening panel,
which | presume | would be part of the complaint.

| will accept service for any documents you wish to provide.

Plaintiff chose to proceed to a formal hearing, which entails the filing of a formal
complaint. Plaintiff chose to waive service of the Letter of Reprimand in order to move the
process along to hearing.

The State Bar never "refused" to allow" Plaintiff to see the Letter of Reprimand.
Plaintiff declined it in favor of a formal hearing. For Plaintiff to now claim that his inability to
see the Letter of Reprimand is a constitutional infirmity is both disingenuous and, frankly, of
no moment procedurally. Plaintiff has been served with the State Bar's complaint and has
answered. The complaint is the charging document the State Bar must prosecute and that
Plaintiff must defend. This lament about the proposed Letter of Reprimand fails to state any
cognizable right, injury, or detriment to Plaintiff.

Second, Plaintiffs claims that he is being denied the right to know the legal standards
for the charges against him suffer from the same defects. First, as clearly set forth in SCR

105(2)(e) above,

(e) Rules of evidence; support of panel's decision. The rules applicable to the admission of
evidence in the district courts of Nevada govern admission of evidence before a hearing
panel. Evidentiary rulings shall be made by the chair of the panel, if one has been designated,
or by the chair of the appropriate disciplinary board prior to such a designation. The findings
of the panel must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. (emphasis added).

Case 2:10-cv-00553-PMP-LRL Document 33 Filed 10/08/10 Page 10 of 28

Moreover, the Panel's decision to impose discipline must be with the concurrence of four of
five Panel members. SCR 105(2)(d). How much plainer can the Supreme Court make it?

If that was not enough, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Dismiss the discipline complaint.
After objecting to the Chair of the Northern Board hearing the matter based upon an
appearance of impropriety, the Vice-Chair, Julien G. Sourwine, considered and denied
Plaintiff's Motion. When Plaintiff complained that the decision was not clear enough, Mr.
Sourwine issued an Amended Decision, a true and correct copy of which is attached as
Exhibit A-2. In addition, the fact that Plaintiff has personal knowledge of SCR 105 since he
has sat as a member of hearing panels just seals the indictment of Plaintiff's alleged claim in
this regard.

Third, Plaintiff has not been "banned" from serving on hearing panels and he knows it.

SCR 105(2)(a) provides,

Challenges to and ad hoc appointments of panel members. The complaint shall be served
with the list of members of the appropriate disciplinary board. The attorney, or each if more
than one, and bar counsel may exercise five peremptory challenges each to the people on the
list by delivering such in writing to bar counsel on or before the date a response to the
complaint is due.
Did the undersigned peremptorily challenge Plaintiff from a discipline hearing? Absolutely.
But such is bar counsel's right under the rule and no reason be given or is needed in
order to exercise that right. If Plaintiff has a problem with subsection (a) of the rule, he can
take it up with the Nevada Supreme Court. Moreover, attached as Exhibit A-3 is a true and
correct copy of an email thread between Plaintiff and the Office of Bar Counsel, in which
Plaintiff is informed that he is not on a banned list, but was simply peremptorily challenged on
a particular hearing. Finally, attached as Exhibit A-4 is a true and correct copy of a letter
confirming that Plaintiff is serving as a member of an upcoming hearing Panel that must

reconvene on a case. Therefore, he has not been "banned" from serving panels even

involving the undersigned.
