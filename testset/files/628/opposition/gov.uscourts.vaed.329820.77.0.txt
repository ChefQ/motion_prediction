Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 5 of 36 PageID# 2176

INTRODUCTION
PM seeks to require its supplier, American Accessories International, L.L.C., to pay
millions of dollars in costs for PM’s voluntary recall of its 3-in-1 Flashlight after it received four
reports that the matches in the product had ignited unintentionally.1 But PM—not AAI—
dictated the design of the Flashlight through its own specifications. AAI is thus not liable for
any alleged design defect. Nor is AAI liable for PM’s unilateral decision to implement a
voluntary product replacement recall. PM implemented this recall based on concerns about its
own failure to timely report the consumer incidents to the Consumer Product Safety
Commission. And it rejected, with no valid reason, AAI’s more effective, quicker, and less
expensive proposal to provide consumers with instructions on how to prevent unintended
ignitions. Each of PM’s claims fails as matter of law. At a minimum, PM is not entitled to
summary judgment because each of the elements of its claims depends on disputed issues of
material fact.
As a threshold matter, all of PM’s claims are based on its contention that the Flashlight
was defective. But whether a product is defective is a quintessential question of fact for the jury
to decide. Here, the jury will need to wrestle with the contradiction between the central premise
of PM’s entire case (that the Flashlight was defective) and the statements of PM’s key witness.
According to Rick Clements, the PM buyer who dictated the product design,
Ex. 1 (emphasis in original). In light of the conflict
between PM’s current litigation position and the pre-litigation statements of its own witness (not
to mention abundant evidence and expert opinion that the Flashlight is not unreasonably
dangerous), the Court simply cannot decide this threshold, factual issue as a matter of law. This
alone requires denial of PM’s motion.

1

Although PM USA is the Plaintiff, AAI dealt with other Altria entities in the project: Altria
Client Services, Inc. and Altria Group Distribution Company. Unless otherwise indicated, we
refer to them collectively as “PM.”

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 6 of 36 PageID# 2177

Moreover, even if the Flashlight were defective, PM is not entitled to summary judgment
because AAI did not breach any contractual provisions or implied warranty. First, AAI did not
breach the express warranties in the Purchase Orders because it manufactured the product
according to PM’s precise specifications. Under Virginia law, AAI cannot be held liable for
design defects in a custom product made to PM’s own specifications. PM drafted and controlled
the specifications and required AAI to follow them. AAI should be entitled to judgment as a
matter of law on this basis. At a minimum, PM’s assertion that AAI did not follow PM’s
specifications is an issue of fact for the jury to decide.
Second, PM’s claim that AAI breached the Indemnity Clause of the Purchase Order fails
as a matter of law because that clause does not apply. It is displaced by the more-specific
express warranties in the Purchase Orders, which set forth specific conditions regarding the
liability of the parties based on alleged product defects and provide exclusive remedies for any
violations. Even if the Indemnity Clause did apply, PM cannot establish breach as a matter of
law because it depends on the disputed factual issues of which party was at fault and the extent to
which each party’s conduct caused the harm.
Third, PM’s implied warranty of merchantability claim fails as a matter of law because
the express warranty conflicts with and displaces any potential implied warranty. And even if an
implied warranty did apply, there is a fact-intensive question of whether the Flashlight is not fit
for its ordinary purpose because it is defective, an issue that the jury must decide.
Fourth, even if PM could establish a breach of contract or implied warranty, it cannot
demonstrate as a matter of law that the breach proximately caused PM’s claimed losses.
Finally, PM is not entitled to the damages that it is seeking as a matter of law. PM is
seeking to recover both a refund of the price it paid for the Flashlight and reimbursement for the
cost of replacement, but the contract provides for those remedies as alternative remedies and
does not permit such a double recovery. Moreover, there is ample evidence that PM breached its
duty to mitigate damages.

Thus, for the reasons stated herein, and in AAI’s motion for summary judgment and
supporting memorandum, the Court should deny PM’s motion for summary judgment and grant
summary judgment in favor of AAI.
BACKGROUND
A.

PM’s Mandatory Process for Product Development.

AAI manufactures and delivers custom products for PM, in accordance with PM’s
detailed specifications, for PM to distribute to its customers. Because AAI has close
relationships with leading manufacturing factories in China, it can deliver products to PM
efficiently and in compliance with PM’s strict specifications and quality assurance standards.
Over the course of the last 20 years, AAI has worked with PM on hundreds of projects and has
always received the highest marks from PM for its service, quality, and compliance with PM’s
policies and product specifications.
PM requires its suppliers to follow strict specifications in manufacturing a product. PM
required AAI to agree to PM’s Marketing Incentives Quality Assurance Guidelines for Suppliers
(“Supplier Guidelines”), which are designed to provide PM

Ex. 2; Ex. 3. The Supplier Guidelines made it clear that PM, through its own
third party Quality Assurance firm, was responsible for the product specifications, and
specifically for product safety:

Ex. 2 (emphasis added). PM hired Underwriters
Laboratories (“UL”), an industry leader in consumer product safety, to serve as its third-party
QA firm. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 28:18-29:17; 33:2-18; 46:16-47:1). UL’s representative, Mary
Isemann, worked full-time at PM’s facilities, and her office was in close proximity with Rick
Clements, PM’s project leader for the 3-in-1 Flashlight. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 38:9-21).

B.

The Development of the 3-in-1 Flashlight.

In response to a request from PM for product ideas for its outdoor marketing theme, AAI
proposed a product with three related functions: a flashlight, a compass, and a storage
compartment for matches (or other items). Notably, AAI’s proposal was not for matches to be
included with the product. Ex. 5; Ex. 6 (D. Zeanah Dep. 85:23-86:7). Rather, under AAI’s
proposal, consumers could supply their own matches, if they so chose. PM insisted, however,
that matches be included with the flashlight. Ex. 7 (Simers Dep. 34:1-35:13). PM also made
multiple rounds of design modifications to the Flashlight to suit its preferences, including the
location of the striker pad. Ex. 8 (AAI’s Answers to PM’s Interrogatory Nos. 12 & 13).
In accordance with the Supplier Guidelines, Ms. Isemann prepared and revised the
specifications for the 3-in-1 Flashlight. Her specifications enumerated the various types of
testing that AAI was required to perform on the Flashlight, including testing on the matches. Ex.
9; Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 158:3-16). AAI signed and approved the final specifications, indicating
that it would provide the Flashlight in accordance with them. Ex. 9. There is no dispute that
AAI met all of PM’s and UL’s specifications for the Flashlight.
PM was also intricately involved in the preparation of the instruction sheet that
accompanied the flashlight when it was sent to consumers. PM made specific changes to the
instruction sheet, including deleting a safety warning proposed by AAI and directing AAI to
move a warning about the flashlight battery: “I think all the warnings should go in the back . . .
would prefer that the 1st thing a consumer sees is not a warning . . . .” Ex. 11; Ex. 10; Ex. 12
(Clements Dep. 147:17-150:5). At no point did PM tell AAI that there should be any warning
about the risk of unintended ignition or any instructions regarding the use of the foam barrier.
UL did not do any safety testing on the Flashlight. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep., 28:3-6; 90:2191:8). Although Ms. Isemann asked PM for a complete sample of the flashlight, and AAI had
provided PM with samples of the flashlight that included matches, PM did not provide Isemann
with samples that included matches. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 145:8-21).

C.

AAI’s Swift Response to the Customer Incidents.

PM distributed 3-in-1 Flashlights to its customers who specifically requested them. On
March 4, 2014, PM received two reports from consumers of unintended ignitions of matches in
the storage compartment. PM notified AAI of the incidents. At PM’s request, AAI immediately
contacted the consumers to obtain details about what had occurred. AAI then conducted its own
testing to see whether it could recreate the unintended ignition. AAI was able to recreate the
unintended ignition under the following, limited scenario: if the match container had a certain
number of matches; the foam barrier was not included in the compartment; and the Flashlight
was held upside down such that the matchheads would fall to the end of the compartment where
the striker pad was located; and the compass cap was then screwed on and off the Flashlight
“like a pepper grinder.” Ex. 13. AAI promptly reported these results to PM in writing on
March 9, 2014. Ex. 13.
Notwithstanding the fact that AAI had told PM and UL that it had replicated the
ignition—and exactly how—UL (a leading QA firm) was unable to do so in two rounds of
testing, and PM reported the “good news” back to AAI. Ex. 14; Ex. 12 (Clements Dep. 181:11182:16). Unbeknownst to AAI, UL had experienced an unintended ignition when one of the
flashlight samples was being prepped for testing. Ex. 15; Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 216:19-218:9;
222:19-226:6). But PM did not report this incident to AAI. Moreover, PM also failed to advise
AAI of a third reported incident, which PM received on March 14, 2014. Ex. 8 (AAI’s Answers
to PM’s Interrogatory No. 3).
Nonetheless, based on these two reports and AAI’s testing, AAI suggested on March 7,
2014 (just two days after receiving notice of the incidents) sending consumers a follow-up notice
advising them that the foam barrier should be kept in place between the matchheads and the
striker pad. Ex. 16; Ex. 17 (E. Zeanah Dep. 107:22-111:18). Two days later, AAI again
recommended instructing consumers that, if they had discarded their foam barrier, AAI would
provide a replacement foam barrier at no cost to the consumer. Ex. 13; Ex. 17 (E. Zeanah Dep.
137:5-138:4). PM, including its in-house attorney, Michael Sieja, as well as at least one outside

-5-

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 10 of 36 PageID# 2181

counsel, agreed with this approach and participated extensively in the drafting of the notice that
would be sent to consumers. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 40:10-41:20; 45:7-51:8). Mr. Sieja
acknowledged that during this period AAI was working collaboratively with PM, was following
PM’s protocol and was making proposals to help the consumers. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 65:8-21).
By March 14, 2014, PM’s Brand, Compliance, and Legal departments had all approved the mass
email plan. See Ex. 19.
D.

PM’s Voluntary Recall.

Although PM agreed with the approach recommended by AAI, PM allowed several
weeks to pass and had not sent out the notice by Friday, April 4, 2014, when PM received notice
of a fourth reported incident. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 89:2-90:1). In this incident, Mr. Lowes claimed
that the 20 matches in the Flashlight had caused the heavy, metallic flashlight to “explode,”
causing a deep cut and left “shrapnel” imbedded in his hand, and demanded that PM pay him
$18,000. Ex. 20. PM decided not to investigate the Lowes incident. Ex. 21 (Crosthwaite Dep.
79:17-80:2).
At this point, PM consulted with Mr. Eric Rubel, an attorney at Arnold & Porter who
specializes in Consumer Product Safety Commission issues. The CPSC’s regulations provide
that a company can be fined up to $15.15 million if it does not notify the CPSC of a safety
hazard within ten business days after receiving notice of the incident. PM Mem. at 8. As of
April 4, 2014, PM had been sitting on the first two consumer reports for more than ten days.
Then, during a 72-hour period over the weekend of Friday, April 4, to Monday, April 7, PM and
its counsel hatched a preemptive plan to inform the CSPC of the incidents and recall the
Flashlight. PM reported the incidents to the CPSC on April 8, 2014, and proposed a “fast-track”
recall where consumers would return the compass cap in exchange for a premium replacement
product. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 60:2-63:1). PM did not consult AAI about its proposal; AAI
learned of PM’s plan after PM had already contacted the CPSC. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 52:353:24).

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 11 of 36 PageID# 2182

E.

The Purchase Orders.

PM claims that the Purchase Orders for the Flashlight require AAI to pay PM at least
$6.5 million (plus attorneys’ fees) for costs associated with its recall and this litigation. The
Purchase Orders contain the following three provisions at issue here.
13.
Warranties. Supplier warrants that all Goods delivered under Order will
(a) conform strictly to the general description, model number or specifications
stated in this Order or provided by Supplier and in any manufacturer warranties
that accompany the Goods, (b) be free from defects in materials, workmanship,
and design, and (c) be of first quality and made of new materials and components.
With respect to any Goods designed by Supplier or any of Supplier’s
subcontractors or suppliers, Supplier assumes and acknowledges full and
complete responsibility for the suitability, adequacy, and safety of the design of
such Goods.
14.
Quality Control. Supplier must comply with Buyer's Quality Assurance
Guidelines in effect as of the date of this Order. Buyer has the right (but not the
obligation) to audit Supplier’s quality control through an independent quality
assurance agent. Buyer, or it [sic] designee has the right to pre-inspect and preapprove each plant in which Goods are produced. Material testing, by an
accredited testing company at Supplier's expense, is required on all components
of Goods produced by Supplier for off-shore shipments. Buyer will provide the
material testing requirements for each such component to Supplier under separate
cover. Supplier must provide the test results to Buyer and its quality assurance
agent before production begins.
16. Indemnity. To the greatest extent permitted by law, Supplier agrees to
indemnify Buyer, its affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, directors,
and agents against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) to the extent they arise from, or
may be attributable to, any error, omission or fault of Supplier or any of its
personnel in the performance under this Order.
Ex. 23 (emphasis added).
STATEMENT OF FACTS AS TO WHICH THERE IS A GENUINE ISSUE
AAI herein responds to the “Undisputed Material Facts” (UMFs) set forth in PM’s
Memorandum. PM Mem. at 2–13. AAI specifically denies each and every heading appearing
within the UMFs, as well as all assertions not expressly deemed “undisputed.” Furthermore,
AAI incorporates by reference the Undisputed Material Facts set forth in its own Motion for

-7-

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 12 of 36 PageID# 2183

Summary Judgment. See ECF No. 44, pp. 2–8. The paragraphs below correspond to the section
headings set forth in PM’s UMFs.
A-1. Disputed. AAI did not “develop[] promotional product concepts.” AAI researched
existing survival products to create a set of proposed item concepts, each of which would have
been a “custom” item created to PM’s own specifications. See Ex. 7 (Simers Dep. 34:1-20;
40:20-23; 42:18-21); Ex. 12 (Clements Dep. 35:13-22).
A-2. Disputed. AAI did not design the Flashlight—this was a custom product created to
PM’s own specifications. Ex. 12 (Clements Dep. 35:13-22); Ex. 17 (E. Zeanah Deposition 94:996:22). Diane Pinkney admitted that a custom item such as the Flashlight was one that PM either
completely designed or modified based on a request. Ex. 24 (Pinkney Dep. 46:11-14). AAI did
not “redesign[] the Flashlight to add a striker pad inside the match compartment” based on input
from its Chinese manufacturer. AAI’s original proposal did not include matches, let alone a
striker pad. Ex. 5; Ex. 6 (D. Zeanah Dep. 85:23-86:7); Ex. 7 (Simers Dep. 43:23-44:2; 55:456:3). PM dictated that matches be included in the product. Ex. 7 (Simers Dep. 34:1-35:17;
55:1-3). When AAI advised PM that it had not previously been involved with products that
included matches, PM responded that it had done so previously and assured AAI that it would be
fine because PM’s legal team had approved. Ex. 25. PM also dictated the location of the striker
pad. After PM insisted that standard safety matches (not “strike anywhere” matches) be
included, AAI recommended that the flashlight include striker sheets in poly bags, separated
from the matches, or that a striker pad be placed on the outside of the flashlight. Ex. 8 (AAI’s
Answers to PM’s Interrogatory Nos. 12 & 13). But PM rejected these proposals, and instead
required that the striker pad be affixed inside the flashlight. Id. The only place the striker pad
could be affixed was on the underside of the compass end, which is where it was placed. Id.
PM further controlled the design of the flashlight because the specifications were
provided by UL on PM’s behalf. See Ex. 9. AAI further disputes that it “took credit for
developing and designing the Flashlight.” AAI never once stated that it was responsible for the
“design” of the Flashlight. Rather, AAI worked with PM to develop a custom product based on
-8-

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 13 of 36 PageID# 2184

PM’s own specifications and directions. Ex. 12 (Clements Dep. 35:13-22); Ex. 17 (E. Zeanah
Dep. 38:4-10; 94:9-96:22); Ex. 24 (Pinkney Dep. 46:11-14).
A-3. Disputed. AAI was not the “creator” of the instruction sheet. The instruction sheet
was reviewed and altered by PM. Ex. 26; Ex. 11. PM provided specific directives and retained
ultimate control and approval. See Ex. 26; Ex. 11. PM made extensive edits and changes to the
instruction sheet, including deleting an optional match warning proposed by AAI, and directing
AAI to move a warning about the flashlight battery. See Ex. 26; Ex. 11.
A-4. Disputed. PM dictated all the pre-production specifications and testing
requirements relating to the Flashlight product. In its Supplier Guidelines, PM represented to
AAI that PM

Ex. 2; Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 46:16-47:1). PM’s Supplier Guidelines provided that PM and the
QA firm would determine the specifications for the products—including any appropriate testing:

Ex. 2. The specifications were mandatory:
Id. PM hired UL, an industry
leader in consumer product safety, as the QA firm. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 28:18-29:17; 33:2-18;
46:16-47:1). UL’s representative was Mary Isemann. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 38:9-21).
AAI also disputes that it “drafted the initial specifications.” Ms. Isemann had previously
prepared specifications for another flashlight supplied by AAI to PM a couple of years earlier
(the prior flashlight did not involve matches). Ex. 27 (Smith Dep. 95:22-97:14). Accordingly, at
the request of Mr. Clements, AAI sent Ms. Isemann a first draft of Concept Specification
Analysis (“CSA”). Ex. 27 (Smith Dep. 76:3-77:12; 82:5-21). This draft was based entirely on
the specifications for the previous flashlight, which Ms. Isemann drafted. Ex. 27 (Smith Dep.
-9-

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 14 of 36 PageID# 2185

76:3-77:12); Ex. 28. AAI’s draft did not include specifications for matches or any required
testing for matches.2 Ms. Isemann prepared the specifications for the 3-in-1 Flashlight, adding in
the new specifications and testing requirements that the flashlight and the matches had to meet.
Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 158:3-16). The Specifications Analysis (SA) went through six revisions
before it was finalized. Ex. 9; Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 156:8-158:16; 161:10-13). In those six
revisions, Ms. Isemann, not AAI, added numerous specifications, including labeling
requirements, performance testing requirements, and inspection checklists. Ex. 9. One of the
performance testing requirements Ms. Isemann added in the very first revision was “testing for
matches.” Ex. 29; Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep., 128:1-129:7). Ms. Isemann also added to the SA’s preshipment inspection checklist whether the “match-barrier sponge” was present. Ex. 29; Ex. 4
(Isemann Dep. 132:21-134:14). Moreover, the SA is prepared under ALCS’s logo, not AAI’s,
and is a PM/Altria document. Ex. 9; Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 156:8-158:2; 161:10-13).
PM criticizes the fact that the CSA and SA characterized a potentially missing match
barrier sponge as a major defect, rather than a critical defect. PM Mem. at 5. However, the
characterization of a missing match barrier sponge as a major defect, rather than as a critical
defect, was made by UL, not AAI. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 138:6-20). Although PM asserts that
AAI never told PM that the foam insert was intended to protect against unintended ignition, PM
Mem. at 5, Ms. Isemann testified that she knew the foam insert prevented the matchheads from
coming in contact with the striker pad. Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 130:12-19).
PM also asserts that SGS, a third party testing company that AAI used to test whether the
Flashlight met all the tests required by PM’s SA, made testing suggestions that were not shared
with PM, nor incorporated into the specifications prepared by UL on behalf of PM. PM Mem. at
5. This is incorrect. The two “unintended ignition” tests—(1) a heating test, and (2) a drop
test—were required by the CSA and SA prepared by UL on behalf of PM. Ex. 9; Ex. 30.
2

When AAI sent the draft specifications on August 27, 2013, PM had already dictated that
matches be included. The draft specs thus stated “matches,” but did not contain any particular
specifications for the matches or testing that must be performed on the matches. Ex. 31.

- 10 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 15 of 36 PageID# 2186

Although the product passed both these pre-shipment tests, Ex. 4 (Isemann Dep. 70:8-72:19),
neither test would have uncovered the problem of intended ignition from removing the foam
barrier and twisting the product upside down like a pepper grinder. See Ex. 13.
A-5. Disputed. AAI does not dispute that two consumer reports were received on
March 4, 2014, and that AAI took prompt action to help resolve the reported issues. However,
PM is the party that decided to halt all further shipments of the Flashlight product and pursue a
fast-track recall. Ex. 8 (AAI’s Answers to PM’s Interrogatory No. 9). Contrary to PM’s
assertions, AAI never once “conceded” that the Flashlight product was defective. PM fails to
provide in its UMFs any specific factual support for their assertions of concessions. Later on in
its Memorandum, PM points to the actions that AAI undertook in the wake of the initial
consumer complaints as proof of “concessions” of defect. See PM Mem. at 18–20. But, as
discussed in detail below, these are not, in fact, “concessions,” and evidence of AAI’s
subsequent remedial measures is inadmissible to prove a defect in the product’s design.
Moreover, as Rick Clements stated:
Ex. 1. AAI disputes that its CPSC expert, Nancy Nord, made any “concessions”
regarding what the product instructions “should have” included. The deposition testimony PM
cites in its UMFs does not demonstrate—and the testimony immediately following PM’s selected
excerpts refutes—any such “concession.” See Ex. 32 (Nord Dep. 46:5-48:4).
B. Undisputed.
C. Disputed. AAI does not dispute that PM received the three cited incident reports, but
AAI disputes the truth of the alleged injuries and causes contained within the reports. PM never
investigated the claims included in the April 4, 2014 incident report. Ex. 21 (Crosthwaite Dep.
79:17-80:2). AAI also disputes PM’s statement that AAI advised that PM should “simply send
revised instructions.” By the time PM received this April 4, 2014 incident report, AAI had spent
the past month attempting to get PM to email a notice to consumers to address the unintentional
ignitions. Ex. 33; Ex. 13; Ex. 8 (AAI’s Answers to PM’s Interrogatory No. 9). AAI could not
send out the mass email itself, as PM had all of the consumers’ email addresses and wanted to
- 11 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 16 of 36 PageID# 2187

send the email from a PM-brand email address. Ex. 34. Mr. Sieja acknowledged that during this
period AAI was working collaboratively with PM, was following PM’s protocol, and was
making proposals to help the consumers. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 65:8-21).
On April 4, 2014, PM received notice of a purported incident reported by Mr. J.D.
Lowes. Ex. 20. That day, PM asked Eric Zeanah to participate that afternoon in a conference
call to discuss the incident. See Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 80:5-22). When PM asked Mr. Zeanah what
he intended to do in response to the incident report, Mr. Zeanah responded that he thought the
notice he had proposed a month earlier should be sent out and asked whether PM had given final
approval to the much-discussed notice. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 86:5-87:21; 94:19-96:2). PM
responded that it was thinking about it, and would let AAI know its position. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep.
101:6-17).
PM did not, however, get back to AAI. Ex. 18 (Sieja Dep. 101:18-21). Instead, just four
days later (with two of those days being the intervening weekend), PM reported the four
incidents to the CPSC on April 8, 2014. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 52:3-53:24). AAI learned of PM’s
report only after it had been completed. Id. The report did not just advise of the four incidents,
but also proposed that the flashlight be recalled and that consumers receive a premium
replacement product. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 60:2-63:1).
After learning of PM’s report, AAI’s counsel spoke with PM’s in-house counsel and
expressed AAI’s position that the Flashlight did not need to be rendered useless and returned,
because the issue could be addressed through a quicker and more effective follow-up notice
advising consumers they needed to use the foam barrier. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 167:1-171:3); see
also Ex. 35; Ex. 36; Ex. 37. PM rejected that approach. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 167:1-171:3). AAI
then followed up with an email to PM, reiterating AAI’s position that a full recall of the
flashlight was unnecessary and reserving AAI’s rights on this issue. Ex. 37; see also Ex. 35.
AAI disputes that its proposed plan to send consumers revised instructions “would have
faced significant challenges.” Nancy Nord, a former Commissioner of the CPSC, concluded that
it would have been appropriate for PM to include either a revised instruction sheet that reminded
- 12 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 17 of 36 PageID# 2188

consumers of the need to keep the foam barrier between the matchheads and the striker pad, or
alternatively, by providing the consumers with a video explaining how to remove the striker pad
from the underside of the compass cap, just as AAI has proposed. Ex. 38.
AAI also disputes that PM’s recall plan “was both appropriate under the circumstances
and reasonable in execution.” PM attempts to suggest there is no factual dispute on the issue of
the recall because Ms. Nord purportedly testified in her deposition that she did not have an issue
with how PM’s recall was conducted. PM Mem. at 12. This is a misstatement of Ms. Nord’s
testimony. Ms. Nord was asked whether, if she put aside her opinion that PM should have
pursued an instruction or repair approach, she might have any criticism of how PM conducted
the recall. Ex. 32 (Nord Dep. 118:12-120:11). Ms. Nord testified that, if she accepted the
premise of taking the route chosen by PM, she did not have any criticisms of how the recall was
conducted. Id. Nevertheless, her opinion was and remained that PM could have gone forward
with a quicker, more effective, and far less expensive route of a revised instruction sheet and/or a
video, both of which were suggested by AAI.
D. Disputed. AAI does not dispute that the Purchase Orders were part of the operative
contract documents. AAI does dispute, however, that the Purchase Orders were the sole
governing documents—the Purchase Orders explicitly incorporate by reference PM’s Supplier
Guidelines, which (i) specified that its QA firm (here, UL) would review the product design for
product safety, and (ii) required AAI to adhere rigorously to PM’s product specifications. Ex. 23.

PM Has Not Established That the Flashlight Was Defective as a Matter of Law.
All of the claims on which PM has moved for summary judgment (breach of contract,

breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranty) hinge on a disputed factual issue:
whether the Flashlight is unreasonably dangerous and thus defective. PM’s two alleged breaches
of the Warranty Clause are both predicated on a purported design defect. PM alleges that AAI
breached the first sentence of the Warranty Clause because the Flashlight was not “free from
defects” in “design.” PM Mem. at 17 (emphasis added). Plaintiff also alleges that AAI breached
the second sentence of the Warranty Clause because it failed to “assume and acknowledge full
and complete responsibility for the suitability, adequacy, and safety of the design” of the
Flashlight. PM Mem. at 20 (emphasis added). Likewise, PM’s alleged breach of the Indemnity
Clause depends on the same alleged breach of the Warranty Clause and an allegation that AAI
“delivered a product that was defective in its actual design.” PM Mem. at 23. Finally, PM

- 14 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 19 of 36 PageID# 2190

alleges that the Flashlight breached the implied warranty of merchantability because it contained
the risk that it could “explode upon use.” PM Mem. at 26.
Virginia law is unequivocal that the issue of defect should be decided by the jury.
Indeed, “[n]o reported Virginia case has found a product design unreasonably dangerous and
thus defective as a matter of law.” Robert Draim, Virginia Practice: Products Liability § 3:4 n.2
(emphasis added). The Court should deny PM’s motion on this threshold basis alone.
A.

The Issue of Design Defect Must Be Decided by the Jury.

In addressing whether a product is defective in design, Virginia employs a “reasonably
safe/unreasonably dangerous” standard. Va. Prac. Products Liability § 3:4. The Virginia
Supreme Court has made it clear that “[t]he issue whether a product is unreasonably dangerous is
a question of fact.” Morgen Indus., Inc. v. Vaughan, 252 Va. 60, 65-66 (1996) (citing Singleton
v. Int’l Harvester Co., 685 F.2d 112, 115 (4th Cir. 1981)). Moreover, just because a product
could be safer does not mean that the product is unreasonably dangerous and defective as a
matter of law. Young v. J.I. Case Co., No. 3:90CV00630, 1994 WL 506403, at *5 (E.D. Va.
June 3, 1991) (“Academically, it may be argued that all products are defective because they can
be made more safe. However, it does not automatically follow that the products are deemed
unreasonably dangerous.”).
PM itself concedes that “in product liability cases, the question of defect is typically left
for the jury . . . .” PM Mem. at 17. PM attempts to evade this well-settled principle of law by
claiming that “this is not a product liability case” and is “a case sounding in contract.” PM Mem.
at 17. Yet PM does not offer a shred of legal or logical support for why this established
definition of defect under Virginia law would not apply here. Nor could it, because PM itself
cites to Virginia products liability law to define this concept. See, e.g., id. (citing Va. Prac.
Products Liability § 3:5). Thus, by PM’s own admission, the question of defect is one for the
jury to decide and is not appropriate for summary judgment.

B.

There is a Factual Dispute Whether the Product Is Defective.

There is a clear factual dispute whether the Flashlight is defective. PM’s own project
manager for the Flashlight, Rick Clements, admitted after PM had received the two initial
consumer reports and after AAI investigated and reported on those two incidents:
Ex. 1. PM is plainly not entitled to judgement
as a matter of law on this issue.
AAI’s product design expert, Dr. Elizabeth Buc, also examined the Flashlight and
concluded that the product was not defective: “The multi-party data, analyses and inspection
reports support the conclusion that the product as manufactured and delivered to the consumer
was safe for consumer use.” Ex. 39 at 3 (emphasis added). Dr. Buc testified that the Flashlight,
“as manufactured,” contained an effective foam barrier between the matches and the striker pad.
Ex. 40 (Buc Dep. 80:12-80:16). As Dr. Buc elaborated:
[T]he foam insert in the product matchstick compartment is effective in
preventing the contact of one or more matchsticks with the striker pad when
inserted in the housing. The foam is not likely to exhibit set (permanent
deformation) overtime reducing its ability to isolate the matchsticks from the
abrasive strike pad. The utility of the foam barrier is an added safety feature to
the device under normal conditions of use.
Ex. 39 at 3.
Dr. Buc’s conclusion that the product was safe for consumer use comports with the
results of the extensive testing on the Flashlight before it was produced and delivered to
consumers. See supra at 9-11. None of these tests revealed any unintended ignitions or other
potential defects in the product’s design. Id.
The tests that PM (through UL) conducted following the initial consumer incident reports
are further proof that the Flashlight was not “unreasonably dangerous” and was safe for
consumer use. Following the March 4, 2014 incident reports, UL conducted two separate sets of
tests to attempt to trigger unintended ignitions. UL’s first set of tests—“vibration testing” with
the foam barrier removed—did not result in any ignitions. Ex. 14. UL’s second set of tests— a
“pepper grinder” style test with the foam barrier removed, which replicated the circumstances of
- 16 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 21 of 36 PageID# 2192

the two reported consumer incidents, see Ex. 13, similarly did not result in ignitions during
testing. Ex. 15. Thus, UL was unable to replicate an unintended ignition, even when utilizing
the same “pepper grinder” technique described by the two consumers. If the product in fact
contained a serious design defect and was subject to dangerous “explosions,” as PM claims, PM
should have uncovered such defect in its product testing.
Rather, the evidence demonstrates that the few instances of unintended ignition only
occurred when (a) a consumer removed the foam insert, and (b) a consumer tilted and twisted the
Flashlight product in a particular, unexpected manner. As PM’s product design expert, Richard
Stern, recognizes: “[J]ust because a product fails doesn’t mean it’s defective. Just because a
product is defective doesn’t mean it presents a risk of injury. Just because it presents a risk of
injury doesn’t mean it’s an unreasonable risk of injury.” Ex. 41 (Stern Dep. 215:14-215:19).
These isolated product failures do not establish that the Flashlight was “unreasonably dangerous”
as a matter of law.
C.

PM’s Evidence of Alleged Defect Is Not Admissible.

Further, nearly all the facts that PM cites in its Memorandum to demonstrate that the
product was defective are inadmissible under Rule 407 as subsequent remedial measures. For
the purpose of summary judgment, “material [that is] cited to support . . . a fact” must “be
presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Evidence
that would be inadmissible at trial cannot support a party’s motion for summary judgment.
PM repeatedly alleges that AAI “conceded” that the Flashlight product is defective based
on the actions that AAI undertook in the wake of the initial consumer complaints of unintended
ignition. See PM Mem. at 18–20. But PM’s attempt to use AAI’s subsequent conduct to prove a
defect in the product’s design or instructions violates Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
Rule 407 provides that “[w]hen measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or
harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:
negligence; culpable conduct; a defect in a product or its design; or a need for a warning or
instruction.” Fed. R. Evid. 407. “Rule 407 promotes an important policy of encouraging

- 17 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 22 of 36 PageID# 2193

subsequent remedial measures.” Werner v. Upjohn Co., Inc., 628 F.2d 848, 856 (4th Cir. 1980).
Particularly relevant here, Rule 407 protects “[t]he manufacturer who undertakes precautionary
measures” from facing “risk of liability for an injury caused by the earlier non-defective version
of the product based on evidence of his subsequent act which made the product safer but in no
way supports an inference that the initial version of the product was defective.” Id. at 857.
PM’s purported “admissions” of defect are textbook examples of an attempt to use
subsequent remedial measures for the improper purpose of proving AAI’s negligence or culpable
conduct or to prove defects in the product’s design or instructions. PM cites evidence of AAI’s
steps taken to mitigate risk after receiving complaints, PM Mem. at 6–7, 18–19; AAI’s proposals
for how AAI or PM might mitigate risk, id. at 7, 10, 18–19; and examples of information
gathering and testing undertaken by AAI to investigate the veracity of the consumer complaints,
id. at 6–7, 18. These actions by AAI are all inadmissible under Rule 407 for the purpose of
proving the existence of a design defect. This evidence therefore cannot support PM’s motion
for partial summary judgment. Moreover, even if these remedial measures, or alleged
“concessions,” were deemed admissible, they are at best probative and certainly are not
dispositive on the issue of design defect, particularly when Mr. Clements admitted that the
product was not defective. There is a disputed factual issue of whether the product is defective.
The Court should deny PM’s motion for summary judgment on this basis alone.
II.

Even If the Flashlight Were Defective, PM Is Not Entitled to Summary Judgment.
Even if PM could prove as a matter of law that the product contained a design defect, PM

cannot establish that it is entitled to summary judgment on its claims. First, AAI did not breach
any warranties or contractual provisions. At the very least, PM’s allegations of breach depend
on material issues of disputed fact. Second, there are disputed issues as to whether any alleged
breach was the proximate cause of any damages.
A.

AAI Did Not Breach the Warranty Clause.

PM’s claim that AAI breached the express terms of the Warranty Clause of the Purchase
Order fails as a matter of law because the product was made to PM’s own design specifications.

- 18 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 23 of 36 PageID# 2194

Under well-established Virginia law, a supplier cannot be liable for making a product to a
buyer’s own specifications. The Warranty Clause reflects this established rule, and PM’s
attempt to reinterpret the contractual language to avoid the established legal principle fails as a
matter of law. At a minimum, this issue depends on disputed factual issues that cannot be
decided at summary judgment.
1.

AAI Is Not Liable for Any Defects Because the Flashlight Was
Designed According to PM’s Specifications.

AAI cannot be held liable for design defects in a custom product made to PM’s own
specifications. When a product is built or manufactured to a customer’s own specifications, the
manufacturer is not liable for any defects in the customer’s specified design “unless those
specifications are obviously dangerous and should not be followed.” Hall v. Int’l Paper Co., No.
3:07-CV-064, 2007 WL 2965054, at *3 (E.D. Va. Oct. 9, 2007); see also Austin v. Clark Equip.
Co., 48 F.3d 833, 837 (4th Cir. 1995); Spangler v. Kranco, Inc., 481 F.2d 373, 375 (4th
Cir.1973).
AAI has offered ample evidence showing that it developed the Flashlight according to
design specifications dictated by PM. PM insisted that the Flashlight include matches, insisted
that a striker pad be placed in the interior compartment of the product (rejecting AAI’s
alternative placement recommendations), and developed and approved the product specifications
and testing requirements. See supra at 4, 9-10. The Flashlight was a “custom” product made to
PM’s explicit specifications. Ex. 17 (E. Zeanah Dep. 37:15-19; 38:4-10); Ex. 7 (Simers Dep.
17:5-19:14). PM recognizes that a “custom” product—as opposed to an “off-the-shelf” product
that is “currently available retail”—is “an item that [PM] either design[ed] completely” or
“modif[ied] based on a request.” Ex. 24 (Pinkney Dep. 46:11-14).
PM’s extensive control of the design process comports with AAI’s contractual
obligations to produce a product made to PM’s own specifications. The Supplier Guidelines
explicitly outlined this requirement:
Ex. 2. They provide that pre-production

- 19 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 24 of 36 PageID# 2195

samples were “required for every item” and were subject to approval by PM. Ex. 2. Thus,
because AAI complied with its contractual obligations and followed PM’s specifications, AAI
should be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. At a minimum, PM assertion that AAI did not
develop the product according to its specifications will be an issue for the jury to decide.
Accordingly, PM is not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.
PM incorrectly asserts that, even if AAI developed the Flashlight in accordance with
PM’s specifications, AAI is nevertheless liable for any defects in the product’s design. PM
Mem. at 21-22. Not only is this completely contrary to the established Virginia law, but the
Purchase Order between PM and AAI cannot reasonably be read to require AAI to expressly
warrant that customer-designed products will be free from design defects.
The first and second sentences of the Warranty Clause contain two separate and distinct
warranties. The first sentence addresses custom products designed according to PM’s
specifications:
Supplier warrants that all Goods delivered under Order will (a) conform strictly to
the general description, model number or specifications stated in this Order or
provided by Supplier and in any manufacturer warranties that accompany the
Goods, (b) be free from defects in materials, workmanship, and design, and (c) be
of first quality and made of new materials and components.
The second sentence of the warranty clause applies to products designed by AAI:
With respect to any Goods designed by Supplier or any of Supplier's
subcontractors or suppliers, Supplier assumes and acknowledges full and
complete responsibility for the suitability, adequacy, and safety of the design of
such Goods.
Ex. 23 (emphasis added). Thus, the contractual language drafted by PM reflects the distinction
under Virginia law between products designed by AAI and products designed according to PM’s
specifications. PM has not shown that AAI is liable as a matter of law under either sentence.
a.

AAI Did Not Breach the First Sentence of the Warranty Clause
Based on an Alleged Design Defect.

Contrary to PM’s argument, the first sentence of the Warranty Clause cannot reasonably
be interpreted to mean that AAI warranted that products developed according to PM’s design

- 20 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 25 of 36 PageID# 2196

specifications would be “‘free from defects . . . in design,’ without limitation.” PM Mem. at 17.
AAI was obligated to produce a product that met PM’s design specifications. Part (a) of the
sentence clearly warrants that all items will “conform strictly to . . . specifications . . . .” See
Ex. 23. Further, the Supplier Guidelines require that AAI adhere to PM’s specifications. See
Ex. 2. To adopt PM’s reading of the contract would create an untenable situation for AAI—
when presented with PM’s own design specifications, AAI would be forced to choose between
its contractual obligations to both (i) ensure that AAI produces a product true to PM’s design
specifications, and (ii) guarantee that those specifications would be free from defect. The law
does not require such an inequitable and impossible result.
PM strains to justify its interpretation of the Purchase Orders by erroneously arguing that
the Purchase Orders alone make up the contract between PM and AAI and that the Supplier
Guidelines do not apply. PM Mem. at 16. But the Purchase Orders explicitly incorporate by
reference the Supplier Guidelines: “14. Quality Control. Supplier must comply with Buyer’s
Quality Assurance Guidelines in effect as of the date of this Order.” Ex. 23. And the Supplier
Guidelines require AAI to follow PM’s specifications. See supra at 3, 13. Thus, both the
Purchase Orders and the Supplier Guidelines must be considered in determining the contractual
relationship between the parties and whether there was any breach. See Wellmore Coal Co. v.
Powell Constr. Co., 600 F. Supp. 1042, 1046 (W.D. Va. 1984) (“It is clear under Virginia law
that when more than one document makes up a contract, those documents should be interpreted
together, each one assisting and determining the meaning intended to be expressed by the
others.”).
Moreover, to the extent that the meaning of the first sentence of the Warranty Clause is
ambiguous, its meaning is an issue for the jury to decide. See Online Res. Corp. v. Lawlor, 285
Va. 40, 55 (2013) (“[T]o the extent that the contractual provisions are ambiguous, it is proper to
submit the question to the jury for consideration.”). “A contract may be ambiguous because of
indefiniteness of expression, internal inconsistency, or inclusion of words that have a double
meaning.” First S. Bank v. Bank of the Ozarks, 542 F. App’x 280, 283 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal
- 21 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 26 of 36 PageID# 2197

quotation marks omitted). And because it is undisputed that PM drafted the Purchase Orders,
any ambiguities or inconsistencies must be resolved in AAI’s favor. When the language of a
contract is ambiguous or unclear, “a court should construe ambiguous language against the
interest of the party that drafted it.” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52,
62 (1995); see also S. Ry. Co. v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., 145 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir. 1944)
(“When the words of a contract are ambiguous, . . . such ambiguities should be resolved against
the party that drew the contract and selected its terminology and nomenclature.”).
Finally, even if PM’s interpretation of the first sentence of the Warranty Clause were
correct, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether AAI breached the first sentence of
the Warranty Clause because the question of whether there was any “defect” in the product is an
issue of fact for the jury under Virginia law. See supra at 15. Thus, PM cannot establish that
AAI breached this provision as a matter of law.
b.

AAI Did Not Breach the First Sentence of the Warranty Clause
Based on Allegedly Inadequate Instructions.

The Warranty Clause does not cover any alleged failure to warn–nowhere does it mention
instructions or warnings of any kind. PM does not point to any contractual language regarding a
failure to provide adequate instructions or warnings. Instead, PM attempts to create an additional
“instructions and warnings” warranty based on the “defect . . . in design” portion of the Warranty
Clause. PM Mem. at 17, 19-20. PM asserts that, in the products liability context, failure to warn
is a type of design defect. Id. That is a clear misstatement of law. In Virginia, the adequacy of
warnings or instructions is an independent question, wholly separate from any alleged defect in
design. See, e.g., RMA Lumber, Inc. v. Pioneer Mach., LLC, No. 6:08-00023, 2009 WL
4015928, at *9 (W.D. Va. Nov. 19, 2009); Sprouse v. Am. Tire Distribs., Inc., No. 3:08-CV-491,
2009 WL 1404735, at *2 (E.D. Va. May 15, 2009); Featherall v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.,
219 Va. 949, 961-64 (1979); McClanahan v. Cal. Spray-Chem. Corp., 194 Va. 842, 842, 853-54
(1953); compare Va. Prac. Products Liability § 3.1 (“Chapter 3. Design Defect) with id. § 5.1
(“Chapter 5. Defective Warnings and Instructions). PM points to no case holding that, under

- 22 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 27 of 36 PageID# 2198

Virginia law, a failure to warn constitutes a defect in design. Rather, it relies solely on a portion
of a footnote from a treatise, see PM Mem. at 17 (citing Va. Prac. Products Liability § 3:5)—but
that footnote recognizes the two distinct concepts of design defect and the failure to warn. See
Va. Prac. Products Liability § 3:5 n.22 (“In the balancing process there is interplay between the
concepts of design defect and defects in warnings and instructions.”) Thus, PM’s argument that
a failure to carry adequate warnings or instructions constitutes a “defect . . . in design” is
contrary to both the explicit language of the contract and established products liability law.
Even if it the Warranty Clause did cover an alleged failure to warn, there would be
disputed issues of fact for the same reasons as the design defect allegation discussed above. PM
dictated the content of the instructions sheet and specifically told AAI to change certain
warnings. See supra at 4, 9. AAI cannot be held liable for failing to provide adequate
instructions when PM ultimately controlled their content. Moreover, the question of whether a
warning is adequate, like the question of design defect, is a question of fact for the jury to decide.
See Abbot by Abbot v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 844 F.2d 1108, 1115 (4th Cir. 1988) (“The adequacy
of a warning is a question of fact for the jury.”). Thus, there was no breach of warranty based on
allegedly inadequate instructions.
c.

AAI Did Not Breach the Second Sentence of the Warranty
Clause.

The second sentence of the Warranty Clause does not apply because the Flashlight was
not designed by AAI. Contrary to PM’s argument, AAI did not warrant the suitability,
adequacy, and safety of all products (regardless of the source for a product’s design). Rather, by
its express terms, the second sentence only applies “[w]ith respect to any Goods designed by
Supplier or any of Supplier’s subcontractors or suppliers.” Ex. 23. The Flashlight is not a
product that AAI designed, but rather a custom product designed according to PM’s own
specifications. Thus, the second sentence of the warranty clause does not apply as a matter of
law, and PM’s claim based on it should be dismissed.

- 23 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 28 of 36 PageID# 2199

Moreover, at a minimum, whether the second sentence applies is an issue of fact for the
jury to decide. As explained above, AAI has offered evidence showing that the Flashlight was
not “designed by Supplier or any of Supplier’s subcontractors or suppliers.” Rather, it was
designed by PM according to its product specifications. Because AAI’s liability is limited to
products that AAI designs, and there exists a genuine factual dispute over whether PM or AAI
designed the Flashlight, PM cannot demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
B.

AAI Did Not Breach the Indemnity Clause.

PM’s claim that AAI breached the Indemnity Clause fails because it is displaced by the
more-specific Warranty Clause. And even if the Indemnity Clause did apply, PM cannot
establish breach as a matter of law because it depends on a finding as to the extent to which each
party was at fault and caused the harm—issues of fact for the jury to decide.
First, PM’s claim fails as a matter of law because the specific provisions of the Warranty
Clause, and its exclusive remedies, control over the general Indemnity Clause. “When a
particular occurrence falls within a general clause of a contract, and also within the precise terms
of a specific provision of the same contract, a presumption arises that the specific . . . provision,
rather than the general, is controlling.” S. Ry. Co., 145 F.2d at 307; see also PCS Nitrogen Inc. v.
Ashley II of Charleston LLC, 714 F.3d 161, 174 (4th Cir. 2013); Karnette v. Wolpoff &
Abramson, L.L.P., 444 F. Supp. 2d 640, 646 (E.D. Va. 2006). The Indemnity Clause contains a
general provision allowing for the recovery of certain damages “to the extent they arise from, or
may be attributable to, any error, omission or fault of” AAI. But the only “error, omission, or
fault” alleged by PM is “AAI’s breaches of warranties.” PM Mem. at 23.3
As discussed above, the Warranty Clause specifically addresses the conditions under
which AAI can be liable for allegedly defective products. Moreover, it provides two exclusive,
3

PM argues that AAI erred “aside from the warranties,” but they are just re-packaged versions of
the warranty claims. For example, PM alleged that the product was “defective in its actual
design and failed to carry adequate instructions”—exactly the same allegations that it makes for
the warranty clam. PM Mem. at 23; see also id. at 23-24 (alleging that AAI failed to test and
failed to notify PM of the alleged defect).

- 24 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 29 of 36 PageID# 2200

alternative remedies for a breach of the Warranty Clause: either (i) a refund of the price it paid
for the original product, or (ii) reimbursement for the cost of replacement. Ex. 23. Because
PM’s indemnification claims is based on an alleged breach of the warranties due to a product
defect, the Warranty Clause and its specific, agreed-upon remedy for breach apply. PM cannot
invoke the broader indemnification provision to seek additional recovery for claims
contemplated in the Warranty Clause’s remedial scheme because that would render the exclusive
remedies in the Warranty Clause superfluous. E. Gas & Fuel Assocs. v. Midwest-Raleigh, Inc.,
374 F.2d 451, 454 (4th Cir. 1967) (“It is a general tenet of contract law that a construction which
gives meaning to all words and provisions of a contract is favored.”). Thus, PM’s breach of
contract claim based on the Indemnity Clause fails as a matter of law.
Second, even if the Indemnity Clause applied, PM has not shown that AAI breached it as
a matter of law. Under the Indemnity Clause, AAI is obligated to indemnify only for losses “to
the extent they arise from, or may be attributable to” AAI’s errors, omissions or fault. Ex. 23.
Moreover, indemnity is generally precluded if a buyer commits “independent acts of negligence”
that contribute to its alleged losses. See Wingo v. Celotex Corp., 834 F.2d 375, 379 (4th Cir.
1987); see also Va. Prac. Products Liability § 6:8 (“Indemnity of all kinds is also precluded . . .
where the party seeking indemnity has been guilty of an independent act of negligence which
also is a cause of the user’s injury.”).
There are significant disputed issues of material fact about the extent to whether AAI
committed any “errors, omissions, or fault” and whether they caused the losses at issue. For
example, AAI has offered evidence that PM designed the product according to its own
specifications, that it failed to conduct safety testing on the Flashlight, as it was contractually
required to do, and that it declined to act upon AAI’s suggestions in the wake of the first two
consumer complaints to send out a mass email to PM’s customers regarding the proper use of the
foam insert. See supra at 4-6, 8-11. Because these disputed issues will need to be resolved by
the jury, PM has not established that AAI breached the Indemnity Clause and that such breach
caused PM’s claimed losses as a matter of law.

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 30 of 36 PageID# 2201

C.

AAI Did Not Breach the Implied Warranty of Merchantability.

PM cannot establish that it is entitled to summary judgment on its implied warranty of
merchantability claim, because (i) PM is not contractually entitled to this implied warranty, and
(ii) PM cannot demonstrate that, as a matter of law, the product is not fit for its ordinary purpose.
First, PM is not entitled to an implied warranty of merchantability because the express
warranty conflicts with and displaces any potential implied warranty. An express warranty
included in a contract may displace an inconsistent implied warranty of merchantability. See VA
Code Ann. § 8.2-317(c). Under the Virginia Code, “in case of such an inconsistency the implied
warranty of merchantability is displaced by the express warranty that the goods will comply with
the specifications.” Id. § 8.2-316, UCC cmt. 9. Thus, where a buyer “gives detailed
specifications as to the goods” to be produced, the implied warranty of merchantability will
normally not apply. Id. As explained above, AAI made an express warranty to manufacture the
Flashlight in accordance with PM’s detailed specifications. Finding that AAI breached an
implied warranty, even though it manufactured the Flashlight in accordance with those
specifications, would conflict with this express warranty. Thus, PM’s express warranty that it
would comply with PM’s specifications displaces any claim by PM that AAI’s breached an
implied warranty, and PM’s implied warranty of merchantability claim fails as a matter of law.
Second, PM is not entitled to an implied warranty of merchantability because it is a
sophisticated purchaser of products involving matches. “[W]hen a skilled purchaser knows or
reasonably should be expected to know of the dangerous propensities or characteristics of a
product, no implied warranty of merchantability arises.” Young v. J. I. Case Co., 1994 WL
506403, at *6. A buyer’s sophisticated knowledge of the “dangerous propensities or
characteristics” of a product presents, at minimum, a genuine issue of material fact. Id. PM is
not a novice or first-time purchaser of products involving matches—in fact, when AAI expressed
concerns because AAI had never before worked on a product that included matches, PM
responded that everything was “fine” because PM had matches experience. See Ex. 25. Thus,
PM is not entitled to an implied warranty of merchantability.

- 26 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 31 of 36 PageID# 2202

Finally, even if PM could establish that it is entitled to an implied warranty of
merchantability, it cannot demonstrate a warranty violation as a matter of law. The implied
warranty of merchantability requires a product to be reasonably capable of performing its
ordinary function, or “fit for the ordinary purposes for which those goods are used.” Davis v.
Simon-Telelect, Inc., 48 F.3d 1215 (4th Cir. 1995). To succeed on its implied warranty claim,
PM “must show, (1) that the goods were unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which they
would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonably foreseeable purpose, and (2) that the
unreasonably dangerous condition existed when the goods left [AAI]’s hands.” Logan v.
Montgomery Ward & Co., 216 Va. 425, 428 (1975). As explained above, there is a genuine
factual dispute over whether the Flashlight product was “unreasonably dangerous” when it left
AAI’s hands. See supra at 16-17. Thus, PM is not entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
D.

PM Fails To Prove Proximate Causation as a Matter Of Law.

Even if PM could demonstrate that AAI breached a contractual provision, PM cannot
establish as a matter of law that such breach proximately caused PM’s claimed losses. To
establish liability for a breach of contract or a breach of warranty, PM must prove that the breach
itself proximately caused the losses alleged. Vienna Metro LLC v. Pulte Home Corp, 786 F.
Supp. 2d 1076, 1086 (E.D. Va. 2011); Va. Code Ann. § 8.2-314, UCC cmt. 13. “Generally, the
issue of proximate causation is a question of fact to be resolved by a jury.” RGR, LLC v. Settle,
288 Va. 260, 292-93 (2014).
There are disputed factual issues regarding causation. First, PM dictated not only the
product specifications, but all of the testing requirements, including safety testing. It did not
discover any alleged defect or safety issues. Thus, even if AAI breached its contractual
obligations (it did not), there is, at a minimum, a factual issue as to whether PM’s failures to
perform its own contractual obligations caused any defect. Second, there is significant evidence
that had PM acted promptly when it received the first two consumer complaints and adopted the
action plan that AAI suggested on March 7, 2014, the losses at issue would not exist—there
would have been no need for a product recall, and therefore no recall costs. Upon receiving the

- 27 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 32 of 36 PageID# 2203

first two consumer complaints, AAI promptly investigated the circumstances surrounding the
alleged unintentional ignitions and concluded that both resulted when the consumers failed to
replace the foam safety barrier. See Ex. 13. Within days, AAI proposed an action plan—AAI
would draft a mass email to all PM customers who had received the product reminding
consumers to always replace the foam safety barrier. Id. AAI was also prepared to send
replacement foam barriers to any customers needing a replacement. By March 14, 2014, PM’s
Brand, Compliance, and Legal departments had all signed off on the mass email plan. See
Ex. 19. AAI could not send out the mass email on its own; PM had all of the customers’ contact
information and insisted on sending the email from one of its own addresses. Ex. 34. PM never
sent the email to consumers. Thus, there is a question of fact as to whether any alleged recall
would have been necessary had PM implemented this proposal.
Thus, PM itself willingly took on the losses it now seeks to recover—expenses that were
not “caused” by any alleged product defect, but by PM’s own failures in testing the Flashlight
and implementing AAI’s proposed remedial plan. Because there is a dispute over whether AAI’s
alleged breaches caused PM’s alleged losses, or whether PM’s own actions were the cause of its
alleged losses, PM is not entitled to summary judgment on any of its claims.
III.

PM Is Not Entitled to The Damages It Seeks.
Even if PM could prevail on liability at the summary judgment stage, PM is not entitled

as a matter of law to the damages it seeks. PM is seeking $1,403,431.48 for the purchase price
of the Flashlight product, plus $5,120,439.21 “in [previously undisclosed] costs associated with
the recall” of the product, plus attorneys’ fees. PM Mem. at 27. It appears that those previously
undisclosed costs include, in part, the cost of the “replacement” gifts sent by PM to its
customers. See PM Mem. at 10.
First, PM’s damages claim violates the express terms of the Warranty Clause outlining
the proper remedy for breach. When there has been a breach of an express warranty, PM is
entitled to choose either 1) a refund of the price it paid for the original product, or
2) reimbursement for the cost of replacement—but not both. Ex. 23. PM has not previously

- 28 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 33 of 36 PageID# 2204

elected which remedy it would prefer, but now seeks a double recovery. Permitting PM to
recover both remedies would be contrary to the explicit text of the contract.
Second, PM is not entitled to those damages because there is a factual issue as to whether
it breached its duty to mitigate damages. A party injured under a contract has an obligation to
mitigate its damages. Forbes v. Rapp, 269 Va. 374, 380 (2005). The evidence shows that PM
did not act to mitigate its losses by choosing an action plan that would be the most effective and
the least expensive. As explained above, it failed to implement AAI’s proposed remedial plan of
sending a mass email. There is also significant evidence that PM chose a fast track recall
because it was concerned about the CPSC taking enforcement action because PM had not
reported the prior customer incidents. Ex. 22 (Edson Dep. 75:18-76:24). AAI offered to work
with PM to remove the striker pads from the remaining product inventory, which would have left
PM with a perfectly usable 3-in-1 flashlight, compass, and matches container. Ex. 17 (E. Zeanah
Dep. 215:22-216:21). PM also purchased premium replacement items that were more than twice
as expensive as the Flashlight product. Ex. 21 (Crosthwaite Dep. 173:14-19; 174:17-21).
Third, PM’s argument that AAI is “estopped” from challenging the scope of the recall
because AAI allegedly remained “silent” is contrary to law and fact. PM Mem. at 24. AAI did
not remain silent on the appropriate response to the unintended ignitions—rather, AAI repeatedly
objected to PM’s recall plan. In the wake of the first two consumer complaints, AAI
immediately proposed a mass email to alleviate the risk of future unintended ignitions. Ex. 33.
In the four weeks between the initial consumer complaints and the Lowes complaint, AAI
continued to advocate for a mass email to consumers. Ex. 36. AAI also proposed to PM other
possible plans to alleviate the risk of unintended ignition, including instructing consumers how to
remove the stick-on striker pad, Ex. 37. After PM notified AAI that it had independently
decided to undertake a full-scale recall, AAI again voiced its concerned and proposed
alternatives. Ex. 42; Ex. 43. AAI specifically informed PM that AAI did not think the full recall
was necessary, that there were other, more effective options available, and that AAI reserved any
rights to challenge PM’s independent recall decision. Ex. 35.
- 29 -

Case 3:15-cv-00577-JAG Document 77 Filed 06/16/16 Page 34 of 36 PageID# 2205

Further, the two cases that PM cites to support its “estoppel” argument are completely
inapplicable because they involve allegations of deception. Nat’l Airlines, Inc. v. Shea, 223 Va.
578, 583 (1982) (“a person is required to speak only when common honesty or fair dealing
demand that he do so, and in order that a party may be estopped by silence, there must be on his
part an intent to mislead, or at least a willingness that others should be deceived.”); In re Stokes,
198 B.R. 168, 178 (E.D. Va. 1996) (applying estoppel where a party stayed silent and allowed a
settlement closing date to lapse, allowed the opposing party to perform under the settlement
agreement for several months, and then tried to claim it did not have to perform because the
settlement agreement had lapsed). PM does not allege any intent to mislead on the part of AAI.
To the contrary, AAI was vocal and transparent in its objections to the recall process.
Fourth, PM fails to present sufficient evidence of the damages it seeks. “A plaintiff []
must prove two primary factors relating to damages. First, a plaintiff must show a causal
connection between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the damages asserted. Second, a
plaintiff must prove the amount of those damages by using a proper method and factual
foundation for calculating damages.” Saks Fifth Ave., Inc. v. James, Ltd., 272 Va. 177, 189
(2006) (internal citations omitted). In its Memorandum, PM fails to provide a breakdown of its
alleged recall expenses. Thus, PM is not entitled to recover the damages it seeks.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and those stated in AAI’s motion for summary judgment, and
supporting memorandum, AAI respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiff PM’s Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment and enter judgment in favor of AAI.
