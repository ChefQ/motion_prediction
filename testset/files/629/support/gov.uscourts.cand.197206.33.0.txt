MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES'
I. INTRODUCTION AND ISSUES TO BE DECIDED

Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant AT&T Mobility II, LLC, ("AT&T Mobility")
respectfully requests this Court to compel arbitration of the Counterclaims asserted by
Defendant and Cross-Complainant Carolyn Pestano (`""Pestano").

The Counterclaims asserted by Pestano are claims purportedly assigned to her by Vival
Wireless, Inc. ("Viva"). See Counterclaims FN 1 at p. 7, Ins. 21-22. The Counterclaims arise
from the "AT&T Wireless Exclusive Dealer Agreement" ("Original Dealer Agreement"),
"Cingular Wireless Exclusive Dealer Agreement" ("Dealer Agreement"), "Settlement and
Release Concerning Dealer's Pre-2/1/06 Total Subscriber Base" ("SMF Release"), and
"Advanced Payment Agreement" entered into by Viva and AT&T Mobility's predecessor
Cingular Wireless II, LLC. See Counterclaims at {0x00A7 7-12 and 18-19. In entering into the
Original Dealer Agreement, Dealer Agreement, SMF Release and Advanced Payment
Agreement (collectively, "Agreements"), Viva expressly agreed to arbitrate claims arising
under the Agreements, or any of them. See Declaration of Marc Miguel, fj 3-6, Exh. A at
10.2.1; Exh. B at 11.3.1, Exh. C at Section 4f and Exh. D at Section 13. As Viva's alleged
assignee, Pestano, by bringing the counterclaims in this Court, has violated the Agreements,
which must be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1-16. The
FAA mandates that Pestano be compelled to arbitrate each of her Counterclaims.

IL. RELEVANT FACTS
A. Viva Agreed to Arbitrate Each of the Counterclaims Asserted by Pestano.

Effective September 1, 2001, Viva and AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. ("AWS")

entered into the Original Dealer Agreement. Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 3, Exh. A. Under the terms of

the Original Dealer Agreement, Viva and AWS agreed that "all claims (including

 

The following portions of this Memorandum of Points and Authorities are the subject

of a concurrently filed motion to seal: page 3 at lines 5-11, 14-16, and 19-20; and page 6 at

counterclaims and cross-claims) and disputes between Dealer [Viva] and Company [AWS]
must be resolved by submission to binding arbitration." Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 3, Exh. A at 10.2.1.

Effective January 1, 2006, Viva and AT&T Mobility's predecessor, Cingular Wireless
Il, LLC ("Cingular Wireless II"), entered into the Dealer Agreement. See Miguel Decl. { 4,
Exh. B; Counterclaims 0x00A7 11. The Dealer Agreement, at section 11.3.1, requires that: "all
claims (including counterclaims and cross-claims and also including claims based on tort or
other legal theories) and disputes between Dealer [Viva] and Company [AT&T Mobility IT]
must be resolved by submission to binding arbitration .. ." Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 4, Exh. B at
11.3.1. The Dealer Agreement further specifies that any award of an arbitrator "may be
confirmed or enforced in any court having jurisdiction under the enforcement provisions of
the Federal Arbitration Act" ("FAA"). Id.

Effective February 1, 2006, Viva and AT&T Mobility's predecessor, Cingular
Wireless II, entered into the SMF Release. See Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 5, Exh. C; Counterclaims
12. Section 4f of the SMF Release requires that "[a]ny disputes related to this 2/1/06 SMF
Release between the parties must be resolved under the dispute provisions of the Dealer
Agreement." Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 5, Exh. C at Section 4f.

In October 2006, Viva and AT&T Mobility's predecessor, Cingular Wireless II,
entered into the Advanced Payment Agreement ("APA"). See Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 6, Exh. D. The
APA provides at section 13, "[t]his APA shall be construed and interpreted in conjunction
with the Dealer Agreement and the 2/1/06 SMF Release." Jd. Through this incorporation,
the APA became subject to the arbitration provision set forth at section 11.3.1 of the Dealer
Agreement. See Miguel Decl. J 6 and 4, Exhs. D at { 13 and B at 11.3.1.

B. Each Counterclaim Asserted by Pestano On Behalf of Viva is Arbitrable and

Pestano and Viva Violated the Agreements by Bringing the Counterclaims in

This Court.

The Counterclaims filed by Pestano allege six claims: (1) "Breach of Contract (SMF
Release)"; (2) "Breach of Contract (Original Dealer Agreement)"; (3) "Breach of Contract

(Dealer Agreement)"; (4) "Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing" (Original Dealer

Agreement and Dealer Agreement); (5) "Negligent Misrepresentation" (APA); and (6)
"Unfair Competition (0x00A7 17200)" (Original Dealer Agreement and Dealer Agreement). See
Counterclaims 0x00A70x00A7 29-67. Each one of these claims arises from the Original Dealer
Agreement, Dealer Agreement, SMF Release, and/or APA. Accordingly, each one of these
claims is arbitrable. See Miguel Decl. J0x00A7 3-6, Exh. A at 10.2.1; Exh. B at 11.3.1, Exh. C at
Section 4f and Exh. D at Section 13.

By bringing the arbitrable Counterclaims before this Court, Pestano violated the
Original Dealer Agreement, Dealer Agreement, SMF Release, and the APA. Jd.

AT&T Mobility's counsel met and conferred with Pestano's counsel and demanded
that Pestano arbitrate her counterclaims (and even offered to allow Pestano to arbitrate the
claims arising from the Guaranty) but Pestano refused. See Declaration of Sarah K. Kohut
("S. Kohut Decl."), 3.

Cc. Claims Arising from the Guaranty Are Not Arbitrable.

To induce Cingular Wireless II into entering the APA, on October 3, 2006, Pestano
executed the Guaranty. See Miguel Decl. 0x00A7 6, Exh. D at Exh. B. The Guaranty does not
contain an arbitration provision. Jd. Further, the Guaranty is a stand alone agreement - it
does not incorporate the Original Dealer Agreement, Dealer Agreement, SMF Release,
and/or APA (collectively, "Agreements"). Id.

Il ARGUMENT
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT REQUIRES ENFORCEMENT OF VIVA'S
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.

The FAA requires this Court to enforce the arbitration provisions contained in the
Original Dealer Agreement and Dealer Agreement. 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2.

The FAA applies because (1) the Dealer Agreement specifies that the arbitration
provision is governed by the FAA (see Miguel Decl. 4 4, Exh. B at 11.3.5); and (2) the
Agreements each involve commerce, in that the purpose of the Agreements is the sale of
wireless service and telephones (id.). Further, AT&T Mobility and its predecessor Cingular

Wireless II, are multi-state companies. See AT&T Mobility's Certification of Interested

Entities or Persons; 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2; Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. Inc. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265,
269 and 282, 115 S. Ct. 834, 837 and 843, 130 L. Ed. 2d 753, 761 and 769 (1985).

The FAA mandates that written agreements to arbitrate disputes "shall be valid,
irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the
revocation of any contract." 9 U.S.C. 0x00A7 2. "By its terms, the Act leaves no place for the
exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct
the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been
signed." Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 218, 105 S. Ct. 1238, 1241, 84 L.
Ed. 2d 158, 163 (1985). "Accordingly, the first task of a court asked to compel arbitration of
a dispute is to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute." Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626 105 S. Ct. 3346, 3353, 87
L. Ed. 2d 444, 454 (1985).

It is indisputable that Viva agreed to arbitrate the Counterclaims. Each executed
agreement from which a Counterclaim arises contains a valid arbitration provision
specifically or by incorporation. See Miguel Decl. 0x00A7{j 3-6, Exh. A at 10.2.1; Exh. B at 11.3.1,
Exh. C at Section 4f and Exh. D at Section 13. Further, each of the Counterclaims falls
within such arbitration provision. Id.

A. Valid Arbitration Agreements Exist.

As set forth above in section II. A., the signed Original Dealer Agreement, Dealer
Agreement, SMF Release and APA contain, specifically or by incorporation, valid written
agreements to arbitrate. See Miguel Decl. {0x00A7 3-6, Exh. A at 10.2.1; Exh. B at 11.3.1, Exh. C
at Section 4f and Exh. D at Section 13.

B. The Counterclaims Fall Within the Scope of the Agreements.
| Each of the Counterclaims asserted falls within the applicable arbitration agreements.
See Miguel Decl. 0x00A70x00A7 3-6, Exh. A at 10.2.1; Exh. B at 11.3.1, Exh. C at Section 4f and Exh. D
at Section 13.
Congress enacted the FAA to "reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration

agreements * * *[,] to place [these] agreements upon the same footing as other contracts[,] *

* * (and to] manifest a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements." EEOC v.
Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 289 (2002) (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,
"questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy
favoring arbitration." Moses H. Cone Mem'I Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24
(1983).

Here, the applicable arbitration agreements provide "all claims (including
counterclaims and cross-claims) and disputes between Dealer [Viva] and Company [AWS]

must be resolved by submission to binding arbitration" (see Miguel Decl. $3, Exh. A at

a4 ee eee

10.2.1 [Emphasis added]) and "all claims (including counterclaims and cross-claims and
also including claims based on tort or other legal theories) and disputes between Dealer
[Viva] and Company [AT&T Mobility] must be resolved by submission to binding
arbitration..." (see Miguel Decl. 44, Exh. B at 11.3.1 [Emphasis added]}). Every one of the
Counterclaims represents a "claim" or "dispute" between Viva and AT&T Mobility (as
successor to Cingular Wireless Il, LLC). See Counterclaims at J] 29-67. Accordingly, every

Counterclaim is subject to arbitration under the terms of the arbitration agreements.

y eaten Wrote,

iv. CONCLUSION
Viva entered into valid written agreements to arbitrate the claims asserted by

Pestano (as alleged assignee of Viva) in the Counterclaims. The FAA "leaves no place for
the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall
direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement
has been signed." Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 470 U.S. at 218, 105 S. Ct. at 1241, 84 L.
Ed. 2d at 163. AT&T Mobility respectfully requests that this Court grant its motion and
compel arbitration of each and every one of the Counterclaims asserted by Pestano in this
action.
