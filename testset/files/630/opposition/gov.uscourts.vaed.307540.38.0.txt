PLAINTIFFS MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS
TOYOTA MOTOR MANUFACTURING KENTUCKY, INC. AND TOYOTA
MOTOR SALES.U.S.A., INC.'S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO

DISCOVERY AND VEHICLE INSPECTION

Plaintiff, SATYAJIT SANYAL, by Pro Se, hereby submits this Memorandum
in opposition to and demands dismissal of the Defendants Motion for an
Order compelling Plaintiff to respond to Defendants' discovery requests
and to permit inspection of Plaintiffs vehicle for the following reasons
stated hereinafter:

1. The Plaintiff and Defendants have demanded Jury Trial for this case,
which was moved by the defendants to this Court, based on diversity
claims and has been assigned Case # 1:14-cv-00960-JCC-TCB.

2. The Plaintiff emphasizes that he has already submitted to this Court, the
documents and records containing critical facts and circumstantial
evidences pertaining to his claims in this subject case and understands
that he may have to provide additional documents or information during
the discovery process and during the trial, to which he has the freedom
to agree through amicable consent and not by compulsion against his
consent. On the contrary, the Defendants have not yet submitted
documentary evidences and instead the Defendants have been making
consistent attempts to delay Justice and create confusion as well as
stalemate situations by approaching the Plaintiff with requests for data
Case 1:14-cv-00960-JCC-TCB Document 38 Filed 03/04/15 Page 2 of 6 PagelD# 344

and information which the Plaintiff disagrees to consent based on

protections available to the Plaintiff per his fundamental and legal rights
to privacy.

3. The Plaintiffs understanding is that the authority of making Judgments
in the subject case has not been entrusted by the U.S. Courts to the
Defendants or their attorneys. However, based on the letters and other
documents sent or submitted by the Defendants and/or their attorneys,
contain language and information which create a notion of them being in
a position of authority to make Judgments in this subject case.

4. The Plaintiff has approached the U.S. Courts for Justice, under the belief
that Courts are Government entities, partly funded by "We the People"
for preserving Democracy and maintaining a Disciplined Civilized
society. The documents received by Plaintiff, pertaining to Case # 1:14-
cv-00906-JCC-JFA, enclosed as Exhibit 1, generates notions of
professionals ease to manipulate or sway the Rule(s) of Law to coerce
actions and/or decisions based on the Plaintiffs adherence to
Defendants requests, which raises queries that Plaintiff is deeply
concerned about in this subject Case # 1:14-cv-00960-JCC-TCB.

5. The Plaintiff emphasizes that he has entirely lost TRUST on the named
defendants and their assurances after reviewing the publicly accessible
information, enclosed as Exhibit 2, 3 and 4, which contain documents
related to Public and Federal proceedings, including lawsuits in the
United States, involving partly or wholly, one or more of the named
defendants and/or their group companies located in North America

and/or Worldwide, which together operate under the brand named
TOYOTA.

e The information and evidences contained in Exhibit 2, clearly
indicate that one or more of the group companies together
operating under the brand named TOYOTA, agreed to pay to the
United States $1.2 billion as financial penalty resulting from the
offenses described in the Information and Statement of Facts
contained in a deferred prosecution agreement co-signed on
March 19", 2014 by General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer for
Toyota Motor North America, Inc. and Group Vice President for
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc.

2
Case 1:14-cv-00960-JCC-TCB Document 38 Filed 03/04/15 Page 3 of 6 PagelD# 345

e For Case No. 8:10ML 02151 JVS (FMOx) enclosed in Exhibit 3,
$1.6 billion Settlement Valuation was proposed in the Court Order
dated June 17", 2013 related to a Class Action Settlement which
involved as Defendants, one or more of the group companies
together operating under the brand named TOYOTA. The
Principal Attorney representing the Defendants in this subject case
is known to also have represented the Defendants named in the
aforementioned Class action settlement.

e Case No. CV11-04479 (RZx), enclosed in Exhibit 4, reveal
evidence and significant information related to the deceptive
practices and unlawful activities endeavored by one or more of the
named Defendants in this subject case and/or their group
companies together operating under the brand named TOYOTA.

6. The Plaintiff emphasizes that his rights to privacy and freedom to
consent to release of information or records related to/or containing his
Health Information, Personal Information, Birthdate, Social Security
Number, Employment or Employer Information along with other such
protected information and "data from the Event Data Recorder (EDR),
VCH and/or any other computer memory contained within the subject
vehicle 2011 Toyota Camry with VIN 4T1BF3EK9BU658720" are
fundamental and are legal privacy protection rights available to the
Plaintiff by Law, which the Plaintiff is exercising while disagreeing to
consent to providing or releasing such records or information.

7. The Plaintiffs disagreement to consenting to providing or releasing
records pertaining to Health, Employment, Employer, Birthdate, Social
Security Number, Personal Information and "download/image data from
the Event Data Recorder (EDR), VCH and/or any other computer
memory contained within the subject vehicle 2011 Toyota Camry with
VIN 4T1BF3EK9BU658720", were explicitly discussed during telephone
conversations between the Plaintiff and Defendants attorney and also
communicated by letters.

8. The Plaintiff has already informed the Defendants by letter to their
attorneys, dated February 20", 2015 that he will try to provide an
"Affidavit of Health" in lieu of Health records, indicating information on

3
Case 1:14-cv-00960-JCC-TCB Document 38 Filed 03/04/15 Page 4 of 6 PagelD# 346

his health and "Affidavit of Earned Income from Employment" in lieu of
W2, containing amount of Federal Earned Income per Calendar year.

9. The Plaintiff emphasizes that, due to the concerns and reasons stated
as follows, he disagrees to consent to the Defendants requests for
inspection of the subject vehicle 2011 Toyota Camry with VIN
4T1BF3EK9BU658720:

e The type of vehicle inspection requested by the Defendants is not
standardized or regulated by the U.S. Federal and/or State laws or
systems.

e Plaintiff has right to privacy of data from the Event Data Recorder
(EDR), VCH and/or any other computer memory contained within
the subject vehicle 2011 Toyota Camry with VIN
4T1BF3EK9BU658720.

e Plaintiff does not have clarity about continued coverage by his
existing insurance providers for his automobile and healthcare
insurances, in case of any accidents and/or potential damages to
the subject vehicle or involved properties and/or injuries to the
Plaintiff or other people during or after the vehicle inspection that
is not standardized or regulated by the U.S. Federal and/or State
laws or systems.

e Defendants are requesting that Vehicle inspection be performed in
TOYOTA branded facilities. This makes the vehicle and inspection
reports susceptible to being intentionally altered, manipulated,
data wiped-out, damaged and/or made incomplete or entirely
irrelevant.

e Inspection tools, testing software/hardware, devices, facilities and
guidelines to be used during the requested vehicle inspection, and
associated data analytical capabilities are known to be tailor-made
to the specific automobile manufacturers design only, with limited
availability in facilities mostly operated by TOYOTA dealers.

e Due to negligible or limited public expertise in understanding the
custom codes and information downloaded from the EDR/VCH

4
Case 1:14-cv-00960-JCC-TCB Document 38 Filed 03/04/15 Page 5 of 6 PagelD# 347

and/or any other computer memory contained within the subject
vehicle, makes the vehicle inspection reports and existing data
susceptible to being altered, manipulated, incomplete, irrelevant
and/or adjusted to the Defendants needs to safeguard their
interests in lawsuits.

e Due to lack of specifics on tasks related to the requested vehicle
inspection, unregulated type of inspection, limited public access
and design information on the tailor-made specialized tools which
may be used by TOYOTA facilities during the requested
inspection, makes the vehicle inspection reports and existing data
susceptible to being altered, manipulated, wiped-out, damaged,
and/or information pertaining to claimed facts being reported as
unrecorded or non-existent.

e Unavailability of requested vehicle inspection in publicly accessible
and drive-in, regulated inspection facilities owned or operated by
the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and/or U.S. Federal or State Government.

Wherefore, based on the aforementioned information, concerns and
reasons stated above, the Plaintiff respectfully demands this Court to
dismiss the Defendants Motion for an Order compelling Plaintiff to
respond to Defendants' discovery requests and to permit inspection
of Plaintiffs vehicle.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this 4** day of March 2015.
