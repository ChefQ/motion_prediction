GOVERNMENT=S OBJECTION TO DEFENSE
MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OBTAINED FROM SEARCH OF YAHOO.COM
EMAIL ACCOUNT AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM
NOW COMES the United States of America, by and through its attorneys Thomas E.
Delahanty II, United States Attorney for the District of Maine, and Michael J. Conley, Assistant
United States Attorney, and respectfully objects to defendants’ Motion to Suppress (Docket Item
# 34).

The defendants have been charged with one count of operation of an unlicensed money

service business, and aiding and abetting such conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1960 and 2.
The defendants have moved to suppress the contents of a Yahoo! email account alleging that (1)
the search warrant upon which the search was based was overbroad and lacked particularity; and
(2) the procedure employed to conduct the search (agents conducting the search of the email
account as opposed to Yahoo! employees) was improper.1 For the reasons stated below, the
Government respectfully requests that the defendants’ motion be denied without a hearing.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On May 6, 2015, Department of Homeland Security Special Agent David Fife sought and
Defendants also argued that the affidavit submitted in support of the requested search warrant
lacked probable cause. On June 16, 2016, defense counsel provided written notice to the
government that they do not intend to seek suppression of the warrant on the basis that probable
cause was lacking. Accordingly, the government has not addressed the issue of probable cause
in this filing.

obtained a federal search warrant (Mag. No. 2:15-mj-91-JHR) to review the Yahoo! email
account salmansy@yahoo.com.

Prior to submitting his application and affidavit with the court,

SA Fife reviewed the contents of the application with an Assistant U.S. Attorney.

In his

affidavit filed in support of the requested warrant, SA Fife expressed his belief that probable
cause existed to support the requested search. This belief was predicated upon, among other
things, the following: (1) his undercover purchases of Bitcoin from the defendant; (2) his
electronic communications with the defendant; and (3) the defendant’s electronic
communications with ‘Coinbase’ regarding the defendant’s requirement to register with the
Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money service
business.
On May 6, 2015, U.S. Magistrate Judge John H. Rich III expressed his concurrence that
probable cause existed by issuing a search warrant authorizing the search of the Yahoo! email
account salmansy@yahoo.com.
Attachment B.

There were two attachments to the warrant: Attachment A and

These attachments consisted of the following:

ATTACHMENT A

and destination addresses associated with each e-mail, the date and time at which
each e-mail was sent, and the size and length of each e-mail;
b.
All records or other information regarding the identification of the
account, to include full name, physical address, telephone numbers and other
identifiers, records of session times and durations, the date on which the account
was created, the length of service, the IP address used to register the account, login IP addresses associated with session times and dates, account status, alternative
e-mail addresses provided during registration, methods of connecting, log files,
and means and source of payment (including any credit or bank account number);
c.
The types of service utilized;
d.
All records or other information stored at any time by an individual using
the account, including address books, contact and buddy lists, calendar data,
pictures, and files;
e.
All records pertaining to communications between the Provider and any
person regarding the account, including contacts with support services and
records of actions taken.
II.
Information to be seized
All information described above in Section I that constitutes fruits,
evidence or instrumentalities of violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960 involving
salmansy@yahoo.com, including the following:
a.
Information pertaining to the operation, ownership, and control of an
unlicensed money service business, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1960.
b.
Information relating to the identities and locations of any persons who
created or used the account; or who communicated with the account, if the
communications pertained to the operation of an unlicensed money service
business, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1960.
Mag. No. 2:15-mj-91-JHR.
DISCUSSION
A.

Fourth Amendment

The Fourth Amendment provides that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized." U.S. CONST. amend. IV; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 41.
According to the Supreme Court, a search warrant complies with the Fourth Amendment when it
includes three elements: it must be issued by a neutral magistrate; it must be based on a showing
of “probable cause to believe that ‘the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or
3

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 4 of 19

PageID #: 109

conviction’ for a particular offense”; and it must satisfy the particularity requirement. Dalia v.
United States, 441 U.S. 238, 255 (1979). The scope of the particularity clause is limited to “two
matters . . . the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.” United States v.
Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90, 97 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, “[n]othing in
the language of the Constitution or in this Court’s decisions interpreting that language suggests
that . . . search warrants also must include a specification of the precise manner in which they are
to be executed.” Id. at 98 (quoting Dalia, 441 U.S. at 255).
"The manifest purpose of [the] particularity requirement [is] to prevent general searches."
Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1987). "Particularity
prohibits the government from conducting general, exploratory rummaging of a person's
belongings." United States v. Sigillito, 759 F.3d 913, 923 (8th Cir. 2014) (quotations omitted).
"The fact that [a]warrant call[s] for seizure of a broad array of items does not, in and of itself,
prove that the warrant fails to meet this requirement of particularity." United States v. Sugar, 606
F. Supp. 1134, 1151 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). "The warrant must enable the searcher to reasonably
ascertain and identify the things which are authorized to be seized." United States v. Cook, 657
F.2d 730, 733 (5th Cir. 1981) (citations omitted). "The degree of specificity required will depend
on the circumstances of the case and on the type of items involved." United States v. Summage,
481 F.3d 1075, 1079 (8th Cir. 2007). "The particularity requirement is one of practical accuracy
rather than of hypertechnicality." Sigillito, 759 F.3d at 923.
B.

The Search Warrant was not Overbroad

The search warrant at issue here identifies with particularity the place to be searched and
the items to be seized. As noted above, Attachment A describes a single email account, the
4

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 5 of 19

PageID #: 110

specific company that is in possession of the information contained within the email account, and
where that company is located. Attachment B identifies with unyielding specificity precisely
which items are to be seized from the email account. For example, since the supporting
affidavit readily establishes that this particular email account has been used to facilitate criminal
activity, determining both who created the account and who uses the account is critical to
furthering the investigation. With this in mind, Attachment B outlines an intent to seize, among
other things, the following:
-

The contents of all e-mails associated with the account . . . the source and destination
addresses associated with each e-mail, the date and time at which each e-mail was
sent, and the size and length of each e-mail;

-

all records or other information regarding the identification of the account, to include
full name, physical address, telephone numbers and other identifiers;

-

the date on which the account was created;

-

the IP address used to register the account, log-in IP addresses associated with session
times and dates, account status, alternative e-mail addresses provided during
registration, methods of connecting, log files, and means and source of payment
(including any credit or bank account number);

-

all records or other information stored . . . by an individual using the account,
including address books, contact and buddy lists, calendar data, pictures, and files;

-

all records pertaining to communications between the Provider and any person
regarding the account, including contacts with support services and records of actions
taken; and

-

records or other information regarding the identification of the account.

All of this information sought to be obtained is directly relevant to identifying the user of the
account in question and can hardly be described in any reasonable way as lacking in specificity.
In addition to identifying the user of the account, agents also sought evidence of the
crime itself. Specifically, agents sought (1) “information pertaining to the operation, ownership,
5

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 6 of 19

PageID #: 111

and control of an unlicensed money service business;” and (2) “communications [pertaining] to
the operation of an unlicensed money service business.” While it may be arguable that the
phrase ‘unlicensed money service business’ does not rival a laser beam in terms of precision,
such a level of precision is not necessitated by the Fourth Amendment – particularly in a case of
this nature. Spinelli v. United States, 382 F.2d 871, 886 (8th Cir. 1967) ("When the
circumstances of the crime make an exact description of the fruits and instrumentalities a virtual
impossibility, the searching officer can only be expected to describe the generic class of items he
is seeking."), rev'd on other grounds, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969).
Bottom line - a law enforcement agent conducting a search under this warrant would know
exactly where to look and exactly what to look for.
C.

The Two-Step Procedure for Executing the Warrant is Reasonable

In addition to attacking the warrant itself, defendants take issue with the procedures
employed to facilitate execution of the warrant because the United States seized emails in the
account that fall outside the scope of the warrant. Specifically, defendants argue that:
A search of an entire email account that may have been active for years will cover
many thousands of documents, images, other materials and perhaps the most
personal details of an individual’s life. Under these circumstances, the
particularity requirement is heightened and we must demand that the government
be even more specific and focused in its search.
Oddly specificity is probably easier in the electronic context since the service
provider could easily filter digital information. A more limited quantity of
information might easily be provided to the government based on specific search
terms or date limiters or addresses and domain names related to the investigation.
None of that happened here.
See Defense Motion to Suppress at 3.
As an initial matter, under Supreme Court precedent, it is reasonable for officers
6

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 7 of 19

PageID #: 112

executing a warrant to examine emails that fall within the scope of Attachment A to determine
which ones fall within the scope of Attachment B. In general, when officers execute a warrant,
“[a] container that may conceal the object of a search authorized by a warrant may be opened
immediately; the individual’s interest in privacy must give way to the magistrate’s official
determination of probable cause.” United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 823 (1982). See also
LaFave, Search and Seizure, § 4.10(a), at 932 (5th ed. 2012) (“A search made under authority of
a search warrant may extend to the entire area covered by the warrant’s description.”).
Officers cannot determine whether a document falls within the scope of the warrant
without reviewing it; thus, they must examine it to determine whether it falls within the scope of
the warrant.

The Supreme Court recognized and approved this process in Andresen v.

Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 482 n.11 (1976), where it stated that “[i]n searches for papers, it is
certain that some innocuous documents will be examined, at least cursorily, in order to determine
whether they are, in fact, among those papers authorized to be seized.” Similarly, the D.C.
Circuit has approved a “brief perusal” of each document to determine whether it falls within the
scope of the warrant; it directed that “the perusal must cease at the point at which the warrant’s
inapplicability to each document is clear.” United States v. Heldt, 668 F.2d 1238, 1267 (D.C.
Cir. 1982). Here, the United States executed a warrant in the manner authorized by Andresen
and Heldt: it examined emails within the scope of Attachment A to determine whether they
constitute evidence or instrumentalities within the scope of Attachment B.
The United States did not adopt novel or unprecedented procedures here. To the
contrary, this two-step approach to warrants for electronic evidence was explicitly adopted by the
2009 amendments to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41, Advisory
7

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 8 of 19

PageID #: 113

Committee’s Notes (2009 amend.). These amendments were promulgated by the Supreme Court.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2072. Rule 41 now provides that a warrant “may authorize the seizure of
electronic storage media or the seizure or copying of electronically stored information. Unless
otherwise specified, the warrant authorizes a later review of the media or information consistent
with the warrant. The time for executing the warrant in Rule 41(e)(2)(A) and (f)(1)(A) refers to
the seizure or on-site copying of the media or information, and not to any later off-site copying
or review.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e)(2)(B)
Fed. R. Crim. P. 41, Advisory Committee’s Notes (2009 amend.) recognize that
electronic storage media “commonly contain such large amounts of information that it is often
impractical for law enforcement to review all of the information during execution of the warrant
at the search location.” Id. The Notes “acknowledge[] the need for a two-step process: officers
may seize or copy the entire storage medium and review it later to determine what electronically
stored information falls within the scope of the warrant.” Id. Thus, in promulgating the Rule,
the Supreme Court recognized that the two-step procedure would be used routinely for searches
of electronic evidence.
In addition, courts have widely approved the two-step procedure for executing warrants
for electronic evidence, both before and after the 2009 amendment to Rule 41. As the Sixth
Circuit explained, “[t]he federal courts are in agreement that a warrant authorizing the seizure of
a defendant's home computer equipment and digital media for a subsequent off-site electronic
search is not unreasonable or overbroad, as long as the probable-cause showing in the warrant
application and affidavit demonstrate a ‘sufficient chance of finding some needles in the
computer haystack.’” United States v. Evers, 669 F.3d 645, 652 (6th Cir. 2012). Every court of
8

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 9 of 19

PageID #: 114

appeals to consider the issue has endorsed the two-step process for warrants for electronic
evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Stabile, 633 F.3d 219, 233-34 (3d Cir. 2011) (rejecting
argument that computers should have been searched on-site and stating that “practical realities of
computer investigations preclude on-site searches”); United States v. Grimmett, 439 F.3d 1263,
1268–70 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding that a warrant for the search of “any and all” computer
hardware and software for child pornography authorized both the seizure and subsequent search
of the defendant's computer files); Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 335 (6th Cir. 2001) (“Because of
the technical difficulties of conducting a computer search in a suspect's home, the seizure of the
computers, including their content, was reasonable in these cases to allow police to locate the
offending files.”); United States v. Hay, 231 F.3d 630, 637-38 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that
officers were justified in removing computers for off-site search “because of the time, expertise,
and controlled environment required for a proper analysis”); United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d
532, 535 (1st Cir. 1999) (“As a practical matter, the seizure and subsequent off-premises search
of the computer and all available disks was about the narrowest definable search and seizure
reasonably likely to obtain the images [of the child pornography sought].”).2
Similarly, the Eighth Circuit upheld as reasonable the execution of a two-step warrant
under 18 U.S.C. § 2703 for email stored with a web-based email provider in United States v.
Bach, 310 F.3d 1063, 1067-68 (8th Cir. 2002). In Bach, an investigator “obtained a state search
warrant to retrieve from Yahoo! e-mails between the defendant and possible victims of criminal
Appellate courts have also approved off-site sorting in cases involving paper documents, rather
than electronic evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Santarelli, 778 F.2d 609, 616 (11th Cir. 1985)
(upholding off-site examination of documents from defendant’s desk and four-drawer filing
cabinet); United States v Hargus, 128 F.3d 1358, 1363 (10th Cir. 1997) (upholding seizure of an
entire file cabinet because seizure was motivated by the impracticability of on-site sorting).

sexual conduct, as well as the Internet Protocol addresses connected to his account.” Id. at 1065.
However, Yahoo! employees did not attempt to find this particular information:
Yahoo! technicians retrieved all of the information from Bach's account at
dlbch15@yahoo.com and AM's Yahoo! e-mail account. According to Yahoo!,
when executing warrants, technicians do not selectively choose or review the
contents of the named account. The information retrieved from Bach and AM's
accounts was either loaded onto a zip disc or printed and sent to [a law enforcement
officer]. E-mails recovered from Bach's account detail him exchanging pictures
with other boys and meeting with them.
Id. The court upheld this search as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 1067-68.
The two-step procedure for email warrants has also been upheld by district courts –
including this one. United States v. Taylor, 764 F. Supp.2d 230, 237 (D. Me. 2011); United
States v. Bowen, 689 F. Supp.2d 675, 682 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). The defense suggestion that Yahoo!
should be required to conduct the search for law enforcement is unprecedented, contrary to
Fourth Amendment principles and should be rejected. As noted further below, such a procedure
is also unworkable, impractical and unreasonable.
D.

Requiring Yahoo! to Execute the Warrant is Unreasonable

Defendants’ proposed manner of warrant execution, under which employees of a private
company must review information in an email account to determine the information that falls
within the scope of the warrant, is unreasonable. As an initial matter, defendants cite no authority
for imposing this requirement, and there is none. As this very court has noted, “The Fourth
Amendment does not require the government to delegate a prescreening function to the internet
service provider or to ascertain which e-mails are relevant before copies are obtained from the
internet service provider for subsequent searching.” United States v. Taylor, 764 F. Supp.2d
230, 237 (D. Me. 2011). See also United States v. Bowen, 689 F. Supp.2d 675, 682 (S.D.N.Y.
10

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 11 of 19

PageID #: 116

2010) (similar). In the context of a physical warrant, it would be improper for a magistrate judge
to require a landlord, rather than government agents, to execute a warrant to search an apartment
for documents. Defendants’ suggestion that Yahoo! should execute a warrant for email stored on
its servers is similarly erroneous.
As a practical matter, defendants’ approach is unworkable. Executing a search warrant is
not a ministerial procedure that can be delegated to untrained, non-governmental personnel. To
effectively execute a warrant, a person must be equipped to separate responsive from nonresponsive information. To properly interpret the significance of a document that may relate to a
criminal offense, executing agents benefit from detailed knowledge about the particular crime
under investigation, its participants, and their practices. Messages that might appear innocuous to
someone without knowledge of the case could actually be crucial evidence (whether inculpatory
or exculpatory) of the crimes at issue. In addition, sharing information about the crime under
investigation with a private party inappropriately risks the security and integrity of the
investigation. Agents executing email warrants frequently must know grand jury information and
information concerning the identity of confidential informants. The United States cannot hire,
supervise, or fire service provider employees; thus, the government should not be forced to trust
them with the sensitive facts of criminal investigations.
Second, even if this information could be disclosed to employees of service providers, it
would be unreasonably burdensome for the United States to have to educate provider personnel
about the details of an investigation each time it seeks to execute an email warrant. The process
would be time-consuming, expensive, and would unreasonably delay the execution of warrants.
Furthermore, even with some instruction, service provider employees would still be unlikely to
11

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 12 of 19

PageID #: 117

know the case as well as government investigators, so some responsive information would likely
not be recognized. In short, requiring service provider employees to execute email warrants
“would be less effective than allowing government agents to determine the relevance of
particular emails.” United States v. Deppish,

F. Supp.2d

, 2014 WL 349735, at *6 (D. Kan.

Jan. 31, 2014).
Third, even if service provider employees could be educated about the facts of an
investigation, they would still likely be less skilled in executing a warrant than trained federal
agents. Agents with experience and knowledge of the criminal offenses under investigation are
more likely than service provider employees to know whether information constitutes evidence
of crime. And agents are more likely than service provider employees to care whether they
succeed in finding relevant evidence. Defendants’ suggested requirement would force the
government, in executing warrants, to rely on service provider employees with uncertain levels
of experience, interest, capability, understanding, diligence, integrity, and bias. That requirement
has no basis in the Fourth Amendment and should be rejected.
Fourth, speed is often critical to the execution of a warrant, and the defendants’ procedure
would likely slow execution of email warrants to a snail’s pace. Currently, even without the
additional burden that defendants’ suggestion would impose, many email providers struggle to
complete within two weeks the ministerial task of producing the contents of a specified email
account. Requiring providers to perform the more difficult task of searching for the particular
items to be seized under a warrant would likely overwhelm them and lead to significant delays in
warrant execution. In drafting the provision of 18 U.S.C. § 2703 for extra- district jurisdiction to
issue email warrants, Congress emphasized the need for speed in executing such warrants:
12

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 13 of 19

PageID #: 118

An investigator, for example, located in Boston who is investigating a suspected
terrorist in that city, might have to seek a suspect's electronic e-mail from an
Internet service provider (ISP) account located in California. The investigator
would then need to coordinate with agents, prosecutors and judges in the district
in California where the ISP is located to obtain a warrant to search. These time
delays could be devastating to an investigation, especially where additional
criminal or terrorist acts are planned.
H.R. Rep. 107-326(I), 107th Cong., 1st Sess., at 57 (2001). Congress’s goal of timely warrant
execution thus would be undermined by the defendants’ requirement that service providers
execute email warrants.
Fifth, requiring service provider employees to execute email warrants will not protect
account owners. To find responsive information, someone is going to have to see what is stored
in the specified email account. There is no reason to suspect that service provider employees are
more likely than government agents to safeguard from improper disclosure information learned
during execution of a warrant. In fact, the opposite is true: service provider employees are not
sworn to uphold the Constitution, trained in their duties and responsibilities in executing
warrants, or likely to be held accountable if execution is performed unreasonably. In addition, if
Yahoo! employees were to review the email within attachment A to determine whether it falls
within Attachment B, they would be acting as government agents for Fourth Amendment
purposes, because they will be acting at the direction of law enforcement. See e.g., Coolidge v.
New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 487 (1971) (stating that a civilian is a state actor for Fourth
Amendment purposes when she “act[s] as an ‘instrument’ or agent of the state”); United States v.
Sparks, 265 F.3d 825, 830 (9th Cir. 2001) (stating that it was undisputed that a civilian acted “as
an agent of the state” when he assisted law enforcement with a search), overruled on other
grounds, United States v. Grisel, 488 F.3d 844 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). Thus, even under
13

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 14 of 19

PageID #: 119

defendants’ approach, persons acting as agents of the government will review all the email
within Attachment A. Rather than protecting against the issuance of a general warrant,
defendants’ approach merely ensures that the agents executing the warrant are civilians rather
than professional investigators.
Sixth, although it might be possible for providers to develop the capacity to perform
keyword searches on behalf of the government, keyword searches are an inadequate substitute
for a message-by-message review during execution of the warrant. Keyword searches may hit on
some responsive documents, but they miss large quantities of relevant evidence. Criminals may
(intentionally or unintentionally) use different terminology than the keywords. They may
misspell words. They may communicate through images or attachments not readily susceptible
to keyword searches. Other incriminating email messages may be comprised entirely of words
that on their own are clearly innocuous, such as “I did that thing you asked.”
For these reasons, federal courts have rejected arguments that searches of electronic
evidence may be limited to keyword searches. See, e.g., United States v. Crespo-Rios, 645 F.3d
37, 43-44 (1st Cir. 2011) (holding that “government agents cannot simply search certain folders
or types of files for keywords” because they could miss relevant evidence); United States v.
Adjani, 452 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that restricting computer search to specific search
terms “would likely have failed to cast a sufficiently wide net to capture the evidence sought”);
United States v. Vilar, 2007 WL 1075041, at *38 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2007) (“[I]t seems
manifestly obvious that any requirement that a computer search be confined by a key-word
search protocol would inevitably immunize criminals.”); United States v. Graziano, 558 F. Supp.
2d 304, 315 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (“[R]estrict[ing] the computer search in every case to certain
14

Case 2:15-cr-00198-GZS Document 40 Filed 06/20/16 Page 15 of 19

PageID #: 120

methodologies or terms would give criminals the ability to evade law enforcement scrutiny
simply by utilizing coded terms in their files or documents.”). Under Andresen and Heldt, the
government is entitled to make a brief perusal of each email to determine whether it falls within
the scope of the warrant; it is not required to limit itself to a process that is an inadequate
substitute.
Finally, to insist that the service provider, rather than law enforcement agents, execute the
warrant, is to essentially require the government to rely on subpoena-like process to obtain
evidence from a third-party email service provider. The Supreme Court rejected such a
requirement in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 560-63 (1978). In that case, the district
court had held that a subpoena rather than a warrant must be used to obtain information from a
third-party not suspected of a crime. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that “we are
unpersuaded that the District Court's new rule denying search warrants against third parties and
insisting on subpoenas would substantially further privacy interests without seriously
undermining law enforcement efforts.” Id. at 560.
E.

Good Faith Reliance

Assuming, arguendo, that the search warrant in this case was deemed to be overbroad, the
agents nevertheless acted in good faith in seizing the evidence pursuant to the warrant. In
United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), the Supreme Court held that the exclusionary rule
"cannot be expected, and should not be applied, to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement
activity." Id. at 919. That is particularly true, the Court noted, "when an officer acting with
objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or a magistrate and acted within
its scope." Id. at 920. The Court reasoned that, in such circumstances, the deterrent value of
15

PageID #: 121

the exclusionary rule is vitiated by the fact that an officer cannot be expected to question the
magistrate's probable-cause determination or his judgment that the form of the search warrant is
technically sufficient. Id. at 921.
The Supreme Court applied the same exception in the companion case of Massachusetts
v. Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981 (1984) to a search warrant that insufficiently described the items to be
seized. In Sheppard, the trial judge suppressed evidence seized during the execution of a search
warrant that incorrectly identified the items to be seized as evidence of a narcotics transaction,
rather than a murder. Relying on Leon, the Supreme Court reversed, emphasizing that the
officers had demonstrated their good faith by submitting an affidavit to a judge and thereafter
relying on the judge's determination that the warrant was sufficiently particularized. Sheppard,
468 U.S. at 989-91. See also Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 359-61 (1987) (applying Leon to a
state law, later held invalid, that authorized a warrantless search, even though the statute could
have been more narrowly drawn).
The same considerations that prompted the Supreme Court to apply the good faith
exception in Leon, Sheppard, and Krull are also present here. SA Fife, armed with information
obtained during the course of his investigation, drafted an affidavit in support of an application
for a search warrant authorizing the search of the Yahoo! email account. Prior to submitting the
application, affidavit and draft search warrant to a judicial officer, SA Fife sought the input of an
Assistant U.S. Attorney.
As the First Circuit has noted in United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739 (1999), there are
circumstances, where the existence of good faith will not cure the defect:
There are four exclusions to the Leon good-faith exception: (1) when the
magistrate . . . was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was
16

false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard for the
truth; (2) where the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his [detached and
neutral] judicial role; (3) where the affidavit is so lacking in indicia of probable
cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable; and (4)
where a warrant is so facially deficient B i.e. in failing to particularize the place to
be searched or the things to be seized B that the executing officers cannot
reasonably presume it to be valid.
Id. at 745 (quotations and citation omitted). None of these exceptions, however, applies here.
Judge Rich reasonably found probable cause to believe the stated items would be found in the
Yahoo! e-mail account and issued a warrant that the officers reasonably relied upon and executed
properly and within its scope. There is no evidence that the issuing judge abandoned his
detached and neutral role. See id. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the officers were
dishonest or reckless in applying for, relying upon and executing the warrant. See id. Finally,
there is no evidence that any officer attempted to obtain the warrant though deceit or omission.
See id. Accordingly, as in United States v. Robinson, 359 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 2004), and
United States Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 334 (1st Cir. 2003), the Court should find the good faith
exception applies and that suppression of the evidence in this case would do nothing to further
the exclusionary rule=s objective of deterring police misconduct. See also United States v. Diaz,
841 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1988) (applying Leon good faith exception in context of a search
conducted in reliance on a warrant later found to be ovebroad).
