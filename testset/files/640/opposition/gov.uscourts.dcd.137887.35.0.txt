DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendant (“the District”), by and through undersigned counsel, hereby submits this
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, in
accordance with LCvR 7(b). A proposed Order denying the requested relief has also been
provided.
I. Background
As the District recently noted, the parties completed dispositive briefing here over twoand-a-half years ago. Since that time, important, persuasive case law has developed from other
jurisdictions regarding the scope of the Second Amendment, the legal issue at the heart of this
case.
The District’s supplemental memorandum did not raise any new arguments, but discussed
this subsequent case law, and explicitly acknowledged that no facts material to the instant matter
have changed. Plaintiffs do not dispute any of these contentions. Simply put, the District’s filing
of its supplemental memorandum was not improper, and plaintiffs have failed to present any rule
or case law suggesting otherwise.

II. Argument
Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied because it is procedurally improper, and fails on the
merits.
First, plaintiffs’ motion should be denied because the federal rules only provide for
striking pleadings, and not supplemental memoranda or motions. See, e.g., Bond v.
ATSI/Jacksonville Job Corps Center, 811 F.Supp.2d 417, 421 (D.D.C. 2011) (RCL) (citing Fed.
R. Civ. P. 12(f) and 7(a)); Brown v. FBI, 793 F.Supp.2d 368, 382 (D.D.C. 2011) (“[A] cursory
review of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure informs that non-pleadings . . . are not subject to
motions to strike.”) (quoting Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. Miski, 683
F.Supp.2d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 2010) (RCL)); Baloch v. Norton, 517 F.Supp.2d 345, 349 (D.D.C.
2007) (same). See also Brown, 811 F.Supp.2d at 382 (quoting 2 James Wm. Moore et al.,
MOORE’S FED. PRAC.—CIVIL ¶ 12.37 (3d ed. 2011) (“Only material included in a ‘pleading’ may
be the subject of a motion to strike, and courts have been unwilling to construe the term broadly.
Motions, briefs or memoranda . . . may not be attacked by the motion to strike.”)).
Plaintiffs cite LCvR 7(e), but nothing in the text of that rule prohibits the filing made by
the District. Plaintiffs provide no other authority except to name-drop the Chief Judge via
comments he made about the District and its lawyers thirteen years ago. Notwithstanding
plaintiffs’ ad hominem attack, the Chief Judge is clearly aware of the standards governing
motions to strike. See Bond, supra and Miski, supra.
Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied.
Otherwise, even if plaintiffs had properly invoked the Rules, motions to strike are
“disfavored.” Capitol Sprinkler Inspection, Inc. v. Guest Servs., Inc., 630 F.3d 217, 226 (D.C.
Cir. 2011) (citing Stabilisierungsfonds Fur Wein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distrib., 647 F.2d 200,

201 (D.C. Cir. 1981)). “A motion to strike is considered an exceptional remedy and is generally
disfavored, and the proponent of such a motion must shoulder a formidable burden.” United
States ex. rel. Hockett v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 498 F.Supp.2d 25, 34–35 (D.D.C.
2007) (citation omitted). See also NCB Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. FDIC, ___ F.Supp.2d ____, 2012
WL 468365, *7 (D.D.C. Feb. 4, 2012) (same).
Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) provides that a court may
strike from a pleading any material that is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous [.]”
Plaintiffs have not shown (nor even attempted to show) that the District’s Supplemental
Memorandum contained any such material. See Nwachkwu v. Karl, 216 F.R.D. 176, 178 (D.D.C.
2003) (many courts grant motions to strike “only if the portions sought to be stricken are
prejudicial or scandalous.”); Pigford v. Veneman, 215 F.R.D. 2, 4 (D.D.C. 2003) (“scandalous”
here means “any allegation that unnecessarily reflects on the moral character of an individual or
states anything in repulsive language that detracts from the dignity of the court.”) (citations
omitted); Makuch v. FBI, 2000 WL 915767, *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 7, 2000) (matter in pleadings is
immaterial or impertinent where it “is not materially relevant to any pleaded claim for relief or
defense.”) (citations omitted).
The information provided by the District is all a matter of historic (and public) record,
and was only provided to assist the Court with deciding the pending motions—it is clearly
relevant. Cf. Bond v. United States Dep’t of Justice, ___ F.Supp.2d ____, 2011 WL 6046406, *8
(D.D.C. Dec. 6, 2011) (denying motion to strike a motion) (“[I]t is routine for parties to provide
the Court with a certain amount of background information that is not directly relevant to the
merits of the claim or motion at issue.”) (quoting Patton Boggs, LLP v. Chevron Corp., 791
F.Supp.2d 13, 22 (D.D.C. 2011) (denying motion to strike a motion)).

Moreover, the District does not object to the plaintiffs’ filing of the other briefs from the
Seventh Circuit litigation, as this Court should have all potentially pertinent information before it
in deciding the pending motions.

III. Conclusion
For the reasons cited herein, plaintiffs’ motion should be denied.
