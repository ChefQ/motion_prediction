INTRODUCTION
Any patent infringement analysis must start with claim interpretation. Ops-Core asserts

that the language in the asserted claims "[a] shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an
insert, a lock and a release mechanism" requires that the four elements, and in particular the lock
and the release mechanism "be located on the shroud plate itself, not on an attached device." See
Ops-Core Memorandum1 at page 12. However, Ops-Core offers no explanation or support for
this particular claim interpretation. Moreover, Ops-Core fails to tell the Court that it asserted the
exact opposite interpretation of this same claim language in its successful effort to have the
patents-in-suit reexamined.
In its requests for reexamination, Ops-Core asserted:
In the case of the '810 patent the latch and release button are on the
female element, whereas they are on the male element in the US
HMA OPERATOR'S MANUAL. Such placement of the latch and
the release does not militate against anticipation since once the
male and female portions are engaged, the latch and release
effectively become part of the claimed shroud plate, i.e., they form
an assembly which includes all of the elements of claim 1.
Request for Reexamination at page 7 (Declaration of Daly2, Ex. F).
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") accepted this interpretation, as did
Norotos. The US HMA OPERATOR'S MANUAL was distinguished on other grounds.
Ops-Core presently attempts to adopt one claim interpretation to avoid infringement after
asserting the opposite claim interpretation in its effort to invalidate the patents-in-suit. Ops-Core
cannot have it both ways. Claim language is interpreted as a matter of law and that interpretation

Ops-Core's Memorandum in Support of Defendant Ops-Core, Inc.'s Motion for Summary
Judgment and for Sanctions ("Ops-Core Memorandum").

Factual support for this opposition brief is found in a number of declarations filed in this matter
in support of Norotos's motion for summary judgment, such as Declaration of Thomas J. Daly in
Support of Plaintiff Norotos, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Adjudication of Infringement of United
States Patent 6,751,810. These declarations are cited herein as "Declaration of _____________."

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

must be consistent in determining both infringement and validity. Norotos has consistently
asserted that the claim language at issue is broad enough to cover an assembly of attached
elements and does not require a unitary structure. Such an interpretation is consistent with the
claim language itself, the specification of the patents, and the way the PTO interpreted the claims
during reexamination.
The correct claim interpretation compels a determination that Ops-Core infringes at least
claim 22 of the '810 Patent. Thus, Ops-Core's motion should be denied and that of Norotos be
granted.
II.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Ops-Core's statement of the facts in this case is not so much inaccurate as it is

incomplete.
Ops-Core stresses that it asserted a claim interpretation requiring a unitary structure for
the shroud plate in its letters to Norotos at the beginning of this dispute.

See Ops-Core

Memorandum at pgs. 5-6. Ops-Core asserts the same claim interpretation in its present motion.
Id. at page 12. However, Ops-Core fails to inform the Court that it took the exact opposite
position on interpretation of the same claim language in its request for reexamination filed with
the PTO. It told the PTO that engagement of the portions of a shroud plate and a lock plate
effectively makes elements of the lock plate part of the shroud plate such that they form an
assembly that would be covered by the language at issue herein. See Request for Reexamination
at page 7 (Declaration of Daly, Ex. F).
Moreover, Ops-Core fails to tell the Court that the PTO adopted the claim interpretation
it asserted, see Order Granting Reexamination at pgs. 4-5 (Declaration of Daly, Ex. G), and that
Norotos did not contest this interpretation but, rather, was able to establish patentability of the
Norotos inventions by distinguishing the prior art cited by Ops-Core on other grounds, see
Notice of Intent to Issue Reexamination Certificate at page 2 (Declaration of Daly, Ex. M).
Thus, Norotos has asserted a consistent interpretation for this claim language throughout.
Compare November 20, 2008 Letter to Mr. Rogers of Ops-Core (Declaration of Daly, Ex. C)
-2-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Filed 10/25/10 Page 7 of 20

with Plaintiff's Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Preliminary Infringement Contentions at page
1. Norotos has always insisted that this claim language is broad enough to cover assembled
elements as well as a unitary structure. Id. The PTO agreed with the Norotos interpretation
(Declaration of Daly, Ex. G) as did Ops-Core when it suited its purpose in the context of its
request for reexamination. (Declaration of Daly, Ex. F)
Ops-Core also asserts that it has not made or sold the mounts with which its VAS
Shrouds are intended to be used. See Ops-Core Memorandum at page 5. However, although
Ops-Core attaches to its motion many of the letters exchanged between Ops-Core and Norotos
regarding the present dispute, it does not include the first letter its Vice President, Mr. Rogers,
sent to Norotos. In that letter, dated November 1, 2008, Mr. Rogers states: "We are currently in
the process of launching two new helmet models which all utilize these VAS Shroud mount
products. . . ." Declaration of Soto at ยถ 5, Ex. A at page 1. He later adds: "[W]e purchased (at
list price) several of your AKAZ mounts and provided them to operators in theater with our
helmets." Id., Ex. A. pg. 3. Thus, Ops-Core has admitted that it has distributed to several of its
customers the assembly accused of infringement.
Moreover, Ops-Core's brief in support of its motion suggests that the VAS Shroud exists
in a vacuum and that Ops-Core has little or nothing to do with how the VAS Shroud is used. See
Ops-Core Memorandum at pgs. 4-5. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Mr. Rogers of
Ops-Core states in a letter that Ops-Core did include with its motion, "Norotos, Inc. stands to
receive a substantial amount of new sales and revenue from thousands of helmets and shrouds
we are selling that only work with your mount products." Declaration of Rogers, Ex. C;
Declaration of Soto, Ex. C. Thus, Ops-Core has admitted that its VAS Shroud products have no
substantial use other than in the assembly accused of infringement.
Further, with regard to use of the VAS Shroud, Ops-Core has used its VAS Shroud
product in the assembly accused of infringement at trade shows and in pictures shown in its press
releases, on its website, on its packaging and in its catalogs. See Declaration of Prendergast at ยถยถ
9 and 10, Exs. C, D, E and F. Ops-Core's press releases, website, packaging and catalogs all

Filed 10/25/10 Page 8 of 20

promote and show use of the VAS Shroud with a mount, an accused infringing assembly. Id.
The packaging that Ops-Core uses with its VAS Shroud products explicitly instructs purchasers
how to use the product in an assembly accused of infringement. See Declaration of Chavez at ยถ
5, Ex. D.
In particular, Ops-Core's brief at page 7 includes an illustration that Ops-Core obliquely
describes as one "attached to Norotos's Infringement Contentions." What Ops-Core fails to note
is that the illustration comes from Ops-Core's own packaging for the VAS Shroud product. See
Declaration of Chavez, Ex. D.
Norotos has asserted that its patent claims cover the VAS Shroud product when it is used
with a mount. Ops-Core has itself used this very assembly. See Declaration of Prendergast, Exs.
E and F. It admits that it has distributed this combination to customers. See Declaration of Soto,
Ex. A. Ops-Core admits and is well aware that the VAS Shroud has no other substantial use
besides use in this assembly. See Declaration of Soto, Ex. C. Ops-Core encourages and instructs
its customers on how to use the VAS Shroud in this assembly. See, e.g., Declaration of Chavez
at ยถ 5, Ex. D.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
The claim language "[a] shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an insert, a lock

and a release mechanism" in the claims at issue in this case should be interpreted as covering an
assembly of the four elements attached together and does not require that they be in a unitary
structure. Such an interpretation is consistent with the claim language itself, the specification of
the patents, and the way the PTO interpreted the claims during reexamination. The Federal
Circuit has stated that claim terms should be given the full range of their ordinary meaning as
understood by persons skilled in the relevant art. See Texas Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc.,
308 F.3d 1193, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).

The prior art cited during the

reexamination and the PTO's adoption of a claim interpretation that covered a shell and an insert
in a helmet mounting bracket that received a mount containing a lock and a release mechanism
shows that persons of ordinary skill in the art would understand that these claimed elements
could be assembled in separate parts. This is entirely logical because the lock and release
mechanism only serve a useful purpose when combined with the shell and the insert. In such a
combination, they releasably hold a mount in place. When separated from the shell and the
insert, they serve no purpose.
Properly interpreted, the claims at issue are infringed by the VAS Shroud used for its
intended purpose with a mount lock plate incorporating a lock and release mechanism attached
thereto. In this assembly, the shroud plate, i.e., the interface between the headgear and the
mount, does comprise a shell, an insert, a lock and a release mechanism. Thus, this assembly
literally infringes the claims at issue in this case.
Even if the noted claim language is determined to be directed at a device incorporating
each of the four recited elements, moving two of the four elements to a part that is intended to be
received by the part containing the other two elements should be considered an equivalent. It is
an insubstantial difference. The four elements still function in the same way to achieve the same
result. The lock and release mechanism only have a useful function when joined with the other
two elements.
-5-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Filed 10/25/10 Page 10 of 20

Ops-Core is itself a direct infringer of the claims at issue. It uses the infringing assembly
at trade shows and in numerous other contexts to promote the sale of its VAS Shroud product.
Moreover, it admits that it has supplied the infringing assembly to several customers. OpsCore's promotional materials shows the use of the infringing assembly by others. This is proof
of direct infringement.
Ops-Core has also admitted that the VAS Shroud product that it makes and sells has no
substantial use other than in the infringing assembly. Ops-Core is therefore a contributory
infringer. Moreover, Ops-Core encourages and instructs its customers to use the VAS Shroud in
an infringing assembly on its website, in its catalog, and on the packaging for the VAS Shroud.
Consequently, Ops-Core is inducing infringement.
The claim interpretation asserted by Norotos is the same as that asserted by Ops-Core in
requesting reexamination and is the same as that adopted by the PTO in the reexaminations. In
view thereof, asserting such a claim interpretation in this action cannot be sanctionable,
especially when it is the correct claim interpretation. Nothing in such conduct would make this
an exceptional case. Nothing in such conduct could implicate Rule 11. Further, Ops-Core has
failed to comply with the procedural requirements necessary to pursue sanctions under Rule 11.
IV.

ARGUMENT
A.

The Claim Terms at Issue are Properly Interpreted to Cover an Assembly of
the Recited Elements

"It is well-settled that, in interpreting an asserted claim, the court should look first to the
intrinsic evidence of record, i.e., the patent itself, including the claims, the specification and, if in
evidence, the prosecution history." Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582
(Fed. Cir. 1996). In the present case, the patent itself and the prosecution history, including
reexamination proceedings, support the meaning and scope of the identified claim terms asserted
by Norotos. See E.I Du Pont de Nemoours & Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 849 F.2d 1430,
1439 (Fed. Cir 1988) (indicating that statements made during the reexamination proceeding of a
patent are relevant prosecution history when interpreting claims).

"Shroud plate"

Claim 22 recites "[a] shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell, an insert a lock and a
release mechanism." Based upon this language itself, the specification and the prosecution
history, "shroud plate" should be interpreted to encompass either a structure that is integrated as
a single piece ("monolithic piece") or as a structure that is assembled together from two or more
separable pieces ("assembled piece").
The claim language merely recites the four elements that make up a "shroud plate."
Nothing about the language compels a reading that excludes these elements being assembled
from separate parts to form the "shroud plate."
The specification indicates that the invention of the '810 Patent relates to "a shroud plate
which may act as an interface between a helmet and the helmet mount for a night vision device."
'810 Patent at col. 1, lines 7-9, emphasis added, (Declaration of Daly, Ex. A). Additionally, the
specification provides that "the shroud plate of the present invention allows a helmet mount for a
night vision device to be easily attached and removed from a helmet." '810 Patent at col. 1, lines
61-63 (Id.) Neither the claim nor the specification preclude the shroud plate from being either a
monolithic piece or an assembled piece.
Further, during reexamination proceedings, Ops-Core3 indicated that "claims 1, 2, 8, and
11-13 of the '810 patent are considered to be unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. ยง102(b) because they
are anticipated by the printed publication entitled 'Operator's Manual Night Vision Goggles
AN/PVS-7B (NSN 5855-01-228-0937) (EIC: IPS) and AN/PVS-7D (NSN 5855-01-422-5413)
(EIC: N/A)' and published by the United States Departments of the Army, the Navy and the Air
Force and Headquarters, Marine Corps on December 1, 1997 ["US HMA Operator's Manual"]."
Request for Reexamination for U.S. Pat. No. 6,751,810, submitted June 10, 2009 ("Request for
Reexamination" at page 2 (Declaration of Daly, Ex. F)). At the time that Ops-Core filed its

Ops-Core acknowledged that it filed for an ex parte reexamination of the '810 patent. See OpsCore's Memorandum in Support of Defendant Ops-Core's Motion for Summary Judgment and
for Sanctions, at page 6. Such reexamination proceedings are a part of the prosecution history of
the '810 Patent and are relevant to claim interpretation.

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Request for Reexamination, claim 1 contained the same language cited above with respect to the
shroud plate.4
To support its position, Ops-Core included Figures 2-22 and 2-23 of the US HMA
Operator's Manual, both of which are provided below for convenience.

As can be seen in the figures reproduced above, the helmet mount assembly includes a
"helmet mounting bracket" and a "mount" separable from the helmet mounting bracket, wherein
the mount can be coupled to the helmet mounting bracket to form an assembled piece. In its
Request for Reexamination, Ops-Core argued that claim 1 is anticipated by the US HMA
Operator's Manual because the US HMA Operator's Manual discloses "[a] mount 36 [including]
a lock (latch) 38 and release mechanism (button) 40. See Figs. 2-22 and 2-23." Request for
Reexamination at page 3, claim chart, (Declaration of Daly, Ex. F).
Ops-Core further noted that "[a] removable element, such as Night Vision Goggles,
includes a male portion which matches a female portion mounted on the helmet. . . . In the case
of the '810 patent the latch and release button are on the female element, whereas they are on the
male element in the US HMA OPERATOR'S MANUAL. Such placement of the latch and the
release does not militate against anticipation since once the male and female portions are
engaged, the latch and release effectively become part of the claimed shroud plate, i.e., they form
4

In an Amendment filed on November 18, 2009, Norotos added, among others, claim 22.
Except as noted otherwise herein, the language of claim 22 under interpretation is identical to the
language of claim 1 and should be interpreted identically for both claims.
-8-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Filed 10/25/10 Page 13 of 20

an assembly which includes all of the elements of claim 1." Request for Reexamination at page
7, emphasis added, (Id.).
In an Office action in Ex Parte Reexamination dated September 18, 2009, the Examiner
agreed with Ops-Core's position and rejected claims 1, 2 and 11-15 under 35 U.S.C. ยง102(b) as
being anticipated by the US HMA Operator's Manual. September 18, 2009 Office action in Ex
Parte Reexamination at page 2 (Declaration of Daly, Ex. H). In rejecting the claims, the
Examiner indicated that the US HMA Operator's Manual discloses a shroud plate for head gear
comprising "a lock (see 'latch' in fig. 2-23), and a release mechanism (see 'release button' in fig.
2-22)." Id. As noted above, both the "latch" and the "release button" in the cited reference are
on the "mount" which is separate and separable from the "helmet mounting bracket."
Accordingly, even though the latch and the release button are not on the same member as the
shell and the insert, the Examiner agreed with Ops-Core that the latch and the release button
effectively become part of the claimed shroud plate because they form an assembly that includes
all of the elements of claim 1.
Norotos was ultimately able to overcome the anticipation rejection of claim 1, but did so
without amending the language cited above and without otherwise limiting the shroud plate to be
only a monolithic piece. Accordingly, "shroud plate" should be interpreted to encompass both an
assembled piece and a monolithic piece.
2.

"Insert"

Claim 22 recites "[a] shroud plate for headgear comprising a shell [and] an insert . . .
wherein the insert is adapted to receive a lock plate." Claim 22 indicates the function of the
insert, but it does not limit the structure of the insert. Accordingly, "insert" should be interpreted
to encompass a portion of the shroud plate that "is adapted to receive a lock plate, "even if that
portion is made from the same material as and is integral with the shell. This interpretation is
also supported by the specification and the prosecution history.
The specification provides that:
[t]he insert 16 is designed as a bay for a lock plate or adapter plate
-9-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Filed 10/25/10 Page 14 of 20

17 . . . and functions as the interface between a helmet mount and a
helmet 12. The shroud plate 10 may comprise an insert 16 that is
integral with a shell 13 essentially making the plate one piece. The
shroud plate 10 may comprise two integrally related pieces, the
shell 13 and the insert 16, to optimize weight and durability. . . .
However, it is also possible that the shroud plate 10 may be one
piece made from one material, for example all nylon or all
aluminum.
'810 Patent at col. 3, lines 17-29, emphasis added, (Declaration of Daly, Ex. A).
Clearly, the specification describes an "insert" as either (1) a structure that is a different
material from the shell or (2) a structure that is the same material as and integral with the shell.
As noted above, claim 22 does not specify a material from which the insert is made nor whether
the insert is integral with or made separately from the shell. Accordingly, "insert" as claimed in
claim 22 should be interpreted as encompassing both structures.
The prosecution history also supports the interpretation of "insert" which Norotos
proposes. In advocating its position regarding anticipation of the claimed phrase "the insert is
adapted to receive a lock plate" during reexamination, Ops-Core indicated that "[t]he US HMA
OPERATOR'S MANUAL Mounting Bracket 30 includes a recessed area formed by keepers 34
and 35 which are sized and shaped to receive lock plate 48 of mount 36. See Figs. 2-22 and 223." Request for Reexamination at page 4, claim chart, (Declaration of Daly, Ex. F). Further,
Ops-Core stated that "[t]he [U.S.] HMA [Operator's Manual] includes a Bracket which integrates
the shell and insert, and a Mount for the Night Vision Goggles which includes a lock and release
mechanism. The Helmet Mounting Bracket has a recessed area defined by Keepers sized and
shaped to receive the Mount" and "[i]n the US Helmet Mounting Assembly, the shell and insert
are integrated as one piece made from one material and are collectively referred to as the Helmet
Mounting Bracket." Request for Reexamination at pages 5-6, emphasis added, (Id.).
As noted above, the Examiner agreed with Ops-Core's position and rejected claims 1, 2
-10-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Filed 10/25/10 Page 15 of 20

and 11-15 under 35 U.S.C. ยง102(b) as being anticipated by the US HMA Operator's Manual.
September 18, 2009 Office action in Ex Parte Reexamination at page 2 (Declaration of Daly, Ex.
H). More specifically, the Examiner indicated that the US HMA Operator's Manual discloses a
shroud plate for head gear comprising "an insert (see a square portion "keeper" in figs. 2-22 and
2-23) . . . the insert [being] adapted to receive a lock plate." September 18, 2009 Office action in
Ex Parte Reexamination at page 2 (Id.).
Again, Norotos was able to overcome the anticipation rejection, but did so without
amending the language above or otherwise limiting the insert to being a different material from
the shell. Accordingly, Ops-Core's position during reexamination and the Examiner's subsequent
agreement with Ops-Core's position further supports interpreting "insert" as being broad enough
to cover a lock plate receiving portion that is integral with and made from the same material as
the shell of the shroud plate.
3.

"Smooth with rounded edges and corners at the periphery"

Claim 22 recites "wherein the external surface [of the shell] is smooth with rounded
edges and corners at the periphery, such that the shell has no projections on which a shroud line
may catch."
The specification provides that "previous helmet attachment mechanisms have comprised
sharp edges and/or hooked shaped portions which may interfere with or even seriously injure a
user. For instance, a hook portion may catch the shroud line of an opening parachute, cutting the
line or violently jerking the user's head and neck." '810 Patent at col. 1, lines 39-44 (Declaration
of Daly, Ex. A). The specification further provides that "the top surface of the shell 13 may be
smooth with rounded edges and corners. Fitting the shell 13 to the shape of the helmet 12 and
having a smooth surface with rounded edges and corners on the shell 13 ensures that there are no
unnecessary edges on which another object, such as a shroud line of a parachute or a dangling
tree branch in heavy foliage, may catch." '810 Patent at col. 3, lines 2-8 (Id.).
In response to an Office action in Ex Parte Reexamination, dated March 8, 2010, Norotos
added claim 22 which, as noted above, is substantially similar to claim 1, but added the
-11-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

Filed 10/25/10 Page 16 of 20

following relevant language (added language is underlined): "wherein the external surface [of the
shell] is smooth with rounded edges and corners at the periphery, such that the shell has no
projections on which a shroud line may catch." See Declaration of Daly, Ex. L.
In a Notice of Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate dated May 5, 2010, the
Examiner agreed that claim 22 was allowable over the US HMA Operator's Manual because "the
US HMA [Operator's Manual] fails to disclose an external surface of the shell [being] smooth
with rounded edges and corners at the periphery, such that the shell has no projections on which
a shroud line may catch because the shroud plate of US HMA [Operator's Manual] has
projections, such as the 'keepers' projecting from a side edge of the shroud plate." Notice of
Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate at page 2 (Declaration of Daly, Ex. M).
Accordingly, "smooth with rounded edges and corners at the periphery" should be
interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the claim language, i.e., that the external
surface of the shell has no projections on which a shroud line may catch.
B.

Once Properly Interpreted, the Disputed Claim Language Literally Reads on
the VAS Shroud as Used in its Intended Assembly

The VAS Shroud product made and sold by Ops-Core has a shell with an internal portion
that is adapted to receive a lock plate. Thus, it does have an "insert." Ops-Core attaches mounts
to its VAS Shroud product to demonstrate the resulting assembly at trade shows and to promote
its VAS Shroud product on its website, in its catalog and on its packaging. The compatible
mount has a lock plate that is received into the "insert" of the VAS Shroud. The lock plate also
includes a lock and a release mechanism. Thus, the assembly used by Ops-Core and by others as
shown in Ops-Core's promotional materials has the four elements recited in the contested claim
language used in an interface between a headgear and a mount, i.e., in a "shroud plate."
Accordingly, Ops-Core and others use an assembly that literally infringes. See Tate Access
Floors v. Interface Architectural Res., 279 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

At the Very Least, the VAS Shroud as Used in its Intended Assembly
Infringes Under the Doctrine of Equivalents

Norotos believes that the claims at issue should be interpreted to literally cover "shroud
plates" that are both unitary and assemblies. However, should the claims be interpreted as being
directed to "shroud plates" where the elements are incorporated into a single device, the claim
language and the patent specifications do not intentionally exclude the possibility of an assembly
of the recited elements.

That is, there is nothing in the claim language or the patent

specifications that could be read as disclaiming an assembly of the recited elements.
Accordingly, this claim language can be considered under the doctrine of equivalents.
The claims expressly recognize that the "insert is adapted to receive a lock plate."
Moreover, the claims also expressly recognize that the "lock" element "is adapted to secure the
lock plate to the insert," and that the "release mechanism" element "allows for removal of the
lock plate from the insert." Accordingly, the claim language clearly anticipates engagement
between the insert and the lock plate.
Whether the "lock" and "release mechanism" elements are located with the "insert" or
located with the "lock plate" makes no difference in the engagement. The lock and release
mechanism will still operate to secure the lock plate to the insert and to allow it to be removed.
Merely moving these elements from one half of the engagement to the other half is an
insubstantial difference, and should not result in an avoidance of infringement. See Sanitary
Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, 280 U.S. 30, 41-42 (1929) ("A close copy which seeks to use the
substance of the invention, and, although showing some change in form and position, uses
substantially the same devices, performing precisely the same offices with no change in
principle, constitutes an infringement.") See also, Corning Glass Works v. Sumitomo Electric
U.S.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("An equivalent must be found for every
limitation of the claim somewhere in an accused device, but not necessarily in a corresponding
component. . ..). Thus, if Ops-Core does not literally infringe, it should be found to infringe
under the doctrine of equivalents.

Ops-Core and Others Are Direct Infringers

Ops-Core asserts that it does not make or sell mounts and, therefore, does not make or
sell the infringing assembly. However, making and selling an infringing product are not the only
acts that can constitute infringement. Use of an infringing product is also an act of direct
infringement. 35 U.S.C. ยง 271(a). Extensive evidence is present in this case that Ops-Core itself
and others, as shown in Ops-Core's promotional materials, use the infringing assembly. OpsCore has used it at trade shows and has used it and shown its use by others in numerous
promotional materials. See Newriver, Inc. v. Newkirk Prods., 674 F. Supp. 2d 320, 328 (D.
Mass. 2009) (citing, Snuba Int'l, Inc. v. Dolphin World, Inc., 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 16946, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (unpublished) (circumstantial evidence from defendant's own promotional
materials sufficient to prove direct infringement)).

Thus, Ops-Core and others are direct

infringers.
E.

Ops-Core Contributes to and Induces Infringement

Ops-Core asserts that Norotos has not proven that the VAS Shroud has no substantial
non-infringing use. Yet, the Vice President of Ops-Core, Mr. Rogers, has stated that the VAS
Shroud will "only work" with the Norotos mount products, which would be an infringing
assembly. Declaration of Soto, Ex. C.
Moreover, in the press release introducing the VAS Shroud product, Ops-Core stated:
"The standard . . . Mount Arm . . . clicks into the VAS just like does the other issue mounts. Its
inserted and anchored underneath the top of the bracket and pushed down to snap into place
while pressing the adapter's release trigger." Declaration of Prendergast, Ex. C. No other end
use for the VAS Shroud is described. Similarly, on the packaging for the VAS Shroud product,
the use of the product is described, including: "STEP 3: ATTACH NVD ADAPTOR Insert and
anchor the top of the NVD adaptor underneath the top of the bracket as shown. While pressing
the adapter's release trigger, push down to snap and lock the adapter in place." Declaration of
Chavez at ยถ 5, Ex. D. No other end use for the VAS Shroud is described on its packaging. Thus,
the evidence is overwhelming that the VAS Shroud has no substantial use other than in an
-14-

Case 1:09-cv-10215-NG Document 38

infringing assembly. Accordingly, Ops-Core contributes to infringement. See, Ricoh Co., Ltd. v.
Quanta Computer, Inc., 550 F.3d 1325, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
As described above, Ops-Core instructs its customers for the VAS Shroud product to use
that product in an infringing assembly. It also encourages customers to adopt an infringing
assembly. In the press release introducing the VAS Shroud product, Ops-Core states: "If you
have a [night vision device], and use the Standard U.S. Army Mount Arm (#A3256368), do
yourself a favour and ditch your old hook and strap helmet mount or single-hole MICH mount.
The Ops-Core VAS Shroud is a must have upgrade . . ." Declaration of Prendergast, Ex. C.
Thus, Ops-Core is encouraging use of the VAS Shroud in an infringing assembly. Ops-Core is
inducing infringement. See Ricoh at 1341 (citing MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S.
913 (2005)).
F.

Sanctions on Norotos are Not Appropriate

Norotos has asserted a particular claim interpretation in this matter in good faith. For the
reasons set forth at length above, Norotos believes that it is the correct claim interpretation. It is
the same claim interpretation asserted by Ops-Core in the requests for reexamination, and it is
the same claim interpretation adopted by the PTO. Assertion of such a claim interpretation, and
assertion of the infringement that results therefrom, is not frivolous and cannot possibly give rise
to sanctions. See, e.g., Bicon, Inc. v. Straumann Co., 356 F. Supp. 2d 6, 8 (D. Mass. 2005).
Such conduct cannot make this an exceptional case. Id. Norotos' legal contentions as to claim
interpretation are warranted by existing law and, therefore, cannot give rise to sanctions under
Rule 11. F.R.C.P. 11(b)(2).
Moreover, Ops-Core has not complied with the procedural safeguards set forth in Rule 11
to be entitled to sanctions. Ops-Core has not made a separate motion for sanctions. See F.R.C.P.
11(c)(2). Also, Ops-Core did not serve the motion and then allow at least 21 days for withdrawal
of the challenged paper before filing the motion with the Court. Id. Thus, even if Norotos had
engaged in any conduct that might warrant sanctions, Ops-Core did not proceed properly to seek
any sanctions under Rule 11.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Ops-Core's motion for summary judgment and sanctions

should be denied in its entirety. Instead, Norotos's cross motion for summary judgment that OpsCore has infringed at least claim 22 of the '810 patent should be granted.
