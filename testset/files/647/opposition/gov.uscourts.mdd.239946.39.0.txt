RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINT
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(“Freddie Mac”) herein file their Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Amended
Complaint as follows:
1.

Plaintiff, Renee L. McCray (“McCray”), has filed a Motion for Leave to File an

Amended Complaint.
2.

Presently pending before the Court are Motions to Dismiss filed by the

Defendants with respect to McCray’s current Complaint.
3.

It is the position of the defendants that regardless of whether the Court permits

McCray to file her Amended Complaint, the disposition of the pending motions to dismiss
should not be affected.

In her Motion for leave, Plaintiff states that she has “added Corporate

Defendant Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. d/b/a America’s Servicing Company.” Motion for
Leave, ¶2. However, as acknowledged by McCray in her Amended Compliant at ¶9c Wells

Case 1:13-cv-01518-GLR Document 39 Filed 09/17/13 Page 2 of 3

Fargo Home Mortgage is a division of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

It is not a separately

incorporated entity. See printout of webpage from the National Information Center of the
Federal Reserve Board showing that the entity named “Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc.” was
acquired by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. on May 8, 2004. Thus, because Wells Fargo is already a
defendant in the case, and no new entity is being added as a party, the Motions to Dismiss of the
Defendants remain ripe for disposition.
4.

Plaintiff is proposing to dismiss her Maryland Fair Debt Collection Act claims

(Count II of her current Complaint) and her Maryland Consumer Protection Act claim (Count III
of her current Complaint). The Court should accept Plaintiff’s dismissal of those claims. Doing
so will moot the Motions to Dismiss with respect to those claims, but otherwise not affect the
pending motions with respect to Plaintiff’s other claims.
5.

As Plaintiff points out in her Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint, she is

not adding any “new claims” but she claims to be adding supporting factual allegations.
Motion, ¶4. However, a review of the proposed Amended Complaint discloses that none of the
proposed additional factual allegations materially affect the pending Motions to Dismiss. The
“new” allegations are either restatements of factual allegations already contained in the
Complaint, and/or recitation of factual assertions and arguments McCray has already made in
opposing the pending Motions to Dismiss.
WHEREFORE, for all the above reasons, Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac request that the
Court accept McCray’s dismissal of the Maryland Fair Debt Collection Act claims (Count II of
her current Complaint) and her Maryland Consumer Protection Act claim (Count III of her
current Complaint), and that regardless of whether the Court permits McCray to amend her

Complaint, that Defendants not be required to re-file their Motion to Dismiss, and that the Court
should grant such Motion to Dismiss all claims in the case.
