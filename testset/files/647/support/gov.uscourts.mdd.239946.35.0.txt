PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINT

Pursuant to Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff, Renee L. McCray
hereby respectfully moves the Court for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint which is
attached hereto, and says in support of this motion:

1. Plaintiff proposed Second Amended Complaint, which Plaintiff requests that the Court
accept for filing, is attached hereto. A redlined copy of the Second Amended Complaint is
attached.

2. In this Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has added Corporate Defendant Wells Fargo Home
Mortgage, Inc. d/b/a America's Servicing Company. Plaintiff has withdrawn two of the
original claims - Count IT Maryland Fair Debt Collection Act MMCDCA) Md. Code Ann.,

Com Law 0x00A7 14-201, et seq. and Count Ii] Maryland Consumer Protection Act (MCPA) Md.

Case 1:13-cv-01518-GLR Document 35 Filed 09/03/13 Page 2 of 5

in the opening complaint that have become known based upon continued investigation by the
Plaintiff.
. This Court recently summarized the appropriate standard of review for amended pleadings as
follows:

Under FRCP 15(a)(2), leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so
requires." Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222
(1962) (quoting FRCP 15(a)). Fourth Circuit case law directs that "[a]
motion to amend should be denied only where it would be prejudicial, there
has been bad faith, or the amendment would be futile." Noursion Rug Corp.
v. Parvizian, 535 F.3d 295, 298 Ce Cir. 2008). A review for futility is not
equivalent to an evaluation of the underlying merits of the case. To the
contrary, "[u]nless a proposed amendment may clearly be seen to be futile
because of substantive or procedural considerations, ... conjecture about the
merits of the litigation should not enter into the decision whether to all
amendment." Davis v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 615 F.2d 606, 613 (4 Cir.
1980), cert. dismissed, 448 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 25, 65 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1980).
"Leave to amend ... should only be denied on the ground of futility when
the proposed amendment is clearly insufficient or frivolous on its face."
Johnson v. Oroweat Foods Ce., 785 F.2d 503, 510 (40x00B0 Cir. 1986) (emphasis
added).

Next Generation Group, LLC v. Sylvan Learning Centers, LLC, CIV. CCB-11-0986, 2012
WL 37397 (D. Mad. Jan. 5, 2012).

. Plaintiff does not make these proposed amendments in bad faith; nor are Plaintiffs claims
futile. In fact, by the amendment, Plaintiff is not bringing any new claims but merely adding
supporting factual allegations as demonstrated above in light of the Court of Appeal's
subsequent ruling on the specific Maryland law at issue in this case.

. Plaintiff has conferred with counsel for the Defendants, Federal Home Mortgage Corporation
and through counsel, Defendants is undecided to consent or not consent until the motion is

filed. Plaintiff has conferred with counsel for the Defendants Samuel I. White, P.C. and

Substitute Trustees. Mr. Hillman stated he would get back to Plaintiff. Plaintiff have not

communicated with Mr. Hillman since August 29, 2013.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff now requests leave pursuant to FED. R. CIV.P. 15 to file her

Second Amended Complaint.

Date: September 3, 2013 Respectfully Submitted,
