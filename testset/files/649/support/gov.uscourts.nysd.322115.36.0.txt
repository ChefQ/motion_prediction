INTRODUCTION
The principal allegation made by Plaintiffs Cintas Corporation and its three related
corporate entities (collectively “Cintas”) in this lawsuit is that Defendants are committing the
felony crime of “attempted extortion”—and thus violating the federal RICO statute—by the
following course of conduct: engaging in a negative publicity and boycott campaign, comprised
of disparaging commentary on Cintas and free speech appeals to independent third parties not to
deal with Cintas, that puts pressure on Cintas, through fear of economic loss, to enter into a
lawful card check and neutrality agreement with Defendants UNITE HERE and the Teamsters.
And, Cintas further alleges that Defendant UNITE HERE, by using an Internet website titled
“CintasExposed.org” as one means of disseminating its anti-Cintas message and making its
boycott appeals to independent third parties, also is violating the federal Lanham Act.
As we show in this Memorandum, Cintas’ RICO and Lanham Act claims fail as a matter
of law both on pure statutory interpretation grounds, and on the independent ground that the First
Amendment and the federal labor laws stand as bars to those claims. At bottom, this
RICO/Lanham Act lawsuit by Cintas is an effort to gain the upper hand in a longstanding labor
dispute between the parties by negating Defendants’ right under the First Amendment and the
federal labor laws to further their interests in that labor dispute by engaging in a negative
publicity and boycott campaign against Cintas. That, we submit, is a misuse of RICO and the
Lanham Act, which calls for a dismissal of Cintas’ federal claims under Rule 12(b)(6) and a
refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cintas’ pendent state law claims.

-2ARGUMENT
I.

EACH OF THE RICO COUNTS IN CINTAS’ COMPLAINT (Counts One-Four)
FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM ON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED.
An essential element of any claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt

Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961 et seq., is that the defendant has engaged, or
conspired to engage, in a “pattern of racketeering activity,” see 18 U.S.C. § 1962. In this regard,
“‘racketeering activity’ means” the felony crimes enumerated in RICO, see 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(1)—commonly referred to as RICO “predicate acts.”
As we show, taking the factual allegations in Cintas’ Complaint as true for purposes of
this Rule 12(b)(6) motion, those factual allegations do not as a matter of law make out a claim
that Defendants have committed even a single RICO predicate act—much less the required
“pattern” of RICO predicate acts. Accordingly, Cintas’ four putative RICO claims against
Defendants, see Cplt. ¶¶ 263-77, fail at the most basic level and should be dismissed.
All four of Cintas’ RICO claims rest on the allegation that Defendants are committing the
RICO predicate act of “attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act[ ],” Cplt. ¶¶ 265, 268, 271, 276,
by engaging in a “negative public relations campaign against Cintas,” id. ¶ 232—which includes
as “a key component” free speech appeals to independent third parties to boycott Cintas products
and services, id. ¶¶ 98-99—with the ultimate objective of putting Cintas in such “fear of
economic loss” as to apply “pressure” on Cintas to “enter into a card check and neutrality
agreement with Defendants UNITE HERE and the Teamsters,” id. ¶ 8-9, 97. 1 Or, as Cintas’
counsel put it at the May 27 pre-motion conference, “our allegation is that there was a fear of
1

In addition, Cintas alleges that—by this same conduct—Defendants also are committing the
RICO predicate acts of (i) using the facilities of interstate commerce to commit extortion in
violation of the Travel Act; and (ii) “extortion and attempted extortion” under Ohio law. See
Cplt. ¶¶ 265, 268, 271, 276. As we show infra pp. 22-23, under Scheidler v. NOW, Inc., 537
U.S. 393 (2003), these additional allegations cannot salvage Cintas’ RICO claims.

-3economic injury or loss associated with the defendant’s conduct . . ., [a]nd quite simply . . .
defendants . . . are attempting to quite directly and frankly force Cintas into agreeing to what’s
referred to as card check neutrality.” Transcript at 16. There is no allegation in this case that
Defendants engaged in any force or violence or threats of force or violence.
To be specific, the “extortionate” means alleged by Cintas is Defendants’ conduct of a
negative publicity and boycott campaign consisting primarily of: (i) “almost daily publication of
misleading, negative and/or damaging information about Cintas to countless third parties,” Cplt.
¶ 93 (emphasis added); (ii) “reaching out” to Cintas’ customers “in an attempt to convince them
that they are ‘getting ripped off disproportionately’ by Cintas,” id. ¶ 98; (iii) “communicat[ing]
disparaging information about Cintas to Cintas’s stakeholders by mailing and faxing letters and
flyers containing misleading and/or negative statements about Cintas, distributing newsletters,
posting press releases, creating web pages and sending anti-Cintas letters to investors and stock
analysts,” id. ¶ 102 (emphasis added); (iv) “us[ing] the Internet to publish and circulate
misleading, disparaging and/or negative information about Cintas and its business practices to,
among others, Cintas’s employees, customers, shareholders, and the general public,” id. ¶ 110
(emphasis added), including the use of a “Cintas Exposed website . . . specifically designed to
encourage consumers and other companies not to conduct business with Cintas,” id. ¶ 112; (v)
“attend[ing] NASCAR races to distribute anti-Cintas literature and to encourage NASCAR fans
to ‘tell us why you think NASCAR should give Cintas the boot,’” id. ¶ 147; and (vi) maintaining
“yet another anti-Cintas website” that “disseminate[s] negative information about Cintas to
NASCAR fans” in “support [of]” Defendant UNITE HERE’s “assertion that ‘Cintas doesn’t
deserve such a profitable partnership with NASCAR,’” id. ¶¶ 148-49.

-4Given Cintas’ allegations, we note at the outset (and discuss more fully infra pp. 14-18)
that under controlling Second Circuit case law, union “campaign[s] of public criticism” and
associated “boycott” activities of this kind—directed at a business for the purpose of exerting
“pressure” on that business to take action to “resolve [a labor] dispute” in a lawful manner—“are
constitutionally protected.” See Metropolitan Opera Ass’n v. Local 100, HERE, 239 F.3d 172,
174-75, 177-78 (2d Cir. 2001).
To be equally specific about Defendants’ alleged “extortionate” objective, a “card check
and neutrality agreement” (an example of which is attached to Cintas’ Complaint as Exhibit 9)
sets out the essentials of a “process”—separate from “the traditional NLRB election process”—
to govern an employer’s response to a union’s effort “to organize [the employer’s] workers” and
to become the workers’ legally-recognized exclusive bargaining representative. Metropolitan
Opera, 239 F.3d at 174. The employer makes two commitments in such an agreement: (1) “to
remain neutral by not hiring ‘union busters’ or speaking against the [u]nion”; and (2) to
determine the position of its employees on union representation through a “card-check”
procedure—in lieu of insisting on an NLRB election procedure—and to accord legal recognition
to the union as the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative if in the “card-check”
procedure an employee majority “vot[es] in favor of unionization.” Id.2
Given Cintas’ allegations, we also note at the outset (and discuss more fully infra pp. 5-8)
that under controlling Second Circuit case law, a card check and neutrality agreement is “a valid
contract governing representation . . . [that] make[s] the union recognition process less
2

To be precise, “[i]n a card check procedure, employees are given cards asking them to
designate the union as their bargaining representative. If a majority of the employees sign and
return the cards, the union becomes the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative. . . .
Typically, the cards are distributed and collected by the union without the employer’s assistance.
They are then “checked” for authenticity by a neutral party.” HERE, Local 2 v. Marriott Corp.,
961 F.2d 1464, 1466 n.1 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal citation omitted).

from a union organizing effort.” HERE, Local 217 v. J.P. Morgan Hotel, 996 F.2d 561, 566 (2d
Cir. 1993); accord e.g. HERE, Local 57 v. Sage Hosp. Res., 390 F.3d 206, 218-19 (3d Cir. 2004);

A.

Cintas’ Hobbs Act Claim Does Not Meet The Act’s “Wrongful[ness]”
Requirement Or Its Separate “Obtaining of Property” Requirement.

The Hobbs Act makes it a federal crime to interfere with commerce through “extortion”
or attempted “extortion,” and defines “extortion” as “the obtaining of property from another,
with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear . . . .”
18 U.S.C. § 1951 (emphasis added).
Given that, as noted above, Cintas’ Hobbs Act “attempted extortion” claim rests on the
allegation that Defendants are using means that are constitutionally protected to achieve an
objective that is lawful under the federal labor laws, it is not at all surprising that under
controlling Supreme Court and Second Circuit case law, Cintas’ Hobbs Act claim fails on two
separate statutory grounds: (1) it does not meet the Act’s “wrongful[ness]” requirement; and (2)
it does not meet the Act’s “obtaining of property” requirement.
1.

The “Wrongful[ness]” Requirement. In United States v. Enmons, 410

U.S. 396 (1973), the Supreme Court interpreted the word “wrongful” in the Hobbs Act phrase
“wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear” as “limit[ing] the statute’s
coverage to those instances where the obtaining of the property would itself be ‘wrongful’
because the alleged extortionist has no lawful claim to the property.” 410 U.S. at 400. On this
basis, the Enmons Court concluded that the Hobbs Act “does not apply to the use of force to
achieve legitimate labor ends.” Id. at 401 (emphasis added).

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

-6While Enmons involved the use of “force”—in that case, violence—“to achieve [the]
legitimate labor end[ ]” of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement providing “higher
wages in return for genuine services,” id. at 400, the Enmons Court went on to add that the
Hobbs Act was patterned on New York extortion law, under which—no matter how “militant”
the means used—“‘an accused would not be guilty of extortion for attempting to achieve
legitimate labor goals,’” broadly defined to include “‘the legitimate labor objective of
organization.’” 410 U.S. at 406 n.16 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). That being so,
Enmons repeatedly and unqualifiedly states that on a proper interpretation of the word
“wrongful” as used in the Hobbs Act, the Act does not reach the use of force to achieve
“legitimate union objectives,” id. at 400, or “legitimate labor ends,” id. at 401, and does not
encroach in any way on “the legitimate activities of labor unions,” id. at 406 n.16.
A card check and neutrality agreement is lawful under the Second Circuit’s controlling
decision in J.P. Morgan Hotel, 996 F.2d at 566—and thus is a “legitimate labor end[ ],” Enmons,
537 U.S. at 401. Under Enmons, then, an allegation that a labor union is using force to achieve a
lawful card check and neutrality agreement—if such an allegation were made—would fail to
state a Hobbs Act claim.3 Here, there is no allegation that Defendants are using force to achieve
a lawful card check and neutrality agreement. Rather, Cintas’ allegation is that Defendants are
3

A. Terzi Productions v. Theatrical Protective Union, 2 F. Supp. 2d 485 (S.D.N.Y. 1998),
in dictum, finds merit in the view that Enmons’ interpretation of the “wrongful[ness]”
requirement only applies to the use of force to achieve the legitimate labor objective of a lawful
collective bargaining agreement, and does not apply to the use of force to achieve other
legitimate labor objectives. See id. at 505-06, 508. (A. Terzi Productions’ holding is that the
defendant union violated the Hobbs Act by making wrongful use of force to achieve an unlawful
labor objective: recognition of the union and a collective bargaining agreement where the union
did not represent the employees, see id. at 506-08.) As we have shown in text, the Enmons
decision, in its terms and its rationale, cuts exactly the opposite way from the dictum in A. Terzi
Productions. But we do not pursue this matter any more deeply here, because as we go on to
show in text, Cintas’ Hobbs Act claim in this “use of fear of economic loss” case fails without
regard to Enmons’ scope of application in “use of force” cases.

-7using “fear of economic loss,” Cplt. ¶ 8 (emphasis added), to achieve such a lawful agreement.
And, under Enmons and the Second Circuit’s reading of Enmons in United States v. Clemente,
640 F.2d 1069 (2d Cir. 1981), it is clear beyond any question that the use of “fear of economic
loss” to achieve a lawful card check and neutrality agreement is not “wrongful” under the Hobbs
Act, and that Cintas’ allegation thus fails to state a Hobbs Act claim.
The issue presented to the Second Circuit in Clemente was the applicability of the Hobbs
Act to cases involving the allegation that the defendant used “fear of economic loss” to obtain
property. 640 F.2d at 1076-78. In addressing this issue, the Clemente Court began by stating the
general principle, drawn from Enmons’ “teach[ings],” that the applicability of the Hobbs Act
depends on whether the statutorily identified means (“actual or
threatened force, violence, or fear”) have been put to “wrongful
use”, i.e., have been employed to obtain property to which “the
alleged extortionist has no lawful claim.” [Id. at 1076 (quoting
Enmons, 410 U.S. at 400 (emphasis added).]
In other words, said the Clemente Court, the applicability of the Hobbs Act turns, in the first
instance, on whether “the wrongfulness element of the crime of extortion” has been met. Id. at
1077 (emphasis added). And, the Clemente Court added that in determining whether “the
wrongfulness element” has been met, it is improper to assess wrongfulness “in a vacuum,
independent of” the means used by the defendant to obtain the alleged extortion victim’s
property. Id. That is so because “[i]t is obvious that the use of fear of financial injury is not
inherently wrongful.” Id.
Given these considerations, the Clemente Court squarely held that in a Hobbs Act case
involving the allegation that the defendant used “fear of economic loss”—and not “force”—to
obtain property, the Act’s wrongfulness element is satisfied only when such fear is used “to
achieve a wrongful purpose,” and not when it is used “‘to obtain legitimate economic ends.’” Id.
(emphasis added) (quoting the trial court’s jury instruction with approval).

-8The Third Circuit, in a decision expressly “adopt[ing]” the “position” taken by the
Second Circuit in Clemente, put the point this way:
Unlike the use or threatened use of force or violence, the use of
economic fear in business negotiations between private parties is
not “inherently” wrongful. Indeed, the fear of economic loss is a
driving force of our economy that plays an important role in many
legitimate business transactions. This economic reality leads us to
conclude that the reach of the Hobbs Act is limited in cases, such
as this one, which involve the use of economic fear in a transaction
between two private parties. The limitation we apply is that set
forth in Enmons: that a defendant is not guilty of extortion if he
has a lawful claim to the property obtained.
Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 523, 524 (3d Cir. 1998); see
also e.g. Viacom Int’l v. Icahn, 747 F. Supp. 205, 211, 213 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (the defendant’s use
of “greenmail” tactics to induce the plaintiff to part with valuable consideration out of economic
fear of a takeover attempt does not constitute Hobbs Act “extortion,” because “in an extortion
scenario the alleged victim has a pre-existing entitlement to pursue his business interests free of
the [economic] fear” being generated by the defendant, and a business “does not have a preexisting right to be free from the problems and fears of a takeover threat”), aff’d on other
grounds, 946 F.2d 998 (2d Cir. 1991).
The alleged purpose of Defendants’ “attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act[ ]” in this
case is not “a wrongful purpose” under the law, but rather the wholly “legitimate” purpose,
Clemente, 640 F.2d at 1077, of “achiev[ing] [the] legitimate labor end[ ],” Enmons, 410 U.S. at
401, of a card check and neutrality agreement lawful under J.P. Morgan Hotel, 996 F.2d at 566.
That being so, Cintas’ claim that Defendants are committing the RICO predicate act of Hobbs
Act “attempted extortion” by using fear of economic loss to pressure Cintas to enter into a lawful
card check and neutrality agreement, fails at its inception under Enmons and Clemente.

The “Obtaining of Property” Requirement. Cintas’ Hobbs Act “attempted

extortion” claim fails on a separate and independent statutory ground as well: on a
straightforward application of the Supreme Court’s decision in Scheidler v. NOW, Inc., 537 U.S.
393 (2003), and the Second Circuit’s reading of Scheidler in United States v. Gotti, 459 F.3d 296
(2d Cir. 2006), that claim does not meet the Hobbs Act’s “obtaining of property” requirement.
(a)

In Scheidler, the defendant abortion protestors used force to

“interfere[ ] with, and in some instances completely disrupt[ ], the ability of the [plaintiff
abortion] clinics to function.” 537 U.S. at 401. The clinics argued that this conduct amounted to
RICO Hobbs Act extortion on the following legal theory: by using force to deprive the clinics of
the clinics’ right to exclusive control of their businesses and of how to use their business assets,
the defendants had “obtained” the clinics’ asserted “intangible” property right “to exercise
exclusive control over the use of [the clinics’] business assets.” Id. at 401-02.
The Supreme Court squarely rejected this legal theory. The Court—after assuming
without deciding that “something as intangible” as the right “to exercise exclusive control over
the use of a party’s business assets” could qualify as “property” under the Hobbs Act, id. at
402—then stated: “Whatever the outer boundaries [‘of extortion liability under the Hobbs Act’]
may be, the effort to characterize [defendants’] actions here as an ‘obtaining of property from’
[plaintiffs] is well beyond them.” Id. (emphasis added). The Court elaborated, in the decisive
paragraph of its opinion:
There is no dispute in these cases that [defendants] interfered with,
disrupted, and in some instances completely deprived [plaintiffs]
of their ability to exercise their property rights. . . . But . . . their
acts of interference and disruption . . . did not constitute extortion
because [defendants] did not “obtain” respondents’ property.
[Defendants] may have deprived or sought to deprive [plaintiffs] of
their alleged property right of exclusive control of their business
assets, but they did not acquire any such property. [Defendants]

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Page 16 of 46

- 10 neither pursued nor received “something of value from” [plaintiffs]
that they could exercise, transfer, or sell.” [Id. at 404-05
(emphasis added) (citation omitted).]
“To conclude that such actions constituted extortion,” the Court held, “would effectively discard
the statutory requirement that property must be obtained from another, replacing it instead with
the notion that merely interfering with or depriving someone of property is sufficient to
constitute extortion.” Id. at 405 (emphasis added).
In Gotti, the Second Circuit made two points about Scheidler: First, Scheidler “did not
overturn [United States v. Tropiano, 418 F.2d 1069 (2d Cir. 1969)’s] broad interpretation of the
Hobbs Act’s reference to ‘property,’ nor otherwise suggest that only tangible property rights can
be extorted under the Hobbs Act.” 459 F.3d at 323. Second, Scheidler “tighten[ed] the
‘obtaining’ requirement of the Hobbs Act” by holding that that requirement entails “both a
deprivation and an acquisition of property.” Id. (emphasis added). In the latter regard, said the
Gotti Court, the Scheidler Court’s “explanation” as to “why the [defendant] anti-abortion
protestors could not be viewed as having acquired [the plaintiff abortion clinics’] property,” id.,
leads to the conclusion that the “obtaining of property” requirement test is whether the alleged
extortionists are “seeking simply to deprive someone of a right,” or are seeking in addition to
“do[ ] [something] affirmative with that right themselves,” id. at 323-24.
Gotti therefore “hold[s]” that “in evaluating an extortion count’s conformity with”
Scheidler—“i.e., whether it adequately alleges the ‘obtaining of property’ for purposes of the
Hobbs Act’s definition of extortion—the key inquiry is whether the defendant is (1) alleged to
have carried out (or, in the case of attempted extortion, attempted to carry out) the deprivation of
a property right from another, with (2) the intent to exercise, sell, transfer, or take some other
analogous action with respect to that right.” Id. at 324.

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Page 17 of 46

- 11 The Government’s proof in support of the extortion and attempted extortion counts
upheld in Gotti clearly satisfied this legal standard. For example, on “[t]he ILA Counts,” the
defendants seized and “exercised” control over the internal affairs of the International
Longshoreman’s Association (“ILA”), “first by using force to determine ‘who filled various
International Executive Officer and other ILA positions’ in order to ‘ensure that organized crime
associates would be placed in these positions,’ and then by directing the activities of those officeholders.” Id. at 302. On “[t]he Alayev Counts,” the defendants seized and exercised physical
control over part of a restaurant’s operations, by “install[ing]” gambling machines in the
restaurant against the owner’s will, “collect[ing] money from th[ose] machines” which the
defendants kept for themselves, and eventually forcing a sale of the restaurant from which one of
the defendants “ended up taking a portion of” the proceeds. Id. at 313-14. And, on “[t]he Seagal
Counts,” the defendants through threats of force sought to have an actor pay them money and
provide them his acting services. Id. at 314-15.
(b)

Cintas’ Complaint alleges that the “extortion[ate]” objective of

Defendants’ negative publicity and boycott campaign is to pressure Cintas to “enter into a card
check and neutrality agreement.” Cplt. ¶ 9. Given “Tropiano’s broad interpretation of the
Hobbs Act’s reference to ‘property,’” Gotti, 459 F.3d at 323, we assume for purposes of analysis
that the intangible employer rights affected by a card check and neutrality agreement qualify as
“property” under the Hobbs Act. Granting Cintas that much for present purposes, it is plain that
Defendants are not seeking to obtain any such property from Cintas, and that Cintas’ “attempted
extortion” claim fails on that basis.
Here, as in Scheidler, the sum and substance of the plaintiff’s allegation is that the
defendants are using coercive pressure “to dictate and restrict [the plaintiff’s business] actions

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 18 of 46

- 12 and decisions.” Scheidler, 537 U.S. at 406. And, Scheidler squarely holds that coercive conduct
by a defendant “to restrict another’s freedom of action” is not “extortion.” Id. at 405.
Specifically, Cintas’ allegation is that Defendants are using fear of economic loss “to
dictate and restrict [Cintas’] actions and decisions,” id. at 406, respecting whether (1) to exercise
its employer right to oppose unionization, rather than be neutral on unionization; and (2) to
exercise its employer right to refuse to agree to a card check procedure and to insist on an
alternative NLRB election procedure for determining a union claim of majority status. For
Hobbs Act “obtaining of property” purposes, that allegation is no different in kind from the
plaintiff abortion clinics’ complaint in Scheidler that the defendant anti-abortion protestors used
force “to dictate and restrict the [clinics’] actions and decisions” respecting whether to exercise
their right to continue performing abortions, rather than to cease performing abortions.
Here, as in Scheidler, on plaintiff’s allegations it fairly can be said that the defendants are
seeking to deprive the plaintiff of its “alleged property right[s],” 537 U.S. at 405, i.e., to deprive
Cintas of (1) its employer right to oppose, rather than be neutral on, unionization; and (2) its
employer right to refuse to agree to a card check procedure, and to insist instead on an NLRB
election procedure, for determining a union claim of majority status. And here, as in Scheidler, it
fairly can be said that the defendants seek a benefit that may ultimately result from that
deprivation. Given the employer’s control over his employees’ working lives, an employer
campaign against unionization and, as part of such a campaign, an employer refusal to agree to a
card check procedure and to insist on a union-employer contest through an NLRB election
procedure, stand as major obstacles to the exercise by employees of their right to form and join a
union that is engaged in an organizing campaign.

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

- 13 But here, as in Scheidler, it cannot fairly be said that the defendants are seeking to
“acquire any such property,” 537 U.S. at 405 (emphasis added), i.e., that the defendants are
seeking to “deprive[ ] [the plaintiff] of [its asserted intangible] property right[s] . . . with . . . the
intent to exercise, sell, transfer, or take some other analogous action with respect to th[ose]
right[s].” Gotti, 459 F.3d at 324. The Defendant unions in this case quite obviously are not
seeking to acquire and exercise for themselves Cintas’ right to oppose unionization, or Cintas’
right to refuse a card check procedure and to insist on an NLRB election procedure. And, neither
the Defendant unions nor Cintas would acquire any property right (intangible or otherwise) from
the other. As the Second Circuit explained in J.P. Morgan Hotel, supra, through a card check
and neutrality agreement, each party
g[i]ve[s] up rights under the [National Labor Relations] Act . . . in
an effort to make the union recognition process less burdensome
for both . . . [and] to resolve peacefully those tensions inevitably
flowing from a union organizing effort. [996 F.2d at 566
(emphasis added); see also Cplt., Exh. 9.]
In this regard, a card check and neutrality agreement is the exact analogue to an
agreement between two parties to determine a breach of contract claim, or any other legal claim,
through arbitration rather than through judicial or administrative proceedings. As the Third
Circuit aptly put the point in Sage Hospitality, supra:
The fact that a [Card Check and] Neutrality Agreement—like any
other labor arbitration agreement—benefits both parties with
efficiency and cost saving does not transform it into a payment or
delivery of some benefit. Furthermore, any benefit to the union
inherent in a more efficient resolution of recognition disputes does
not constitute a ‘thing of value’ within the meaning of the statute [,
29 U.S.C. § 186, enacted by Congress “to address bribery,
extortion and other corrupt practices” in labor-management
relations]. [390 F.3d at 219 (emphasis added).]
The critical point is that a card check and neutrality agreement is not an employer grant to the
union of the status of an exclusive bargaining representative; rather, it is an agreement for a

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 20 of 46

- 14 process by which the employees will determine for themselves whether to grant the union that
status. Supra p. 4.
In short, Cintas’ allegation that Defendants are seeking to pressure Cintas to enter into a
card check and neutrality agreement does not, under the legal standard established in Scheidler
and fleshed out in Gotti, constitute a legally sufficient allegation that Defendants are seeking to
“obtain” Cintas’ asserted intangible property rights within the meaning of the Hobbs Act.
B.

Cintas’ Hobbs Act Claim Also Fails On Independent First Amendment And
Federal Labor Law Grounds.

As we have shown, Cintas’ Hobbs Act “attempted extortion” claim fails on pure statutory
interpretation grounds. As we now show, Cintas’ claim also fails on the further ground that the
First Amendment and the federal labor laws stand as bars to that claim.
1.

The First Amendment. Cintas’ RICO claim is that the Hobbs Act makes

it the felony crime of “attempted extortion” for a union to engage in a negative publicity and
boycott campaign—comprised of disparaging commentary on an employer and free speech
appeals to independent third parties not to deal with the employer—that puts pressure on the
employer, through fear of economic loss, to enter into a lawful card check and neutrality
agreement with the union. The First Amendment stands as a bar to that RICO Hobbs Act claim,
as the pertinent Supreme Court case law and the Second Circuit’s decision in Metropolitan
Opera, supra, 239 F.3d 172, applying that case law make abundantly clear.
It is settled law that labor unions—in common with, for example, civil rights,
environmental and anti-abortion organizations—have a First Amendment right to publicize their
objections to a company’s business practices, and to urge independent third parties to boycott
that company, as a means of pressuring the company to make lawful changes in its business
practices. As Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 102 (1940) states, “the dissemination of

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 21 of 46

- 15 information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within the area of free
discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution.” And, that is so where the information is
intended to and “may persuade some of those reached to refrain from entering into advantageous
relations with the business establishment which is the scene of the dispute.” Id. at 104.
The Second Circuit’s decision in Metropolitan Opera, supra, 239 F.3d 172, could not be
clearer in this regard. In that case, the defendant Union was seeking a lawful card check and
neutrality agreement from Restaurant Associates, a food services vendor. In that connection, the
Union initiated “a campaign of public criticism” and associated “boycott” activities directed at
the Metropolitan Opera (“Met”)—which had contracted with Restaurant Associates to provide
food services at the Met—designed to “pressure” the Met “to help resolve [the] dispute” with
Restaurant Associates over the card check and neutrality agreement “in the Union’s favor.” Id.
at 174-75, 177. The Met, citing its status as a neutral third party to the underlying labor dispute,
sought and secured a district court injunction against the Union’s campaign. The Second Circuit,
in recognition that “the Supreme Court has expressly afforded a special breadth of protection
[under the First Amendment] to union speech that publicizes labor conflicts,” id. at 177,
dissolved the injunction, and in so doing emphasized:
[W]e do not ascribe any particular significance to the district
court’s finding that the Union was motivated to coerce the Met
through social pressure and the threat of social ostracism. The
district court found the Union’s actions to be “harassing” and
“threatening” when the Union warned of “repercussions” against
those who did not join its boycott. Such “repercussions” included,
for example, follow-up leafleting condemning [another neutral
employer] for refusing to join. Especially within the labor context,
in seeking to exert social pressure on the Met, the Union’s methods
may be harassing, upsetting, or coercive, but unless we are to
depart from settled First Amendment principles, they are
constitutionally protected.
See e.g., NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 909-11 (1982) . . .; Organization for
a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419 (1971). [Id. at 177-78.]

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 22 of 46

- 16 In the cited portion of the Keefe decision, the Supreme Court had stated: “[t]he claim that
the expressions were intended to exercise a coercive impact on respondent does not remove them
from the reach of the First Amendment. Petitioners plainly intended to influence respondent’s
conduct by their activities; this is not fundamentally different from the function of a newspaper.”
And, in the cited portion of its Claiborne Hardware decision, the Supreme Court had reaffirmed
this core First Amendment principle. See also Beverly Hills Foodland v. UFCW, Local 655, 39
F.3d 191, 197 (8th Cir. 1994) (under Keefe and Claiborne Hardware, “the prime directive in the
Union [organizing] campaign, a boycott of [the target employer], is . . . constitutionally
safeguarded,” as is the accompanying “activity of peaceful pamphleteering”).
Metropolitan Opera’s holding that a union negative publicity and boycott campaign that
puts pressure on a neutral third party to have that party help resolve a labor dispute generated by
the union’s effort to secure a lawful card check and neutrality agreement from a primary
employer is “constitutionally protected” entails the following conclusion: Defendants’ negative
publicity and boycott campaign against Cintas that puts pressure on Cintas—the primary
employer—to resolve a labor dispute by entering into a lawful card check and neutrality
agreement, is “constitutionally protected.”
And, the conclusion that Defendants’ negative publicity and boycott campaign against
Cintas is “constitutionally protected,” in its turn, entails the further conclusion that the First
Amendment stands as a bar to Cintas’ RICO Hobbs Act claim in this case. It goes without
saying that Congress has no power to restrict—much less to criminalize—the exercise of
“constitutionally protected” First Amendment rights. In other words, if the Hobbs Act plausibly
could be construed to apply in the circumstances alleged by Cintas here—which we have shown
it cannot be, see supra pp. 5-14—the Hobbs Act would be unconstitutional as so applied.

- 17 At an irreducible minimum, applying the Hobbs Act as Cintas would have it apply here
would raise “serious constitutional problems.” Clearing House Ass’n v. Cuomo, 510 F.3d 105,
113 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Accordingly, “the doctrine of
constitutional avoidance,” id., dictates that the Hobbs Act be construed not to apply here. That is
the teaching of DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S.
568 (1988), the leading labor law “constitutional avoidance” case.
The issue in DeBartolo was whether the respondent union violated § 8(b)(4) of the
National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) by “distributing handbills” urging “a consumer
boycott” of a shopping mall in order to pressure the mall owner and its tenants to use “their
influence” to help resolve a “primary labor dispute” with a mall construction contractor in the
union’s favor. 485 U.S. at 570-71. The Supreme Court reversed the NLRB’s finding that the
union’s consumer boycott handbilling violated § 8(b)(4), on the ground that “the Board’s
construction of the statute, as applied in this case, poses serious questions of the validity of
§ 8(b)(4) under the First Amendment.” Id. at 575. And, the Court explained that it had applied
the constitutional avoidance doctrine to reach a similar result in “several” other labor cases:
In NLRB v. Drivers, 362 U.S. 274, 284 (1960), for example, the
Court rejected the Board’s interpretation of the phrase “restrain or
coerce” [in § 8(b)(4)] to include peaceful recognitional picketing . .
. . Similarly, in NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U.S. 58, 63 (1964)
(Tree Fruits), we disagreed with the Board’s determination that §
8(b)(4)(ii)(B) prohibited all consumer picketing at a secondary
establishment, . . . [based, inter alia, on the] concern that a broad
ban against peaceful picketing might collide with the guarantees of
the First Amendment. [485 U.S. at 577-78.]
Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127 (1961), the
leading Supreme Court “constitutional avoidance” case outside the labor law context, is precisely
to the same effect. The issue in Noerr was whether the defendant railroads violated the Sherman
Act by “conduct[ing] a publicity campaign against the [plaintiff] truckers designed to foster the

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 24 of 46

- 18 adoption and retention of laws and law enforcement practices destructive of the trucking
business, to create an atmosphere of distaste for the truckers among the general public, and to
impair the relationships existing between the truckers and their customers.” Id. at 129. In
holding that the railroads’ publicity campaign did not violate the Sherman Act, the Court
emphasized that a contrary construction of the Act “would raise important constitutional
questions. The right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, and we
cannot, of course, lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms.” Id. at 138.
In short, given the constitutional protection afforded Defendants’ negative publicity and
boycott campaign against Cintas, acceptance of Cintas’ claim that the Hobbs Act is to be read to
criminalize such a campaign would “pose[ ] serious”—indeed, unanswerable—“questions of the
[constitutional] validity of [the Hobbs Act] . . . [‘as applied in this case’].” DeBartolo, 485 U.S.
at 575. For that constitutional reason—in addition to the separate statutory reasons given in the
Enmons/Clemente and Scheidler/Gotti decisions, respectively—Cintas “cannot use the [Hobbs
Act and RICO] either as a shield [against Defendants’ campaign], or as a sword to [kill that
campaign].” Cf. Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer, 403 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2005) (discussed
infra pp. 24-26, in the context of our showing that the First Amendment also stands as a bar to
Cintas’ Lanham Act claims in this case).
2. The Federal Labor Laws. The same conclusion follows from the
federal labor law principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377
U.S. 252 (1964) and Machinists v. Wisconsin Empl. Rel. Comm’n, 427 U.S. 132 (1976).
Morton raised the question of whether “the Ohio law of secondary boycott can be applied
to proscribe the same type of conduct which Congress focused upon but did not proscribe when
it enacted [the federal labor law’s secondary boycott provisions].” 377 U.S. at 259-60. The

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 25 of 46

- 19 Court answered that question “no.” It did so where the Ohio law had been applied to proscribe
the defendant union’s “request to [a neutral employer’s] management to cease doing business
with [the employer with whom the union had a labor dispute,]” and on the following ground:
[A] union is free to approach [a neutral] employer to persuade him
to engage in a boycott [of a primary employer], so long as it
refrains from the specifically prohibited means of coercion through
inducement of employees. . . . This weapon of self-help, permitted
by federal law, formed an integral part of the [union’s] effort to
achieve its bargaining goals during negotiations with the [primary
employer]. Allowing its use is a part of the balance struck by
Congress between the conflicting interests of the union, the
employees, the employer and the community. . . . [T]he inevitable
result [of applying the Ohio secondary boycott law] would be to
frustrate the congressional determination to leave this weapon of
self-help available, and to upset the balance of power between
labor and management expressed in our national labor policy. . . .
We hold, therefore, that the damages awarded against the [union]
based upon its peaceful persuasion of [the neutral employer’s]
management not to do business with the [primary employer]
during the strike cannot stand. [Id. (internal quotations and
citations omitted).]
As the Court added in Machinists, in invalidating a state labor board order enjoining “a
union and its members from continuing to refuse to work overtime pursuant to a union policy to
put economic pressure on the employer in negotiations for renewal of an expired collectivebargaining agreement,” 427 U.S. at 133: “Central to Morton’s analysis was the observation that
in selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited, Congress struck the balance
between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests.”
Id. at 146 (internal quotations and ellipsis omitted). It follows, said the Court, that “[t]o sanction
state regulation of such economic pressure deemed by the federal Act desirably left for the free
play of contending economic forces is not merely to fill a gap by outlawing what federal law
fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him
to have available.” Id. at 150 (internal quotations, brackets and ellipsis omitted).

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

- 20 Morton and Machinists hold, in terms, that state laws cannot be applied to “regulat[e] . . .
economic pressure [devices] deemed by the federal [labor] Act desirably left for the free play of
contending economic forces.” Machinists, 427 U.S. at 150. Their rationale, however, goes
further and provides that general federal laws, like the Hobbs Act and RICO, cannot be applied
to regulate through criminal and civil sanctions the economic pressure device at issue here—i.e.,
a negative publicity and boycott campaign, through free speech appeals to independent third
parties, to pressure Cintas to resolve a labor dispute in the Defendant unions’ favor. For, like the
application of the Ohio secondary boycott law to the union pressure device at issue in Morton—
i.e., a union request to a neutral employer to cease doing business with a primary employer to put
pressure on the latter to resolve a labor dispute in the union’s favor—the application of the
Hobbs Act and RICO to the union pressure device of the same kind at issue here “is not merely
to fill a gap by outlawing what federal [labor] law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an
economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available.” Id.
As the Third Circuit put the point in concluding that a card check and neutrality
agreement does not violate the general prohibitions of § 302 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 186:
Issues of labor-unit recognition and bargaining are
comprehensively regulated by the NLRA. Courts have repeatedly
upheld labor-management agreements providing for arbitration
over recognition disputes. Sage’s interpretation of section 302
would wreak havoc on the carefully balanced structure of the laws
governing recognition of and bargaining with unions. [Sage
Hospitality, supra, 390 F.3d at 219.]
See also United States v. DeLaurentis, 491 F.2d 208, 213-14 (2d Cir. 1974) (“Congress has paid
a great deal of attention to its enactments in the labor field,” and against that background, it
cannot be concluded that Congress, in a civil rights statute of general applicability, “silently
import[ed] sweeping criminal liability into the regulation of labor relations.”).

- 21 To be sure, Cintas does allege that Defendants in carrying out their negative publicity and
boycott campaign against Cintas have, in a handful of instances, either “defam[ed]” Cintas or
committed other “tort[s].” See Cplt. ¶¶ 8, 205-19. To put the matter in perspective, however,
while Cintas alleges that Defendants have since “early 2003,” id. ¶ 88, engaged in the “almost
daily publication of misleading, negative and/or damaging information about Cintas to countless
third parties,” id. ¶ 93 (emphasis added), Cintas’ Complaint contains a single state law
defamation Count based on a single press release, see id. ¶¶ 334-341. Defendants deny the
allegations of defamatory speech and other “tort[s],” but for present purposes it suffices to point
out that the law provides for remedies designed specifically to deal with any such torts
committed by Defendants. See e.g. Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U.S. 53 (1966).
What the law manifestly does not provide for is Cintas’ effort to press the Hobbs Act
(and, by extension, RICO) into service as a means of preventing Defendants from continuing a
negative publicity and boycott campaign against Cintas that—aside from any defamations or
other torts that may have been committed in the course of that campaign—is protected by the
First Amendment and lawful under the federal labor laws. For the mere fact that isolated torts,
remediable under state law, may have been committed in the course of an otherwise lawful
negative publicity and boycott campaign entitled to constitutional protection cannot somehow
transmute that campaign into an entirely unlawful campaign—much less into an “extortionate”
campaign violative of the Hobbs Act and RICO. Compare Noerr, supra, 365 U.S. at 140-41
(that the defendant railroads have engaged in certain “decept[ive]” and “unethical” practices
during the course of their otherwise constitutionally protected “publicity campaign” against the

the category of political activity”).
C.

Cintas’ Travel Act and “State Law Extortion” Allegations Cannot Salvage
Its Rico Claims.

Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Scheidler, our showing that the conduct alleged
by Cintas here does not as a matter of law constitute the RICO predicate act of Hobbs Act
“attempted extortion”—and, indeed, could not be found to constitute “attempted extortion” under
the Hobbs Act consistent with the First Amendment and the federal labor laws—brings down
Cintas’ claim that this same conduct constitutes the RICO predicate acts of (i) using the facilities
of interstate commerce to commit extortion in violation of the Travel Act; and (ii) “extortion and
attempted extortion” under Ohio law. See supra p.2 n.1.
In Scheidler, the Court held that “for a state offense to be an ‘act or threat involving . . .
extortion, . . . which is chargeable under State law,’ as RICO requires, . . . the conduct must be
capable of being generically classified as extortionate.” 537 U.S. at 409. And, the Court
adopted for this purpose the following generic definition of extortion that had been adopted by
the Court for Travel Act purposes in United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286 (1969): “obtaining
something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or
threats.” Scheidler, 537 U.S. at 410. That generic definition of extortion—which includes both
the “wrongful[ness]” requirement and the “obtaining” requirement—is for present purposes
indistinguishable from the Hobbs Act definition of extortion. Accordingly, the words of the
Scheidler Court respecting the state law and Travel Act claims asserted as RICO predicate
crimes in that case are squarely applicable here:
Because petitioners did not [“as the Hobbs Act requires”] obtain or
attempt to obtain respondents’ property, both the state extortion
claims and the claim of attempting or conspiring to commit state
extortion were fatally flawed [“for RICO purposes.”] The 23

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 29 of 46

- 23 violations of the Travel Act and 23 acts of attempting to violate the
Travel Act also fail. These acts were committed in furtherance of
allegedly extortionate conduct. But we have already determined
that petitioners did not commit or attempt to commit extortion.
[537 U.S. at 410.]
And, of course, on the same analysis, Cintas’ failure to meet the Hobbs Act’s
“wrongful[ness]” requirement is an independent fatal flaw in Cintas’ attempt to base its RICO
claims on the predicate crimes of state law extortion and the Travel Act.
II.

EACH OF THE LANHAM ACT COUNTS (Counts Six Through Nine) FAILS TO
STATE A CLAIM ON WHICH RELIEF MAY BE GRANTED.
Cintas asserts four Lanham Act claims: trademark infringement in violation of 15 U.S.C.

§ 1114(a) (Count 6); trademark dilution in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c) (Count 7); unfair
competition in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1) (Count 8); and cybersquatting in violation of
15 U.S.C. § 1125(d) (Count 9). These counts are based on the following allegations:
To carry out its “negative public relations campaign against Cintas” (the “Uniform
Justice” campaign), in December 2002 defendants UNITE HERE, Unger, and Antonowicz
(collectively “UNITE HERE”) established three websites by registering three “CintasExposed”
Internet addresses, or “domain names”; the site principally used in the campaign bears an “.org”
suffix; the other two bear “.com” and “.net” suffixes respectively. Cplt. ¶¶ 232-36.
The CintasExposed.org site is devoted entirely to criticism of Cintas and its business
practices; the site itself neither offers for sale any goods or services nor solicits contributions
from the public or union members. Id. ¶ 240. Immediately upon entering the CintasExposed.org
website, a visitor is “informed that the website purports to be ‘an independent source of
consumer information from UNITE HERE.’” Id. ¶ 238. An exhibit attached to the Complaint,
which is properly treated as part of the Complaint for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, see I. Meyer
Pincus & Assocs. v. Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., 936 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir.1991), establishes that

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 30 of 46

- 24 this identification of UNITE HERE as the source of the information is prominent, appearing at
the top of the CintasExposed.org home page. See Cplt., Exh. 27. Cintas’ own official website
bears the address “Cintas.com.” Id. ¶ 250.
On these allegations, all four Lanham Act counts are due to be dismissed under Rule
12(b)(6). Counts 6, 7 and 8 rest on Lanham Act provisions that make a person’s use of another’s
trademark actionable only where the person has made commercial use of the mark, and Counts 6,
7 and 8 fail to meet that basic statutory requirement. The Count 6 and 8 statutory provisions also
make a person’s use of another’s trademark actionable only where that use creates a “likelihood
of confusion,” and those Counts fail to meet that separate requirement as well. The Count 7 also
statutory provision makes a person’s use of another’s trademark actionable only where that use
“dilutes” the association between the mark and the mark owner’s goods or services, and Count 7
fails to meet that additional requirement. Finally, the Count 9 statutory provision makes the
registration of a domain name actionable only where the registrant (i) registered a name
identical, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of another’s trade name; and (ii) acted with a bad
faith intent to profit from the registration. Count 9 fails to meet both of those requirements.
A.

Counts Six, Seven And Eight Fail To Allege That UNITE HERE Made
“Commercial Use” Of Cintas’ Trademark

The Lanham Act provisions underlying Counts 6, 7 and 8 rest on a common statutory
requirement: that a person’s use of another’s trademark is actionable only where the person has
made commercial use of the mark—that is, where the person has used the owner’s mark to sell or
market goods or services, and has not merely used the owner’s mark to criticize the owner’s
goods or services. Counts 6, 7 and 8 fail to meet this basic requirement.
1.

We begin with Bosley Medical Institute, Inc. v. Kremer, 403 F.3d 672, 676

(9th Cir. 2005), the appellate decision most closely on point. In that case, Bosley, a physician

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 31 of 46

- 25 who operated his hair replacement practice under the trade name of “Bosley Medical,” brought
both a traditional “infringement” claim under § 1114(a) and a “dilution” claim under § 1125(c)
against a disgruntled former customer who created “BosleyMedical.com,” a website devoted to
criticism of Bosley Medical.
In rejecting the plaintiff’s claims, the court of appeals began by observing that § 1114(a)
contains a limiting clause that renders actionable only the use of another’s trademark “in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services,” and that §
1125(c) contains a limiting clause that renders actionable only the “commercial use in
commerce” of another’s mark. The court explained that, although the two limiting clauses
employ different verbal formulas, both express the same substantive concept: that only persons
who use a trademark owner’s mark to sell or market their own or a third party’s goods or
services—and not those who use the owner’s mark solely to engage in commentary or criticism
about the mark owner—are within the statute’s reach. 403 F.3d at 678-79. See also id. at 676
(“the term ‘commercial use in commerce’ is … roughly analogous to the ‘in connection with’
sale of goods and services requirement of the infringement statute”). On this basis, the court
held that the defendant had made no “commercial use” of the mark, because he had used Bosley
Medical’s mark solely to criticize the company. Id. at 678.
The Bosley Medical court added that it was untenable to read the “in connection with”
clause of § 1114(a) to reach persons who use a mark only in connection with the trademark
owner’s goods or services. Doing so would stretch § 1114(a) to “encompass almost all uses of a
registered trademark, even when the mark is merely being used to identify the object of
consumer criticism,” and according the provision such a broad reach “is supported by neither the
text of the statute nor the history of trademark laws in this country.” Id. at 679. Those laws, the

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

- 26 court explained, were adopted to redress competitive injuries, and “[the defendant] is not
Bosley’s competitor; he is their critic.” Id.
The Bosley Medical court observed as well that limiting §§ 1114(a) and 1125(c) to
commercial uses serves to assure that the provisions do not conflict with the First Amendment.
Id. at 677. In the court’s pithy phrase: “Bosley cannot use the Lanham Act either as a shield
from [the defendant’s] criticism, or as a sword to shut [the defendant] up.” Id. at 680.
A recent decision by the Tenth Circuit, Utah Lighthouse Ministry v. Foundation for
Apologetic Information, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 11523 (10th Cir. May 29, 2008), follows Bosley
Medical in every respect, and goes on to interpret the “in connection with any goods or services”
clause in § 1125(a)(1)—at issue in Utah Lighthouse and in this case, but not in Bosley Medical—
to include the same “commercial use” requirement that Bosley Medical held to be encompassed
within § 1114(a)’s “in connection with the sale … of goods or services” clause. Id. at *14. The
Tenth Circuit accordingly rejected Lanham Act unfair competition and dilution claims by the
owner of the “Utah Lighthouse” trademark against the owner of the utahlighthouse.org and .com
domain names, who used those domain names to criticize the mark owner. The court reasoned
that “the defendant in a trademark infringement and unfair competition case must use the mark in
connection with the goods or services of a competing producer, not merely to make a comment
on the trademark owner’s own goods or services.” Id. at *16.
The Bosley Medical and Utah Lighthouse treatment of §§ 1114(a), 1125(a), and 1125(c)
accords with Bihari v. Gross, 119 F. Supp. 2d 309, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), where the court held
that the “in connection with any goods or services” clause in § 1125(a)(1) is limited to use in
connection with the alleged infringer’s goods or services and imposes a “commercial use”
requirement parallel to that set forth in § 1125(c). See also, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v. 2600

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Page 33 of 46

- 27 Enterprises, 177 F.Supp. 2d 661, 665 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (§ 1114(a)’s “in connection with …
goods or services” clause encompasses only use of a mark in connection with goods or services
marketed by a non-markholder).
Further, Bosley Medical’s observation that it would be inconsistent with the “history of
trademark laws in this country” to read the “in connection with” clause to encompass uses that
are solely in connection with the trademark owner’s goods or services accords with the decision
in Wojnarowicz v. American Family Association, 745 F. Supp. 130, 141-42 (S.D.N.Y. 1990),
which thoroughly reviewed that history.
In Wojnarowicz, the court explained that between the Lanham Act’s adoption in 1946 and
its amendment in 1988, it was uniformly understood that the clause in former § 1125(a) that
authorized actions for false designations of origin or source “in connection with any goods or
services” did not encompass uses of an owner’s mark to make false or disparaging statements
about the mark owner’s goods or services. As the court said: “Until 1988, [§ 1125(a)] covered
only misrepresentations concerning one’s own product, and did not apply to disparagement of a
competitor’s product. See Fur Information and Fashion Council, Inc. v. E.F. Timme and Son,
Inc., 501 F.2d 1048, 1051-52 (2d Cir. [1974]).”
Then, in 1988, when § 1125(a) was amended to add, through § 1125(a)(1)(B), a new
cause of action for false advertising—including certain kinds of false advertising about another
person’s product—Congress, mindful of the First Amendment implications, expressly limited
that new cause of action to “false or misleading representation[s] of fact, which … in commercial
advertising or promotion, misrepresent[] the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic
origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities.” (Emphasis

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Page 34 of 46

- 28 added.). In placing that amendment in its historical context, the Wojnarowicz court found the
following passage from the legislative history of the amendment to be instructive:
Under this proposed change only false or misleading “advertising
or promotion” would be actionable, whether it pertained to the
advertiser itself or another party. The change would exclude all
other misrepresentations from [§ 1125(a)] coverage. These others
are the type which raise free speech concerns, such as a Consumer
Report which reviews and may disparage the quality … of
products, [and] misrepresentations made by interested groups
which may arguably disparage a company and its products.
S. 1883, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 135 Cong. Rec. 1207, 1217 (April 13, 1989) (as quoted in
Wojnarowicz, 745 F. Supp. at 142) (second emphasis added).
This history not only supports reading the former § 1125(a) as excluding uses of a
trademark in connection with criticism of a mark owner’s goods or services, but compels the
Bosley Medical and Utah Lighthouse courts’ parallel readings of § 1114(a) and the current §
1125(a)(1)(A). For if one were to adopt the contrary position that the “in connection with”
clauses include such uses, it would follow that the use of a mark to disparage “another person’s
goods, services, or commercial activities”—conduct that the Wojnarowicz court explained had
been outside the coverage of the Lanham Act until § 1125(a)(1)(B) was adopted in 1988—would
have actually been within the coverage of the Act all along. Stranger still, the original 1946
Lanham Act infringement and unfair competition provisions, now codified in sections 1114(a)
and 1125(a)(1)(A) respectively, would magically be rendered more generous to disparagement
claims than the new provision adopted by Congress in 1988 specifically to authorize such claims,
in that they would not be burdened by the new § 1125(a)(1)(B)’s specific limits on
disparagement cases. See Gmurzynska v. Hutton, 355 F.3d 206, 210 (2d Cir. 2004) (elaborating
on those limits). Thus, as Bosley Medical and Utah Lighthouse hold, the only way to reconcile
sections 1114(a) and 1125(a) with “the history of trademark laws in this country” is to recognize

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 35 of 46

- 29 that these provisions exclude statutory coverage in cases where a mark is used solely in
connection with the mark owner’s own goods or services.
2.

Consistent with the reasoning in Bosley Medical and with trademark law

history, three district courts have dismissed Lanham Act claims under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to
meet the “commercial use” requirement in circumstances where, as here, a union defendant was
allegedly using an employer’s trademark in disseminating derogatory information about an
employer/markholder in order to exert pressure on the employer in a labor dispute. See Sodexho
v. HERE Local 217, 989 F. Supp. 169, 172 (D. Conn. 1997); WHS Entm’t Ventures v. United
Paperworkers Int’l Union, 997 F. Supp. 946, 949-51 (M.D. Tenn. 1998); Cellco P’ship v.
Communications Workers of Am., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26823 (D.N.J.).
In Sodexho, the employer complained that the union defendants had, in the course of a
negative publicity and boycott campaign, used the employer’s trade name in misleading flyers
critical of its business practices. The court dismissed the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6):
While defendants' actions may have been intended to encourage
customers to choose a food service provider other than Sodexho,
they were not intended to cause consumers to choose the defendant
unions themselves as the food service providers… [T]he Lanham
Act … does not only require disparagement of a service or product,
it additionally requires that the defendant do so in order to promote
its own service or product. [989 F. Supp. at 172].
WHS is to the same effect. There the court, in a comprehensive opinion, dismissed an
employer’s § 1125(a)(1) and § 1125(c) complaint against a union that used the employer’s mark
in derogatory flyers distributed during a negative publicity campaign. 997 F. Supp. at 951.
Cellco too was a Lanham Act suit by an employer against a union that used the
employer’s trademarked slogan as part of a corporate campaign. The Cellco court followed
Sodexho and WHS and added that “[a] union commenting on its employer adversary through
using the latter’s slogan during a labor dispute” is exercising “its First Amendment right,” which

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

- 30 should not be “jeopardized by an overly-broad construction of the Lanham Act.” 2003 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 26823 at *24 n.6.4
3.

When the foregoing legal principles are applied to the facts alleged in the

Complaint, it is clear beyond any question that Counts 6, 7 and 8 fail to meet the “commercial
use” requirement.
As noted supra p. 23, the Cintas Exposed site is devoted exclusively to criticism of
Cintas and neither sells nor advertises goods or services. The only nexus Cintas can identify
between the Cintas Exposed website and the sale or marketing of any non-Cintas products or
services is this: CintasExposed.org contains a hyperlink to the home page of UNITE HERE’s
principal website UNITEHERE.org, a page that “primarily consists of inflammatory union
rhetoric, much of which is directed at Cintas.” Cplt. ¶ 241. The UNITE HERE home page, in
turn, includes 35 hyperlinks to other web pages, see Exh. 68, two of which Cintas deems
relevant. One is a hyperlink to the home page of the UNITE HERE online store, which sells
mugs, baseball caps, T-shirts, and similar bric-a-brac bearing the UNITE HERE logo, Cplt. ¶
242; the other is to a “Buy Union” page whose purpose is “to encourage consumers to purchase
only union-made products and apparel,” id. ¶ 243. The “Buy Union” page, in turn, contains
hyperlinks to pages that contain further hyperlinks to union-friendly uniform and apparel
manufacturers, some of which compete with Cintas. Id. ¶¶ 244-45.

In contending that the Lanham Act provisions at issue here apply only to commercial users of a
trademark, we do not suggest that those provisions apply only to for-profit users. A nonprofit
organization that, for example, appropriates a competing nonprofit organization’s trade name to
solicit contributions is making a “commercial use” of that mark just as surely as is a for-profit
entity. See United We Stand Am., Inc. v. United We Stand Am. N.Y. Inc., 128 F.3d 86, 90 (2d
Cir. 1996). See also Smithers Found. v. St. Lukes Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr, 2001 WL 761076, at *4
(S.D.N.Y.) (Pauley, J.) (noting that it was “crucial” to the holding in United We Stand that the
plaintiff and defendant nonprofit organizations were “direct competitors”).

- 31 These twice- and thrice-removed links to the sale of non-Cintas goods establish far too
remote a connection between the Cintas Exposed website and the sale of those goods to
transform the plainly noncommercial Cintas Exposed website into one that makes “commercial
use” of Cintas’ trademark. Thus, in Bosley Medical, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that
the defendant’s website devoted to criticism of the mark holder’s hair replacement services was
rendered “commercial” by containing a hyperlink to a “discussion group” website that was, in
turn, supported by advertising from competing hair replacement providers. The court held that
this “roundabout path to the advertising of others is too attenuated to render [defendant’s] site
commercial.” 403 F.3d at 678. The path that Cintas traces from the Cintas Exposed website to
web pages that advertise non-Cintas goods for sale is even more “roundabout” and “attenuated”
than that. Accord Utah Lighthouse, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 11523, at *13 (fact that gripe site
contained link to home page of a site sponsored by an affiliated organization, which, in turn,
included an online bookstore did not render gripe site “commercial”).
4.

In the face of Bosley Medical, the three on-point union 12(b)(6) cases, and

the other cases discussed above—all holding that the use of a trademark solely in connection
with criticism or disparagement of the mark owner’s goods, services or business practices does
not constitute a commercial use—Cintas relies on OBH, Inc. v. Spotlight Magazine, Inc., 86 F.
Supp. 2d 176 (W.D.N.Y. 2000), for the proposition that “a ‘commercial use’ is established any
time an unauthorized use of a protected mark hinders or impacts the commercial success of the
mark’s owner or otherwise disparages the mark owner.” See Cintas’ May 1, 2008 Letter to the
Court. But OBH is a factually distinguishable case that only provides support for Cintas’
assertion in an unsupported and unsound dictum.

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 38 of 46

- 32 In OBH, the plaintiff and the defendant were in “direct competition” with one another.
86 F. Supp. 2d at 182. The plaintiff owned the “The Buffalo News” trademark, and published
the “Apartment Finder,” a circular containing rental listings. The defendant published the
competing “Apartment Spotlight.” The defendant set up a website under the name
“thebuffalonews.com,” and included on that site both criticism of the Buffalo News and a link to
its own “Apartment Spotlight” publication. The district court began by holding that the use of
“thebuffalonews.com” site to advertise a competing publication was a classic “commercial use.”
The court nevertheless went on to add, in a cursory dictum, that “the ‘in connection with’
requirement is not only met by use of the mark in connection with goods or services distributed
or advertised by the alleged infringer; it may also be met by use in connection with the goods or
services distributed by the trademark holder.” Id. at 186 (emphasis added).5
The proposition stated in that dictum is in square conflict with the Lanham Act history set
out above, and has been rejected in Bosley Medical, Utah Lighthouse and the numerous other
cases cited supra at pp.26-29. It cannot therefore rescue Counts 6, 7 and 8 from dismissal for
failure to meet the “commercial use” requirement.
B.

Counts Six And Eight Fail To Allege The Requisite “Likelihood of
Confusion”

A second requirement for a § 1114(a) claim of trademark infringement or a § 1125(a)
claim of unfair competition is that the mark be used in such a way as to create a “likelihood of
confusion” as to the source or sponsorship of the defendant’s goods or services. Louis Vuitton v.
Dooney & Bourke, 454 F.3d 108, 114 (2d Cir. 2006). See also Famous Horse, Inc. v. Fifth
5

The OBH court supported its dictum only through reliance on a further dictum—a statement in
Planned Parenthood v. Bucci, 1997 WL 133313 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d mem., 152 F.3d 920 (2d Cir.
1998), to the effect that the “in connection with” element can be met merely by showing a
connection to the trademark owner’s services. That statement was a dictum because the court
had already concluded that the defendant there had used the plaintiff’s mark to advertise, or
“plug,” the sale of a book authored by one of his confederates. 1997 WL 133313 at * 4.

Lanham Act claim for failure to satisfy the confusion element); WHS Entm’t, 997 F. Supp. at
951-52 (same). Cintas’ Counts 6 and 8 fail this requirement.
Cintas contends that the use of the term “CintasExposed” as the domain name of a
website critical of Cintas’ business practices is apt to confuse Internet users into believing that
Cintas itself is the sponsor of the site. But it is plain from the allegations in the Complaint and
the attached exhibits that Counts 6 and 8 do not meet the confusion requirement.
An Internet user, upon entering the CintasExposed.org site, will immediately be
confronted with a disclaimer, at the top of the page, “inform[ing] [the user] that the website
purports to be ‘an independent source of consumer information from UNITE HERE.’” Cplt. ¶
238.
Although Cintas recognizes, as it must, that this disclaimer would instantly dispel any
possible confusion as to whether Cintas sponsored the site, Cintas presses on, claiming that
search engine users entering “Cintas” as a search term and viewing, as one of the items on the
results list, “Cintas Exposed,” might experience momentary confusion, or “initial interest
confusion,” Cplt. ¶ 254, during the fleeting period between forming the belief that “Cintas
Exposed” might be Cintas’ official site and then seeing, after clicking onto the site, the
disclaimer prominently declaring the site to be an “independent source of consumer information
from UNITE HERE.” Such momentary confusion, Cintas argues, is sufficient to establish the
likelihood-of-confusion element of a cause of action under §§ 1114(a) and 1125(a).
Cintas is wrong for two separate and independent reasons.
First, the Exhibits to the Complaint negate the existence of any confusion, including
initial interest confusion. Exhibit 78 to the Complaint is a printout of the results generated by a

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

- 34 search for “Cintas” on a search engine. This results page shows that, immediately following the
listing for CintasExposed.org is a disclaimer that UNITE HERE included in the
CintasExposed.org website as a “metatag”—a tag that can be read by Internet “search engines”
and then displayed to assist search engine users. The disclaimer states: “CintasExposed.org is
an independent website posted by the labor union UNITE. It contains criticism and information
about the uniform and facilities services rental company Cintas…” Exh. 78.6
After this factual hole in Cintas’ “initial interest confusion” theory was exposed at the
May 27 status conference, Cintas amended its complaint and added a new exhibit (Exhibit 77) to
show that some search engines do not display UNITE HERE’s metatag disclaimer. But Exhibit
77 does not serve to fill the hole in Cintas’ theory. Cintas’ problem is that Exhibit 77, which sets
out the results of searches for the term “Cintas” in a series of search engines, shows that, in every
instance, the official company site, “Cintas.com”—which bears the intuitively obvious name for
an official site7—is always listed first and well ahead of “CintasExposed.org.” Because the
purpose of the “initial interest confusion” doctrine in the Internet context is to prevent an
opportunist from diverting a user to another site before he or she encounters the company’s
official site, see Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm’t Corp., 174 F.3d 1036
(9th Cir. 1999), the doctrine cannot logically be applied in cases where, as here, search engines
list the mark owner’s official site above the “gripe site,” and the official site bears the intuitively
obvious name whereas the lower-listed gripe site does not bear such a name.
6

At the May 27 status conference, counsel for Cintas stated that Exhibit 78 (which was then
Exhibit 77) showed the results of a search using Google, the world’s most dominant search
engine. Tr.21-22. The document itself indicates that Microsoft’s MSN search generated those
results, but the discrepancy is immaterial, because it is a fact of public record that a search using
Google generates the very same disclaimer as that displayed on Exhibit 78.

See Entrepreneur Media, Inc. v. Smith, 279 F.3d 1135, 1146 (9th Cir. 2002) (“Internet users
searching for a company's Web site often assume, as a rule of thumb, that the domain name of a
particular company will be the company name [or trademark] followed by ‘.com.’ ”).

- 35 Second, even if it were assumed, contrary to our submission, that some Internet users
might experience some “initial interest confusion” in searching for Cintas’ official site, Cintas’
“initial interest confusion” theory would still fail. In Savin Corp. v. Savin Group, 391 F.3d 439
(2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit held that “[b]ecause consumers diverted on the Internet can
more readily get back on track than those in actual space, thus minimizing the harm to the owner
of the searched-for site from consumers becoming trapped in a competing site, Internet initial
interest confusion requires a showing of intentional deception.” Id. at 462 n.13 (emphasis
added). As a matter of law, no such showing of “intentional deception” can be made here,
because (i) UNITE HERE gave its Cintas “gripe site” the thoroughly non-deceptive name
“Cintas Exposed”; and (ii) UNITE HERE, as just noted, included a metatag in the
CintasExposed.org website containing a disclaimer that is designed to be displayed by search
engines—and that in fact is displayed by at least two very prominent search engines, see note 6
supra—informing Internet users that the union is the site sponsor.8
C.

Count Seven Fails To Allege Facts Establishing Dilution Of The Association
Between The Term “Cintas” And The Services Cintas Provides.

Cintas’ Count 7 claim under § 1125 (c) has a second fatal defect as well: It fails to meet
that provision’s dilution requirement.
The anti-dilution provision serves to protect the strength and quality of the associations
that exist between a famous trademark and the trademarked product or service. See Moseley v. V
Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418, 433 (2003). Thus, the provision applies against those who
8

To be sure, the Complaint includes a conclusory recitation that UNITE HERE “intentionally”
caused initial interest confusion. Cplt. ¶ 254. But under Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.
Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007), “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do”—
particularly where, as here, the specific allegations in the complaint and attached exhibits
contradict the conclusory recitation. “If a plaintiff's allegations are contradicted by such a
document [attached to the complaint], those allegations are insufficient to defeat a motion to
dismiss.” Matusovsky v. Merrill Lynch, 186 F. Supp. 2d 397, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).

- 36 would use a famous mark to identify a new product or service and in so doing weaken the
original association, as “[f]or example, Tylenol snowboards, Netscape sex shops and Harry
Potter dry cleaners,” which “diminish [the marks’] ability to evoke their original associations…
by blurring their uniqueness and singularity … and/or by tarnishing them with negative
associations.” Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, 296 F.3d 894, 903 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal
quotation marks omitted).
Here, the Complaint contains no allegation that UNITE HERE has used Cintas’ mark to
identify any new product or service. Rather, Cintas’ claim is that UNITE HERE is using Cintas’
mark to criticize services Cintas provides under that mark. Such criticism does not have any
tendency to weaken the association between Cintas and the services it provides; indeed, it has the
effect of reinforcing the association, albeit in a way that is not to Cintas’ liking. Count 7 thus
fails to meet § 1125(c)’s dilution requirement.
D.

Count Nine Should Be Dismissed, Because UNITE HERE’s Use Of “Cintas
Exposed” As A Domain Name Does Not Constitute “Cybersquatting”

Cintas’ final Lanham Act count (Count 9) rests on the Anticybersquatting Consumer
Protection Act of 1999 (“ACPA”), codified as part of the Lanham Act in 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d).
To make out a claim, ACPA requires the plaintiff owner of a famous mark to make two
showings: (1) that the domain name “is identical or confusingly similar to, or dilutive of” the
owner’s mark; and (2) that the defendant registered the domain name with a “bad faith intent to
profit” from the name. Id. Count 9 does not meet either of these requirements.
1.

The domain name “Cintas Exposed” is not “identical” to, or “confusingly

similar” to, Cintas’ mark. By adding “Exposed” to Cintas, UNITE HERE ensured that there
could be no basis for a user to assume that Cintas sponsored the site, since the word “exposed” in
this context connotes adverse scrutiny of the company. See, e.g., Bally Total Fitness v. Faber,

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Page 43 of 46

- 37 29 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1164 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (“ballysucks.com” not confusingly similar to
“Bally”).9
Furthermore, as the Fourth Circuit explained in Lamparello v. Falwell, 420 F.3d 309, 320
(4th Cir. 2005), the inquiry as to whether a domain name is “confusingly similar” for ACPA
purposes extends not only to an examination of the bare name of the site, but also to contextual
factors such as how the site presents itself to a user. 420 F.3d at 316, 320. Here, as already
shown, the Cintas Exposed site includes a prominent disclaimer on its home page, and it is
tagged in such a way that a similar disclaimer can be read and displayed by search engines. See
supra pp. 33-34. There is, accordingly, no “confusing similarity.”
Nor is the “Cintas Exposed” domain name “dilutive” of the Cintas mark. The discussion
above of Cintas’ dilution claim establishes that the use of the term “Cintas Exposed” to describe
a website that comments on Cintas in no way dilutes the association between the term “Cintas”
and the laundry-and-uniform services that Cintas is famous for providing. Count 9 thus fails to
meet the first requirement of its ACPA claim.
2.

Count 9 also fails to meet ACPA’s second requirement, that the defendant

registered the mark with a “bad faith intent to profit” from the domain name. As the court held
in Bosley Medical, a “bad faith intent to profit” within the meaning of ACPA can manifest itself

9

Although the word “exposed” might have a positive connotation when added to the name of a
tanning salon or film developer, cf. Sunlight Saunas, Inc. v. Sundance Sauna, Inc., 427 F. Supp.
2d 1032, 1064 (D. Kan. 2006), the word has no such possible connotation here, and use of it in
the “Cintas Exposed” domain name defeats confusing similarity as a matter of law. To say that
because the word “exposed” might not connote adverse scrutiny when juxtaposed with some
domain names, the word’s negative connotation can never be determined as a matter of law,
would be to indulge in fallacy. That argument would be no different than saying that because
adding “sucks” to a domain name promoting Hoover vacuum cleaners would have a positive
connotation, the negative connotation of “sucks” should never be determined as a matter of
law—as it often is. See Bally, 29 F. Supp. 2d at 1164; Taubman v. Webfeats, 319 F.3d 770, 77778 (6th Cir. 2003).

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

- 38 in two distinct ways: “Cybersquatting occurs when a person other than a trademark holder
registers the domain name of a well known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by
either [1] ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or by [2] using the domain
name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder.” 403 F.3d at 680
(internal quotation marks omitted).
The Tenth Circuit’s recent decision in Utah Lighthouse is in accord:
[B]ad faith intent to profit is when a defendant purchases a domain
name very similar to the trademark and then offers to sell the name
to the trademark owner at an extortionate price. A defendant could
also intend to profit by diverting customers … to the defendant's
own website … [to] purchase the defendant's products or services
instead of the trademark owner’s. [2008 U.S. App. Lexis 11523, at
*29]
As to the first of the two prohibited means of profiting from a domain name registration,
the Complaint contains no allegation that UNITE HERE registered the Cintas Exposed name in
order to “ransom[]” or “sell” that name to Cintas. As to the second, the Complaint contains no
allegation that UNITE HERE registered the Cintas Exposed name to “divert customers” to the
Cintas Exposed website to “purchase [UNITE HERE’s] products or services instead of [Cintas’]”
products or services. Indeed, the Cintas Exposed site does not sell any products or services.
And, the only items that the Complaint alleges UNITE HERE sells anywhere are union-logo
mugs, t-shirts, and other bric-a-brac—items that UNITE HERE sells, not on the Cintas Exposed
site, but rather on a page on UNITE HERE’s official site that, as explained supra at 30-31, is at
two removes from the Cintas Exposed site. Furthermore, Cintas itself does not sell such items,
which means there can be no “diversion” of Cintas’ sales to UNITE HERE of the kind necessary
to form the predicate for showing the second prohibited means of profiting from cybersquatting.
While the foregoing is sufficient to dispose of Cintas’ cybersquatting claim, we would
add that even if, contrary to the case law, an intent to profit from the sale of goods not sold by

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Document 36

Filed 06/20/2008

Page 45 of 46

- 39 the mark owner could constitute actionable cybersquatting, the Complaint still would be
deficient. For the suggestion that UNITE HERE registered the Cintas Exposed domain name
with the “intent to profit” from the sales on the UNITE HERE official website of union-logo
mugs and other trinkets is foreclosed by Cintas’ own allegations. The Complaint alleges that the
Cintas Exposed website was created by UNITE HERE to be “a critical tool” in its negative
public relations and boycott campaign against Cintas, Cplt. ¶ 232, and the Complaint further
identifies the precise “goal” that the website is “specifically designed” to achieve, id. ¶ 112.
Unsurprisingly, that “goal” is not an increased-sales goal for union-logo mugs and other trinkets.
Rather, consistent with Cintas’ entire theory of the case, it is “to encourage consumers and others
not to conduct business with Cintas.” Id. 112. As we have shown, Defendants have a First
Amendment right to pursue such a “goal” through speech on a website, and exercising that right
does not constitute cybersquatting or any other violation of the Lanham Act.
III.

THE COURT SHOULD DECLINE TO EXERCISE ITS SUPPLEMENTAL
JURISDICTION OVER CINTAS’ PENDENT STATE LAW CLAIMS (Counts
Five, Ten-Fourteen)
A district court “may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a [pendent state

law] claim” if the court “has dismissed all [federal] claims over which it has original
jurisdiction.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). That is the proper course here given our showing that
Cintas’ RICO and Lanham Act claims are due to be dismissed: “[I]f the federal claims are
dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims
should be dismissed as well.” First Capital Asset Mgmt. v. Satinwood, Inc., 385 F.3d 159, 183
(2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotations omitted); see also Kolari v. New York-Presbyterian Hosp.,
455 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir. 2006) (“in the usual case in which all federal-law claims are

Case 1:08-cv-02185-WHP

Page 46 of 46

- 40 eliminated before trial, the balance of factors . . . will point toward declining to exercise
jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims”) (internal quotations omitted).
Applying these well-settled jurisdictional principles, this Court routinely has dismissed
the plaintiff’s pendent state claims after having dismissed all of the plaintiff’s federal claims
prior to trial. E.g., Tojzan v. New York Presbyterian Hosp., 2003 WL 1738993, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.);
D.R.S. Trading Co. v. Fisher, 2002 WL 1482764, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.); Whitely v. Comsat Corp.,
2001 WL 1135946, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.); EPA v. Port Auth., 162 F. Supp. 2d 173, 192 (S.D.N.Y.
2001), aff’d, 23 Fed. Appx. 81 (2d Cir. 2001). There is no basis for a contrary result here.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Cintas’ Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.
