UNITED STATES TRUSTEE’S OPPOSITION TO EMERGENCY

appointed Receiver be excused from complying with Section 543(d) for several reasons. First,
only chapter 11 trustees and debtors-in-possession may manage the affairs of chapter 11 debtors.
The Debtor is currently controlled by Donald G. Howell, a State Court appointed Receiver.
(“Receiver”). Second, the Receiver appears to be a custodian, and as such, he is required under
the Bankruptcy Code to turn over all estate property to the Debtor or obtain a court order
excusing this requirement. Third, even if the Bankruptcy Court excuses the Receiver from
complying with the turnover obligation, the Receiver’s rights would be limited to maintaining
physical custody and care of the Debtor’s assets. Excusal from turnover does not instill a
custodian with the powers of a trustee or debtor-in-possession. On the contrary, Section 105(b)
prohibits the appointment of a receiver under any circumstance.

Case 18-11651

4. No bankruptcy schedules or statements have been filed with the Court. [See
generally Bankruptcy Court Docket for case number 18-11651].
5. Prior to the Debtor’s bankruptcy filing, Rabobank N.A. (“Rabobank”) obtained on
February 22, 2018, an Order from the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
Fresno, appointing Donald G. Howell as receiver for the Tipton and Corcoran, California dairies.
(“California Receiver Order”)[ECF No. 73, Exhibits A and B.].
6. The California Receiver Order indicates that Mr. Howell is “authorized and
directed to take possession and control of the three dairies owned and operated by Defendant
Gregory John te Velde.” [ECF No. 73, Exhibit A, page 2,¶1]. Further, the receiver is
authorized to “use, operate, manage, and control” the dairies including doing “all things to incur
risks and obligations ordinarily incurred by owners, managers and operators of similar
businesses and properties.” [Id. at page 3, ¶5a]. Specifically, the receiver is given authority to
collect income; take possession of Debtor’s financial accounts, books and records; prepare and
execute documents in the Debtor’s name; employ agents, employees, and managers; purchase
and sell livestock; establish bank accounts to deposit funds collected and to make disbursements;
commence litigation as needed to protect the receivership estate; and prepare periodic reports
reflecting the receiver’s fees and administrative costs incurred in connection with the operation
of the receivership estate. [Id. at pages 2-5, ¶5a-p].
7. On April 12, 2018, the Circuit Court for the State of Oregon, County of Morrow,
Entered an Order appointing Donald G. Howell as Ancillary Receiver for the dairy located in
Boardman, Oregon. (“Oregon Receiver Order”) [ECF No. 73, Exhibit C].
8. The Oregon Receiver Order provides that Mr. Howell is “authorized and directed
to take possession and control of the personal property collateral of Rabobank (which includes
approximately 8,915 milk cows and 8,440 other head of livestock).” [Id. at pages 1-2,¶2]. The
Order also authorizes Mr. Howell to conduct a sale and/or auction of the personal property, and
to use the net proceeds to pay the claim of Rabobank. [Id. at pages 2-3,¶3a-j]. Mr. Howell is

not authorized to operate the Oregon dairy without further court authorization. [Id. at pages34,¶4].
9. On April 30, 2018, Rabobank filed an emergency motion for relief from stay.
[ECF Nos. 35-40]. In its motion, Rabobank requests that the Receiver be excused from
complying with Section 543(d) of the Bankruptcy Code primarily to allow an auction of the
Oregon property arranged by the Receiver to proceed as well as leaving the management of the
California dairies under the control of the Receiver in place of “the drug-addicted Debtor” who
allegedly has mismanaged the dairies. [ECF No. 38, page 7, ¶6].
III. MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
A. Only debtors in possession and chapter 11 trustees may manage the affairs of
a chapter 11.
10. As defined by section 1101(1), a debtor in possession “means debtor except”
when a trustee is serving in the case. The Bankruptcy Code at sections 1106, 1107 and 1108 sets
forth the rights, powers and duties of a debtor in possession and any trustee appointed by the
Court. The options available for control of the debtor under chapter 11 are limited to a

trustee or the debtor in possession. In re Briar Hill Foods, LLC, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS
3342 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio Sept. 29, 2017) citing In re Roxwell Performance Drilling, LLC,
2013 Bankr. LEXIS 5345 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. Dec. 20, 2013); Matter of Plantation Inn
Partners, 142 B.R. 561, 564 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1992)(granting UST’s motion to appoint a
chapter 11 trustee and opining that the Bankruptcy Code contemplates that administration
of a chapter 11 case be managed by a trustee or a debtor in possession, not a hybrid
created by judicial fiat).
11. While the State Court appointed Receiver in this case took control of
Debtor’s three dairies immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing, the Bankruptcy Code expressly
provides that a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may only proceed under the direction of a debtor in
possession. As such, the Receiver is required by statute to relinquish control and turn over any
and all property necessary to effectuate a proper chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and allow the
debtor in possession to fulfill his obligations under the Bankruptcy Code.

B. The Receiver is a custodian and is subject to the turn over provision in
section 543 of the Bankruptcy Code.

2

12. A “custodian” is defined in section 101(11) as a receiver appointed in a non-

11
12
13

Case 18-11651

bankruptcy case. 11 U.S.C. §101(11)(A). Applying the plain language of the statute, courts
routinely find that receivers appointed by both federal and state court are bankruptcy custodians.
In re San Vicente Medical Partners, Ltd., 962 F.2d 1402 (9th Cir. 1992). In re Ute Lake Ranch,
Inc. 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 4613 (Bankr. D. Co. Sept. 14, 2016). The Bankruptcy Code places
strict limitations on a custodian’s involvement with a debtor’s bankruptcy estate after a petition
is filed.
A custodian with knowledge of the commencement of a case under this title concerning
the debtor may not make any disbursement from, or take any action in the administration
of, property of the debtor, proceeds, product, offspring, rents of profits of such property,
or property of the estate, in the possession, custody, or control of such custodian, except
that as is necessary to preserve such property.
11 U.S.C. §543(a). The additional provisions of section 543 detail the turnover process.

14

13. Here, Mr. Howell was appointed Receiver over the Debtor’s three dairies by the

15

California and Oregon state courts. By definition, Mr. Howell is a “custodian” and is subject to

16

the requirements of section 543. As such, Mr. Howell is obligated to turn over all estate property

17

to a debtor in possession or trustee. See 11 U.S.C. §§543(b)(1) and 1107 (a).

18
19

C. Excusal from compliance under section 543(d) is limited in scope and does
not benefit all creditors of the bankruptcy estate.
14. Section 543(d) provides limited exceptions to a custodian’s turnover obligations.

20
The maximum relief available merely allows a custodian “to continue in possession, custody, or
21
control of such property” under the custodian’s prepetition control. 11 U.S.C. §543(d)(1).
22
15. The bankruptcy court has discretion under section 543(d) to excuse a receiver
23
from the mandatory turnover obligation under section 543(b). See In re Picacho Hills Util. Co.,
24
2013 Bankr. LEXIS 1733 at *7 (Bankr. D.N.M. April 26, 2013). A party seeking such relief has
25
the burden of establishing “by a preponderance of the evidence that the best interests of creditors,
26
[and if the debtor is insolvent, the best interest of equity security holders of the Debtor] are
27
served by permitting a custodian to retain control of the estate. Id.
28

Case 18-11651

16. In determining whether this burden has been satisfied concerning whether a
custodian should be excused from turnover, courts have reviewed the following:

3
4

a. The likelihood of reorganization, and whether funds held by the
receiver are required for reorganization;

5

b. Whether the debtor mismanaged the property;

6

c. Whether turnover would injure creditors;

7

d. Whether the debtor would use the property for the creditors’ benefit;

8
9
10

e. Whether there are avoidance issues raised with respect to property
retained by a receiver, because a receiver does not possess avoiding powers for the benefit of the
estate; and

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22

f. The fact that the automatic stay has deactivated the state court
Receiver Action.
Id. at *20-21. And regardless of what factors are used to aid the court in its decision, the
paramount concern is the interests of all creditors. In re Falconridge, LLC, Bankr. LEXIS 3755
at *7 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. Nov. 8, 2007).
17. In the instant case, Rabobank has requested in its relief from stay motion that Mr.
Howell remain in place as a custodian. The primary purpose for this request is to allow Mr.
Howell to proceed with an auction of the Oregon property that will only inure to the benefit of
Rabobank as an alleged secured creditor. As set forth above, Rabobank has not met its burden of
proof in determining whether Mr. Howell, as custodian, should be excused from compliance with
section 543. Moreover, to the extent that the Court finds Rabobank has met its burden, section
543 does not permit a custodian to sell or otherwise liquidate bankruptcy estate assets.

23
24

D. The Bankruptcy Court may not appoint Mr. Howell as Receiver using its
inherent powers under 11 U.S.C. §105.

25

18. 11 U.S.C. §105(b) expressly prohibits a Bankruptcy Court from appointing

26

Receivers in any case under Title 11. “The Bankruptcy Code has ample provision for the

27

appointment of trustees when needed. Any appointment of a receiver would simply circumvent

28

the established procedures.” H.R. Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 316 (1977).

19. When taken together, sections 105(b) and 543 demonstrate that the “authority
under chapter 11 to manage the debtor’s assets and affairs lies exclusively with either the debtor
as debtor in possession or a chapter 11 trustee.” Roxwell Performance Drilling, LLC, 2013

20. If a fiduciary is necessary in this case due to a lack of confidence

concerning the Debtor’s ability to manage the operations of the three dairies or to
alleviate uncertainty regarding the Debtor being able to fulfill his fiduciary duties under
the Bankruptcy Code, the Court should order that a trustee be appointed by the United
State Trustee.
IV.

CONCLUSION

WHEREFORE, the United States Trustee hereby requests that the Court deny that
portion of Rabobank’s motion requesting that the State Court appointed Receiver be excused
from complying with 11 U.S.C. §543, and grant such other relief as is just under the
circumstances.
