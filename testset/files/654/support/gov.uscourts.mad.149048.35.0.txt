MOTION OF NON-PARTIES ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND
DIGITAL MEDIA LAW PROJECT FOR LEAVE TO FILE BRIEF AS AMICI CURIAE
Electronic Frontier Foundation (“EFF”) and the Digital Media Law Project (“DMLP”)
seek leave to file the accompanying amici curiae brief in the above-captioned case in partial
support of Plaintiff Amy Tuteur. The proposed brief discusses issues raised by the Court’s Order
of April 10, 2013 regarding the merits of Tuteur’s claim under Section 512(f) of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). The Court’s ruling on this claim will have significance
well beyond the parties in this case.
EFF is a member-supported, nonprofit public interest organization dedicated to protecting
civil liberties and free expression in the digital world. EFF seeks to protect the rights of lawabiding Internet users to communicate, learn, and engage in daily life online. EFF has particular
interest in the rule of law at issue in Tuteur’s claim under Section 512(f) of the DMCA. EFF has
represented numerous plaintiffs in Section 512(f) cases. See, e.g., Sapient v. Uri Geller and
Explorologist Ltd., 3:07-cv-02478 VRW (N.D. Cal.); Showing Animals Respect and Kindness v.
Professional Rodeo Cowboys Ass’n, 1:08-cv-03314 (N.D. Ill). In particular, it represents
Stephanie Lenz in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 5:07-cv-03783 JF (N.D. Cal.). A central issue

Case 1:13-cv-10159-RGS Document 35 Filed 05/01/13 Page 2 of 6

in that case, as in this one, is whether a copyright owner can be liable under Section 512(f) for
sending a takedown notice without proper consideration of fair use. See Lenz v. Universal Music
Corp., 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1154-55 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (holding that “[a]n allegation that a
copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the
fair use doctrine [] is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim pursuant to Section 512(f) of the

DMCA”); Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 5:07-CV-03783-JF, 2013 WL 271673 *7 n.3 (N.D.
Cal. Jan. 24, 2013) (showing that defendant “willfully blinded itself to the potential application
of the fair use doctrine” would be sufficient to establish liability under Section 512(f)).
The DMLP provides legal assistance, training, and other resources for online and citizen
media. The DMLP regularly contributes to amicus curiae briefs in a variety of cases with
important implications for online speech, journalism, and the public good. Some examples
include Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 10-1372-CV (2d Cir. June 21, 2010)
(urging the Second Circuit to apply First Amendment scrutiny to the “hot news
misappropriation” doctrine), Wright Development Group LLC v. Walsh, No. 08-2783 (Ill. Mar. 3,
2010) (advocating for rejection of lower courts’ narrow interpretations of Illinois’s Anti-SLAPP
statute, known as the Citizen Participation Act), The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. ImplodeExplode Heavy Industries, No. 2009-0262 (N.H. June 22, 2009) (addressing prior restraints and
asking the Hampshire Supreme Court to defend the First Amendment rights of a website that
covers news about the mortgage industry), and Seaton v. TripAdvisor, No. 12-6122 (6th Cir.
Feb. 27, 2013) (arguing that websites using crowdsourcing to aggregate citizen reports and rely
on that data to draw conclusions cannot be liable for defamation, as such conclusions would be
protected in Tennessee under the doctrine of opinion based on disclosed facts). The DMLP
advocates on behalf of those who gather and report news and information online and disseminate
that news and information to the public via the Internet, and citizens regularly depend upon

Case 1:13-cv-10159-RGS Document 35 Filed 05/01/13 Page 3 of 6

DMLP’s guidance on issues relating to newsgathering, reporting, and the First Amendment. The
DMLP has a particular interest in this case given the potential misuse of overbroad copyright
claims to stifle critical speech and the importance of Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act in
striking a balance between protection of content owners’ rights and free expression online.
The fundamental standard for submission of an amicus brief is whether it “will aid in the
determination of the motion[] at issue.” James Square Nursing Home, Inc. v. Wing, 897 F.Supp.
682, 683 (N.D.N.Y. 1995) aff’d, 84 F.3d 591 (2d Cir. 1996). Among other helpful roles of amici,
[s]ome friends of the court are entities with particular expertise not possessed by
any party to the case. Others argue points deemed too far-reaching for emphasis by
a party intent on winning a particular case. Still others explain the impact a
potential holding might have on an industry or other group.
	  
Neonatology Associates, P.A. v. C.I.R., 293 F.3d 128, 132 (3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.). Judges in the
District of Massachusetts have frequently allowed non-parties to file briefs as amicus curiae. See
AT&T Mobility LLC v. Princi, CIV.A. 11-11448-RWZ, 2011 WL 6012945 (D. Mass. Dec. 2,
2011); Sony BMG Music Entm’t v. Tenenbaum, 672 F. Supp. 2d 217, 224 n.4 (D. Mass 2009);
Pye v. Young Women's Christian Ass'n of W. MA, 419 F. Supp. 2d 20, 22 (D. Mass. 2006).
EFF and DMLP will assist the Court in this case by discussing the broad ramifications of
any ruling on the merits of Tuteur’s Section 512(f) claim. In enacting the DMCA, Congress
created a complex statutory scheme that balances the interests of copyright owners and Internet
users. Section 512(f) is a key provision within the statute that protects users from improper
takedown notices. Dismissal of Tuteur’s claim would leave users vulnerable to private
censorship. The impact of this case on Internet users in general is an important issue that would
likely not be briefed without the participation of EFF and DMLP as amici curiae.
The views of an amicus may align with those of one of the parties. Concerned Area
Residents for the Env’t v. Southview Farm, 834 F. Supp. 1410, 1413 (W.D.N.Y. 1993) (quoting

Case 1:13-cv-10159-RGS Document 35 Filed 05/01/13 Page 4 of 6

Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1260 (9th Cir. 1982)) (“[T]here is no rule . . . that amici must be
totally disinterested.”). Indeed, in the origins of amicus briefing, an interest was mandatory: the
United States Supreme Court established a criteria for amici needing to be “interested in some
other pending case involving similar questions.” Northern Securities Co. v. U.S., 191 U.S. 555,
24 S.Ct. 119, 48 L.Ed. 299 (1903) (rejecting brief because, inter alia, there was no such
interest).1 Moreover, although “[a]n amicus . . . is not a party to the litigation and participates
only to assist the court[, n]evertheless, ‘by the nature of things an amicus is not normally
impartial’ . . . and ‘there is no rule . . . that amici must be totally disinterested.’” Waste Mgmt.,
Inc. v. City of York, 162 F.R.D. 34, 36 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (quoting United States v. Gotti, 755
F.Supp. 1157, 1158 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) and Concerned Area Residents for the Env’t v. Southview
Farm, 834 F.Supp. at 1413.
For these reasons, EFF and DMLP respectfully request that the Court grant this motion
for leave to file the accompanying amici curiae brief.
Respectfully submitted,

Nor does an amicus need to show that a party is incompetently represented in order to
participate. Neonatology Assocs., 293 F.3d at 132 (“Even when a party is very well represented,
an amicus may provide important assistance to the court.”).
