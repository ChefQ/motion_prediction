COMES NOW Defendant Richard P. Nordan, as Ancillary Administrator for the
Separate Estates of Stephen S. Helvenston, Mike R. Teague, Jerko Geraldo Zovko and Wesley
j,k. Batalona, and hereby specially appears to challenge the jurisdiction of this Court over
Blackwater's Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Petition. This Court is currently without
jurisdiction to consider Blackwater's Motion for Leave, in that a Notice of Appeal has been filed
which divested the Court of jurisdiction over the case and conferred jurisdiction to the Fourth
Circuit where the matter is currently pending.

I. On or about December 21, 2006, Blackwater Security Consulting, LLC and
Blackwater Lodge and Training Center, Inc. (collectively "Blackwater") instituted this action by

filing a Petition for Order Granting Arbitration Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. In

Dockets.Justia.com
Case 2:06-cv-00049-F Document 39 Filed 07/31/2007 Page 2of12

Orders dated April 20 and May 11, 2007, this Court granted Blackwater's petition.

2, On May 18, 2007, Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal. [Exhibit "A"

3, The Fourth Circuit has accepted the appeal of this case, despite Blackwater's
Motion to Dismiss, and has set a briefing schedule. [Exhibit "B"]

4, Long after this District Court was divested of jurisdiction over this matter,
Blackwater filed the instant motion for leave to file a supplemental petition, on or about July 10,
2007. This Court is currently without jurisdiction to consider said motion.

5, The transfer of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal is well
established. The U.S. Supreme Court stated: "[A] federal district court and a federal court of
appeals should not attempt to assert jurisdiction over a case simultaneously. The filing of a
notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance-it confers jurisdiction on the
court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case
involved in the appeal." Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S, 56, 58 (1982);
see also Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. Datanet Engineering, Inc., 369 F.3d 385, 393 (4 Cir,
2004) (Observing that the filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional in that it "establishes
the point of time at which the subject-matter jurisdiction of the District Court ends and
that of the Court of Appeals begins").

6. In this case, a Notice of Appeal was filed on May 18, 2007. It was at that point in
time that the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Court ended and that of the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals began. Nearly two months later, Blackwater filed the instant motion for leave
with this District Court, which no longer has jurisdiction over the case. The instant motion for
feave to file a supplemental petition compelling arbitration is within the scope of the subject

matter of the instant appeal, in that it deals with the very same parties and the very same
Case 2:06-cv-00049-F

contractual arbitration provision.

Document 39 _- Filed 07/31/2007 Page3of12

7. Pursuant to binding U.S. Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit authority, this District

Court is without jurisdiction to consider Blackwater's motion for leave.

It is respectfully requested that the Court deny the motion for lack of subject matter

jurisdiction.

This 30" day of July 2007.

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
PILED
June 1, 2007

07-1508 Blackwater Security v. Nordan

BRIEFING ORDER

Briefs and the appendix shall be served and filed within the time
provided in the following schedule:

Appellant's brief/Appendix T/11L/07

Appellee's brief 30 days after service
of brief of appellant

Reply brief (if any} 14 days after service
of brief of appellee

Tf this case involves more than one appellant or appellee, or is a

case consolidated for purposes of the appeal, all parties to a side
shall join in a single brief, unless the Court has granted a motion
for leave to file separate briefs pursuant to Local Rules 28{a) and
28{d). All parties to a side shall share the time allowed for oral
argument. Each side must notify the Court of the attorney who has

been designated as lead counsel within 10 days of the date of this

order.

After the briefing schedule in this case has been completed, the
Court may review this case to determine the need for oral argument
before the Clerk prepares the oral argument calendar. Pursuant

to Local Rule 34(a}), the Court may, on its own initiative and
without prior notice, screen an appeal for decision on the parties'
briefs without oral argument. If your case is selected for the
oral argument calendar, you will receive notice that your case

has been tentatively calendared for a specific court session
approximately 30 days in advance of the session, and any motion

to submit the appeal on briefs, voluntarily dismiss the appeai,
continue argument to another date, or seek other relief which

may affect cral argument must be filed by a deadline established
in the notice,

Counsel are reminded that failure of the appellant to timely

File a brief will cause the Court to initiate the process for
dismissing a case under Local Rule 45, impose discipline pursuant
to Local Rule 46(g}, ox both. Failure of the appellee to timely
file a brief may result in the loss of the right to be heard at
oral argument and in the imposition of discipline pursuant to Local
Rule 46(g). Any motion for an extension of time to file a brief
must be filed well in advance of the date the brief is due and must
set forth the additional time requested and the reasons for the re-
quest. The Court discourages these motions, and grants extensions
only when extraordinary circumstances exist. Local Rule 31 (c}.
