Defendant Made No Good Faith Effort to Advise the Court
Of the Actual Amount in Controversy at the time of Removal
And Affirmatively Misrepresented and Misconstrued the
Relevant Facts and Operative Law in an Attempt to
Establish Removal Jurisdiction

6
Through its citation to three unpublished district court
7
decisions, defendant argues that removal is always objectively
8
reasonable “if the complaint is silent or unclear as to the amount
9
in controversy.”

No such rule exists nor do any of the authorities

10
cited by defendant actually make such a holding.

The actual rule

11
applicable in cases such as this, where the amount of damages is not
12
expressly set forth in the plaintiff’s complaint, is recited in
13
Laughlin v. Kmart Corp. 50 F.3d, 871, 873 (10th Cir. 1995) cert

denied 516 U.S. 863 (1995), quoting and citing Lonnquist v. J.C.

Penney Co., 421 F.2d 597, 599 (10th Cir. 1970) and Gaus v. Miles,
16
Inc., 980 F.2d 564, 567 (9th Cir. 1992):
17

21

The amount in controversy is ordinarily determined by the
allegations of the complaint, or, where they are not
dispositive, by the allegations in the notice of removal. The
burden is on the party requesting removal to set forth, in the
notice of removal itself, the "underlying facts supporting
[the] assertion that the amount in controversy exceeds $ 50,000
[now $75,000]. Moreover, there is a presumption against
removal jurisdiction.

22

Defendant ignores that in light of the presumption against

18
19
20

23

removal it must prove by preponderance of evidence that the amount

24

in controversy exceeds $ 75,000.

In discussing how

The Complaint makes no specific statements of the amount
in controversy. The evidence demonstrates that it is more
likely than not that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000
because Plaintiff seeks to recover all alleged unpaid wages
purportedly earned while installing communications service
equipment as an employee of MC Communications, Inc. pursuant to
N.R.S. § 608.150, as well as attorneys' fees. (Complaint ¶¶ 2223.) N.R.S. § 608.150 permits recovery for "all indebtedness
for labor incurred". This alleged "indebtedness" would
necessarily include Plaintiff’s wages. See Trustees of Const.
Industry and Laborers Health and Welfare Trust v. Hartford Fire
Ins. Co., 578 F.3d 1126, 1129 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Tobler &
Oliver Constr. Co. v Bd. of Trs. of Health & Ins. Fund for
Carpenter's Local Union No. 971, 84 Nev. 438, 442 P.2d 904, 907
(1968). Plaintiff's Complaint seeks recovery of all unpaid
wages covering a two year period prior to the commencement of
this lawsuit. (Complaint ¶¶ 3, 23, 25.) When he last performed
services on behalf of MC Communications, Inc., Plaintiff earned
a wage of $7.55 per hour, as well as overtime. [Dkt. #1, Ex. C
thereto.] This would result in a typical wage of $817.99 per
week, and $23,721.71 over the course of his employment with MC
Communications, Inc. [Id. at Ex. C ¶ 4.]

19
20
21
22
23

In addition to the above amounts, Plaintiff also asserts
that he is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs if
successful. (See Complaint ¶ 25.) Requests for attorney’s fees
must be taken into account in ascertaining the amount in
controversy. See Galt G/S v. JSS Scandinavia,142 F.3d 1150,
1156 (9th Cir. 1998) (claims for statutory attorney’s fees to
be included in amount in controversy, regardless of whether
award is discretionary or mandatory). Because Plaintiff's

The Court should be mindful that plaintiffs are not proposing
the “objectively reasonable” standard requires defendant to meet its
burden of proof to sustain removal. Such is clearly not the law.
Rather, what plaintiffs are proposing is that the information
available to defendant at the time of removal should be reviewed to
determine if it provided an “objectively reasonable” basis for
defendant to believe, even erroneously, that removal was proper.

claims are unlikely going to be immediately resolved and could
exceed his damages, Plaintiff's attorneys' fees claim alone
could exceed the $75,000 threshold. See, e.g., Simmons v. PCR
Technology, 209 F. Supp 2d 1029, 1033 (N.D. Cal. 2002). For
example, in two similar single-plaintiff class and/or
collective actions concerning claims for alleged unpaid wages
filed by Plaintiff's lead counsel, Leon Greenberg, Mr.
Greenberg and his co-counsel obtained court-approved fees of
$270,000.00 and $923,761.00, respectively. See October 24, 2008
Order granting Motion for Approval of Class Action Settlement
in Williams v. Trendwest Resorts, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:05cv-00605-RCJ-LRL (D. Nev. Oct. 24, 2008) (order approving
settlement) (Complaint, Ex. D thereto); August 25, 2008 Order
in Westerfield v. Fairfield Resorts, Civil Action No. 2:05-cv01264-JCM-PAL (D. Nev. Aug. 25, 2008) (order approving
settlement) [Dkt. #1, Ex. E thereto]. In the Williams case, in
particular Mr. Greenberg alone was awarded $54,446.95. While
these cases involved the FLSA and not, N.R.S. § 608.150,
specifically, Defendant Cox submits that those cases and the
instant case are analogous since they both necessarily entail
similar, complex litigation procedures and legal services to
obtain specific unpaid wages on behalf of Plaintiff. Indeed,
Mr. Greenberg asserted in 2008 that an attorney with his
similar years of experience handling class action litigation
would "typically command an hourly rate of $450.00 an hour or
more." [Id. at 23]. See Motion for Approval of Class Action
Settlement in Westerfield at 23; Motion for Approval of Class
Action Settlement in Williams at 22. Presumably, his hourly
rate would be even higher in the instant suit three (3) years
later. Accordingly, because Plaintiff's claims are unlikely
going to be immediately resolved and could exceed his damages,
Plaintiff's attorneys' fees claim alone will likely exceed the
$75,000 threshold.

Such statements

D.

Defendant’s Misrepresentations of Law
Are Clearly Set Forth in the Record

3
Defendant now claims its statements about Gibson v. Chrysler
4
Corp., 261 F.3d 927, 942-43 (9th Cir. 2001) and other authorities
5
were somehow twisted and misrepresented by plaintiff.

According to

6
defendant, all it did in citing Gibson was make clear that while
7
class attorney’s fee awards could not, in their entirety, be
8
considered for amount in controversy requirements they could still
9
be “apportioned” among the class members for that purpose.

Although

10
that may be a correct statement of the law, nowhere in defendant’s
11
prior submissions to the Court did it mention it was merely arguing
12
for “apportionment” of such a class wide award of attorney’s fees.
13
Indeed, the entire purpose of defendant’s citation to Gibson, as
14
found in both this case and by Judge Hunt in the Izumi case, was to
15
intentionally misrepresent the ability of defendant to include a
16
class award of attorney’s fees, in its entirety, for amount in
17
controversy purposes.
18
The conclusion defendant intentionally misrepresented Gibson is
19
inescapable.

The defendant failed to ever mention what the “fee

20
apportionment” it is now claiming it was arguing for through its
21
citation to Gibson might actually yield for amount in controversy
22
purposes.

It is apparent defendant made no effort to “apportion”

23
such a class award of attorney’s fees because the resulting amount
24
in controversy figure would have been far less than the
25
jurisdictionally required $75,000.

Defendant now compounds its

26
improper behavior by insisting, after the fact, and contrary to all
27
of its prior submissions, that it had been properly arguing for such

that would not have assisted it in establishing a basis for removal.
