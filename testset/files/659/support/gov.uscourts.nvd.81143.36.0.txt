MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

2 I.

INTRODUCTION

3

Cox respectfully requests that this Court reconsider its Order dated December 22, 2011 only

4 as to its award of attorneys’ fees. Cox believes that it had a reasonably objective basis for removal
5 based on a number of factors and unique circumstances.
6

Most importantly, Cox’s sole basis for filing its Petition for Removal was to expedite this

7 litigation by placing it before the only Court that had ever actually ruled on the sole claim in this
8 lawsuit – e.g., whether a cable company, such as Cox, is subject to N.R.S. § 608.150. Consistent
9 with its intent, Cox immediately filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings hoping to dispose of
10 this case in short order. The congressional intent behind awarding attorneys’ fees under the removal
11 statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), is to deter delay by the removing party. Based on Cox’s actions, it is
12 clear that the last thing Cox intended was for this case to be delayed or for either party to bear
13 additional costs. It is unfair to punish Cox where there is no evidence that it intended to delay this
14 case. It is an injustice to require Cox to pay Phelps’s attorneys’ fees for trying to expeditiously
15 dispose of a frivolous claim that should have never been brought in the first place.
16

Second, Cox reasonably believed, based on objective facts, that it could meet the amount in

17 controversy; otherwise, it would not have attempted removal. District courts within the Ninth
18 Circuit have found that a complaint which is silent or unclear as to the amount in controversy can be
19 a basis, in whole or in part, for declining to award attorneys’ fees. This is the case here. The Court’s
20 Order states that Cox did not have a reasonable basis for removal based, in part, on Phelps’s demand
21 for $6,000 to $9,000 in damages. [Dkt. # 35, Dec. 22, 2011 Order, pp. 6, 9.] But, at the time of
22 removal, Phelps’s complaint was silent as to the amount of damages he sought for unpaid wages.
23 [See Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, Compl.] It was not until after Cox removed that Phelps advised that he was
24 seeking “probably about $6,000 and certainly not greater than $9,000.” [Dkt. #16, p. 3.] Cox did
25 not have knowledge of this fact at the time of removal, which is when the “objectively reasonable
26 basis” test is determined.
27

Although attorneys’ fees should not have been awarded based on the silent and unclear

1 Complaint alone, Cox had other objectively reasonable bases to remove. At the time of removal,
2 Cox looked to its history with the Valdez Lawsuit and determined that it could easily meet the
3 amount in controversy requirement. Valdez and Phelps have the exact same claims because,
4 according to Phelps, Cox’s liability for damages includes, via N.R.S. § 608.150, the underlying
5 Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) claim and N.R.S. § 608.018 and N.R.S. § 608.040 claims
6 filed against MC Communications. A comparison of the complaints of Valdez and Phelps
7 reveal they are identical. Valdez made an offer to settle his individual claims against only Cox,
8 exclusive of the other defendants, for $300,000. Courts consider this evidence of the amount
9 in controversy, and for this reason, Cox clearly had an objectively reasonable basis for
10 removal because Phelps will more likely than not seek the same individual damages as Valdez
11 given they have the same claims against the same defendant. Cox researched Phelps’s wages and
12 the method of payment by contacting his employer, MC Communications, and determined that his
13 alleged damages in both actions – including unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime, liquidated
14 damages and allegations of willfulness and attorneys’ fees – could be very similar to Valdez.
15 Valdez’s offer of settlement of $300,000 is more than three times the required amount in controversy
16 ($75,000) and does not specify what amount is for damages and what amount is for attorneys’ fees.
17

Finally, there is a misunderstanding with respect to Cox’s argument as to attorneys’ fees.

18 Phelps’s primary argument in his remand motion incorrectly asserted that Cox could not include
19 any amount of attorneys’ fees in its calculation of the amount in controversy at all because no
20 statute allegedly applied to class action litigation.

In response, Cox merely refuted Phelps’s

21 argument by making the sole point that attorneys’ fees could be included in the amount in
22 controversy. In doing so, Cox pointed generally to Gibson, a case Phelps cited. In his Reply brief,
23 Phelps twisted Cox’s argument and accused Cox of rejecting apportionment and misstating Gibson.
24 However, Cox said nothing about apportionment. The only point Cox was trying to make was that it
25 could include attorneys’ fees pursuant to statute in a class action case and that Phelps’s interpretation
26 of the law that it could not do so was incorrect. Cox was concerned about Phelps’s trickery when it
27 first read his Reply brief and should have filed a sur-reply at that time to clarify its position.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

4

It is important to address the Valdez Lawsuit in conjunction with Phelps’s lawsuits given that

5 the Valdez Lawsuit contains the exact claims as this action (and the underlying action against MC
6 Communications for which Phelps contends Cox is liable) and is the basis for this removal for all of
7 the reasons set forth herein.
8

A.

9

On August 18, 2009, Plaintiff's counsel filed the Valdez Lawsuit against Cox for unpaid

The Valdez Lawsuit

10 wages on behalf of their client, Joseph Valdez, under the FLSA, N.R.S. § 608.018, N.R.S. §
11 608.040, and N.R.S. § 608.150. (See Valdez Compl., at Exhibit A hereto; Valdez Am. Compl., at
12 Exhibit B hereto.)
13

As to the N.R.S. § 608.150 claim, Valdez alleged that he was employed by cable installation

14 companies which contracted with Cox "to install, construct, maintain or modify, various cable
15 television service, computer internet (DSL) service and telephone service installations." (Valdez
16 Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19; Valdez Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19.) Valdez further alleged that the cable installation
17 companies failed to pay him overtime, and alleged that Cox was liable because: "[p]ursuant to
18 Nevada Revised Statutes § 608.150, the defendant, Cox, was acting as a general, or superior
19 contractor, for the plaintiff's installation or construction services by engaging the…subcontractors to
20 perform such installation or construction services and is liable to the plaintiff for all unpaid wages
21 owed for performing such services." (Valdez Compl. ¶ 40; Valdez Am. Compl. ¶ 40.)
22
23
24
25
26
27

N.R.S. § 608.150(1), the statute upon which Valdez relied, provides:
Every original contractor making or taking any contract in this State
for the erection, construction, alteration or repair of any building or
structure, or other work, shall assume and is liable for the indebtedness
for labor incurred by any subcontractor or any contractors acting
under, by or for the original contractor in performing any labor,
construction or other work included in the subject of the original
contract, for labor, and for the requirements imposed by chapters 616A
to 617, inclusive, of NRS.
Id. (emphasis added). Because Cox is not in the construction business or any other business that

1 would trigger the applicability of N.R.S. § 608.150, Cox successfully moved for summary judgment
2 on this claim. In dismissing Valdez's N.R.S. § 608.150 claim, this Court stated:
3
4
5

7

[A] plain reading of the statute entitles Defendant Cox to the relief
requested.
NRS § 608.150 is expressly limited to original
contractors engaged in the "erection, construction, alteration or repair
of any building or structure, or other work." The record before the
Court does not support a finding that Defendant Cox is engaged in
such a construction business. The Court will therefore grant
Defendant Cox's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to
Plaintiff's claim under NRS § 608.150.

8 (See September 13, 2010 Order, at Exhibit C hereto (emphasis added).)
9

Plaintiff's Counsel then filed a Motion to Certify to the Nevada Supreme Court the question

10 of who is an "original contractor making or taking any contract in this State for the erection,
11 construction, alteration or repair of any building or structure, or other work" pursuant to N.R.S.
12 § 608.150. (See Mot. to Certify, at Exhibit D hereto.) This Court denied the motion and effectively
13 reaffirmed its prior ruling. (See November 22, 2010 Order, at Exhibit E hereto).
14

Dissatisfied with this Court's prior two Orders on the N.R.S. § 608.150 issue, Plaintiff's

15 Counsel forced the parties to brief the issue yet again by filing a frivolous Motion to Reargue on
16 January 25, 2011. (See Mot. to Reargue, at Exhibit F hereto.) The Court denied the Motion to
17 Reargue, as well, and said: "[t]he Court finds that Plaintiff has not presented a compelling reason
18 why the Court should reconsider its prior Order, nor has Plaintiff presented new facts or law of a
19 strongly convincing nature that would support reversing this Court's Order of September 13, 2010."
20 (See June 20, 2011 Order, at Exhibit G hereto.)
21

On November 22, 2011, this Court issued an Order granting Valdez’s Motion to Sever and

22 Remand, ordering that “Plaintiff’s second and third causes of action arising under Nevada state law
23 are hereby SEVERED from the Amended Complaint (Doc. # 17) and REMANDED to the Eighth
24 Judicial District in and for the County of Clark, State of Nevada in Case No. A-09-597433-C.” (See
25 November 22, 2011 Order, at Exhibit H hereto.) Importantly, Valdez’s “second and third causes of
26 action arising under Nevada state law” – the only claims remanded to Nevada state court – do not

1 include the long-since dismissed N.R.S. § 608.150 claim.1 This fact did not deter Plaintiff’s Counsel
2 from filing a “Motion to Reinstate Claims Against Defendant Cox Communications Under N.R.S. §
3 608.150” before the District Court for Clark County, Nevada on December 21, 2011. (See “Mot. to
4 Reinstate Claims Against Defendant Cox Communications Under N.R.S. § 608.150”, at Exhibit I
5 hereto.)

In his latest filing, Valdez contends that the state court should “reinstate” the N.R.S. §

6 608.150 claim against Cox because this Court’s ruling was “erroneous as a matter of law” and
7 “logically flawed”. (See Exhibit I, pp. 5-7.) Thus, Cox will be forced, yet again, to expend time and
8 resources in responding to Valdez’s fourth attempt to save his N.R.S. § 608.150 claim.

B.

The Phelps Lawsuit

After this Court granted summary judgment on Valdez’s N.R.S. § 608.150 claim against Cox

11 on September 13, 2010, Plaintiff's Counsel filed the instant lawsuit on February 2, 2011 on behalf of
12 Michael Phelps, (and a purported 100-member class) seeking, again, to recover alleged unpaid
13 wages from Cox pursuant to N.R.S. § 608.150. [Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, Compl. ¶¶ 4-5, 21-25.] On
14 February 11, 2011, Phelps filed a lawsuit against MC Communications asserting claims under the
15 FLSA, N.R.S. § 608.018 and N.R.S. § 608.040 [hereinafter, the “MC Lawsuit”].2 The exact claims
16 were alleged in the Valdez Lawsuit. The MC Lawsuit was removed to this Court on March 31,
17 2011.3 Phelps avers that Cox is liable for all of these claims via his N.R.S. § 608.150 claim in this
18 lawsuit. [Dkt. #1, Ex. A, ¶¶ 24, 25.]
19

Phelps was not employed by Cox. Instead, Phelps was employed by MC Communications,

20 which - exactly like the co-defendants in the Valdez Lawsuit - installs cable on a contract basis for
21 Cox. [Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, Compl. ¶¶ 13-16.] Exactly like the Valdez Lawsuit, Phelps alleges in his

24

Valdez’s second and third causes of action arise under N.R.S. § 608.018 and N.R.S. § 608.040. (See Exhibit B
hereto, pp. 9-10.)
2

A true and correct copy of the complaint filed in the MC Lawsuit is attached hereto as Exhibit J.

The federal action is currently styled: Michael Phelps v. MC Communications, Inc. et al., 2:11-cv-00423PMP–VCF, United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Plaintiff’s state law claims arising under N.R.S. §
608.018 and N.R.S. § 608.040 were remanded on August 1, 2011. That lawsuit is styled: Michael Phelps v. MC
Communications, Inc. et al., Case No. A-11-634965-C, Eighth Judicial District Court in and for the County of Clark,
State of Nevada.

1 Complaint that Cox is liable under N.R.S. § 608.150 for MC Communication’s failure to pay all
2 wages owed under the FLSA. [Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, Compl. ¶¶ 22-23.] Finally, exactly like the Valdez
3 Lawsuit, Phelps contends that Cox is liable under N.R.S. § 608.150 because the installation of cable
4 in the homes of Cox's customers purportedly amounts to the "alteration" of buildings. [Dkt. # 1, Ex.
5 A, Compl. ¶ 22.] In other words, the Valdez Lawsuit and this case raise the same issue of law and
6 arise from the exact same allegations of material fact against the same defendant by the same
7 Plaintiff’s Counsel.4
8

Knowing that this action and the Valdez Lawsuit involve identical claims, and that this Court

9 had definitively ruled that N.R.S. § 608.150 does not apply to Cox, Cox filed its Petition for
10 Removal on May 17, 2011 to secure an early and inexpensive resolution of this case. [Dkt. # 1.]
11 Although this Court ultimately ruled that Cox did not meet the amount in controversy requirement
12 for removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 1447, Cox respectfully submits that it should not
13 have awarded to Phelps his attorneys’ fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) because there is
14 overwhelming evidence that Cox had a “objectively reasonable” basis for removal for the reasons
15 that follow.

Mr. Greenberg also filed the same lawsuit against Cox on behalf of Plaintiff Brian Izumi the same day that he
filed this lawsuit on February 2, 2011. In the Izumi Lawsuit, Plaintiff Izumi, like Plaintiff Phelps, contends that Cox is
liable under N.R.S. § 608.150 for his alleged unpaid wages arising from his employment with Pride Communications,
Inc. A true and correct copy of the Complaint in the Izumi Lawsuit is attached hereto as Exhibit K, ¶¶ 24, 25. At the
same time that it removed this action, Cox also sought to remove the Izumi Lawsuit for the identical reasons it sought to
remove this action. See Izumi v. Cox Communications Las Vegas, Inc., No. 2:11-cv-00803-RLH-CWH, Dkt. # 24. The
Izumi Lawsuit was remanded to state court and no attorneys’ fees were awarded. See Izumi v. Cox Communications Las
Vegas, Inc., No. 2:11-cv-00803-RLH-CWH, 2011 WL 5854618, *2 (D. Nev. Nov. 21, 2011).

Standard for Awarding Attorneys’ Fees on a Motion to Remand

9

The United States Supreme Court held that “the standard for awarding fees should turn on

10 the reasonableness of the removal.” Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 141 (2005).
11 “Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney’s fees under § 1447(c) only where the
12 removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal. Conversely, when an
13 objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be denied.” Id. at 141. The Supreme Court further
14 stated that “[i]n applying this rule, district courts retain discretion to consider whether unusual
15 circumstances warrant a departure from the rule in a given case. For instance, a plaintiff's delay in
16 seeking remand or failure to disclose facts necessary to determine jurisdiction may affect the
17 decision to award attorney's fees.” Id. at 141 (emphasis added). See also Yazzie v. Celadon
18 Trucking Services, Inc., No. CV-09-8198-PHX-GMS, 2010 WL 749639, *1 (D. Ariz. Mar. 3, 2010)
19 (request for attorneys’ fees denied where “[t]he Complaint did not seek a specific dollar amount of
20 damages, but rather sought “[f]or judgment in [plaintiffs’] favor in amounts to be proved at trial,
21 together with prejudgment interests and costs’ and ‘[f]or such other and further relief that the court
22 deems just and proper’”).
23

The determination of whether the defendant had an objectively reasonable basis for removal

24 is made at the time of removal. See Martin, 546 U.S. at 141; City of San Antonio v. Time Warner
25 Cable, San Antonio, L.P., No. SA-09-CV-869-XR, 2009 WL 4878647, *4 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 11,
26 2009) (“[C]ourts look to the objective merits of the defendant’s case at the time of removal.”) This
27 is so because “diversity jurisdiction is determined at the time the action commences.” Hill v. Blind

Furthermore, as the Ninth Circuit has recognized, “removal is not objectively unreasonable

6 solely because the removing party’s arguments lack merit, or else attorneys’ fees would always be
7 awarded whenever remand is granted.” Lussier v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., 518 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th

For all of the reasons set forth below, Cox’s Petition for Removal was objectively reasonable.

Cox’s Objectively Reasonable Bases For Removal

Cox’s Reason for Removal Was to Expedite, Not to Delay, Final Resolution
of this Case

Cox’s motivation for removal – to bring this litigation to a swift conclusion with minimal

15 expense – is relevant to the Court’s decision to award attorneys’ fees in granting Plaintiff’s Counter16 Motion to Remand Case to State Court Because of a Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction and for an
17 Award of Attorney’s Fees (“Motion to Remand”). In Martin, the United States Supreme Court
18 discussed the congressional intent behind awarding attorneys’ fees under the removal statute, 28
19 U.S.C. § 1447, and stated:
20
21
22
23

Assessing costs and fees on remand reduces the attractiveness of removal as a method
for delaying litigation and imposing costs on the plaintiff. The appropriate test for
awarding fees under § 1447(c) should recognize the desire to deter removals sought
for the purpose of prolonging litigation and imposing costs on the opposing party,
while not undermining Congress’ basic decision to afford defendants a right to
remove as a general mater, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.

24 Martin, 546 U.S. at 140. In Yazzie v. Celadon Trucking Services, Inc., the plaintiff sought attorneys’
25 fees associated with his motion to remand “because Defendants demonstrated bad faith when they
26 offered no evidence in their Notice of Removal to establish that Plaintiffs’ claims exceeded
27 $75,000.”

8

While Defendants’ Notice of Removal cite only “information and belief” as the basis
for fixing the amount in controversy in excess of $75,000, the lack of explicit
evidence does not render their underlying belief objectively unreasonable.
‘[R]emoval is not objectively unreasonable solely because the removing party’s
arguments lack merit, or else attorneys’ fees would always be awarded whenever
remand is granted.’ This is a wrongful death action, and it is not objectively
unreasonable to believe that the Plaintiffs would be seeking more than $75,000 in
damages for the death of their son. Awarding fees and costs under Section 1447(c)
can serve to deter spurious removals, orchestrated to prolong litigation and
impose costs on the opposing party, but there is no evidence of improper motive,
unreasonable bases for removal, or other ‘unusual circumstances.’ Accordingly, the
Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs is denied.

9
10 Id. at *2 (emphasis added) (quoting Lussier, 518 F.3d at 1065). While this is not a wrongful death
11 case, the same rationale is applied here because there is no evidence of “improper motive” to
12 prolong litigation based on the facts at the time of removal. Based on its history of litigating with
13 Phelps’s counsel before this very Court, and this Court’s prior ruling on the exact issue raised by
14 Phelps’s Complaint, Cox reasonably believed that this Court had the unique ability to expeditiously
15 rule upon the dispositive issue of the applicability of N.R.S. § 608.150 to Cox. Removal would
16 expedite – not delay –the litigation with minimal cost to both parties. As evidenced by the prompt
17 filing of its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings following removal, Cox sought to obtain an early
18 ruling that, like the plaintiff in the Valdez Lawsuit, Phelps cannot maintain a claim against Cox
19 under N.R.S. § 608.150 because the statute does not apply to Cox. [See Dkt. # 14; Ex. C hereto, p.
20 2.] Magistrate Judge Hoffman found in the Izumi Lawsuit (which was removed at the same time and
21 involved the exact same claim – N.R.S. § 608.150) that Cox’s Motion For Judgment on the
22 Pleadings had “merit” and granted the parties’ Motion to Stay Discovery pending a ruling on
5
23 Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand. Accordingly, there is no evidence of delay to warrant an award of

24 attorneys’ fees.

Whether removal is objectively reasonable is determined at the time of removal. City of San
Antonio v. Time Warner Cable, San Antonio, L.P., No. SA-09-CV-869-XR, 2009 WL 4878647, *4
(W.D. Tex. Dec. 11, 2009) (“[C]ourts look to the objective merits of the defendant’s case at the time
of removal.”) Where a plaintiff does not specify a specific dollar amount of damages or the amount
in controversy is unclear in his complaint, at least three district courts within the Ninth Circuit have
deemed removal to be objectively reasonable. In Jellinek v. Advance Products & Systems, Inc., the
court refused to award attorneys’ fees, in part, because the plaintiff failed to allege the amount in
controversy in the original and amended complaints. No. 10-cv-1226 JM (WMC), 2010 WL
3385998, *3 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2010). The court said:
Here, the court denies the motion for award of costs and fees because two of the
issues central to the case are unclear. The first ambiguity was the result of the Ninth
Circuit’s split in authority on when the 30-day period for filing a notice of removal
begins tolling. APS and Forlander should not be held responsible for a split in Ninth
Circuit authority. The second ambiguity was caused by Plaintiff’s failure to allege
an amount in controversy in the initial and amended complaints, and given this
lack of clarity it cannot be said that defendants lacked an objectively reasonable
basis for seeking removal.
Id. at *3 (emphasis added). Similarly, in Yazzie v. Celadon Trucking Services, Inc., the court
declined to award attorneys’ fees where the court found that:

23

The Complaint did not seek a specific dollar amount of damages, but rather sought
‘[f]or judgment in [plaintiffs’] favor in amounts to be proved at trial, together with
prejudgment interests and costs’ and ‘[f]or such other and further relief that the court
deems just and proper’.

Phelps admits in his Motion to Remand that “[t]he amount of such unpaid wages is not

5 specified in the complaint.” [Dkt. # 17, Mot. to Remand, p. 2.] Here, Phelps’s Complaint only
6 alleged that, “[a]s a result of the foregoing, the named plaintiff seeks a judgment against the
7 defendant Cox for all unpaid wages owed to him and the members of the putative class of plaintiffs
8 by MC as alleged in this claim for relief, along with interest, costs and attorney's fees.” [Dkt. # 1, Ex.

10 removal based on Phelps’s Complaint alone because it did not seek a specific dollar amount of
11 damages and was unclear regarding the total amount in controversy.6

1 been considered in determining whether Cox had an objectively reasonable basis for removal
2 because that statement was made for the first time post-removal. In its Order, the Court found that
3 Cox’s position constitutes an objectively unreasonable basis for removal and that “Defendant has
4 failed to present evidence that Plaintiff’s individual attorney’s fees on a $9,000 claim would exceed
5 $66,000, thereby satisfying the $75,000 requirement.”7 [Dkt. # 35, Dec. 22, 2011 Order, p. 9.] The
6 Court analogized the instant case to Rae v. Perry stating “that the defendant [in Rae] lacked an
7 objectively reasonable basis for removal when the complaint sought only $20,000 in damages and
8 the defendant failed to offer evidence that showed by a preponderance of the evidence that the
9 amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. 392 F. App’x 753, 756 (11th Cir. 2010).”8 [Dkt. # 35,
10 Dec. 22, 2011 Order, p. 8.] However, Cox was not aware that Phelps was seeking “$6,000 to
11 $9,000” at the time it made the decision to remove this case. Unlike Rae, where the amount in
12 controversy was set forth in the complaint, Phelps’s Complaint was silent as to the amount in
13 controversy and Cox had no knowledge of Phelps’s specific claim of $6,000 to $9,000 in damages at
14 the time of removal. See Rae v. Perry, 392 F. App’x 753, 756 (11th Cir. 2010) (“the complaint and
15 supporting documentation filed with the notice of removal indicate that Rae sought $20,000 in
16 compensatory damages on all counts together”); Rae v. Perry, No. 8:09-cv-1549-T-30EAJ, 2009 WL
17 3430023, *2 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 21, 2009) (“In the complaint, Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in

The Court’s Order at page 6, footnote 2 states that the “Court does not consider Phelps’s post-removal
stipulation to limit his individual recovery to $75,000 because facts are determined at the time of removal and generally
post-removal acts do not oust the court of jurisdiction.” This same analysis should be applied to whether removal is
objectively reasonable for purposes of an award of attorneys’ fees.
8

For purposes of determining whether Cox met the amount in controversy requirement by a preponderance of

23 the evidence for removal only (and not attorneys’ fees) the Court distinguished Rile, Rivera, and Simmons, the cases

relied upon by Cox. Rile v. STRS Ohio CA Real Estate Investment 1, LLC, No. 09-05634, 2010 WL 1838965, *3 (N.D.

24 Cal. May 3, 2010); Rivera v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. C 08-02202CW, 2008 WL 2740399, *5 (N.D. Cal. July 11,
2008); Simmons v. PCR Technology, 209 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1034-35 (N.D. Cal. 2002). The Court said: “In those three

25 cases, the actual damages were significantly higher than Phelps’s $6,000 to 9,000 in unpaid wages (Rile – $11,000 in
rent, plus relocation costs and medical expenses; Rivera - $52,000; Simmons - $51,200).” [Dkt. # 35, Dec. 22, 2011

26 Order, p. 7.) However, unlike these three cases where the amount of damages or some portions thereof was known at the
27

time of removal, Cox did not know that Phelps had at most a $9,000 wage claim at the time of removal. [See Dkt. # 1,
Ex. A, Compl.]

1 specific amount of damages (i.e., $6,000 to $9,000) was after Cox filed its Petition for Removal.
2 [Dkt. # 17, Mot. to Remand, pp. 2, 3.] Therefore, it is fundamentally unfair to find that Cox had an
3 unreasonable basis for removal based on facts that were learned by Cox post removal (i.e., the
4 $6,000 to $9,000 claim). For this reason, the award of attorneys’ fees should not be based on
5 Phelps’s post removal damages claim.

The Valdez Lawsuit provided an objectively reasonable basis for
determining the amount in controversy at the time of removal where
the Complaint was silent and the $6,000 to $9,000 post-removal
damages claim was unknown to Cox
The Valdez settlement offer

Notwithstanding that the silence of Phelps’s Complaint as to the amount in controversy
demonstrates that Cox had an objectively reasonable basis for removal at the time it filed its
Petition for Removal on May 17, 2011 sufficient to warrant the Court’s denial of attorneys’ fees,
Cox had an additional objectively reasonable basis for its removal – its experience with the Valdez
Lawsuit.
The Valdez Lawsuit is highly instructive for purposes of amount in controversy because the
claims and damages for which Phelps seeks to hold Cox liable in this lawsuit are exactly the same as
the claims and damages sought in the Valdez Lawsuit. In this regard, Phelps’s single claim in this
lawsuit under N.R.S. § 608.150 seeks to hold Cox liable for the indebtedness of its contractor, MC
Communications. [Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, Compl. pp. 5-6.] According to Phelps’s Motion to Remand,
Cox’s alleged liability for MC Communications’ “indebtedness” would include the claims and
damages sought by Phelps in the MC Lawsuit. [See Dkt. # 17, Mot. to Remand, p. 12.] The claims
and damages in the MC Lawsuit include alleged: unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime,
liquidated damages, attorney’s fees, costs and interest. [See Ex. J hereto ¶ 25.]
Indeed, the Valdez Complaint and the Phelps Complaint against MC Communications are the
same. In the Valdez Lawsuit, Valdez asserts a claim under the FLSA for which he seeks:
a judgment for unpaid overtime wages and/or unpaid minimum wages, and additional
liquidated damages of 100% of any unpaid minimum wages and/or overtime wages,
such sums to be determined based upon an accounting of the hours worked by, and
wages actually paid to the named plaintiff and any such other persons who consent to
join this action, and … an award of attorney’s fees, interest and costs as provided for

by the FLSA.
(See Ex. B hereto, ¶ 27.) Just like the Valdez Complaint, the Complaint filed by Phelps in the MC
Lawsuit asserts a claim under the FLSA for which he seeks:
a judgment against all defendants for unpaid overtime wages and/or unpaid minimum
wages, and additional liquidated damages of 100% of any unpaid minimum wages
and/or overtime wages, such sums to be determined based upon an accounting of the
hours worked by, and the wages actually paid to the named plaintiff and any such
other persons who consent to join this action, and … an award of attorney’s fees,
interest and costs as provided for by the FLSA.
(See Ex. J hereto, ¶ 25.) Valdez asserts a claim under N.R.S. § 608.018 for which he seeks:
a judgment against defendants for overtime wages, such sums to be determined based
upon an accounting of the hours worked by, and the wages actually paid to, the
plaintiff, and … an award of attorney’s fees, interest and costs, as provided for by
Nevada law.

(See Ex. J hereto, ¶ 28.) Valdez asserts a claim under N.R.S. § 608.040 for which he seeks:
a judgment against the defendants … for the penalty prescribed by Nevada Revised
Statutes § 608.040, to wit, for a sum equal to up to thirty days wages, along with
interest, costs and attorney’s fees, on behalf of himself and the members of the

Nevada Revised Statutes § 608.040, to wit, for a sum equal to up to thirty days wages,
along with interest, costs and attorney’s fees, on behalf of himself and the members of
the putative plaintiff class.
(See Ex. J hereto, ¶ 32.) Finally, the N.R.S. § 608.150 claim asserted by Phelps and Valdez is the

23
same. Valdez contends in his complaint:
24
25
26
27

Pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes § 608.150 the defendant, COX, was acting as a
general, or superior contractor, for the plaintiff’s installation or construction services
by engaging the defendants VIP, QUALITY, SIERRA AND PARADIGM as
subcontractors to perform such installation or construction services and is liable to the
plaintiff and the members of the putative class for all unpaid wages owed to them for
performing such services.

Pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes § 608.150 the defendant, Cox, was acting as an
“original” contractor of the services provided by the plaintiff and the putative class
members that are alleged in paragraph 22 by engaging MC as its subcontractor or
other contractor to perform such services and is liable to the plaintiff and the
members of the putative class for all unpaid wages owed to them for performing such
services.

6 [Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, ¶ 24.] Although the Court said in its Order that the Valdez Lawsuit is not
7 analogous because it involved four claims while the Phelps litigation involved one single claim, Cox
8 is liable for the exact same four claims as it was in the Valdez Lawsuit due to the two-tiered nature
9 of the N.R.S. § 608.150 claim. [See Dkt. # 35, Dec. 22, 2011 Order, p. 7.] Phelps confirmed this
10 when he said “[t]he merits of [Plaintiff’s] individual claim against [Cox] should not be determined
11 until such litigation against MC is resolved.” [Dkt. # 17, Mot. to Remand, p. 12.] Therefore, given
12 that identical claims and damages are alleged in both the Valdez Lawsuit and the MC Lawsuit, Cox
13 reasonably relied upon its experience in the Valdez Lawsuit in asserting that the amount in
14 controversy in this action would exceed $75,000 for Phelps individually.
15

Significantly, Valdez sought well in excess of $75,000 for his individual damages just

16 against Cox. Approximately one year after the Valdez Complaint was filed, on August 24, 2010,
17 Mr. Greenberg sent a settlement proposal in the amount of $300,000 to Cox on behalf of Valdez,
18 individually, and explicitly stated:
19
20
21
22
23
24

I am, at the request of plaintiff Joe Valdez, communicating the following settlement
proposal:
A payment to Joe Valdez, individually, of $300,000 from each defendant, in
exchange for a settlement of all claims that he, personally, possesses against the
defendants.
The foregoing settlement proposal is made on behalf of Joe Valdez as an individual
and is not presented as a proposal for the settlement of the putative class claims or
FLSA collective action claims or the claims of any other persons made in this
litigation.

25 (See Declaration of Annette A. Idalski [“Idalski Dec.”], attached as Exhibit L, at ¶ 4 and Ex. 1
26 thereto.)9 The offer of settlement of $300,000 is more than three times the required amount in

The same settlement proposal of $300,000 was made to each of the other three subcontractor defendants of
Cox. (See id.) In total, from all four defendants, Valdez sought $1.2 million dollars. (See id.)

1 controversy ($75,000) and does not breakdown damages and attorneys’ fees.
2

Valdez’s settlement demand provides critical evidence and a reasonable basis for removal

3 given that the same claims are at issue and based on Cox’s research regarding Valdez and Phelps’s
4 earnings. Phelps is seeking to recover for a longer period of time than Valdez. In this regard,
5 Phelps’s Complaint against MC Communications was filed on or around February 11, 2011, and
6 Phelps’s employment with MC Communications terminated in June 2009. (See Ex. J hereto; Dkt. #
7 1, Ex. C, ¶ 3.) Phelps alleges willful violations of the FLSA, thus allowing for a three year statute of
8 limitations, and equaling approximately eighteen (18) months for which Phelps seeks damages
9 against MC Communications (from February 11, 2008 through June 2009). (See Ex. J hereto, ¶¶ 22,
10 24.) In the Valdez Lawsuit, Valdez was employed by Quality for approximately 17 months (from
11 January 25, 2006 through March 31, 2007 and again from October 2008 through January 5, 2009).
12 (See Deposition of Joseph Valdez [“Valdez Dep.”] 327:22-328:5; 336:1-7.)10 Based on a three year
13 statute of limitations and the date Valdez filed his complaint (August 18, 2009), Valdez could seek,
14 at most, ten and a half months of alleged unpaid wages from Quality. (See Exs. A and B hereto.)
15 Valdez was employed as an installer by Sierra for only five months (from January 4, 2007 until
16 February 2007, and November 2007 through February 4, 2008), and was employed by VIP for only
17 six months (from February 2009 through July 2009). (Valdez Dep. 146:19-147:5; 348:22-349:5;
18 367:11-16; 368:8-18; 370:8-371:2).
19

Moreover, Valdez and Phelps’s average weekly wages were comparable. For example,

20 Valdez earned an average of approximately $607 per week while working for Quality from October
21 31, 2008 through January 2009, according to Valdez’s pay stubs attached to the Affidavit of Brady
22 Wells, Quality’s Vice President.11 Cox researched Phelps’s wages by contacting John Wehrman,
23 Chief Financial Officer of MC Communications. Mr. Wehrman testified that Phelps earned wages
24 amounting to $474.05 per week on average although this amount fluctuated. [Dkt. # 1, Ex. C, ¶ 4.]

Given the same claims, similar weekly earnings and that Phelps is seeking to recover for a

2 longer time period than Valdez, Cox had a reasonable basis to believe that the amount in controversy
3 requirement would be met in this case based on Valdez’s $300,000 individual settlement demand.
4 Because Valdez failed to break down this $300,000 offer into damages and attorneys’ fees, it is not
5 possible for Cox to do so. For removal, Cox need not establish the exact amount in controversy, but
6 instead must show that the amount in controversy will, more likely than not, exceed $75,000.
7 Guglielmino v. McKee Foods Corp., 506 F.3d 696, 701 (9th Cir. 2007). The same must be true as to
8 whether the removal was objectively reasonable.
9

“A settlement offer is relevant evidence of the amount in controversy if it appears to reflect a

10 reasonable estimate of the plaintiff’s claim.” See Cohn v. Petsmart, Inc., 281 F.3d 837, 839-40 (9th
11 Cir. 2002); Krajca v. Southland Corp., 206 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1081-82 (D. Nev. 2002) (Pro, J.)
12 (citing Cohn and holding that amount in controversy requirement was met where settlement letter
13 indicated that more than $75,000 in damages were at issue and where discovery responses revealed
14 that the plaintiffs’ damages were well in excess of $75,000); Arellano v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.,
15 245 F. Supp. 2d 1102, 1108 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (stating that “Home Depot relies exclusively upon [the
16 plaintiff’s] demand letter to establish the amount in controversy” and holding that amount in
17 controversy was met where demand letter sought “either $70,000 and immediate reinstatement, or
18 $95,000 and the ‘cleansing’ of [the plaintiff’s] personnel file”); Rile v. STRS Ohio CA Real Estate
19 Investment 1, LLC, No. 09-05634, 2010 WL 1838965, *2 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2010) (pre-removal
20 settlement demand of $75,000 established amount in controversy where the plaintiff’s complaint did
21 not specify particular amount of damages sought).

If this evidence is relevant to amount in

22 controversy requirements for removal purposes, it should certainly be sufficient to meet the
23 “objectively reasonable basis” standard regarding attorneys’ fees awards. While this $300,000
24 settlement offer was made on behalf of Valdez, a non-plaintiff, it is objectively reasonable to
25 conclude that the amount in controversy could be met due to the similarity between Valdez and
26 Phelps’s claims and work history.
27

Indeed, comparisons of fee awards and jury verdicts in similar cases can be the basis for

1 establishing the amount in controversy.

Filed 01/04/12 Page 19 of 27

In Flores v. Standard Ins. Co., the defendant argued that

2 the amount in controversy was established based, in part, on the punitive damages the plaintiff may
3 recover. No. 3:09-cv-00501-LRH-RAM, 2010 WL 185949, *5-6 (D. Nev. Jan. 15, 2010). Noting
4 that the “exact amount [of punitive damages] sought is unclear,” the court stated that “[t]o establish
5 the likely amount of punitive damages, the defendant may introduce evidence of jury verdicts in
6 cases involving similar facts.” Id. at *5. Based on the defendant’s identification of punitive
7 damages awards in similar cases, the court upheld removal. Id. at *6 (“Although the facts of the
8 cited cases are not identical to the facts now before the court, the jury verdicts in these cases amply
9 demonstrate the potential for large punitive damages awards in bad faith insurance cases.”). See also
10 Rivera, 2010 WL 2740399 at *4 (holding that the defendant established that the plaintiff’s alleged
11 emotional distress and punitive damages could be substantial by introducing evidence of verdicts in
12 similar cases). Likewise, in Simmons v. PCR Technology, the Court relied on experience with like
13 claims to determine that the amount in controversy requirement was met. 209 F. Supp. 2d 1029,
14 1035 (N.D. Cal. 2002). Although the court did not reach an exact dollar figure in upholding
15 removal, it stated that based on its experience, “attorneys’ fees in individual discrimination cases
16 often exceed the damages”. Id. at 1035. See also Brady v. Mercedes-Benz USA, Inc., 243 F. Supp.
17 2d 1004, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2002) (holding that the defendant established that the plaintiff’s attorney’s
18 fees would meet the amount in controversy requirement by presenting evidence of the hourly rate of
19 the plaintiff’s counsel as well as evidence of fee awards in similar cases). For all of these reasons,
20 Cox had an objectively reasonable basis for removal based on the Valdez Lawsuit.

ii.

A likelihood of substantial attorneys’ fees based on the Valdez
Lawsuit and others

In calculating the amount in controversy for purposes of removal, Cox drew upon its

24 experience with Mr. Greenberg, and determined that the attorneys’ fees would be substantial. In the
25 Valdez Lawsuit, Valdez’s attorneys’ fees were in the six figure range.

(See July 28, 2011

1 RJJ, United States District Court for the District of Nevada, a lawsuit filed for unpaid wages after
2 Dent had already waived those claims through his settlement via the U.S. Department of Labor, the
3 attorneys’ fees alleged to have been incurred with respect to Dent individually based on the
4 Settlement filed with the Court were $43,000 even though defendants’ motion to dismiss the action
5 as to the federal claims was granted.12

Additionally, based on Cox’s research of Plaintiff’s

6 Counsel’s attorneys’ fees in similar wage cases, Mr. Greenberg and his co-counsel obtained court7 approved attorneys’ fees of almost a million dollars - e.g., $923,761. See August 25, 2008 Order in
8 Westerfield v. Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Inc., Civil Action No. cv-S-05-1264-JCM-PAL, United
9 States District Court for the District of Nevada, attached as Exhibit “E” to Cox’s Petition for
10 Removal.
11

Attorneys’ fees would surely be substantial in this case given Cox’s recent experience with

12 this same claim and Mr. Greenberg in the Valdez Lawsuit. There, the N.R.S. § 608.150 claim failed
13 as a matter of law and Mr. Greenberg filed numerous motions seeking to overturn the ruling
14 requiring the briefing of at least four separate motions, including but not limited to, a motion to
15 reargue, a motion to remand, a motion to certify the issue to the Nevada Supreme Court and, most
16 recently as of December 22, 2011, a motion to reinstate the already adjudicated claim in Nevada
17 state court. (See Exs. D, F, and I hereto.) Because this claim has no merit based on the Valdez
18 Lawsuit, Phelps, like Valdez, will likely be the only plaintiff.
19

Given these litigation realities and the unique circumstances present here, it is hard to

20 imagine how Cox’s reliance on its experience cannot be an objectively reasonable basis for removal.
21 Phelps argued and the Court found that Cox could not meet the amount in controversy, in part,
22 because attorneys’ fees would need to be apportioned among Phelps and the putative class members.
23 While this may warrant a remand given the preponderance of the evidence standard, Cox submits
24 that this fact does not warrant an attorneys’ fees award. As the Ninth Circuit recognized in Lussier
25 v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., “removal is not objectively unreasonable solely because the removing

1 party’s arguments lack merit, or else attorneys’ fees would always be awarded whenever remand is
2 granted.” 518 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir. 2008). “Although no bright line rule emerges, courts that
3 have applied the Martin standard seem to focus upon whether the removing party has offered a
4 credible reason for the removal, even if it turns out by subsequent events that the removing party was
5 wrong on the facts or was wrong on the law.” See Fernandez v. Pilot Travel Centers, LLC, No.
6 5:07-cv-359-Oc-10GRJ, 2007 WL 3379848, *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 14, 2007)
7

In the same vein, courts have refused to award attorneys’ fees based on incorrect calculations

8 regarding the amount in controversy. In City of San Antonio v. Time Warner Cable, the defendant
9 removed a mandamus action in which no monetary demand was made and even though the
10 defendant was incorrect in calculating the amount in controversy, attorneys’ fees were not awarded.
11 No. SA-09-CV-869-XR, 2009 WL 4878647, *2 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 11, 2009). The defendant argued
12 that, because the City sought to conduct an audit of the defendant’s financial records, “the
13 consequences that may result from the litigation exceed the minimal jurisdictional requirement.” Id.
14 In support of its removal, the defendant “included a copy of a Payment Summary Sheet that details
15 the franchise fees paid to the City from 2006 through 2008,” and that “[e]ach franchise payment
16 alone is in excess of $75,000.” Id. The court rejected the defendant’s argument, stating that
17 “[w]hile it is undisputed that TWC has paid millions to the City, those amounts are not the subject of
18 this controversy. The City is not challenging the validity of those payments nor is it seeking unpaid
19 taxes or fees. The City merely seeks an audit of financial records in accordance with state law.” Id.
20 Although the court found removal to be improper, it refused to award the plaintiff its attorneys’ fees
21 associated with remand, stating that “this Court can see how the Defendants had objectively
22 reasonable grounds to believe that removal was legally proper based on the amount in controversy”.
23 Id. at *4.
24

Likewise, in Gregory v. Fidelity Nat. Title Ins. Co., the defendant alleged that the amount in

25 controversy would exceed $75,000 because the plaintiff was seeking attorneys’ fees related to two
26 separate lawsuits. No. 10-cv-02722-RED-MEH, 2011 WL 3608444, *2-3 (D. Colo. Aug. 16, 2011).
27 The court found that state law authorized recovery of attorneys’ fees in only one action and did not

1 permit the plaintiff to recover attorneys’ fees in the case at bar. Id. at *2. As a result, the court
2 stated that the defendant’s “calculation improperly considers the plaintiffs’ attorney fees in this case
3 as part of the amount in controversy” and ordered the case remanded. Id. Notwithstanding the
4 defendant’s improper inclusion of attorneys’ fees in calculating the amount in controversy, the court
5 declined to award attorneys’ fees related to the remand, and stated that “even though the defendant
6 ultimately did not satisfy its burden to demonstrate the amount in controversy, I conclude that the
7 defendant had an objectively reasonable basis on which to seek removal.” Id. at *3.
8

Unlike the defendants in Yazzie v. Celadon Trucking Services, Inc., who simply removed

9 based on “information and belief” and submitted no evidence prior to removing the action, Cox had
10 an identical case from which to measure the amount in controversy based on a settlement demand,
11 had conducted an investigation of Phelps’s alleged damages and had direct experience with
12 attorneys’ fees and damages settlements of Mr. Greenberg. See Yazzie v. Celadon Trucking
13 Services, Inc., No. CV-09-8198-PHX-GMS, 2010 WL 749639, *2 (D. Ariz. Mar. 3, 2010). For all
14 of these reasons, Cox had an objectively reasonable basis for removal, and, therefore, the attorneys’
15 fee award against Cox should be reversed.

3.

Cox Did Not Misrepresent Gibson

Contrary to Phelps’s accusations in his Reply brief in support of his Motion to Remand, Cox

18 did not “misrepresent” the Gibson case when it said: “attorneys’ fees related to the class claims
19 asserted in Plaintiff’s Complaint are properly included in calculating the amount in controversy.”
20 [Dkt. # 26, p. 12.] Cox submits that this sentence was taken out of context. A review of Cox’s
21 Petition for Removal, Phelps’s Motion to Remand, Cox’s Response to Phelps’s Motion to Remand,
22 and Phelps’s Reply in Support of his Motion to Remand illustrates this point. The parties’ argument
23 focused solely on whether attorneys’ fees could be included in the first place based on a relevant
24 statute.
25

Cox’s Argument - Petition For Removal. Phelps sought attorneys’ fees in the Complaint.

26 [Dkt. # 1, Ex. A, Compl., ¶ 25.] Not only does Phelps seek attorneys’ fees in this action, but he
27 contends that Cox is liable for attorneys’ fees in the underlying federal court action because Cox is

4 amount in controversy. [Dkt. # 1, ¶¶ 13-14.]

2. Because the Plaintiff Does Not Sue Under a Statute Providing For an Award
of Attorneys’ Fees a Potential Attorney’s Fee Award is Not Part of the Amount
in Controversy
…Defendant ignores that there is no statutory claim for attorney’s fees in this case!
The “underlying statute” in this case and the sole basis upon which plaintiff brings
suit is N.R.S. § 608.150. That statute does not provide for an award of attorney’s
fees. A generalized demand in a complaint for attorney’s fees, not based upon any
express grant of such fees as a matter of statute or contract, is not part of the amount
in controversy. See, Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. McKinnon Motors, 329 F.3d 805, n.4
(11th Cir. 2003) and cases cited therein. Accordingly, there is no potential attorney’s
fee award to the plaintiff that can be considered in determining whether the amount in
controversy requirement is met.

20
21
22
23

25

3. The Potential Award of Attorney’s Fees From A Class Action Recovery is Not
Part of the Amount in Controversy for Jurisdictional Purposes
Defendant asserts that plaintiff’s proposed class action under NRCP Rule 23 presents
attorney’s fee claims that would meet the amount in controversy requirements. That
assertion is indisputably false as a matter of law. Potential attorney’s fee awards in
class actions are not considered in determining whether the amount in controversy
requirements are met. See, Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U.S. 291 (1973)
Goldberg v. CPC International, 678 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1982) and Kanter v. WarnerLambert Co., 265 F.3d 853 (9th Cir. 2001). Although not applicable, as no such fee
award is possible, statutory attorney’s fee awards, when made in a class case, are also
not properly included in the amount in controversy. See, also, Gibson v. Chrysler
Corp., 261 F.3d 927, 942-43 (9th Cir. 2001) (Reexamining Goldberg and reaffirming
that class awards of statutory attorney’s fees cannot be attributed to the individual
bringing the class case for amount in controversy purposes).

26
[Dkt. # 17, Mot. to Remand, p. 4.] Both of the points Phelps makes in Sections 2 and 3 of his
27

Motion to Remand are incorrect. Indeed, Phelps alleges that Cox is liable for attorneys’ fees under

1 the FLSA in the underlying litigation. Additionally, given Phelps’s admission in his Motion to
2 Remand that his damages amounted to no more than $9,000, Phelps could also recover under
3 Nevada Revised Statutes § 18.010.13
4

Cox’s Argument - Opposition to Phelps’s Motion to Remand. In its Response to Phelps’s

5 Motion to Remand where Phelps clearly misinterprets the law regarding attorneys’ fees in this case,
6 Cox sought to correct Phelps’s baseless arguments. Cox said in pertinent part:
To the contrary, the attorneys’ fees related to the class claims asserted in Plaintiff’s
Complaint are properly included in calculating the amount in controversy. Gibson v.
Chrysler Corp., 261 F.3d 927 (9th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff has taken the untenable
position, both in his Motion to Remand and in his counsel’s letters (Exs. 3, 5, 7
hereto), that “[p]otential attorney’s fees awards in class actions are not considered in
determining whether the amount in controversy requirements are met.” [Dkt. #16, p.
4]. That is not the law and none of the cases Plaintiff cites supports such a blatant
misrepresentation. Zahn v. Int’l Paper Co. held that each plaintiff in a class action
“must satisfy the jurisdictional amount, and any plaintiff who does not must be
dismissed from the case.” 414 U.S. 291, 301 (1973).

7
8
9
10
11
12

13 [Dkt. # 26, pp. 12-13.] Therefore, when read in context, Cox was merely pointing out that attorneys’
14 fees are properly included in calculating the amount in controversy and that Phelps’s statement that
15 attorneys’ fees must be totally excluded in class actions is wrong. Cox cited to the cases Plaintiff
16 relied upon – including Gibson – to generally show that attorneys’ fees were included in the amount
17 in controversy.
18

Phelps’s Argument – Reply to Motion to Remand. In his Reply, Phelps again misstates the

19 law concluding that attorneys’ fees under N.R.S. § 18.010 (2)(a) are not recoverable in class actions:
The only basis that defendant proffers for a statutory award of attorney’s fees in this
case is N.R.S. § 18.010(2)(a). As discussed, infra, such claim is disingenuous and
absurd as the Nevada Supreme Court has expressly held that attorney’s fees cannot be
awarded under N.R.S. § 18.010 (2)(a) in class actions. See, Schouweiler v. Yancey

20
21
22
23

13

This Court agreed with Cox, not Phelps, and stated in its Order:
Nevada Revised Statutes § 18.010 authorizes the court to award attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff
that recovers no more than $20,000. Furthermore, pursuant to § 18.010, attorney’s fees can be
recovered in class actions when recovery does not exceed $20,000. See Izumi, 2011 WL 5854618, at
*2, n.1. Here, Plaintiff seeks $6,000 to $9,000, in damages; therefore, if Plaintiff ultimately prevails
and recovers $20,000 or less, the Court may award attorneys’ fees under § 18.010.

Co., 712 P.2d 786, 788 (Nev. Sup. Ct. 1985).

2 [Dkt. # 29, Reply to Mot. to Remand, p. 4.] Then, Phelps wholly misconstrued Cox’s simple
3 assertion that statutory attorneys’ fees can be used to calculate the amount in controversy claiming
4 that Cox failed to recognize apportionment.

Phelps accused Cox of “making a blatant

5 misrepresentation of the law”. [Dkt. # 29, Reply to Mot. to Remand, p. 2.] Phelps said: “Defendant
6 in this case, exactly like defendant Chrysler in Gibson, advances the “sole argument” that a class
7 award of attorney’s fees must be attributed to plaintiff Phelps individually for amount in controversy
8 purposes. Such argument is not only incorrect, it is abusive, frivolous and made in bad faith in light
9 of the clear holdings in Gibson and Kanter.” [Dkt. # 29, Reply to Mot. to Remand, p. 6.] However,
10 this is the perfect example of the “pot calling the kettle black.” Phelps incorrectly argued that
11 attorneys’ fees cannot be included in the amount in controversy at all, whether by apportionment or
12 otherwise, even though he sought attorneys’ fees in his Complaint and sought to hold Cox liable for
13 the attorneys’ fees under the FLSA in the MC Lawsuit. [Dkt. # 17, Mot. to Remand, pp. 3-4.] Then,
14 when Cox argues in response that attorneys’ fees can be included, Phelps accuses Cox of
15 misrepresenting the law by twisting its statement to a reference to apportionment that does not exist.
16 [Dkt. # 29, Reply to Mot. to Remand, pp. 2-6.] Cox only intended to refute Phelps’s argument that
17 attorneys’ fees could not be used to calculate the amount in controversy – nothing more; nothing
18 less. Cox did not state whether all or a portion of the attorneys’ fees should be considered because
19 this was not the point Cox was making. Cox’s point was simply that attorneys’ fees should be
20 included in the amount in controversy.
21

Cox was concerned about Phelps’s false accusations against Cox when it first read his Reply

22 brief at the time it was served. Cox should have filed a sur-reply at that time to clarify its position to
23 eliminate this confusion. (See Idalski Dec. ¶ 5.) Cox respectfully requests that the Court accept
24 Cox’s explanation of this statement as it was intended, and that this misunderstanding should not be
25 a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees.
