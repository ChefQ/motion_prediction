MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside is fatally deficient in that it fails to address the substantive
and procedural arguments which led to the dismissal of the most recent complaint filed by
Plaintiffs, fails to cite the appropriate standard and relies upon failed legal theories. In short, this
Motion does not state any valid grounds which would warrant setting aside the Court's Dismissal
of the complaint against these defendants.

Plaintiffs' litigious tendencies with regard to this property are abundantly clear upon a
review of the storied history of this litigation. Back in August of 2008, Plaintiff Kathryn
Wolverton ("Wolverton") brought a similar action related to the same Deed of Trust, and
Property related to this action. That case named MERS as a defendant and included various
nearly identical causes of action. See, Case No. 2:08-cv-01168-JCM-RJJ. The Complaint was

eventually dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a stipulation of the parties. See, Case NO. 2:08-

cv-01168-JCM-RJJ (hereinafter "2008 Litigation"), stipulation at DE #37. Then in March of
2010, Plaintiff brought this suit under the guise of a slightly different, but equally meritless case
which re-asserts many of the claims already dismissed with prejudice against MERS defendants.
In addition, this case included two additional Plaintiffs, whose role is largely inexplicable. In
light of this Court's dismissal of Wolverton's previous lawsuit with prejudice, which focused on
the same subject loan and Property, the current action is precluded on the basis of res judicata and
estoppel. See Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201-02 (9th Cir.1982) (barring
under res judicata all claims based on the same "transactional nucleus of facts" which "could have
been asserted, whether they were or not, in a prior suit between the same parties") (citation
omitted). In addition to the fact that many of these claims are barred by estoppel principals,
theses claims were legally deficient and devoid of any factual basis. As such, HSBC, MERS and
Deutsche Bank filed a Motion to Dismiss clearly setting forth the grounds for dismissal of each
and every cause of action contained in the form complaint. Plaintiff failed to oppose the Motion,
further the Court the granted the Motion in full. Plaintiff's current Motion to Set Aside Dismissal
fails to set forth any grounds sufficient to warrant setting aside this dismissal.

As such, Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside Default must be denied.

IL.
UNDISPUTED FACTS

The subject property related to this action is located at 230 W Highland Drive, Henderson,
Nevada, 89015, APN: 179-19-211-009 (the "Property"). Wolverton acquired the Property in
2005, as evidenced by a Grant, Bargain, Sale Deed recorded on December 20, 2005. Because the
detailed factual history related to the property was fully set forth in the Motion to Dismiss,
Defendants will not now waste judicial resources by reasserting all transactions related to the
property. Instead, Defendants will refer to the fact section located in the Motion to Dismiss.
(Docket #21.) Further, the facts related to this litigation's history will be fully set forth herein.

Wolverton initiated the original Complaint in August of 2008. See, 2:08-cv-01168-JCM-
RJJ. On August 21, 2008, National Default Servicing Corporation, as trustee, recorded a Notice

of Trustee Sale to occur on September 11, 2008, indicating the total unpaid balance on the Note

was $1,043,172.04. (See Notice of Trustee's Sale, Exhibit A). The 2008 Complaint was
eventually dismissed with prejudice via stipulation of the parties in July, 2009. See, 2:08-cv-
01168-JCM-RJJ, (Docket #37.). After the conclusion of the 2008 Litigation, NDSC recorded a
new Notice of Trustee Sale on September 22, 2009. (See Notice of Trustee's Sale, Exhibit B.)
As set forth in the Notice, the Property was sold to HSBC on October 22, 2009. (See Trustee's
Deed Upon Sale, Exhibit C.)

Then, on March 8, 2010, Plaintiffs filed this Complaint naming a slue of defendants
including, MERS, and others that were name in the previous complaint. MortgageIT removed
this matter to federal court on May 13, 2010. (Docket #1) MortgageIT then filed a Motion to
Dismiss the Complaint on May 24, 2010, seeking dismissal on procedural grounds of estoppel as
well as the lack of substantive merit of the case. (Docket # 4.) Plaintiffs failed to oppose the
Motion to Dismiss which was then granted by this Court on June 21, 2010. (Docket #19.)
Defendants HSBC, MERS, and Deutsche Bank filed a Motion to Dismiss on June 22, 2010.
(Docket #21.) Plaintiffs again failed to oppose this motion despite the Court's issuance of a
Klingele Order specifically setting fort the deadline in which to do so. (Docket #24.) The Court
then granted the Motion to Dismiss and released the lis pendens. (Docket #31.) Now, nearly a
month later, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal, which is devoid of any
valid ground warranting. As such, Defendants HSBC, MERS, and Deutsche Bank respectfully
request that this Motion be denied.

Il.
LEGAL ARGUMENT
A. Applicable Legal Standard for Relief From an Order Pursuant to NRCP 59 and 60

Plaintiffs fail to cite to any applicable standard for a motion to set aside the order of|
dismissal in their motion. Instead, they argue that a case should not be dismissed without
sufficient time for discovery, citing Vision Air. 121 Nev. 113 (2005.) However, Vision Air sets
forth an entirely distinct and inapplicable situation. There, the Court addressed whether a motion
for summary judgment should have been granted in light of a cross motion seeking a continuance

to develop facts in discovery. Id. Here instead, no discovery is necessary because Plaintiffs'

claims fail on their face, even accepting all allegations as true. Further, this standard is entirely
inapplicable in because Vision Air address summary judgment on appeal, not a motion to set
aside. Despite Plaintiff's failure to set forth any applicable standard, the relief sought by
Plaintiffs seems to be a request pursuant to Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b)(1). Assuming, arguendo,

that Rules 59 or 60 were referenced in the Motion for Consideration, the Motion would still fail.

Because a motion for reconsideration essentially seeks to re-litigate a matter already
decided by the Court, a party moving for reconsideration faces a high burden for relief. "`Under
Rule 59(e), a motion for reconsideration should not be granted, absent highly unusual
circumstances, unless the district court is presented with newly discovered evidence, committed
clear error, or if there is an intervening change in the controlling law.'" Brown's Crew Car of
Wyoming LLC v. Nevada Transportation Auth., No. 2:08-CV-0777-RLH-LRL, 2008 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 100172, at *2 (D. Nev. Dec. 11, 2008) (quoting 389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold, 179
F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir. 1999)).'

Other authorities have recognized the limited application of Rule 59(e) motions, which
offers an "extraordinary remedy, to be used sparingly in the interests of finality and conservation
of judicial resources." See 12 Moore's Federal Practice 0x00A7 59.30[4]. Accordingly, "a motion for
reconsideration should not be granted, absent highly unusual circumstances, unless the district
court is presented with newly discovered evidence, committed clear error, or if there is an
intervening change in the controlling law." See 389 Orange Street Partners v. Amold, 179 F.3d
656, 665 (9th Cir. 1991). A Rule 59(e) motion may not be used to raise arguments or present
evidence for the first time when they could have reasonably have been raised earlier in the
litigation. Id.; see also Moore, 92 Nev. at 405 (denying motion for reconsideration where it raised
no new law or facts and only cited additional authorities for propositions of law already set forth

in earlier motions).

 

" A motion for reconsideration may be brought pursuant to either Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs do not specify the Rule pursuant to which their motion was filed.

Case 2:10-cv-00700-PMP-PAL Document 37 _ Filed 08/31/10 Page 6 of 14

Similarly, a court may relieve a party from a final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) only

for the following reasons:

(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;

(2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence,
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
under Rule 59(b);

(3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic),
misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;

(4) the judgment is void;

(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is
based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or
applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or

(6) any other reason that justifies relief.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). See also Stankic v. Director, Nevada Dep't of Corr., No. 3:05-cv-
0347-ECR-RAM, No. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45067, at *1-2 (D. Nev. June 5, 2008) (denying
motion for reconsideration).

Plaintiff has failed to set forth any reason for relief from the judgment, much less reasons
sufficient to satisfy a burden under 59(e) or 60(b). Instead, Plaintiff delves into arguments that
amount to an untimely opposition by raising failed legal theories that even if considered under a
motion to dismiss standard, would not warrant denial of the Motion to Dismiss
B. NRCP 59(e) Is Inapplicable To This Case

As set forth above, Rule 59(e) is crafted to allow a party to petition the court in the event
that it discovers new and substantially relevant evidence that was not available at the time the
decision was made, or is able to demonstrate that the court committed clear error. In this case,
Plaintiffs fail to provide a single piece of new, let alone substantially relevant, evidence that was
not available at the time the decision was made. Instead Plaintiffs cite case law available well

before the Complaint' in this matter was even filed-which, regardless, is irrelevant to the inquiry

 

* Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff does cite one California case that came out in May, after the filing
of the Complaint, but before the Motion to Dismiss was filed or ruled on. Even that case law, however,
Plaintiff specifically points out simply "agreed with numerous other well-known cases that have held the

Case 2:10-cv-00700-PMP-PAL Document 37 _ Filed 08/31/10 Page 7 of 14

on a Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal. Plaintiff would have this Court set aside its ruling on the
Motion to Dismiss merely on the basis of that they are entitled to discovery in an attempt to.
Plaintiff does not introduce any new evidence or law and fails to articulate any basis for a
determination of clear error. Plaintiff, therefore, cannot rely on NRCP 59(e) in his effort to set

aside the Court's ruling, and the Motion should be denied in full

C. Plaintiff's Is Not Entitled To Relief Under Rule 60(b)

As stated above, the sole reasons for requesting relief from the order dismissing the claims
against HSBC, MERS and Deutsche Bank is that Plaintiff should be permitted to conduct
discovery in an attempt to require the parties to show the note. However, this "show the note
argument" is not novel, one that has been dismissed by Courts in case law available long before
the dismissal or the instant Motion, and certainly not grounds for additional discovery. This does
not permit dismissal under the standard for a Motion for Reconsideration under proper Rule 60(b)
standard.

The arguments asserted in Plaintiff's Motion, which essentially amount to an untimely
opposition, are entirely irrelevant to the inquiry under a Motion to Set Aside Standard. As set
forth above, under Rule 60(b) a party can seek relief from judgment based upon, "(1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable
diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3)
fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an
opposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or
discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it
prospectively is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief."

Plaintiffs have not provided a single reason set forth above that justify relief under Rule

 

same." Motion at 7.

60(b). Plaintiffs' arguments are based upon case law and legal principals which were available
at the time the opposition was due and available prior to the dismissal for the Court's
consideration. As such, simply incorporating arguments available at the time of dismissal that
amount to an opposition does not justify relief under Rule 60(b) since the Court already
considered those arguments. As such, Plaintiffs are not entitled to Reconsideration under Rule

60(b).

D. Plaintiffs Ignore the fact that MERS is Entitled to Dismissal, Because the Claims are
Largely Barred by Res Judicata

In addition to failing to state any valid grounds to set aside dismissal, Plaintiffs' motion
entirely ignores that fact that, as applied to MERS, Plaintiffs' claims are barred by principals of
res judicata. As briefly stated above, many of the claims asserted in this Complaint are barred by
principles of estoppel, or preclusion. MERS was named as a party to both Complaints. See,
2:08-cv-01168-JCM-RJJ, Docket #1, Ex. A, attached hereto as Exhibit D.) The 2008 Complaint
was based upon the same transaction as this-namely for the February 2007 loan transaction
secured by the property. Id. at | 1, 9. "Claim preclusion prevents the relitigation of claims
previously tried and decided." Clark v. Bear Stearns & Co., 966 F.2d 1318, 1320 (9th Cir.1992).
As such, the claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair deadline, injunctive relief,
declaratory relief, fraud and RESPA, which appear in both Complaints, required dismissal on
principals of res judicata.

In addition to the identical claims asserted, because the previous complaint focused on the
same subject loan and Property, the current action was precluded on the basis of res judicata and
estoppel. See Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201-02 (9th Cir.1982) (barring
under res judicata all claims based on the same "transactional nucleus of facts" which "could have
been asserted, whether they were or not, in a prior suit between the same parties") (citation
omitted).

Because all claims asserted in this case were based upon the same nucleus of facts-.e.

the February 2007 loan secured by the Subject property-as the 2008 Complaint which was

dismissed with prejudice, the claims asserted against MERS required dismissal on these grounds
alone.
Thus, even if Plaintiffs were successful in setting aside this particular dismissal, Plaintiffs

would still be barred by estoppel from asserting these claims against MERS.

E. Even if the Court Considers Plaintiffs ' Arguments Contained in the Motion as an
Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, this Dismissal was Still Proper.

Plaintiffs' Motion incorporates arguments that amount to an opposition to the Motion to
Dismiss. Plaintiffs arguments contained in the Motion, even if they were asserted timely, would

not give this court a reason to deny Defendants Motion to Dismiss.

1. Defendants are Not Required to Show the Note in Order to Properly
Foreclose

Plaintiffs' Motion argues that "none of the Defendants can prove that they are the current
holder in due course of the Note, any more than any other third party stranger to the transaction."
Motion at p. 3. However, this argument is disingenuous at best and cannot create the basis of
any of their claims. Defendants are unaware of, and Plaintiff has not cited, any authority that (i)
requires the loan servicer to produce the original promissory note upon the request of the
borrower or (ii) requires the production of the note as a condition to commence non-judicial
foreclosure proceedings. Wolverton herself granted authority to initiate foreclosure under the
Deed of Trust. Nevada law provides that a deed of trust may be used to "secure the performance
of an obligation or the payment of any debt." NRS 0x00A7 107.020. Upon default by the borrower, the
trust beneficiary may satisfy the debt obligation through the transfer of the collateral at a non-
judicial trustee's sale. NRS 0x00A7 107.080. When Plaintiff executed the Deed of Trust, Plaintiff
authorized the foreclosure of the Property as an express term and condition of receiving financing

for the Property in March 2006. See, Ex. D to Motion to Dismiss. ("Borrower irrevocably grants

. and conveys to Trustee, in trust, with power of sale, the following described property"). In

addition, Plaintiff is separately obligated under the First Deed of Trust to "pay when due the

"

principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note...." Plaintiff now seeks to

improperly unwind the foreclosure - a known consequence of the intentional decision to stop

making loan payments - and seek to have this Court effectively order that Plaintiff can
indefinitely suspend mortgage obligations while remaining in possession of the Property.

This Court has recognized that "[t]he statutes do not require a loan servicer to tender the
original note as proof of its status as holder in due course....""" Wayne v. HomeEg Servicing, Inc.,
Case No. 2:08-cv-00781-RCJ-LRL, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83324, *9 (D. Nev. Oct. 16, 2008).
This Court has dismissed, without leave to amend, a claim that foreclosing defendants had an
obligation to produce the original note before commencing the non-judicial foreclosure process.
See Ernestberg v. Mortg. Investors Group, Case No. 2:08-cv-01304-RCJ-RJJ, 2009 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 4560, *12-15 (D. Nev. Jan. 22, 2009). The actions of this Court are consistent with the
actions of other courts with regard to non-judicial foreclosures under trust deeds. See, e.g., Lopez
y. Chase Home Finance, LLC, Case No. CV F 09-0449 LJO GSA, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34647,
*13 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2009) (California law) (plaintiffs "promissory note possession notion is
frivolous"); Mansour v. Cal-Western Reconveyance Corp., Case No. CV-09-37-PHX-DGC, 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33280,*4 (D. Ariz. April 21, 2009) (applying Arizona law) (citing Nevada
cases because "Nevada's UCC enforcement statute is identical to Arizona's"). The weight of the
law requires the dismissal of this basis for a quiet title action, as there is no requirement that
Defendants produce the original note before commencing non-judicial foreclosure proceedings.
Because Wolverton authorized foreclosure sale upon her default, has failed to tender payments
when due, and because production of the note is not required to institute foreclosure proceedings,

these arguments fail.

2. Plaintiff's Fraud Claims are Not Plead with Sufficient Particularity and Not
Based upon Wrongdoing Committed by HSBC, MERS or Deutsche Bank

Plaintiff further argues that fraud is plead with sufficient particularity, essentially arguing
that without sufficient discovery, that this is the most specific Plaintiffs are able to get.
However, this type of pleading is not sufficient to support a fraud claim. First, as set forth above,
this claim as applied to MERS is barred by res judicata. Further, neither HSBC, MERS nor
