Case No. 3:03-CV-00174 RRB

RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION IN LIMINE TO
PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF PLAINTIFF’S EXERT, filed at Docket No. 36.
Introduction
Defendant, APC Natchiq, Inc. (APC) wants to prevent Plaintiff John Gilbert’s (Gilbert),
expert’s testimony. Gilbert propounds the expert testimony of Ms. Monte Jordan who worked
for the Alaska Department of Labor (DOL) for 26 years, and who was the Supervision Wage and
Hour Investigator when she retired. (Jordan CV, Exhibit 2)
APC claims that Gilbert’s expert does not meet the requirements for expert testimony:
reliability, relevance and helpfulness to the jury.

Although APC applies the wrong legal

standard, Ms. Jordan’s testimony could meet either of the two current tests for admitting expert
testimony.

Alaska Law Controls Admitting Experience Based Experts And Rejects Daubert
APC relies on Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), where the U.S.
Supreme Court established a requirement that the federal courts make a preliminary finding that
scientific evidence is reliable and relevant before allowing the testimony. The purpose was to
avoid “junk science” supporting lawsuits. Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. V. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137
(1999) extended this requirement to experienced based evidence. Kumho conflicts with Alaska
law. Alaska law controls the question. The Alaska Supreme Court expressly refused to extend
its adoption of the Daubert standard for scientific evidence to experience based evidence in
Marron v. Stromstad, 123 P.3d 992 (Alaska 1999); see also, Marsingill v. O’Malley, 128 P.3d
1

151, 160, n. 43 (Alaska 2006).

Section 137 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (Exhibit 1) says that, “The
local law of the forum determines what witnesses are competent to testify and the considerations
that may affect their credibility.” Cf., Equitable Life Assurance Soc. v. McKay, 861 F.2d 221,
223 (9th Cir. 1988)[Diversity case]
Applying the Admissibility Analysis to Ms. Jordan’s Described Testimony Can Pass
Either Test, but the Alaska Law Controls
APC acknowledges that Ms. Jordan is applying applicable statutes and regulations to the
facts in order to determine what money is due, and if an exemption is appropriate, in the same
manner as the Alaska DOL would have applied these rules had APC but asked for its advice.
(APC’s opening brief at 5) APC’s defense relies heavily on advice supposedly received by a Mr.
Nelson from another Alaska DOL employee, Mr. Carr. If what Mr. Carr said is relevant and

APC cites Vent v. State, 67 P. 3d 661, 667-8 (Alaska 2003). This was a scientific evidence case
applying the Daubert standard adopted in Alaska by State v. Coon, 974 P.2d 386 (Alaska 1999).
Vent is irrelevant to Ms. Jordan’s experience based expertise.

reliable, then so is what Ms. Jordan says about DOL policy, procedures, interpretations and
calculations. If Ms. Jordan is prohibited from testifying, then applying the same logic prohibits
any testimony about what Mr. Carr said or did. APC either proceeds to trial without reference to
Mr. Carr, or APC must accept Ms. Jordan’s testimony.
The Relevant Issues
This wage and hour case involves determinations of: willfulness, good faith,
reasonableness, Alaska DOL interpretations and application of its regulations, Alaska DOL
procedures, the assistance that Alaska DOL offers to employers, the manner Alaska DOL applies
facts to a given exemption, and the state of mind of APC’s witnesses when they determined
Gilbert was exempt from overtime pay.
Some of these issues are before the Court by motion. APC thinks they are questions of
law. (Docket 36-1 at 5) Gilbert disagrees. Summary Judgment is appropriate for Gilbert
because of the enhanced burden of proof on the employer. The best APC can hope for is to
establish that a reasonable jury could, applying the elevated burden of proof, find an issue of
fact, thus avoiding summary judgment against APC.2 Where there are disputes of fact, then the

2

In Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) the U.S.
Supreme Court considered the summary judgment issues of materiality and genuineness and
concluded that the substantive law determines which facts are material. Once it is determined
that a material fact is present, this Court must decide whether that material fact is "genuine." The
"genuine issue" summary judgment standard is very close to the "reasonable jury" directed
verdict standard. Summary Judgment is inappropriate if the evidence is such that a reasonable
jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. "Just as the convincing clarity requirement is
relevant in ruling on a motion for directed verdict, it is relevant in ruling on a motion for
summary judgment" Id. "Thus, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the judge must
view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden" Id.

issue must be tried and this expert witness’ testimony will be relevant and reliable.

3

APC proposes three witnesses who will testify about how they interpreted and applied the
federal and Alaska wage and hour laws. Gilbert wants to present a former employee of Alaska
DOL to testify about how the Alaska DOL interpreted and applied the federal and Alaska wage
and hour laws. If APC’s witnesses can testify, then Ms. Jordan should be permitted to explain to
the jury how the Alaska DOL does things and how the calculations should be made.
Applying Either Standard -- Ms. Jordan’s Testimony Is Admissible
The Daubert test, adopted by Alaska for scientific evidence in Coon, requires the Court
to make a threshold determination that the offered expert testimony is both reliable and relevant.
Coon, 974 P.2d at 390; quoting, Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 2796, 125 L. Ed.
2d 469, 482 (1993). Alaska’s more general test employs the same standard without applying the
scientific evidence factors. Once the evidence is determined to be reliable and relevant, it is
admitted if it can assist the jury.
Reliability
Alaska Rule of Evidence (ARE) 702 requires that the trial court determine the reliability
of expert testimony: the witness must be "qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,
training, or education." Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 702 requires that, "if . . . specialized
knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a
witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts

Ms. Jordan is also a fact witness when called to testify about matters within her personal
knowledge but that do not require her special expertise.

or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness
has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case".
Examining Ms. Jordan’s resume establishes that her testimony is reliable. (Exhibit &&)
Ms. Jordan started with the Alaska DOL as a Clerk IV in 1978 (Conducted claimant intake and
evaluation) and proceeded up the ladder to “Wage & Hour Technician” from 1982 until 1985,
“Wage & Hour Investigator I” from 1985 to 1990, and finally “Wage & Hour Supervising
Investigator” from 1990 to 2004 when she retired. In her final position as “Wage & Hour
Supervising Investigator,” Ms. Jordan investigated alleged violations and taught on the subject in
presentations and college seminars. Ms. Jordan’s expertise in the subject area, and the reliability
of her testimony, is unquestionable
Relevance
To be admissible, evidence need not be "directly relevant" to the fact that it seeks to
establish.

Both ARE 401 and FRE 401 define relevant evidence as evidence having the

"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." The Commentaries
to both Rules of Evidence stress that, "the standard of probability under the [r]ule is 'more . . .
probable than it would be without the evidence.' " The test in Alaska, "whether a person
qualifies as an expert is whether the jury can receive appreciable help from this particular person
on this particular subject." Barios v. Brooks Range Supply, Inc., 26 P.3d 1082, 1088 (Alaska
2001)
Contrary to APC’s suggestion, at Docket 36-1 at 6, that an expert is prohibited from
giving an opinion about the ultimate issue in the case, such opinions are expressly permitted both
in the commentary to Rule 401 (The fact to be proved may be ultimate, intermediate or

evidentiary; it matters not, so long as it is of consequence in the determination of the action), and
expressly by Rule 704, “. . . testimony . . . otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it
embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.”

4

Use of the words "any tendency" in Rule 401 suggests that the Court should err, in
doubtful cases, on the side of admissibility. To be relevant under either Rule, evidence need not
be direct or conclusive; it need only have some tendency to advance the proposition for which it
is offered.
Ms. Jordan’s testimony is relevant. APC identifies many of the relevant issues when it
discusses the assumptions necessary to determine if an exemption apples; when the employer
makes a mistake, if the mistake is willful; that record keeping requirements were not met; and
that liquidated damages are appropriate because APC did not act in good faith or was not
reasonable. APC further complains that Ms. Jordan will apply her knowledge and expertise to
“running the numbers” to show what the damages award should be. (Motion at Docket 36-1 at 7
– 8.)
APC’s witnesses will testify about how they, with less training and experience,
determined the identical issues. APC could provide contrary expert testimony if it could find a
qualified expert willing to so opine. Apparently, APC cannot.

APC cited McHugh v. United Serv. Auto. Ass'n, 164 F.3d 451 (9th Cir. 1999) as meaning that
Ms. Jordan cannot discuss the law. The regulations at issue were promulgated by both the
Alaska DOL and the federal DOL interpreting the statutes. Legislative, or substantive,
regulations are "issued by an agency pursuant to statutory authority and which implement the
statute, as, for example, the proxy rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission...
Such rules have the force and effect of law." Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 (U.S. 1977)
See also, Zuber v. APC Natchiq, Inc., 144 Fed. Appx. 657, 658 (9th Cir. 2005)(unpublished
opinion in companion case)[We must defer to Department of Labor regulations interpreting the
FLSA.] Ms. Jordan is applying the facts to the regulations she enforced for many years. Her
view of how the complex regulatory system applies is both highly relevant and helpful.

Ms. Jordan’s Testimony Will Be Helpful
APC identifies some of the relevant issues. Ms. Jordan’s testimony should be permitted
if it can help the jury to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. ARE 702. Even
applying APC’s Daubert/Kuhmo argument, rejection of the expert is the exception.
A review of the caselaw after Daubert shows that the rejection of expert
testimony is the exception rather than the rule. Daubert did not work a
''seachange over federal evidence law,'' and ''the trial court's role as gatekeeper is
not intended to serve as a replacement for the adversary system.'' . . .
Likewise, this amendment is not intended to provide an excuse for an automatic
challenge to the testimony of every expert. See, Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,
119 S.Ct. 1167, 1176 (1999) (noting that the trial judge has the discretion ''both to
avoid unnecessary 'reliability' proceedings in ordinary cases where the reliability
of an expert's methods is properly taken for granted, and to require appropriate
proceedings in the less usual or more complex cases where cause for questioning
the expert's reliability arises.'').
Commentary to FRE 702, 2000 Amendments (emphasis added).
The Ninth Circuit has said, “in considering the admissibility of testimony based on some
'other specialized knowledge,' Rule 702 generally is construed liberally." United States v.
Abonce-Barrera, 257 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir. 2001), citing, United States v. Hankey, 203 F.3d
1160, 1168 (9th Cir. 2000).
As the Daubert court said, “Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary
evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means
of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596, 113 S. Ct. at 2798; 125
L. Ed. 2d 485.
Application of Law to Fact
Expert testimony is admissible whenever it will assist the trier of fact. This case will go to the
jury for factual determinations to which the Court will apply the law or the jury will follow an

instruction about how to apply the law. Where an issue is decided following motion practice, it
will not be tried. Moreover, APC’s witnesses will be testifying about what APC did and why. As
a former Alaska DOL employee, Ms. Jordan will be able to enlighten the jury about the practices
of that agency, the agency’s interpretations of the complex rules, and what resources the agency
offers to employers facing the difficult issue of overtime exemptions.
Ms. Jordan is also familiar with, and experienced in, the process of calculating the
amounts due when applying the AWHA and FLSA. Contrary to APC’s claim that this is a
simple task, the application of the regulations to the numbers is only simple once done
repeatedly. This Court need only think of filling out tax forms, or applying Alaska’s Civil Rule
90.3 calculations concerning child support, to see where an expert with experience in “running
the numbers” can assist the jury.
An Analogy
APC’s argument is analogous to the argument that an expert cannot testify in a lawyer
misconduct case. Like APC, it could be argued that the judge is as competent to instruct the jury
about what lawyer conduct is ethical. The lawyer would argue, like Gilbert, that expert testimony
about how the facts apply to the rules is critical to developing the case. The Ninth Circuit
agrees:
It is well settled that in the prosecution of a lawyer for conduct stemming from his
or her representation of a client, expert testimony on the lawyer's ethical
obligations is relevant to establish the lawyer's intent and state of mind. See, e.g.,
United States v. Cavin, 39 F.3d 1299, 1309 (5th Cir. 1994) (reversing conviction
of attorney for fraud where district court excluded testimony of expert on
professional responsibility; . . . "[A] lawyer accused of participating in his client's
fraud is entitled to present evidence of his professional, including ethical,
responsibilities, and the manner in which they influenced him. Exclusion of such
evidence prevents the lawyer from effectively presenting his defense.") (citation
omitted) . . . "[O]ther circuits have also upheld the relevance of professional
standards for attorneys where offered by the Government to help prove criminal

intent on the part of lawyer-defendants. It would be incongruous to admit such
evidence when tendered in support of guilt, but not when offered for exculpatory
purposes."
United States v. Kellington, 217 F.3d 1084, 1098-1099 (9th Cir. 2000)
The “state of mind” of APC’s representatives is at issue, as is its reasonableness. APC’s
good faith and reasonableness defense, and its claim to have been counseled by a representative
of the Alaska DOL, are directly at issue. Gilbert’s claim of willful acts and that Alaska DOL
could have, and willingly would have, assisted APC in complying with the law, are all issues in
which Ms. Jordan’s knowledge and expertise will assist the jury.

APC proposes smilar

testimony by its employees to support its case. Excluding Ms. Jordan’s testimony will prejudice
Gilbert’s ability to present his case, unless APC is willing to omit such evidence from its
defense?
CONCLUSION
APC’s desire to exclude this expert runs foul of the function of the trial, to test each side's
contentions with cross-examination, opposing testimony and evidence. If the expert makes a
mistake, or if this Court finds that one of the assumptions leading to the present calculations is
wrong, then APC can challenge the calculation and use the change in position to what advantage
it can during cross.
Granting APC’s motion will unfairly benefit APC because its proposed witnesses will
testify about what APC did, or did not do, to comply with the law. Gilbert’s ability to test these
assertions, and offer contrary evidence, will be greatly diminished, and the truth seeking function
of the trial thwarted, unless Gilbert can show the jury his side of the story.
Applying the liberal philosophy of the F.R.E.’s, permitting evidence absent persuasive
reasons for exclusion, this expert meets both tests. Decisions about the scope of the witnesses’

testimony must await trial. It is premature to attempt to limit or shape that testimony until a real
trial with defined issues is imminent. APC has conceded the number of hours worked. When
this Court rules on the issues before it, there may be no need for Ms. Jordan to testify at all.
Until then, this motion to preclude Ms. Jordan’s testimony must be DENIED.
