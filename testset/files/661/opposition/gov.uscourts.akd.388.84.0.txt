Case No. 3:03-CV-00174 RRB

MOTION TO ACCEPT LATE FILING
COMES NOW Plaintiff, by and through counsel, THE LAW OFFICE OF KENNETH
L. COVELL, and hereby requests that the Court accept the one day late filing of his Response
in Opposition to Defendant's Motion in Limine to Preclude the Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert,
filed at docket no. 36.
The deadline for filing Plaintiff’s response was September 28, 2006, and was
inadvertently not filed due to Don Logan's unfamiliarity of office procedures during the
absence of Mr. Covell.

Mr. Logan attempted to contact defendant's counsel, but was

unsuccessful; however, counsel does not anticipate defendant to oppose.
