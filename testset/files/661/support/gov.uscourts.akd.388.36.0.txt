ARGUMENT.
A.

Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert
Will Not Assist Trier of Fact.

Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) Rule 702 states:

If
scientific,
technical,
or
other
specialized
knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand
the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a
witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education, may testify
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if
(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or
data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable
principles and methods, and (3) the witness has
applied the principles and methods reliably to the
facts of the case.

Fed. R. Evid. Rule 702 (emphasis added).
This rule is applied and defined in Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharm., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), where the court posited that the
initial step must be “a preliminary assessment of whether the
reasoning

and

of

whether

the

testimony

is

that

reasoning

or

methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.”
Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93.

Thus, while the Daubert court

initially focused on “scientific” testimony, the U.S. Supreme
Court’s holding in Daubert has subsequently been expanded to
require application of the standard of evidentiary reliability
to all expert testimony.
