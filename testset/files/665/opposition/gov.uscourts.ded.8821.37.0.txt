IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

Stanford L. Burris

Vv.

Plaintiff,
Civ. No. 04-1469-SLR

Richards Paving, Inc.

Defendant

DEFENDANT RICHARDS PAVING, INC.,'S

RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY

Defendant Richards Paving, Inc., (hereafter referred to as "Richards Paving')

hereby responds to plaintiff's motion to compel discovery. |

1.

Richards Paving has filed Answers to Plaintiff's second set of interrogatories as
well as answers to plaintiff's request for production of documents.

Out of respect for the privacy of its employees, Richards Paving objects to having
to disclose the name; address date of birth, date of hire and date of termination for
each individual that it has employed from 2003-2006.

Revised answers to plaintiff's discovery are being drafted and should be produced
to plaintiff's counsel by August 14, 2006, when the undersigned counsel returns
to the office. The revised answers should address plaintiff's concerns about
hourly wage of Richards Paving's employees.

Plaintiff's motion to compel the second set of interrogatories is also a bit
disingenuous since he has already elicited the hourly wage information from Mr.

Dave Moluski during his deposition testimony.

5. Furthermore, the deadline for obtaining any experts, economic or otherwise has
long passed and Richards Paving would object to any economic reports
calculating plaintiff's lost income.

6. As for plaintiff's request for production of documents, my client has indicated
that they are continuing to look for any documents. The documents that plaintiff
is requesting may no longer exist. Should any documents be discovered, they will
be produced to plaintiff.

7. No representatives have ever made an admission of liability to the Delaware
Department of Labor or any other agency.

WHEREFORE, for the reasons stated above, Richards Paving respectfully

request that this Court deny plaintiffs motion to compel discovery.
