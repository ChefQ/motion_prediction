DEFENDANT DONALD KEENAN’S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED
COMPLAINT
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Defendant Donald Keenan (“Defendant” or “Sgt.
Det. Keenan”) respectfully requests that this Honorable Court dismiss Plaintiff Jeffrey
Solomon’s (“Plaintiff”) Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be
granted. Sgt. Det. Keenan seeks dismissal of the following claims asserted against him: Count I –
§ 1983 liability for malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth Amendment; Count IV – §
1983 liability for violation of Plaintiff’s rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment; and
Count VII – § 1983 violation of M.G.L. c. 12, §11(I), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act
(“MCRA”). As grounds for this Motion, Sgt. Det. Keenan states that Plaintiff has failed to plead
sufficient facts to support an actionable claim and, as such, all claims should be dismissed with
prejudice. Furthermore, all claims against Sgt. Det. Keenan should be dismissed as he is entitled
to qualified immunity.
