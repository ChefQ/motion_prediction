DEFENDANT DONALD KEENAN’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF HIS
MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED COMPLAINT
INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Defendant Donald Keenan (“Defendant” or “Sgt.
Det. Keenan”) respectfully requests that this Honorable Court dismiss Plaintiff Jeffrey
Solomon’s (“Plaintiff”) Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be
granted. Sgt. Det. Keenan seeks dismissal of the following claims asserted against him: Count I –
§ 1983 liability for malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth Amendment; Count IV – §
1983 liability for violation of Plaintiff’s rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment; and
Count VII – § 1983 violation of M.G.L. c. 12, §11(I), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act
(“MCRA”). As grounds for this Motion, Sgt. Det. Keenan states that Plaintiff has failed to plead
sufficient facts to support an actionable claim and, as such, all claims should be dismissed with
prejudice. Furthermore, all claims against Sgt. Det. Keenan should be dismissed as he is entitled
to qualified immunity.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY1
On December 12, 2010, Sgt. Det. Keenan, of the Boston Police Department Drug Control
Unit (“DCU”), purchased drugs from Plaintiff while undercover. See Amended Complaint, at ¶
12 (hereinafter, “AC, at ¶ __.”). After Plaintiff’s arrest as a result of the buy, Sgt. Det. Keenan
conducted a preliminary field test using a “Narc Swipe” on the recovered substance to determine
whether it was cocaine. AC, at ¶ 13. The Narc Swipe of the substance failed to change color,
meaning that according to the preliminary field test, the substance was counterfeit and not
cocaine. Id. Sgt. Det. Keenan then discarded the Narc Swipe and the substance that was used as
part of the field test. Id. at ¶ 14. The remainder of the substance was forwarded to the State
Department of Public Health, Hinton Laboratory for further testing. Id. Based on the results of
the field test, Sgt. Det. Keenan charged Plaintiff with distribution of a counterfeit substance. Id.
at ¶ 13.
On April 13, 2011, Attorney Sanders of the Committee for Public Counsel Services and
Assistant District Attorney Mingo of the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office met with Sgt.
Det. Keenan to inspect evidence. AC, at ¶ 23. At the meeting, Sgt. Det. Keenan showed Attorney
Sanders the substances that were recovered, which did not show any blue coloring. Id. at ¶ 24.
Sgt. Det. Keenan then told Attorney Sanders that as part of his field tests, it was his regular
practice to discard tested substances on the ground, which is likely what happened to the
substance recovered from the Plaintiff that he tested with the Narc Swipe. Id. at ¶ 26.
On July 1, 2011, a Suffolk County grand jury was convened at which Sgt. Det. Keenan
testified. AC, at ¶ 28. Sgt. Det. Keenan testified that “although preliminary field testing showed

Sgt. Det. Keenan accepts the facts pled in the Amended Complaint as true only for the limited
purposes of this Motion.
2

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 3 of 12

no color change consistent with cocaine, he later viewed the substance at an undisclosed date and
observed a color change consistent with the presence of cocaine in the alleged substance.” Id. at
¶ 29. Sgt. Det. Keenan also introduced into evidence to certificates signed by Annie Dookhan
and Kate Corbett, which certified that the substances were cocaine. Id. at ¶¶ 22, 30. The grand
jury ultimately issued an indictment for possession with intent to distribute a class B substance in
a school zone and distribution of a class B substance in a school zone. Id. at ¶ 31.
On September 27, 2012, the Crime Laboratory of the State Police Department retested
the substances recovered from the Plaintiff during the undercover buy and found that the
substances were indeed counterfeit and not cocaine. AC, at ¶ 36. Shortly thereafter, on October 5,
2012, the Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi in its case against the Plaintiff thereby
dismissing the charges. Id. at ¶ 38.
On February 4, 2013, Plaintiff commenced suit in United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts. On March 28, 2013, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint against
Annie Dookhan, Donald Keenan, Kate Corbett, Judy Ann Bigby, John Auerbach, Julie Nassif,
Linda Han, Charles Salemi, Elizabeth O’Brien, Daniel Conley, and Suffolk County District
Attorney’s Office. Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendants were brought pursuant to § 1983 and
M.G.L. c. 12 § 11(I) for violation of his constitutional rights and for conspiracy to violate his
constitutional rights.
STANDARD OF LAW
A complaint or count therein must be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)
where it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In
considering a motion to dismiss, the Court is obliged to accept the plaintiff’s well-pleaded facts
3

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 4 of 12

as they appear, granting every reasonable inference in the plaintiff’s favor. Cooperman v.
Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 1999). However, this tenet that a court must accept as
true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009). Mere recitals of the elements of a cause of action,
supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Id. (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 545 (2007)). “While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’
of his ‘entitlement to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation
of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 545 (citations omitted).
“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the
court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”
Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. Inferences reasonably drawn from the plaintiff's factual allegations
must be accepted as true, but the Court is not bound to credit legal conclusions, labels, or naked
assertions, “devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’” Id. (internal citation omitted). “Despite
the highly deferential reading which we accord a litigant’s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), we
need not credit bald assertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated conclusions, or
outright vituperation.” Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990). Within
this analytical framework, all of Plaintiff’s claims against Sgt. Det. Keenan must be dismissed
because Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support actionable claims.
ARGUMENT
I.

Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to demonstrate a Fourteenth Amendment
violation in Count IV.

Plaintiff’s § 1983 claim in Count IV of the Amended Complaint related to his allegations that
Sgt. Det. Keenan destroyed exculpatory evidence must be dismissed as Plaintiff has failed to
4

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 5 of 12

plead a due process violation. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Sgt. Det. Keenan destroyed the
“Narc Swipe” and the substance that was field tested.
Under the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of procedural due process, law enforcement
officers have a duty to turn over material evidence to the prosecutor if the evidence is favorable
to the defendant. Drumgold v. Callahan, 707 F.3d 28 (1st Cir. 2013). Favorable evidence for a
defendant is either exculpatory or impeaching in nature. Id. (citing United States v. Bagley, 473
U.S. 667, 676 (1985)). Evidence is material if “there is a reasonable probability that, had the
evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”
Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. Furthermore, it is essential that the “favorable evidence could
reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in
the verdict.” United States v. Aviles-Colon, 536 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Strickler v.
Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 290 (1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Notably, the “touchstone
of materiality is a ‘reasonable probability’ of different result [at trial].” Kyles v. Whitley, 514
U.S. 419, 434 (1995) (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678). A violation of this obligation by a law
enforcement officer is a due process violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Maryland v.
Brady, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).
For deliberate Brady violations, plaintiffs may also assert substantive due process claims.
Maher v. Town of Ayer, 463 F.Supp.2d 117 (D.Mass. 2009) (citing Reid v. New Hampshire, 56
F.3d 332, 341-342 (1st Cir.1995); Charles v. City of Boston, 365 F.Supp.2d 82, 88-89
(D.Mass.2005). “[A] claim is cognizable as a violation of substantive due process ‘only when it
is so extreme and egregious as to shock the contemporary conscience.’ ” McConkie v. Nichols,
446 F.3d 258, 260 (1st Cir. 2006), (quoting DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 118 (1st Cir.
2005)). “To be actionable under the Due Process Clause, misconduct by state actors must exceed
5

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 6 of 12

a high threshold of allowance for human shortcomings in managing the intricate processes of
government.” Maher, 463 F.Supp.2d at 121 (D.Mass. 2006). In order to assert a substantive due
process claim for a Brady violation, it logically follows that there must be an underlying Brady
violation as outlined in the preceding paragraph.
Plaintiff was not prejudiced by Sgt. Det. Keenan’s alleged destruction of exculpatory
evidence as is required for a true Brady violation. Specifically, Plaintiff was never tried for the
charges that arose out of his arrest and subsequent indictment. Rather, the prosecution sought a
nolle prosequi from the court and the charges were ultimately dismissed. As the Plaintiff was
never criminally convicted, he “did not suffer any harm as a direct result of the defendant[’s]
alleged behavior.”2 Faust v. Coakley, 2008 WL 190769, *4 (D. Mass. 2008) Accordingly, he
“cannot assert a § 1983 claim based upon an alleged Brady violation[]” and Count I of the
Amended Complaint must be dismissed. Id. 3

2

Plaintiff also did not suffer any harm while being held as a result of the initial charge for
distribution of a counterfeit substance which arose out the lawful arrest. Once Plaintiff was
arrested and charged with distribution of a counterfeit substance he was also held on an
outstanding warrant for drug-related charges in Cambridge. (The information about Plaintiff’s
Cambridge charges can be found in his criminal docket. As the criminal docket is a matter
outside of the Amended Complaint, Sgt. Det. Keenan asks that the Court take judicial notice of
Boston Municipal Court criminal docket 1001CR9024 attached hereto as Exhibit A. See Martin
v. Mead Johnson Nutrition Co., 2010 WL 3928710, *2 (D.Mass. 2010) (“It is well-accepted that
federal courts may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts if those proceedings have
relevance to the matters at hand.”). See also E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. v. Cullen, 791
F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1986) (taking judicial notice of complaint in state court action). As such, if
Plaintiff was going to be released in relation to the initial charges, he would still have been held
on the Cambridge charges.
3
Plaintiff references the Fifth Amendment in the introductory paragraph of his Amended
Complaint. With respect to the Fifth Amendment, Plaintiff fails to articulate the nature of the
alleged violation. The Fifth Amendment, made applicable to state actors by means of the
Fourteenth Amendment, provides that no person “shall be compelled in a criminal case to be a
witness against himself.” See Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 780 n. 1 (2003); U.S. Const.
amend. V. A Fifth Amendment violation occurs when coerced statements are introduced at trial.
United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 264 (1990). The facts as alleged do not
6

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 7 of 12

II.

All of Plaintiff’s claims must be dismissed because Sgt. Det. Keenan is immune
from perjury claims.

All counts in as much as they relate to perjury must be dismissed as Sgt. Det. Keenan is
immune against claims of perjured testimony at trial or before a grand jury. Briscoe v. LaHue,
460 U.S. 325, 326 (1983). See Williams v. City of Boston, 771 F.Supp.2d 190, 203 (D.Mass.
2011); Almedia v. Fall River Police Station, 2012 WL 3548063, *5 (D.Mass. 2012). Police
officers enjoy absolute immunity from claims of perjured testimony. Id. As such, Sgt. Det.
Keenan cannot be held liable under § 1983 for Plaintiff’s claims that he committed perjury while
testifying in front of the grand jury.
III.

Plaintiff’s MCRA claim in Count VIII of the Amended Complaint must be
dismissed because Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support such a
claim.

Plaintiff’s claim in Count VIII of the Amended Complaint that Sgt. Det. Keenan violated the
Massachusetts Civil Rights Act must be dismissed because Plaintiff does not plead sufficient
facts to support such a claim.
A plaintiff states a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M.G.L. c.12, §11I upon
showing: (1) threats, intimidation or coercion that (2) lead to violation of a federal or
Commonwealth constitutional right.

Like §1983, MCRA requires an actual deprivation of

constitutional rights. Turkowitz v. Town of Provincetown, --- F. Supp. 2d ---- , 2012 WL
support a Fifth Amendment violation in that sense. If the Plaintiff intended to assert a Fifth
Amendment due process violation, that claim is also barred as due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment only applies to actions of the federal government and not those of private
individuals or states. Public Utilities Commission v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451, 461 (1952). Sgt. Det.
Keenan is not a federal actor and, as such, he cannot be held liable under §1983 for Fifth
Amendment due process violations. Id. Regardless of the nature of Plaintiff’s assertion that his
Fifth Amendment rights were violated, he has failed to state a claim for which relief may be
granted and dismissal is appropriate.

7

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 8 of 12

5354545, 10 (D. Mass. 2012); Therrien v. Hamilton, 849 F.Supp. 110, 115 (D. Mass. 1994)
(quoting Elwood v. Pina, 815 F.2d 173, 177 (1st Cir.1987) (quotations omitted)); Lyons v.
National Car Rental Systems, Inc. (of Delaware), 30 F.3d 240, 246 (1st Cir. 1994). To recover
under the MCRA, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that not only were
his civil rights violated, but that those rights were interfered with by threats, intimidation or
coercion, which is an “essential element” of a claim under the MCRA. Layne v. Superintendent,
Massachusetts Correctional Institution, 406 Mass. 156, 158 (1989). “The direct violation of a
constitutional right does not establish a MCRA violation because ‘it is not an attempt to force
someone to do something the person is not lawfully required to do.’” Turkowitz v. Town of
Provincetown, --- F. Supp. 2d ---- , 2012 WL 5354545, 10 (D. Mass. 2012) (quoting Columbus v.
Biggio, 76 F.Supp.2d 43, 54 (D. Mass.1999)); see also Gallagher v. Commonwealth, No. 00–
11859–RWZ, 2002 WL 924243, at *3 (D. Mass. March 11, 2002) (“The use of force is not, in
itself, coercive within the meaning of the act unless such force is inflicted in order to achieve
some further purpose.”).
Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint is entirely void of facts that allege that Sgt. Det. Keenan
threatened, intimidated or coerced Plaintiff in an attempt to force Plaintiff into doing something
he was not lawfully required to do. Aside from the initial undercover drug buy, Sgt. Det. Keenan
and Plaintiff had no contact or communication. In the Amended Complaint there is nothing to
suggest that Sgt. Det. Keenan’s actions during the undercover buy amounted to threats,
intimidation or coercion. Furthermore, Sgt. Det. Keenan’s alleged communications with
Attorney Sanders do not amount to threats, intimidation or coercion of Plaintiff. It is not even
clear from the alleged statements how those statements to Attorney Sanders amount to an attempt
to force Plaintiff into doing something he was not lawfully required to do. Accordingly, Count
8

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 9 of 12

VIII of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim for
violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
IV.

Sgt. Det. Keenan is entitled to qualified immunity.

All counts against Sgt. Det. Keenan cannot be maintained because as a government
official he is entitled to qualified immunity. “Government officials performing discretionary
functions generally are granted a qualified immunity and are ‘shielded from liability for civil
damages in so far as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional
rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609
(1999) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)); see also Kelley v. LaForce,
288 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002) (qualified immunity available as defense to §1983 civil liability
claims). “The protection of qualified immunity applied regardless of whether the government
official’s error is a mistake of law, mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law
and fact.” Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009) (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S.
551, 567 (2004)). This doctrine of qualified immunity protects such public officials so that they
may act freely “without fear of retributive suit for damages except when they should have
understood that particular conduct was unlawful.” Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.
2004) (citations omitted). The qualified immunity determination is to be determined as soon as
possible because “[t]he privilege is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense in liability
and, like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to
trial.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-201 (2001) (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,
526 (1985)).

9

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 10 of 12

To determine whether an official violated clearly established rights of which a reasonable
person would have known, three inquiries are made: 1) “whether the plaintiff’s allegations, if
true, establish a constitutional violation; 2) whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly
established at the time of the alleged violations; and 3) whether a reasonable officer situated
similarly would have understood the challenged act or omission to contravene the discerned
constitutional right.” Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2004).
A. Malicious prosecution claim in Count I must be dismissed as the law was not
clearly established.
To establish a § 1983 claim for malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth
Amendment, a plaintiff must “show a deprivation of liberty, pursuant to legal process, that is
consistent with the concept of a Fourth Amendment seizure.” Harrington v. City of Nashua, 610
F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2010). “Typically, the alleged deprivation takes ‘the form of an arrest
warrant (in which case the arrest would constitute the seizure) or a subsequent charging
document (in which case the sum of post-arraignment deprivations would comprise the
seizure).’” Moreno-Medina v. Toledo, 458 Fed.Appx. 4, 6-8, (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Nieves v.
McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 2001)). However, this Circuit has not yet definitively ruled
as to whether such a claim exits. Rather, this Circuit has merely “assume[d], without deciding”
that plaintiffs may assert § 1983 claims for malicious prosecution based on a Fourth Amendment
violation. Moreno-Medina, 458 Fed.Appx. at 3. Furthermore, this Court has very recently
granted dismissals on § 1983 claims for malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth
Amendment on qualified immunity grounds because the law was and still is not clearly
established. See Wilson v. Teves, 2012 WL 3800847, *1 -2 (D.Mass. 2012). Accordingly, Sgt.
Det. Keenan is entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiff’s claim in Count I of the Amended
Complaint.
10

Case 1:13-cv-10208-GAO Document 37 Filed 05/10/13 Page 11 of 12

B. Section 1983 claim in Count IV must be dismissed because Plaintiff failed to
establish a constitutional violation.
Sgt. Det. Keenan is entitled to qualified immunity because Plaintiff has failed to factually
establish a constitutional violation as has been established throughout this motion. Furthermore,
Sgt. Det. Keenan’s alleged conduct was that of a similarly situated, reasonable officer. As such,
Sgt. Det. Keenan is entitled to qualified immunity and all claims against him must be dismissed
at the earliest possible stage.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, Defendant Donald Keenan respectfully requests that this Honorable
Court dismiss with prejudice all claims asserted against him in Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint
for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted.

Respectfully submitted,
DEFENDANT DONALD KEENAN
