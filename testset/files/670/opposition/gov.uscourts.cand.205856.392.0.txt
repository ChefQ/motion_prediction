INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs have now spent over a year trying to get a basic evidence preservation agreement
from defendants and the intervenor. Starting from shortly after the Hepting case was filed in early
2006, plaintiffs began discussions, first with AT&T and the government and later, after all the
cases were consolidated into this multi-district litigation, with all of the carrier defendants.
Plaintiffs’ goal is simple: to avoid a situation in which plaintiffs are finally entitled to engage in
substantive discovery only to find that needed relevant evidence has been destroyed. Given the
context of this case – a complex litigation where the evidence relates to communications and
communications records of millions of ordinary Americans over a period of many years – a formal
stipulation or order should govern the critical issue of evidence preservation. This is especially the
case since substantive discovery is, at best, months away.
Plaintiffs have tried multiple times to accommodate the government’s concerns about its
invocation of the state secrets privilege. Plaintiffs have said that they are willing to await the Ninth
Circuit’s decision in Hepting before engaging in discussions concerning the details of the parties’
preservation duties (without conceding that the state secrets privilege applies). They have framed
their request as generously as possible, merely asking defendants and the intervenor to agree that
the scope of the legal duty is as expressed in the leading caselaw. The specific proposed order is
modeled on the “Interim Order Regarding Preservation” in the Manual for Complex Litigation
(“MCL”). That interim order is designed to be used “[u]ntil the parties reach agreement on a
preservation plan.” MCL, Fourth § 40.25, item 3 (a). This seems to be the appropriate model since
the parties are not going to address a more detailed preservation plan at least until after the Ninth
Circuit provides some clarity on the scope of the state secrets privilege.
Plaintiffs ultimately brought this matter to the court’s attention because the government
insisted that their invocation of the state secrets privilege meant that neither they nor the carriers
could make any agreement to preserve evidence. The most the government would say was that
they knew that generally “parties to litigation” had obligations to preserve evidence, not that they
or the carriers had any obligations or would abide by them. Declaration of Cindy Cohn in Support

PLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
PRESERVE EVIDENCE

1

of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Preserve Evidence, Exh. C, (Coppolino email of June 29, 2007). The

2

government did offer to make an ex parte, in camera presentation to the court on this issue,

3

although they resisted plaintiffs’ suggestion that the best vehicle for such a presentation was the

4

court’s ordinary motion schedule.

5

At heart, defendants’ and intervenor’s position was that because the government has made a

6

state secrets privilege assertion over at least some of the technological details, they cannot be held

7

to any formal duty to preserve relevant evidence. Yet the state secrets privilege does not allow

8

parties to evade basic procedural duties. As plaintiffs noted in their opening brief, “invocation of

9

the privilege results in no alteration of pertinent substantive or procedural rules . . ..” Ellsberg v.

10

Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51,64 (D.C. Cir. 1983).

11

In their opposition and joinders, both the government and the carriers take baby steps

12

toward agreeing to preserve relevant evidence, while still resisting the imposition of any

13

preservation order that could enforce these duties. The Verizon Defendants actually move the

14

closest, formally stating in their joinder “that they are obligated to take reasonable steps to

15

preserve” potentially discoverable evidence. Verizon Opposition (Docket No. 388) at 1:8-9.1 Yet

16

Verizon still opposes plaintiffs’ motion. The government initially repeats its limited assertion that

17

it “recognizes[s]” the obligations. Government Opposition (Docket No. 386) at 1:6. It later states

18

that the ex parte, in camera declaration by an unnamed NSA agent “shows that if any potentially

19

relevant information exists as to any allegations . . . appropriate preservation steps, if any, are being

20

taken.” Govt. Opp. at p. 12:12-15.2 The AT&T3 and Sprint Defendants merely join in the

21

government’s opposition (AT&T Joinder (Docket No. 391); Sprint Joinder (Docket No. 390),

The government insists in two footnotes that its ex parte, in camera filing is not made pursuant to
50 U.S.C. §1806(f). Govt. Opp. at footnote 1 and 10. Plaintiffs disagree. Situations in which the
parties are discussing evidence where the government has raised concerns about national security
are exactly what Section 1806(f) covers, and the government appears to be using the process laid
out by Congress, just without naming it. Nonetheless, the court need not resolve this issue now.
Plaintiffs do not oppose the government’s ex parte, in camera filing because it appears to
substantially comply with the Section 1806(f) process.

1

presumably meaning that the unnamed NSA agent’s declaration also explains what these carrier

2

defendants are doing to preserve potentially relevant evidence.4

3

Given these small steps, it is not much more to require the defendants and intervenor to

4

abide by the normal preservation duties applicable in complex litigation, as expressed in plaintiffs’

5

proposed order. These duties are: 1) identification of the persons responsible at each defendant and

6

the intervenor for ensuring that evidence is preserved; 2) the institution of a litigation hold; 3) a

7

standard for preservation so that later disputes can be properly framed, and 4) the availability of

8

sanctions if the parties breach their duty.

9

The Court may also wish to make more specific requirements of the carriers and

10

government in an ex parte, in camera order (presented only to the affected parties), based on the

11

presumably more specific information it has received from the government in camera, ex parte.

12

Obviously, plaintiffs are not in a position to list the specifics of such a secret order, but it could

13

ensure that the information reasonably needed to address plaintiffs’ statutory and Constitutional

14

claims is preserved (for instance, information related to the communications of ordinary citizens

15

which pass through the split cables referenced in the Klein documents, which are admittedly not

16

state secrets, and information sufficient to establish which call records belonging to which

17

customers were turned over by which carriers at approximately which times).5 Such a secret order

18

could also eliminate the government’s concern that the public order proposed by plaintiffs would

19

leave them and the carriers without specific guidance about what to preserve. See Govt. Opp. at p.

20

4

25

It seems strange that an unnamed NSA agent could give admissible evidence about what AT&T,
Sprint, and Verizon defendants are doing individually to preserve relevant evidence. Given the
range of information from each carrier that would be relevant in these cases, it is hard to imagine
how one NSA declarant could credibly give admissible testimony about the preservation efforts
taken by the individual carriers. While the in camera nature of the declaration makes it difficult to
be sure, it seems that the unnamed NSA agent’s declaration would appear, at best, to be hearsay
about the efforts taken by the carriers, or perhaps not to address the actions taken by the carriers at
all. If either of these is the case, we ask that the court require the carrier defendants to present their
own declarations about efforts to preserve relevant evidence from individuals with appropriate
knowledge.

28

Given the uncertainty as to what information may be privileged and what information the court
may have to examine in making that determination or as part of the 50 U.S.C 1806(f) process, the
parties must preserve all evidence which might fall within the scope of discovery. United States v.
Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 10 (1953) (Noting that a court may “require a complete disclosure to the
judge before the claim of privilege will be accepted . . .”)

No. M-06-01791-VRW

PLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
PRESERVE EVIDENCE

1

11:20-12:2. What cannot be the case is the Catch-22 that the government wishes to impose on

2

plaintiffs: on the one hand, that the state secrets privilege prevents a detailed factual determination

3

of what should be preserved and on the other, that any order short of that cannot be imposed

4

because it does not provide sufficient factual detail about what should be preserved.

5

Plaintiffs respectfully request that their motion be granted.

6

ARGUMENT

7

The government makes a two-part argument in opposition. The government’s first

8

argument fails because it incorrectly asserts that the applicable standard is the one articulated in a

9

non-complex case from the Western District of Pennsylvania, Capricorn Power Co. v. Siemens

10

Westinghouse Power Corp., 220 F.R.D. 429 (W.D. Penn. 2004). Capricorn Power expressly

11

distinguishes itself from complex litigation, stating:

12
13
14
15
16

The Court recognizes that it has become routine to order the preservation of
evidence prior to the beginning of the discovery period at the initial case
management conference and sometimes even before such a conference in complex
litigation. Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth § 11.442. The circumstances of
the three motions before the Court do not concern “complex” litigation nor are we at
the initial stages of discovery with all of the attendant circumstances which are
normally present in cases for which the Manual for Complex Litigation is intended
to provide guidance. Id at §§ 10.1, 11.442. Therefore, the Court does not invoke
any of the recommendations of that manual for the present analysis.

17

Id. at 434, n.2. Similarly, the government mistakenly relies on a Southern District of New York

18

case, Treppel v. Bovail Corp., 233 F.R.D. 363 (S.D.N.Y 2006), which concerned an alleged

19

attempt to harm the reputation of an individual stock analyst. Plainly, that case was also not

20

complex litigation.

21

As the plaintiffs explained in their opening brief, the proper place to look for assistance in

22

determining whether an interim preservation order is appropriate in complex litigation such as this

23

is the MCL. It says, “[b]efore discovery starts, and perhaps before the initial conference, the court

24

should consider whether to enter an order requiring the parties to preserve and retain documents,

25

files, data, and records that may be relevant to the litigation.” MCL, Fourth § 11.442. As noted

26

above, plaintiffs’ proposed order is modeled on an interim preservation order designed to be used

27

“[u]ntil the parties reach agreement on a preservation plan.” MCL, Fourth § 40.25, item 3 (a).

28

This seems to be the appropriate course until the Ninth Circuit decides the Hepting appeal, since
No. M-06-01791-VRW

4

PLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
PRESERVE EVIDENCE

1

plaintiffs have agreed to forgo detailed discussions regarding a preservation plan until then.

2

The second part of the government’s argument extends its erroneous reasoning, claiming

3

that the motion “cannot be resolved without state secrets” because of the detailed inquiry involved.

4

Govt. Opp. at p. 6:23. The government makes the “straw man” argument that resolving this motion

5

would invariably disclose “intelligence sources and methods subject to the state secrets privilege.”

6

Id. at p. 10:19-22. Plaintiffs are not seeking a factually specific preservation order. As noted

7

above, plaintiffs have expressly modeled their request on the MCL’s “Interim Order Regarding

8

Preservation”, which is imposed before the parties engage in the factual discussion of a

9

preservation plan. The Capricorn Power court observed that such orders are “routine” in complex

10

cases. Capricorn Power, supra at 434, n.2. More importantly, though, such an order does not

11

require the defendants to reveal any information whatsoever to plaintiffs, much less to reveal state

12

secrets.

13

The risk of spoliation of evidence in a large, complex, litigation such as this is real, and

14

plaintiffs’ concerns are reasonable. Mindful of the state secrets privilege issue before the Ninth

15

Circuit, plaintiffs seek a modest preservation order that would simply spell out the parties’ legal

16

obligations, require identification of responsible persons, and provide plaintiffs with clear recourse

17

in the event that relevant evidence is destroyed. It may make sense for the Court to supplement

18

plaintiffs’ proposed public order with a more specific, ex parte, in camera Order to give the

19

defendants and the intervenor more factually detailed assistance in carrying out their preservation

20

duties.

21

Finally, the government maintains that no hearing should be held because the issues are

22

“inherently factual.” Plaintiffs disagree, and believe that the core of this dispute is about whether

23

an interim preservation order is appropriate to ensure that evidence is not destroyed, not what a

24

specific final preservation order should say. Because of this, plaintiffs respectfully submit that it

25

may be helpful to the Court to have the parties before it to answer any questions.
