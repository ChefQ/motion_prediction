Plaintiffs,

CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE,
Intervenor Plaintiff,
v.

Case No. 1:16-cv-01534-JEB
[Consolidated with Case
Nos. 1:16-cv-1796 and 1:17-cv-267]

U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,
Defendant,
and
DAKOTA ACCESS, LLC,
Intervenor Defendant.
______________________________
INTERVENOR DEFENDANT DAKOTA ACCESS, LLC’S
RESPONSE TO CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE’S MOTION TO EXTEND
______________________________
Intervenor Defendant Dakota Access, LLC does not oppose giving Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe the same extension granted earlier today to Oglala Sioux Tribe and Yankton Sioux Tribe.
(Cheyenne River did not seek Dakota Access’s position after the Court ruled on those other motions. Instead it relied on replies to emails that preceded the Court’s ruling.) In the interest of
trying to achieve consensus (or at least partial consensus) from the various parties on a proposed
post-remand schedule, Dakota Access suggests that the Court set the same November 6, 2018 due
date for all parties to set forth their positions on post-remand scheduling.
