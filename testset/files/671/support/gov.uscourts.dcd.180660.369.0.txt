PLAINTIFF-INTERVENOR CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE’S MOTION TO
EXTEND THE TIME TO FILE A PROPOSAL FOR POST-REMAND PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiff-Intervenor Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (“CRST”) hereby moves to extend its
time to file a proposal for post-remand proceedings, from November 1, 2018, to November 6,
2018. As grounds for this motion, the CRST states as the following:
1.

On August 31, 2018, Plaintiff United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”)

advised that it had completed the remand and filed with the Court its 2-page Memorandum for
the Record. ECF Nos. 362 and 362-1. The Corps advised that the Memorandum for the Record
“is supported by the Corps’ over 100-page Remand analysis as well as the administrative record.
The remand analysis is undergoing a confidentiality review before release.” ECF No. 362 at 1.

Case 1:16-cv-01534-JEB Document 369 Filed 10/30/18 Page 2 of 3

2.

On October 1, 2018, a Joint Status Report was filed by Plaintiff Standing Rock

Sioux Tribe (“SRST”), Plaintiff-Intervenor CRST, the Corps, and Defendant-Intervenor Dakota
Access, LLC. ECF No. 364. The Joint Status Report stated that the Remand analysis (with
proposed redactions) had been shared with SRST and CRST for their review, but that SRST and
CRST “have not previously had the opportunity to review the Corps’ remand analysis and make
appropriate government-level decisions as to whether and/or how to proceed with this litigation.”
Id. at 2. In good faith, the parties to the Joint Status Report proposed that, “As expeditiously as
possible, but no later than November 1, 2018, the Parties shall submit proposals for post-remand
proceedings.” Id. at 2.
3.

CRST requires additional time to evaluate the Remand analysis.

4.

This Motion by the CRST requests the same relief granted to the Oglala Sioux

Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe in this Court’s Minute Order of October 30, 2018.
5.

The undersigned has conferred with all parties pursuant to LCVR 7(m) concerning

this Motion. The Corps, Plaintiffs Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Yankton Sioux Tribe, Robert
Flying Hawk, Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the Jumping Eagle Plaintiffs consent to this Motion.
Defendant Dakota Access, LLC advises that it opposes this Motion.
6.

A proposed Order is enclosed with this Motion pursuant to LCVR 7(c).
