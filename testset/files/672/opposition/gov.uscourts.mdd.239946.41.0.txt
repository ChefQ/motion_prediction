SAMUEL I WHITE PC AND SUBSTITUTE TRUSTEES RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S
MOTIONFOR LEAVE TO FILE SUR-REPLY

Comes now Robert H. Hillman and Daniel J. Pesachowitz, attorneys for the Defendants,
Samuel 1. White, PC ("SIWPC"), John E. Driscoll, H, Robert E. Frazier, Jana M. Gantt, Laura D.
Harris, Kimberly Lane, and Deena Reynolds (SIWPC and the individuals collectively hereinafter
referred to as "the SIWPC Defendants"), and oppose the Plaintiffs Motion for Leave to File Sur-
Reply to the SIWPC Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment as follows:

l. The Plaintiff, Renee L. McCray ("McCray"), filed a Motion for Leave to File a
Sur-Reply in response to the Reply Memorandum filed by the named Defendants, pertaining to
the pending Motions to Dismiss Amended Complaint.

2. McCray has had a full and fair opportunity to oppose the Motions to Dismiss.
Even if the Court is mclined to accept the filings, nothing in the Sur-reply affects the pending

Motions to Dismiss, and they should be granted.

3. In this regards, clearly no sur-reply is necessary nor appropriate in this imstance.
Contrary to the assertions in McCray's Motion for Leave, this is not a case where McCray was
unable to contest matters presented to the Court for the first time. Rather, a review of McCray's
proposed Sur-reply discloses that it 1s largely a churn out of formerly advanced arguments and
references to unrelated lawsuits involving the Defendants, simply to vilify the Defendants.

4. It appears that McCray simply wants to have the last word, regardless of the
necessity of additional filings, and without regard to the additional burden being placed on the
parties and the Court by such filings.

WHEREFORE, for all the above reasons Samuel I. White, PC, John E. Driscoll, II,
Robert E. Frazier, Jana M. Gantt, Laura D. Harris, Kimberly Lane, and Deena Reynolds request

that the Court deny McCray's Motion for Leave to File Sur-Reply..

Respectfully Submitted:

Samuel I. White, PC
