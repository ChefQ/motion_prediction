PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE
SUR-REPLY TO SAMUEL I. WHITE, P.C. AND SUBSTITUTE
TRUSTEES MOTION TO DISMISS AND FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:

COME NOW Plaintiff, Renee L. McCray, who respectfully request leave of the Court to file
the attached Surreply addressing Defendants' motion to dismiss and summary judgment in order to
correct several misstatements and distortions of the factual record. The Court should grant the
Plaintiffs motion in order to allow the Plaintiff to address and correct these misstatements.

The decision to grant or deny leave to file a surreply is committed to the sound discretion of
the court. American Forest & Paper Ass'n, Inc., v. U.S. Environ. Protection Agency, No. 93-cv-
0694 (RMU)), 1996 WL 509601, *3 (D.D.C. 1996)(granting leave). Granting leave to file a surreply
is appropriate when a reply leaves "a party ... `unable to contest matters presented to the court for

the first time.'" Ben-Kotel v. Howard Univ., 319 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citation omitted),

Alexander v. FBI, 186 F.R.D. 71, 74 (D.D.C. 1998) (granting leave). A surreply may be necessary

whether the new matter is factual or raises new legal arguments. It is particularly appropriate in
order to address and correct inaccuracies in areply memorandum. See American Forest & Paper,

1996 WL 506601 at *3.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request this Honorable Court enter an order granting
leave to file the Plaintiff's surreply annexed to this motion where the facts brought forth therein are

material to the issues before this Court.

Dated: September 9, 2013 Respectfully Submitted,
