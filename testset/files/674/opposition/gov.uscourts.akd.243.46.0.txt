Case No. A05-0006-CV (HRH)
(CONSOLIDATED)
DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO
MOTION TO INTERVENE

The defendants, United States of America et al., respond
herein in opposition to the Motion to Intervene as Plaintiffs
(Docket Entry No. 37). The Alaska Fish and Wildlife Federation
and Outdoor Council, the Alaska Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Fund, Michael Tinker and John Conrad seek to intervene as
plaintiffs in this action.
An application to intervene presupposes that the applicant
has a right to maintain the claims for which relief is sought.

(7th Cir. 1980); Lucero v. City of Albuquerque, 140 F.R.D. 455,
457 (D. NM 1992). The proposed intervenors cannot, however,
maintain their proposed claims. Therefore, their motion to
intervene should be denied. As will be shown below, the proposed
intervenors (hereinafter referred to as “movants”) are not
entitled to the relief they seek. Their proposed claims are
barred by statute of limitations, would present claims which
movants lack standing to present, or fail to state claims upon
which relief can be granted.
The proposed intervenors seek to intervene as plaintiffs to
obtain judicial review of the rulemaking promulgated on January
8, 1999, 64 Federal Register 1276. Proposed Intervenors’
Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ¶ 1. Movants
would incorporate by reference large portions of the Complaint
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by the State of
Alaska in Case No. A05-0158-CV. Id. ¶¶ 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14.
I. THE PROPOSED ACTION IS BARRED BY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
Movants’ motion was filed on January 12, 2006. This is more
than six years after the promulgation of the challenged
regulations on January 8, 1999. It is also more than six years
after these regulations became effective on October 1, 1999. 64
Federal Register 1276.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a) all civil actions against
the United States (with an exception not applicable to this case)

are to be commenced within six-years “after the right of action
first accrues.” In Wind River Mining Corp. v. United States, 946
F.2d 710 (9th Cir. 1991), the Court of Appeals addressed when an
action for review of administrative regulations first accrues.
Any challenge with respect to procedural violations and facial
challenges to the regulations must be brought within six years of
the decision. 946 F.2d at 715. A challenge to the substance of an
agency decision as exceeding constitutional or statutory
authority must be brought within six years following application
of the disputed decision to the challenger. Id. at 715-16.
Movants would present both procedural and substantive challenges
to the January 1999 rulemaking.
To the extent movants would allege that this rulemaking
violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), e.g. Proposed
Intervenors’ Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ¶¶
8-9, they would present a procedural challenge. The provisions of
5 U.S.C. § 553 sets forth procedural requirements for a
rulemaking. The provisions of 5 U.S.C. §§ 710-706 provide only
the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity for judicial review of
final agency actions and establishes the standards for that
review, and impose no substantive obligations on the agencies.
This procedural challenge is clearly barred by 28 U.S.C. §
2401(a).
To the extent movants seek to present a substantive

challenge to the January 1999 rulemaking, that challenge is also
barred by 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). As already shown, these
regulations went into effect on October 1, 1999. Thus, on October
1, 1999, the subsistence use priority set forth in 16 U.S.C. §§
3113-3114 applied to all waters determined in the January 8, 1999
rulemaking to be public lands.
These regulations clearly became applicable to both of the
proposed individual intervenors, Michael Tinker and John Conrad,
on that date. As shown in the Declaration of Michael Tinker ¶ 2
and the Declaration of John Conrad ¶ 2, both individuals were by
that date participating in the taking of salmon through the use
of fish wheels on the Copper River. To the extent that the Copper
River lies withing the boundaries of the Wrangell-St. Elias
National Park and Preserve, the waters of the Copper River were
as of October 1, 1999 public lands for the purposes of 16 U.S.C.
§§ 3113-3114. These regulations and the limitations and
requirements set forth therein became applicable to Messrs.
Tinker and Conrad on that date. Therefore, any challenge by
Messrs. Tinker and Conrad to the substance of that rulemaking
first accrued more than six years prior to their motion to
intervene in this action.
Mr. Conrad states that in April 2005 he received a letter
from the Park Service informing him that he could no longer use a
fish wheel unless he received a federal permit. Declaration of

Conrad ¶ 3. A copy of that letter is attached as Exhibit 1
hereto. As is clear in the text of that letter, the Park Service
was only notifying Mr. Conrad that it would now enforce the
requirements of the regulations. Exhibit 2 at 1: “we notify you
of our intent to enforce existing NPS regulations....” Accord
Exhibit 2 hereto. This notification of how the Park Service would
exercise its enforcement discretion, does not change the fact
that the challenged regulations became applicable to Mr. Conrad
(and Mr. Tinker’s) activities on October 1, 1999.
Similarly, members of the two organizational movants were
fishing in Alaska’s rivers long before October 1, 1999.
Declaration of Teresa Sager Albaugh ¶ 6-8. Therefore, any
challenge by these entities also first accrued more that six
years prior to the filing of their motion to intervene.
For the foregoing reasons, the Motion to Intervene as
Plaintiffs (Docket Entry No. 37), should be denied because it
would state claims for relief that would have to be dismissed as
barred by statute of limitations.1/
II. MOVANTS LACK STANDING TO BRING THEIR PROPOSED ACTION
The Motion to Intervene as Plaintiffs (Docket Entry No. 37)
should be denied by reason of the movants’ lack of standing to
present their proposed claims.

Movants’ application for intervention does not relate back
to the commencement of this action. Speed Products Co. v.

Movants seek to intervene as plaintiffs in this action on
the grounds that the “1999 regulations improperly deem certain
State land as ‘Public Land,’ thus bringing such lands under
Federal management.” Memorandum in Support of Motion to Intervene
as Plaintiffs at 2. Movants’ proposed action would be founded on
the “loss of their rights to State management of land rightfully
belonging to the State of Alaska....” Proposed Intervenors’
Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ¶¶ 9, 11, 13, 15.
Movants incorporate by reference many of the allegations of the
Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by the
State in Case No. A05-158-CV; including paragraphs 10-12 thereof.
Proposed Intervenors’ Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
Relief ¶ 7. These include the State’s allegations that the State
has been granted or is entitled to title to lands and waters and
exercises authority over these lands and waters pursuant to the
Alaska Statehood Act, the Submerged Lands Act and the Equal
Footing doctrine. Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
filed by the State in Case No. A05-0158-CV ¶¶ 10-12. Movants lack
standing to bring claims to enforce sovereign rights of the
State.
Standing addresses the subject matter jurisdiction of the
court, and must be both pleaded and proved by the plaintiff.

burden of showing the necessary elements for standing. FW/PBS,
Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).
In Federal courts, Article III of the United States
Constitution requires a "case or controversy." Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). Plaintiffs must have "a personal stake
in the outcome of the controversy" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186,
204 (1962). The Supreme Court has held that this jurisdictional
hurdle and constitutional injury requirement embraces three
related elements: (1) an actual or threatened injury, (2) which
is fairly traceable to the defendant’s alleged unlawful conduct,
and (3) which is likely to be redressed by the relief requested.

Secretary of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 955
(1984). This is so even “when the very same allegedly illegal act
that affects the litigant also affects a third party.” Triplett,
494 U.S. at 720. “The decision to seek review should be placed in
the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome.”
Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 62 (1986). A litigant may be
permitted to bring actions on behalf of third parties only if (1)
the litigant has suffered an injury in fact giving him or her a
sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome, (2) the litigant
has a close relationship to the third party, and (3) there exists
some hindrance to the third party’s ability to protect his or her
own interest. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410-11 (1991).2/
Movants clearly seek to enforce rights given not to them but
to the State of Alaska, and to redress injuries allegedly
suffered by the State of Alaska.3/ As already shown, movants have
incorporated the State’s allegations of rights under the Equal

2

/
There can be no dispute that the third criteria cannot be
met. Not only has nothing hindered the State’s ability to protect
its own interests, but the State has in fact brought an action to
enforce it own alleged rights.

/
The court in Alaska Legislative Council v. Babbitt 181 F.3d
1333, 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1999), recognized that complaints about
interference with the prerogatives of the State in the management
of fish and wildlife belonged to the State and implicated the
State’s sovereignty. Consequently, the Alaska Legislative Council
and individual legislators suing in the official capacity lacked
standing to bring suit. Id. If State legislators lack such
standing, movants also lack such standing.

Footing Doctrine, the Submerged Lands Act and the Alaska
Statehood Act (Compact). The “equal footing” doctrine, which is
described in Utah Division of State Lands v. United States, 482
U.S. 193, 196-97 (1987), pertains to rights held by the State of
Alaska as a sovereign and not any rights of the individual
plaintiffs. Accord United States v. Gardner, 107 F.3d 1314, 131819 (9th Cir. 1997). The Statehood Act likewise pertains to the
organization and rights of the State of Alaska as a sovereign
entity, not to individual rights of the plaintiffs.
The Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. §§ 1301 et seq. also
involves rights held by states rather than individual citizens.
16 U.S.C. § 1311. This court has determined in Alaska
Constitutional Legal Defense Conservation Fund, Inc. et al. v.
Gale Norton et al., No. A00-0167-CV(HRH), Order Motion to Dismiss
filed February 4, 2002, at 5-8,4/ that private individuals and
organizations lack standing to bring such claims belonging to the
State. Lacking such standing, movants’ motion to intervene should
be denied.
III. COUNTS III AND IV FAIL TO STATE CLAIMS
UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED
Even if movants had standing to present any of the claims
set forth in the Proposed Intervenors’ Complaint for Declaratory
and Injunctive Relief, Counts III and IV of that complaint fail

to state claims upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, even
if movants were to be permitted to intervene in this action, they
should not be permitted to present the claims set forth in their
proposed Counts III and IV.
Movants’ Counts III and IV incorporate by reference and are
identical to the State’s Counts III and IV of the Complaint for
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Case No. A05-0158-CV. The
United States has moved for dismissal of both those counts.
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings–Count III in
Case No. A05-0158-CV(HRH) (Docket Entry No. 19), and Defendants
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment--Count IV in Case No. A050158-CV(HRH)(Docket Entry No. 20). Dismissal of Count III is
sought on the grounds that this claim is barred by statute of
limitations. Dismissal of Count IV is sought for lack of standing
and lack of ripeness. Briefing on these motions was completed on
November 7, 2005.
Movants for intervention take a case in the posture they
find it at the time of their motion to intervene. Vinson v.
Washington Gas Light Co., 321 U.S. 489, 498 (1944); Petition of
Geisser, 554 F.2d 698, 705 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1977). Movants’ motion
to intervene was filed after the parties had fully briefed
threshold matters regarding their proposed Counts III and IV.
Therefore, movants should be required to accept whatever the
court’s ruling will be on the Government’s two pending motions.

If those motions are granted and the State’s Counts III and IV
are dismissed, movants should not be permitted to present their
proposed Counts III and IV.
Alternatively, the United States incorporates herein the
arguments and authorities stated in the Points and Authorities in
Support of Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings–Count
III in Case No. A05-0158-CV(HRH) (Docket Entry No. 19), Points
and Authorities in Support of Defendants Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment--Count IV in Case No. A05-0158-CV(HRH)(Docket
Entry No. 20), Reply in Support of Defendants’ Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings–Count III in Case No. A05-0158-CV(HRH)
(Docket Entry No. 30), and Reply in Support of Defendants Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment--Count IV in Case No. A05-0158CV(HRH)(Docket Entry No. 31). For the reasons stated therein,
movants’ proposed Counts III and IV must fail. Therefore, the
court should deny the motion to intervene to state those two
counts.
IV. MOVANTS HAVE FAILED TO SHOW GROUNDS FOR INTERVENTION
Movants do not specify whether they seek to intervene in
this action as a matter of right pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
24(a), or whether they seek permissive intervention pursuant to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). For the reasons that follow, movants fail
to show entitlement to intervene on either basis.
A. Intervention of Right. Since there is no statute that

- 11 -

Case 3:05-cv-00006-HRH

Document 46

confers an unconditional right to intervene, Fed. R. Civ. P.
24(a)(1, intervention of right is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P.
24(a)(2) which provides in full:
Upon timely application5/ anyone shall be
permitted to intervene in an action:...(2)
when the applicant claims an interest
relating to the property or transaction which
is the subject of the action and the
applicant is so situated that the disposition
of the action may as a practical matter
impair or impede the applicant’s ability to
protect that interest, unless the applicant’s
interest is adequately represented by
existing parties.
A four part test is applied under Rule 14(a):
(1) the application for intervention must be
timely; (2) the applicant must have a
“significant protectable” interest related to
the property or transaction that is the
subject of the action; (3) the applicant must
be so situated that the disposition of the
action may as a practical matter, impair or
impede the applicant’s ability to protect
that interest; and (4) the applicant’s
interest must be not be adequately
represented by the existing parties in the
lawsuit.
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810,
817 (9th Cir. 2001). Accord United States v. Alisal Water Corp.,
370 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir. 2004).
As already shown at 6-9, supra, the subject matter of this
action pertains to sovereign rights held by the State of Alaska,

5

/
An application to intervene both of right and for permissive
intervention must be timely made. Defendants agree that given the
posture of this case, the present motion to intervene is timely.

and not to rights held by the movants. Movants do not have a
protectable interest in these sovereign rights.
In order to have a protectable interest, the proposed
intervenor must:
establish that (1) ‘the interest [asserted]
is protectable under some law,’ and (2) there
is a ‘relationship between the legally
protectable interest and the claims at
issue.’
Northwest Forest Resource Council v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 825, 837
(9th Cir. 1996). The interest is “significantly protectable if
the interest is protected by law and there is a relationship
between the legally protectable interest and the plaintiff’s
claims.” United States v. Alisal Water Corp., 370 F.3d at 919.
The interest movants seek to enforce is their alleged right
“to common use of State land as guaranteed by Article 8 of the
Alaska Constitution.” Proposed Intervenors’ Complaint for
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ¶¶ 9, 11, 13, 15. Article 8 of
the Alaska Constitution, however, does not provide for common use
of State land. With respect to lands Article 8, § 2 provides only
that the legislature:
shall provide for the utilization,
development, and conservation of all natural
resources belonging to the State, including
land and waters, for the maximum benefit of
the people.
The Common Use clause, Section 3 of Article 8, pertains to fish,
wildlife and waters occurring in their natural state, not to

lands.
In any event, movants have not shown that their interests
will not be adequately represented by the State. One, they agree
that they have been adequately represented so far. Memorandum in
Support of Motion for Leave to Intervene as Plaintiffs, at 2:
“Appellants do not contend the State has failed, at least to this
point, to provide adequate representation of their position in
this matter.” Two, they do not even contend that in the future
the State might fail to adequately represent their interests.
They state only that they would be the only party “representing
citizens losing existing subsistence opportunities;” therefore,
their “participation would thus contribute an important
perspective in this matter that would not otherwise not be
represented.” Id. at 2-3. Whether their participation would
contribute anything or not is not the test. The test is whether
their interests will not be adequately represented by the parties
already present. Movants have not made that required showing.
Further, movants seek to present the very same claims that
have already been presented by the State of Alaska. In that
situation “a compelling showing should be required to demonstrate
inadequate representation.” Arakaki v. Cayetano, 324 F.3d 1078,
1086 (9th Cir. 2003), cert. denied sub nom. Hoohuli v. Lingle,
540 U.S. 1017 (2003). Movants clearly fail to make that
compelling showing. In the absence of that “compelling showing,

MOTION TO INTERVENE

- 14 -

Case 3:05-cv-00006-HRH

Document 46

it is to be presumed that the State will adequately represent the
interests of its citizens.” Id.
For the foregoing reasons, movants have failed to show that
they are entitled to intervene in this action as a matter of
right.
B. Permissive Intervention. There is no statute which grants
any conditional right to intervene in this action. Therefore,
intervention “may” in the discretion of the court be granted
“when an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a
question of law or fact in common.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).
Permissive intervention may be granted where the applicant for
intervention shows:
‘(1) independent grounds for jurisdiction;
(2) the motion is timely; and (3) the
applicant’s claim or defense, and the main
action, have a question of law or a question
of fact in common.’
United States v. City of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391, 403 (9th Cir.
2002).
Timeliness is not an issue. Further, since the movants
propose to state the very same claims as the State has presented
in Case No. A05-0158-CV, common questions of law and fact would
be presented. However, since as already shown at 2-9, supra.,
their proposed action is barred by statute of limitations and
they lack standing to bring their proposed claims, movants cannot
bring an independent action in this case. Therefore, permissive

MOTION TO INTERVENE

- 15 -

Case 3:05-cv-00006-HRH

Document 46

Filed 02/02/2006

Page 16 of 17

intervention should also be denied.
However, assuming that movants could be granted permissive
intervention, the court, in determining whether to exercise its
discretion and grant permissive intervention, should also
evaluate “whether the movant’s ‘interests are adequately
represented by existing parties.’” Venegas v. Skaggs, 867 F.2d
527, 530 (9th Cir. 1989). As already shown above, movants’
interests are already fully and adequately represented by the
State of Alaska. Therefore, permissive intervention should also
be denied on that ground.
V. MOVANTS MUST INTERVENE IN A SPECIFIC CASE
Movants do not identify the specific case in which they
propose to intervene. This proceedings is a consolidation of two
actions: Katie John et al. v. United States et al., No. A05-0006CV(HRH), and State of Alaska v. Gale Norton et al., No. A05-0158CV(HRH). While cases may be consolidated, consolidation is merely
a procedural device that does not effect a merger of the separate
actions, and the individual cases do not lose their individual
identity. Cole v. Schenley Industries, Inc., 563 F.2d 35, 38 (2nd
Cir. 1977). Therefore, if movants are permitted to intervene,
that intervention must be in a specific action, and not in the
consolidated proceeding. Given the claims movants propose to
present, presumably that intervention would be in State of Alaska
v. Gale Norton et al., No. A05-0158-CV(HRH).
