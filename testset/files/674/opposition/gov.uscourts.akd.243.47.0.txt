Wildlife Federation and Outdoor Council ( AOC ), the Alaska Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Fund ( AFWCF ), Michael Tinker, and John Conrad. (Dkt. No. 37).
This proceeding consists of two related cases, one brought by the State of Alaska to
challenge agency rule-making under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) 5 U.S.C.
706(2), State v. Norton, No. A05-0158-CV (HRH); and the other brought pursuant to the APA
and section 807 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), 16 U.S.C.
3117 to challenge the United States failure to provide a priority for subsistence uses on Alaska
Native Allotments and in waters that extend upstream and downstream from ANILCA s
Conservation System Units ( CSUs ), Katie John v. United States, No. A05-006-CV (HRH).
Proposed Intervenors fail to specify which case they seek to intervene in other then to
state that they move to intervene in this case as Plaintiffs aligned with Plaintiff State of Alaska.
Interv. Mot. at 2 (Dkt. No. 37). Since the State of Alaska is party to only one of these
consolidated cases, it must be assumed that Applicants seek intervention in State v. Norton, No.
A05-0158-CV (HRH).1 Katie John, et. al. hereby join in the Defendants Opposition to Motion
to Intervene (Dkt. No. 46) on the grounds that movants have not met the requirements for
intervention of right pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), or the requirements for permissive
intervention pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b), and that movants proposed claims are barred by
the statute of limitations, would present claims which movants lack standing to present, or fail to
state claims upon which relief can be granted.

Independent of the State s interests in State v. Norton, No. A05-0158-CV (HRH),
Proposed Intervenors have not alleged a significant protectable interest under ANILCA that
movants would be required to establish pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) for purposes of
intervention in Katie John v. United States, No. A05-006-CV (HRH).
