Conservation Fund (“AFWCF”), Michael Tinker, and John Conrad (collectively
“Applicants”) hereby move to intervene in this case as Plaintiffs aligned with
Plaintiff State of Alaska.
Applicants assert that they, as citizens and citizen-groups, have a right to
State management of fish and wildlife on State Lands. The 1999 Federal
rulemaking at issue in this lawsuit improperly deems areas of State land as “Public
Land” susceptible to Federal fish and wildlife management. Therefore, Applicants
allege the Federal regulations at issue deprive them of their right to State
management on such lands, their right to common use of such lands and, in the
case of Alaskans deemed “non-rural,” their right under State management to
subsistence hunt or fish on such lands. This motion is supported by the attached
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Leave to Intervene and declarations.
Dated January 12, 2006.
