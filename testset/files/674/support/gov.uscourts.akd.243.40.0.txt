The Alaska Constitution mandates that Fish and Wildlife on State land be
managed for the common use of all Alaskans, regardless of where they happen to

live. This lawsuit involves a challenge under the Administrative Procedures Act
that 1999 Federal Regulations improperly deem certain State land as “Public
Land,” thus bringing such lands under Federal management. Under Federal
Subsistence Regulations, only certain rural Alaskans are eligible to hunt and fish.
Such a management scheme on State land denies non-rural Alaskans their state
constitutional right to common use of Alaska’s natural resources.
The Alaska Fish and Wildlife Federation and Outdoor Council (commonly
known as the Alaska Outdoor Council (“AOC”)), the Alaska Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Fund (“AFWCF”), Michael Tinker, and John Conrad (collectively
“Applicants”) seek to intervene in this case. These Applicants represent Alaska
citizens who for decades have depended upon subsistence fish and wildlife taken
from land now deemed “Public Land” by the challenged regulations. Application
of the challenged regulations has harmed, and will continue to harm, Applicants
and their constituent members, as they may no longer engage in their relied-upon
subsistence activities on large areas of what they contend are properly State land.
Applicants share the position of Plaintiff State of Alaska in this matter.
Applicants do not contend the State has failed, at least to this point, to provide
adequate representation of their position in this matter. Nonetheless, Applicants
request the Court exercise its discretion to allow them limited intervenor status,
such as that afforded the NARF Plaintiffs. Applicants would be the only party
representing citizens losing existing subsistence opportunities if the challenged

regulations are upheld. Applicants’ participation would thus contribute an
important perspective to this matter that would otherwise not be presented.
I.

FACTS
The Applicants incorporate the Statutory Framework and Factual

Background provided by Plaintiff State of Alaska in Paragraphs 10-45 of its
Complaint. (State of Alaska Compl. at 4-14) Additionally, Applicants present the
following facts:
AOC is a 501c(4) corporation with a collective membership of over 12,000
Alaskans. (Decl. of Teresa Sager Aubaugh ¶ 3) These members come from 39
affiliated outdoor clubs across the State. (Id. ¶ 4) AOC members from both rural
and non-rural areas depend upon almost every major river system in the State for
their food and personhood. (Id. ¶ 6) Many non-rural AOC members and their
families have subsistence fished in these rivers for decades under State
management and would continue to do so today if permitted. (Id. ¶ 7) Therefore,
promotion of common use of Alaska’s fish and wildlife resources is a core goal of
AOC and has been since its founding in 1955. (Id. ¶ 8)
Applicant AFWCF is a 501(c)(3) Alaska nonprofit corporation. (Id. ¶ 9)
AFWCF is administered by the same Board of Directors as AOC and represents
the same membership and core goals as AOC. (Id.)
Applicant Michael Tinker and his family rely upon salmon subsistence
caught in a fish wheel. (Decl. of Michael Tinker ¶ 5) Mr. Tinker holds a State of

Alaska Subsistence Permit to operate the fish wheel on the Copper River near
Gakona. (Id. ¶ 3) Mr. Tinker and his family have participated in this fishery since
the mid-1980s. (Id. ¶ 2) Since 2000, Mr. Tinker has been the registered owner of
the fish wheel. (Id. ¶ 3) In 2000 he purchased property in Gakona, Alaska
specifically for the purpose of operating the fish wheel. (Id. ¶ 4) Mr. Tinker could
not practically or economically afford to replace this traditional family food source
were he denied use of his fish wheel. (Id. ¶ 5) Mr. Tinker, however, resides in
Ester, Alaska, well within the Fairbanks non-subsistence area for purposes of
Federal management. (Id. ¶ 7). Mr. Tinker is fearful that Federal takeover of
management of fishing on the Copper River could prevent him from using his fish
wheel.
Applicant John Conrad has relied upon subsistence-caught fish and game
for two decades. (Decl. of John Conrad ¶ 2) Since the early 1980s, Mr. Conrad’s
family has operated a fish wheel on navigable waters of the Copper River in the
vicinity of Slana, Alaska under a State Subsistence Permit. (Id.) Mr. Conrad now
resides in Eagle River, Alaska, outside of the applicable Federally-designated rural
area. (Id. ¶ 4)
In April 2005, the National Park Service informed Mr. Conrad that he could
no longer operate a fish wheel in the location the family had used for over 20
years. (Id. ¶ 3) The Park Service claimed Mr. Conrad could no longer use a fish
wheel or dip net on the section of the Copper River upstream of Indian River

without a Federal permit. (Id.) Mr. Conrad could not obtain such a permit
because, under Federal Subsistence Regulations, he was not considered a qualified
local rural resident of the Wrangell-St. Elias NP/P region. The Park Service
similarly ejected a number of other State-qualified subsistence users from fish
wheels in the vicinity of Mr. Conrad’s on the Copper River.
II.

DISCUSSION
Applicants request the Court exercise its discretion to allow them to

intervene as they would be the only parties directly representing and including
Alaska citizens who have lost, or would lose, current subsistence hunting or
fishing opportunities should the challenged regulations be upheld. As discussed
below, the Applicants proposed intervention is not likely to cause delay or
prejudice to the parties. Proposed Intervenors’ position relies upon the same law
and facts as that of Plaintiff State of Alaska. And Applicants seek the same
redress—essentially, a declaration that the challenged regulations are invalid.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 provides for both intervention of right
and permissive intervention. A party may intervene of right upon timely
application when:
the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which
is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the
disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the
applicant’s ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant’s interest is
adequately represented by existing parties.
Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2).

Permissive intervention is available upon timely application when “an
applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in
common.” Fed. R. Civ. Proc 24(b)(2). The Ninth Circuit has interpreted
permissive intervention to require the applicant show: (1) independent grounds for
jurisdiction; (2) the motion is timely; and (3) the applicant’s claim or defense,
and the main action, have a question of law or a question of fact in common.
Northwest Forest Res. Council v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 825, 839 (9th Cir. 1996).
A.

Applicants’ Grounds for Jurisdiction

Applicants base their intervention upon the harm they have suffered, or
imminently will suffer, from application of the challenged regulations. Mr.
Conrad alleges he has suffered actual damages in that application of the
challenged regulations has prevented him from subsistence fishing in State waters.
(Conrad Decl.) Mr. Tinker is fearful application of the challenged regulations will
cause him to lose the opportunity to subsistence fish from his own land on the
Copper River. (Tinker Decl.) Numerous members of AOC/AFWCF may lose
their ability to subsistence fish in major river systems throughout the State.
(Aubaugh Decl.) Thus, Applicants have a genuine stake in this matter and should
be heard in its adjudication.
B.

Applicants’ Motion to Intervene is timely

Timeliness of a motion to intervene is measured by reference to “(1) the
stage of the proceeding at which an applicant seeks to intervene; (2) the prejudice

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO INVERVENE AS PLAINTIFFS

-6-

Case 3:05-cv-00006-HRH

Document 40

to other parties; and (3) the reason for the length of the delay.” U.S. v. Carpenter,
298 F.3d 1122, 1125 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting County of Orange v. Air Calif., 799
F.2d 535, 537 (9th Cir.1986)).
Applicants’ intervention comes at a substantively early stage of this
litigation. While the consolidated cases have been filed for almost a year,
proceedings have been stayed for over three months of that time. The
administrative record has recently been collected and substantive briefing is now
ready to begin.
At this relatively early stage of the litigation, intervention should not
prejudice the parties. Applicants anticipate requiring no discovery beyond that
needed by Plaintiff State of Alaska. Applicants’ presence would not change any
deadlines already established for the case. Applicants’ Administrative Procedures
Act claims depend upon the same administrative record already compiled. And
Applicants seek only limited intervenor status allowing them to be heard should
their position differ materially from Plaintiff State of Alaska. In sum, Applicants
anticipate causing no additional delay, cost or complication to the existing parties.
Finally, Applicants have not unreasonably delayed moving to intervene.
Mr. Conrad’s as-applied injury only began occurring this past summer after the
National Park Service informed him he was no longer eligible to operate his fish
wheel on the Copper River. (Conrad Decl. ¶ 3) Although the challenged
Regulations are six years old, they are only now beginning to be applied. Thus

Page 8 of 22

Alaska citizens are only now suffering actual or imminent harm from the
regulations. Applicants have moved to intervene at both an early stage of these
proceedings as well as at an early stage of application of the challenged
regulations.
C.

Applicants and Plaintiff State of Alaska Share Common
Questions of Law and Fact.

Applicants’ claims are closely aligned with those of Plaintiff State of
Alaska. (See Proposed Intervenors’ Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
Relief, attached) Applicants have not pled separate claims, but rather adopted the
applicable claims made by Plaintiff State of Alaska. (Id.) As earlier noted, these
claims depend upon the same facts—essentially whether the Federal Agencies
properly applied the Reserved Waters Doctrine in formulating the challenged
regulations.
The reason Applicants’ claims depend upon the same questions of law and
fact as the State’s is that the State’s asserted right to manage fish and wildlife on
its lands derives from its duty to so manage these resources for citizens such as
Applicants. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U.S. 387, 453 (1987) (“The
state can no more abdicate its trust over property in which the whole people are
interested, like navigable waters and soils under them ... than it can abdicate its
police powers in the administration of government and the preservation of the
peace.”). The State’s inabrogable duty runs to Applicants, as citizens and citizensgroups of Alaska, in which the Public Trust Doctrine finds its basis not only in

common law but in the State Constitution. Owsichek v. Alaska Guide Lic. &
Control Bd., 763 P.2d 488 (Alaska 1988); Alaska Const. art. VIII, Sect. 3. Thus
Applicants are the ultimate beneficiaries of having the challenged Federal
Regulations invalidated and thus deserve to be heard in this matter.
III.

CONCLUSION
The Applicants have a genuine stake in this matter. Their claims are not

expected to significantly delay or prejudice the existing parties and are based upon
the same law and facts as the claims asserted by Plaintiff State of Alaska. Thus,
the Court should allow Applicants to intervene as Plaintiffs aligned with Plaintiff
State of Alaska.
