Defendants.

Case No. 4:09-cv-00350

VOCALSPACE, LLC’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6), Plaintiff/CounterDefendant VocalSpace, LLC, files this Motion to Dismiss and, in support thereof, respectfully
shows as follows:
I.
INTRODUCTION
Many of Defendant Lorenzo’s counterclaims should be dismissed. As specified below,
the counterclaims are either improperly pleaded or barred by statutes of limitations. Therefore,
pursuant to Rules 9(b) and/or 12(b)(6), dismissal is warranted.
Defendant Lorenso’s fraud, fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation and
statutory fraud claims (the “fraud-based counterclaims”) should each be dismissed. Each of
these counterclaims, as pleaded, is fatally defective for lack of an essential element. The
counterclaims appear—from Defendant Lorenso’s pleading—to rest upon unclear allegations
about the timing of an investment deal between VocalSpace and a third-party and the tax
consequences of that deal to Defendant Lorenso. The Counterclaims do not specify what, if any,
knowledge about the deal was withheld, and they do not elaborate how the deal impacted

Defendant Lorenso’s taxes or what role VocalSpace played with respect to taxes. With respect
to the fraud and fraudulent concealment counterclaims, Defendant Lorenso has failed to allege
that VocalSpace knew any representation was false or made a representation recklessly, without
knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion.

Defendant Lorenso’s statutory fraud

counterclaim similarly fails because it does not identify a false representation of fact or a false
promise. Also, Defendant Lorenso’s negligent misrepresentation counterclaim fails because he
does not allege that VocalSpace did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or
communicating information. Accordingly, Defendant Lorenso’s fraud-based counterclaims and
negligent misrepresentation counterclaim are fatally defective and should be dismissed.
Also, Defendant Lorenso’s breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraud-based,
negligent misrepresentation, conversion and unjust enrichment counterclaims should be
dismissed because they are time barred. The applicable statute of limitations for the breach of
contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, fraudulent concealment and statutory fraud counterclaims is
four years. Further, the statute of limitations for the negligent misrepresentation, conversion and
unjust enrichment counterclaims is two years. Based on the allegations in Defendant Lorenso’s
pleading, the counterclaims accrued, at the latest, in January 2006. However, these claims were
not made until February 12, 2010. Therefore, they are time barred and should be dismissed.
II.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
VocalSpace is a small, closely-held company that paid Defendant Lorenso hundreds of
thousands of dollars to assist with developing, creating and maintaining a highly-sensitive
codebase (“Code”) that is the foundation for VocalSpace’s entire product-line. VocalSpace
owns all right, title and interest in and to the Code and any subsequently revised versions, as well

Case 4:09-cv-00350-ALM Document 37

as any copyrights relating to the Code and products. VocalSpace trusted Defendant Lorenso
with the secrets of the company, granting Defendant Lorenso access to confidential and
proprietary information in connection with his employment with VocalSpace, including
codebase databases, customer and licensee lists, sales, future product and work-in-progress
information, company records, salary and compensation information, price lists and pricing
information. He was at all times a fiduciary of the company and trusted by VocalSpace to
maintain and safeguard company secrets.
Defendant Lorenso abused his position of trust within the company to gain access to and
steal this information, including the Code, to open a competing venture, Larkspark. Defendant
Larkspark offers products and services that are identical to the VocalSpace product-line. This is
not surprising—Defendant Larkspark’s “products” are derived from versions of VocalSpace’s
Code, a fact that Defendant Lorenso does not deny. Defendant Larkspark now competes directly
against VocalSpace and Defendant Lorenso has brazenly begun soliciting VocalSpace’s
customers and licensees, often under fictitious names, in order to steal VocalSpace’s business.
VocalSpace initiated this action against Defendants on July 23, 2009. Doc. No. 1.
Defendants filed their own Motion to Dismiss on August 31, 2009. Doc. No. 11. On January 29,
2010, the Motion to Dismiss was denied. Doc. No. 25. On February 12, 2010, Defendants filed
their Answer and Defendant Lorenso filed his Counterclaims. Doc. No. 26.
In Defendant Lorenso’s Counterclaims, he alleges that “VocalSpace promised Lorenso a
salary increase, bonus and 10% ownership interest in VocalSpace.” Doc. No. 26, ¶ 7. He also
claims that on or about July 29, 2005, VocalSpace sent him a “Commitment Letter” that changed
the terms of the agreement. Id., ¶ 8. He also claims that VocalSpace delayed delivery of the
ownership interest while VocalSpace closed an investment deal with a third party, Transcosmos.

Id., ¶ 9. Subsequently, he alleges, he was provided documents related to his exercising stock
options in January 2006. Id., ¶ 10. He claims that this series of events provides the basis for his
breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraud-based, negligent misrepresentation, conversion,
and unjust enrichment counterclaims.
III.
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
A.

Pleading Standards Under Rule 9(b)
Fraud claims are subject to the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). See Abrams v. Baker

Hughes Inc., 292 F.3d 424, 430 (5th Cir.2002); Williams v. WMX Technologies, Inc., 112 F.3d
175, 177 (5th Cir.1997). A heightened level of pleading is imposed for fraud claims: “In
alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting
fraud or mistake.” FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). “[Courts] interpret Rule 9(b) strictly, requiring a
[claimant] pleading fraud to specify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the
speaker, state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were
fraudulent.” Herrmann Holdings Ltd. v. Lucent Techs. Inc., 302 F.3d 552, 564-65 (5th Cir.2002)
(internal quotations omitted). Put simply, Rule 9(b) requires the complaint to set forth “the who,
what, when, where, and how” of the events at issue. ABC Arbitrage Plaintiffs Group v. Tchuruk,
291 F.3d 336, 350 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotations omitted).
“Although Rule 9(b) expressly allows scienter to be ‘averred generally’, simple
allegations that defendants possess fraudulent intent will not satisfy Rule 9(b).” Melder v.
Morris, 27 F.3d 1097, 1102 (5th Cir.1994). “The plaintiffs must set forth specific facts
supporting an inference of fraud.” Id. “If the facts pleaded in a complaint are peculiarly within
the opposing party's knowledge, fraud pleadings may be based on information and belief.

However, this luxury must not be mistaken for license to base claims of fraud on speculation and
conclusory allegations.” Dorsey v. Portfolio Equities, Inc., 540 F.3d 333, 338-339 (5th Cir.
2008).
B.

The Standard for Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)
Dismissal is proper if the Counterclaim lacks an allegation regarding a required element

necessary to obtain relief. Blackburn v. City of Marshall, 42 F.3d 925, 931 (5th Cir. 1995).
Conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice
to prevent a motion to dismiss. Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass’n, 987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th
Cir. 1993). Also, a statute of limitations may support dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) where it is
evident from the pleadings that the action is barred and the pleadings fail to raise some basis for
tolling or the like. Kansa Reinsurance v. Congressional Mortg. Corp., 20 F.3d 1362, 1366-70
(5th Cir. 1994).
C.

Defendant Lorenso’s Fraud-based and Negligent Misrepresentation Counterclaims
Should Be Dismissed Because They are Improperly Pleaded
1.

Defendant Lorenso’s Fraud-based Counterclaims Should be Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s fraud-based counterclaims should be dismissed because he fails to
allege an essential element of these counterclaims.

To maintain a fraud cause of action,

Defendant Lorenso must allege that VocalSpace (1) made a material representation, (2) was false
when made, (3) knew the representation was false, or made it recklessly without knowledge of
its truth and as a positive assertion, (4) made the representation with the intent that plaintiffs
should act upon it, and (5) Lorenso acted in reliance upon it and suffered injury as a result.
Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 322 (5th Cir. 2002);
Beijing Metals & Minerals Imp./Exp. Corp. v. Am. Bus. Ctr. Inc., 993 F.2d 1178, 1185 (5th Cir.

1993). Defendant Lorenso’s fraud-based counterclaims should be dismissed because he has
failed to plead that VocalSpace acted with the requisite knowledge.
Defendant Lorenso’s fraud-based and negligent misrepresentation counterclaims are
supported by the following allegations:
Dryburgh falsely represented in the July 29 Commitment Letter that VocalSpace
would have its attorney begin work on agreements for the option for 10%
ownership stake. VocalSpace never intended to comply with this promise at the
time it was made. Alternatively, Dryburgh failed to disclose that the attorney
would take months to complete the agreements or that the agreements would
have materially different terms than the Commitment Letter.
Doc. No. 26, ¶ 45. Defendant Lorenso also alleges as follows in support of the claims:
VocalSpace withheld the timing of the Transcosmos deal and failed to disclose
that Lorenso would incur a large tax burden if he was given a 10% ownership
interest after the Transcosmos deal closed.
Doc. No. 26, ¶ 46.
These allegations do not fulfill the knowledge requirements of Rule 9(b). Furthermore,
none of Defendant Lorenso’s other allegations in the Counterclaims suffice to fulfill the
knowledge requirement. The allegations do not indicate whether anyone at VocalSpace knew
when or if the Transcosmos deal would close. Further, they do not indicate that anyone at
VocalSpace knew how long the preparation of the legal documents related to Defendant
Lorenso’s ownership stake would take. Furthermore, his bizarre claim related to taxes is not a
proper basis for a fraud claim. It seems to imply that VocalSpace had a duty to inform Lorenso
that he was required to pay taxes, which it does not. For these reasons, Defendant Lorenso’s
fraud-based counterclaims should be dismissed.
2.

Defendant Lorenso’s Negligent Misrepresentation Counterclaim Should Be
Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s negligent misrepresentation counterclaim should also be dismissed
because he fails to allege an essential element.

The Fifth Circuit has found negligent

Case 4:09-cv-00350-ALM Document 37

misrepresentations claims subject to Rule 9(b) in the same manner as fraud claims. Benchmark
Elecs. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 723 (5th Cir. 2003) (evaluating negligent
misrepresentation in the same manner as fraud in part because both were “based on the same set
of alleged facts”); see also Biliouris v. Sundance Res., Inc., 559 F.Supp.2d 733, 737 (N.D. Tex.
2008) (dismissing negligent misrepresentation claim that was based on the same operative facts
as an insufficient fraud claim). Further, failure to plead enough facts to state a claim that is
plausible on its face for negligent misrepresentation warrants dismissal of the claim. Vikon
Intern., Inc. v. Sensorlogic, Inc., Civil Action No. 3:08-CV-1942-L, 2009 WL 2474669, *6 (N.D.
Tex. August 12, 2009). To recover for negligent misrepresentation, Defendant Lorenso must
allege that (1) VocalSpace made a representation in the course of his business, or in a transaction
in which he had a pecuniary interest, (2) VocalSpace supplied false information for the guidance
of others in their business, (3) VocalSpace did not exercise reasonable care or competence in
obtaining or communicating the information, and (4) the plaintiff suffered pecuniary loss by
justifiably relying on the representation. Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
& Co., 313 F.3d 305, 318 (5th Cir. 2002); First Nat’l Bank of Durant v. Trans Terra Corp. Int'l,
142 F.3d 802, 809 (5th Cir. 1998) (citing Fed. Land Bank Ass’n v. Sloane, 825 S.W.2d 439, 442
(Tex. 1991)).

Accordingly, Defendant Lorenso’s negligent misrepresentation counterclaim

should be dismissed for the same reasons as his fraud-based counterclaims and because he has
not pleaded enough facts to properly state the counterclaim.
The negligent misrepresentation counterclaim is based on the very same allegations that
provide the basis for the fraud and fraudulent concealment counterclaims. Rather than repeat
those allegations and arguments set forth above verbatim, they are incorporated by reference as if
fully set forth herein. Additionally, the Counterclaim wholly fails to allege that VocalSpace did

not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating any information to
Lorenso. Thus, the negligent misrepresentation counterclaim should be dismissed.
D.

Defendant Lorenso’s Breach of Contract, Promissory Estoppel, Fraud-based,
Negligent Misrepresentation, Conversion and Unjust Enrichment Counterclaims
Should be Dismissed Because They are Time Barred
1.

Defendant Lorenso’s Breach of Contract and Promissory Estoppel Claims
Should be Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s breach of contract and promissory estoppel counterclaims should be
dismissed because they are time barred. The statute of limitations for Defendant Lorenso’s
breach of contract and promissory estoppel counterclaims is four years. Geraghty and Miller,
Inc. v. Conoco Inc., 234 F.3d 917, 931 (5th Cir. 2000) (breach of contract); A.I. Credit Corp. v.
Thomas, 201 Fed.Appx. 232, 235 (5th Cir. 2006) (promissory estoppel). The counterclaims are
based upon VocalSpace’s alleged promise to provide Lorenso 10% ownership in the company.
Doc No. 26, ¶¶ 33 and 38. The counterclaims therefore accrued, at the latest, in January 2006,
when Defendant Lorenso claims he was provided documents related to the exercise of options
for stock in VocalSpace that did not conform to the alleged promise. Id., ¶ 10. Since the
Counterclaims were not filed until February 12, 2010, the breach of contract and promissory
estoppel counterclaims were, without a doubt, untimely filed. Therefore, the counterclaims
should be dismissed.
2.

Defendant Lorenso’s Fraud-based Counterclaims Should be Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s fraud-based counterclaims, including his common law fraud,
fraudulent concealment, and statutory fraud counterclaims, should also be dismissed because
they are time barred. The statute of limitations for these claims is also four years. Geraghty and
Miller, Inc., 234 F.3d at 931. Like the breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims, these
claims are based upon representations surrounding VocalSpace’s alleged provision of a 10%

ownership stake to Lorenso. Doc. No. 26, ¶¶ 45 and 52. Therefore, they also accrued, at the
latest, in January 2006, when Defendant Lorenso received the documents related to the stock
options.

Since the Counterclaims were not filed until February 12, 2010, the fraud-based

counterclaims are time barred and should be dismissed.
3.

Defendant Lorenso’s Negligent Misrepresentation Counterclaim Should be
Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s negligent misrepresentation counterclaim should also be dismissed
since it is time barred. The statute of limitations for this claim is two years. Geraghty and
Miller, Inc., 234 F.3d at 931. This claim, again, is based upon representations surrounding
VocalSpace’s alleged provision of a 10% ownership stake to Lorenso. Doc. No. 26, ¶ 45.
Therefore, it also accrued, at the latest, in January 2006, when Defendant Lorenso received the
documents related to the stock options. Since the Counterclaims were not filed until February
12, 2010, the negligent misrepresentation counterclaim is time barred and should be dismissed.
4.

Defendant Lorenso’s Conversion Counterclaim Should be Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s conversion counterclaim should also be dismissed to the extent it is
time barred. The statute of limitations for this claim is two years. Clower v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., Civil Action No. 2:07-CV-510 (TJW), 2009 WL 3083814, *2 (E.D. Tex. September 23,
2009). The claim is based upon the broad allegation that:
VocalSpace wrongfully exercised dominion over the Lorenso Code by entering
into contracts with other entities purporting to transfer certain exclusive rights to
use the Lorenso Code. VocalSpace has also represented that it is the sole owner
of portions of Lorenso Code.
Doc. No. 26, ¶ 54. Therefore, it also accrued when Defendant Lorenso learned of the alleged
contracts and representations. Since the Counterclaims were not filed until February 12, 2010,
any conversion counterclaim based upon contracts or representations Lorenso learned of prior to
February 12, 2008, is time barred and should be dismissed.

5.

Defendant Lorenso’s Unjust Enrichment Counterclaim Should be Dismissed

Defendant Lorenso’s unjust enrichment counterclaim should also be dismissed to the
extent it is time barred. The statute of limitations for this claim is two years. Elledge v. FribergCooper Water Supply Corp., 240 S.W.3d 869 (Tex.2007). The counterclaim is based upon
VocalSpace’s alleged failure to provide a 10% interest in the company. Doc. No. 26, ¶ 61. The
counterclaim is also based upon VocalSpace’s representations that it is the owner of “Lorenso’s
intellectual property.” Id., ¶ 60. Therefore, it accrued, at the latest, in January 2006—when
Defendant Lorenso received the documents related to the stock options—or when Lorenso
learned of the alleged representations. Since the Counterclaims were not filed until February 12,
2010, any unjust enrichment counterclaim based upon representations Lorenso learned of prior to
February 12, 2008, is time barred and should be dismissed. Further, any unjust enrichment
counterclaim based upon the failure to deliver 10% ownership of VocalSpace to Lorenso is also
time barred and should be dismissed.
III.
CONCLUSION.
For the foregoing reasons, many of Defendant Lorenso’s counterclaims should be
dismissed. His fraud-based counterclaims and negligent misrepresentation counterclaims fail to
properly plead the required knowledge.

Additionally, his breach of contract, conversion,

promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, fraud-based and negligent misrepresentation
counterclaims are all untimely. Therefore, these claims should be dismissed pursuant to Rules
9(b) and/or 12(b)(6).
