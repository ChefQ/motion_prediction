RESPONSE TO OWENS-ILLINOIS, INC.=S MOTION TO DISMISS

Plaintiffs opposes Owens-Illinois, Inc.=s (AO-I@) Motion to Dismiss.
Legal Standard
The purpose of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of complaints, not to rule on
a complaint=s merits.

Gibson v. City of Chicago, 910 F.2d 1510, 1520 (7th Cir. 1990).

In

analyzing O-I=s motion to dismiss, the court must accept all well-pled allegations as true, and
view those allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, drawing all reasonable inferences
in plaintiffs= favor.
2006).

McMillan v. Collection Professionals, Inc., 455 F.3d 754, 758 (7th Cir.

AWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need

detailed factual allegations, ... a plaintiff=s obligation to provide the >grounds= of his >entitle[ment]
to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of
1

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 2 of 12

the cause of action will not do ...

Factual allegations must raise a right to relief above the

speculative level.@ Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167
L.Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (Internal citations omitted). The pleadings comply with these standards.

Argument
Plaintiffs have pled two bases for relief: (1) O-I Adesigned and sold licenses for a patent to
manufacture fire doors incorporating asbestos-containing cores,@ and (2) AO-I also manufactured,
sold, and designed asbestos products, including without limitation fire door cores.@ (Ex. 1 at &4.
See also &20, &21, and &30.) O-I=s motion only discusses the patent and does not address the
allegations that O-I was the manufacturer of asbestos containing cores used at Weyerhaeuser=s
Marshfield plant. O-I incorrectly contends AThere is no allegation that Weyerhaeuser ever used
asbestos-containing products made or sold by Owens-Illinois.@ (O-I=s Brief at 1.) Absent any
argument as to the sufficiency of the pleadings about the liability of O-I as a manufacturer, the
allegations cannot be dismissed under Rule 12.

1. O-I=s Analysis of Patent Law
As to the patent allegations, O-I discusses patent law without relating the discussion to
the relevant standards of Wisconsin negligence and strict products liability law. Plaintiffs have
not pled a case of patent infringement or challenged the validity of claims made by O-I in

2

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 3 of 12

obtaining the O-I fire door manufacturing process patent. Rather, plaintiffs have pled that
negligence occurred when O-I sold a license to use a dangerous manufacturing process, was paid
for each door sold using this process, and plaintiffs were foreseeably injured.
Like anyone else, under Wisconsin law patent holders are liable to those injured by their
negligent conduct. For example, in Dolin v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,2014 U.S. Dist.LEXIS
26219 (N.D. Ill., 2014), a court held that a brand manufacturer can be liable after its patent has
expired to those injured by generic drugs following the patent=s design. The court said, Athe
foreseeability of Plaintiff's injury as a result of such negligence should not be controversial.@ Id.
at 16.
2. WI Negligence: Plaintiff=s Injury was Foreseeable
Plaintiffs have pled the following:
1.

O-I Adesigned and sold licenses for a patent to manufacture fire doors
incorporating asbestos-containing cores,@ (Ex. 1 at &4.)

2.

AIt was reasonably foreseeable to O-I that plaintiff and other workers working in
or in proximity to Kaylo fire door manufacturing operations at Weyerhaeuser
would inhale asbestos fibers released during the operations,@ (Ex. 1 at &23.)

3.

O-I Abreached its duty of care and was negligent@ by failing to warn and to
Ainstruct plaintiff, his employers, patent licensees, or others in the use of

3

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 4 of 12

precautionary measures relating to airborne asbestos fibers released during
production of Kaylo fire doors,@ (Ex. 1 at &26.)
4.

AAs a direct and proximate result of the acts and omissions of defendant above,
the plaintiff was injured(.)@ (Ex. 1 at &27.)

Taken together, these pleadings comprise a valid claim for relief under Wisconsin
negligence law, as the pleadings include allegations of duty (defined by foreseeability in
Wisconsin), breach of duty, causation, and injury.
Plaintiffs do not dispute the need to allege the existence of a duty under Wisconsin law.
The existence of a duty is determined in Wisconsin by foreseeability: AA defendant=s duty is
established when it can be said that it was foreseeable that his act or omission to act may cause
harm to someone. A party is negligent when he commits an act when some harm to someone is
foreseeable.@ Rolph v. EBI Cos., 159 Wis. 2d 518, 532, 464 N.W.2d 667 (1991) (quoting
Schuster v. Altenberg, 144 Wis. 2d 223, 235, 424 N.W.2d 159 (1988)). See Schilling v. Stockel,
26 Wis. 2d 525, 532, 133 N.W.2d 335 (1965) (A[T]he law is that if the act is one which the party
ought, in the exercise of ordinary care, to have anticipated was liable to result in injury to others,
then he is liable for any injury proximately resulting from it, although he could not have
anticipated the particular injury which did happen.@) (quoting Klassa v. Milwaukee Gas Light
Co., 273 Wis. 176, 182, 77 N.W.2d 397 (1956)).
Under Wisconsin negligence law, the liability of a defendant is Anot examined in terms of
whether there is a duty to do a specific act.@ Hornback v. Archdioceses of Milwaukee, 2008 WI
98, &24, 313 Wis. 2d 294, 310, 752 N.W.2d 862 (2008) (quoting Nichols v. Progressive

4

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 5 of 12

Northern Ins. Co., 2008 WI 20, &45, 308 Wis. 2d 17, 746 N.W.2d 220 (2008)). Wisconsin
courts follow the famous minority opinion of Judge Andrews in Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R.
Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99, 103 (N.Y. 1928), holding that A[everyone] owes to the world at
large the duty of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others.@
Hornback, 2008 WI 98, &22 (quoting Palsgraf, followed). Followed in Behrendt v. W.D.M.
Enterprises of Marinette, WI, Co., 2009 WI 71, &17 . Under this framework, a person is
negligent Aif the person, without intending to do harm does something (or fails to do something)
that a reasonable person would recognize as creating an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to
a person or property.@ Id. (quoting Alvarado v. Sersch, 2003 WI 55, &14, 262 Wis. 2d 74, 662
N.W.2d 350 (2003)).
For example in A. E . Investment the Wisconsin Supreme Court held an architect could be
found liable for not taking into account the condition of subsoil in design of a building. 62 Wis.
2d at 485-87. The building floor became uneven and the premises became untenable. The
building owner sued for lost income and the defendant architect demurred claiming no duty
existed. The trial court overruled the demurrer and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed,
stating:
A defendant's duty is established when it can be said that it was foreseeable that his act or
omission to act may cause harm to someone. A party is negligent when he commits an act
when some harm to someone is foreseeable. Once negligence is established, the
defendant is liable for unforeseeable consequences as well as foreseeable ones. In
addition, he is liable to unforeseeable plaintiffs.
...
The consistent analyses of this court reveal that the question of duty is not an element of
the court's policy determination. It is, rather, an ingredient in the determination of
negligence. We stated in Schilling v. Stockel, supra, 26 Wis.2d page 531, 133 N.W.2d
5

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 6 of 12

page 338, A. . . once an act has been found to be negligent, we no longer look to see if
there was a duty to the one who was in fact injured.@ In Cirillo v. Milwaukee (1967), 34
Wis.2d 705, 711, 150 N.W.2d 460, 463, we said: AThis court has often stated that 'harm
must be reasonably foreseen as probable by a person of ordinary prudence under the
circumstances, if conduct resulting in such harm is to constitute negligence.@ There is no
necessity, however, that the actual harm that resulted from the conduct be foreseen.

A. E. Investment Corp. v. Link Builders, Inc., 62 Wis. 2d 479, 485 (1974).
The question at the pleading stage is whether O-I=s conduct as alleged as makes the injury
unforeseeable as a matter of law. Accepting as true the allegations of the complaint, O-I had
notice of the dangers of asbestos as an ingredient, obtained the patent, licensed the patent, and
collected royalties for each door manufactured under the patent.
The O-I fire door patent stated Aasbestos fibers@ were Apreferably@ to be used in individual
strips which were tongued and grooved to fit together as the core of the composite fire door. In
the exercise of ordinary prudence, a patent licensor ought to know this construction process
involved extensive cutting to create the tongue and groove pieces, would release dust containing
asbestos, and foreseeably result in injury. The pertinent language in Patent No. 2,593,050 is as
follows:
The core or body of the panel consists of a light-weight, fire-proof material,
preferably hydrous calcium silicate with a spiculated asbestos fiber binder.
Such a material is now on the market under the trade name Kaylo.
[Underscoring added.]
...Said core consisting of a plurality fo articulated sections in the form of
individual strips extending across said core and joined edge-to-edge, the
adjoining edge surfaces thereof being formed with interlocking tongues and
grooves fitted together...
(Ex. 2 at 2, 3.) Since O-I itself was in the business of making the asbestos containing Kaylo
cores, the foreseeability to O-I is virtually undeniable.

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 7 of 12

Regardless of whether O-I=s patent required the use of asbestos,1 it was foreseeable to O-I
that asbestos would sometimes be used as part of the patented process. As licensors of a patent
known to potentially use asbestos, O-I breached its duty by failing to warn or Ainstruct plaintiff,
his employers, patent licensees, or others in the use of precautionary measures relating to
airborne asbestos fibers(.)@ (Ex. 1 at &26.) These actions could have prevented the harm that
was foreseeably caused by the use of O-I=s patent. Since asbestos was used at the Marshfield
door plant as an ingredient of the cores, the duty to protect by those actions exists. O-I=s
argument that no duty exists because a patent licensee need not use asbestos is irrelevant in a
situation where asbestos was foreseeably and actually used.
Since asbestos is a dangerous disease-causing toxin and since this fact was well known by
the 1940=s, a person who in the 1950=s prescribes the use of asbestos in a product it is licensing
ought to know, in the exercise of ordinary prudence, that such conduct might result in injury to
others. That is all that needs to be shown to go to a jury. See Klassa, 273 Wis. at 182;
Schilling, 26 Wis. 2d at 532; Schuster, 144 Wis. 2d at 235; Rolph, 159 Wis. 2d at 532; Nichols,
2008 WI 20, &45; Hornback, 2008 WI 98, &24.
Wisconsin courts have routinely held that even in Ahard@ or Aunusual cases,@ defined as
those Ain which the injury suffered is a remote or unusual result of the act claimed to be
negligent,@ the question of foreseeability should be submitted to the jury:
It would seem to be preferable to submit these hard cases to the jury in so far as
determining the issues of negligence and causation in the same manner as in the ordinary
case. If the jury does determine that there was negligence, and that such negligence was a
1

Which, reading the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, it did.

7

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 8 of 12

substantial factor in producing the injury, it is then for the court to decide as a matter of
law whether or not considerations of public policy require that there be no liability.
Pfeifer v. Standard Gateway Theater, 262 Wis. 229, 240 (1952) (citing Osborne v. Montgomery,
203 Wis. 223 [1931].)
In special circumstances, Wisconsin courts may determine after a jury trial that no
liability should be imposed even though a negligent act was committed. In Wisconsin, the
courts normally defer taking up the issue of whether public policy justifies a nonliability finding
by the court until a full factual record has been developed and a jury has been allowed to make a
negligence determination. See Thomas ex rel. Gramling v. Mallett, 2005 WI 129, &166, 285
Wis. 2d 236, 323 & n.54, 701 N.W.2d 523, 565 (2005) (noting that Aas with the constitutional
arguments, [this court] expresses no opinion on the dissent=s analysis, except to acknowledge that
this court retains the ability to limit liability based on public policy factors but rarely invokes this
power before a finding of negligence has occurred.@). As the court stated in Alvarado, 2003 WI
55, &18: AIn most cases, the better practice is to submit the case to the jury before determining
whether the public policy considerations preclude liability. Only in those cases where the facts
are simple to ascertain and the public policy questions have been fully presented may a court
review public policy and preclude liability before trial.@ This negligence case should be
submitted to a jury to decide.
Nonliability is a question of public policy and does not speak to the presence or absence
of duty. The Supreme Court observed in Schilling, 26 Wis. 2d at 532, Aour decisions since 1952
direct that nonliability be based on considerations of public policy rather than couched in terms

8

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 9 of 12

of an absence of duty.@ At this stage, plaintiffs have sufficiently pled that O-I owed a duty by
pleading the foreseeability of plaintiffs= injuries.
Moreover, nonliability findings are rare, restricted to cases where the imposition of
liability would Ashock the conscience of society.@ See Schilling, 26 Wis. 2d at 533 (A. . . in cases
so extreme that it would shock the conscience of society to impose liability, the courts may step
in and hold as a matter of law that there is no liability.@) (quoting Pfeifer v. Standard Gateway
Theater, Inc., 262 Wis. 229, 238, 55 N.W.2d 19 (1952)); and see Rolph v. EBI Cos., 159 Wis. 2d
at 534 (AThe essential rationale for limiting liability on the grounds of public policy is that the
imposition of liability Awould shock the conscience of society.@) (quoting Schilling).2
The sole case O-I cites as precedent for dismissing plaintiff=s negligence claim, Geboy,
was a federal court determination based on public policy after the facts had been fully developed.
The facts are distinguishable from those alleged in plaintiffs= pleadings. The ruling in Geboy
was based on the trial court=s determination that the defendants Aacted solely as a broker in the
sale,@ and the defendants Adid not have an affirmative duty to warn subsequent owners of any
dangerous conditions of which they had no notice.@ Geboy v. TRL Inc., 159 F.3d 993 at 997 (7th
Cir. 1998). The 7th Circuit stated:
(B)oth of these defendants had minimal contact with the vertical boring mill;
neither company had any occasion to foresee an unreasonable risk of harm in
that neither Chalmers and Kubeck nor Industrial Plant Services had the
opportunity (or affirmative duty for that matter) to view the rotating drive shaft
2

The Wisconsin courts have stated the following public policy facts are helpful in determining whether to so limit
liability: A(1) The injury is too remote from the negligence; or (2) the injury is too wholly out of proportion to the
culpability of the negligent tort-feasor; or (3) in retrospect it appears too highly extraordinary that the negligence
should have brought about the harm; or (4) because allowance of recovery would place too unreasonable a burden on
the negligent tort-feasor; or (5) because allowance of recovery would be too likely to open the way for fraudulent
claims; or (6) allowance of recovery would enter a field that has no sensible or just stopping point.@ Rolph v. EBI
Cos., 159 Wis. 2d at 534 (quoting Coffey v. Milwaukee, 74 Wis. 2d 526, 541, 247 N.W.2d 132 (1976)).

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 10 of 12

of the vertical boring mill in operation and to discover a potential risk of harm.
To expose every business that comes into contact with a product to potential
liability Awould shock the conscience of society because it would have no
sensible or just stopping point.@ Rolph, 464 N.W.2d at 673.
Id. at 1000.
Here, O-I had notice of the dangers of their patent and chose to both license and collect
royalties on use of the patent. Imposing liability on these facts cannot be said to Ashock the
conscience of society.@ To the contrary, imposing liability on a patent licensor that explicitly
recommends and profits off the use of a dangerous toxin accords with society=s sense of what is
just.

3. WI Strict Liability:
Plaintiffs have pled the following:
5.

ADefendant was in the business of selling Kaylo fire doors (including both patent
rights and manufactured cores),@ (Ex. 1 at &30.);

6.

ADefendant placed the Kaylo fire doors (including the patent rights) into the
stream of commerce with the expectation the patented process would reach
plaintiff and other users and consumers without substantial change,@ (Ex. 1 at
&31.)

7.

A sale of the patented process occurred in which O-I was paid Afor each door
sold,@ (Ex. 1 at &22.)

8.

O-I failed to investigate, test, warn, or Ainstruct Plaintiff, his employers, patent
licensees, or others in the use of precautionary measures relating to airborne
asbestos released during production of Kaylo fire doors;@ (Ex. 1 at &33.) and

9.

As a result of the defective process sold by O-I, which used asbestos in the
manufacture of the Kaylo fire doors, plaintiff was injured. (Ex. 1 at &30.)
10

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 48 Filed: 06/09/14 Page 11 of 12

Taken together, these pleadings comprise a valid claim for relief under Wisconsin law.
The Restatement (Second) of Torts, sec. 402A, adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in
Dippel v. Sciano, 37 Wis.2d 443 (1967), states:
(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user
or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to
the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if (a) the seller is engaged in the
business of selling such a product, and (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or
consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.
O-I was in the business of selling both the patent, which provided the manufacturing
process by which the doors were made, and Kaylo door cores. O-I had an interest in the sale of
the doors made by Weyerhaeuser pursuant to the royalty payment when a door was sold. As a
result of the defective and unreasonably dangerous condition of the patented manufacturing
process, doors were manufactured causing the exposures to asbestos. O-I was later part of the
sale of these products pursuant to the royalty paid for each door sold. The products liability
claim should proceed as pled under Wisconsin law.

Conclusion
For the above reasons, plaintiff asks the court to deny Owens-Illinois Inc.=s Motion to
Dismiss.
