Case No. 14-cv-161-wmc

OWENS-ILLINOIS, INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS
WITH ITS SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Owens-Illinois, Inc. (“Owens-Illinois”) submits this motion to dismiss with its
supporting memorandum of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs allege that Roger Seehafer was exposed to asbestos beginning in 1973
and contracted mesothelioma. Pls.’ First Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 12, 14, ECF No. 32.
Plaintiffs do not allege, however, that he was exposed to asbestos-containing products
manufactured or sold by Owens-Illinois. Instead, Plaintiffs claim Mr. Seehafer was
exposed to asbestos-containing Kaylo fire doors that were being manufactured by
Weyerhaeuser. Id. at ¶¶ 11-12. There is no allegation that Weyerhaeuser ever used
asbestos-containing products made or sold by Owens-Illinois. Nor could Mr. Seehafer
allege exposure because Owens-Illinois ceased the manufacture and sale of Kaylo in
1958, 1 and Mr. Seehafer allegedly began his employment in 1973. See id. at ¶ 12(a).
E.g., Gillenwater v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc., 996 N.E.2d 1179, 1188, 1200 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013),

Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ only claim against Owens-Illinois must be that it
“designed and sold licenses for a patent to manufacture fire doors incorporating
asbestos-containing cores.” Pls.’ First Amend. Compl. ¶ 4. Plaintiffs’ claims against
Owens-Illinois — as a patent licensor — fail as a matter of Wisconsin law. Therefore,
Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice because the
allegations fail to state any claim upon which relief can be granted against OwensIllinois.
LEGAL STANDARD
“A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state
a claim upon which relief may be granted.” Hallinan v. Fraternal Order of Police of Chi.
Lodge No. 7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2009). Under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must
include “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The short and plain statement under Rule 8(a)(2) must
“give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it
rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355
U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). Under the federal notice pleading standards, a “complaint must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550
U.S. at 570). “In evaluating the sufficiency of the complaint, [courts] view it in the light
most favorable to the plaintiff, taking as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and

353, 355 (6th Cir. 1998); Jackson v. Anchor Packing Co., 994 F.2d 1295, 1306 (8th Cir. 1993).

making all possible inferences from the allegations in the Plaintiffs’ favor.” AnchorBank,
FSB v. Hofer, 649 F.3d 610, 614 (7th Cir. 2011).
A motion to dismiss should be granted when the complaint does not plead a
cause of action recognized by the law of the jurisdiction. See Intercon Research Assocs.,
Ltd. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 696 F.2d 53, 55 (7th Cir. 1982) (affirming district court’s
dismissal of claim). Although ordinarily a plaintiff is given leave to amend, a district
court may dismiss a complaint with prejudice when it is clear that the plaintiff cannot
cure the defect. Bogie v. Rosenberg, 705 F.3d 603, 608 (7th Cir. 2013).
ARGUMENT
Plaintiffs’ product liability claims, which are pled against Owens-Illinois only as
a patent licensor, fail because they have no basis in Wisconsin law. No Wisconsin case
has ever recognized a product liability action—based on either negligence or strict
liability—against a patent licensor.

In fact, Plaintiffs’ allegations contravene Wisconsin

law and patent law.
I.

Plaintiffs’ Allegations Contradict Patent Law.
Plaintiffs’ allegations contradict both patent law and the patent at issue, U.S.

Patent No. 2,593,050 (filed Jan. 24, 1952), attached as Ex. A. 2 A patent “creates a limited
opportunity to obtain a property right in an idea.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft
Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 149 (1989). That “patent-right is incorporeal property, not
The Court may consider documents that are “referred to in the Plaintiff’s
complaint and are central to his claim.” Adams v. City of Indianapolis, 742 F.3d 720, 729
(7th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted); Wagner v. Dept. of Health Servs., No. 12-cv-463-wmc,
2013 WL 3776327, at *6 n.2 (W.D. Wis. July 17, 2013) (citing Menominee Indian Tribe of
Wis. v. Thompson, 161 F.3d 449, 456 (7th Cir. 1998).

susceptible of actual delivery or possession.” Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 260
(1891). “A patent is not the grant of a right to make or use or sell.” Siemens Med.
Solutions USA, Inc. v. Saint-Gobain Ceramics & Plastics, Inc., 647 F.3d 1373, 1375 (Fed. Cir.
2011) (citations omitted). Instead, a patent grants a negative property right: “the right
to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention.” 35
U.S.C. § 154(a)(1). Plaintiffs cannot maintain a product liability claim against OwensIllinois, based not on a product, but an idea.
Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ allegation is incorrect that Owens-Illinois “designed and
sold licenses for a patent to manufacture fire doors incorporating asbestos-containing
cores.” Pls.’ First Amend. Compl. ¶ 4. 3 It is a “bedrock principle” of patent law that
“the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to
exclude.” Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005); accord Aro Mfg., Co.
v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 339 (1961) (“[T]he claims made in the
patent are the sole measure of the grant.”). The invention claimed here by OwensIllinois exists only in the claims and not the specification of the ’050 patent. See Smith v.
Snow, 294 U.S. 1, 11 (1935) (“[T]he claims of the patent, not its specifications, measure
the invention.”); Comark Commc’n, Inc. v. Harris Corp., 156 F.3d 1182, 1186 (Fed. Cir.
1998) (“[L]imitations from the specification are not to be read into the claims.”).
The ’050 patent does not require asbestos. See U.S. Patent No. 2,593,050 col. 4 l.
34 - col. 6 l. 30 (filed Jan. 24, 1952). None of the claims requires asbestos. Id. Instead,

Even if Plaintiffs’ allegation was accurate, which it is not, it would not matter.
There is no viable product liability cause of action for licensing intellectual property.

the ’050 patent claims a “door or panel” comprising, in part, “a core of inorganic, rigid,
fire-proof, light weight material of a substantially uniform apparent density and
consistency throughout . . . .” Id. What core material a licensee, like Weyerhaeuser
Company, ultimately used in its fire doors did not depend on the ’050 patent or the
patent license with Owens-Illinois.
II.

Plaintiffs Have No Strict Liability Claim Against Owens-Illinois Based on Its
Licensing a Patent.
Although Plaintiffs assert strict products liability against Owens-Illinois (see Pls.’

First Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 28-34), no Wisconsin case has ever imposed strict liability on a
patent licensor. Strict liability extends only to “manufacturers, distributors and
sellers—those who place or maintain the product in the stream of commerce.” St. Clare
Hosp. of Monroe, Wis. v. Schmidt, Garden, Erickson, Inc., 148 Wis. 2d 750, 757, 437 N.W.2d
228, 231 (Wis. Ct. App. 1989). Wisconsin cases and federal cases applying Wisconsin
law have refused repeatedly to extend strict liability against companies that did not
place the product in the stream of commerce. See Tatera v. FMC Corp., 2009 WI App 80,
¶¶ 16-21, 319 Wis. 2d 688, 701-03, 768 N.W.2d 198, 204-05, rev’d on other grounds, 2010
WI 90, ¶¶18-19, 328 Wis. 2d 320, 786 N.W.2d 810 (refusing to apply strict liability to
provider of brake shoe linings it did not manufacture or sell that it had processed before
incorporating them into a finished product); Affiliated FM Ins. Co. v. Trane Co., 831 F.2d
153, 155 (7th Cir. 1987) (refusing to apply strict liability to a non-manufacturer product
designer); Geboy v. TRL Inc., 159 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (7th Cir. 1998) (refusing to apply
strict liability to occasional buyers and sellers or brokers of used industrial machine

-5-

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 37 Filed: 05/14/14 Page 6 of 9

products); Fish v. Amsted Indus., Inc., 126 Wis. 2d 293, 310, 376 N.W.2d 820, 828 (Wis.
1985) (refusing to apply strict liability to successor of manufacturer of defective
product).
To hold Owens-Illinois strictly liable as a patent licensor would require an
expansion of Wisconsin strict liability law — an expansion that the Seventh Circuit has
already held the Wisconsin Supreme Court would not permit. Affiliated FM Ins., 831
F.2d at 155. In Affiliated, the Seventh Circuit decided whether the Wisconsin Supreme
Court would impose strict liability on a designer of a heater, which was manufactured
by a different company. Id. at 154. The Seventh Circuit determined that, because no
Wisconsin case law permitted strict liability against non-manufacturer designers,
holding the defendant strictly liable would require an expansion of Wisconsin law. Id.
at 154-55.
Indeed, the Seventh Circuit explained the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s own
reluctance to extend strict liability:
We conclude that the legislature is in a better position to make broad
public policy decisions in actions based on products liability law. . . . The
questions concerning the effect on the manufacturing business, the
potential size and economic strength of successor corporations, the
availability of commercial insurance and the cost of such insurance are all
questions we cannot answer. These are the type of questions that the
legislature is in a better position to ascertain. If such a basic change in
corporation law is to be made it would seem reasonable for the change to
come about through legislation rather than court decision.
Id at 155 (quoting Fish, 126 Wis. 2d at 310, 376 N.W.2d at 828-29). Following this
reasoning, the Seventh Circuit refused to extend strict liability to a non-manufacturer
designer. Id.
-6-

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 37 Filed: 05/14/14 Page 7 of 9

Here, as a patent licensor, Owens-Illinois did not place or maintain any product
in the stream of commerce. See id. at 154-55; see also St. Clare Hosp., 148 Wis. 2d at 757,
437 N.W.2d at 231. Weyerhaeuser Company — not Owens-Illinois — manufactured,
distributed, and sold the asbestos-containing fire doors. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ First
Amended Complaint fails to state a strict liability claim against Owens-Illinois as a
patent licensor.
III.

Plaintiffs Have No Negligence Claim Against Owens-Illinois Based on Its
Licensing a Patent.
To assert a product liability action based on negligence, Plaintiffs must allege (1)

a duty of care on the part of the defendant, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) a causal
connection between the conduct and the injury, and (4) an actual loss or damage as a
result of the injury. Green v. Smith & Nephew AHP, Inc., 2001 WI 109, ¶ 55, 245 Wis. 2d
772, 810, 629 N.W.2d 727, 745. Duty is a threshold question of law for the court. Strasser
v. Transtech Mobile Fleet Serv., Inc., 2000 WI 87, ¶58, 236 Wis. 2d 435, 459, 613 N.W.2d
142, 154. Wisconsin law does not impose a duty on a company, which is in the chain of
distribution, but did not manufacture, assemble, inspect, or use the product. Geboy, 159
F.3d at 1000-01.
In Geboy, the Seventh Circuit affirmed judgment for five prior owners of a
vertical boring mill. Id. They never assembled, inspected, or used the mill. Id. Indeed,
two prior owners never had physical possession of mill. Id. at 1001. The Seventh Circuit
refused to impose a legal duty of care and create negligence liability, explaining that
“[t]o expose every business that comes into contact with a product to potential liability

-7-

Case: 3:14-cv-00161-wmc Document #: 37 Filed: 05/14/14 Page 8 of 9

‘would shock the conscience of society because it would have no sensible or just
stopping point.’” Id. at 1000.
Here, as in Geboy, Owens-Illinois did not manufacture, sell, assemble, inspect,
use, or even possess the products that allegedly caused Mr. Seehafer’s mesothelioma.
Instead, Owens-Illinois licensed a patent to Weyerhaeuser Company. Owens-Illinois’s
role as a patent licensor is even more remote and tenuous than the defendants’ roles in
Geboy. Absent any legal duty running from Owens-Illinois to Mr. Seehafer based on its
licensing a patent, the entire structure of his negligence claim—breach of duty,
causation, damages—fails as a matter of law. Geboy, 159 F.3d at 1000-01.
For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint fails to state any
claim upon which relief can be granted against Owens-Illinois as a patent licensor.
CONCLUSION
Owens-Illinois respectfully requests that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs’ First
Amended Complaint with prejudice.
