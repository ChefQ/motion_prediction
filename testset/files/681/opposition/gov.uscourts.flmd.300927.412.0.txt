BARN LIGHT ELECTRIC’S SUPPLEMENTAL
RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL
Pursuant to this Court’s Order [Dkt. 406], Barn Light Electric Company, LLC (“BLE”),
and Bryan and Donna Scott (“The Scotts”) (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”), by and through their
counsel, hereby file this Supplemental Response in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Compel
[Dkt. 372] (“Motion”). In support, Plaintiffs state as follows:
Mr. Colitz, arguing on behalf of all Defendants in this matter, advanced numerous
specious statements that Plaintiffs spoliated evidence. The context and intended effect of Mr.
Colitz’s misrepresentations is significant. That is, the misrepresentations were not happenstance,
slips of the tongue, or mere careless comments.

They were made to: (i) overcome fatal

deficiencies in Defendants’ substantive spoliation arguments, (ii) backfill gaps in Defendants
factual and legal theories for which they have no plausible explanation, and (iii) ambush at
hearings where Plaintiffs had no opportunity to scrutinize emails and representations cited for the

1

first time and outside of the pleadings. For manifest reasons, the Florida Rules of Professional
Responsibility roundly proscribe such tactics.
I.

MISREPRESENTATIONS OF FACT
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL

AND

LAW

PRESENT

IN

A. Mr. Colitz Improperly Truncated Deposition Testimony to Support His
Arguments About Improper Deletion of Emails by Plaintiffs.
In the Motion, Mr. Colitz improperly truncated the deposition testimony of Plaintiffs’
document custodian, Michael Koller, to falsely argue that Mr. Scott deleted a BAI email
communication during the pendency of this litigation. 1 Significantly, as Exhibit H to its Motion,
Mr. Colitz chose to attach a “mini” or “4-in-1” transcript of Mr. Koller’s deposition testimony,
including only the pages it wished for the Court to view. See Motion; Ex. H (including mini
printouts containing only pages 1-4 and 61-64 of the transcript). It is telling that in each of its
other exhibits, Mr. Colitz chose to attach full page transcripts. See Motion at Exs. L, Q, R & T
c.f. Ex. H. Upon further scrutiny, a reading of the very next page of the transcript, which was
omitted, wholly contradicts such an inference and makes clear that the Mr. Koller’s testimony
regarding Mr. Scott relates to 2012, long before the filing of this lawsuit. 2

Mr. Colitz’

presentation of Mr. Koller’s testimony, omitting testimony which it was undoubtedly aware of,
for the sole purpose of advancing its argument and misleading the Court, illustrates yet another
violation of counsel’s duty of candor to this Court.
B. Mr. Colitz’s Truncated Representations To Create The False Impression
That Plaintiff’s Conducted Only 12 Searches in Violation of the Court’s
Discovery Order.

1 See Motion at 11 (citing Ex. H, excerpt from M. Koller Depo. at 64:11-16 (“Q: Do you have any explanation as to
why this email [BAI_0000184] from August 3, 2012, was not received from ... Barn Light Electric, but we did
receive it from Bay Area Innovations? A: It could be that Bryan [Scott] deleted it from, you know, the server.”).
2 See Transcript of the Deposition of Michael Koller, at 65:1-11 (attached hereto as Exhibit A) (“Q. Okay. Are you
aware of any documents that have been deleted -- A. No. Q. -- in -- in connection with what may have been
requested in this case? A. No. Q. So Mr. Scott could have deleted these documents, but you didn't participate? A.
He could have deleted e-mails. Q. Yeah. A. Back in 2012.”).

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 3 of 11 PageID 11055

To mislead this Court regarding BLE’s full compliance with this Court’s Order [Dkt. 303
at 1(b)], after being fully informed otherwise in writing, Mr. Colitz falsely argued that “BLE has
confirmed that its search of the vault was limited to just 12 terms.” See Motion at 9. In fact,
the correspondence Mr. Colitz quoted from Plaintiff’s counsel clearly stated, “[W]e searched the
solidworks server for all 12 terms that the Court ordered us to, as well as the majority of search
terms proposed by defendants.” Id. at Ex. B. As noted in BLE’s Response in Opposition,
supported by a sworn declaration, BLE searched the SolidWorks server using a total of 100
search terms. See Dkt. 375 at 6-8; see also Id., at Ex. B at ¶¶ 23-25. Mr. Colitz filed the Motion
on December 12, 2016 and thereafter refused to correct the truncation. At the hearing, on
January 19, 2017 hearing, Defendants’ counsel attempted to explain the truncation as a
misreading of the email. H’rg Tr. at 38:1-25.
Likewise, in its Motion, Mr. Colitz falsely represented to this Court that BLE failed to
produce the purchase orders pursuant to this Court’s Order, attacking BLE’s good faith
production of approximately 40,000 purchase orders without any valid basis, resulting in the
unnecessary waste of judicial and party resources. See Motion at 4. (“Despite being ordered to
do so months ago, BLE has neither produced, nor offered a satisfactory explanation for the
absence of purchase orders identified on the Product Sold Report.”). At the conclusion of the
hearing on Dkt. 372, this Court held “[a]s to the purchase orders, fully appreciating the argument
in what has been presented, I'm satisfied fully that the production has been as required by the
Court's Order. There's been nothing presented to me to demonstrate that purchase orders were
not produced.” H’rg Tr., 102:2-6 (emphasis added).
C. Defendants’ False Attribution of Admission By Counsel Is A Complete
Fabrication Designed To Substantiate Thin Arguments that Documents
Were Deleted.

3

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 4 of 11 PageID 11056

Without proffering even a scintilla of evidence, opposing counsel made the baseless and
wholly fabricated claim in their Motion that “BLE’s counsel candidly admitted during a meet
and confer with the undersigned that the BAI-related documents were deleted, but has thus far
refused to acknowledge when such deletion took place.” Dkt. 372 at 11. Plaintiff’s counsel
never made such an admission to opposing counsel. This is supported by Mr. Colitz’s own
failure to mention such a meaningful admission in his own four-page, single-spaced account of
the meet and confer at issue. Mr. Colitz’s letter flatly contradicts the false allegation that any
such admission by Plaintiffs’ counsel was ever uttered. See Dkt. 372; Ex. A.
II.

MR. COLITZ WITHHELD EVIDENCE AND THE DEMONSTRATIVE
PRESENTATION WITH MISREPRESENTATIONS OF FACT THAT HE
RELIED ON AT THE HEARING
In what amounted to a calculated trial by surprise at the hearing on Dkt. 372, Mr. Colitz

presented alleged evidence of spoliation through a twenty-three page PowerPoint presentation
containing information he had not included in the Motion [Dkt. 372]. 3 This, following the
Court’s denial of its motion to file a reply, without disclosure to Plaintiffs’ counsel in advance of
the hearing, and without providing Plaintiffs’ counsel any opportunity to examine, respond to, or
prepare for such argument at the hearing. Dkt. 380. Indeed, in yet another misrepresentation to
the Court, Mr. Colitz admitted this purpose at a subsequent telephonic hearing, claiming it
disclosed its intended argument to Plaintiff’s counsel. 4 In reality, when asked what for basis of
its motion for leave to file a reply, counsel represented that it “intend[ed] to address [the]
allegation that the purchase orders in question have been produced. Let me know if you oppose
our motion.” See E-Mail Correspondence dated January 3, 2017 (attached hereto as Exhibit B).
3 See Dkt. 303 at 1(d) (“In all other respects, the motion is denied.”).
4 See Transcript of Telephonic Hearing dated February 16, 2017 (“H’rg. Tr. II”)(attached hereto and filed under seal
as Exhibit C) (“We then attempted to seek leave to file a reply brief, they opposed that, and so we were left with no
choice but then to raise those issues before the Court. So this idea that there’s a surprise is not very well taken.” Id.
at 16:23-17:2).

4

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 5 of 11 PageID 11057

Given the sophistication of the PowerPoint presentation Mr. Colitz proffered at the
hearing – which contained numerous graphics, call-outs and timelines – there can be no question
countless hours were invested in its careful preparation by Mr. Colitz. Further, it was not until
long after the hearing, upon the repeated insistence of Plaintiffs’ counsel, that Mr. Colitz finally
provided Plaintiffs with a poorly scanned copy of its PowerPoint presentation.
Once afforded the opportunity to examine what was proffered before the Court, it became
apparent why Mr. Colitz took such efforts to withhold from Plaintiffs presentation having the socalled evidence presented to this Court.
A. Defendants’ Misrepresentations To The Court Relating To The Electronic
Communications Of Former Barn Light Electric Employees
In his carefully crafted PowerPoint presentation, Mr. Colitz proffered what he repeatedly
misrepresented to the Court as email communications sent from former Barn Light Electric
employees, Jim Turner and Lauren Mitchell.

More specifically, Mr. Colitz made such

misrepresentations to the Court in referring to a slide which contained an email header, which
merely included Mr. Turner as one of several recipients copied on the email communication,
along with Mr. Turner’s email signature block cut and pasted to the bottom of the very same
page. See PowerPoint Presentation at 19 (attached hereto as Ex D).
On numerous occasions at oral argument, Mr. Colitz proffered this evidence and
expressly misrepresented to the Court that Defendants had identified an email sent by Mr. Turner
on November 7, 2014. See H’rg Tr. 18:18-19 (“We have an email from Mr. Turner November
7th, 2014.”); see also (“We have an email from Mr. Turner where he’s sent an email
November 7th, 2014.” Id. 18:21-23.). The email misrepresented by Mr. Colitz in support of its
allegation of spoliation, however, is not an email sent by Mr. Turner at all. Instead, he is one of
multiple recipients, cc’d on the email communication. Moreover, Jim Turner’s signature block,

5

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 6 of 11 PageID 11058

which appears in Exhibit D, was taken from some other source and then cut and pasted onto the
same page as the email header which appears at the top of Exhibit D. See Email communication
from Scott Dodson dated November 7, 2014 (attached hereto as Exhibit E) (which represents the
email the header originated from). Upon receipt of the Powerpoint presentation, weeks after the
hearing, the undersigned confirmed that Mr. Turner’s signature block simply does not appear
anywhere in the email misrepresented to the Court as sent by Mr. Turner.
Likewise, in an effort to substantiate its allegations of spoliation and for the premise that
the BAI document production is not a sufficient alternative source of the communications it
seeks, Mr. Colitz represented to this Court that he was in possession of an email sent by former
BLE employee, Lauren Mitchell, that was produced by BAI but not Plaintiffs. See H’rg Tr.,
97:22-98:1 (“So this is an email, Your Honor, this is BAI-9155. . . it’s an example of an email
we got from Bay Area Innovations that we did not get from Barn Light Electric.”) (emphasis
added). Contrary to Mr. Colitz’s misrepresentation, Plaintiffs did, in fact, produce the email in
question – months before BAI’s production of a duplicate email communication.

See

BLE0098689 (produced May 27, 2015) c.f. BAI009155 (produced Nov. 5, 2015) (attached as
Ex. F).
B. Defendants’ Misrepresentations Are Meaningful and Prejudicial to Plaintiffs
The record confirms that the misrepresentations of Mr. Colitz were considered
meaningful by this Court. See H’rg Tr., 71:16-20 (“And the two examples that I think at least
highlight some concern, which is why I focus on . . . Jim Turner, where there’s an email
produced of November 14th [sic], it begs the question as to when those email accounts were
deleted.”). Although it had an obligation to do so, Mr. Colitz did not even attempt to correct the
Court’s misapprehension at the hearing.
III.

DEFENDANTS’ MISSTATEMENTS OF LAW
6

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 7 of 11 PageID 11059

In support of its argument regarding the alleged relevance of email communications
between Plaintiffs and BAI, Mr. Colitz allege that such communications may show BAI was “a
third-party company hired to reverse engineer Hi-Lite’s products” and that BAI engaged in the
“rendering of Hi-Lite products.” See Motion at 2 & 4 (emphasis added). Hi-Lite’s copyright
infringement claims as pled in its operative counterclaims, however, each allege that BLE has
engaged in the unauthorized use of its photographs on the BLE website and in its advertising
materials.

See Dkt. 60 at Count VI, VII & VIII. Controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent

establishes, as a matter of law, that the copying, rendering or reverse engineering of a product or
product design cannot substantiate a claim of copyright infringement. See Leigh v. Warner
Bros., 212 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding copyrights do not cover the appearance of
an object depicted in a copyrighted photograph or useful articles). Thus, even assuming
arguendo Mr. Colitz’s allegations to be true, such facts are entirely irrelevant to Defendants
counterclaims for copyright infringement. Accordingly, even if this Court was to construe Mr.
Colitz’s allegations of spoliation to require a duty to preserve, because there is no relevancy to
the information sought, there can be no finding of spoliation. H’rg Tr. 103:10-14.
Second, with regard to Plaintiffs’ affirmative defense of implied license, Mr. Colitz
alleged that internal communications in 2012 regarding BLE’s interactions with BAI might
reveal BLE’s subjective understanding of the scope of the implied license Hi-Lite admits it
granted to BLE without any limitation at the time it delivered its works to BLE in 2008. See
Motion at 15; see also H’rg Tr., 98:5-21 (speculating that internal communications between
Lauren Mitchell and Donna Scott regarding BAI might reveal subjective “evidence as to what
they knew they could do and could not do with Hi-Lite’s images.”). Mr. Colitz’s allegations
regarding the relevance of 2012 communications relating to BLE’s interactions with BAI and

7

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 8 of 11 PageID 11060

subjective understanding of the scope of the implied license granted to it, even if assumed to be
true arguendo, fail as a matter of law.
The existence of a license is a full defense to copyright infringement. I.A.E, Inc. v.
Shaver, 74 F.3d 768, 775 (5th Cir. 1996). “An implied license is created when one party (1)
creates a work at another person’s request; (2) delivers the work to that person; and (3) intends
that the person copy and distribute the work.” Latimer v. Roaring Toyz, Inc., 601 F.3d 1224,
1235, 2010 WL 1253090, at *9 (11th Cir. 2010). “[A]n implied license is “limited to a specific
use only if that limitation is expressly conveyed when the work is delivered.” Karlson v. Red
Door Homes, Inc., No. 14-12371 (11th Cir. May 7, 2015) (Per Curiam) Latimer, 601 F.3d at
1235; see also Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., 555 F.3d 949, 956 (11th Cir. 2009) (explaining
that the court looks at “objective factors evincing the party’s intent, including . . . whether the
copyrighted material was delivered without warning that its future use would constitute
copyright infringement”) (emphases added in original). The Court’s focus is not on the
subjective intent of the parties, but on an objective inquiry into the facts that manifest intent. See
I.A.E, Inc. v. Shaver, 74 F.3d 768, 776 (5th Cir. 1996); see also Karlson v. Red Door Homes,
LLC., 18 F.Supp.3d 1301, 1307 (N.D. Alabama 2014) aff’d Case No. 14-12371 (11th Cir. May
7, 2015) (holding the copyright holder’s “subjective intent is irrelevant.”).
Hi-Lite has repeatedly admitted that the objective evidence establishes that it granted
BLE an implied nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, adapt, distribute and display the works it
transferred to Barn Light Electric. See Dkt. 377 at 6 (“[T]he objective evidence indicates that
Hi-Lite granted a nonexclusive implied license to BLE to use its copyrighted photographs. . . .”).

8

Case 8:14-cv-01955-MSS-AEP Document 412 Filed 03/16/17 Page 9 of 11 PageID 11061

Hi-Lite has also judicially admitted that it. It is undisputed that Hi-Lite has judicially admitted
that it failed to expressly limit the scope of use of the works it delivered to BLE in 2008. 5
Thus, according to controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent, “[b]ecause there is no
evidence that [Hi-Lite] intended to limit the scope of [BLE]’s use of [it’s works] at the time that
[Hi-Lite] delivered the [works], [Hi-Lite] could not have, as a matter of law, limited the scope of
the nonexclusive license [it] granted.” 6

Karlson, No. 14-12371 (11th Cir. May 7, 2015).

Moreover, as the Eleventh Circuit held in Karlson, the scope of the implied nonexclusive license
Hi-Lite granted to BLE is, as a matter of law, unlimited. Accordingly, because the scope of an
implied license is determined at the time the works are delivered to the recipient, and Hi-Lite
admits there was no express limitation provided to BLE upon delivery of the works in 2008,
Defendants contention that internal communications regarding BAI in 2012 are irrelevant to
show the scope of the implied license granted to BLE and must be rejected as a matter of law.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request entry of an Order: (i) denying

Defendants’ Motion to Compel Or, In The Alternative, Motion For Sanctions Due To Spoliation
[Dkt. 372]; (ii) awarding Plaintiffs’ fees and costs under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37; and (iii) any other
relief this Court deems just and proper.

5 See Transcript of the Status Conference of February 23, 2016 [Dkt. 300] at 77:3-84:23 (admitting Hi-Lite’s failure
to provide any express limitation whatsoever on the scope of use of the works upon delivery to BLE in 2008); Dkt.
227 at p.9, n.39 (setting forth Defendant’s admissions, deposition testimony, documents and affidavits further
establishing Defendant’s failure to provide any express limitation upon delivery of its works to BLE)
6 With regard to the scope of an implied license, courts in the M.D. Fla. have held that “even assuming that
[licensor] . . . attached conditions to the [licensee’s] use of his images . . . these conditions [a]re covenants, not
condition precedents to the granting of the implied license. Accordingly, any breach on the [licensee’s] part of these
covenants provides [the licensor] with a breach of contract claim against the [licensee], not a copyright infringement
claim.” Davis v. Tampa Bay Arena, Ltd., Case No. 8:12-cv-60-T-30MAP, (M.D. Fla. 2012) (Slip Op. June 27,
2013, Judge Moody) (granting summary judgment and finding an implied license for the use of photographs was
granted and any use outside of the alleged scope of the implied license was irrelevant to Plaintiff’s copyright
infringement claims since such claims would only lie in a breach of contract claim, not copyright infringement).
