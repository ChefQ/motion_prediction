1 needed to respond comprehensively to the motion.

The Declaration of Deputy Attorney General John P. Devine will show the following:

3

1.

The criminal prosecution of plaintiff – for events that are inextricably intertwined with

4 this lawsuit – is scheduled to begin on November 3;
5

2.

Only a fragmentary deposition of plaintiff has taken place;

6

3.

The efforts by defense counsel to solicit and obtain expert consultation and opinion has

7 been impaired because discovery is in its incipient stage; and
8

4.

Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment attempts to do an end run around the

9 Court’s order staying discovery.
10

Therefore, defendant CHP Officer Novosel requests that the relief requested be granted by

11 the Court.
Dated: August 28, 2008.
