DEFENDANT

BRIEF OF TROUT POINT LODGE, LIMITED, A NOVA
SCOTIA LIMITED COMPANY, VAUGHN PERRET, AND CHARLES
LEARY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR RESPONSE TO MOTION TO
REQUIRE COST BOND FOR APPEAL FILED BY PLAINTIFF

I.
INTRODUCTION
The Court entered Summary Judgment in favor of Defendant, Doug Handshoe, on
December 19, 2012 [Docket No. 36].
On December 26, 2012, Trout Point Lodge, Limited, a Nova Scotia Limited Company,
Vaughn Perret, and Charles Leary filed their Notice of Appeal of that decision to the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals [Docket No. 37].
On December 27, 2012, Defendant Handshoe filed his Motion for Bond on Appeal
[Docket No. 38] asserting that under the SPEECH Act, he was entitled not to attorney’s fees he
would incur on appeal, but instead to attorney’s fees he claims in the most general of terms to
have already been incurred at the district court level prior to appeal. He also claims $10,000.00
for the appeal with no substantiation.
{GP008924.1}1

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 2 of 18

The summary judgment in favor of Handshoe did not award any attorney’s fees or costs.
The time for moving for Defendant Handshoe’s alleged attorney’s fees pursuant to Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 54(d) was 14 days from entry of the summary judgment on December 19,
2012 [Docket No. 36], which means that Defendant Handshoe missed the January 2, 2013 filing
deadline.
In any event, Mr. Handshoe is certainly not entitled to any costs pursuant to Federal Rule
of Appellate Procedure 7 since that rule limits the costs to those to be incurred on appeal. In
addition, unlike many other federal statutes, the underlying statute here - the SPEECH Act - does
not provide that attorney’s fees may be included as “costs”. 28 USC § 4105.
Furthermore, the SPEECH Act does not automatically award attorney’s fees to Mr.
Handshoe incurred even before this appeal. The SPEECH Act authorizes the imposition of
attorney’s fees, but only if they are reasonable and absent exceptional circumstances. Id. This
should require a motion, notice, and judicial review.
Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Handshoe is not entitled to any appeal bond. Even if he were,
the amount would be limited to the costs incurred on appeal, excluding attorney’s fees.
II.
FEDERAL RULE OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 7 LIMITS THE APPEAL
BOND OR OTHER SECURITY TO THE COSTS OF APPEAL RATHER THAN
THE COSTS INCURRED IN LITIGATING AT THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL.
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 7 provides:
In a civil case, the district court may require an appellant to file a
bond or provide other security in any form and amount necessary
to ensure payment of costs on appeal. Rule 8(b) applies to a
surety on a bond given under this rule.
(Emphasis added.)

{GP008924.1}2

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 3 of 18

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 7 appeal bonds “are to be strictly limited to the cost
of filing a proceeding with the case in the Court of Appeals. “Costs for which a Rule 7 bond can
be required include only costs related to the appeal and only in an amount justified by that
necessity”. Federal Practice and Procedure § 3953. A bond under Rule 7 may not include
attorney’s fees, and may not be used as a surety against the original judgment”. United States v.
United Funding and Investors, Inc., 800 F. Supp. 879, 882 (E.D. CA 1992).
Further, in Vaughn v. American Honda Motor Co., the Court stated that “there is a split
among the federal circuit courts as to whether a district court has the power to award attorneys'
fees as costs pursuant to Rules 7 and 39(e) of the rules of appellate procedure when an
underlying statute provides that attorneys' fees may be included as costs.” Vaughn, Inc., 507 F.
3d 295, 299, (5th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Though the 5th
Circuit in Vaughn did not decide the issue of whether or not attorney's fees could be Rule 7
“costs,” it did make clear that the underlying statute must define costs as including attorneys’
fees. See also Chiaverini, Inc. v. Frenchie’s Fine Jewelry, Coins & Stamps, Inc., 2008 WL
2415340, at *2 (E.D. Mich. June 12, 2008).
Therefore, even if the Court were to find Plaintiffs’ argument set forth below to be
without merit on the point that Defendant Handshoe is entitled to no appeal bond, the appeal
bond must be limited to the costs associated with the appeal, which excludes any attorney’s fees
incurred on the appeal or at the district court level.
III.
DEFENDANT HANDSHOE IS NOT ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS
FEES ALLEGEDLY INCURRED AT THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL.
While in a proper case, the SPEECH Act does create the possibility of an award of
attorney’s fees to a United States citizen who successfully resists the enforcement of a
{GP008924.1}3

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 4 of 18

defamation judgment from another country, the award is not automatic. In pertinent part, the
SPEECH Act concerning the award of attorney’s fees provides: “the domestic court shall, absent
exceptional circumstances, allow the party opposing recognition or enforcement of the judgment
a reasonable attorney's fee.” 28 USC § 4105.
Mr. Handshoe had 14 days from when the summary judgment was entered, December 19,
2012 (Docket No. 36], failing in which his claim for attorney’s fees is barred. 1 Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)(B)(i).
“[The] motion for attorney’s fees must be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment . . .
” United Industries, Inc. v. Simon-Hartley, Ltd., 91 F. 3d 762 (766) (5th Cir. 1996).
In conclusion of this point, the Court entered summary judgment on December 19, 2012
in favor of Mr. Handshoe and awarded neither attorney’s fees nor costs. Mr. Handshoe had
fourteen days from that date (January 2, 2013) to move for attorney’s fees, and since he did not
do so, any claim for attorney’s fees is now time-barred.2
IV.
THE DISTRICT COURT ERRONEOUSLY FOUND PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO
PROVE THE ESSENTIAL FALSITY ELEMENT OF THEIR DEFAMATION CLAIM.
Beginning at page 10 of their Rebuttal Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for
Summary Judgment [Docket No. 16], Plaintiffs argued the striking similarity between Canada’s
default judgment rules on the one hand and the Federal and Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure
55 on the other hand. Those three rules are almost identical. Beginning at page 13 of the

1

Plaintiffs make the unnecessary argument Mr. Handshoe is not entitled to attorney’s fees
alleged to have incurred only because, even though FRAP 7 forbids, Mr. Handshoe erroneously argues he
is somehow entitled to them being considered in his requested appeal bond.
2

Mr. Handshoe also failed to move to alter the summary judgment within 28 days as required by
FRCP 59. Therefore, he also missed that deadline.
{GP008924.1}4

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 5 of 18

Court’s Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Granting Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 35], the Court erroneously found the Plaintiffs
failed to prove falsity. The Plaintiffs respectfully suggest the Court committed error in entry of
summary judgment for Mr. Handshoe when it found:
According to the record before this Court, the decision of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia does not contain specific findings of fact with respect to the
falsity of Handshoe’s statements. Because Handshoe did not defend against the
plaintiffs’ claims, the Nova Scotia court entered a default judgment, and the
focused solely on damages. A Mississippi court would require proof of damages
only if the plaintiff first proved the statements at issue were false.
(Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Granting Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 35].)
To support this proposition a brief analysis of federal and Mississippi Rule 55 is
necessary.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55 concerning default judgment provides:
(a)

Entering a Default. When a party against whom a
judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead
or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit
or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party’s default.

(b)

Entering a Default Judgment.
(1)
By the Clerk. If the plaintiff’s claim is for a sum
certain, or a sum that can be made certain by computation,
the clerk – on the plaintiff’s request, with an affidavit
showing the amount due – must enter judgment for that
amount and costs against a defendant who has been
defaulted for not appearing and who is neither a minor nor
an incompetent person.
(2)
By the Court. In all other cases, the party must
apply to the court for a default judgment. A default
judgment may be entered against a minor or incompetent
person only if represented by a general guardian,
conservator, or other like fiduciary who has appeared. If
the party against whom a default judgment is sought has
appeared personally or by a representative, that party or its
representative must be served with written notice of the
{GP008924.1}5

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 6 of 18

application at least 7 days before the hearing. The court
may conduct hearings or make referrals – preserving any
federal statutory right to a jury trial – when, to enter or
effectuate judgment, it needs to:
(A)

conduct an accounting;

(B)

determine the amount of damages;

(C)

establish the truth of any allegation by
evidence; or

(D)

investigate any other matter.

(c)

Setting Aside a Default or a Default Judgment. The
court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and
it may set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b).

(d)

Judgment Against the United States. A default judgment
may be entered against the United States, its officers, or its
agencies only if the claimant establishes a claim or right to
relief by evidence that satisfies the court.

Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 55 concerning default judgments provides:
(a)

Entering a Default. When a party against whom a
judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead
or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit
or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party’s default.

(b)

Entering a Default Judgment.
(1)
By the Clerk. If the plaintiff’s claim is for a sum
certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation,
the clerk – on the plaintiff’s request, within an affidavit
showing the amount due – must enter judgment for that
amount and costs against a defendant who has been
defaulted for not appearing and who is neither a minor nor
an incompetent person.
(2)
By the Court. In all other cases, the party must
apply to the court for a default judgment. A default
judgment may be entered against a minor or incompetent
person only if represented by a general guardian,
conservator, or other like fiduciary who has appeared. If
the party against whom a default judgment is sought has
appeared personally or by a representative, that party or its
representative must be served with written notice of the
{GP008924.1}6

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 7 of 18

application at least 7 days before the hearing. The court
may conduct hearings or make referrals – preserving any
federal statutory right to a jury trial – when, to enter or
effectuate judgment, it needs to:
(c)

Setting Aside a Default or a Default Judgment. The
court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and
it may set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b).

(d)

Judgment against the United States. A default judgment
may be entered against the United States, it officers, or its
agencies only if the claimant establishes a claim or right to
relief by evidence that satisfies the court.

The Nova Scotia Court might as well have been following both of these rules since the
procedure employed was precisely what the Federal and Mississippi Rule 55 requires. By not
defending Plaintiff’s case in Nova Scotia, Defendant robbed Plaintiffs of their opportunity for
discovery and cross examination. Instead, in the Nova Scotia proceeding, default was entered,
and the Court proceeded to a hearing on the damages. In Canada, as in the United States,
including Mississippi, when a party fails to appear and contest the claims asserted by the
plaintiff, the facts supporting the claims are thereafter taken to be true at the subsequent default
hearing determining the amount of damages to which the Plaintiff is entitled to receive.

See

Plaintiffs’ analysis of Nova Scotia Annotated Civil Procedure Rules Part 3, Rule 8 and Part 7,
Rule 13;3 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55, and Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 55 dealing
with entry of default judgment.

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 8 of 18

“If the court determines that defendant is in default, the factual allegations of the
complaint, except those relating to the amount of damages, will be taken as true”. Capitol One
Services, Inc. v. C.J. Rawls, 904 So. 2d 1010, 1018-19 (Miss. 2004). The rule is the same in the
federal practice, specifically the practice in this district concerning how to enter a default
judgment in favor of a defamation plaintiff when the defendant fails or refuses to answer or
contest the defamation claim. The recent decision before this Court in the Jackson Division of
Gamboa v. Grace Paint Co., Inc., 2012 WL 774995 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 7, 2012), held that when a
defamation defendant is in default and the plaintiff moves for default judgment, the Court
accepts the pleaded facts as true.4
In Gamboa, the plaintiff alleged in her Complaint that she was a married woman and the
defendant called her a nymphomaniac in the presence of other workers and that she had flirted
with him. The district court found these words to be defamatory per se, found that the defendant
was in default for not contesting and defending the Complaint, found the defamatory allegations
to be proven since they were not contested (including the pleading of falsity), and entered default
judgment against the defendant of actual damages totaling $5,200.00 as well as punitive
damages. Thus the Gamboa court granted a final judgment to a plaintiff in defamation, and the
plaintiff was not required to further prove falsity because the defendant was in default.
In entering summary judgment for Defendant Handshoe the district court in this case
correctly found that the “court entered a default judgment against him. As the Nova Scotia court
explained, the effect of the default judgment is that ‘claims against Mr. Handshoe are . . . to be
treated . . . as proven,’ and that Handshoe had admitted the claims against him. (Pls.’ Mot. Ex. 5

4

As Plaintiffs set forth in Section V of this brief, Plaintiffs’ allegations of falsity had to be taken
as proved since Defendant Handshoe was in default.
{GP008924.1}8

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 9 of 18

at 5, ECF No. 6-5; Pls. Mot. Ex. 3, ECF No. 6-3). The Nova Scotia court held a hearing on the
assessment of damages and heard evidence from Perret and Leary.”
Plaintiffs respectfully submit however, that the district court incorrectly applied the
federal and Mississippi law requiring the trial court to find a plaintiff’s allegations are deemed
proven as admitted, including in a defamation case (Gamboa), by a defendant in a default
judgment hearing.
In conclusion of this point, Plaintiffs respectfully urge the Court to consider that the Nova
Scotia default judgment hearing was conducted precisely as it would have been conducted in any
U.S. federal district court or any Mississippi trial court. Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint’s
allegations of falsity and proof of falsity at the default judgment hearing were, as a matter of law,
deemed to be true. Defendant Handshoe admitted falsity when he failed or refused to contest
them. Plaintiffs clearly proved the “falsity” element of their Nova Scotia defamation claim. The
Nova Scotia court agreed and so found in its opinion in favor of Plaintiffs.
V.
DESPITE NOT BEING REQUIRED TO PROVE FALSITY SINCE
PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS IN THAT REGARD WERE TAKEN
AS ADMITTED BY DEFENDANT HANDSHOE, PLAINTIFFS
NONETHELESS ALLEGED FALSITY IN THEIR COMPLAINT,
PROVED FALSITY OF SPECIFIC DEFAMATORY UTTERANCES AT
THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT HEARING, AND THE NOVA SCOTIA COURT
FOUND FALSITY IN ITS OPINION IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFFS.
During the briefing on the cross motions for summary judgment, Plaintiffs at every turn
clearly showed they alleged and proved falsity as a matter of fact in the Nova Scotia proceeding.
Despite this, the district court found the Plaintiffs failed to prove falsity.
Yet falsity was an issue for the Nova Scotia court to determine despite the default
situation because the Plaintiffs pleaded aggravated and punitive damages.

{GP008924.1}9

In Candian

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 10 of 18

defamation law, like United States defamation law, falsity is a critical issue to determining if
punitive damages are warranted. See e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 349 (1974)
(“[W]e hold that the States may not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages, at least
when liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the
truth.”).
In the landmark Canada Supreme Court case cited in this court's Order, Hill v. Church of
Scientology of Toronto, 1995 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1995] 2 SCR 1130, the Supreme Court of
Canada repeatedly stressed the issue of falsity in determining whether the award of aggravated
and punitive damages was warranted, including Defendant's “continuing attempt at character
assassination by means of a statement which it knew to be false.”
Beginning at page 8 of Brief of Plaintiffs’ Trout Point Lodge, Limited; a Nova Scotia
Limited Company; Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary in Reply to Defendant’s Doug K.
Handshoe’s Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs [Docket
No. 16] Plaintiffs, in meticulous detail set forth their Canadian First Amended Complaint’s
allegations of falsity:
“The First Amended Complaint Plaintiffs alleged they had been
misidentified in the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana political corruption
scandal and misidentified as Aaron Broussard’s business partner
and were involved in “fraud, kickback schemes, and money
laundering”. Exhibit “1” to Motion for Summary Judgment, First
Amended Statement of Claim, ¶12.
In paragraph 18 Plaintiffs again alleged the publications were
defamatory and false. Exhibit “1” to Motion for Summary
Judgment, First Amended Statement of Claim, ¶18.
The Richard Rainey story reported on by Defendant concerning the
Canadian Ethics Board was false. Exhibit “1” to Motion for
Summary Judgment, First Amended Statement of Claim, ¶33.
At paragraph 113 the Plaintiffs allege “Defendant’s publication
were replete with inaccuracies and an apparent inattention to basic
{GP008924.1}10

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 11 of 18

ethics and duties to check facts before publishing”. Exhibit “1” to
Motion for Summary Judgment, First Amended Statement of
Claim, ¶113.
At paragraph 115 of the First Amended Statement of Claim,
Plaintiffs alleged that “Defendant’s false publications held them up
to public contempt and ridicule”. Exhibit “1” to Motion for
Summary Judgment, First Amended Statement of Claim, ¶115.
At paragraph 116 of their First Amended Statement of Claim,
Plaintiffs alleged Defendant published his defamatory statements
“without caring if the content…. was true or false.” Exhibit “1” to
Motion for Summary Judgment, First Amended Statement of
Claim, ¶116.
At paragraph 130 of the First Amended Statement of Claim,
Plaintiffs alleged the publications at issue were “falsehoods”.
Exhibit “1” to Motion for Summary Judgment, First Amended
Statement of Claim, ¶130.
At paragraph 143 of their First Amended Statement of Claim,
Plaintiffs went so far as to allege the Defendant had lied about
them. Exhibit “1” to Motion for Summary Judgment, First
Amended Statement of Claim, ¶143.”
(Emphasis added.)
At the Canadian default judgment hearing Plaintiffs introduced two exhibit books of
documentary evidence supporting their claims the stories published by Defendant Handshoe
were false and defamatory. (Exhibit 6 to Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout
Point Lodge, A Nova Scotia Limited Company; Vaughn Perret and Charles Leary [Docket No.
6].)
As Plaintiffs also argued in their Brief of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge, Ltd., A Nova
Scotia Limited Company; Vaughn Perret, and Charles Leary in Response to Memorandum in
Support of Motion for Summary Judgment of Douglas K. Handshoe [Docket No. 20], beginning
at page 3, Plaintiffs outlined the Nova Scotia court’s findings of falsity:

{GP008924.1}11

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 12 of 18

“In its Decision, the Nova Scotia Court found ‘The plaintiffs were erroneously
identified as being connected with Mr. Broussard….’ (Decision, p. 5., Exhibit “5” to Motion for
Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge, Ltd., a Nova Scotia Limited Company;
Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary [Docket No. 6].) (Emphasis added.)
The Nova Scotia Court found “[t]he defendant is persistent in his statements that Trout
Point Lodge is somehow connected to the Jefferson Parish corruption scandal and has benefitted
financially from funds illegally obtained. The defendant knows that the original story linking
Mr. Broussard with Trout Point has been retracted and an apology published. In the face
of this the defamatory comments continued.” (Decision, unnumbered p. 46, Exhibit “5” to
Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge, Ltd., a Nova Scotia Limited
Company; Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary [Docket No. 6].) (Emphasis added.)
The Nova Scotia Court found “[t]hese unfounded statements about the character,
business dealings and financial acumen of these business men merit an award of damages for
each in the amount of $100,000.00.” (Decision, unnumbered p. 48 and p. 49, Exhibit “5” to
Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge, Ltd., a Nova Scotia Limited
Company; Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary [Docket No. 6].) (Emphasis added.)
The Nova Scotia Court found “I conclude the following factors in this case call for such
an award here.

The original story was retracted by the Times-Picayune in New Orleans,

nevertheless Mr. Handshoe continued to spread the defamation. ….” (Decision, p. 49, Exhibit
“5” to Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge, Ltd., a Nova Scotia
Limited Company; Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary [Docket No. 6].)
The Nova Scotia Court found ‘He commented on other business ventures of the plaintiffs
and other legal matters in which they were involved, misrepresenting facts and attacking the

{GP008924.1}12

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 13 of 18

reputations with statements that they were dishonest, fraudsters, and liars.’

(Decision,

unnumbered p. 50, Exhibit ‘5’ to Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout Point
Lodge, Ltd., a Nova Scotia Limited Company; Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary [Docket No.
6].) (Emphasis added.) One dictionary defines ‘misrepresent’ as ‘to give a false or misleading
representation . . . with an intent to deceive or to be unfair’. Merriam Webster’s Collegiate
Dictionary Tenth Edition.
The Nova Scotia Court also found ‘All of this is outrageous conduct in the face of true
facts about the plaintiffs.’ (Decision, unnumbered p. 50, Exhibit “5” to Motion for Summary
Judgment of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge, Ltd., a Nova Scotia Limited Company; Vaughn Perret;
and Charles Leary [Docket No. 6].) (Emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs respectfully urge the district court in determining whether to impose any sort of
appeal bond upon Plaintiffs to consider the overwhelming volume of Plaintiffs’ allegations of
falsity in the Nova Scotia proceeding, both in their First Amended Complaint and on the record
in the default judgment hearing itself, and also to consider that the Nova Scotia court specifically
found as a matter of fact that Plaintiffs proved falsity in multiple instances.
VII.
IN ITS SUMMARY JUDGMENT OPINION THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY
FOUND PLAINTIFFS HAD BEEN DEFAMED BY DEFENDANT HANDSHOE.
At page 3 of the order granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment the court
found:
Handshoe, apparently in reaction to his blog being taken
offline, then began an internet campaign to damage Perret and
Leary. Handshoe has published numerous entries on “Slabbed”
about Plaintiffs, many of which may be characterized as
derogatory, mean spirited, sexist and homophobic. Handshoe has
continued to use his reporting on “Slabbed” as a platform from
which to allege a connection between Broussard’s crimes and
{GP008924.1}13

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 14 of 18

Trout Point Lodge. Among other things, Handshoe has accused
Perret and Leary of being involved in a scheme in which Broussard
used a Canadian company to launder money proceeds of illegal
activities in Jefferson Parish.
(Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Granting Defendant’s Motion for
Summary Judgment [Docket No. 35].)
Whether the district court on Plaintiffs’ motion to impose an appeal bond finds upon
reflection it erroneously concluded that Plaintiffs failed to prove falsity or not, the court should
nonetheless consider its previous finding that Defendant’s publications were “an internet
campaign to damage Perret and Leary.” The court should not require Plaintiffs to post an appeal
bond.
VIII.
PLAINTIFFS NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AND REBUT
CERTAIN FACTS THE COURT RELIED UPON IN ENTRY SUMMARY JUDGMENT.
While perhaps merely dicta, the Court’s entry of summary judgment referred to matters
Plaintiffs cannot locate in the record developed before the Court on cross motions for summary
judgment. For instance:
At page 3 of the Order entering Summary Judgment, the Court found that Aaron
Broussard was indicted in the United States District for the Eastern District of Louisiana and
pleaded guilty to bribery and other charges in September 2012.
At footnote 9 of the Order, the Court noted that in the year of 2012 alone there were
approximately 60 publications on Slabbed referring to the Plaintiffs.
At page 15 at footnote 15 of its Order, the Court referred to the Louisiana Concrete
Busters litigation. The Amended Complaint mentioning the Plaintiffs in that litigation was not
filed in Louisiana until October 4, 2012, which is after the last brief was submitted by either
Plaintiffs or Defendant was filed on August 21, 2012. (Brief of Plaintiffs Trout Point Lodge,
{GP008924.1}14

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 15 of 18

Ltd., A Nova Scotia Limited Company; Vaughn Perret; and Charles Leary in Reply to Defendant
Doug K. Handshoe’s Supplemental Reply Memorandum dated August 21, 2012 [Docket No:
29].)
At page 15, footnote 15 of its opinion, the Court referred to Daniel Abel as a former law
partner of Aaron Broussard. See attached January 21, 2013 Affidavit of Daniel G. Abel attached
hereto as Exhibit “A”.
To the extent, if any, the Court entered summary judgment based upon any findings not
in the record, Plaintiffs request the Court to reexamine those points in determining whether to
require Plaintiffs to post an appeal bond.
CONCLUSION
As the Court exercises its discretion on whether to require Mr. Handshoe’s requested
appeal bond, Plaintiffs say the requested bond should be completely denied, but if granted, the
bond should be limited to costs on appeal, excluding any attorney’s fees.
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 7 clearly limits any such bond to the cost of appeal,
rather than any costs alleged to have occurred at the district court level, excluding attorney’s
fees. The Fifth Circuit has so interpreted Rule 7.
While Mr. Handshoe labels his motion Motion to Require Cost bond for Appeal filed by
Plaintiffs [Docket No. 38], he does not limit the amount of the requested bond to merely costs of
appeal but instead requests the unsubstantiated number of $60,000.00 on attorney’s fees and/or
costs.

Since Mr. Handshoe failed to file any motion for attorney’s fees within 14 days of the

Court entering summary judgment, his claim for attorney’s fees is now time barred.
Finally, the appeal bond should be denied even for the anticipated costs on appeal. The
SPEECH Act does not make the award of costs in favor of Mr. Handshoe mandatory whether for

{GP008924.1}15

Case 1:12-cv-00090-LG-JMR Document 44 Filed 01/22/13 Page 16 of 18

costs incurred at the district court level or potentially to be incurred on appeal. The SPEECH
Act allows costs at the district court level unless the case is one presenting exceptional
circumstance. This is such a case. This case is one of first impression. Plaintiffs have looked
for but are unable to find any other decision interpreting the SPEECH Act in a contested case.
The district court in awarding Mr. Handshoe summary judgment correctly found that Mr.
Handshoe had engaged in a campaign to damage Plaintiffs’ reputations, but Plaintiffs
respectfully submit that the Court incorrectly found Plaintiffs were not entitled to have their
Canadian judgment enforced since they failed to prove defamation’s element of falsity. Rather,
the Nova Scotia court conducted a default hearing precisely as any Mississippi state court or
federal district court would have conducted it after Mr. Handshoe failed to appear and contest the
allegations, including the allegations that the publications were false and defamatory. That being
the case, Mr. Handshoe is now legally bound to all of the allegations contained in the Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint being proven including defamation’s element of falsity.
Nonetheless, Plaintiffs did not rest on the presumption on the facts they alleged being
admitted by Mr. Handshoe. Instead, they set forth in intricate detail numerous examples of false
and defamatory publications uttered by Mr. Handshoe. They went to a hearing on the default
judgment and gave under oath testimony, after which the Nova Scotia court in multiple instances
found that Mr. Handshoe’s publications were not only defamatory, but were as a matter of fact,
false. For these reasons, the Plaintiffs request Mr. Handshoe’s Motion to Require Cost bond for
Appeal filed by Plaintiffs [Docket No. 38] be denied.
