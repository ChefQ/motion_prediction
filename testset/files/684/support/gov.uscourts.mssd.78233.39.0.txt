DOUG K. HANDSHOE

DEFENDANT

MOTION FOR TIME TO RESPOND TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
TO REQUIRE COST BOND FOR APPEAL FILED BY PLAINTIFFS

COME NOW Plaintiffs, Trout Point Lodge, Limited, a Nova Scotia Limited Company,
Vaughn Perret, and Charles Leary and file this their motion for time within which to respond to
Defendant, Doug K. Handshoe’s, Motion to Require Cost Bond for Appeal Filed by Plaintiffs
filed on December 27, 2012 and in support would show that Plaintiffs object to the relief
requested by Defendant Handshoe, that Plaintiffs’ response to that motion is due January 14,
2013, and that counsel for Plaintiffs needs an additional seven (7) days time within which to file
the response, particularly in light of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays intervening between
when Defendant’s motion was filed and when Plaintiffs’ response is due. Accordingly, Plaintiffs
request the Court to extend the time within which Plaintiffs are to respond to Defendant’s
Motion to Require Cost Bond for Appeal Filed by Plaintiffs from January 14, 2013 to January
21, 2013.
