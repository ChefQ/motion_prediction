I. INTRODUCTION

 

Defendant Cobalt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Cobalt'') opposes Plaintiffs Motion to
Disqualify Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich Lip ("Gray Cary"), and relies on this Memorandum
and the Declarations of Ian J acobson, Joann F. Rezzo, Dean H. Nakamura and Bnian L. Forbes,
and the Affidavits of Gael Mahony and James R. DeGiacomo.

This is a patent case under the Hatch Waxman Acct, brought by King Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. ("King") to enjoin defendant Cobalt from selling generic ramipril capsules in competition
with King's Altace(R) brand ramipril capsules. Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH (`Aventis
Germany"), is also a plaintiff, although it does not sell any competing products in the United
States and damages are not available as a matter of law under the Hatch Waxman Act. Aventis
Germany is a second-level German subsidiary of the French multi-billion dollar, pharmaceutical
giant, Aventis SA. Like many global enterprises, Aventis SA has chosen to avail itself of tax and
other legal benefits by creating more than a dozen separate subsidiary companies located around
the world.

The Hatch Waxman Act provides a unique incentive to file motions like this one to
disrupt and delay Cobalt's defense of the case on the merits. Under the Act, Cobalt cannot
obtain final FDA approval for 30 months or until it obtains a judgment in this case. King
therefore can ensure its continued monopoly of a $450 million annual market of Altace(R) for as

long as plaintiffs can prolong the litigation." With each extra week worth an additional $8

 

' See 21 US.C.0x00A7 355(c)(3)(B) (filing patent case under Hatch Waxman Act stays FDA approval of
defendant's generic drug application pending judgment or a period of two and a half years).

million in monopoly sales, it makes sense for plaintiffs to invest in even the slightest chance of
forcing Cobalt to spend the time and money necessary to start all over again with new counsel.

Plaintiff Aventis Germany argues that Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt in this case
violates Rule 1.7(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, which prohibits a
lawyer from taking a representation "directly adverse" to a current client. Plaintiff's conflict
theory is not based on any alleged representation of King, Cobalt's only market competition in
the event that the FDA approves Cobalt's proposed generic drug. Nor is it based on any alleged
representation of Aventis Germany, or even any parent company of Aventis Germany. It is
undisputed that Gray Cary has never represented either King, Aventis Germany or any of their
corporate parents. In order to premise this motion on an entity for which Gray Cary does any
work, plaintiff had to go outside this case, up through two European corporate parents, halfway
around the world, and back down to one of its French parent company's American subsidiaries,
Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Aventis US") in New Jersey.

According to plaintiff, Gray Cary's defense of Cobalt is "directly adverse" to its client
Aventis US. The official comment to Rule 1.7(a) makes clear, however, that a "directly adverse"
representation is limited to the representation of opposing parties in litigation. Aventis US is not
a party, and admits that it lacks any interest in the patent that would allow it to become a party.

Plaintiff tries to get around this critical fact in several ways. First, it argues that Aventis
US has a direct interest in the outcome of the case. Yet, Aventis US is not even a potential
competitor with respect to Cobalt's proposed generic ramipril here in the United States. Aventis

US sold all of its United States nights in Altace(R) to King back in 1998 as part of a $350 million

Gray Cary\SD\1 569262. 1 3
9999500-910400
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 48 Filed 08/15/03 Page 4 of 22

deal.' Further, Aventis US's supposed contractual right to a share of damages in this case is
misleading at best. As a matter of law, no damages are available in a Hatch Waxman Act case
filed before FDA approval of the proposed generic drug, and thus before any commercial sales of
the allegedly infringing product.

Second, plaintiff offers a conclusory declaration to the effect that Aventis US does an
unspecified amount of capsule manufacturing for King. Plaintiff chose not to offer any details
and withheld the alleged agreements from its document production. In public SEC filings,
however, King describes Aventis US as merely a "backup" manufacturer to King's own FDA-
approved manufacturing facility in Bristol, Tennessee.4 Here again, however, the official
comments to Rule 1.7(a) make clear that the rule does not apply to generally adverse competing
economic interests. It is not surprising, therefore, that plaintiff fails to offer any authority to the
effect that doing an unspecified amount of business as a contingent supplier to a party renders the
supplier "directly adverse" under Rule 1.7 to the party's opponent in litigation.

Additionally, plaintiff suggests that Gray Cary should be considered as directly adverse
to Aventis US in this litigation based solely on declarations describing an attenuated relationship
between the Aventis in-house counsel managing this case and the in-house management of Gray
Cary's unrelated work. Because the companies are not parent and subsidiary, plaintiff does not
even attempt to establish that the sister subsidiaries exercise any control over each other.

Instead, plaintiff traces a remote link between the management of the Cobalt litigation and

 

* See King Form 10-K, Exhibit 1, at 2.
4 See King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Form 10-Q for first quarter of 2003 ("King Form 10-Q") at 30, attached
as Exhibit 2.

Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 48 Filed 08/15/03 Page 5 of 22

supervisors of the Aventis US work. However, the declarations and publicly available
information show that the day-to-day management of the Aventis Germany and Aventis US
work is done by different lawyers, in different groups, in different departments, headed by
different vice presidents, and sometimes in different locations.

Finally, plaintiff relies on pure speculation that the ethical wall erected by Gray Cary is
not sufficient to protect Aventis Germany from any prejudice in the case and to guard against
any potential misuse of client confidential information provided by Aventis US. Indeed, plaintiff
does not identify any alleged prejudice or potential misuse of information. Yet, plaintiff insists
that the only appropriate remedy is to prejudice Cobalt's defense of the case by separating Cobalt
from its counsel of choice, with whom Cobalt has been working since last October. Even upon
finding a violation of Rule 1.7, courts do not necessarily impose the drastic remedy of
disqualification, particularly where, as in this case, the motion imposes prejudice on an innocent
third party rather than preventing any alleged prejudice.

Aventis Germany has not established a violation of Rule 1.7, or the need for the drastic
measure of disqualification. Gray Cary's implementation of an ethical wall is sufficient to
protect any confidences of Aventis US and avoid unfair prejudice to Cobalt. Disqualification is
an extreme sanction that is unwarranted based on the circumstances of this case. The motion
should be denied.

II. MOTIONS FOR DISQUALIFICATION ARF DISFAVORED.

"When deciding on a motion for disqualification, a court should proceed with caution."
Moss v. TACC Int'l Corp., 776 F Supp. 622, 624 (D. Mass. 1991). Since disqualification has an
immediate adverse effect on the client by separating him from the counsel of his choice and

because many times such motions are "made for tactical, not substantive, reasons and will most

likely cause delay in the litigation" courts have been reluctant to disqualify attomeys. See id.
See also Research Corporation T. echnologies, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 936 F. Supp. 976,
701 (D. Ariz. 1996) (disqualification can result in increased expenses, delay in resolution of
proceedings and deprivation of choice of counsel); NFC, Inc. v. General Nutrition, Inc., 562
F.Supp. 332, 334 (D. Mass. 1983) (Tauro, J.) (this Court held that when a less drastic alternative
than disqualification will preserve the ethical standards of the profession, it should be utilized),
Only in extreme circumstances should a party to a lawsuit be allowed to interfere with the
attorney-client relationship of an opponent. Research Corporation Technologies, Inc., 936 F.
Supp. at 701,

The mere possibility of a conflict is insufficient to justify the harsh sanction of
disqualifying a party's chosen counsel. The moving party must meet the heavy burden of
proving facts that disqualify counsel, Jd. (the moving party must show sufficient reason why an
attorney should be disqualified); Evans v. Artek Sys. Corp., 715 F.2d 788, 794 (2d Cir.
1983)(moving party bears a heavy burden of proving facts required for disqualification); Gov't of
india v. Cook Indus., Inc., 569 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1978) (a high standard of proof is required
to disqualify counsel); Paretti v. Cavalier Label Co., 722 F. Supp. 985, 987 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)
("mere speculation will not suffice"),

IH. GRAY CARY IS NOT DIRECTLY ADVERSE TO A CLIENT IN THE
COBALT LITIGATION.

Plaintiff moves to disqualify Gray Cary on the contention that Gray Cary is in violation
of Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 1.7(a), which prohibits a lawyer from
representing a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client.
(Emphasis added.) The facts, however, demonstrate that Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt is
not directly adverse to its client Aventis US and Rule 1.7(a) does not apply. See Comment 3,

Gray Cary\SD\1569262.1 5
9999500-910400
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 48 Filed 08/15/03 Page 7 of 22

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 1.7 ("Paragraph (a) applies only when the
representation of one client would be directly adverse to the other."').

A. Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt Pharmaceuticals is directly adverse to
King and Aventis Germany - not Aventis US.

Plaintiffs Aventis Germany and King sued Cobalt for infringement of United States
Patent No. 5,061,722 (``the '722 patent"). Aventis Germany alleges it is the owner of the '722
patent and King alleges it has the exclusive license to make and sell the product of the patent in
the United States. Aventis Germany and King are the only parties directly adverse to Cobalt in
this litigation.

Aventis Germany and King are not now, nor have they ever been, clients of Gray Cary.
See Declaration of Brian L. Forbes at 1 6, filed in support of this opposition. There is no
contention that Gray Cary has, or ever had, an attorney-client relationship with Aventis Germany
or King.

B, Aventis Germany and Aventis US are Separate corporations and not alter egos,
Aventis Germany is a German corporation and the wholly-owned subsidiary of the
German corporation Hoechst AG, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French corporation,

pharmaceutical giant, Aventis S.A. Aventis US is a separate corporation and a wholly-owned

United States subsidiary of Aventis S.A. The chart below shows the relationship of the entities.0x00B0

It is undisputed that Aventis US and Aventis Germany are separate corporate entities,

They are not alter egos. Aventis Germany has not, and cannot, contend that Gray Cary's

representation of Aventis US creates an attorney-

client relationship with Aventis Germany.

This is critically different from the circumstances of Teradyne, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard

Co., 1991 WL 239940 (N.D. Cal.). The law firm representing plaintiff Teradyne concurrently

represented a subsidiary of defendant parent company HP.

fd. at 1. The court concluded that

HP's pervasive control over the subsidiary justified disregarding corporate form and deemed

parent corporation HP a client of a law firm for conflict purposes, /d. at 4-5. Consequently the

law firm's representation of plaintiff Teradyne against defendant HP was directly adverse to a

client.

Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 48 Filed 08/15/03 Page 9 of 22

Plaintiff does not assert that Aventis US controls Aventis Germany such that their
Separate corporate identities should be disregarded and Aventis Germany should be considered a
Gray Cary client for conflict purposes. Aventis Germany and Aventis US are distinct and
separate corporate entities. They are not a single client for conflict purposes. Gray Cary's duty
of loyalty to Aventis US is not violated by its representation of Cobalt against Aventis Germany
and King.

Cc. The scope of ethical inquiry regarding whether there is a violation of Rule 1.7
is properly limited to whether the client is a party to the case or transaction.

There is no attomey-client relationship between Gray Cary and the plaintiff parties in the
case. Plaintiff contends that non-party Gray Cary client Aventis US has "a strong interest and is
heavily involved in the [Cobalt] litigation," such that Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt is
directly adverse to Aventis US. See Plaintiff's Memo at 5. But, Aventis US is not a party to this
litigation. The significance of this should not be disregarded since under the rules: "Paragraph
(a) prohibits representation of opposing parties in litigation." Comment 7, Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court Rule 1.7 (emphasis added).

This fundamental requirement of party identification was highlighted in a Formal
Opinion of the Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility and Conduct of the California
State Bar, regarding whether the duty of loyalty to a parent corporation is violated by bringing
suit against a subsidiary. "Legal authority interpreting the duty of loyalty limits the scope of
ethical inquiry to whether the other affected clients are parties to the case or transaction in which
the attorney is acting." CA. Eth. Op. 1989-113, 1989 WL 253261 at 4 (Cal. St. Bar Comm. Prof.
Resp.). The attorney's duty of loyalty extends only to direct adversity, the scope of which is

limited to party identification. Jd.

Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 48 Filed 08/15/03 Page 10 of 22

The cases cited by plaintiff in its discussion of the duty of loyaity clearly illustrate this
principle that party identity is required for direct adversity. See Plaintiff's Memo at 8-9. Those
cases uniformly address circumstances in which the firm was concurrently representing both
parties to the litigation. McCourt Co. v. FPC Properties, Inc., 386 Mass. 145, 147 (1982) (law
firm had concurrent attorney-client relationship with the defendant, while suing same client on
behalf of plaintiff); Ferguson Electric Co. v. Suffolk Construction Co., 1998 WL 140101 at 2
(Mass.Super.) (conflict arose when firm agreed to defend Suffolk in a lawsuit brought by its
current client, Ferguson); British Airways PLC vy. The Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, 862 F.Supp. 889, 891 (E.D.NLY. 1994) (law firm represented the Port Authority in a
number of personal injury actions while concurrently suing it on behalf of British Airways);
International Business Machines Corp. v. Levin, 579 F.2d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 1978) (aw firm
represented IBM while at the same time defending Levin against suit by IBM).

As a non-party, any interests of Aventis US in the outcome of the Cobalt litigation are by
definition indirect and therefore do not create a conflict under Rule 1.7, much less mandate the
extreme and harsh step of disqualification. See Affidavit of James R. DeGiacomo at 4] 7, filed in
support of this opposition.

IV. EVEN DISREGARDING ITS NON-PARTY STATUS, THE ALLEGED INTERESTS
OF AVENTIS US IN THIS LITIGATION DO NOT CREATE A CONFLICT.

Plaintiff presents Aventis US as an undisclosed "real party in interest" in this litigation.
The plaintiff contends that Aventis US has interests in the outcome of the litigation that are
sufficient to make Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt a matter of direct adversity to Aventis
US despite its non-party status. The interests of Aventis US in this litigation are indirect at best

and do not sustain a claim of direct adversity under Rule 1.7.
