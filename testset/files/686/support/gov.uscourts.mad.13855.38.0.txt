MOTION OF AVENTIS PHARMA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH
TO DISQUALIFY GRAY CARY WARE & FREIDENRICH LLP

Plaintiff Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH ("Aventis Deutschland") respectfully
moves this Court for entry of an Order disqualifying the law firm of Gray Cary Ware &
Freidenrich LLP ("Gray Cary"), including any and all of its partners and associates, from
representing defendant Cobalt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Cobalt") in this action. Furthermore,
Aventis Deutschland respectfully moves this Court to revoke the pro hac vice admission of
Steven A. Maddox.

As more fully set forth in the Memorandum of Law of Aventis Pharma Deutschland
GmbH in Support of its Motion to Disqualify Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP, Gray Cary's
disqualification is required because:

(1) Gray Cary has represented, and continues to represent, Aventis Pharmaceuticals
in ongoing litigation and patent prosecution matters.

(2) Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt in this case against the German affiliate of

its client, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, is directly adverse to Aventis Pharmaceuticals itself in two

respects. First, in this patent infringement case, Cobalt is seeking to sell an infringing generic
pharmaceutical product to compete against a product sold in the United States by plaintiff King
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("King") pursuant to a license agreement with Aventis Deutschland and
Aventis Pharmaceuticals, as well as a manufacturing agreement under which Aventis
Pharmaceuticals manufactures the finished product for King. Second, reflecting Aventis
Pharmaceuticals's substantial stake, Aventis Pharmaceuticals controls and supervises Aventis
Deutschland's conduct in this litigation and pays the legal fees of Aventis Deutschland's counsel
in this case. Cobalt, through its counsel, in fact, treated Aventis Pharmaceuticals as an adverse
party by soliciting discovery from it. Aventis Pharmaceuticals likewise controls and supervises
the conduct of Gray Cary's work in antitrust litigations and patent prosecution, and pays its legal
fees in those matters.

(3) Gray Cary has not inquired with its client, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, about that
client's evident interest in this litigation and has not asked for Aventis Pharmaceuticals's consent
to the Cobalt representation. In any event, Aventis Pharmaceuticals does not consent to Gray
Cary's proposed representation of Cobalt.

(4) - Any ethical screen implemented by Gray Cary would not resolve the conflict,
because an ethical screen cannot cure conflicts arising from concurrent representation of adverse
clients. Even if the mechanism of screening were available (which it is not), it would not
adequately address risks to the Gray Cary clients posed by the concurrent representations.

Counsel has "met and conferred" pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, but were unable to resolve

the matter.

WHEREFORE, Aventis Deutschland respectfully moves this Court for entry of an Order

disqualifying the law firm of Gray Cary, including any and all of its partners and associates, from

representing Cobalt in this action, and to revoke the pre hac vice admission of Steven A.

Maddox.
