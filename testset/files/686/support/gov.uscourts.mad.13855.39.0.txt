MEMORANDUM OF LAW OF

AVENTIS PHARMA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH
IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISQUALIFY
GRAY CARY WARE & FREIDENRICH LLP
Plaintiff Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH ("Aventis Deutschland") submits this
memorandum of law in support of its motion to disqualify the law firm of Gray Cary Ware &
Freidenrich LLP ("Gray Cary") (including any and all of its partners and associates) from
representing defendant Cobalt Pharmaceuticals, Inc, ("Cobalt") in this action. Furthermore,
Aventis Deutschland respectfully moves this Court to revoke the pro hac vice admission of
Steven A. Maddox.
I, PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This motion presents a straightforward application of the well-established ethical
principle that prohibits a law firm from concurrently representing clients who are adverse to one
another. Gray Cary has violated this principle by taking on the representation of Cobalt, which is

directly adverse to its current client Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Aventis Pharmaceuticals").

Gray Cary's disqualification is required because:

BOS-623466 v6 5544511-0901
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 39 Filed 07/24/03 Page 2 of 17

(1) Gray Cary has represented, and continues to represent, Aventis Pharmaceuticals
in ongoing litigation and patent prosecution matters.

(2) Gray Cary's representation of Cobalt in this case against the German affiliate of
its client, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, is directly adverse to Aventis Pharmaceuticals itself in two
respects. First, in this patent infringement case, Cobalt is seeking to sell an infringing generic
pharmaceutical product to compete against a product sold in the United States by plaintiff King
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("King") pursuant to a license agreement with Aventis Deutschland and
Aventis Pharmaceuticals, as well as a manufacturing agreement under which Aventis
Pharmaceuticals manufactures the finished product for King. Second, reflecting Aventis
Pharmaceuticals's substantial stake, Aventis Pharmaceuticals controls and supervises Aventis
Deutschland's conduct in this litigation and pays the legal fees of Aventis Deutschland's counsel
in this case, Cobalt, through its counsel, in fact, treated Aventis Pharmaceuticals as an adverse
party by soliciting discovery from it. Aventis Pharmaceuticals likewise controls and supervises
the conduct of Gray Cary's work in antitrust litigations and patent prosecution, and pays its legal
fees in those matters.

(3) Gray Cary has not inquired with its client, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, about that
client's evident interest in this litigation and has not asked for Aventis Pharmaceuticals's consent
to the Cobalt representation. In any event, Aventis Pharmaceuticals does not consent to Gray
Cary's proposed representation of Cobalt.

(4) Any ethical screen implemented by Gray Cary would not resolve the conflict,
because an ethical screen cannot cure conflicts arising from concurrent representation of adverse
clients. Even if the mechanism of screening were available (which it is not), it would not

adequately address risks to the Gray Cary clients posed by the concurrent representations.

Hi, STATEMENT OF FACTS

A, Aventis

Aventis S.A., a French stock company, is a global pharmaceutical corporation with
subsidiaries operating in nearly 100 countries around the world. Walter Decl. Ex. B at 4.) The
subsidiaries conduct the company's prescription drug and human vaccines business in their
respective markets. /d. The principal operating subsidiaries engaged in the prescription drug
business are in the United States, France, Germany and Japan. Id. Aventis Pharmaceuticals is
the U.S. operating subsidiary of Aventis S.A., and Aventis Deutschland is the German operating
subsidiary. fd.

As stated in Aventis's 2002 Sustainability Report, "[t]he business functions F inance,
Legal, Communications, Commercial Operations, Drug Innovation & Approval, Human
Resources, Industrial Operations and Information Solutions are organized globally." Jd. Of
particular importance to this motion to disqualify is that Aventis's departments of Global Patent
Administration and Global Patent Litigation, both located at the offices of Aventis
Pharmaceuticals in Bridgewater, New Jersey, are responsible for patent preparation, prosecution,
and litigation for Aventis entities worldwide. Dahling Decl. qT] 4-6, 12.7

The organization of legal affairs within Aventis, as related to patent matters, is highly
integrated. Specifically, the Global Patent Administration Department at Aventis
Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey provides patent-related legal services and has responsibility for
patent matters for both Aventis Pharmaceuticals and Aventis Deutschland. Dahling Decl. 0x00A7 4.

Pharmaceuticals in Bridgewater, New J ersey, heads the Global Patent Administration
Department and has direct supervisory responsibility for all patent groups within Aventis,
including Aventis Pharmaceuticals and Aventis Deutshland. id 45. The U.S. Patent
Department at Aventis Pharmaceuticals is, in fact, responsible for U.S. patent and licensing
matters for all Aventis entities worldwide. Ochler Decl. | 4.3

In addition, the Global Patent Litigation Department, also based in the offices of Aventis
Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, is responsible for world-wide patent-related litigations of
virtually all Aventis entities worldwide, including patent litigations of Aventis Deutschland -
and, specifically, this case. Dahling Decl. | 6-8. That department also reports to Mr. Dahling.
Id. Tf 7-8.

B. Gray Cary's Representation of Aventis Pharmaceuticals

On its website, Gray Cary trumpets Aventis Pharmaceuticals as one of its "representative
clients." Walter Decl. { 4, Ex. A. This claim derives from two sources. First, Gray Cary
currently represents Aventis Pharmaceuticals on several patent matters. Oehler Decl. 9 6. This
work for Aventis Pharmaceuticals includes preparing and prosecuting patent applications relating
to biotechnology before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. id.

Second, Gray Cary also represents Aventis Pharmaceuticals in nine coordinated antitrust
litigations in San Diego, California. Manardo Decl.{ 5. These antitrust claims arise from the
settlement of a patent infringement case relating to the pharmaceutical ciprofloxacin. Jd. Gray
Cary has made numerous court appearances, drafted motions, and taken depositions on behalf of

Aventis Pharmaceuticals in these cases. Id. 4 7.

OF This Action

Plaintiff Aventis Deutschland brought this patent infringement action against Cobalt on
March 14, 2003, charging that Cobalt's filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application for
approval to market a generic version of the drug Altace(R) infringes U.S. Patent No. 5,061 722
(the "722 Patent"). The `722 Patent covers the chemical compound ramipril, which is the active
ingredient in Altace(R). Aventis Deutschland is the owner of the `722 Patent and King is the
exclusive licensee. Weber Decl. {ff 5-6.0x00B0 King markets Altace(R) in the United States pursuant to
a three-way license agreement among King, Aventis Deutschland, and Aventis Pharmaceuticals.
dd. J 6-7. In addition, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement with King, Aventis
Pharmaceuticals manufactures finished Altace(R) products for King, which remits payment for
such manufacturing to Aventis Pharmaceuticals. /d. at q 7.

Initially, the law firm of McDermott, Will & Emery appeared on behalf of Cobalt. On
June 30, 2003, McDermott, Will & Emery withdrew as counsel. Steven A. Maddox and David
L. Rosen, partners at McDermott, Will & Emery who had been responsible for this litigation, left
that firm and joined Gray Cary. Gray Cary is now Cobalt's lead counsel in this case. Mr.
Maddox was admitted pro hac vice in the U.S. District Court in Boston "subject to
reconsideration if Plaintiff can show a conflict of interest." (Order dated July 7, 2003).
D. The Direct Interest and Participation of Aventis Pharmaceuticals in this Case

Aventis Pharmaceuticals has a strong interest and is heavily involved in the instant
action. It is not a formal party to this action only because it is not the holder or exclusive
licensee of the patent, and therefore does not have standing to sue in this case. While patent

holder Aventis Deutschland is a plaintiff here, its conduct in this litigation is directed and

 

0x00B0 "Weber Decl." refers to the Declaration of Tanja Stephanie Weber.
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 39 Filed 07/24/03 Page 6 of 17

supervised by Aventis Pharmaceuticals. The Global Patent Litigation Department at Aventis
Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey is directly responsible for this litigation. Dahling Decl. 0x00A7 6. The
two in-house Aventis attorneys in charge of the day-to-day conduct of the litigation are Michael
Bankmann, patent counsel at Aventis Deutschland, and Carolyn Moon, Senior Director, Global
Patent Litigation, at Aventis Pharmaceuticals in New J ersey. /d. 4/8. They report to the Vice
President of Global Patent Litigation, who in turn reports to Mr. Dahling. Id.

Just as Aventis Pharmaceuticals pays Gray Cary's legal fees in the matters referred to in
paragraph II.B. above, Aventis Pharmaceuticals pays the legal fees incurred in the prosecution of
this case, The invoices for the legal services rendered by Kaye Scholer LLP and Kirkpatrick &
Lockhart LLP in their representation of Aventis Deutschland and Aventis Pharmaceuticals in this
case are sent to Aventis Pharmaceuticals, which pays them from a Global Patent Litigation
budget that is administered by the head of the Global Patent Litigation Department at Aventis
Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, in consultation with Mr. Dahling. id. { 9.

Indeed, court papers submitted by Aventis Deutschland in this case - filed before Gray
Cary took on its representation of Cobalt - demonstrate the involvement of Aventis
Pharmaceuticals. In compliance with Local Rule 26.1(B), Mr. Dahling submitted to this Court a
Sworn Statement as "Senior Vice President Global Patents, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for
Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH." /d. { 10, Ex. A. Similarly, pursuant to Local Rule
16.1(D)(3), Mr. Dahling submitted a Certification to this Court as "Senior Vice President Global
Patents, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH." Jd. { 10, Ex. B.

The involvement of Aventis Pharmaceuticals is not limited to its control and supervision
of this litigation. It also has an interest in this lawsuit and in the drug that is the subject of the

suit. The three-way license agreement among King, Aventis Deutschland, and Aventis
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 39 Filed 07/24/03 Page 7 of 17

Pharmaceuticals grants King the right to market Altace(R) in the United States. Weber Decl. | 6.0x00B0
The same agreement treats Aventis Pharmaceuticals and Aventis Deutschland as a single entity
and grants them rights to prosecute, control, and settle this litigation, as well as the right to share
any damages awarded. Id. Moreover, pursuant to a separate manufacturing agreement between
King and Aventis Pharmaceuticals, King pays Aventis Pharmaceutials to make Altace(R)
products, the very products that are involved in this patent infringement suit. Id. 0x00A7 7.

Indeed, Cobalt itself has recognized that Aventis Pharmaceuticals is, in real terms, an
adverse party in this case. In document requests and interrogatories served before the Court
issued its initial scheduling order, Cobalt sought documents and information not only from
Aventis Deutschland but from its affiliates as well - which, of course, includes its own client,
Aventis Pharmaceuticals. Walter Decl. Exs. C at 2, Dat 2.

E. Aventis Pharmaceuticals Has Not Consented to Gray Cary's Adverse
Representation

Despite an obvious conflict of interest that should have been identified during a conflict
check upon the hiring of Mr. Maddox by Gray Cary, the firm did not contact anyone at Aventis
Pharmaceuticals to inquire about the circumstances surrounding Aventis Pharmaceuticals?
involvement in this case or to seek its consent to allow Gray Cary to represent Cobalt. Aventis
Pharmaceuticals has not given its consent and will not consent to Gray Cary's representation of

Cobalt in this matter. Manardo Decl. 0x00A7 9; Oehler Decl. { 7.

 

8 The agreement refers to Aventis Pharmaceuticals and Aventis Deutschland by their

former names, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. and Hoechst Marion Roussel Deutschland GmbH.
Weber Decl. 0x00A7 6. Should the Court so desire, this agreement, as well as the manufacturing
agreement between King and Aventis Pharmaceuticals, can be submitted to the Court subject to a
confidentiality agreement and, as the Court may determine, an appropriate protective order.

Ill, ARGUMENT

A. Gray Cary's Representation of Cobalt Is Directly Adverse to Its Current Client,
Aventis Pharmaceuticals, And, Accordingly, Gray Cary Must Be Disqualified

It is a fundamental proposition of the law of lawyering and legal ethics that a lawyer may
not simultaneously represent Client A (Aventis) in one matter and C (Cobalt) in another case of
C versus A, even when the matters are completely unrelated.' This fundamental precept is
codified in Rule 1.7(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct ("Mass. R. Prof.
c."),8 which prohibits, in the absence of each client's informed consent, concurrent
representation of clients whose interests are directly adverse to one another. Rule 1.7(a)
provides, in pertinent part, that

A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be
directly adverse to another client, unless:

a) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not
adversely affect the relationship with the other client; and

b) each client consents after consultation."

Simply put, an attorney cannot simultaneously represent client A in one matter while
representing client C who is adverse to client A in another matter without each client's consent.

States District Court, District of Massachusetts. See, Local Rule 83.6(4)(B), United States
District Court, District of Massachusetts.

0x00B0 Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7 is identical to the pre-2002 version of Rule 1.7 of the ABA Model
Rules of Professional Conduct.
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 39 Filed 07/24/03 Page 9 of 17

in Massachusetts also applies even if the two matters are unrelated. McCourt, 386 Mass. at 146
("It is also irrelevant that the lawsuits are unrelated in subject matter and that it appears that
client A will not in fact be prejudiced by the concurrent participation of the law firm in both
actions.").

This stringent standard is required because Rule 1.7 is grounded in the fundamental duty
of loyalty that a lawyer owes to a client. See International Business Machines Corp. v. Levin,
579 F.2d 271, 283 (3d Cir. 1978) ("An attorney who fails to observe his obligation of undivided
loyalty to his client injures his profession and demeans it in the eyes of the public."); McCourt,
386 Mass. at 145 ("The undivided loyalty that a lawyer owes to his clients forbids him, without
the clients" consent, from acting for client A in one action and at the same time against client A
in another"); British Airways, PLC vy. Port Authority of New York, 862 F. Supp. 889, 899
(E.D.N.Y. 1994) ("because the undivided loyalty owed to a client is of paramount importance,
disqualification [under Rule 1.7] is appropriate").

The Rules of Professional Conduct have always emphasized the critical aspect of loyalty
in the lawyer-client relationship. Comment [1] to Rule 1.7 states: "Loyalty is an essential
element in the lawyer's relationship to a client." Comment [3] to Rule 1.7 states that: "As a
general proposition, loyalty to a client prohibits undertaking representation directly adverse to
that client without that client's consent." To make the point more emphatic, Comment [3]
further states: "Thus, a lawyer ordinarily may not act as advocate against a person the lawyer
represents in some other matter, even if it is wholly unrelated." (Emphasis added). The
Comments to the ABA Rules of Professional Conduct adopted in 2002 also stress the duty of
loyalty and elaborate on the concept to an even greater extent than in earlier versions of

commentary. Comment [6] to Rule 1.7 of the new ABA Rules incorporates the statement from
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 39 Filed 07/24/03 Page 10 of 17

the earlier Model Rule comment that says: "absent consent, a lawyer may not act as an advocate
in one matter against a person the lawyer represents in some other matter, even when the matters
are wholly unrelated." The new Comment [6] now includes the additional guidance that the
"client as to whom the representation is directly adverse is likely to feel betrayed, and the
resulting damage to the client-lawyer relationship is likely to impair the lawyer's ability to
represent the client effectively."!0x00B0 Thus, the conflict of interest arising from concurrent
representation in favor of, and adverse to, the interests of a client creates an unacceptable risk to
the quality of the client-lawyer relationship with both the original and the new client and the
effectiveness of the representation of both clients.

Here, Gray Cary has breached the undivided loyalty it owes to its client Aventis
Pharmaceuticals by taking on a representation (Cobalt) that is directly adverse to Aventis
Pharmaceuticals. As pointed out earlier, in paragraph II.D. above, although not a formal party to
this action, Aventis Pharmaceuticals has a strong interest and a substantial involvement in the
case. It manufactures the product at issue for King. It isa party to the license agreement under
which the product is sold in the United States, which provides that all parties may share in any
patent infringement damages awarded. As is obvious from the sworn statements placed before
the Court, in patent litigation matters like the instant case, Aventis Pharmaceuticals is more than
just another affiliate of Aventis Deutschland in the Aventis, S.A. family. Aventis
Pharmaceuticals's relationship with Aventis Deutschland is so strong, and its interest in the case

is so substantial, that it directs and supervises this case and pays counsel's fees.
