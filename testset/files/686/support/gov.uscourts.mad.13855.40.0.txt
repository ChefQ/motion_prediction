5. As Senior Vice President Global Patents, I have direct supervisory
responsibility for all patent groups within Aventis, including the U.S. Patent Department,
German Patent and Licensing Department, French Patent Department, and Global Patent
Litigation Department. The German Patent and Licensing Department is located in the
Frankfurt offices of Aventis Deutschland.

6. The Global Patent Litigation Department, based in the offices of
Aventis Pharmaceuticals in New J ersey, reports to me through the Vice President Global
Patent Litigation, and is responsible for the above-captioned patent infringement action
that Aventis Deutschland brought against defendant Cobalt Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
("Cobalt"), as well as worldwide patent-related litigations of almost all Aventis entities,
including Aventis Deutschland and Aventis Pharmaceuticals.

7. As Senior Vice President Global Patents, I am responsible for
overseeing this action and work closely with the Global Patent Litigation Department.

8. Two in-house Aventis attorneys, Michael Bankmann and Carolyn
Moon, are involved in the day to day supervision of this action. Michael Bankmann is
patent counsel at Aventis Deutschland. Carolyn Moon is Senior Director, Global Patent
Litigation, at Aventis Pharmaceuticals. Both Michael Bankmann and Carolyn Moon
report on this action to the Vice President Global Patent Litigation and thus indirectly to
me.

9. The invoices for the legal services rendered by Kaye Scholer LLP and
Kirkpatrick & Lockhart in their representation of Aventis Deutschland and Aventis

Pharmaceuticals in this case are sent to Aventis Pharmaceuticals, who in turn pays them
Case 1:03-cv-10492-JLT Document 40 Filed 07/24/03 Page 3 of 4

from a Global Patent Litigation budget that is administered by the Global Patent
Litigation Head in consultation with me.

10. I have signed a Sworn Statement Pursuant to Local Rule 26.1(B) and a
Certification of Plaintiff Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH (attached as Exhibits A and
B, respectively) in this case as Senior Vice President Global Patents, Aventis
Pharmaceuticals on behalf of Aventis Deutschland.

11. Gray Cary currently represents Aventis Pharmaceuticals in preparing
and prosecuting patent applications before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and
conducting several patent-related antitrust litigations pending in California.

12. Ross Oehler, the Aventis attorney who is in charge of overseeing Gray
Cary's patent preparation and prosecution work, reports directly to me, and his office and
mine are located on the same floor in Bridgewater, New Jersey.

13. I have been informed that Gray Cary takes the position that since
Aventis Deutschland is the plaintiff in this action, to which Aventis Pharmaceuticals is
not a party, its representation of Cobalt is not adverse to Aventis Pharmaceuticals. I
disagree. As I stated above, Aventis Pharmaceuticals is directly involved in the
supervision of this litigation and pays the legal fees incurred. Further, I am responsible
for both the conduct of this action and the patent matters in which Gray Cary is
representing Aventis Pharmaceuticals.

14. Thus, as Senior Vice President Global Patents, I and persons who

report to me are responsible for supervising the patent-related matters in which Gray
