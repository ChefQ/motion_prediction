GRADUAL TAYLOR,

CASE NO. C-1-02-446

(Judge Weber)
(Magistrate Black)

v.

CHERYL HART,
Defendant.

DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM
OPPOSING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

The plaintiff filed a motion for a protective order. The defendant (Police Officer Cheryl
Hart) opposes the motion as discussed below.
It is not true, as asserted by the plaintiff, that this counsel advised the plaintiff, “in the
nicest possible way, that these things can be nasty.” This counsel merely described his duty, on
behalf of his client, to use discovery procedures to investigate the plaintiff’s liability and damage
claims.
The plaintiff publicly filed a lawsuit alleging that he was unlawfully arrested. Therefore,
the fact of the arrest, and the plaintiff’s challenge to it, are a matter of public record available for
review by anyone. Furthermore, under R.C. 2953(D)(2) Officer Hart is allowed access to
necessary records that she needs to defend herself. Given the public nature of the lawsuit, and
Officer Hart's access to records under R.C. 2953(D)(2), the plaintiff's motion for a protective
order should be denied. In any event, however, Officer Hart has no need or desire to
unnecessarily ostracize the plaintiff and will work with the plaintiff and the Court to protect the
plaintiff without unduly prejudicing her ability to defend the claims against her.
