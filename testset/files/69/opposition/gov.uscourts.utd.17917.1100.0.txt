Defendant/Counterclaim- Plaintiff International Business Machines Corporation

("IBM") respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the request of The SCO Group,

Inc. ("SCO") (n/k/a TSG Group, Inc.) to reopen this case to pursue several of its claims against
IBM while IBM's counterclaims against SCO remain stayed, despite the fact that IBM's
counterclaims are inextricably intertwined with SCO's claims and litigating them separately (as
SCO proposes) would be inefficient and fundamentally unfair and would ignore the preclusive

effect ofthe final judgment (the "Novell Judgment") entered against SCO in its litigation with
Novell (the "Novell Litigation").

Preliminary Statement
1. SCO commenced this litigation in 2003 as par of a campaign to control

the Linux operating system, which was developed publicly by thousands of software developers,

including developers at IBM. In response, IBM asserted a number of counterclaims against SCO
for violating IBM's contractual, intellectual property and other rights.
2. After years of litigation, the parties exchanged multiple summary

judgment motions, and Judge Kimball heard several days of oral argument. But before the Cour
could decide the motions, SCO filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankuptcy
Code, resulting directly in an automatic stay and ultimately in closure of this case.
3. Meanwhile, in a related litigation between SCO and Novell, the Novell

Litigation, a jury returned a verdict, and now Chief Judge Stewart entered a final judgment,
against SCO and in favor of

NovelL. The Novell Judgment, which effectively forecloses SCO's

claims in this case (as well as requiring a judgment in IBM's favor on several of its
counterclaims), was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit on August 30, 2011.

Case 2:03-cv-00294-CW Document 1100

Filed 11/21/11 Page 3 of 17

4. Taking the view that not all of its claims are foreclosed by the Novell

Judgment, SCO now asks the Court to reopen this case and to decide the summary judgment

motions relating only to "SCO's unfair competition claim concerning the Project Monterey joint

venture" (to which SCO was not even a party) and "SCO's tortious interference claims alleging
that IBM interfered with SCO's market and business relationships".
5. While we expect the Court wil eventually have to reopen this case, it is

premature to do so now, because IBM's eleven counterclaims against SCO (which are closely
related to SCO's claims against IBM) remain stayed, and it makes no sense to litigate this case

piecemeal. Doing so would waste judicial and party resources and potentially result in
inconsistent rulings.

6. Nor does it make sense at this juncture for the Court to dive into the
summary judgment motions IBM fied (more than four years ago) against SCO's unfair
competition and tortious interference claims. While those claims have no merit (for the reasons
described in IBM's motions), they are also, contrary to SCO's contention, effectively foreclosed

by the Novell Judgment, which also affects IBM's counterclaims against SCO.
7. Rather, we respectfully request that the Cour enter an order (i) providing

that this case shall be reopened within 5 days of

the fiing of a notice (by any party) that the stay

concerning IBM's counterclaims has been lifted; (ii) stating that the claims that SCO concedes

are foreclosed by the Novell Judgment wil be dismissed when the case is reopened; (iii)
directing that, within 45 days of the reopening of the case, any party may make a motion for
summary judgment addressing the impact of

the Novell Judgment on all remaining claims

(including the IBM counterclaims resolved by the Novell Judgment); and (iv) ordering the

parties jointly to submit, within 10 days of the entry of an order of the Court determining the
impact of

the Novell Judgment, a proposed scheduling order to govern the balance of

the case.

8. Proceeding in this way wil minimize the risks of piecemeal litigation,

prevent the Court's deciding motions concerning foreclosed claims, and put the paries and the
Court in a position to bring this case to a conclusion in the most efficient manner possible. Thus,
SCO's motion to reopen should be denied without prejudice.

Background
9. In early 2003, SCO attempted to profit from the UNIX and Linux

operating systems by, among other things, embarking on a far-reaching publicity campaign to
create the false and unsubstantiated

impression that SCO had expansive rights to the UNIX and

Linux operating systems and by bringing baseless legal claims against IBM and others.
10. SCO asserted nine claims against IBM: (l) four breach of contract claims

(Counts I to IV); (2) one copyright infringement claim (Count V); (3) one unfair competition
claim (as to a joint venture to which SCO was not a party) (Count VI); and (4) three tortious

interference claims (Counts VII to IX). The crux ofSCO's case was that it owned the copyrights
and other rights to the UNIX operating system and that IBM and others violated SCO's alleged

rights and injured SCO by contributing to the development of the Linux operating system.
11. Based on the conduct underlying SCO's attack on Linux and IBM, IBM

asserted a number of counterclaims against SCO: (l) two claims for declaration of noninfringement of copyright (Counterclaims IX and X); (2) one claim for breach of contract

(Counterclaim I); (3) three claims relating to SCO's copying ofIBM code in Linux
(Counterclaims VI to VIII); (4) four claims concerning SCO's campaign to create fear,

uncertainty and doubt about IBM's products and services (Counterclaims II to V); and (5) one

12. Both Judge Kimball (to whom this case was initially assigned) and

Magistrate Judge Wells entered a series of orders callng SCO's claims into question and
materiaily limiting SCO's case. SCO challenged these rulings in motions/objections that are
the November 29,2006 Order (Doc. #

fully briefed: (1) SCO's Motion for Reconsideration of

894); (2) SCO's Objections to the Magistrate Judge's Order on IBM's Motion to Confine (Doc. #

judgment

13. Thereafter, IBM tiled six sumary judgment motions, seeking

in its favor on all of SCO' s claims and two of its own. SCO filed three summary judgment
motions, seeking judgment on seven of IBM's claims and one of its own.
14. On August 10,2007, before ruling on these motions, Judge Kimball

entered an order in the Novell Litigation, rejecting the keystone of SCO's litigation campaign.

Judge Kimball ruled that Novell, not SCO, owns the core UNIX copyrights and that Novell has

the right, which it has exercised on IBM's behalf, to waive most of SCO's purported claims
against IBM.
15. Recognizing that that ruling "significantly impacts" this case, Judge

his Novell ruling on this case.

Kimball required the parties to state their views as to the effect of

Case 2:03-cv-00294-CW Document 1100

Filed 11/21/11 Page 6 of 17

IBM believed the Novell ruling effectively rejected all of SCO's claims and effectively granted

several of IBM's counterclaims. SCO took a narrower view of the ruling but did not dispute that
it foreclosed no fewer than six of SCO's nine claims against IBM.
16. Shortly after the parties responded to the Court concerning the effect of

the Novell ruling on this case, but before Judge Kimball ruled on the pending motions, SCO fied

a petition for relief under the Bankuptcy Code in Delaware, where SCO is incorporated. The
instant case was then closed (administratively) pending resolution ofSCO's bankptcy case,

which gave rise to an automatic stay.
17. On August 24,2009, the Tenth Circuit reversed in part Judge Kimball's

summary judgment ruling in the Novell Litigation and remanded the case for triaL. The Tenth

Circuit ruled that there were questions of fact as to whether Novell or SCO owned the UNIX

copyrights and whether Novell could waive SCO's claims against IBM.
from both the Novell

18. Upon remand, Judge Kimball recused himself

Litigation and this case. This case was reassigned to Judge Campell, and the Novell Litigation
was reassigned to Judge Stewart.
19. On March 30, 2010, a

jury retured a verdict against SCO in the Novell

Litigation, finding that Novell owns the core UNIX copyrights, which lie at the hear of SCO's
fact and conclusions of

case against IBM. On June 10,2010, Judge Stewart issued findings of

law refusing SCO's reqúest for specific performance and holding that Novell had the authority to

judgment

waive SCO's claims against IBM. On the same day, Judge Stewart issued a final

embodying the jury verdict and his findings of fact and conclusions of law.
20. Shortly after SCO fied an appeal, but before the Tenth Circuit ruled on

the appeal, SCO requested that this Cour permit it to proceed as to several of its claims against
IBM (i.e., SCO's unfair competition and tortious inference claims) while IBM's counterclaims
against SCO remained stayed. In an order dated September 10,2010, Judge Campell declined to

take that piecemeal approach.

21. While Judge Campell stated that either party could move to reopen this
case after the Tenth Circuit issued its decision in the Novell Litigation, she expressed no view as
to whether it would make sense to reopen the case while IBM's counterclaims remained stayed.
22. SCO seeks to reopen this case and to proceed piecemeal, while IBM's

counterclaims remain stayed. In fact, despite the fact that it has been more than four years since

SCO fied a petition for relief under the bankuptcy laws, it has not confirmed a plan of
relief

reorganization or sought

23. While the Tenth Circuit's affrmance of

case closèr to the point where it should be reopened, it makes no sense to proceed with the case
before the stay of

IBM's counterclaims is lifted. Nor does it make any sense for the Court to

dive into the summary judgment motions IBM fied against SCO's unfair competition and
tortious interference claims. However, as soon as the stay is lifted as to IBM's counterclaims,

the Cour should (i) dismiss the claims that SCO concedes are foreclosed, (ii) determine the
effect of

the Novell Judgment

on the remaining claims and counterclaims, and (iii) enter a

scheduling order to bring this matter to an expeditious resolution.

24. The Court should not reopen this case to proceed piecemeal; it should
reopen the case when the stay has been lifted as to IBM's counterclaims. In seeking to

Filed 11/21/11 Page 8 of 17

reopen this case now, SCO scarcely makes mention ofIBM's counterclaims. But, as stated, IBM
non-infringement of

has eleven counterclaims against SCO: (1) two claims for declaration of

copyright (Counterclaims ix and X); (2) one claim for breach of contract (Counterclaim i); (3)

three claims relating to SCO's copying ofIBM code in Linux (Counterclaims Vi to VIIi); (4)
four claims concerning SCO's campaign to create fear, uncertainty and doubt about IBM's

products and services (Counterclaims II to V); and (5) one claim for a declaration ofIBM's
rights under all of its other claims (Counterclaim XiV).

25. IBM's counterclaims are closely related to SCO's claims, including its
unfair competition claim (Count VI) and its tortious interference claims (Count VII-IX).! IBM's
is alleged by SCO to

counterclaims accuse SCO of (i) breaching the same UNIX contracts IBM

have breached (Counterclaim I); (ii) infringing IBM copyrights and violating the General Public

License with respect to the same Linux operating system that SCO claims IBM improperly
supported (Counterclaims VI, VII, VIII); (iii) orchestrating a campaign of fear, uncertainty and

doubt about IBM's products and services - the very course of conduct with which it claims
IBM interfered (Counterclaims II, III, iv, and V); (iv) falsely asserting claims of copyright
! SCO's tortious interference claims accuse IBM of (i) inducing Novell to assert
copyright and waiver rights that SCO argues Novell does not have under the APA (Count VIII)
(though SCO seems to recognize this claim is bared by the Novell Judgment); (ii) interfering
with SCO's business relationships with 175 companies (besides Novell) by urging them to use
Linux (instead ofSCO's UNIX products) while knowing that such use would violate their UNIX
licenses (Count VII); and (iii) interfering with SCO's business relationships with six other
entities by urging them not to do business with SCO because ofSCO's efforts to protect the
UNIX code allegedly misappropriated by Linux (Count IX). SCO's unfair competition claim
(Count VI) purorts to be a catch-all count, accusing IBM of a variety of alleged misconduct,
such as breaches of contracts, misappropriation of source code, and infringement of copyrights,
including with respect to certain UNIX SVr4 code (licensed to IBM by The Santa Cruz

infringement with respect to the same copyrights referenced by SCO in its claims (Counterclaim

ix and X); and (v) interfering with IBM's relationships with the same customer base that SCO
accuses IBM of interfering with (Counterclaim IV).
26. Given the connection between SCO's claims and IBM's counterclaims,

proceeding with SCO's claims alone has nothing to recommend it. IfSCO's claims are to be
litigated, they should be litigated with IBM's counterclaims, as they were for years prior to

SCO's bankuptcy fiing. SCO's claims and IBM's counterclaims concern the same course of
conduct and intellectual property. Litigating them separately, and potentially conducting two
separate trials, would make no sense.
27. Thus, we respectfully submit that the Court should enter an order

providing that this case shall be reopened within 5 days ofthe fiing of a notice (by any party)
that the stay has been fully lifted concerning IBM's counterclaims (except as to the enforcement

of any money judgment that IBM obtains against SCO). IBM does not object to lifting the stay,
and, as the debtor, SCO should be able to obtain an order lifting it in short order.
28. After the stay has been lifted and this case has been reopened, the

Court should first dismiss the claims that SCO concedes are foreclosed. SCO admits that at
least five (and perhaps six) of its claims against IBM, and part of another of its claims, are

foreclosed by the Novell Judgment. Specifically, SCO clearly concedes that its four claims for
breach of contract (Counts I-IV) and its copyright claim (Count V) are barred by the Novell
Judgment; it also acknowledges that the branches of its unfair competition claim unrelated to

Project Monterey are barred. The Tenth Circuit affrmed the final judgment entered by Judge
Stewart providing that Novell (not SCO) owns the copyrights SCO claimed to have been

8

Filed 11/21/11 Page 10 of 17

infringed and that Novell was authorized to waive SCO's claims against IBM for alleged

breaches of contract. Thus, these claims should be dismissed as soon as the case is reopened.
The Court need not decide IBM's summary judgment motions to resolve these claims.

29. While SCO's motion to reopen is not entirely clear on the subject, we
expect SCO wil also concede that, when the case is reopened, judgment should be entered in
favor ofIBM with respect to SCO's claim (Count VIII) that IBM induced Novell to assert
copyright and waiver rights that SCO argues Novell does not have under the Asset Purchase

Agreement between SCO and Novell (the "APA"). Again, in affrming the Novell Judgment, the
Tenth Circuit ruled that Novell owned the copyrights and properly exercised the waiver rights in
question. Under these circumstances, SCO's tortious interference claim concerning Novell is

Decision and

untenable, as SCO acknowledged in its response to Judge Kimball's Notice of

Request for Status Update dated August 10,2007.
30. Once the Court has dismissed the claims that SCO concedes are

foreclosed, we suggest it should determine the impact of the Novell Judgment on the
parties' remaining claims and counterclaims. While SCO concedes that the Novell Judgment

forecloses its four contract claims (Counts I-IV) and its copyright claim (Count V), SCO claims

that the Novell Judgment does not bar "SCO's unfair competition claim concerning the Project

Monterey joint venture" (to which SCO was not a party) (Count VI) and "SCO's tortious
interference claims alleging that IBM interfered with SCO's market and business relationships"

(Counts VII and IX). SCO is wrong.
31. "SCO' s tortious interference claims alleging that IBM interfered with

SCO's market and business relationships" (Counts VII and IX) depend on the proposition that

9
((NYLIT:2587870v3:4132W: 1112111 1--06:38 pll

Case 2:03-cv-00294-CW Document 1100

Filed 11/21/11 Page 11 of 17

IBM acted improperly in contributing its own source code to Linux. Specifically, Count VII
alleges IBM interfered with SCO's business relationships with "its market" (175 companies

besides Novell) by urging them to use Linux (instead of SCO's UNiX products) while knowing

that such use would violate SCO's UNiX licenses. Count iX alleges that IBM interfered with
SCO's business relationships with six other entities by urging them not to do business with SCO

because of SCO's efforts to protect the UNiX code allegedly misappropriated by Linux.
However, the Novell Judgment precludes SCO from challenging IBM's contributions of

its own

code to Linux: the Novell Judgment expressly affrms Judge Stewart's judgment that Novell

properly waived any such claim and that Novell, not SCO, owns the copyrights in (and thus has
the right to reproduce and distribute) the allegedly misused code.
32. SCO's unfair competition claim (Count Vi), which is a mix of SCO's

other causes of action, is likewise foreclosed. Insofar as the claim concerns the alleged
misconduct underlying SCO's breach of contract and copyright infringement claims, it is plainly

foreclosed by the Novell Judgment, as SCO seems to concede, because Novell waived the

alleged breaches and owns the relevant copyrights. The only branch of its unfair competition

claim that SCO appears to seek to assert relates to "Project Monterey". But the crux ofSCO's
Monterey allegations is that IBM exceeded the scope of its license to certain UNIX SVr4 code
(licensed to IBM by The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., not SCO, during Project Monterey) by

copying the code into IBM's AIX for POWER product. SCO has never properly identified any
such code that is not covered by copyrights determined in the Novell Litigation to be owned by

Novell. Nor did SCO make the disclosures required by IBM's discovery requests and the
Court's orders with respect to the "Project Monterey" code on which it would seek to base its

10

claim. Thus, SCO's Monterey allegations are untenable following the Novell Judgment.2
(SCO's Monterey allegations are also untenable for the reasons discussed in paragraph 38
below.)

33. IBM thus proposes to make a motion for summary judgment, within 45
days of

the reopening of

the Novell Judgment on all remaining

the case, addressing the impact of

we are correct about the impact of

claims (including IBM's counterclaims). If

the Novell

Judgment, it wil be unnecessary for the Cour to decide a number ofthe pending summary
judgment motions to resolve these claims.
34. Once the Court has determined the effect of the Novell Judgment, we

propose it require the parties to submit a scheduling order to govern the balance of this
proceeding. If the Court were to deny the summary judgment motion that IBM proposes to
the Novell Judgment on SCO's tortious interference and unfair

make concerning the impact of

competition claims, then it would be necessary for the Court to wade into the pending sumary

judgment motions concerning those claims. But before doing so, it wil

(depending in part of

the nature ofthe Cour's ruling as to the scope ofthe Novell Judgment) for

the parties to supplement the existing briefing, and the Court may want to hear additional

argument. Not only does the Novell Judgment affect these claims in important respects, but also
2 In addition to disposing ofthe only claims that SCO seeks to pursue, the Novell

Judgment had a significant impact on IBM's counterclaims. For example, the Tenth Circuit's
judgment in favor ofIBM on its
the Novell Judgment (1) requires the entry of
affirmance of
Counterclaims IX and X, which seek declarations of non-infringement, as SCO canot show

IBM infringed copyrights SCO does not own; (2) requires the entry of summary judgment in
favor of IBM on its Counterclaim I, insofar as it rejects the premise on which SCO purported to
terminate an IBM license; and (3) precludes SCO's primar defenses as to IBM's three claims
relating to SCO's copying ofIBM code in Linux (Counterclaim VI, VII and VIII).

the Court were to grant IBM's proposed summary judgment

35. Even if

motion (as to the impact of

the Novell Judgment) in its entirety, it wil make sense for the parties

to submit a proposed scheduling order based upon that decision. While the Novell Judgment had
a significant impact of the claims and counterclaims in this case, it did not resolve all of IBM's

counterclaims. For example, while the Novell Judgment strengthens IBM's counterclaims
concerning SCO's campaign to create fear, uncertainty and doubt about IBM's products and
services, it does not completely resolve all of

those claims. Thus, the Court wil need to address

certain of the pending motions, which may also require supplemental briefing and argument. 3
36. Finally, lest there be any doubt about it, IBM disputes SCO's

allegations of misconduct. IBM does not believe the present motion is the place to argue the
alleged merits of SCO's claims. That has been done extensively in the pending motions for
summary judgment, and this is a procedural motion. But insofar as SCO's motion to reopen
seeks to sell its claims, we wish at least to make one thing crystal clear: not only are SCO's
claims barred by the Novell Judgment, but they are also without merit for multiple reasons
independent of

the Novell Judgment. As explained at length in IBM's pending motions for

summary judgment, IBM did nothing to injure SCO; rather, it is SCO that undertook - with

much fanfare - a multi-year campaign to profit off of the thousands of persons and entities,
3 Depending on what remains in the case following the Court's ruling concerning the
impact of
the Novell Judgment, and the pending summary judgment motions, the Court may also
need to decide the motions/objections referenced in paragraph 12 above, in the event SCO elects

to pursue them.

including IBM, who have contributed to the development of Linux.
37. In touting its tortious interference claims, SCO neglects to mention that,

while it has identified numerous relationships with which IBM purportedly interfered, SCO
alleges nothing more than "indirect interference" as to the overwhelming majority of

of 182); SCO accuses IBM of

them (175

"direct interference" with only seven entities. However, SCO's

allegations of "indirect interference" are untenable as a matter of law, and each of the entities
with whom IBM allegedly "directly interfered" has testified that no such interference occurred
or, in any event, that they did not change their relationships with SCO as a result of any IBM

conduct. Moreover, (i) IBM's allegedly tortious acts were not undertaken with an improper
link between any act of IBM and any

purpose or by improper means, and (ii) there is no causal

specitic injury to SCO. These flaws in SCO's claims are described in detail in IBM's summary
judgment motion, the transcript of

the oral argument on that motion and the demonstrative

exhibits submitted at oral argument.
38. Similarly, in touting its unfair competition claim, SCO accuses IBM of

abandoning Project Monterey (a venture between IBM and The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., not

SCO), only to misappropriate source code to which IBM was given access during the project. In

fact, IBM did not abandon Project Monterey; Santa Cruz did. Rather than meet its obligations on
the project, Santa Cruz sold the very Unix assets involved in the project to a Linux company

called Caldera Systems, which later changed its name to The SCO Group, Inc. It was only then
that IBM exercised its undisputed right to terminate the project, which had simply not progressed

as originally hoped. Nor did IBM misappropriate any source code in connection with Project
Monterey; it simply used the code to which it was given access and which it had a contractual

Filed 11/21/11 Page 15 of 17

its claim is any mention of

the fact that (i) SCO

was not a pary to the joint development agreement relating to Project Monterey (the "JDA") and

thus does not have the right to seek redress of rights relating to that contract; (ii) even if SCO
could pursue a claim relating to the JDA, the JDA contains a two-year limitations provision,

under which SCO's unfair competition claim would be untimely; (iii) the crux of SCO's

claim - that IBM used Project Monterey as a pretext to misappropriate source code - is preempted by federal copyright law; (iv) the conduct about which SCO complains does not
constitute unfair competition under well-established law; and (v) SCO cannot show that alleged

unfair competition resulted in damages to SCO, which would in any case be limited to $5 milion
under the terms of

the JDA. These flaws in SCO's claims are further described in detail in

IBM's summary judgment motion, the transcript of the oral argument on that motion and the
demonstrative exhibits submitted at oral argument.
39. In summary, IBM supports the expeditious resolution ofthis case. But the
best way to bring that about is not to proceed piecemeal as to three of SCO' s claims, especially

where, as here, those claims are intimately related to IBM's counterclaims, which remain stayed

due to SCO's banuptcy fiing, and are barred by the Novell Judgment. We respectfully submit
that the most sensible way to proceed here is for the Court to enter an order (i) providing that this

case shall be reopened within 5 days of the fiing of a notice (by any party) that the stay of IBM's
counterclaims has been lifted, which SCO should be able to accomplish expeditiously; (ii) stating

that the claims that SCO concedes are foreclosed by the Novell Judgment wil be dismissed
