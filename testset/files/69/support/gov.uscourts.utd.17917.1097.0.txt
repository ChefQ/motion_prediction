Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant, The SCO Group, Inc. (“SCO”), respectfully submits
this Motion to Reopen the Case in order to proceed with SCO’s unfair competition claim
concerning the Project Monterey joint venture (the “Project Monterey Claim”) and with SCO’s
tortious interference claims alleging that IBM interfered with SCO’s market and business
relationships (the “Tortious Inference Claims”). The Project Monterey Claim and the Tortious
Interference Claims are unaffected by the final judgment entered in SCO v. Novell, Civil No.
2:04CV139 (the “Novell Litigation”), which the Tenth Circuit has now affirmed. This Court
need not await the resolution of that litigation, because it has ended.
BACKGROUND
In March 2010, District Judge Ted Stewart presided over a trial in the Novell Litigation
to resolve two issues relevant to this case: (1) whether SCO owns the copyrights to versions of
the UNIX operating system in existence when Novell sold the UNIX operating system and
business to SCO in 1995, and (2) whether as part of the same 1995 transaction Novell retained
rights to waive SCO’s claims against IBM that are based on IBM’s breach of its licensing
agreements, executed in the 1980s, pursuant to which IBM licensed pre-1996 versions of UNIX.
On March 30, 2010, the jury returned a verdict finding that Novell had not transferred to
SCO the copyrights to the versions of UNIX that existed at the time of the sale in 1995. On June
10, 2010, Judge Stewart issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, finding that Novell had
the right to waive SCO’s claims against IBM that are based on IBM’s breach of its licensing
agreements pursuant to which it licensed pre-1996 versions of UNIX.

iii

Judge Stewart issued a Final Judgment embodying the jury verdict and his findings of
fact and conclusions of law (the “Novell Final Judgment”). On July 7, 2010, SCO appealed the
Novell Final Judgment to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
While SCO’s appeal of the Novell Final Judgment was pending, SCO filed a Motion for a
Status Conference in the instant case, in order to “apprise the Court of the [Novell] Final
Judgment” and “request a status conference for the Court to consider the appropriate time and
manner to proceed with un-stayed claims in the instant action that are not affected by the Novell
Litigation.” (Docket No. 1089 at 1.)
On August 10, 2010, IBM opposed SCO’s Motion for a Status Conference on the
grounds that “SCO’s claims depend on the outcome of SCO’s appeal in the Novell Litigation”
and “should not be litigated in the absence of IBM’s counterclaims.” (Docket No. 1091 at 1.)
IBM did not dispute the fact that its counterclaims in this case are stayed by the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101.
On September 10, 2010, while SCO’s appeal of the Novell Final Judgment was pending,
this Court denied SCO’s Motion for a Status Conference, finding that “the claims in the Novell
litigation are inextricably intertwined with the claims in the IBM litigation.” (Docket No. 1093
at 1.) The Court also stated: “When the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued its decision
in the Novell litigation (No. 10-4122), either party may move the court to re-open the case. Until
then, the matter will remain administratively closed.” (Id. at 1-2.)
On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the Novell Final Judgment. On
September 22, 2011, the Tenth Circuit issued the mandate for the Novell Litigation, bringing

closure to that case. Consistent with the Court’s order, SCO now moves the Court to reopen this
case.

ARGUMENT
SCO respectfully moves the Court to reopen this case in order to proceed with SCO’s
unfair competition claim concerning the Project Monterey joint venture and with SCO’s tortious
interference claims alleging that IBM interfered with SCO’s market position and business
relationships.
SCO and IBM formed Project Monterey in late 1998 – three years after the 1995 Novellto-SCO transaction at issue in the Novell Litigation. IBM’s tortious interference also started
years after that transaction.
The Project Monterey Claim and the Tortious Interference Claims do not depend on
SCO’s ownership of the copyrights to the versions of UNIX that existed in 1995 and are not
subject to Novell’s right to waive SCO’s contract claims against IBM. SCO recognizes that its
other claims in this case are foreclosed by the Novell Final Judgment.
SCO respectfully requests that the Court rule on IBM’s Motion for Summary Judgment
on SCO’s Unfair Competition Claim (SCO’s Sixth Cause of Action), dated September 25, 2006
(Docket No. 782), which motion is directed at the Project Monterey Claim, and IBM’s Motion
for Summary Judgment on SCO’s Interference Claims (SCO’s Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Causes
of Action), dated September 25, 2006 (Docket No. 783), which motion is directed at the Tortious
Interference Claims.
Although SCO’s oppositions to those two summary judgment motions set forth the
grounds for the Project Monterey Claim and the Tortious Interference Claims in detail, including
numerous IBM internal emails chronicling IBM’s wrongful conduct, SCO is prepared to provide

1

Case 2:03-cv-00294-TC Document 1097

Filed 11/04/11 Page 7 of 17

such additional briefing or oral argument as the Court may find helpful, especially in light of the
Novell Final Judgment.
A.

Scope of the Novell Final Judgment.

The Novell Final Judgment drew a bright line with respect to the ownership of UNIX
copyrights as between Novell and SCO, as delineated in the 1995 Asset Purchase Agreement
between those parties. The Novell Final Judgment adopted Novell’s theory that Novell retained
the copyrights to UNIX technologies that existed, and that Novell sold to SCO, in 1995. Novell
never disputed that SCO owns the copyrights to the UNIX technologies SCO developed after the
1995 sale. In fact, Novell insisted that SCO owns those copyrights. In addition, Novell did not
dispute the fact that it sold and transferred to SCO the source code for all versions of UNIX that
existed in 1995, including the versions whose copyrights Novell owns under the Novell Final
Judgment.
Similarly, the Novell Final Judgment adopted Novell’s theory that it had retained waiver
rights over claims that are based on breach of certain agreements pursuant to which IBM and
other licensees licensed pre-1996 versions of UNIX. Novell’s waiver rights thus pertain to
SCO’s efforts to declare IBM in breach of such licensing agreements (executed in 1985 and
1986).
The Novell Final Judgment thus mooted claims in this case insofar as they were based on
SCO’s ownership of copyrights to pre-1996 versions of UNIX or were based on IBM’s breach of
the licensing agreements pursuant to which IBM licensed pre-1996 versions of UNIX. The
Project Monterey Claim and the Tortious Interference Claims are not such claims.

The Project Monterey Claim.

In its unfair competition claim, SCO alleges that IBM misappropriated SCO’s valuable
UNIX technologies in connection with a joint venture between the parties known as Project
Monterey.
In October 1998, IBM and SCO formed Project Monterey in order to develop a UNIXbased computer operating system that would capitalize on the emergence of Intel computer
processors (or “chips”) as a cost-effective alternative to RISC processors. At that time, Intel was
developing its next-generation processor, a 64-bit processor known as Itanium or IA-64. IBM
and SCO decided jointly to develop an operating system for the IA-64 platform (the “Project
Monterey Operating System”), with the ultimate goal of transitioning their respective UNIX
customers to the new processor on the Project Monterey Operating System. This venture was
Project Monterey.
In 1998, IBM had almost no presence in the market for UNIX operating systems on Intel
chips. Instead, IBM had focused its efforts on its UNIX-based operating system named AIX 5L,
which ran on IBM’s proprietary RISC-type processor named Power (“AIX for Power”). In
contrast, SCO not only was the worldwide UNIX market leader in units sold, but was also, as
IBM recognized in 1998, the “clear leader in the UNIX on Intel market” with “over 80% of the
$3B UNIX-Intel market.” IBM recognized the critical need to have its own Intel offering.
In order for IBM to transition its AIX for Power customers to the Project Monterey
Operating System, the parties agreed that IBM would earn a license to use SCO’s UNIX
technologies in AIX for Power, as these technologies would facilitate the transition. The parties
also agreed that IBM would obtain this license only after making a generally available (“GA”)

Filed 11/04/11 Page 9 of 17

release – that is, a general commercial release, as opposed to a beta release – of the Project
Monterey Operating System. SCO agreed to provide this license to IBM, contingent on the
commercial release of the Project Monterey Operating System, because SCO was to be
compensated through revenue it would receive from the sales of the Project Monterey Operating
System and related products.
Despite its partnership with SCO, IBM subsequently decided that Linux – an upstart
open-source operating system that was trying to compete with SCO’s existing UNIX products
(UnixWare and OpenServer) and that would compete with the Project Monterey Operating
System once it was completed – offered IBM a more profitable entryway into the UNIX-on-Intel
market. While IBM secretly abandoned Project Monterey in favor of its new Linux Strategy,
IBM decided that it could not openly withdraw from Project Monterey, for fear of raising legal
issues and forfeiting the opportunity to obtain the right to use the UNIX technologies that SCO
was bringing to the Project, including technologies that SCO had recently developed precisely
for the upcoming IA-64 processors. As one IBM executive explained, “SCO has the rights to all
the code if we cancel the project. We will need to re-negotiate the rights to ship SVr4 and UW7
capabilities [the UNIX technologies] in the AIX base, or remove the code.”
Accordingly, while outwardly pretending to remain committed to Project Monterey, IBM
in fact was surreptitiously working behind the scenes to undermine the joint venture to the
benefit of its competing products, Linux and AIX for Power. IBM’s pattern of deception
unfairly deprived SCO of the opportunity to find other partners, upgrade its UNIX products to
compete with Linux, and avoid wasting resources on a specious and unproductive “joint”
venture.

In addition, IBM directly misappropriated the UNIX technologies that SCO contributed
to Project Monterey, by making a sham GA release of the Project Monterey Operating System.
IBM’s fictional GA release of the Project Monterey Operating System was of a non-functional
product that lacked even a compiler – a feature indisputably essential to the operation of an
operating system. IBM’s own witnesses in this case admitted that an operating system without a
compiler cannot legitimately even be called an operating system. Among other IBM efforts to
cover up the sham and justify its misappropriation, IBM concocted a price for the “released”
Project Monterey product, and even went so far as to send SCO a single check of $256 for the
revenues from the purportedly commercial release of the Project Monterey Operating System.
IBM’s own internal communications chronicle the deception that IBM perpetrated upon
SCO and the public in order to obtain and profit from the UNIX technologies that SCO had
contributed to Project Monterey. For example:
•

A few weeks before the release, an IBM executive noted that IBM needed “to GA”
the sham release in order “to gain rights to SCO code we want for our based AIX
product delivery.” She added: “I know the fine lines we are walking here.”

•

In response to information that IBM was going to release the Project Monterey
Operating System without a compiler, an IBM executive noted that “the compiler
MUST be available in some form or the whole thing just doesn’t make sense (ie SCO
won’t buy it).”

•

A few weeks after the sham release, IBM warned its employees that the “net internal
position” at IBM was that the Project Monterey Operating System “is dead,” while
the “external position” was that the Project Monterey Operating System “remains
available for evaluation use as may be appropriate.”

•

A few months after the purported GA release, IBM admitted that the release was a
sham, noting that “Monterey has not gone GA and never will.”

At oral argument on IBM’s pending motion for summary judgment, counsel for SCO
walked Judge Kimball through these and other IBM documents revealing the depth and extent of
5

Case 2:03-cv-00294-TC Document 1097

Filed 11/04/11 Page 11 of 17

IBM’s deception. (Argument Tr. (Ex. A) at 28:18-34:3.) Immediately following SCO’s
argument, Judge Kimball asked IBM counsel: “What do you say about these documents here?”
IBM counsel first responded: “If I may be clear about the documents, Your Honor, if I may
approach – I could not see them, frankly, from over there.” (Id. at 46:8-46:14.) After peering at
the blow-ups of the documents in the courtroom, IBM counsel responded: “Your Honor, what I
say about the documents is the following,” and then proceeded to discuss only “the nature of the
license IBM obtained pursuant to the JDA,” without addressing any of the obvious admissions
made in the documents. (Id. at 46:15-47:23.)
It remains undisputed, moreover, that IBM incorporated the misappropriated UNIX
technologies into its AIX for Power operating system in competition with SCO starting in May
2001, and that IBM continued to sell AIX for Power with these valuable technologies at least
through the time Judge Kimball heard the foregoing oral argument, in March 2007. As IBM
executives admitted, the Project Monterey Operating System was never released as a generally
available or commercial product – and never would be.
C.

Status of the Project Monterey Claim.

The Project Monterey Claim does not depend on SCO’s ownership of the copyrights to
the versions of UNIX that existed in 1995 and is not subject to Novell’s rights to waive SCO’s
contract claims against IBM.
SCO submitted uncontroverted proof that IBM incorporated into AIX for Power valuable
UNIX technologies that SCO developed after 1995 and whose copyrights indisputably belong to
SCO – technologies that were critical for IBM to remain competitive. In his expert report, under

6

Case 2:03-cv-00294-TC Document 1097

Filed 11/04/11 Page 12 of 17

the heading “Source Code IBM Copied from UNIX System V into AIX for Power,” SCO expert
Marc Rochkind concluded:
Many lines of code were copied from SCO’s Gemini64 UNIX
System V into AIX, as diagrammed in [Tab-210] through [Tab218]. These diagrams show over 440,000 lines of code that match
exactly. In addition, many AIX files in those diagrams retain their
SCO copyright notice. This evidence supports my opinion that
there is absolute proof that a substantial amount of code was
copied into AIX from Gemini64.
Gemini64 was a technology that SCO developed after 1995, precisely for the Intel 64-bit
processors that did not even exist until after that year.
In addition, IBM misappropriated UNIX source code into its AIX for Power operating
system. While Novell owns the copyrights to the UNIX source code that existed in 1995, SCO
indisputably owns the UNIX source code itself, even after the Novell Final Judgment.
The Project Monterey Claim therefore is ripe for adjudication.
D.

The Tortious Interference Claims.

The Tortious Interference Claims allege that IBM interfered with SCO’s position as the
leader in the UNIX-on-Intel market by wrongfully disclosing confidential UNIX technologies to
Linux, in order to transform Linux from an upstart operating system for hobbyists to a
commercial-grade alternative to SCO’s UnixWare and OpenServer operating systems – thereby
interfering with SCO’s existing customers and prospective business opportunities. These Claims
also allege that IBM pressured and encouraged SCO partners and customers to terminate or
reduce their relationships with SCO, when SCO pursued remedies for the misappropriation of
confidential UNIX technologies into Linux.

In the 1980s, pursuant to its standard UNIX licensing agreements, AT&T granted IBM
licenses to two pre-1996 versions of UNIX. It was undisputed in the Novell Litigation that
AT&T sold all its UNIX licensing agreements, including the IBM agreements, to Novell, which
in turn sold them to SCO in the 1995 transaction at issue in the Novell Litigation. SCO is thus
the successor-in-interest to AT&T with respect to its UNIX licensing agreements with IBM.
Those agreements required IBM to treat the licensed source code and other UNIX
technologies, including the methods and concepts and know-how embodied in the source code,
as strictly confidential. Those licensing agreements also required IBM to apply those same
confidentiality restrictions to any derivative (such as AIX) that IBM developed based on the
licensed UNIX source code. IBM’s own internal documents dating back to the 1980s, as well as
the testimony of its former licensing executives, reveal that IBM acknowledged and originally
adhered to those strict restrictions.
In the late 1990s, however, notwithstanding its long history of developing and protecting
proprietary software, IBM decided to embrace Linux and the open-source movement. In making
this strategic shift, IBM recognized that SCO was the undisputed leader of the UNIX-on-Intel
market and that Linux was far from being a commercial product that could compete with SCO’s
UnixWare and OpenServer operating systems. Instead of making the huge investments that
would be required legitimately to transform Linux into a commercial product, IBM made
deliberated decisions to contribute valuable confidential UNIX technologies to Linux, including
technologies that even today are essential to UnixWare and OpenServer.
Starting approximately in 2000, notwithstanding its obligations to SCO under the AT&T
UNIX licensing agreements, IBM made substantial disclosures of technologies it was required to

8

Case 2:03-cv-00294-TC Document 1097

Filed 11/04/11 Page 14 of 17

keep confidential under those agreements. In addition, IBM misappropriated into Linux
confidential UnixWare technologies that SCO contributed to Project Monterey (and that IBM
also misappropriated into AIX for Power, as explained above). Because technologies that IBM
disclosed to Linux lay at the heart of SCO’s UnixWare and OpenServer products, IBM knew that
its disclosures to Linux would divert SCO’s existing and prospective UnixWare and OpenServer
customers to Linux, decimate SCO’s leadership position in the UNIX-on-Intel market, and
threaten the survival of SCO’s UNIX business.
Indeed, thanks in large part to IBM’s improper disclosures and contributions to Linux,
Linux became an operating system that could be used – at a much lower price – for the same
commercial functions as UnixWare and OpenServer. Following those disclosures and
contributions, as corporations transitioned their computer systems from UnixWare and
OpenServer to Linux, SCO’s revenues plummeted 74 percent.
In 2003, after the effects of its improper conduct became evident, IBM further isolated
SCO in the market by pressuring and encouraging other companies to cease or reduce their
business relationships with SCO. It was only at this point – nearly four years into IBM’s
wrongful efforts to improve Linux at the expense of SCO – that IBM even became aware of
Novell’s rights to waive SCO’s contract claims against IBM. After SCO asserted that it would
take action to protect its business, IBM asked Novell to exercise those rights and Novell agreed.
Shortly thereafter Novell announced that it would be purchasing one of the world’s leading
Linux companies with a $50 million investment by IBM. Novell completed the purchase, with
that investment, in January 2004.

Status of the Tortious Interference Claims.

The Tortious Interference Claims do not depend on SCO’s ownership of the copyrights to
the versions of UNIX that existed in 1995 and are not subject to Novell’s rights to waive SCO’s
contract claims for IBM’s breach of its licensing agreements for UNIX.
To the extent that SCO’s Tortious Interference Claims are based on IBM’s disclosure of
pre-1996 UNIX technologies whose copyrights Novell owns under the Novell Final Judgment,
SCO does not need ownership of those copyrights in order to bring tort claims based on IBM’s
obligation to SCO to keep those technologies confidential. In addition, the Tortious Interference
Claims are based on IBM’s disclosure of technologies whose copyrights Novell does not own,
including derivatives of the UNIX source code that IBM licensed through the AT&T licensing
agreements and UnixWare technologies that SCO developed after 1995 and contributed to
Project Monterey.
Similarly, to the extent that SCO’s Tortious Interference Claims are based on IBM’s
disclosure of technologies subject to the confidentiality restrictions in the AT&T licensing
agreements, Novell’s waiver rights under the Novell Final Judgment affect only the contract
claims that SCO brought against IBM – not SCO’s tort claims based on those improper
disclosures. The fact that Novell waived those contract claims years after the disclosures started
does not diminish the impropriety of the disclosures or the damage they caused to SCO. Indeed,
insofar as IBM requires the waiver to avoid liability for breach of contract, Novell’s waiver only
highlights the wrongfulness of IBM’s conduct. In addition, the Tortious Interference Claims are
also based on IBM’s disclosure of confidential UnixWare technologies that SCO developed after
1995 and that are unrelated to IBM’s AT&T licensing agreements for UNIX.
