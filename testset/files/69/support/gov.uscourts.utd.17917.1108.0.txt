Chapter 11 Trustee in Bankruptcy, Edward N.

Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant,
vs.

THE SCO GROUP, INC.’S MOTION FOR
STATUS CONFERENCE OR HEARING

Civil No.: 2:03-CV-00294-DN

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
MACHINES CORPORATION,
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff.

Honorable David Nuffer

Case 2:03-cv-00294-DN Document 1108 Filed 03/25/13 Page 2 of 3

The SCO Group, Inc. (“SCO”) respectfully moves for a Status Conference to discuss the
Motion to Reopen the Case (Docket No. 1095), which was filed on November 4, 2011, as well as
other matters. IBM filed its Opposition Memorandum on November 21, 2011 (Docket No.
1100). SCO filed its Reply Memorandum on December 8, 2011 (Docket No. 1102). Therefore,
the briefing on that motion was complete as of December 8, 2011.
After the Motion to Reopen was filed, but before the briefing was completed, Judge
Campbell recused herself on November 9, 2011 (Docket 1099). The case was then transferred
to Judge Waddoups on November 10, 2011, and the Motion to Reopen the Case (Docket No.
1095) was set for hearing on April 18, 2012, (Docket No. 1101). On December 9, 2011, after
the briefing was complete, Judge Waddoups recused (Docket 1103) and the matter was
transferred to Judge Sam who also recused on December 14, 2011 (Docket 1104). The matter
was subsequently transferred to Judge Benson, and Judge Benson reset the Motion to Reopen the
Case (Docket No. 1095) to April 23, 2012 (Docket No. 1105). On March 31, 2012, the matter
was transferred to Judge Nuffer (Docket No. 1106) and on April 2, 2012, all hearings and
deadlines were vacated.
SCO filed a Request to Submit for Decision regarding this Motion (Docket No. 1107) on
June 14, 2012, seeking a setting to hear SCO’s Motion to Reopen the Case (Docket No. 1095).
SCO incorporates here the arguments made in the Request to Submit.
Because SCO’s Motion to Reopen the Case has been pending before the Court since
December 8, 2011, and was originally set for a hearing to be held on April 18, 2012, SCO
respectfully requests that the Court schedule as soon as practicable a status conference and/or
hearing on SCO’s Motion to Reopen the Case (Docket No. 1095).
