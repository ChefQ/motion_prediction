Even if Plaintiffs’ claims could be construed as extending the
Bivens remedy to the immigration context, no special factors exist
that counsel hesitation to apply Bivens in this context. ............................ 15

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 10 of 47 PageID# 439

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs allege that several individual federal law enforcement officers violated their
constitutional rights by seizing Plaintiffs without any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing and by
conducting home raids without a warrant or consent. This is exactly the type of conduct the
Supreme Court found actionable in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of
Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). The only difference between the federal law enforcement
agents in Bivens and those here is the name of the federal agency on their jackets. The Supreme
Court’s recent opinion in Ziglar v. Abbasi, which narrowed the availability of certain Bivens
actions against senior government officials, explicitly said that the opinion “is not intended to
cast doubt on the continued force, or even the necessity, of Bivens in the search-and-seizure
context in which it arose.” 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1856 (2017). This is exactly the type of case
Plaintiffs bring here.
Granting Defendants’ motion to dismiss would allow U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (“ICE”) agents to search and seize citizens and suspected non-citizens with
impunity, without any concern for clearly established constitutional limits. Under Defendants’
strained reasoning, the only possible remedy available to individuals like Plaintiffs who suffer
unconstitutional searches and seizures by ICE agents is the suppression of evidence in a removal
proceeding before an immigration judge. This is not what Congress intended, not what courts
have held, and not what the Constitution requires. Eight Plaintiffs are unable to assert their
constitutional claims in immigration court in any way other than through a defensive motion to
suppress evidence, which would not provide them any monetary relief or vindication of the
constitutional rights that Bivens held they have. Furthermore, one Plaintiff is wholly unable to
assert his claims in immigration court because he is not in removal proceedings. Accordingly,
the Court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 11 of 47 PageID# 440

BACKGROUND
The allegations in the amended complaint show that Defendants have engaged in a
practice of unlawfully seizing and searching males who appear to be of Latino descent, and
unlawfully entering those men’s homes. On February 8, 2017, in the early morning hours,
Plaintiff Germán Velasquez Perdomo had just left his house on his way to work when he was
stopped without reasonable suspicion in his driveway in Arlington, Virginia, by four Defendant
ICE Agents who identified themselves as “police.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20–21. The ICE Defendants
flashed a photograph of a purported suspect who they referred to as Santo Del Cid and asked if
Mr. Velasquez Perdomo knew the man. Id. ¶ 21. When he responded that he did not, the agents
demanded Mr. Velasquez Perdomo empty his pockets and frisked him. Id. ¶¶ 21–22. They
questioned him about who was inside his house and, even though they had no warrant, demanded
he let them in. Id. ¶¶ 22, 24. Mr. Velasquez Perdomo protested, but feeling he had no choice but
to obey the agents’ commands, he relented. Id. ¶¶ 22–23.
Once inside the house, the agents went from room to room, ordering all of the male
occupants — Plaintiffs Luis Velasquez Perdomo, Pedro Velasquez Perdomo, Eder Aguilar
Aritas, Eduardo Montano Fernández, Nelson Callejas Peña, and José Cárcamo — out of their
rooms and detaining them in the living rooms on the first and basement floors. Id. ¶¶ 25–43. All
of the men are of apparent Latino race or ethnicity, but none of them looks like the alleged target
in the photograph shown by Defendants, and Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that any of
them had violated the immigration laws of the United States or committed any other violation of
U.S. law. Id. ¶¶ 10, 20, 26, 27, 38, 39, 42, 54. In the course of detaining the men in the first
floor living room, one of the ICE agents asked Mr. Cárcamo if there were any other “Spanish
families” in the neighborhood. Id. ¶ 46. After approximately one hour of unlawfully detaining
the men, Defendants arrested each of them except Mr. Cárcamo. Id. ¶¶ 45–46.
2

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 12 of 47 PageID# 441

Nine days later and six miles away, Defendants stopped Plaintiffs Mynor Abdiel Tun-Cos
and José Pajarito Saput — both men of apparent Latino race or ethnicity — without reasonable
suspicion in the early morning hours outside their apartment as they were pulling out of their
parking space to drive to work. Id. ¶¶ 55–59. Despite having no reasonable, articulable
suspicion that Mr. Tun-Cos or Mr. Pajarito Saput had violated any law, Defendants demanded
the men produce identification and ordered them out of their car. Two Defendants ordered Mr.
Pajarito Saput to let Defendants into his apartment. Id. ¶ 62. Mr. Pajarito Saput reasonably
believed that he had no choice but to obey the Defendants’ command. Id. At no point did Mr.
Pajarito Saput or any other individual give consent for Defendants to enter the apartment, and the
agents did not present a warrant and did not have reasonable suspicion that the men had violated
any laws. Id. ¶ 59, 62.
Once in the apartment, a Defendant showed Mr. Tun-Cos photos of two young men and
asked if he knew them. Mr. Tun-Cos told the Defendant that the two men are brothers named
Wilber and Carmelino Houx-Hernández (the “Houx-Hernández brothers”), and that Mr. Tun-Cos
had kicked them out of the apartment long ago because of their drinking. Id. ¶ 63. The
Defendant asked Mr. Tun-Cos if he knew the Houx-Hernández brothers’ current contact
information, and Mr. Tun-Cos responded truthfully that he did not. Id. The same Defendant told
Mr. Tun-Cos that the Houx-Hernández brothers were “in trouble with the police” but gave no
further reasons why Defendants were looking for them. Id. ¶ 63. Neither Mr. Tun-Cos nor Mr.
Pajarito Saput resemble either of the Houx-Hernández brothers. Id. ¶ 64. Despite Mr. Tun-Cos
and Mr. Pajarito Saput’s cooperation, and without any reasonable reason for doing so,
Defendants arrested and frisked both men. Id. ¶ 65.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
When a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) — which applies here only to Defendants’ argument
that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) strips this Court of jurisdiction — it “should prevail only if the
material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a
matter of law.” Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac R.R. Co. v. United States, 945 F.2d 765,
768 (4th Cir. 1991).
When assessing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) —
which applies to the balance of Defendants’ arguments — a court “must take the complaint’s
factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor.” Robertson v.
Sea Pines Real Estate Cos., Inc. 679 F.3d 278, 284 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing E.I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir. 2011)). Those allegations
must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 570 (2007). A complaint “need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and
the grounds upon which it rests” and must be “construed liberally so as to do substantial justice.”
Wright v. North Carolina, 787 F.3d 256, 263 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting E.I. du Pont de Nemours &
Co., 637 F.3d at 440; Pub. Emps.’ Ret. Ass’n of Colo. v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 551 F.3d 305,
311 (4th Cir. 2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
ARGUMENT
Defendants’ three arguments for dismissal are without merit. First, the Immigration and
Nationality Act (“INA”) does not remove this Court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because
Plaintiffs are not challenging a final order of removal and their claims are wholly collateral to the
removal process. Second, Plaintiffs’ claims are properly redressable under Bivens because they
fit squarely within the context of cases for which Bivens remedies have been recognized, and
4

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 14 of 47 PageID# 443

there are no “special factors” that counsel hesitation against implying a Bivens remedy under
these circumstances. Finally, Plaintiffs have pleaded with sufficient specificity that Defendants
violated clearly established constitutional standards and therefore are not entitled to qualified
immunity.
I.

The INA Does Not Remove This Court’s Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims.
A. Plaintiffs do not seek review of a removal order, so the INA does not apply here.
Defendants’ motion omits key pieces of the INA in an attempt to argue that 8 U.S.C. §

1252(b)(9) bars Plaintiffs’ claims. The opening line of § 1252(b) states that its subsections apply
only “[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).” 8 U.S.C. §
1252(b). Subsection (a)(1), in turn, addresses only “[j]udicial review of a final order of
removal.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1). Accordingly, § 1252(b)(9) bars only district court review of a
final order of removal. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, “[t]he title of § 1252 is ‘Judicial review
of orders of removal.’ Indeed, the entire section is focused on orders of removal.” Singh v.
Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969, 977 (9th Cir. 2007). Here, no order of removal exists as to any
Plaintiff, and Plaintiffs are not seeking judicial review of any order of removal. Section
1252(b)(9)’s jurisdictional bar is therefore inapplicable.
Although the Fourth Circuit has not addressed the scope of § 1252(b)(9), other circuits
have held that § 1252(b)(9) unambiguously applies only to review of final removal orders. For
example, in Singh, the Ninth Circuit held that “[b]y virtue of their explicit language, both
§§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) apply only to those claims seeking judicial review of orders of
removal.” Id. at 978. Similarly, the Third Circuit has held that “Section 1252(b)(9) . . . requires
only that, when there is an order of removal under subsection (a)(1), review of any issues related
to that order must be consolidated into a single petition for review and cannot be brought
piecemeal.” Chehazeh v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 666 F.3d 118, 131 (3d Cir. 2012) (emphases
5

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 15 of 47 PageID# 444

added). Thus, the Third Circuit held that a plaintiff’s challenge to the reopening of removal
proceedings that had been resolved in his favor was not barred because, as is the case here, the
plaintiff was “not seeking review of any order of removal — as there has been no such order
with respect to him.” Id. at 133. The Eleventh Circuit agrees. “Because section 1252(b)(9)
applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal,’ and this case does not involve
review of an order of removal, we find that section 1252(b)(9) does not apply to this case.”
Madu v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 470 F.3d 1362, 1367 (11th Cir. 2006) (alteration in original) (quoting
INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 (2001)). Although Defendants cite the First Circuit’s decision
in Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 510 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2007), to support
their argument that § 1252(b)(9) bars Plaintiffs’ claims, “[t]he reasoning of Aguilar, however,
appears to conflict with the Supreme Court’s explicit instruction in St. Cyr.” Chehazeh, 666 F.3d
at 133 (citing St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 313).
Moreover, several district courts have held that § 1252(b)(9) does not bar claims like
Plaintiffs’ claims here. For example, in Diaz-Bernal v. Myers, the plaintiffs brought Bivens
claims against several ICE defendants alleging unconstitutional seizures and arrests, much like
Plaintiffs do here. See 758 F. Supp. 2d 106, 114 (D. Conn. 2010). The court held that
§ 1252(b)(9) did not bar the plaintiffs’ claims, even though a final order of removal existed,
because the plaintiffs’ claims did not arise out of the final order. See id. at 123. Other district
courts have reached a similar conclusion. See e.g., Mochama v. Zwetow, No. 14-2121-KHV,
2017 WL 36363, at *6 (D. Kan. Jan. 3, 2017) (holding that § 1252(b)(9) does not bar claims of
unlawful solitary confinement and retaliation); Franco-Gonzales v. Holder, 767 F. Supp. 2d
1034, 1045–46 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (holding that § 1252(b)(9) does not bar a habeas petition
alleging violations of the INA, the Fifth Amendment, and the Rehabilitation Act). Accordingly,

6

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 16 of 47 PageID# 445

§ 1252(b)(9) does not bar Plaintiffs’ claims of unconstitutional seizures and home raids because
the claims do not arise out of a final order of removal.
B. Plaintiffs’ claims are independent of and collateral to the removal process and
thus present no logistical concerns that would warrant dismissal.
Section 1252(b)(9) does not bar Plaintiffs’ claims for the additional and separate reason
that they are independent of and collateral to the removal process. The bottom line is that
Plaintiffs’ claims seek no relief whatsoever relating to Plaintiffs’ removal proceedings and
challenge no conduct other than Defendants’ unconstitutional seizures and home invasions —
conduct that occurred prior to the issuance of a Notice to Appear and before the commencement
of removal proceedings against Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ claims in the case, based on Defendants’
unconstitutional conduct, would exist even if the government had declined to initiate removal
proceedings. 1
Section 1252(b)(9) provides in relevant part that “[j]udicial review of all questions of law
and fact . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the
United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order
under this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Courts have held that “the phrase ‘arising from’ in
section 1252(b)(9) was intended to ‘exclude claims that are independent of, or wholly collateral
to, the removal process.’” Diaz-Bernal, 758 F. Supp. 2d at 122 (quoting Aguilar, 510 F.3d at
11). Removal proceedings are not initiated until ICE serves a Notice to Appear. See 8 U.S.C. §
1229(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14 (“Jurisdiction vests and proceedings before an Immigration Judge
commence, when a charging document [(the Notice to Appear)] is filed with the Immigration
Court by [ICE].”). Here, ICE did not serve Plaintiffs with Notices to Appear until several hours

1

Mr. Cárcamo is not in immigration proceedings so, as Defendants admit, their § 1252(b)(9)
argument is wholly inapplicable to him. See Defs.’ Mem. at 6 n.3.
7

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 17 of 47 PageID# 446

after the initial seizures and home invasions. These notices were served not at the location of the
seizures and home invasions, but at an ICE office several miles away. Plaintiffs are not
challenging any aspect of the removal process, such as their detention and processing at an ICE
facility, or any procedural aspect of their immigration proceedings. Rather, Plaintiffs are
challenging only the initial seizure and home invasion conducted by ICE agents without
reasonable suspicion or consent — actions that are wholly unrelated to and happened before any
removal proceedings were commenced against Plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs in the cases Defendants cite that barred claims under § 1252(b)(9)
generally were attempting to challenge actions that were much more intertwined with, or
occurred during, the removal proceedings. See J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026 (9th Cir. 2016)
(plaintiffs’ claims related to right to counsel in removal proceedings); Aguilar, 510 F.3d 1
(plaintiffs’ claims related to detention conditions and right to counsel in removal proceedings);
Bonhometre v. Gonzales, 414 F.3d 442 (3d Cir. 2005) (plaintiff was attempting to challenge final
order of removal). 2 Even in these cases, courts recognized that § 1252(b)(9) has exceptions for
claims, such as Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the initial seizures, which occurred prior to the
commencement of removal proceedings. For example, the court in J.E.F.M explained that
“§ 1252(b)(9) has built-in limits” by excluding, and therefore not barring, “any claim that does
not arise from removal proceedings.” 837 F.3d at 1032. The court highlighted that §§

2

Defendants also cite an unpublished District of Minnesota opinion, Arias v. U.S. Immigration &
Customs Enforcement, No. 07-1959 ADM/JSM, 2008 WL 1827604 (D. Minn. Apr. 23, 2008).
Beside the fact that it is an unpublished district court opinion from another circuit, the case is of
little value here because, in addition to challenging the initial seizure, the plaintiffs challenged
aspects of the removal process, such as alleged violations of their right-to-counsel and right
against self-incrimination. Id. at *4. The court improperly lumped the claims together in a brief
discussion of § 1252(b)(9). See id. at *6. Here, Plaintiffs are challenging only the initial seizure
and home invasion, conduct wholly unrelated to the removal proceedings. Moreover, the court
relied solely on Aguilar, the reasoning of which, as discussed above, is incorrect.
8

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 18 of 47 PageID# 447

1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) only “channel judicial review over final orders of removal to the
courts of appeals.” Id. at 1031 (emphasis added); see also Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 11 (holding that §
1252(b)(9)’s bar “exclude[s] claims that are independent of, or wholly collateral to, the removal
process,” and implying that Bivens claims fall into this exception). As the First Circuit
commented in Aguilar, “Congress knows how to bar claims in the immigration context when it
desires to do so,” id. at 11 n.2, and it did not do so in § 1252(b)(9) for claims seeking redress for
wrongful conduct that is separate from and antecedent to removal proceedings.
Plaintiffs’ claims here are wholly separate from their removal proceedings, and the
outcome of the removal proceedings is wholly separate from this case. Plaintiffs are seeking
monetary and other substantive relief for violations of their constitutional rights. See Am.
Compl. at 21 (listing the “Relief Requested”). In the removal proceedings, Plaintiffs can seek
only suppression of evidence. This situation is similar to that in Diaz-Bernal. As the court
explained in Diaz-Bernal, “although the plaintiffs here could have — and for the most part, did
— raise constitutional arguments before the immigration judge, the only potential remedy in that
forum was the suppression of any evidence obtained from their allegedly illegal arrests.” 758 F.
Supp. 2d at 123. The court held that “because the immigration judge could not have afforded the
plaintiffs relief for the constitutional claims raised in this action, those claims do not arise out of
the order of removal, and jurisdiction is not barred by section 1252(b)(9).” Id. The court
emphasized this point, repeating that the immigration judge was unable to afford the plaintiffs
“substantive relief on their constitutional claims” because “[t]he most the immigration judge
could do was suppress the illegally obtained evidence.” Id. The same is true here. Moreover,
the legal standard the immigration judge will use to assess Plaintiffs’ motion for suppression is
different than the legal standard this Court will use to assess Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. In

9

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 19 of 47 PageID# 448

the removal proceedings, current Fourth Circuit case law allows suppression only for “egregious
violations of the Fourth Amendment.” See Yanez-Marquez v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 434, 450 (4th Cir.
2015). Conversely, in this action, Defendants can be held liable if a jury finds that they violated
clearly established Fourth Amendment principles.
In short, this Court and the immigration court will be addressing different matters —
substantive claims for relief here versus whether removal is proper under admissible evidence
there — relying on different legal standards. Defendants’ concerns regarding uncertainty and a
lack of uniformity therefore are unfounded, and § 1252(b)(9) does not bar Plaintiffs’ claims.
II.

The Complaint States a Valid Bivens Claim.
A. This case would not extend Bivens into a new context.
Defendants assert in their motion to dismiss that Plaintiffs are “ask[ing] this Court to

extend Bivens into a new context.” Defs.’ Mem. at 16. That is plainly incorrect, however, as the
Supreme Court’s recent decision in Abbasi shows. The Court clarified in Abbasi that “[t]he
proper test for determining whether a case presents a new Bivens context” is whether the case is
“different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases.” 137 S. Ct. at 1859. The Court
recognized a number of non-exhaustive differences that prove instructive in making this
determination:
A case might differ in a meaningful way because of the rank of the officers
involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official
action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the
problem or emergency to be confronted; the statutory or other legal mandate under
which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary
into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors
that previous Bivens cases did not consider.
Id. at 1860. Most importantly, however, the Court acknowledged that nothing in its decision in
Abbasi was “intended to cast doubt on the continued force, or even the necessity, of Bivens in the
search-and-seizure context in which it arose.” Id. at 1856. Indeed, the Court continued, “[t]he
10

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 20 of 47 PageID# 449

settled law of Bivens in this common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement, and the
undoubted reliance upon it as a fixed principle in the law, are powerful reasons to retain it in that
sphere.” Id. at 1857.
The essential factual and legal ingredients alleged by Plaintiffs in their amended
complaint are similar in all material respects to those that were at play in Bivens: a team of
federal agents acting under color of federal authority seized Plaintiffs, conducted a warrantless
search of their homes, and arrested them, which gave rise to claims of unreasonable search and
seizure in violation of the Constitution. See Bivens, 403 U.S. at 389. This puts Plaintiffs’ claims
squarely within the well-established bounds of Bivens. The fact that the Bivens defendants were
narcotics agents who allegedly used unreasonable force in the plaintiff’s arrest does not make
that case “different in a meaningful way” from this one. Because the core elements of this case
arise out of unconstitutional searches and seizures by federal law enforcement officers, and
because the Abbasi Court expressly held that the Bivens remedy remains readily available
(indeed, “necess[ary]”) in that context, see 137 S. Ct. at 1856, the minor factual distinctions
between this case and Bivens are inconsequential from a legal perspective, see id. at 1865. As
the Court explained, “Some differences . . . will be so trivial that they will not suffice to create a
new Bivens context.” Id.
Taken together, the Abbasi factors — the majority of which Defendants avoid discussing
in their motion — illustrate that Plaintiffs’ case is not an extension of Bivens to a new context.
The instant case, like Bivens itself, involves claims against line-level law enforcement officers.
Courts considering Bivens challenges have commonly distinguished between suits against onthe-ground personnel and those against higher-up superiors, finding the former are squarely
within the established Bivens context. See Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 70 (2001)

11

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 21 of 47 PageID# 450

(observing that “[t]he purpose of Bivens is to deter individual federal officers from committing
constitutional violations”); cf. Attkisson v. Holder, No. 1:17-cv-364 (LMB/JFA), 2017 WL
5013230, at *6 (E.D. Va. Nov. 1, 2017) (finding that the plaintiffs’ claims presented a new
Bivens context because, inter alia, “Bivens only allowed the plaintiff to sue line-level FBI agents,
whereas plaintiffs wish to sue a former Attorney General and Postmaster General”). Indeed, like
the plaintiffs in Bivens, Plaintiffs challenge the specific actions of individual law enforcement
officials. Plaintiffs do not attack “general” or any other policy imperatives determined by
agency leadership. Cf. id. (concluding that plaintiffs’ claims constituted an extension of Bivens
in part because plaintiffs’ claims involve[d] “a different level of generality (broad policy
decisions rather than individual unconstitutional actions)”).
In addition, the constitutional rights at issue in the instant case are identical to those
which were directly addressed in Bivens and subsequent Supreme Court cases applying Bivens:
the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment and
the right to be free from unconstitutional discrimination under the Fifth Amendment. See Bivens,
403 U.S. at 392; see also Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 242 (1979) (“[A] cause of action may
be implied directly under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment . . . .”). And relevant judicial guidance makes clear that an individual’s apparent
race, ethnicity, or national origin alone is not sufficient to provide an ICE agent with a
reasonable basis for stopping that individual. See United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S.
873, 885–87 (1975).
Notwithstanding Defendants’ argument to the contrary, there is no meaningful distinction
between the narcotics agents’ authority in Bivens and Defendants’ authority in this case. Both
sets of agents have the power to stop, search, and arrest, compare 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a), (c)

12

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 22 of 47 PageID# 451

(describing the powers of ICE agents), with 18 U.S.C. §§ 3052, 3107 (describing the powers of
FBI agents), and they must both hew to the same constitutional standards dictated by Fourth
Amendment jurisprudence. See Bivens, 403 U.S. at 392 (the Fourth Amendment guarantees the
“absolute right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures carried out by virtue of federal
authority”). Nothing in Abbasi suggests that the agency name on Defendants’ jackets changes
the framework under which their conduct must be evaluated.
Plaintiffs’ case also does not pose any risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into
the functioning of the other branches of government. In Abbasi, the petitioners initiated a
challenge against confinement conditions imposed on aliens detained for immigration violations
pursuant to a high-level executive policy created in the wake of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, which required an examination of sensitive national security issues that are within the
province of Congress and the President to decide. See 137 S. Ct. at 1861. By contrast, the
instant case does not demand an inquiry into the affairs of the Legislative or Executive branches
— rather, Plaintiffs have filed a damages suit that simply seeks to hold the individual Defendant
ICE agents accountable for their individual actions in violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.
The filing of such a lawsuit is no more disruptive of the functions of the other branches than was
the suit against the line officers in Bivens itself, which the Supreme Court said maintains its
“continued force” and “necessity” in the “search-and-seizure context in which it arose.” Id. at
1856; see also id. at 1882 (Breyer, J. dissenting) (“All damages actions risk disrupting to some
degree future decisionmaking by members of the Executive or Legislative Branches. Where this
Court has authorized Bivens actions, it has found that disruption tolerable, and it has explained
why disruption is, from a constitutional perspective, desirable.”).

13

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 23 of 47 PageID# 452

There also are no “special factors” present in the instant case that the Court in Bivens did
not consider. Abbasi reaffirmed the cognizability of run-of-the-mill unreasonable search-andseizure claims, see 137 S. Ct. at 1856, and through such recognition, the Supreme Court has
already decided that the concerns Defendants raise in their motion about delay, crossexamination, and floodgate litigation are inferior to the interests of those whose constitutional
rights have been trampled by government actors. Put simply, Plaintiffs’ suit no more risks
chilling appropriate law enforcement activities than did Bivens itself. See Pellegrino v. U.S.
Transp. Sec. Admin, No. 09-5505, 2014 WL 1489939, at *13 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 16, 2014)
(“Deterrence of federal officials from committing constitutional violations is integral to the
existence of Bivens actions.” (citing Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 505 (1978))), amended on
reconsideration on other grounds, No. 09-5505, 2014 WL 3952936 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 12, 2014).
Indeed, Judge Cacheris of this Court recently noted in response to similar arguments
concerning the appropriateness of a proposed Bivens remedy in the context of Transportation
Security Administration (“TSA”) security screenings that “[t]he risk of deterring legitimate law
enforcement activity through personal liability . . . is not unique to this context.” Linlor v.
Polson, 263 F. Supp. 3d 613, 623 (E.D. Va. 2017). Judge Cacheris went on to point out that
“[m]any of Defendant’s observations about the nature of the TSA’s work — for example, that
TSA officers must make split second decisions in a fast moving environment to protect public
safety — are no less applicable to the work of other federal agents who have successfully
contended with Bivens liability.” Id. The same logic applies with equal force here.
Because Plaintiffs’ claims do not arise in a new context, the relief sought by Plaintiffs
clearly is available under Bivens.

14

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 24 of 47 PageID# 453

B. Even if Plaintiffs’ claims could be construed as extending the Bivens remedy to
the immigration context, no special factors exist that counsel hesitation to apply
Bivens in this context. 3
Notwithstanding Defendants’ fallback argument to the contrary, there are no special
factors in the immigration context that warrant denying Plaintiffs the remedy they seek through
this lawsuit. “[A] Bivens remedy will not be available if there are special factors counselling
hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1857 (quoting
Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18 (1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The phrase
“special factors counselling hesitation” evades clear definition. Id. However, Supreme Court
precedent at the very least requires the consideration of the following issues in connection with
any special factors analysis: (1) whether “any alternative, existing process for protecting the
interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new
and freestanding remedy in damages”; (2) if not, whether there are “any special factors
counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.” Wilkie v. Robbins,
551 U.S. 537, 550 (2007) (quoting Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 378 (1983)) (internal quotation
mark omitted). In this case, there is no alternative process for protecting Plaintiffs’ interests, and
there are no special factors that would counsel hesitation to apply Bivens here.
1. There is no alternative, existing process by which Plaintiffs can vindicate their
constitutional rights.
Defendants first contend that the INA is a comprehensive statutory scheme that precludes
the implication of a damages remedy in the immigration enforcement context. See Defs.’ Mem.

3

For the sake of clarity, we note here that the “special factors” discussed in this Section II.B are
distinct from those discussed in Section II.A. The “presence of potential special factors that
previous Bivens cases did not consider” described in Section II.A is merely one among many
nonexhaustive factors that Abbasi identified as indicative of whether a particular case constitutes
an extension of Bivens to a new context. If the Court determines that the case does in fact
constitute such an extension, it must proceed to determine whether “special factors” counsel
hesitation, which requires consideration of the two issues described in Wilkie v. Robbins below.
15

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 25 of 47 PageID# 454

at 17–19. In support of this proposition, Defendants rely principally on three cases in which
Bivens claims were deemed foreclosed in light of the availability of remedies provided under the
INA. See Alvarez v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 818 F.3d 1194 (11th Cir. 2016); De La
Paz v. Coy, 786 F.3d 367 (5th Cir. 2015); Mirmehdi v. United States, 689 F.3d 975 (9th Cir.
2012). These decisions are inapposite, however. Alvarez and Mirmehdi are readily
distinguishable because the violations prompting the plaintiffs’ suits in those cases occurred
while they were in detention and pending removal, circumstances that clearly fall within the
ambit of the INA. See Alvarez, 818 F.3d at 1208–10 (concluding that no Bivens remedy was
available where plaintiff brought a Bivens action against government officials based on the fact
that ICE agents lodged a detainer against him while his removal was pending); Mirmehdi v.
United States, 689 F.3d at 982–83 (holding that Bivens did not provide remedy for
undocumented aliens to sue federal agents for monetary damages for wrongful detention pending
deportation).
The claim in De La Paz arose from pre-detention stops and arrests of undocumented
aliens by Customs and Border Protection agents. See 786 F.3d at 369. The court’s conclusion
that the INA precluded a Bivens remedy in the immigration context rested in large part on the
court’s view that aliens are already entitled to extensive procedural protections — including
suppression of evidence — in removal proceedings. 4 See id. at 375–77. This reasoning is
flawed: the availability of certain limited procedural protections in removal proceedings does
not demonstrate that a comprehensive statutory scheme precluding a Bivens remedy exists where

4

The court’s other principal argument — that Congress’s frequent amendments to the INA
evince an intent to preclude a Bivens remedy — fails for the reasons described in Section II.B.2.
See infra Section II.B.2. at 20–21.
16

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 26 of 47 PageID# 455

the conduct challenged by the plaintiff occurred prior to such proceedings and the particular
substantive relief sought by the plaintiff is not available in immigration court.
The District of Connecticut’s logic in Diaz-Bernal stands on much firmer ground. DiazBernal involved, inter alia, Fourth Amendment claims brought by a group of plaintiffs who were
the subject of an early-morning ICE raid and whose homes were unlawfully entered by the
agents conducting the raid. See 758 F. Supp. 2d at 111, 113. Like Defendants here, the
individual defendants in Diaz-Bernal argued that the plaintiffs’ Bivens claims were foreclosed by
the INA because the plaintiffs could raise their constitutional challenges in their removal
proceedings. See id. at 128. The court rejected that argument, however, concluding that
“[a]lthough the plaintiffs . . . can raise their constitutional issues before the immigration judge,
they can only do [so] by seeking to suppress evidence, and not by seeking affirmative relief.” Id.
Furthermore, the court observed, the INA “does not provide a remedial scheme for violations
committed by immigration officials outside of removal proceedings.” Id. (second emphasis
added).
Like the plaintiffs in Diaz-Bernal, the eight Plaintiffs who are currently in removal
proceedings have asserted Fourth Amendment claims against individual ICE agents for conduct
committed prior to the commencement of such proceedings and seek specific relief that is
unavailable in such proceedings. Although the INA offers aliens in removal proceedings various
protections, it does not provide Plaintiffs with affirmative remedies — such as those sought here
— through which to vindicate their constitutional rights. See Malesko, 534 U.S. at 74
(recognizing that the “core purpose” of Bivens is to “deter[] individual officers from engaging in
unconstitutional wrongdoing” (emphasis added)). Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has
suggested that the most relevant remedy available in the immigration context — namely,

17

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 27 of 47 PageID# 456

suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence — may not deter future unlawful immigration
enforcement action. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1043 (1984) (noting that
“several . . . factors significantly reduce the likely deterrent value of the exclusionary rule in a
civil deportation proceeding,” including that “regardless of how the arrest is effected, deportation
will still be possible when evidence not derived directly from the arrest is sufficient to support
deportation”).
Mr. Cárcamo in particular, who is not in removal proceedings, has no alternative avenue
for any relief other than this pending Bivens action. As Defendants concede in their motion, see
Defs.’ Mem. at 17 n.7, the supposed comprehensive nature of the INA is entirely irrelevant to his
claims. 5 See Lyttle v. United States, 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1276 (M.D. Ga. 2012) (holding that
the existence of the INA’s remedial scheme was not sufficient to foreclose the availability of a
Bivens remedy because the INA fails to “provide ‘meaningful safeguards or remedies’ for a U.S.
citizen like [the plaintiff].” (quoting Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412, 425 (1988))); Argueta
v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 08-1652 (PGS), 2009 WL 1307236, at *17 (D.N.J.
May 7, 2009) (holding that plaintiff with Temporary Protection Status who was detained for 36
hours and later released retained the right to bring a Bivens claim in federal court for
constitutional violations because “it [was] not clear how she could even be involved in the
administrative process outlined in the INA”). Defendants’ concession also undermines their
arguments regarding the other Plaintiffs: constitutionally speaking, there is no difference
between Mr. Cárcamo and his fellow Plaintiffs because they all reside within the United States

5

Contrary to Defendants’ allegations, see Defs.’ Mem. at 19 n.9, Mr. Cárcamo is a United States
citizen. See Ex. 1, José Cárcamo Passport. The fact that Defendants failed even to accurately
describe Mr. Cárcamo’s legal status — information that is readily ascertainable to them — gives
further credence to Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants failed to execute their investigatory
functions with due diligence.

and have established substantial connections therewith, so the Court should view their plights in
an identical light. See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 271 (1990) (noting that
aliens are entitled to constitutional protections, which include those afforded under the Fourth
Amendment, so long as they “have come within the territory of the United States and developed
substantial connections with this country”); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982)
(granting undocumented aliens constitutional protections because “[w]hatever his status under
the immigration laws, an alien is surely a ‘person’ in any ordinary sense of that term”). Thus, the
INA is equally irrelevant to all Plaintiffs’ claims.
2. There are no additional “special factors” that would counsel hesitation against
implying a Bivens remedy under these circumstances.
Defendants also assert that other “special factors” counsel hesitation in this context. See
Defs.’ Mem. at 19–27. Specifically, Defendants contend that separation-of-powers concerns,
administrability problems, and the practical consequences on qualified immunity of allowing
Plaintiffs’ suit to proceed, counsel against implying a remedy under Bivens. See id.
Defendants have failed to demonstrate how Plaintiffs’ case implicates any of those
concerns. For one thing, Plaintiffs’ claims do not raise any separation-of-powers concerns with
respect to the Executive Branch. Abbasi involved a full frontal attack against the United States’
alien detention policy in the aftermath of September 11, and named as defendants several federal
executive officials and detention facility wardens. See 137 S. Ct. at 1851–52. In rejecting the
plaintiffs’ Bivens argument, the Court emphasized that the plaintiffs’ claims, if allowed to
proceed, would encroach upon the unique prerogatives of the Executive branch. See, e.g., id. at
1858 (discussing “the formal policy adopted by the Executive Officials in the wake of the
September 11 attacks”); id. at 1860 (noting that plaintiffs challenged a “high-level executive
policy”); id. at 1860–61 (cautioning that “the discovery and litigation process would either
19

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 29 of 47 PageID# 458

border upon or directly implicate the discussion and deliberations that led to the formation of the
policy in question”).
By contrast, Plaintiffs’ grievances are aimed only at the individual line ICE agents
directly responsible for violating their constitutional rights, not at any greater policy priorities.
See Linlor, 263 F. Supp. 3d at 625 (explaining that special factors did not counsel hesitation
because the cases presented “a relatively simple, discrete question of whether a federal officer
applied excessive force during a Fourth Amendment search”); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S.
471, 485 (1994) (“[T]he purpose of Bivens is to deter the officer.”). The fact that Defendants are
ICE agents does not turn an otherwise routine search-and-seizure case into an inquiry into
loosely construed “immigration” or “national security” issues. See Linlor, 263 F. Supp. 3d at
623 (rejecting argument that Bivens action to redress alleged excessive force at airport implicates
national security because such argument “does little to tie specific national security concerns to
the context under consideration” and “rests primarily upon generalizations about the sui generis
nature of the airport setting”).
Congress’s authority over immigration matters also is not implicated by Plaintiffs’ suit
because Plaintiffs “allege independent constitutional harms that were committed against them
prior to the commencement of removal proceedings.” Diaz-Bernal, 758 F. Supp. 2d at 129
(emphasis added); see also id. (“Although Congress does have great control over immigration,
including over removal proceedings, that does not mean that Congress has great control over all
claims brought by immigrants.”). Defendants make much of the fact that Congress has for years
actively legislated in the immigration arena but has never provided an express damages remedy
in the INA, and they argue that the absence of such an express remedy is indicative of
Congress’s intent. See Defs.’ Mem. at 21. In each of the three cases in which the Supreme

20

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 30 of 47 PageID# 459

Court has implied damages remedies under the Constitution, however, the Court determined that
the absence of an explicit statutory prohibition barring monetary relief should be regarded as a
sign that such remedy remains available. See Carlson, 446 U.S. 14, 19 (1980) (observing, in
support of implied damages remedy for Eighth Amendment prisoner mistreatment claims, that
there is “nothing in the Federal Tort Claims Act . . . or its legislative history to show that
Congress meant to pre-empt a Bivens remedy”); Davis, 442 U.S. at 247 (emphasizing, in support
of implied damages remedy for Fifth Amendment Due Process claims, that there was “no
evidence . . . that Congress meant . . . to foreclose alternative remedies available to those not
covered by the statute”); Bivens, 403 U.S. at 397 (permitting implication of damages remedy in a
Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure context where the Court had “no explicit congressional
declaration that persons injured by a federal officer’s violation of the Fourth Amendment may
not recover money damages from the agents”).
Defendants argue nonetheless that this Court should regard Plaintiffs’ amended complaint
as an implicit challenge to Executive Branch policy and priorities based on references in
Plaintiffs’ original complaint to the “Trump Administration,” “collateral arrests,” and statements
made by high-level government officials and on Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendants’ motion to
strike the Arlington Plaintiffs or sever their claims under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 20
and 21. See Defs.’ Mem. at 22–23. Plaintiffs’ original complaint, just like their amended
complaint, clearly sought relief only from the individual ICE agents who directly violated
Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. See generally Compl. Yet even if certain of the allegations in
Plaintiffs’ original complaint could be construed as an attack against high-level policy and/or
officials, those allegations are no longer part of this case. All of the allegations in the original
complaint — including those with which Defendants have taken apparent issue — have been

21

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 31 of 47 PageID# 460

wholly superseded and nullified by the allegations in Plaintiffs’ amended complaint. See, e.g.,
Young v. City of Mount Ranier, 238 F.3d 567, 572 (4th Cir. 2001) (“As a general rule, an
amended pleading ordinarily supersedes the original and renders it of no legal effect.” (quoting
In re Crysen/Montenay Energy Co. v. Shell Oil Co., 226 F.3d 160, 162 (2d Cir. 2000)) (internal
quotation marks omitted)); Crews v. Virginia, No. 1:16cv407(JCC/JFA), 2016 WL 4705143, at
*3 (E.D. Va. Sept. 8, 2016) (“Plaintiff’s prior ‘Amended Complaint’ has been superseded and
effectively nullified by the subsequent filing of his Second Amended Complaint.”).
In addition, Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ opposition to their Rule 20 and 21
motion reveal an intent to challenge policy — simply because the opposition notes that both
operations were handled by ICE’s Washington Field Office and cites certain cases that involved
challenges to governmental or corporate action, see Reply in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. to Sever at 7–
8 — is meritless. These facts and cases were cited solely for the purpose of demonstrating why
joinder of the Arlington Plaintiffs and their claims was appropriate; Plaintiffs did not make any
arguments in their opposition concerning the constitutionality of immigration enforcement
policies, patterns, or practices attributable to any government entity. See generally Pls.’ Mem. in
Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. to Sever. In any event, because Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendants’ Rule
20 and 21 motion was neither attached to nor incorporated in the amended complaint, this Court
is not permitted to consider the sufficiency of any arguments made in such opposition for the
purposes of deciding Defendants’ motion to dismiss. See E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 637
F.3d at 448. Accordingly, Defendants’ contention that the allegations in Plaintiffs’ original
complaint and arguments in Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendants’ Rule 20 and 21 motion bar
Plaintiffs’ Bivens claims is entirely without foundation. Lest there be any doubt, Plaintiffs affirm
that they are not challenging or seeking any relief regarding any Executive or Legislative policy.

22

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 32 of 47 PageID# 461

Defendants’ cautionary statements about the administrability of granting Plaintiffs the
relief they do seek are similarly unfounded. Defendants assert that inferring a damages remedy
in the circumstances presented by this case will “slow down the streamlined removal process that
Congress has established,” “open the floodgates of litigation against ICE officials enforcing
immigration laws,” and “impose an intolerable administrative burden on the immigration
enforcement system.” Defs.’ Mem. at 23–24 (quoting Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 447 (2d
Cir. 2008)). Yet Defendants have presented no evidence in support of these speculative
concerns. Indeed, eight Plaintiffs’ removal proceedings continue unabated. The same
administrability challenges alleged by Defendants are inherent in any Bivens action, and yet the
Supreme Court in Abbasi reaffirmed the vitality — indeed, the necessity — of Bivens actions in
the search-and-seizure context. See 137 S. Ct. at 1856.
Finally, Defendants complain that Plaintiffs’ suit “may force the Government to decide
between on the one hand pursuing immigration removal proceedings against unlawfully present
aliens, or on the other, forcing line-level ICE officials who face potential personal liability to
effectively forego their entitlement to a qualified immunity defense by subjecting them to crossexamination in an evidentiary hearing,” without the aid of their personal attorneys. Defs.’ Mem.
at 25–26. While Plaintiffs vigorously deny the availability of qualified immunity as a defense
here, see infra Section III at 24–36, Defendants of course may attempt to invoke such protection.
Indeed, Defendants have done just that in their motion. See Defs.’ Mem. at 27–32. The risk
associated with pursuing immunity versus testifying at a removal hearing is a risk implicit in
Bivens, which remains good law in the search-and-seizure context. See Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at
1856. Furthermore, this is the risk that any agent runs any time she testifies, because a plaintiff
can always file a Bivens suit after the testimony is given, and there is ample time within which to

23

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 33 of 47 PageID# 462

file such a suit. See Bloch v. Exec. Office of the President, 164 F. Supp. 3d 841, 860 n.27 (E.D.
Va. 2016) (noting that Bivens actions arising in Virginia are subject to a two-year statute of
limitations). As for Defendants’ alleged representational concerns, these too are without basis.
Defendants are entitled to request government counsel in connection with their potential
testimony in Plaintiffs’ removal proceedings. See 28 C.F.R. § 50.15(a)(1)-(3). Whether or not
this case proceeds has no bearing on whether or not Defendants will be called to testify in the
removal proceedings.
Accordingly, should this Court determine that Plaintiffs’ case presents an extension of
Bivens, the foregoing reasons demonstrate that special factors do not counsel in favor of
withholding a Bivens remedy from Plaintiffs.
III.

Defendants Are Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity.
The Defendant ICE Agents are not entitled to qualified immunity because the amended

complaint alleges that they violated Plaintiffs’ clearly established Fourth and Fifth Amendment
rights. Qualified immunity protects government officials from civil damages liability to the
extent “their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights within
the knowledge of a reasonable person.” Danser v. Stansberry, 772 F.3d 340, 345 (4th Cir. 2014)
(citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). Government officials are entitled to
qualified immunity with respect to “‘discretionary functions’ performed in their official
capacities.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1866 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638
(1987)). Because “a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his
conduct,” Harlow, 457 U.S. at 819, qualified immunity is designed only to protect law
enforcement officers from “bad guesses in gray areas,” Raub v. Campbell, 785 F.3d 876, 881
(4th Cir. 2015) (quoting S.P. v. City of Takoma Park, 134 F.3d 260, 266 (4th Cir. 1998)). Public

24

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 34 of 47 PageID# 463

officials are liable “for transgressing bright lines.” Id. (quoting S.P., 134 F.3d at 266) (internal
quotation mark omitted).
A qualified immunity defense requires two components. First, the Court must consider
whether the facts alleged, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, “show the officer’s
conduct violated a constitutional right.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). Second, the
Court must consider “whether the [constitutional] right was clearly established” at the time of
violation. Id. Plaintiffs bear the burden of proof to plead facts sufficient to establish a
constitutional violation, whereas Defendants bear the burden of proof with respect to whether the
right at issue was clearly established at the time of the violation. Henry v. Purnell, 501 F.3d 374,
377–78 (4th Cir. 2007). The court may consider the two prongs in any order. Pearson v.
Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009).
The Court should deny Defendants’ request for qualified immunity because the amended
complaint demonstrates that each Defendant personally violated Plaintiffs’ clearly established
Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.
A. Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that each individual Defendant ICE agent personally
participated in the violations of Plaintiffs’ clearly established Fourth and Fifth
Amendment rights.
Defendants assert in their motion to dismiss that the Arlington Plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fifth
Amendment claims fail because the amended complaint does not allege which Defendants, and
how each Defendant, personally participated in the February 8 incident. To sufficiently plead a
Bivens claim, “a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the
official’s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,
676 (2009). Plaintiffs’ amended complaint clearly alleges that each Defendant ICE agent
personally participated in the violations of Plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights,
regardless of Defendants’ passing assertions otherwise.
25

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 35 of 47 PageID# 464

Defendants’ attempted parsing of the amended complaint ignores the overarching
allegations made in it: the same team of Defendant ICE agents committed the same
constitutional violations within a nine-day period under essentially the same circumstances. See
Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 18. 6 Plaintiffs brought claims against the five specific agents whose names
appeared on the I-213 Forms of Mr. Tun-Cos, Mr. Pajarito Saput, and another individual arrested
along with these Plaintiffs in the February 17 incident. Plaintiffs allege that all of these
Defendants participated in the February 8 incident as well. See id. ¶ 18. Defendants’ argument
that the amended complaint fails to allege participation by all Defendants therefore is without
merit.
Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs are required to allege the specific actions undertaken
by each Defendant is similarly misguided. Courts have allowed Bivens claims to proceed where
plaintiffs have had no way of attributing actions to specific defendants before discovery. See
Mancha v. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 1:06-CV-2650-TWT, 2009 WL 900800, at *1
(N.D. Ga. Mar. 31, 2009). In Mancha, plaintiffs — United States citizens caught up in an
immigration enforcement action — sued ICE and numerous individual agents for intentional
torts and constitutional violations committed while conducting a series of immigration raids at a
poultry plant in Georgia. Id. The United States argued for dismissal of the Bivens claims
because “for many allegations, the Plaintiffs fail[ed] to specifically identify which agent was
responsible.” Id. at *5. The court denied the motion to dismiss because for “most of the

6

Defendants made similar arguments in their motion to sever, which have already been rejected
by this Court in its denial of that motion. See Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. to Sever at 6 (“The
newly added Plaintiffs’ claims arise out of an alleged occurrence on February 8 in Arlington,
over one week before, in a different city, involving different Plaintiffs, and with a different
number (and thus composition) of Defendants than the occurrence that gave rise to the original
Plaintiffs’ complaint, which arose out of an incident that occurred in Annandale on February
17.”).
26

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 36 of 47 PageID# 465

allegations, ‘the complaint can be fairly read to aver that all defendants are responsible for the
alleged conduct.’” Id. at *6 (quoting Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944 (11th Cir. 2000)).
For example, the court noted that requiring “Plaintiffs [to] specifically indicate how each
Defendant is responsible for each allegation at this point in the litigation is not necessary”
because “‘[m]ore specificity can be developed as the case proceeds.’” Id. (quoting Kyle K., 208
F.3d at 944). Plaintiffs have alleged that each Defendant personally participated in both
incidents; further specificity is not required at this stage of the case.
The cases Defendants rely on do nothing to bolster their argument. For example,
Defendants cite Robbins v. Oklahoma for the proposition that plaintiffs bringing constitutional
claims against government actors must plead the actions of each individual defendant with
specificity. 519 F.3d 1242, 1250 (10th Cir. 2008). The court in Robbins, however, was
emphasizing the need to distinguish between individual claims and claims against government
agencies: “[t]herefore it is particularly important in such circumstances that the complaint make
clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each individual with fair
notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective
allegations against the state.” Id. Robbins’ concerns are inapplicable here, because Plaintiffs are
bringing claims only against individual defendants. In Raub v. Bowen, the Court dismissed a
false imprisonment claim brought against “one or more Defendants” because no defendant
“[could] be expected to know whether that claim includes him or her.” 960 F. Supp. 2d 602, 616
(E.D. Va. 2013). Here, Plaintiffs include all Defendants in all claims brought in the amended
complaint, so each Defendant is on notice that he is included in each claim. Other cases to which
Defendants cite are similarly distinguishable. See, e.g., Bryson v. Gonzales, 534 F.3d 1282, 1290
(10th Cir. 2008) (relying on Robbins to dismiss claims against police chief where generic claims

27

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 37 of 47 PageID# 466

made it impossible to distinguish between allegations directed at the chief and allegations
directed at the city); Marcantonio v. Dudzinski, 155 F. Supp. 3d 619, 627 (W.D. Va. 2015)
(dismissing claims stemming from alleged hazing event against one defendant where plaintiff
failed to allege defendant was even present on the night in question).
B. Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.
Defendants stopped and seized Plaintiffs and invaded their homes because Plaintiffs
appeared to be of Latino race or ethnicity. The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches
and seizures.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. It is designed to “prevent arbitrary and oppressive
interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.”
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554 (1976). These protections apply equally
with respect to aliens present in the United States and citizens. See supra Section II.B.1 at 18–
19. Defendant ICE agents violated Plaintiffs’ clearly established Fourth Amendment rights
when they arbitrarily seized them and invaded their homes based on their perceived race or
ethnicity.
1. Defendants unreasonably seized Plaintiffs in violation of the Fourth
Amendment when they detained Plaintiffs without reasonable, articulable
suspicion of unlawful activity.
Defendant ICE agents seized Plaintiffs with no reasonable, articulable suspicion of
wrongdoing and no plausible explanation except Plaintiffs’ race, ethnicity, or perceived national
origin. Law enforcement officials “may initiate a brief investigatory stop if the officer has
reasonable suspicion to believe that ‘criminal activity may be afoot.’” United States v. Griffin,
589 F.3d 148, 152 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968)). To initiate an
investigatory stop, law enforcement officials need “a particularized and objective basis for
suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.” United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S.
28

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 38 of 47 PageID# 467

411, 417–18 (1981). “[T]his demand for specificity in the information upon which police action
is predicated is the central teaching of [the Supreme] Court’s Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence.” Id. at 418 (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21 n.18). Defendants’ warrantless
seizures of Plaintiffs was unreasonable and lacked any articulable suspicion.
Defendants claim, without any proof, that the rationale for their investigatory stop was a
search for the Houx-Hernández brothers and Santo Del Cid. See Defs.’ Mem. at 30. Defendants
could potentially establish reasonable suspicion if they could demonstrate that any of the
Plaintiffs “closely resembled” the images of the Houx-Hernández brothers or Mr. Del Cid. See
United States v. Williams, No. 2:09cr149, 2010 WL 452200, at *5 n.2 (E.D. Va. Feb. 8, 2010).
In Williams, the court found that an officer had “sufficient basis to stop the defendant’s vehicle”
where the officer used a photograph to “visually verif[y] that the suspect singled out by the
tipster was in fact [the defendant].” Id. at *4–5. The court found reasonable suspicion based on
a totality of the circumstances, including a corroborated anonymous tip with matching location,
clothing, and vehicle descriptions, in addition to the photograph identification. Id.
Here, however, the allegations in the complaint show that Defendants lack the totality of
circumstances evident in Williams because the photographs of the Houx-Hernández brothers and
Mr. Del Cid were mere pretext. Defendants’ actions reveal a pattern of intentional misconduct:
they approached both residences merely on the purported basis of a photograph and general
location, with no further corroboration or reasonable suspicion of Plaintiffs. No Plaintiff looks
anything like the men in the photographs, which shows that the photographs were a mere pretext
for the unconstitutional stops. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 54, 64. Furthermore, Defendants only showed the
photograph of Mr. Del Cid to some of the Arlington Plaintiffs, and even then only briefly, further
evidence that the photograph was a mere pretext for the unlawful search. Id. ¶¶ 21, 26, 35, 74.

29

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 39 of 47 PageID# 468

If the general location of Arlington or Fairmont Gardens was enough to establish a lawful basis
for a seizure, ICE agents could have detained every adult male in the neighborhood, or at least
every adult male of apparent Latino race and ethnicity, which would be clearly unconstitutional.
Accordingly, Defendants lacked reasonable suspicion to seize Plaintiffs.
2. Even if Defendants had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Plaintiffs
committed unlawful activity, the intensive and prolonged nature of their
detention violated the Fourth Amendment.
Even if Defendants had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of unlawful conduct by
Plaintiffs such that the Terry stop was constitutional (they did not), the seizure was not
sufficiently limited to the scope and duration that would have been adequate to confirm or dispel
any reasonable suspicions. Investigative stops must be “sufficiently limited in scope and
duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.” Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491,
500 (1983) (plurality opinion). The scope of law enforcement’s investigative methods “should
be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer’s suspicion in a
short period of time.” Id. With regards to duration, a stop may become “unlawful if it is
prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete [the officer’s] mission.” Illinois v.
Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005). An officer “must possess a justification” for prolonging a
stop beyond a routine stop “other than the initial [justification] that prompted the stop in the first
place.” United States v. Branch, 537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir. 2008). Such an expansion of scope
requires “either [] consent or a ‘reasonable suspicion’ that illegal activity is afoot.” Id.
Even if, arguendo, the photographs justified the initial stop, the scope of Defendants’
investigatory stop should have been limited to a quick look at Plaintiffs as they were leaving

30

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 40 of 47 PageID# 469

their residences to discern that they were not the Houx-Hernández brothers or Mr. Del Cid. 7
Detaining and questioning Plaintiffs was wholly unnecessary for this purpose. See United States
v. De La Cruz, 703 F.3d 1193, 1196–97 (10th Cir. 2013) (citing Royer, 460 U.S. at 500). In De
La Cruz, the court held that there was no reasonable suspicion to seize the defendant when the
person who was the target of the ICE investigation differed in age and physical features from the
plaintiff. Id. With respect to the Annandale Plaintiffs, similarly, the Houx-Hernández brothers
are in their mid-20s, while the relevant Plaintiffs and their companions are in their late-30s to
40s. Am. Compl. ¶ 64. In addition, none of the Arlington Plaintiffs resembled Mr. Del Cid. Id.
¶ 54. To be sure, Plaintiffs, the Houx-Hernández brothers, and Mr. Del Cid are all Latino adult
males, but the Fourth Amendment prohibits law enforcement from acting solely based on race or
ethnicity. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. at 886.
Defendants mistakenly rely on Brignoni-Ponce to justify expanding the scope of an
investigatory stop. See Defs.’ Mem. at 31. The “absence of practical alternatives for policing
the [Mexican] border” weighed heavily on the Court’s reasoning in Brignoni-Ponce, and the
Court limited its holding to [Mexican] border areas. 422 U.S. at 881. The Court noted also that,
even within those areas, the Fourth Amendment “forbids stopping or detaining persons for
questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they may be aliens.”
Id. at 881, 884. Here, Defendants lacked reasonable suspicion to prolong the seizures beyond the
brief time necessary to compare Plaintiffs to photographs of the individuals for whom

7

Defendants allege that they could not properly see the Plaintiffs at Fairmont Gardens because
the stop occurred “roughly thirty minutes before sunrise.” Defs.’ Mem. at 30. In fact, dawn
began breaking approximately one hour before the seizure, and Plaintiffs were accosted by
Defendants a mere five minutes before the start of civil twilight, the brightest of the three stages
of twilight. Am. Compl. at n.2.
31

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 41 of 47 PageID# 470

Defendants purportedly were looking. Defendants therefore violated Plaintiffs’ Fourth
Amendment rights.
3. Defendants’ warrantless search of Plaintiffs’ residences without consent
constituted an additional violation of the Fourth Amendment.
In entering and searching Plaintiffs’ residences, Defendants violated “a ‘basic principle of
Fourth Amendment law[,]’ that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are
presumptively unreasonable.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980). Although consent
is an exception to the warrant requirement, consent is determined from the totality of the
circumstances, must be voluntarily given, and may not be the result of “duress or coercion.”
Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248 (1973). A totality of the circumstances
examination includes “characteristics of the accused (such as age, maturity, education,
intelligence, and experience) and the conditions under which the consent to search was given
(such as the officer’s conduct, the number of officers present, and the duration of the
encounter).” United States v. Boone, 245 F.3d 352, 361–62 (4th Cir. 2001). “Whether the
individual searched was informed of his right to decline the search is a ‘highly relevant’ factor.”
United States v. Robertson, 736 F.3d 677, 680 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. Wilson,
895 F.2d 168, 172 (4th Cir. 1990)).
Defendants failed to gain Plaintiffs’ consent when they demanded entry into their
residences and executed warrantless searches. At both residences, numerous armed Defendant
ICE agents identifying themselves as “police” commanded Plaintiffs to allow access to their
residences and failed to inform Plaintiffs of their right to decline consent. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 22–23,
62. Mr. Germán Velasquez Perdomo protested the early hour of the raid but felt compelled to
obey as Defendants followed him closely to his door and ordered it open. Id. ¶¶ 22–23.
Defendants marched Mr. Pajarito Saput to his door and instructed he open it, and he likewise felt
32

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 42 of 47 PageID# 471

compelled to obey. Id. ¶ 62. Defendants primarily spoke to Mr. Pajarito Saput in English,
despite his limited facility with the language. Id. ¶ 58. In the Arlington incident, Defendants
expanded their illegal search as they barged through each floor of Mr. Cárcamo’s residence. Id.
¶¶ 25–43. The totality of the circumstances clearly demonstrate that Plaintiffs did not in any way
consent to Defendants’ warrantless entry and subsequent search of their residence.
4. Defendants’ unreasonable search and seizure of Plaintiffs violated their
clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.
A right is clearly established where “it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his
conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.” Goines v. Valley Cmty. Servs. Bd., 822
F.3d 159, 170 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202) (internal quotation mark
omitted). “[T]he exact conduct at issue need not to have been held to be unlawful in order for
the law governing an officer’s actions to be clearly established”; however, the existing authority
must make the unlawfulness apparent. Wilson v. Layne, 141 F.3d 111, 114 (4th Cir. 1998). “The
law is clearly established such that an officer’s conduct transgresses a bright line when the law
has ‘been authoritatively decided by the Supreme Court, the appropriate United States Court of
Appeals, or the highest court of the state.’” Id. (quoting Wallace v. King, 626 F.2d 1157, 1161
(4th Cir. 1980)).
A reasonable ICE agent would have known that case law clearly established the
unconstitutionality of seizing Plaintiffs and searching their residences in the absence of a
reasonable, articulable basis for a belief that Plaintiffs were engaged in criminal activity. The
Supreme Court has long held that “[a]n investigatory stop must be justified by some objective
manifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.” Cortez,
449 U.S. at 417. Seizing and detaining Plaintiffs absent reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing
violates clearly established law. Furthermore, the Constitution’s prohibition against warrantless
33

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 43 of 47 PageID# 472

searches of the home is a cornerstone of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Groh v.
Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 564 (2004) (“No reasonable officer could claim to be unaware of the
basic rule, well established by our cases, that, absent consent or exigency, a warrantless search of
the home is presumptively unconstitutional.”). A reasonable ICE agent would have known that a
warrantless search without consent or exigent circumstances violated clearly established Fourth
Amendment rights.
Similarly, a reasonable ICE agent would have known that case law clearly established the
unconstitutionality of a seizure and search based on Plaintiffs’ Latino ethnicity alone.
Defendants had over 40 years’ notice that the Constitution does not permit race-based
investigatory stops. The Supreme Court declared in 1975, “[e]ven if [the authorities] saw
enough to think that the occupants were of Mexican descent, this factor alone would justify
neither a reasonable belief that they were [noncitizens], nor a reasonable belief that the car
concealed other [noncitizens] who were illegally in the country.” Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. at
886. Notice of Plaintiffs’ clearly established right to be free of Fourth Amendment violations
based solely on race has been reiterated on numerous occasions. See United States v. Sundiata, 3
F. Supp. 2d 682, 686 (E.D. Va 1998) (“[R]ace is not a proper basis for an investigatory
stop . . . .”); see also Sanchez v. Sessions, 870 F.3d 901, 911 (9th Cir. 2017) (finding a seizure in
violation of the Fourth Amendment when “officers did not have any information other than [the
petitioner’s] Latino ethnicity when they initially seized him on suspicion of being an
‘undocumented worker[] alien[]’” (alterations in original)). Plaintiffs’ right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures is clearly established by the Fourth Amendment, and
Defendants violated this clearly established right.

C. Defendants denied Plaintiffs equal protection under the law in violation of the
Fifth Amendment by targeting them solely based on their race, ethnicity, or
perceived national origin.
Defendants characterize Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim as one of selective
prosecution. They are wrong. Plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection under the law were violated
well before their arrest, when Defendants targeted, questioned, and seized them based solely on
their race, ethnicity, or perceived national origin. The equal protection component of the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits “denying to any person the equal protection of
the laws.” United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2695 (2013) (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347
U.S. 497, 499–500 (1954)). In alleging their equal protection claim, Plaintiffs must “at a
minimum be able to show that [they] were treated differently because of [their] race.” Pena v.
Porter, 316 F. App’x 303, 316 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing Farm Labor Org. v. Ohio State Highway
Patrol, 308 F.3d 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2002)).
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs were targeted because, as apparent adult Latino males,
they fit the description of the “suspected criminal aliens” for whom Defendants purportedly were
searching. Defs.’ Mem. at 36. While the Supreme Court has acknowledged that “apparent
Mexican ancestry” can be a relevant factor in the determination of reasonable suspicion in border
areas, see Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. at 885, an individual’s apparent race, ethnicity, or national
origin is not sufficient on its own to establish reasonable suspicion. See id. at 885–86; DiazBernal, 758 F. Supp. 2d at 135 (“Brignoni-Ponce actually stands for the proposition contrary to
the defendants’ assertion: if the defendants searched, detained, and arrested the plaintiffs solely
on the basis of race or national origin, they have violated clearly established constitutional
rights.”).
Defendants’ assertion that their actions were justified by the alleged searches for Mr. Del
Cid and the Houx-Hernández brothers could perhaps justify an initial, brief investigatory stop if
35

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 44 Filed 01/16/18 Page 45 of 47 PageID# 474

any of the Plaintiffs closely resembled the suspects. See supra Section III.B.2 at 30–31. They
did not. Plaintiffs shared nothing more than perceived race, ethnicity, or national origin with the
figures in the ICE agents’ photographs. Id. at 31. Defendants did not even show the
photographs to all of the Arlington Plaintiffs, proof that the photographs and the alleged search
for the suspects were a mere pretext to stop, question, and seize Plaintiffs. Am. Compl. ¶ 74. As
alleged, Defendants’ sole motivation for targeting Plaintiffs was their apparent race, ethnicity, or
national origin, falling short of the reasonable suspicion needed to justify their actions. See
United States v. Moreno-Chaparro, 180 F.3d 629, 631 (5th Cir. 1999); Diaz-Bernal, 758 F.
Supp. 2d at 135. Indeed, one Defendant even went so far as to ask Mr. Cárcamo if there were
“other Spanish families” living in the neighborhood, compelling evidence that Defendants’
actions in Arlington and Fairmont Gardens were driven by Plaintiffs’ perceived Latino identity.
Am. Compl. ¶ 46.
It is clearly established that law enforcement officials cannot target individuals for
investigation solely on the basis of race or ethnic origin. See, e.g., Diaz-Bernal, 758 F. Supp. 2d
at 135 (“[I]f the defendants searched, detained, and arrested the plaintiffs solely on the basis of
race or national origin, they have violated clearly established constitutional rights.”). Plaintiffs’
amended complaint sufficiently alleges that Defendants targeted Plaintiffs solely because of their
apparent race, ethnicity, or national origin, a clear violation of their Fifth Amendment rights.
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ attempt to prevent Plaintiffs from asserting claims to redress violations of
their constitutional rights is unpersuasive and contrary to precedent. Shutting the courtroom door
to claims such as those asserted by Plaintiffs would allow ICE agents to operate wholly outside
constitutional bounds. Accordingly, this Court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.
