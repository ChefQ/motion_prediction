Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 9 of 47 PageID# 332

INTRODUCTION
This case is about two routine immigration enforcement operations that Plaintiffs are
attempting to leverage to alter what they perceive to be certain aspects of the United States’
current immigration enforcement policy. Their attempt comes through a personal liability lawsuit
raising Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims directly against the line-level United States
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers Plaintiffs claim conducted the operations.
Put simply, this individual-capacity lawsuit is not an appropriate avenue to remedy the
constitutional challenges levied. Congress has removed this Court’s jurisdiction over lawsuits
such as this one, which, in addition to attempting to alter Executive Branch policy, threaten both
to slow down the immigration removal process Congress has established, and to offer aliens in
such proceedings two separate tracks to challenge immigration officials’ actions rather than the
single channel of review provided by statute. Congress clearly does not want either outcome.
Moreover, the Supreme Court recently emphasized that personal-liability lawsuits are not the
appropriate method for challenging Executive Branch policy. Additionally, numerous other
special factors counsel hesitation in the immigration-enforcement context. Regardless,
Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because Plaintiffs have not properly alleged that
any of the Defendants personally participated in the violation of a clearly established
constitutional right. In short, this Court should dismiss their suit.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND 1
A. The Original Complaint and Motion to Dismiss.
Plaintiffs Mynor Tun-Cos and José Saput (the “original Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in

For the limited purposes of this motion to dismiss, the Court may assume the veracity only of
well-pled factual allegations in the complaint. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 10 of 47 PageID# 333

which they alleged that at approximately 6:25 a.m. on February 17, 2017, they, along with one
other unnamed individual, left their apartment in Fairmont Oaks, an apartment complex in
Annandale, VA, that has been the site of numerous immigration enforcement operations over the
last decade. See Dkt. #1, Compl., ¶¶ 18, 20. The apartment Plaintiffs left had been occupied by
two brothers—the Houx-Hernández brothers—who “were in trouble with the police” and for
whom ICE was searching. Id. ¶ 28. Plaintiffs and a fourth unnamed individual entered their
vehicle, which was parked in the complex’s parking lot, and began to pull out of their parking
space. Id. ¶¶ 20-21. An SUV then prevented Plaintiffs’ vehicle from leaving the parking area,
and ICE officials, who got out of the SUV, asked Plaintiffs and the other occupants for
identification. Id. ¶ 21-22, 25. Plaintiffs provided some form of identification, but one of the
other occupants could not. Id. ¶ 25.
Plaintiffs and Defendants then returned to Plaintiffs’ apartment, where Defendants
showed Plaintiff Tun-Cos a photograph of the Houx-Hernández brothers and asked him if he
knew them. Id. ¶ 28. Tun-Cos admitted they had lived in his apartment in the past, but stated
they did not currently live there. Id. Defendants then arrested Plaintiffs, transported them to an
ICE facility, and released them towards the end of the day. Id. ¶¶ 30, 32. Plaintiffs alleged that
the Defendants targeted them solely because of their “apparent race, ethnicity, or perceived
national origin.” Id. ¶ 38.
Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs brought two claims against Defendants under
Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971): one
for alleged violation of their Fourth Amendment rights during the initial encounter and the later
questioning; and one for alleged violation of their Fifth Amendment equal protection rights. Id.
¶¶ 33-43.

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 11 of 47 PageID# 334

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the original Plaintiffs’ complaint under Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), Dkt. #19, raising three independent threshold
defenses. First, under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the REAL ID
Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302 (2005), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq., this Court lacks
jurisdiction over those claims because the INA channels constitutional challenges such as those
of the original Plaintiffs (who are in removal proceedings) through the immigration courts and
the courts of appeals. See Dkt. #20 at 3-8. Second, under Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit
precedent, this Court should not imply a damages remedy for the original Plaintiffs in this new
context because numerous special factors counsel hesitation. See id. at 8-23 (citing, e.g., Ziglar v.
Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843 (2017)). Third, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because
the original Plaintiffs failed to plead facts demonstrating the violation of a clearly established
constitutional right. See id. at 23-30.
B. The First Amended Complaint, which raises claims regarding seven separate
plaintiffs, a separate incident, and not an identical group of defendants.
The original Plaintiffs then amended their complaint. See Dkt. #25, First Am. Compl.
(FAC). The FAC included the following newly added Plaintiffs: Luis Velasquez Perdomo, Pedro
Velasquez Perdomo, Germán Velasquez Perdomo, Eder Aguilar Aritas, Eduardo Montano
Fernández, Nelson Callejas Peña, and José Cárcamo (the “newly added Plaintiffs”), none of
whom raise allegations regarding the events of February 17, 2017. Instead, the allegations of the
newly added Plaintiffs wholly involve an alleged ICE operation on February 8, 2017, in
Arlington, Virginia, at the house of one José Carcámo. See id. ¶¶ 10, 19-24.
The newly added Plaintiffs allege that “four Defendants”—without specifying which
four—approached Germán Perdomo, one of the newly added Plaintiffs, at approximately 5:40

3

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 12 of 47 PageID# 335

a.m. on the morning of February 8, 2017, in front of a house in Arlington, and asked whether he
knew of one “Santo Del Cid,” and showed him a photocopy of a photograph of Del Cid. Id. ¶ 21.
After inquiring about the inhabitants of the house and gaining entrance, unspecified
“Defendants” searched rooms throughout the house while looking for Del Cid. Id. at ¶¶ 25-45.
According to the FAC, at times during this search, certain unspecified “Defendants” had various
interactions with some of the newly added Plaintiffs or other inhabitants of the house. Id. ¶¶ 29,
32, 36, 46, 47. With the exception of Germán Perdomo, all the newly added Plaintiffs were
found inside of the house. Id. All the newly added Plaintiffs except for Cárcamo were arrested by
the “Defendants,” transported to an ICE facility in Virginia, and were released later that day. Id.
at ¶¶ 49-51. The FAC alleges that numerous other female inhabitants encountered in the house
were not questioned or arrested. Id. ¶¶ 32, 36, 39, 42.
The FAC does not contain any factually substantive changes to the allegations in the
original complaint regarding the February 17, 2017, ICE operation. Rather, it solely removes
references to the “Trump Administration’s” purported immigration enforcement policy, compare
Dkt. #1, Compl. ¶¶ 5, 15, with Dkt. #25, FAC, ¶¶ 1-5, and adds general allegations regarding the
ethnic composition of Annandale. See Dkt. #25, Am. Compl., ¶ 71. Both the original Plaintiffs
and the newly added Plaintiffs bring two claims under Bivens: one for purported violation of
their Fourth Amendment rights, and one for purported violation of their equal protection rights
under the Fifth Amendment. See FAC at 17-20. Under a modified scheduling order, Defendants’
motion to dismiss the FAC is currently due two weeks after representation was authorized for
Defendants on the newly added claims. See Dkt. #27. 2

On December 17, 2017, the Department of Justice authorized representation for the Defendants
with respect to the newly added Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the incident on February 8.

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 13 of 47 PageID# 336

Defendants now move to dismiss all of the Plaintiffs’ claims in the FAC under largely the
same grounds raised in their motion to dismiss the original complaint. Namely, the INA removes
this Court’s jurisdiction over those claims as to all Plaintiffs except for Cárcamo (who was not
arrested and is not in removal proceedings); under Supreme Court, Fourth Circuit, and other
circuit court precedent, multiple special factors counsel hesitation in this context as to all the
Plaintiffs’ claims; and Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on all the claims.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Defendants raise arguments under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and
12(b)(6). When a defendant “challenges the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact, the
plaintiff bears the burden of proving the truth of such facts by a preponderance of the evidence.”
U.S. ex rel. Vuyyuru v. Jadhav, 555 F.3d 337, 347 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing Adams v. Bain, 697
F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir.1982)). “Unless ‘the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the facts
central to the merits of the dispute,’ the district court may then go beyond the allegations of the
complaint and resolve the jurisdictional facts in dispute by considering evidence outside the
pleadings . . . .” Vuyyuru, 555 F.3d at 348 (quoting Adams, 697 F.2d at 1219).
When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court ignores non-factual
content, such as “labels and conclusions,” or a “formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of
action.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The court then
assumes the truth of well-pled factual allegations and determines whether those factual
allegations plausibly state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
ARGUMENT
This Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for three independent reasons. First, the INA
removes this Court’s jurisdiction over those claims (with the exception of Cárcamo’s) and
5

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 14 of 47 PageID# 337

channels review through the immigration courts and the federal courts of appeals. Second, this
Court should not imply the non-statutory remedy Plaintiffs seek where, as here, multiple special
factors counsel hesitation in this new context. Third, Defendants are entitled to qualified
immunity because Plaintiffs have failed adequately to allege any Defendant personally
participated in the violation of any clearly established constitutional right.
I.

The INA Removes This Court’s Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims. 3
Under § 242(b)(9) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), this Court lacks jurisdiction to

consider Plaintiffs’ claims, which must instead be raised either in immigration court or before the
Fourth Circuit in a petition for review. Congress, through the INA, intended to streamline the
removal process and to prevent the sort of piecemeal litigation and parallel proceedings in which
the Plaintiffs—two of whom have already raised their constitutional claims both in this suit and
in their removal proceedings—are currently engaged. It enacted a specific provision to channel
claims such as Plaintiffs’ to the federal courts of appeals. Thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction here.
A. Congress, through the INA, aimed to streamline the removal process and to
prevent piecemeal litigation.
Congress has added and amended several sections of the INA over the past decades to
streamline the removal process and to ensure that piecemeal litigation, which often arose in
removal proceedings before those amendments, came to an end. For example, in 1996, Congress
passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104208, 110 Stat. 3546 (1996), which contained provisions reiterating that only courts of appeals,
not district courts, could review final orders of removal, and that review of a final order of
removal was the only method by which to review any issue raised in a removal proceeding. See
This argument is not raised as to Plaintiff Cárcamo, who was not arrested or placed in removal
proceedings.

H.R. Conf. Rep. 109-72, 173 (2005). Such provisions “were intended to preclude all district
court review of any issue raised in a removal proceeding.” Id. Congress again amended the INA
in 2005 through the REAL ID Act, and again aimed to end the “piecemeal review, uncertainty,
lack of uniformity, and . . . waste of resources both for the judicial branch and Government
lawyers” that persisted through judicial review in both district courts and courts of appeals. Id. at
174. See also Aguilar v. ICE, 510 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. 109-72).
B. In 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), Congress streamlined the removal process, precluding
the review sought in this lawsuit.
In 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), Congress provided that “[j]udicial review of all questions of
law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,
arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States . .
. shall be available only in judicial review of a final order . . . .” Section 1252(b)(9) is an
“unmistakable ‘zipper’ clause.” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483
(1999) (“AADC”). Congress’s purpose in enacting this clause “is evident.” Aguilar, 510 F.3d at
9. It is meant “to consolidate and channel review of all legal and factual questions that arise from
the removal of an alien into the administrative process.” Id.
Under that process, the sole avenue of judicial review is through the courts of appeals. As
§ 1252(a)(5) adds, “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be
the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal . . . .” Combined with
§ 1252(a)(5), the zipper clause of § 1252(b)(9) means that “any issue—whether legal or
factual—arising from any removal-related activity can be reviewed only” through a petition for
review before a court of appeals. J.E. F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2016). These
provisions “effectively limit all aliens to one bite of the apple with regard to challenging an order

7

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 16 of 47 PageID# 339

of removal.” Bonhometre v. Gonzales, 414 F.3d 442, 446 (3d Cir. 2005). See also Aguilar, 510
F.3d at 9 (“In enacting section 1252(b)(9), Congress plainly intended to put an end to the
scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process that previously had held sway in regard to
removal proceedings.” (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-72)).
Section 1252(b)(9)’s “expanse is breathtaking.” Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9. As the First and
Ninth Circuits have held, it applies to all claims that arise from either an action or proceeding
brought in connection with the removal of an alien, except for claims that are “independent of, or
wholly collateral to, the removal process.” Id. at 11. See also J.E. F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032.
Although the precise contours of which claims are “independent” or “wholly collateral” is
unsettled, the case law makes clear that claims that commonly arise in the context of removal
proceedings fall within the ambit of § 1252(b)(9). See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 13 (“The frequency
with which right-to-counsel claims arise in removal proceedings refutes any notion that such
claims are sufficiently separate from removal proceedings to be considered either ‘independent’
or ‘collateral.’”); J.E. F.M., 837 F.3d at 1033 (applying § 1252(b)(9) to right-of-counsel claims
because they “are routinely raised in petitions for review filed with a federal court of appeals”). 4
Along those lines, aliens cannot “escape the vise-like grip of section 1252(b)(9)” by
simply refusing to bring claims in immigration court and in petitions for review when those
claims could have been brought. Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9. Applying the statute otherwise would
herald “an obvious loss of efficiency and bifurcation of review mechanisms,” which “are among
the principal evils that Congress sought to avoid through the passage of section 1252(b)(9).” Id.

The Fourth Circuit has not addressed the scope of § 1252(b)(9). Two other circuits have
interpreted § 1252(b)(9) more narrowly as applying only to review of a removal order. See
Chehazeh v. Att’y Gen., 666 F.3d 118, 131-33 (3d Cir. 2012); Madu v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 470 F.3d
1362, 1367 (11th Cir. 2006).
4

8

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 17 of 47 PageID# 340

at 10. Nor does it matter that certain actions that are challenged occurred before removal
proceedings began. As the Aguilar court explained, applying the statute only to claims that arise
from ongoing removal proceedings “would put an undue premium on which party rushed to the
courthouse first.” Id. “More importantly,” the First Circuit continued, “such a reading would
render the word ‘action’ superfluous and effectively excise it from the statute.” Id.
C. Section 1252(b)(9) bars Plaintiffs’ claims, some of which have already been
raised in removal proceedings.
As the above explanation of § 1252(b)(9) makes clear, that provision applies to Plaintiffs’
claims under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Two reasons support this conclusion. First,
Plaintiffs’ claims for alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment and their equal protection
rights are commonplace in removal proceedings. See, e.g., Yanez-Marquez v. Lynch, 789 F.3d
434, 445-51 (4th Cir. 2015) (discussing the standard for suppression of evidence in immigration
removal proceedings for Fourth Amendment violations); Malik v. Gonzales, 213 F. App’x 173,
174 (4th Cir. 2007) (considering equal protection claims in context of removal proceedings).
Therefore, those claims are not “independent” or “wholly collateral” from removal proceedings.
Indeed, a district court applied § 1252(b)(9) to bar claims markedly similar to those brought by
Plaintiffs. See Arias v. U.S. ICE Div. of the Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 07-cv-1959, 2008 WL
1827604 (D. Minn. Apr. 23, 2008). In Arias, aliens arrested during ICE operations brought
constitutional tort claims against ICE officials for, among other things, purported Fourth
Amendment and Fifth Amendment equal protection violations. The court dismissed the claims,
holding that § 1252(b)(9) stripped it of jurisdiction. See id. at *5-6.
Second, the two original Plaintiffs have already raised the exact same Fourth
Amendment claim—and effectively has also raised the same Fifth Amendment claim—in the

9

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 18 of 47 PageID# 341

removal proceedings the Government has instituted against them. See Ex. 1, Tun-Cos Mot. to
Suppress Evid. & Term. Procs., at 7-12; Ex. 2, Saput Mot. to Suppress Evid. & Term. Procs., at
7-12. 5 Those motions are currently pending before the immigration court. Accordingly, an
immigration judge is already considering their Fourth Amendment, and, by dint of their
allegations, their Fifth Amendment claims.
This is precisely the sort of situation that Congress wanted to avoid through enacting
§ 1252(b)(9). By pursuing these parallel proceedings, the original Plaintiffs obtain for themselves
“two bites” of the proverbial apple—one before the immigration judge (and potentially later
before the Fourth Circuit in a petition for review), and another before this Court. Moreover, by
asking two separate bodies to adjudicate the same alleged facts, Plaintiffs consume scarce
judicial and Executive Branch resources and create the very “piecemeal review, uncertainty, and
lack of uniformity” that Congress sought to obviate through its amendments to the INA.
Moreover, it is not a stretch to imagine that two forums might reach different conclusions on
nearly identical legal issues based on the exact same factual underpinning. Both proceedings
could then be appealed to the same (or, depending on where suit was filed, potentially a
different) court of appeals. Nor is it a stretch, given such a possible outcome, that one body
would opt to stay its proceedings to allow the other to consider the issues Plaintiffs raise first.
Such an outcome either would be the antithesis of the streamlined process for removal
proceedings that Congress sought to construct through the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the
INA, including § 1252(b)(9), or would effectively deprive the Defendants of defenses to which
they are entitled, as will be explained below. See infra Part II.D.v.

Courts may consider facts beyond the complaint to determine their jurisdiction. See Vuyyuru,
555 F.3d at 347 (citation omitted).

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 19 of 47 PageID# 342

And of the newly added Plaintiffs, six are also in removal proceedings, see Ex. 3, Notices
to Appear, and can therefore raise their constitutional claims before the immigration court in
those proceedings, just as the original Plaintiffs have. 6 Indeed, as detailed above, these newly
added Plaintiffs do not have the option of choosing one forum over the other to raise their
constitutional challenges. See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9-10. Rather, raising their constitutional
claims in their removal proceedings is how Congress intended for them to proceed.
Because Plaintiffs’ claims are commonplace in removal proceedings—and two Plaintiffs’
claims in fact have been raised there—§ 1252(b)(9) removes this Court’s jurisdiction over those
claims. Therefore, this Court must dismiss the claims of the eight Plaintiffs in removal
proceedings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and allow the immigration court to address
Plaintiffs’ constitutional contentions.
II.

This Court Should Not Imply a Non-Statutory Remedy for Any of the Plaintiffs’
Constitutional Claims.
Even without the jurisdictional bar of § 1252(b)(9), this Court should dismiss all the

Plaintiffs’ claims because under both recent Supreme Court precedent and Fourth Circuit
precedent, they raise numerous special factors counselling hesitation which preclude any Bivens
remedy. Plaintiffs ask this Court to infer a damages remedy in a new context the Supreme Court
has never recognized, immigration enforcement operations carried out in search of specific aliens
during which other aliens are encountered and detained. Congress has already established—and
frequently modified over the years—a comprehensive statutory scheme in this new context, a
fact three other circuits have noted, and this established process and significant and ongoing

A Notice to Appear initiates removal proceedings against an alien. See Dakura v. Holder, 772
F. App’x 994, 995 (4th Cir. 2014).

congressional attention to the immigration arena preclude supplementing the legislative scheme
Congress has crafted. Moreover, implying a damages remedy in the immigration context, which
is constitutionally committed to the political branches, raises a multitude of concerns regarding
the administrability of such a remedy and its practical implications, concerns the Fourth Circuit
has already recognized in another context in which it refused to imply a damages remedy.
A. Implying a damages remedy under the Constitution is disfavored.
i.

The “ancien regime” and Abbasi.

Plaintiffs ask this Court to create a damages remedy for them under Bivens, an action that
“is now a ‘disfavored’ judicial activity.” Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017). In
Abbasi, the Supreme Court explained that Bivens, which was decided over forty-five years ago,
arose in a different legal “interpretive framework” under which courts “assumed it to be a proper
judicial function to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective a statute’s
purpose.” Id. at 1855 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Under this “ancien regime,” id.,
the Bivens Court “held that courts must adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief
when federally protected rights have been invaded.” Id. (internal quotations and citations
omitted). Bivens itself provided a damages remedy under the Fourth Amendment for a United
States citizen arrested without a warrant in his home in Brooklyn on drug charges. See Bivens,
403 U.S. at 389. In the decade after Bivens, and still under the then-prevailing legal framework,
the Court expanded Bivens into only two new contexts: “a claim against a Congressman for
firing his female secretary; and a claim against prison officials for failure to treat an inmate’s
asthma.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860 (reciting facts in Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979),
and Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980)).
But in the more than three decades since Carlson, the legal landscape has shifted away
12

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 21 of 47 PageID# 344

from implied causes of action, and the Court has “consistently refused to extend Bivens to any
new context or new category of defendants.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1857 (citing and quoting Corr.
Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 68 (2001)). Indeed, in the nine cases that came before the
Court in that time period—ten including Abbasi—the Court held that a Bivens remedy was not
available. See, e.g., Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1863 (rejecting claims by post-September 11 detainees
against Executive Branch officials); Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U.S. 118, 120 (2012) (rejecting
claims by federal prisoner against guards at private prison); Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537,
547-48 (2007) (rejecting claims against Bureau of Land Management officials for allegedly
pushing “too hard” in the execution of their duties); Malesko, 534 U.S. at 63 (rejecting claim
against private prison operator); FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 473-74 (1994) (rejecting claim
against federal agency). The Court itself has gone so far as to note that “in light of the changes to
the Court’s general approach to recognizing implied damages remedies, it is possible that the
analysis in the Court’s three Bivens cases might have been different if they were decided today.”
Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1856. Although the Court has not abrogated Bivens, it has emphasized—
repeatedly—that “expanding the Bivens remedy is now a ‘disfavored’ judicial activity.” Id. at
1857 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 675).
Accordingly, the Court explained that when a party “seeks to assert an implied cause of
action under the Constitution . . . separation-of-powers principles are or should be central to the
analysis.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1857. “The question is ‘who should decide’ whether to provide
for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts?” Id. (quoting Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 380
(1983)). And because “[i]t is not necessarily a judicial function to establish whole categories of
cases in which federal officers must defend against personal liability claims in the complex
sphere of litigation, with all of its burdens on some and benefits to others,” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at
13

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 22 of 47 PageID# 345

1858, the Court offered this answer: “most often it will be Congress.” Id. at 1857. That is
because when an issue “involves a host of considerations that must be weighed and appraised, it
should be committed to those who write the laws rather than those who interpret them.” Id.
(quoting Bush, 462 U.S. at 380) (internal quotations omitted).
ii.

The standard for implying a damages remedy.

Abbasi also clarified the standard for evaluating whether to imply a damages remedy
under Bivens. First, a court must determine whether recognizing a remedy would extend Bivens
into a new context. The Court narrowly defined “new context” as an instance where “the case is
different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases decided by [the Supreme] Court.” Id.
at 1859. In other words, if the case is different “in a meaningful way” from either Fourth
Amendment claims against federal law enforcement officers for a domestic search and seizure of
a United States citizen on suspected drug offenses, see Bivens, 403 U.S. at 389; Fifth
Amendment claims for the firing of a female congressional secretary based on her gender, see
Davis, 442 U.S. at 230; or Eighth Amendment claims against prison officials for failing to treat
an inmate’s asthma, causing him death, see Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19, then the context is new.
The Court then offered a non-exhaustive list of examples that could “prove instructive” in
determining whether differences are meaningful. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860. That list included,
among others, the following three examples: (1) “the statutory or other legal mandate under
which the officer was operating”; (2) “the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the
functioning of other branches”; and (3) “the presence of potential special factors that previous
Bivens cases did not consider.” Id. Each of these examples alone could render the context new.
Id. Moreover, seemingly minor differences, if meaningful, can present a new context. As the
Court in Abbasi noted, “even a modest extension is still an extension.” Id. at 1864.
14

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 23 of 47 PageID# 346

If a plaintiff seeks to extend Bivens into a new context, then the court must address
whether special factors counsel hesitation. See id. at 1860. To answer this question, the Supreme
Court has engaged in a two-step inquiry identified in Wilkie. The court first asks whether
Congress has instituted “any alternative, existing process for protecting” a plaintiff’s interests,
551 U.S. at 537, or any “meaningful safeguards or remedies” for the plaintiff. Schweiker v.
Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412, 425 (1988). Such actions by Congress imply that it “expected the
Judiciary to stay its Bivens hand” and not infer a new damages remedy. Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 554;
see, e.g., Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1863 (“And when alternative methods of relief are available, a
Bivens remedy usually is not.”); Chilicky, 487 U.S. at 429; Bush, 462 U.S. at 390. That
Congress’s scheme may not provide the precise remedy a plaintiff seeks, such as damages, does
not alter this analysis. See United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 683 (1987) (“[I]t is irrelevant
to a ‘special factors’ analysis whether the laws currently on the books afford [defendants] an
‘adequate’ federal remedy for his injuries.”).
Second, even if no alternative process exists, the court considers whether there are any
additional “special factors counselling hesitation.” Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 550. Although the Court
“has not defined” that phrase, the “necessary inference . . . is that the inquiry must concentrate on
whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and
weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at
1857-58. The threshold for being a special factor is quite low. Indeed, “to be a ‘special factor
counselling hesitation,’ a factor must cause a court to hesitate before answering that question in
the affirmative.” Id. The Abbasi Court did not provide an exhaustive list of special factors
counselling hesitation, but it did provide several examples, including a lawsuit in which a
plaintiff effectively challenges a broad government policy. See Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860 (“[I]t
15

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 24 of 47 PageID# 347

must be noted that a Bivens action is not a proper vehicle for altering an entity’s policy.”
(internal citation and quotation omitted)).
B. Plaintiffs ask this Court to extend Bivens into a new context.
Here, Plaintiffs undoubtedly ask this Court to extend Bivens into a new context.
Plaintiffs’ claims fall within the three examples of meaningful differences identified by the
Supreme Court, and they clearly seek to extend Bivens into a context the Supreme Court has
never considered. First, the Defendants in this case were operating under a different “statutory or
other legal mandate,” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860, than the officials in Bivens, Davis, or Carlson.
Specifically, all Defendants are ICE officials who were conducting immigration enforcement
operations under the statutory mandate of the INA. They are tasked with identifying, locating,
and removing aliens unlawfully present in this country, irrespective of whichever administration
they serve. In contrast, the traditional law enforcement officials in Bivens, the federal workplace
supervisor in Davis, and the prison officials in Carlson all operated under entirely different legal
frameworks. Indeed, the Supreme Court has never permitted a claim to proceed in the context of
immigration enforcement.
Second, Plaintiffs’ claims risk the “disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the
functioning of other branches,” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860, in a way that was not present in
Bivens or its progeny. As already detailed in Part I, Plaintiffs’ claims risk disrupting the
streamlined removal process Congress has enacted and thereby potentially obtaining two
separate rulings from two adjudicatory bodies on the same issue, or staying those proceedings so
as to avoid such a possibility, and thereby delaying the removal process. Such an outcome
stymies both the Legislative Branch’s deliberate design of a streamlined process and the
Executive Branch’s immigration policy. It also undermines the primacy of those branches in this
16

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 25 of 47 PageID# 348

area. No such risks were present in Bivens or its progeny.
Third, this case presents “potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not
consider.” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860. In addition to the concerns of delay in immigration
proceedings already mentioned, and as explained more fully below, see infra Part II.D.v., those
claims have the potential of exposing personal-liability defendants to cross-examination in
evidentiary hearings in those proceedings without personal representation, thereby effectively
abrogating any qualified immunity defenses those defendants may have. Moreover, if the
Government were to move to stay such proceedings until the resolution of any Bivens claims—a
process that can take years—that would substantially increase the incentive for an alien to file
just such a suit in the hopes of delaying his or her removal, thereby encouraging litigation against
line-level ICE officers. This is turn risks chilling immigration enforcement. No comparable
considerations arose in the contexts in which the Supreme Court implied a damages remedy.
Any one of the above differences alone would be “meaningful” enough to establish this
as a new context. See Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860. Together, they undoubtedly do. All the more so
given that “the new-context inquiry is easily satisfied.” Id. at 1865. Because Plaintiffs’ claims
arise in a new context, this Court must determine whether any special factors are present.
C. The INA is a comprehensive statutory scheme that precludes Plaintiffs’ claims. 7
As at least three circuits—the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh—have all held, the INA is a
comprehensive scheme that precludes a court from implying a damages remedy in the
immigration enforcement context. See Alvarez v. U.S. ICE, 818 F.3d 1194, 1208-10 (11th Cir.
2016); De La Paz v. Coy, 786 F.3d 367, 375-78 (5th Cir. 2015); Mirmehdi v. United States, 689

This section does not apply to the claims of Plaintiff Cárcamo, who is not in removal
proceedings.
7

17

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 26 of 47 PageID# 349

F.3d 975, 982-83 (9th Cir. 2012). Cf. Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559, 573 (2d Cir. 2009) (noting
that given “the complexity of the remedial scheme Congress has created (and frequently
amended), we would ordinarily draw a strong inference that Congress intended the judiciary to
stay its hand and refrain from creating a Bivens action in this context” but not deciding that
question in light of the case’s unique circumstances and other special factors present). In two of
those cases—Alvarez and De La Paz—the Supreme Court denied certiorari a week after deciding
Abbasi. See Alvarez, 137 S. Ct. 2321 (2017); De La Paz, 137 S. Ct. 2289 (2017).
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in De La Paz explains why refusing to imply a remedy in the
immigration context makes sense. There, the court first walked through the numerous safeguards
the INA provides to individuals in removal proceedings, noting that the INA provides aliens with
notice of proceedings, an adversarial removal hearing, the right to counsel at the hearing, the
right to present and examine evidence, an appeals process to both the Board of Immigration
Appeals and a federal court of appeals, and standards under which law enforcement personnel
must operate and conduct themselves. See De La Paz, 786 F.3d at 375-76 (citing various
provisions of the INA); see also Alvarez, 818 F.3d at 1208 (similarly explaining the various
procedural safeguards the INA provides aliens). These provisions provide ample safeguards to
the rights Plaintiffs claim were violated. In fact, under the above scheme, the original Plaintiffs
have already sought redress for the alleged violation of those very rights. See Exs. 1, 2. 8 That the
INA does not provide the specific remedy that Plaintiffs seek—money damages—does not mean
this Court should imply one. See Stanley, 483 U.S. at 683 (“[I]t is irrelevant to a ‘special factors’
analysis whether the laws currently on the books afford [defendants] an ‘adequate’ federal

“Courts may take judicial notice of publicly filed documents” in considering a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion. U.S. ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana Inc., 776 F.3d 805, 811 n.4 (11th Cir. 2015).
8

18

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 27 of 47 PageID# 350

remedy for his injuries.”). See also infra, Part II.D.ii. In sum, the INA is an elaborate, carefully
constructed remedial scheme that provides adequate protections and safeguards to aliens. Under
the first step of the two-step inquiry laid out by the Supreme Court, and under substantial circuit
court precedent, this Court should dismiss the claims of the eight Plaintiffs in removal
proceedings.
D. Other special factors counsel hesitation in this context. 9
The above conclusion is all the more sound when one considers the separation-of-powers
concerns and the “problems of administrability” implicated by inferring a damages remedy here.
Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 670 F.3d 540, 553 (4th Cir. 2012). The Fourth Circuit has recognized that
such concerns and problems are highly relevant when determining whether to imply a remedy
under Bivens. In Lebron, the court dismissed on special factors grounds the Bivens claims of a
United States citizen detained domestically as a suspected terrorist, noting those claims involved
an area which the Constitution committed to Congress and the Executive, and that numerous
administrability concerns and undesirable practical effects would flow from inferring a remedy
for the plaintiff. See id. at 548-49, 553-54 (discussing the constitutional commitment of national
security and military affairs to the political branches, and the practical effects a damages remedy
would have on national security policymaking, ongoing intelligence operations, and the
command structure of the military). Although the context of Plaintiffs’ claims is not the same as
This section, and to varying degrees all of the following sections except for section D.v., apply
to Plaintiff Cárcamo’s claims as well. Although Cárcamo was not arrested or placed in removal
proceedings because he has Temporary Protected Status, see Ex. 4, Hrg. Rpt., at 2, his status and
ability to remain in the United States are governed by provisions of the INA. See 8 U.S.C.
§ 1254a. Indeed, § 1254a(c)(3) includes annual requirements and other conditions for Cárcamo
to retain his status, thereby placing him under the jurisdiction of the INA. Given this, the INA’s
comprehensive nature, and, as described below, the INA’s silence regarding damages remedies
for aliens alleging constitutional harms who are subject to its ambit, the special factors
arguments detailed in these sections apply to Cárcamo’s claims.

that in Lebron, the overarching concerns regarding the separation of powers and administrability
mentioned above—which the Fourth Circuit discussed at length—are clearly present.
i.

The Constitution commits immigration matters to the political branches.

First and foremost, Plaintiffs’ claims raise separation-of-powers concerns. Congress has
plenary control over immigration matters. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 4 (“The Congress shall
have Power . . . To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization . . . .”); see also Fiallo v. Bell,
430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (“[O]ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress
more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.” (internal citations and quotation marks
omitted)); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (the principle that “the formulation of these
policies [concerning the entry of aliens and their right to remain here] is entrusted exclusively to
Congress has become about as firmly imbedded in the legislative and judicial tissues of our body
politic as any aspect of our government”). And as explained, supra, Congress has repeatedly
exercised its immigration authority, and has specifically identified the forum in which challenges
of this nature are to be raised, a forum that does not include federal district court.
Moreover, “immigration issues ‘have the natural tendency to affect diplomacy, foreign
policy, and the security of the nation.’” Mirmehdi, 689 F.3d at 982 (quoting Arar, 585 F.3d at
574). Those matters, in turn, are constitutionally committed to Congress and the Executive. See
Lebron, 670 F.3d at 548-49. As the Fourth Circuit in Lebron recognized, 670 F.3d at 548, and as
the Supreme Court in Abbasi confirmed, “separation-of-powers principles are or should be
central to the analysis” of whether to recognize a damages remedy. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1857.
Here, this factor squarely counsels against creating a Bivens remedy.

20

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 29 of 47 PageID# 352

ii.

Congress’s action in the field has been frequent and intense, yet Congress
has never provided a damages remedy.

Congress has exercised its plenary control over immigration by enacting and repeatedly
modifying the INA. Yet it has never created a damages remedy for an alien within that scheme.
This does not mean courts should supplement Congress’s judgment. Quite the opposite. Given
Congress’s “repeated and careful attention to immigration matters,” De La Paz, 786 F.3d at 377,
its omission of that remedy from the INA cannot be said to have “been inadvertent.” Id. (quoting
Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 423). Indeed, since enacting the INA in 1952, Congress has amended it at
least six times. De La Paz, 786 F.3d at 377 (listing statutes). Despite those repeated amendments,
Congress has never provided a damages remedy.
This “institutional silence speaks volumes.” Id. It also “counsels strongly against judicial
usurpation of the legislative function.” Id. See also Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1862 (noting that where
policies “attract the attention of Congress,” yet “Congress fails to provide a damages remedy,”
then “it is much more difficult to believe that ‘congressional inaction’ was ‘inadvertant’” (citing
Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 423)); Mirmehdi, 689 F.3d at 982 (“Congress’s failure to include
monetary relief can hardly be said to be inadvertent, given that despite multiple changes to the
structure of appellate review in the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress never created
such a remedy.” (citation omitted)). Thus, not only do claims in this arena “have the natural
tendency” to affect other areas constitutionally committed to the political branches, but
Congress, despite its frequent attention to immigration in general and the INA in particular, has
never provided a damages remedy. Under these circumstances, this Court should not supplant the
legislative function. It should dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint.

21

iii.

Plaintiffs challenge Executive Branch policy and priorities.

Furthermore, Plaintiffs implicitly call for a different immigration enforcement system
than the one purportedly in place, and thereby challenge federal policy in the immigration arena.
Although the original Plaintiffs amended their complaint to remove all references to the “Trump
Administration’s” alleged policy of “collateral rests” and other statements by high-level
administration officials as a cause for their arrests, compare Dkt. #1, Compl. ¶¶ 5, 15, with Dkt.
#25, FAC, ¶¶ 1-5, they cannot escape the fact that they included those references in setting the
context of the original complaint—which, in terms of substantive factual allegations, remains
unchanged as to the February 17 incident—and have now added seven separate Plaintiffs from a
separate incident in which unlawful aliens who were not the specified target of an operation were
arrested, and argue that the two sets of claims are related. Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendants’
motion, denied without prejudice, under Rules 20 and 21 also demonstrates that Plaintiffs’ actual
target is the perceived immigration enforcement policies and practices of ICE in Virginia and
nationwide. See Dkt. #33 at 7-8. This reveals that, at bottom, Plaintiffs in fact challenge the
purported Executive Branch policy of conducting “collateral arrests,” that is, the arrest of
unlawfully present aliens who are located during a search for a specific target. Thus, in effect,
Plaintiffs bring this personal-liability lawsuit against five line-level agents based on purported
immigration policies adopted by the Executive Branch.
But as the Abbasi Court emphasized, “a Bivens action is not ‘a proper vehicle for altering
an entity’s policy.’” 137 S. Ct. at 1860 (quoting Malesko, 534 U.S. at 72). Moreover, as the
Court explained, even if a complaint “is confined to the conduct of a particular Executive Officer
in a discrete instance,” the claims nonetheless may “call into question the formulation and
implementation of a general policy.” Id. That is the clear aim of this lawsuit. As the Court
22

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 31 of 47 PageID# 354

concluded, “[w]ere this inquiry to be allowed in a private suit for damages, the Bivens action
would assume dimensions far greater than those present in Bivens itself, or in either of its two
follow-on cases.” Id. at 1861. This is yet another special factor counselling against implying a
remedy here.
Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ FAC, which raises claims based on the arrest of unlawful aliens
who were not the target of the alleged ICE operations, implicitly calls for this Court to endorse
an immigration enforcement regime under which ICE officials apprehend only the specific,
already known targets of any operations. Such a regime would “render egregious (and therefore
forbidden) ICE raids on sweatshops, forced brothels, and other settings in which illegal aliens are
exploited and threatened—and much worse.” Maldonado v. Holder, 763 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir.
2014). As the Second Court aptly concluded, “[n]o system of immigration enforcement can run
under these constraints.” Id. at 163.
iv.

The system-wide costs of inferring a damages remedy counsel hesitation.

Beyond the separation-of-powers concerns discussed above, multiple “problems of
administrability” would flow from creating a damages remedy in this context. At the outset, and
as detailed above, inferring a remedy in this context would slow down the streamlined removal
process that Congress has established. The Supreme Court has long recognized the costs of
disrupting removal proceedings with various constitutional challenges. See I.N.S. v. LopezMendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1048 (1984) (“The INS currently operates a deliberately simple
deportation hearing system, streamlined to permit the quick resolution of very large numbers of
deportation actions, and it is against this backdrop that the costs of the exclusionary rule must be
assessed.”). As the Lopez-Mendoza Court explained in holding that, generally, the exclusionary
rule does not apply in civil removal proceedings, “[t]he prospect of even occasional invocation
23

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 32 of 47 PageID# 355

of the exclusionary rule might significantly change and complicate the character of these
proceedings.” Id. Allowing Plaintiffs’ claims to proceed under Bivens, essentially turning routine
immigration matters into individual-capacity suits for money damages, raises similar concerns.
Additionally, in the context of immigration enforcement operations, claims similar to
Plaintiffs’ could readily be asserted by other aliens facing removal proceedings. Moreover, such
claims—particularly to the extent they turn on ICE officials’ motives—are relatively easy to
plead and can be difficult to disprove. See, e.g., United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano, 441 F.3d
1252, 1264 (10th Cir. 2006) (“[C]harges of racial discrimination . . . may be easy to make and
difficult to disprove.” (citation omitted)). Given that every single one of the approximately
61,000 removals performed last year involved a person from a foreign country, see Fiscal Year
2017 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report, available at https://www.ice.gov/
removal-statistics/2017 (last visited Dec. 28, 2017), with at least the potential for equal
protection claims, this could open the floodgates of litigation against ICE officials enforcing
immigration laws. Cf. Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 561 (dismissing claims on special factors grounds in
part because “a Bivens action to redress retaliation against those who resist Government
impositions on their property rights would invite claims in every sphere of legitimate
governmental action affecting property interests”).
The outcome of this would be a marked increase in the number of personal-liability
lawsuits filed against line-level ICE officials based on the circumstances surrounding arrests, the
adequate defense of which “would impose an intolerable administrative burden on the
immigration enforcement system.” Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 447 (2d Cir. 2008)
(discussing Lopez-Mendoza). As the Second Circuit noted, “officers may arrest several aliens per
day” and therefore “cannot be expected to compile elaborate, contemporaneous, written reports
24

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 33 of 47 PageID# 356

detailing the circumstances of every arrest.” Id. See also Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. at 1049-50
(“The demand for a precise account of exactly what happened in each particular arrest would
plainly preclude mass arrests, even when the [agency] is confronted, as it often is, with massed
numbers of ascertainably illegal aliens, and even when the arrests can be and are conducted in
full compliance with all Fourth Amendment requirements.”). Yet to defend the sort of lawsuit
Plaintiffs bring here—should it proceed beyond the pleadings stage—may require precisely that
sort of detail, short of a trial by jury solely to evaluate the credibility of an alien who, for
example, claims he did not give voluntary consent against the testimony of ICE officials who
claim he did. Balancing such concerns, and the related decision of whether to permit this class of
cases for money damages, belong to Congress, not the courts. See Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1858.
v.

Additional practical effects of allowing Plaintiffs’ suit to proceed counsel
against implying a remedy.

Lastly, at least one concrete, practical effect of allowing suits such as Plaintiffs’ to
proceed strongly counsels against implying a damages remedy. Such suits may force the
Government to decide between on the one hand pursuing immigration removal proceedings
against unlawfully present aliens, or on the other, forcing line-level ICE officials who face
potential personal liability to effectively forego their entitlement to a qualified immunity defense
by subjecting them to cross-examination in an evidentiary hearing.
That is precisely the quandary the Government (and the Defendants) face in this very
case. As mentioned above, the original Plaintiffs have already raised constitutional claims nearly
identical to those here in their removal proceedings in motions to suppress evidence. Under
Fourth Circuit precedent, if an alien pleads an “egregious” Fourth Amendment violation, he or
she can obtain an evidentiary hearing. See Yanez-Marquez, 789 F.3d at 450-51. Should Plaintiffs

25

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 34 of 47 PageID# 357

establish a prima facie case through their motions, Defendants would potentially face an
evidentiary hearing at which they could be cross-examined by Plaintiffs’ counsel—who also
represents them in their removal proceedings, see Exs. 1, 2—about the very events underlying
Plaintiffs’ claims. And Defendants would face that cross-examination without their personal
attorney, bound to protect their individual interests, see 28 C.F.R. § 50.15, to defend them.
Beyond the inherent injustice in such a scenario, it would enable Plaintiffs to circumvent
Defendants’ qualified immunity defense, which the Supreme Court has long held is meant to
protect federal officials from the burdens of litigation, including discovery, in the absence of a
clearly established constitutional violation. See, e.g., Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 308
(1996) (“Harlow and Mitchell make clear that the [qualified immunity] defense is meant to give
government officials a right, not merely to avoid ‘standing trial,’ but also to avoid the burdens of
‘such pretrial matters as discovery’ . . . .”); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985)
(“Unless the plaintiff’s allegations state a claim of a violation of clearly established law, the
defendant is entitled to qualified immunity before the commencement of discovery.”); see also
Cloaninger ex rel. Estate of Cloaninger v. McDevitt, 555 F.3d 324, 330 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting
Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526). Not only would this give Plaintiffs two bites of the apple in their
removal proceedings, it would give them two bites of the apple in their discovery into
Defendants: one during immigration removal proceedings, and one during civil discovery. That
simply cannot be right. And it certainly is not what Bivens was meant for.
In short, Plaintiffs’ claims raise numerous separation-of-powers and system-wide
administrability concerns, among other special factors. They also raise the prospect of Plaintiffs
using this lawsuit as both a shield, potentially delaying their immigration removal proceedings,
and as a sword, obtaining premature discovery against Defendants in this case. This Court should
26

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 35 of 47 PageID# 358

not permit that, and should instead dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims.
III.

Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity.
Dismissal of Plaintiffs’ Bivens claims is also warranted on the independent ground that

Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The courts have long noted that individualcapacity actions like this one “entail substantial social costs, including the risk that fear of
personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge
of their duties.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987) (citation omitted). To address
those concerns, the Supreme Court established the defense of qualified immunity. See Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982). Qualified immunity shields officials performing discretionary
functions from liability for civil damages “insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”
Id. at 818. The Supreme Court has emphasized that in order to ensure that qualified immunity
shields officials from the fear of civil damages as well as the harassment of litigation, Anderson,
483 U.S. at 638, qualified immunity contains an “entitlement not to stand trial or face the other
burdens of litigation.” Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526 (citation omitted). It is “an immunity from suit
rather than a mere defense to liability.” Id. Accordingly, the Court has “repeatedly . . . stressed
the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.”
Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam) (citations omitted).
Three components of qualified immunity come into play in this case: first, for Plaintiffs’
constitutional claims to survive, they must allege facts “plausibly suggesting (not merely
consistent with)” violation of a clearly established right. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.
544, 557 (2007). In evaluating the allegations, the Court must ignore “legal conclusions” stated
in the complaint. Walters v. McMahon, 684 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012). After eliminating such
27

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 36 of 47 PageID# 359

unsupported legal conclusions, the Court should ask whether Plaintiffs have proffered sufficient
“factual allegations” against each Defendant to “advance the plaintiff’s claim ‘across the line
from conceivable to plausible.’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). “A claim has facial
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citation
omitted). Although the “plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’” id., an
inference of misconduct may be rendered implausible when the allegations of misconduct are
more likely explained by lawful behavior than by unlawful behavior. See id. at 679-80.
Second, qualified immunity is a “fair notice” requirement, Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730,
739 (2002), which is intended to protect government officials from suit unless they are “plainly
incompetent or . . . knowingly violate the law.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S 731, 743 (2011)
(quotation omitted); see also Raub v. Campbell, 785 F.3d 876, 881 (4th Cir. 2015) (granting
qualified immunity in the § 1983 context). Qualified immunity “gives ample room for mistaken
judgments” and “protects public officials from bad guesses in gray areas.” Durham v. Horner,
690 F.3d 183, 190 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal quotations and citations omitted). For a right to be
clearly established, it must be adequately developed by existing law so as to provide an official
with sufficient guidance: “The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable
official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640.
The illegality of the officer’s actions must, in the light of pre-existing law, be “beyond debate.”
al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741. The Supreme Court has “repeatedly” implored lower courts “not to
define clearly established law at a high level of generality.” Id. at 742 (citations omitted). See
also Safar v. Tingle, 859 F.3d 241, 246 (4th Cir. 2017) (“[I]t is a longstanding principle that
clearly established law should not be defined at a high level of generality.” (internal quotation
28

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 37 of 47 PageID# 360

and citation omitted)).
And third, qualified immunity applies unless a plaintiff alleges that a defendant
personally participated in a clearly established constitutional violation. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at
672-75 (finding appellate jurisdiction for denial of claim to qualified immunity that was based on
failure to plead allegations of personal participation in alleged constitutional violations). As the
Supreme Court explained in Iqbal, to state a claim under Bivens, “a plaintiff must plead that each
Government-official defendant, through the official’s own individual actions, has violated the
Constitution.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676. Government officials cannot be held liable for the
misconduct of other government officials. See id. Accordingly, where plaintiffs sue a number of
Government officials in their individual capacities, “it is particularly important in such
circumstances that the complaint make clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom.”
Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1250 (10th Cir. 2008). See Evans v. Chalmers, 703 F.3d
636, 661 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing and quoting Iqbal and Robbins in concurring with dismissal of
claims against government officials for whom no specific allegations were raised) (Wilkinson, J.,
concurring); Marcantonio v. Dudzinski, 155 F. Supp. 3d 619, 626 (W.D. Va. 2015) (“In the
Fourth Circuit and elsewhere, courts have interpreted Twombly and Iqbal to mean that generic or
general allegations about the conduct of ‘defendants,’ without more, fail to state a claim.”
(citations omitted)). This Court should grant qualified immunity to Defendants because Plaintiffs
have failed plausibly to allege that each Defendant personally participated in a violation of a
clearly established constitutional right.
A. The Original Plaintiffs fail to allege that Defendants committed a clearly
established Fourth Amendment violation during the February 17 incident.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const.

29

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 38 of 47 PageID# 361

amend. IV. Law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct an investigatory stop if they have
a “reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person seized is engaged in criminal activity.”
See United States v. King, 119 F.3d 290, 294 (4th Cir. 1997) (quoting Reid v. Georgia, 448 U.S.
438, 400 (1980)). “A reasonable, articulable suspicion is a particularized and objective basis for
suspecting the person stopped.” King, 119 F.3d at 294 (quoting Ornelas v. United States, 517
U.S. 690, 696 (1996)). Assuming that the original Plaintiffs’ factual allegations are correct for
the purposes of this dispositive motion only, Defendants concede that the original Plaintiffs have
pled that an investigatory stop occurred when the original Plaintiffs’ vehicle was blocked by an
SUV in the early morning hours of February 17. See FAC ¶ 56; United States v. Jones, 678 F.3d
293, 300-01 (4th Cir. 2012).
But it certainly was not clearly established that the stop was unreasonable or that
Defendants had no “particularized and objective basis for suspecting” the occupants of the
vehicle and stopping it. According to Plaintiffs’ own complaint, Defendants were searching for
adult male suspects who had lived in the apartment complex at which the stop occurred. See
FAC ¶ 63. Not only that, the suspects had lived in the very apartment the original Plaintiffs left
as they went to their vehicle early that morning. Id. Moreover, the stop occurred at 6:25 a.m., id.
¶ 55, roughly thirty minutes before sunrise, in the heart of winter. 10
Under such circumstances, Defendants had a “particularized and objective basis” to stop
the original Plaintiffs’ vehicle to ascertain whether any of the four adult male occupants in fact
Courts may take judicial notice of such undisputed facts as the time of sunrise on a certain
date. See Davis v. United States, No. 1:07-cr-254, 2011 WL 13192740, at *3 (E.D. Va. Dec. 15,
2011). According to The Old Farmer’s Almanac, on February 17, 2017, sunrise in Annandale,
Virginia, was at 6:55 a.m. See https://www.almanac.com/astronomy/rise/VA/Annandale/201702-17. Plaintiffs’ assertion that the time of the alleged seizure was “a mere five minutes before
the start of civil twilight,” FAC at 13 n.2, simply reinforces the fact that the seizure occurred well
before sunrise in the depth of the winter.
10

30

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 39 of 47 PageID# 362

were the adult male suspects Defendants sought. See Taft v. Vines, 70 F.3d 304, 312 (4th Cir.
1995) (officers had reasonable suspicion to stop vehicle that left mobile home park where
suspected murderer resided), reh’g granted, opinion adopted in relevant part en banc, 83 F.3d
681, 683-84 (4th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). At bare minimum, it was not clearly established they
had no lawful basis for stopping the vehicle. That none of the occupants turned out to be the
suspects is irrelevant. Id. (“[T]he mistaken seizure of an individual is not pertinent to a proper
qualified immunity analysis.”).
Once the Defendants had a basis for stopping the vehicle on suspicion of containing
criminal aliens, they were entitled to ask the occupants for their identification and their
immigration status. See United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 881 (1975) (“[W]hen an
officer’s observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens
who are illegally in the country, he may stop the car briefly and investigate the circumstances
that provoke suspicion.”). As the Court added in Brignoni-Ponce, “[t]he officer may question the
driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status . . . .” Id. That one of the
vehicle occupants could not produce identification, FAC ¶ 60, would not serve to allay any
suspicion Defendants had. Moreover, the original Plaintiffs make no mention of what sort of
identification they produced—or of their actual citizenship or status to be in the United States,
for that matter. See generally FAC. Such “evasive pleading,” De La Paz, 786 F.3d at 370 n.2,
cannot skirt the fact that the original Plaintiffs themselves, in their own motions to suppress filed
in their removal proceedings, do not contest that they indeed are aliens who do not have legal
status to remain in the United States. See generally Exs. 1, 2. Once this fact was established, be it
at the vehicle when officers first asked for identification, or in the apartment they returned to
after an occupant failed to produce any, all possible Fourth Amendment concerns disappeared.
31

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 40 of 47 PageID# 363

In sum, the original Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Defendants violated a clearly
established Fourth Amendment right. This Court should therefore dismiss the original Plaintiffs’
Fourth Amendment claim because Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.
B. The newly added Plaintiffs have failed to allege which Defendants, and how each
Defendant, personally participated in the alleged events of February 8, 2017.
The newly added Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim fails to state a claim because their
allegations do not specify which of the five Defendants was involved in the February 8, 2017
alleged incident, and also do not explain who is alleged to have done what to whom. Although
the FAC contains specific factual allegations of certain discrete acts occurring early on February
8, including encounters with individuals, statements to inhabitants of the house in Arlington, and
other discrete acts, the FAC does not say which of the five Defendants were at all allegedly
involved in these acts. See FAC ¶ 20. Nor does it specifically identify any individual Defendant
as having allegedly committed any act on February 8. Instead, the FAC refers variously to “four
Defendants,” FAC ¶ 20; “three Defendants,” id. ¶ 28; “two Defendants,” id. ¶ 29; “[o]ne,” “a,” or
“the” “Defendant,” id. ¶¶ 23, 29, 32, 36-42, 46-48; or just “Defendants,” id. ¶¶ 21-22, 25-28, 31,
34-36, 43-46. Indeed, there is not a single specific allegation in the FAC naming a specific
Defendant. See generally, FAC.
But such allegations against a vague set of “Defendants” in an individual-capacity suit
against five individuals are insufficient to state a Bivens claim under basic pleading standards.
Marcantonio v. Dudzinski, a common-law tort action, illustrates this point. In Marcantonio, a
first-year student on the University of Virginia’s swim team sued five more senior swimmers for
allegedly hazing him, listing a series of factually detailed, explicit, discrete acts the defendants
purportedly committed. See Marcantonio, 155 F. Supp. 3d at 623-25 (summarizing allegations).

32

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 41 of 47 PageID# 364

Yet the court found that allegations against “defendants” that failed to specify which of the five
defendants committed the alleged act were insufficient, even though the facts alleged were
themselves detailed. See id. at 626 (dismissing all claims against defendant for whom no specific
allegations were raised against him by name); see also Butler v. Bank of Am., N.A., 690 F.3d 959,
961 (8th Cir. 2012) (dismissing claims against law firm where no allegations specified its
involvement in fraud but complaint contained general allegations against “defendants”); Bryson
v. Gonzales, 534 F.3d 1282, 1290 (10th Cir. 2008) (noting that generic claims against
“defendants” did not assist in determining which factual allegations were pled against police
chief defendant); Raub v. Bowen, 960 F. Supp. 2d 602, 616 (E.D. Va. 2013) (dismissing false
imprisonment claim against unspecified defendants were claims brought against “one or more
Defendants—including but not limited to” two other specified defendants).
Here, like in Marcantino, the newly added Plaintiffs bring tort claims against five
Defendants and plead discrete factual events, yet fail to specify which of the “Defendants” is
alleged to have done what to whom. As with the plaintiff in Marcantino who failed to state
claims against a defendant who was not specifically alleged to have committed the underlying
tortious acts, the newly added Plaintiffs fail to state a claim against Defendants.
This applies all the more so to the newly added Plaintiffs’ allegations, which paint a
vague, confusing, and often contradictory picture of how many “Defendants” were allegedly
involved in many of the discrete acts pled. For example, the newly added Plaintiffs assert that
“four Defendants” participated in the February 8 operation, FAC ¶ 20. Yet after alleging that
“three Defendants” remained in the basement of the house, id. ¶ 28, Plaintiffs claim that “two
Defendants” then went upstairs to the second floor, raising to five the number of “Defendants”
purportedly involved. Id. ¶¶ 29-30. But when those “two Defendants” returned to the first floor
33

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 42 of 47 PageID# 365

(not the basement), “several armed Defendants” already awaited them, id. ¶ 40, while
“Defendants” still remained in the basement. Id. ¶ 44. That puts the total number of
“Defendants” participating in the incident at seven—if not more. In a constitutional tort
complaint against five ICE officers in their individual capacities, “such vagaries,” Raub, 960 F.
Supp. 2d at 616, will not do. This Court should therefore dismiss the newly added Plaintiffs’
Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims against Defendants.
C. All Plaintiffs have failed adequately to plead a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
Relatedly, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim because they have
failed to allege a plausible violation of their Fifth Amendment rights, not to mention a clearly
established violation. In effect, their equal protection claim is a selective prosecution claim in
that they assert the Government has selected to enforce immigration laws against them based on
their race and ethnicity, while not doing so to unlawfully present aliens of other races and
ethnicities. “As a general matter . . . an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional
right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against his deportation.” AADC, 525 U.S. at
488. Thus, it is not clearly impermissible for the United States to take into account an alien’s
national origin in removal proceedings. Although in the criminal context, a decision to prosecute
aliens of a certain race and ethnicity in a discriminatory manner or based on a discriminatory
animus would likely be unlawful, see United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996),
even in that context, to state such a claim in criminal proceedings, a plaintiff “must establish that
(1) similarly situated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted; and (2) that the decision
to prosecute was invidious or in bad faith.” United States v. Braddock, 410 F. App’x 587, 589
(4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). See also United
States v. Nicolas-Juan, 426 F. App’x 154, 155 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (dismissing equal
34

Case 1:17-cv-00943-AJT-TCB Document 39 Filed 01/02/18 Page 43 of 47 PageID# 366

protection claim because criminal alien was “not similarly situated with non-criminal aliens”).
Plaintiffs—who face immigration removal proceedings, which are civil, and not criminal
proceedings—fail plausibly to allege either of the criteria they would need to plead even if
prosecuted. First, they have not alleged that Defendants failed to question or detain other
similarly situated aliens of a different race or ethnicity. Their assertions that “[t]he
neighborhoods where ICE targeted Plaintiffs have a higher concentration of people with Latino
ethnicity than other neighborhoods in the vicinity,” FAC ¶ 71, is irrelevant because the correct
inquiry focuses on how similarly situated aliens are treated, not on the specific ethnic
composition of one locale. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. And Plaintiffs simply have not
alleged that similarly situated unlawful aliens located in Alexandria or Annandale who are not of
Latino ethnicity have been treated differently than Plaintiffs. See generally, FAC. Nor have they
alleged that other locales with a lower concentration of people with Latino ethnicity have seen a
significantly lower frequency of ICE operations to locate unlawful aliens.
Even if Plaintiffs had adequately alleged that they were treated differently than similarly
situated unlawful aliens, their allegations of discriminatory intent are wholly conclusory. Their
claim that Defendants detained them “solely based on” their “apparent race, ethnicity, or
perceived national origin,” FAC ¶¶ 72, 81, is just the sort of “formulaic recitation of the elements
of a cause of action” that this Court must ignore. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 662. See Aguilar v. ICE, 811
F. Supp. 2d 803, 820 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (dismissing equal protection claim where plaintiffs alleged
that officials “intended to violate constitutional rights”). 11
The newly added Plaintiffs’ allegation that a “Defendant” asked whether “other ‘Spanish
families’” lived nearby, aside from applying only to the alleged February 8 operation, does not
state a claim because it fails to specify who allegedly made that comment. See supra Part III.B.
In any event, in the context of looking for the individual they sought, such a statement would not
state the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.
11

35

Moreover, even based on the few facts actually pled, their claims simply are implausible.
The original Plaintiffs’ bare assertion that Defendants detained and questioned them “solely
based on their apparent race, ethnicity, or perceived national origin,” FAC ¶ 81, is belied by a
more plausible explanation. Namely, Defendants detained and questioned Plaintiffs because in
the early morning hours, they left the apartment where suspected criminal aliens Defendants
were searching for had lived. Id. ¶ 63. And, as it turned out, Plaintiffs were undocumented aliens
and could not establish lawful presence.
Similarly, the newly added Plaintiffs’ claims that Defendants detained and questioned
them “solely based on” their “apparent race, ethnicity, or perceived national origin,” FAC ¶ 72,
is implausible when considering that at least one individual of that same “apparent race,
ethnicity, or perceived national origin,” id., was not arrested—namely, Cárcamo. Moreover,
although the FAC makes no mention of the ethnicity of the various female individuals
encountered during the February 8 operation, it is noteworthy that none of those women were
detained or questioned. Instead, adult males (like the individual that Defendants sought) who
were unable to establish their lawful presence in the United States, were questioned and detained.
As between the “obvious alternative explanation” for the detention and questioning of all the
Plaintiffs and “the purposeful, invidious discrimination” Plaintiffs asks this Court to infer,
“discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 682. Undertaking the task of
removing unlawfully present aliens, the very job Defendants were hired to do, certainly does not
violate any clearly established right. 12

Because Plaintiffs’ Bivens claims fail, their claim for declaratory relief must be dismissed as
well. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (DJA), does not provide a cause of
action. “It is a well-established rule that the Declaratory Judgment Act is not an independent
source of federal jurisdiction.” Ali v. Rumsfeld, 649 F.3d 762, 778 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal

CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs’ suit attempts to stymie their immigration removal proceedings and to alter the
perceived immigration enforcement policies of the Executive Branch. Congress and the Supreme
Court have both weighed in against such attempts in the context of an individual damages claim.
For these reasons and those stated above, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amended
Complaint.

presupposes the existence of a judicially remediable right.” Id.; see also Gibraltar, P.R., Inc. v.
Otoki Grp., Inc., 104 F.3d 616, 619 (4th Cir. 1997) (“[T]he DJA does not provide a source of
jurisdiction which is independent of substantive federal law.”).
