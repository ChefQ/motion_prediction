IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
FORT WORTH DIVISION
______________________________________
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
v.

Criminal No. 4:13-CR-142-Y
(ECF)

JAMIER MARQUIS ROBINS (01)
GOVERNMENT=S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT=S
MOTION FOR DEPARTURE AND/OR VARIANCE
The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, in response to the
defendant Jamier Marquis Robins’s Motion for Downward Departure and/or Variance,
would respectfully show the Court as follows:
The government opposes a departure but defers to the Court as to the propriety of
a variance.

Robins has already received the benefit of a statutory cap of 20 years; after

consideration of all of Robins’s offense conduct (Total Offense Level 37) and criminal
history (Criminal History Category III), his guideline range was 262 to 327 months.
Departure based on USSC’s Proposed Amendment
Robins requests a two-level variance based on the Sentencing Commission’s
proposed amendment to section 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowers all
current base offense levels by two points. In the alternative, he requested a continuance to
evaluate the Sentencing Commission’s hearing on the amendment, which is scheduled for
March 2014, and which the Court has already denied.

When arriving at a properly calculated guideline range, the Court should consider
the Guideline that is in effect. If a proposed amendment does go into effect, it is unlikely
to occur before November 1, 2014. This Court has already noted that delaying the hearing
until that date is not practical. Of course, the Court may consider both the proposed
amendment and the current base offense level 1 in arriving at an appropriate sentence uder
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).
Departure Based on Drug Purity
Robins also asks the Court not to consider the purity of the methamphetamine he
was selling because, he argues, that unfairly increases his Guideline range. The
Sentencing Commission implemented an increase for “actual” methamphetamine in
response to Congress’s concern that methamphetamine, frequently known as “Ice,” was
more addictive and more dangerous. See, U.S.SENTENCING COMMISSION,
Methamphetamine Final Report at 11 (November 1999). The purity level of drugs found
in Robins’s home was 97.7 percent. PSR ¶ 8. It is reasonable to believe that Congress
intended that an individual distributing methamphetamine with that level of purity was
much more dangerous to the community than an offender with diluted mixtures and
substances.

“The court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.” U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(a).

Conclusion
The government defers to the Court’s determination as to whether any variance is
appropriate in light of all the circumstances surrounding the offense. Robins suggests the
Court should depart six levels; however, with his Criminal History III, his Guidelines
would actually be 135-168 months—rather than 121-151 months, which the defendant
mistakenly suggested.
