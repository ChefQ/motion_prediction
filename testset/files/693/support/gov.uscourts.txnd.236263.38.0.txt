DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR DOWNWARD DEPARTURE AND/OR VARIANCE
OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE
TO THE HONORABLE TERRY R. MEANS, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:
COMES NOW, JAMIER MARQUIS ROBINS, defendant, by and through his attorney of
record, CHRISTOPHER A. CURTIS, and hereby submits these and shows as follows:
I. A two level reduction in offense level is warranted because the Sentencing Commision is
lowering the drug guidelines.
The United States Sentencing Commission is lowering the drug guidelines. On Thursday,
January 9, 2014, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to publish proposed guideline
amendments that would reduce the sentencing guidelines levels for federal drug trafficking
offenses.1 The bipartisan Commission voted to seek comment on a proposed amendment to
lower by two levels the base offense levels in the Drug Quantity Table across drug types in
guideline §2D1.1, which governs drug trafficking cases. Commission analysis indicates that such
a change in the guidelines would result in a reduction of approximately 11 months for those drug
trafficking offenders who would benefit, resulting in a reduction in the federal prison population
of approximately 6,550 inmates by the fifth year after the change.

“Like many in Congress and in the executive and judicial branches, the Commission is
concerned about the growing crisis in federal prison populations and budgets, and believes it is
appropriate at this time to carefully consider the sentences for drug traffickers, who make up
about half of the federal prison population,” said the Honorable Patti B. Saris, Chair of the
Sentencing Commission.2 “Our proposed approach is modest,” Judge Saris said.3
The department of justice supports the sentencing commission's reasons for
lowering the guidelines. “It’s clear . . . that too many Americans go to too many prisons for far
too long, and for no truly good law enforcement reason. . . . The bottom line is that . . . we
cannot simply . . . incarcerate our way to becoming a safer nation.” These words were spoken
just months ago by United States Attorney General Eric Holder.4
In a July 11, 2013, letter to Judge Saris at the Sentencing Commission, the Director of the
Office of Policy and Legislation for the Department of Justice wrote:
Now with the sequester, the challenges for federal criminal justice have increased
dramatically and the choices we all face - Congress, the Judiciary, the Executive
Branch - are that much clearer and more stark: control federal prison spending or
see significant reductions in the resources available for all non-prison criminal
justice areas. If the current spending trajectory continues and we do not reduce the
prison population and prison spending, there will continue to be fewer and fewer
prosecutors to bring charges, fewer agents to investigate federal crimes, less
support to state and local criminal justice partners, less support to treatment,
prevention and intervention programs, and cuts along a range of other criminal
justice priorities.

*****
The reforms we are focused on - and that we think the Commission can help bring
about - are changes to statutory and guideline drug penalties; improving reentry
programming and providing greater incentives to offenders to participate in these
programs; and simplifying and reforming the guidelines to better meet all the
goals of the Sentencing Reform Act, including controlling the prison population.5

The proposed reduction by the Sentencing Commission not only is consistent with
the Department of Justice, it follows Congressional dictate. The Sentencing Reform Act of
1984 established the Commission’s organic statute and provided that the Commission,
“consistent with all pertinent provisions of any Federal statute,” shall promulgate guidelines and
policy statements.6 One of the organic statutes directs the Commission to ensure that the
guidelines are “formulated to minimize the likelihood that the Federal prison population will
exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons.”7
This Court is undoubtably aware of the current BOP prison overcrowding, and drug
offense sentences are the major cause of the federal prison population increase that has grown by
almost 800% since 1980.8 The Commission’s proposed current year 2014 amendments lower the
base offense levels contained in the Drug Quantity Table to “reflect [the Commission’s] priority

of reducing costs of incarceration and overcapacity of prisons, without endangering public
safety.”9 In doing so, the Commission is complying with Congress’s directive. This Court’s
sentence should reflect that same congressional will.
Even the Bureau of Prisons favors this type of amendment. The Director of the BOP,
Charles E. Samuels, testified before the Commission that “[t]he most direct and immediate way
to reduce prison expenditures is to reduce the total number of inmates incarcerated or the
number of years to which they are sentenced.”10 Studies indicate that extended drug offense
sentences contribute significantly to the increase in federal prison population, and “[d]rug
offenders comprise the largest single offender group admitted to federal prison.”11 Thus,
following the Congressional mandate, the BOP, the Commission, and the DOJ have prioritized
the reduction of incarceration expenditures by reforming the federal sentencing policies,
including the Sentencing Guidelines.
The reduction is almost certain to happen. On information and belief, to date, Congress
has declined on only two occasions to accept a proposed amendment in the Commission’s

almost 30 years of existence. The first instance was in 1991, when Congress rejected
Amendment 372 regarding child pornography.12 In the second instance, Congress, in 1995,
rejected amendments 5 and 18 relating to lessening crack cocaine sentencing disparities and
money laundering and transaction in property derived from unlawful activity.13 Of course, as this
Court knows, in 2010, Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act, reducing the disparity between
the amount of crack cocaine and powder cocaine from the 100-to-1 ratio to an 18-to-1 ratio and
eliminating the five-year mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession.14 With the
passage of the Fair Sentencing Act, Congress has continued the trend of reducing the extensive
sentencing related to drug offenses.
Because the Commission and DOJ have both recommitted themselves to implementing
the congressional directive set out at 28 U.S.C. § 944(g), and because the DOJ is increasingly
focused on prevention and reentry, the commission’s proposed 2014 amendment lowering the
drug quantity base offense levels is virtually assured. Congress has implicitly dictated this result

U.S. SENTENCING COMM’N, THE HISTORY OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY GUIDELINES 19-24
(2009), available at
http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Research_Projects/Sex_Offenses/
20091030_History_Child_Pornography_Guidelines.pdf. Congress disagreed with the
Commission’s decision to treat receipt and possession of child pornography as similar offenses,
and set forth directives to promulgate an amendment that treated receipt cases similarly to
trafficking rather than possession. Once the Commission submitted amendments 435 and 436
pursuant to Congress’s directives, the amendments became effective on November 27, 1991.

Pub. L. 104-38, 109 Stat. 334 (1995). The Commission sought to reduce the then 100-to-1
ratio for crack cocaine adopted by Congress in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 to a 1-to-1
ratio. Congress disagreed, but directed the Commission to submit alternative revisions of the
ratio under relevant statutes and Guidelines. The Commission submitted reports in 1997 and
2002 recommending changes in the ratio, but neither proposal prompted congressional action.
The Commission did reduce the base offense levels associated with crack cocaine by two levels
in 2007, and it passed through Congress without any issue.

by way of statute; the DOJ and the Commission are in lock step. Consequently, this Court should
lower the base level applicable here by two levels.
Alternatively, should the Court wish to further note the evolution of this proposed
amendment, it may wish to consider the imminent March 13, 2014, Sentencing Commission
testimony to be presented in support of the amendment. In this case, Defendant would ask the
Court to continue sentencing until the late March or early April dockets.
There is no rational reason not to accomplish the congressional directives reflected
in the proposed amendment. Such a reduction would preserve scarce financial and judicial
resources. As stated above, the Attorney General and DOJ have noted the immense economic
burden and unsustainability of current incarceration levels. As reflected in the organic statute,
Congress agrees.
Moreover, one of the dictates of the Congressional mandate overriding all sentencing
concerns it that a sentence should not be greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of
sentencing. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The Sentencing Commission itself has decided a
sentence within the guideline range as set forth in this PSR is greater than necssary to
achieve the goals of sentencing. A reduction to a total offense level of 35, in criminal history
category range III, results in a guideline range in this case of 210 - 240 months.
In the alternative, the defendant moves to continue the sentencing until either after the
hearings in March, or after November 1, 2014, so that the defendant can get the benefit of this
reduction.

II. Using the purity of the methamphetamine exaggerates the sentencing range beyond the
purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 3553
The advisory imprisonment ranges for methamphetamine offenses seriously overstate the
seriousness of this particular offense conduct (and, for all practical purposes, the offense conduct
in most methamphetamine cases) because they call for higher offense levels and imprisonment
ranges for offenses involving pure methamphetamine when this factor is not indicative of higher
criminal culpability. It is the usual case that methamphetamine recovered by law enforcement
has 80 percent or higher purity level.15
Accordingly, there is nothing about the purity level of methamphetamine that reflects any
more serious level of culpability of a defendant such as the defendant in this case. This is
especially true in this case where the government has interpreted pure or actual
methamphetamine to include l-methamphetamine, which the government admits is not as
harmful as d-methamphetamine. The government’s laboratory analysis does not distinguish the
two different types of drugs, so we don’t know how much d-methamphetamine was present.
What has become the norm in methamphetamine cases is that virtually all defendants found
guilty of possessing methamphetamine are now subjected to drastically increased offense levels
as a result of the purity of the methamphetamine.
Post-Booker, district court’s have considerable discretion when determining the proper
sentence for a criminal defendant.16 Sentencing judges are now free to vary from a guideline

sentence based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the guidelines.17
District courts must “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,” to reflect the
factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).18 Moreover, 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(6) provides specifically
that:
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider — the
need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records
who have been found guilty of similar conduct.
Had no laboratory analysis as to purity been done in this case, the total offense level
would be four levels lower. At level 33, and at a criminal history category III, the resulting
advisory guideline imprisonment range would be168-210 months. With the new two level
reduction coming in November, as noted above, the advisory guideline imprisonment range
would be 121 to 151 months.
