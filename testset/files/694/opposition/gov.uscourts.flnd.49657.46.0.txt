SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiffs, ZACHARIAH KINSAUL and ALETA KINSAUL, through their counsel, file
their response in opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as follows:
I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

To successfully win this Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants must show that
“everything in the record . . . demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists.” Tippens
v. Celotex Corp., 805 F.2d 949, 952 (11th Cir. 1986). Genuine issues of fact are those where the
evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. See e.g.
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In
deciding whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the Court must accept the truth of

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Plaintiff’s allegations and evidence and “must draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s
favor.” Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1486 n.3 (11th Cir. 1996).
In Wright v. Southland Corporation, 187 F.3d 1287, 1305 (11th Cir. 1999), the Eleventh
Circuit overturned a grant of summary judgment against the plaintiff, emphasizing that
credibility determinations, such as believability of witnesses, “can be made only after trial,” and
not on a motion for summary judgment. In Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Florida, Inc., 196
F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999), the Court again emphasized that “in the summary judgment
context. . . [the court] must avoid weighing conflicting evidence or making credibility
determinations.”
Similarly, in Graham v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1282 (11th Cir.
1999), the Eleventh Circuit stated, “credibility determinations, the weighting of evidence, and the
drawing of inferences from the facts are the function of the jury . . .” See also Hilburn v. Murata
Electronics North America, Inc., 181 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 1999)(on a motion for summary
judgment, the court must “avoid weighing conflicting evidence and making credibility
determinations”, citing Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Publishing Co., 9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir.
1994)). “[F]actual disputes that are material preclude entry of summary judgment.” Stephens v.
City of Butler, Alabama, et al., 2007 WL 1834898 (S.D. Ala.); Pearson v. Byrd, 2007 WL
1321970 (M.D. Ala. 2007)(the disputed issues of fact prevent the court from determining
whether the defendants are protected by qualified immunity).
Based on the record evidence presented in this case, the Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Judgment should be denied.

III. FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS (COUNT II)
A.

PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS IN THIS CASE

Plaintiffs concede that they cannot meet the standard required to prove liability under 42
U.S.C. §1983 for the individually named Defendants, McWhite and McMillon. Plaintiffs
disagree with Defendant on the official capacity claim against the Defendant Sheriff and have
shown below that summary judgment should not be granted on that claim.
James Michael Kinsaul, the decedent, was a pretrial detainee, and as such, “[t]he
constitutional rights of a pretrial detainee . . . flow from both the procedural and substantive due
process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.”1 Hare v. City of Corith, Miss., 74 F. 3d 633,
639 (5th Cir. 1996)(citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447
(1979)); see also Lancaster v. Monroe County, 116 F. 3d 1419, 1425 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1997)(pretrial
detainee cases are covered by the Fourteenth Amendment). Prisoners have a constitutional right
“to be protected from self destructive tendencies,” including suicide. See Hall v. Ryan, 957 F.2d
402, 406 (7th Cir. 1992). Inmates also have an equal right to medical care for physical as well as
mental illness. See Riddle v. Mondragon, 83 F. 3d 1197, 1202 (10th Cir. 1996)(“The states have
a constitutional duty to provide necessary medical care to their inmates, including psychological
or psychiatric care.”). There is no distinction “between the right to medical care for physical ills

1

Whether this case is brought under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment is
unimportant, however, because the Eleventh Circuit has said that “the minimum standard for
providing medical care to a pre-trial detainee under the Fourteenth Amendment is the same as the
minimum standard required by the Eighth Amendment for a convicted prisoner.” Lancaster, 116
F. 3d at 1425.

and its psychological or psychiatric counterpart.” Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F. 2d 231, 234 (1st
Cir. 1991); see also Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F. 3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002)(“[T]he
duty to provide medical care encompasses detainees’ psychiatric needs” and recognizing that jail
administrators must “deal safely and effectively with the special challenges posed by the mentally
ill,” including provision of adequate mental health screening at intake).
To prove municipal liability in this cases, there is no subjective component and the
Plaintiffs need only show an objective risk of injury and a failure to train. City of Canton v.
Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). “Unlike the deliberate
indifference standards used to determine [officer liability] this standard [for municipal liability]
does not contain a subjective component.”2 Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F. 3d at 1195); see
also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 841 (distinguishing Canton’s objective standard from the subjective
standard applicable in individual liability cases).3
Deliberate indifference can be manifested by prison officials by intentionally denying or
delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.
Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-105, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Deliberate

2

The deliberate indifference standard for individuals is the same standard to be
applied to a county on the Plaintiffs’ denial of medical care and the failure to protect/train claims.
The standard is, however, applied differently to governmental entities in two significant ways.
First, the causation standard for governmental entities is articulated differently. Second, as
applied to an individual, Farmer instructs that the deliberate indifference standard is a subjective
standard requiring actual knowledge of a risk by the official. In the governmental liability
context, deliberate indifference is an objective standard which is satisfied if the risk is so obvious
that the governmental entity should have known of it. Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F. 3d 1299, 1308
n. 5 (10th Cir. 1998); Farmer, 511 U.S. at 840-42 (discussing Canton).
3

The objective component is met if the deprivation is “sufficiently serious.” Farmer
v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 F. Ed. 2d 811 (1994).
4

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 5 of 24

indifference is also shown when prison officials place inmates in a condition likely to cause a
serious health problem in the future. See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 32-33, 114 S. Ct.
2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993)(holding that prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment when
they expose a non-smoking inmate to a considerable amount of second-hand smoke, given the
health risks of doing so); Hunt v. Uphoff, 199 F. 3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1999)(“the Eighth
Amendment also protects against future harm to an inmate.”) In Farmer v. Brennan, the Supreme
Court applied this principle and held that prison officials have a duty under the Eighth
Amendment to take reasonable precautions to protect an inmate from future assault by other
inmates. See also Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F. 2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980)(applying Farmer and
holding that prison administrators had insufficiently trained staff to protect inmates from future
assault).
To satisfy the objective component, an inmate must show from objective facts that he is
“incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at
834. A serious medical need may include one that requires preemptive care in order to protect an
inmate against a future risk. See Helling, 509 U.S. at 32-33. Deliberate indifference rests
“somewhere between the poles of negligence at the one end and purpose or knowledge at the
other.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836. But deliberate indifference “does not require a finding of
express intent to harm.” Mitchell v. Maynard, 80 F. 3d 1433, 1443 (10th Cir. 1996).
Significantly, this level of intent can be proven through circumstantial evidence:
“Whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question
of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, including inference from
circumstantial evidence, and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a
substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.”

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 6 of 24

Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843.
Farmer holds that an Eighth Amendment inmate need only show that the risk of injury
was obvious and does not need to show that the defendant wanted the inmate to be injured by the
dangerous condition. “[A] prison official [may not] escape liability for deliberate indifference by
showing that, while he was aware of an obvious, substantial risk to inmate safety, he did not
know that the complainant” was likely to become a victim. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843.
Kinsaul committed suicide. Plaintiffs have proven that there was a policy by Defendant
Sheriff of not training his employees on suicide detection or prevention. [Plaintiff’s Statement of
Facts, ¶ 44].4 “Jail managers who decide to take no precautions against the possibility of inmate
suicide- to have no policy, for example no suicide watch option- are guilty of deliberate
indifference in the relevant sense, Manarite v. City of Springfield, 957 F. 2d 953, 957 (1st Cir.
1992); Greason v. Kemp, 891 F. 2d 829, 839 (11th Cir. 1990), they would be ignoring a known
and serious risk of death of persons under their control for whose safety they are responsible.”
Boncher v. Brown County, 272 F. 3d 484, 486 (7th Cir. 2001).
Defendant in the instant case maintained a policy to have no policy to protect against
inmate suicide which resulted in Kinsaul’s death. The ramifications of this policy were enhanced
when the Defendant routinely failed to book inmates when they first arrived at the jail [Plaintiff’s
Statement of Facts, ¶ 4] and allowed them to be placed in cells, including isolation cells, with
tools to commit suicide. The protection of inmates from themselves was one reason for
Defendant’s policy of not allowing belts in cells with inmates. [Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts, ¶s
4

The failure of a governmental entity to have adequate suicide prevention policies
in place is appropriately analyzed under the failure to train standard set forth in Canton. See
Liebe v. Norton, 157 F. 3d 575 (8th Cir. 1998).

5, 6, footnote 4]. If an official is aware of a substantial risk and “disregards the risk by failing to
take reasonable measures to abate it”, the trier of fact may infer deliberate indifference. Id. at
846.
B.

DEFENDANT SHERIFF’S LIABILITY

Defendant Young can be found liable under §1983 if Plaintiffs establish that Kinsaul’s
death was the result of: (1) Defendant’s policies or customs or (2) Defendant’s final
policymaker(s) acted with deliberate indifference to a constitutional deprivation, or (3)
Defendant’s final policymaker(s) delegated authority to a subordinate who, in turn, caused a
constitutional deprivation, or (4) Defendant’s final policymakers ratified a constitutionally
impermissible decision or recommendation of a subordinate employee. Sherrod v. Palm Beach
County School District, 424 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1344 (S.D. Fla. 2006).
1.

Failure to Train

Inmate suicide implicates both the state’s duty to provide medical care and its duty to
provide protection from harm, albeit self-inflicted. See Hare, 74 F. 3d at 644. Defendant Sheriff
and Major James Morgan, a chief policy maker by designation [Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts,
footnote 20], were the people exclusively responsible under Florida law for the management and
administration of the Gadsden County Jail.5 Consequently, they have a federal duty to provide
proper supervision over and to adequately train staff regarding inmate health and safety. See
Farmer, 511 U.S. 825. Prison officials have a duty to “take reasonable measures to guarantee the
safety of the inmates.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832 (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 5265

In Florida, the Sheriff is the policymaker and final authority for his agency.
Johnson v. Cannon, 947 F. Supp. 1567, 1571 (M.D. Fla. 1996)(citing Lucas v. O’Loughlin, 831
F. 2d 232, 235 (11th Cir. 1987)).

Filed 03/31/09 Page 8 of 24

27, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). This includes supervision and training of detention
officials who have a daily and direct impact on inmate health and safety. See Skinner v. Uphoff,
234 F.Supp.2d 1208, 1215 (D. Wyo. 2002)(holding that prison officials who had “consistently
ignored their responsibility to supervise and train their staff” in protecting inmate safety violated
the Eighth Amendment”.)
A §1983 action against a Sheriff’s Department may be premised on inadequate training
See Hood v. Itawaamba County, 819 F. Supp. 556, 561 (N.D. Miss. 1993), or the failure to adopt
a policy. Rhyne v. Henderson County, 973 F. 2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. 1992). “In other words, the
lack of formal policies may state a valid section 1983 claim.” Thornhill v. Breazeale, 88
F.Supp.2d 647, (S.D. Miss. 2000)(genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether county
jail’s lack of written policy relating to administering of CPR to detainees who attempted suicide,
and presence of cell with non-breakaway shower rod were reasonably related to legitimate
government interests, precluding summary judgment in survivors §1983 claim against county and
officials alleging due process violations based on detainee’s suicide).
Plaintiffs have proven in this case a custom and policy of inadequate training,
supervision, and discipline on the part of the Gadsden County Sheriff which led to the
constitutional deprivations visited upon the Plaintiffs’ decedent. To establish a claim under
§1983 against the Sheriff, the Plaintiffs must establish that (1) Kinsaul was deprived of a
constitutionally protected right, and (2) that a governmental policy or custom was the moving
force behind the constitutional violation. Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694,
98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 385. This includes customs
and usages which have become so persistent and widespread as to be permanent and well settled
8

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 9 of 24

so as to constitute a custom or usage with a force of law. Id. at 691.
To support a failure to train claim, a plaintiff must show that any failure to train by the
governmental entity reflects a deliberate or conscious choice to endanger constitutional rights.
City of Canton Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). An
adequate training program must “enable officers to respond properly to the usual and recurring
situations with which they must deal.” Brumfield v. Bryant, 2007 WL 2484952 at *4 (S.D. Miss.
2007).
In this instant case, there was a custom of no training on suicide detection on August 5,
2006 when James Michael Kinsaul was brought to the Gadsden County Jail. He had multiple
prior Baker and/or Myer’s Act commitments and had expressed the desire to commit suicide the
year before he was taken to Defendant’s jail. [Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts, ¶ 49]. Defendant
never ran his information on FCIC to determine his past criminal record and never completed a
medical assessment form to determine if he was ill. Defendant did nothing to determine if
Kinsaul was in need of medical treatment for a psychiatric condition and did nothing to
determine if he was suicidal. Instead, Defendant created the “perfect storm” for Kinsaul in that
he was in an unmonitored isolation cell without cell mates with a convenient and inviting tool for
committing suicide- his belt.
In certain circumstances, deliberate indifference may be found absent a pattern of
unconstitutional behavior if a violation of federal rights is a “highly predictable” or “plainly
obvious” consequence of a governmental entity’s action or inaction, such as when a
governmental entity fails to train an employee in specific skills needed to handle recurring
situations, thus presenting an obvious potential for constitutional violations. Board of County
9

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Commissioners v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 409-410, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997);
Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 & n. 10. With no training on the detection and identification of suicidal
inmates, Plaintiffs have shown by objective facts that Kinsaul was incarcerated under conditions
posing a substantial risk of serious harm. The systemic deficiencies in this regard demonstrate
that the Defendant Sheriff is deliberately indifferent to inmate medical needs. The Defendant
Sheriff had inadequate policies for medical screening and no policies on the detection and
prevention of suicide and Kinsaul is dead as a result. Defendant Sheriff has also inadequately
supervised and improperly trained staff regarding inmate medical/mental health needs in
violation of Kinsaul’s Fourteenth Amendment rights. These deficiencies exposed Kinsaul, who
was incarcerated in the Gadsden County Jail, to substantial risk of harm and demonstrates
deliberate indifference on the part of the Sheriff to Kinsaul’s Fourteenth Amendment Rights.
Genuine issues of material fact exist when a sheriff, as policymaker for the county, also
adopts a custom of allowing correctional officers complete discretion in how to run the day to
day operations of a jail. Brumfield, 2007 WL 2484952 at * 6. The court in Brumfield denied
summary judgment when the jail practiced customs of deliberate indifference toward inmates by
granting jailers discretion in determining whether or not to remove inmates’ shoelaces, to check
on the inmates in certain time intervals, or to affirmatively inquire into inmate’s medical state.
Id.
Defendant adopted a custom and practice of not booking inmates and not conducting
medical or suicide assessments on inmates. At the expense of inmate safety, Defendant Young
left jail employees to their own devices to improvise in the performance of their duties. This
policy of inadequate training is material to the determination of whether the policy was the
10

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 11 of 24

moving force behind the constitutional violation. See Bechtold v. Stearns County, MN, 2007 WL
2892568 at *7 (D.Minn. 2007)(summary judgment denied when jail officials never received
suicide prevention training).
A fact-finder may conclude that a defendant knew of a substantial risk of harm to an
inmate from the very fact that the risk was obvious. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 842, 114
S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Defendant is deliberately indifferent to the needs of
intoxicated pretrial detainees when it failed to take inexpensive measures to prevent jail suicides.
See Simmons v. City of Philadelphia, 947 F.2d 1042, 1071-75 (3rd Cir. 1991)(sufficient evidence
existed to support jury conclusion that the city’s deliberate indifference to the serious medical
needs of intoxicated detainees, as Monell requires, was the “moving force” behind a violation of
inmate Fourteenth Amendment rights, even where policy required removal of inmate belts,
placing detainees together in cells, and inmate checks every fifteen minutes); Thornhill, 88
F.Supp.2d at 652 (genuine issue of material fact found where jail had no written policies for the
detection and prevention of suicide and where plaintiff was housed in cell with a non-breakaway
shower rod); Terry v. Rice, 2003 WL 1921818 at * 23 (S.D. Ind. 2003)(summary judgment
denied when de facto suicide watch policies “were so inadequate as to amount to deliberate
indifference”).
Genuine issues of material fact remain that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that
Defendant violated Kinsaul’s constitutional rights through its deliberate indifference to his
medical needs and safety. Defendant engaged in a custom and practice that was wholly
inadequate to prevent suicides of jail inmates. Defendant Sheriff’s failure to train his jail
personnel caused the correctional officers to fail to book Kinsaul into the jail, to assess him for
11

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

suicidal tendencies, to remove his belt, and to properly observe him while in custody.
2.

Ratification

Without question, Sheriff Young and Major Morgan have final policy making authority.
Sheriff and Major Morgan ratified the actions and inactions of McMillon and McWhite. One
method of attributing conduct to the governmental entity is for a plaintiff to show that the policy
maker was aware of the subordinates’ unconstitutional actions and consciously chose to ignore them.
Amnesty Am. v. Town of West Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 126 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Sorlucco v. New
York Cit Police Dep’t., 971 F.2d 864, 870-71 (2d Cir. 1992)(stating that municipal liability lies
where the subordinate’s misconduct is “so manifest as to imply the constructive acquiescence of
senior policy-making officials”). Where a policy-making official exhibits deliberate indifference to
constitutional deprivations caused by subordinates, such that the official’s inaction constitutes a
“deliberate choice,” that acquiescence may “be properly thought of as a city ‘policy or custom’ that
is actionable under § 1983.” City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct.1197, 103
L.Ed.2d 412 (1989); see also Vann v. City of New York, 72 F.3d 1040, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995), Jeffes
v. Barnes, 208 F.3d 49, 63 (2d Cir. 2000)(holding that sheriff’s acquiescence in unconstitutional
retaliation could be inferred from his tolerance of harassment of plaintiffs).
A governmental entity may be held liable under §1983 where the responsible law
enforcement officer has “ratified” unconstitutional conduct by failing to investigate a citizen’s
complaints of constitutional violations. See Kimbrough v. City of Cocoa, 2006 WL 3335066, * 7
(M.D. Fla. 2007)(citing Marchese v Lucas, 758 F.2d 181, 187-88 (6th Cir. 1985)(court regarded the
“official policy” of the sheriff and the county as ratification of an assault by officers upon a prisoner
where sheriff did not engender serious investigation to discover the perpetrators or official sanction
12

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 13 of 24

against their conduct)).
Thus, under the ratification theory, a sheriff’s department’s failure to investigate may be
indicative of an official policy. Put another way, failing to investigate a claim of a constitutional
deprivation like that alleged here, i.e., the deprivation of medical care and suicide detection, may
permit an inference that the misconduct which injured the decedent was pursuant to an official policy
or custom. See Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1166-1167 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Watkins
v. City of Oakland, California, 145 F.3d 1087 (9th Cir. 1998)(Chief of Police held individually liable
on a supervisory theory of liability for ratifying police officer’s alleged use of excessive force when
he dismissed complaint against the officer despite evidence of constitutional violation); Larez v .
City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 645 (9th Cir. 1991)(upheld a jury verdict finding police chief
liable for ratifying the excessive use of force by officers under his command by signing a letter
denying citizen’s complaint when expert testimony showed that he should have disciplined the
officers); St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 127, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (U.S. 1988)(“.
. . when a subordinate's decision is subject to review by the municipality's authorized policymakers,
they have retained the authority to measure the official's conduct for conformance with their policies.
If the authorized policymakers approve a subordinate's decision and the basis for it, their ratification
would be chargeable to the municipality. . ..”)
In the instant case, Defendant Sheriff did not conduct any investigation into the actions of
McWhite and McMillon. In fact, the Sheriff and Morgan intentionally remained blind in spite of
overwhelming evidence of policy violations, coverups and outright lies. Pretending to conduct a full
investigation is like telling half of the truth. A half truth is a full lie.
The Eleventh Circuit has explicitly recognized and approved the ratification method of
13

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 14 of 24

proving official capacity claims under § 1983 in Mandel v. Doe, 888 F. 2d 783 (11th Cir. 1989). The
Court in Mandel recognized the ratification method of proving custom or policy: “the delegation of
final policymaking authority from one official to another and the ratification of a subordinate’s
actions by a final policymaker.” Id. (citing City of Oklahoma v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 834, 105 S.Ct.
2427, 2441, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985)(Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment)(“there may be many ways of proving the existence of a municipal policy or custom that
can cause a deprivation of a constitutional right.”).
The court in Mandel also discussed a number of Supreme Court cases in which alternative
theories were addressed holding local governments liable under § 1983 for a single decision by a
government policymaker. For example, in Pembaur v. City of Cincinatti, 475 U.S. 469 , 106 S.Ct.
1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986), the court upheld a finding of municipal liability based on a single
decision by a municipal policymaker. And in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.
Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988), in an effort to clarify when a decision on a single occasion may be
enough to establish an unconstitutional municipal policy, the Court reasoned that “[i]f the authorized
policymakers approve a subordinate’s decision and the basis for it, their ratification would be
chargeable to the municipality . . .” 108 S. Ct. at 926.
Based on Praprotnik and Pembaur, “municipal liability may attach to a single decision made
by a municipal official if that municipal official is the final policymaker for the municipality with
respect to the subject matter in question.” Mandel, 888 F.2d at 793. In Mandel, the court found that
a physician’s assistant was the final policymaker for the defendant with respect to the medical affairs
of a road prison. Id. at 794. Because he had been delegated this final policymaking authority, his
acts of deliberate indifference could be attributed to the defendant to establish municipal liability.

Id. Liability was found in Mandel even though there was only one incident to support the existence
of a governmental policy or custom because of the delegation of final policymaking authority from
one official to another and the ratification of a subordinate’s action by a final policymaker. Id. at
791. Thus, a single instance of deliberate indifference to subordinates’ actions can provide a basis
for municipal liability. See Mandel, 888 F.2d at 791.
In Kimbrough, the Court found that the City’s failure to investigate or to discipline the
conduct of its officers could support a claim of ratification. 2006 WL 3335066 at *8. The Court
held that the fact that no one was investigated nor reprimanded could be found to be evidence that
the City sanctioned the officer’s conduct and the reasons behind their actions. Id. In Marchese v.
Lucas, 758 F. 2d 181, 188 (6th Cir. 1985), the court concluded that where, after an assault on a
prisoner, there was no serious investigation to discover the perpetrators or official sanctions against
their conduct, there was ratification of the illegal acts by the Sheriff. And in Amnesty Am. v. Town
of West Hartford, 361 F. 3d at 126-27, the could held that because a single action on the part of a
policymaker was sufficient to create a municipal policy, then a single instance of deliberate
indifference to subordinates’ actions can provide a basis for municipal liability.
In the instance case, the Sheriff and Major Morgan, both policymaking officials, were aware
of their subordinate’s actions and consciously chose to ignore them, effectively ratifying their
actions. They knew that neither McMillon nor McWhite performed a suicide assessment of Kinsaul.
They did no investigation, however, to ever confirm any level of wrongdoing notwithstanding the
fact that Defendant’s policies required an Internal Affairs investigation. [Plaintiff’s Statement of
Facts, ¶ 34]. They knew that there were policy violations and refused to discipline both McMillon
and McWhite for their transgressions. Under these circumstances, there was ratification and liability

should attach to the Sheriff.
IV. NEGLIGENCE- COUNT I
A sheriff is charged with a higher degree of care for a prisoner’s safety and protection when
he is aware that a prisoner is intoxicated. Manual v. City of Jeanerette, 702 So.2d 709, 712 (La.App.
3 Cir. 1997). Kinsaul was intoxicated on August 5, 2006. Defendant Sheriff breached his
nondelagable duty of care in numerous ways. Defendant was negligent through a total failure to
enforce policies pertaining to the removal of inmate belts, and through a failure to properly train his
correctional officers in existing policies aimed at the safe pretrial detention of inmates. Defendant
Sheriff was negligent in the failure to conduct a medical assessment of the Plaintiff and in failing to
take his belt, both of which were violations of the Defendant’s policies. [Plaintiff’s Statement of
Facts, ¶s 1, 2, 3].
On Plaintiff’s negligence claims, the initial question is whether the Defendant owed Kinsaul
a duty of care. City of Pinellas Park v. Brown, 604 So. 2d 1222 (Fla. 1992); see also Lewis v. City
of St. Petersburg, 260 F. 3d 1260 (11th Cir. 2001)(“To state a claim for negligence under Florida law,
a plaintiff must allege that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, that the defendant
breached that duty, and that the breach caused the plaintiff to suffer damages.”). The issue of duty
is an question of law. McCain v. Florida Power Corp., 593 So.2d 500, 503 (Fla.1992).
A duty of care has been established in circumstances like those presented sub judice when
there is a “special relationship” existing between the individual and the governmental entity and/or
the harm is within a “foreseeable zone of risk.” Both a special relationship and a foreseeable zone
of risk have been proven here.

A. THE “SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP” TEST IS MET HERE
In Everton v. Willard, 468 So. 2d 936 (Fla. 1985), the court recognized that while a
police officer engaged in making arrests and enforcing the law will not ordinarily owe a duty of
care to any particular member of the public, if a special relationship exists between an individual
and a governmental entity engaged in a public function, there may be a duty of care owed to the
individual.6 The existence of special relationships or public policy considerations have also
given rise to non-delegable duties. See Sammons v. Broward Bank, 599 So.2d 1018, 1020 (Fla.
4th DCA 1992); Hinckley v. Palm Beach County Bd. of County Com'rs801 So.2d 193, 196 (Fla.
4th DCA 2001)(when the County undertook to provide transportation services to a
developmentally disabled person, it created a special relationship with her and a duty to protect
her from foreseeable harm which is non-delegable).
This test is met when there is a "special relationship" between the defendant and the
plaintiff, such that the plaintiff is entitled to protection. Liability has been found in custodial
relationships: Harris v. Monds, 696 So. 2d 446, 446 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997)(stating that a prisoner
who sustains injuries while incarcerated was owed a common-law duty of reasonable care based
on the nature of the custodial relationship); White v. Palm Beach County, 404 So. 2d 123 (Fla. 4th
DCA 1981)(“finding liability for violence and sexual abuse suffered by inmates in jail”); see also
Henderson v. City of St. Petersburg, 247 So. 2d 23 (Fla. 2d DCA 1971)(“finding liability for
injury to police informant after police knew he was in danger for cooperating with authorities”).
In Hartley v. Floyd, 512 So.2d 1022 (Fla. 1st DCA 1987), the sheriff was held to be liable
6

In Everton, the Florida Supreme Court recognized that “if a special relationship
exists between an individual and a governmental entity, there could be a duty of care owed to the
individual.” 468 So. 2d at 938.
17

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

when, at the request of a missing man's wife, a deputy agreed to do certain, specific tasks in an
effort to locate the husband. The deputy did not perform any of the tasks as a consequence of
which the husband died. The sheriff argued he could not be liable for a person's injuries unless he
owed a special duty to a person beyond the general duty owed the public at large. The First
District agreed that
"... [w]hile this is a correct statement of law[,] it is not applicable to the facts in this case
where[,] notwithstanding the absence of any preexisting special duty to Mrs. Floyd, the
sheriff's office agreed to perform certain activities at her request. Once again, having
assumed the undertaking[,] the sheriff's office had an obligation to carry it out with
reasonable care. The sheriff's deputy negligently failed to perform the assumed
responsibilities, and the sheriff can therefore be held liable for his negligence."
Id. at 1024.
Applying these legal principals to the instant case, the Defendant Sheriff cannot avoid
liability because it had a special relationship with Kinsaul due to the fact that he was in its
custody.
B. PLAINTIFF WAS WITHIN THE “FORESEEABLE ZONE OF RISK”
Kinsaul was incarcerated within the Defendant’s Jail when he committed suicide.
“Clearly, the sheriff and his [employees] owed the decedent the duty to use reasonable care for
his safety while he was incarcerated.” Hutchinson v. Miller, 548 So. 2d 883 (Fla. 5th DCA 1989).
Under Kaisner v. Kolb, 543 So. 2d 732 (Fla. 1989), a duty of care was also owed to Kinsaul
because he was within the “foreseeable zone of risk”.
In Kaisner, the Florida Supreme Court determined that a county could be liable to a
motorist who was pulled over by sheriff’s deputies and was injured when he was hit by traffic
while standing on the side of the road. The court conducted a two part analysis in determining

18

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 19 of 24

the government’s duty to the injured driver. First, the court determined that the injured party was
in custody7 and recognized that historically, a government has been held responsible if a party in
custody is injured as a result of governmental negligence. Second, the court stated that “[w]here
a defendant’s conduct creates a foreseeable zone of risk, the law generally will recognize a duty
placed upon defendant either to lessen the risk or see that sufficient precautions are taken to
protect others from the harm that the risk poses. We see no reason why the same analysis should
not obtain in a case in which the zone of risk is created by the police.” Id. at 735 (citations
omitted.)
Once Kinsaul was restrained of his liberty, he was in the “foreseeable zone of risk” and,
therefore, a duty of care was owed to him. Id.; see also Moore v. FWCC, 861 S. 3d at 1253
(once the plaintiff was restrained of his liberty, he was in the “foreseeable zone of risk” described
in Kaisner. “Therefore a duty of care was owed to the appellant.”); Mosby v. Harrell, 909 So. 2d
323, 327 (Fla. 1st DCA 2005)(discussing foreseeable zone of risk). “[T]he trial and appellate
courts cannot find a lack of duty if a foreseeable zone of risk more likely than not was created by
the defendant." McCain, 593 So.2d at 503.
After Kaisner, the supreme court addressed legal duty in a case involving a nongovernmental defendant in McCain, 593 So. 2d 500. In McCain, the court determined that a duty
7

In Kaisner, the Court concluded that “custody” should not be narrowly construed:

“The term ‘custody’ is defined as the detainer of a man’s person by virtue of lawful
process or authority. The term is very elastic and may mean actual imprisonment or
physical detention or mere power, legal or physical, of imprisoning or of taking manual
possession. We thus conclude that ‘custody’ need not consist of the formal act of an
arrest, but can include any detention.”
Id. at 734 (emphasis in original; citation omitted).
19

Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 46

Filed 03/31/09 Page 20 of 24

is owed to all persons who are within a foreseeable zone of risk created by the tortfeasor‘s
alleged wrongdoing.
The foreseeable zone of risk test was subsequently embraced by the Florida Supreme
Court again in City of Pinellas Park v. Brown, 604 So. 2d 1222 (Fla. 1992). Utilizing the
foreseeable zone of risk analysis of Kaisner and McCain, the court held that there was a duty to
the innocent bystanders. Id. at 1223, 1225-26, 1228; see also Henderson v. Bowden, 737 So.2d
532 (Fla.1999)(where a sheriff's deputy arrested a drunk driver and thereafter directed the driver's
equally intoxicated passenger who was not in custody, to drive the vehicle to a nearby Circle K
store to call his parents for a ride home, court imposed liability because the Sheriff's deputies had
placed the passengers of the car in danger by directing an intoxicated person to drive, and that
this direction, more likely than not, created a foreseeable zone of risk giving rise to a legal duty).
As the risk grows, so too does the duty, because the risk to be perceived defines the duty
of care to be undertaken. See City of Pinellas Park v. Brown, 604 So.2d 1222 (Fla.1992). The
risk in the instant case was placing Kinsaul into an isolated cell without any appreciable sight or
sound monitoring with his belt, a convenient tool for suicide. The risk was high and defines the
duty that the Sheriff had to prevent Kinsaul’s suicide.
An inmate suicide is a foreseeable consequence of the nonexistent and lackluster policies
and inadequate training described above and in Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts. As the court stated
in Crislip v. Holland, 401 So.2d 1115 (Fla. 4th DCA 1981):
In order for injuries to be a foreseeable consequence of a negligent act, it is not necessary
that the initial tortfeasor be able to foresee the exact nature and extent of the injuries or
the precise manner in which the injuries occur. Rather, all that is necessary in order for
liability to arise is that the tortfeasor be able to foresee that some injury will likely result
in some manner as a consequence of his negligent acts. (citations omitted).

Id. at 1117; see also Leib v. City of Tampa, 326 So.2d 52 (Fla. 2d DCA 1976); Budet v. K-Mart
Corp. 491 So.2d 1248, 1251 (Fla. 2d DCA 1986).
A resulting harm need only be within the scope of danger created by the defendant’s
negligent conduct to be reasonably foreseeable. Gibson v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, 386 So.2d
520 (Fla. 1980). If within the scope of danger created by the Defendant, summary judgment is
improper under the cases cited above. Importantly, the question of foreseeability and whether an
intervening cause is foreseeable is for the trier of fact. Id.
Despite the Defendant’s attempt to distinguish Overby v. Wille, 411 S. 2d 1331 (Fla. 4th
DCA 1982), the facts are remarkably similar to those of the instant case. In Overby, the deceased
was placed into an isolation cell because of his belligerency and outward aggression. Id at 1332.
He was in his street clothes and had a belt that he ultimately used to commit suicide. Id. The
issue was whether the decedent’s act of self-destruction was an independent intervening cause
which was not reasonably foreseeable. The trial court found as a matter of law that the question
should be answered in the affirmative and the Fourth District reversed. Id. “Only a total absence
of evidence to support an inference that the intervening cause was foreseeable justifies the court
in removing the question from the trier of fact.” Id. The Court in Overby found that the question
was “whether the trier of fact could find, on the evidence and the permissible inferences to be
drawn from that evidence, that it was reasonably foreseeable that harm would befall to [the
deceased] either directly or indirectly as a result of the actions and omissions of the respective
defendants.” Id. at 1333.
In the instant case, there is sufficient evidence of policy violations and lies to cover those
violations for a trier of fact to find that it was reasonably foreseeable that Kinsaul may commit
21

suicide if his belt was not removed. Defendant Sheriff violated his own policies, as well as the
Florida Model Jail Standards, which the Sheriff adopted as his own. Courts have consistently
held that a violation of internal policy and procedure manuals or industry standards is evidence of
negligence. See Marks v. Mandel, 477 So.2d 1036, 1039 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985)(trial court erred in
excluding from evidence hospital’s emergency room policy and procedure manual as evidence of
a general industry custom or evidence that the defendant violated its own policy or an industry
standard); Clements v. Boca Aviation, Inc., 444 So.2d 597 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984); Dean Witter
Reynolds, Inc v. Hammock, 489 So.2d 761, 767 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986)(evidence of violation of
brokerage firm’s in-house regulations was admissible as evidence of negligence); St. Louis-San
Francisco Ry. Co. v. White, 369 So.2d 1007 (Fla. 1st DCA 1979)(violation of statute requiring
placing of crossbucks at all crossings was evidence of negligence); see also DeJesus v. Seaboard
Coast Line R. Co., 281 So.2d 198, 201 (Fla. 1973)(Court ruled that a violation of any statute
which establishes a duty to take precautions to protect a particular class of persons from a
particular type of injury is negligence per se).8
Significantly, had the belt removal policy at issue here been followed, Kinsaul would
likely be alive today. These policies were designed to prevent the precise harm that occurred
here and Plaintiffs have offered evidence that it was reasonably foreseeable that death could
8

The fact that there were no policy violations in Guice v. Enfinger, 389 So.2d 270
(Fla. 1 DCA 1980), is one of several facts that distinguishes it from the instant case. Another
distinguishing fact is that in Guice, the deceased was expected to bond out that day. There is
quite a different situation sub judice where Kinsaul learned an hour or so before his death that he
had a “no bond” order and was not leaving the jail. Unlike the facts in Guice, the record here
illustrates a stream of actions showing the inattention to Kinsaul and that his demise could likely
flow from learning that he was not getting out of jail. Importantly, even though Grice has not
been overruled, the law in more recent years, outlined above, has developed more consistent with
the holding in Overby rather than Grice in the area of foreseeability.

result from a violation thereof. Preventing self-inflicted harm was one reason that these policies
existed. [Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts, footnote 4].
V. NEGLIGENT TRAINING AND SUPERVISION - COUNT III
Defendant claims that is has sovereign immunity for the claims in Count III. However,
the law clearly shows that there is no legal barrier to making a claim against a governmental
agency for negligent supervision and training. Dickinson v. Gonzalez, 839 So. 2d 709, 713 (Fla.
3d DCA 2003); see also School Bd. of Orange County v. Coffey, 524 So.2d 1052, 1053 (Fla. 5th
DCA 1988); Mosby v. Harrell, 909 So.2d 323, 330 (Fla. 1st DCA 2005). A negligent training and
supervision claim against a governmental entity is actionable when those charged with a duty of
care take no action to ensure the safety of those for whom it cares. See Slonin v. City of West
Palm Beach, Fla., 896 So.2d 882, 884 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005)(claim against defendant for negligent
supervision and retention was not barred by sovereign immunity). Defendant Young breached
his duty to Kinsaul, an inmate, by failing to train and supervise his correctional officers on
suicide prevention and on the removal of dangerous instrumentalities, such as belts.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, summary judgment against the Defendant Sheriff should
be denied on all Counts.
