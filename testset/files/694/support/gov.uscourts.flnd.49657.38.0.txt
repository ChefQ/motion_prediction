and Memorandum of Law.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

On August 5, 2006, tragically, James Kinsaul committed suicide while detained at
the Gadsden County Jail only five hours and thirty minutes after arriving there. Plaintiff
alleges and Defendants accept the representation in the Complaint at Paragraphs 13 and
16 that he was delivered by the Havana Police Department at 6:05 a.m. (Depo. of
MeMillon, p. 9) and that he was discovered at 11:35 a.m. that day having used his leather
belt to asphyxiate himself using his own body weight to cut off air flow to his lungs.

Earlier that day, Officer Shawn Pye of the Havana Police Department arrested Mr.
Kinsaul for malicious mischief when he damaged the vehicle of the Havana Police Chief.
When Pye brought Mr. Kinsaul to the jail, Kinsaul, though not falling down drunk, was
under the influence of alcohol. (Depo. of Pye, p.29-30) Initially McMillon put Kinsaul in
holding cell 150 where he got into an argument with a fellow detainee named Zale Baker.
(Depo. of McMillon p. 13-14). McMillon moved Kinsaul to a different cell where Kinsaul
could be secured, and could get some sleep to "sleep some of his intoxication away."
(Depo. of McMillon p. 15).

Kinsaul was not booked at this time. Personal items, such as his belt, were not
removed. (Depo. of McMillon, p. 15). The initial booking evaluation and screening was
postponed except to indicate that Kinsaul was under the influence of alcohol. (Depo. of
McMillon, p. 27). McMillon did not even prepare a property receipt (nor take his property)

because his review of the charges suggested he would be bonding out quickly. (Depo. of
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 Filed 03/05/09 Page 3 of 13

McMillon, p. 28-29). McMillon's shift ended at 7:00 a.m. (Depo. of McMillon, p. 8) and he
went home. (Depo. of McMillon, p. 13).

At 6:45, McMillon checked on Kinsaul and observed him to be asleep with a blanket
over his head. McMillon wrote "at any time did Kinsaul threaten his life to me." (Exhibit 17,
to McMillons depo.). Since then by Affidavit, Deputy McMillon has clarified that his
intended meaning by the remark was that "not at anytime did Kinsaul threaten to take his
own life." (Exhibit 1 - Affidavit of McMillon) For this involvement over a 55 minute period,
McMillon is sued personally.

For the next three hours and two minutes until 9:47 a.m., which was about sixty
percent of the whole time he was at the Gadsden County Sheriff's Office, Mr. Kinsaul slept.
He was awakened in his cell by co-defendant Jozelle McWhite. He was then taken to First
Appearances before Circuit Judge Hankinson. At that hearing, Judge Hankinson initiated
a hold for violations of probation. Mr. Kinsaul would not be posting bond and going home
that moming as expected. (Depo. of McWhite, p. 48- Exhibit 13, Exhibit 15) Kinsaul
returned to the jail at approximately 11:14 a.m. (Depo. of McWhite, p. 70).

McWhite gave phone calls to all those attending first appearances, including Mr.
Kinsaul. She described his behavior during the phone cail as "normal" and she recalls him
encouraging whoever was on the other end of the receiver to come see him. He asked to
use the restroom, was permitted to do so, and responded "yes" when asked if he wanted
to eat. He inquired whether there was anything to drink. (Depo. of McWhite, p. 70). Five
minutes later, when McWhite returned to the cell to complete booking of Mr. Kinsaul, she

saw Kinsaul had used his beit to "hang" himself. (Depo. of McWhite - Exhibit 11). Heroic
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 Filed 03/05/09 Page 4 of 13

efforts to save the life of Mr. Kinsaul began immediately. (Depo. of McWhite, p. 83-87).
She too is sued individually and personally.

No person placed any defendant on notice that Plaintiff was likely to harm or attempt
to harm himself. In addition to the reporting by the Defendants that Kinsaul never hinted
at his intentions, Kinsaul never said he would harm himself to Havana Police or his family
members. (Depo. of Officer Pye, p.36-37). Zachariah Kinsaul has never thought his
brother was suicidal, and was unaware of any previous suicide attempts. (Depo. of
Zachariah Kinsaul, p. 48). Though his brother James had reported he would never go back
to jail, Zachariah Kinsaul did not pass that information along to officials at the Gadsden
County Sheriff's Office and he was shocked by the suicide. (Depo. of Zachariah Kinsaul,
p. 55).

His sister Aleta, the co-personal representative of the estate, suspected that her
brother might have been a suicide risk and may have attempted suicide one time some
thirty years before, (Depo. of Aleta Kinsaul, p. 20,24) but she did not tell anyone at the
Gadsden County Sheriffs Office about her concerns or suspicions. (Depo. of Aleta
Kinsaul, p. 25).

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Plaintiff brings three causes of action against the Defendants. Count II alleges civil
rights violations against all Defendants. Itis sandwiched by Counts | and II1. Count! seeks
to impose liability solely against Sheriff Young for "Negligence." Count | alleges Sheriff
Young is derivatively liable for the negligence of his employees and agents. Count Ill is

more of a direct action against the Sheriff for his own "negligence" in purportedly failing to
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 _ Filed 03/05/09 Page 5 of 13

train and supervise his jail employees. It is only Count I! which confers subject matter
jurisdiction on this Court and will be addressed first.

FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS
(COUNT II)

Plaintiff seeks to impose liability on the Sheriff and two of his correctional officers,
McMillon and McWhite. In order to impose constitutional liability on the Sheriff for self-
harm, the Plaintiff must plead and prove the following two elements:

a) That actions or inactions by the Defendant evinced, not mere negligence, but
deliberate indifference to a known risk of suicide;

b) That a custom, policy or practice that evinced that deliberate indifference to
a known risk of suicide was the moving force, or cause in fact, of the death.

Defendant Young has raised the following two significant defenses:

SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
"As a Second and separate Affirmative Defense, specifically
directed to Count Il of the Complaint, the allegations as
described in the Complaint could reflect at worst, mere
negligence, and as such, Plaintiffs claim is not cognizable or
compensable under Title 42 U.S.C. 0x00A71983."
TENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

"As a Tenth and separate Affirmative Defense, the Complaint
fails to state a cause of action in that there is no allegation that
any defendant was aware in advance of Plaintiff's decedent's
suicidal tendencies and, in the absence of notice, no duty to

prevent a suicide exists."

The individual Defendants (McMillon and McWhite) raised this additional relevant
affirmative defense.

 

' This was raised as McMillon's and McWhite's Eighth Affirmative Defense as well.
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 Filed 03/05/09 Page 6 of 13

SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

`As a Second and separate Affirmative Defense, specifically
directed fo Count Il of the Complaint, neither McMillon nor
McWhite acted in a manner which was contrary to clearly
established law which either would be expected to know or
apply under the circumstances. Accordingly, both McMillon and
MecWhite are each afforded the defense of qualified immunity
from suit."

Young respectfully suggests that the undisputed material facts do not, as a matter
of law, allow for an inference to be drawn that the Sheriff, through his deputies, or the
deputies themselves, did anything which evinced a deliberate indifference to the risk of
suicide. Therefore, inquiry into the question of causation by policy, custom, or practice
need not be made. This is because if a person has suffered no constitutional injury at the
hands of individual police officers, whether departmental regulations may have authorized
such conduct is quite beside the point. City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 89 L.
Ed 2d 806, 106 S. Ct. 157, (1986).

More recently, the Eleventh Circuit observed in Rooney v. Watson, 107 F. 3d 1378
(11" Cir. 1996) " an inquiry into a governmental! entity's custom or policy is only relevant
when a constitutional deprivation has occurred." Rooney at 1387.

Returning to the essentia! threshold issue, the question is whether the failure to
prevent the suicide of a person less than six hours after being brought to a jail without that
person expressing suicidal ideation while detained, reflects a deliberate indifference to a
suicide risk.

The burden is on the Plaintiff and "this is a difficult burden for the Plaintiff to meet".

Popham v. City of Talladega, 908 F. 2d 1561 (11" Cir. 1990) teaches that "the standard
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 Filed 03/05/09 Page 7 of 13

requires a strong likelihood rather than a mere possibility that self-infliction of harm will
occur and will not be found to exist in the face of negligence only". (Emphasis added).
Also see Edwards v. Gilbert, 867 F. 2d 1271, (11" Cir. 1989), State Bank of St. Charles v.
Camic, 712 F. 2d 1140, (7" Cir. 1983), Stewart v. Love, 696 F. 2d 43 (60x00B0 Cir. 1982). "The
mere opportunity for suicide, without more, is clearly insufficient to impose liability on those
charged with the care of prisoners." Tittle v. Jefferson County Commissioners, 10 F. 3d
1535, 1540 (11" Cir. 1994). To hold otherwise would be to impose a rule of absolute
liability for the suicide of any person who succeeded in doing away with themselves who
did not have a personal bodyguard 24 hours a day.

Undersigned counsel has been able to identify two cases from this federal circuit
wherein an inmate suicide (after a reported verbal threat of suicide) led to attempts to
impose liability for a constitutional tort..

In Heags v. Grant, 73 F. 3d 317 (11" Cir. 1996), a woman was arrested for public
drunkenness. During initial screening, Heggs gave mixed messages. Though she denied
having suicidal tendencies, she threatened to kill herself when it came time to be placed
inacell. This comment went up the administrative chain. While how to respond was being
considered, Heggs recanted. Ultimately, and without any evaluation by any mental health
professional, Heggs was placed in a single cell and allowed to retain her clothing. She
hung herself with her socks. In rejecting the civil rights claim at the dispositive motion
stage, the court concluded that the constitution did not require Sheriff's officials to do

anything more than they had done.
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 Filed 03/05/09 Page 8 of 13

More recently, the Eleventh Circuit decided Cagie v. Southerland, 334 F. 3d 980
(11" Cir. 2003), which sprang from a suicide in the Warren County, Alabama Jail. The
decedent was arrested and commented that his girlfriend recently killed herself at the
Carbon Hill City Jail. This indirect but intuitive expression of suicidal thinking was reported

directly to detention personnel by the arresting officer.

The decedent also claimed that he would kill himself if he stayed in jail all
night. No mental health professional was consulted. Instead, the decedent was
placed in a cell by himself, though a peephole between the cells allowed the inmates
to monitor each other. The court concluded that, though the department was aware
of a threat of suicide and did nothing to evaluate the risk posed by the threat, and
placed the decedent in a one man cell without direct observation, this was an
insufficient basis to infer the death resulted from deliberate indifference to a known
serious threat of suicide. Final Judgment for the Defendants was entered.

Each of the fact patterns described above and determined not to violate
constitutionally imposed duties were far more worthy of criticism than the actions of
Officials at the Gadsden County Sheriffs Office. This successful suicide attempt
occurred without warning or notice. Plaintiffs decedent's actions in encouraging
visitors to come visit and seeking food are counter-indicators of an intention to do
harm. His entire period of detention was brief. McMillon's and McWhite's contact
with him were only small portions of that small time he was detained there. Deputy

McWhite undertook heroic efforts to preserve the life she is accused, appallingly, of
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 _ Filed 03/05/09 Page 9 of 13

having been deliberately indifferent to. The Defendants are each entitled to
Summary Final Judgment on Count | and, accordingly, each so moves.

STATE LAW CLAIMS
(COUNT Ill NEGLIGENT TRAINING AND SUPERVISION)

Plaintiff claims Sheriff Young breached a duty to train and supervise which
purportedly was the proximate cause of Mr. Kinsaul's death (Please see [s 44, 45 and
46 of the Complaint). Young raised key affirmative defenses which focused on Count lil:

FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

`As a Fifth and separate Affirmative Defense, Defendant
Young is sovereignly immune from liability as to ail allegations
concerning negligence in the hiring, training, supervision,
discipline, or overall operations of the Gadsden County
Sheriffs Office because such activities are reflective of
discretionary policy making activity and cannot form the basis
for the imposition of liability in tort against a political subdivision
of the State of Florida."

Sheriff Young's training and supervision protocols and practices concerning suicide
prevention are not a basis for imposing tort liability. In Cook v. Sheriff of Monroe County,
402 F.3d 1092 (11" Cir. 2005), a Plaintiff brought a negligent training and supervision
claim, along with a constitutional claim against Sheriff Roth of Monroe County, Florida after
a pre-trial detainee successfully committed suicide three days following his arrest and two
days after he requested to see a psychologist. Plaintiff's expert criticized Sheriff Roth's
suicide prevention training procedures as being unclear and inadequate, that the Sheriff

failed to conduct a necessary, mental health and suicide assessment and, among others,

that the supervision deployed was "grossly insufficient to prevent jail hangings."
Case 4:08-cv-00159-SPM-WCS Document 38 _ Filed 03/05/09 Page 10 of 13

Deciding that to permit actionability for claimed shortcomings in training or
supervision "would amount to judicial intervention, by way of tort law, into the fundamental
decision making of the legislative and executive branches", the court rejected this theory

of liability. Cook, at 1118.

COUNT |
NEGLIGENCE

The Sheriff raised as his first affirmative defense to the claim that Young is
responsible for the negligent acts of his employees the following:
FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

"As a First Affirmative Defense, Defendant Young did not
cause the death of James Michael Kinsaul in that his death
was by suicide and it was an intervening, superceding cause
which was, as a matter of law, not legally foreseeable."

Florida's District Courts of Appeal have had the opportunity to consider these
issues in the context of jail suicides in the past. First, in Guice v. Enfinger, 389 So
2d 270 (10x00B0 DCA, 1980), the District Court concluded that a prisoner suicide by
hanging was not caused by the Sheriff of Santa Rosa County though , on the night
of the arrest, jailors failed to remove the belt of an intoxicated arrestee. He was
placed in a single cell, and checked on periodically. The trial court's determination
that the suicide was an independent intervening cause was affirmed because under
the circumstances where the decedent had not threatened or attempted suicide in
the past, had demonstrated no overt suicidal tendencies, and circumstances
indicated an expedited release, the death was not legally foreseeable. The court
framed the relevant test thusly:
