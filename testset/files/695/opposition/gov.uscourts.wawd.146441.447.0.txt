I. RELIEF REQUESTED

16

Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny all the defendants’ requested relief.

17

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

18

On November 20, 2009, judgment was entered in this case after a jury verdict in favor of

19
20

the plaintiffs. Following entry of the judgment, the self-described “lone ‘non-conforming’ juror”

21

sent a letter to the Court detailing her disappointment in the result. On December 18, both

22

defendants filed motions for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 59, substantially based on

23

a declaration the defendants wrote for the disgruntled juror.
III. ISSUES

24
25

1.

Can an inadmissible declaration from a single disgruntled juror be used to
impeach the jury’s verdict?

2.

Is it proper to overturn a well-supported jury verdict simply because the jury
found plaintiffs’ evidence more credible than the defendants’?

3.

Should the Court reverse itself on each and every of its substantive
evidentiary rulings that was objectionable to the defendants, and thereby order a
new trial?

4.

Is a new trial warranted when the Court correctly instructed the jury on
Washington law, or when the defendants did not request a damages
apportionment
at trial?

3

5.

Is a new trial warranted where a single allegedly improper statement made
in closing argument was cured by a contemporaneous instruction from the
Court?

6.

Is a new trial warranted where the defendants fail in their heavy burden to
overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality that applies to the
Legislature’s preservation of the long-standing common law principle of joint and
several liability for asbestos-injury cases?

7.

Is remittitur proper where the damages assessment is supported by substantial
evidence?

IV. EVIDENCE RELIED UPON
Plaintiffs rely upon the Declaration of Cameron O. Carter in Support of Plaintiffs’

10
Consolidated Opposition to Defendant’s Motions for New Trial or Remittitur, the exhibits
11
attached thereto, and the pleadings and papers on file herein.
12
V. ARGUMENT
13
There is no basis to overturn the jury’s findings in this case, all of which are supported by
14
substantial evidence. The defendants’ motions are baseless challenges to a verdict they do not
15
like, based substantially on ill-gotten and inadmissible evidence.
16
Plaintiffs do not concede that any information contained within the declaration signed by
17
the rogue juror is accurate beyond the recitation of her name, location of signing, and that she
18
served in this case. This juror, as the lone holdout for the defendants during deliberations,
19
presents as the classic disgruntled juror determined to get the last word in deciding who was
20
“right” and who was “wrong,” taking pains to catalog all the areas where the other members of
21
the jury “just didn’t get it” in her un-invited letter correspondence to the court.
22
Notably her detailed (though error-riddled and confused) letter correspondence omits the
23
information set forth in the subsequent declaration. She signed a declaration clearly written by
24
defense counsel or their representatives.
25
While there is no local or Ninth Circuit rule absolutely prohibiting unsupervised post26
verdict juror contact, such unsupervised contacts “are not looked on favorably in this circuit.”

1100 (9th Cir. 1972) (improper and unethical for lawyers to interview jurors to discover their

3

course of deliberation), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 880 (1972).1 Notwithstanding these efforts by the

4

defendants, even if Mrs. Lockwood’s vague (intentionally or otherwise) recollections are

5

assumed to be accurate, they are completely excluded by the rules of evidence and cannot serve

6

as grounds for a new trial.

7

A.

There is No Competent Evidence to Support the Defendants’ Allegations of
Juror Misconduct

8
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) directly addresses a juror acting as a witness to impeach the validity
9

of a verdict.2 The rule’s proscriptions are founded in concerns for juror privacy and in

10
insulating the manner in which the jury reached its verdict from collateral attack. Exclusion of
11
evidence relating to internal juror misconduct promotes the strong public interest in the finality
12
of judicial process, a juror’s ability to engage in frank discussions and to return an unpopular
13
verdict, and the trustworthiness of the jury system. Tanner v. U.S., 483 U.S. 107 (1987).
14
The rule draws a dividing line between inquiry into the thought processes of the jurors
15
and inquiry into the existence of conditions or the occurrence of events calculated to exert an
16
improper influence on the verdict. The purpose of the rule is to preserve the integrity of jury
17
deliberations by confining claims of error to events or conditions that are improperly brought to
18
the jury’s attention and that involve a calculated, intentional attempt to affect the outcome. U.S.
19
v. Brooks, 677 F.2d 907, 913-914 (D.C. Cir. 1982). This rule states in relevant part:
20
21
22
23
24
25
26

Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict . . . a juror may not testify as to any
matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury’s deliberations or to
the effect of anything upon that or any other juror’s mind or emotions as
influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict . . . or concerning a
juror’s mental processes in connection therewith. But a juror may testify about
(1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the
jury’s attention, (2) whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear
upon any juror, or (3) whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the
verdict form. A juror’s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror may
not be received on a matter about which the juror would be precluded from
testifying.
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) (emphasis added).

27

In this regard it is worth recalling the effort the Court and attending Law Clerk took to limit even
supervised post-trial contact with the jurors inside the courthouse.

Surprisingly, neither defendant deigned to cite the Court to this governing authority.

1

To obtain a new trial because of a juror’s erroneous answer to voir dire questions, a party

2

must: (1) demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire; and

3

then (2) show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.

4

McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (1984). The defendants make

5

two allegations of juror dishonesty: (1) a juror’s alleged failure to disclose her own cancer

6

diagnosis during voir dire; and (2) the alleged failure of some vague number of the deliberating

7

jurors to disclose during voir dire their alleged bias against Asten because of Boeing’s decision

8

to locate new manufacturing facilities in Asten’s home state of South Carolina. (Dkt. #396 at 5-

9

6).

10

To support these allegations, the defendants submitted a declaration signed by juror

11

Lockwood. Dkt. #387 at 17; Dkt. # ). The declaration explicitly states that the “statements”

12

supposedly recalled by Lockwood were made during the course of the jury’s deliberations, and

13

exclusively concerned the “mental processes” of the jury.

14

The plain language of Rule 606(b) prohibits the Court from considering this declaration

15

in its entirety. The declaration Lockwood signed states that the two statements upon which the

16

defendants rely were “statements occurring during the course of the jury’s deliberations”

17

(i.e.,”This was brought up during our deliberations” Dkt. #387 at 18, ¶ 6. Lockwood’s

18

conjectures about the effect on the jury of Boeing’s move are pure speculation about “other

19

juror’s mind or emotions” and the jury’s “mental processes” in rendering its verdict (i.e., “The

20

issue of Boeing moving the 787 production line to South Carolina . . . must have been in the

21

jury’s mind during deliberations.” Dkt. #387 at 18, ¶ 7 (emphasis added). It is precisely this

22

type of information that Rule 606(b) was intended to address.

23
24

For this reason, the declaration must be excluded. Absent evidence of juror dishonesty
misconduct, the defendants fail to meet the first prong of the McDonough test.

25

1.

There Can Be No Dishonest Response to a Question Not Asked

26

Even if the Court considers the defendants’ allegations that an unidentified juror failed to

27

reveal her cancer diagnosis in voir dire, they again fail to pass the first prong of the McDonough

28

test, because there cannot be a dishonest response to a question that was not asked.

dishonesty regarding cancer is in fact a grievous compounding of three questions, each

modifying the one that preceded it.

Q.

I need to find out, just like I talked to Ms. Maghie, is there anybody here
that has had any experience with cancer in your life? I am not going to go
into the details about it, but a close friend, a relative, perhaps yourself, has
had an experience with cancer that you feel like, when you start hearing
about someone suffering from cancer and getting chemotherapy, and
having the symptoms and problems that go along with that, that you are
going to be so overwhelmed, feeling for the plaintiff, that you are just
going to say, I really feel like Mr. Barabin should get some money no
matter what? Anybody have any experience like that?

Dkt. #396, 4:12.
In its entirety, this question could be logically interpreted to require disclosure only by those

10

persons: (1) who had an “experience” of cancer in their life (personally, or through a friend or

11

relative) and (2) because of that experience will find for the plaintiff (3) no matter what.

12
13

What defense counsel intended to ask or intended to elicit from the venire is irrelevant.

14

“When voir dire questions can be logically interpreted to mean something else to a juror, then a

15

literal non-disclosure on another reading of the question cannot be assumed merely for failure to

16

answer the question according to its intended meaning. U.S. v. Robbins, 500 F.2d 650, 652 (5th

17

Cir. 1974) (emphasis added).

18

The defendants bear the consequences of their imprecise questions to the venire. Jurors

19

cannot be faulted for failing to disclose information when they were never asked during the

20

course of voir dire to make such disclosures. Gov’t of the Virgin Islands v. Sampson, 94

21

F.Supp.2d 639, 651 (D.V.I App. Div. 2000). Failure to volunteer un-asked information does not

22

suffice to satisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. U.S. v. Glenn Holck, Stephen Umbrell,

23

398 F.Supp.2d 338, 360 (E.D. Penn. 2005).
The facts of Sampson are instructive. Following conviction, Sampson moved for a new

24
25

trial after his lawyer learned a juror was employed by the government as its supervising

26

enforcement officer for the Virgin Islands Department of Finance. See generally Sampson, infra.

27

During voir dire, the venire was asked only two pertinent questions about their employment.

Is there anyone on the panel who is currently employed by any law
enforcement agency of the federal government, that is, the office - for
example, such as the office of the United States Attorney, the post office
department, the U.S. Customs and that would be - let me narrow that
question - employed by any department that is concerned with criminal
prosecution or law enforcement?

Id. at 651 (emphasis in original).

7

The trial court found that “the questions, as posed, did not require the juror to disclose

8

that he was a peace officer for the Government of the Virgin Islands,” and the appellate court

9

agreed. Id. The same logic applies here.

10

As posed, the questions cited by defense counsel did not require any juror to disclose

11

their personal medical condition. The venire was asked if they had an experience with cancer

12

that affected their impartiality. The venire was not asked if they had an experience with cancer.

13

No fair reading of the record can reveal a dishonest answer to the cited inquiry.

14

The defendants cannot assert that a juror gave an incomplete or dishonest answer to a

15

question that was never asked. Because the defendants make no showing of juror dishonesty,

16

objective or otherwise, their arguments fail to pass the first prong of the McDonough test and

17

their motions for a new trial on this ground must fail.

18

2.

Personal Experiences Are Not “Extraneous Prejudicial Information” or “Outside
Influence”

19
Ordinarily, a verdict will not be upset on the basis of a juror’s post-trial report of what
20
occurred in the course of deliberations. See McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267 (1915). Post21
verdict affidavits submitted to show that jurors discussed their own personal experiences with
22
issues similar to those at issue in the trial are inadmissible under Fed.R. Evid. 606(b) for that
23
purpose because a juror’s discussion of personal experience cannot constitute “extraneous
24
prejudicial information.”
25
[Extraneous prejudicial information] has been construed to cover publicity
received and discussed in the jury room, consideration by the jury of evidence not
admitted in court, and communications or other contact between jurors and third
persons, including contacts with the trial judge outside the presence of defendant
and his counsel. By contrast, evidence of discussions among jurors, intimidation
or harassment of one juror by another, and other intra-jury influences on the
verdict is within the rule, rather than the exception, and is not competent to
impeach a verdict.

Gereau, 523 F.2d 140, 149-50 (3d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 917, (1976))
The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly recognized, “Jurors must rely on their past personal

experiences when hearing a trial and deliberating on a verdict.” Hard v. Burlington Northern
Railroad, 812 F.2d 482, 486 (9th Cir. 1987). Factual similarity, personal familiarity, and
personal knowledge of issues similar to those at issue in a case generally do not qualify as
exceptions to the evidentiary bar of Rule 606(b). U.S. v. Hortensia Navarro-Garcia, 926 F.2d
818, 821 (9th Cir. 1991) (“A juror’s past personal experiences may be an appropriate part of the
jury’s deliberations. Inevitably, jurors must rely on their past personal experiences when hearing
a trial and deliberating on a verdict.”).
In Grotemeyer v. Hickman, 393 F. 3d 871 (9th Cir. 2004), the court found that the

11

14
15
16
17
18
19
20

statements of the jury foreperson, a medical doctor, were not “extrinsic evidence,” and therefore
consideration of her alleged statements as grounds for a new trial was barred by Rule 606(b).
The foreperson was alleged to have told the deliberating jury that she (1) “‘had been through this
before’ and that Mr. Grotemeyer was indeed guilty of the charges; (2) referring to her medical
expertise, that ‘Mr. Grotemeyer was either mentally ill or retarded and that his condition caused
Mr. Grotemeyer to commit the crime for which he was charged;’ (3) went on to say that ‘an
insanity defense should have been mounted;’ and (4) ‘assured [the affiant] that if the jury voted
to convict, Mr. Grotemeyer would receive as part of his sentence, adequate mental health care.’”
Id. at 875.
The court disregarded statements 1 and 3 as clearly not misconduct, even if taken as true.

21
22
23
24
25

After considering statements 2 and 4, the court held that “the mere fact that the jury foreman
brought her outside experience to bear” was not misconduct, and noted that at least one study has
shown that “‘50% of the jurors’ time [is] spent discussing personal experiences.’” Id. at 878879.
In Wilson v. Vermont Castings, Inc., 170 F.3d 391 (3rd Cir. 1999), a juror owned a stove

fires, and would continue to do so even if there was a warning.

2

The Third Circuit held that while the contents of the manual were “extraneous,” the

3

juror’s knowledge of the stove at issue and her opinions about it were not extraneous because

4

they were adduced by her own experience as a stove owner, and were “thus similar to the

5

permissible instance of a juror bringing her own life experience into a jury room.” Id. at 395,

6

n.4. Similarly, in Crawford v. Head, 311 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2002), the court held that a juror

7

sharing her limited experience as a 1st year nursing student in analyzing the hair and blood

8

sample evidence at issue “is consistent with jurors bringing their experiences to bear while

9

reviewing the evidence properly before them.” Id. at 1333.
The Sixth Circuit has also excepted the personal experiences of jurors from the definition

10
11

of “extraneous prejudicial information,” holding that in an action for injuries from slipping on a

12

waxed floor, comments by jurors during deliberations about their personal experience with

13

waxed floors and back injuries were statements of general experience and background by which

14

the jury tests parties’ theories. Womble v. J.C. Penney Co., 47 F.R.D. 350, 356, (E.D. Tenn.

15

1969), aff’d 431 F.2d 985 (6th Cir. 1970); See also Gault v. Poor Sisters of St. Francis Seraph of

16

Perpetual Adoration, Inc., 375 F.2d 539, 548-551 (6th Cir. 1967).

17

In some instances personal experiences may constitute “extrinsic evidence,” but only in

18

circumstances where a juror has personal knowledge regarding the parties or the issues involved

19

in the litigation that may affect the verdict. U. S. v. Hortensia Navarro-Garcia, 926 F.2d at 821-

20

822. For example, in Hard the court found that the personal experiences of a juror were

21

“extraneous prejudicial evidence” because the juror failed to disclose during voir dire that he and

22

his father had both been employed by the defendant, and the juror relayed his personal

23

knowledge of the defendant’s legal settlement practices to the deliberating jury. Hard at 483,

24

485. See also Jeffries v. Blodgett, 5 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 1993) (“A juror’s personal knowledge of

25

information concerning the defendant or the defendant’s alleged crime constitutes impermissible

extrinsic evidence.”)

weight of the evidence can only be proper when the record shows that the jury’s verdict resulted

2

in a miscarriage of justice or where the verdict, on the record, cries out to be overturned or

3

“shocks the conscience.” Williamson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 926 F.2d 1344, 1353 (3rd Cir.

4

1991). See also Latino v. Kaizer, 58 F.3d 310, 315 (7th Cir. 1995). The only cry heard in this

5

case is from the losing parties.

6

Determining the “weight of the evidence” is a fact specific endeavor, “and an appellate

7

court will generally not reverse the denial of a new trial motion if there was some reasonable

8

basis for the jury’s verdict.” Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 729 (9th Cir. 2007). In

9

this case the verdict is well supported.

10

“Courts are not free to re-weigh the evidence and set aside the jury verdict merely

11

because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions or because judges feel that

12

other results are more reasonable.” Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union Ry., 321 U.S. 29, 35

13

(1944). “[A] decent respect for the collective wisdom of the jury, and for the function entrusted

14

to it in our system, certainly suggests that in most cases the judge should accept the findings of

15

the jury.” Landes Const. Co. Inc.,v. Royal Bank of Canada, 833 F.2d 1365, 1371 (9th Cir. 1987).

16

Only if, after having “given full respect to the jury’s findings, the judge on the entire evidence is

17

left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,” should a motion

18

for a new trial be granted. Id. at 1371-72.

19

While a trial court “may weigh the evidence and the credibility the witnesses, the court is

20

Mr. Barabin Was Exposed to the Defendants’ Paper Machine Clothing
at the Camas Mill

Mr. Barabin began his paper-making career at the Camas mill in 1968. (10/28 56:20-21).

# 20. (10/28 61:1-62:18). The main paper machine building was almost completely enclosed,

2

with only a few windows in the entire structure. (10/28 64:4-11). All these paper machines

3

were old, and were not well sealed or ventilated. (10/28 63:19-64:3).

4

Mr. Barabin first worked as a pulp tester, a job that required him to travel to all areas of

5

the mill. (10/28 65:4-16). This required him to walk through the mill “basement,” where the

6

bottom half of the paper-machine dryer sections were located. (10/28 66:3-11). Mr. Barabin had

7

to be in close proximity to all the paper machines to do his job as a pulp tester. (10/28 68:24-

8

69:1).

9

Mr. Barabin later worked as a paper tester, a job that also required him to be in close

10

proximity to the dryer ends of all the paper machines. (10/28 66:19-68:5; 69:2-15). Mr. Barabin

11

worked all shifts on a weekly rotation, with some overtime work. (10/28 68:6-23).

12

During his time in the technical department as a pulp tester, and later a paper tester, Mr.

13

Barabin frequently observed dryer felt changes, and was frequently in close proximity to the

14

paper machines when the old felt was removed and the new one put on. (10/28 70:16-71:1).

15

Often he would observe felt changes in an attempt to get a piece of the used felt to use in his

16

garden. (10/28 71:2-14). Sometimes he was successful. (10/28 71:6-14).

17

Mr. Barabin would cut the used felt with a paper knife, and would see visible dust

18

emitted from the dryer felt. (10/28 71:15-72:5). The used felts were later removed from the

19

machine area by dragging them across the shop floor by forklift to the outside scrap pile. (10/28

20

73:4-16). Mr. Barabin observed this at least twice a month during the time he worked as both

21

pulp and paper tester. (10/28 73:25-74:18). He also observed visible dust emitted when an old

22

felt was cut to release it from the paper machine, when a new felt was removed from its crate,

23

and when an old felt was pulled off the paper machine. (10/28 74:19-75:10). Some of this dust

24

came from inside the felt itself. (10/28 167:22-168:1). In order to install the new felt, the

25

workers would cut little slits all the way across the old felts, and pass rope through the slits into

26

the brass eyelets of the new felt to join the felt ends. (10/28 96:3-12).

27
28

There were a lot of paper breaks on the paper machines. (10/28 76:9-11). Very seldom
was there a shift in which a paper break did not occur. (10/28 85:1-13). When there was a paper
break the dryer section would be shut down, the vents shut down, and the workers used poles to

remove the larger scraps of paper. Compressed air was used to blow out the interior of the dryer

2

section, and the surface of the dryer felts. (10/28 76:11-77:11). Compressed air was also

3

exclusively used to clean the area around the dry ends of all the paper machines. Compressed air

4

was used to clean up the paper machine and dryer end and surrounding area at the end of each

5

shift. (10/28 85:14-18; 77:18-78:6). The use of compressed air created a visibly dusty

6

environment. (10/28 78:17-19).

7

Mr. Barabin moved up to working on the paper machines themselves as a “spare hand,”

8

working on all the paper machines on an ad hoc basis. (10/28 75:11-23). As a spare hand, Mr.

9

Barabin frequently observed felt changes, from a maximum distance of 20 feet. (10/28 82:7-

10

83:1). These shutdowns utilized the same work practices as described above. (10/28 82:13-15).

11

After approximately two months of spare hand work on all the paper machines, he

12

became a “5th hand” on the progression ladder for the #7 and #8 machines. (10/28 79:10-11;

13

79:25-80:4). He held this job for approximately a year. (10/28 79:23-24). During his time as a

14

“5th hand,” he was also assigned to work on the #4, #5, and #6 machines for varying lengths of

15

time. (10/28 80:5-17).
As a “5th hand,” Mr. Barabin participated directly in felt changes, helping to remove new

16
17

felts from their crates, and holding the old felts while they were stitched together with the new

18

felt so it could be installed on the paper machine. (10/28 81:20-82:5). This included cutting the

19

old felts with a knife. (10/28 88:4-6).
Approximately every two weeks every machine would be shut down on a rotating basis

20
21

for routine maintenance, part of which was a “blow down” of the dryer end with compressed air,

22

with the blow down taking between one-half to one hour. (10/28 83:2-84:25). During his time

23

as a “5th hand,” Mr. Barabin also directly participated in felt changes on the #4, #5, and #6

24

machines. (10/28 86:7-9). Both the old felt and the new felt were dry when they were removed

25

and installed. (10/28 88:25-89:7).
Mr. Barabin became a “4th hand” on the #8 machine in approximately 1974, doing

26
27

essentially the same work as he had done as a “5th hand.” (10/28 90:18-20). Approximately

28

every two weeks Mr. Barabin would work overtime assisting on a shutdown of other “wrap end”
paper machines. (10/28 91:17-92:12). Approximately once a month he would participate in a

After working as a “4th hand,” Mr. Barabin moved up to working as a “winderman,” and

2
3

concurrently as a relief “filterman” as needed. (10/28 94:3-13). The winder is located on the dry

4

end of the paper machine. Mr. Barabin worked in this job until approximately 1977, when he

5

became a full-time “filterman.” (10/28 94:14-20; 100:20-101:3).

6

In this job he was initially assigned to machine #7, but later moved to machine #8.

7

(10/28 99:8-15). As a ‘winderman,” he participated in shutdowns by blowing out the dry end of

8

the paper machine with compressed air in the same way he had in his prior jobs on the paper

9

machines, and working approximately the same amount of overtime as he had previously, on all

10

the different “wrap end” machines as needed. (10/28 98:11-99:8; 99:23-100:17).
After becoming a full-time “filterman,” Mr. Barabin was tasked with responsibility for

11
12

the filters on all the paper machines, and therefore was working on and near all the paper

13

machines once again. (10/28 103:9-19). Although he no longer had cleanup duties, Mr. Barabin

14

was almost always present near the dry end when a paper machine was shut down. (10/28

15

103:20)
Asten stipulated that between 1971 through December 31, 1980, it supplied 148 asbestos-

16
17

containing dryer felts to the Camas Mill that were installed on paper machines that Mr. Barabin

18

worked on or around. Ex. 696. These felts were between 20% to 58% chrysotile asbestos. Id.

19

Scapa stipulated that during the relevant time period, it supplied 229 asbestos-containing

20

dryer felts to the Camas Mill that were installed on paper machines that Mr. Barabin worked on

21

or around. Ex. 697. These felts were between 20% to 60% chrysotile asbestos. Id.

22

As this Court has recognized, the law does not require that Mr. Barabin have a specific

23

recollection of working with a defendant’s product. See Dkt. # 200 at 7:3-5. A plaintiff’s

24

burden regarding causation in an asbestos case is no different from a plaintiff’s burden in any

25

other negligence or product liability case. “Circumstantial evidence may establish the entire

26

basis for recovery under either negligence or strict products liability.” Lockwood v. AC& S, 44

2

directly with an Asten or a Scapa dryer felt. Rather, plaintiff’s extensive testimony regarding his

3

work at the mill on specific paper machines coupled with the stipulations regarding the presence

4

of the defendants’ asbestos containing dryer felts and fabrics on specific paper machines that he

5

worked on or near is sufficient evidence of exposure to the defendants’ asbestos-containing

products. Lockwood v. AC&S, Inc., 109 Wn.2d 235, 245 (1987); See also Lockwood v. AC&S,

Inc., 44 Wn.App 330, 354 (1987).

2.

Asten and Scapa Paper Machine Clothing Was A Substantial Factor in
Causing Mr. Barabin’s Disease

9
The defendants’ arguments against exposure and causation rest on the false assertion that
10
the law requires the plaintiffs to show that Mr. Barabin was exposed to a certain quantity of
11
asbestos emitted from their products in order to be liable for his injuries. The law does not
12
require, as the defendants repeatedly assert, that the plaintiffs must prove exactly how much
13
asbestos fiber from their products Mr. Barabin was exposed to. Indeed, the evidence at trial was
14
that such an opinion would be scientifically impossible to provide.
15
As this Court has recognized, “Plaintiffs need not meet some quantitative threshold in
16
order to establish causation. Nor must they establish that [a] defendant’s product was the cause
17
of plaintiff’s mesothelioma or could alone have cause the disease.” See Dkt. #248 at 5:6-8.
18
An examination of the facts underlying both Lockwood appellate decisions is crucial for
19
a full understanding of the holdings of these two important decisions. After this examination, it
20
is clear Mr. Barabin has made the required connection between defendants’ products and his
21
injury.
22
In Lockwood, defendant Raymark unsuccessfully moved for a directed verdict at the
23
close of plaintiffs’ case, and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict returned in favor of the
24
Lockwoods after jury deliberations ended. The primary issue addressed at both the intermediate
25
court and in the Washington Supreme Court appeal was whether the Lockwoods had presented
26
sufficient evidence of causation. An examination of that evidence follows.
27
Raymark argued that Lockwood did not personally handle asbestos products in his work,
28
and that his primary exposure to asbestos occurred when asbestos cloth was torn from vessels

during rigging. Id. at 245. There was no direct evidence that any cloth torn by riggers was

2

asbestos cloth, or that any cloth torn was made by Raymark. Raymark asbestos cloth was

3

identified as cloth installed on vessels, but no evidence showed Raymark cloth was removed

4

from any vessels Lockwood worked on. There was also no direct evidence that Lockwood

5

worked with or near Raymark asbestos cloth on the George Washington, or that Raymark cloth

6

was torn from that vessel. Id.

7

In reviewing the evidence against Raymark and Raymark’s arguments against the

8

evidence, the Washington Supreme Court stated: “ . . . Bradley’s testimony that Raymark’s

9

product was used on a large liner conversion at Puget Sound Bridge and Dredge in 1947 and

10

1948, and Lockwood’s testimony that he had worked on the overhaul of the George Washington

11

and that there was asbestos on that type of job, indicate that Raymark’s product was used on a

12

ship where Lockwood worked.” Id. at 247. The Court further stated, “ Thus, even if Lockwood

13

did not work directly with Raymark’s product on the George Washington, it is reasonable to

14

infer that since the product was used on that ship when Lockwood worked there, Lockwood was

15

exposed to it.” Id.

16

Lockwood also presented expert testimony about how individuals who did not work

17

directly with asbestos, but who worked in areas where asbestos work was performed, could be

18

exposed to asbestos as bystanders. The expert testimony also explained how asbestos fibers,

19

once released, spread throughout a working area over time. The testimony established that

20

asbestos dust released into the air could remain in the air and become diffused, so that bystanders

21

could inhale asbestos fibers. Expert testimony also established that asbestos diseases are

22

cumulative dose-response diseases, i.e. all occupational exposures play a role in contributing to

23

the ultimate disease response. Id. at 243-244.

24

In affirming the rulings of the lower courts that the evidence presented was sufficient to

25

affirm the jury verdict, the Washington Supreme Court considered four main evidentiary points:

26

(1) evidence showed that the defendant’s asbestos-containing product was present in an area

27

where Mr. Lockwood worked; (2) expert testimony established that after asbestos dust was

28

released from the defendant’s product it drifted in the air and could be inhaled by bystanders
who did not work directly with the product. Therefore, it was reasonable to infer that since the

Testimony of Dr. James Millette

7

In this case, Dr. Millette testified regarding his knowledge of asbestos fiber release from

8

dryer felts and fabrics. He earned his doctoral degree in Environmental Science, and focuses his

9

work in particle analysis, industrial hygiene, and the physics of small particles, specifically the

10

release of particles from different materials as those materials are cut, blown, or disrupted in

11

some manner, and the collection of those particles for analysis. (11/5 5:3-21; 6:3-17).

12

Dr. Millette’s electron microscope work formed the basis of U.S. Environmental

13

Protection Agency regulations relating to asbestos testing. (11/5 6:18-7:13). Dr. Millette has

14

been involved with asbestos research in his area of expertise since 1974, and has published

15

approximately 60 articles in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, over half of which deal

16

directly with asbestos. (11/5 11:19-12:13). Dr. Millette has written one book dealing

17

specifically with asbestos and settled dust, and a chapter addressing analytical methods of

18

asbestos analysis in another book. (11/5 12:20-13:17). Dr. Millette was closely involved in

19

formulating the analysis methods and standards for asbestos detection and clearance in the

20

nations schools for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under the Asbestos Hazard

21

Emergency Response Act (“AHERA”). (11/5 13:23-14:8).

22

Dr. Millette is also the former Vice Chair and current Chair of the section of the

23

American Society for Testing Materials (“ASTM”) that formulates the standardized methods for

24

analyzing asbestos, used by researchers throughout the world. (11/5 14:8-15:6). In the course of

25

his professional career, Dr. Millette has extensive experience testing asbestos-containing

26

materials, including asbestos packing and gaskets, asbestos gloves, asbestos board, various

27

asbestos textiles, talc powder, asbestos cement pipe, floor tile, acoustical plaster, fireproofing,

28

caulks and paints, and Vermiculite insulation. (11/5 13:18-21; 59:24-60:10). He has tested over
10,000 different samples, and over 50 different asbestos-containing products. (11/5 16:6-12).

Dr. Millette is the author of the only article dealing with asbestos fiber release from dryer felts

2

and fabrics in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. (11/5 19:23-20:15; 21:9-17).

3

In his testing of various dryer felts and fabrics, Dr. Millette found the asbestos content

4

ranged from 20% to 60% . (11/5 23:16-24:3). Asten admitted that its asbestos-containing dryer

5

felts ranged from 20% to 58% chrysotile asbestos. Ex. 696. Similarly, Scapa admitted that the

6

asbestos content of its felts ranged from 20% to 60%. Ex. 697.

7

As a part of his testing, Dr. Millette engaged in a simple and common-sense application

8

of a Post-it note to the tested felt samples. If asbestos fibers adhere to the lightly adhesive

9

surface of the note, it demonstrates that those fibers are capable of being released in a variety of

10

other situations. (11/5 38:20-39:9). Dr. Millette also conducted a similar test using a wet

11

fingertip. (11/5 39:13-40:4).

12

Despite the varying ages and conditions of the dryer felt samples used in Dr. Millette’s

13

testing, all of the samples, except for the non-asbestos sample, released asbestos fibers, including

14

those samples from dryer felts made by Asten and Scapa. (11/5 40:5-25). Dr. Millette’s analysis

15

found that for those dryer felts and fabrics that initially had a resin coating, the coating

16

deteriorated to such an extent that it did not prevent fiber release in any significant way, and

17

there was not a significant difference in fiber release between newer dryer felts and older dryer

18

felts. (11/5 24:14-24; 23:4-9). Wet or dry, used or unused, tightly woven or loose weave,

19

asbestos fibers were released in significant quantities in all cases. (11/5 85:24-86:3).

Testimony of Kenneth Cohen

Mr. Cohen testified regarding asbestos fiber release and the physical properties and

22

behavior of asbestos fibers. Mr. Cohen has worked in the industrial hygiene field since the mid-

23

1960s. (10/29 22:11-13). Asbestos and its related issues have been a substantial component of

24

Mr. Cohen’s professional practice since the early 1970s. (10/29 22:23-23:4). From 1976-1978,

25

he was employed by the U.S. Civil Service as a civilian Industrial Hygienist for the U.S. Navy,

26

and co-authored the Navy’s manual on asbestos handling in shore-based facilities, published in

27

1980. (10/29 22:16-18; 23:4-7). Mr. Cohen has taught industrial toxicology courses at the

10

conducted asbestos-related testing at thousands of different sites over his 40-year industrial

11

hygiene career. (10/29 34:23-35:1).

12

Mr. Cohen has also conducted extensive testing on various types of asbestos textile

encapsulation prevented asbestos fiber release in very few of these products. Id. This is

particularly true as these products are used, and the deterioration of the encapsulating material

17

depends on their exposure to friction, abrasion, temperature and length of use, among other

18

things. (10/29 49:24-51:6).

19

Specific to this case, Mr. Cohen had visited three working paper mills in his professional

20

capacity. (10/29 61:12-62:2; 113:7-114:4). Mr. Cohen is familiar with the work setting and

21

practices of the paper mill environment. (10/29 66:8-15). Mr. Cohen had previously tested used

22

asbestos-containing dryer felt material obtained from a retired paper worker. (10/29 62:6-14).

23

Mr. Cohen had undertaken a review of the available literature relating to asbestos-containing

24

dryer felts, and was familiar with the use and purpose of dryer felts in a paper mill. (10/29

25

62:15-63:25). Mr. Cohen’s prior testing of dryer felts revealed an asbestos-content between 20-

26

40% chrysotile asbestos.

28

Mr. Cohen is well educated and familiar with the chemical and molecular qualities of
asbestos, and how they contribute to the aerodynamic qualities of asbestos fibers. (10/29 37:2539:9; 51:7-18). Once released, asbestos fibers can remain airborne, and therefore are available to

4

Mr. Cohen testified that Mr. Barabin’s cutting of the dryer felts would be a physical

5

manipulation of the material that would allow asbestos fibers to be released into his breathing

zone, and would constitute a direct exposure to asbestos. (10/29 76:15-82:10). Mr. Barabin’s

proximity to others doing this activity, Mr. Barabin’s proximity to disposal of used dryer felts,

8

and his presence in the paper machine areas where compressed air was used to “blow down”

Testimony of Dr. Carl Brodkin

Dr. Brodkin is a physician board certified in internal medicine and occupational and

13

environmental medicine, with extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of

14

occupational injuries. (11/3 5:5-15:16). Dr. Brodkin has published approximately a dozen

15

articles in the peer-reviewed medical literature relating directly to asbestos exposure, and has

16

authored or co-authored five medical textbook chapters relating to asbestos disease. (11/3 9:24-

17

10:7; 9:6-23). He has studied over 4,000 asbestos-exposed workers, including paper mill

18

workers, and also including 40 mesothelioma patients, as part of the CARET study funded by the

19

National Cancer Institute. (11/3 8:12-10:6). In his clinical practice, he has treated over 1,500

20

patients with asbestos-related disease during his 20 years of focusing on asbestos. (11/3 10:17-

21

20; 13:8-14:12).

22

By necessity, an occupational medicine physician must be familiar with the ways in

23

which harmful substances can enter an individual’s body. Over the course of his long career in

24

occupational and environmental medicine, Dr. Brodkin is familiar with the properties of

25

asbestos-containing textiles, and the manner in which the physical manipulation of those textiles

26

can cause asbestos fibers to be released. (11/3 51:10-25).

27
28

Dr. Brodkin testified that particulate matter, including asbestos fibers, enter the lungs and
pass through its defenses, and is transported out of the lungs to the pleura through the body’s
immune system. (11/3 19:22-22:17). Once at the target site, the fibers cause cellular injury

which ultimately manifests as mesothelioma, leading to the death of the exposed person. (11/3

2

27:17-28:16). All types of asbestos fiber can cause mesothelioma, specifically including

3

chrysotile asbestos. (11/3 70:4-72:23).

4

Mesothelioma is a total dose response disease. It is the aggregate dose of asbestos that

5

one encounters over a lifetime that causes mesothelioma. Given sufficient minimum latency, it

6

is not biologically possible to separate or segregate a dose of asbestos that came from one source

7

versus a dose of asbestos that came from another source. (11/3 67:14-68:5; 69:5-15; 73:20-

8

74:10).

9

Dr. Brodkin discussed how he had reviewed and considered Mr. Barabin’s deposition

10

testimony regarding his actual activities and opportunities for exposure at the Camas mill. (11/3

11

38:5-39:23). He testified regarding the various studies he had reviewed on asbestos dust levels

12

in paper mills, his review of documents produced by each of the defendants, and his review of

13

studies of various asbestos textiles similar to dryer fabrics. (11/3 46:4-50:13). He also testified

14

that he had reviewed Mr. Cohen’s testimony regarding asbestos release from dryer fabrics, as

15

well as Dr. Millette’s peer reviewed published study on the subject. (11/3 52:6-17). Dr. Brodkin

16

testified to his opinion based on several epidemiological studies that paper mill workers have a

17

significantly increased risk of mesothelioma due to their occupational exposures in the paper

18

mill environment. (11/3 34:7-36:8).

19

He further opined that based on all the studies he reviewed, the exposure in the paper

20

machine areas of paper mills, including asbestos from dryer fabrics, would be in the range of 7

21

f/cc. (11/3 54:22-55:6). He opined that asbestos from dryer felts would be an important

22

component of the cumulative exposure to asbestos a paper machine worker would encounter

23

around a paper machine. (11/3 56:1-4). Dr. Brodkin compared ambient air (500,000 to 5 million

24

sugar cubes of air before one would hit the first fiber of asbestos) to levels of 7 f/cc around a

25

paper machine, including from dryer felts (7 fibers in each sugar cube of air) - a level of asbestos

26

exposure up to 35 million times higher than ambient - that overwhelms the body’s defense

27

mechanisms and contributes to cause mesothelioma. (11/3 56:6-25).

Dr. Brodkin opined that all of Mr. Barabin’s exposures from his paper machine work,
including from dryer fabrics, were strong identifiable exposures to asbestos that added to his

cumulative exposure to asbestos and were substantial contributing factors in his development of

2

mesothelioma. (11/3 63:10-21). Dr. Brodkin opined that Mr. Barabin was exposed to asbestos

3

from dryer felts via both direct and background exposure, and that both were significant in the

4

causation of his mesothelioma. (11/3 57:24-59:4). He opined that none of these exposures could

5

be excluded as part of the cumulative exposure, substantially contributing to cause Mr. Barabin’s

6

mesothelioma regardless of fiber type. (11/3 64:11-16; 66:2-68:3; 69:2-12; 72:15-23). The

7

exposures to dryer felts described by Mr. Barabin, whether direct exposure or bystander

8

exposure, all contributed to his cumulative dose of asbestos that ultimately caused his

9

mesothelioma. (11/3 69:16-70:3).

10

Contrary to the mis-statement in the defense motions, Dr. Brodkin’s testimony on

11

exposure and causation was more than sufficient for the jury to find in favor of the Barabins.

12

The emptiness of the defendants’ argument is illustrated by their focus on argument that has

13

nothing to do with this case - “every fiber, or a single fiber, can cause disease.” The defendants

14

have set up the “single fiber” strawman in order to knock him down. Neither Dr. Brodkin, nor

15

any other expert on either side in this case, offered such testimony.3 Regardless, Dr. Brodkin

16

actually testified that to be a cause of mesothelioma an exposure to asbestos fibers must be

17

sufficient to overwhelm the body’s defense mechanisms.

Testimony of Dr. Arnold Brody

19

Dr. Brody testified about the cellular impacts of asbestos exposure. Dr. Brody is an

20

expert on cell biology and asbestos-related pathogenesis. (10/27 97:6-11). Like Dr. Brodkin and

21

defense pathologist Dr. Samuel Hammar, he opined that all types of asbestos fibers, chrysotile

22

and the amphiboles, cause cancer in the mesothelial cells surrounding the lung, heart and

23

peritoneal cavity. (10/27 99:18-23; 126:1-8). Chrysotile fibers tend to accumulate preferentially

24

in the pleura. (10/27 125:9-19). On a cellular level, each exposure to asbestos contributes to the

25

cellular errors that cause cancer. (10/27 142:20-143:5).

Application of Lockwood

The facts present in this case are closely analogous to those presented in Lockwood.

3

(1) Exhibits 696 and 697 show that the defendants’ asbestos-containing dryer felts were

4

installed on paper machines Mr. Barabin worked on and near during his long career at the Camas

5

Mill; (2) the Barabins presented expert testimony that established that asbestos-containing dryer

6

felts release respirable asbestos fibers. These fibers, once released, hang in the air and become

7

diffused across large areas. Bystanders who do not work directly with the dryer felt can be

8

exposed to respirable fibers released from the dryer felts during their installation, use,

9

manipulation, and removal. Therefore, as the Lockwood court concluded, it is reasonable to infer

10

that because the defendants’ asbestos-containing dryer felts were used in the areas where Mr.

11

Barabin worked, he was exposed to respirable asbestos from Asten and Scapa dryer felts; (3)

12

even in their highly controlled study, the defendants were unable to show that asbestos-

13

containing dryer felts do not release respirable asbestos fibers; (4) the Barabins presented expert

14

medical evidence that all of Mr. Barabin’s occupational exposures to asbestos, including his

15

exposure to respirable asbestos fibers from Asten and Scapa dryer felts, were a substantial factor

16

in contributing to his asbestos-caused disease. On this point, Scapa’s expert witness Dr. Samuel

17

P. Hammar agrees.

18

The Barabins have amply demonstrated that the defendants’ products were in Mr.

19

Barabin’s work environment at the Camas Mill when the injurious exposure occurred, and that

20

all his exposures to respirable asbestos, including those from the defendants’ dryer felts, played

21

an indivisible role in causing his disease. Taken as a whole, the evidence clearly shows that Mr.

22

Barabin was exposed to respirable asbestos fibers from Asten and Scapa products, and that these

23

exposures, together with his other significant occupational exposures to respirable asbestos

24

fibers, were a substantial factor in causing his mesothelioma. Considering the sufficiency of the

25

evidence presented, the defense motions must fail.

Mr. Cohen’s Testimony Was Properly Allowed

14

More ink has been spilled addressing Mr. Cohen’s testimony than any other issue in this

15

case. In this instance, the defendants are simply asking the Court to join them in re-hashing old

16

arguments that have been extensively briefed by the parties, and already considered by the Court.

17

At this point, the defendants “must show more than a disagreement with the Court’s decision,

original decision fails to carry the moving party’s burden.” U.S. v. Westlands Water District,

background and experience. See infra § V(B)(2)(b). It serves no purpose to repeat it here. The

Court listened carefully to the questions asked of Mr. Cohen and scrutinized his responses. The

support of a position that has been repeatedly rejected by this Court.4

2

The linchpin of the defense argument is that a paper mill is so different from any other

3

industrial environment that a Certified Industrial Hygienist of 40-years experience in evaluating

4

harmful exposures in industrial settings cannot render any opinions relating to the paper mill

5

environment. Likewise with their paper machine clothing. Defendants contend that their dryer

6

felts and fabrics are so different from any other asbestos textile that only the mythical5 “Certified

7

Dryer Felt Specialist” can render any opinions relating to these textiles.
The flaw in these contentions is that the defendants failed to present any evidence that

8
9

supported this theme. Mr. Cohen and Dr. Millette indicated dryer felts are no different than any

10

other asbestos textiles they have sampled and tested throughout their professional careers. The

11

defendants attempt to overcome their lack of evidence on this crucial point through sheer weight

12

of repetition. This was unconvincing to the Court and to the jury, and remains so now.

13

In this case, Mr. Cohen provided substantial trial testimony, with extensive foundation,

14

regarding direct exposure, bystander exposure, and relatively contemporaneous re-entrainment

15

exposure through the work practices described by Mr. Barabin. Both defendants had ample

16

opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Cohen on his opinions, and both did so vigorously. The

17

Court’s evidentiary rulings regarding Mr. Cohen were not erroneous, and therefore a new trial

18

based on Mr. Cohen’s testimony is not warranted or proper.

Dr. Millette’s Limited Testimony Was Properly Allowed

In complaining about the admission of microscopist Dr. James Millette’s testimony, the

defendants repeat themselves yet again. More than repetition is required. Westlands Water

22

District at 1131. Although Asten and Scapa cloak their arguments against Dr. Millette as

relating to allegedly unsound methodologies, these remain poorly disguised attacks on Dr.

asbestos exposure was via re-entrainment, and only many decades after initial fiber release.

about Dr. Millette’s testing, publication or opinions runs afoul of Rule 702.6
The defendants boldly assert that Dr. Millette’s “methodology and findings are not

3

generally accepted in the scientific community.” This would be comical if the subject were not

4

so serious. The defendants willfully ignore that (1) he authored the testing methodology for

5

asbestos used by the EPA and the ASTM; that (2) he chairs the ASTM committee on asbestos

6

testing methodology; that (3) he has authored multiple peer-reviewed publications on asbestos

7

testing methodology; that (4) he has tested and produced more reports on asbestos dryer fabrics

8

than anyone else; and (5) has authored the only peer-reviewed study of asbestos fiber release

9

from dryer felts extant in the published scientific literature.

10

Defendants’ argument that Dr. Millette’s testimony must be excluded based on “general

11

acceptance” are not well taken. Nothing in the text of Rule 702 establishes “‘general

12

acceptance’ as an absolute pre-requisite to admissibility . . . and a rigid ‘general acceptance’

13

requirement would be at odds with the ‘liberal thrust’ of the federal rules and ‘their general

14

approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony . . . that austere standard,

15

absent from, and incompatible with, the Federal Rules of Evidence, should not be employed in

16

federal trials.” Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 588-589 (1993).

17

Dr. Millette is a recognized expert in his field. See Caruolo v. John Crane, Inc., 226 F.3d

18

46, 54-55 (2nd Cir. 2000) (upholding district court’s admission of expert’s testimony regarding

19

his reliance on and reference to Dr. Millette’s study of asbestos fiber release from packing

20

material as a peer reviewed and authoritative publication in the relevant field of study). It is

21

perfectly appropriate for him to testify regarding his published and peer-reviewed dryer felt

22

studies, and for others to rely on that work. “The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer

23

reviewed journal will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the

24

scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology on which an opinion is premised.”

25

Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594 (1993).

Here, as with Mr. Cohen, the appropriate standard is not whether his foundational
experience exactly replicates conditions in a paper mill. But even if it were the standard, Dr.

Evidence of the Barabins Medical Insurance Was Properly Excluded

On its face, Mrs. Barabin’s very general testimony about her concerns as she faces a

15

challenging future with a sick and dying husband did not “open the door” such that the

16

defendants should have been allowed to introduce evidence of the Barabin’s health insurance.

17

Moreover, the defendants did not object or move to strike at the time the testimony was offered,

18

and thereby waived their objection to this testimony.

19

It is a fundamental rule of evidence that an objection not timely made is waived. U.S. v.

20

Jamerson, 549 F.2d 1263, 1266-67 (9th Cir. 1977). “Error may not be predicated upon a ruling

timely objection or motion to strike appears of record . . .” Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1). If testimony,

even though improper, is introduced into evidence without objection, it becomes part of the

to object and then use their dilatory behavior as an excuse to introduce inadmissible collateral

2

source evidence.

3

Washington law is clear that medical insurance is a collateral source. The premise of the

4

rule barring evidence of collateral source payments is that injured parties should be able to

5

recover compensatory damages from tortfeasors without regard to payments received from other

6

sources. See e.g. Johnson v Weyerhaeuser Co., 134 Wn. 2d 795, 798 (1998). Because of the

7

danger that the jury might use evidence of the plaintiffs’ receipt of insurance proceeds for an

8

improper purpose, such evidence is inadmissible at trial. Cox v. Spangler, 141 Wn.2d 431, 440

9

(2000).

10

While the defendants cite foreign cases in support of their arguments, the two

11

Washington cases they cite are factually distinguishable from the facts at issue in this case. In

12

Johnson, the court found the plaintiff had opened the door to collateral source evidence by

13

specifically stating his income had been reduced. The defendants’ reliance on Marler v.

14

Department of Retirement Systems, 100 Wn.App. 494 (2000) is likewise misplaced. In Marler,

15

the plaintiff repeatedly testified to receiving an L&I pension during his direct testimony,

16

obviously opening the door to the defendant referring to his pension as well.

In contrast, Mrs. Barabin preceded the testimony cited by the defendants by telling the
jury she had retired from her job in 2002. Mrs. Barabin’s subsequent testimony that in looking
toward the future she hoped to “keep my health and be able to take care of him” and “pay for
necessary medications and stuff,” was simply her attempt to summarize some of the many
concerns she has as she faces the future with her beloved, terminally ill spouse (and is factually
accurate because they do in fact make substantial insurance co-payments).

23
Because Mrs. Barabin had already informed the jury that she was retired, the jury clearly

24
25

27
28

cannot infer that she needed to keep her health in order to keep working to pay for her husband’s
medical treatment – a conclusion the defendants appear to be arguing as the grounds for
“opening the door” to evidence of Mr. Barabin’s health insurance benefits. Rather, it is more
reasonable to conclude that the jury understood from Mrs. Barabin’s very general testimony
regarding this subject, that, as would be normal under her circumstances as her husband’s

primary care-giver, she has an overall fear of the future having already faced great uncertainty

2

and hardship.

3

The defendants complain that somehow this relates to the issue of plaintiffs recovering

4

“substantial settlements from others.” They forget that under Washington law, they are entitled

5

to an offset for these past settlements. The defendants next erroneously contend that somehow

6

Mrs. Barabin’s testimony led to an a somehow excessive loss of consortium assessment. The

7

defendants’ speculation is belied by the fact that the medical damages assessed by the jury is

8

exactly consistent with the testimony from Dr. Brodkin on medical damages.

If Mrs. Barabin’s state-of-mind testimony regarding her fears for the future rises to the
level of opening the door to admission of collateral source evidence, the entire collateral source
rule would be rendered meaningless in virtually all cases. In the context of the overwhelming
and uncontroverted evidence about the Barabins general and special damages, Mrs. Barabin’s
cited testimony cannot be said to have had a prejudicial effect on the damages verdict, and the
defendants attempt to use it as a vehicle to introduce evidence of otherwise inadmissible
collateral source insurance payments to counter the plaintiffs’ medical damages testimony is
barred.

The Court’s Admission of a Limited Number of the Defendants’
Corporate Documents and Asbestos Textile Institute Documents Was Not
Unfairly Prejudicial or Needlessly Cumulative

Asten admitted it was a member of the Asbestos Textile Institute (“ATI”). ATI
documents are routinely admitted into evidence in cases involving members of the ATI. See

23

Lockwood v. AC&S, Inc., et al., 109 Wn. 2d 235, 264 (1987). Asten has cited no instance in

24

which the ATI documents have been excluded from use as evidence against a member of the

25

organization.

26
27
28

Plaintiffs only used the ATI documents in relation to their negligence claim against
Asten. In a negligence claim against a product manufacturer, the manufacturer’s knowledge of
the product, its dangerousness, and the hazards involved in reasonably foreseeable uses of the
product are all relevant to determining its culpability. The Court informed the jury that the ATI

evidence was only to be considered in relation to Asten, and could not be considered in relation

2

to plaintiffs’ allegations against Scapa. This limiting instruction was sufficient.

3

The admitted ATI documents related directly to Asten’s participation in (and often the

4

directing of) the ATI’s efforts related to asbestos and disease for a number of years. The ATI

5

documents clearly demonstrate that members of the ATI, and in particular the members of the

6

Air Hygiene Committee (chaired by Asten’s representative for a significant period of years),

7

were aware of the dangers of asbestos .

8
9
10
11
12

The Court reviewed each and every proposed ATI exhibit over several days, and
excluded the vast majority of those offered. The Court only admitted redacted versions of a few
ATI documents which demonstrated Asten’s knowledge of the hazards of asbestos dust. The
Court took great effort to ensure the admitted documents were not needlessly cumulative or
unfairly prejudicial.

Asten also argues that its own internal documents relating to plant conditions were not

relevant to show it should have known of the dangers its products presented to end users.
However, information indicating that exposure to asbestos is likely to harm one group of
workers “is at least suggestive of the fact that other groups of workers who are also exposed to
asbestos fibers face similar dangers.” See Lockwood at 252-253 (citing Jackson v. JohnsManville Sales Corp., 750 F.2d 1314 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1022 (1986). Any
distinction between exposures to different types of workers goes to the weight of the evidence,
not to its admissibility. Id. Admission of the these documents was neither cumulative nor
unfairly prejudicial, and therefore not erroneous.

After three weeks of evidence, argument, and instructions on the law, it is hard to

1

without exposure there cannot be liability.8 Contention questions such as the issue of “exposure”

2

are subsumed within the questions regarding cause that were presented to the jury.

3

The jury instructions given were sufficient if they permitted the defendants to argue their

4

theory of the case. Brewer v. City of Napa, 210 F.3d 1093, 1097 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, the

5

defendants were free to argue their theories of exposure and its relation to liability based in the

6

instructions given. Simply because it was the defendants’ position that there was no exposure to

7

their products does not mean the jury could not disagree with them on that issue. The jury’s

8

disagreement with the defendants on whether liability should be imposed does not mean the jury

9

misunderstand the predicate concept of exposure in determining liability.

10
11
12
13
14
15

Following the defendants’ arguments to their logical conclusion, there are any number of
predicate concepts the jury must have understood before it could have assessed liability against
the defendants (i.e., Did Mr. Barabin work at the Camas Mill? Was Mr. Barabin alive when he
worked at the Camas Mill? Is inhaled asbestos capable of causing injury?). Refusing the
defendants’ request for a separate “exposure” question on the verdict form, or any other question
regarding the existence of predicate facts, was not error.

The Pattern Instruction on Cause Was Not
Incorrect

24

The language the defendants complain of was taken verbatim from the most recent
edition of the Washington Pattern Jury Instructions (WPI 15.02 2009 Supp.) The Washington
Supreme Court has never directly addressed the application of the substantial factor causation
standard to an asbestos injury case. However, that Court has addressed the application of the
substantial factor causation standard in a pesticide damage case, which is closely analogous.
In Hue, et al., v. Farmboy Spray Co., Inc., et al., 127 Wn.2d 67 (1995) the court analyzed

25

a challenged jury instruction regarding causation in a claim for damages arising from “off-

26

target” pesticide “drift” after its aerial application. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed the

27

trial court’s ruling that “plaintiffs did not have to prove or apportion individual causal

This allegation of error demonstrates either the defendants’ contempt for the fact-finder or an extremely
low regard for their ability to communicate basic and fundamental concepts to the jury.

The Washington Supreme Court held that it was enough that plaintiffs show that the

3

defendant’s pesticide was contained in a mixture of pesticides that was applied by the crop-

4

dusting planes, and was therefore “part of a cloud” of pesticides “that then was the proximate

5

cause of damage.” Id. The Hue court specifically rejected the contention that the plaintiffs had

6

to show that an individual defendant’s contribution to the pesticide cloud would have been

7

sufficient to cause the injury on its own. Mavroudis v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., 86 Wn. App.

8

22 ,30.

9

In rejecting the contention that plaintiffs had to show that an individual defendant’s

10
11

contribution to the pesticide cloud would have been sufficient to cause the injury on its own, the

12

court cited a series of its prior cases with consistent reasoning and rulings, including Martin v.

13

Abbott Laboratories, 102 Wn.2d 581 (1984) (eliminating individual causal responsibility in DES

14

[diethylstilbestrol] cases); Lockwood v. AC & S, 109 Wn.2d 235, 245 (1987) (cited for the

15

proposition that plaintiff need establish only that defendant’s asbestos products were among

16

those in the plaintiff’s work environment); and Benton City v. Adrian, 50 Wn.App. 330, 342,

17

(1988) (recognizing that where plaintiff suffers indivisible damage caused by the combined flow

18

of defendants’ excess irrigation waters, it is error to dismiss action on ground that damages are

19

not “sufficiently individualized and traceable to each defendant.”). Hue at 92.

20

As the court stated in Mavroudis, the simplest articulation of the “substantial factor”

21
22

standard comes from eminent legal scholar W. Page Keeton:

26

When the conduct of two or more actors is so related to an event that their
combined conduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event, and the
application of the but-for rule to them individually would absolve all of them, the
conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event.
Mavroudis at 30 (citing W. Page Keeton, et al, Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 41, at 268 (5th ed.
1984).

The Continuing Duty to Warn Instruction Was Correct

17

The uncontradicted evidence in this case was that injuries caused by asbestos are
cumulative dose-response diseases. If a person’s susceptibility to the danger caused by a product
continues after that person’s direct exposure to the product has ended, the manufacturer still has
a duty after exposure to exercise reasonable care to warn the person of known dangers, if the
warning could help to prevent or lessen the harm. Lockwood at 109 Wn.2d 235, 259-260 (1987).
Without a warning, Mr. Barabin was given no opportunity to reduce his cumulative exposure to
the defendants’ products or any other asbestos-containing products. The continuing duty to warn
is well-established in Washington law, and was properly given in this instance.9
The defendants’ arguments against this instruction are fatally flawed another reason.

18

Both defendants admitted that they never warned about their products at any time. This

19

admission, coupled with the fact that the continuing duty to warn instruction was an alternative

20

instruction on negligence, means the jury could have found the defendants liable for negligence

21

on one of two alternative grounds. Any error in giving the continuing duty to warn instructions

22

was harmless. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 61.

The Brief Statement Made in Closing Argument Was Cured by
the Court
To warrant reversal of the jury’s verdict on grounds of attorney misconduct, “the flavor

25

of misconduct must sufficiently permeate an entire proceeding to provide conviction that the jury

Burlington Northern R. Co., 60 F.3d 631, 637 (9th Cir. 1995).

3

Here, the statement complained of was made in closing argument. It was made in

response to the testimony of Asten’s industrial hygienist that he had consulted on hundreds of

counsel’s argument. (11/18 62:23-63-7)

Any alleged prejudice caused by this statement was sufficiently cured by the Court’s
instruction to the jury at the time the objection was made. Such an isolated statement standing
alone at the end of a three week trial cannot be said to have “permeated the entire proceeding” or
to have prevented the defendants from fully and fairly presenting their defense. The statement
complained about by the defendants does not warrant a new trial.

14

Joint and Several Liability Does Not Violate the U.S. Constitution

15

It is undisputed that joint and several liability applies to Asten and Scapa as asbestos-

16

injury tortfeasors. Coulter v. Asten Group, Inc. 135 Wn. App. 613, (Div. 1 2006); Brewer v.

17

Fibreboard Corp, 127 Wn.2d 512, 535-536 (1995). The defendants challenge that portion of

18

Washington law that provides for joint and several liability of asbestos-injury tortfeasors as

19

violative of their right to equal protection and due process under the U.S. Constitution.

20
21
22
23
24
25
26

The defendants never challenged this application of the law to them at trial. Dkt # 248 at
2:15-16. In that regard, the defendants never requested any jury instructions relating to
apportionment of damages, and never requested a related question in the special verdict form.
By failing to so act, the defendants have waived these arguments. However, even if the Court
finds that the defendants have not waived this argument, because the defendants have made no
showing to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality that applies to legislative
enactments, their arguments fail.

“The authority of the States to enact such laws as reasonably are deemed to be necessary
to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of their people, carries with it a wide range of
judgment and discretion as to what matters are of sufficiently general importance to be subjected
to state regulation and administration.” Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 136 (1894). It is
undisputed that the legislature may prescribe rules of procedure and evidence, create legal
presumptions, allocate burdens of proof, and the like. It is likewise undisputable that the
legislative branch may make rules concerning the type of damages recoverable, the way in which
damages are paid, and the way a jury determines factual issues. See, e.g. New York Central Ry.
Co. v. White, 243 U.S. 188 (1917) (upholding workers compensation law). Just as certainly, the
legislature may abolish a common law right of action and, if it desires, replace it with a
compensation scheme. Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219 (1917).

The Constitution does not forbid the creation of new rights, or the abolition of old ones
recognized by the common law, to attain a permissible legislative object. Silver v. Silver, 280

preservation of existing rights, even as it creates new rights in a similar area of law.

Once again the defendants have failed to cite to the Court the applicable level of
judicial scrutiny they believe applies to their claims. In this instance they have conceded that the
“rational basis” test is the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny. (Dkt. # 396 at 37:1; Dkt. # 386
at 9:15). This is particularly true given that they have failed to make any showing that the right
they claim to an apportionment of damages is a “fundamental right” deserving of a higher level
of judicial scrutiny, or that they belong to a traditionally protected class.

Filed 01/25/10 Page 34 of 39

As part of the 1986 Tort Reform Act, the Washington Legislature created a regime of

2

proportionate damages for most causes of action. In doing so, the legislature preserved the

3

existing and long-standing traditional common law principle of joint and several liability

4

imposed on multiple tortfeasors when they caused a plaintiff indivisible injury. Kottler v. State,

5

136 Wn.2d 437, 442 (1998). Traditional common law joint and several liability was preserved

6

for the categories of actions specifically set forth in RCW 4.22.070(3), including “any cause of

7

action relating to hazardous . . . substances. Coulter v. Asten Group, Inc., 135 Wn. App. 613,

8

619.

9

In analyzing the application of RCW 4.22.070(3) to an asbestos-injury case, the

10

Washington Supreme Court found that the both the plain language of the statute and its

11

legislative history showed the legislature intended a broader application of RCW 4.22.070(3)(a)

12

than just “environmental pollution” cases, and that the statute applied to asbestos-injury cases.

13

Sofie v. Fibreboard, 122 Wn.2d 636, 668 (1989). A review of the legislative history of the

14

challenged section of the statute clearly evidences a concern for asbestos victims. See, e.g.

15

Senate Journal, 49th Legislature (1986) at 1483.

16
17
18
19
20
21

As Scapa points out, for those categories of actions to which the traditional common-law
joint and several liability was not preserved, tortfeasors are entitled to an apportionment of
damages, event if their co-tortfeasors are insolvent or otherwise immune to liability. Dkt. # 386
at 8:19-21; RCW 4.22.070(1). In operation, if a plaintiff cannot be made whole because other
parties who contributed to cause his injuries are insolvent or otherwise immune to liability, “then
so be it.”11 Dkt. # 386 at 8:21-25.

22
It is perfectly rational for the Legislature to determine that some tort victims should be

23
24
25
26
27
28

relieved of the risk that they will not be made whole due to the insolvency or other legal
immunity of some joint tortfeasors. In Washington, victims are relieved of this risk where their
harm stems from hazardous wastes or substances; where they have been harmed by the tortious
interference with their contracts or business relations; or where their harms stems from the
manufacture or marketing of a fungible product in a generic form which contains no clearly

There is nothing arbitrary about the Legislature minimizing the risk that asbestos-injury

victims will not be made whole. This is a rational policy decision to protect victims of toxic

5

exposures, uniquely within the province of the legislative branch to make. Absent a contrary

showing, the defendants’ arguments must fail.

The Defendants’ Due Process Challenge Is Premature

As an initial matter, it is plaintiffs’ contention that the due process challenges set forth in
the defendants’ briefing are to vague to respond to in a meaningful manner. It is manifestly

10

unclear whether the defendants are advancing a procedural due process argument, a substantive

11

due process argument, or both. As the Court is well aware, there are different standards of

12

review and analysis that apply to each. The Court and the plaintiffs should not have to guess at

13

what the defendants mean. Because of the incoherent nature of these allegations, the defendants

14

(purported) due process claims must fail.

15

As best as can be made out, the defendants claim that the application to them of joint and

16

several liability deprives them of their property without due process of law. However as a

17

common sense matter, whatever property right the defendants’ claim in an apportionment of

18

damages is “inchoate and affords no definite or enforceable property right until reduced to final

19

judgment.” Austin v. City of Bisbee, 855 F.2d 1429, 1435 (9th Cir. 1988). Because there has

20

been no final judgment entered, no party can be said to have been deprived of any property.

21

However even if the Court disagrees with this proposition, the defendants’ due process

22

arguments fail in the same manner as their equal protection claims. It is well-established that

23

legislative acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life come with a presumption of

24

constitutionality, and that the burden is on the party complaining of the due process violation to

25

establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary or irrational way. Ferguson v. Skurpa, 372

26

U.S. 726 (1963); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 487-488 (1955). The party

27

complaining of a due process violation must establish that the legislature has acted in an

28

arbitrary or irrational way. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 15 (1976). Here,
for the same reasons as set forth in response to the defendants’ equal protections claims, their

due process claims likewise fail because the government action they complain of is neither

2

arbitrary or irrational.

3

Plaintiffs vigorously disagree that the defendants are in any way foreclosed from seeking

4

contribution. RCW 4.22.050. It is perfectly within the defendants’ power to join those other

5

parties they believe are needed for a just adjudication. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 14. When the

6

defendants fail to take this action to protect their interests, they cannot complain their due

7

process rights have been violated. For these reasons their due process arguments also fail.

8

E.

It is important to note at the outset that the defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of

10

the evidence regarding the damages suffered by the Barabins. Dkt # 386 at 17:21-19:18; Dkt #

11

396 at 39:8-43:1. In this case all damage assessments made by the jury were well supported by

12

the evidence adduced at trial.

13

Each case is within the sound discretion of the jury. Morrissey v. Welsh Co., 821 F.2d

14

1294, 1301 (8th Cir. 1987). Each case is evaluated by a different, randomly selected group of

15

individual jurors. Id. The defendants only dispute with the verdict is that it is too high.

16

“We must expect substantial disparities among juries as to what constitutes
adequate compensation for certain types of pain and suffering. This is a litigious
fact of life of which counsel, clients and insurance carriers are fully aware. Once
they place their fate in the hands of a jury, then they should be prepared for the
result . . . They cannot expect the Court to extricate them in all cases where the
award is higher or lower than hoped for or anticipated.
Taken Alive v. Litzau, 551F.2d 196 (8th Cir. 1977) citing Mainelli v. Haberstroh, 237 F.Supp
190, 194 (M.D. Pa. 1964), aff’d 344 F.2d 965 (3rd Cir. 1965) (emphasis added).

unless it is clearly not supported by the evidence or only based in speculation or guesswork. In

award, the court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.
Fenner v. Dependable Trucking Co., 716 F.2d 598, 603 (9th Cir. 1983). If a court does decide to
remit a judgment, it must sustain the award at the maximum amount sustainable by the evidence.
D & S Redi-Mix v. Sierra Redi-Mix & Contracting, 692 F.2d 1245, 1249 (9th Cir. 1982).
In the Ninth Circuit, in reviewing a jury’s damages award, the district court must uphold

Objective evidence to support emotional distress awards required by other Circuits is not

8

the law of the Ninth Circuit, which holds that damages for emotional distress are subjective, may

9

be based on testimony alone, appropriate inference from the circumstances, or by reference to an

10

injured party’s conduct and the observations of others. Zhang v. Am. Gem. Seafoods, Inc., 339

11

F.3d 1020, 1040 (9th Cir. 2003). Indeed, evidence of emotional distress may be based solely on a

12

plaintiff’s own testimony. Id.

13

As in the case of awards for loss of consortium, awards for pain and suffering are highly

14

subjective. Depending on the fact situation, the range between an inadequate award for pain and

15

suffering and an excessive award can be enormous. Morrissey v. Welsh Co. at 1301

16

In this case, Dr. Ben-Zion offered substantial testimony regarding the Barabins’ non-

17

medical economic losses attributable to Mr. Barabin’s mesothelioma, arriving at a figure of

18

$500,200. See 15:2-37:19. The defendants offered no evidence to refute Dr. Ben-Zion’s

19

calculations.

20

Dr. Brodkin testified as the reasonable value of Mr. Barabin’s past medical losses, and to

21

the value of his future medical losses, arriving at a combined figure of $ 271,000. 81:6-82:13;

22

82:14-83:21. This evidence was also uncontradicted by the defendants. The jury ultimately

23

calculated the Barabins’ economic losses to be $ 700,000, a figure less than that calculated by

24

plaintiffs’ experts, but well within the range given by Dr. Ben-Zion.
Dr. Brodkin and Dr. Hammar both described in detail the brutal course mesothelioma

25
26

takes, from initial symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, to inevitable death. Henry Barabin testified

27

to the effects his mesothelioma has had on his life, discussing the pain and discomfort of the

28

various surgical procedures he has undergone, the impact of multiple rounds of chemotherapy,
and daily pain and discomfort he suffers, the drastic reduction in the activities he is able to

Barabin on these points, and adduced no evidence of their own to controvert Mr. Barabin’s

testimony.

6

The defendants claim that the verdict was excessive in comparison to the small pool of

previous Washington asbestos cases. While of dubious utility in comparing something that is

determined by each unique jury, a brief survey of other jurisdictions within and without the

those from around the country.12 There is nothing shocking or untoward about the jury’s

determination of damages in this case.

awarded $15 million non-economic damages and $1.925 million in economic damages to plaintiff dying
from mesothelioma);
The following cases come from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, MD: In the cases of Milton
Cichy and Reginald Puller, Consolidated Case No. 24X03000356 ( 2004), the jury awarded $4,000,000 in
non-economic damages to the Estate of Mr. Cichy, $2,000,000 for non-economic damages to Mr. Cichy’s
wife for loss of consortium; $1,000,000 to Mr. Cichy’s wife for wrongful death damages, and $500,000 to
Mr. Cichy’s daughter for wrongful death damages. In the Puller case, the jury awarded $6,500,000 in
non-economic survival damages, $2,000,000 to Mr. Puller’s wife for loss of consortium, $1,000,000 to
Mr. Puller’s wife for wrongful death damages, and $500,000 to Mr. Puller’s son for wrongful death
damages.
In 2003, a jury awarded damages in two mesothelioma cases tried before the Honorable Thomas
Noel. In the Walter Cooper case, the jury returned a verdict of $5,000,000 in non-economic survival
damages, $3,000,000 for loss of consortium, $1,000,000 in wrongful death damages to the wife and
$200,000 for each of three surviving children. The case of Charles Bildstein was tried at the same time.
The jury awarded a total of $10,403,666.00 in the Bildstein case. A $15,057,329.00 award (including
$57,329 in special damages) was returned for Diane Lester, a living mesothelioma victim whose case was
tried before the Judge Quarles in November, 2001. At the time of trial, Ms. Lester was 50 years old.
$8,025,949 (including $25,949 in special damages) was awarded to Antonio Colella in the same trial;
after a 2008 trial before the Honorable Carol Smith, a verdict was returned in the George Linkus
mesothelioma case, Case No. 24X05000315. The award included noneconomic damages of
$15,000,000.00, past medical expenses of $335,274.00.

Mrs. Barabin also testified with great effect to the impact of her husband’s illness on her

2

after their long and happy marriage together. 7:15-17:16. The defendants’ declined to cross-

3

examine Mrs. Barabin, and adduced no other evidence of their own relating to Mrs. Barabin’s

4

loss of consortium claim.13

5

The evidence of the damages sustained by the Barabins was uncontested. With regard to

6

the non-economic damages, the jury was instructed to exercise their judgment, and they did so.

7

After failing to provide the jury with any evidence or information with which to evaluate the

8

plaintiffs’ evidence, the defendants cannot claim the verdict was too high. The evidence of Mr.

9

Barabin’s terminal illness overwhelmingly supports the jury’s findings regarding damages, and

10

this evidence was un-controverted. There is nothing excessive, “monstrous” or “shocking to the

11

conscience” about the amount of the verdict, and it must be sustained.

For all the foregoing reasons, the defendants motions must be denied.

In addition to the loss of consortium verdicts set forth above, it may be helpful to consider the
following cases involving children, an area where the relationship between parent and child is less formed
than that of a long-term marriage: Reben v. Ely, 705 P.2d 1360 (1985) ($1,000,000 award for loss of

411 (1982) ($1,145,000 wrongful death award to estate of 13-year old boy; amount awarded was solely
for loss of society and companionship); Brownsville Medical Cntr. v. Garcia, 704 S.W.2d 462 (1986)
($500,000 award for loss of deceased child’s consortium upheld); Gulf States Utilities v. Reed 659
S.W.2d 849 (1983) ($500,000 award for loss of consortium to mother of child upheld as not excessive).
