Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59, Defendant Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. urges the Court to
order a new trial or, in the alternative, a remittitur for the following reasons:

20

•

Juror dishonesty during voir dire deprived Scapa of a fair trial.

21

•

Juror misconduct during deliberation deprived Scapa of a fair trial.

22

•

The Court's exclusion of collateral-source evidence after Mrs. Barabin testified about
her fear of being left destitute caused the jury to award excessive damages.

•

Scapa was denied an apportionment of damages by a Washington statute that violates
the United States Constitution.

The jury's verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.

2

•

The Court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of Plaintiffs' experts
Cohen, Brodkin and Millette, by allowing evidence in support of Plaintiff severy

•

The Court erroneously charged the jury.

•

Juror Dishonesty During Voir Dire Deprived Scapa Of A Fair Trial.
Against the backdrop of an "ordinary" verdict, evidence of juror dishonesty during voir

dire is troubling enough. But in an outlier case like this - involving a remarkably large award
for non-economic damages that can only be explained by the information the jurors withheld it is a particularly serious matter indeed, and the interests of justice very clearly demand a new
trial.

A new trial for juror dishonesty during voir dire should be granted when (i) a juror
failed to answer honestly a material question; and (ii) the correct answer would have provided
a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Price v. Kramer, 200 F.3d 1237, 1254 (9th Cir. 2000).
Juror challenges are governed by 28 U.S.C. §1870, and challenges for cause must be based on
a narrowly specified, provable, and legally cognizable basis of partiality.

11

against Scapa, the Court should hold that Washington law unconstitutionally deprived Scapa of

12

a fault apportionment and grant a new trial so that Scapa can secure that apportionment.
1.

13

Imposing joint and several liability on Scapa would violate the Equal Protection
Clause of the United States Constitution.

14
Joint and several liability has been justified on the grounds that when the plaintiff
15
sustains an indivisible injury caused by multiple tortfeasors, the wrongdoers should not escape
16
liability merely because the plaintiff cannot prove which wrongdoer caused what degree or
17
portion of the injury. See Coulter, 146 P.2d at 446; RESTATEMENT(THIRD)OF TORTS § 27E,
18
Reporter's Note, cmt. b (1998). In Washington, however, most defendants are not subject to
19
joint and several liability. Instead, they entitled to an apportionment of damages - even if they
20
contribute to cause an indivisible injury, and even if their co-tortfeasors

are insolvent or

21
immune to liability.

See WASH. REv. CODE ANN. § 4.22.070(1).

In other words, most

22
defendants pay damages in an amount reflecting only their degree of fault as found by the jury;
23
if the plaintiff cannot be made whole because other parties who contributed to cause his
24
injuries are insolvent or immune to liability, then so be it.

Imposing joint and several liability would deprive Scapa of its property without

10
In addition, the application of this law to asbestos cases is fraught with a umque
11
inequity: plaintiffs can and do manipulate the process to deprive defendants of an appropriate
12
reduction in their liability.

The Washington

law allows a Defendant whose liability is

13
predicated on Section 4.22.070(3)(a)

a "credit" for amounts paid in settlement by other

14
responsible parties.

In asbestos cases generally and in the present case, the plaintiff or his

15
counsel acknowledge that non-parties' conduct was a substantial factor in causing the disease
16
and that mesothelioma is a total-dose disease.

Here, as in other cases, Plaintiff nonetheless

17
made no effort to recover monies from many of those admittedly responsible parties. During
18
trial, Plaintiff then asked the jury to award him the full measure of all damages proximately
19
caused by his development of mesothelioma, including the portion of the damages attributable
20
to non-trial

defendants.

This manipulation

of the process

renders

the law per se

21
unconstitutional as applied to asbestos cases.
22

Under Section 4.22.070(3)(a), a defendant has no input or control over its liability to
23
the plaintiff for damages caused by others.

The plaintiff exercises absolute control over

Plaintiffs in asbestos cases routinely abuse this prerogative to avoid any admission that parties

when they do so, Washington law does not allow the defendant to seek contribution from those

Washington law and is unsupported by the great weight of the

•

No Scapa asbestos-containing product posed a hazard to Mr. Barabin.
(Plaintiffs did not produce a single medical or scientific publication that
asbestos-containing dryer felts pose a danger when used in paper mills,

felts do not release asbestos fibers in a quantity exceeding ambient air

The Court Erroneously Charged The Jury.

11

law. See Martin v. California Dept. of Veterans Affairs, 560 F.2d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 2009).

12

Here, a new trial is necessary because the Court:

13

• did not correctly instruct the jury on substantial factor causation;

14

• did not include a state of the art component in its strict liability instruction;

15

• erroneously instructed the jury that there was a continuing duty to warn; and

16

• failed to include an exposure question on the verdict form.

17
These complaints were timely raised at trial, and Defendants fully advised the Court of the
18
factual and legal bases for their complaints.

As explained in more detail in Defendant Asten's

19
motion for new trial, these errors in the charge were reasonably calculated to and probably did

cause the jury to return an improper verdict.

Draper v. Airco, Inc., 580 F.2d 91, 95 (3d Cir. 1978). The introduction of purely emotional

Williams Dec., Ex. A at 11116/09, 62:20-22.
7
That statement suggested to the jury that Scapa acted with a degree of calculated
8

intentional malevolence - a suggestion that had no foundation in this trial on negligence and
9

strict liability. This was an improper appeal to the jury's passions. See Marcoux v. Farm Servo
10
& Supplies, Inc., 290 F. Supp. 2d 457, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). In effect, Plaintiffs' counsel was

damages are not in issue. Nice

V.

ZHRI, Inc., 105 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1029 (E.D. Ark. 2000).

13
Moreover, the statement improperly went outside the record by referring to Scapa
14
killing and hurting others, i.e., nonparties, when there was no evidence of such, and it
15
improperly encouraged the jury to render a verdict that would punish Scapa for injuries it had
16
allegedly inflicted on others.

Given the United States Supreme Court's

holding that a

litigation, that argument was clearly improper.
