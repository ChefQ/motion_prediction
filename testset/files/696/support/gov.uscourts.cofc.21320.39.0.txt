UNITED STATES’ MOTION FOR PROTECTION OR PROTECTIVE ORDER
Plaintiffs served a Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6) deposition notice on July 9, 2007, for a
deposition(s) scheduled on July 20, 2007. The United States seeks protection from the notice
because: (1) it seeks testimony on irrelevant matters, including legal and opinion testimony from
fact witnesses; (2) it seeks testimony protected by executive (deliberative process) privilege; (3) it
seeks testimony to authenticate irrelevant material, produced during discovery along with a
relevancy objection, for which a declaration has already been provided along with a detailed
privilege log; and (4) the representative qualified to testify on the relevant portion of the notice is
unavailable on the noticed date. The United States respectfully requests that compliance with the
deposition notice be limited to testimony of a United States representative familiar with the audit
of plaintiff’s tax returns and to facts directly related to that audit.
This litigation involves a challenge by various entities controlled by the Sands family
(“plaintiffs”) to Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments (FPAAs) disallowing artificial losses
claimed on the entities’ partnerships’ returns.

The parties’ positions regarding the underlying

transactions are set out in the parties’ competing motions for summary judgment and pleadings filed
in connection with plaintiffs’ Motion to Substitute Party and to Dismiss Certain Causes of Action
for Lack of Jurisdiction.

On July 9, 2007, plaintiffs served the attached Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6) Notice to
Defendant. This notice seeks to depose one or more representative of the United States with respect
to eight separately enumerated categories (plus several subcategories). Because at least part of each
category designated by plaintiffs is objectionable, and because the representative familiar with the
underlying audits is unavailable on the scheduled date of the deposition, relief is sought as to all of
the enumerated categories. Each of the categories will be addressed below.
OBJECTIONABLE CATEGORIES OF PLAINTIFFS’ RULE 30(b)(6) NOTICE
1.
The identity and contents of documents produced in defendant's Rule 26(a) disclosures
or in response to plaintiffs' discovery requests, including, but not limited to the documents in
defendant's administrative file(s) relating to the audits of plaintiffs.
The United States does not object to providing a representative to testify regarding the
identity and contents of its previously produced IRS administrative audit files, and it requests that
testimony be so limited. However, its representative with knowledge of these documents (Pete
Brokus) is unavailable for deposition on July 20, 2007, due to a previously scheduled conflict. The
United States will coordinate with plaintiffs for a subsequent date for Mr. Brokus’ deposition.
The United States seeks relief to the extent that the notice covers documents produced by
the United States in response to plaintiffs’ document production requests 15 - 29 and 35, which
relate specifically to statutory construction, IRS internal policy and legal conclusions. In each
instance, an objection to relevance was made regarding the production request. (The views of IRS
employees in construing regulations or determining the validity thereof are irrelevant and a
deposition seeking such testimony is nothing more than an impermissible fishing expedition.
Evergreen Trading, LLC v. United States, 75 Fed. Cl. 730, 730-31 (2007)). The documents produced
in response to these document production requests were accompanied by both a declaration and a

detailed privilege log identifying the documents.

Filed 07/18/2007

Page 5 of 17

Even if the documents were somehow relevant,

which they are not, the costs and waste of resources contemplated by multiple depositions to confirm
the identity and content of this material is not justified. See Exxon Research and Engineering Co.
v. United States, 44 Fed.Cl. 597 (1999).
2.
The identity and contents of documents in files of The Heritage Organization LLP
reviewed by defendant's agents incident to their work in this matter.
Because the terms “agents’ and “work” are undefined, this category is unduly broad and
includes materials gathered by counsel in preparation for trial. As previously disclosed to plaintiffs,
the United States is in the process of reviewing files currently in the possession of the Chapter 11
Trustee for The Heritage Organization, LLP (“Heritage”) bankruptcy estate.

At this point, it

appears that some of the material in the Trustee’s possession is relevant to the transaction involving
plaintiffs. However, the United States should not be required to produce a representative who can
be designated to testify with respect to these documents. Naturally, this material, to the extent that
it is relevant, will be produced to plaintiffs either in supplement to the United States’ initial
disclosures or in response to document production requests. If plaintiffs are not satisfied with the
documents themselves, they are welcome to obtain the files directly from the Trustee.
The United States also seeks protection with respect to this category as it could be construed
to files of other taxpayers as the disclosure of this information is prohibited by 26 U.S.C. §6103..

The United States asks that this category be confined to testimony by IRS agents to Heritage
documents reviewed by the examining agents in connection with the IRS audit underlying the
FPAAs now at issue. See Deseret Management Corporation v. United States, 76 Fed. Cl. 88 (2007)
(recognizing both attorney-client and attorney work product privilege).

As previously stated,

subject to the above objections, the United States does not object to providing a representative to
testify regarding the identity and contents of Heritage documents contained in the previously
produced administrative audit files. However, its representative with knowledge of these
documents (Pete Brokus) is unavailable for deposition on July 20, 2007, due to a previously
scheduled conflict. The United States will coordinate with plaintiffs for a subsequent date for Mr.
Brokus’ deposition.
3.
The identity and contents of documents from the files of any other third parties
(individuals or entities other than plaintiffs, plaintiffs' partners, or The Heritage
Organization) reviewed by defendant's agents incident to their work in this matter.
The United States seeks protection with respect to this category as it is unduly vague.
Clearly, the terms “agent” and “work” is broad enough to include IRS and DOJ attorneys. This
request is also broad enough to include third party taxpayer information which is prohibited from
disclosure by 26 U.S.C. §6103. the United States seeks protection limiting the request to documents
reviewed by the IRS examining agents in connection with the audit underlying the FPAAs now at
issue. See Deseret Management Corporation v. United States, 76 F.Cl. 88 (2007)(recognizing both
attorney-client and attorney work product privilege).
Subject to the above objections, the United States does not object to providing a
representative to testify regarding the identity and contents of documents from the files of any other
third parties (individuals or entities other than plaintiffs, plaintiffs' partners, or The Heritage
Organization) reviewed by the examining agents in connection with the audit underlying the FPAAs
now at issue, and it requests that testimony regarding this category be so limited. However, its

July 20, 2007, due to a previously scheduled conflict. The United States will coordinate with
plaintiffs for a subsequent date for Mr. Brokus’ deposition.
4.
The conduct of the IRS audits of plaintiffs and their partners, including, but not limited
to issuance of the Notices of Beginning of Administrative Proceeding, issuance of information
document requests, responses to information document requests, summonses, and interviews.
This litigation involves plaintiffs’ use of two abusive tax shelters. It is plaintiffs’ conduct
and not that of the United States that is at issue in this litigation. The United States seeks protection
from this line of inquiry to the extent that it can be interpreted as an attempt to solicit testimony
regarding the analyses and deliberations of the IRS in connection with issuing the FPAA to
plaintiffs. This is a de novo proceeding in which the FPAA is presumed correct and the court has
jurisdiction to determine all of the partnership items of the plaintiffs. The reasons for the
Commissioner’s determination are not relevant because the court does not review the administrative
policy and procedure of that determination. Greenberg’s Express, Inc. v. Commissioner, 62 T.C.
324, 327-8 (1974). As such, the deliberative process of the Internal Revenue Service in the issuance
of the FPAA is irrelevant. See also Deseret Management Corporation v. United States, 76 Fed. Cl.
88 (2007)(recognizing that deliberative process privilege “covers documents reflecting advisory
opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental
decisions and policies are formulated”).
Subject to the above objections, the United States does not object to providing a
representative to testify regarding the course of the audit underlying the FPAAs at issue, and it
requests that testimony regarding this category be so limited. However, its representative with
knowledge of these facts (Pete Brokus) is unavailable for deposition on July 20, 2007, due to a

date for Mr. Brokus’ deposition.

which defendant based its determinations/adjustments in the following portions of the FPAAs
issued to plaintiffs:
a.

The United States seeks protection from this line of inquiry to the extent that it seeks legal
or opinion testimony. To the extent that plaintiffs are seeking expert testimony on these matters, the
request is premature. Expert witnesses will be made available at the appropriate time after expert
reports have been exchanged. To the extent that plaintiffs seek legal or opinion testimony from IRS
personnel, such testimony is not calculated to lead to relevant facts and/or is it is privileged. The
views and opinions of IRS employees are irrelevant. This is a de novo proceeding in which the
FPAA is presumed correct and the court has jurisdiction to determine all of the partnership items

court does not review the administrative policy and procedure of that determination. Greenberg’s
Express, Inc. v. Commissioner, 62 T.C. 324, 327-8 (1974). The deliberative process of the Internal
Revenue Service in the issuance of the FPAA is irrelevant. See also Deseret Management
Corporation v. United States, 76 Fed. Cl. 88 (2007)(recognizing that deliberative process privilege
“covers documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising
part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated”).
Subject to the above objections, the United States does not object to providing a
representative to testify regarding the facts supporting the above referenced portions of the FPAAs,
and it requests that testimony regarding this category be so limited. However, its representative
with knowledge of these facts (Pete Brokus) is unavailable for deposition on July 20, 2007, due to
a previously scheduled conflict. The United States will coordinate with plaintiffs for a subsequent
date for Mr. Brokus’ deposition.
6.
The conduct of the IRS in determining to apply accuracy-related penalties to Plaintiffs,
including but not limited the following:
a.
The facts gathered, discovered, or relied on to support the IRS's alternative
determination that plaintiffs failed to make a reasonable attempt to comply with
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or were careless, reckless or
intentionally disregarded any rules or regulations.
b.
The facts gathered, discovered, or relied on to support the IRS's alternative
determination that plaintiffs' made substantial understatements.
c.
The facts gathered, discovered, or relied on to support the IRS's alternative
determination that any such understatement should not be reduced because
such understatement was attributable to tax treatment of an item for which
there was substantial authority or was attributable to the tax treatment of an
item which was adequately disclosed on the tax return and for which there was
a reasonable basis.
d.
The facts gathered, discovered, or relied on to support the IRS's alternative
determination that plaintiffs' made a substantial valuation misstatement,
including any appraisals or calculations.

The United States seeks protection with respect to the entirety of this line of inquiry. Here,
plaintiffs seek to obtain testimony with respect to documents which are both irrelevant and protected
by executive (deliberative process) privilege. Essentially, plaintiffs seek to go around objections
previously raised in response to document production requests. The IRS’s interpretation and
application of 26 U.S.C. §752 is not relevant nor is it likely to lead to the discovery of relevant
information. The views and opinions of IRS employees are irrelevant.

See also Deseret Management Corporation v. United States, 76 Fed. Cl. 88 (2007)(recognizing that
deliberative process privilege “covers documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations
and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are
formulated”).
The proper construction of Section 752 and the regulations, as well as their application to
the transactions at issue here, is an issue of law for the Court to decide based upon its analysis and
application of the governing legal authorities. See, e.g, Neptune v. United States, 38 Fed.Cl. 510,
513 (1997), affd 178 F.3d 1306 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Two circuit courts have recently reached similar
conclusions in refusing to rely upon the statements of former government officials in construing tax
regulations. In Siddell v Commissioner, 225 F.3d 103, 111 (1st Cir. 2000), a case involving a dispute
concerning the construction of a regulation, the First Circuit rejected as irrelevant the taxpayers’
attempted reliance upon internal Service memoranda purportedly showing the Service’s internal
construction of a regulation, stating—
Because these internal memoranda represent the personal views of the authors, not
the official position of the agency, they do not figure in our decisional calculus.
The Third Circuit, similarly rejecting an effort to rely upon evidence of internal Service discussions
in construing a regulation, stated that “we accord little weight to the . . . recollections of the several
Treasury officials who submitted affidavits regarding the meaning of the [regulation.]” Connecticut
General Life Insurance Co. v. Commissioner, 177 F.3d 136, 145 (3rd Cir. 1999). See Armco Corp.
v. Commissioner, 87 T.C. 865, 867-68 ((1986)(statement of principal drafter not relevant in
construing regulation). All of these cases show that, even if the proposed depositions were to
produce the testimony plaintiffs hope to develop, that evidence would still have no value.

Page 15 of 17

At least three separate rationales support this unanimous conclusion that the testimony of the
drafters is not relevant in construing a regulation. First, such testimony impinges upon the role of
the Court as the arbiter of the law. Second, after-the-fact testimony concerning the meaning of a
regulation developed in the context of litigation is inherently unreliable. Finally, the cases recognize
that the testimony of a single agency official is of no value in determining the agency’s construction
of a regulation.1 Regardless of the rationale, the depositions are irrelevant and the motion for
protective order should be granted.
As previously noted, notwithstanding the fact that documents referenced by this line of
inquiry are irrelevant to the claims and defenses presented in this case, plaintiffs previously sought

1

The Court appears to have adopted this rationale in barring proposed discovery of
internal background files concerning the development of a Service ruling, stating–
will be relevant in this action only in very limited circumstances. And, even in those
limited circumstances, various materials in those files undoubtedly will shed no light
whatsoever on what the IRS, as an agency, felt the ruling meant or means. Thus, for
example, the files could contain memoranda from individual IRS line attorneys
setting forth positions that do not represent the agency's formal view of the law,
including positions that were rejected by the IRS or the Treasury Department in
choosing the final terminology and scope of the ruling. In this regard, plaintiff's
attempt to analogize the ruling's background file to a statute's legislative history, in
fact, proves informative, but only in sounding a note of caution. Seemingly, just as
courts often refuse to attribute to Congress views expressed by a staffer or an
individual member of Congress, particularly where such statements are made after
the passage of a law, so too should this court be extraordinarily hesitant to attribute
to the IRS or the Treasury Department interpretations of a revenue ruling made by
individual IRS employees that represent their personal views, rather than the official
position of the agency. Thus, even if, in general, the background file of a revenue
ruling might, in highly limited circumstances, be relevant in resolving a question of
statutory construction, it remains that the only materials in that file that would figure
in this court's decisional calculus are those reflecting some high level of agency
approval.

the production of the documents related to this line of inquiry by way of document production
requests. Both relevancy and executive (deliberative process) privilege objections were made at the
time. Limited documents were produced, however, in response to these document production
requests and the documents were accompanied by both a declaration regarding the documents and
a detailed privilege log identifying the documents.

As such, the costs and waste of resources

contemplated by multiple depositions to confirm the identity and content of this irrelevant material
is not justified. See Exxon Research and Engineering Co. v. United States, 44 Fed.Cl. 597 (1999).
A protective order is also appropriate because the requested depositions seek disclosure of
privileged information. The law recognizes a deliberative process privilege protecting the internal
pre-decisional deliberations of a government agency from disclosure. See Deseret Management,
76 Fed .Cl. at 94-95)(recognizing that deliberative process privilege “covers documents reflecting
advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which
governmental decisions and policies are formulated”).

The Supreme Court recognized such a

privilege in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974), explaining that “[h]uman experience
teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with
a concern for appearances . . . to the detriment of the decision making process.” Given the strong
public interest in having Government officials candidly discuss prospective operations and policies,
it is well-established that the Government may invoke a privilege that is not available to other
parties. The executive privilege allows the Government to prevent the disclosure of the discussions,
recommendations, and methods of reasoning of its officials, which, if subject to disclosure, would
temper candor during the decision-making process. E.g., NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S.

at 151; Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. United States, 141 Ct. Cl. 38, 47-50, 157 F. Supp.
939, 944-47 (1958).
In this court, the executive privilege protects “inter- and intra-agency deliberative
communications or official information, [and] protects ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,
recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions
and policies are formulated.’” CACI Field Services, Inc. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 680, 686
(1987). As such, the United States is entitled to protection from Plaintiffs’ Rule 30(b)(6) Notice
seeking testimony on these privileged matters.
For the reasons set out above, the United States respectfully requests that the Court grant it
protection from plaintiffs’ Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice and that the Court limit the scope of any
such deposition(s) to testimony of a United States representative familiar with the audit of plaintiff’s
tax returns and to facts directly related to that audit.
Respectfully submitted,
