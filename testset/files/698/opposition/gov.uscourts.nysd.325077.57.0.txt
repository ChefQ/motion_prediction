Case No. 08-cv-4068 (CLB)

KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS ELECTRONICS N.V. AND U.S. PHILIPS CORPORATION'S
MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO CARBONITE AND HAL LEONARD'S JOINT
MOTION TO DISMISS PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST CUSTOMERS

Plaintiffs Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. and U.S. Philips Corporation (collectively

"Philips") hereby oppose Carbonite Inc.'s and Hal Leonard Corp.'s (collectively "Customers")

Joint Motion to Dismiss Patent Infringement Claims Against Customers (Document No. 39).
Case 7:08-cv-04068-CS-GAY Document57 Filed 07/14/2008 Page 2of6

Because Defendant Intuit, Inc. withdrew from the Joint Motion (Document No. 45), Philips'
Opposition does not address that Defendant's motion to dismiss.
L SUMMARY

Customers contend that, as a matter of law, they cannot be liable for patent infringement
because Philips' patent rights were exhausted when the Customers purchased the infringing CDs
from a licensed manufacturer. Customers' analysis, however, suffers from a critical flaw,
namely, their improper assumption that they purchase authorized CDs from Philips' licensees.
Nothing could be further from the truth, and such an assumption is contrary to Philips' First
Amended Complaint, which specifically alleges why such CD sales are not authorized. The
mere fact that Philips has entered into valid license agreements with CD replicators or
manufacturers does not establish that any sale by such licensees is automatically an authorized
sale. To the contrary, where, as here, a licensee fails to perform under the license (by not paying
royalties), any CD sales by the licensee are not authorized. Because such CD sales are not
authorized, there can be no exhaustion of Philips' patent rights as a matter of law. Thus,
Customers' Joint Motion to Dismiss must fail.

L ARGUMENT
A. Applicable Standard - Rule 12(b)(6) Motions

On a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the material allegations of a
Complaint are taken as true, and a Complaint is liberally construed in plaintiffs favor. Jenkins v.
McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421-22, 89 S. Ct. 1843, 1849 (1969), see also ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v.
Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007) (explaining that courts must consider motions
to dismiss by "accepting all factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable
inferences in the plaintiff's favor."). Motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are rarely granted

and are generally viewed with disfavor. See Patane v. Clark, 508 F.3d 106, 116 (2d Cir. 2007).
Case 7:08-cv-04068-CS-GAY Document57 Filed 07/14/2008 Page 3of6

Indeed, a well-pleaded Complaint may proceed even if it appears that a recovery is very remote
and unlikely. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007). Whether the
plaintiff may ultimately prevail is irrelevant for purposes of deciding a motion to dismiss.
Bernheim v. Litt, 79 F.3d 318, 321 (2d Cir. 1996).

B. The Patent Exhaustion Doctrine Does Not Prevent Philips From Asserting Its

Patent Rights Against the Customers Because the CD Sales Were Not
Authorized

Because Customers do not purchase authorized CDs from Philips' licensees, they are
simply wrong that the doctrine of patent exhaustion precludes Philips from enforcing its patent
rights against them. Indeed, it is well-established that patent "[e]xhaustion is triggered only by a
sale authorized by the patent holder." Quanta Computer Inc. v. LG, Electronics, Inc., 128 S. Ct.
2109, 2121 (US 2008). Customers do not and cannot contest this point of law. Instead, they
point to the mere existence of a valid license agreement between Philips and manufacturers, such
as Advanced Duplication Services LLC ("ADS"), Zomax Incorporated ("Zomax"), and Inoveris
LLC ("Inoveris"), and suggest that any CD purchases from those licensees are automatically
authorized. This argument is flawed. Not only is it inconsistent with fundamental legal
principles, but it runs contrary to Philips' factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint.

It is hornbook law that the mere existence of a license does not provide a complete
defense for purposes of infringement or patent exhaustion. General Talking Pictures Corp. v
Western Elec. Co., 305 U.S. 124, 126-27 (1938). Where a licensee makes and sells a patented
article in violation of the terms of its license, "the effect is precisely the same as if no license
whatsoever had been granted," and the patentee can sue both the licensee and the purchaser for
infringement of the patent. Jd. at 127. Thus, the issue of whether patent exhaustion attaches
turns in part on whether the activity or sales are authorized under the license, not on the mere

existence of a license. See Quanta, 128 S. Ct. at 2122. Here, Philips clearly alleges in its First
Case 7:08-cv-04068-CS-GAY Document57 Filed 07/14/2008 Page 4of6

Amended Complaint that Customers' purchases of CDs made or sold by Philip's licensees, who
are in material breach of their license agreements, are not authorized.

In the First Amended Complaint, Philips alleges that Customers ADS, Zomax, Inoveris,
and others were granted a license to make and sell CDs falling within the claims of U.S. Patent
No. 5,068,846. (First Amended Complaint ("FAC") ff 54, 57, 59, 61, 68). However, Customers
ignore Philips' express allegations that any such licensed right to make and sell CDs is
contingent upon the payment of royalties to Philips. (FAC 4] 75-78, 96). Customers also
disregard Philips' allegation that the Defendant licensees have been making and selling CDs
covered by the `846 Patent without paying the required royalties. (FAC J 87-90, 95-97). Thus,
the CD sales that Customers cling to are not authorized.

To suggest otherwise - as Customers do - vitiates a basic licensing principle: a patent
owner who licenses sales of a patented device rightfully expects to receive the value of the patent
in exchange for the license. Because Philips' licensees have failed to pay the necessary royalties
in conjunction with their licenses - factual allegations that must be accepted as true for the
purposes of this motion, ATS7 Commce'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir.
2007) - any downstream CD sales from the Defendant licensees are not authorized. Thus,
Customers cannot rely on these sales to invoke patent exhaustion.

Customers' reliance on Quanta is misplaced. In fact, nothing in Quanta supports
Customers' position that patent exhaustion applies here. The Supreme Court's finding of patent
exhaustion in Quanta was based on the fact that there was an authorized sale from LG's licensee,
Intel, to Quanta, the defendant. Quanta, 128 S. Ct. at 2121-22. There was no allegation that Intel
had failed to pay royalties to LG, and there certainly was no finding that Intel's sales of the

licensed products were unauthorized. Thus, Quanta's application of patent exhaustion was
Case 7:08-cv-04068-CS-GAY Document57 Filed 07/14/2008 Page 5of6

limited to authorized downstream sales. Unlike Quanta, this case concerns unauthorized
downstream sales. Therefore, Quanta supports Philips' position that Customers' motion should
be denied. Quanta expressly recognizes that unauthorized sales - such as those present here -
do not trigger patent exhaustion. Jd. at 2122.

Moreover, the Supreme Court's analysis in Quanta contradicts Customers' broad
allegation that the mere existence of a license between Philips and ADS, Zomax, or Inoveris
establishes authorized sales. If Customers were correct, the Supreme Court would have had no
reason to analyze the license agreements at issue in Quanta. Instead, the Court would have
ended its inquiry and based its finding of exhaustion on the mere fact that the plaintiff had
licensed its patent portfolio to another party. That, of course, is not how Quanta played out.
Quanta specifically inquired as to whether the sale under the license was authorized. Jd. When
taken as true as the law requires, Philips' allegations establish that the downstream CD sales
from the Defendant licensees are unauthorized, and that as the patentee, Philips can sue both the
licensees and the Customers for infringement of its patent.

Il. CONCLUSION

For these reasons, Philips respectfully urges this Court to deny Customers' Joint Motion
to Dismiss Patent Infringement Claims Against Customers based on Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).
