JOINT MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS
PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST CUSTOMERS

Case 7:08-cv-04068-RGS

In response to the First Amended Complaint, filed by plaintiffs Koninklijke Philips
Electronics, N.V.’s and U.S. Philips Corporation’s (collectively referred to as “Philips”), on June
10, 2008, defendants Carbonite Inc. (“Carbonite”), Hal Leonard Corp. (“Hal Leonard”) and
Intuit Inc. (“Intuit”) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Customers”) hereby jointly
submit the following memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss Count II of the
Amended Complaint, for failure to state a claim for relief. Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P.1
Plaintiffs’ second Count purportedly stating a claim for patent infringement against the
Customers cannot be maintained as a matter of law where the Customers have purchased the
alleged infringing products from licensed manufacturers. As a result, the Customers respectfully
request that the second Count of the First Amended Complaint be dismissed in its entirety.
I.

BACKGROUND
On April 30, 2008, Philips filed its complaint alleging breach of contract, patent

infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,068,846 (“the ‘846 Patent”) and a constructive trust against
Defendants.2 (Dkt#1). On June 10, 2008, prior to any response from Defendants, Philips filed
its First Amended Complaint which changed U.S. Philips Corporation’s address, dropped
Malaco Entertainment LLC as a party and added Concord Records, Inc. as a defendant.
(Dkt#20). The alleged patent infringement claims against defendants, including the Customers,
remained the same. (Dkt#1 & 20). Of relevance to this motion is Count II, which alleges that
the Customers have infringed the ‘846 Patent (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 145).

1

The parties stipulated that defendants would have until June 26, 2008 to answer or otherwise
move in response to the Amended Complaint.
2

The breach of contract claim (Count I) is against all defendants, except customers. The
constructive trust claim (Count III) is only against defendants Eva-tone, Inc. and Music City
Optical Media, Inc.

According to the First Amended Complaint, Customer Hal Leonard purchases CDs from
Defendant The ADS Group a/k/a Advanced Duplication Services LLC (“ADS”) and Customers
Carbonite and Intuit purchase CDs from Defendant Zomax Incorporated (“Zomax”).

Also

according to the Amended Complaint, ADS and Zomax have entered into a “CD Disc Patent
License Agreement” with Philips on July 1, 2002 (“ADS Agreement”) and October 1, 2003
(“Zomax Agreement”), respectively. (First Amended Complaint, Exhibits B and Q).
In Paragraph 128 of the First Amended Complaint, Philips states that the ADS
Agreement and the Zomax Agreement are “valid and subsisting agreements under New York
law.” (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 128).
II.

ARGUMENT
A. The Applicable Standard
Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court should dismiss a claim if Plaintiff "can prove no set of

facts, consistent with its complaint, that would entitle it to relief." Electronics Communications
Corp. v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., 129 F.3d 240, 243 (2d Cir. 1997). As the Second
Circuit recently explained, in considering a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for
failure to state a claim, the Court must accept “all factual allegations in the complaint and [draw]
all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. ATSI Communs. Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd, 493
F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). However, the allegations found in the complaint “must be enough to
raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955,
1965 (2007). Ultimately, a court should dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim when the
complaint fails to include “plausible grounds” for relief. Id.

B. Philips’ Patent Infringement Claim Against Customers Should Be Dismissed
Because According to the First Amended Complaint A Valid License Agreement
Exists Between Philips And ADS and Zomax And Philips’ Patent Rights Were
Exhausted Once It Authorized ADS And Zomax To Sell CDs To Customers
Philips has failed to state plausible grounds for relief on its patent infringement claims
against the Customers because according to the First Amended Complaint a valid license
agreement exists between Philips and ADS on one hand, and Philips and Zomax on the other,
with respect to the patent-in-suit. See (First Amended Complaint, ¶128). A license provides a
complete defense to Philips’ infringement claims against the Customers under the doctrine of
patent exhaustion.
The doctrine of patent exhaustion precludes a patent owner from asserting patent rights
against subsequent purchasers of authorized goods.

See Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG

Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. __ (June 9, 2008) (Slip Opinion attached as Exhibit 1).
In Quanta, the patent owner, LG Electronics, Inc. (“LGE”), licensed a patent portfolio to
Intel Corporation (“Intel”), which authorized Intel to manufacture and sell products
(microprocessors and chipsets) that use the LGE patents. Id. at 3. Quanta was a customer of
Intel who purchased the authorized products from Intel, and then combined them with non-Intel
components to make computers.

Id. at 4.

LGE subsequently sued Quanta for patent

infringement. In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court held that LGE’s patent rights were
exhausted when it authorized Intel to sell the products which embody the LGE patents, whose
only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent[s].” 3 Id. at 12. The Court held that

3

The Court noted that, notwithstanding the requirement in the agreement to notify its customers
that combinations of licensed products with non-Intel components to make new products were
not licensed by LGE, there was nothing in the LGE/Intel agreement which restricted Intel’s right
to sell the patented products. Id. at 17. The Court also found that it was irrelevant that LGE
expressly disclaimed any license to Intel’s customers because “exhaustion turns only on Intel’s
4

the sale of the patented product by Intel to Quanta was an authorized sale and that “Intel’s
authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as
a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta.” Id. at 19.
The same result follows here, and bars Philips’ claims against the Customers. Specifically,
Philips’ statement in the Amended Complaint that the Zomax and ADS Agreements are valid
and subsisting is an admission that ADS and Zomax are authorized to sell CDs to their
customers.4 (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 128). As in Quanta, there was nothing in the Zomax
or ADS Agreements which restricted Zomax’ or ADS’ sale of CDs. Zomax’ and ADS’ right to
sell was unconditional, and indeed, was expressly provided for in both agreements. Because
Philips authorized Zomax and ADS to sell CDs which allegedly embody the patent-in-suit and
which were sold by Zomax and ADS to Customers, Philips is now prevented “from further
asserting its patent rights with respect to the patents substantially embodied by those products.”
Id. at 18.
Philips’ patent rights were exhausted when Philips authorized ADS and Zomax to sell
CDs to the Customers and Philips is estopped from asserting those rights against downstream
purchasers of CDs, such as the Customers. Accordingly, Philips’ claims against the Customers
must fail as a matter of law and should be dismissed in their entirety.

own license to sell products practicing the LGE Patents.” Id. at 18. In other words, Intel’s
customers did not need a license because the exhaustion analysis stopped at Intel and LGE’s
patent rights already had been exhausted.
4

It is irrelevant to Philips’ claim against the Customers that Philips is alleging breach of the
Zomax and ADS Agreements by Defendants Zomax and ADS. By Philips’ own allegation in the
Amended Complaint, the Zomax and ADS Agreements are valid and subsisting. (First Amended
Complaint, ¶128).

CONCLUSION
Because the Second Count of the First Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for relief

under any viable legal theory, the Customers respectfully request that their motion to dismiss
such Count be granted.
