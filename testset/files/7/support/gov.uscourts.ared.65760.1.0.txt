FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS hgh

 

IN THE MATTER OF MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA INDEX NO. LOMO? &

ISSUED BY DEFENDANT IN THE CASE OF STEINBUCH

v. CUTLER (DISTRICT COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF ORAL ARGUMENT REQUES .
COLUMBIA, 01:05-CV-00970) . . a
This case assigned to District Judge

and to Magistrate Judge
MOTION TO QUASH AND FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

 

Plaintiff requests that this Court quash Defendant's improper third-party
discovery requests served on his current employer, the University of Arkansas School of
Law, and issue a protective order to prevent Defendants further attempts to harass,
embarrass, and interfere with the current employment of Plaintiff.

Over two years ago, Defendant intentionally publicized private facts of Plaintiff
on the internet and placed Plaintiff in false light, causing Plaintiff to suffer from severe
emotional distress. In the intervening years, Defendant has continually sought to
advantage herself at Plaintiff's expense. Defendant is now attempting to continue her
harm of Plaintiff by intentionally seeking to harass, embarrass, and interfere with the
employment of Plaintiff by serving an improper and excessive subpoena on Plaintiff's
employer.

Yesterday, Plaintiff Law Professor Robert Steinbuch received a phone call from
the administration of the University of Arkansas School of Law informing him that the
Law School had received from Defendant a subpoena seeking any and all documents in
any way relating to Plaintiff. Plaintiff's Counsel has not received a copy of this third-

party discovery from Defendant. FRCP 45(b)(1).'

 

' Plaintiff obtained a copy of Defendant's improperly served and overly broad and harassing third-

party discovery from the administration of the University of Arkansas School of Law; it claims that it was
Case OO ae Document 1 Filed oo Page 2 of 10

This overly broad discovery request is designed to embarrass and harass Plaintiff
and designed to pursue the improper purpose of interfering with Plaintiff's current
employment. Plaintiff has never claimed in this action that the damage that he suffered
as a result of Defendant's tortious actions prevented him from obtaining his current job.
Defendant's attempted discovery of Plaintiff's current employer is designed to harass, is
overbroad and is not designed to reasonably lead to discoverable or admissible evidence
in this case.

Defendant's subpoena of Plaintiff's current employer at the University of
Arkansas School of Law is a blatant attempt to harass, embarrass, and interfere with
Plaintiff's current employment as a Law Professor after the damages that Defendant
already inflicted. Plaintiff has consistently maintained that his reputation was damaged at
potential employers that did not hire him because of Defendant's actions. There is no
logical nexus between this case, which involves Defendant's tortious actions on Plaintiff
before he ever became a Law Professor, and Defendant's third-party discovery of
Plaintiff's employer. Plaintiff has never claimed that his reputation was hurt at his
current employment. Plaintiff has always maintained that the damage to his reputation
had an affect on the employers that did not hire him - not his employer that did hire him.

Defendant third-party subpoena on Plaintiff's current employer can only be
characterized an unmitigated fishing expedition, because Defendant seeks:

1. The complete application, personnel, complaint and/or other files or

compilations of documents, including but not limited to all performance

appraisals, credentials, commendations, reprimands, warning letters,
correspondence relating to work schedules, application for employment, and all

other documents contained therein which relate to Robert E. Steinbuch. This
specifically includes all records pertaining to correspondence, including letters of

 

served on Plaintiff's Counsel. Plaintiff's Counsel left messages for opposing counsel who has not returned
them.
Case *06-me-000x00B0 gay aN Document 1 Filed "oe Page 3 of 10

reference, relating to Steinbuch's efforts to seek employment with your
organization. This also includes all allegations or complaints, whether formal or
informal, or inappropriate conduct by or involving Steinbuch during his
employment with you and all investigation documents including but not limited to
interview notes, e-mails, papers, tapes and all other documentation pertaining to
the allegations against him, the investigation results and any disciplinary action
taken against him related thereto.
2. Each and every email, in electronic form, sent to or from (including ce's and or
bcc's) any email account assigned by you to Robert E. Steinbuch, including but
not limited to [his work] email address.
Defendants subpoena of Plaintiff's employer, the University of Arkansas School of Law.
Defendant seeks Plaintiff's complete personnel file. Of what relevance can
Plaintiff's "complete application, personnel, complaint and/or other files or compilations
of documents, including but not limited to all performance appraisals, credentials,
commendations, reprimands, warning letters, correspondence relating to work schedules,
application for employment, and all other documents contained therein which relate to
Robert E. Steinbuch" be to Defendant's invasion of privacy and related claims that
occurred during his previous employment? Plaintiff's employment files include, inter
alia, personal information, tax identification information, and immigration status
documents. None of this is relevant or likely to lead to admissible evidence. Indeed, all
of the identifying information is highly secure information ripe for abuse. Equally,
Plaintiff's current teaching appraisals have nothing to do with the harm that Defendant
did to Plaintiff when he worked in his prior, non-teaching job. Similarly, there is no
reasonable basis to seek Plaintiff's credentials, commendations, reprimands, warning
letters, and work schedules. This discovery is excessive and unwarranted. Defendant has

not only made no attempt to reasonably limit her discovery in any reasonable way, she

has intentionally done exactly the opposite. Moreover, rather than serving tailored
Case "oreo Document 1 Filed "eo Page 4 of 10

requests on Plaintiff, Defendant is intentionally trying to interfere with Plaintiff's current
employment by serving an overbroad subpoena on Plaintiff's employer. Such actions are
improper. See Trammell v. Anderson College, 2006 WL 1997425 at *1 (D.S.C. 2006)
("the items sought by the defendants should have been requested under the provisions of
Rule 34 [discovery of the party] and not by subpoena under Rule 45").

Second, Defendant secks "all allegations or complaints, whether formal or
informal, or inappropriate conduct by or involving Steinbuch during his employment with
you and all investigation documents including but not limited to interview notes, e-mails,
papers, tapes and all other documentation pertaining to the allegations against him, the
investigation results and any disciplinary action taken against him related thereto." This
is obviously an attempt to dig up mud on Plaintiff. Again, allegations and complaints of
wrongdoing in Plaintiff's current position, obtained after Defendant's wrongdoing, would
not bear on this case whatsoever. Plaintiff obtained employment with his current
employer after Defendant's tortious actions. Plaintiff obviously never claimed
Defendant's actions prevented him from getting employment in his current position.
Defendant's action interfered with Plaintiff's ability to get other jobs. Defendant should
seek discovery from those potential employers that did not hire him as a consequence of
Defendant's actions, not Plaintiff's employer that did hire him.

Finally, Defendant seeks all of Plaintiff's email, which contains sensitive
information about, inter alia, the Law School, exams, students, grading, hiring, student
discipline, academic performance, and peer review. Defendant makes no limitations or
restrictions in her request whatsoever. This is truly excessive. This is the archetype of

improper, overly broad and harassing discovery designed to interfere with and affect
Case 4:06-mc-000228,WRW Document 1 Filed "eo Page 5 of 10

Plaintiff's current employment. Defendant could have served Plaintiff with tailored
document requests, which could include information in Plaintiff's email. Instead,
Defendant seeks to bypass normal discovery and discovery time frames and to obstruct
Plaintiff's current employment.

This Court should quash Defendant's improper discovery and require Defendant

to seek tailored discovery from Plaintiff rather than interfering with his employment.
