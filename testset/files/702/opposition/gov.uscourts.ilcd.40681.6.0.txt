m EN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
COMES NOW, G q D. Bowers, Plaintiffpro se who opposes the

Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, for the reasons indicated hereinafter.

The United States District Court has the authority to compel employees
of
the fas to comply with the law and implementing regulations.
The gravamen of this case is simple: Does the United States District
Court have jurisdiction to compel employees of the IRS to comply with the
law and regulations implementing same? Plaintiff Gary D. Bowers
(hereinafter "Bowers") sought relief that is mandamus in natue, and
nothing more. As such, the determination was null a b initio, due to the

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 6

Page 2 of 9

absence of due process with respect to the hearing.
All Bowers asks of this court, is that it compel Defendant Curtis M.
Megyesi ("Megyesi") to do his job: give Bowers his face-to-face CDP
hearing, as the law and implementing regulations require. This is Megyesi's
duty under the law.
Mandamus jurisdiction arises from Title 28 U.S.C. @ 1361, which
states:

" n e district courts shall have original jurisdiction of an action
in the nature of mandamus to compel an oficer or employee of
the United States or any agency thereof topet$iom a duty owed
to the plaint&"

In BZuney v. United States, 34 F.3d 509,5 13, the

Circuit stated:

"[Plaintzm correctlypoints out mandamusjurisdiction can be
invoked only when the plaintlflhas a clear right to the relief
sought, the defendant has a clear duty toperform, and no other
adequate remedy is available."
Three prong test for mandamus.

This controversy evolves around the three prongs of the mandamus
standard. Defendant falsely states that:
"First, the Plaintzflcannot establish a clear right to a face to
face Collection Due Process ("CDP ") hearing Indeed, the
regulationspromulgated by the IRS specifcally state thatface
toface hearings are not required.'"

Defendant then goes on to cite (the middle of page three of their

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 6

Page 3 of 9

motion) Treasury Regulation 9 30 1-6330- 1(d)92)9A-D6). However, this
regulation only states that the hearing procedures are informal in nature.
They do not state that the IRS may deny a tax payer a face-to-face hearing.
Examination of the regulation Plaintiff cites (26 C.F.R.

5 301.6330-1

(d)(2)) shows that a face-to-face meeting is required when requested by the

taxpayer.
26 CFR 9 30 1-6330-1(d)(2)) states, in ref evant part:
iQtD7. Ifa tartpayer wants aface-to-face CDP hearing, where
will it be held?
A-D7. The taxpayer must be offered an opportunityfor a
hewing rrt the Appeals ofice closest ta tnxpnyer's
residence or, in the case of a business taxpayer, the
taxpayer's principal place of business. [Emphasis added

Clearly, this provision shows that it is the tax payer, and not the
hearing officer, who decides whether to have a face-to-face hearing. Why
else would this regulation state that the taxpayer "must"be afforded a
hearing at a location convenient for the taxpayer? Therefore, we have
satisfied the first and second prong of the mandamus standard: the Plaintiff
has a clear right to the relief sought, and the hearing officer has a clear d u v
to act, i.e., grant a face-to-face meeting.

There is nothing in the law or the regulations made pursuant thereto
which authorize Megyesi to deny a face-to-face hearing, hence his denial

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 6

Page 4 of 9

being a departure ftam what the law requires. Therefore, Defendant's
complaint coiiapses like a house of cards.
It should aiso be noted that if the substance of a determination of a
CDP hearing were to be appealed in a court, a record of such proceedings
would facilitate the appeal process, and it is only in a face-to-face hearing
that a record of the proceedings can take place. See Tide 26 U.S.C. ยง 7521.
Denial of the face-to-face hearing thwarts due process.
We are now left with the third prong: is there mother adequate
remedy of law for the plaintiff to seek the relief he is trying to compel?
There is no adequate remedy at law for the relief requested.

The United States Constitution, at Article 111 Sec. 2 states,
"Thejudicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and
Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United
States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
Autbrity....
"

If any remedy existed shon of mandamus, then this remedy would be
found in Title 26 U.S.C.

5 6330(d), but this is not the case. This subsection

states in relevant part:

(4 Proceeding afer Jlearing
( I ) Judicial review of determination
The person may, within 30 days of a determination under this
section, upped such detmminatiom(A) to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall havejurisdiction
with respect to such matter); or
(23) ifthe Tax Court does not havejurisdiction ofthe

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 6

Page 5 of 9

underlying tax liabidity, to a district court ofthe United
states.

This implied claim that a post-deprivation remedy satisfies the due

process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution
ignores Congress' intent to insert another pre-deprivation remedy, to which
Bowers has a clear right.
One need consider the total package. Congress (and the Secretary of
the Treasury, in the regulations) established a package consisting of a faceto-face hearing resulting in a determination based on that hearing, and an
opportunity to appeal that determination to the courts.
When Bowers was deprived of his face-to-face hearing, he was
deprived of the whole package. The determination is not about whether a
face-to-face hearing should be granted-the

law and the regulations

implementing same, say it must; rather, it is about whether levy action
should be allowed to proceed. Therefore, there is no remedy here under the
provisions of 5 6330.

Tax Court has no authority to adjudicate this controversy

Tax court has no authority to issue extraordinary writs, such as a Writ

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 6

of Mandamus. Insofar as a Constitutional question arises in this
controversy--denid of due process-Tax

Court is not vested with the

authority to hear the case. In-Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868,870

(1991) the United States Supreme Court stated:
"The Board of Tax Appeals is not a court. It is an executive
or administrative board upon the decision of which the parties
are given an opportunity to base apetitionfor review to the
courts after the administrative inquiry of the Board has been
had and decided. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 2 79
U S. 716, 725, 49 X Ct. 499, 502, 73 L.Ed. 918 (1929) (Tafi,
C.J.)
The Court in Freytag gives us more insight as to the actud nature and
fimctions of the Tax Court. The Court went on to say:
"fiough renamed the Tax Court of the United States in
1942, it remained an independent agency in the Executive
Branch, 26 U.S.C. J 1100 (1952 ed.), and continued ta
perfom the sarnef;rnction. As an aecutive agency, it
possessed many of the accoutrements the Court considers
quintessentiallyjudicial, ante at 2645. It administered oaths,
for acampIe) ~ n subpoenaed
d
and examined witnesses, j 1114;
itsfinctions were reviewed in the same manner and to the
same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions
tried without ajury, $1 141(a); Zhis Court continued to treat it
as an administrative agency, akin to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) or the National Labur
Relations Board (NLRB). See Dobson v. Commissioner, 320
US. 489, 495-501, 64 X Ct. 239,243-247, 88 L.Ed. 248 (1943).
When the Tctx Court was statutorily denominated an
Article I Court in 1969, itsjudges did not magically acquire the
judicial power. They still lack life tenure; their salaries may
still be diminished; thegr are still removable by the presi&ntJbr
ineflciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in ofice, 26 U.S. C.
# 7443(%7.(m Bowshar v. Svnar, supra, 478 US.,at 729,106

Thus, the issue of Bowers' right is not properly brought before the

Tax Court, resulting in the absence of a remedy in Tax Court.
Unpublished court cases cited as authority.
Defendant also cites a plethora of unpublished court cases baldly
claiming that courts uphold denial of a tax payer's right to a face-to-face
hearing. Though we c m o t discern the ration& of those court decisions
(Defendant never discussed them), if such decisions really exist, we need
not consider them anyway. A local rule of this court, Federd Rule of
Appellate Procedure 32.I , states in relevant part:
RULE 32.1. Citing Judicial Dispositions
(a) Citation Permitted. A court may not prohibit or
restrict the citation of federal judicial opinions, orders,
judgments, or dher written dispositions that have been:
(i) designated as "unpublished," "not for publication,"
"non-precedentid," "not precedent," or the Iike; and
(ii) issued on or aRer January I, 2007.

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 6

(b) Copies Required. If a party cites a federal judicial
opinion, order, judgment, or other written disposition that is not
available in a publicly accessible electronic database, the party
must file and serve a copy of that opinion,order,judgment,or
disposition with the brief or other paper in which it is cited.

Moreover, no copies of said decisions have been provided to Plaintiff, a pro
se litigant. Bowers has no access to Westiaw or similar resources attorneys
pay for. As such, this court should disregard such "authority."

WHEREFORE,Plaintiff prays this court to DENY Defendant's
Motion to Dismiss.
