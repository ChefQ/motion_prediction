BRIEF IN OPPOSITION T O DEFENDAW'S MOTION T O DISMISS
AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT

COMES NOW, Gary D. Bowers, Plaintiff pro se who opposes the
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, for the reasons indicated henindker.

The Ultited Ststes District Cot@ has the authority to compel emphyees
of
the IRS to comply with the law and implementing regulations.

The gravamen of this case is simple: Does the United States District
Court have jurisdiction to compel employees of the IRS to comply with the

law and regulations impiementing same7 Haintiff Gary D. Bowers

(hereinafter "Bowers") sought relief that is mandamus in nature, and
nothing more. As such, the determination was null ab initio, due to the
absence of due process with respect to the hearing.
All Bowers asks of this court, is that it compel Defendant Curtis M.
Megyesi ("Megyesi") to do his job: give Bowers his face-to-face CDP 1
hearing, as the law and implementing regulations require. This is Megyesi's
duty under the law.
Mandamus jurisdiction arises from Title 28 U.S.C. 8 1361, which
states:

"The district courts shall have originaljurisdiction of an action
in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of
the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed
to the plaint*"
In Blaney v. United States, 34 F.3d 509, 5 13, the 7" Circuit stated:

"[Plaintffl correctly points out mandamus jurisdiction can be
invoked only when the plaintg has a clear right to the relief
sought, the defendant has a clear duty to perform, and no other
adequate remedy is available."
Three prong test for mandamus.

This controversy evolves around the three prongs of the mandamus
standard. Defendant falsely states that:

"First, the Plaintgcannot establish a clear right to a face to
face Collection Due Process ("CDP'Y hearing, Indeed, the

Page 2 of 9

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 7

Page 3 of 9

regulations promulgated by the IRS speczj?cally state that face
toface hearings are not required."
Defendant then goes on to cite (the middle of page three of their
motion) Treasury Regulation § 30 1.6330- 1(d)92)9A-D6). However, this
regulation only states that the hearing procedures are informal in nature.
They do not state that the IRS may deny a tax payer a face-to-face hearing.
Examination of the regulation Plaintirf cites (26 C.F.R. § 301.6330l(d)(2)) shows that a face-to-face meeting is required when requested by the
taxpayer.
26 CFR § 30 1.6330- 1(d)(2)) states, in relevant part:
Q-07. I f a taxpayer wants a face-to-face CDP hearing, where
will it be held?
A-D7. The taxpayer must be offered an opportunity for a
hearing at the Appeals office closest to taxpayer's
residence or, in the case of a business taxpayer, the
taxpayer's princkal place of business. [Emphasis added]
Clearly, this provision shows that it is the tax payer, and not the
hearing officer, who decides whether to have a face-to-face hearing. Why
else would this regulation state that the taxpayer "must9' be afforded a
hearing at a location convenient for the taxpayer? Therefore, we have
satisfied the first and second prong of the mandamus standard: the Plaintiff
has a clear right to the relief sought, and the hearing officer has a clear duty
to act, i.e., grant a face-to-face meeting.

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 7

Page 4 of 9

There is nothing in the law or the regulations made pursuant thereto
which authorize Megyesi to deny a face-to-face hearing, hence his denial
being a departure from what the law requires. Therefore, Defendant's
complaint collapses like a house of cards.
It should also be noted that if the substance of a determination of a

I

CDP hearing were to be appealed in a court, a record of such proceedings
would facilitate the appeal process, and it is only in a face-to-face hearing
that a record of the proceedings can take place. See Title 26 U.S.C.

9 7521.

Denial of the face-to-face hearing thwarts due process.
We are now left with the third prong: is there another adequate remedy
of law for the plaintiff to seek the relief he is trying to compel?

There is no adequate remedy at law for the relief requested.
The United States Constitution, at Article I11 Sec. 2 states,
I

"The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and
Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United
States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
Authority....
11

If any remedy existed short of mandamus, then this remedy would be
found in Title 26 U.S.C.

6330(d), but this is not the case. This subsection

states in relevant part:
(d) Proceeding after hearing
( I ) Judicial review of determination
Page 4 of 9

1:07-cv-01028-MMM-BGC # 7

Page 5 of 9

The person may, within 30 days of a determination under this
section, appeal such determination(A) to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction
with respect to such matter); or
(B) i f the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction of the
underlying tax liability, to a district court of the United
States.
This implied claim that a post-deprivation remedy satisfies the due
process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution
ignores Congress' intent to insert another pre-deprivation remedy, to which
Bowers has a clear right.
One need consider the total package. Congress (and the Secretary of
the Treasury, in the regulations) established a package consisting of a faceto-face hearing resulting in a determination based on that hearing, and an
opportunity to appeal that determination to the courts.
When Bowers was deprived of his face-to-face hearing, he was
deprived of the whole package. The determination is not about whether a
face-to-face hearing should be granted-the

law and the regulations

implementing same, say it must; rather, it is about whether levy action
should be allowed to proceed. Therefore, there is no remedy here under the
provisions of 8 6330.

Insofar as a Constitutional question arises in this
of due process-Tax

Court is not vested with the

authority to hear the case. In-Freytag v. Commissioner, 50 1 U.S. 868, 870
1) the United States Supreme Court stated:

"The Board of Tax Appeals is not a court. It is an executive
or administrative board, upon the decision of which the parties
are given an opportunity to base a petition for review to the
courts after the administrative inquiry of the Board has been
had and decided. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279
U S . 716, 725, 49 S. Ct. 499, 502, 73 L.Ed. 918 (1929) (Taft,
C.J.)
The Court in Freytag gives us more insight as to the actual nature and
functions of the Tax Court. The Court went on to say:
"Though renamed the Tax Court of the United States in
1942, it remained an independent agency in the Executive
Branch, 26 US.C. § 1100 (1952 ed.), and continued to
perform the same fimction. As alz executive agency, it
possessed many of the accoutrements the Court considers
quintessentially judicial, ante at 2645. It administered oaths,
for example, and subpoenaed and examined witnesses, § 1114;
its functions were reviewed in the same manner and to the
same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions
tried without a july, $1 141(a); This Court continued to treat it
as an administrative agency, akin to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) or the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB). See Dobson v. Commissioner, 320
U S . 489, 495-501, 64 S. Ct. 239, 243-247, 88 L.Ed. 248 (1943).

m e n the Tax Court was statutorily denominated an
Article I Court in 1969, its judges did not magically acquire the
judicial power. They still lack life tenure; their salaries may
still be diminished; they are still removable by the president for
inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, 26 U S .C.
j 7443m. (In Bowshar v. Synaq supra, 478 US., at 729, 106
S. Ct. At 3189, we held that these latter terms are very broad
and could sustain removal... for any number of actual or
perceived transgressions.) How anyone with these
characteristics can exercise judicial power independent ... [ofl
the Executive Branch is a complete mystery. It seems to me
entirely obvious that the Tax Court, Iike the Internal Revenue
Service, the FCC, and the NLRB, exercises executive power.

Thus, the issue of Bowers' right is not properly brought before the
Tax Court, resulting in the absence of a remedy in Tax Court.
Unpublished court cases cited as authority.

Defendant also cites a plethora of unpublished court cases baldly
claiming that courts uphold denial of a tax payer's right to a face-to-face
hearing. Though we cannot discern the rational of those court decisions
(Defendant never discussed them), if such decisions really exist, we need
not consider them anyway. A local rule of this court, Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 32.1, states in relevant part:

Page 8 of 9

RULE 32.1. Citing Judicial Dispositions
(a) Citation Permitted. A court may not prohibit or
restrict the citation of federal judicial opinions, orders,
judgments, or other written dispositions that have been:
(i) designated as "unpublished," "not for publication,"
"non-precedential," "not precedent," or the like; and
(ii) issued on or after January 1,2007.
(b) Copies Required. If a party cites a federal judicial
opinion, order, judgment, or other written disposition that is not
available in a publicly accessible electronic database, the party
must file and serve a copy of that opinion, order, judgment, or
disposition with the brief or other paper in which it is cited.

I

All the unreported cases cited by Defendant predate January 1, 2007.
Moreover, no copies of said decisions have been provided to Plaintiff, a pro
se litigant. Bowers has no access to Westlaw or similar resources attorneys
pay for. As such, this court should disregard such "authority."
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays this court to DENY Defendant's
Motion to Dismiss.
