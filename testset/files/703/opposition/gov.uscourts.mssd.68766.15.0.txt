VS. CIVIL ACTION NO: 2:09CV99-KS-MTP
GOOGLE, INC, AND
AOL
DEFENDANTS
PLAINTIFF RESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS FROM BOTH
DEFENDANATS
COMES NOW, Johnny | Henry, and files this his response to the Defendants

Motion to Dismiss and states the following;

Planitff did not file this Law suit to intimidate AOL, or. GOOLGE. He certainly did
not file it to loose his contract with Karlotta Pruitt and Tanya Dorsey Exhibit 1.

Mr. Henry was at the time of this Lawsuit under distress from what has to be
Viewed as nothing but outright racism. To Mr. Henry this was not just some
comments about his invention, these were words and pictures that degraded an
entire race of people.

Mr. Henry sued AOL and Google in an attempt to get to the individuals that
was posting this garbage on the web. To his surprise, AOL and Google removed
all 1.5 Million hits about his invention causing Mr. Henry to loose his contract
With Karlotia Pruitt and Tanya Dorsey. As outlined in the letter from Ms. Pruitt,
"Now those articles are gone and the only thing that comes up under your name

is a law suit against Google........... Henry vs. Google and AOL. What Mr.
Henry

Dockets.Justia.com
find hard to believe is that Google and Aol would remove the over 1.5 million hits
on his invention after this lawsuit was filed.

Mr. Henry was acting on emotions. What were AOL and Google both acting
on?

Servers have been sued by citizens on many occasions because of third party
postings only to fine that these servers are protected under the Communications
Decency Act. Mr. Henry has lost the opportunity to market his product because
he felt that AOL and Google should prevent this type of behavior. Mr. Henry is
not and will never be the only citizens that will sue to stop this type of behavior.

IN CONCLUSION, Mr. Henry respectfully requests this Honorable Court
enter an order dismissing plaintiff's complaint against the defendants in its
entirety without prejudice and ask that AOL and Google understand how hurt Mr.
Henry is about this degrading content. Mr. Henry request that AOL and Google
reinstate his 1.5 Million hits about his invention and give him the opportunity to
move his product. If AOL and Google know that they cannot stop this type of
behavior, they should not intentional harm a person who is attempting to stop this
type of behavior. Mr. Henry request that AOL and Google allow the product to be
re-instated on the web. "Why hurt Mr. Henry even more." Mr. Henry hopes that
AOL and Google will post this to the paperwork that has already been placed on
the web under his name. United States Citizens should know just how emotional
"Racism" really is.

RESPECTFULLY SBUMITTED, this Hoh day of August, 2009
