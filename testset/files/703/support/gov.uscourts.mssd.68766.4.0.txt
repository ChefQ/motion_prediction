CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:09CV-00099-KS-MTP

GOOGLE, INC. AND AOL

DEFENDANTS

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
COMES NOW Defendant, AOL LLC (“AOL”), and pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), (4), (5), (6)
and 10(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, moves this Court for a dismissal with prejudice
of all claims against it in this action and in support thereof states as follows:
1.

Plaintiff filed his Complaint on May 20, 2009, a copy of which is attached hereto as

Exhibit “A.”
2.

In his Complaint, Plaintiff claims that AOL is legally responsible, as the provider of

an internet search engine, for purportedly defamatory statements or content that exists on third party
internet websites. Plaintiff alleges that the internet sites at issue contain “defamatory, slanderous
and libelous statements” concerning him.
3.

Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted because all

of the Plaintiff’s claims against AOL are barred by the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C §
230 (“CDA”). Section 230 of the CDA prohibits lawsuits that seek to treat an interactive computer
service provider as the “publisher or speaker” of any information provided by another information
content provider or in this case by the third party internet sites referenced by the Plaintiff in his
Complaint. See 47 U.S.C. § 230 (c)(1).
4.

AOL has been held to be a an “interactive computer service” as defined by Section

230 and therefore entitled to its protections including immunity from lawsuits such as that filed by

Dockets.Justia.com

the Plaintiff seeking to hold AOL liable for content provided by third party internet sites. See e.g.
Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997) cert denied, 524 U.S. 937 (1998);
Green v. America Online, 318 F.3d 465, 471 (3d Cir. 2003); Ben Ezra, Weinstein & Co. v. America
Online, Inc., 206 F.3d 980, 986 (10th Cir. 2000); Noah v. AOL Time Warner Inc., 261 F. Supp.2d
532, 537 (E.D. Va. 2003).
5.

Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because

Plaintiff has failed to state his claim in numbered paragraphs as required by Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 10(b). The Complaint should therefore be dismissed.
6.

In the alternative, Plaintiff ’s Complaint is defective and should be dismissed

because this Court lacks jurisdiction. Plaintiff has attempted to invoke this Court’s diversity
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 but has failed to plead the required jurisdictional amount
in controversy. Because there is no basis for the Court to exercise its diversity jurisdiction the
Complaint should be dismissed.
7.

In addition, process and service of process are insufficient. Plaintiff erroneously

identified Defendant as “A.O.L.” in his Complaint instead of Defendant’s proper name, AOL LLC
Defendant is also misnamed in the summons issued by the Plaintiff. Accordingly, process and
service of process are insufficient and the Complaint should be dismissed.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant respectfully requests that this
Honorable Court dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint against Defendant AOL LLC with prejudice.
Respectfully Submitted,
