FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM
Plaintiff BancPass, Inc. (“BancPass” or “Plaintiff”) files this response to
Defendant Highway Toll Administration’s (“HTA” or “Defendant”) Motion to Dismiss, and
in support thereof would show the Court the following:
I.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

This case is about a dominant market player taking repeated wrongful actions
designed to put a smaller competitor out of business.

It is also about consumers’

choice. When a customer rents a car, he may elect to fill the gas tank back up at the
local gas station for $2.49 a gallon, or he can choose the convenience of letting the
rental car company refuel the car at $9.89 per gallon. But, at least according to HTA,
when it comes to toll-road charges, that same rental car consumer has no such right.
Rental car companies typically charge customers $4 per day plus the actual costs of
tolls incurred for the option to have HTA and the rental car company pay the tolls
consumers incur while driving a rental car, though the actual cost of enabling such toll
payments is closer to 20 cents per toll.
BancPass offers an alternative: an easily accessible technology, that allows
customers to simply download an app called “PToll™” (“PToll™”) on their smartphones,

photograph their rental car license plate, activate the plate with BancPass, and pay only
the actual tolls, plus a 20 cents per transaction service charge.

Thus, BancPass

represents the ability to “buy gas elsewhere,” and this much less costly threat explains
precisely why HTA (and the rental car companies) are determined to put BancPass out
of business and why they so wish to terminate this litigation quickly.
Apparently not content with its 80% market share and seemingly intent on
preventing any competition from the BancPass app, HTA has made a multi-front assault
on BancPass. Since BancPass’s product is a smartphone app, it contracts with Google
and Apple to offer the PToll™ app through the Google Play and iTunes stores. To cut
BancPass off at its source, HTA made demands to both Google and Apple that they
remove PToll™ from their app stores. In order to provide toll processing services to
consumers, BancPass also needs to contract with tolling authorities, such as the Texas
Department of Transportation (“TXDOT”), or Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority
(“CTRMA”). So, HTA’s next assault on BancPass has been to contact tolling authorities
seeking to prevent them from doing business with BancPass and threatening legal
action against the tolling authorities if they don’t comply. Finally, HTA made a direct
assault, threatening legal action against BancPass unless BancPass makes an
agreement to cede the rental car portion of the toll processing market to HTA.
Despite HTA’s repeated attempts to characterize the filing of this case as merely
an effort to “create publicity” or “gain attention,” in truth, this lawsuit was filed in
response to HTA’s repeated interference with BancPass’s contractual relationships, and
in an effort to establish BancPass’s right to compete. BancPass has asserted three
causes of action: (1) tortious interference with existing contracts and prospective

business relations with Apple, Google, and tolling authorities; (2) for declaratory relief
that rental car consumers have the right to choose PToll™ as an alternative to HTA’s
service; and (3) for declaratory relief that if BancPass were to agree to HTA’s demand
to cede the rental car toll processing market to it, such an agreement would be a per se
violation of section one of the Sherman Act. The petition pleads facts plausibly stating
each of these claims, and Defendant’s motion should, therefore, be denied.
II.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS FROM PLAINTIFF’S PETITION

Plaintiff BancPass is an innovator in providing toll road users access to electronic
payment technologies.

BancPass provides toll-paying solutions for both tolling

authorities and directly to consumers. In April 2014, BancPass rolled out “PToll™,”
BancPass’s smartphone application. PToll™ provides toll road users with a simple and
convenient method to pay tolls using the camera on their smart phones. See Plaintiff’s
Original Petition, ¶ 10.
A consumer can download the PToll™ application on his smartphone, take a
photo of the license plate of the car he is driving, assign a method of payment, and drive
on participating toll roads as though he had a “tag” or “pass” issued by the local tolling
authority. This system provides a quick and seamless method for a user to pay tolls, no
matter what car they are driving, and no matter where they are from. While PToll™ is
well suited for use by rental car consumers, drivers can use PToll™ with their own
vehicles as well. See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 11.
PToll™ is available on Apple iTunes® and Google Play®, and can be downloaded
for free. PToll™ users are charged a $.20 to $.25 per transaction fee for using the
system, which amounts to a fraction of BancPass’s competitors’ charges. See Plaintiff’s
Original Petition, ¶ 12.

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 6 of 24

Defendant HTA contracts with rental car companies to provide toll processing
services for rental cars. HTA claims to be the largest provider of toll services for the
rental car industry. On its website, HTA declares it handles the “tolling interests of more
than 1.7 million vehicles” on behalf of major rental car companies, including Alamo,
Avis, Budget, Enterprise, National and Payless. HTA’s website further proclaims that it
“is proud to say we have more than 80% of the market share by transaction volume.”
See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 13.
HTA provides toll processing services to rental car companies in two ways. The
first is through radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) toll tags that are charged to HTA’s
account when a rental car driver uses the tag to pay a toll. The second method is by
HTA registering rental car license plate numbers with toll agencies. When a registered
rental car is driven through a toll lane, the license plate is captured and the toll is
charged to HTA’s account. HTA, in turn, bills the rental car company, who then charges
the consumer. See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 14.
Participating rental car companies charge consumers a per-day rental fee for
using HTA’s services—typically about $4.00 per day, plus the amount of any tolls
incurred. The daily rental rate applies whether any actual tolls are incurred or not.
Thus, consumers can pay $5.00 for a single $1.00 toll, if they rent a car for one day. If
the car is rented for two days, that $1.00 toll can cost $9.00. HTA and rental companies
also profit by charging consumers tolls at non-discounted rates, even though HTA is
paying only the discounted subscriber toll. This upcharge can be as much as 20-30%
higher than the toll HTA actually paid to the tolling authority as a subscriber. By burning

the consumer from both ends, HTA has enjoyed fat margins and has not, before now,
been challenged in the free market. See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 15.
BancPass, via PToll™, has designed a better alternative for the consumer.
When a consumer rents a vehicle, the consumer can simply “decline” the optional toll
package provided by HTA and take a picture of the rental car’s license plate with his/her
smartphone.

Through the PToll™ application, the consumer will then upload this

information to BancPass to tell the system that the consumer is driving this vehicle now
and for how long, and to bill his/her BancPass account for tolls charged to that license
plate. The consumer will only pay for what is needed, and avoids the daily fees that
HTA, through the rental car company, would have otherwise charged. See Plaintiff’s
Original Petition, ¶ 16
Rental car consumers finally have a choice in how they pay tolls: use BancPass
or use HTA. See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 17.
In an effort to bully and intimidate BancPass, an attorney representing HTA sent
BancPass a letter, dated September 30, 02014, threatening to take various steps to
block BancPass from freely competing in the rental car tolling market, and admitting that
HTA has already taken certain anti-competitive actions to prevent BancPass from
competing.1 See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 18. The September 30th letter stated in
relevant part:
By enabling and encouraging users to register rental cars
through the PToll app, you are intentionally interfering with
the contract between the users and their rental car agencies
and creating a litany of potential billing problems. For this
1

A true and correct copy of the September 30, 2014 letter was attached to Plaintiff’s
original petition and may, therefore, be considered by this Court in ruling on the current
motion. Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir. 2000).

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 8 of 24

reason, HTA demands that you immediately stop promoting
use of the PToll App by rental car drivers and add
disclosures to the App prohibiting such use.
….
As someone who is also engaged in efforts to simplify
management of tolls across various State platforms, we
would expect you to understand and respect this process.
Instead, you are intentionally interfering with the contracts
between the Rental Agencies and rental car drivers by
encouraging rental car drivers to pay for tolls through PToll
instead. This intentional interference is recognized as
unlawful tortious conduct in all fifty (50) states…
….
In order to avoid this administrative nightmare, HTA has no
choice but to aggressively pursue a bar to the PToll App. As
you are likely already aware, HTA has sent requests to the
App Store and Google Play requesting removal of the PToll
App. If needed, HTA will meet with each State Authority to
convince them that prioritizing PToll users over fleet
registrants is both unlawful and costly. HTA will also take
action in court to enforce its rights, including by seeking
injunctive relief.
There is a possibility, however, that this legal battle will not
be necessary, and that a co-existence agreement can be
reached. As we understand it, the primary purpose of the
PToll App is to permit drivers to manage payment of tolls
electronically without the need for a transponder or account
with a particular State Authority. This purpose does not rely
on rental car drivers to succeed. Accordingly, HTA proposes
that BancPass agree not to encourage or permit users of the
PToll App to register vehicles that are part of any Rental
Agency fleet. Thus, BancPass would need to:
(1) Immediately cease and desist advertising for the PToll
App directed at rental car drivers, including advertising in
airports, travel magazines, and other publications and
venues directed toward rental car drivers;
(2) Immediately remove the provision in the “FAQs” section
of the PToll App promising future functionality with respect to
rental vehicles;
(3) Add a provision to the Terms of Use for the PToll App
prohibiting registration of rental vehicles, to be approved by
HTA; and

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 9 of 24

(4) Add a disclosure, to be displayed clearly and
conspicuously in the footer of all screens of the PToll App,
prohibiting registration of rental vehicles, to be approved by
HTA.
By taking these actions, BancPass would avoid litigation by
HTA, would bring the PToll App into compliance with the law,
and would drastically reduce the potential for billing
problems with its own customers. We believe this proposal
is fair and in the best interest of all involved. However, if
BancPass is unwilling to consider it, or does not respond to
HTA, HTA will have no choice but to move forward as
described above.
See Ex. A to Plaintiff’s Original Petition. In addition, BancPass has learned that HTA
has actually sent a letter to the Texas Department of Transportation complaining of
TXDOT’s processing of tolls for BancPass customers, and threatening “to take any and
all legal actions necessary to protect our rights.” See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 20.
HTA’s initial attempts to shut down BancPass were, unfortunately, at least
partially successful. On October 6, 2014, at 6:41 p.m., BancPass received an email
from Google Play® informing it that PToll™ had been removed from the Google Play®
store.

After it was informed of the baselessness of HTA’s accusations, Google

reinstated the PToll™ app the next day. See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 22.
BancPass’s technology is not only available for consumers; it is also available as
a toll collection solution for tolling authorities. HTA’s threats to contact, and its actual
contact with, various tolling authorities in attempt to block BancPass from being able to
provide toll processing services could further damage BancPass’s business, since
BancPass must contract with tolling authorities in order to be able to process tolls for
consumers. See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 23.

III.

ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES

In its petition, BancPass alleges claims for tortious interference and tortious
interference with prospective business relations, and requests declaratory relief. The
petition provides Defendant with fair notice of these claims, and Defendant’s motion to
dismiss should be denied.
A.

Rule 12(b)(6) Standard

Motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim are generally viewed with disfavor.
See, e.g., Collings v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498 (5th Cir. 2000).
In ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a trial court is to accept all well-pleaded
facts as true and view those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Hale v.
King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011) (“Under the 12(b)(6) standard, all well-pleaded facts
are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”).

The complaint should be

construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, its allegations taken as true, and all
reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the pleading should be drawn in favor of
the pleader. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93-94 (2007). “All federal courts are in
agreement that the burden is on the moving party to prove that no legally cognizable
claim for relief exists.” 5B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER

ET AL.,

FEDERAL

PRACTICE & PROCEDURE §1357 (3d ed. 2014).
To pass muster under Rule 12(b)(6) “[a] complaint need not contain ‘detailed
factual allegations’ but must include sufficient facts to indicate the plausibility of the
claims asserted raising the ‘right to relief above the speculative level.”

Steward v.

International Ass’n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 16 F.Supp.3d 783, 791
(S.D. Tex. 2014). In light of this liberal pleading standard motions to dismiss under Rule
12(b)(6) are rarely granted. 5B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER

ET AL.,

PAGE 8
BPI10.0001 4817-7813-0464

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 11 of 24

FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE §1357 (3d ed. 2014).

Indeed, Wright and Miller

suggest that:
As a practical matter, a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is
likely to be granted by the district court only in the relatively
unusual case in which the plaintiff includes allegations that
show on the face of the complaint that there is some
insuperable bar to securing relief. In other words, dismissal
is justified only when the allegations of the complaint itself
clearly demonstrate that whatever interpretation is given to
the facts the plaintiff does not have a claim that is legally
redressible; in a real sense, the plaintiff has pleaded himself
out of federal court.
Id. Even where a District Court determines a complaint falls short, courts typically will
give the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. Hildebrand v. Honeywell, Inc., 622
F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1980) (holding, leave to amend should have been granted, and case
should not have been dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6)).
B.

Plaintiff has stated a claim for declaratory relief

Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, a party may request declaratory relief
in a case of actual controversy, in which the Court may declare the rights and other
legal relations of any interested party seeking such a declaration, whether or not further
relief could be sought. 28 U.S.C. §2201(a). “Fifth Circuit law provides three factors for
district courts to consider in determining whether to adjudicate a declaratory judgment
action: (1) whether the action is justiciable; (2) whether the court has authority to grant
relief; and (3) whether the court should exercise its discretion to decide the action based
on the factors stated in St. Paul Ins. Co v. Trejo.” Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v.
Fitch, 643 F.Supp.2d 902, 907 (S.D. Tex. 2009). An action is justiciable when there is
an active controversy, not just a hypothetical, or conjectural controversy.

Id.

As

demonstrated below, that is true in this case. The court has authority to grant relief

PAGE 9
BPI10.0001 4817-7813-0464

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 12 of 24

where there is no concurrent state action. Id. No such action exists here. Moreover,
Defendant has not argued that any of the Trejo factors weigh in favor of dismissal, and
HTA has not even argued, let alone demonstrated, that early dismissal at this stage is
warranted on that basis. See Id at 907-08. Accordingly, BancPass has adequately
stated a claim for declaratory relief.
1.

Plaintiff seeks a declaration that HTA’s proposed agreement is a per
se violation of section one of the Sherman Act

HTA complains at length that BancPass has failed to adequately plead an antitrust claim. However, HTA’s argument misses the point that, as pled, BancPass’s
petition does not attempt to assert a cause of action for any antitrust violation(s).
Instead, the petition requests a declaration that if BancPass were to accept the market
allocation proposal demanded by HTA, the resulting agreement would be a per se
violation of the Sherman Act.2
A market allocation scheme exists where competitors agree to a division of a
market, whether the allocation be geographical, territorial, or by customers; such a
scheme is a per se violation of section one of the Sherman Act. See United States v.
Cadillac Overall Supply Co., 568 F.2d 1078,1090 (5th Cir. 1978) (“We hold that the
allocation of customers is a per se violation of Section One of the Sherman Act.”);
United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608 (1972) (“[o]ne of the classic
examples of a per se violation of Sec. 1 is an agreement between competitors at the
same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize
competition.”).
2

Although, BancPass has, at this point, made no Sherman Act claims, it reserves the
right to amend its pleadings to make such claims should discovery reveal evidence
supporting such a claim.

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 13 of 24

HTA has demanded that BancPass agree to limit its services to the non-rental
car portion of the toll processing market and cede the rental car portion of the market to
HTA:
There is a possibility, however, that this legal battle will not
be necessary, and that a co-existence agreement can be
reached. Accordingly, HTA proposes that BancPass agree
not to encourage or permit users of the PToll™ App to
register vehicles that are part of any Rental Agency fleet.
See Ex. A to Plaintiff’s Original Petition at p. 2 of 3. Thus, HTA has demanded that
BancPass enter into an agreement to divide the toll processing market between the
parties.
There is a live controversy between the parties, as HTA has threatened to
continue contacting tolling authorities to demand they exclude BancPass from their
tolling systems and to sue BancPass for tortious interference, unless BancPass agrees
to enter into HTA’s proposed market division agreement.

Specifically, Defendant’s

September 30th letter threatens to use all means necessary, up to and including
litigation unless BancPass agrees to remove itself as a tolling solution for rental cars
and cede that portion of the toll processing market to HTA:
By taking these actions, BancPass would avoid litigation by
HTA, [and] would bring the PToll™ app into compliance with
the law. …However, if BancPass is unwilling to consider it,
or does not respond to HTA, HTA will have no choice but to
move forward as described above.
See Ex. A to Plaintiff’s Original Petition at p. 3 of 3. HTA’s motion completely ignores
the letter it sent BancPass, despite the fact that it was attached to Plaintiff’s Original
Petition that HTA now seeks to have dismissed.

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 14 of 24

BancPass’s petition states a claim for a declaration that if it agrees to such a
division of the tolling market, it would constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. 3
Despite HTA’s attempts to setup a straw-man claim for an indeterminate antitrust
violation, or a section 2 monopolization claim, BancPass asserts no such causes of
action.

Accordingly, Defendant’s arguments are without merit, and the motion to

dismiss this declaratory judgment claim should be denied.
2.

BancPass has standing to seek a declaratory judgment regarding a
potential antitrust violation

BancPass has standing to bring the request for a declaration that entering into
HTA’s proposed agreement would be a per se violation of the Sherman Act. BancPass
is directly an “interested party” in the dispute. 28 U.S.C. §2201. Indeed, it is the legal
effect of BancPass’s own conduct that is at issue in this claim, as BancPass is
attempting to prevent harm to itself by obtaining a determination that agreeing to HTA’s
demand could result in future Sherman Act liability.

It is well established that

declaratory relief is available to a party seeking a judicial declaration on the legality of a
pending action. See 5B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER

ET AL.,

FEDERAL

PRACTICE & PROCEDURE §2751 (3d ed. 2014). (“[Declaratory action] relieves potential
defendants ‘from the Damoclean threat of impending litigation which a harassing
adversary might brandish, while initiating suit at his leisure—or never.’ It permits actual
controversies to be settled before they ripen into violations of law or a breach of
contractual duty and it helps avoid a multiplicity of actions by affording an adequate,
expedient, and inexpensive means for declaring in one action the rights and obligations
of litigants.”)
3

The same analysis applies for Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act. TEX. BUS. &
COM. CODE §15.01, et al.

PAGE 12

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 15 of 24

HTA still argues that there is not an actual, existing controversy between the
parties, despite the fact that it has threatened to continue to demand tolling authorities
cease doing business with BancPass and threatens to sue BancPass for tortious
interference if it does not cede the rental car portion of the toll processing market to
HTA, a threat it repeated in the introduction to its motion to dismiss. HTA has presented
BancPass with a Hobson’s choice. On the one hand, BancPass could agree to divide
the tolling market with HTA and potentially be susceptible to section 1 Sherman Act
claims, or, on the other hand, face continued fights at tolling authorities, and tort claims
by HTA. That is a genuine controversy, and one in which BancPass’s rights are directly
implicated.
HTA also argues that BancPass’s claim should be dismissed on the basis that
BancPass lacks standing because BancPass did not specifically allege a danger of
future harm. While this statement is an over simplification of the holdings in the cases
cited by Defendant, even if HTA’s formulation were correct, BancPass has amply
alleged the danger of future harm, both in the risks BancPass would face if it violates
section one of the Sherman Act, and for the potential loss of an entire class of
customers should BancPass remove itself from that portion of the toll processing
market.4 See Plaintiffs Original Petition, ¶ 38. BancPass is an interested party under
the declaratory judgment act, and the motion to dismiss should be denied.

4

For example, the standard articulated in the City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S.
95,102 (1983) case is actually for injunctive relief, while Johnson v. Moore, 958 F.2d 92,
94 (5th Cir. 1992) addresses conduct that already occurred and was moot because the
incident had already occurred and had only the speculative chance to reoccur. Neither
case applies here.

BancPass has standing to seek a declaratory judgment as to
customer’s freedom to lawfully choose BancPass’s service over
HTA’s

BancPass has requested that the Court grant declaratory relief that rental car
customers have the right to choose to use BancPass’s PToll™ app to pay tolls instead
of HTA’s service and that the continued marketing and operation of PToll™ to rental
car customers is lawful. BancPass also has standing to assert this claim.
There can be no question that there is a live dispute between BancPass and
HTA regarding this issue. HTA demonstrates this in its own motion:
Defendant [sic] is the one that actually has been interfering
with the contracts between rental car companies and their
customers and that Defendant [sic] also has been interfering
with HTA’s contracts with HTA’s customers. That is what
this case should actually be about.
See Defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss at 2. Defendant also demonstrated
the existence of a live dispute in its September 30th letter:
[Bancpass is] intentionally interfering with the contracts
between Rental Agencies and rental car drivers by
encouraging rental car drivers to pay for tolls through PToll™
instead. This intentional interference is recognized as
unlawful tortious conduct in all fifty (50) states.
See Ex. A to Plaintiff’s Original Petition at p. 2 of 3. HTA has repeatedly threatened to
sue BancPass on this issue. There is, thus, an actual controversy on this issue.
In addition, BancPass is an interested party and has standing to seek this
declaration. See 28 U.S.C. §2201 (“any court… may declare the rights and other legal
relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is
or could be sought.”)
Here, BancPass’s interests are directly implicated by HTA’s threats to sue and by
HTA’s claim that BancPass is legally prohibited from competing with HTA for the toll

processing business of rental car consumers. Of course BancPass is not a party to any
contract between rental car companies and/or HTA and rental car consumers; to the
contrary BancPass competes with those contracts. BancPass is not trying to enforce
those contracts, which might, as HTA contends, have required that BancPass be a party
(or third party beneficiary) to them. Instead, BancPass simply seeks declaratory relief
that it may compete with HTA and the rental car companies. Fortunately, the rental car
companies themselves agree that rental car consumers may choose to use BancPass’s
PToll™ instead of the service they and HTA offer. As pled in BancPass’s Original
Petition, the rental car companies represent to consumers that the toll processing
service is “optional,” and that consumers may decline HTA’s service. As this case
develops, BancPass expects to be able to provide evidence that rental car contracts
typically contain language to the effect that consumers may use other devices to pay
tolls.
BancPass’s ability to do business with rental car consumers is directly implicated
by the live dispute between the parties on this issue.

Accordingly, BancPass has

standing, and the motion to dismiss this declaratory judgment claim should be denied.
C.

BancPass has stated claims for tortious interference and tortious
interference with prospective relations

The elements of tortious interference with contract under Texas law are: (1) an
existing contract subject to interference; (2) a willful and intentional act of interference
with the contract; (3) that proximately caused the plaintiff’s injury; and (4) caused actual
damages or loss. Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Financial Review Services, Inc., 29
S.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex. 2000). Here, BancPass’s Original Petition amply pleads each of
these elements. BancPass has plead three distinct types of contracts with regard to its

PToll™ app: (1) between BancPass and Google, and BancPass and Apple for the
distribution of PToll™; (2) between BancPass and tolling agencies for integration and
use of the PToll™ app on the authorities’ toll roads; and (3) between BancPass and the
consumers who have downloaded and use the PToll™ app. See Plaintiff’s Original
Petition, ¶ 25.
As specifically laid out in the petition: “BancPass has contracts with both Google
Play store and Apple to distribute the PToll™ app.” See Plaintiff’s Original Petition,
¶ 25. As alleged in the Original Petition, HTA has admitted, in the September 30th letter,
that it has taken steps to intentionally interfere with those contracts:
HTA has sent requests to the App Store and Google Play
requesting removal of the PToll™ app. HTA has willfully and
intentionally interfered with the contracts between BancPass
and Google, and BancPass and Apple, by writing letters to
both Google and Apple demanding they remove the PToll™
app.
See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 26. It is not an implausible leap to conclude that
HTA’s admitted actions in demanding Google pull down PToll™, proximately resulted in
Google actually pulling down PToll™. Apple may still remove the PToll™ app from
iTunes.
After Google removed the PToll™ app from the Google Play Store, it was
unavailable for download by consumers, resulting in damages to BancPass, which in
essence, was unable to “sell” its product or service.5 Thus, the petition pleads the
existence of contracts, intentional and willful interference by HTA with those contracts,

5

Similarly, tolling authorities BancPass was soliciting to do business with would likewise
be unable to download the app during this time.

damages, in the form of lost sales and lost toll transactions, and that HTA’s actions
proximately caused those damages.
BancPass has also pled prospective relations with both additional tolling
authorities and new customers seeking to download and utilize the PToll™ app: “HTA’s
actions interfere with potential contracts with consumers and additional tolling
authorities.” See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 28. BancPass already has customers
successfully using the app, and as its solution becomes known by the general public
through legitimate advertising such as radio endorsements, ads placed in travel
magazines, and other marketing media, more toll road consumers download PToll™ on
their smartphones and other devices.

BancPass can show that its PToll™ app is

downloaded daily, which creates a reasonable probability that consumers were
attempting to download the PToll™ app when it was not available on Google. HTA cites
no authority for its contention that BancPass must specifically identify each potential
customer who searched for PToll™ and was unable to download it, and Texas authority
actually seems to establish the opposite. See Bradford v. Vento, 997 S.W.2d 713, 732
(Tex.App.- Corpus Christi 1999), rev’d in part on other grounds, 48 S.W.3d 749 (Tex.
2001) (holding generally, the plaintiff does not need to identify a specific prospective
contract that was interfered with).
The unavailability of the app also affected presentations with tolling authorities
who were interested in the PToll™ application and how it could improve their tolling, but
these tolling authorities were unable to download the app in advance of the
presentation. As alleged in the petition:

PAGE 17

Case 1:14-cv-01062-SS Document 8 Filed 12/15/14 Page 20 of 24

HTA’s interference has been a proximate cause of harm to
BancPass, and BancPass incurs actual damages and losses
when consumers are unable to obtain the PToll™ app, and
as BancPass is unable to demonstrate its product to
additional tolling authorities.
See Plaintiff’s Original Petition, ¶ 29.
BancPass has not yet had the opportunity to see all of the correspondence that
HTA sent to tolling authorities, Google and Apple. Discovery should reveal the content
of such communications and enable BancPass to plead HTA’s malfeasance in even
greater detail.
Since BancPass was able to have PToll™ reinstated by the Google Play store,
HTA appears to argue that this case should be dismissed because it believes the
damages BancPass has suffered are small.6 The fact that a defendant contests an
amount of damages does not justify dismissal pursuant to Rule12(b)(6). Moreover, the
facts that BancPass’s damages are unliquidated, and that the exact amount of damages
suffered is not yet known, likewise do not warrant dismissal. See Avitia v. Metropolitan
Club of Chicago, Inc., 49 F.3d 1219, 1226 (7th Cir. 1995) (plaintiff not required to
itemize damages in complaint).

Indeed, BancPass’s petition appropriately pleads

damages “in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court” as required by Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 47.
BancPass has sufficiently pled its tortious interference claims, and HTA’s motion
to dismiss should be denied.

6

This is ironic considering that it was HTA who removed this case on diversity grounds,
specifying that the amount in controversy exceeds this Court’s jurisdiction.

D.

Should the court grant Defendant’s motion in any part, Plaintiff
requests leave to amend

Should this court find that Defendant’s motion is meritorious in any respect and
be inclined to grant it, Plaintiff respectfully requests leave to amend. “Generally, a court
will not dismiss without leave to amend on the first challenge to the plaintiff’s complaint.”
Curley v. Perry, 246 F.3d 1278, 1281-82 (10th Cir. 2001); 5B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT &
ARTHUR R. MILLER

ET AL.,

FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE §1357 (3d ed. 2014).

(“[D]istrict court normally will give the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint.”).
BancPass drafted and filed its petition in state court in accordance with Texas
law and pleading rules. Should the court determine there are any deficiencies under
federal pleading rules, BancPass requests the opportunity to amend to address any
such issues.7 Finally, at this time, BancPass does not possess all of the evidence
against HTA regarding its conduct, but BancPass has pled based on the evidence in its
possession, the letter BancPass received from HTA admitting defendant’s actions, and
events that took place shortly after the letter was received.

BancPass respectfully

requests the opportunity to conduct discovery to learn more details regarding HTA’s
conduct.

Although Defendant characterizes its motion as a motion to dismiss for failure to state
a claim its motion as it is written actually seeks a more definite statement. In fact, in its
second sentence, Defendant’s motion complains that “Plaintiff’s claims lack the
specificity required for a proper pleading.” See Defendant’s Rule 26(b)(6) Motion to
Dismiss at 1. To the extent the court agrees, the appropriate relief would be to order a
more definite statement, which Plaintiff is willing to do if so ordered. See FED. R. CIV. P.
12(E).

IV.

CONCLUSION

BancPass has met the minimum threshold of the pleading requirements and has
provided a short statement with facts that puts HTA on notice of the claims against it.
HTA is aware of its actions, and has admitted such to BancPass in the September 30th
letter. BancPass seeks relief for: (1) tortious interference with existing contracts and
prospective business relations; (2) declaratory relief that rental car consumers have the
right to choose PToll™ as an alternative to HTA’s service; and (3) declaratory relief that
if BancPass were to agree to HTA’s demand to cede the rental car toll processing
market to it, such an agreement would be a per se violation of section one of the
Sherman Act. BancPass’s petition demonstrates it has standing to assert each of these
claims, and sets out facts that plausibly support each cause of action. The motion to
dismiss should, therefore, be dismissed.
V.

PRAYER

Wherefore, Plaintiff BancPass respectfully requests that HTA’s Rule 12(b)(6)
Motion to Dismiss be denied, or in the alternative, should the court believe the motion
should be granted in any part that BancPass be granted the opportunity to amend, and
that BancPass have all such further relief to which it may be justly entitled.
