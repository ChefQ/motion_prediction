UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

BRETTA KARP on behalf of herself
individually and all others similarly situated,
Plaintiff,

Civil Action No. 4:11-cv-10361-FDS

v.
CIGNA HEALTHCARE, INC.,
Defendant.
CONNECTICUT GENERAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY’S
MOTION TO DISMISS AND COMPEL ARBITRATION
Pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §§ 3, 4 and Rule 12(b)(1) and upon the pleadings, memoranda,
request for judicial notice, declarations, and documents submitted herewith, Defendant
Connecticut General Life Insurance Company1 (“CGLIC”), by its undersigned counsel,
respectfully requests that the Court compel Plaintiff Bretta Karp to arbitrate all claims against
CGLIC in bilateral arbitration, and to stay or dismiss proceedings in this case. CGLIC sets forth
the grounds for this Motion in its accompanying Memorandum of Law and Declarations.
Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, counsel for CGLIC certify that they have attempted to confer
with counsel of record for Plaintiff, Kevin Kinne, in good faith to resolve or narrow the issues
presented. Specifically, counsel for Defendant spoke with Mr. Kinne today, May 16, 2011, by
telephone after having placed several messages with him to discuss the pending motion. During
the phone conference, Mr. Kinne indicated that he was not in position to agree with granting the
relief requested in the present motion, as he needed to secure agreement from his co-counsel in the
case before doing so. During the phone conversation, it was agreed that Defendant would file its
motion and serve it upon Plaintiff and her counsel and the parties would continue discussions to
determine whether it might be possible to avoid a hearing in the matter.

Plaintiff’s employer, CGLIC, is incorrectly identified as “Cigna Healthcare, Inc.” in the
Complaint.
