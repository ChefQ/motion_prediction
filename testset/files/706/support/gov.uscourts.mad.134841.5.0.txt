Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 5 of 20

Defendant Connecticut General Life Insurance Company1 (“CGLIC” or “the Company”),
by its undersigned counsel, hereby submits this memorandum of law in support of its Motion to
Compel Arbitration pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 4, and dismiss this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b)(1).
I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Bretta Karp (“Plaintiff”) brings this purported class action under Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act and M.G.L. c. 151B, the Massachusetts anti-discrimination law. Plaintiff
alleges that CGLIC subjected her and an unspecified number of current and former female
employees to gender discrimination. Plaintiff’s Class Action Complaint (“Complaint”) ¶¶ 3, 20.
In 1998, and then again in 2005, Plaintiff executed an arbitration agreement with CGLIC
in which she explicitly agreed to submit employment claims to final, binding arbitration,
including specifically claims arising under Title VII and its state-law analogues (i.e., M.G.L. c.
151B). The Company’s arbitration policy and its arbitration rules and procedures also include a
class or collective action waiver and, therefore, require Plaintiff to proceed to arbitration on an
individual basis only. Despite agreeing to binding arbitration, including a class action waiver, as
a term and condition of her employment, Plaintiff filed the instant action and purports to bring a
putative class action in breach of her agreement.
The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and Supreme Court precedent mandate that
arbitration agreements be enforced according to their terms, AT&T Mobility LLC v.
Concepcion, --- S. Ct. ---, No. 09-0893, 2011 WL 1561956, at *4 (U.S. Apr. 27, 2011), and
claims under both Title VII and c. 151B are arbitrable. See, e.g., Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.
Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 122-23 (2001); Warfield v. Beth Israel Deaconness Med. Ctr., 454 Mass.

1

Plaintiff’s employer, CGLIC, is incorrectly identified as “Cigna Healthcare, Inc.” in the Complaint.

1

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 6 of 20

390, 395 (2009). Accordingly, CGLIC respectfully requests that the Court compel arbitration of
Plaintiff’s individual claims because Plaintiff and the Company entered into a binding arbitration
agreement and Plaintiff’s claims fall within the scope of that agreement. Furthermore, because
Plaintiff’s arbitration agreement explicitly precludes her from bringing class, collective or
representative actions, she is required to arbitrate her claims individually, and not on a class
basis.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

The Parties’ Pleadings

In June 1997, CGLIC hired Plaintiff as a Director of Contracting.

Declaration of

Marjorie Stein (“Stein Decl.”) ¶ 18. Plaintiff has held management positions throughout her
tenure at CGLIC, and currently oversees three “direct reports” and has five other employees who
indirectly report to her.2

Compl. ¶¶ 56-59, 63-64.

Her job duties include analyzing and

negotiating contracts that govern the rates and terms of CGLIC’s payments to its network
providers. Id. ¶ 63. Plaintiff also has a Masters of Business Administration degree. Id. ¶ 57.
Her current annual salary is $153,169.14. Stein Decl. ¶ 25. In March 2011, Plaintiff received a
bonus payment in the amount of $43,743. Id.
CGLIC is a subsidiary entity that is ultimately owned by CIGNA Corporation. Stein
Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.

Plaintiff has never been employed by CIGNA Healthcare, Inc., the named

defendant. Id. ¶¶ 4-5, 18.
B.

The Employee Handbook and Dispute Resolution Program Pleading

In February 1998, the Company provided Plaintiff with copies of its employment
policies, including a copy of its Employment Dispute Arbitration Policy then in effect. Id. ¶ 19.
Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of such on February 17, 1998. Id., Exh. F.
2

CIGNA assumes the truth of the allegations in the Complaint for purposes of this motion only.

2

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 7 of 20

Thereafter, in November 2005, CIGNA distributed an updated Employee Handbook (the
“Employee Handbook”) to the employees of CIGNA Corporation affiliated entities, including
CGLIC. Id. ¶¶ 6-7. The Employee Handbook describes the Company’s Employment Dispute
Resolution Program (“EDRP”).

The EDRP consists of two processes—an internal dispute

resolution component through which employees can raise concerns about a broad range of
workplace issues, and an external component that requires employees to arbitrate specified
employment-related disputes that arise between the employee and the Company. Id. ¶¶ 8-10.
The Employee Handbook makes clear that, by accepting employment, compensation
and/or benefits from a CIGNA Company (including CGLIC), an individual agrees to arbitrate
“serious employment-related disagreements” between himself or herself and the Company, as a
term and condition of employment. Id. ¶ 10, Exh. A at 25-26. The Employee Handbook also
identifies the types of disputes that the arbitration policy covers, including, but not limited to,
employment discrimination claims under Title VII and corollary state statutes, and directs
employees to the Company’s Employment Dispute Arbitration Policy (the “Arbitration Policy”)
and Employment Dispute Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules and Procedures”). Id.
C.

The Arbitration Policy and Rules and Procedures

Pursuant to the Arbitration Policy, “arbitration by a neutral third-party is the required and
final means for the resolution of any employment related legal claim not resolved by the CIGNA
Companies’ internal dispute resolution process.” Stein Decl., Exh. B at 1. This agreement to
arbitrate is a “term and condition of the employment relationship between an employee and the
Company.” Id.
The Arbitration Policy explicitly applies to “claims, demands, disputes, controversies or
actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . and any other federal, state or local

3

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 8 of 20

statute, regulation, ordinance, or common law doctrine, regarding employment discrimination,
retaliation, . . . [or] conditions of employment.” Id. at 2. Both the Arbitration Policy and the
Rules and Procedures clearly and explicitly prohibit class or collective actions:
No class-wide arbitrations are allowed under the CIGNA Companies’
Employment Dispute Arbitration Policy or the Rules and Procedures. The
arbitrator has no jurisdiction to certify any group of current or former employees,
or applicants for employment, as a class in any arbitration proceeding.
***
Each party seeking resolution of its, his or her claims pursuant to an agreement to
arbitrate under these Rules and Procedures must proceed individually. There shall
be no class or representative actions permitted. An Arbitrator shall have no
authority to hear claims of or award damages to any person or entity who has not
initiated arbitration and selected an arbitrator in accordance with these Rules and
Procedures. Also, an arbitrator shall not have authority to consolidate claims or
consider individual claims collectively on the ground that such actions promote
efficiency or that the individual damages may be too small to proceed
economically, except when there is an express agreement between the Company
and the employees in writing, or on the stenographic record of the particular
arbitration proceeding for which the agreement to proceed collectively is made.
See Stein Decl., Exh. B at 3 (Arbitration Policy); Exh. C at 2 (Rules and Procedures).
Finally, the Rules and Procedures provide for a series of processes that permit employees,
including Plaintiff, to pursue their individual claims in arbitration and obtain the same individual
relief they could obtain in a court of law, including, inter alia:
•

Applying the same statute(s) of limitations applicable to claims brought in court;

•

company payment of arbitration costs (except for a modest filing fee and expenses
for depositions taken by the employee);

•

the opportunity to be represented by counsel;

•

requiring that the arbitrator be a neutral party, and be knowledgeable and
experienced in employment law and the resolution of employment disputes;

•

the opportunity to select an arbitrator under the American Arbitration
Association’s (“AAA”) struck panel method;

4

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 9 of 20

•

requiring the arbitrator to follow applicable statutory and case law;

•

requiring the arbitrator to apply the same burdens of proof applicable under
federal, state, or local law;

•

empowering the arbitrator to award all equitable and legal remedies that would be
available in court under applicable law, including an award of attorney fees to a
prevailing plaintiff, as provided by law;

•

the opportunity for discovery, including depositions and the exchange of
documents and exhibits;

•

requiring a written decision setting forth the arbitrator’s reasoning; and

•

the opportunity for judicial review and confirmation in accordance with the FAA.

See id. ¶ 16, Exh. C.
D.

Plaintiff Accepted and Agreed to CGLIC’s Arbitration Policy

At the time the Company updated the Employee Handbook in November 2005, it
circulated to all employees a web page that contained a hyperlink to an Affirmation Form. Stein
Decl. ¶ 20. All employees (including Plaintiff) were required, as a term and condition of
employment, to complete the Affirmation Form and assent to the terms set forth in the Employee
Handbook by typing their full name in a blank box and clicking a button denoted “Yes.” Id. ¶
21. Once an employee clicked on the “Yes” button, the full name, time, and date of the
employee’s act was electronically memorialized. Id.
The Company’s electronic records reflect that Plaintiff executed the Affirmation Form on
November 22, 2005 at 8:22:19 a.m. Id. ¶ 22. By electronically executing the Affirmation Form,
Plaintiff acknowledged, in pertinent part:
I acknowledge that I have received or reviewed the updated (November 2005)
CIGNA Employee Handbook, which outlines the policies that are available and
applicable to all of the CIGNA companies’ employees.
***

I agree any dispute between CIGNA and me arising out of or relating to my
candidacy for employment, employment, or termination of employment with
CIGNA (with the exception of workers compensation claims ERISA claims and
administrative agency charges) shall be resolved under CIGNA’s Employment
Dispute Arbitration Program which includes final mandatory binding arbitration.
***
I understand that any such Arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the CIGNA
Employee Dispute Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time such
arbitration is commenced.
Id. ¶ 23, Exh. G.
III.

ARGUMENT
Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s express agreement to arbitrate her individual employment

claims on a non-class basis, including specifically claims under Title VII and state statutes
governing employment discrimination (such as c. 151B), she filed the instant putative class
action on March 4, 2011. Through this motion, CGLIC seeks to enforce its contractual rights
and compel Plaintiff to arbitrate her individual claims on a non-class basis and dismiss the
proceedings in this Court.
A.

The FAA Mandates Enforcement of Plaintiff’s Agreement to Arbitrate

The FAA was enacted “in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration
agreements.” AT&T Mobility, 2011 WL 1561956, at *4. It requires courts to enforce arbitration
agreements, reflecting the federal policy strongly favoring arbitration as a method of alternative
dispute resolution. 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.; see AT&T Mobility, 2011 WL 1561956, at *8 (“[T]he
‘principal purpose’ of the FAA is to ‘ensure[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced
according to their terms.’”); Powershare, Inc. v. Syntel, Inc., 597 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2010)
(“federal law undeniably includes a policy favoring arbitration”); Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch.,
Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 148 (1st Cir. 1998) (“questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a
healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration”).

6

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 11 of 20

“In line with these principles, courts must place arbitration agreements on equal footing
with other contracts and enforce them according to their terms.” AT&T Mobility, 2011 WL
1561956, at *5 (citations omitted). The First Circuit applies a four-part test to determine whether
to enforce an arbitration agreement. The party seeking arbitration must prove that (1) a valid
agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) the party is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause; (3) the nonmoving party is bound by the arbitration clause; and (4) the claim asserted comes within the
clause’s scope. Campbell v. Gen’l Dynamics Corp., 407 F.3d 546, 552 (1st Cir. 2005). Each of
these requirements is satisfied in this case.
1.

Plaintiff Entered Into a Valid Agreement with CGLIC

For the “validity” inquiry, courts generally “apply ordinary state-law principles that
govern the formation of contracts.” Boateng v. Gen’l Dynamics Corp., 473 F. Supp. 2d 241,
247-248 (D. Mass. 2007). “The essential question is whether Plaintiff accepted the arbitration
agreement,” and whether she “entered into a valid, enforceable agreement to arbitrate [her]
claims.” Ellerbee v. Gamestop, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 2d 349, 354 (D. Mass. 2009).
In this context, an employer has the “relatively light burden” of showing that it provided
“some minimal level of notice sufficient to apprise [plaintiff] that continued employment would
effect a waiver of the right to pursue the claim in a judicial forum.” Campbell, 407 F.3d at 555;
Ellerbee, 604 F. Supp. 2d at 354 (“Plaintiff’s continued employment constitutes adequate
consideration for the [arbitration] contract.”).
There is undoubtedly a valid agreement here. As early as February 1998, Plaintiff
acknowledged receipt of, and agreed to be bound by, CGLIC’s arbitration policy then in effect.
Stein Decl. ¶ 19. In November 2005, Plaintiff was provided a copy of the updated Employee
Handbook. Id. ¶¶ 7, 20-22. Both the Employee Handbook and the Arbitration Policy referenced
therein state in no uncertain terms that, by accepting employment, compensation or benefits from

7

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 12 of 20

the Company, an employee agrees to arbitrate employment-related disputes, including
employment discrimination claims arising under Title VII and state law corollary statutes. Id. ¶¶
10, 13; Exh. A at 25-26, Exh. B at 1-2. At the same time that Plaintiff received the updated
Employee Handbook, she reviewed and executed an electronic Affirmation Form. Id. ¶ 22. By
clicking “Yes” on this Affirmation Form, Plaintiff expressly agreed that any disputes arising out
of her employment would be resolved in final, mandatory binding arbitration governed by the
Rules and Procedures in effect at the time arbitration commences. Id. ¶ 23, Exh. G. The
Arbitration Policy and the Rules and Procedures also expressly prohibit class or representative
actions. Id. ¶¶ 13, 15; Exhs. B and C.
Against this factual backdrop, there can be no legitimate dispute that Plaintiff—an
experienced manager and MBA recipient whose job involves analyzing and negotiating
contracts—entered into a binding agreement with CGLIC to submit her individual claims like
those presented in the Complaint to arbitration. See Boateng, 473 F. Supp. 2d at 248-49 (valid
arbitration agreement existed where plaintiff's execution of agreement was a condition of her
employment and defendant demonstrated that plaintiff received agreement and executed
acknowledgement form); Gonzalez v. GE Grp. Admin’rs, Inc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 165, 169 (D.
Mass. 2004) (arbitration agreement was valid where plaintiff was notified of agreement and
signed acknowledgement form indicating he understood its terms); Deluca v. Bear Stearns &
Co., 175 F. Supp. 2d 102, 115-16 (D. Mass. 2001) (arbitration agreement was valid where
plaintiff was a sophisticated businesswoman with a college degree and was given an opportunity
to consider the terms of the agreement); see also 15 U.S.C. § 7001(a) (electronic execution of an
agreement is valid).

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

2.

Filed 05/16/11 Page 13 of 20

CGLIC Is Entitled to Invoke the Arbitration Agreement, and Plaintiff
Is Bound Thereby

While there is little case law discussing the second or third Campbell requirements, they
are certainly met here. The Employee Handbook and the Arbitration Policy expressly apply to
CGLIC, meaning CGLIC may invoke those provisions. See Soto v. State Chem. Sales Co. Int’l,
Inc., 719 F. Supp. 2d 189, 194 (D.P.R. 2010) (finding that employer was entitled to invoke
arbitration agreement because it was a party to agreement); Soto-Alvarez v. Apartment Inv. &
Mgmt. Co., 561 F. Supp. 2d 228, 231 (D.P.R. 2008) (same).

Likewise, because Plaintiff

electronically executed the Affirmation Form, she is bound by it. Id. Accordingly, these two
Campbell requirements are satisfied.
3.

The Complaint Is Within the Scope of the Arbitration Agreement

Finally, the allegations in the Complaint unquestionably fall within the scope of the
parties’ arbitration agreement. As set forth in the Employee Handbook and Arbitration Policy,
Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate “serious employment-related disagreements and problems,” defined
to include, in pertinent part, “claims, demands, disputes, controversies or actions under Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . and any other federal, state or local statute, regulation,
ordinance, or common law doctrine, regarding employment discrimination, retaliation, ... [or]
conditions of employment.” Stein Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13; Exh. A at 25-26, Exh. B at 1-2.
In the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts claims under Title VII and M.G.L. c. 151B, a “state . .
. statute . . . regarding employment discrimination,” and thus the claims asserted are squarely
within the scope of the Arbitration Policy. See Ellerbee, 604 F. Supp. 2d at 352-53 (arbitration
agreement that defined “Covered Claims” to include discrimination claims applied to action
under c. 151B); Gonzalez, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 170-71 (Title VII and c. 151B within the scope of
an arbitration agreement that specifically identified employment discrimination claims as

9

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

Filed 05/16/11 Page 14 of 20

arbitrable); see also Boateng, 473 F. Supp. 2d at 247 (“any doubts concerning the scope of
arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration”) (quoting Moses H. Cone Mem'l
Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983)).
Because the claims in the Complaint fall within the scope of a valid arbitration
agreement, CGLIC respectfully requests that the Court compel Plaintiff to arbitrate her
individual claims.
B.

This Matter Cannot Proceed as a Class Action

The Supreme Court recently held that when an arbitration agreement is governed by the
FAA (as is the one at issue here), class wide arbitration is forbidden unless it is explicitly
permitted under the agreement. Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., 130 S.Ct. 1758,
1776 (2010). Here, the Arbitration Policy and the Rules and Procedures not only fail to permit
class arbitration, but both expressly and unequivocally prohibit this case from proceeding as a
class action. As set forth in the Arbitration Policy:
No class-wide arbitrations are allowed under the CIGNA Companies’
Employment Dispute Arbitration Policy or the Rules and Procedures. The
arbitrator has no jurisdiction to certify any group of current or former employees,
or applicants for employment as a class in any arbitration proceeding.
Stein Decl. ¶ 13, Exh. B at 1-2 (Arbitration Policy) (emphasis added).
Similarly, the Rules and Procedures state the following, in pertinent part:
Each party seeking resolution of its, his or her claims pursuant to an agreement to
arbitrate under these Rules and Procedures must proceed individually. There shall
be no class or representative actions permitted. An Arbitrator shall have no
authority to hear claims of or award damages to any person or entity who has not
initiated arbitration and selected an arbitrator in accordance with these Rules and
Procedures. Also, an arbitrator shall not have authority to consolidate claims or
consider individual claims collectively on the ground that such actions promote
efficiency or that the individual damages may be too small to proceed
economically, except when there is an express agreement between the Company
and the employees in writing, or on the stenographic record of the particular
arbitration proceeding for which the agreement to proceed collectively is made.

Filed 05/16/11 Page 15 of 20

Id. ¶ 15, Exh. C (Rules and Procedures); see also Exh. D.
This plain language controls and precludes Plaintiff from pursuing her claims on a class
basis.3 As the Supreme Court made clear in AT&T Mobility, “[t]he overarching purpose of the
FAA . . . is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to
facilitate streamlined proceedings.” 2011 WL 1561956, at *8. In contrast to arbitration on an
individual basis, “[a]rbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class litigation.” Id. at *12.
Here, the Arbitration Policy and Rules and Procedures recognize this reality. By their express
terms, they both prohibit the type of class claims Plaintiff purports to assert in the Complaint.
Because fidelity to the terms of an arbitration agreement is the paramount concern of the FAA,
this case cannot proceed as a class action. Id. at *8; see also Vilches v. The Travelers Co., Inc.,
No. 10-2888, 2011 WL 453304, at *4-6 (3d Cir. Feb. 9, 2011) (finding collective action waiver
of FLSA claims in arbitration policy enforceable); Jock v. Sterling Jewelers, Inc., 725 F. Supp.
2d 444, 449-50 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (arbitration in an employment discrimination case could not

evidence that parties intended to arbitrate class claims); Green v. SuperShuttle Int’l, Inc., Civil
No. 09-2129, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95235, at *7-9 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2010) (enforcing class
arbitration waiver in FLSA case where plain language of arbitration agreement precluded class
claims); Pomposi v. Gamestop, Inc., No. 3:09-cv-340, 2010 WL 147196, at *4, *6-8 (D. Conn.

Whether the arbitration agreement forbids class arbitration must be decided by this Court, not the arbitrator.
When there is no ambiguity as to the class prohibition in the arbitration agreement, the question of whether
that clause “may be enforced under the FAA is for the court.” Skirchak v. Dynamics Research Corp., 508
F.3d 49, 56 (5th Cir. 2007); compare Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F.3d 25, 53-54 (decision was for the
court “because of the clarity of the prohibition against class arbitration”) with Anderson v. Comcast Corp.,
500 F.3d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (ambiguity as to the term “unless your state’s laws provide otherwise” in
class arbitration clause was for arbitrator to resolve). The class bar here is clear, and brooks no
uncertainties or exceptions: “No class-wide arbitrations are allowed.” The issue is therefore ripe for
decision now, in this Court.

Plaintiff may attempt to circumvent the plain language of the Arbitration Policy and the
Rules and Procedures by relying upon two decisions in the consumer class action context that
pre-date the Supreme Court’s recent decision in AT&T Mobility—Kristian v. Comcast Corp.,
446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2006) and Feeney v. Dell, Inc., 454 Mass. 192 (2009). AT&T Mobility,
however, abrogates both decisions, thus rendering their holdings inapplicable here. Moreover,
even if AT&T Mobility had not been decided, Kristian and Feeney are inapposite because the
policy rationale behind those cases does not exist in the employment context.
In AT&T Mobility, the respondents were consumers who alleged that AT&T violated
California consumer protection statutes by charging sales tax on mobile phones that had been
advertised as free. The respondents’ contract with AT&T—like Plaintiff’s agreement to arbitrate
in this case—provided for arbitration of all disputes between the parties, but did not permit
classwide arbitration. AT&T Mobility, 2011 WL 1561956, at *2. The agreement between the
parties also authorized AT&T to make unilateral amendments to the contract, which it did on
several occasions. Id. Relying on the California Supreme Court’s decision in Discover Bank v.
Superior Court, 113 P.3d 1100 (Cal. 2005), the District Court found the arbitration provision was
unconscionable because AT&T had not shown that individual arbitration adequately substituted
for the deterrent effects of class actions.4 The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s denial
of AT&T’s motion to compel arbitration.
In reversing the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court noted that “[r]equiring the availability
of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a
scheme inconsistent with the FAA.” Id. Relying in large part on the fundamental principle that
4

In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court held that class action waivers in consumer arbitration
agreements are unconscionable in cases that involved adhesion contracts, nominal amounts of damages,
and allegations of consumer fraud because such waivers, in violation of California law, effectively permit a
defendant to exculpate itself against its own fraud. Discover Bank, 113 P.3d at 1110.

Case 4:11-cv-10361-FDS Document 5

the FAA requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms, the Supreme
Court held that the FAA preempted the ruling in Discover Bank that California unconscionability
law is a generally applicable defense to contract formation.
The Supreme Court’s decision in AT&T Mobility makes it clear that it is impermissible
to create categorical judicial and legal exceptions that trump parties’ contractual agreements to
arbitrate. See 2011 WL 1561956, at *5 (arbitration agreements cannot be invalidated “by
defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an
agreement to arbitrate is at issue”). This is precisely what the courts in Kristian and Feeney did
when they relied on a “vindication of statutory rights” theory to strike down class arbitration
waivers.5 The courts in Kristian and Feeney determined that, in light of the realities of antitrust
and consumer class litigation (i.e., cases where there is a gross disparity between litigation costs
and monetary recovery for individuals), a class arbitration waiver would effectively prohibit
plaintiffs from bringing such claims. Kristian, 446 F.3d at 58-60; Feeney, 454 Mass. at 205.
Unwilling to accept this outcome, the courts declined to enforce class arbitration bars on the
basis that they effectively prevented the plaintiffs from vindicating their right to pursue antitrust
claims, Kristian, 446 F.3d at 64, and violated the public policy of Massachusetts favoring class
actions, Feeney, 454 Mass. at 205.

Because Kristian and Feeney run contrary to AT&T

Mobility, the holdings in those cases are inapplicable here.
Moreover, the policy concerns underlying the courts’ decisions in Kristian and Feeney
are absent in the employment discrimination context. Here, Plaintiff asserts claims under Title
VII and M.G.L. c. 151B. Under both statutes, a claimant can obtain broad and substantial relief:

5

In ruling that the class arbitration bar was unenforceable, the First Circuit in Kristian stated that its holding
was consistent with those of other courts, including the California Supreme Court’s decision in Discover
Bank that the Supreme Court overturned in AT&T Mobility. Kristian, 446 F.3d at 59-60.

13

back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages, statutory interest, and attorneys’
fees and costs. While emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages under
Title VII are limited to $300,000, potential front and back pay awards under that law are not
limited. See 42 U.S.C. § 1981a. Moreover, damage awards under M.G.L. c. 151B are totally
uncapped, even for emotional distress or punitive damages. See M.G.L. c. 151B, § 9. Thus, in
sharp contrast to Kristian and Feeney, the recovery Plaintiff (or any similarly situated individual)
might obtain under these laws is substantial, and a class action bar will have no recognizable
effect on the vindication of Plaintiff’s rights.6

That an individual employment discrimination claimant (like Plaintiff) may obtain a large verdict is not just
a matter of surmise; it is an empirical fact. A survey of 57 jury verdicts awarded since 2000 from this
District Court and Massachusetts state courts show that the average verdict for an employment
discrimination case is $848,253. See Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice, submitted concurrently, at ¶
1; Declaration of Sarah Green, Esq. (“Green Decl.”) at ¶¶ 3-10. This starkly contrasts with Kristian and
Feeney, where the claimants could expect no more than a few hundred to a few thousand dollars; an
amount so low that no single person or attorney would realistically bring a claim. See 446 F.3d at 58; 454
Mass. at 204. Since “a plaintiff with a colorable $300,000 [or $800,000] claim [plus attorney fees on top of
that] will undoubtedly find at least one lawyer willing to prosecute his case on a contingency basis” (Reid
v. Supershuttle Int’l, Inc., No. 08-CV-4854 , 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26831, *9 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2010)),
an individual claimant can clearly vindicate her rights under the discrimination laws. See id.; Banus v.
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 7128, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40072, *31 n.61 (S.D.N.Y. Apr.
23, 2010) ($45,675 sufficiently large for claimant to vindicate her rights); Pomposi, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
1819, at *18-23 ($11,000 amount in controversy); Bonnano v. Quizno’s Franchise Co., LLC, No. 06-cv02358, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37702, *50-51 (D. Colo. Apr. 20, 2009) ($60,000 to $75,000 sufficient). In
addition, private class actions are rarely part of the enforcement of c. 151B or Title VII. In 2009 alone,
15,231 employment discrimination cases were filed nationally. See Request for Judicial Notice ¶ 2; Green
Decl. ¶ 11. In this District, 1,746 employment discrimination cases were filed between 2000 and 2010.
See Request for Judicial Notice ¶ 3; Green Decl. ¶¶ 12-15, Exh. A. Of these 1,746 cases, only 9 were
brought as class actions – just 0.51 percent. See Request for Judicial Notice ¶ 5; Green Decl. ¶¶ 20-23.
Further, of these, only 2 were actually certified. See id. This once more contrasts with Kristian and
Feeney, which arose in the consumer rights milieu, where (given the small stakes) those pre-AT&T
Mobility courts concluded that class actions are necessary. Statistics are illustrative here as well: of the
1,073 class / collective actions filed in this District from 2000 to 2010, only 9 of these (less than 0.84%)
were employment discrimination matters. See Request for Judicial Notice ¶¶ 4-5; Green Decl. ¶¶ 16-23,
Exh. B.
