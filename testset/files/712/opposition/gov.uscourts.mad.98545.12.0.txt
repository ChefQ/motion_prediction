Civil Action No. 05-11249-GAO

LIMITED OPPOSITION OF DEFENDANTS LIBERTY MUTUAL GROUP,
INC., LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, LIBERTY MUTUAL
FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, EMPLOYERS INSURANCE COMPANY OF
WAUSAU AND ST. JAMES INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. TO MOTION TO
STAY THIS ACTION PENDING A DETERMINATION ON TRANSFER BY
THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION
Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO Document12 Filed 06/24/2005 Page 2of8&

Defendants Liberty Mutual Group, Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,
Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, Employers Insurance Company of
Wausau and St. James Insurance Company, Ltd.! (collectively, the "Liberty
Defendants") hereby submit their limited opposition to the Motion to Stay this
Action Pending a Determination on Transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation. Unlike the moving parties, the Liberty Defendants are not parties to the
other cases that have been consolidated into the multidistrict litigation. Therefore
it would be unjust and inefficient to delay the determination of the Liberty
Defendants' motions to dismiss and potentially to force the Liberty Defendants to
present their motions to a federal court in New Jersey.

BACKGROUND

Following the filing of this action in Essex County Superior Court, on June
14, 2005 the Liberty Defendants served upon the plaintiff and the defendants who
had then appeared in the action three motions to dismiss: one on behalf of Liberty
Mutual Group, Inc.; one on behalf of St. James Insurance Company, Ltd.; and one
on behalf of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance
Company and Employers Insurance Company of Wausau. Massachusetts Superior
Court Rule 9A requires that all motions be served upon all other parties so that a
complete package including all motions and any oppositions later can be filed with

the court. Also pursuant to Rule 9A, the Liberty Defendants filed with the Superior

 

1 Defendant St. James Insurance Company) Ltd., having appeared specially before the Essex
Superior Court to contest jurisdiction prior to this action's removal to this Court, similarly appears
specially before this Court. St. James Insurance Company, Ltd.'s participation in this opposition
should not be construed as a general appearance in which it subjects itself to the jurisdiction of this
or any court.

Court Notices of Filing Motions to Dismiss so that the court would not default the
Liberty Defendants while they awaited service of any opposition to their motions to
dismiss. The next day, June 15, 2005, other defendants removed this action stating
in part that the Liberty Defendants had been joined fraudulently to defeat
diversity.2

The defendants seeking a stay of this action indicate that over twenty cases
similar to the present action have been consolidated in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. (Motion at p. 2.; Memo at p. 2.) Accordingly,
the moving defendants requested that the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
(JPML) transfer this action to the District of New Jersey for consolidation with the
existing multidistrict litigation. With one critical exception, the Liberty Defendants
do not dispute the moving defendants' description of the similarity of the present
action with those that have been consolidated and assigned to Judge Faith S.
Hochberg of the District of New Jersey as part of the In re Insurance Brokerage
Antitrust Litigation (the "MDL action"). Significantly, none of the Liberty

Defendants are parties to any of the cases that have been consolidated into the

MDL action.

 

2 Because the removing parties alleged that the Liberty Defendants had been joined fraudulently,
the Liberty Defendants were not required parties to the removal of the action. See Polyplastics, Inc.
v. Transconex, Inc., 713 F.2d 875, 877 (15 Cir. 1983).

ARGUMENT
A STAY OF THIS ACTION PRIOR TO A RULING ON THE LIBERTY

DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS TO DISMISS WOULD BE UNJUST AND
INEFFICIENT.

I. A Stay Should Be Granted Only When Doing So Is In The Interests Of
Judicial Economy And Will Not Unduly Prejudice A Non-Moving Party.

To determine whether a stay of proceedings is appropriate, courts must
consider judicial economy, the inequity that would result in the absence of a stay
and prejudice to the non-moving party if a stay is granted. See, e.g., Rivers v. Walt
Disney Co., 980 F.Supp. 1358, 1360 (C.D.Cal. 1997). In addition, if a motion to stay
is made in connection with a request to transfer to multidistrict litigation (MDL)
and there are motions pending, courts should consider whether the issues raised in
the pending motions are likely to arise in other actions pending in the MDL
transferee court. Shields v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 232 F.Supp.2d 715, 718
(E.D.Tex. 2002).

In Shields, defendants in a class action case requested a transfer from the
Eastern District of Texas to multidistrict litigation elsewhere and moved for a stay
of the proceedings pending the transfer. 232 F.Supp.2d at 717. At the time the
motion to stay was filed, a motion to, remand and an opposition to the transfer order
were pending with the Eastern District of Texas. Id. The Shields court denied the
motion to stay due to the pending motions. Id. at 718. The court relied in part upon
the standard letter to the District Court from the JPML regarding the conditional
transfer order that stated:

If you have a motion pending before you in the action . . . you are encouraged
to rule on the motion unless you conclude that the motion raises issues likely
Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO Document12 _ Filed 06/24/2005 Page 5of8

to arise in other actions in the transferee court, should we order transfer, and
would best be decided there." Id. at n. 1 (quoting Letter from Chairman
William Terrell Hodges, dated September 30, 2002)(emphasis added by

court).
The Shields court recognized the wisdom of allowing the transferee court to rule on
issues common to multiple cases while adjudicating issues that would prevent the
transferee court from expending its resources on a matter the transferor court was
capable of deciding. Id. at 718.
II. Only If The Liberty Defendants' Motions To Dismiss Are Heard Before

Proceedings Are Stayed Can The Interests Of Justice And Judicial Economy
Be Preserved.

The Motion to Stay this Action Pending a Determination on Transfer by the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation should be denied to the extent that an
stay of this action would prevent this court from ruling on the Liberty Defendants'
motions to dismiss. A limited stay that allows for a ruling upon the Liberty
Defendants' motions to dismiss better addresses the multiple considerations
relevant when courts consider a motion for a stay.

First, a stay of this action prior to the determination of the Liberty
Defendants' motions to dismiss would not further the interests of judicial economy.
As recognized in Shields, there are occasions where the transferor court is better
suited to address pending motions than the potential transferee court. 232
F.Supp.2d at 718. Here, because the Liberty Defendants are not parties to any of
the actions that are part of the MDL action it would cause the District of New
Jersey to use its limited resources to address an issue specific to the Liberty

Defendants. In addition, the Liberty Defendants' motions are based on
Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO Document12 Filed 06/24/2005 Page 6of8&

Massachusetts law - in which the District Court for the District of New Jersey
surely does not have superior experience or expertise. Thus, rather than burden
another court with the determination, this Court should make rulings on the
Liberty Defendants' motions to dismiss prior to staying the proceedings.

Second, addressing the Liberty Defendants' motions prior to a stay of the
proceedings would not cause any hardship or inequity for the moving defendants.
The moving defendants have argued that the Liberty Defendants have been joined
fraudulently by the plaintiffs in an attempt to defeat diversity. The moving
defendants' motion for stay and the goals of the multidistrict litigation statute - to
promote judicial economy and avoid inconsistent adjudications - are actually best
served by addressing the Liberty Defendants' motions to dismiss prior to the
determination on transfer. By arguing that the Liberty Defendants have been
joined fraudulently the moving defendants acknowledge that the Liberty
Defendants need not be parties to the MDL. Consequently, the moving defendants
would suffer no hardship if the Court rules on the Liberty Defendants' motions to
dismiss before the case potentially is transferred.

Third, allowing a stay of this action prior to ruling upon the Liberty
Defendants' motion to dismiss would cause significant, undue prejudice to the
Liberty Defendants. The Liberty Defendants initially served their motions to
dismiss in Essex Superior Court. Ifa stay is allowed an this case is transferred to
New Jersey, the Liberty Defendants would have to litigate this case in a distant

forum not of their choosing and, unlike the other defendants, in which it is not a
Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO Document12 Filed 06/24/2005 Page /7of8&

party to other similar cases. Further, the Liberty Defendants would be forced to
wait for the MDL court to complete its efforts to establish a calendar for motion
practice before having any motions to dismiss heard. Even if a stay enters and the
case is not transferred, the Liberty Defendants would remain parties to this action
and be required to bear the costs of litigation for a longer duration. In any calculus,
the Liberty Defendants would suffer significant prejudice if these proceedings are
stayed before a ruling on their motions to dismiss.

Finally, when considering the motions pending before this Court, it is clear
that a stay that allows for the consideration of the Liberty Defendants' motions to
dismiss is appropriate. The pending motions do not raise issues that are likely to
arise in the MDL action. The Liberty Defendants are not parties to any other case
consolidated into the MDL action. The moving defendants have argued that the
Liberty Defendants were joined fraudulently, which implies that the Liberty
Defendants do not have a role in the MDL action. Accordingly, the Liberty
Defendants' pending motions to dismiss would be best determined by this Court. As
such, the Court should not stay the proceedings prior to ruling on the pending

motions.

co NCLUSION

A stay of all activity in this action prior to a ruling on the Liberty Defendants'
motions to dismiss would be unjust and inefficient. If the motion for a stay is
allowed, the Liberty Defendants would be forced to remain a party to this action for

longer than necessary and potentially would be forced to have its motions to dismiss
|

Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO Document12 _ Filed 06/24/2005 Page 8of8&

heard in a distant court as part of an MDL in which it presently has no connection

whatsoever. The interests of judicial economy are served best by this Court ruling

upon motions based on Massachusetts law and not burdening the MDL action with

these issues.

WHEREFORE, the Liberty Defendants respectfully request that the Court

stay all activity in this case except for rulings on the Liberty Defendants' motions to

dismiss. Alternatively, the Liberty Defendants request that the Court deny the

Motion to Stay this Action Pending a Determination on Transfer by the Judicial

Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.
