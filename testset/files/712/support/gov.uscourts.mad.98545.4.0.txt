North America Inc., Willis Group Ltd., Universal Life Resources, Universal Life
Resources, Inc. (d/b/a ULR Insurance Services, Inc.), USI Holdings, Inc., MetLife, Inc.,
Prudential Financial, Inc., UnumProvident Corporation, The St. Paul Travelers
Companies, Inc., and Zurich American Insurance Company (collectively, “Movants”)
hereby moves this Court to stay this action until the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation (the “JPML”) either transfers this action or denies transfer. 1
This action is one of over twenty cases filed in or removed to various federal
courts across the country against insurers and insurance brokers on the heels of an
investigation by the New York Attorney General. Plaintiff’s action, like each of the other
actions in federal court, is based on the allegations contained in the New York Attorney
General complaints. The purported class sought to be certified in this action is a virtual
subset of the class sought to be certified in the other federal actions. In light of the
similarity of the various actions, the JPML in February 2005 transferred three cases that
had been brought to its attention to the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey, where they have been assigned to Judge Faith S. Hochberg as In re
Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1663. Some twenty cases have now
been consolidated before the MDL court. On June 17, 2005, the JPML clerk was notified

1

The Complaint names as a Defendant “American International Group” and not
“American International Group, Inc.” In filing this motion, the Movants reserve any
and all rights and defenses available under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, including but not limited to, arguments concerning ineffective service of
process, personal jurisdiction, and that any defendant is not a proper party to this
action.

that the above-captioned matter raises issues of fact and law in common with the
previously transferred actions and should be similarly transferred to Judge Hochberg.
For the reasons set for the herein and in the accompanying Memorandum in
Support, Movants respectfully request that the Court stay all proceedings in this action
until after the JPML either transfers the action to Judge Hochberg or denies said transfer.

WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Movants respectfully request that this
action be stayed until the JPML either transfers this action to the District of New Jersey
or denies transfer.
