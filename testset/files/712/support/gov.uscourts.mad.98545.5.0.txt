respectfully submit this Memorandum in support of their motion to stay this action until

the District of New Jersey or denies transfer. 1
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This action is one of over twenty cases filed in or removed to various federal
courts across the country against insurers and insurance brokers claiming deceptive and
anticompetitive conduct in the insurance industry. The actions were filed on the heels of
an investigation by the New York Attorney General, which resulted in two widely
publicized civil suits against two insurance brokers regarding their sales practices. Each
of these actions, like Plaintiff’s action here, is based on the allegations contained in the
New York Attorney General complaints and purports to allege industry-wide
anticompetitive practices. In light of the similarity of the underlying allegations, the
JPML in February 2005 transferred the cases that had been brought to its attention to the

1

The Complaint names as a Defendant “American International Group” and not
“American International Group, Inc.” In filing this motion, the Movants reserve any
and all rights and defenses available under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, including but not limited to, arguments concerning ineffective service of
process, personal jurisdiction, and that any defendant is not a proper party to this
action.

United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, where they have been
assigned to Judge Faith S. Hochberg as In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation,
MDL No. 1663.
On June 17, 2005, the JPML clerk was notified that this action raises issues of
fact and law in common with the previously transferred actions. This action is based on
the same alleged conduct and seeks certification of a class that is a subset of the putative
classes in the cases that have been consolidated and transferred to Judge Hochberg.
Movants thus anticipate that the JPML will also transfer the present action to Judge
Hochberg. As a result, Movants respectfully request that the Court stay all proceedings
in this action until after the JPML either transfers the action to Judge Hochberg or denies
transfer.
A stay is in the interest of justice and efficiency because this action and the
consolidated actions are based on the same factual allegations, raise the same legal issues,
and involve nearly identical claims. Allowing Judge Hochberg to resolve all issues—
including any objections that Plaintiff may raise to the appropriateness of removal—will
promote judicial economy and prevent inconsistent rulings. A single judge, rather than
several, should decide the relevant questions.
Permitting this action to go forward without a stay, particularly into discovery,
would defeat the purpose of the JPML’s transfer of the other cases to Judge Hochberg for
coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. Although plaintiff in the instant
action has failed to allege that it had any nexus with nearly all of the Defendants,
nineteen of the Defendants in this action (all but The Chubb Corporation and the Liberty

Defendants) are defendants in the proceedings before Judge Hochberg, and each is
already litigating the same issues and allegations in the District of New Jersey. Judge
Hochberg has consolidated the cases into two groups, has entered a scheduling order, and
has established procedures for the parties to confer on the establishment of a document
depository and a confidentiality order. The efficiencies of this approach would be lost if
Defendants here were forced to proceed simultaneously in this district.
In contrast to the prejudice and cost that would result to Defendants from denying
a stay, Plaintiff—who delayed service of the summons and complaint for nearly three
months—will not be prejudiced by a brief stay until the issue of where this case will be
litigated is resolved. The paramount goals of the multidistrict litigation statute, to
promote judicial economy and avoid inconsistent adjudications, are best served in this
case if this action is stayed in its entirety pending a decision on transfer by the JPML.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On February 17, 2005—one day before the President signed the Class Action
Fairness Act of 2005 into law, and four months after the New York Attorney General
filed the Complaint on which this Action is based—Plaintiff’s counsel filed this
purported statewide class action on behalf of a Middlesex County plaintiff in
Massachusetts Superior Court for Essex County. The day before, Plaintiff’s counsel had
filed a purported nationwide class action, Palm Tree Computers, Inc. v. Ace USA, Inc. et
al., in a state court in Sanford, Florida, raising nearly the same allegations asserted here.
Ex. A (Palm Tree complaint).

The same day as Plaintiff filed this action, the JPML transferred three putative
class actions, alleging conduct identical to that described in this action, to the Honorable
Faith S. Hochberg in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for
coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings in conjunction with a case that was
already pending before Judge Hochberg. See In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust
Litigation, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1371 (J.P.M.L. 2005). In transferring these actions to Judge
Hochberg, the JPML concluded that “[c]entralization under Section 1407 is necessary in
order to eliminate duplicative discovery, prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings (especially
with respect to class certification matters), and conserve the resources of the parties, their
counsel and the judiciary.” Id. at 1372. The transferred actions were “purported class
actions involving allegations that common defendants and/or their alleged
co-conspirators have engaged in a combination and conspiracy to affect the sale of
insurance sold in the United States by rigging bids and allocating customers.” Id. The
JPML issued a conditional transfer order with respect to ten other cases in March 2005,
four more cases in April 2005, and three cases in June 2005. Additional related cases
have also been filed directly in the District of New Jersey and assigned to Judge
Hochberg.
Judge Hochberg has consolidated the actions in the MDL proceeding into two
groups (one involving commercial insurance and the other involving employee benefit
insurance) and has established a schedule for filing amended complaints and dispositive
motions. See Ex. B (Judge Hochberg’s Order No. 4). She also has ordered the
establishment of a document depository to coordinate discovery and has directed the

parties to confer on discovery and confidentiality procedures. See id. This process is
underway.
The First Amended Class Action Complaint in this action is closely similar to
many of the complaints in the MDL. The First Amended Complaint, like the complaints
in the MDL actions, alleges that insurance brokers and underwriters failed to disclose that
the underwriters paid “contingent commissions” to the brokers based on, among other
things, the volume of business the broker delivered. Compare First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) ¶¶ 65-76 with, e.g., Ex. C (Opticare Complaint) ¶¶ 70-106 (one of the cases
transferred to MDL 1663).2 Further, the First Amended Complaint alleges that brokers
and insurers engaged in certain instances of “bid-rigging” to ensure that brokers meet
their targets under the contingent commission agreements. Compare FAC ¶¶ 63 & 75-76
with, e.g., Ex. C, ¶¶ 107-120. Like the plaintiffs in the MDL, plaintiffs in this action seek
certification of a class of insurance purchasers, although the First Amended Complaint
seeks to limit the proposed class to Massachusetts residents, a proposed class that is
entirely included (except for a small difference in the proposed class period) within the
proposed nationwide classes in the MDL complaints. Compare FAC ¶ 115 with, e.g., Ex.
C, ¶ 174.
On June 15, 2005, Defendant Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. removed this
action to this Court. On June 17, 2005, Defendant MetLife, Inc. notified the JPML Clerk
2

As noted above and in the Notice of Removal filed on June 15, 2005, while Plaintiff
makes such allegations, allegations of a nexus between the Plaintiff and most of the
Defendants is entirely lacking.

by letter of the status of this case as a potential tag-along to the pending proceedings in
the District of New Jersey. Ex. D. Movants expect that the JPML will in the near future
issue a Conditional Transfer Order in accordance with its procedures, which will transfer
the action to the District of New Jersey if no objections are filed, and which will allow an
opportunity for briefing the issue of transfer if any party objects. See JPML Rule 7.4.
ARGUMENT
I.

THIS COURT HAS AUTHORITY TO ISSUE THE REQUESTED STAY
This Court has broad discretion to issue a stay based on its inherent power to

control its docket. See Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936); see also
Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997). In particular, a District Court has discretion
to decide whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, justice would be best
served by a stay of proceedings in the putative transferor court when an MDL transfer is
pending. See, e.g., Portnoy v. Zenith Laboratories, No. 86-3512, 1987 WL 10236, at *1
(D.D.C. Apr. 21, 1987).
As the Manual for Complex Litigation notes, “the objective of transfer is to
eliminate duplication in discovery, avoid conflicting rulings and schedules, reduce
litigation cost, and save time and effort on the part of the parties, the attorneys, the
witnesses and the courts.” Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) § 20.131 at 220
(1995). As a result, District Courts may stay proceedings pending transfer in order to
further these goals.

II. ALL FACTORS SUPPORT STAYING THIS ACTION.
In determining whether a stay of the proceedings is appropriate, courts consider
(1) judicial economy; (2) the hardship and inequity on the moving party without a stay;
(3) and prejudice the non-moving party will suffer if a stay is granted. See, e.g., Falgoust
v. Microsoft Corp., No. 00-0779, 2000 WL 462919, at *2 (E.D. La. Apr. 19, 2000);
Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (C.D. Cal. 1997). Because all three
of these factors weigh strongly in favor of a stay, a stay should be granted.
A. A Stay Is Necessary To Promote Judicial Economy And Avoid Inconsistent
Rulings.
Judicial efficiency results from a stay because if a case is later transferred to an
MDL proceeding, the transferor court will have “needlessly expended its energies
familiarizing itself with the intricacies of a case that would be heard by another judge,
[and] any efforts on behalf of the [transferor] court concerning case management will
most likely have to be replicated by the judge that is assigned to handle the consolidated
litigation. . . .” Rivers, 980 F. Supp. at 1360-61. Consequently, a majority of courts have
concluded that staying preliminary pretrial proceedings pending a ruling on a motion to
transfer and consolidate by the JPML is appropriate to conserve judicial resources. Id. at
1361. The factors that courts have considered in granting stays—uniformity, consistency,
and predictability—all favor staying this action.
Transfer of this action to MDL 1663 is a virtual certainty, as there are numerous
common issues of law and fact. As discussed above, this action is based on the same
allegations of fact as the cases consolidated before Judge Hochberg. The First Amended

8
21969391v5

Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO

Document 5

Filed 06/20/2005

Page 9 of 20

Complaint in this action, like the complaints in MDL 1663, seeks class certification and
sets forth virtually the same set of allegations against insurance brokers and insurance
companies. In fact, nineteen of the Defendants in this case are defendants in MDL 1663
and thus are litigating the identical issues in that forum. Because of these similarities, the
same issues will arise in this action and the consolidated cases—including the grounds
for motions to dismiss, whether any basis for challenging federal jurisdiction exists,
whether or to what extent class certification is appropriate, and the scope of discovery,
liability, and damages.
Allowing this to go forward without a stay, particularly into discovery, would put
the possibility of efficient and coordinated proceedings at risk and would defeat the
purpose of the JPML’s transfer of the other cases to Judge Hochberg. Pursuant to a
pretrial order issued by Judge Hochberg, a schedule for amended pleadings and motion
practice has been set, and the parties in the MDL are in the process of developing a plan
for consolidated and coordinated discovery and other pretrial proceedings. In the absence
of a stay, the efficiencies of this coordinated approach—for the judiciary as well as the
parties—would be diminished or lost.
Any motion to remand this case to Massachusetts Superior Court on jurisdictional
grounds would only provide a further reason for staying this action pending transfer to
MDL 1663. The questions raised in any remand motion are likely to include some of the
same issues that have arisen in the Palm Tree case filed by Plaintiff’s counsel in Florida
state court, and may well arise in additional actions during the course of the MDL
proceeding. The Palm Tree remand motions involve, among other things, issues

21969391v5

Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO

Page 10 of 20

concerning the interpretation of the effective-date provision of the Class Action Fairness
Act of 2005 and the effect of the failure of Defendant The Chubb Corporation (“Chubb”)
to join the notice of removal. See, e.g., Exs. E & F. We expect that, if Plaintiff or Chubb
moves to remand this case, it will raise the same issues here. In order to promote
consistency and efficiency and conserve judicial resources, a single court should resolve
these jurisdictional issues, including any attendant factual issues. See, e.g., Falgoust,
2000 WL 462919, at *2 (“[C]onsistency and economy would be served by resolution of
these [jurisdictional remand] issues by a single court after transfer by the JPML.”);
Weinke v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 989, 990 (E.D. Wis. 2000) (exercising
discretion to stay case pending transfer by JPML “in the interest of judicial economy and
to avoid inconsistent results” after plaintiff had moved to remand for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction); Tench v. Jackson Nat’l Life Ins. Co., No. 99 C 5182, 1999 WL
1044923, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 12, 1999) (stay appropriate because the issue of
calculation of the amount in controversy “may arise again in other actions” so that
“resolution in a single [MDL] forum will ensure consistency and avoid duplicative
efforts”); Johnson v. AMR Corp., No. 95-7659, 1996 WL 164415, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 3,
1996) (staying case where a jurisdictional objection to removal was pending because
“[o]nce transferred [to the MDL], the jurisdictional objections can be heard and resolved
by a single court”) (citation omitted); Boudreaux v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., No. 95138, 1995 WL 83788, at *2 (E.D. La. Feb. 24, 1995) (“the policies of efficiency and

Page 11 of 20

consistency of pre-trial rulings are furthered by a stay” where “the issue involved in this
remand motion is likely to be common to other transferred cases [in the MDL]”).3
B. Movants Would Suffer Hardship And Inequity Without A Stay
Movants would face substantial hardship in the absence of a stay. Movants are
already defending nearly identical allegations in claims now consolidated before Judge
Hochberg. Without a stay, Movants would be forced to litigate on multiple fronts, facing
inconsistent rulings and expending unnecessary costs. Because the costs of discovery in
these actions are likely to be considerable, the latter is a particularly significant risk.
Courts recognize that such risks constitute a hardship and inequity justifying a stay. See,
e.g., Falgoust, 2002 WL 462919, at *2 (defendant would suffer “considerable hardship
and inequity” if forced to simultaneously litigate multiple suits in multiple courts and
could potentially suffer conflicting rulings by different judges in multiple suits); Weinke,
84 F. Supp. 2d at 990 (noting “disadvantages of litigating identical claims in multiple
venues”).
In addition, denying a stay would defeat the purpose of the JPML’s consolidation
and transfer of the other cases to Judge Hochberg. The JPML transferred substantially
similar cases to Judge Hochberg in order to eliminate duplicative discovery, prevent
3

This case is therefore unlike In re Massachusetts Diet Drug Litigation, 338 F. Supp.
2d 198 (D. Mass. 2004), in which the remand motion raised issues unique to the
case. And even if for some reason the case were ultimately to be remanded to state
court (though there are no grounds to do so), a stay at this time will allow for
improved coordination between Judge Hochberg and the state court. A stay would
help Judge Hochberg achieve the goal of avoiding duplicative discovery between
state and federal court actions, regardless of where this action ultimately proceeds.

inconsistent pretrial rulings, and conserve the resources of the parties. See In re
Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1371, 1372 (J.P.M.L. 2005).
Without a stay, Defendants may be subject to each of the very harms that the JPML
intended to eliminate.
C. A Brief Stay Will Not Prejudice the Non-Moving Parties in Any Way
Neither Plaintiff nor the non-moving Defendants will suffer any prejudice from a
stay in these circumstances. The stay is likely to be brief. The JPML will likely meet
soon to consider the transfer request, and, in keeping with its past practice, will likely
issue a decision promptly. See, e.g., Falgoust, 2000 WL 462919, at * 2 (considering
delay likely to be short). A slight delay is not prejudicial. See id.; see also Weinke, 84 F.
Supp. 2d at 990 (plaintiffs’ “cursory assertions of prejudice” based on delay and
geographic disruption “[did] not outweigh the disadvantages of litigating identical claims
in a multitude of venues”). Particularly since Plaintiff delayed nearly three months after
filing the complaint before serving the Defendants, Plaintiff should not be heard to
complain that a brief additional delay will somehow cause it prejudice.
Moreover, though the merits of transfer is an issue for the JPML and not for this
Court, no party will be prejudiced by litigating this proposed class in New Jersey rather
than Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s counsel is also prosecuting a similar proposed class
action brought in Florida on behalf of a putative nationwide class and now awaiting
consideration of transfer by the JPML. See Ex. A. Nothing in the First Amended
Complaint’s factual allegations, beyond Plaintiff’s domicile and principal place of
business, is specific to Massachusetts. Given that Plaintiff’s own counsel and others are

12
21969391v5

Case 1:05-cv-11249-GAO

Document 5

Filed 06/20/2005

Page 13 of 20

already seeking to litigate the same matter on behalf of a proposed nationwide class that
includes the Plaintiff, no hardship will be caused by litigating these issues in a single
forum, rather than in multiple forums across the country. Transfer will also serve the
interests of the members of the proposed plaintiff class, by preventing the confusion that
could result from the possibility of communications from two different sets of attorneys
and courts if a class or classes were to be certified (though defendants deny that
certification is appropriate). And Defendant Chubb, which is a New Jersey corporation
having its principal place of business in Warren, New Jersey, surely will not suffer any
hardship by litigating in New Jersey rather than Massachusetts.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this action should be stayed until the JPML either
transfers this action to the District of New Jersey or denies transfer.
