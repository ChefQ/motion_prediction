Plaintiffs LL&L Innovations LLC ("LL&L") and Lowdown Distribution, Inc. [collectively,
"Plaintiffs"], submit this memorandum in support of their motion for a temporary restraining order
and preliminary injunction (the "Motion"). Through this motion, Plaintiffs seek to immediately enjoin
defendants Jerry Leigh of California, Inc. ("Jerry Leigh"), Kohl's Corporation ("Kohl's"), JC Penney
Company, Inc. ("JC Penney"), Rusty North America, LLC ("Rusty"), Rot Topic Merchandising, Inc.
("Rot Topic"), and Sun Coast Merchandise Corp. d/b/a Sunscope ("Sunscope")

[collectively,

"Defendants"] from making and selling products that infringe Plaintiffs' patent rights.
I.

INTRODUCTION
LL&L is the owner by assignment of US. Patent No. 7,519,192 (the "'192 patent").

The

, 192 patent is titled "Wired Clothing and Earphones" and claims the unique feature of a conductive
wire that acts as a draw string for a hooded garment, like a sweatshirt. The' 192 patent was filed on
September 13, 2005, and was validly issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on
April 14, 2009. On July 20, 2010, and in exchange for valuable consideration, LL&L licensed the
, 192 patent (the "License") to three related entities, including Lowdown [collectively "Lowdown"].
[Declaration of Edward Zhou in Support of Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary
Injunction ("Zhou Decl."), ~ 3.]

Under the License, Lowdown has the right to preclude any

additional licenses of the ' 192 patent to other parties. [Id at ~ 4.] As such, Lowdown is presently
the exclusive licensee of the ' 192 patent.
On or about July 7,2010, Lowdown became aware of unlicensed products infringing the
claims of the' 192 patent being offered for sale by Defendants. [Zhou Decl., ~ 6.]

These infringing

products are sold by various retail outlets including Kohl's, JC Penney, and Rot Topic. [Declaration
of James T. Burton in Support of Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary
Injunction ("Burton Decl."), ~~ 3-6, and Exhs. A-H.] The products are also sold under various brand
names, including the brand name Rusty. [Id at Exh. E.] The specific names of these products vary
from retailer to retailer, but include "Roodie Buddie with HB3 Technology", "Abbey Dawn 'Rock'
Striped Roodie with HB3 Technology", "Roodie Buddie Fleece", "Wired Series" sweatshirts, and
"Skeleton Rose Roodies" (collectively, "Infringing Products").

of these products includes the "HB3 Technology" manufactured by Jerry Leigh that infringes the
claims of the ' 192 patent. [I d.]
Jerry Leigh, directly or through its subsidiaries, divisions, groups, or distributors, makes, sells
and/or offers for sale or allows others to make, use, sell and/or offer for sale the Infringing Products.
Jerry Leigh has authorized Sunscope to market and sell the Infringing Products.

[Zhou Decl., ~ 6.]

Plaintiffs now seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in order to
immediately stop Defendants' infringement of the ' 192 patent through their manufacture and sale of
Infringing Products. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their patent infringement claim,
Plaintiffs have and will continue to suffer irreparable harm, the balance of hardships weighs in favor of
granting this Motion, and the public interest will be served by an order enjoining Defendants'
infringing activities.
II.

ARGUMENT
"[T]he principal value of [the' 192] patent" is the right to exclude others from making, selling,

or offering to sell the claimed invention. Hybritech Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 849 F.2d 1446, 1456 (Fed.
Cir. 1988); see 35 U.S.C. § 271 (2009). Plaintiffs' right to exclude Defendants from making, using,
selling, offering to sell, or importing the Infringing Products, which is at the heart of the patent grant,
is not readily compensated through monetary damages assessed after litigation. Hybritech, 849 F.2d
at 1456-57 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Accordingly, 35 U.S.C. § 283 authorizes this Court to protect Plaintiffs'
patent rights by issuing a preliminary injunction against Defendants' infringement.
An application for preliminary injunction predicated on patent infringement involves
substantive issues unique to patent law, and is therefore controlled by the law of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Id at 1451 n. 12. When considering a request for a
preliminary injunction, four factors are considered: "(1) a reasonable likelihood of success on the
merits of [the movant's] infringement claim; (2) irreparable harm if the proposed injunction is not
granted; (3) a balance of hardships tipping in [the movant's] favor; and (4) that the injunction will
have a favorable impact on the public interest."

Page -2-

Case 2:10-cv-00829-TC -SA Document 5

Filed 08/20/10 Page 8 of 22

Cir. 2001)). As will be shown below, Defendants should be temporarily restrained and preliminarily
enjoined from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing the Infringing Products during the
pendency of this case because each of the four factors weighs in favor of Plaintiffs.
A.

Plaintiffs Are Likely To Succeed On The Merits Of Their Claims Of Patent
Infringement

To establish a likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs "must show that [they] will likely
prove infringement, and that it will likely withstand challenges, if any, to the validity of the patent."
Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland, 566 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2009). To do so, Plaintiffs
must first show that Defendants' Infringing Products include "each claim limitation [of at least one
claim of the ' 192 patent] either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents." Seachange Int 'IInc. v.
C-CORlnc., 413 F.3d 1361,1377 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing CatalinaMktg. Int'lv. Coolsavings.com,
Inc., 289 F.3d 801, 812 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).

Plaintiffs' showing must be viewed "in light of the

presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits," Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Boehringer
Ingelheim GMBH, 237 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).

At trial,

Plaintiffs will be required to show infringement by a preponderance of the evidence. Kegel Co., Inc.
v. AMF Bowling, Inc., 127 F.3d 1420, 1425 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Defendants, on the other hand, have
the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence at trial. Titan Tire Corp. v. Case
New Holland, 566 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
In evaluating Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on its infringement claim, the Court must
conduct the same two-step infringement analysis that it would conduct at a later stage oflitigation.
See Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int'l, 316 F.3d 1331,1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003). First, the Court must
construe or determine the scope and meaning of the claim at issue. Id; Markman v. Westview
Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967,976

(Fed. Cir. 1995), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 (1996) (holding claim

construction a question oflaw). Second, the Court must compare the construed claim to the accused
product to determine whether the product meets each of the claim limitations. Oakley, 316 F.3d at
1339; see also CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., 288 F.3d 1359, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2002). At the
preliminary injunction stage, the Court need not issue a final claim construction but can instead

"engage in a rolling claim construction, in which the court revisits and alters its interpretation of the
claim terms as its understanding of the technology evolves." Jack Guttman, Inc. v. Kopykake Enters.,
Inc., 302 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
1.

Claim Construction

To construe Claim 1 of the ' 192 patent, the court begins with the language of the claim.
Rexnord Corp. v. Laitram Corp., 274 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In the absence of an express
intent to impart a novel meaning to a claim term, a "heavy presumption" exists that the term carries its
ordinary meaning to one of ordinary skill in the art. Altiris, Inc. v. Symantec Corp., 318 F. 3d 1363,
1369 (Fed. Cir. 2003); CCS Fitness, 288 F.3d at 1366. Thus, for example, Claim 1 of the ' 192 patent
means "what one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have understood [it] to
mean." Markman, 52 F.3d at 986. "In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as
understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim
construction in such cases involves little more than the application of widely accepted meaning of
commonly understood words." Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Such
is the case with claim 1 of the' 192 patent. Because the meaning of the claim language of claim 1 is
unambiguous and not currently in dispute, the Court does not need to ascribe any particular meaning
to the claim terms, particularly at this early stage of the proceedings.

Thus, for

purposes of assessing Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the issue of infringement, the Court need
only compare the claim language as commonly understood and explained in the specification to the
Infringing Products.

1

I Plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to request the Court to construe terms and phrases in claim 1, or any other
asserted claims, as this action progresses, particularly if Defendants raise claims or defenses based on claim construction

Defendants' Infringing Products Include Each Limitation Of At Least
Claim 1 Of The' 192 Patent

Each and every limitation of claim 1 is literally present in the Infringing Products. The table
below provides an infringement analysis of an exemplary Infringing Product2 that Plaintiffs have
identified: the "Roodie Buddy with HB3 Technology" sweatshirt. The "Roodie Buddy with HB3
Technology" sweatshirt is manufactured and sold by Jerry Leigh. Not only does the "Roodie Buddy
with HB3 Technology" sweatshirt (shown in the right column of the table below) contain each of the
elements recited in claim 1 of the ' 192 patent (which appear in the left column of the table below), but
the elements are positioned in a virtually identical manner to a disclosed embodiment of the ' 192
patent (see Figure 1 of'192 patent).

A combined garment and earphones,
comprising: a garment having a hood sized to
be selectively worn over a user's head, the
hood including an elongate internal passageway
along the border of the hood, and having left
and right apertures at each end of the
passageway;

The "elongate internal passage along the border
of the hood" is identified by the dashed line,
which has been added for identification
purposes. The "left and right apertures at each
end of the passageway" have been identified
with circles where the drawstring exits the
border of the hood.

2 There are no material differences between the various Infringing Products that are relevant to infringement of
claim 1 of the '192 patent. [Compare Burton Decl. at Exh. C with Burton Decl. at Exhs. A, E and G.]

Earphones, comprising: a conductive wire

passageway and having left and right lengths of
wire exiting through the left and right
apertures, respectively, wherein at least a
portion of the conductive wire assembly is
slideable within the passageway, and acts as a
drawstring for the hood;

a left and a right earpiece configured to be
worn in close proximity to the left and right
ears of the user, the earpieces being
electronically coupled to the left and right
lengths of wire, respectively, and including
transducers for emitting audio into the ears of
the user;

The conductive wire attached to the earphones
(shown below) passes through the drawstrings,
through the left and right apertures, and
through the entire elongate passageway around
the border of the hood. When the drawstrings
are pulled, the conductive wire slides within the
passageway of the hood to draw the border of
the hood inward, as shown above.

Each of the left and right drawstrings
terminates in an earpiece that includes
transducers for emitting audio into the ears.
This particular configuration of earphones is
commonly known as an "earbud," and is
designed to be inserted in the left and right ears,
respectively, of the wearer for the purpose of
listening to audio.

and a connection between the earphones and an
audio device for supplying an audio signal from
the audio device to the earphones.

Filed 08/20/10 Page 12 of 22

The connection
to the audio
device is in the
form of a plug
located in the
pocket of the
sweatshirt

Each element of claim 1 of the' 192 patent is literally present in the "Hoodie Buddy with HB3
Technology" Infringing Product. Any argued deviation from the demonstrated literal infringement
would infringe under the doctrine of equivalents. Plaintiffs have established the strong likelihood that
they will be successful in proving that Defendants infringe at least claim 1 of the ' 192 patent.
3.

Defendants Are Liable For Contributory And Induced Infringement Of
Claim 1 Of The' 192 Patent

In addition to Defendants' direct infringement, Defendants are also liable for induced and
contributory infringement of claim 1 of the ' 192 patent. 35 U. S.C. § 271 (b) provides that "whoever
actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer." A defendant is liable for
induced infringement if the defendant has an "actual intent to cause the acts which constitute the
infringement." Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Bausch &Lomb Inc., 909 F.2d 1464, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
Induced infringement is established if it is shown that the defendant "knew or should have known his
actions would induce actual infringements." Manville Sales Corp. v. Paramount Sys., 917 F.2d 544,
553 (Fed. Cir. 1990); DSU Medical Corp. v. JMS Co., 471 F.3d 1293, 1304-07 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en
banc in part). Here, the Infringing Products contain each and every element of the claim 1 as set forth
above. Defendants each also undeniably intend and instruct consumers to attach an audio device to
the connection located in the pocket of the Infringing Products for supplying audio to the earphones.

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Page -7-

Case 2:10-cv-00829-TC -SA Document 5

Filed 08/20/10 Page 13 of 22

With regard to contributory infringement, section 271 (c) defines contributory infringement as
selling, offering to sell, or importing:
[A] component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a
material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material
part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted
for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of
commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use ....
Thus, a defendant is liable as a contributory infringer if the defendant sells individual, unassembled
components that are material parts of the claimed invention and which have no other substantial use
except as part of the invention. Such is the case here. There is no substantial non-infringing use for
the earphones in the drawstrings of the Infringing Products other than to connect the earphones to an
audio device for supplying audio to the earphones. Whereas each of the Defendants know ofthe ' 192
patent and know that attaching an audio device to the connector in the pocket of the Infringing
Products to supply audio to the earphones potentially infringes at least claim 1 of the ' 192 patent,
Defendants are liable for contributory infringement of claim 1. See Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top
Replacement Co., 377 US. 476, 488-90 (1964); Trell v. Marlee Electronics Corp., 912 F.2d 1443,
1447 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
Because Defendants both supply the Infringing Products, which have no substantial noninfringing use, to consumers and instruct consumers to use the Infringing Products to infringe claim 1
of the ' 192 patent, which consumers in fact do, Defendants are liable for both contributory and
induced infringement of claim 1. Thus, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their infringement claims
against Defendants.
4.

The Claims Of The' 192 Patent Are Valid

The claims of the' 192 patent are presumed valid. See 35 US.C.

§ 282 (2009); Canon

Computer Sys., Inc. v. Nu-Kote Int 'I., Inc., 134 F.3d 1085, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1998). "[A] patent enjoys
the same presumption of validity during preliminary injunction proceedings as at other stages of
litigation." Titan Tire, 566 F.3d at 1377 (citing Canon Computer Sys., Inc. v. Nu-Kotelnt'lInc.,

134

F.3d 1085, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1998)); see also 35 US.C. § 282. Defendants cannot overcome this

presumption unless they can demonstrate "substantial questions of invalidity," which is viewed
through the clear and convincing evidence standard Defendants must carry at trial. Amazon. com, Inc.
v. Barnesandnoble.com,

Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2001); see also Canon Computer Sys.,

134 F.3d at 1088 (internal citations omitted) (because "a patent is presumed valid, and this
presumption exists at every stage of the litigation ... where the challenger fails to identify any
persuasive evidence of invalidity, the very existence of the patent satisfies the patentee's burden on
the validity issue").
The only validity argument articulated by Defendants to date is an allegation that website
advertisements for the O'Neil "Hub" jacket invalidate the claims of the ' 192 patent. [Burton Decl., ~
7 and Exh. I.] The most glaring deficiency of the Hub jacket website, however, is that it fails to teach
a conductive wire that is slideable within a passageway and that acts a drawstring, as required by
claim 1 of the ' 192 patent. Defendants have not produced any evidence tending to show that the
conductive wires of the Hub jacket are slideable in a passageway and act as drawstrings, much less
any evidence that could possibly rise to the clear and convincing standard Defendants must carry at
trial.
Indeed, the claims of the' 192 patent were allowed over similar art cited by the responsible
examiner during prosecution of the application that ripened into the' 192 patent. During prosecution,
the examiner, who is specifically trained to evaluate the validity of patent claims over prior art, cited

u.s. Patent No.6,

792,124 and 6,707,922 (both issued to Tilbury et al.) [the ", 124 patent" and '''922

patent" respectively].

[See Burton Decl., Exhs. K and L.] Figures 3 and 5 of the ' 124 patent are

strikingly similar to the Hub reference, as shown below:

earphones being used in connection with a hooded garment.

Further, the '922 patent teaches
[See Burton Decl., at Ex. L.] The

teachings of these references, alone, render the Hub references duplicative, and even less relevant,
that the art already overcome by the claims of the ' 192 patent during prosecution.

Further,

Defendants must demonstrate invalidity by clear and convincing evidence, a much higher burden than
what the patent examiner had to demonstrate to reject the claims during prosecution of the' 192
patent. Thus, the Hub references are incapable of invalidating claim 1, or any other claim, ofthe ' 192
patent.
Indeed, during prosecution of the' 192 patent, the patent examiner concluded that allowance
of the claims of the ' 192 patent over the ' 124 and ' 922 patents, among other cited references, was
appropriate because:
Claim 1 discloses the unique feature of having a conductive wire slideable through the
passageway, and acting as a drawstring for a hooded garment. The closest prior art
fails to teach a slideable conductive wire that acts as a drawstring for a hood.
[Burton Decl., Exh. M.]
Neither the prior art cited during the prosecution of the' 192 patent nor any of the prior art
that Defendants have identified, including the O'Neil Hub jacket, have this unique feature.

Absent

Defendants' ability to identify this feature in the prior art, Defendants have failed to raise substantial
questions of invalidity, and Plaintiffs have thus satisfied their burden of proving a likelihood of success
on the merits with respect to the issue of validity.
B.

PLAINTIFFS WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM IF DEFENDANTS
ARE NOT PRELIMINARILY RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED

Defendants' infringement during the pendency of this case will cause Plaintiffs to suffer
irreparable harm. In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the Court is to assess
irreparable harm using "traditional principles of equity." See eBay Inc. v.MercExchange, L.L.c., 547

388, 393-94 (2006); see also id at 395 (Roberts, C.J., concurring); id. at 396 (Kennedy, J.,

concurring).
As indicated above, it is well settled that the right to exclude is at the heart of a patent grant
and that post-litigation monetary damages may never adequately compensate the loss of this right.
Hybritech, 849 F.2d at 1456-57. Generally, a court cannot erase the effects that the presence of an
infringing product has had in distorting the marketplace in the infringer's favor:
Competitors change the marketplace. Years after infringement has begun, it may be
impossible to restore a patentee's ... exclusive position by an award of damages and
a permanent injunction. Customers may have established relationships with infringers.
The market is rarely the same when a market of multiple sellers is suddenly converted
to one with a single seller by legal fiat.
Polymer Techs., Inc. v. Bridwell, 103 F.3d 970, 975-76 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
Courts historically have recognized that continued infringement during the course oflitigation
can result in numerous irreparable harms. Such harms include the patentee's or his licensee's loss of
market share, revenue, goodwill, sales, business opportunities and relationships with customers, price
erosion, and the infringer's corresponding ability to obtain market opportunities and develop
customer relationships with infringing technology.

See, e.g., Ebay, 547 U.S. at 395 (customers

establishing relationships with the infringer); Abbot Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc., 544 F.3d 1341, 1361-62
(Fed. Cir. 2008) (patentee's loss of market share, revenue, market opportunities, goodwill, and price
erosion are irreparable); Hybritech, 849 F.2d at 1456 (patentee's loss of opportunities to use patent
rights to establish market position and create business relationships).
These forms of irreparable harm have already occurred or are imminent in this case. It is
impossible to foresee and compensate monetarily the long-term effects of Defendants' infringement if
Defendants are not preliminarily enjoined.
1.

Loss Of Market Share And Customer Relationships

Plaintiffs stand to irreparably lose a significant portion of the market if Defendants are not
enjoined. Presently, Jerry Leigh is selling Infringing Products to a wide variety of retail outlets, some
of which are named as defendants in this case. Whereas Lowdown's release of its products covered
by the' 192 patent is imminent but has not yet occurred [Zhou Decl., ~ 5,] Jerry Leigh's current sale

ofInfringing Products is snatching up the market for these products before the rightful owner of this
technology has placed its product on the market. This preemptory strike by Defendants is the source
of numerous irreparable harms.
For example, Defendants are obtaining the benefit and allure of introducing a new, unique and
innovative product.

The prestige of being the first to introduce a new product for the first time

carries a mystique for both retailers and consumers that enhances the ability to sell the product.
[Zhou Decl., ~ 7.] One of the most significant competitive advantages in the clothing and apparel
industry is to be the first and only supplier of a new product. [Id] A product may be a huge success
or an abysmal failure depending on how the product is marketed and to whom it is marketed upon its
release. [Id]

Once a product has been introduced to a particular distributor or retailer, a second-

comer marketing a comparable product is at a significant disadvantage because the product has lost
its mystique in the eyes of distributors and retailers that have already been previously pitched on the
product.

[Id]

Thus, it is much more difficult for second-comers in this industry to secure

distribution and retail space for its products as compared to the entity that first introduces a product.
[Id]

Further, marketing a product to a low-price or discount retailer may affect the image of the

product such that high-end retailers will no longer carry the product. [Id]

There is also significant

leverage in being the sole source of a new product. Those advantages rightfully belong to Plaintiffs as
the holders of the patent rights, not Defendants. The loss of these competitive advantages, prestige,
reputation as the innovator, and mystique cannot be quantified or compensated with money damages.

Defendants, and Jerry Leigh in particular, are also establishing relationships with distributors
and retailers to carry the infringing products before Plaintiffs have an opportunity to compete for
those relationships.

Indeed, Defendants have launched a massive advertising campaign and are

flooding the market with its Infringing Products.

[Zhou Decl., ~ 8.] Once Jerry Leigh and other

Defendants establish relationships to distribute and sell products infringing the ' 192 patent, it will
difficult and expensive, if not impossible, for Plaintiffs to establish relationships with those entities for

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY

Case 2:10-cv-00829-TC -SA Document 5

the distribution of its patented products.

[Id]

Filed 08/20/10 Page 19 of 22

The loss of these ongoing relationships is an

irreparable loss, not compensable by money damages. [Id]
2.

Price Erosion

Defendants are also eroding the price that Plaintiffs can charge for their patented products.
Defendants are currently setting the price point for the Infringing Products before Plaintiffs have
entered the market with their patented products. As the Federal Circuit has long held, once infringers
have set a price point for a particular product and established that price in the minds of consumers,
the market is changed and it can be impossible for the rightful patent holder to later raise the price of
those products. See Polymer Techs., 103 F.3d at 975-76.
The clothing and apparel industry is also incredibly price sensitive. [Zhou Decl., ~ 9.] Once a
price for a product in this industry has been established in the minds of distributors, retailers, and/or
consumers, it is virtually impossible to later sell that product at an increased price. [Id] Products in
this industry typically garner the highest prices when they are first introduced, and then the price
decreases over time. [Id]

Thus, the first entity to introduce a product typically secures a higher

profit per product than subsequent competitors selling comparable products.

[Id]

Additionally,

because these types of products are so price sensitive, a company paying even a modest royalty on a
product is at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to other parties that are not paying a
royalty. [Id] For the products covered by the' 192 patent at issue in this Action, the royalty paid per
product by Lowdown can be the difference in securing or losing a contract, and if a contract is
secured, can represent a significant percentage of the net profit on that product for Lowdown. [Id]
Thus, even in cases where Lowdown is able to secure contracts to distribute and sell its products
covered by the ' 192 patent, it will have significantly less resources to put back into additional
advertisements, marketing and sales activity to generate additional sales of its patented products as
compared to those who are not paying a royalty. [Id] Because the loss of these profits trickles down
and impacts future sales of the product, it is not possible to ascertain or quantify the total impact this
competitive disadvantage will have on the ultimate sales figures for Lowdown's patented products.

Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be irreparably harmed if Defendants are allowed to
continue to sell Infringing Products. The loss caused by this usurpation of rights cannot be calculated
and is not subject to being compensated with money damages.
C.

THE BALANCE OF THE HARDSHIPS FAVORS PLAINTIFFS

The balance of hardships in this case favors Plaintiffs. LL&L and Lowdown have both
invested significantly in the technology claimed in the' 192 patent. For example, Lowdown has paid
valuable consideration in exchange for a license to practice the' 192 patent. In contrast, Defendants
have merely copied the' 192 patent, used the unique technology claimed therein to compete unfairly
and interfere with the Plaintiffs' potential business opportunities, and have done so without the
financial burden of paying for the patent rights.
Plaintiffs' clear showing of a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim
against Defendants and the irreparable harm Plaintiffs face from Defendants' ability to market their
Infringing Products during this litigation strongly tips the equities in the Plaintiffs' favor. "The
magnitude of the threatened injury to the patent owner is weighed, in the light of the strength of the
showing of likelihood of success on the merits, against the injury to the accused infringer if the
preliminary decision is in error." H.H. Robertson Co. v. United Steel Deck, Inc., 820 F.2d 384,390
(Fed. Cir. 1987) (overruled by Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967 (Fed. Cir. 1995)
on other grounds).

"In instances where the patent owner will suffer diminution in the value of its

patent, the balance of hardships weighs in the owner's favor." Everett Labs., Inc. v. Breckenridge
Pharm., Inc., 573 F. Supp.2d 855, 870 (D.N.I. 2008).
Moreover, to the extent the facts concerning this factor are close between the Plaintiff and
Defendants (which is not the case for the reasons shown above), the law requires that this factor be
resolved in Plaintiffs' favor. In other words, the Court does not need to find that the balance of
hardships clearly tips in Plaintiffs' favor to grant an injunction. See Hybritech, 849 F.2d at 1457-58
(affirming preliminary injunction where district court "considered the balance of hardships between
the parties and concluded that 'neither party has a clear advantage"').

The Court needs only find that

the balance does not tip decidedly in Defendants' favor. See id. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has

INJUNCTION

affirmed the grant of a preliminary injunction even when the injunction threatened to put the alleged
infringer out of business. See, e.g., Bell & Howell, 132 F.3d at 708 ("[T]he fact that [the defendant]
is 'small' and could be put out of business if a preliminary injunction issues does not insulate it from
the issuance of a preliminary injunction if the other three preliminary injunction factors are sufficient
to tip the scale in [the patentee's] favor[.]"). Here, Defendants are large and all sell numerous other
products that do not infringe the' 192 patent and will not be in danger of going out of business should
a preliminary injunction issue.
In this case, the equities clearly favor the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs have
described how Defendants' exploitation of Plaintiffs' patented technology has and will continue to
result in irremediable loss of some or all of the market opportunities arising from Plaintiffs' position in
the market. The continued marketing and sale of Defendants' Infringing Products, which Defendants
presumably expended little to no resources to design or develop, greatly diminishes Plaintiffs' ability
to reap the rewards of its investment in innovative technology.
Any harm to Defendants resulting from the issuance of a preliminary injunction is
comparatively slight compared to that which Plaintiffs have and will continue to suffer if a preliminary
injunction is not granted.
D.

THE PUBLIC
DEFENDANTS

INTEREST

WILL

BE

SERVED

BY

ENJOINING

The fourth factor, "public interest," also weighs in Plaintiffs' favor. The fundamental purpose
of the patent grant, and its right to exclude, provides the desired motivation for inventors to invest in
socially desirable innovations. Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 470 F.3d 1368, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir.
2006). An injunction does no more than protect that vital societal interest. Pfizer, Inc. v. Teva
Pharms., USA, Inc., 429 F.3d 1364, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("[a] preliminary injunction that enforces a
valid patent against an infringer' does no more than further public policy inherent in the patent laws
designed to encourage useful inventions by rewarding the inventor with a limited period of market
exclusivity. ", (citation omitted.)).

Indeed, failure to issue preliminary injunctive relief against an

infringer transgresses that interest. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. v. SaraLee Corp., 743 F. Supp. 1326,
1333 (W.D. Wis. 1990).
In this case, Lowdown has obtained the requisite permission in the form of a license to make
and sell products covered by the' 192 patent. Lowdown has paid valuable consideration in exchange
for that permission.

Defendants, on the other hand, are attempting to exploit the benefits of

technology to which they contributed nothing and that they are not entitled to use. Failure to enjoin
such conduct diminishes the incentives that innovators rely upon to continue serving the public with
beneficial technological contributions.
An infringer can overcome the strong public interest in protecting intellectual property rights
in the rare case in which "some critical public interest" exists "that would be injured by the grant of
preliminary relief'-for

example, where granting the injunction would, by precluding sales of

infringing products, adversely impact the public health or welfare. See Hybritech, 849 F.2d at 1458.
The circumstances here, however, do not present such a rare case.
III.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant its motion for a

temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction and enjoin Defendants from infringing the' 192
patent by making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing Infringing Products.
