Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00963 (RMU)

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (“CREW”) brought this
lawsuit under the Federal Records Act (“FRA”) after it was denied access to agency records that
were created by agency employees using outside email accounts. The U.S. Department of
Education (“Education”) has now moved to dismiss this FRA count, arguing that plaintiff lacks
standing to sue.
Defendant’s Motion is premised on a mis-characterization of Education’s actual practices
with respect to employees’ use of personal emails to conduct official business as well as a mischaracterization of governing case law and it application here. Contrary to its assertions in
support of this motion, Education employees twice told CREW’s counsel that they sometimes
use private email addresses to conduct official business and that this issue had arisen in the past
in the context of other FOIA requests. See Declaration of Dan Roth, CREW Counsel (“Roth
Decl.”) at ¶ 9. At no time did defendant ever claim that the issue regarding the use of personal
email accounts referred to outside consultants, vendors, publishers, or members of the public, as

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

the agency now claims. Id. at ¶ 10.
Not only is Education’s re-invention of the facts in order to skirt its responsibilities under
the FRA incredible (if not deeply disturbing), but its claim that the issue of whether an
organization such as CREW that seeks access to government records under FOIA has standing to
file litigation under the FRA is a question never before decided by the Court is patently
incorrect. CREW’s injury is precisely the type of injury alleged by organizational plaintiffs
found to have standing in a number of cases, including American Friends Service Committee v.
Webster, 720 F.2d 29, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1983), on which defendant relies. Nor is there any merit in
defendant’s claim that CREW is solely responsible for its claimed injuries. CREW’s injury is a
direct result of Education’s conduct: the agency failed to provide information responsive to
CREW’s FOIA request because of the agency’s failure to preserve and store the information for
retrieval and processing through the FOIA process.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On March 28, 2007, CREW sent a FOIA request to Education seeking records, regardless
of format and including electronic records and information, of communications and other
contacts concerning the Reading First Program from January 21, 2001 to the present, including
communications between Education employees and the White House, educational publishers,
and documents previously disclosed under the FOIA to Andrew Brownstein, Travis Hicks and/or
the Title I Monitor. Complaint, ¶ 15 and Exhibit A to Roth Decl., ¶ 2.
On May 9, 2007, at the suggestion of Education Supervisory IT Specialist Angela
Arrington, CREW’s counsel Daniel C. Roth participated in a conference call with Education
employees to discuss CREW’s FOIA request. Roth Decl. at ¶¶ 6-7. Education officials --

including representatives from the agency’s FOIA office, its Office of the General Counsel and
its Office of Elementary and Secondary Education -- advised Mr. Roth that the agency could not
search for email pertaining to any particular subject matter without having the identity of a
specific recipient or sender. Id. In addition, Education official Marcella Goodridge advised Mr.
Roth that Education personnel “often use private email addresses” and that Education “wouldn’t
have access to that.” Id. at ¶ 9. Education officials confirmed that agency personnel use private
email accounts for official business and that this issue had arisen in the past in the context of
other FOIA requests. Id.
During this same conference call, Mr. Roth suggested that Education employees’ use of
private email accounts to conduct official business would violate the Federal Records Act. Roth
Decl. at ¶ 9. At no time did any of the Education officials assert that Education employees did
not use private email accounts in order to conduct official business or suggest that Mr. Roth’s
understanding was incorrect. Id. at ¶ 10.
Mr. Roth also discussed and raised issues concerning Education’s denial of CREW’s fee
waiver request. Id. at ¶ 11. He was then asked to draft an informal appeal of Education’s fee
waiver denial, which he prepared and sent by email to Ms. Arrington on May 11, 2007. Id.
In a follow-up telephone call on May 14, 2007, Ms. Arrington confirmed to Mr. Roth that
Education employees sometimes use private email addresses to conduct official business, that
such material would not be included in the agency’s response to CREW’s FOIA request and that
this issue had come up in the past. Roth Decl. at ¶ 14. Mr. Roth then sent an email to Ms.
Arrington memorializing his conversation with her. Id. Mr. Roth further confirmed in his
confirming email that “email communications on personal email accounts would not be covered

3

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Filed 08/24/2007

Page 4 of 13

by such a search [subject matter or keyword search] (which is an issue that has arisen in the
past).” Id. Mr. Roth did not receive any response to his email, nor did Ms. Arrington dispute his
understanding of Education employees’ use of personal email accounts to conduct official
business. Id. at ¶ 15.
Mr. Roth’s email further requested that Education provide CREW with an estimate of
time it would take to process the FOIA request as drafted and a second estimate as to the time it
would take to process the same request within only the Office of the Secretary and Office of
Elementary and Secondary Education. Roth Decl. at ¶ 15. Mr. Roth requested that he be
notified if the estimate could not be completed before May 19, 2007. Id. He never received a
response to his email. Id.
In light of this information, on May 15, 2007, CREW sent a letter to Education’s
Inspector General, requesting that he commence an immediate investigation “to assess the extent
and duration” of Education’s practice of using outside email accounts to conduct official
business, “the amount of official correspondence that has been lost or destroyed, and the effect of
this practice on all records requests to the Department of Education.” Complaint, ¶ 18. CREW’s
letter also pointed out that in addition to CREW’s FOIA request, reporters have also been
requesting agency documents under the FOIA, as has Rep. George Miller, Chairman of the
House Committee on Education and Labor. Id. at ¶ 19.
On May 21, 2007, having not received a response to his May 14, 2007 email requesting
time estimates of various searches, Mr. Roth sent Ms. Arrington an email acknowledging
Education’s technological search limitations and proposing a narrowed search. Roth Decl. at ¶
17. Specifically, Mr. Roth narrowed the scope of FOIA request Item I from the entire

4

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Filed 08/24/2007

Page 5 of 13

Department to a list of 14 of the 33 offices listed on Education’s online Coordinating Structure
Chart. Id. at ¶ 18. Mr. Roth chose these offices based on his judgment of where records
responsive to CREW’s FOIA request might be located. Id.
In addition, FOIA request Item I sought records mentioning or relating to several
enumerated reading programs and terms and “any other issue related to reading instruction or
education.” Exhibit A to Complaint. In response to concerns raised by Education officials
during the May 9, 2007 conference call, Mr. Roth narrowed this item further by deleting that
phrase and requesting records related to “Early Reading First” and “Science-Based Reading
Research.” Roth Decl. at ¶ 19.
Also in response to the agency’s concerns expressed on May 9, 2007, Mr. Roth narrowed
Items ii and iii of CREW’s FOIA request for contacts with and regarding all educational
publishers to an enumerated list of seven publishers. Id. at ¶ 20.
By letter dated June 8, 2007, Ms. Cueva notified CREW that its fee waiver request had
been denied. Id. at ¶ 22. On June 21, 2007, CREW appealed the fee waiver denial. Id.
Education never responded to CREW’s narrowing proposal set forth in Mr. Roth’s letter
of May 21, 2007. Roth Decl. at ¶ 23.
STATUTORY BACKGROUND
The Federal Records Act
The FRA is a series of statutes that govern the creation, management and disposal of
federal records. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2118, 3101-3107 and 3301-3324. Among other things,
the FRA ensures “[a]ccurate and complete documentation of the policies and transactions of the
Federal Government,” as well as “judicious preservation and disposal of records.” 44 U.S.C. §

5

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Filed 08/24/2007

Page 6 of 13

2902.
To fulfill this purpose, the FRA requires the head of each agency to “make and preserve
records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies,
decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency.” Id. at § 3101. Under the
statute, each agency must also “establish and maintain an active, continuing program for the
economical and efficient management of the records of the agency,” id. at § 3102, and must
“establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records” the agency head determines are
necessary and required by regulations of the Archivist. Id. at § 3105.
The FRA also prescribes the exclusive mechanism for the disposal of federal records,
which it defines to include:
all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable
materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics,
made or received by an agency of the United States
Government under Federal law or in connection with
the transaction of public business and preserved or
appropriate for preservation by that agency . . as evidence
of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures
operations, or other activities of the Government or because
of the informational value of data in them.
44 U.S.C. § 3301. No records may be “alienated or destroyed” except pursuant to the disposal
provisions of the FRA. Id. at § 3314.
An agency wishing to dispose of records must first submit to the archivist either lists of
records the agency head determines “are not needed by it in the transaction of its current
business,” 44 U.S.C. § 303a(2), or “schedules proposing the disposal after the lapse of specified
periods of time of records of a specified form or character” that the agency head determines will
not have “sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their further

preservation by the Government.” Id. at § 3303a(3). Upon receipt of such a request, the
archivist must issue a notice requesting public comment on the agency’s proposal and the
archivists’s staff must conduct its own assessment of the value of the records the agency is
proposing to destroy. Id. at § 3303a(a). The archivist is free to accept or reject an agency’s
proposal. Id.
ARGUMENT
I.

CREW HAS STANDING TO BRING THIS FRA LAWSUIT CHALLENGING
EDUCATION’S FAILURE TO PRESERVE AGENCY RECORDS RESPONSIVE
TO CREW’S FOIA REQUESTS.
To invoke the Court’s jurisdiction under Article III standing of the Constitution, a

plaintiff must demonstrate, as an “irreducible constitutional minimum,” Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), an injury-in-fact that is “fairly traceable” to the challenged
act and “likely to be redressed by the requested relief.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751
(1984). CREW’s injury, an inability to obtain through the FOIA information necessary to
accomplish CREW’s mission, is directly traceable to Education’s improper document retention
procedures. Accordingly, CREW has standing to sue here.
A.

Plaintiff’s Injury is Sufficient to Confer Standing

CREW has met its burden of establishing an injury-in-fact for Article III purposes.
CREW is an organization dedicated to informing and educating the public about the conduct of
public officials. Toward that end, CREW uses the FOIA to gather relevant information.
Here, CREW filed a FOIA request with Education for documents that would reflect,
among other things, the degree to which the Reading First Program has been influenced by

7

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Page 8 of 13

political and other outside interests.1 Education’s policy of knowingly permitting agency
employees to use outside email accounts when conducting agency business deprived CREW of
access to documents responsive to its FOIA request but not maintained by Education because
they were not stored on agency servers.
Because of Education’s record-keeping policies, CREW was frustrated in achieving its
mission when it sought and was denied the requested information. Defendant’s refusal to
comply with the requirements of the FRA has hindered CREW’s ability to report and publish
information in furtherance of its programmatic activities.2 Compare Spann v. Colonial Village,
Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“if an organization points to a concrete and demonstrable
injury to its activities . . .the organization passes through the first [standing] gateway”). Article
III requires nothing more.
In arguing to the contrary, defendant misapplies American Friends Service Committee v.
Webster, 720 F.2d 29, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1983), and mis-characterizes CREW as like those plaintiffs
the Webster Court found were “questionable” for standing purposes. In Webster, various
individuals and organizations challenged the FBI’s records destruction program as contrary to
law, including the FRA. Id. The Court in Webster recognized three categories of plaintiffs: (1) a

1

Ironically, Education accuses CREW of seeking documents for “political purposes.”
See e.g. Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss at 11. Defendant’s wholly gratuitous and ad hominem
remarks, however, are not only untrue (CREW is a 501(c)(3) organization and does not engage
in political activity), but have no relevance to the legal question of whether CREW has standing
to sue.
2

As noted in its complaint, CREW uses a combination of research, litigation, advocacy
and public education to expose unethical and illegal conduct by those involved in government.
Complaint ¶ 4. CREW has been “harmed by Education’s failure to comply with the FRA
because that failure has denied CREW access to documents that are a critical part of the record
concerning the Reading First Program.” Id. at ¶ 24.
8

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

group that included individuals and organizations whose need for documents arose out of their
professions, and “had in the past made FOIA requests . . . had other requests pending, and
intended to request FBI files in the future”; (2) a group that consisted of individuals who were
subjects of FBI investigations or alleged victims of FBI activities; and (3) a group that included
organizations seeking to further civil liberties and civil rights who argued that the destruction of
the documents deprived them of research materials that they could disseminate. Id.
Here, Education argues that CREW is most analogous to this third group of plaintiffs.
Unlike this group, however, CREW has made FOIA requests in the past, has FOIA requests
pending with Education, and intends to request documents in the future. This distinction dictates
here, as in Webster, that CREW has standing to bring this FRA lawsuit.
Like the first group of plaintiffs in Webster, CREW uses the documents it seeks through
its FOIA requests, not for political purposes as Education carelessly argues, but to share
information with the public through memoranda, reports, or press releases. See Armstrong v.
Bush, 924 F.2d 282, 288 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (finding plaintiffs that were researchers and historians
who made extensive use of government documents were within the zone of interests of the
records creation and management provisions of the FRA).

For example, on June 27, 2007,

CREW released a report, The Best Laid Plans: The Story of How the Government Ignored its
own Gulf Coast Hurricane Plan, about the problems with the federal government’s response to
Hurricane Katrina victims that relied significantly on documents CREW obtained through a
FOIA request to the Department of State.
CREW has used and will continue to use the FOIA to gain access to agency records that
relate to the propriety of government activity. By adopting a policy whereby Education

9

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Filed 08/24/2007

Page 10 of 13

employees use outside email accounts to conduct official business with the knowledge that
electronic records created as a result of that use were and continue to be sought under the FOIA,
Education has denied CREW access to requested records. This policy is arbitrary, capricious,
and contrary to law because it results in the failure to preserve records containing adequate and
proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential
transactions of the agency. 44 U.S.C. § 3101. And for any future request, CREW is at the
complete mercy of Education’s document policy.
This information sought by CREW has an undeniable effect upon CREW’s ability to
inform and to educate the public, which it does on a continuing, ongoing basis. As frequent
FOIA users, CREW is within the zone of interests of the FRA disposal provisions.
CREW’s organizational interests and allegations of the adverse impact upon its activities
resulting from Education’s actions are not unlike other nonprofit organizations that have been
found to have established the necessary adverse effect for Article III standing. For example, in
Action Alliance of Senior Citizens v. Heckler, 789 F.2d 931 (D.C. Cir. 1986), vacated on other
grounds, 494 U.S. 1001 (1990), the plaintiffs were four organizations that through information,
counseling, referral, and other services endeavored to improve the lives of elderly citizens. Their
complaint challenged both the content of Department of Health and Human Services-specific
regulations and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services’ failure to act on
regulations proposed by other agencies. Id. at 935. The challenged regulations denied the
plaintiff organizations access to information and avenues of redress they wished to use in their
routine information-dispensing, counseling and referral activities. Finding that the plaintiff
organizations adequately alleged inhibition of their daily operations by reason of the agency’s

10

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Page 11 of 13

decisions, the D.C. Circuit stated that “injury in fact will not suffice if it is too speculative, but it
need not be large or intense; an identifiable trifle. . .is sufficient to meet the constitutional
minimum.” Id. at 937 citing United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency
Procedures, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973).
Thus, CREW’s inability to obtain information it seeks through its FOIA request for
Education documents would lead to “concrete damage” to CREW’s mission. Through this
impairment, CREW has met its burden of establishing an injury-in-fact for Article III standing
purposes.
B.

CREW Narrowed its Original FOIA Request While Education Had Already
Begun Processing Its FOIA and is Therefore Not Responsible for its Injury

Education’s attempt to depict CREW as failing to narrow the scope of its FOIA request
and therefore causing its own injury is disingenuous at best, and misleading at worst. Defendant
argues that it is unable to respond to CREW’s FOIA request because CREW failed to narrow the
request. To the contrary, CREW did attempt to narrow its request but never received a response
or other guidance from Education. See Roth Decl. ¶ 23.
Moreover, defendant has begun to process CREW’s request, although it suggests to the
contrary. On the one hand, Education Official Arrington admits that, “by letter dated April 16,
2007, the Department released to the requester, Mr. Daniel C. Roth, Counsel, CREW, a CD
containing 421 pages of documents responsive to item 4 of the March 28, 2007 request.” See
Arrington Decl. ¶ 8. Inexplicable, however, the defendant also contends that “the Department
has not begun to process Plaintiff’s requests for communications between the Department and
educational publishers;”and that “Plaintiff was advised before this lawsuit was filed that the
Department would not begin processing its request until Plaintiff clarified the records sought and
11

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Filed 08/24/2007

Page 12 of 13

resolved the issue of fees.” See Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss at 11-12 (emphasis in original).
This claim, however, is completely at odds with Education’s release to CREW of 421 pages of
responsive documents on April 16, 2007.
Further, Education fails to explain why it never responded to CREW’s attempt to narrow
its FOIA request on May 21, 2007. To cover up its own inaction, Education argues here for the
first time that CREW’s efforts at narrowing were insufficient. This unsubstantiated claim,
however, is not enough to defeat plaintiff’s injury-in-fact. As the record makes clear, CREW
attempted to narrow its FOIA request and properly appealed its fee waiver denial, participated in
a conference call it neither suggested nor directed, followed up after the conference call by
telephone and email in a further attempt to narrow its FOIA request, and ultimately sent a
narrowed FOIA request without any response by the defendant at all. Under these
circumstances, plaintiff’s injury is traceable exclusively to defendant’s conduct.
II.

CREW’s CLAIMS ARE RIPE FOR ADJUDICATION
Finally, Education argues that CREW’s claims are so “shapeless” as to be unripe.

Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss at 13-14. According to the defendant, the current record “is
wholly inadequate for an informed decision.” Id. at 14.
To the contrary, CREW has alleged sufficient facts within its Complaint for the Court to
make an informed decision about Education’s violation of the FRA. These allegations regarding
Education’s arbitrary, capricious and illegal policy relate to agency employees’ use of outside
email accounts to conduct official business with the result that Education is not preserving
agency records. See Complaint, ¶¶ 16-17. As such, CREW’s claims are not based on
“contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,” nor

12

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 10

Filed 08/24/2007

Page 13 of 13

are they based on some “abstract disagreements” of policy. See Worth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d 854,
861 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The allegations in CREW’s Complaint which are detailed and specific
enough for the Court to ascertain the contours for purposes of judicial review, are based on
Education’s articulated policy and its inability to produce documents responsive to CREW’s
FOIA as a direct result of that policy.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, CREW respectfully requests that the Court deny defendants’
motion to dismiss.
Respectfully submitted,
