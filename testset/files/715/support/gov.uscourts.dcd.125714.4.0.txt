Case No. 1:07CV00963-RMU

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (“Plaintiff”), filed this
action under the Federal Records Act (“FRA”) to challenge as arbitrary and capricious a
Department of Education “policy” that does not exist. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that
Department policy authorizes agency employees to use outside, personal email accounts to
conduct official business and to dispose of such emails without complying with the agency’s
approved records disposition schedule. That erroneous contention is based on Plaintiff’s
misconstruing certain guidance the Department provided on narrowing an overbroad request
Plaintiff submitted pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). That request seeks all
communications between the Department and any educational publisher or White House staff.
Plaintiff was advised that the Department could not process that request in part because, without
specific names, its search could not capture communications that publishers sent from personal
email accounts. Plaintiff transformed that explanation into the non-existent Department policy
challenged here. The Department, however, has never had a policy authorizing its employees to

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 4

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 2 of 17

conduct government business on personal email accounts. This action, which purports to
challenge that policy, is therefore completely unfounded.
However, without even reaching that issue, this Court should dismiss this action for lack
of jurisdiction. Even if the challenged policy did exist – and it emphatically does not – Plaintiff
lacks standing to bring this action under the FRA. Without deciding the issue, courts in this
Circuit have indicated that it is “questionable” whether an organization such as Plaintiff that
claims to need access to government records under FOIA has standing under the FRA. This case
now squarely presents that question and this Court should rule that such organizations do not.
Even if this Court concludes otherwise, Plaintiff here lacks standing because it has not
alleged a cognizable injury. Plaintiff’s only allegation of injury is that it has been “denied a right
of access to information in the public interest,” specifically, emails responsive to its FOIA
request. That alleged injury, however, is not the result of the agency conduct challenged here but
of Plaintiff’s failure to narrow its FOIA request and Plaintiff’s appeal of the denial of its fee
waiver request. Since Plaintiff has not suffered any injury as a result of the challenged conduct,
Plaintiff lacks standing.
Alternatively, this Court should dismiss this action as unripe. Since the Department is
unable to process Plaintiff’s FOIA request for reasons unrelated to the agency’s record retention
practices, Plaintiff can only speculate that records responsive to that request are affected by the
policy alleged in this action. This Court thus would be ruling on a matter involving, at best, a
hypothetical controversy between the parties. Article III precludes the Court from doing so. This
action accordingly should be dismissed.

STATUTORY BACKGROUND
The Federal Records Act sets forth agency requirements for records creation,
management, and disposal. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 2901, et seq., 3101, et seq., 3301, et seq.
Specifically, the Act requires agencies to establish standards and procedures intended to promote
“[a]ccurate and complete documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal
Government,” “[c]ontrol of the quantity and quality of records produced by the Federal
Government,” “[s]implification of the activities, systems, and processes of records creation and
of records maintenance and use,” and “[j]udicious preservation and disposal of records.” 44
U.S.C. § 2902(1), (2), (4), (5). The Archivist “shall provide guidance and assistance to Federal
agencies . . . to ensur[e] adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of
the Federal Government and ensur[e] proper records disposition.” 44 U.S.C. § 2904.
Towards those ends, agencies are required to “make and preserve records containing
adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, and essential transactions of the agency.” 44 U.S.C. § 3101. Each agency must
establish “controls over the creation and . . . maintenance and use” of such records and establish
safeguards against their unauthorized removal or loss. 44 U.S.C. §§ 3102, 3105. Every agency
head must submit to the Archivist a list of records in the agency’s custody and proposed
schedules for their disposal after specified lapses of time. See 44 U.S.C. § 3303. The disposal
schedules are published for notice and comment and thereafter must be approved by the Archivist
before records may be disposed pursuant to them. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3303, 3303a. Federal
records may only be destroyed pursuant to disposition schedules approved by the Archivist. See
44 U.S.C. §§ 3303, 3303a.

If an agency head becomes aware of “any actual, impending, or threatened unlawful
removal, defacing, alteration, or destruction of [agency] records,” the agency head, with the
assistance of the Archivist, “shall initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of
the records he knows or has reason to believe have been unlawfully removed from his agency.”
44 U.S.C. § 3106. If the Archivist learns of such actual or threatened unlawful activity, he must
notify the agency head and, if the agency head fails to take action to recover the records or seek
other redress within a reasonable time, the Archivist shall request that the Attorney General
initiate such an action. See 44 U.S.C. § 2905.
STATEMENT OF FACTS1
On March 28, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the Department of Education
seeking four broad categories of documents:
(1) “All communications from any Department office . . . to, from, or referencing
any member of the White House staff . . . that mention or relate to Reading First,
‘Science Based Reading Research’/‘SBRR,’ DIBELS, or any other issue related to
reading instruction or education”;
(2) “All Department contacts or communications . . . with educational publishers,
their executives, employees, consultants, or contractors”;
(3) “All Department contacts or communications that mention or relate to contacts
with educational publishers, their executives, or employees”; and
(4) “[A]ll documents previously disclosed under FOIA to Andrew Brownstein,
Travis Hicks and/or the Title I Monitor.

1

The Statement of Facts is based on the allegations in the Complaint and the attached
Declaration of Angela Arrington (“Arrington Decl,”), which this Court properly may consider in
ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. See National Community Reinvestment
Coalition v. National Credit Union Admin., 290 F. Supp. 2d 124, 131 (D.D.C. 2003) (“In
resolving a Rule 12(b)(1) motion for lack of jurisdiction . . . courts are generally free to consider
relevant materials outside the pleadings.”).

Compl. Ex. A. Plaintiff requested that the fees associated with processing its request be waived.
See Compl. Ex. A.
Department personnel, upon receiving Plaintiff’s request, reviewed it and determined that
it did “not reasonably describe the records sought” and therefore could not be processed as
written. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 7. Plaintiff’s request, for example, did not specify the names of
Department or White House personnel or publishing company employees whose communications
were sought. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 7. A search for records with “White House” or a publisher’s
name would be unduly burdensome and overly broad. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 7.
By letter dated April 16, 2007, the Department acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff’s FOIA
request and enclosed a CD responsive to item (4) of Plaintiff’s request containing documents
“previously disclosed under FOIA to the Title I Monitor.” See Arrington Decl. Ex. B. The letter
went on to explain that the Department needed “clarification for items 1 through 3 of [Plaintiff’s]
request” which “encompass a large volume of information on broad topics related to individuals
in the Department and ‘White House staff,’ without identifying specific individuals, offices, or
subjects.” Arrington Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. B. Plaintiff was advised that “the Department is unable to
process your request regarding items 1 through 3 without further clarification.” Arrington Decl.
¶ 8 & Ex. B. The letter also informed Plaintiff that its fee waiver request had been denied
because Plaintiff had not demonstrated entitlement to a waiver under FOIA. See Arrington Decl.
¶ 8. The Department therefore did not begin processing Plaintiff’s request. See Arrington Decl.
¶¶ 5c & 8.

At Plaintiff’s request, agency personnel participated in a teleconference with Plaintiff to
discuss its FOIA request. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9. Plaintiff did not understand why the
Department could not process its request as written and apparently was under the misimpression
that the Department had centralized electronic search capabilities. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9a. In
an effort to correct that misimpression, the teleconference participants explained that to fulfill
Plaintiff’s request for “[a]ll Department . . . communications . . . with educational publishers,
their executives, employees, consultants, or contractors,” every Department employee’s email
account would have to be searched “one at a time.” See Arrington Decl. ¶¶ 6 & 9a. Plaintiff
was further advised that, even assuming the Department had the resources to conduct such a
broad search, the agency could not capture all such communications because without individual
names, the Department could not identify publishers’ “executives, employees, consultants, or
contractors . . . [that] chose to contact Department employees using private e-mail accounts.”
See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9c. Plaintiff inquired what it needed to do to sufficiently narrow its request
and was advised to review the request in light of the discussion. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9.
By email dated May 14, 2007, Plaintiff confirmed its understanding of the May 9, 2007
discussion on narrowing its FOIA request as follows:
the Department’s FOIA technology does not allow for subject matter or keyword
searches throughout the email system, so a search undertaken pursuant to the
original terms of our request would require individual searches of each of the
Department’s approximately 4,500 employee email accounts. Additionally, . . .
email communications on personal email accounts would not be covered by such
a search2 . . . .

2

This statement evidently is the source of Plaintiff’s confusion. Plaintiff was actually
told that “it is not unheard of for members of the public to contact Department employees using
private e-mail accounts” and that without individual names, the Department would not be able to
capture such communications in its search. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 9c.

See Arrington Decl. Ex. D. Plaintiff also renewed its request for a copy of the FOIA request
submitted by Title I Monitor. See Arrington Decl. Ex. D. Plaintiff indicated that it would
“formalize any narrowing language in a letter to the Department.” See Arrington Decl. Ex. D.
Plaintiff’s purportedly narrowed FOIA request sought from fourteen identified Department
offices, “[a]ll communications . . . [with] White House staff . . . that mention or relate to Reading
First, Early Reading First, ‘Scientifically Based Reading Research’/‘Science Based Reading
Research’/‘SBRR’ or DIBELS” and “all communications” with employees of Houghton Mifflin,
SRA/McGraw Hill, Pearson Scott Foresman, Voyager, Cambium Learning, Sopris West, and
Intellitools. See Arrington Decl. Ex. E. However, Plaintiff provided only two publishing
company employees by name. See Arrington Decl. Ex. E. Plaintiff also added a request for all
communications that mention or relate to an additional program, Early Reading First. See
Arrington Decl. Ex. E. Otherwise, “all other language in [Plaintiff’s] original request []
remain[ed] unchanged.” See Arrington Decl. Ex. E.
On May 15, 2007, Plaintiff sent a letter to the Department’s Inspector General requesting
that his office commence an investigation into “the extent to which Department of Education
employees have been using non-governmental e-mail accounts for official business.” Compl. Ex.
B. The letter speculated that “[i]f [] employees are regularly using private email accounts to send
official email and the Department neither tracks nor stores such email . . . the Department . . . is
likely operating in violation of the Federal Records Act.” Compl. Ex. B. A week later, Plaintiff
filed the instant action alleging that the Department had violated the FRA by failing to preserve
and properly dispose of records allegedly created pursuant to the “policy of Education to permit
agency employees to use outside email accounts to conduct official business.” Compl. ¶¶ 23, 27.

ARGUMENT
Plaintiff’s claims under the FRA are predicated on a “policy” that does not exist. This
Court, however, need not reach that issue because Plaintiff has improperly invoked this Court’s
jurisdiction. “The ‘judicial power’ of the United States . . . is not an unconditioned authority”
but is limited by Article III of the Constitution. Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans
United for Separation of Church & State, 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). That Article “confines the
federal courts to adjudicating actual ‘cases’ and ‘controversies.’” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,
750 (1984). In the absence of an actual case or controversy, the Court is without jurisdiction to
decide the case. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975); see also Poe v. Ullman, 367
U.S. 497, 502 (1961). Thus, a court must ensure that its authority is invoked where there is “a
lively conflict between antagonistic demands, actively pressed, which make resolution of the
controverted issue a practical necessity,” (id. at 503) – a requirement “founded in concern about
the proper – and properly limited – role of the courts in a democratic society,” (Warth, 422 U.S.
at 498). Otherwise, “the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public
significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the
questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.”
Id. at 500.
In an effort to give meaning to Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement, “courts have
developed a series of principles termed ‘justiciability doctrines,’ among which are standing,
ripeness, mootness, and the political question doctrine.” National Treas. Employees Union v.
United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1996). These doctrines consist of both “prudential

-8-

Page 9 of 17

elements which Congress is free to override and core component[s] which are essential and
unchanging part[s] of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.” Id. (internal quotations
omitted). This action implicates core components of that requirement – standing and ripeness –
whose absence requires dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.
I.

THIS COURT SHOULD DISMISS THIS ACTION BECAUSE PLAINTIFF
LACKS STANDING.
This action should be dismissed for lack of standing. A plaintiff’s standing is a

“predicate to any exercise of [this Court’s] jurisdiction.” Florida Audubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94
F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Standing is “an essential and unchanging part of the case-orcontroversy requirement.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The
requirements of standing are well established. See id. at 560-61. “[A plaintiff] must show injury
in fact that was caused by the conduct of the defendants and that can be redressed by judicial
relief.” Public Citizen, Inc. v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. __ F.3d __, 2007 WL
1713334, at *7 (D.C. Cir., June 15, 2007). The absence of any one of these elements is sufficient
to dismiss a claim on standing grounds. See US Ecology, Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Interior,
231 F.3d 20, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“a deficiency on any one of the three [elements] suffices to
defeat standing”). Indeed, “[u]ntil a judicially cognizable injury is shown no other inquiry is
relevant to consideration of [] standing.” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop War, 418 U.S.
208, 227 n.16 (1974). Dismissal is required here because Plaintiff has not alleged a cognizable
injury.

Plaintiff’s Alleged Injury Is Insufficient to Confer Standing.

Plaintiff’s only alleged injury is a “denied [] right of access to information in the public
interest, including evidence of how Education has implemented the Reading First program.”
Compl. ¶ 28; see also Compl. ¶ 24. This case squarely presents a question left open in prior FRA
cases, namely, whether such an injury is sufficient for standing purposes. Courts in this Circuit
have suggested that its sufficiency is “questionable.” See American Friends Serv. Comm. v.
Webster, 720 F.2d 29, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1983); American Friends Serv. Comm. v. Webster, 485 F.
Supp. 222, 227 (D.D.C. 1980). In Webster, three categories of plaintiffs brought an action to
challenge the FBI’s record destruction program. One category of plaintiffs included
“organizations whose goals and purposes are alleged to require access to the files and records of
the FBI in order to enable them to disseminate information for organizational, educational, and
political purposes.” Id. These plaintiffs claimed that if the FBI’s files were destroyed, “they
w[ould] be deprived of raw material for primary research in the areas of their activities.” Id. The
district court regarded that claimed injury as “questionable” for standing purposes. Id. However,
because the other plaintiffs had adequately shown injury for standing purposes, the district court
concluded that it was “not necessary to decide that question.” Id. In the subsequent appeal, the
D.C. Circuit also refrained from deciding that question “[s]ince the district court based its finding
of standing only on the injuries . . . [of the other] groups of plaintiffs.” Webster, 720 F.2d at 282.
Thus, it is “unsettled whether the requisite injury-in-fact standard is met by a claim that
government documents, earmarked for destruction, are needed for organizational political
purposes.” Webster, 485 F. Supp. at 227.

-10-

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Document 4

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 11 of 17

Even if that injury is sufficient for standing purposes, Plaintiff cannot make that claim
here because of the status of Plaintiff’s FOIA request. The Department has not begun to process
Plaintiff’s requests for communications between the Department and White House staff
concerning the Reading First Program or for communications between the Department and
educational publishers. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 16. Therefore, no determination has been made as
to which Department records are responsive to that request and thus Plaintiff cannot possibly
claim that any documents needed for its political purposes have been earmarked for destruction.
See Arrington Decl. ¶ 17. Plaintiff merely speculates that documents responsive to its request are
not properly being maintained. See Compl. Ex. B. (“If . . . Department of Education employees
are using or have used outside, non-governmental email addresses for government business and
have not retained copies of those records on the Department’s files, the Department is failing to
‘accurate[ly] and complete[ly] document[] the policies and transactions of the Federal
Government’ . . . in violation of the FRA”); id. (“If [] employees are regularly using private email
accounts to send official email and the Department neither tracks nor stores such email . . . the
Department of Education is likely operating in violation of the Federal Records Act”). It is well
established, however, that speculative or hypothetical claims of injury are insufficient to confer
standing. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976)
(“unadorned speculation will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power”). Rather, the
alleged injury “must be certainly impending,” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990)
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and “real and immediate,” City of Los Angeles
v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983). Since Plaintiff’s claimed injury is neither, Plaintiff lacks
standing.

Plaintiff’s Alleged Injury Is Traceable Only to Its Own Failure to Narrow the
Scope of Its FOIA Request and Plaintiff’s Appeal of the Denial of Its Fee
Waiver Request.

Plaintiff alternatively lacks standing because its alleged injury is not caused by the
Department’s alleged unlawful conduct. Standing requires that the alleged injury be “fairly
traceable to the challenged act.” National Treasury, 101 F.3d at 1427. Plaintiff’s alleged injury
is clearly not. Plaintiff “[t]o date [] has not received copies of any emails responsive to its March
28, 2007 FOIA request,” (Compl. ¶ 20), not because of any Department policy permitting the use
of personal email accounts but because the Department is not processing Plaintiff’s overly broad
FOIA request. See Arrington Decl. ¶ 16. Plaintiff was advised before this lawsuit was filed that
the Department would not begin processing its request until Plaintiff clarified the records sought
and resolved the issue of fees. See Compl. ¶ 16 (admitting that “Education officials . . . advised
[Plaintiff] that the agency could not search for email pertaining to any particular subject matter
without having the identity of a specific recipient or sender”); see also Arrington Decl. Ex. B
(“Once we receive your clarification and the issues regarding charges are resolved, we will begin
processing your request.”); id. (“your request does not reasonably describe the records sought,
and the Department is unable to process your request regarding items 1 through 3 without further
clarification”). Plaintiff, however, has done neither. See Arrington Decl. ¶¶ 14, 15, 16.
Although Plaintiff submitted a purportedly narrowed request the day before filing this
action, Plaintiff’s revised request “failed to sufficiently narrow the scope or reasonably describe
the records sought” and therefore remains insufficient for processing under the FOIA. See
Arrington Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. E. Plaintiff was advised by letter dated June 8, 2007 that further
narrowing of its request was required and that Plaintiff’s request for a fee waiver had been

-12-

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Page 13 of 17

denied. See Arrington Decl. Ex. F. Plaintiff has not accepted the Department’s denial of
Plaintiff’s fee waiver request. Indeed, by letter dated June 21, 2007, Plaintiff appealed that
denial. See Arrington Decl. Ex. G. By regulation, as long as Plaintiff’s fee waiver request is
unresolved, “[p]rocessing of the FOIA request is suspended.” See Arrington Decl. ¶ 5c; see also
34 C.F.R. Subtitle A, Part 5 (the Department’s implementing regulations under FOIA). Thus, to
the extent that Plaintiff has suffered any injury at all, it is traceable to its refusal to accept the
denial of its fee waiver request and its failure to submit an appropriately narrow FOIA request.
See Arrington Decl. ¶ 16 (“As [Plaintiff’s] request currently reads, it does not reasonably
describe the records sought and therefore, even upon resolution of the fee dispute, the
Department cannot begin to search for responsive records until the requester clarifies the
request.”). Standing, however, requires that the alleged injury be traceable to the conduct
challenged. Since here it is not, this action should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
II.

THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THIS ACTION BECAUSE PLAINTIFF’S
CLAIM IS UNRIPE.
This Court alternatively should dismiss this action because it is not ripe. The ripeness

doctrine “shares the constitutional requirement of standing that an injury in fact be certainly
impending,” which, as discussed earlier, is not so here. National Treasury, 101 F.3d at 1427.
Prudentially, however, the ripeness doctrine “prevent[s] the courts, through avoidance of
premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.” Worth v.
Jackson, 451 F.3d 854, 861 (D.C. Cir. 2006). By refusing to hear such disagreements, federal
courts “enhance judicial economy, and ensure that a record adequate to support an informed
decision exists when the case is heard.” Navegar, Inc. v. United States, 103 F.3d 994, 998 (D.C.
Cir. 1997). Where, as here, “the dispute is so shapeless that the [C]ourt is necessarily called
-13-

Case 1:07-cv-00963-RMU

Filed 07/23/2007

Page 14 of 17

upon to hypothesize regarding not only the facts of the dispute, but the very ‘policy’ . . . that is
challenged[] such is the [] paradigm of an advisory opinion.” Hotel & Restaurant Employees
Union v. Smith, 846 F.2d 1499, 1517 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Since this Court lacks jurisdiction to
issue such opinions, this action should be dismissed.
Plaintiff effectively concedes that whether the challenged policy – even assuming it
existed – violates the FRA is contingent on whether the Department is properly retaining and
disposing of emails from personal accounts. See Compl. Ex. B (“If [] employees are regularly
using private email accounts to send official email and the Department neither tracks nor stores
such email . . . the Department of Education is likely operating in violation of the Federal
Records Act”). The Complaint, however, fails to provide a factual basis from which the Court
can make that inference. The most Plaintiff can say is that it was advised that “[communications
from private email addresses] would not be included in the agency’s response to [Plaintiff’s]
FOIA request.” Compl. ¶ 17. Thus, the record before the Court is wholly inadequate for an
informed decision. See Navegar, Inc., 103 F.3d at 998 (noting that the ripeness requirement
ensures that the record before the court is “adequate to support an informed decision”).
Dismissal of this action under the ripeness doctrine is therefore warranted.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Department of Education respectfully requests that the
Court grant this motion and dismiss this action for lack of jurisdiction.
