JOINT STIPULATION EXTENDING PLAINTIFF’S TIME TO RESPOND TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS
COME NOW D.R. Horton-Crown, LLC, Plaintiff in the above-styled action, and Fulton
County, Georgia, Defendant in the above-styled action, and jointly move this Court to extend the
time in which Plaintiff has to respond to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.
Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss on April 29, 2016. Per Local Rule 7.1(B),
Plaintiff’s Response is due on May 13, 2016. Counsel for Plaintiff is requesting an extension of
time. Plaintiff’s counsel was in Court most of the day Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday,
May 11, 2016, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office lost power and counsel consequently lost access to the
server and was unable to perform the work intended on the Response Brief.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is requesting an extension of time to respond through and
including May 24, 2016. As evidenced by the e-signature below, Plaintiff and Defendant’s
counsel have discussed this date and Defendant is agreeable to this extension.

WHEREFORE the parties request that this Court grant an extension of time for
Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss through and including May 24, 2016, and
provide Defendants with the appropriate time to provide a Reply pursuant to the Local Rules.
