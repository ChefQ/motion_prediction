RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO REMAND

Defendants ChoicePoint Services, Inc. and Brent Wilson (collectively ""Defendants'') file
this Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Remand, and respectfully show the Court as follows:

I.
INTRODUCTION

As set forth in Defendants' Notice of Removal of Civil Action, this Court has jurisdiction
over this lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331. Nevertheless, Plaintiff asserts that remand is proper in
this action for the following reasons: (1) the suit does not "substantially" involve a federal
question, (2) a defendant signed an agreement specifying the state court as the forum, (3) the
notice of removal was filed more than 30 days after notice of this lawsuit was provided to the
first defendant, (4) a defendant asked the state court for affirmative relief, and (5) the defendant
did not obtain timely written consent from all served defendants before removing. See Plaintiff's
Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, | 2. Each of Plaintiff's contentions is unfounded and
lacks merit.

IL.
ARGUMENT

1, Plaintiff asserts a claim under federal law, and therefore, this Court has
jurisdiction.

Plaintiff asserts that this lawsuit does not substantially involve a federal question on the
ground that the claim based in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") "is just a minor part of
this case." See Plaintiffs Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, 4 6(a). Plaintiff's
characterization of his claims is misleading and lacks merit.

Federal question jurisdiction extends to "all civil actions arising under the Constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331; Frank v. Bear Stearns & Co., 128 F.3d
919, 922 (5 Cir. 1997). Federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7 1331 extends to cases
in which the complaint establishes that federal law creates the cause of action. Franchise Tax
Bad. of State of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation, 463 U.S. 1, 27-28 (1983); Frank, 128
F.3d at 922.

Turning to Plaintiffs complaint, Plaintiff unequivocally alleges numerous violations of
the FCRA. /d. at { 24 (alleging violations of 15 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 1681, et seq., 0x00A7 1681(c)(a)(2),
0x00A7 168le, 0x00A7 1681e(b), 0x00A7 16811, and 0x00A7 1681k). By asserting violations of a federal statute and
demanding damages therefrom, Plaintiff has asserted a claim for which this Court has
jurisdiction.

Plaintiff directs the Court to Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &
Manufacturing, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 2367 (2005). However, Grable is inapplicable to the present
facts. In Grable, the complaint only alleged state law claims for relief. The plaintiff failed to
plead any claims directly under federal law. In contrast, the Plaintiff in the present case
unequivocally seeks relief under the FCRA.

2. No Defendant has signed an agreement specifying state court as the proper
forum.

Plaintiff asserts that Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC ("Greystar") waived its right to
removal by signing an agreement specifying state court as the forum to settle disputes. See
Plaintiffs Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, { 6(b). Plaintiff specifically alleges that the
waiver is included in the apartment lease on file with the Court. Jd.

Courts have held that a party may contractually waive its right of removal as long as it
does so explicitly and unequivocally. See McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Lloyds Underwriters of
London, 944 F.2d 1199, 1206 (5 Cir. 1991) (holding that a party must "explicitly" waive such a
right); Regis Assoc. v. Rank Hotels (Mgmt.) Ltd., 894 F.2d 193, 195 (60x2122 Cir. 1990) ("the case law
makes it clear that such waiver must be clear and unequivocal"); Weltman v. Silna, 879 F.2d 425,
427 (8" Cir. 1989) ("waiver of the right to remove must be 'clear and unequivocal' ").

Here, Plaintiff fails to direct the Court to any provision of the lease, or any other
document, wherein any Defendant explicitly, or implicitly, waives its right to removal. Contrary
to Plaintiff's assertion, there is no such provision in the lease, or any other document, wherein a
Defendant waives its right to remove. Accordingly, Plaintiff's argument lacks merit.

3. Defendants timely filed the Notice of Removal.

Plaintiff asserts that the filing of the removal was untimely in that it occurred more than
30 days after service of the suit. See Plaintiffs Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, 0x00A7 6(c).
Plaintiff asserts that Greystar first received notice of this lawsuit via email on July 26, 2006. See
Plaintiffs Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, Attachment A. Plaintiff further asserts that,
since the notice of removal was filed more than 30 days later on August 28, 2006, the removal

was filed untimely. Plaintiff's argument fails for two reasons. First, Plaintiff's email to Greystar

RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO REMAND
DALLAS: 518025.00014: 1532944v1
Case 5:06-cv-00738-XR Document6 Filed 09/29/06 Page 4 of 8

was insufficient to start the clock for removal. Second, even if it were sufficient, Plaintiff
incorrectly calculates the removal deadline under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6.

a. Service by electronic means does not start the clock for the deadline to
remove an action.

Notice of a lawsuit via electronic means is insufficient to start the clock for removal. See,
e.g., Murphy Bros., Inc. v. Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc., 526 U.S. 344 (1999) (rejecting plaintiff's
argument that service via facsimile started the clock for removal and holding that a defendant's
deadline for removal does not begin to run until the defendant has been served with a summons
or waives formal service); Smith v. Wagner, Civil Action H-06-02629, 2006 WL 2729282 (S.D.
Tex. September 26, 2006) (same).

In Murphy, the plaintiff faxed a file-stamped copy of the suit to the defendant on January
29, 2006. Murphy, 526 U.S. at 344. The plaintiff formally served the defendant on February 12,
1996. Id. Thirty days later, on March 13, 1996, the defendant removed the action. /d. The
plaintiff sought remand on the grounds that the removal-which was filed 44 days after the
defendant received notice of the suit via facsimile-was untimely. The United States Supreme
Court rejected this analysis and held that a defendant's time to remove is triggered only by
simultaneous service of the summons and complaint. /d. Accordingly, the Court found that the
notice of removal was timely filed.

Here, Plaintiff states that he first emailed the complaint to Greystar on July 26, 2006.
However, this email is irrelevant for determining the removal deadline under Murphy.

Defendant Brent Wilson, the first-served defendant, was served on July 28, 2006.
Accordingly, the deadline for removal would have been Sunday, August 27, 2006. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A7

1446(b). Since the deadline would have fallen on Sunday, it was automatically extended by the

DALLAS: 518025.00014: 1532944v1
Case 5:06-cv-00738-XR Document6 Filed 09/29/06 Page 5 of 8

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to Monday, August 28, 2006. Therefore, the notice of removal
was timely.

b. Even accepting Plaintiff's argument, the notice of removal was still
timely filed.

When calculating deadlines, Rule 6(e) requires that three days be added after the
prescribed period would otherwise end if service is made by electronic means under Rule
5(b)(2)(D). According to Plaintiff, Greystar first received notice of the case via email on July
26, 2006. Even accepting such date as the first date for calculating the removal deadline, the
deadline for removal did not expire until 33 days later on August 28, 2006. As such, the removal
was timely filed, and Plaintiffs argument fails.

4, No defendant has waived its right to removal be seeking affirmative relief.

Plaintiff asserts that by asking the state court for affirmative relief, Defendants waived
the right to remove. See Plaintiff's Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, 0x00A7 6(d). As evidence
of defendant's alleged seeking of affirmative relief, Plaintiff refers the court to its Exhibit B,
Defendant GREP South, L.P.'s Original Answer, Special Denials, Original Counterclaims, and
Motion for Sanctions.

As indicated, supra, a defendant's intent to waive the right to removal must be "clear and
unequivocal." Tedford v. Warner-Lambert Co., 327 F.3d 423, 428 (5" Cir. 2003); Beighley v.
FDIC, 868 F.2d 776, 782 65" Cir. 1989); Warner v. Crum & Forster Commercial Ins. Co., 839
F. Supp. 436, 439-40 (N.D. Tex. 1993). Further, the right to removal is not lost by participating
in state court proceedings short of seeking an adjudication on the merits. Tedford, 327 F.3d at
428. In the present case, no adjudication on the merits was done. Rather, a defendant merely

filed his answer, counterclaims, and a motion for sanctions.

Case 5:06-cv-00738-XR Document 6 Filed 09/29/06 Page 6 of 8

5. ChoicePoint obtained timely written consent of all served Defendants.

Plaintiff asserts that ChoicePoint failed to obtain timely written consent of all served
Defendants before removing the case. See Plaintiffs Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand,
6(e). More precisely, Plaintiff claims that the notice of removal "does not contain the written
consent of defendant Greystar." See Plaintiffs Motion & Notice of Motion to Remand, 0x00A7 6(e).

Plaintiff's state-filed petition names as a defendant "Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC."
See Plaintiffs Original Petition and Request for Disclosure. However, according to the Texas
Secretary of State, there is no entity authorized to do business in the state of Texas named
"Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC." See Ex. A. Plaintiff has named a non-existent entity as a
defendant. Plaintiff's argument therefore fails on its face because: (1) Plaintiff could not have
served a fictitious entity; and (2) ChoicePoint cannot be faulted for not obtaining the written
consent of an entity which does not exist.

IV.
CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, Defendants respectfully requests that Plaintiffs Motion and
Notice of Motion to Remand be denied, and that Defendants be granted such other and further

relief to which they may justly be entitled.
