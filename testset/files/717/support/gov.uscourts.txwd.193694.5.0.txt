Case 5:06-cv-00738-XR Document5 Filed 09/18/06 Page 2 of 3

Defendant received notice of this suit on July 25, 2006.

Defendant filed its notice of removal on August 28, 2006.

B. Argument

The court may remand a case on the basis of any defect identified in a motion for

remand filed within 30 days after the notice of removal under 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71446(a). 28

U.S.C. 0x00A71447(c). The courts strictly construe the removal statutes in favor of remand and

against removal. Bosky v. Kroger Tex., LP, 288 F.3d 208, 211 (5" Cir. 2002); Diaz v.

Sheppard, 85 F.3d 1502, 1505 (1 1" Cir. 1996); Brown v. Francis, 75 F.3d 860, 864-65

(3 Cir. 1996). Any doubt about the propriety of removal should be construed against

removal. Diaz, 85 F.3d at 1505.

6.

The court should remand this case to state court because:

(a) the lawsuit does not substantially involve a federal question. 28 U.C.S.
0x00A71447(c). Specifically, a suit can only be removed to federal court when (1) the
claim raises a contested federal issue, (2) the issue is actually disputed and
substantial, and (3) federal courts can entertain the claim without disturbing the
congressionally approved allocation of cases between the state and federal
courts. See Grable & Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg.,

125 S.Ct. 2363, 2367 (2005) (emphasis added). The FCRA claim is just a minor
part of this case. Therefore, the federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.

(b) defendant signed an agreement specifying the state court as the forum to
settle disputes; thus, defendant waived its right to removal. See Waters v.
Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 252 F.3d 796, 797-98 6" Cir. 2001); Snapper,
Inc. v. Redan, 171 F.3d 1249, 1261-62 (11" Cir. 1999). This provision is
contained within the apartment lease signed by plaintiff and defendant that is on
file with this court.

(c) defendant filed the notice of removal more than 30 days after it received
received notice of plaintiff's suit. 28 U.S.C. 0x00A71446(b); see Murphy Bros. v.
Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc., 526 U.S. 344, 354, 119 S.Ct. 1322, 1328-29
 

Case 5:06-cv-00738-XR Document5 Filed 09/18/06 Page 3 of 3

(1999). Attached as Exhibit A is a copy of the e-mail notification of this

suit which was sent to defendant, along with a copy of the lawsuit. Defendant
did not file the notice of removal until August 28, 2006, more than 30 days
after it received notice. The failure of the first-served defendant to file a
notice of removal within 30 days of service prevents all later-served defen-
dants from remoying the action. Brown v. Demco, Inc., 792 F.2d 478, 481-82
(5" Cir. 1986)

(d) defendant asked the state court for affirmative relief, waiving its right

to removal. See Johnson v. Heublein, Inc., 227 F.3d 236, 244 (5" Cir.

2000); Brown., 792 F.2d at 481. Defendant asked the state court for affirmative
relief when it filed a motion asking that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed and
sanctions awarded. Defendant also filed a counter-claim against plaintiff asking
for various damages. See Exhibit B.

(e) defendant did not obtain timely written consent of all served defendants

before removing the case. See 28 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A71446(a)-(b), 1453(b). Defendant
ChoicePoint's notice of remand does not contain the written consent of defendant

Greystar, nor has such consent been timely obtained.

C. Conclusion

12. As stated, the courts strictly construe the removal statutes in favor of remand and
against removal. The defendants have not met their burden in proving up the request for
removal. For these reasons, plaintiff asks the court to grant the motion to remand,
remand this suit to the state court where it was originally filed, and award plaintiff his

court costs, expenses, and attorney fees.

Respectfully submitted,
