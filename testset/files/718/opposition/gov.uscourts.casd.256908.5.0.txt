INTRODUCTION
Defendants Dell, Gateway and Microsoft are not entitled to summary judgment on the factual

issue of their willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,958,226 (“the Haskell ‘226 patent”),
4,383,272 (“the Netravali ‘272 patent”), and 4,763,356 (“the Day ‘356 patent”).

In seeking

summary judgment, the defendants rely on legally and logically unsound procedural arguments,

7

while ignoring overwhelming evidence by which a reasonable jury could find that the defendants’

8

infringement was willful. First, the defendants premise their motion on the meritless assertion that a

9

willful infringement claim fails unless the patentee seeks and obtains summary judgment of

10

infringement. Second, the defendants disregard ample evidence — such as expert testimony offered

11
12
13
14
15

by Lucent — which at a minimum raises a genuine dispute as to whether the defendants’ actions
posed an objectively high likelihood of infringement. Third, the defendants ignore abundant proof
demonstrating the defendants knew or should have known of their objectively high likelihood of
infringement.

16

Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Lucent and MPT in accordance with

17

the appropriate legal standard, the defendants fall far short of sustaining their heavy summary

18
19

judgment burden on the factual issue of willful infringement. Because, at a minimum, genuine
disputes of material fact remain regarding whether the defendants’ infringement was willful, the

20
21
22

defendants’ motions for summary judgment should be denied.1
II.

SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW

23

Summary judgment is appropriate only where “the pleadings, depositions, answers to

24

interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no

Lucent does not intend to pursue allegations of willful infringement with respect to U.S. Patent

could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In determining whether

10

there are genuine issues of material fact, “the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to
the party opposing the motion, with doubts resolved in favor of the opponent.”

11

The Federal Circuit recently reviewed the law of willful infringement in In re Seagate

12

Technology, LLC, __ F.3d __, 2007 WL 2358677 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 20, 2007). In Seagate, the Court

13
14
15
16

of Appeals overruled the previous duty of care standard — which it characterized as a negligence
standard — and held that “proof of willful infringement permitting enhanced damages requires at
least a showing of objective recklessness.” Id. at *5. While recognizing that “the term [reckless] is

17

not self-defining,” id., the Court held that to establish willful infringement, a patentee must show (1)

18

“an objectively high likelihood that [the accused infringer’s] actions constituted infringement of a

19

valid patent” and (2) “that this objectively-defined risk (determined by the record developed in the

20

infringement proceeding) was either known or so obvious that it should have been known to the

21
22
23
24

accused infringer.” Id.
Seagate did not, however, reverse the long-standing rule that “[w]hether infringement is
willful is a question of fact” for the jury. ACCO Brands, Inc. v. ABA Locks Mfrs. Co., Ltd., __ F.3d

Seagate’s “objective recklessness” standard expressly depends on a non-exclusive host of factual-

A.

Lucent’s Efforts To Seek And Obtain Summary Judgment Have No Bearing On
Willfulness.

The defendants premise their summary judgment motions almost exclusively on the faulty
assertion that if a plaintiff does not move for and obtain summary judgment of infringement, there
can be no finding that their conduct was “objectively reckless” for purposes of willful infringement.
(D.I. 2049-2 at 2-3 (Dell); D.I 2053-2 at 3 (Microsoft); D.I. 2056-2 at 3-4 (Gateway)) That assertion
has no basis in law or logic.

15

First, many practical reasons exist why a litigant may choose not to move for summary

16

judgment, including expense, prioritization of litigation objectives, or whether the technical dispute

17
18

is amenable to presentation in that setting. As such, a litigant’s election not to seek summary
judgment on a particular issue in no way concedes the reasonableness of its opponent’s

19
20
21

noninfringement position.
Second, the defendants’ sweeping proposition ignores critical differences between the

22

standard for obtaining summary judgment of infringement and the standard for obtaining a finding of

23

willful infringement at trial. On summary judgment, all evidence must be viewed in the light most

24

favorable to the nonmoving party, all inferences must be resolved in its favor, credibility cannot be

25
26
27
28

considered, and the nonmoving party need only show that a genuine issue of material fact remains
for trial. See Chiuminatta Concrete Concepts, 145 F.3d at 1307. By contrast, in weighing the
evidence of infringement and willfulness at trial, the jury may resolve issues of fact, make credibility

determinations, and need not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

2

Thus, even if a factual dispute precluded summary judgment of infringement before trial, a

3

reasonable jury — having assessed credibility, credited certain evidence, and rejected other evidence

4

— could readily conclude that the accused infringer’s conduct posed an objectively high likelihood

5
6

of infringement all along.

For example, a defendant might secure denial of an infringement

summary judgment motion by relying on factual assertions of its experts and fact witnesses, which a

7
8
9

court must accept as true. At trial, however, the jury is free to find these same factual assertions to
be not credible, to find that the infringement question was not close, and to also find that the

10

defendant “acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement.”

11

Seagate, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 2358677, at *5.

12
13
14
15
16

Finally, the defendants’ view that willful infringement can exist only where the patentee
obtained a summary judgment ruling of infringement would lead to absurd results.

If the

defendants’ view were correct, there could never be a trial in which a jury considers both
infringement and willfulness, because failure to obtain summary judgment of infringement would

17

automatically foreclose a finding willful infringement. Nothing in Seagate suggests such a result,

18

and no case since Seagate has so held.

19
20
21

B.

Ample Evidence Exists To Present A Genuine Dispute As To Whether
Defendants’ Actions Posed An Objectively High Likelihood Of Infringement.

In this case, the defendants have presented various non-infringement arguments with respect

22

to the Haskell ‘226, Netravali ‘272, and Day ‘356 patents. In response, Lucent has offered the

23

testimony of well-qualified experts that have concluded that the defendants in fact infringe these

24

patents and that each and every one of their non-infringement theories is meritless. (Ex. 3, Girod

3

Moreover, over a decade ago an independent licensing association concluded that the Haskell ‘226

4

and Netravali ‘272 patents were essential to the MPEG-2 video coding standard, which each of the

5
6

defendants admittedly practice (Ex. 25, Rubenstein Opinion). Indeed, in its October 1, 2007
summary judgment Order, the Court in this action recognized that “[t]he parties do not dispute that

7
8
9

the two patents are essential to the MPEG-2 standard.” (Ex. 1, Order Granting In Part And
Denying In Part Parties’ Motions For Summary Judgment Regarding Defendants’ Affirmative

10

11

Patent Trust at 7) (D.I. 2109).

12
13
14
15
16

After hearing the evidence in this case, the jury would be entitled to agree with Lucent’s
experts and reject the opinions offered by the defendants’ experts.

The jury will weigh the

credibility of each side’s evidence and may well conclude — unbound by the summary judgment
mandate to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants — that the defendants’

17

underlying non-infringement defenses, and alleged reliance thereon, were objectively unreasonable.

18

That determination, in turn, would support a finding that the defendants’ actions posed an

19

objectively high likelihood of infringement for purposes of assessing willful infringement. Indeed,

20

the Federal Circuit recognized in Seagate that the “objectively-defined risk” must be “determined by

21
22
23

the record developed in the infringement proceeding.” Seagate Technology, LLC, __ F.3d __, 2007
WL 2358677, at *5 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 20, 2007).

As set forth below, ample evidence exists to establish that the defendants knew or should

Ample Evidence Establishes That The Defendants Were Aware Of Their
Objectively High Risk Of Infringement Of The Haskell ‘226 And
Netravali ‘272 Patents.

There can be no dispute that the defendants knew of the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272
patents, and Lucent’s infringement allegations, long before the filing of this action. Lucent provided

12

Dell with notice of infringement of the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents at an October 20,

13

1998 meeting between Lucent representatives James Tierney and Joseph Braski and Dell

14

representatives Henry Garrana and Diana Roberts. (Ex. 9, Tierney Dep. at 89:13-22; see also at

15

14:12-14.) Lucent also identified precise activity within those computers that infringe the Haskell

16
17
18
19

‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents — namely, their use of the MPEG video coding standards. (Id. at
90:10-17; see also 20:24-21:1, 91:12-21) At a follow-up meeting on December 16, 1998, Lucent
provided not only notice of infringement but also proof of infringement, including claim charts that

20

mapped Lucent’s patent claims against the infringing MPEG functionality used by Dell PCs. (Ex. 9,

21

Tierney Dep. at 31:2-11, 16:19-17:11, 86:12-87:5, 88:22-89:12; Ex. 16, 12/8/98 E-Mail from

22

Tierney to Greene at LUC 1048967; Ex. 17, 12/9/98 E-Mail from Greene to Dickson at LUC

23
24

1049240.)
Lucent similarly provided Gateway with notice of infringement of the Haskell ‘226 and

25
26
27
28

Netravali ‘272 patents well before the filing of this suit at an April 2, 1998 meeting between Lucent
representatives (including James Tierney, Joseph Braski, David Padnes and David Rosenblatt) and
Gateway representatives (including George Clark) at Gateway’s corporate headquarters in North

Sioux City, South Dakota. (Ex. 10, Tierney Dep. at 15:14-22, 17:4-13) (Ex. 10, Tierney Dep. at

2

17:4-13; see also 24:12-17, 59:18-60:2) Lucent identified not only Gateway PCs but also the

3

specific MPEG functionality within them that infringed the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents.

4

(Id. at 30:5-11; see also 33:15-34:13; 50:20-21; 64:9-65:11) Indeed, Mr. Tierney further testified

5
6

that Lucent’s representatives even presented claim charts that detailed Lucent’s infringement
assertions. (Id. at 31:14-19, 62:3-10, 64:21-24).

7
8
9

Likewise, Lucent notified Microsoft of the Haskell ‘226 patent before the filing of this suit
through a January 13, 2003 letter from Donald Boreman, of Lucent’s licensing agent Thinkfire, to

10

Dan Crouse, Microsoft’s Deputy General Counsel. (Ex. 19, 1/13/03 Letter from Boreman to Crouse

11

at LUC 1300153-55)

12

Technologies Patents utilized by Microsoft Products.” (Id.) Even Microsoft admits that it knew of

13
14
15
16

The letter identified the Haskell ‘226 patent as among the “Lucent

the Haskell ‘226 patent by January 13, 2003 by virtue of that letter. (Ex. 2, Microsoft Responses to
Lucent’s Second Set of Interrogatories No. 21) As such, Lucent provided the defendants with presuit notice of infringement of the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents, but the defendants

17

disregarded that notice and continued to infringe. After considering this evidence, and the record of

18

the infringement proceeding, a reasonable jury could reasonably find that the defendants acted in

19

disregard of a known or obvious risk.

20
21
22
23
24

Yet the record contains additional evidence demonstrating the defendants knowingly acted in
the face of an objectively high risk of infringement. Long ago, the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272
patents were publicly determined — by an independent technical expert — to be essential to the
MPEG-2 standard practiced by the defendants. On October 31, 1996, in connection with Lucent’s

25

exploration of whether to join the MPEG-LA licensing consortium, independent expert Kenneth

26

Rubenstein issued an opinion that the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents were essential to the

27

practice of the MPEG-2 standard (Ex. 25, at LUC 1141388 (essentiality of Netravali ‘272 patent),

28

LUC 1141393 (essentiality of Haskell ‘226 patent); see also Ex. 6, Futa Dep. at 40:14-21) Indeed,

as recognized by Judge Brewster in a recent Order, the defendants themselves admit that the Haskell

2

‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents are essential to the practice of the MPEG-2 standard. (Ex. 1, Order

patents are essential to the MPEG-2 standard.”). The defendants nevertheless chose to practice the

7
8

MPEG-2 standard without taking a license to those patents.
In addition, the record leaves no doubt the defendants knew that their products required a

9
10

license to patents — such as the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents — essential to the practice

11

of the MPEG-2 standard. Indeed, after Lucent first asserted these patents against the defendants,

each of the defendants took MPEG-2 Patent Portfolio Licenses from MPEG LA. Dell entered into a

13
14
15
16

license agreement with MPEG LA on December 31, 2001. (Ex. 27, DELL 312378-411). Gateway
entered into a license agreement with MPEG-LA in January 1, 2002. (Ex. 24, GW-LT 145507-54)
And Microsoft belatedly entered into a license agreement with MPEG LA on February 28, 2006.3

17

(Ex. 26, MSLT 1126821-51) Because Lucent was not a member of MPEG LA, each defendant

18

knew that it was not receiving a license to any Lucent patent.

19

Thus, the defendants’ own conduct demonstrates that they knew they needed a license to

20

practice patents essential to the MPEG-2 standard. Nevertheless, the defendants chose to infringe

21
22
23
24

the Lucent patents they admit are essential to the practice of the MPEG-2 standard — the Haskell
‘226 and Netravali ‘272 patents. In view of that evidence, a reasonable jury could readily conclude
that the defendants’ infringement was in disregard of a known or obvious risk.

25

Each of these MPEG LA licenses provided a release for activities back to 1994.

Furthermore, Dell itself admitted that it was infringing the Haskell ‘226 and Netravali ‘272

2

patents. Contemporaneous notes reflect that at the October 20, 1998 meeting between Lucent and

3

Dell, Dell’s counsel Henry Garrana acknowledged that Dell was infringing but that Dell would try to

4

pass such liability to its suppliers:

[I]f we went strictly by the legal ‘Book,’ Henry agrees Dell is infringing, however,
in the ‘real world’ Dell will do everything it can to pass along the responsibility for
the infringement on to its suppliers.

Instead of obtaining a license from Lucent, Dell then attempted to pass on the

responsibility for Dell’s infringement to its suppliers, sending indemnification notices to both
Microsoft and Intel in 1999:
RE: Lucent’s Notice of Infringement of U.S. Patent Nos.:
….
4,383,272 “Video Signal Interpolation Using Motion Estimation”
….
4,958,226 “Conditional Motion Compensated Interpolation of Digital Motion Video”
….
I am writing in reference to Lucent’s recent charge of infringement of the above cited
patents.
These patents potentially impact products that we have purchased from Microsoft,
including Windows 98, and to that extent, we would be looking to Microsoft for
indemnification.
(Ex. 14, 1/12/99 Letter from Roberts to Mason at DELL 326403 (Microsoft); accord Ex. 15, 1/12/99
Letter from Roberts to Silverman at DELL 326405 (Intel).) Dell neither attempted to design around

22

these patents nor requested that its suppliers alter their products, instead relying on its suppliers to

23

“pay Dell’s damages.” (Ex. 7, Garrana Dep. at 228:12-229:10)

24

Like Dell, Gateway also attempted to pass on the responsibility for its infringement to its

25

suppliers. Blindly relying on unspecified communications with its suppliers (Ex. 11, Walker Dep. at

26
27
28

53:14-21, 54:14-17, 58:1-23), Gateway 30(b)(6) witness Mark Walker admitted that Gateway likely
did not undertake any independent non-infringement analysis regarding the Haskell ‘226 and

Netravali ‘272 patents. (Ex. 11, Walker Dep. at 87:3-6) Nor is there evidence in the record to show
that Gateway made any design changes to its products. (Ex. 11, Walker Dep. at 116:9-117:8)

3

Microsoft similarly knew of the seriousness of Lucent’s charges of infringement with respect

4

to the Haskell ‘226 (and Netravali ‘272) patents, as customers such as Dell had requested

5
6

indemnification from Microsoft as early as January 12, 1999 due to the role of Microsoft products in
Lucent’s charges of infringement. (Ex. 14, 1/12/99 Letter from Roberts to Mason at DELL 326403;

7
8
9

accord Ex. 12, Weresh 39:13-41:19; 45:13-18) Microsoft, however, took no action in response to
Dell’s January 12, 1999 letter beyond providing Dell with technical information. (Ex. 12, Weresh at

10

47:9-13) Microsoft’s 30(b)(6) witness, associate general counsel John Weresh, could identify no

11

correspondence or dialogue with Dell regarding Lucent’s patents nor even any attempt by Microsoft

12

to order the patents and file histories. (Id. at 47:14-48:11)

13
14
15
16

Taken as a whole, the defendants’ conduct in response to Lucent’s infringement assertions —
pressing forward despite knowledge that they were infringing and/or ignoring the manifest risk of
infringement — permit a reasonable jury to find that the defendants acted in disregard of a known or

17

obvious risk. Viewed in conjunction with the other evidence of willfulness — the objectively-

18

defined risk, Lucent’s pre-suit notice of infringement, and the defendants’ acknowledged need for a

19

license to MPEG-essential patents as demonstrated by their license with MPEG-LA — at a

20

minimum, factual disputes exist warranting denial of the defendants’ summary judgment motions on

21
22
23

willful infringement.
2.

Ample Evidence Establishes That The Defendants Were Aware Of Their
Objectively High Risk Of Infringement Of The Day ‘356 Patent.

24

The defendants became aware of the Day ‘356 patent and Lucent’s infringement allegations

25

long before Lucent commenced this action. Thus, the defendants infringed the Day ‘356 patent with

26

knowledge of the patent and their likely infringement.

Lucent placed Dell on notice of the Day ‘356 patent before the filing of this suit at a July 31,

2

2001 meeting at Dell’s corporate headquarters in Austin, Texas. During that meeting, Lucent

3

specifically charged Dell with infringement of the ’356 Day patent with respect to Outlook and other

4

referenced products. (Ex. 8, Samuels Dep. at 159:6-8, 159:18-160:16, 211:3-23, 212:6-213:24,

5
6

217:3-22, 218:6-12, 249:16-23) Lucent’s assertions of the Day ‘356 patent at the July 31, 2001
meeting are corroborated by documents and Dell’s own witnesses. (Ex. 18, Dell Negotiation History

10

Lucent similarly placed Gateway on notice with respect to the Day ‘356 patent before the

11

filing of this suit at an August 7, 2001 conference and in subsequent communications. For example,

12

Lucent charged Gateway with infringement of the ‘356 patent with respect to Outlook and other

13
14
15
16
17

referenced products at the August 7, 2001 conference. (Ex. 8, Samuels Dep. at 63:19-67:13; 72:1-5;
73:3-15; 99:5-101:2; 105:23-106:5) And Lucent again notified Gateway of its infringement of the
Day ‘356 patent in correspondence on March 20, 2002. (Ex. 20, 3/20/02 Correspondence from
Samuels to Walker at LUC 031544-46)

18

Likewise, Lucent notified Microsoft of the Day ‘356 patent before the filing of this suit

19

through a January 13, 2003 letter from Donald Boreman, of Lucent’s licensing agent Thinkfire, to

20

Dan Crouse, Microsoft’s Deputy General Counsel. (Ex. 19, 1/13/03 Letter from Boreman to Crouse

21
22
23
24

at LUC 1300153-55) The letter identified the Day ‘356 patent as among the “Lucent Technologies
Patents utilized by Microsoft Products.”

(Id.)

In addition, the letter expressly identified the

Microsoft “Products Impacted” by Lucent’s infringement assertions. (Id.) Even Microsoft admits

25

that it knew of the Day ‘356 patent by January 13, 2003 by virtue of that letter. (Ex. 2, Microsoft

As with the other patents, Lucent’s pre-suit notice with respect to the Day ‘356 patent, the

2

defendants pressed forward with their infringing conduct. In view of that evidence, a reasonable

3

jury could find that the defendants’ infringement was in disregard of a known or obvious risk.

4
5
6

In addition, the defendants ignore other conduct supporting a finding of willful infringement.
For example, instead of obtaining a license from Lucent, Dell attempted to pass on the responsibility
for Dell’s infringement to its suppliers, sending indemnification notices to both Microsoft and Intel

7
8

in 1999:

14

Lucent is asserting certain patents against Dell products. In the course of our
discussions with Lucent we had requested that Lucent identify the alleged Dell
infringing products with some specificity. At a recent meeting, they have made such
an identification that actually relate to Microsoft products as follows:
…
2. Lucent asserted the Day patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,763,356) against graphic
interfaces of the Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Outlook products &
specifically the drop-down menu feature.
…
Therefore I wanted this mail to serve as Dell’s notice for indemnity from Microsoft.

15

(Ex. 21, 4/15/02 Correspondence from Garrana to Sako at DELL 326561) (emphasis added) And at

16

no point did Dell even attempt to design around these patents or request that its suppliers alter their

18

products, instead relying on its suppliers to “pay Dell’s damages.” (Ex. 7, Garrana Dep. at 228:12229:10)

19
20
21

Like Dell, Gateway also attempted to pass on the responsibility for its infringement to its
third-party suppliers. (Ex. 11, Walker Dep. at 53:14-21, 54:14-17, 58:1-23). Nor is there evidence

22

in the record to show that Gateway made any design changes to its products. (Ex. 11, Walker Dep. at

116:9-117:8)

24

Walker not to answer questions from Lucent’s counsel regarding Gateway’s responses to Lucent’s

25
26
27
28

Moreover, counsel for Gateway repeatedly instructed its 30(b)(6) witness Mark

infringement assertions. (Id. at 114:15-115:13) Having prevented Lucent from obtaining discovery
on this issue, Gateway should be precluded from referring to that “lack” of evidence as a basis for its
motion.

(Ex. 12, Weresh at 48:4-18, 52:7-21)
In sum, the defendants’ conduct in response to Lucent’s infringement assertions —

9
10

continuing to infringe despite knowledge that they were infringing and/or efforts to ignore the

11

infringement — permit a reasonable jury to find that the defendants acted in disregard of a known or

judgment motions on willful infringement.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, the defendants’ motions for summary judgment of no willful

infringement with respect to these patents should be denied.
