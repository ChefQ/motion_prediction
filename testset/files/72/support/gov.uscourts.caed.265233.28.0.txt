Movants Consumer Action, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National

2

Consumers League, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group (“movants”) hereby request leave to

3
4
5
6

file with this Court a memorandum as amici curiae in support of the Plaintiffs’ motion seeking a
preliminary injunction. Counsel for Plaintiffs and the State of California have informed us that
they do not oppose this motion.

7

The purpose of the proposed brief is to assist the Court in understanding the true effects of

8

the no-surcharge rule – purportedly a consumer-protection measure – on consumers and

9

competition. Cal. Civ. Code § 1748.1. Movants’ proposed brief offers a vital, unrepresented

10
11
12
13

perspective that will aid the Court in assessing the far-reaching consequences of this case.
Moreover, rather than offering information merely of interest as background, the proposed brief
will provide facts critical to the Court’s application of the legal standards for commercial speech

14

restrictions. See Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 566

15

(1980). Because the relevant legal analysis calls for the Court to evaluate the substance and

16

efficacy of the government action in light of its policy aims, an amicus brief from those the

17

policy is said to protect, offering facts about its true impact, is uniquely appropriate. This Court

18
19
20
21

should grant here leave because “the amicus has unique information or perspective that can help
the Court beyond the help that the lawyers for the parties are able to provide.” Missouri v. Harris,
No. 2:14-cv-00341-KJM-KJN, 2014 WL 2987284, at *2 (E.D. Cal. July 1, 2014) (quoting Cmty.

22

Ass'n for Restoration of Env't (CARE) v. DeRuyter Bros. Dairy, 54 F. Supp. 2d 974, 975 (E.D.

23

Wash. 1999)).

24

Movants have broad knowledge and decades of experience advocating for consumers and
are particularly well qualified to assist the Court in understanding the substantial public interest
advanced by the challenge to the no-surcharge rule. The identities and interests of the movants
are as follows:

Consumer Action has been educating consumers on credit card related matters,

2

including credit card surcharges, for more than four decades. Consumer Action has been a

3
4
5
6

champion of underrepresented consumers since 1971.

A national, nonprofit 501(c)3 organization,

Consumer Action focuses on financial education that empowers low to moderate income and
limited-English-speaking consumers to financially prosper. It also advocates for consumers in the

7

media and before lawmakers to advance consumer rights and promote industry-wide change,

8

particularly in the fields of credit, banking, housing, privacy, insurance and utilities.

The National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA) is a non-profit corporation
whose members are private and public sector attorneys, legal services attorneys, law professors,
and law students whose primary focus involves the protection and representation of consumers.
NACA’s mission is to promote justice for all consumers by maintaining a forum for information
sharing among consumer advocates across the country and serving as a voice for its members as
well as consumers in the ongoing effort to curb unfair and abusive business practices.
The National Consumers League is America’s oldest consumer organization, representing
consumers and workers on marketplace and workplace issues since its founding in 1899. NCL
provides government, businesses, and other organizations with the consumer’s perspective on a
wide range of concerns, including the cost of payment systems.
U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG), the federation of state Public Interest

22

Research Groups, is a national, nonprofit, non- partisan consumer advocacy organization that

23

stands up to powerful special interests on behalf of the American public. U.S. PIRG has long

24

advocated on the issue of swipe-fee reform. U.S. PIRG believes that cash customers should not

25
26
27
28

pay more to subsidize credit card reward programs and supports efforts to make the costs of credit
transparent to consumers.
The proposed amicus brief would both offer the consumer prospective on the case at hand,

and provide information critical to the Court’s application of the relevant legal standards. As would

2

be explained more fully in the proposed amicus brief, the no-surcharge rule has broad implications

3
4
5
6

for all consumer transactions, and was initially justified as a consumer-protection measure. See
Adam J. Levitin, Priceless? The Economic Costs of Credit Card Merchant Restraints, 55 UCLA L.
Rev. 1321, 1379–84 (2008) (discussing historical attempts by the credit card lobby to paint no-

7

surcharge rules as pro-consumer over the objections of major consumer groups). Yet neither party

8

to this action is in a position to provide the Court with a disinterested assessment of the rule’s true

9

impact on consumers or competition.

10
11
12
13
14

Because the case at issue is a First Amendment speech case, the Court’s legal analysis will
turn on the policy issues addressed in the proposed brief. Specifically, this Court must determine,
inter alia, “whether the asserted governmental interest [justifying the restraint of speech] is
substantial . . . . whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and

15

whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.” Cent. Hudson Gas, 447

16

U.S. at 566. The proposed brief would aid the Court in assessing to what degree – if at all – the

17

no-surcharge rule serves the asserted government interest, and the availability of less extensive

18
19
20
21

means to achieve the same purpose. See Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 768 (1993) (“Neither
will we turn away if it appears that the stated interests are not the actual interests served by the
restriction.”). In some cases, advocacy groups and interested parties may seek to use amicus briefs

22

to shoehorn policy considerations into cases where public policy is not strictly relevant to the legal

23

determinations before the court. This is not such a case. The legal test will require an evaluation of

24

a policy that supposedly benefits consumers, and therefore movants are uniquely positioned to

25

provide the Court with information directly relevance to the issues before it.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The plaintiff merchants in this case are seeking an injunction against the enforcement of
California’s no-surcharge law, California Civil Code section 1748.1. This law allows merchants to
directly pass on the cost of credit card swipe fees to consumers by charging different prices
depending on whether a consumer pays with cash or credit—but only if the merchants frame the

7

price difference as the credit card industry wants them to: “discounts” for cash are allowed,

8

equivalent “surcharges” for credit are not.

9
10
11
12
13
14

The way this price difference is framed matters, however, because “[b]ehavioral economics
explains that consumers are more sensitive to a loss than to a gain.” Fumiko Hayashi, FEDERAL
RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITY, Discounts and Surcharges: Implications for Consumer Payment
Choice, 2 (June 2012). “In the context of consumer payment choice,” consumers “react more
strongly to surcharges than to discounts,” meaning that discounts “have a smaller impact on payment

15

behavior than surcharges of the same value.” Id. By requiring merchants to label any price

16

difference as a cash “discount” rather than a credit “surcharge,” California’s no-surcharge law

17 prohibits them from effectively communicating the cost of credit to their customers—and thus
18
19
20
21

furthers the credit card industry’s goal of keeping consumers in the dark about how much they pay
for credit. Moreover, because merchants are afraid of crossing the line between discounts and
surcharges, the law in practice deters most merchants from engaging in differential pricing

22

altogether.

consumers.

For reasons discussed more fully below, that is an especially bad outcome for

Amici curiae are national consumer advocacy organizations that support the injunction and

25

file this brief to make four primary points. First, the California no-surcharge law results in supra-

27
28

competitive interchange fees that, as a practical matter, merchants are forced to recoup by raising
prices for all consumers. Second, the no-surcharge law results in highly regressive cross subsidies of

BACKGROUND
California’s no-surcharge law provides that “no retailer in any sales, service or lease

22 transaction with a consumer may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in
23 lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means” and subjects merchants to treble damages plus
24 attorneys fees and costs for any violations. Cal. Civ. Code §1741.1. This law, and others like it,
25 effectively deprives merchants of a valuable tool that could otherwise be utilized to help remedy the
26
27
28

grossly inefficient and anticompetitive system of payment that now drastically and detrimentally
affects American consumers.

American consumers pay the highest interchange fees in the world, fees that are many times

2

higher than the fees paid by consumers in most other developed countries. These excessive fees are

3
4
5
6

passed on to consumers in the form of higher retail prices on the goods and services they purchase
every day. The main reason that there is not more awareness and outcry about this issue is that those
fees are hidden from consumers because merchants are effectively prevented from instituting pricing

7

structures that reflect those fees in the form of discounts or surcharges. Importantly, “no surcharge”

8

rules do not prevent merchants from passing on the costs of these supra-competitive fees. They only

9

prevent merchants from passing on those costs in a sensible manner more closely tied to the actual

10
11
12
13
14

use of credit cards and in a manner that could introduce price competition among payment systems.
The results are higher general retail prices and higher interchange fees. This also eliminates an
important mechanism that would otherwise be used to inform consumers about the issue of discount
rates and the costs of credit card use, preventing meaningful and cost conscious decisions about

15

payment systems. For these reasons, prohibitions on surcharging are extremely detrimental to

16

American consumers.

THE NO-SURCHARGE LAW FORCES MERCHANTS TO RECOUP SUPRACOMPETITIVE INTERCHANGE FEES BY RAISING STICKER PRICES
FOR ALL CONSUMERS.
The purpose and practical effect of the no-surcharge rule is to conceal the underlying true

costs of credit by spreading those costs among all consumers. To adequately understand the policy
considerations relating to the no-surcharge law, one must first understand the merchant credit card

24

fees that comprise the underlying problem. Every time a consumer uses a credit card, the merchant

25

generally pays 1–4% 1 of the transaction value in “merchant fees,” most of which go to the issuing

26
27

1

These fees are usually a hybrid of a per-transaction price and a percent of transaction cost, and
sometimes
can reach 15%, depending on the risk factor of the merchant. See Elizabeth Warren,

but because the volume of credit card transactions also increased dramatically, the absolute cost of
interchange fees for merchants increased 139% during the same period. 4 “For many merchants,

7

credit card acceptance has become the fastest growing cost of doing business,” 5 while MasterCard

and Visa have seen a 74% increase in interchange revenues, now accounting for 20% of their overall

these revenues in the form of rewards to a fraction of consumers, credit card companies have

2

constructed a system whereby consumers actively, and unknowingly, choose the most costly

3
4

payment system. Increased fees to merchants fuel greater rewards, which fuel greater use, in a race
to the top—precisely the opposite of competitive pricing.
The potent combination of market power and restraints on merchant speech have led to

6
7

increased retail sticker prices and a massive cross-subsidy among consumers.

“[H]undreds of

8 thousands of merchants . . . must take credit cards at any price because their customers insist on

aff'd, 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003). 8 Simultaneously, the no-surcharge law prevents merchants from
communicating or allocating the cost of credit card usage to the consumers who impose them by
choosing to pay with credit cards. 9 In practice, merchants must raise the unified sticker prices for all
their goods to cover the costs of credit card merchant fees. Cash buyers pay higher retail prices than

15

they otherwise should, while credit card customers are discounted from the true cost of their

16

transaction. 10 Credit card consumers receive all the benefits of credit card use, while cash customers

17

receive no benefit and pay a premium to cover the difference—a pervasive cross-subsidy operating

18
19
20
21
22

on all transactions. As Elizabeth Warren has put it: No-surcharge rules operate to force most
merchants “to charge all consumers higher prices in order to cover the costs of accepting credit card
transactions. As a result, non-credit consumers (food stamps, cash, checks, debit) end up subsidizing

The available empirical studies suggest these effects are not negligible. A study of gas
station pricing in 1989—when fees were far lower—showed that at stations which maintained
unified pricing, cash consumers paid a 1.5% premium over the national averages to subsidize a
discount from cost to credit card users of 2%-3.5%. 12 Today, the estimated overall cross-subsidy

7 between cash and credit users is staggering: “The average cash-paying household transfers $149 . . .
13
8 annually to card users [each of whom] receive[s] an average of $1333 annually from cash users.”

The recent explosion in rewards card programs has exacerbated the problem of hidden crosssubsidies considerably.

Because, in addition to the no-surcharge law, network rules forbid

merchants from selectively accepting credit cards from within a given network, they must increase
prices to recoup the costs of increasingly generous, high-end rewards programs. “Rewards cards
have risen from less than 25 percent of new card offers in 2001 to nearly 60 percent in 2005” and
now are considered to “drive the growth in . . . all credit card usage.” 14 The power of rewards to

16 increase credit card usage—though vitally, not to increase overall consumer spending—is closely
17 tied with increases in interchange revenue. In fact, rewards cards and corporate cards sometime cost
18
19
20

merchants twice as much in fees. 15 In 2007, Visa’s ultra-premium rewards card’s interchange rate at
large supermarkets—among the merchants with theoretically the most leverage to negotiate fees—

2

average as much as 3.25% interchange fees. 17

Far from being a problem for credit card networks, the across-the-board price increases work
in their favor: “Card networks have the incentive to charge high interchange fees to inﬂate retail
prices so that they can create more demand for their service . . . . As the card payments become more

7

efficient and convenient than alternatives, the card networks are able to further raise the interchange

8

fees, inflate the value of transactions and hence extract more profits” without lifting consumer

9

surplus and merchant profits. 18 Neither merchants nor non-credit card users gain any marginal

10
11
12

benefit from these high-end rewards cards, but they both end up footing the bill for immense credit
card company profits, and the generous rewards they provide to a tiny segment of consumers.
No-surcharge laws effectively gag merchants and deny consumers vital information about the

13
14
15

relative costs of payment systems, ensuring that cards are never put into serious price competition
with each other or with other payment systems. The largest issuers like Citibank and Chase,

16 representing more than 65% of the market, effectively set their interchange fees collectively, and do
17 not allow merchants to differentiate between card networks from different issuers (i.e. Visa vs.
18
19
20
21

Citibank Visa), entirely foreclosing competition. 19 Commercial speech, as this case demonstrates, is
essential to a free market economy. See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 364 (1977). In a
less competitive environment, companies have less incentive to price competitively and prices

issuers will be unconstrained by cost. Thus, issuers will continue to engage in a race to the top of

THE CROSS SUBSIDIES CREATED BY THE NO-SURCHARGE LAW ARE
HIGHLY REGRESSIVE.
Credit card companies direct a small fraction of their supracompetitive profits to their richest

customers at the cost of the low-income consumers, effectively implementing a regressive tax on all
consumers. Consumers using “cash”—which for purposes of this brief includes checks, debit cards,
and food stamps—unknowingly pay a premium that subsidizes the credit card networks and their
high income consumers. The distribution of the benefits is no accident: credit card companies

17

almost exclusively target affluent consumers and corporate accounts for the most generous

18

rewards. 21

22

On average, cash consumers are far lower income, and embrace a larger proportion of
minorities, than the credit card users. 22 Ten percent of adult Americans are completely “unbanked”
and therefore ineligible for credit cards. 23 Within the lowest income quintile of Americans, 29% are

2

of the white, non-Hispanic population lacks a bank account, 20% of non-whites and Hispanics are

3
4
5
6
7

unbanked.” 25 Approximately 40% of the lowest income quintile of Americans have a credit card,
while 67% households with income of $20-$50 thousand dollar per year, and 97% of households
over earning over $120 thousand per year, have at least one credit card. 26 Naturally, the distribution
of access to credit cards means that this cross-subsidy overwhelmingly benefits high income

8 consumers: “credit card spending by high-income consumers is nearly five times higher than credit
9 card spending by low-income consumers, and . . . high-income consumers are 20 percentage points
10
11
12
13
14

more likely to receive credit card rewards.” 27 No-surcharge laws facilitate a massive transfer of
resources from cash users to credit card users, and even among credit card users, from low-income,
low-rewards card users to high-income, high-rewards card users. Never having to bear the costs of
their usage, rewards card users use credit cards more often and more exclusively than those without

15

rewards credit cards. 28 “By far, the bulk of the transfer gap is enjoyed by high-income credit card

16

buyers [income $100k+], who receive a $2,188 subsidy every year,” as opposed to the low income

17

credit card buyers, who “receive a subsidy [of] $613.” 29 In absolute terms, the estimated transfer is

about $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion from rewards on gasoline and grocery purchases alone. 30 Together,

THE STATE’S JUSTIFICATION FOR THE LAW, AVOIDING
MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES, DOES NOT SURVIVE
SCRUTINY AND ALTERNATIVE, LESS RESTRICTIVE MEANS ARE
READILY AVAILABLE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM POTENTIAL
MERCHANT ABUSES WITHOUT HARMING COMMERCE.
The California Attorney General’s primary justification for the no-surcharge law is that “the

9 speech affected by the surcharge prohibition concerns prices that mislead customers about the real
10
11
12

cost of their purchase” and is “deceptive.” See Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 13, ECF No. 22. This argument
falls flat, and this objective could be achieved through alternative, less restrictive interventions.
There is nothing about surcharging for credit cards that is inherently deceptive and the state

13

14 has proffered no evidence to demonstrate that this concern about deception is anything more than
15 theoretical. 31 Even assuming however, that the state’s concern were grounded in reality, the no16 surcharge rule is dismally crafted (and hugely overbroad) if its aim is in fact to protect consumers
17
18
19
20

from merchants who could advertise misleading sticker prices and thereby engage in a “bait and
switch.” 32 Moreover, as a practical matter, the recent nationwide settlement agreement with creditcard companies obviates this concern by requiring the truthful and prominent disclosure of surcharge

21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

31

This is further supported by the fact that every major consumer advocacy organization has
long opposed state no-surcharge laws. See, e.g., Molotsky, Extension of Credit Surcharge Ban, N.Y.
TIMES, Feb. 29, 1984, at D12 (quoting Senator William Proxmire, stating in debate on the Senate
floor that “[n]ot one single consumer group supports the proposal to continue the ban on
surcharges.”).
32
A related defense of the no-surcharge rule argues that two-tiered pricing interferes with
consumers’ ability to comparison shop. There is no logic to this argument as a justification for
disallowing surcharging while permitting discounts as “there is no reason to think that a comparison
of maximum prices (allowing discounts, not surcharges) is any better than a comparison of minimum
prices (allowing surcharges, not discounts).” Levitin, supra note 5, at 1383. Because discounts and
surcharges are mathematically equivalent, allowing one and not the other relies on an impermissible
“underestimation of the public,” Bates, 433 U.S. at 375, especially if merchants are required to
disclose their pricing structure.

information to consumers. See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee And Merchant Discount

Antitrust Litig., 986 F. Supp. 2d 207, 234 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). Putting aside the settlement, however, a

far less restrictive and more effective approach to keeping merchants from abusing two-tiered

In analyzing the no-surcharge law, economic theorists have vastly overemphasized the

34
17 merchants and consumers who use them—in analyzing the law’s impact on consumer welfare.

These theories can only be employed as a defense of the no-surcharge rule under the woefully

spending. In fact, if surcharging caused a decrease in credit card usage, it undoubtedly would
increase overall consumer welfare because: first, some transactions will likely be diverted to other
payment systems, like “PIN debit” which have their own network effects that will offset “harm” to
credit card networks; second, credit card usage has specific externalities which undermine the facile

Benefits to Consumers In Other Networks, Like Debit Card Users, Along
With Reduction in Interchange Fees, Will More than Offset the Welfare
Costs of Decreased Credit Card Usage.

Surcharging will create genuine competition between payment systems, benefiting debit card

5
6

users and driving down merchant fees for everyone. Many other payment systems are subject to

7

network effects, meaning that the diverted credit card usage would create comparable welfare gains

8

in other networks. For example, debit card usage is highly cross elastic with credit card usage, 35 and

9
10
11
12

the marginal loss to credit card users would be offset by the benefits to debit users. In fact, for
newer payment systems adoption matters a great deal more. By the time networks are as wellestablished and mature as credit cards, “the adoption and usage externality has become less

13

important.” 36 The qualities that most consumers cite as their reasons for using credit cards –

14

convenience, security from theft, widespread acceptance, speed at checkout – are fully replaceable

15 by new payment systems like debit cards, at half the cost. 37

The state has no legitimate interest in artificially sparing credit cards from free and open
competition with other payment systems. If the no-surcharge law is necessary to maintain credit
cards’ position vis-à-vis other payment systems, it is preserving a market failure that substantially
harms consumers. The Supreme Court has rejected state attempts to restrict advertising based on the
“fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information.” Thompson v. W. States

fact, the most likely and significant outcome of allowing merchants to frame the cost of credit as a
“surcharge” rather than a “discount” is a reduction in interchange fees as credit cards are forced to
compete on price with other payment systems. By barring merchants from effectively signaling

differential costs of payments, the “no surcharge rules increase the price of all other payment system

to match the price of credit cards,” 38 explaining why “interchange fees in the United States are more

relatively recent ban on no-surcharge rules immediately led to increased debit usage, while the
average MasterCard and Visa interchange rates fell by nearly half across the board. Significantly, it
also led to increased volume on its network. 40 Moreover, even without no-surcharge rules, credit
card companies continue to profit in Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, Switzerland, and Australia. 41 In fact, MasterCard voluntarily rescinded its own no-

16 surcharge rule for Europe in 2005. 42 In light of these real world examples, it is impossible to say
17 with a straight face that no-surcharge rules really help consumers. On balance, the effects the

decreased network effects for credit users are dwarfed by the gains in efficient market allocation.

rules. See Levitin, supra note 5, at 1359.
