Case No. 05-cv-00219

OWENS-ILLINOIS, INC.’S
MOTION TO EXCLUDE BARRY CASTLEMAN, SC.D.
Owens-Illinois, Inc. (“Owens-Illinois”) moves to exclude Barry Castleman Sc.D.
from testifying at all, or alternatively, from testifying about the specific knowledge or
conduct of Owens-Illinois (e.g., what it knew or should have known) and the fields in
which he has little or no expertise (e.g., medicine, industrial hygiene, toxicology,
corporate ethics) under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Counsel for Owens-Illinois and Plaintiff agreed in writing to settle the Suoja
case on December 18, 2014, but the final release has not been executed. Pursuant to the
court-ordered deadlines leading to trial, Owens-Illinois submits this Daubert motion out
of an abundance of caution and without prejudice to the parties’ settlement agreement.
See Order, Aug. 5, 2014, ECF No. 20.

Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). If necessary, Owens-Illinois further requests a
Daubert hearing to determine the admissibility of Castleman’s testimony.
BACKGROUND
Castleman is a creature of this litigation. He is not a medical doctor, not an
industrial hygienist, and not a historian in those areas. He brings no recognized field of
intellectual, scientific, or experience-based discipline to the courtroom. Instead, he is a
polemicist who seeks to substitute his own opinions for the jury’s review of the actual
evidence. Indeed, since he was a graduate student, Castleman has been a paid
“researcher” for the asbestos plaintiffs’ bar. In 1977 he prepared his first opinionated
book report on “The Development of Knowledge About Asbestos Disease,” at the
request of an asbestos plaintiffs’ lawyer, as something “which he [the lawyer, not
Castleman] could use to present the evidence in court.” Barry Castleman Dep. 26-27,
Aug. 13, 1982.
Years later, Castleman turned this advocacy-driven “research” into a doctoral
thesis and book, Asbestos: Medical and Legal Aspects. The dust jacket informs the reader
exactly why Castleman wrote his book:

-2-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 3 of 18

Barry Castleman, Asbestos: Medical and Legal Aspects (1st ed. 1984). Inside, Castleman
also dutifully acknowledged the asbestos plaintiffs’ lawyers “who gave generously of
their time to assist in the compilation of material and review its presentation.” Id. at xxi.
Castleman’s opinions are more political than scientific. From his role as an anticorporate, anti-asbestos activist, Castleman employs no principles or methods that
professionals in scientific fields apply to their work. His expert report and book, which
is incorporated into his expert report, read less like an expert’s unbiased assessment and
more like an improper closing argument. See Barry Castleman Rep. 1-14 (adopting and
incorporating book), attached as Ex. A; e.g., Asbestos: Medical and Legal Aspects 769 (5th
ed. 2005), attached as Ex. B. In one of many illustrations, Castleman takes on corporate
ethics and criminology with a section called “Criminal Sanctions and Personal
Responsibility.” Id. at 765. Plaintiffs would have Castleman testify that, “The members
of this privileged class decide what will be manufactured, where and how it will be
made and sold. The asbestos epidemic, whose toll of preventable deaths in the U.S.
alone will at least be in the hundreds of thousands, offers opportunity to see how the
criminal law or lack of it relates to public health.” Id. at 769-70.
Indeed, Castleman has repeatedly testified in favor of criminal liability against
former manufacturers and sellers of asbestos-containing products:
Individuals who profit by murder would be punished for
wantonly endangering the people in this country. It was never
the "American Way" to sell death in Kaylo boxes and call the
stuff non-toxic. If we want to prevent that business from
continuing, the rules of the marketplace will have to be
changed. Those who conceal deadly truths from their workers
and customers are almost: never confronted personally with the
-3-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 4 of 18

fact that they have committed a monstrous crime. My own
feeling is that no one in the executive suites would lightly risk
imprisonment and humiliation for a quick buck.
Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 28, Nov. 15, 1979, attached as Ex. C.
I think there should be personal, criminal liability for selling
[asbestos-containing products] without warnings to consumers .
. . . The history of asbestos product marketing is unfortunately
replete with stories of what many people might regard as toxic
corporate crime.
Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 83, July 31, 2001, attached as Ex. D.
The asbestos industry is a quasi-criminal industry in much of
the world today, using its power to corrupt political processes
and control the media when challenged.
Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 13, Mar. 1, 2007, attached as Ex. E.
With his activist’s review of history, Castleman is neither scientifically legitimate
nor principled. He is not a trained historian, and does not apply the scientific principles
of the historical method. Barry Castleman Dep. 22:15-24:12, May 27, 2008 (“I don’t
know what you mean by ‘historical method.’ That sounds like lawyer talk to me.”).
Instead, Castleman only reads the historical records that he is willing to consider, based
on his pre-determined opinions, and then refuses to look for, or even read, records that
may be contrary to his opinions:
Q.

And it’s fair to say, Doctor, that you haven’t looked
for that material [testimony of Owens-Illinois Kaylo
Division employees] either, right?

A.

That material has its way of finding me. . . .
....

Q.

My question, however, is whether or not you have
done anything independently to go out and search
out information that would add to your body of
knowledge about Owens-Illinois’ perspective when it
manufactured and sold Kaylo in the 1940s and ‘50s?

A.

No.
-4-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 5 of 18

Barry Castleman Dep. 48:17-20, 50:8-19, Jan. 3, 2002.
Castleman then excuses his failure to look for relevant information, which may
be contrary to his opinions, by rationalizing that “the stuff, if it was significant, would
have come to my attention and hasn’t.” Id. at 44:18-20. In fact, Castleman refuses to
read the testimony of the corporate witnesses whose conduct he vilifies:
Q.

Have you ever testified that you did not read the
testimony of Mr. Hazard?

A.

I may have. Like I say, I think I’ve probably seen
excerpts of it. And my memory of what I saw may
not be totally consistent in all the times I’ve been
asked about it. It’s not something that I’ve written
about, it’s not something that I paid particular
attention to.

Q.

It’s not discussed in your book, right; that is, Mr.
Hazard’s testimony is not discussed in your book?

A.

I don’t think so. I think that’s correct.

Q.

And Mr. Grimmie’s testimony is not discussed in
your book, right?

A.

That’s right.

Barry Castleman Dep. 36:9-25, Sept. 28, 2010.
Castleman’s belief that he has no obligation to test or confirm his assumptions is
blatantly unscientific and will always support his personal view that corporations are
criminals. Indeed, his unwillingness to consider all facts and data — including those
which may contradict his opinions — is the antithesis of good science. Castleman is the
quintessential expert for hire, whose knowledge does not and cannot compare to the
actual subject matter of his testimony, and consists of nothing more than his subjective
beliefs or unsupported speculation.
Accordingly, three courts in this circuit and two courts in Wisconsin have

-5-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 6 of 18

excluded Castleman’s testimony in their gatekeeping role. As these courts and others
nationwide have held, Castleman’s advocacy is inconsistent with the standards for
legitimate expert testimony.

Plaintiffs will not, and cannot, answer the crucial

questions: (1) what is Castleman’s actual field of expertise, and (2) what reliable
principles and methods for that field has he applied to testify as an expert witness? In
fact, Castleman admits that his opinions have no value for the jury:
Q.

And did you say in the Neal case when you were
asked if in your testimony you thought you could
give opinions, did you say,
I think that it really doesn’t aid the jury a great
deal to know what I think about all this stuff. I
think that it is, and of course this opinion may
or may not be shared by other parties involved
in these actions, but I think that the
documentation, if it can be presented in a
reasonably complete way, speaks well enough
for itself that a jury should be able to
understand it and evaluate it.

A.

I still think that’s true.

Barry Castleman Test. 1900:3-14, Mar. 21, 1986; Barry Castleman Dep. 76:15-18, Aug. 13,
1982 (“I could make factual statements that go to the question of accessibility of the
information. But I don’t think that it would be useful to go beyond that into the realm of
opinion.”).
LEGAL STANDARD
The admissibility of expert evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702
and the Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). By its terms, Rule 702 allows testimony only by an “expert,”
someone with the requisite “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,”
-6-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 7 of 18

where (a) the testimony “will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the
testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has
reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 702.
Daubert therefore requires the district court to act as the evidentiary gatekeeper,
ensuring that Rule 702’s requirements are satisfied before allowing the jury to hear a
proffered expert. 509 U.S. at 589; Kuhmo Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147-49
(1999); Lapsley v. Xtek, Inc., 689 F.3d 802, 805 (7th Cir. 2012). District courts have broad
discretion in deciding the admissibility of expert evidence. Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522
U.S. 136, 142 (1997); Lapsley, 689 F.3d at 810 (“we ‘give the district court wide latitude in
performing its gate-keeping function and determining both how to measure the
reliability of expert testimony and whether the testimony itself is reliable’” (quoting
Bielskis v. Louisville Ladder, Inc., 663 F.3d 887, 894 (7th Cir. 2011))). It is clear, however,
that while a district court has wide latitude to decide how to measure reliability, it must
do so. See Chapman v. Maytag Corp., 297 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir. 2002).
Before admitting expert evidence, a district court employs a three-part analysis:
(1) the expert must be qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education; (2) the expert’s reasoning or methodology underlying his testimony must be
scientifically reliable; and (3) the expert’s testimony must assist the trier of fact in
understanding the evidence or to determine a factual issue. Bielskis, 663 F.3d at 893-94.
“The purpose of the Daubert inquiry is to scrutinize the proposed expert witness
testimony to determine if it has ‘the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the
-7-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 8 of 18

practice of an expert in the relevant field’ so as to be deemed reliable enough to present
to a jury.” Lapsley, 689 F.3d at 805 (quoting Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 152). The
proponent of the expert bears the burden of showing that the expert’s evidence would
satisfy the Daubert standard by a preponderance of the evidence. Lewis v. CITGO
Petroleum Corp., 561 F.3d 698, 705 (7th Cir. 2009).
ARGUMENT
I.

Courts Have Rejected Castleman Repeatedly in this Circuit and Wisconsin.
Castleman has made a career in asbestos litigation as a paid advocate. In this

circuit and Wisconsin, however, his testimony has been excluded by at least five courts.
Krik v. Crane Co., ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2014 WL 5350463, at *2-3 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 21, 2014);
Rutkowski v. Occidental Chem. Corp., No. 83 C 2339, 1989 WL 32030, at *1-2 (N.D. Ill. Feb.
16, 1989); Flood v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., No. 86 C 8947, Hr’g Tr. 13:25-14:1 (N.D. Ill. Mar.
15, 2004), attached as Ex. F; Vandermeuse v. Allied Insulation Supply Co., Inc., No. 07 CV
55, slip op. at 1-2 (Cir. Ct. Kewaunee Cty. Wis. Feb. 5, 2014), attached as Ex. G; Sorcic v.
Keene Corp., No. 657-163, slip op. at 1-3 (Cir. Ct. Milwaukee Cty. Wis. Apr. 3, 1989),
attached as Ex. H.
As the Northern District of Illinois held in Rutkowski, Castleman is simply an
unqualified “librarian of asbestos research” who “lacks the medical background and
experience to evaluate and analyze the articles in order to identify which parts of the
articles best summarize the author’s conclusions.” Rutkowski, 1989 WL 32030, at *1. In
Flood, the court accurately summed up Castleman when it granted Owens-Illinois’s
Daubert motion to exclude his testimony:

-8-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 9 of 18

What he has done, if you ask me, is purely subjective. . . . He is,
if you will, acting a middleman, and I do not think that is
sufficient expertise to do anything in this case relevant to giving
him a license to both offer his opinions de facto or de jur[e]. He
offers opinions de facto be selecting those things he wants the
jury to hear.
Flood, Tr. 13:25-14:1.
Most recently, the court in Krik ruled that Castleman could not testify (1) “as to what
any particular Defendant knew or should have known at any given time regarding
asbestos,” or (2) in the “areas in which Dr. Castleman has little or no demonstrated
expertise (such as medical literature).” Krik, 2014 WL 5350463, at *3.
Likewise, Wisconsin courts have held Castleman’s opinions to be baseless. In
Sorcic, the trial court excluded Castleman and explained that, rather than Castleman,
“we could just have lay witnesses come up here and read a list of everything they found
in the Milwaukee County library or any other library that he felt inclined to list.” Sorcic,
slip op. at 1-3. Similarly, the trial court in Vandermeuse ruled that Castleman could only
“offer factual testimony regarding the dates of publication and contents of historical
documents and literature” and that he was “precluded from offering any opinions
regarding Owens-Illinois.” Vandermeuse, slip op. at 1-2. As the precedent in Rutkowski,
Flood, Krik, Sorcic, and Vandermeuse makes clear, Castleman’s opinions are not proper
expert testimony and should be excluded.
II.

Castleman’s Opinions Do Not Satisfy the Daubert Standard.
A.

Castleman Is Not Qualified to Offer His Opinions.

Castleman’s academic credentials do not, and cannot, qualify him to testify in
fields where he has no relevant expertise. “Whether a witness is qualified as an expert
-9-

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 10 of 18

can only be determined by comparing the area in which the witness has superior
knowledge, skill, experience, or education with the subject matter of the witness’s
testimony.” Gayton v. McCoy, 593 F.3d 610, 616, 617 (7th Cir. 2010) (citations and
brackets omitted). But Castleman holds no specialized knowledge in the fields of
history, medicine, toxicology, industrial hygiene, or corporate ethics. His opinions are
unrelated to whatever expertise he may have. Baldonado v. Wyeth, No. 04 C 4312, 2012
WL 1802066, at *4 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2012) (“Unless the expertise adds something, the
expert at best is offering a gratuitous opinion” (citation omitted)).
As federal courts across the nation have held, Castleman lacks any qualification
to offer medical opinions.

He does not “possess the expertise necessary to read

complex, technical medical articles and discern which portions of the articles would
best summarize the authors’ conclusions.” In re Related Asbestos Cases, 543 F. Supp.
1142, 1149-50 (N.D. Cal. 1982) (refusing to qualify Castleman as an expert); Franz v.
Celotex Corp., No. 84-1316, slip op. at 1 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 24, 1989) (finding “Castleman may
testify as a bibliographer only; therefore he will not be permitted to express any opinion
on the content of the articles or be allowed to testify as an expert”), attached as Ex. I;
Kendrick v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., No. C-85-178 AAM, slip op. at 8, ¶ 15 (E.D.
Wash. May 9, 1986) (excluding Castleman in accordance with In Re Related Asbestos
Cases) , attached as Ex. J; Rutkowski, 1989 WL 32030, at *1 (finding Castleman “lacks the
medical background and experience to evaluate and analyze the articles in order to
identify which parts of the articles best summarize the author’s conclusions”); Krik, 2014
WL 5350463, at *3 (precluding Castleman from “areas in which Dr. Castleman has little
- 10 -

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 11 of 18

or no demonstrated expertise (such as medical literature)”).
Likewise, a historian may be qualified to offer opinions how knowledge of
asbestos health risks developed. Historians have reliable principles and methods to
review historical materials. E.g., G. Reiner, History: Its Purpose and Method (1950); R.
Shafer, A Guide to Historical Method (1974). Trained historians apply the historical
method to historical material to explain the context of the day: (1) they collect a defined
universe of materials, (2) they prioritize the materials, (3) they search for corroborating
and contrary evidence, and (4) they test the product of their research. Castleman is not
a historian of any type and not qualified to apply their method in any way. In fact,
Castleman does not even know what the historical method is: “I don’t know what you
mean by ‘historical method.’ That sounds like lawyer talk to me.” Barry Castleman
Dep. 22:15-24:12, May 27, 2008.
To the extent Castleman’s expertise is reading hearsay sources and interpreting
them for jurors, that is no expertise at all. Baldonado, 2012 WL 1802066, at *4. That
“expertise” makes him just a “librarian of asbestos research,” Rutkowski, 1989 WL 32030,
at *1, and it is not a librarian’s job to read books and tell you what they mean. Expert
witnesses must have expertise in a relevant field to offer opinions in federal court, and
yet there is no field where Castleman practices as an expert outside the courtroom or
qualifies him as an expert inside the courtroom. Such an expert “witness who invokes
‘my expertise’ rather than analytic strategies widely used by specialists is not an expert
as Rule 702 defines that term.” Zenith Electronics Corp. v. WH–TV Broadcasting Corp., 395
F.3d 416, 419 (7th Cir. 2005). Castleman is a paid advocate with no qualifications in any
- 11 -

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 12 of 18

relevant field. Accordingly, this Court should reach the same conclusion as courts in
this circuit, Wisconsin, and across the nation, and exclude Castleman from testifying.
B.

Castleman’s Opinions Are Not Reliable.

Even if Castleman had some relevant field of expertise (which he does not), his
proposed testimony is not reliable, providing a second reason to exclude his testimony.
Since Daubert, “parties relying on expert evidence have had notice of the exacting
standards of reliability such evidence must meet.” Weisgram v. Marley Co., 528 U.S. 440,
455 (2000) (emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit has made clear that a “supremely
qualified expert cannot waltz into the courtroom and render opinions unless those
opinions are based upon some recognized scientific method and are reliable and
relevant under the test set forth by the Supreme Court in Daubert.” Lewis, 561 F.3d at
705 (citation omitted).
As Daubert teaches, the reliability of an expert’s principles and methods should
be examined by factors: (1) whether the scientific theory or technique can be (and has
been) tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and
publication; (3) whether a particular technique has a known potential rate of error; and
(4) whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the relevant scientific
community. 509 U.S. at 593-94. This test “make[s] certain that an expert, whether
basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience, employs in the
courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert
in the relevant field.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 152.
Castleman has no field of expertise, however, for this Court to ensure he applied

- 12 -

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 13 of 18

the same rigorous analysis to his courtroom opinions as he would in his professional
work. He has no scientific or principled methodology at all, much less a method that
has reliability. He is a self-employed, anti-asbestos, and anti-corporate advocate. See
Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 28, November 15, 1979; Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 82-86,
July 31, 2001; Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 5-13, Mar. 1, 2007. He holds a viewpoint,
which is consistent with Plaintiffs’ theory of the case, and then he selects and interprets
hearsay materials as counsel’s early closing argument. The Seventh Circuit has held,
however, an “experts’ work is admissible only to the extent that it is reasoned, uses the
methods of the discipline, and is founded on data. Talking off the cuff—deploying
neither data nor analysis—is not an acceptable methodology.” Naeem v. McKesson Drug
Co., 444 F.3d 593, 608 (7th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).
Because Castleman’s opinions are so subjective, it is impossible to determine
their reliability or validity. Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden to show Castleman’s
proposed testimony is based on reliable methods. Each of the Daubert factors shows a
lack of any reliability:


Whether the scientific theory or technique can be (and has been) tested.
There is no hypothesis in Castleman’s “theory or technique.” He only reads
the materials he wants to read. He believes that if he is unaware of relevant
material, he has no obligation to look for it. See Barry Castleman Dep. 44:1820, 48:17-20, 50:8-19, Jan. 3, 2002. There is no experiment which Castleman
has conducted which can be repeated.

- 13 -

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 14 of 18



Whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and
publication. There is no peer review for Castleman’s opinions. His book
(which serves as the basis for his expert report and is incorporated into his
expert report) has never been subject to peer review. Neither has his research
in testifying.



Whether a particular technique has a known potential rate of error. It is
impossible to consider Castleman’s error rate because he has never
considered opinions contrary to his own.

The fatal flaw in Castleman’s

technique is he has never done anything to investigate, research, or even
consider the possibility that his historical views are incorrect.


Whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the relevant
scientific community.

There are absolutely no standards to Castleman’s

“theory or technique.” He does not do random sampling. He does not read
from a defined universe of materials. Castleman just reads what he wants to
read. Indeed, even when he is furnished with records, Castleman refuses to
read them. Barry Castleman Dep. 36:9-25, Sept. 28, 2010.
Under each reliability factor, Castleman’s method is not scientifically legitimate
or principled. The Daubert Court explained that an expert’s “knowledge connotes more
than subjective belief or unsupported speculation,” 509 U.S. at 589, but Castleman’s
knowledge is nothing more than his subjective view of history based on hand-picked
hearsay that he considers “significant” or “found” him. Barry Castleman Dep. 44:18-20,
48:17-20, 50:8-19, Jan. 3, 2002; Barry Castleman Dep. 36:9-25, Sept. 28, 2010. Castleman’s
- 14 -

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 15 of 18

opinions are neither based on sufficient facts or data, nor the product of reliable
principles and methods, as Daubert and Rule 702 demand.
C.

Castleman’s Opinions Are Not Relevant.

Because Castleman follows no methodology and his opinions are pure advocacy,
his testimony will not assist the members of the jury. His opinions are just that — his
opinions. They are filtered through his justified view, and anything contrary to his
worldview is rejected or ignored. Everything he knows was learned from hearsay
sources or what he has been told by plaintiffs’ counsel. Just last year, the Supreme
Court of Delaware vacated a jury verdict where Castleman offered his own
unsubstantiated, prejudicial, and completely improper opinion that the defendant’s
employees were “liars” and that it spent millions of dollars “buying senators.” R.T.
Vanderbilt Co. Inc. v. Galliher, 98 A.3d 122, 129-30 (Del. 2014). Daubert must prohibit
experts, like Castleman, who “testify for a fee to propositions that they have not arrived
at through the methods that they use when they are doing their regular professional
work rather than being paid to give an opinion helpful to one side in a lawsuit.” Braun
v. Lorillard Inc., 84 F.3d 230, 235 (7th Cir. 1996).
Castleman admits that his opinions have no value to jurors. See Barry Castleman
Test. 1900:3-14, Mar. 21, 1986 (“I think that it really doesn’t aid the jury a great deal to
know what I think about all this stuff.”). As a matter of fact, when given evidence from
Owens-Illinois’s company witnesses and admissible records with a proper foundation
and authentication, the jurors can reach their own decisions — they do not need expert
testimony on what the evidence means from a “librarian of asbestos research,”

- 15 -

Case: 3:99-cv-00475-slc Document #: 40 Filed: 01/08/15 Page 16 of 18

“bibliographer,” or “middleman.” Rutkowski, 1989 WL 32030, at *1; Franz, slip op. at 1;
Flood, Hr’g Tr. 13:25-14:1.
There is no such thing as an expert inference-drawer. “Indeed, allowing [an
expert, like Castleman,] to testify based on nothing more than his review of certain
discovery materials could give the jury the impression that he did something more than
simply review the materials, which the jury can do itself.” Baldonado, 2012 WL 1802066,
at *4 (citation omitted). Moreover, Castleman’s inflammatory testimony (like his
corporate bribery theories, see Galliher, 98 A.3d at 129-30; his corporate criminal theories,
see Barry Castleman Cong. Test. 83, July 31, 2001; and his meritless corporate conspiracy
theories, see McClure v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., 720 N.E.2d 242, 266-67 (Ill. 1999))
certainly highlights the importance of this Court’s role as the gatekeeper under Daubert.
Castleman’s improper, highly prejudicial opinions are exactly what Plaintiffs
seek to present to the jurors in an early closing argument through the “credentialed”
Castleman. Such an “expert at best is offering a gratuitous opinion, and at worst is
exerting undue influence on the jury that would be subject to control under Rule 403.”
Hall, 93 F.3d at 1343. In similar circumstances, courts have asked, “If an expert does
nothing more than read exhibits, is there really any point in her testifying as an expert?”
Baldonado, 2012 WL 1802066, at *4 (citation omitted). As the many Daubert rulings show
and Castleman himself admits, the answer is emphatically “No.”
CONCLUSION
Castleman is not a qualified expert within the meaning of Rule 702 and Daubert.
He follows no scientific or principled methodology, and his opinions are not reliable

evidence to present to a jury. Instead, Castleman’s advocacy-driven testimony is
Owens-Illinois should be held liable because he feels the “asbestos industry is a quasicriminal industry in much of the world today, using its power to corrupt political
processes and control the media when challenged.” Castleman Cong. Test. 13, Mar. 1,
2007. His testimony will not help the jury to understand the evidence or decide issues.
For these reasons, Owens-Illinois, Inc. requests that this Court exclude Barry
Castleman Sc.D. from testifying at all or, alternatively, from testifying about the
knowledge and conduct of Owens-Illinois (e.g., what it knew or should have known)
and the fields in which he has little or no demonstrated expertise (e.g., medicine,
industrial hygiene, history, business ethics) under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).
