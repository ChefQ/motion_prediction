AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Defendant, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., (“Bank of America”), files this Response to
Plaintiffs’, NELSON CONIGLIO and JOYCE CONIGLIO (the “Coniglios”), Motion to Strike
Bond Copy Filing, and states:
1.

On November 10, 2014, Bank of America filed the Amended and Corrected

Motion to Vacate and Set Aside Default and Default Final Judgment (“Amended Motion to
Vacate”). As an exhibit to the Amended Motion to Vacate, Bank of America attached Call Logs
that were previously omitted due to a technical error during uploading of the previous Motion to
Vacate to the CM/ECF Document Filing System.. 1
2.

On December 4, 2014, this Court entered an Order denying Bank of America’s

Amended Motion to Vacate. 2
3.

Appeal (“Motion to Stay”). 3 As noted in the Motion to Stay, Bank of America is entitled to a
stay pursuant to the National Bank Act and under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.
4.

On December 11, 2014, Bank of America filed the Rule 59(e) Motion to Alter or

Amend Order on Amended and Corrected Motion to Vacate and Set Aside Default and Default
Final Judgment, and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (“Motion to Alter Order”) 4. In the
Motion to Alter Order, Bank of America notes that the Court seems to have inadvertently
overlooked the Call Logs Bank of America filed with the Court. Specifically, the Court
references the absence of the Call Logs in the filed materials when Bank of America had
previously filed the Call Logs with the Court as an exhibit to Bank of America’s Amended
Motion to Vacate.
5.

The Motion to Stay and the Motion to Alter Order have been fully briefed and are

currently pending before the Court.
6.

On December 16, 2014, Bank of America filed the Notice of Posting Copy of

Bond procured in the amount of $1,051,000, with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company as surety. 5
7.

On December 26, 2014, Bank of America filed the Notice of Appeal notifying the

Court that Bank of America is appealing the Final Judgment (ECF No. 18) and the Order on
Bank of America’s Motion to Set Aside Default and Modify or Vacate Default Judgment (ECF
31).
8.

The Coniglios have taken issue with Bank of America’s Notice of Posting Copy

of Bond and filed the Motion to Strike Bond Copy Filing 6.

9.

Bank of America procured the $1,051,000 bond in an abundance of caution.

Plaintiff is in no way prejudiced by Bank of America providing the Court with a copy of the
Bond and, to date, the Court has not required Bank of America to post a bond nor has the Court
set a bond amount. Further, Bank of America is within the bounds of the Middle District of
Florida Clerk’s Office Guide to Services and Procedures IV(c) as Bank of America asked the
Court to set and approve the bond in both the Motion to Stay and the Notice of Posting Copy of
Bond.
10.

Should the court deny the Motion for Stay, require a bond, and determine that a

bond amount higher than $1,051,000 is appropriate, Bank of America requests a reasonable time
period in order to comply.
WHEREFORE, Bank of America, N.A., respectfully requests that this Court deny the
relief sought in the Coniglios’ Motion to Strike Bond Copy Filing.
