07 Civ. 9931 (WHP)

DEFENDANT ROBERTSON’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF HIS
MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE PLAINTIFFS FROM PRESENTING
ROBERTSON’S DEPOSITION DESIGNATIONS IN THEIR CASE-IN-CHIEF
Defendant Michael Robertson (“Robertson”), by and through his undersigned counsel,
submits this memorandum of law in support of his motion in limine to preclude Plaintiffs from
presenting Robertson’s deposition designations in their case-in-chief. Robertson should not
testify twice in Plaintiffs’ case, once by deposition and once as an adverse witness. That is a
waste of jury time.
The parties finalized their draft of Proposed Joint Pretrial Order on August 30, 2013. In
the Proposed Joint Pretrial Order, Robertson indicated that he will be testifying in person in his
case-in-chief at trial. (See Proposed Joint Pretrial Order at 27 (“Michael Robertson (anticipated
in person)”)). Robertson fully intends to appear and testify at the upcoming trial. The Proposed
Joint Pretrial Order also states that “Plaintiff[s] anticipate[] Michael Robertson … will testify at
trial.” (Id. at 29).
Despite their own acknowledgement that Robertson will testify live at trial, Plaintiffs
submitted over 120 designations from Robertson’s depositions. It is expected that reading or
playing these deposition designations will take – and waste – significant time during trial.
Robertson objected to Plaintiffs’ attempt to offer the designated excerpts from his

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 402 Filed 09/18/13 Page 2 of 6

depositions because he will be testify live at trial. (See Proposed Joint Pretrial Order at 30
(“Robertson objects to the offering of the designated excerpts from his deposition since he will
be available to testify, and will testify, at trial”)). The Robertson deposition designations should
be excluded pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 403 (“FRE 403”).
I.

BECAUSE ROBERTSON WILL TESTIFY AT TRIAL DURING
PLAINTIFFS’ CASE-IN-CHIEF, THE COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE
PLAINTIFFS’ DESIGNATIONS OF HIS DEPOSITIONS PURSUANT TO
FRE 403
Under FRE 403, the Court “may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is

substantially outweighed by a danger of … undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting
cumulative evidence.” The rule authorizes the Court to exclude relevant evidence for “nothing
more harmful than merely wasting time…” FRE 403 Notes of Advisory Committee. That
description fits this situation like a glove.
A district court performing Rule 403 analysis “must balance the probative value of the
evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion and considerations of undue
delay.” Morris v. Eversley, 2004 WL 856301, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2004) (Chin, J.). The
balancing in this case is straightforward and simple: because Mr. Robertson will testify at trial –
indeed, as an adverse witness during Plaintiffs’ case-in-chief – precluding Plaintiffs from
presenting his deposition designations sacrifices no probative evidentiary value and will save
significant trial time. This straightforward balancing – coupled with the “preference for live
testimony [that] is well established in this Circuit,” Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. v. Deutsche Bank
Trust Co. Americas, 262 F.R.D. 293, 300 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing Napier v. Bossard, 102 F.2d
467, 469 (2d Cir. 1939) (Hand, L., J.)) – compels the conclusion that Mr. Robertson’s deposition
designations should be excluded at trial as cumulative and time wasting. Indeed, Judge Learned
Hand long ago noted that depositions are only “second best, not to be used when the original is at

hand.” Napier, 102 F.2d at 469.
In Dhyne v. Meiners Thriftway, Inc., the Eighth Circuit upheld a district court’s decision
to preclude the plaintiff from reading defendant corporate officer’s deposition testimony into
evidence when the witness was available to testify at trial and the plaintiff declined to call him.
184 F.3d 983, 989-90 (8th Cir. 1999). The Eighth Circuit observed that:
Many trial judges require that a deposed witness testify live, if available. The
reason for the practice is clear:
Judge Learned Hand proclaimed the deposition to be “second best, not to
be used when the original is at hand.” If possible, it is always better if the
jury can observe the witness firsthand to judge his or her demeanor.
Id. (quoting Loinaz v. EG & G, Inc., 910 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1990)).
Because Robertson will testify live as an adverse witness during Plaintiffs’ case-in-chief,
excluding his deposition designations risks no loss of relevant evidence. Indeed, the Eighth
Circuit concluded that requiring live testimony at trial “cannot possibly cause unfair prejudice,
because the party wishing to use deposition testimony can call the adverse witness live, impeach
him with the deposition if necessary, and even question the witness using the exact same
questions asked at the deposition.” Dhyne, 184 F.3d at 990; see Brazos River Auth. v. GE Ionics,
Inc., 469 F.3d 416, 434 (5th Cir. 2006) (“district courts are reluctant to allow the reading into
evidence of the rule 30(b)(6) deposition if the witness is available to testify at trial, and such
exclusion is usually deemed harmless error”); Jackson v. Chevron Chem. Co., 679 F.2d 463, 466
(5th Cir. 1982) (the deposition contained no information that the witness’s “live testimony could
not supply”).1

Federal courts considering this question in the context of non-party witnesses state the rule
more bluntly: “except for impeachment purposes, a party cannot introduce deposition testimony
of a witness who will be present and give live testimony at trial.” Truckstop.net, L.L.C. v. Sprint
Communications Co., L.P., 2010 WL 1248254, at *1 (D. Idaho Mar. 23, 2010); see Mazloum v.

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 402 Filed 09/18/13 Page 4 of 6

Presenting Robertson’s deposition designations at trial would only lead to “undue delay,”
“wasting time,” and “needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” FRE 403. For this reason and
“in the interest of judicial efficiency,” in Williams v. Jackson the court denied plaintiff’s request
to introduce defendants’ depositions at trial during his case-in-chief. 2011 WL 867528, *2 (E.D.
Ark. Mar. 14, 2011). The Williams court noted that defendants will be available to testify at trial,
and plaintiff is permitted to call defendants as witnesses.

Id.

Other courts also disfavor

duplicative testimony at trial. See, e.g., Rhead v. Mundy, 2005 WL 5994165, at *14-15 (S.D.
Cal. Oct. 21, 2005) (conditionally excluded preliminary hearing testimony as cumulative to
deposition testimony, allowing only portions of the hearing testimony to augment testimony or
impeach the witness); Schmidt v. Duo-Fast Corp., 1996 WL 238555, at *2 (E.D. Pa. May 7,
1996) (“The court will not admit deposition testimony, even from the instant action, if it is
unduly cumulative and will not add any information to that given in oral testimony by the
deponent[ ] and otherwise developed at [trial]”) (internal citation omitted).
While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32(a)(3) (formerly Rule 32(a)(2) until the 2007
amendment) permits the use of an adverse party’s deposition at trial, “Fed. R. Civ. P. 32, like all
other rules, does not operate in a vacuum, but instead is directly informed by Fed. R. Evid. 403
and 611(a), which confer clear authority upon District Courts in fashioning the presentation of
evidence.” Chretien v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 169 F.Supp.2d 670, 674 (S.D. Tex. 2001).
Therefore, a party cannot use Rule 32(a)(3) to circumvent Rule 403’s prohibition on cumulative
and time-wasting evidence presentation. See Williams, 2011 WL 867528, *2 (denying plaintiff’s
request, “in the interest of judicial efficiency,” to introduce designated portions of the
District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Dep’t, 248 F.R.D. 725, 727 (D.D.C. 2008) (“a party
cannot introduce the deposition testimony of a witness (other than for impeachment purposes)
who will, in fact, be present and giving live testimony at trial”) (citing Niver v. Travelers
Indemnity Co. of Illinois, 430 F.Supp.2d 852, 866 (N.D. Iowa 2006)).

defendants’ depositions at trial as testimony during his case-in-chief); accord Brazos River Auth.,
469 F.3d at 434 (“district courts are reluctant to allow the reading into evidence of the rule
30(b)(6) deposition if the witness is available to testify at trial”); Dhyne, 184 F.3d at 990
(upholding district court’s exclusion of party deposition when plaintiff could have called the
witness live); Jackson, 679 F.2d at 466 (deposition contained no information that the witness’s
“live testimony could not supply”).
Because no relevant testimony could be lost by excluding Robertson’s deposition
designations, and because presenting the designations during trial would lead to “undue delay,”
“wasting time,” and “needlessly presenting cumulative evidence,” the Rule 403 balancing and
the “preference for live testimony” favor excluding Robertson’s deposition designations at trial.2

If the Court denies this motion, Robertson respectfully requests leave to allow supplemental
and designation-specific objections and to offer counter designations. Robertson made general
objections to Plaintiffs’ designations of his depositions in the Proposed Joint Pretrial Order.
(Proposed Joint Pretrial Order at 30 (“Robertson objects to the offering of the designated
excerpts from his deposition since he will be available to testify, and will testify, at trial”); see
Proposed Joint Pretrial Order, Ex. A at 31-40). In addition, Robertson also objected to these
designations under FRE 403. (Id.). It was anticipated that the resolution of this motion in limine
would render cite-specific objections and counter designations moot.

CONCLUSION
For all the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Robertson’s motion in limine to
preclude Plaintiffs from introducing designations of Robertson’s depositions.
