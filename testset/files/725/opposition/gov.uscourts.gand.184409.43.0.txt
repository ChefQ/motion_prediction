Western World Insurance denies that it lacks standing to bring the claims it
has asserted against Nonprofits’ Insurance Alliance of California (“NIAC”) and
also denies that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over NIAC. In response to
such allegations, Western World incorporates herein by reference its Response of
Western World Insurance Company to Nonprofits’ Insurance Alliance of
California’s Motion to Dismiss, filed in this matter.
Without waiving such denials, Western World consents to the stay requested
by NIAC in its Motion to Stay Initial Disclosure Obligations and Discovery
Against It. Western World reserves the right to file a similar motion staying
discovery and disclosure obligations against it should it deem necessary to do so.
This 10th day of December, 2012.
