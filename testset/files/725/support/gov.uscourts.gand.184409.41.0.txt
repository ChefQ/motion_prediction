DEFENDANT NONPROFITS’ INSURANCE ALLIANCE
OF CALIFORNIA’S MOTION TO STAY INITIAL

(“NIAC”) and respectfully moves the Court to stay all discovery against it, as well
as NIAC’s obligation to submit initial disclosures in accordance with Local Rule

Case 1:12-cv-02117-AT Document 41 Filed 11/21/12 Page 2 of 7

26.1A,

pending

a

resolution

of

NIAC’s

Motion

to

Dismiss

filed

contemporaneously herewith.
NIAC shows that it has moved to dismiss the claims asserted against it on
the grounds that Plaintiff Western World Insurance Company (“Western World”)
lacks standing bring the claims it has asserted against NIAC because Western
World is neither a party to, nor a third-party beneficiary of, the policy with respect
to which it seeks a declaration. As such, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the
subject matter of those claims. In addition, NIAC shows that this Court lacks
personal jurisdiction over it. NIAC respectfully submits that it should be excused
from the burden and expense of participating in discovery and submitting initial
disclosures in this matter pending a ruling on its Motion to Dismiss.
In support of this Motion, NIAC relies upon its Brief in support hereof,
submitted contemporaneously herewith. For the Court’s convenience, a proposed
Order is attached to this Motion.
WHEREFORE, Defendant NIAC respectfully moves the Court to stay all
discovery as against it, as well as its obligation to submit initial disclosures,
pending a ruling on NIAC’s Motion to Dismiss.
