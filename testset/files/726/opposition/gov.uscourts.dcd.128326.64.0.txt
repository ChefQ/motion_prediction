FOR APPOINTMENT AS INTERIM LEAD CLASS COUNSEL
AND ROGER M. ADELMAN AS LIAISON CLASS COUNSEL
Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. (“Cohen Milstein”) and Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart Oliver & Hedges, LLP (“Quinn Emanuel”), joined by all undersigned counsel,
respectfully submit this memorandum in response to the Motion for Appointment of Whatley
Drake & Kallas, LLC as Interim Lead Class Counsel and Roger M. Adelman as Liaison Class
Counsel (hereafter, the “Whatley Drake Motion”) (Docket No. 41).

Quinn Emanuel should be appointed co-lead Interim Class Counsel on behalf of the proposed
direct purchaser class, and (ii) the Whatley Drake Motion should be denied.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
As set forth in the undersigned’s previously-filed Motion for Appointment of Cohen

Milstein and Quinn Emanuel as Co-Lead Interim Class Counsel (hereafter, the “Cohen Milstein /
Quinn Emanuel Motion”) (Docket No. 49), and the Memorandum in support thereof (Docket No.
50), the best interests of the proposed class would be served by the appointment of Cohen

Milstein and Quinn Emanuel as co-lead Interim Class Counsel under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 23(g), for the following reasons:
First, Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have spearheaded the identification and
investigation of the proposed class’s claims in this matter, developing the legal theories of the
case and unearthing the factual allegations pled by all plaintiffs, including Whatley Drake’s
client, West Alabama Sand & Gravel, Inc. 1
Second, Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have the superior experience, knowledge,
and resources to prosecute this case in the class’s best interests. 2
Third, Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have the support of nearly every plaintiff and
plaintiff’s counsel in this case, including many of the nation’s most experienced antitrust class
action litigators.
Fourth, Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have already demonstrated their ability to
lead this case on behalf of plaintiffs by, for example, informally representing all plaintiffs in
negotiations with defendants on preliminary matters.
In apparent recognition of these and other factors overwhelmingly supporting the
appointment of Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel as co-lead Interim Class Counsel, the
Whatley Drake Motion seeks only to add Whatley Drake as a third Interim Class Counsel. (See,
e.g., Memo in Support of Whatley Drake Motion (Docket No. 42) at 2) (advocating “a leadership
structure consisting of three interim lead class counsel”). Notwithstanding that Whatley Drake is
a reputable firm with certain strengths, there is simply no reason to add Whatley Drake to the
leadership structure in this particular case.

has done in identifying and or investigating potential claims in the action”).

Whatley Drake has not played any leadership role in identifying or investigating the
proposed class’s claims in this matter. Rather, as discussed below, Whatley Drake filed a
complaint that merely copied the factual allegations and legal theories contained in the
previously-filed complaints by plaintiffs that had retained, respectively, Quinn Emanuel and
Cohen Milstein.
Moreover, there are compelling reasons not to add Whatley Drake to the proposed twofirm leadership structure jointly proposed by all undersigned firms. Of the over fifty law firms
that have filed cases in this proceeding, many have at least as much experience in prosecuting
nationwide antitrust class actions as Whatley Drake (and some have significantly more
experience). Several of these experienced firms have already made substantial contributions to
the investigation and advancement of the class’s claims in this case. These firms, however,
chose not to seek appointment as lead Interim Class Counsel, and instead reached consensus on
the designation of Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel – and only those two firms – to serve as
co-lead Interim Class Counsel. There is a strong consensus here that the best interests of the
alleged class will be served by the proposed structure set forth in the Cohen Milstein / Quinn
Emanuel Motion, and Whatley Drake does not present any reason why the interests of the class
would be better served by burdening the proposed structure with a third co-lead firm and an
unnecessary “liaison” counsel.
II.

ARGUMENT
Notwithstanding that Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel were able to obtain the support

of nearly all plaintiffs and their counsel (i.e., over fifty law firms representing over twenty
plaintiffs), Whatley Drake has filed a competing application for Interim Class Counsel. Thus,
the Court must weigh the competing applications. See Fed. R. Civ. 23(g)(1)(A)(2) and (3). The

factors Rule 23(g)(1)(A) directs courts to consider in evaluating class counsel applications all
overwhelmingly favor granting the Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion, and denying the
Whatley Drake Motion.
A.

Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein Identified
and Investigated the Class’s Claims.

The first factor courts are directed to consider in weighing class counsel applications is:
“the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action.” Fed.
R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i). This factor decisively favors Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein.
These firms (and their co-counsel) developed the legal theories and all substantive factual
allegations contained in the complaints filed by all plaintiffs in these cases.
As discussed in the Memorandum in Support of the Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel
Motion, Quinn Emanuel filed the first complaint in this action, which reflected the firm’s trailblazing identification and five-month investigation of the potential claims of the class in this
action. 3 Cohen Milstein filed the first actions in this District, which were the first to name the
Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) as a Defendant. Thereafter, Quinn Emanuel and
Cohen Milstein both independently filed amended class action complaints on behalf of their
respective clients, reflecting their further investigation of the proposed class’s claims. No other
complaint filed in this matter – including the complaint filed by Whatley Drake – contains any
substantive factual allegation supporting the proposed class’s claims that did not first appear in a
Quinn Emanuel or Cohen Milstein complaint.

3

Quinn Emanuel’s Dust Pro complaint built upon a ruling by the Surface
Transportation Board in January, 2007, but substantially developed the facts and antitrust
theories applicable the class’s claims. See Dust Pro, Inc. Complaint, attached hereto as Exhibit
A.

This is evident when one compares the Whatley Drake (West Alabama Sand & Gravel,
Inc.) complaint to the earlier-filed Quinn Emanuel (Dust Pro, Inc.) and Cohen Milstein
(McIntyre Group, Ltd.) complaints. These three complaints are attached hereto as Exhibits A-C.
Thus, the Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein complaints set the template for this action.
However, as noted, Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein (and their co-counsel) continued to
develop the class’s claims after filing their original complaints, yielding amended class action
complaints which reflect the fruits of Quinn Emanuel’s and Cohen Milstein’s ongoing
independent investigations of the class’s claims. 4 These amended complaints contain additional
important factual allegations. They also correct certain factual matters (such as the date of key
collective action by defendants regarding fuel surcharges). This erroneous date remains
uncorrected in the Whatley Drake copycat complaint. 5
Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein were assisted in their investigations by co-counsel,
including, in particular, the firms that Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein intend to include
(subject to the Court’s approval) on an executive committee of plaintiff’s counsel. These firms
have worked closely over the past several months with industry experts, who have assisted
counsel in identifying facts supporting the plaintiffs’ claims. In contrast, the complaint of West
Alabama Sand and Gravel and its attorneys does not evince any independent identification or
development of any fact for the class’s benefit, either pre-filing or afterwards. 6

Whatley Drake represents that the firm has “Completed Substantial Work in
Identifying or Investigating Potential Claims in the Action,” but, respectfully, the only work
identified – discussing the case with their client and collecting invoices – is the type of work

Thus, this factor – “the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating the potential
claims in the action,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i) – overwhelmingly favors granting the Cohen
Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion, and denying the Whatley Drake Motion.
B.

Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein Have the Experience, Knowledge,
and Resources to Prosecute this Case in the Class’s Best Interests.

In determining lead counsel, courts should also consider “counsel’s experience in
handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the type asserted in the action;
counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and the resources that counsel will commit to
representing the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(ii), (iii), and (iv). These factors also
compellingly favor granting the Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion.
Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel present a combination that will uniquely benefit the
proposed class. Cohen Milstein has unparalleled experience in the plaintiffs’ antitrust bar, and
offers the resources of the largest antitrust class action practice in the bar. Quinn Emanuel is the
largest firm in the United States with a practice devoted exclusively to business litigation, and
offers the insights gained by representing both plaintiffs and defendants in complex class action
litigation. Both firms boast numerous trial successes. Quinn Emanuel lawyers have tried over
1175 cases, and won approximately 92 percent of them. When representing plaintiffs, Quinn
Emanuel’s lawyers have garnered over $6.2 billion in judgments and settlements. The firm has
won three 9-figure verdicts in the last five years, and secured three other 9-figure settlements
during the same period. Quinn Emanuel has substantial experience litigating antitrust actions
and other complex litigation, including class actions. Cohen Milstein successfully tried a recent
done as a matter of course in price-fixing cases. (Memo in Support of Whatley Drake Motion
(Docket No. 42) at 4.) Whatley Drake does not appear to dispute that it has merely copied all
substantive allegations on behalf of its client from Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein
complaints.

large antitrust class action in this very District. See In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, MDL No.
1285 (D.D.C.). Cohen Milstein is also based in the District, which renders appointment of any
separate liaison counsel unnecessary. 7
Aside from their demonstrated expertise in antitrust and class action law, both firms also
have demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the legal issues particular to the railroad
industry generally and fuel surcharges specifically. As discussed in the Memorandum in Support
of the Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion, Quinn Emanuel has worked closely with a law
firm with significant experience in railroad matters, and has retained a consultant with
knowledge of the rail industry and the role of fuel surcharges within the industry. (See Docket
No. 50 at 5.) Cohen Milstein’s amended complaints similarly reflect sophistication with legal
issues particular to the railroad industry. Additionally, Cohen Milstein offers the proposed class
insights gained from experience in leading the prosecution of antitrust class cases involving fuel
surcharges imposed by shippers of freight and cargo. For example, Cohen Milstein currently
serves as lead counsel on behalf of proposed classes in antitrust cases involving fuel surcharges
in the air cargo 8 and air passenger 9 industries. The knowledge gained from Cohen Milstein’s

7

As addressed further below, Whatley Drake provides no justification for adding
Roger M. Adelman as a liaison counsel in this case, particularly given that Whatley Drake does
not appear to contest Cohen Milstein’s appointment as Interim Class Counsel.

See In re Air Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., 240 F.R.D. 56, 58-59
(E.D.N.Y. 2006) (appointing Cohen Milstein as one of four Co-Lead Counsel).
9

In In re Int’l Air Transportation Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, Cohen Milstein
was appointed as one of two interim class counsel. See Docket No. 42, M:06-cv-01793-CRB
(N.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2006) (attached as Exhibit F).

involvement in related litigation involving fuel surcharges will contribute to its effective
representation of the proposed class in this case. 10
In stark contrast, although Whatley Drake has antitrust experience, Whatley Drake has
not demonstrated any significant expertise regarding the legal issues relevant to this particular
case. It bears note in this regard that numerous undersigned firms that have assisted Cohen
Milstein and Quinn Emanuel in their investigations in this case – including firms that would
serve on the executive committee – have demonstrated sophistication with the railroad industry
generally and fuel surcharges specifically. 11
C.

Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel have the Support
of Nearly Every Plaintiff and Firm in the Case.

As the signature block to this brief attests, Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel have the
support of nearly all of the plaintiffs and plaintiff’s firms in the case. In contrast, Whatley Drake
and Roger M. Adelman have only the support of their client and RB Rubber Products, Inc., a
plaintiff that only recently filed a tag-along action in this Court, and its counsel. 12
This support of nearly all plaintiffs and counsel is a compelling reason to (i) appoint
Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel as co-lead Interim Class Counsel, and (ii) deny the Whatley

10

In appointing Cohen Milstein Interim Class Counsel in In re Int’l Air
Transportation Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, Judge Breyer observed that Cohen Milstein’s
“involvement in and knowledge of related litigation will be an asset to the plaintiff class in this
litigation.” See id. at 1.
11

Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP (“Kaplan Fox”), for example, also serves as colead counsel in the air cargo fuel surcharge litigation. In re Air Cargo, 240 F.R.D. at 58. Kaplan
Fox is a proposed member of the executive committee.

RB Rubber Products, Inc. is represented by a firm that appears to specialize in
personal injury cases. See Schlichter Bogard & Denton website at: http://www.uselaws.com/.

Drake Motion to be added as a third Interim Class Counsel. Cf. In re Aluminum Phosphide
Antitrust Litig., Civ. A Nos. 93-2452, et al., 1994 WL 4818487, at *5, 7 (D. Kan. May 17, 1994)
(“In designating lead counsel, the court will also give due consideration to the preferences
expressed by the parties themselves, through their counsel … Absent persuasive evidence to the
contrary, the court assumes that nominations and votes for lead counsel are made in good faith
for reasons that benefit the client.”).
Most importantly, the near-universal support of plaintiffs and counsel reflects the
judgment of class members and prominent counsel that Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel –
and these two firms alone – have demonstrated that they will co-lead the prosecution of this case
in the proposed class’s best interests. These plaintiffs and their counsel have an incentive to
place this case in the hands of counsel who will prosecute the case most effectively for the class,
and thus their judgment should be credited.13 On the other hand, the lack of support for the
Whatley Drake Motion undermines Whatley Drake’s assertion that its addition as a third co-lead
is in the proposed class’s interests.
D.

Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have
Demonstrated Their Leadership Abilities in this Case.

Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have already distinguished themselves in this case by
representing plaintiffs’ counsel in negotiations with defense counsel on preliminary matters. The
efforts of Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein have led to: (i) the submission of the Joint Motion
for Entry of Pretrial Order No. 1 (Docket No. 5), a consensus proposal agreed to by all plaintiffs

13

Numerous Plaintiffs supporting Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein, including
US Magnesium LLC and Zinifex-Taylor Chemical, Inc., have very significant monetary claims
at issue in this litigation. (See Memo in Support of Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion
(Docket No. 50) at 15.)

and all defendants; and (ii) the submission of the Parties’ Joint Statement Pursuant to the Court’s
Initial Practice and Procedure Order (Docket No. 45).
Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein acted on behalf of all plaintiffs in developing
plaintiffs’ positions regarding the preliminary matters addressed in these submissions and in
negotiating with defendants. No plaintiff or firm objected to Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein
serving in this leadership role. Indeed, Whatley Drake expressly authorized Cohen Milstein to
sign and file both submissions on behalf of its client.
This demonstrated leadership ability confirms that Quinn Emanuel and Cohen Milstein
are able to work with all plaintiffs’ counsel in the case in an effective manner. See In re Payment
Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litig., No. MDL 05-1720, 2006 WL
2038650, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2006) (“The members of the group [appointed lead interim
class counsel] have already demonstrated their ability to work cooperatively with each other,
with the court, and, most importantly, with the numerous non-lead counsel representing plaintiffs
with very significant interests in this litigation.”). Additionally, the ability of these firms to reach
consensus with defense counsel on these preliminary matters indicates that they will prosecute
the case in an effective and vigorous, yet civil, manner and avoid needless contention. In
contrast, Whatley Drake has not demonstrated any similar leadership in this case.
E.

Adding a Third Interim Class Counsel Would Undermine
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Efforts to Reach Consensus.

It is widely recognized that it is desirable for plaintiffs’ counsel to reach consensus
among themselves about which firm or firms should be proposed for appointment as Interim
Class Counsel. See Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) (“Manual”) §10.22 (2007);
Newberg on Class Actions (4th) (“Newberg”) § 9:35 (2002). This approach, if successful, is best
for all involved. It allows plaintiffs to begin prosecuting the case on behalf of the proposed class
350754.1 1

10

Case 1:07-mc-00489-PLF

Document 64

Filed 02/29/2008

Page 11 of 22

without delay and allows parties and lawyers with experience and interests in the litigation to
determine what is in the best interests of the class.
There are numerous, prominent class action firms in this case. Indeed, it may fairly be
said that the firms in this case collectively have led the majority of the significant nationwide
antitrust class actions in federal courts in the past few decades. There are several firms in this
case that could have chosen to file their own motions for appointment as lead Interim Class
Counsel and would have been able to rely on relevant experience that at least matches, and often
exceeds, the experience of Whatley Drake. However, these firms agreed not to pursue such
competing applications in recognition of the fact that Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel had
demonstrated that they were best equipped to prosecute this particular case, in this particular
District, in the proposed class’s best interests.
It is no small matter that several dozen law firms here – many of them highly prominent
and experienced in the antitrust field – have agreed to work cooperatively for the good of their
clients and this multidistrict litigation. To award Whatley Drake a leadership position over these
firms would not only reward a firm that has played no identifiable role in developing the facts or
legal theories supporting this case (i.e., a firm that filed suit based on work product developed
painstakingly by others), but would also establish strong motivation for similar conduct in future
cases. This would make it increasingly difficult for plaintiffs’ counsel to achieve the laudable
goal of reaching case management consensus in multidistrict litigation.
Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel have proposed an executive committee of counsel
that would assist interim co-lead counsel in the fulfillment of their responsibilities as class
counsel. These five firms represent the counsel that Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel believe
are best prepared to assist the prosecution of the class’s claims in this case, based on their

participation in the case so far and their relevant experience, knowledge, and resources in
general:
Freed Kanner London & Millen LLC; 14
Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer, LLP; 15
Heins Mills & Olson, P.L.C.; 16
Carella, Byrne, Bain, Gilfillan, Cecchi, Stewart & Olstein; 17 and
Gold Bennett Cera & Sidener LLP. 18
As the attached firm resumes reflect, these firms have the experience, knowledge, and
resources to assist lead counsel in prosecuting this case on behalf of the proposed class. This is
potentially a very large case and defendants are represented by able counsel with substantial
resources. There will certainly be roles for more than just co-leads and executive committee
members to play on behalf of plaintiffs. 19 Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel are committed to
including multiple firms to work in this case while still prosecuting the claims as efficiently as
possible.
Accordingly, Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel respectfully request that, if the Court
grants the Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion, the Court also appoint the five firms

As noted in the undersigned’s opening papers, Cohen Milstein and Quinn
Emanuel contemplate a litigation structure that would include counsel serving on major
substantive committees. (See Memo in Support of Cohen Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion
(Docket No. 50) at 16.) Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel never intended, and still do not
intend, to exclude Whatley Drake from playing a role in the case.

identified above to the executive committee of plaintiffs’ counsel. The composition of this
executive committee, which reflects the judgment of Cohen Milstein and Quinn Emanuel as to
the five firms best suited to serve on that committee, is also supported by undersigned plaintiffs
and counsel. 20
F.

Cohen Milstein Can Perform Any Necessary Liaison Responsibilities.

As noted in the undersigned’s opening memorandum, Cohen Milstein’s appointment as
lead counsel would remove any need for appointing a separate liaison counsel, thus eliminating
inefficiencies and duplicative efforts. (See Memo in Support of Cohen Milstein / Quinn
Emanuel Motion (Docket No. 50) at 10.) The responsibilities of liaison counsel are primarily
administrative, and Cohen Milstein is more than capable of handling such responsibilities in the
course of serving as co-lead counsel. See Manual, § 10.221 (noting that liaison counsel is
“[c]harged with essentially administrative matters, such as communications between the court
and other counsel …, convening meetings of counsel, advising parties of developments, and
otherwise assisting in the coordination of activities and positions.”). It would be inefficient and
is unnecessary in this case to introduce a separate firm (or lawyer) to stand between co-lead
counsel and the Court and between co-lead counsel and other plaintiffs’ counsel.
Whatley Drake has made no serious attempt to support its proposal that Roger M.
Adelman be appointed as a separate liaison counsel. Although Mr. Adelman undoubtedly is a
fine lawyer, he appears to have limited experience in complex antitrust actions such as this one.

20

For the reasons set forth herein, it would also be unfair to the undersigned firms,
particularly those proposed as executive committee members, which have contributed to the case
to date and chosen to work toward a consensus proposal, if Whatley Drake were added to the
executive committee as a result of its motion.

Accordingly, to the extent the Court finds that a formal designation of liaison counsel is
warranted, Cohen Milstein should be so designated.
III.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, undersigned counsel respectfully request that the Cohen

Milstein / Quinn Emanuel Motion be granted, and the Whatley Drake Motion denied.
