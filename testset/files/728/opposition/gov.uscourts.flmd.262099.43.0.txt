MOTION TO DISMISS DEFENDANT’S COUNTERCLAIM
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff, Scriptfleet, Inc. (“Scriptfleet”), by counsel and

“Motion to Dismiss”) filed by Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant, Wendy Dobbins (“Dobbins”).
I.
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND FACTS1
Dobbins is an independent contractor who provided delivery equipment and services to
Scriptfleet

under

a

written

Independent

Contractor

Agreement

(the

“Agreement”).

Counterclaim, ¶ 2 (ECF No. 35). Under the Agreement, all parties understood that Dobbins was
an independent contractor who provided and maintained her own equipment for delivery
services. Agreement, ¶ 15 (ECF No. 36).

1

The facts in this brief are taken from Scriptfleet’s counterclaim, and they must, for purposes of Dobbins’ Motion to
Dismiss, be taken as true. Anthony Sterling, M.D. v. Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co., 519 F.Supp.2d 1195,
1208 (M.D. Fla. 2007).

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 2 of 18 PageID 234

On August 24, 2011, Dobbins filed a Complaint alleging she should be reclassified from
an independent contractor to an employee of Scriptfleet. Dobbins alleged that once she achieves
reclassification as an employee, she is entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards
Act (“FLSA”). On October 11, 2011, Dobbins, on behalf of herself and others, filed the
Amended Complaint (ECF No. 10) adding a claim that her independent contractor classification
violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (the “FDUTPA”). On February
23, 2012, upon motion by Scriptfleet, the Court dismissed Dobbins’ FDUTPA claim, leaving
only the original overtime claim.
Scriptfleet answered the Amended Complaint, denying Dobbins’ claims and asserting
Dobbins and other delivery drivers were properly classified as independent contractors.
Scriptfleet also filed the Counterclaim asserting that, to the extent Dobbins had been properly
classified as an independent contractor, she breached her written Agreement. Dobbins’ fullyexecuted Agreement was attached as an exhibit to Scriptfleet’s Answer, Affirmative Defenses
and Counterclaim. The Agreement provides that Dobbins agrees to:
defend, indemnify and hold harmless CARRIER from any direct, indirect and
consequential loss, damage, fine, expense, including reasonable attorney’s fees, action,
claim for injury to persons, including death, and damage to property which CARRIER
may incur arising out of or in connection with the operation of the Equipment,
CONTRACTOR’S obligations under this Agreement, or any breach by CONTRACTOR
of the terms of this Agreement. This provision shall remain in full force and effect both
during and after the termination of this Agreement.
Agreement, ¶ 13. Scriptfleet asserted in its Counterclaim that, based on the indemnification
language in the Agreement, Scriptfleet is entitled to indemnification from Dobbins for the
defense of Dobbins’ quest to be paid additional compensation. Counterclaim, ¶¶ 10-12.
The Agreement contains language that unambiguously shows the intent of the parties in
entering into the terms and conditions of this Agreement was that Dobbins, as a delivery driver,

2

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 3 of 18 PageID 235

would operate as an independent contractor. Agreement, ¶ 15. The most significant language
illustrating the intent of the parties is identified below:
The Agreement is titled “Independent Contractor Agreement.”
The Independent Contractor (Dobbins) must provide all equipment (including the
vehicle) and maintain it. Agreement, ¶ 9(a) & (b).
Specifically, the Independent Contractor must furnish all necessary oil, fuel, tires and
other parts, supplies and equipment necessary for the safe operation of the vehicle. Id., ¶
9(a).
The Independent Contractor must provide all repairs for the operation of the vehicle. Id.
The Independent Contractor is responsible for all fines incurred from operation of the
vehicle when the fine results at least partially from the acts or omissions of the
Independent Contractor. Id., ¶ 9(c).
The Independent Contractor is fully and solely responsible for selection, training, hiring,
disciplining, wages and salaries, and provision of benefits (among other responsibilities)
for any drivers or laborers they choose to utilize in the operation of a vehicle. Id., ¶ 15.
The Independent Contractor must maintain its or her own insurance policies for
automobile liability, worker’s compensation/occupational accident insurance, passenger
insurance, or any other form of insurance needed for operation of their vehicle. Id.,
Appendix B.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Scriptfleet filed its compulsory Counterclaim citing its right
to indemnification.

Specifically, Dobbins agreed to indemnify Scriptfleet for any “action”

against Scriptfleet “arising out of or in connection with” Dobbins’ “obligations under this
Agreement.” Agreement, ¶ 13. One of Dobbins’ obligations under the Agreement was to work

3

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 4 of 18 PageID 236

for a liquidated fee amount. Id., ¶ 3. Specifically, the Agreement holds that “[i]t is expressly
understood and agreed that CONTRACTOR’S compensation shall be as set forth in Appendix A,
and such compensation shall constitute the total compensation for everything furnished,
provided, or done by CONTRACTOR in connection with this Agreement, including driver’s
services.” Id.
Dobbins has alleged in her Complaint, via claims for overtime pay, that she is owed more
than the liquidated fee amount in the Agreement, providing Scriptfleet with a reasonable basis
for alleging that Dobbins’ lawsuit is an “action” against it “arising out of or in connection with”
Dobbins’ “obligations under the Agreement.” Id., ¶ 10. Thus far, Scriptfleet has incurred, and
will continue to incur, attorney fees and expenses in defending against Dobbins’ claims.
II.
ARGUMENT
Directly analogous case law involving an essentially identical set of facts shows that
Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is viable. Spellman v. American Eagle Express, Inc., 680 F.Supp.2d
188 (D.D.C. 2010). Dobbins nevertheless seeks to dismiss Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and argues that the Counterclaim is unlawful. Dobbins, however,
ignores well-settled law that requires her to take the facts asserted by Scriptfleet in its
Counterclaim (showing that Dobbins is an independent contractor) as true. Dobbins instead
improperly asks the Court to take her assertions (that she is an employee and therefore subject to
the FLSA) as true. Dobbins then relies on case law applicable only to employment relationships.
Taking Scriptfleet’s assertions as true, Scriptfleet simply seeks to hold Dobbins, an independent
contractor, to the Agreement she signed.

Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim for indemnification is

therefore viable and should stand.

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 5 of 18 PageID 237

A.
Motion to Dismiss Standard
In considering Dobbins’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the
Court may consider only the facts and allegations set forth in the pleadings and must accept as
true all of the factual allegations made by Scriptfleet. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89 (2007).
Specific facts are not necessary; the claimant need only give Plaintiff fair notice of what the
claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. Anthony Sterling, M.D. v. Provident Life and
Accident Insurance Co., 519 F.Supp.2d 1195, 1208 (M.D. Fla. 2007).
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted, factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to
relief above the speculative level when it is assumed that all allegations in the complaint are true
even if they are doubtful in fact. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007).
Further, “a well-pleaded Complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy Judge that actual proof
of those facts is improbable.” Id.
Here, Scriptfleet’s pleadings, including the Agreement attached to the pleadings, show
that Dobbins was an independent contractor who contractually agreed to indemnify Scriptfleet
for any expense incurred by Scriptfleet at the hands of Dobbins. Taking Scriptfleet’s allegations
as true, there is no FLSA violation and Scriptfleet is fully entitled to enforce the contractual
indemnity provision to which Dobbins agreed. As such, the Counterclaim cannot be dismissed.
B.
Scriptfleet’s Indemnification Counterclaim is a Viable Action
and Should Therefore Remain
Dobbins argues that Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim should be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because employers cannot seek indemnification under the FLSA for their FLSA
5

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 6 of 18 PageID 238

violations. Scriptfleet, however, is not seeking indemnification for FLSA violations but is
instead asserting a Counterclaim only to the extent Dobbins fails to prove she should be
reclassified.

As an independent contractor, the FLSA does not apply, and Scriptfleet’s

Counterclaim is viable. Therefore, the Counterclaim should stand and Dobbins’ Motion to
Dismiss should be denied.
1.
The Counterclaim Is Viable Because Dobbins Is Not An Employee
Dobbins argues that Scriptfleet may not assert a claim for contractual indemnification
because employers may not shift their liability for FLSA violations. Motion to Dismiss at 3-5.
This argument entirely misunderstands Scriptfleet’s position in this case, and ignores the fact that
Dobbins bears the burden of proving the existence of an employment relationship between her
and Scriptfleet before the FLSA even applies. See Doe v. Cin-Lan, Inc., No. 08-CV-12719, 2008
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107802, at *16 ( E.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2008) (court notes that, in order for the
plaintiff to prove her FLSA retaliation claim, she must show that: “(1) defendants took actions
constituting discrimination after [the plaintiff] filed her lawsuit; and (2) she is an employee.” Id.
at *16 (emphasis added).
Scriptfleet is not Dobbins’ employer under the FLSA and therefore is not subject to that
statute’s requirements. Similarly, Dobbins is not an employee under the FLSA and therefore is
not able to recover anything under the statute. See Baker v. Dataphase, Inc., 781 F. Supp. 724,
735 (D. Utah 1992) (dismissing FLSA overtime claim after finding worker to be an independent
contractor under “economic realities” test). These facts, pled in Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim and
shown through the Agreement, must be taken as true. See Aktieselskabet AF 21 November 2001
v. Fame Jeans, Inc., 525 F.3d 8, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Guantanamera Cigar Co. v. Corporacion

6

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 7 of 18 PageID 239

Habanos, SA, 672 F.Supp.2d 106, 108 (D.D.C. 2009). Taking these facts as true, it becomes
clear that Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is proper.
The 2010 Spellman decision provides the most analogous example in this regard. In
Spellman, a group of independent contractor delivery drivers sought to be reclassified as
employees and paid overtime under federal and state overtime provisions. The drivers, however,
signed independent contractor agreements containing indemnification provisions requiring
indemnification for any “action” against the defendant “arising out of or in connection with” the
plaintiffs’ “obligations under this Agreement.” 680 F.Supp.2d at 191.
The plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaim, arguing, like Dobbins argues in this
case, that employees cannot be forced to indemnify their employer for overtime violations. The
court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument and denied the motion to dismiss, recognizing “the crux”
of the lawsuit was overtime – i.e., the ability to receive additional money under the written
agreements. Id. The court then held that the defendant therefore had a reasonable basis for
alleging the lawsuit was an action arising out of the plaintiffs’ obligations under the written
agreements and the claim for indemnification must survive.

Id.

A substantially identical

situation exists in the present case, and the same result should follow.
Many other federal courts, including this very District, have also supported an employer’s
right to bring a counterclaim pursuant to the FLSA. Under the FLSA analysis, courts have
specifically enforced these provisions when the employer has been sued pursuant to the FLSA
and the counterclaim is compulsory and not baseless. Kentisch v. Madahcom, 566 F.Supp.2d
1343 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (allowing a breach of contract counterclaim to stand and denying the
plaintiff’s request to add a claim that the counterclaim was retaliatory under the FLSA); Ergo v.
International Merchants Services, 519 F.Supp.2d 765 (N.D. Ill. 2007). Courts have in fact

7

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 8 of 18 PageID 240

upheld claims for indemnification for analogous FLSA claims where indemnification arose from
a contract between the parties. Chao v. AKI Indus., Inc., 2007 WL 1839652 (D. Utah); Daniels
v. Bd. of Trustees of Herington Mun. Hosp., 841 F.Supp. 363 (D. Kan. 1993).2
The cases cited by Dobbins, at best, fail to support Dobbins’ position, and at worst, are
misleading. In each of those cases, there was no question that the plaintiff was an employee and
the defendant’s liability for violating the FLSA was already established. See Herman v. RSR
Sec. Services, 172 F.3d 132, 144 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[T]here is no right to contribution or
indemnification for employers held liable under the FLSA.”); Lyle v. Food Lion, Inc., 954 F.2d
984, 987 (4th Cir. N.C. 1992) (“Food Lion sought to indemnify itself against Tew for its own
violation of the FLSA, which the district court found, and we agree, is something the FLSA
simply will not allow.”); LeCompte v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 780 F.2d 1260, 1264 (5th Cir.
1986) (“No cause of action for indemnity by an employer against its employees who violate the
Act appears in the statute.”); Gustafson v. Bell Atl. Corp., 171 F.Supp.2d 311, 328 (S.D.N.Y.
2001) (after holding that the defendant was liable for violating the FLSA, the court observes
“there is no right to contribution or indemnification for employers held liable under the FLSA . . .
.”) (quoting Herman)
As an example of the serious over-reaching, one case relied on by Dobbins squarely
contradicts her position. In Martin v. Gingerbread House, Inc., 977 F.2d 1405 (10th Cir. 1992),
the Secretary of Labor brought suit against Gingerbread House, Inc. and its owners under the
FLSA alleging unlawful retaliation against employees of Gingerbread House. Id. at 1406. The
2

Because Dobbins filed a lawsuit alleging that she was misclassified as an independent contractor rather than
employee, Scriptfleet’s counterclaim based on the Independent Contractor Agreement was a compulsory
counterclaim required to be filed at the time of its responsive pleading for Scriptfleet to avoid the possibility of
waiving the counterclaim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a); Torres v. Gristede’s Operating Corp., 2008 WL 4054417 (S.D. N.Y.
2008 ). Scriptfleet simply protected its right to bring a cause of action based on the indemnification provisions of
the Agreements when the Court ultimately finds that the Agreements are enforceable and that Dobbins was an
independent contractor.

8

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 9 of 18 PageID 241

Secretary argued that the defendants unlawfully filed a third-party complaint seeking indemnity
from four employees, and that defendants discharged one of the employees in retaliation for the
cooperation she gave to the Department of Labor. Id. The district court found neither action to
be unlawful retaliation. Id.
On appeal, the Secretary argued that “third-party complaints for indemnity in FLSA cases
are baseless because they are preempted by the Supremacy Clause.” Id. at 1407. The Tenth
Circuit refused to side with the Secretary and instead held that the district court was correct in
permitting the defendant to litigate the indemnity claim because it was not baseless:
We hold that the filing of the third party complaint for indemnity was not baseless
as a matter of fact or law. . . . We affirm the district court’s conclusion that the
filing of the third party complaint was not unlawful retaliation under the FLSA.
Id. at 1408. Thus, under Gingerbread House, a claim for indemnity asserted by a defendant in
an FLSA case against its own employees is permissible so long as it is neither “baseless as a
matter of fact or law.” Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is therefore proper. See Spellman, 680
F.Supp.2d at 191. At least the Court must assume the truth of the allegations in that regard set
forth in Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim.
Further, Dobbins’ argument that the indemnity provision improperly shifts fees is
misplaced. Motion to Dismiss at 7 (citing Daugherty v. Encana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc., 2011 WL
2791338 (D. Col. July 15, 2011)).3 Such an argument was addressed head-on and rejected by
Spellman, which held that the counterclaim was not “preempted by, or contrary to the policy of,
the FLSA.” 680 F.Supp.2d at 191. Whatever the merits of Dobbins’ argument should the FLSA
apply, the facts laid out in Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim show that the FLSA does not apply due to
the independent contractor status of Dobbins. The Court must assume that Dobbins is not an
3

Daugherty is inapposite here because that case involved the enforceability of an arbitration agreement
and an attorney fee provision for a “prevailing party.”

9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 10 of 18 PageID 242

employee and does not have valid FLSA claims. Consequently, Congress’s decision to award
prevailing plaintiffs legal fees under the FLSA has no bearing whatsoever on Scriptfleet’s legal
fees in this case.

That question is a matter of the Agreement Dobbins entered into with

Scriptfleet, and it plainly entitles Scriptfleet to indemnification from Dobbins for such costs.
2.
The FLSA Does Not Apply To Independent Contractors
Contrary to Dobbins’ suggestions, federal courts construing the FLSA, including the
Supreme Court, have routinely acknowledged that Congress intended its protections to extend
only to employees, not independent contractors. See Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Co. v.
Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 602-03 (1944) (“Congress intended . . . to achieve a
uniform national policy of guaranteeing compensation for all work or employment engaged in by
employees covered by the [FLSA].”) (emphasis added); Int’l Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union v.
Donovan, 722 F.2d 795, 801 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“The [FLSA] established minimum hourly wages
for employees, limited the number of hours employees could work without receiving overtime
compensation, and prohibited oppressive child labor.”) (emphasis added); Marshall v. Hamburg
Shirt Corp., 577 F.2d 444, 446 (8th Cir. 1978) (“A fundamental purpose of the [FLSA] was to
encourage employers to distribute work among a larger number of employees rather than to work
employees overtime.”) (emphasis added).
Lacking on-point authority, Dobbins nevertheless argues that Gustafson v. Bell Atl.
Corp., 171 F.Supp.2d 311 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), supports her position. In Gustafson, the plaintiff
asserted claims arising under the FLSA and other statutes. The Southern District of New York
first held “that plaintiff was an employee of the Company for FLSA purposes.” Id. at 326. With
respect to the defendant’s contractual indemnification claim against a third party for the

10

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 11 of 18 PageID 243

company’s own violation, the Court subsequently held that the defendant “has no right to
indemnification for damages assessed under the FLSA.” Id. at 328 (citing Herman, 172 F.3d at
144).4 Thus, Gustafson stands for the unremarkable proposition that an employer found liable
under the FLSA may not seek indemnity from its employee; it does not support a broad public
policy abolishing all indemnity provisions in independent contractor agreements. That the Court
did not resolve the indemnity issue until after finding the plaintiff to be an employee actually
supports Scriptfleet’s position that it would be premature, at this early stage of litigation, to
dismiss the indemnity Counterclaim before a determination of Dobbins’ employment status is
made.
Similarly inapposite is Villareal v. El Chile, Inc., 601 F.Supp.2d 1011 (N.D. Ill. 2009),
another case relied on by Dobbins. In Villareal, the plaintiffs asserted a class action for allegedly
unpaid overtime and minimum wages under the FLSA. Id. at 1013. It was undisputed that the
plaintiffs were employees. Id. The defendants asserted a counterclaim for implied indemnity
under Illinois common law; it appears that there were no contracts between the plaintiffs and the
defendants. The Northern District of Illinois dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim for implied
indemnity, noting the general rule that an employer may not seek indemnity from its employees.
Id. at 1015-16 (citing Herman, Lyle, and Lecompte). Villareal is thus distinguishable on two
grounds. First, the plaintiffs were admittedly employees protected by the FLSA, and, second,
they sought implied indemnity under the common law of Illinois, not contractual indemnity
under a contract into which they voluntarily entered. Moreover, even if an employee is exempt
Dobbins improperly highlights, in boldface and by underline, the Gustafson court’s indication that the
status of the party from whom indemnification is sought is irrelevant. Motion to Dismiss at 4. Dobbins
infers that the statement prohibits indemnification regardless of whether Dobbins is an employee or an
independent contractor. The Gustafson court found no such thing. Rather, the court simply held that an
employer who had been found to have violated the FLSA could not seek indemnification for the
employer’s violation from a third party, regardless of whether the third party was a co-employer of the
employee. 171 F.Supp.2d at 328.
4

11

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 12 of 18 PageID 244

from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA, she is still protected from
retaliation under 29 U.S.C § 215(a)(3), and therefore entitled to protections under the FLSA that
independent contractors are not. See Dellinger v. Science Applic. Int’l Corp., 649 F.3d 226 (4th
Cir. 2011). Villareal simply does not support a broad public policy abolishing all indemnity
provisions in independent contractor agreements.
3.
Public Policy Supports enforcing the Terms of a Written Business Agreement
Between Consenting Parties
Alternatively, Dobbins argues that giving effect to the indemnity provisions would
discourage independent contractors from bringing claims under the FLSA because they might
face liability for the defendant’s legal fees and costs if their claims are unsuccessful. Motion to
Dismiss at 6-7. As a preliminary matter, Dobbins is an independent businesswoman who entered
into a commercial arrangement with Scriptfleet governed by the Agreement she signed. Courts
routinely enforce indemnity agreements between businesses in commercial contexts, holding
such businesspeople to the terms to which they previously assented and upon which the parties’
entire business, operational and financial relationship exists.

Enforcing such agreements

represents the essence of public policy, not a derogation of it.
The parties in this case specifically bargained pursuant to an independent contractor
relationship (Agreement, ¶ 15), set forth equipment to be provided at the independent
contractor’s expense (id., ¶ 9), related services to be provided by the independent contractor (id.,
¶¶ 1, 9), detailed the compensation and other payment to be provided by Scriptfleet (id., ¶ 3), laid
out the responsibilities for service failures and cargo claims (id., ¶¶ 6, 9-12), and expressly
agreed that the independent contractor controlled the means and methods of performance (id., ¶
15).
12

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 13 of 18 PageID 245

Scriptfleet consistently relies on the written bargain struck by the independent contractors
for federal regulatory and tax reporting purposes. In short, Scriptfleet’s entire relationship with
its contractors is built on the independent contractor nature of the relationship. Wiping away the
contractual remedy to which the parties agreed for an unsuccessful challenge to the independent
contractor relationship unjustly punishes Scriptfleet.
Quite simply, Dobbins ignores the overt disparity in placing Scriptfleet in a position to
rely on the Agreement and then, without even pleading for the rescission of the Agreement,
requests that it be ignored. Nor has Dobbins shown that the Agreement is unconscionable, an
issue on which she would bear the burden of proof. See Armstrong v. Accrediting Council for
Continuing Educ. & Training, 832 F.Supp. 419, 432 (D.D.C. 1993) (“To establish
unconscionability, plaintiff must prove not only that one of the parties lacked a meaningful
choice but also that the terms of the contract are unreasonably favorable to the other party.”)
(emphasis added). In other words, Dobbins ignores the harm to businesses like Scriptfleet and
instead claims she should get both the benefit of the Agreement and the benefit of employment
status (something expressly disclaimed in the Agreement).

In other words, Dobbins

impermissibly seeks to use the FLSA as a sword instead of a shield. See Wirtz v. Harrigill, 214
F. Supp. 813, 815 (S.D. Miss. 1963) (“This [FLSA] is designed and intended as a shield to
protect the unwary and not as a sword on which to impale an unsuspecting employer . . . .”).
Under the policy Dobbins proposes, a business like Scriptfleet would be estopped from
asserting a counterclaim seeking to enforce the terms of an independent contractor agreement for
fear of a retaliation claim under the FLSA. In this alternate reality, independent contractors
would have no disincentive to pursue baseless misclassification claims. Businesses and courts,
however, do stand to lose. Businesses would be forced to litigate employment status at summary

13

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 14 of 18 PageID 246

judgment, if not trial, with no prospect of recovering fees under the contract if successful.
Courts would see their dockets fill with such cases with no obvious settlement mechanisms
available to encourage prompt resolutions.

Thus, to the extent a ruling against Dobbins

discourages independent contractors from suing for employee-type benefits, this is a desirable
outcome. See Wirtz, 214 F. Supp. at 815.
C.
Dobbins’ Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Indemnification Clause
Dobbins executed the Agreement, including an agreement to indemnify Scriptfleet for
any “action” against Scriptfleet “arising out of or in connection with” Dobbins’ “obligations
under this Agreement.” Counterclaim, ¶ 8. One such “obligation” was the agreement to work for
a liquidated fee amount. See Agreement, ¶ 3 (“It is expressly understood and agreed that
CONTRACTOR’s compensation shall be as set forth in Appendix A and such compensation shall
constitute the total compensation for everything furnished, provided, or done by
CONTRACTOR in connection with this Agreement, including driver’s services.”). Dobbins has
alleged that Scriptfleet owes Dobbins and other independent contractors additional amounts for
overtime on the basis of misclassification. See Amended Complaint. Essentially, Dobbins
argues that she is owed more than the liquidated fee amount in the Agreement. Therefore,
Scriptfleet has a reasonable basis for alleging that this lawsuit is an “action” against it “arising
out of or in connection with” Dobbins’ “obligations under this Agreement.” Counterclaim, ¶ 8.
The Court in Spellman upheld an essentially identical provision under essentially
identical circumstances, holding that the plaintiff independent contractor’s wage claims fell
within the scope of the liquidated fee amount in the parties’ agreement.

Spellman, 680

F.Supp.2d at 191. As in Spellman, Scriptfleet’s indemnification Counterclaim is valid and

14

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 43 Filed 05/03/12 Page 15 of 18 PageID 247

applicable to the claims brought by an individual alleging she has been misclassified as an
independent contractor.5
At this time, Scriptfleet has a viable cause of action and there is most certainly a set of
circumstances under which Scriptfleet could plausibly recover. Because Scriptfleet is not an
employer attempting to obtain indemnification from its employee for its own violations of the
FLSA, the counterclaim is not unlawful or preempted under Martin and its similar line of cases.
In fact, the decision in Spellman provides a factually identical situation in which the Court
declined to dismiss an independent contractor’s attempt to dismiss an indemnification
counterclaim. When the Court takes as true the allegations set out in Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim,
it is clear that the Counterclaim is viable. Dobbins’ Motion to Dismiss the Counterclaim should
therefore be denied.
D.
Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is Not a Retaliatory Action
Dobbins argues that Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is “an act of unlawful retaliation.”
Motion to Dismiss at 7. However, Dobbins has neither asserted a claim of retaliation under the
FLSA in her Amended Complaint nor properly pled in the Motion to Dismiss the standard by
which a counterclaim is deemed retaliatory under the FLSA. Dobbins, instead, improperly
attempts to plead a retaliation claim via brief without the presence of a retaliation claim under the
5

The lone case Dobbins cites in support of her argument, Phelps v. 3PD, 2008 WL 4911909 (D. Ore.
Nov. 12, 2008), is inapposite. In that case, a wholly distinguishable indemnification provision was at
issue. Specifically, the indemnification provision in Phelps included “claims by others or by any
governmental authorities arising from or relating to [the plaintiff’s] relationship with [the plaintiff’s]
employees or substitutes” and to the plaintiff’s “acts or omissions resulting from or arising out of [the
plaintiff’s] operation of the Equipment.” Id. at *2. Understandably, the court in Phelps determined that
the provision did not cover reclassification claims but rather applied only to the plaintiff’s relationship
with the plaintiff’s own employees and the operation of the leased equipment. Id. In the present case, the
indemnification agreement is essentially identical to the enforced provision in Spellman, and it requires
indemnification for Dobbins’ breach of her obligations under the Agreement, including the liquidated
compensation amounts she agreed constituted full compensation.

FLSA within her Amended Complaint. See Gargano v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., No. 10–24042,
2011 WL 2445869, *3 (S.D. Fla. June 20, 2011) (improper to attempt to amend pleadings via
brief). Moreover, even if she could survive Gargano, Dobbins’ general citation to inapplicable
case law in support of deeming Scriptfleet’s action retaliatory fails to provide this Court with a
proper basis for dismissing Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim.
Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim comprises the exercise of Scriptfleet’s First Amendment right
to petition the government for redress of grievances.

Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v.

N.L.R.B., 461 U.S. 731, 741-43 (1983). Any attempt to prohibit the filing of a suit, including a
counterclaim, raises concern over restriction of the exercise of a protected right; a suit should not
be prohibited unless it is a mere sham filed for harassment purposes. Id. Due to the importance
of the right to bring a counterclaim, the filing of a counterclaim may only qualify as a retaliatory
adverse employment action if it is “totally baseless.” Munroe v. Partsbase, Inc., 2009 WL
413721 at *8 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 18, 2009); Ergo, 519 F. Supp. at 781; see also Steffes v. Stepan Co.,
144 F.3d 1070, 1075 (7th Cir. 1995) (“. . . except in rare cases, conduct occurring within the
scope of litigation does not provide grounds for a retaliation claim.”).
Here, Dobbins has simply cited to a number of cases involving retaliation6 without
recognition of the requirement that she make a showing that Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is
baseless in order to properly allege a claim for retaliation under the FLSA. In order to make
such a showing, Dobbins must show that the Counterclaim: (1) was filed for a retaliatory motive;
and (2) lacks a reasonable basis in fact or law. Munroe, 2009 WL 413721 at *8; Sederquist v.
Industrial Engineering & Developments, Inc., No. 8:11–cv–1084–T–26AEP, 2011 WL 3331307,

Several of the cases cited inexplicably involved analysis of retaliation claims under Title VII or the ADA, rather
than retaliation under the FLSA. See Plaintiff’s Brief, at 7-8 (citing to Jacques v. DiMarzio, 216 F.Supp.2d 139, 14143 (E.D. N.Y. 2002); Gliatta v. Tectum, Inc., 211 F.Supp.2d 992, 1008-09 (S.D. Ohio 2002); EEOC v. Outback
Steakhouse of Florida, 75 F. Supp. 2d 756, 760 (N.D. Ohio 1999).

*2 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 3, 2011). Dobbins has plainly failed to allege the necessary facts to establish
that the Counterclaim is “totally baseless.”
Even if she could establish a retaliatory motive, Dobbins would still have to make the
difficult showing that Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim lacks a reasonable basis in fact or law. Dobbins
could only make this showing if she established that there exists no genuine issue of material fact
within Scriptfleet’s counterclaim. Munroe, at *8. As discussed above, and as expressly held in
Spellman, Dobbins cannot and has not made such a showing.
Dobbins has failed to properly allege retaliation under the FLSA pursuant to 29 U.S.C.
215(a)(3). Not only has retaliation not been pled by Dobbins, but she has not recognized the
burden upon her to show that Scriptfleet’s Counterclaim is “totally baseless” in order to warrant
dismissal. Dobbins’ Motion to Dismiss the Counterclaim should therefore be denied, as should
any attempt by Dobbins to add a claim for retaliation under the FLSA via her Motion to Dismiss
the Counterclaim.
III.
CONCLUSION
The Spellman case analyzed an essentially identical indemnification provision and
considered the very same arguments Dobbins presents in this case. The court in Spellman
nevertheless rejected the plaintiff’s attempt to dismiss the counterclaim. The same result should
apply here. Scriptfleet therefore respectfully requests that this Court deny Dobbins’ Motion to
Dismiss the Counterclaim.
