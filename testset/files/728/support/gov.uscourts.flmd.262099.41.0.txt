CASE NO: 8:11-cv-1923-T-24AEP

v.
WENDY DOBBINS,
Counterclaim Defendant
______________________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DISMISS COUNTERCLAIM
Plaintiff, WENDY DOBBINS, by and through her undersigned counsel and pursuant to
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rules of the Middle District of Florida, requests
the entry of an Order dismissing Defendant’s Counterclaim, and states:
1. This is a collective action for overtime wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act
(“FLSA”).
1. Plaintiff was a driver employed by Defendant as a courier. D.E. 10 at ¶ 4.

Page 1 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 2 of 9 PageID 222

2. Plaintiff’s duties were non-exempt in nature and included driving and delivering various
goods for Defendant’s customers and completing all necessary paperwork associated with
such deliveries. D.E. 10 at ¶ 4.
3. Plaintiff and the other couriers worked consistently over 40 hours in a work week, but
Defendant never paid them time-and-a-half for their overtime hours because Defendant
misclassified them as independent contractors. D.E. 10 at ¶ 3, 5, 15-21.
4. In Response to the Amended Complaint, Defendant filed a Counterclaim. D.E. 35.
2. Defendant’s Counterclaim is for contractual indemnity. D.E. 35 at 13-15. In effect,
Defendant alleged that Plaintiff should be responsible for paying its attorney’s fees in
defense of the action. Id.
3. As a matter of law, Defendant’s Counterclaim must be dismissed. Counterclaims by
employers for indemnity for FLSA claims are strictly proscribed.
4. In addition, Defendant’s baseless Counterclaim is asserted in an attempt to intimidate
Plaintiff and others from vindicating their overtime rights.
5. Finally, allowing Defendant to obtain indemnification from Plaintiff for attorney’s fees is
antithetical to the FLSA, which allows for prevailing plaintiff attorney’s fees but requires
prevailing defendants to bear their own fees and costs.
6. For all of these reasons, Defendant’s Counterclaim must be dismissed, with prejudice.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, WENDY DOBBINS, requests the entry of an Order dismissing
the Counterclaim, with prejudice.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
I. Standard for Dismissing a Counterclaim
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, a counterclaim will be dismissed where it
Page 2 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 3 of 9 PageID 223

fails to state a claim a claim for relief, under the standards most recently enunciated by the
United States Supreme Court in Bell Atlantic v. Tomboy, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v.
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). Great American Assurance v. Sanchuk LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. Lexis
7477 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 23, 2012). A plausible claim for relief must include factual content that
allows the court to draw the inference that the defendant (or counterdefendant) is liable for the
alleged misconduct. Id. at *6 (citations omitted).
II. As a Matter of Law, No Claim for Indemnity Exists for Claims under the FLSA
Virtually every court which has considered the issue has rejected claims by employers
seeking indemnity for FLSA claims brought against them. Herman v. RSR Sec. Services Ltd.,
172 F.3d 132, 144 (2d Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal of indemnification claim for alleged FLSA
violations); Martin v. Gingerbread Houses, Inc., 977 F. 2d 1405, 1408 (10th Cir. 1992)
(affirming dismissal of employer’s third-party complaint seeking indemnity from employee for
alleged FLSA violations); Lyle v. Food Lion, 954 F. 2d 984, 987 (4th Cir. 1992) (affirming
dismissal of employer’s counterclaim for indemnity against the plaintiff’s FLSA claim);
LeCompte v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 780 F. 2d 1260, 1264 (5th Cir. 1986) (affirming dismissal of
employer’s cross-claim for indemnity of plaintiff’s claims under FLSA); see also, Goodman v.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 2012 U.S. Dist. Lexis 26401, *54 (S.D. N.Y.
Feb. 27, 2012) (dismissing defendant’s cross-claim for contractual indemnification for claims
brought pursuant to the FLSA); Villareal v. El Chile Inc., 601 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1016 (N.D. Ill.
2009) (dismissing with prejudice defendant’s counterclaim for indemnity with respect to the
plaintiff’s FLSA claim); Bailon v. Seok AM #1 Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. Lexis 114744 (W.D.
Wash. Dec. 9, 2009) (dismissing defendant’s counterclaim seeking indemnity for any liability for
plaintiff’s FLSA claims); Gustafson v. Bell Atlantic Corp., 171 F. 2d 311 (S.D. N.Y. Oct. 26,
Page 3 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 4 of 9 PageID 224

2001). Importantly, “no right to indemnification exists for employers under the FLSA” . . .
“regardless of the status of the party from whom [the employer] seeks contribution.”
Gustafson, supra, at * 38-39 (citing, Herman, supra, at 143) (internal brackets in original)
(emphasis added).
Courts have offered numerous reasons why an employer has no right to indemnification
for FLSA claims. “To engraft an indemnity action upon this otherwise comprehensive federal
statute [the FLSA] would . . .undermine employers’ incentive to abide by the Act, and would
differentiate among employees (entitled to receive overtime compensation in a way which does
not otherwise exist in the statute.” LeCompte, supra, at 1264.

In

addition,

because

the

FLSA “was designed to regulate the conduct of employers for the benefit of employees . . .
allowing indemnification in cases such as this would permit employers to contract away their
obligations under the FLSA, a result that flouts the purpose of the statute.” Gustafson, supra, at
328 (citing, Herman, supra at * 144); see also, Goodman, supra, at *54 (“a holding that the
indemnification clause is enforceable would indeed mean that employers would have little
reasons to be concerned over . . . [compliance] with the statutorily mandated and unwaivable
overtime pay requirements of the FLSA, knowing full well that if they are later found to have
violated such requirements, such employers would be totally compensated for any injuries
resulting from such action.”) (citing, Local 1035, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.
Pepsi Allied, 99 F.Supp.2d 219, 221 (D. Conn. 2000) (dismissing employer’s counterclaim to
enforce indemnification clause in collective bargaining agreement as to overtime violations
under the FLSA); Bailon, supra, at *9 (“[t]o rule otherwise would frustrate Congress’ purpose in
enacting the FLSA, since an employer who believed that any violation of the statute’s overtime .
. . provisions could be recovered from its employees would have a diminished incentive to
Page 4 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 5 of 9 PageID 225

comply with the statute.”) (citations omitted). Other courts note that a defendant may not bring a
counterclaim against an employee asserting his rights under the FLSA because it would violate
the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and “undermine Congress’ intent to
provide a remedy for workers cheated out of overtime pay.” Carda v. E.F. Oftedal & Sons, Inc.,
2005 U.S. Dist. Lexis 26373, *5 (D. S.D. Apr. 28, 2005) (citations omitted); see also, LeCompte,
supra at 164.
In the instant case, Defendant’s attempt to counterclaim against Plaintiff for
indemnification of her FLSA overtime claims must fail as a matter of law.

No right to

indemnification exists for employers under the FLSA. See supra. This is true whether the
employer seeks indemnification from a supervisor, co-owner, co-employee or the plaintiff
herself.

See, Gustafson, supra. To allow Defendant’s counterclaim would be in direct

contravention of the FLSA and Congress’ intent in enacting this comprehensive remedial statute.
See, LeCompte, Gustafson, Goodman, supra. In addition, the Supremacy Clause dictates that
Plaintiff’s FLSA rights preempt any contractual right to indemnification. See, LeCompte, Carda,
supra.
III. The Indemnification Provision at Issue Does not Cover Plaintiff’s Claims for
Unpaid Wages
Even if indemnity was recognized (which it is not, see supra), the indemnification
provision at issue does not cover Plaintiff’s claims for unpaid wages. Defendant’s sole basis
for alleging that Plaintiff is liable for its attorney’s fees is that the Agreement includes an
indemnification provision by which Defendant is indemnified from any “action” for “injury
to persons, including death, and damage to property” which Defendant incurs “arising out of
or in connection with” Plaintiff’s “obligations under this Agreement.” D.E. 35 at 14.

Page 5 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 6 of 9 PageID 226

However, any alleged damages suffered by Defendant in defending this lawsuit do not arise
out of Plaintiff’s obligations under the Agreement. Rather, the lawsuit concerns Defendant’s
obligations to properly compensate Plaintiff and others under the FLSA.
Considering an analogous contract, the court in Phelps v. 3PD, 2008 U.S. Dist. Lexis
92433 (D. Or. Nov. 12, 2008), rejected a similar counterclaim. In Phelps, the plaintiffs
alleged that the defendant unlawfully misclassified them and other similarly situated
employees as independent contractors. Id. at *2. The defendant asserted a counterclaim for
indemnification based upon an “Independent Contractor Operating Agreement (ICOA).” Id.
The ICOA stated that the “Contractor” indemnified the defendant from “claims . . . arising
from or relating to Contractor’s relationship with Contractor’s employee’s and from
“Contractor’s acts or omission resulting from or arising out of such Contractor’s operation of
the Equipment.” Id. at *4. Dismissing the defendant’s counterclaim, the court explained:
[The claims asserted by Plaintiffs are based on Defendant’s allegedly improper
classification of Plaintiffs as independent contractors rather than employees.
Such allegedly improper classification does not “aris[e] from or relat[e] to
[Plaintiffs’] relationship with [Plaintiffs’] employees,” ICOA § 3(f)(4), or from
Plaintiffs’ “omissions resulting from or arising out of . . . [the] operation of the
equipment.” ICOA § 4(e)).
Id. at *4-5.
In the instant case, Plaintiff’s claims that Defendant misclassified her and failed to pay
her proper wages arise out of Defendant’s actions, not Plaintiff’s.

Accordingly, the

indemnification provision does not apply.
IV. The Indemnification Violates the FLSA’s Provision for Prevailing Plaintiff Fees
While a successful plaintiff may recover attorney’s fees and costs under the FLSA, a
prevailing defendant remains responsible for its attorney’s fees. 29 U.S. C. § 216(b); Turlington

Page 6 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 7 of 9 PageID 227

v. Atlantic Gas Light & Co., 135 F. 3d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1998). Nevertheless, through its
Counterclaim, Defendant claims it is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to the indemnification
provision. However, the indemnification provision for fees would turn the FLSA’s prevailing
plaintiff fee provision on its head. Daugherty v. Encanca Oil & Gas (USA) Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist.
Lexis 76802, *33 (D. Col. July 15, 2011). A contract provision which provides a prevailing
defendant the right to recover attorney’s fees in an FLSA case has a “chilling effect . . . on
[p]laintiffs’ ability and willingness to attempt to press their claims under the FLSA . . .” Such a
fee-shifting provision “erect[s] impermissible obstacles to [p]laintiffs’ ability to avail themselves
of the rights and protections afforded by the FLSA” and is thus unenforceable. Id. at *33-34.
V. The Counterclaim in Retaliatory
Counterclaims, such as that filed by Defendant, are an act of unlawful retaliation. See,
Ramos v. Hoyle, 2009 U.S. Dist. Lexis 61062, n.9 (S.D. Fla. July 16, 2009) (court granted
summary judgment for plaintiff, finding that defendant’s counterclaim was filed in retaliation for
plaintiff’s FLSA claims); Obester v. Lucas Association, 2010 U.S. Dist. Lexis 144161, *233
(N.D. Ga. Aug. 2, 2010) (recommending plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment for retaliation
be granted because defendant’s counterclaim was retaliatory). Given the FLSA’s specific antiretaliation provision, 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3), counterclaims are particularly retaliatory in the
context of FLSA claims. Torres v. Gristede’s Operating Corp., 628 F.Supp 2d 447, 471-75 (S.D.
N.Y. 2008) (finding defendant’s counterclaim were asserted “to punish the Individual Plaintiffs
for joining the FLSA suit” and that Plaintiffs had established their claim of retaliation under the
FLSA); see also, Jacques v. DiMarzio, 216 F. Supp. 2d 139, 141-43 (E.D. N.Y. 2002)
(defendant’s counterclaims in ADA lawsuit found sua sponte to be retaliatory, dismissal and
sanctions issued, sua sponte); Gliatta v. Tectum Inc., 211 F.Supp. 2d 992, 1008-09 (S.D. Oh.
Page 7 of 9

Case 8:11-cv-01923-SCB-AEP Document 41 Filed 04/19/12 Page 8 of 9 PageID 228

2002) (counterclaim may constitute retaliation under Title VII); EEOC v. Outback Steakhouse of
Florida, 75 F.Supp.2d 756, 760 (N.D Oh. 1999) (same); see generally, Darveau v. Detecon, Inc.,
515 F. 3d 334-343 (4th Cir. 2008) (finding that plaintiff had validly alleged a claim for retaliation
under the FLSA where defendant responded to plaintiff’s complaint for unpaid wages by filing a
separate state court action against plaintiff); Zebroski v. Goulak, 2010 U.S. Dist. Lexis 30870, *3
(E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2010) (same).
In the instant case, Defendant should not be rewarded for its retaliatory conduct.
Accordingly, the Counterclaim should be dismissed.1
VI. Conclusion
For these reasons, Defendant’s Counterclaim must be dismissed with prejudice.
