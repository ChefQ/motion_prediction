Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 5 of 16

The Label Plaintiffs1 respectfully submit this memorandum of law in opposition to
Defendant Michael Robertson’s motion in limine to preclude the Label Plaintiffs from using their
two chosen representatives, Pat Shah and Dominic Pandiscia, to present corporate representative
testimony on the Label Plaintiffs’ behalf.
Robertson’s motion misleadingly suggests that the Label Plaintiffs are seeking to add
additional witnesses to testify on new topics. They are not. Rather, they have disclosed an intent
to substitute two different corporate personnel to testify as corporate representatives because one
of their previously-designated witnesses, Mark Piibe, is no longer employed by the Label
Plaintiffs. There is no prejudice to Robertson resulting from this substitution because
Defendants have already taken corporate representative testimony from the Label Plaintiffs on
the topics for which Mr. Piibe had previously been designated (as well as individual testimony
from Mr. Piibe).2 Because the identity of the corporate representative is, at most, of secondary
importance where a witness is testifying as a corporate representative, the substitution is
harmless to Robertson. Moreover, this witness substitution is an entirely justified and sensible
approach to dealing with the departure of an executive previously designated not only as a fact
witness, but also as a corporate representative.
Conversely, granting Robertson’s request would prejudice the Label Plaintiffs’ ability to
present their case – either by preventing them from offering corporate representative testimony
on certain topics at all simply because their previous designee has left the company, or by

1

The Label Plaintiffs consist of Capitol Records, Inc., Priority Records LLC, and EMI Christian
Music Group, Inc.
2

Robertson also challenges Plaintiffs’ right to designate Mr. Piibe’s deposition testimony if he
does not testify at trial. See Mem. Supp. Robertson’s Mot. in Limine (Dkt. No. 414) at 6-8.
However, there is no ripe dispute on this topic. Plaintiffs have not designated testimony from
Mr. Piibe as part of their case-in-chief. See JPTO Ex. A (Plaintiffs’ deposition designations).

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 6 of 16

requiring them to rely exclusively on the testimony of a former executive no longer under their
control to provide binding testimony on their behalf. Robertson’s motion should be denied.
BACKGROUND
Defendants served the Label Plaintiffs with a Rule 30(b)(6) notice of deposition on
January 17, 2010. See Defendants’ amended Rule 30(b)(6) notice of deposition directed to
Plaintiffs, dated January 17, 2010, attached hereto as Exhibit A to the Oct. 9, 2013 Decl. of Luke
C. Platzer in Opp. to Robertson’s Mot. Preclude Testimony from Corp. Reps. & Dep. Desigs. of
Mark Piibe (“Platzer Witness Decl.”). The Label Plaintiffs designated Mr. Piibe, at that time the
senior vice president and global head of digital business development at EMI Music North
America (“EMI”), to testify on their behalf as to two of the issues included in the deposition
notice: the damages incurred by the Label Plaintiffs as a result of Defendants’ infringement, and
the Label Plaintiffs’ dealings with third party companies providing online “locker services.” See
id., Ex. B (Piibe Dep. 4:24-5:2, 36:22-38:7, 57:6-21). Mr. Piibe’s deposition took place on
January 22, 2010, and included discussions of the Label Plaintiffs’ damages due to infringement.
Thereafter, Plaintiffs disclosed their intention to call Mr. Piibe at trial, a disclosure that was
memorialized in the initial Proposed Joint Pretrial Order filed with this court in April 2012. See
Platzer Witness Decl., Ex. D at 12. On December 31, 2012, Mr. Piibe separated his employment
from EMI and began working for another music label. Id. ¶ 6.
Because it was unclear at the time of the parties’ exchange of the Proposed Joint Pretrial
Order (“JPTO”) disclosures in August 2013 (and remains unclear today) whether it will be a
viable option for the Label Plaintiffs to continue to rely on Mr. Piibe to testify on their behalf,
the Label Plaintiffs disclosed Mr. Piibe as a potential trial witness, but also listed Messrs. Shah
and Pandiscia, two current executives who can speak to the topics on which the Label Plaintiffs
had originally designated Mr. Piibe, to avoid the risk that they would be left without a witness
2

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 7 of 16

capable of testifying to harm and damages issues. Id. ¶¶ 8-9. The Label Plaintiffs continue to
have discussions about Mr. Piibe’s willingness and availability to testify on the Label Plaintiffs’
behalf, and anticipate that he may still be willing and able to testify as a fact witness at trial, but
no longer as a corporate representative. Id. ¶ 11.
LEGAL STANDARD
Under Rule 37(c)(1), courts may not impose sanctions where a party’s failure to comply
with its Rule 26 disclosure obligations was “substantially justified” or where the conduct was
“harmless.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). A failure is substantially justified where there is
justification “to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person that parties could differ” as to
whether the party complied with its disclosure obligations or if there exists “a genuine dispute
concerning compliance.” AIG Global Asset Mgmt. Holdings Corp. v. Branch, No. 04 Civ. 8803
(RMB) (THK), 2005 WL 425494, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2005) (quotation marks omitted).
Harmlessness means “an absence of prejudice to the defendant.” Ritchie Risk-Linked Strategies
Trading (Ireland), Ltd. v. Coventry First LLC, 280 F.R.D. 147, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).
Even if the failure to disclose is not substantially justified or is not harmless, Rule
37(c)(1) preclusion sanctions are not automatic. See Design Strategy, Inc. v. Davis, 469 F.3d
284, 298 (2d Cir. 2006). Rather, the Second Circuit has warned that “[t]he refusal to allow [a
witness] to testify” is “an extreme sanction in any case,” and one which may have “an
excessively harsh effect.” Outley v. City of N.Y., 837 F.2d 587, 590 (2d Cir. 1988). Before
granting such a remedy, the court “should inquire more fully into the actual difficulties which
the violation causes, and must consider less drastic responses.” Id. at 591. Preclusion is not
warranted where the importance of the disclosure violation is “minor” and the prejudice suffered
by the opposing party is “negligible.” Harkabi v. SanDisk Corp., No. 08 Civ. 8203 (WHP),
2012 WL 826892, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2012); see also Outley, 837 F.2d at 590-91

ARGUMENT
I.

THE LABEL PLAINTIFFS’ ADDITION OF SHAH AND PANDISCIA AS
POTENTIAL WITNESSES SENSIBLY RESPONDS TO CHANGED
CIRCUMSTANCES.
The Label Plaintiffs’ proposal to add Messrs. Shah and Pandiscia as witnesses is a

perfectly sensible approach to dealing with the departure of a corporate executive previously
slated to testify on certain topics. At the time of Plaintiffs’ disclosures and up through the end of
discovery, the Label Plaintiffs planned to call Mr. Piibe to testify at trial, not only as a fact
witness, but also on the topics on which he had been the Label Plaintiffs’ 30(b)(6) designee;
particularly the Label Plaintiffs’ harm and damages due to the online infringement of their sound
recordings. Mr. Piibe’s possible unavailability arose long after discovery in this matter had
concluded and the parties had already exchanged witness lists in April 2012 with respect to the
previous iteration of the JPTO.
After the Court issued its decisions on the parties’ respective motions for reconsideration
(thus deciding the scope of the issues to be tried), Plaintiffs began preparing the case for trial
and thus began to focus on the possible unavailability of Mr. Piibe and its effect on their trial
preparation. Platzer Witness Decl. ¶ 10. Accordingly, they investigated possible witnesses who
might be able to fill Mr. Piibe’s role as corporate representative, and disclosed their intent to call
Messrs. Shah and Pandiscia in their JPTO disclosures, when witness designations were due. Id.;
see also JPTO at 27.

4

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 9 of 16

This was an entirely appropriate response to changed circumstances and does not warrant
the imposition of any sanctions. At the time of Mr. Piibe’s departure, the parties were briefing
their respective motions for reconsideration, and the issues that would ultimately need to be tried
by the jury (and thus the scope of the Label Plaintiffs’ needed trial preparation) was not yet
clear. After the motions were decided, the Label Plaintiffs disclosed their intention to use
additional corporate representatives because it was unclear whether Mr. Piibe would be willing
and able to testify on the Label Plaintiffs’ behalf as a fact witness, and it had become clear that
they would no longer be able to rely upon him to speak as their corporate representative. For
instance, Mr. Piibe’s employment by the Label Plaintiffs’ industry competitors may make it
difficult for the Label Plaintiffs’ counsel adequately to prepare him to testify, and could place
the Label Plaintiffs in the unusual and uncomfortable position of relying upon someone not
under their control to testify on their behalf as a corporate representative. Although it may be
possible to surmount those obstacles with respect to fact testimony from Mr. Piibe – and the
Label Plaintiffs have been engaged in a good-faith effort to do so, and now anticipate that Mr.
Piibe may be available to testify as a fact witness at trial – the Label Plaintiffs are perfectly
justified in designating alternate corporate representatives to fill the role Mr. Piibe can no longer
play. See Square D Co. v. Breakers Unlimited, Inc., No. 1:07–cv–806–WTL–JMS, 2009 WL
1702078, at *2 (S.D. Ind. June 11, 2009) (noting that it would be unreasonable to compel a Rule
30(b)(6) deponent to testify on a party’s behalf at trial if the deponent was no longer employed
by the party).
At most, Robertson is left with an argument that the Label Plaintiffs disclosed their
possible substitution of Messrs. Shah and Pandiscia for Mr. Piibe by way of their initial JPTO
disclosures (which is when witness designations are due under this Court’s rules), rather than by

5

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 10 of 16

way of serving new Rule 26(a) disclosures after Mr. Piibe left the company. Mem. Supp.
Robertson’s Mot. in Limine (Dkt. No. 414) at 4 (“Mot.”). Rule 26 requires disclosure of
individuals a party “may use to support its claims or defenses.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26.
Mr. Piibe was the appropriate witness to disclose in the earlier iteration of the JPTO filed
after the close of discovery. There was no reason for the Label Plaintiffs to revisit their witness
list or any of their pretrial submissions during the pendency of the Motion for Reconsideration.
However, after this Court, in its Reconsideration Order, finally determined the issues to be tried,
the Label Plaintiffs began their pretrial preparation this summer and identified and disclosed
possible substitute corporate witnesses in lieu of Mr. Piibe.
Because the scope of the issues to be tried was unclear until the Court issued its
reconsideration order in May, the pretrial disclosure process was a perfectly sensible time for
Plaintiffs to focus on the likely witnesses at trial. See Kingsway Fin. Servs., Inc. v.
Pricewaterhouse-Coopers LLP, No. 03 Civ. 5560 (RMB) (HBP), 2008 WL 5336700, at *9
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2008) (noting that Rule 26(e) disclosure obligations attached “[o]nce
plaintiffs became aware” that 30(b)(6) witness would be unable to provide “meaningful
testimony” regarding damages).
Therefore, since the applicable standard is merely whether “reasonable . . . parties could
differ” about the sufficiency of the Label Plaintiffs’ disclosures, there is no issue presented that
warrants judicial relief. AIG Global Asset Mgmt. Holdings, 2005 WL 425494, at *l; see also
Kansas v. Empire City Subway Co. (Ltd.), 692 F. Supp. 2d 316, 320 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (sanctions
not warranted where plaintiff had “plausible explanation” for alleged deficiencies in discovery).

II.

ROBERTSON CANNOT IDENTIFY ANY PREJUDICE THAT FLOWS FROM
THE DISCLOSURE OF SHAH AND PANDISCIA AS CORPORATE WITNESSES.
There is more than a touch of irony in the fact that Robertson’s current argument boils

down to an accusation that the Label Plaintiffs should have used supplemental Rule 26(a)
disclosures rather than pretrial disclosures to notify him of their proposed substitution of their
corporate representative witness, given the fact that Robertson’s own witness list contains
multiple surprise fact witnesses he never before disclosed – including witnesses he still has not
identified by name.3 Moreover, Robertson can point to no prejudice from the fact that the Label
Plaintiffs disclosed the addition of these two witnesses in their JPTO witness list, rather than in
supplemental Rule 26(a) disclosures a few months earlier.
The harmlessness arises because Messrs. Shah and Pandiscia are being called by the
Label Plaintiffs during the case in chief in order to testify regarding a topic, harm and damages,
on which Defendants had the opportunity to – and did – depose the Label Plaintiffs by way of a
Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. Because a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition represents the testimony of the
corporation, rather than that of a fact witness, the role of the corporate representative is to act as
the conduit for testimony regarding the collective knowledge of a corporation, rather than
simply regarding facts known to the witness from their own personal perception of relevant
events. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) (noting that a Rule 30(b)(6) witness “must testify about
information known or reasonably available to the organization”); Reilly v. Natwest Markets Grp.
Inc., 181 F.3d 253, 268 (2d Cir. 1999) (explaining that a corporation must “make available such
number of persons as will be able to give complete, knowledgeable, and binding answers on its
3

These omissions, unlike Plaintiffs’ substitution, have materially prejudiced Plaintiffs by
depriving them of any opportunity to take discovery or even know what the testimony is going to
be about, and Plaintiffs are accordingly moving to preclude their testimony. See Pls.’ Mem.
Supp. Mot. in Limine to Preclude Testimony from Undisclosed Third-Party Witnesses (Dkt. No.
428).

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 12 of 16

behalf”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Marvel
Enters., Inc., No. 01 CIV. 3016 (AGS) (HB), 2002 WL 1835439, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8,
2002) (summarizing the “substantial[] differen[ces]” between Rule 30(b)(6) depositions and
depositions of witnesses as individuals). Thus, Defendants have already had the opportunity to
depose the Label Plaintiffs on their claims regarding how and to what extent they have been
harmed by Defendants’ infringement of their copyrights when they deposed the Label Plaintiffs
by way of a 30(b)(6) deposition.
Moreover, to the extent Robertson wants to cross-examine Mr. Shah or Mr. Pandiscia at
trial, he can use the testimony of the Label Plaintiffs’ Rule 30(b)(6) representative on the
relevant topics – Mark Piibe – in order to do so. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3). There is no
reason Robertson would need to (or be entitled to) depose the Label Plaintiffs a second time, on
the same topics, simply because events had forced them to use different conduits to speak on
their behalf at trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30 advisory committee’s note (explaining that the
availability Rule 30(b)(6) witnesses should prevent “unnecessarily large numbers” of
organizations’ officers and agents from being deposed); In re Blackstone Partners, L.P., No. 04
Civ. 7757 (NRB), 2005 WL 1560505, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2005) (following corporation’s
30(b)(6) deposition, upholding quashing subpoena of additional corporate representatives as
“duplicative and cumulative”). Indeed, Robertson cannot articulate how this change in
witnesses would prejudice or even alter his trial preparation in any way whatsoever. See Outley,
837 F.2d at 591 (preclusion not required in absence of “a more definite showing of prejudice”);
Empire City Subway, 692 F. Supp. 2d at 321-22 (admitting undisclosed witnesses’ testimony in
light of its limited purpose).

8

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 13 of 16

Of course, this does not and should not limit Mr. Shah or Mr. Pandiscia to testifying only
to the matters about which Mr. Piibe was actually questioned by Defendants. See Mot. at 6 n.3,
7. Had Mr. Piibe remained employed by the Label Plaintiffs, his trial testimony would not have
been limited to the exact questions Defendants chose to ask him at his deposition in 2010. See
LG Elecs. v. Whirlpool Corp., No. 08 C 242, 2010 WL 3714992, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 14, 2010)
(30(b)(6) witnesses permitted to testify at trial as to matters beyond testimony actually provided
at depositions). The point is that Defendants have already had every opportunity to depose the
Label Plaintiffs on the topic of their claimed harm from Defendants’ infringement, and
Robertson thus cannot complain about the identity of the corporate representative speaking to
that issue at trial.
Moreover, beyond the fact that Robertson is not prejudiced by Mr. Pandiscia testifying in
a corporate representative capacity, Robertson has long been aware of Mr. Pandiscia’s identity
and the scope of his knowledge. During Defendants’ February 9, 2010 deposition of one of the
Label Plaintiffs’ other representatives, Sanford Schwartz, Mr. Pandiscia’s name appeared on
multiple deposition exhibits and Defendants asked questions about the scope of Mr. Pandiscia’s
involvement in and knowledge of issues relevant to this litigation. Platzer Witness Decl., Ex. C
(Schwartz Dep. 56:14-57:8, 61:24-62:10 & Exs. 19-20). Such awareness on Robertson’s part
represents independent grounds for allowing Mr. Pandiscia, in particular, to testify at trial. See
Fleet Capital Corp. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., No. 01 Civ. 1047 (AJP), 2002 WL
31108380, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2002) (“[A] failure to disclose witness information is
harmless if the other party was well aware of the identity of the undisclosed witness and the
scope of their knowledge well before trial.”) (quotation marks omitted); see also Preuss v.

9

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 14 of 16

Kolmar Labs., Inc., No. 10 Civ. 6375 (CS), 2013 WL 4766395, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2013)
(collecting cases).
In light of these practical realities, there is no valid argument that Robertson would have
altered his trial preparation in any way had the Label Plaintiffs provided Messrs. Shah’s and
Pandiscia’s names by way of supplementing their Rule 26(a) disclosures rather than by way of
their witness lists. See Mot. at 5. He could not have noticed their depositions because such
depositions would have been “duplicative and cumulative,” and his cross-examination at trial
will be unaffected. In re Blackstone Partners, L.P., 2005 WL 1560505, at *3. Defendants have
already taken 30(b)(6) depositions of the Label Plaintiffs on the very issue that Messrs. Shah and
Pandiscia would be testifying on behalf of the Label Plaintiffs. Mot. at 5-6; see also Webb, 2000
WL 347159, at *3 (no preclusion where defendants had been provided with reports and records
revealing content of undisclosed witnesses’ testimony). As a result, any benefit to Robertson
that could have been obtained by also deposing Messrs. Shah and Pandiscia on that same issue is
de minimis. See Webb, 2000 WL 347159, at *3 (“Even assuming that the defendants are not
already familiar with the substance of their proposed testimony, the defendants may adequately
prepare to meet their testimony in the time remaining prior to trial.”). Robertson points to no
case precluding a witness from testifying that involved even remotely similar facts.
III.

PRECLUDING THE LABEL PLAINTIFFS FROM OFFERING TESTIMONY
FROM THEIR CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE PREJUDICIAL.
The “extreme sanction” of witness preclusion is further unwarranted here because it

would prejudice the Label Plaintiffs by depriving them of their chosen corporate representatives
on the topics of damages and harm caused by Defendants’ infringement. Such preclusion would
have an impact on the Label Plaintiffs’ presentation disproportionate to Robertson’s claim that

10

Case 1:07-cv-09931-WHP-FM Document 467 Filed 10/10/13 Page 15 of 16

the Label Plaintiffs disclosed the substitution late. See, e.g., Harkabi, 2012 WL 826892, at *7;
Webb, 2000 WL 347159, at *3.
Precluding the Label Plaintiffs from designating their chosen representatives would either
deprive them of the ability to testify about harm and damages at all, or place them in the
untenable position of having to rely solely on the testimony of a former executive no longer
under their control. Contrary to Robertson’s claims to the contrary, see Mot. at 5, this approach
presents numerous obstacles. Although Mr. Piibe may now be willing to testify at trial in a
purely factual capacity, the fact that Mr. Piibe now works for a competitor could complicate
witness preparation, as it could entail the sharing with Mr. Piibe of confidential documents and
information in preparation for his testimony. Further, the fact that Mr. Piibe is no longer under
the Label Plaintiffs’ control raises serious questions about requiring Plaintiffs to be bound by the
testimony of someone no longer affiliated with them.4 These difficulties would be particularly
acute if Mr. Piibe were compelled to testify by way of a subpoena as Robertson suggests.
Although the Label Plaintiffs continue to investigate in good faith whether these obstacles can be
overcome, they should not be forced to endure them simply because their previously-designated
witness left the company long after discovery concluded.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Label Plaintiffs respectfully submit that Robertson’s
motion in limine to preclude the Label Plaintiffs from presenting at trial testimony from two

of its former officers, nor by a managing agent who is no longer in the employ of the
