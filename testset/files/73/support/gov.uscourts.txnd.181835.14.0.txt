Civil Action No. 3:08-cv-02050 (SAF)

MARK CUBAN'S MOTION FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Mark Cuban files this motion requesting that the Court take judicial notice of certain
documents cited in his motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(6) ("motion to dismiss"). Mr. Cuban's motion to dismiss is being filed on the
same day as the instant motion.
In deciding Mark Cuban's motion to dismiss, the Court may consider matters of which it
may take judicial notice. See FED. R. EVID. 201(f) (“Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of
the proceeding.”). The Fifth Circuit has held that when deciding a motion to dismiss a claim for
securities fraud on the pleadings – such as Mr. Cuban's motion to dismiss – a court may consider
“public disclosure documents required by law to be, and that have been, filed with the SEC, and
documents that the plaintiffs either possessed or knew about and upon which they relied in
bringing the suit” without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.

Acquisition Partners LP v. Blackwell, 440 F.3d 278, 286 (5th Cir. 2006); Lovelace v. Software
Spectrum Inc., 78 F.3d 1015, 1018 (5th Cir. 1996). In addition, "[w]hen a plaintiff quotes from a

Dockets.Justia.com

document used as a foundation for allegations in the complaint, the Court may examine the entire
document to review a motion to dismiss." Thornton v. Micrografx, Inc., 878 F.Supp. 931, 933
(N.D. Tex. 1995).
In considering Mr. Cuban's motion to dismiss, Mr. Cuban requests that the Court take
judicial notice of the following documents attached as exhibits to this motion:1
1.

Excerpt of Mamma.com Inc., Annual Report (Form 20-F) (May 14, 2004) (Ex. 1);

2.

Mark Cuban Schedule 13G (March 15, 2004) (Ex. 2);

3.

E-mail from David Goldman on June 28, 2004 (cited in Compl. ¶ 15) (Ex. 3);

4.

Excerpt of Mamma.com Inc., Annual Report (Form 20-F) (May 27, 2005) (Ex. 4);
and

5.

Mark Cuban Schedule 13G (July 1, 2004) (Ex. 5).

Exhibits 1, 2, 4, and 5 above are relevant public disclosure documents which were required to be
filed and were filed with the SEC, and are therefore appropriate for the Court's consideration.
Blackwell, 440 F.3d at 286; Lovelace, 78 F.3d at 1018. Exhibit 3 above is an e-mail quoted in
the Complaint (but was not attached to the Complaint). It is appropriate for the Court to take
judicial review of the e-mail because it is a document the SEC knew about and relied upon in
bringing this suit against Mr. Cuban, and the SEC quoted from it as a foundation of its
allegations in the Complaint. Blackwell, 440 F.3d at 286; Thornton, 878 F.Supp. at 933.
In the event that the Court is of the opinion that consideration of any of the documents
that are the subject of this motion would require the Court to treat Mr. Cuban's motion to dismiss
as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, Mr. Cuban withdraws his request for judicial
notice of those documents and asks that the Court not consider them in deciding his motion to
dismiss.

These documents are also contained in the Appendix to Mark Cuban's memorandum of law in
support of his motion to dismiss.

Conclusion
Under clear Fifth Circuit precedent, the Court may take judicial notice of SEC filings and
the e-mail quoted in the Complaint in deciding Mark Cuban's motion to dismiss without
converting his motion into a summary judgment motion. Therefore, Mark Cuban respectfully
requests that the Court grant his motion and take judicial notice of the documents listed above in
considering his motion to dismiss.

CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE
On January 14, 2009, I conferred with counsel for plaintiff, Kevin P. O'Rourke,
concerning the relief requested in this motion for judicial notice (the "Motion"). Mr. O'Rourke
stated that he was opposed to the relief requested in the Motion on the ground that until he
received Mr. Cuban's motion to dismiss and could review how the documents as to which
judicial notice is being sought are used in that motion, he was not in a position to make an
informed decision as to whether the relief requested in this Motion is appropriate.
