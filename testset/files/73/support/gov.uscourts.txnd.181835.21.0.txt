BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS

Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 creates fraud liability for conduct
involving a "deceptive device or contrivance" used "in connection with" the purchase or sale of
securities. In U.S. v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 (1997), the U.S. Supreme Court found that Section
10(b) permits liability for insider trading based on the misappropriation theory. Under that
theory, "a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell
securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the
exclusive use of that information." Jd. at 652. The Court emphasized, consistent with its earlier
insider trading rulings, that only if the defendant has breached a fiduciary or similar relationship
of trust and confidence can the defendant be found to have engaged in the requisite deception
through nondisclosure. Id.

In the context of a business relationship, a confidentiality agreement alone is insufficient
to create a fiduciary or similar relationship of trust and confidence between the parties. Under

both state and federal common law, a confidentiality agreement alone creates only an obligation

`to maintain the secrecy of the information, not a fiduciary or fiduciary-like duty to act loyally to
the source of the information. In the absence of any other facts or circumstances indicating the
existence of a fiduciary or similar relationship of trust and confidence, there can be no insider
trading liability based on the misappropriation theory pursuant to Section 10(b).

After the O'Hagan decision, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
promulgated Rule 10b5-2. 17 C.F.R. 0x00A7 240.10b5-2 (2002). The adopting release states that the
rule was desi ened to address when "a breach of a family or other non-business relationship may
give rise to liability under the misappropriation theory of insider trading." Selective Disclosure
and Insider Trading, 65 FR 51716 (Aug. 24, 2000). Federal courts likewise have found that
Rule 10b5-2 does not apply in the context of business relationships. See, e.g., SEC v. Talbot, 430
F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1061 n.91 (C.D. Cal. 2006).

Rule 10b5-2 purports to provide a non-exclusive list of three situations in which a person
is deemed to have a "duty of trust or confidence" for purposes of applying the theory. 17 C.F.R.
0x00A7 240.10b5-2 (2002) (preliminary note). The first situation in which a person is deemed to have
a "duty of trust or confidence" is "[w]henever a person agrees to maintain information in
confidence." Id. 0x00A7 240.10b5-2(b)(1).

Assuming that Rule 10b5-2(b)(1) is even applicable to business relationships, a
confidentiality agreement alone would be insufficient to establish the existence of a fiduciary or
similar relationship of trust and confidence. The SEC's use of the phrase "trust or confidence" in
Rule 10b5-2(b)(1), as opposed to the O'Hagan standard of "trust and confidence," suggests that
the SEC sought to go beyond the O'Hagan articulation of the misappropriation theory. If Rule
10b5-2(b)(1) creates potential liability based solely on the existence of a confidentiality

agreement, the rule is an invalid exercise of the agency's rulemaking authority. Interpreted in
 

this manner, Rule 10b5-2(b)(1) directly contradicts the Supreme Court's rulings on the scope of
Section 10(b) liability for insider trading because it would create liability without the existence
of a fiduciary or similar relationship of trust and confidence. The SEC does not have the
authority to adopt rules that impermissibly expand the scope of Section 10(b) liability. Santa Fe

Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U.S. 462 (1977); Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185
