MIKE ELDER,

Case No. 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ

PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS (Doc 42)
STATEMENT OF FACTS
This matter appears before the court as a result of defendant DRS’s fraudulent
timekeeping, subsequent overcharging of the United States government, and retaliatory conduct
directly aimed towards relator, now plaintiff, Mike Elder. Elder was employed by DRS and was
physically located in Afghanistan from 2007 until 2009. Despite being happy with his prior
employer and his work in Iraq, Elder accepted a position with defendant DRS only after DRS
approached Elder regarding an employment opportunity via unsolicited email. Within days of
Elder’s new employment with DRS, Elder observed practices that greatly troubled him. The
most troubling was DRS’s requirement that all employees charge 12 labor hours daily, regardless
of actual time worked. DRS’s retaliation towards Elder began very soon after Elder voiced
concerns, both verbal and in writing, regarding DRS’s timekeeping practices.

Retaliation

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 2 of 21 PageID# 302

continued in the form of deployments in highly combative and extremely dangerous locations
within Afghanistan, as well as deployments where there was little to no work for Elder to do.
DRS takes great liberty with the operative alleged facts in its motion to dismiss and brief
(Doc 43), which characterizations Elder disputes as inaccurate representations of the plaintiff’s
allegations. A more detailed statement of the alleged facts is relevant to the discussion of
various sections of the argument throughout this response. Rather than burdening the court with
duplicative statements of fact, the pertinent alleged facts are included in those sections.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should not be granted unless the complaint
fails to allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007). “A 12(b)(6) motion tests the
sufficiency of a complaint and ‘does not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a
claim, or the applicability of defenses.’” W. Ref. Yorktown, Inc. v. BP Corp. N. Am. Inc., 618 F.
Supp. 2d 513, 516 (E.D. Va. 2009) (quoting Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943,
952 (4th Cir.1992)). “Accordingly, a court should ‘assume the truth of all facts alleged in the
complaint and the existence of any fact that can be proved, consistent with the complaint's
allegations.’” Id., (quoting Eastern Shore Markets, Inc. v. J.D. Associates Ltd. Partnership, 213
F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir. 2000)). “Although the truth of the facts alleged is assumed, and
reasonable inferences are drawn in the plaintiffs favor, courts are not bound by the ‘legal
conclusions drawn from the facts’ and ‘need not accept as true unwarranted inferences,
unreasonable conclusions, or arguments.’” Id., (quoting Eastern Shore Markets, 213 F.3d at
180). “Ultimately, a complaint is sufficient if it provides the defendant sufficient notice of both
what the claim is and the grounds on which the claim rests, such that the plaintiff ‘raise[s] a right

2

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 3 of 21 PageID# 303

to relief above the speculative level.’” Id., (quoting Bell Atlantic, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct.
1955).
ARGUMENT
I.

ELDER ADEQUATELY PLED FACTS SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN A § 3730(h)
CLAIM
A.

FRCP 8 GOVERNS THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS FOR A
RETALIATION CLAIM

In reviewing the sufficiency of a retaliation claim brought under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h), this
court analyzes the claim in light of Rule 8, Fed. R. Civ. P. See Twigg v. Triple Canopy, Inc., WL
224511, *6 (E.D. Va. Jun. 2, 2010) (stating that, for retaliation claims brought under the False
Claims Act, “[t]he only question for the court here is the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s claims under
the Rule 8 pleading standard as articulated in Twombly and Iqbal”) (unpublished opinion);
Marion v. Rehabworks, Inc., 206 F.R.D. 643, 646 (E.D. Mo. 2001) (citing United States ex rel.
Lee v. SmithKline Beecham, Inc., 245 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2001)).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” in order
to “give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests.” While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion
to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations. [A] plaintiff's
obligation to provide the “grounds” of his “entitle[ment] to relief” requires
more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements
of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a
right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the
allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-65 (2007)
(internal citations omitted).
To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face.” A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content
that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is
liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a
3

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 4 of 21 PageID# 304

“probability requirement,” but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a
defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are
“merely consistent with” a defendant's liability, it “stops short of the line
between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-78, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (internal citations
omitted).
B.

ELDER ADEQUATELY MET THE RULE 8 REQUIREMENTS IN THE
ORIGINALLY-FILED COMPLAINT

“Claim” is defined as “the aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable
by a court.” Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009). For example, “the plaintiff’s short, plain
statement about the crash established the claim.” Id. “[T]he facts pled must ‘allow [ ] the court
to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.’” Romeo
v. APS Healthcare Bethesda, Inc., 876 F. Supp. 2d 577, 586 (D. Md. 2012) (quoting Iqbal, 566
U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009) (internal citations omitted)) (omission in original).
Accordingly, the aggregate of operative facts contained in the complaint must give rise to a right
enforceable by a court and allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is
liable for the alleged misconduct. See Blacks; Romeo 876 F. Supp. 2d at 586. “To properly
assert a [False Claims Act] retaliation claim, a plaintiff must offer facts sufficient to show: (1)
that the plaintiff engaged in protected activity under the [False Claims Act]; (2) that the
employer knew of the protected activity; and (3) that the employer retaliated against the plaintiff
as a result of those acts.” Twigg, WL 2245511, *5 (citing Eberhardt v. Integrated Design &
Constr., Inc., 167 F.3d 861, 866 (4th Cir. 1999)).
“[I]n this Circuit, a court can determine whether protected activity may have occurred by
looking to whether the plaintiff specifically alleged that the defendant's actions were illegal or
fraudulent. Mann v. Heckler & Koch Def., Inc., 639 F. Supp. 2d 619, 627 (E.D. Va. 2009), aff'd,

4

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 5 of 21 PageID# 305

630 F.3d 338 (4th Cir. 2010). “The Court will evaluate Plaintiff's allegations for these types
of statements. . . .” Id. (emphasis added). “[E]mployees engage in protected activity when they
meet . . . the ‘distinct possibility’ standard.” Mann v. Heckler & Koch Def., Inc., v. Integrated
Design Constr., Inc., 630 F.3d 338, 344 (4th Cir. 2010). “Under this standard, protected activity
occurs when an employee’s opposition to fraud takes place in a context where ‘litigation is a
distinct possibility, when the conduct reasonably could lead to a viable [False Claims Act]
action, or when . . . litigation is a reasonable possibility.’” Id. (quoting Eberhardt 167 F.3d at
869) (omission in original). ‘[A]n employee may put her employer on notice of possible False
Claims Act litigation by making internal reports that alert the employer to fraudulent or illegal
conduct.’ Guerrero v. Total Renal Care, Inc., EP-11-CV-449-KC, 2012 WL 899228, 7 (W.D.
Tex. Mar. 12, 2012) (unpublished opinion) (quoting U.S. ex rel. Sanchez v. Lymphatx, Inc., 596
F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir. 2010), and citing Eberhardt, 167 F.3d at 868–69 & n. 2 (stating the
once an employee expresses concerns about the likelihood of fraud to an employer, the notice
requirement is met)). “[T]he last element of [a False Claims Act] retaliation action is that the
plaintiff-employee suffered an adverse employment action on the basis of the protected activity
in which he engaged.” Weihua Huang v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 896 F. Supp. 2d
524, 552 (W.D. Va. 2012). “[T]he plaintiff must establish a causal connection between the
investigation of fraud against the government and the alleged retaliatory action.” Id.

“The

[False Claim Act’s] legislative history requires an employee to show that ‘the retaliation was
motivated, at least in part, by the employee's engaging in protected activity.’” Id. (quoting
Glynn v. Impact Science & Technology, Inc., 807 F.Supp.2d, 391, 415 (D. Md. 2011)).
In this case, Elder alleges a retaliation claim in the original complaint (hereinafter
“Complaint”):

5

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 6 of 21 PageID# 306

¶ 15. Relator Elder was physically located in Afghanistan from November of
2007 until he was sent home in October of 2009 and then subsequently
terminated for retaliatory reasons, in violation of subsection (h) of the
Act. ¶ 41. Soon thereafter, he began to complain, both verbally and in
writing, that some of the corporate practices of DRS were wrong, and
potentially illegal, as well as unethical. ¶ 42. The first such practice, and the
one that unsettled Relator most, was DRS’ habit of requiring all employees to
charge 12 hours daily, regardless of actual time worked. ¶ 43. Such practice
was fraudulent, resulted in the submission of false claims to the United
States Government, and resulted in funds being fraudulently and wrongfully
extracted from the United States Federal Treasury. ¶ 50. Relator initially
insisted that he work on Friday, though he would work alone with everyone
else back at Camp Eggers or otherwise going shopping or out to local bars. ¶
52. At one point, Relator actually began to meticulously document the
systemic overcharging by DRS employees. ¶ 53. The document enclosed
captures in detail the fraud perpetrated by DRS—employees always charging
for 12 hours of work, when they actually only worked about 5 or 6 hours a
day. ¶ 54. Relator first began to speak out about the over-charging concen to
Dan Roelof around the first part of December 2007. ¶ 55. He approached
Mr. Roelof saying that he wanted to work all day, and on Fridays or be
deployed into the field. ¶ 57. [Mr. Roelof] further added that Relator could
not be deployed into the field and that he lacked experience necessary to be
deployed. ¶ 60. The very next week, Relator was deployed into the field, to
Eastern Afghanistan. This action was targeted and directed at Relator as
retaliation for his whistle-blowing activities. ¶ 69. After Relator Elder
repeatedly expressed his concerns about the fraud going on at DRS, he
spent the last portion of his employment mostly in the field. ¶ 73. Later, he
was deployed to Barge Matal, a very dangerous area known for intense
fighting about the Taliban. ¶ 74. In fact, Ricky Ruiz, the DRS supervisor at
the time, even refused to give Relator a security report going into Barge

Matal a standard procedure before every mission. ¶ 75. Mr. Ruiz simply
told Relator Elder: “you’ll find out when you get there.” The retaliatory
nature of this directive was obvious and palpable to Relator. ¶ 96. That
Relator be awarded all damages necessary and appropriate pursuant to
subsection (h) of the Act.
Complaint at ¶¶ 15, 41-43, 50-55, 57, 60, 69, 73-75, 96 (emphases added).
Clearly, the aggregate of the operative facts contained in the Complaint gives rise to
retaliation and allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for
retaliation. See id., Black’s; Romeo 876 F. Supp. 2d at 586. Elder has alleged that he was
6

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 7 of 21 PageID# 307

engaged in protected activity, that defendant DRS knew of the protected activity, and that he
suffered retaliation motivated by the protected activity. See Complaint at ¶¶ 15, 41-43, 50-55,
57, 60, 69, 73-75, 96. Therefore, the Complaint does contain a retaliation claim. Due to the
aggregate nature of the operative facts, it should be irrelevant where within the Complaint the
retaliation claim actually occurs. See Black’s; Romeo 876 F. Supp. 2d at 586. Considering the
two Mann decisions together, Elder’s protected activity is established by analyzing the
allegations for the distinct possibility that the fraudulent conduct “reasonably could lead to a
viable [False Claims Act] action.” See Mann, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 627, Mann 630 F.3d at 344.
Elder’s allegations, taken as true, clearly establish that defendant DRS fraudulently recorded
employees’ labor resulting in overcharging the United States government. See Complaint at ¶¶
15, 41-43, 50-55, 57, 60, 69, 73-75, 96. The defendant knew of the protected activity once Elder
expressed concerns about the potential illegality of the time recording to the defendant. See
Guerrero, WL 899228 at 7. Additionally, Elder has pleaded that his deployment to the field in
Afghanistan was motivated by his complaints of fraud to his supervisor. See Weihua Huang, 896
F. Supp. 2d at 552. Thus, Elder states a claim for retaliation in the original Complaint.
Additionally, illustrative is this court’s opinion in Perry v. American Airlines, Inc., which
held that the plaintiff’s original complaint was sufficient to put the defendant on notice that the
employee intended to assert a specific cause of action. Perry v. American Airlines, Inc., 405
F.Supp.2d 700, 704-05 (E.D. Va. 2005).1 In Perry, this court determined whether the original
complaint met Rule 8, Fed. R. Civ. P., pleading requirements. Id. at 705.
Although Perry did not explicitly plead an FMLA claim in his original
complaint, he did reference the FMLA. Thus, paragraph 23 of the complaint
states: Mr. Perry had previously invoked the Family Medical Leave Act and
1
Admittedly, Perry does not attempt to establish a False Claims Act retaliation claim;
however, this court’s discussion with respect to pleading requirements is informative to this case.
7

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 8 of 21 PageID# 308

notified management that he would be spending time attending to his
disabled wife. And, in subsequent paragraphs, the original complaint pleads
facts that, if proven, would tend to show (i) that Perry's supervisor
discouraged him from taking FMLA leave; and (ii) that Perry suffered
adverse employment actions because he insisted on taking his full FMLA
leave. Thus, Perry's original complaint, liberally construed, arguably
references, if somewhat obliquely, the elements of an FMLA retaliation
claim. To be sure, Perry's original complaint was far from a model of clarity,
and his amended complaint now seeks to add numerous facts not pled in the
original complaint. Yet, construing the original complaint liberally in Perry's
favor, these new facts do not assert a new cause of action; rather, they simply
amplify the FMLA cause of action Perry inartfully attempted to plead in his
original complaint. Because Perry's original complaint (i) referenced the
FMLA explicitly and (ii) pled facts that, if proven, would be sufficient to
show a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the FMLA, American
was reasonably on notice that Perry was pursuing an FMLA cause of action
Id.
Applying Perry to his case, defendant DRS was reasonably on notice that Elder was
pursuing a retaliation claim. Elder explicitly referenced the False Claims Act, subsection (h),
and pled facts that, if proven, would be sufficient to show a prima facie case of retaliation in
violation of the False Claims Act, subsection (h). Id., see Complaint at ¶¶ 15, 41-43, 50-55, 57,
60, 69, 73-75, 96. Accordingly, when the Complaint is construed in Elder’s favor, it references
the elements of a False Claims Act retaliation claim. Id. Moreover, unlike Perry, Elder did not
add “numerous facts not pled in the original complaint.”2

Id., compare First Amended

Complaint (hereinafter “FAC”) at 3-12 with Complaint at 4-24 (omitting subsections a-uu of
paragraph 68 in the Complaint). Utilizing Perry’s logic and analysis, Elder’s Complaint was
sufficient to put the defendant on notice that he intended to assert a retaliation claim in violation
of the False Claims Act, subsection (h). Accordingly, Elder adequately met the Rule 8, Fed. R.
Civ. P., requirements as applied by this court in the Complaint.

C.

ELDER’S ORIGINAL § 3730(h) CLAIM WAS TIMELY FILED

As DRS correctly discusses in its memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss
(Doc 43), the applicable statute of limitations is the most closely-analogous state statute of
limitations to § 3730(h) claims. See Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 422 (2005). In footnote 3, Graham Cnty. Soil & Water
Conservation Dist. lists the most analogous state laws for each of the 50 states for purposes of
the statute of limitations. Id. 545 U.S. at 419 n.3. As established by this list, both Alabama and
Virginia provide a two-year statute of limitations period. Id. Therefore, regardless of which
state law governs this action, the applicable statute of limitations is two years.
In this case, Elder’s employment was terminated on November 9, 2009, and the
Complaint was filed on June 16, 2011. Thus, the Complaint was filed well within the two-year
statute of limitations. Accordingly, Elder’s § 3730(h) claim is timely, without any need to
discuss the issue of relation back.
II.

DRS IS WRONG TO ASSERT THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT IS THE
FIRST TIME ELDER EVER COMPLAINED OF RETALITORY CONDUCT
Defendant DRS exclusively relies on paragraphs in Elder’s First Amended Complaint

(“FAC”) as being the first instances of alleged retaliatory conduct.

In truth, all of these

paragraphs in the FAC that Defendant cites to support this assertion, except one, are nearly
verbatim to the paragraphs in the Complaint. For example, DRS cites paragraph 56 of the FAC
for the proposition that “[p]laintiff now claims the granting of his request was retaliation for his
complaint about overcharging.” See Defendant’s Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion
to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (Doc 43), at 3 (hereinafter “Motion to
Dismiss”).
9

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 10 of 21 PageID# 310

Paragraph 56 states, “[t]he very next week, Elder was deployed into the field, to eastern
Afghanistan. This action was targeted and directed at Elder as retaliation for his whistle-blowing
activities, in violation of subsection 3730(h) of the Act.” See FAC at ¶ 56. Comparatively,
paragraph 60 of the original complaint states, “[t]he very next week, Elder was deployed into the
field, to eastern Afghanistan. This action was targeted and directed at Elder as retaliation for
his whistle-blowing activities.” See Complaint at ¶ 60 (emphasis added). As another example,
DRS states, “[p]laintiff’s employment was terminated in November 2009, more than three years
before he first brought a cause of action under § 3730(h),” and exclusively cites paragraph 11 of
the FAC. See Motion to Dismiss at 5. Paragraph 11 of the FAC states, “Elder was employed by
Defendant, DRS Technologies, Inc., from October 22, 2007, until November 9, 2009.” See FAC
at ¶ 11.

Again, comparatively, paragraph 14 of the Complaint states, “Relator Elder was

employed by Defendant, DRS technologies, Inc. from October 22, 2007 until November 9,
2009.” See Complaint at ¶ 14.
DRS ignores paragraph 15 of the Complaint, which explicitly states that defendant
violated § 3730(h). See Complaint at ¶ 15 (“Relator Elder was physically located in Afghanistan
from November of 2007 until he was sent home in October of 2009 and then subsequently
terminated for retaliatory reasons, in violation of subsection (h) of the Act.”) (emphasis
added). Additionally, Paragraph 96 of the Complaint states: That Relator be awarded all
damages necessary and appropriate pursuant to subsection (h) of the Act. See Complaint at
¶ 96 (emphasis added). Finally, defendant cites paragraphs 66 and 69 in the FAC stating that
two deployments were assigned as retaliation for Relator’s complaints. See Motion to Dismiss at
3. Paragraphs 66 and 69 in the FAC appear in substantially similar terms as paragraphs 70 and
73, respectively, of the Complaint. See Complaint at ¶¶ 70, 73. In fact, the only paragraph on

10

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 11 of 21 PageID# 311

which defendant relies for the argument that Relator first alleges retaliatory conduct in the FAC
is paragraph 77. See Motion to Dismiss at 3.
Accordingly, defendant’s argument that Elder first alleges retaliatory conduct in the FAC
is demonstrably untrue. Furthermore, comparatively, Elder’s FAC is substantively similar to the
Complaint. Specifically, paragraphs 10-76 of the FAC are substantially similar, if not identical,
to paragraphs 13-80 of the Complaint. Compare FAC at 3-12 with Complaint at 4-24 (omitting
subsections a-uu of paragraph 68 in the Complaint). Contrary to defendant’s argument, it is clear
that Elder first alleges a retaliation claim in the original Complaint and not in the FAC.
III.

ALTERNATIVELY, FRCP 15(c)(1)(B) AND THE RELATION BACK DOCTRINE
PERMITS THE FAC TO RELATE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT
Even if the original Complaint fails to completely state a claim for retaliation under

subsection (h), it comes so close that the pleading in the FAC relates back to the date of the
original complaint, for statute of limitations purposes. Other district courts have applied Rule
15(c)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P., to claims brought under the False Claims Act. See e.g., U.S. ex rel.
Repko v. Guthrie Clinic, P.C., 557 F.Supp.2d 522, 530 (M.D. Pa. 2008), U.S. v. Omnicare, Inc.,
No. 07 C 577, WL 1059148, *7 (N.D. Ill. March 21, 2011) (memorandum opinion and order);
see also Vitullo v. Mancini, 684 F.Supp.2d 747, 754 (E.D. Va. 2010) (explaining this circuit’s
application of Rule 15(c)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P.). Accordingly, Rule 15(c)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P.,
governs the determination of whether, in this case, the FAC relates back to the Complaint.
Rule 15(c)(1)(B) allows an amendment to relate back to the original pleading when “the
amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set
out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P.
“To determine whether an amended pleading relates back, a court must first ascertain whether a
factual nexus exists between the amendment and the original complaint.” Marks Const. Co., Inc.
11

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 12 of 21 PageID# 312

v. Huntington Nat. Bank, 614 F. Supp. 2d 700, 712 (N.D. W.Va. 2009) (citing Grattan v.
Burnett, 710 F.2d 160, 163 (4th Cir. 1983)). “If there is some factual nexus an amended claim is
liberally construed to relate back to the original complaint if the defendant had notice of
the claim and will not be prejudiced by the amendment.” Grattan v. Burnett, 710 F.2d 160, 163
(4th Cir. 1983) aff’d. 468 U.S. 42, 104 S. Ct. 2924, (1984) (internal citation omitted) (emphasis
added); see also Florida Steel Corp. v. New Jersey Steel Corp., 966 F.2d 1442, WL 119864, (4th
Cir. 1992) (unpublished opinion) (“The ‘linchpin’ of this provision is notice.”). “[W]here, [ ] the
amendment pleads a new cause of action, the amendment is not deemed prejudicial ‘if it merely
adds an additional theory of recovery to the facts already pled and is offered before any
discovery has occurred.” Vitullo, 684 F.Supp.2d at 754 (quoting Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d 404,
427 (4th Cir. 2006)).
In U. S. ex rel. Cericola v. Fed. Nat’l Mortgage Assoc., the court allowed the relator to
add allegations to his False Claims Act claim after the government declined to intervene and the
statute of limitations had expired. See U.S. ex rel. Cericola v. Fed. Nat’l Mortgage Assoc., 529
F.Supp.2d 1139, 1150 (C.D.Cal. 2007). “Such an interpretation is appealing; otherwise, the
government could render a relator’s timely filed claims time-barred by its own delay.” U.S. ex
rel. Deering v. Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., 601 F.Supp.2d 368, 376 (D. Mass. 2009). “The
argument is even stronger when the relator seeks to add personal claims rather than flesh out a
false claims charge brought on behalf of the government. . . .” Id.
In this case, even if the court determines that Elder did not adequately plead a retaliation
claim in the Complaint, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) applies to allow Elder’s FAC to relate back to the date
of the original Complaint. See Vitullo, 684 F.Supp.2d at 754. There is a factual nexus between
the counts of the FAC and the counts of the Complaint because all of the counts plead violations

12

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 13 of 21 PageID# 313

of the False Claims Act. See id. (explaining that “these counts all plead FDCPA violations . . .
and hence the amendments ‘[a]rise out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-or
attempted to be set out-in the original pleading’ (quoting Rule 15(c)(1)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P.)).
Applying Vitullo to this case, it is clear that both the counts of the Complaint and the count in the
FAC arise out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out–or attempted to be set out–in the
original pleading. See id.; compare FAC at 13-15 with Complaint at 24-27. Moreover, the
defendant had notice of Elder’s retaliation claim. See supra at 6-8. Therefore, because there is a
factual nexus between the counts of the FAC and the counts of the Complaint, and because the
defendant was on notice of Elder’s retaliation claim, the FAC should be construed liberally to
relate back to the date of the Complaint.
In its reliance on U.S. ex rel. Deering, the defendant glaringly overlooks a key difference
between that case and this case. In U.S. ex rel. Deering, the court notes that:
The allegations pleaded in the original complaint do not suggest the
possibility that the defendants could face additional claims for retaliation . . . .
The original complaint contains no hint that PA took any adverse action
against Deering for engaging in protected conduct–indeed, it does not even
identify Deering as an employee of PA . . . . Thus, the new claims do not
arise out of the “conduct, transaction, or occurrence” underlying the FCA
fraud claim.
U.S. ex rel. Deering, F.Supp.2d at 377 (internal citation omitted).
In contrast, not only does the Complaint identify Elder as an employee of the defendant,
it also more than hints that defendant DRS took adverse action against Elder. See Complaint at
¶¶ 15, 41-43, 50-55, 57, 60, 69, 73-75, 96. Applying U.S. ex rel. Deering to this case, it is clear
that the retaliation claim arises out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence underlying the
fraud claims of the Complaint. See U.S. ex rel. Deering, F.Supp.2d at 377. Furthermore, the
Complaint explicitly references § 3730(h) and Elder pled facts that, if proven, would be

13

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 14 of 21 PageID# 314

sufficient to show a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the False Claims Act subsection
(h). See Complaint at ¶¶ 15, 41-43, 50-55, 57, 60, 69, 73-75, 96; see also Perry v. American
Airlines, Inc., 405 F.Supp.2d 700, 704-05 (E.D. Va. 2005). Thus, Elder’s Complaint was
sufficient to put the defendant on notice that he intended to assert a retaliation claim in violation
of the False Claims Act, subsection (h). Id. Accordingly, there should be no question that the
FAC relates back to the date of the Complaint.
IV.

ELDER ADEQUATELY ALLEGES CAUSATION AS TO DRS’S FRAUDULENT
CONDUCT AND RETAILATION
Elder first urges that this fact-intensive and subjective causation question is not even a

serious issue at the motion to dismiss stage. Heckenlaible v. Virginia Peninsula Reg'l Jail Auth.,
491 F. Supp. 2d 544, 555 (E.D. Va. 2007), cites Virginia cases for the principle “that proximate
causation ‘is generally a question of fact to be resolved by a jury.’”" More specifically, in a
retaliatory employment action based on the First Amendment, the Fourth Circuit holds that the
element of causation cannot even be decided at the summary judgment stage, except in rare
“instances when there are no causal facts in dispute.” Love-Lane v. Martin, 355 F.3d 766, 776
(4th Cir. 2004); Stronach v. Virginia State Univ., 631 F. Supp. 2d 743, 753 (E.D. Va. 2008).
Fact questions cannot be adjudicated at the motion to dismiss stage. Cyberlock Consulting, Inc.
v. Info. Experts, Inc., 876 F. Supp. 2d 672, 680 (E.D. Va. 2012); U.S. for Use & Benefit of Owens
v. Olympic Marine Servs., Inc., 827 F. Supp. 1232, 1234 (E.D. Va. 1993). Closely-analogous to
causation issues, “reliance is a fact-intensive question and generally inappropriate for
determination on a motion to dismiss,” Carlucci v. Han, 907 F. Supp. 2d 709, 737 (E.D. Va.
2012), and “the question whether a defendant was actuated by malice . . . is a question of fact for
a jury rather than one for the Court to determine on a Motion to Dismiss,” Harrington v. Sprint
Nextel Corp., 1:08CV336 (JCC), 2008 WL 2228524, *6 (E.D. Va. May 29, 2008).

DRS takes great liberty with the operative alleged facts in its Motion to Dismiss, which
Elder disputes as an inaccurate representation of the case. DRS characterizes the relevant
alleged facts, as follows:
Plaintiff claims he was sent into the field in retaliation for his timekeeping
complaint. However, as his own allegations and the contract itself makes
clear, deployment into the field was part of his ordinary day-to-day
responsibilities. In fact, Plaintiff specifically requested to be deployed into
the field.
...
Plaintiff raised his timekeeping complaint in December 2007.
employment was not terminated until November 2009.

His

Motion to Dismiss at 6, 7 (citations omitted).
In contrast, the facts alleged in the Complaint provide:
Relator first began to speak out about the over-charging concern to his
superior, Dan Roelof, around the first part of December 2007. He
approached Mr. Roelof saying that he wanted to work all day, and on Fridays
or be deployed into the field. Mr. Roelof told Elder that it was “no big deal,
this is just the way things work.” [Roelof] further added that Relator could
not be deployed into the field and that he lacked experience necessary to be
deployed. In response to the directive of Mr. Roelof, Relator (only) began to
charge his time accurately, only for those hours worked (i.e. the 5 or 6 hours
a day that all employees spent at the warehouse). This prompted Roelof to
confront Relator, instructing him to go back and change his recorded time,
putting 12 hours for each day, instead of only hours he actually worked. The
very next week, Elder was deployed into the field, to eastern Afghanistan.
This action was targeted and directed at Relator as retaliation for his whistleblowing activities, in violation of subsection 3730(h) of the Act.
...
After Relator repeatedly expressed his concerns about the fraud going on in
DRS, he spent the last portion of his employment mostly in the field. In
2009, DRS’s Bill Howell deployed Elder to Kandahar for 3 to 4 months with
no work to do. . . . Later, he was deployed to Barge Matal, a very dangerous
area known for intense fighting against the Taliban. In fact, Ricky Ruiz, the
DRS supervisor at the time, even refused to give Relator a security report
15

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 16 of 21 PageID# 316

before going into Barge Matal - a standard procedure before every mission.
Mr. Ruiz simply told Relator Elder: “you’ll find out when you get there.”
The retaliatory nature of this directive was obvious and palpable to Relator.
Relator Elder arrived in Barge Matal to find a raging battle between US and
Coalition forces and the Taliban or Al Queda. He was told by US military
forces that civilians had no business in being there (especially unarmed), but
the fighting was too extreme to safely transport Elder out of the area.
Fortunately, Relator Elder survived six direct and three indirect sniper shots,
among a host of other gunfire and RPG rounds. Plainly, Realtor’s life was in
serious danger on several occasions while attending to DRS’s concocted
“snipe hunt.” . . . Later, back in the States, Elder received official word that
he was terminated from DRS, despite receiving a special commendation from
a US Army officer for his bravery and efforts in Barge Matal.
Complaint at 12, 23-24, see FAC at 9-12 (citations omitted).
DRS mischaracterizes the alleged facts to be construed in its favor.

The

mischaracterization not only transforms the facts to facially support the defendant but also
conveniently ignores direct evidence of causal connection alleged by Elder. Compare Motion to
Dismiss at 6, 7 with Complaint at 12, 23-24. Moreover, to survive a motion to dismiss, Elder has
sufficiently established a causal connection between his complaints of fraudulent timekeeping
practices and DRS’s retaliatory action. Thus, DRS’s argument regarding lack of causal
connection is unfounded.
“A plaintiff alleging retaliation faces a low hurdle at the motion to dismiss stage[.]”
Teliska v. Napolitano, 826 F.Supp.2d 94, 100 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Winston v. Clough, 712
F.Supp.2d 1, 11 (D. D.C. 2010)). “At this early stage of the proceedings, plaintiff can meet [the]
prima facie burden of causation simply by alleging that the adverse actions were caused by [the]
protected activity.” Vance v. Chao, 496 F.Supp.2d 182, 187 (D. D.C. 2007) (recognizing in n.4
that “[d]efendant will have an opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiff’s evidence, but
that moment has not yet arrived”) (emphasis in original).

“[A] plaintiff may raise a

presumption of causation by showing that the employer had knowledge of the protected

16

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 17 of 21 PageID# 317

activity and that the adverse action occurred soon thereafter.” Vance, 496 F.Supp.2d at 186
(citing Mitchell v. Baldridge, 759 F.2d 80, 86 (D.C. Cir. 1985)) (emphasis added). “While
‘[t]emporal proximity between protected expression and the alleged adverse action is relevant
circumstantial evidence of causation . . . the lack of temporal proximity becomes relevant only
when it is the only evidence relied upon by the Plaintiff to establish causation.’” United States v.
Lockheed Martin Corp., 1:09-CV-2381-TWT, 2013 WL 772810, *8 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 28, 2013)
(quoting Wiggins v. McHugh, No. CV–109–142, 2010 WL 1640968, *3, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
39790, *9–10 (S.D. Ga. Apr. 22, 2010) (quoting Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th
Cir. 2004))) (omission in original) (emphasis added). “Critically, however, a plaintiff is not
obligated to rely on the presumption of causation.” Id. “A plaintiff may also put forward
direct evidence and disregard the presumption and its time limitations.” Vance, 496 F.Supp.2d at
186 (referencing Timmons v. U.S. Capital Police Bd., 407 F.Supp.2d 8, 12 (D. D.C. 2005))
(emphasis added).
In this case, Elder has met the prima facie burden of causation by simply alleging that
defendant’s retaliation was caused by Elder’s protected activity. See Vance, 496 F.Supp.2d at
187. Moreover, Elder not only raises the presumption of causation but also presents direct
evidence of defendant’s retaliation. See FAC at 9-12. Establishing either form of causation is
sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. See Teliska, 826 F.Supp.2d at 100, Vance, 496
F.Supp.2d at 187. Elder can rely solely on the presumption of causation based on temporal
proximity between the protected activity and defendant’s retaliation. See Lockheed Martin
Corp., 2010 WL 1640968, *8. For example, when Elder spoke to his superior, Dan Roelof,
about his concerns regarding DRS’s timekeeping practices, Elder stated that “he wanted to work
all day, and on Fridays, or be deployed into the field.” Complaint at ¶ 55. Roelof explained that

17

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 18 of 21 PageID# 318

Elder “could not be deployed into the field because he lacked the experience necessary to be
deployed.” Complaint at ¶ 57. At this point, Elder began to accurately record his time which
prompted confrontation by Roelof. See Complaint at ¶¶ 58, 59. Notwithstanding Roelof’s
statement that Elder was not qualified to be deployed to the field, the very next week Elder was
deployed to eastern Afghanistan. See Complaint at ¶ 60. Clearly, there is an alleged temporal
proximity between DRS’s knowledge of the protected activity and its retaliation.3 See Vance,
496 F.Supp.2d at 186. Because temporal proximity allegations exist, Elder has adequately raised
a presumption of causation. See id.
Additionally, Elder has direct evidence of DRS’s retaliation. See Complaint at 12, 23-24.
Elder was not only repeatedly sent to the field – when, by DRS’s own admission, Elder lacked
experience to work in the field – but, also, Elder was deployed into active combat locations
where “civilians had no business in being there.”4 See Complaint at 10-12. Elder was even
deployed to the Kandahar region “with no work to do.” See Complaint at 23. All of these
assignments were made after Elder “repeatedly expressed his concerns about the fraud going on
at DRS.” See id at 23, 24. The repetitive nature of Elder’s deployments, combined with being
assigned little to no work, alleges direct evidence of DRS’s retaliation.

See Vance, 496

F.Supp.2d at 186.
3 It is instructive to note that all cases, except one, cited by the defendant in support of its
argument that Elder has failed to establish causation were decided at the summary judgment
stage and not a motion to dismiss. See Motion to Dismiss at 7. Collectively, those cases stand
for the proposition that, potentially, a time lapse of 10 weeks or greater, is too remote to establish
causation based on temporal proximity. See Motion to Dismiss at 7. Even if this line of cases
applied in this matter, Elder has alleged a timeline between DRS’s knowledge of the protected
activity and its retaliation sufficient to allege causation based on temporal proximity. See id.,
Complaint at 12, 23-24.
4 DRS avers in its motion to dismiss that “[t]he government, not DRS, of course, determined
the locations of deployments.” Motion to Dismiss at n. 7. If true, surely defendant had control
over which personnel to send to the government-determined locations, ensuring that only
experienced personnel were deployed.
18

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 46 Filed 08/12/13 Page 19 of 21 PageID# 319

Elder has met his prima facie burden of alleging causation, not only by alleging that the
retaliation was caused by the protected activity, but also by raising the presumption of causation
and by virtue of direct evidence. See id. at 187. Because the Court is deciding a motion to
dismiss, and not summary judgment, Elder surpasses the necessary showing for causation.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Court is urged to deny defendant DRS’s motion to
dismiss. Elder alleged sufficient facts to adequately plead a retaliation claim in the Complaint,
so the claim is not time-barred. Alternatively, the claim pleaded in the FAC relates back to the
date of the Complaint because of the substantial similarities between the facts alleged in the
Complaint and in the FAC. Furthermore, for motion to dismiss purposes, Elder adequately
alleged causation between the defendant’s fraudulent activity and its retaliation against Elder.
Elder does not oppose a partial summary judgment in DRS’s favor on the issue of
punitive damages. Elder withdraws his claim for punitive damages. In all other respects, Elder
urges denial of DRS’s motion to dismiss.
