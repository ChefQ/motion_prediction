Civil Action No. 1:13-cv-00799-JCCTRJ

DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO
DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Three and one half years after he left the employ of Defendant DRS Technologies, Inc.
(“DRS” or the “Company”), over five years since he claims he told the Company about potential
fraud, and only after he abandoned his substantive False Claims Act (“FCA”) claims, Plaintiff –
for the first time – brings a cause of action claiming that he was retaliated against by the
Company in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h). Plaintiff’s new § 3730(h) claim fails on multiple
grounds. First, his claim is time barred because it was brought well after the two-year statute of
limitations expired. Second, his allegation that his deployment into the field was retaliatory is
belied by his own assertion that he requested to be sent out to the field. Third, the gap in time of
23 months between his alleged accusations of fraudulent billing and his termination is too great
in time to establish the necessary causation to sustain his retaliation claim. In addition,
Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages is not an appropriate remedy under § 3730(h) and should
be stricken.
For these reasons, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) should be dismissed
with prejudice.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff initially filed this lawsuit in the United States Court for the Northern District of
Alabama on June 15, 2011. See Compl. His original Complaint only included claims as a qui
tam plaintiff under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)-(3). Id. On October 9, 2012, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed a notice that it was not intervening in the case at that time and asked that the
Complaint be unsealed. See Notice of the United States That It Is Not Intervening at This Time.
The Complaint was thereafter unsealed and DRS moved to transfer venue to the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on April 25, 2013. See Def.’s Opposed Mot. to
Transfer Venue (“Mot. to Transfer”). In response to the Motion to Transfer, Plaintiff abandoned
his qui tam claims and asserted a new claim of retaliation under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).1 See
Elder’s Resp. in Opp. to Def. DRS Technologies, Inc.’s Mot. to Transfer Venue at 1; FAC. The
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama subsequently granted the Motion to
Transfer and the case was moved to this Court. See Order, June 14, 2013.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff was hired by DRS in October 2007 to work as a telecommunications specialist in
Afghanistan. FAC ¶¶ 11-13. He was working in Afghanistan pursuant to a contract DRS had
with the U.S. Army to install telecommunications equipment for the Afghan National Police.2
Id. ¶¶ 14-15, 33. Plaintiff alleges he complained to a single “superior,” Dan Roelof, in
December 2007, that he believed telecommunications specialists were submitting time entries for

As Judge Proctor noted, Plaintiff’s original complaint “did not include a Section 3730(h)
retaliation claim among his causes of action.” Mem. Op. at 1, n.1 (ECF No. 34).
2

DRS Technical Services, Inc. (“DRS-TSI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of DRS, was the
contracting party, not DRS.

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 43 Filed 07/31/13 Page 3 of 10 PageID# 288

more time than they actually worked and those time entries were “potentially illegal”3 (emphasis
added). Id. ¶¶ 37, 38, 50. At the same time, he requested to be deployed into the field. Id. ¶ 51.
Although Plaintiff claims his superior originally refused to deploy him, Plaintiff admits his
request to be deployed was granted “[t]he very next week.” Id. ¶¶ 53, 56. Plaintiff now claims
the granting of his request was retaliation for his complaint about overcharging. Id. ¶ 56. He
further claims that two deployments – to Kandahar and Barge Matal – each of which occurred
over a year later in 2009, and while he worked for a different supervisor, were also in retaliation
for his earlier complaint. Id. ¶¶ 66, 69. Finally, he claims the termination of his employment in
November 2009, was in retaliation for his 2007 complaint. Id. ¶¶ 11, 76-77.
LEGAL STANDARD
In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept the facts alleged in the light
most favorable to Plaintiff. Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir. 2008). The
Court is not, however, required to accept Plaintiff’s legal conclusions drawn from the alleged
facts, nor is it required to “accept as true unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or
arguments.” Id. (quoting E. Shore Mkts., Inc. v. J.D. Assocs., Ltd. P’ship, 213 F.3d 175, 180 (4th
3

Section 3730(h) gives examples of the types of activity that may qualify as a “protected
activity” under the FCA. These activities include an “investigation for . . . an action filed or to
be filed under this section.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h). In interpreting this provision, courts have
made it clear that not any investigation will suffice. Rather, the investigation must be one that
had a distinct possibility of leading to a viable suit under the FCA. See, e.g., Mann v. Heckler &
Koch Def., Inc., 630 F.3d 338, 344 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Neal v. Honeywell, Inc., 33 F.3d 860,
864 (7th Cir. 1994) (the distinct possibility standard can only be met where litigation may be
filed legitimately, and excludes situations where “an employee … just imagines fraud but lacks
proof.”). Here, Plaintiff appears to allege that only hours worked at the warehouse were
chargeable. FAC ¶ 56. At the same time, he also alleges the work to be performed occurred
outside the warehouse, including in Kabul when “teaching the Afghan police how to use the
telecommunications equipment” and “installing radio towers throughout Afghanistan.” Id. ¶¶
14-15. These inconsistencies demonstrate there was no distinct possibility of successful FCA
litigation arising from his claims because Plaintiff’s admission that work outside the warehouse
was billable undermines the central premise of his theory of fraud.

Cir. 2000)). A claim should be dismissed if it does not contain “enough facts to state a claim to
relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Mere
recitals of the elements of a claim supported by conclusory statements are wholly insufficient to
avoid dismissal of the claim. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).
In order to prevail under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h), Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of
the evidence that (1) he was engaged in activity protected under the FCA; (2) DRS knew about
his protected activity; and (3) as a result, retaliated against him. Zahodnick v. IBM Corp., 135
F.3d 911, 914 (4th Cir. 1997).
ARGUMENT
I.

PLAINTIFF’S § 3730(H) CLAIM IS BARRED BY THE APPLICABLE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS
Plaintiff’s § 3730(h) claim is subject to a two-year statute of limitations but was not filed

until almost four years after he last worked for DRS. It is therefore time barred and should be
dismissed with prejudice.
At the time Plaintiff’s claim arose, § 3730(h) claims adopted the statute of limitations that
applied to the most comparable state law. Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v.
United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 422 (2005) (refusing to apply the six-year statute of
limitations that applies to claims under 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and instead applying “most closely
analogous state statute of limitations” to § 3730(h) claims).4 Plaintiff’s § 3730(h) claim is
therefore subject to the statutes of limitation for the most analogous state laws in Virginia which,

4

31 U.S.C. § 3730(h) was subsequently amended in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank reforms to
add an explicit three-year statute of limitations. 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h)(3) (2010). Even were this
to apply retroactively, which it does not, Plaintiff’s suit would still be barred because it was filed
more than three years after the alleged retaliation.

4

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 43 Filed 07/31/13 Page 5 of 10 PageID# 290

as the Supreme Court in Graham County noted, are Va. Code Ann. §§ 8.01-243(A), 8.01-248.5
Graham Cnty., 545 U.S. at 419 n.3 (listing the most analogous state laws for each of the 50 states
for statute of limitations purposes). Both of these Virginia statutes apply a two-year statute of
limitations. Va. Code Ann. §§ 8.01-243(A) (two-year statute of limitations for actions for
damages caused by fraud), 8.01-248 (two-year statute of limitations for all personal actions
where no other limitation has been prescribed). Plaintiff’s employment was terminated in
November 2009, more than three years before he first brought a cause of action under § 3730(h).
FAC ¶ 11. The other alleged retaliatory actions are even more remote in time from Plaintiff’s
filing of his § 3730(h) claim. Id. ¶¶ 56, 66, 69. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s § 3730(h) claim is
wholly time barred and should be dismissed with prejudice.6
II.

PLAINTIFF’S § 3730(H) CLAIM SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE HE
FAILS TO ALLEGE FACTS SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN HIS CLAIM
To establish his prima facie case of retaliation pursuant to § 3730(h), Plaintiff must allege

facts sufficient to establish a causal connection between his alleged protected activity and those
actions he is claiming are retaliatory. Mann, 630 F.3d at 343. Plaintiff’s allegations fail to
5

To the extent Plaintiff claims the Court should adopt the statute of limitations of Alabama’s
most analogous laws, they also have a two-year statute of limitation. Graham Cnty., 545 U.S. at
419 n.3 (citing Ala. Code § 6-2-38; § 36-26A-4(a)); Ala. Code § 6-2-38 (two-year statute of
limitation for torts not otherwise enumerated); Ala. Code § 36-26A-4(a) (two-year statute of
limitation for state employee whistleblower claims).
6

Any contention that Plaintiff’s retaliation claim relates back to the claims in his original
Complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 would be incorrect. As numerous courts have held, a
“retaliation claim is a new wrong, distinct from the fraud alleged in the rest of the complaint,”
and does not relate back to the date of the original qui tam complaint. United States ex rel.
Smart v. Christus Health, 626 F. Supp. 2d 647, 658 n.12 (S.D. Tex. 2009); see also, e.g., United
States ex rel. Deering v. Physiotherapy Assocs., Inc., 601 F. Supp. 2d 368, 377 (D. Mass. 2009)
(finding that subsequent retaliation claim did not relate back to the FCA allegations in the
original complaint); United States ex rel. Nichols v. Omni H.C., Inc., No. 4:02-cv-66(HL), 2008
WL 906426, at *3 (M.D. Ga. Mar. 31, 2008) (retaliation claim did not relate back to the original
complaint because the operative facts surrounding retaliation are entirely different than the
operative facts surrounding false claims).

5

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 43 Filed 07/31/13 Page 6 of 10 PageID# 291

satisfy this element because, according to his own allegations, DRS’s actions were not retaliatory
and because the gap in time between his alleged protected activity and DRS’s actions is too long.
Plaintiff’s § 3730(h) claim should be dismissed for these additional reasons.
A.

Plaintiff’s Deployment into the Field Cannot Serve as a Basis for His
Retaliation Claim

Plaintiff claims he was sent into the field in retaliation for his timekeeping complaint.
FAC ¶ 56. However, as his own allegations and the contract itself make clear, deployment into
the field was part of his ordinary “day-to-day responsibilities.” Id. ¶ 15.7 In fact, Plaintiff
specifically requested to be deployed into the field. Id. ¶ 51. Granting a plaintiff’s request for a
change in his conditions of employment is not retaliatory. See, e.g., Linzer v. Sebelius, No. 07cv-0597, 2009 WL 2778269, at *7 (D. Md. Aug. 28, 2009) (dismissing disability retaliation
claim as “absurd” and “bel[ying] logic” where claim was based on employer granting requested
medical accommodation); Hayman v. Potter, 598 F. Supp. 2d 904, 911 (N.D. Ind. 2009)
(dismissing retaliation action in part because plaintiff had requested the new assignment that he
subsequently claimed was retaliatory). Therefore, Plaintiff’s deployment to the field was not
retaliatory and cannot serve as a basis for his § 3730(h) claim.
B.

Plaintiff Fails to Show the Requisite Causal Connection Between His Alleged
Complaints About Fraudulent Timekeeping and the Alleged Retaliatory Acts

Because his requested deployment to the field was not, and cannot be, retaliatory,
Plaintiff’s only remaining alleged retaliatory action is the termination of his employment. But
his termination occurred 23 months after he allegedly complained to his superior. This gap in
time between the two events destroys any causal connection between the two. As such, he fails
to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
7

The government, not DRS, of course, determined the locations of deployments.

6

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 43 Filed 07/31/13 Page 7 of 10 PageID# 292

Plaintiff raised his timekeeping complaint in December 2007. FAC ¶ 50. His
employment was not terminated until November 2009. Id. ¶ 11. In short, there is no causal
connection between the two events and his § 3730(h) claim should be dismissed with prejudice.8
Liburd v. Bronx Lebanon Hosp. Ctr., No. 07-cv-11316, 2009 WL 900739, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Apr.
3, 2009) (plaintiff failed to demonstrate temporal proximity in her § 3730(h) claim when she was
terminated nearly seven months after her allegedly protected activity); United States ex rel.
Carpenter v. S&K Techs., Inc., No. 5:08-cv-287, 2011 WL 3664415, at *12 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 19,
2011) (noting in a § 3730(h) case that a three to four month gap between alleged protected
activity and retaliatory conduct fails to create the requisite causal link to sustain claim); see also
Clark Ctny. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74 (2001) (citing approvingly Court of
Appeals decisions finding that three or four month periods between protected activity and
allegedly retaliatory conduct are insufficient to establish the causal link necessary for Title VII
retaliation claims); Perry v. Kappos, 489 F. App’x 637, 643 (4th Cir. 2012) (noting the Fourth
Circuit has previously held a three to four month gap in temporal proximity is insufficient to
create a causal connection); King v. Rumsfeld, 328 F.3d 145, 151 n.5 (4th Cir. 2003) (even a
mere ten-week separation between the protected activity and termination “is sufficiently long so
as to weaken significantly the inference of causation between the two events”); Shields v. Fed.
Express Corp., 120 F. App’x 956, 962 (4th Cir. 2005) (holding that a four month gap between
protected activity and adverse employment action, alone, cannot establish a causal link for a
prima facie case of retaliation); Hart v. Hanover Cnty. Sch. Bd., No. 3:10-cv-794, 2011 WL
8

To the extent Plaintiff claims his later deployments to Kandahar and Barge Matal were in
retaliation for his December 2007 complaint, those deployments also fail to create the necessary
causal connection because they occurred in 2009 – well over a year after Plaintiff voiced his
complaint. FAC ¶¶ 66, 69 (noting he was deployed to Kandahar in 2009 and later to Barge
Matal).

7

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 43 Filed 07/31/13 Page 8 of 10 PageID# 293

652524, at *3 (E.D. Va. Feb. 11, 2011) (granting motion to dismiss where lapse of more than one
year was insufficient to prove causation in Fair Labor Standards Act retaliation action).9
III.

PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES SHOULD BE DISMISSED
AS AN INAPPROPRIATE REMEDY UNDER § 3730(H)
Plaintiff seeks punitive damages as a remedy for his § 3730(h) claim. FAC ¶ 91.

However, punitive damages are not among the remedies available for a § 3730(h) claim. 31
U.S.C. § 3730(h)(2); Leggins v. Orlando Hous. Auth., No. 6:13-cv-232-Orl-37DAB, 2013 WL
937739, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 11, 2013) (noting that the absence of punitive damages in Section
3730(h) was intentional, and that punitive damages are not available); United States ex rel.
Satalich v. City of Los Angeles, 160 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1095 (C.D. Cal. 2001); Neal v. Honeywell,
Inc., 995 F. Supp. 889, 895-98 (N.D. Ill. 1998) (finding that punitive damages are unavailable
under the anti-retaliation section of the False Claims Act); Hammond v. Northland Counseling
Ctr., Inc., No. CIV.5-96-353MJD/RLE, 1998 WL 315333, at *3-6 (D. Minn. Feb. 27, 1998)
(same). Therefore, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages should also be dismissed.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint should be dismissed in
its entirety with prejudice. His retaliation claim was brought more than three years after his
employment with DRS concluded, well beyond the two-year statute of limitations period passed.
Moreover, Plaintiff’s claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because he
cannot establish the requisite causal connection between his purported protected activity and his
deployment to the field or release from the company. Plaintiff asked to be deployed to the field
9

The lack of a causal connection is made even clearer in this case by Plaintiff’s own statement
that DRS was responsive to his purported complaints – a far cry from the actions of a company
bent on retaliation. See FAC ¶ 45 (“After Elder’s many complaints … DRS’s policy changed to
allow Friday as a regular work day… .”).

Case 1:13-cv-00799-JCC-TRJ Document 43 Filed 07/31/13 Page 9 of 10 PageID# 294

– a request that DRS granted. Plaintiff’s release from the company occurred two years after he
allegedly complained about fraudulent billing practices, a gap in temporal proximity that cannot
create a causal connection. Further, to the extent Plaintiff’s § 3730(h) claim survives dismissal,
his demand for punitive damages should be dismissed with prejudice.
