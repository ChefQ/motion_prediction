Honorable Michael B. North

AMERICAN MARINE SERVICES, INC.’S
SUPPELEMENTAL MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
SHINHAN CAPITAL CO., LTD’S MOTION TO VACATE MARITIME ATTACHMENT
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT:
Plaintiff, American Marine Services, Inc. (“AMS”), respectfully submits this
Memorandum to address the legally and factually incorrect argument made in Shinhan Capital
Co. Ltd.’s (“Shinhan”) Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Vacate Maritime
Attachment filed as Record Doc. No. 87. As an initial matter, AMS adopts and incorporates that
Supplemental Memorandum filed by the other Plaintiffs in these Consolidated Civil Actions as
Record Doc. No. 88, but is forced to respond separately in light of the unfounded allegations
made specifically against AMS in Shinhan’s subsection (2)(b).1

Undersigned counsel represented Ya-Sa and counsel for SPV1 / Lark represented Kriti Filoxenia in the case
before Judge Lemmon and later the Fifth Circuit discussed in Shinhan’s Supplemental Memorandum. Although we
were on different sides of that case, the undersigned feels comfortable stating that Messrs. Tadros and Davis would
agree that the Kriti Filoxenia case is distinguishable on its facts from the Civil Actions at issue, and the holding
inapposite to the alter ego / fraudulent transfer claims made herein.

Shinhan, who has not been engaged in the negotiations relating to the bankruptcy
proceeding, seeks to place blame for the lack of movement in the bankruptcy at the feet of AMS.
It would be helpful to all parties in this matter if Shinhan confined its briefing to areas in which it
is a participant and fully informed. Frankly, the arguments raised by Shinhan place AMS in a
difficult position. As this Court is aware, settlement negotiations should never be fodder for
pleadings in open court. Suffice it to say and without violating the spirit or letter of the Federal
Rules of Evidence, AMS is not to blame for the failure of a special bond to be posted. After
repeatedly trying to be a part of the negotiations between the bankruptcy lawyers appointed by
Daebo and its foreign representative and by Plaintiffs Richardson, SPV1 and Jalhdi, AMS was
finally presented with a document that was termed as a near final agreement between those
parties. AMS was asked to accept that document with the concessions made by the other
Plaintiffs. AMS refused to accept a “special bond” that was not in fact a “special bond” as
envisioned by Rule E(5) of the Supplemental Admiralty Rules. As stated multiple times to all
parties, the bond did not contain a satisfactory uptick as allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and local practice. AMS’s concerns were unheeded. Furthermore, this “bond” did not
provide security for all claims that were advanced against the defendants herein as a “special
bond” would. AMS would note that when it raised this point during the bankruptcy hearing on
April 9, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court agreed with AMS’s reluctance to accept the stipulation that
had been negotiated by the other parties. Shinhan ignores that important fact.
Throughout these proceedings, the other parties, much like Shinhan now, have attempted
to bully AMS into taking what is being offered. As is AMS’s right, it has refused and will
continue to refuse until it is properly protected as envisioned by the Supplemental Admiralty
Rules. For this, it is respectfully submitted, AMS should not be punished.

Furthermore, AMS (to the consternation of the New York attorneys) continues to contend
that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York is the improper
venue for the bankruptcy proceedings. Under the explicit language of the relevant venue statute,
venue properly lies in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
As a result, AMS timely and properly moved to transfer venue. Despite AMS’s continued
efforts up until the date of this filing, it has been unable to secure a hearing on its motion. Daebo
has, to date, made it a condition precedent to any settlement that all Attachment Parties waive
their venue objections.

AMS contends that is improper because venue of the bankruptcy

proceeding is in no way related to the posting of a special bond to release a vessel in an
admiralty case. The other Plaintiffs may have been willing to waive their FRCP 12 defenses at
one point,2 but AMS is not.
Furthermore and most importantly, Shinhan selectively provides portions of the exchange
with the bankruptcy court. At the hearing on April 9, 2015, AMS did not want to accept the
stipulation offered by a bankrupt debtor and place itself into a worse situation because the
ultimate bond could be deemed an asset of a bankruptcy estate and thereby vacated. AMS would
note that as a result of its valid concerns, the parties were admonished by the bankruptcy court on
April 9, 2015 to continue negotiations and report back at 1:00 p.m. New York time on April 13,
2015. In the meantime, the parties have made great strides in closing the gaps between them. Of
note, certain revisions ensuring that the bond could not be clawed back because it was posted by
Daebo have been accepted in principal as was reported to the bankruptcy court earlier today. A
telephone conference with the bankruptcy court is set for this coming Thursday afternoon, April
16, 2015, and further strides are hoped to be made towards a resolution before then. A call

Whether the other Plaintiffs are still willing to waive their venue objections is unclear in light of comments
made by their counsel midway through the April 9, 2013 hearing in which he attempted to make an oral motion to
transfer venue.

between counsel for Daebo and its foreign representative and AMS is planned for tomorrow
morning.
In light of the above, AMS takes exception to the baseless arguments leveled against it.
AMS is a small family run business that has been pushed to the brink of collapse by Daebo’s
continuing failure to pay its debts and to seek bankruptcy protection. Daebo’s ability to hide its
assets has been greatly assisted by Shinhan and its use of its wrongly-labeled “Vessel Lease
Agreement.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMS would note that it has not been an impediment to
Daebo using its best efforts to secure a bond. AMS has not stopped Daebo from going to its
banks or other entities that provide financial support to attempt to secure a special bond for the
release of the vessel as provided by the Supplemental Admiralty Rules. Shinhan’s suggestion
otherwise is disingenuous at best. Furthermore, Shinhan seems to suggest that because AMS has
one of the smaller claims its voice should count for less. This is preposterous. AMS did not
create this situation.

Finally, Shinhan, as a solvent defendant in this matter claiming an

ownership interest in the subject vessel, could remedy the state of affairs by posting a bond as
provided by the Supplemental Admiralty Rules itself. It is telling that Shinhan chooses not to,
but instead blames a small family run American business.
