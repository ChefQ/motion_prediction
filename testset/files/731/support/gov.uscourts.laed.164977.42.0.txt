DAEBO INTERNATIONAL
JUDGE MARTIN L. C. FELDMAN

MAGISTRATE (5)
Defendants
JUDGE MAGISTRATE MICHAEL B. NORTH
THIS PLEADING APPLIES TO ALL
CASES
MOTION TO VACATE MARITIME ATTACHMENT
NOW INTO COURT, through undersigned counsel and appearing solely and
restrictively as the owner of the M/V DAEBO TRADER, Shinhan Capital Co., Ltd. (hereinafter
“Shinhan”) makes this limited appearance under Rule E(8), with the full reservation of all rights
and defenses, to vacate the wrongful attachment of its property, the DAEBO TRADER. Shinhan
moves this Court to issue an Order vacating the Rule B maritime attachments on the following
grounds:
(1) Three (3) of the Rule B plaintiffs, Richardson Stevedoring & Logistics Services, Inc.,
SPV 1 LLC, and Jaldhi Overseas Pte., Ltd. have taken contradictory positions in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York maintaining
that Shinhan, not Daebo International Shipping Co., Ltd. (“Daebo”), is unequivocally

the owner of the DAEBO TRADER. In light of these judicial admissions, these
plaintiffs should be judicially estopped from maintaining now or in the future their
maritime attachments of the DAEBO TRADER;
(2) As a Rule E(4)(f) interested person, Shinhan moves this Honorable Court vacate all
Rule B maritime attachments of the DAEBO TRADER on the grounds that Shinhan,
not Daebo, is the owner of the vessel in light of additional evidence set for by
Shinhan in its Memorandum in Support, thus establishing that the Rule B plaintiffs’
attachments are no longer supported by probable cause as per this Court’s March 2,
2015 Order (Rec. Doc. No. 24); and
(3) Shinhan also calls to this Court’s attention that on March 19, 2015, the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with Daebo’s
bankruptcy proceeding issued an Order Granting Provisional Relief Pending Hearing
On Petition for Recognition As A Foreign Main Proceeding Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§
105(a) And 1519 staying all proceedings affecting property comprising the
bankruptcy estate of Daebo. Shinhan represents that this Order does not affect this
Honorable Court’s ability to vacate the Rule B attachments and release the vessel.
For these reasons and those more fully explained in the attached Memorandum in
Support, Shinhan moves this Court to vacate all Rule B attachments of the DAEBO TRADER
and release the vessel.
