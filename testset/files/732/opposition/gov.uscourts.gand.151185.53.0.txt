DEFENDANTS' BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANTS' ANSWER
COME NOW Defendants Sunshine Recycling, LLC ("Sunshine") and Larry
Jackson ("Jackson"), by and through undersigned counsel of record for Defendants,
and submit this their Brief in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants'
Answer, showing the Court as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Answer is premised upon two pretrip reports that Plaintiff speciously alleges were fabricated. While Defendants
concede that they have been unable to locate the original documents, despite
extensive and diligent searches, Defendants adamantly deny that they have
fabricated or intentionally destroyed any relevant documents.

As striking

Defendants' answer would be a drastic and inappropriate sanction under the
circumstances, Defendants respectfully request that this Court deny Plaintiff's
Motion to Strike.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
I.

The Subject Accident
On February 4, 2007, Defendant Larry Jackson, who was an employee of

Defendant Sunshine Recycling, LLC, left his house at approximately 11:30 p.m.
and drove a tractor pulling a step-deck trailer loaded with 2-inch angle iron beams
to Cope, South Carolina to meet his companion driver, Keith Rich. (August 17,
2009 Deposition of Larry Jackson at 65, 74, 100; a true and accurate copy of
relevant portions of Jackson's August Deposition is attached hereto as Exhibit
"A."). Jackson was scheduled to deliver the load to Sunshine's customer in Iuka,
Mississippi. (Ex. A at 28.) He completed a pre-trip inspection report and started a
driver log. (Ex. A. at 84-85.) Jackson began driving the commercial route shortly
after midnight on February 5, 2007. (Ex. A. at 74.)
Approximately thirty minutes into the trip, Jackson and Rich stopped at "a
little turnout" in Williston, South Carolina to "tighten up all your binders, your
straps or whatever" and perform a general inspection. (Deposition of Keith Rich at
33-34; a true and accurate copy of relevant portions of Keith Rich's Deposition is

attached hereto as Exhibit "B.") They stopped again an hour and a half to two
hours later at a truck stop off at Exit 172 off of Interstate 20 in Thomson, Georgia
to fill out their log books and perform an inspection of the vehicles again and then
continued along I-20 westbound until the accident occurred. (Ex. A at 85; Ex. B at
35.)
At approximately 4:30 a.m, Jackson was traveling westbound on I- 20 in
Cobb County, Georgia. (Complaint, ¶¶ 7-8.) At the same date and time, Plaintiff
was traveling in the same lane of traffic in a Ford F-450 tow truck with a vehicle in
tow. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) Defendant Jackson was approximately halfway up a hill
just past the intersection of I-20 and Six Flags Parkway when he suddenly felt what
he thought was the transmission exploding. (Ex. A at 101-102, 109.) He radioed
his companion driver Keith Rich, who was in another tractor-trailer just ahead, and
advised him that he "thought the transmission had blown." (Ex. A at 101-102.)
Jackson looked in his rearview mirror and saw sparks and smoke and realized that
he had been hit. (Ex. A at 102.) Both Defendant Jackson and Mr. Rich pulled
their rigs onto the shoulder of the road and got out of their respective cabs. (Ex. A
at 103; Ex. B at 43.) As Defendant Jackson walked to the back of the rig, he saw
Plaintiff's tow truck pinned underneath the trailer. (Ex. A at 103-104.)

He

approached the tow truck and asked whether Plaintiff was injured. (Ex. A. at 103.)

-3-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 4 of 20

Plaintiff responded that he was "hurt pretty good," and Defendant Jackson called
911 to advise of the accident and to request that medical personnel come to the
scene. (Ex. A. at 103.)
When police arrived on the scene of the accident, they interviewed
Defendant Jackson and Mr. Rich. (Ex. A at 126-127; Ex. B at 47-48.) The officer
issued Plaintiff a citation for the subject accident.

(Deposition of Benjamin

Edwards at 38; a true and accurate copy of relevant portions of Edwards's
Deposition is attached hereto as Exhibit "C.")
Plaintiff did not see Jackson's vehicle before running into and underneath the
trailer. (Ex. C at 37.) However, Plaintiff's passenger at the time of the accident,
Jason Phillips, testified that immediately prior to impact, he glanced up and saw
Jackson's tractor-trailer three to four car lengths ahead, observed the functioning
taillights and testified that the tractor-trailer was fully established in their lane of
traffic. (Deposition of Jason Phillips at 21; a true and accurate copy of Phillips's
Deposition is attached hereto as Exhibit "D.") He also testified that Plaintiff was
traveling 70 to 75 miles per hour at the time of impact and that he did not feel the
tow truck swerve or brake before the impact. (Ex. D at 22, 28.) Though Phillips
testified that he glanced up, saw the tractor-trailer, "closed [his] eyes and started
praying," he, nevertheless, contends that in this narrow time frame, he was able to

-4-

observe flat steel beams (Jackson was hauling 2-inch angle iron) extending beyond
the rear of the trailer, which he contends partially obscured the lights, and to
estimate the speed of Jackson's vehicle to be between 35 and 40 miles per hour
based on the fact that "he was going very much slower than everybody else, you
know. That's just a guess." (Ex. D at 23, 26-28.)
Following the subject accident, Jackson turned in his original pre-trip
inspection reports and driver's logs to Sunshine. (Ex. A at 150, 156; October 28,
2009 Deposition of Larry Jackson at 4; a true and accurate copy of relevant
portions of the Jackson's October Deposition is included in Defendants' Supporting
Excerpts as Exhibit "E.")
II.

Sunshine's Business Operations
Sunshine is a small recycling company engaged in the business of

purchasing, transporting and reselling steel and other materials. (August 17, 2009
Deposition of Joseph Rich at 18; a true and accurate copy of relevant portions of
Rich Deposition is attached hereto as Exhibit "F.") With regard to the business
administration, no single person is responsible for any particular task but rather
"everybody works everywhere and tries to do everything that they can." (Ex. F at
46.) At the time of the subject accident, "anyone that was in office at the time that
[vehicle inspection records] were turned in," would have been responsible for

keeping said records. (October 20, 2009 Deposition of Joseph Rich at 44; a true
and accurate copy of relevant portions of Rich's October 20, 2009 deposition is
attached hereto as Exhibit "G.")
III.

The Instant Lawsuit
Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants Jackson and Sunshine seeking

damages for injuries he sustained allegedly as a result of the subject accident.
After an extensive On October 1, 2009, Defendants Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants have "fabricated" documents and spoliated evidence. (See generally
Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Answer and Brief in Support Thereof.)
Pursuant to Plaintiff's discovery requests, Sunshine attempted to locate all
documents in its possession that were responsive to said requests. (October 6,
2009 Deposition of Donna Austin at 58-59; a true and accurate copy of relevant
portions of Austin's October 6, 2009 deposition attached hereto as Exhibit "H";
October 6, 2009 deposition of Robin Walker at 30; a true and accurate copy of
relevant portions of Walker's October 6, 2009 deposition attached hereto as Exhibit
"I.") Ms. Walker and Ms. Austin conducted an exhaustive and extensive search of
numerous boxes of records. (Ex. I at 30, "We had been looking through oodles and
oodles of things trying to find, you know, anything because we've had so many
hands on paperwork and stuff like that. So we were just going through everything

-6-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Page 7 of 20

that we could find.") Unfortunately, since the date of the subject accident, the
boxes in which Sunshine's records are stored have been moved, more than once, to
different locations. (Ex. I at 31.) Moreover, some boxes were damaged by water
and by rats and their contents had to be discarded. (Ex. I at 34, 48.) Finally, some
records were inadvertently discarded by Joe Rich's uncle when he cleaned out a
cabinet to store safety supplies. (October 28, 2009 Deposition of Robin Walker at
20; a true and accurate copy of relevant portions of Walker's October 28, 2009
Deposition is attached hereto as Exhibit "J".) Defendants concede that due to these
issues and "poor record-keeping," they have been unable to locate some original
documents that Plaintiff contends are or may be relevant to the issues in this case,
specifically the original pre-trip inspection reports for February 5 and February 6,
2007. (Ex. F at 45.) However, none of Sunshine's records, relevant to the instant
action, was intentionally destroyed nor would anyone at Sunshine have directed
that documents be destroyed or fabricated. (Ex. J at 12, 29; October 20, 2009
Deposition of Donna Austin at 13-14; a true and accurate copy of relevant portions
of Austin's October 20, 2009 deposition is attached hereto as Exhibit "K.")
In late September 2009, Ms. Austin finally located pre-trip inspection
reports dated February 5 and February 6, 2007, which had been misfiled in a box
of documents that had been stored in a desk drawer by its previous occupant. (Ex.

-7-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 8 of 20

K at 4, 6-7.) Upon further investigation, Ms. Walker located the driver logs for
February 5 and February 6, 2007 in the same box. (Ex. J at 12.) Counsel for
Defendants immediately produced these records to counsel for Plaintiff on October
1, 2009.
During his deposition, Plaintiff's expert opined that the February 5 and
February 6, 2007 pre-trip inspection reports had been prepared on forms that would
not have been available to Jackson until August 2007. (Deposition of Donald Hess
at 56; a true and accurate copy of relevant portions of Hess's deposition is attached
hereto as Exhibit "L.") As this was the first counsel for Defendants had heard of
this issue, and in hopes of resolving the discrepancy, Defendants offered to make
Joe Rich, Larry Jackson, Donna Austin, and Robin Walker available for redeposition with regard to the limited issue of the pre-trip inspection reports, and
Plaintiff accepted, noticing the depositions for October 20, 2009. (See Plaintiff's
Notices of Deposition, Docket Nos. 39 and 40.) Due to a scheduling conflict on
the part of Defendant Jackson and illness of Ms. Walker's infant child, Plaintiff
agreed to postpone their depositions to October 28, 2009. (See Plaintiff's Notices
of Deposition, Docket Nos. 43 and 44.) Plaintiff, nevertheless, filed his Motion to
Strike Defendants' Answer on October 23, 2009, without waiting for the very
information sought to be obtained in the course of these depositions.

circumstances surrounding the creation of the pre-trip inspection reports at issue.

Q.

Let me show you what was marked earlier as Plaintiff's Exhibit
Number 29. There's two pages there -- and we didn't have the
benefit of those at your first deposition. Do you recognize those
documents?
Yes. They are vehicle inspection reports.
All right. Can you tell me when those were signed?
These were -- the originals were signed in February of '07.
These I had copied from carbon copies out of the original book,
and I don't know exactly when I did these.
All right. So when you say the originals, there -- this is not a
copy of the original; is that what you're saying?
It's a re-copy of the original. (3:22 - 4:8)

A.
....
A. They asked me -- and when I say they, I think it was Robin
[Walker] but I am not sure -- if I knew where the inspection
reports and logs were. No, I don't know where they are at. And
would I try to help find them. Sure. So I know me and Robin
dug through boxes and boxes of stuff. And then I had the idea
of going out to the trucks and looking through the trucks for the
duplicate books. (7:8-14)
....
A. I found several of [the duplicate books], yeah. I took them into
the back room or the break room or whatever and sat down and
started going through them. And I found this book. (8:5-7)
....
A. There wasn't anybody [in Sunshine's business office] that day. I
did the two copies and I took them in -- and I was going to give
them to Robin or Donna or whatever the other girl's name was
there. And there wasn't anybody there . . . So I just laid them on
the desk in the center office. And I left all the books -- and there
was probably ten, twelve books that I brought in -- I left them
laying on the picnic table in the back room. (8:14-21)

Q. So it's your testimony then that you looked at the carbon and recopied that information on to the new form?

Q. Do you know how long it was after you left that you had this
opportunity when you were back at Sunshine to do -- to re-copy
the inspection records?

ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY
This Court should deny Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Answer.
While a court may impose sanctions for litigation misconduct under its inherent
power, such power “must be exercised with restraint and discretion.” Eagle Hosp.
Physicians, LLC v. SRG Consulting, Inc., 561 F.3d 1298, 1306 (11th Cir. 2009).
Sanctions as drastic as striking a party's answer are only appropriate where the
moving party demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the non-movant
has delayed or disrupted the litigation or hampered enforcement of a court order.
Id. "The dismissal of a party's complaint or answer, or striking its defenses, as a
sanction ... is a heavy punishment, appropriate only as a last resort, when less
drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the court's orders." Forsberg
v. Pefanis, 2009 WL 3229368, 5 (Oct. 9, 2009, N.D.Ga.)

Page 11 of 20

In the instant case, the best that Plaintiff can prove is that Sunshine's recordkeeping efforts have been less than meticulous and that Defendants have been
unable to locate the original February 5 and February 6, 2007 pre-trip inspection
reports; however, Defendants have not delayed or disrupted the litigation process
nor have they perpetrated any fraud upon this Court. Accordingly, this Court
should deny Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Answer.
I.

Defendants Have Not Perpetrated Any Fraud Upon This Court.
Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, Defendants have not perpetrated any fraud

upon this Court. Although Plaintiff attempts to take issue with Sunshine's failure
to produce documents requested in a March 13, 2007 preservation of evidence
letter (impliedly assuming that such documents ever existed or were required to be
in existence in the first place)1, at its heart, Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants'
Answer is premised upon the February 5 and February 6, 2007 pre-trip inspection
reports and the fact that, at the time Plaintiff filed his Motion to Strike, no one was
1

While Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to produce maintenance records,
driver logs and other documents requested in the course of discovery (to which
many of these requests Defendants properly objected and Plaintiff did not seek to
compel the production of any such documents), Plaintiff has not alleged that he
has suffered any prejudice as a result of Sunshine's failure to produce any
documents other than the February 5 and February 6, 2007 pre-trip inspection
reports. Indeed, as reflected on Page 3 of Plaintiff's Motion and Breif, the
Motion to strike is premised wholly upon Defendants' alleged fabrication of
documents. Accordingly, the only documents that this Court should fairly
consider are the February 5 and February 6, 2007 pre-trip inspection reports.
-11-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Page 12 of 20

able to explain why these reports appeared on forms that were not available until
August 2007; however, as Plaintiff discovered mere days after filing this Motion,
the reason that no one at Sunshine had any knowledge of or explanation for this
discrepancy is simple -- Jackson had re-copied the information contained in the
original forms onto new forms in early 2008, , unbeknownst to anyone at Sunshine.
Jackson prepared inspection reports and driver logs for February 5 and
February 6, 2007 on February 5 and February 6, 2007 respectively and turned them
into Sunshine at the end of the trip. (Ex. A at 150.) After leaving the company in
October 2007, Jackson learned that Sunshine had been unable to locate these items,
(Ex. E at 6, 8.) While at Sunshine one day in early 2008, Jackson searched the
cabs of several Sunshine trucks and found the books containing the carbon copies.
(Ex. E at 8.) He then proceeded to copy the information contained on the carbon
copies onto clean forms and left the re-copied forms on a desk in Sunshine's office
and the carbon copy books on a picnic table in the back room. (Ex. E at 8-10.) No
one was in Sunshine's office at the time Jackson re-copied the reports and he did
not have a conversation with anyone about recopying the documents. (Ex. E at 8;
Ex. J at 8.) In fact, had Sunshine been aware that Jackson had located the carbon
copies, Ms. Walker would have simply made "Xerox" copies of the same and
placed them in her files. (Ex. J at 11.) Unfortunately, Jackson did not think of

-12-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 13 of 20

photocopying the carbon copy because he thought Sunshine wanted the "white
copy." (Ex. E at 5, 9.)
Defendant Sunshine maintained the vehicle inspection reports dated
February 5 and February 6, 2007 and produced those records to Plaintiff
immediately upon their discovery. Neither Joe Rich nor Donna Austin knew, or
had reason to know, that the reports, as produced, were recopied from the originals
onto clean forms in early 2008. Accordingly, neither Rich nor Austin were able to
provide this explanation were they were deposed on October 20, 2008. This does
not, however, support Plaintiff's specious conclusion that these documents were
"fabricated" nor does it support Plaintiff's contention that Defendants' Answer
should be stricken. Accordingly, this Court should deny Plaintiff's Motion to
Strike.
II.

Defendants' Conduct In No Way Justifies Sanctioning, Much Less
Striking Of Defendants' Answer.
Defendants concede that owing to unfortunate circumstances related to the

storage of documents and to "poor record-keeping" on the part of Sunshine, they
have been unable to locate the original pre-trip inspection reports prepared by
Jackson on February 5 and February 6, 2009; however, Defendants have not
fabricated documents in this case. Plaintiff's conclusory allegation to that effect is

-13-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 14 of 20

insufficient evidence to support the imposition of sanctions, much less a sanction
as drastic as striking Defendants' Answer.
In support of his Motion, Plaintiff relies on this Court's recent decision in
Forsberg v. Pefanis, 2009 WL 3229368 (N.D. Ga, Oct. 9, 2009.) However, the
facts of this case are easily distinguishable from those of Forsberg and, thus, do
not support the imposition of sanctions here. In Forsberg, the plaintiff asserted a
cause of action for sexual harassment and claimed that her employer had touched
her inappropriately and made disparaging comments about her in the presence of
other employees. Id. at *1. In defense against the claims, the employer proferred
evidence that two employees would testify that they had never witnessed the
alleged incident and submitted a signed statement purportedly on behalf of one of
the employees.

Id.

However, in preparation for trial, plaintiff located the

employee who purportedly signed the statement. Id. The employee made two
declarations for Plaintiff, one in which he affirmed that he had seen the alleged
incident and one in which he denied having signed the statement bearing his name
and purported signature. Id. In fact, the employee declared that the co-owners of
the business expressly told him he needed to sign the typewritten statement and
implied that his continued employment was contingent upon signing. Id. The
employee testified that he refused to sign the statement and did not know who

-14-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 15 of 20

signed it. Id. A forensic expert retained by Plaintiff testified that the signature on
the statement was not that of the subject employee. Id. Based on the evidence
presented, the Court concluded that signature on the statement was not that of the
employee and ordered that Defendants' Answer be stricken.
In the instant case, Defendants have cooperated with and acted in good faith
toward Plaintiff at every stage of litigation. Defendants produced the subject pretrip inspection reports to Plaintiff immediately upon discovery of the same, notably
five days before the first depositions of Robin Walker and Donna Austin. When a
discrepancy was noted with the documents, Defendants agreed to allow Plaintiff to
re-depose Joe Rich, Donna Austin, Robin Walker and Larry Jackson at Plaintiff's
counsel's earliest convenience. During his second deposition, Defendant Jackson
provided a clear and concise explanation for how the February 5 and February 6,
2007 pre-trip inspection reports came to be prepared on forms that did not exist
until August 2007 -- specifically, that he had recopied the information from the
original carbon copies onto clean forms. He confirmed that the signatures on the
documents were his and that he did not tell anyone at Sunshine that he had recopied the information from the carbon copies onto a clean form after doing so.
(Ex. E at 8-10.) Unlike the employer in Forsberg, no one at Sunshine did or would
have instructed Jackson to re-copy the information or to fabricate documents. (Ex.

-15-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 16 of 20

G at 29; Ex. J at 10-11; Ex. K at 13-14.) There is absolutely no evidence, and
certainly not clear and convincing evidence, that these documents were created at
any time, in any manner or for any purpose other than that to which Jackson
testified.
Moreover, there is no evidence that Defendants actually destroyed any
documents relevant to the instant action. Defendants concede that they have not
been able to locate the original pre-trip inspection reports and that some documents
in Sunshine's possession had been destroyed by water intrusion, vermin or the
inadvertent acts of Joe Rich's uncle; however, that concession does not amount to a
positive admission that Defendants destroyed these, or any other, documents
relevant to the subject accident. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to meet his
burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that Defendants acted in bad
faith by allegedly destroying relevant documents and Plaintiff's Motion to Strike
Defendants' Answer should be denied.
III. Even Assuming Arguendo That Sunshine's Failure To Locate The
Subject Reports Justifies Sanctions, There Are Lesser Sanctions Which
Would Be More Appropriate Under The Circumstances.
Defendants adamantly deny that Plaintiff is entitled to any sanctions
whatsoever in this case because the pre-trip inspection reports that are the
foundation for Plaintiff's Motion were not fabricated; however, even assuming

-16-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 17 of 20

arguendo that Plaintiff were entitled to sanctions, there are less drastic measures
that this Court can employ to remedy any alleged prejudice caused to Plaintiff by
Defendants' failure to preserve, locate and produce the original February 5 and
February 6, 2007 pre-trip inspection reports.
“Spoliation refers to the destruction or failure to preserve evidence that is
necessary to contemplated or pending litigation.”

Silman v. Associates

Bellemeade, 2009 WL 3334630, 2 (Ga., Oct. 23, 2009). Apart from striking a
party's pleadings, which is a drastic sanction of last resort, lesser potential
sanctions are available to remedy any prejudice resulting from the spoliation of
evidence include a jury charge that spoliation of evidence creates the rebuttable
presumption that the evidence would have been harmful to the spoliator or the
exclusion of testimony about the evidence.

Kelley v. Blue Line Carriers,

LLC 2009 WL 3401984, 2 (Ga. App., Oct. 23, 2009).
At best, the evidence Plaintiff has put forth suggests that Defendants may
have been negligent in failing to preserve evidence, namely the original pre-trip
inspection reports, that was necessary to contemplated litigation. The information
contained in those reports, as reflected in the re-copied versions, supports
Defendants' contentions that the trailer's taillights were functioning and that the
trailer was, in all other respects, compliant with Department of Transportation

-17-

Case 1:08-cv-01693-WSD

Document 53

Filed 11/09/2009

Page 18 of 20

regulations. Because Defendants have been unable to locate and produce the
original documents, however, then Plaintiff may be entitled to a jury instruction
regarding spoliation of evidence or to the exclusion of Defendants' testimony
regarding these reports. Under the circumstances, these lesser sanctions, if any,
would be far more appropriate than the dismissal of Defendants' Answer.
CONCLUSION
Because Plaintiff has failed to produce clear and convincing evidence in
support of his conclusory allegation that Defendants destroyed or fabricated
evidence, Defendants respectfully request that this Court deny Plaintiff's Motion to
Strike Defendants' Answer.
