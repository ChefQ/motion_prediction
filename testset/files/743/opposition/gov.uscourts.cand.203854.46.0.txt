1

I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Jenna Goddard’s (“Plaintiff”) Opposition to Google Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss

2
3

(“Opp.”) rests on a wholesale mischaracterization of her own Complaint. Recognizing that her

4

claims cannot proceed under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“Section 230”),

5

47 U.S.C. § 230 – the Complaint, after all, would hold Google liable for content published by

6

others – Plaintiff asks the Court to ignore the allegations she has actually made, and accept her

7

recharacterization of those allegations instead. The Complaint, for example, defines the putative

8

class as “[a]ll persons or entities who suffered damages as a result of clicking on a Google

9

AdWords advertisement for mobile subscription services which linked to a Fraudulent Mobile

10

Subscription Services website.” ¶40.1 The Opposition, on the other hand, argues Plaintiff’s

11

claims “arise from content created by Google (such as its Content Policy) and Google’s conduct

12

(such as its acceptance of tainted funds) which was (and remains) unrelated to content created by

13

the mobile content providers.” Opp. at 3. It is the Complaint, however, that controls here.

14

Moreover, what Plaintiff wishes she had alleged works no better, because Section 230 also

15

forecloses liability for Google’s alleged failure to invoke an advertising and content policy to

16

prevent the appearance of ads on Google webpages that led Plaintiff to click on purportedly

17

fraudulent websites. No matter how Plaintiff packages her claims, it is perfectly clear that the

18

alleged cause of her harm was fraudulent MSSPs. (“Absent Google’s provision of AdWords

19

services to the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services, the Class members would never have

20

been damaged by the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services.” ¶58.) Plaintiff’s attempt in her

21

Opposition to evade application of Section 230 by treating Google’s Content Policy as the

22

published material that caused her damage goes nowhere, because the Complaint explicitly

23

alleges otherwise and Section 230 still immunizes Google.
Moreover, even without the immunity afforded Google under Section 230, Plaintiff’s

24
25

Complaint would have to be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failing

26

to state valid claims.

content created by the mobile content providers.”2 Opp. at 3. This argument – plainly a device to
avoid application of Section 230 – flies in the face of the plain language of the complaint, and a
host of appellate decisions that reject virtually indistinguishable efforts to evade Section 230.
See, e.g., Doe v. MySpace, 528 F.3d 413 (5th Cir. 2008); Green v. Am. Online, 318 F.3d 465 (3d
Cir. 2003); Gentry v. eBay, Inc., 99 Cal. App. 4th 816 (2002).
Holding a defendant “responsible for content originating from other parties, [] would be
treating it as the publisher . . . contrary to Congress’s expressed intent under section 230(c)(1).”
Gentry, 99 Cal. App. 4th at 831. This, however, is precisely what Plaintiff seeks to do. The sole
basis for each of Plaintiff’s four claims is that she “suffered damages as a result of clicking on a
Google AdWords advertisement for mobile subscription services which linked to a Fraudulent
Mobile Subscription Services website.” ¶ 40.

Though the Complaint focuses primarily on the workings of the mobile content service
industry (in which Google is not a participant), the gravamen of the Complaint is that Plaintiff
was injured after entering her cell phone number on one or more allegedly fraudulent MSSP
websites she viewed after clicking on a Google AdWords advertisement. ¶ 37. Google’s only
connection to the events allegedly causing Plaintiff’s damages is that it accepted ads for
publication on its website. As Plaintiff alleges repeatedly, “[a]bsent Google’s provision of
AdWords services to the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services, the Class members would
never have been damaged by the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services.” ¶¶ 58, 64, 70
(emphasis added).

Each of Plaintiff’s Claims Is An Attempt to Hold Google Liable for the
Publication of Content Provided by Another.

Plaintiff argues that Section 230 does not apply because her claims are “unrelated to

ARGUMENT

Despite arguments to the contrary now, the Complaint is explicit: had Google declined to
publish the allegedly fraudulent MSSP advertisements on its website, Plaintiff would not have
been injured. Whether Plaintiff characterizes her claim as (1) negligence or breach of contract

27
2

28

Plaintiff concedes that Google is an interactive computer service (Opp. at 4) and apparently
agrees that Google is not responsible for the ads that allegedly caused her injury. Opp. at 4.
2
DEFENDANT GOOGLE’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS
Case No. C 08-02738

1

(for failure to remove ads not in compliance with Google’s Content Policy and Advertising

2

Terms), (2) acceptance of unlawful funds (for advertising services that caused Plaintiff’s injury),

3

or (3) aiding and abetting the allegedly fraudulent MSSPs (by allowing them to advertise), each

4

of Plaintiff’s claims depends on the allegedly fraudulent MSSP ad appearing on Google’s

5

website. By pursuing Google for the alleged damage ensuing from these ads, Plaintiff would hold

6

Google liable for their publication. See MySpace, 528 F.3d at 420 (“No matter how artfully

7

Plaintiffs seek to plead their claims, the Court views Plaintiffs’ claims as directed toward

8

MySpace in its publishing, editorial, and/or screening capacities.”).

9

1.

Section 230 Bars Plaintiff’s Section 17200 Claim.

10

Plaintiff argues that her claim for violation of California Business & Professions Code

11

Section 17200 (“Section 17200”) “is independent of the fraudulent mobile content providers’

12

AdWords” and therefore does not seek to treat Google as a publisher for purposes of Section 230.

13

Opp. at 8. The actual allegations of the Complaint do not support this characterization. Plaintiff

14

alleges she was damaged by clicking on an MSSP’s advertisement that Google published:

15

“[a]bsent Google’s provision of AdWords services to the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription

16

Services, the Class members would never have been damaged by the Fraudulent Mobile

17

Subscription Services.”3 ¶ 58.

18

Courts have consistently resisted plaintiffs’ arguments that their claims “do not attempt to

19

treat [the defendant] as a ‘publisher’ of information.” MySpace, 528 F.3d at 419. The

20

longstanding and well-accepted rule is that holding computer services liable for third party

21

content appearing on their websites would impermissibly treat the service as “the publisher or

22

speaker” of that information under Section 230. Id., at 418; Green, 318 F.3d 465; Gentry, 99 Cal.

23

App. 4th 816. Plaintiff’s efforts to circumvent Section 230 are indistinguishable from those

24

arguments the Fifth Circuit and California Court of Appeal rejected in the MySpace and eBay

25

cases. Both cases involve plaintiffs’ arguments that their causes of action premise liability on

26
3

27
28

Plaintiff further alleges that “Absent Google’s knowing violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a), it
would never have provided AdWords services to the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services,
and Class members would never have provided their personal information to the Fraudulent
Mobile Subscription Services (enabling them to place the unauthorized charges).” ¶ 58.
3
DEFENDANT GOOGLE’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS

1

something other than publication of information, and both found the chain of events underlying

2

the claims arose from the publication of third party content on the defendants’ websites,

3

mandating dismissal.

4

The plaintiffs in Gentry, 99 Cal. App. 4th 816, focused on California’s autographed sports

5

memorabilia statute, Cal. Civ. Code § 1739.7, to argue that eBay should be liable for failure to

6

furnish certificates of authenticity for sale of autographed merchandise through its website.

7

Plaintiffs argued their claims sought only “to enforce eBay’s independent duty under the statute

8

to furnish a warranty as the ‘ “provider” of descriptions,’ not as a publisher.” Id. at 831.

9

Recognizing the foundational allegation was that plaintiffs had been injured by purchasing

10

fraudulent merchandise through eBay, the Court held that “enforcement of appellants’ Civil Code

11

§ 1739.7 cause of action is inconsistent with Section 230 because it would ‘stand[] as an obstacle

12

to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.’” Id. at

13

833.

14

The Fifth Circuit employed similar reasoning to dismiss claims against the social

15

networking site, MySpace. MySpace, 528 F.3d 413. Plaintiffs sued MySpace for failing to

16

implement safety measures after minor Julie Doe was assaulted by another MySpace user she met

17

and traded information with through the website. Id. at 419. To evade application of Section

18

230, plaintiffs contended their claims were “predicated solely on MySpace’s failure to implement

19

basic safety measures” and therefore did “not attempt to treat [MySpace] as a ‘publisher’ of

20

information.” The Fifth Circuit disagreed, finding the claims, no matter how packaged,

21

ultimately sought to hold MySpace liable for events resulting from the availability of information

22

on its website. The Court found plaintiffs’ “allegations are merely another way of claiming that

23

MySpace was liable for publishing the communications.” Id. at 419. “If MySpace had not

24

published communications between Julie Doe and [her attacker], including personal contact

25

information, Plaintiffs assert they never would have met and the sexual assault never would have

26

occurred.” Id.

27
28

The rule of MySpace and Gentry is clear: if a claim’s success would render a website
liable for publication of third party content, Section 230 applies and the claims must be
4

1

dismissed.4 It matters not whether a plaintiff characterizes her claims as failure to provide a

2

certificate of authenticity, failure to provide technological safety mechanisms, or unfair

3

competition based on failure to reject an advertisement; if the claim would hold the computer

4

service liable for an injury resulting from third party information available on its website, it is

5

barred.5 Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim must be dismissed under Section 230.6

Plaintiff’s Claims Seek Impermissibly To Hold Google Liable
for Failure to Remove Advertisements On Its Website.

Plaintiff agrees that MSSPs, and not Google, drafted the AdWords advertisements that

10

allegedly caused her injury. Instead, she argues her negligence and contract claims do not depend

11

on these ads, but instead “hinge on information Google created – such as the terms of Google’s

18

Plaintiff relies on FTC v. Accusearch, No. 06-CV-105-D, 2007 WL 4356786 (D. Wyo. Sept. 28,
2007), an unpublished decision from the District of Wyoming, for the principle that Plaintiff’s
Section 17200 claim is independent of the publication of advertisements on Google’s website.
Accusearch addressed the FTC’s claims that defendants had engaged in unlawful sale of private
information. Among other allegations, the FTC claimed defendants “advertised the availability of
phone records, solicited orders, purchased the records from third-party sources for a fee, and then
resold them to the end-consumers.” Id. at *5. Though the court did not apply Section 230 to the
FTC’s claims, its decision was not that a Section 17200 claim falls outside the immunity of
Section 230, but rather that the FTC’s claims were not premised on publication of third party
information. Id. (“Defendants’ argument might be more persuasive if the FTC sought to hold
liable an internet service provider who . . . merely delivered an email containing ill-gotten
consumer phone records.”).

20
21
22

Plaintiff’s argument that “Google’s liability on Goddard’s UCL claim is independent of the
fraudulent mobile content providers’ AdWords” (Opp. at 8), is empty rhetoric. Google’s liability,
as alleged in the Complaint, is entirely dependent on the content of the MSSP advertisements.
Indeed, Plaintiff’s standing to bring suit under Section 17200 is contingent on the injury she
allegedly experienced as a result of clicking on the AdWords advertisement. Branick v. Downey
Savings & Loan, 39 Cal. 4th 235, 241 (Cal. 2006) (standing under Section 17200 requires “injury
in fact”).
6

23

27
28

Plaintiff argues her Section 17200 claim constitutes an “enforcement” of the federal money
laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) and thus falls outside of Section 230. This argument is
little more than an unsupported argument for an exception to Section 230 for state law claims
(such as unfair competition claims) predicated on federal statutes. Because of the desire “to
ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter . . . obscenity, stalking, and
harassment,” § 230(b)(5), Section 230 provides a narrow exception for enforcement of Federal
criminal statutes such as “chapter 71 (relating to obscenity) or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation
of children).” § 230(e)(1). Congress’s express policy in Section 230 establishes conclusively that
it did not intend to expand the range of exceptions beyond those specifically enumerated, and
plaintiff cites no authority to the contrary. Indeed, given the breadth of state unlawful
competition statutes such as Section 17200, such an exception would very nearly swallow the
rule.

Content Policy.” Opp. at 2. Not only does this argument directly conflict with Plaintiff’s

2

allegations that “[a]bsent Google’s provision of AdWords services to the Fraudulent Mobile

3

Subscription Services, the Class members would never have been damaged by the Fraudulent

4

Mobile Subscription Services” (¶¶ 64, 70), it is legally unsupported.

5

The heart of Plaintiff’s negligence and breach of contract claims is that Google failed to

6

enforce its Content Policy by neglecting to remove MSSP ads leading to websites that did not

7

comply with Google’s Content Policy and Advertising Terms. ¶¶ 63, 69. Plaintiff’s argument is

8

far from clear, but whether Google’s Content Policy and Advertising Terms are “information

9

provided by another information content provider” is beside the point; the issue is whether the

10

advertisements were provided by another content provider, and this Plaintiff does not dispute.

11

See e.g., Fair Housing Council v. Roommates.com LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1174 (9th Cir. 2008)

12

(finding website not liable for portions of the site provided by third parties, though defendant was

13

responsible for other content on its site). While it may be that the Complaint alleges that

14

Google’s Content Policy and Advertising Terms is the source of its purported duty, that policy

15

did not cause Plaintiff’s alleged harm. Rather, it is Google’s publication of, or failure to remove,

16

the MSSP advertisements that Plaintiff alleges as the cause of her injury.

17

Plaintiff’s contract and negligence claims are indistinguishable from those in Green, 318

18

F.3d at 468. Green alleged that “AOL negligently failed to live up to its contractual obligations”

19

in its user agreement by declining to remove AOL users who harassed him and transmitted a virus

20

to his computer through AOL chat rooms. Id. at 468. Although it did not address the question of

21

who drafted the AOL user agreement, the Third Circuit dismissed the claims on the grounds that

22

plaintiff’s claims simply sought to hold “AOL liable for its alleged negligent failure to properly

23

police its network for content transmitted by its users . . . [and] would ‘treat’ AOL ‘as the

24

publisher or speaker’ of that content.” Id. at 471. Just as AOL could not be liable under Section

25

230 for breach of contract claims arising from third party information provided through its service

26

(regardless of the drafter of the contract itself), Google is immune from Plaintiff’s claims that it

27

failed to remove noncompliant advertisements, regardless whether Google drafted its Content

28

Policy and Advertising Terms.

Plaintiff relies on a short but confusing litany of cases that are either supportive of
Google’s arguments or taken entirely out of context. In particular, Plaintiff cites to Batzel v.
Smith, 333 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2003) and Fair Housing Council, 521 F.3d 1157. Each of these
cases supports Google’s claim to Section 230 immunity. The issue in Batzel and Fair Housing
was whether a service’s assistance in drafting the allegedly injurious content on its website
removes the content from the purview of “information provided by another information content
provider” for Section 230 purposes. See Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1022 (basic editorial and word
changes insufficient to make the internet service liable for its content); Fair Housing, 521 F.3d at
1175 (Section 230 did not immunize website because the unlawful content resulted from a
detailed questionnaire the website required users to complete). Neither case suggests, as Plaintiff
argues, that an internet service provider could be liable for third party content, such as the MSSP
advertisements at issue here. Nor do these cases support Plaintiff’s otherwise unsupported
premise that “[t]here is no CDA immunity for claims such as these that arise from Google’s own
terms of service.” Opp. at 5. Rather, both Fair Housing and Batzel establish that internet
services, such as Google, cannot be liable under Section 230 for those parts of their websites
provided by third parties, even if the service was responsible for creating other parts of the site.
See Fair Housing, 521 F.3d at 1174 (holding website not liable for comments in the “Additional
Comments” section of site because it did not develop those sections).

Plaintiff Does Not Support Her Argument that Google Can Be
Liable for Failure to Remove Non-Compliant Advertisements.

Mazur v. eBay, Inc., No. C 07-3967, 2008 WL 618988 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 4, 2008), an
unpublished decision on which Plaintiff relies heavily, also supports Google’s claim to immunity
under Section 230. Despite Plaintiff’s suggestions otherwise, Mazur did not involve a website’s
terms and conditions of use, but an FAQ-type webpage eBay provided directly to its users
promising that eBay’s live auction service was safe.7 Id. at *8. The court held Section 230
nevertheless applied to “plaintiff’s assertion that eBay knew of the seller’s illegal conduct and

26

27
28

The eBay publication stated “Bidding on eBay Live Auctions is very safe. All live auctions are
run by reputable international auction houses, which are carefully screened by eBay before being
authorized to sell to you.” Id. at *8.
7
DEFENDANT GOOGLE’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS

1

failed to prevent it.” Id. at *9. Similarly, “eBay’s assertion that the auction houses were screened

2

is not actionable because “lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a

3

publisher’s traditional editorial functions – such as deciding whether to publish . . . – are barred.”

4

Id. at *9 (citations omitted). The court concluded that while eBay could not be liable under

5

Section 230 for its “assurances of accuracy or promise to remove unauthorized auctioneers,” it

6

could be liable for misrepresentations since “eBay promised that Live Auctions were safe” and

7

this did not involve the “publisher’s editorial function.” Id. at *12.

8
9

Plaintiff here, however, is not alleging fraud, but contending Google breached its Content
Policy by failing to remove the MSSP ads that did not comply with its Content Policy and

10

Advertising Terms. Thus, Plaintiff would do exactly what the court said Mazur could not: hold a

11

service liable for an alleged “promise to remove” noncompliant members. This is precisely the

12

sort of claim Congress disallowed with Section 230.8

13

3.

14

Plaintiff’s Aiding and Abetting Claim is Barred by the CDA.

Plaintiff relies on a single out-of-context quote from Fair Housing, 521 F.3d at 1175 – a

15

case that nowhere mentions aiding and abetting – to argue that claims for aiding and abetting

16

“fall[] outside the scope of the CDA.” Opp. at 11. Plaintiff does not argue that her aiding and

17

abetting claim would not hold Google liable for publication of MSSP ads; instead she argues that

18

aiding and abetting is somehow outside of Section 230. There is no support for this argument.

19

Section 230(e)(3) provides expressly, plainly, and without exception for aiding and abetting

20

claims, that “[n]o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any

21

State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.” § 230(e)(3). See PatentWizard, Inc. v.

22

Kinko’s Inc., 163 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (D.S.D. 2001) (dismissing aiding and abetting claim pursuant

23

to Section 230). Plaintiff’s proposed exception to Section 230 would swallow the rule, since all

24
25
26
27
28

8

Although the facts alleged and the language of the Content Policy and Advertising Terms make
it plain that Google makes no representation as to the safety of its advertisers’ websites, Google
would be immune for such representations, in any event, as long as they were based only on “a
regurgitation of its users’ representations.” Id. at *11 (distinguishing Doe v. SexSearch.com, 502
F. Supp. 2d 719 (N.D. Ohio 2007)). Because the signing of the Content Policy and Advertising
Terms was a representation by Google’s AdWords customers, Google could not be liable for any
alleged assurance derived from that representation.
8
DEFENDANT GOOGLE’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS

1

publication of unlawful content would, under Plaintiff’s definition, amount to aiding and abetting

2

the alleged unlawfulness.

3
4

4.

Google’s Content Policy Falls Within the Scope of Section 230(c)(2)(A).

In asserting that liability can be predicated on Google’s Content Policy, Plaintiff once

5

again, and without legal authority, argues this Court should ignore the plain language of Section

6

230(c), which provides that no interactive computer service “shall be held liable on account of . . .

7

any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access or availability of material.” §

8

230(c)(2). Opp. at 6. Congress’s purpose in enacting Section 230 was to encourage efforts to

9

restrict objectionable material, and to ensure that such efforts do not create additional liability

10

risks. Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003). Google’s

11

Content Policy and Advertising Terms is just such an effort to limit certain kinds of ads and thus

12

cannot create liability for Google’s alleged failure to enforce its terms. Although Plaintiff argues

13

that Google’s issuance of the Content Policy and Advertising Terms was not an “action” taken to

14

“restrict availability” of noncompliant MSSP ads, Plaintiff alleges in her Complaint that these

15

documents expressly discourage ads that do not meet certain specifications. ¶ 22. Thus, by

16

Plaintiff’s other allegations, Google’s Content Policy and Advertising Terms are at least in part an

17

effort to restrict objectionable material, and Plaintiff’s contract and negligence claims must be

18

dismissed as an attempt to hold Google liable for these policies.

19
20
21

B.

Whether or Not Section 230 Applies, Plaintiff Does Not State Viable Claims.
1.

Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Under Section 17200.

Plaintiff’s Opposition does not resolve the deficiencies in her claim that Google engaged

22

in unfair competition through a predicate violation of the federal money laundering statute, 18

23

U.S.C. § 1957(a). In particular, she has not alleged (and cannot) that Google’s acceptance of

24

payment for the allegedly fraudulent MSSP advertisements violated the federal money laundering

25

statute, because the MSSPs did not derive those funds from a “specified unlawful activity” and

26

because, even if they had, Google could not possibly have had the requisite knowledge that the

27

funds were unlawfully obtained as a matter of law.

a.

2

Plaintiff Fails To State A Claim for Violation of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act.

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”) is an anti-hacking statute that does not

3
4

contemplate Plaintiff’s attenuated claim regarding the MSSPs alleged transmission of mobile

5

content to cell phones. See e.g., Shamrock Foods Co. v. Gast, 535 F. Supp. 2d 962, 965-66

6

(D. Ariz. 2008); In re Doubleclick Privacy Litig., 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). To

7

state a claim that the allegedly fraudulent MSSPs violated the CFAA, Plaintiff must allege facts

8

establishing that the MSSPs “accesse[d] a protected computer without authorization” and

9

furthered a fraud or caused damage by way of that access. Shamrock Foods Co., 535 F. Supp. 2d

10

at 965-66. Plaintiff cannot do so here.
Plaintiff is unable to establish that the allegedly fraudulent MSSPs accessed her cell phone

11
12

at all. Although Plaintiff argues that “mobile content providers accessed her . . . cellular phone[]

13

by sending her unauthorized mobile content” (Opp. at 12), merely sending such information

14

cannot constitute “access” for purposes of the CFAA without the absurd result that any

15

transmission of mobile content, text messages, emails and so forth would constitute access to a

16

cell phone or computer for purposes of the CFAA. Moreover, Plaintiff’s Opposition indicates

17

that it is not the MSSPs that accessed Plaintiff’s cell phone, but either (1) the aggregators who

18

serve as middlemen actually responsible for transmission of the mobile content, or (2) the mobile

19

content itself.9 Regardless of who, if anyone, accessed Plaintiff’s cell phone, it very clearly is

20

not the MSSPs, and the MSSPs therefore could not have violated the CFAA.
Plaintiff’s opposition also fails to resolve the deficiencies in her claim that the MSSPs

21
22

caused damage “by means of” accessing her cell phone as required under the CFAA. American

23

Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rickman, 554 F. Supp. 2d 766, 770-71 (N.D. Ohio 2008). Although

24

Plaintiff argues that the CFAA should be treated as mail fraud, such that the access need only be

25

“incident” to the scheme (Opp. at 15), this does not square with the legislative history or courts’

26
9

27
28

“The design of the infrastructure for mobile content also requires mobile content providers’
transmissions to aggregators (the middlemen between mobile content providers and cellular
carriers) to include both the mobile content which accesses consumers’ cellular phones and the
instructions necessary to charge consumers for the mobile content.” Opp. at 15 (emphasis added).
10

1

interpretation of the CFAA. Unlike mail fraud, the CFAA was designed precisely to target a

2

specific offense – computer hacking – and “the legislative history supports a narrow view of the

3

CFAA.” Shamrock Foods Co., 535 F. Supp. 2d at 965. Because the MSSPs did not violate the

4

CFAA, Plaintiff has failed to allege that Google accepted funds derived from a specific unlawful

5

activity and Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim must be dismissed.

6
7
8
9

b.

Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim That Google Knowingly
Accepted Criminally Derived Funds.

Even were it true that the MSSPs’ alleged conduct violates the CFAA, Plaintiff cannot
state a claim that Google “knowingly engage[d] . . . in a monetary transaction in criminally

10

derived property of a value greater than $10,000” for purposes of § 1957(a). See, e.g., Mazur,

11

2008 WL 618988 at *3 (“A motion to dismiss should be granted if plaintiff fails to proffer

12

‘enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”) (citations omitted). As

13

Plaintiff concedes, Google’s liability depends on its knowing that the MSSPs’ payments were

14

themselves criminally derived. Opp. at 16; see also United States v. Yagman, 502 F. Supp. 2d

15

1084 (C.D. Cal. 2007); United States v. Stein, 37 F.3d 1407, 1410 (9th Cir. 1994). The threshold

16

for funds to be “criminally derived” is high: the funds must be traceable directly to an underlying

17

crime and cannot have been commingled with lawfully obtained funds. Rutgard v. United States,

18

116 F.3d 1270, 1292-3 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that Congress enacted Section 1957 as a tool in the

19

war against drugs and warning against an expansive application).

20

Plaintiff argues Google had the requisite knowledge because “Google knew that fraud was

21

endemic in the mobile content industry.” Opp. at 17. Even if that were true, however, it is not

22

sufficient to establish that Google had any knowledge or belief that the payments it received from

23

its MSSP advertisers were “criminally derived.” Although all facts should be interpreted in the

24

light most favorable to Plaintiff, dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) “can be based on the

25

lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable

26

legal theory.” Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). Dismissal is

27

appropriate where, as here, the “plaintiff fails to proffer ‘enough facts to state a claim to relief that

28

is plausible on its face.’” Mazur, 2008 WL 618988 at * 3. In this instance, Plaintiff cannot allege
11
DEFENDANT GOOGLE’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS
Case No. C 08-02738

1

any remotely plausible set of facts that would establish that Google could possibly have known

2

that all of the monies it received from its MSSP customers were criminally derived.

3

2.

4

Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for Breach of Contract.

Plaintiff’s claim to be an intended beneficiary of Google’s Content Policy is inconsistent

5

with the allegations of the Complaint, the Opposition, and abundant case law establishing that the

6

incidental beneficiaries of user agreements are not intended beneficiaries for contract purposes.10

7

See, e.g., Green, 318 F.3d at 472 (AOL user agreement); Highfields Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Doe,

8

385 F. Supp. 2d 969, 980 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (Yahoo! service agreement). It is not enough to

9

benefit from an agreement; under California law, there must be an actual expression of intent by

10

an agreement’s promisee to benefit the third party. Souza v. Westlands Water Dist., 135 Cal.

11

App. 4th 879, 893 (Cal. App. 2006).

12

Google cannot be liable for a promise it did not make. Souza, 135 Cal. App. 4th 879 (Cal.

13

App. 2006). Because Plaintiff cannot point to anything in the Content Policy and Advertising

14

Terms constituting a promise by Google that it would ensure users that its advertisers were in

15

compliance with the terms, Plaintiff takes the untenable position that Google is liable as a

16

promisor of the entire Content Policy and Advertising Terms because Google is a promisor of

17

certain provisions of the agreement. Opp. at 20. Not only is this argument incompatible with

18

basic contract principles, it runs directly counter to Souza, 135 Cal. App. 4th 879, in which the

19

court found, in an analogous service agreement, that the water district was not a promisor of the

20

terms imposing certain requirements on the water district’s customers. Id. at 893. As promisee,

21

Google cannot be liable for the MSSPs alleged promise to provide certain information on their

22

landing pages. See id. Plaintiff does not ever discuss Souza, let alone distinguish it.

23
24
25
10

26
27
28

The Complaint alleges Google created its Content Policy to benefit itself (i.e., to “create the
appearance that its search engine is protecting users’ interests” and “hopes to lull governmental
agencies into falsely believing that Google is acting responsibly”) ¶¶ 31-32. The Opposition
asserts “Google’s motivation behind [sic] Content Policy was to create the appearance to the
public and to regulators that it is acting to prevent [ ] fraud.” Opp. at 7.

3.

Plaintiff’s Negligence Claim is Barred by California Law.

Although the existence of a duty is the sine qua non of any negligence claim, Plaintiff

2
3

provides no authority for the proposition that Google owed Plaintiff any duty. Instead, Plaintiff

4

relies on Mazur v. eBay, Inc., 2008 WL 618988, an affirmative misrepresentation case that sheds

5

no light on Plaintiff’s negligence claim here,11 and a series of cases that hold an entity can be

6

liable for assuming a duty where the entity provides a “seal of approval” and the plaintiff is then

7

injured after actually relying on that endorsement. See, e.g., Hanberry v. Hearst Corp., 276 Cal.

8

App. 2d 680, 684 (1969); FNS Mortgage Service Corp. v. Pacific Gen. Group, Inc., 24 Cal. App.

9

4th 1564, 1567-68 (1994).

10

Plaintiff bypasses her failure to allege a duty, arguing her claim is for negligent

11

undertaking for Google’s “failure to enforce the terms of the Content Policy.” This theory runs

12

contrary to California law. As a threshold matter, Plaintiff has not alleged that Google undertook

13

to remove non-compliant MSSP websites or that it endorsed any MSSP website. Moreover, the

14

California Supreme Court in Paz v. State of California, 22 Cal. 4th 550, 560 (2000), establishes

15

that Google cannot be liable for its allegedly negligent failure to enforce its Content Policy unless

16

either (1) the Content Policy actually increased Plaintiff’s risk of injury; or (2) Plaintiff relied on

17

the Content Policy to her detriment. Id. at 560. Plaintiff has alleged neither.
Perhaps recognizing that her attempt to distinguish Paz is unavailing, Plaintiff relegates

18
19

her discussion to a footnote. Plaintiff argues that “Paz only means that the duty imposed by a

20

defendant’s undertaking does not include instantaneously eliminating any preexisting risks of

21

harm the moment the undertaking begins.” Opp. at 22-3 n.15. Paz holds no such thing. The Paz

22

plaintiff alleged liability for defendants’ failure to provide operational traffic signals despite

23

earlier promises. Paz, 22 Cal. 4th at 555. The Court nevertheless found, because defendants’

24
25
11

26
27
28

Plaintiff argues that the Mazur court allowed a claim for negligence “on virtually the same set
of facts alleged by Goddard.” Opp. at 21. Not so. Rather, the claims in Mazur alleged eBay
made affirmative statements to the plaintiff that its live auctions were “safe,” Mazur, 2008 WL
618988, *10. Plaintiff here has made no such claim and does not allege that Google ever made
direct promises to her regarding the safety of MSSPs.
13
DEFENDANT GOOGLE’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS

1

conduct had not “increased the risk of physical harm to plaintiff beyond that which allegedly

2

[already] existed,” defendants were not liable under a negligent undertaking theory.12 Id. at 559.

3

Plaintiff also relies on a series of inapposite cases that hold that an advertiser or similar

4

service may be liable where customers rely on its direct representations that its advertisers are

5

safe. See Hanberry, 276 Cal. App. 2d at 684 (Good Housekeeping’s “seal of approval”); FNS

6

Mortgage Service Corp., 24 Cal. App. 4th at 1567-68 (local building code official’s reliance on

7

defendant’s certification that plumbing products met uniform standards criteria). Plaintiff,

8

however, does not allege either that Google made any direct representation, or that she relied on

9

anything in making her decision to use Google’s search engine or to enter her telephone numbers

10

on MSSP websites. Because Plaintiff failed to allege that (1) the Content Policy actually

11

increased her risk of injury (which it obviously did not); or (2) that she relied on the Content

12

Policy to her detriment, she has not stated a claim for negligence. See Paz, 22 Cal. 4th at 560.

13

4.

Plaintiff States No Claim for Aiding and Abetting.

14

Plaintiff provides no authority to support her assertion that providing advertising services

15

is sufficient to constitute “substantial assistance” for purposes of pleading an aiding and abetting

16

claim. Indeed, the cases upon which she relies underscore that the threshold for “substantial

17

assistance” is considerably higher than the mere provision of advertising services. See Henry v.

18

Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc., 471 F.3d 977, 995 (9th Cir. 2006) (affirming jury verdict of

19

aiding and abetting because defendant satisfied “all of First Alliance’s financing needs,” “kept

20

First Alliance in business, knowing that its financial difficulties stemmed directly and indirectly

21

from litigation over its dubious lending practices,” and admitted that it provided “significant

22

assistance to First Alliance’s business”); Casey v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n., 127 Cal. App. 4th 1138,

23

1142 (Cal. App. 2005) (noting bank could be liable for aiding and abetting money laundering by

24

allowing opening of accounts with invalid tax identification numbers, removal of hundreds of

25
26
12

27
28

Plaintiff’s reliance on Mukthar v. Latin American Security Service, 139 Cal. App. 4th 284 (Cal.
App. 2006), is similarly misplaced. Mukthar holds that a security service may be negligent where
it agrees to provide a security guard and then fails to do so. Plaintiff cannot point to any
indication that Google promised to remove or take any action in response to noncompliant ads.

1

thousands of dollars of cash in unmarked duffel bags, payment of obviously forged negotiable

2

instruments, etc.).

3

Nor is Plaintiff’s allegation that Google’s AdWords services is “an essential part of the

4

[alleged] scheme, because [the mobile content providers] could not collect unwitting users’

5

cellular phone numbers without Google driving Internet traffic towards their landing pages,”

6

sufficient to plead an aiding and abetting claim. Opp. at 24 (emphasis in original). Plaintiff’s

7

reasoning would lead to unbounded liability for aiding and abetting claims, and there is no

8

support for such an expansive reading of the law.

III.
