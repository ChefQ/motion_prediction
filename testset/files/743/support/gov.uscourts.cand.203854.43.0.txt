5

Court, 280 S. First Street, San Jose, CA 95113, Google Inc. will move the court for an order

6

dismissing Plaintiff’s Class Action Complaint pursuant to the Communications Decency Act, 47

7

U.S.C. § 230, (“Section 230”), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). This motion is

8

based on the Notice of Motion and Motion, the supporting Memorandum of Points and

9

Authorities, the [Proposed] Order, all pleadings on file in this action, oral argument of counsel,

10

and any other matter that may be submitted at the hearing.

STATEMENT OF ISSUES

12

1.

Are Plaintiff’s state law claims barred as a matter of law by Section 230 of the

13

Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230, which establishes immunity against state law

14

claims for interactive computer service providers?

15

2.

Has Plaintiff stated a claim under California Business & Professions Code section

16

17200, et seq. (the “UCL” or “Section 17200”), when she fails to plead facts that would support a

17

claim of the predicate violation of law, 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a)?

18

3.

Has Plaintiff alleged a claim for breach of contract when she has not pled – and

19

cannot plead – that she was an intended beneficiary of the alleged contract or that any promise

20

was made to enforce the alleged terms in her favor?

21

4.

Is Plaintiff’s claim for negligence barred as a matter of law?

22

5.

Has Plaintiff pled any facts that would support any claim for aiding and abetting?

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS & AUTHORITIES
I.

INTRODUCTION.
The Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230(c), immunizes Internet companies

26

like Google against any state law claim that would treat it as the publisher or speaker of

27

information provided by a third party. Plaintiff Jenna Goddard’s complaint seeks to do precisely

28

that and thus fails to state a claim as a matter of law.
-1-

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

Plaintiff’s claims against Google are the latest in a series of cases against mobile

2

subscription service providers (“MSSPs”), billing aggregators, and cellular telephone companies

3

involved in the distribution and billing for mobile content services such as telephone ring tones,

4

wallpaper, games, daily horoscopes and similar functionality. After a cell phone user subscribes

5

to a mobile content service through the subscriber’s telephone or the mobile content service’s

6

website, the MSSP provides the information to a billing aggregator who ensures that the charges

7

for the service are placed on the subscriber’s cellular telephone bill. Plaintiff contends she was

8

charged for services she did not authorize after she gave her cellular phone number to an MSSP

9

website. Google’s only connection to the alleged misconduct is that Plaintiff claims she found

10

fraudulent MSSPs through a Google search. Google provided Plaintiff with no mobile

11

subscription services itself, nor did Google participate in any way in charging her for MSSP

12

services. Google had nothing to do with the series of events that led to any alleged unauthorized

13

charges and has been hauled into Court for nothing more than allowing paid advertisements

14

containing links to one or more allegedly misleading MSSP websites. Section 230(c) was enacted

15

to immunize Internet companies from having to face suit on exactly these types of claims;

16

dismissal at the pleading stage is both warranted and appropriate. Moreover, even in the absence

17

of Section 230(c) immunity, Plaintiff has failed to plead any viable claim. Accordingly, as

18

discussed below, each of her claims should be dismissed with prejudice.

19

II.

20

RULE 12(b)(6) STANDARD.
Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim “can be based on the lack of a

21

cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.”

22

Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990). In deciding a motion to

23

dismiss, “all allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable

24

to the nonmoving party.” Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996).

25

Plaintiff’s claims against Google should be dismissed with prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6) of the

26

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the immunity accorded Google by 47 U.S.C. § 230(c).

1

III.

THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT.
Defendant Google Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Mountain View,

2
3

California that provides Internet services to the public. Complaint ¶ 2.1 Plaintiff alleges that

4

Google “operates the most widely-used Internet search engine in the world” and maintains the

5

“largest, most comprehensive index of websites and other online content.” Id. Google generates

6

revenue primarily by online advertising, including its AdWords program. ¶ 2.
Plaintiff alleges that she was injured by providing her cell phone number to one or more

7
8

unidentified MSSPs by entering her number on one or more MSSP websites. ¶ 37. She claims to

9

have visited the Google search engine in December 2007 to find a cell phone ringtone provider.

10

¶ 35. Once there, Plaintiff alleges she entered terms like “ringtone” into the Google search engine

11

(¶ 35), leading her to a display of AdWords advertisements “as part of the result of the search.”

12

¶ 16. Plaintiff “clicked on one or more of the AdWords advertisements appearing along the

13

search results” (¶ 35), which led her to websites belonging to MSSPs that she does not identify. ¶

14

36. Plaintiff alleges she entered her telephone number onto “one or more” such MSSP websites.

15

¶¶ 36-37. Although Plaintiff identifies none of the MSSPs, their website addresses, or the

16

wireless carrier that imposed the unauthorized charges, she claims the MSSP websites did not

17

display information required pursuant to Google’s Advertising Program Terms, and specifically

18

Google’s AdWords Content Policy. ¶ 36. Plaintiff does not allege that she read or relied upon

19

Google’s Content Policy prior to locating a MSSP through the Google search engine.
After entering her telephone number into “one or more” MSSP websites, Plaintiff’s

20
21

cellular telephone bill was charged “by one or more purveyors of mobile subscription services

22

and their agents, including m-Qube, for unwanted mobile content services.” ¶¶ 37, 39. Plaintiff

23

does not allege that Google was involved in creating the MSSP website(s) that supposedly

24

defrauded her, or that Google ever received any monies from Plaintiff. The only link alleged

25

between Google and Plaintiff is that the MSSP websites she landed on were Google AdWords

26

customers. ¶¶ 33-39.

28

References to paragraph numbers (“¶ __”) herein refer to the Complaint, unless otherwise
indicated.
-3-

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

Plaintiff further alleges that Google’s AdWords program allows its advertising customers

2

to draft short advertisements and select corresponding keywords using Google-supplied

3

optimization tools, and that when a Google user enters a search query in the Google search engine

4

that matches the advertising customer’s selected keywords, the Google website displays the

5

customer’s advertisements. ¶¶ 15-16. Users can click on the advertisement, which leads the

6

user’s internet browser to the advertiser’s website. Id.

7

Before advertisers may participate in Google’s AdWords program, they must agree to

8

Google’s Advertising Program Terms, which require compliance with Google’s policies

9

(including its AdWords Content Policy), payment and cancellation terms, and similar

10

requirements. ¶¶ 21-22 and Ex. A. Plaintiff alleges Google imposes additional requirements on

11

certain types of advertisers, including MSSPs, obligating them to conform the content of their

12

websites to display certain information, including price, subscription period, and cancellation

13

procedures. ¶¶ 18, 22. Plaintiff does not allege when Google put these requirements in place, but

14

alleges that the Content Policy contained language specifically pertaining to MSSPs as early as

15

2008. ¶ 22.

16

IV.

17

LEGAL ARGUMENT.
The Communications Decency Act , 47 U.S.C. § 230(c), immunizes providers and users

18

of interactive computer services from liability for editorial decisions regarding the posting,

19

screening, and deletion of third party content available through such a service. Claims falling

20

within Section 230 immunity are properly resolved on a motion to dismiss. See Green v. America

21

Online (AOL), 318 F.3d 465 (3d Cir. 2003) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff’s claims under

22

section 230); Doe v. MySpace, Inc., 528 F.3d 413 (5th Cir. 2008) (same); Langdon v. Google, 474

23

F. Supp. 2d 622, 631 (D. Del. 2007) (dismissing claims against Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft on

24

the grounds that each is immune as an interactive service provider under Section 230); Parker v.

25

Google, 422 F. Supp. 2d 492 (E.D. Pa. 2006), aff’m, 242 Fed. Appx. 833, 838 (3d Cir. 2007)

27

under Section 230).

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1
2
3

A.

Plaintiff’s Claims are Barred by Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act.

To realize the Internet’s full promise as a medium for the exchange of ideas and

4

information, Congress has immunized providers of internet services such as Google from liability

5

for content posted by others, but made accessible through, e.g., Google. Carafano v.

6

Metrosplash, 339 F.3d 1119, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003). In 1996, Congress enacted Section 230,

7

which provides in pertinent part, that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service

8

shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information

9

content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1).

10

To encourage voluntary monitoring, Section 230 also immunizes providers of internet

11

services from liability for taking actions to limit objectionable material. 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2)

12

(“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of … any

13

action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the

14

provider or user considers to be . . . otherwise objectionable.”).

15

Plaintiff’s sole contention against Google is that she was harmed by an allegedly

16

misleading website she found through an advertisement an MSSP had placed on the Google

17

website through the AdWords program. Plaintiff does not claim that Google created the allegedly

18

fraudulent website, subscribed her to a mobile content service, or added charges for mobile

19

subscription services to her cellular telephone bill. Instead Plaintiff claims that she “clicked on

20

one or more of the AdWords advertisements appearing along the search results,” and then she

21

navigated to the allegedly fraudulent MSSP website where she entered her phone number, leading

22

to the alleged injury. ¶ 35.

23

Based on this single incident, Plaintiff claims that Google should be liable for her injury

24

(1) because she accessed the allegedly fraudulent MSSP website through an advertisement

25

appearing on the Google website and (2) because Google allegedly did not fully enforce its

26

Content Policy, which allegedly required Google’s MSSP advertisers to post certain information

27

on their websites. As demonstrated below, Google, as a provider of an interactive computer

28

service, cannot be liable for damage resulting from the allegedly misleading MSSP website, the
-5-

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

advertisement the MSSP placed on the Google website through the AdWords program, or for

2

Google’s efforts (such as its Content Policy) to restrict such content. These claims are precisely

3

the types of claims Congress intended to bar through Section 230.

4

1.

5
6

Under Section 230, Google Is Immune from Plaintiff’s Claims that
She Was Injured By An Advertisement Appearing on the Google
Website.

A defendant is immune from liability under Section 230 for the content of postings on its

7

website if: (1) it qualifies as a provider or user of an interactive computer service; and (2) the

8

plaintiff’s claims would hold the defendant liable as a publisher or distributor of information

9

created or developed by “another information content provider.” Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1123.

10

Creation and development “means something more substantial than merely editing portions.”

11

Batzel v. Smith, 333 F.3d 1018, 1030-31 (9th Cir. 2003). To further Congress’s goal of ensuring

12

the free flow of information on the Internet, “reviewing courts have treated § 230(c) immunity as

13

quite robust.” Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1123.

14

a.

Google is a Provider of An Interactive Computer Service.

15

There can be no dispute that Google qualifies as a “provider of interactive computer

16

service” as broadly defined by Section 230(f)(2).2 The Ninth Circuit defines an interactive

17

computer service as “‘any’ information services or other systems, as long as the service or system

18

allows “multiple users” to access “a computer server.’” Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1030 (emphasis in

19

original) (rejecting expressly district court’s more restrictive definition). Interactive computer

20

services include internet dating services, newsletters, listservs, search engines, auction websites,

21

and social networking sites among many other services. See, e.g., Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1123

22

(internet dating service is provider of interactive computer service); Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1030

23

(internet newsletter); Doe v. MySpace, Inc., 528 F.3d at 419 (social networking site); Gentry v.

24

eBay, Inc., 99 Cal. App. 4th 816 (2002) (online auction program); Almeida v. Amazon.com, Inc.,

25
2

26
27

Section 230(f)(2) defines “interactive computer service” as “any information service, system, or
access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and
such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions.”

456 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir. 2006) (internet retailer). Google’s status as an interactive computer

2

service under Section 230 has already been adjudicated in a number of federal courts. Langdon v.

3

Google, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 631 (dismissing claims against Google and other interactive computer

4

service providers under Section 230); Parker v. Google, 422 F. Supp. 2d at 500-01 (“[T]here is no

b.

Plaintiff’s Alleged Injury Was Caused by Information
“Provided by Another Information Content Provider.”

It is equally clear that Plaintiff’s alleged injury was the result of information provided by

11

“another information content provider.” According to Plaintiff’s allegations, the causes of her

12

injuries are (1) the misleading website created and operated by an allegedly fraudulent MSSP and

13

(2) the advertisement on Google’s website on which Plaintiff clicked to be transported to the

14

MSSP’s website. Because Google did not provide the content of either the allegedly misleading

15

MSSP website or the MSSP advertisement on Google’s website, this content constitutes

16

“information provided by another information content provider” for purposes of Section 230 and

17

Google cannot be held liable as its publisher. Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1123.

18

An “information content provider” is “any person or entity that is responsible, in whole or

19

in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other

20

interactive computer service.” § 230(f)(3). A defendant is not an “information content provider”

21

unless it bears actual “responsibility for the ‘underlying misinformation’” at issue. Carafano, 339

22

F.3d at 1123, 1125 (noting that “reviewing courts have treated § 230(c) immunity as quite robust,

23

adopting a . . . relatively restrictive definition of ‘information content provider’”). “Minor

24

wording changes” and “neutral forms and tools” to assist with development and creation of

25

content do not transform an interactive computer services provider into a content provider.

26

Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1171; Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1022. Rather, a service is not a content provider

27

unless the service directly contributed to the creation of the unlawful content at issue in the case.

28

Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1124 (“[T]he critical issue is whether [the defendant] acted as an
-7-

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

information content provider with respect to the information that [plaintiffs] claim is false or

2

misleading.”); Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, 521 F.3d 1157,

3

1175 (9th Cir. 2008) (“The message to website operators is clear: If you don’t encourage illegal

4

content, or design your website to require users to input illegal content, you will be immune.”).

5

The Complaint contains many details regarding the nature and extent of the alleged

6

wrongdoing by MSSPs, ¶¶ 6-12, but never contends that Google played any role in creating,

7

developing, or providing any content whatsoever for the “one or more” misleading MSSP

8

websites that Plaintiff claims to have visited in search of ringtones. Nor does Plaintiff point to

9

any facts supporting the conclusion that Google had any responsibility for providing any

10

misleading information to her. The only link to Google that Plaintiff can muster is that the

11

allegedly misleading website she landed upon was maintained by a Google AdWords customer

12

that she located through a Google search engine query. However, as Plaintiff admits, Google is

13

not a “content provider” of advertisements posted to its site; rather, Google AdWords

14

advertisements are created when “Google’s advertiser customers draft short advertisements” and

15

“select keywords that correspond to their advertisements.” ¶ 15. Thus, it is the MSSP, not

16

Google, that provided the content of any advertisement she encountered as a result of a Google

17

query. Plaintiff’s allegation that “Google assists its customers in drafting AdWords and selecting

18

keywords,” ¶ 15, does not change the analysis; Plaintiff does not allege that Google contributes to

19

any allegedly misleading content.

20

The courts have made clear that the provision of neutral tools, including keyword search

21

functions, is squarely within the protections afforded by the CDA. In Chicago Lawyers’

22

Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666 (7th Cir. 2008), the

23

Seventh Circuit held the online classified website craigslist immune from liability for

24

discriminatory housing advertisements submitted by users because there was no basis to conclude

25

that craigslist provided any of the discriminatory content. “Nothing in the service craigslist offers

26

induces anyone to post any particular listing or express a preference for discrimination.” 519

27

F.3d at 671-72. The Ninth Circuit came to the same conclusion in Fair Housing Council of San

28

Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1173-75 (9th Cir. 2008). The Ninth
-8-

1

Circuit en banc panel found that Section 230 immunity applies unless “it is very clear that the

2

website directly participates in developing the illegality” at issue. Id. at 1174 (emphasis added).

3

The Court held that Roommates.com was a content provider and not entitled to immunity when it

4

required its users to disclose (through answers to a user questionnaire) discriminatory information

5

as a condition of using its services. Id. at 1164. However, the Ninth Circuit drew a clear

6

distinction between active development of illegal content and the provision of neutral tools to

7

assist a website user. It ruled that Roommates.com was not liable for discriminatory statements

8

posted by its users in an “Additional Comments” section of profile pages because it had no role in

9

developing the alleged illegal content and expressly found that the provision of keyword search

10
11
12
13
14
15

tools was protected under Section 230:
Providing neutral tools for navigating websites is fully protected by
CDA immunity, absent substantial affirmative conduct on the part of
the website creator promoting the use of such tools for unlawful
purposes.
Id. at 1174, n. 37 (emphasis added).
Nothing in Plaintiff’s Complaint supports a conclusion that Google “directly participate[d]

16

in developing the illegality” at issue. Plaintiff does not allege any facts upon which one could

17

conclude that Google provided any of the allegedly misleading content in either the MSSP

18

websites or the advertisements those MSSP’s created using Google’s AdWords program.

19
20
21

c.

Section 230 Immunizes Google From Any Liability Arising
From the MSSP Advertisements on its Website.

In an attempt to artfully plead around Section 230, Plaintiff has deployed the same

22

insufficient factual underpinnings in support of claims of an alleged violation of Section 17200,

23

negligence, breach of contract, and aiding and abetting. The law, however, is clear: Google is

24

immune from any state law cause of action that seeks to hold it liable for the third party content

25

appearing on its website. See 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(3) (“No cause of action may be brought and no

26

liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.”).

27

Each of Plaintiff’s claims seeks to hold Google liable for the same set of facts – an alleged injury

28
-9-

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

arising from a third party advertisement placed on Google’s website – and each of Plaintiff’s

2

claims is therefore barred under Section 230.

3

Courts consistently resist plaintiffs’ “artful pleading” efforts to place their claims outside

4

the scope of Section 230. MySpace, 528 F.3d at 419-20 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding MySpace

5

immune under Section 230 for failure to implement better technology to protect minors from

6

predatory MySpace users, despite plaintiffs’ arguments that such claims were outside the scope of

7

Section 230); see also Green, 318 F.3d at 471 (holding America Online immune under Section

8

230 for a computer virus launched by a user through an America Online chat room); Gentry, 99

9

Cal. App. 4th 816 (rejecting plaintiffs’ arguments that claims of failure to provide certificates of

10

authenticity for autographed sports memorabilia under California Civil Code Section 1739.7 were

11

outside the scope of Section 230).

12

Recognizing that Section 230 applies to any cause of action for injury arising from third

13

party content, courts have held interactive computer service providers immune from claims under

14

Section 17200, state securities laws, and cyberstalking statutes, and for trade libel, invasion of

15

privacy, misappropriation of the right of publicity, negligence, and defamation, among other

16

claims. Carafano, 339 F.3d 1119 (immunity for invasion of privacy, misappropriation of the

17

right of publicity, and negligence); Batzel, 333 F.3d 1018 (defamation); Universal

18

Communication Systems v. Lycos, 478 F.3d 413, 415 (1st Cir. 2007) (state securities and

19

cyberstalking statutes); Optinrealbig.com v. Ironport Systems, 323 F. Supp. 2d 1037 (N.D. Cal.

20

2004) (trade libel); Gentry, 99 Cal. App. 4th at 836 (Section 17200 and California Civil Code

21

Section 1739.7).

22

Plaintiff alleges she was injured by unauthorized charges placed on her cell phone bill

23

after she provided her cell phone number to a MSSP website. The entirety of her claim against

24

Google is that she discovered the MSSP website through an advertisement the MSSP placed on

25

Google. Each of her claims – for violation of Section 17200, breach of contract, negligence, and

26

aiding and abetting – arises from this single allegation and each seeks to hold Google liable for

27

the advertisement. Because Google cannot be liable under Section 230 for any injury arising

28

1

from an advertisement on its website created by a third party, Plaintiff’s entire complaint against

Google must be dismissed.

5

By Seeking to Hold Google Liable Based on Its Advertising Terms,
Plaintiff’s Negligence and Breach of Contract Claims Are Also
Barred By Section 230(c)(2)(A).

Although Plaintiff’s entire Complaint is properly dismissed under Section 230(c)(1),

6

Section 230(c)(2)(A) provides a separate basis for immunity against Plaintiff’s negligence and

7

breach of contract claims. Plaintiff contends that Google’s Advertising Terms and Content Policy

8

“expressed an intent to protect Class members,” creating a duty to protect them from websites

9

that did not comply with the policy and that she was injured when Google failed to fully enforce

10

its terms. ¶ 67-68. Plaintiff further alleges that Google’s failure to remove advertising that did

11

not comply with its Content Policy was a contractual breach of the Advertising Terms. ¶ 62-64.

12

These claims are barred by Section 230(c)(2)(A).

13

Congress enacted Section 230 in part “to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or

14

obscene material” by eliminating liability based on internet service providers’ voluntary efforts to

15

restrict the posting of objectionable material. Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1122. To this end, Section

16

230(c)(2)(A) creates immunity for “any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to

17

or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be . . . otherwise objectionable.”

18

Nearly all of the websites at issue in Section 230 jurisprudence involve express policies

19

and user agreements that were intended to prohibit the purportedly wrongful conduct. No court

20

has found that website policies and user terms create more liability or narrow the scope of Section

21

230. See, e.g., Universal Communication Systems v. Lycos, 478 F.3d 413, 415 (1st Cir. 2007)

22

(“[U]sers are required to agree to a ‘Subscriber Agreement,’ which, inter alia, requires users to

23

comply with federal and state securities laws.”); Carafano, 339 F.3d at 1121 (“Matchmaker

24

policies prohibit members from posting last names, addresses, phone numbers or e-mail addresses

25

within a profile. Matchmaker reviews photos for impropriety before posting them but does not

26

review the profiles themselves, relying instead upon participants to adhere to the service

27

guidelines.”).

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS

1

Google’s Advertising Terms and Content Policy are precisely the type of “good faith”

2

effort to limit objectionable material that Congress sought to immunize through Section 230.

3

Specifically, Plaintiff contends that through its Advertising Terms and Content Policy, Google set

4

up a procedure for “disallowing advertisements for mobile subscription services that link to non-

5

compliant websites.” ¶ 19. The crux of Plaintiff’s claims is that Google failed to remove every

6

“non-compliant website,” and that as a result she was exposed to a misleading MSSP website. ¶¶

7

24-26. This is a transparent attempt to hold Google liable for an “action voluntarily taken in good

8

faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be . . .

9

otherwise objectionable.” See 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2).

B.

Even in the Absence of Section 230, Plaintiff Has Failed to Plead Any Viable
Claim.
1.

Plaintiff Fails To Plead A Violation Of California Business &
Professions Code Section 17200.

Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim alleges, improbably, that Google engaged in “money

14

laundering” as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) by knowingly accepting funds derived from a

15

“specified unlawful act.” Plaintiff claims that the funds the MSSPs paid to Google for its

16

advertising services were derived from a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

17

(“CFAA”), allegedly a “specified unlawful act” for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a). Because

18

Plaintiff’s allegations do not, and cannot, state a claim that the MSSPs violated the CFAA as an

19

initial matter and because, in any event, Google could not have had the requisite knowledge under

20

18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) that such funds were derived from an allegedly unlawful activity, Plaintiff

21

has failed to state a claim for violation of Section 17200.

22
23
24

a.

The MSSPs Did Not Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act.

To establish that the MSSP revenue paid to Google for advertising services was derived

25

from a “specified unlawful act” for purposes of Section 1957, Plaintiff alleges the MSSPs

26

violated 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4) or 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(B) of the CFAA by charging her for

27
28
- 12 -

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

mobile content to which she did not subscribe.3 ¶ 53. The MSSPs’ charges, no matter how

2

fraudulent they are alleged to be, are not within the scope of the CFAA, and Plaintiff’s allegations

3

are insufficient to state a claim that the MSSPs violated the CFAA as a matter of law.

4

Congress enacted the CFAA to punish destructive computer hacking and theft of

5

information stored on computers. See Shamrock Foods Co. v. Gast, 535 F. Supp. 2d 962, 965-

6

66 (D. Ariz. 2008) (“The general purpose of the CFAA ‘was to create a cause of action against

7

computer hackers (e.g., electronic trespassers).’”); In re DoubleClick Inc. Privacy Litigation, 154

8

F. Supp. 2d 497, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Courts have recognized that “the legislative history

9

supports a narrow view of the CFAA.” Shamrock Foods Co., 535 F. Supp. 2d at 966. Because

10

the goal of the CFAA is to punish hackers and trespassers who cause injury to others by

11

infiltrating their computers, the CFAA requires both a trespass of a computer and loss, damage,

12

or fraud resulting from the unauthorized access. American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rickman, 554

13

F. Supp. 2d 766, 770 -771 (N. D. Ohio 2008). The two provisions of the CFAA upon which

14

Plaintiff relies, Section 1030(a)(4) and Section 1030(a)(5)(B), both expressly apply only where

15

the defendant has (1) accessed a protected computer without authorization, and (2) perpetuated a

16

fraud or caused damage by means of that access.4

17
18

The scheme of the CFAA is clear: it is not enough to merely access computers; the
defendant must actively cause harm and obtain something of value by way of the access. United

19
20
21
22

3 The fraud Plaintiff alleges is the “intent to defraud [subscribers] out of the services’

unauthorized charges.” ¶ 11. Similarly, the alleged “damage” is based on the allegation that “[i]f
the Fraudulent Mobile Subscription Services’ unauthorized charges are not paid eventually, the
cellular carriers will discontinue all services (including cellular service)” and therefore “impair
the availability of Class members’ access to and communication with their cellular service.” ¶ 51.
4

23
24
25
26
27

Section 1030(a)(4) applies only where an individual “knowingly and with intent to defraud,
accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means
of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value.” 18 U.S.C. §
1030(a)(4) (emphasis added). Similarly, Section 1030(a)(5)(B) only applies if a person
“intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such
conduct, recklessly causes damage.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(B) (emphasis added). “Damage” is
defined as “any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or
information, that (A) causes loss aggregating at least $5,000 in value during any 1-year period to
one or more individuals.” 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8). These claims are not satisfied in the absence
of loss or damage resulting directly from the unlawful access.

States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069 (1st Cir. 1997) (reversing conviction under CFAA because,

2

although defendant’s use of IRS computer to browse confidential taxpayer information

3

“unquestionably exceeded authorized access to a Federal interest computer,” “he did not obtain

4

‘anything of value’”). The damage must be actually related to “the context of computer hacking.”

5

American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rickman, 554 F. Supp. 2d 766, 770-71 (N.D. Ohio 2008)

6

(holding that damage caused by accessing employer’s information and sharing it with employer’s

7

competitor was not damage for purposes of the CFAA because damage related to misuse of

8

information rather than misuse of the computer).

9

Plaintiff does not claim that she was damaged, harmed, or defrauded by the MSSPs’

10

alleged access to her cell phone. Rather, she alleges she was injured because the MSSPs charged

11

for that access. ¶¶ 51-52. Accordingly, there is no nexus between the alleged fraud and damage,

12

on the one hand, and the alleged access to Plaintiff’s cell phone, on the other. Although these

13

charges are a result of a service that includes sending text messages to a cell phone, it cannot be

14

said that the fraud arises from the allegedly unauthorized access to Plaintiff’s cell phone.

15

b.

16
17

Google Did Not Knowingly Engage in a Monetary Transaction
Involving Criminally Derived Property.

Even assuming arguendo that the MSSPs did violate the CFAA, Plaintiff’s Section 17200

18

claim cannot succeed unless Google itself performed an unlawful act. Although Plaintiff claims

19

Google engaged in “money laundering” as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a), there is no set of

20

facts by which Google could have violated § 1957(a).

21

Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) requires actual knowledge “that a transaction involved

22

criminal property” and that “the property was derived from a specified unlawful activity.” United

23

States v. Yagman, 502 F. Supp. 2d 1084 (C.D. Cal. 2007). Recognizing the possibility for abuse

24

of Section 1957, the Ninth Circuit construes the statute narrowly, holding that “Section 1957 was

25

enacted as a tool in the war against drugs. . . . Such a powerful instrument of criminal justice

26

should not be expanded by judicial invention or ingenuity.” Rutgard v. United States, 116 F.3d

1270, 1292 (9th Cir. 1996).

28

1

To violate Section 1957, the transferred funds must be traceable directly to the underlying

2

crime. Rutgard, 116 F.3d at 1292-93 (overturning Section 1957 conviction on grounds that

3

defendant’s bank account contained some lawfully obtained money as well as criminally derived

4

money and the government failed to trace the withdrawal to the unlawful funds); Yagman, 502 F.

5

Supp. 2d at 1087-1093 (overturning convictions for failure to adequately trace funds in

6

commingled account). There is no Section 1957 violation where, for example, both lawful and

7

unlawfully obtained funds are commingled in an account and payment could have been with

8

either the lawful or unlawfully obtained monies. Rutgard, 116 F.3d at 1292-93. Moreover, the

9

defendant must actually know that the property represents criminally derived property. See

10

United States v. Stein, 37 F.3d 1407, 1410 (9th Cir. 1994) (reversing conviction for insufficient

11

knowledge instruction to jury), disapproved on other grounds by Roy v. Gomez, 81 F.3d 863, 866

12

& n.3 (9th Cir. 1996) (en banc).

13

Plaintiff has not pled any facts by which Google could reasonably have possessed the

14

requisite knowledge that the payments from the MSSPs constituted property derived from a

15

statutorily proscribed act as alleged by Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s unfounded and overblown claim that

16

“all or substantially all” of revenue of the MSSPs who failed to abide by Google’s Content Policy

17

was criminally derived is insufficient to establish that Google could have known that the

18

particular funds it received in payment for advertising space were criminally derived.5

Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim suffers from additional fatal flaws. Plaintiff can not establish
that she is entitled to any restitution from Google under Section 17203. Restitution is the
exclusive monetary remedy available to private plaintiffs under Section 17200 and “is limited to
the return of property or funds in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest (or is claiming
through someone with an ownership interest).” Madrid v. Perot Systems Corp., 130 Cal. App. 4th
440, 453 (2005). Because Plaintiff alleges that she paid the MSSPs, not Google, and because she
does not contend that she had any ownership interest in funds paid to Google, she can not
establish any entitlement to restitution from Google. See id; Clayworth v. Pfizer, Inc., 83 Cal.
Rptr. 3d 45, 70 (2008). Plaintiff’s inability to assert restitution as a remedy against Google and
her failure to allege that Google caused any injury deprives her of standing to assert a Section
17200 claim against Google is an independent basis upon which to dismiss this action. Cal. Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17204 (a private person has standing to assert a Section 17200 claim only if he or
she (1) “has suffered injury in fact,” and (2) “has lost money or property as a result of such unfair
competition”); see Laster v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 407 F. Supp. 2d 1181, 1994 (S.D. Cal. 2005);

2.

Plaintiff Fails To State A Claim For Breach Of Contract.

Plaintiff claims that Google requires its AdWords customers to sign a set of Advertising

2
3

Terms before they are permitted to advertise through Google. Plaintiff alleges that, among other

4

provisions, these Advertising Terms require customers to abide by Google’s policies (including

5

its AdWords Content Policy), which allegedly obligate MSSP advertisers to include certain

6

information (such as mobile subscription pricing and cancellation procedures) on their websites.

7

¶¶ 21-22 and Ex. A. Plaintiff claims that by failing to disallow advertisements that did not

8

include the required information, Google somehow breached a promise to which Plaintiff was the

9

intended beneficiary. ¶ 67. Under California law, however, Plaintiff cannot recover against

10

Google for breach of contract unless (1) Google actually made a promise to disallow

11

advertisements that were not in compliance with its Content Policy, and (2) Plaintiff is a third

12

party beneficiary of that promise – i.e., that the promisee of Google’s alleged promise (the MSSP

13

Advertisers) intended to benefit Plaintiff.6 Souza v. Westlands Water District, 135 Cal. App. 4th

14

879 (2006). Plaintiff has not, and cannot, allege the requisite facts for either prong and her breach

15

of contract claim should be dismissed. See id.

16

a.

Google Made No Promise to Enforce its Advertising Terms.

17

As an initial matter, Google cannot be liable for a promise it did not make. See Souza,

18

135 Cal. App. at 892 (“If a contract is to be a basis of liability for the district’s violation of [its

19

Terms and Conditions] . . . it must be a contract in which the district promises to abide by [these

20

terms].”) (emphasis added). Google’s Advertising Terms were a promise by Google’s advertising

21

customers to Google in exchange for participation in Google’s advertising service. Plaintiff has

22

not alleged and cannot point to any provision in Google’s Advertising Terms by which Google

23

promised to enforce the Advertising Terms or otherwise remove noncompliant advertisements.
In dismissing allegations virtually indistinguishable from Plaintiff’s, the California Court

24
25

inferring (and Plaintiff does not allege) that Google made a promise to its advertising customers

2

that it would enforce the Advertising Terms against them; any such promise would have been

3

made to Google’s advertisers and would have been to their detriment. See id. at 892. Google’s

4

Advertising Terms commit only its AdWords customers to comply with their terms; they do not

5

confer any rights upon Plaintiff. See also Green, 318 F.3d at 472 (holding “that Green failed to

6

state a claim for breach of contract because . . . by their terms, the Member Agreement and

7

Community Guidelines were not intended to confer any rights on Green and AOL did not promise

8

to protect Green from the acts of other subscribers”). Because Google made no promise to

9

enforce its Advertising Terms, Plaintiff’s claims against Google for its failure to enforce its those

10

terms must be dismissed.

11

b.

12
13

Plaintiff is Not an Intended Third Party Beneficiary of the
Advertising Terms.

In any event, as a non-party to the Advertising Terms, Plaintiff may assert a claim for

14

breach of contract only if she is an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement. Souza, 135

15

Cal. App. 4th 879; Martinez v. Socoma Companies, 11 Cal. 3d 394, 406 (1974). Whether a party

16

is a third party beneficiary can be determined as a matter of law. Souza, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 891.

17

For Plaintiff to be an intended third party beneficiary of the Advertising Terms as an

18

initial matter, the Advertising Terms would have to reflect, on their face, an intent to benefit

19

Plaintiff. Martinez, 11 Cal. 3d at 406. “To attain standing as a third party beneficiary of a

20

contract, a person must show clearly that when the parties executed their agreement they intended

21

its execution to confer real benefits on that person.” Highfields Capital Management, L.P. v.

22

Doe, 385 F. Supp. 2d 969, 980 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (holding that internet users are not third party

23

beneficiaries of Yahoo! Service agreement because there “is nothing in the language of the

24

contract that even remotely suggests such intention”) (emphasis in original). Plaintiff has not

25

alleged that the Advertising Terms reflect any intent to benefit her and, in fact, expressly alleges

26

that the terms were intended to benefit Google. ¶ 30-32.

27
28

More significantly, a third party is not an intended beneficiary of an agreement unless the
promisee intends the agreement to benefit the third party. Id. at 893. (“The point of the third- 17 -

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

party beneficiary doctrine is to allow a third party to enforce, against a promisor, rights running to

2

the third party for which the promisee bargained.”). The intent of the promisor “is not at issue.”

3

Id. Assuming arguendo that Google did in fact promise to enforce its Advertising Terms, Google

4

would be the promisor of the agreement and the allegedly fraudulent MSSP would be the

5

promisee. Consequently, for Plaintiff to be an intended third party beneficiary, the Advertising

6

Terms would have to reflect an intent by the allegedly fraudulent MSSP to benefit Plaintiff. As

7

the Souza Court recognized, such a result is absurd and Plaintiff cannot be an intended

8

beneficiary as a matter of law. Id. at 893. Accordingly, her breach of contract claim must be

9

dismissed.

10
11

3.

Plaintiff’s Negligence Claim Is Barred As A Matter Of Law.

A long line of California cases establishes that publishers, including publishers of

12

advertisements, have no independent duty to police content for accuracy. See, e.g., Walters v.

13

Seventeen Magazine, 195 Cal. App. 3d 1119, 1122 (3d Dist. 1987) (holding that magazine could

14

not be held liable for teen’s injury from a product advertised in the magazine); see also

15

McCulloch v. Ford Dealers Advertising Ass’n, 234 Cal. App. 3d 1385 (Cal. App. 1991) (holding

16

that corporation had no duty to participants in fraudulent contest despite having affixed its logo to

17

the materials promoting the contest). Accordingly, absent a showing of some special duty,

18

Plaintiff may not assert a claim of negligence against Google.

19

Plaintiff alleges that Google’s Advertising Terms caused it voluntarily to assume a duty of

20

care to Google’s users. ¶ 67. Plaintiff claims that Google’s Content Policy required its MSSP

21

advertisers to “prominently display” certain information on their websites, including

22

identification of the service as a subscription, price of the service, billing interval, and

23

cancellation information. ¶ 22. Plaintiff alleges that “these statements in its Content Policy

24

amount to public representations by Google of the accuracy and clarity of pricing, subscription,

25

and cancellation information that Google users can expect to find on third-party websites linked

26

to AdWords advertisements.” ¶ 23.

27
28

Under California law, however, Google can not be found to have assumed a duty to
Plaintiff unless (1) the Advertising Terms themselves increased the risk of harm or (2) Plaintiff
- 18 -

1

actually relied upon the Advertising Terms. Paz v. State of California, 22 Cal. 4th 550, 560

2

(2000). “A defendant’s undertaking of protective services increases the risk of harm if, as a result

3

of his actions, the risk of harm is greater than if he had done nothing at all.” McIntosh v. U.S.,

4

Civ. No. 05-373 (BTM), 2008 WL 4492592, *8 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2008).

5

Plaintiff has not alleged that she relied on—or even read—Google’s Advertising Terms

6

and Content Policy. In any event it would be absurd to suggest that she relied on the Content

7

Policy to her detriment: had Plaintiff read Google’s Content Policy, the conspicuous absence of

8

the required information about pricing, subscription, and cancellation on the MSSP website

9

would have alerted her to the fact that the website was out of compliance with the Content Policy.

10

Plaintiff also fails to allege that the Advertising Terms somehow increased her risk of

11

injury. Had Google “done nothing at all,” the allegedly misleading MSSP websites would have

12

been equally, if not more, misleading. Plaintiff’s risk of harm from the MSSP advertisements

13

was therefore the same, if not less, than it would have been in the absence of Google’s

14

Advertising Terms.

15
16
17

4.

Plaintiff’s Claim For Aiding And Abetting Various Violations Also
Fails.

To state a claim for aiding and abetting, Plaintiff must allege that the aider and abetter (1)

18

“knows that the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty,” and (2) “gives substantial

19

assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.” Orser v. Vierra, 252 Cal. App.

20

2d 660, 666 (Cal. App. 1967). Courts emphasize that the substantial assistance requirement is

21

necessary to protect defendants with only a “slight” or tenuous relationship to the alleged

22

wrongdoing. Id. at 669. To ascertain whether a defendant has provided substantial assistance,

23

courts look at “the nature of the act encouraged, the amount of assistance given by the defendant,

24

his presence or absence at the time of the tort, his relation to the other and his state of mind.” Id.

25

Plaintiff alleges that, by simply allowing MSSPs to advertise on its website, Google aided

26

and abetted the MSSP’s violation of Section 17200, violation of the CFAA, and trespass to

27

chattels. ¶¶ 73-76. Plaintiff has failed, as an initial matter, to allege that Google provided

28

“substantial assistance,” as required to state a claim for aiding and abetting. Moreover, Plaintiff’s
- 19 -

GOOGLE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
C 08-02738 (JF)

1

sole allegation against Google is that Google provided the MSSPs the opportunity to advertise.

2

Such a tenuous relationship to the alleged wrongdoing cannot amount to the substantial assistance

3

required to hold Google liable for the MSSP’s activities. Id. at 669 (“The assistance of or

4

participation by the defendant may be so slight that he is not liable for the act of the other.”).7

5

V.

6

CONCLUSION
This case should be dismissed without leave to amend. Though leave to amend is

7

generally given freely, “permission to amend may be withheld if the plaintiff does not have at

8

least colorable grounds for relief, or if she is guilty of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or

9

if permission to amend would unduly prejudice the opposing party.” Doe ex. rel. Doe v. School

10

Dist. of City of Norfolk, 340 F.3d 605, 616 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

11

Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007) (a complaint must recite allegations sufficient “to raise a

12

right to relief above the speculative level” and “contain something more than a statement of facts

13

that merely creates a suspicion of a legally cognizable right of action.”). Here, no amendments

14

are possible to cure Plaintiff’s inability to plead a colorable ground for relief against Google for

15

conduct that is attributable to others.

In any event, as discussed previously, the MSSPs have not violated the CFAA as a matter of
law. See Section III.B.1.a. Even if the transmission of content to the Plaintiff’s cell phone could
constitute trespass of a chattel, the harm Plaintiff alleges—charges for mobile content services
she did not subscribe to—are unrelated to any “trespass” of her cell phone, and the relationship
between the MSSP advertisements and the MSSP’s “trespass” is so tenuous as to be
unforeseeable. See Orser, 252 Cal. App. 2d at 669.
