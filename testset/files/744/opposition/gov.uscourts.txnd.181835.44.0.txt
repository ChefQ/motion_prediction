MARK CUBAN’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION’S RULE 54(d)(2)(C) MOTION
Mark Cuban responds to Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Rule
54(d)(2)(C) motion for leave to file an opposition to Mr. Cuban’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
and Expenses (the “Fees Motion”). Although the SEC did not confer with Mr. Cuban’s counsel
about its motion for leave to file an opposition or its motion for an extension of the standard
briefing schedule under Local Rule 7.1, Mr. Cuban does not oppose an extension of the schedule
as requested by the SEC, provided that Mr. Cuban receives a similar extension (13 days) to file
his reply in support of the Fees Motion. Accordingly, Mr. Cuban respectfully suggests that the
Court set the following briefing schedule: (1) the SEC’s opposition shall be due September 30;
and (2) Mr. Cuban’s reply shall be due October 28.
