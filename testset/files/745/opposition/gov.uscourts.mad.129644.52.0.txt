Case 1:10-cv-11021-DJC Document 52 Filed 04/26/13 Page 1 of 3

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
SUSAN A. SHAW,
Plaintiff,
v.
Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-11021-DJC
BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., successor by
merger to BAC HOME LOANS SERVICING,
L.P.
Defendant.

DEFENDANT BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.’S OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR MEMORANDUM OF LIS PENDENS
Defendant Bank America, N.A. (“BANA”) hereby submits this Opposition to Plaintiff
Susan A. Shaw (“Plaintiff”)’s Motion for Memorandum of Lis Pendens. The Court should deny
Plaintiff’s motion because Plaintiff has failed to commence this proceeding by means of a
verified complaint that names as defendants all owners of record for the property located at 12
Jarvis Lane, North Attleboro, Bristol County, Massachusetts 02760 (“the Property”).
The Massachusetts Lis Pendens Statute, G.L. c. 184 § 15(b), provides in relevant part:
Any party seeking a memorandum of lis pendens under this section shall
commence the underlying proceeding by means of a verified complaint or other
complaint as is required under the rules of court to include a certification by the
claimant made under the penalties of perjury that the complainant has read the
complaint, that the facts stated therein are true and that no material facts have
been omitted therefrom. The complaint shall name as defendants all owners of
record and any party in occupation under a written lease.
On March 21, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Memorandum of Lis Pendens, along with
a Second Amended Verified Complaint (“Second Amended Complaint” or “Sec. Am. Compl.”).
Docket Entries # 43 – 44. The Second Amended Complaint asserts claims against BANA for:

LIBA/2393306.1

Case 1:10-cv-11021-DJC Document 52 Filed 04/26/13 Page 2 of 3

violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §1692k (“FDCPA”) (Count I),
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count II), a violation of G.L. c.
93A based on predatory lending (Count III), and Wrongful Foreclosure (Count IV).1 However,
despite the document’s title, Plaintiff did not verify this complaint as required by the statute, “to
include a certification by the claimant made under the penalties of perjury that the complainant
has read the complaint, that the facts stated herein are true and that no material facts have been
omitted thereform.” See Sec. Am. Compl. (Docket Entry #44).
Furthermore, Plaintiff has not named as defendants in this action “all owners of record”
of the Property. See G.L. c. 184 § 15(b); Sec. Am. Compl. (Docket Entry #44). In fact, the
Second Amended Complaint names only BANA, as successor in liability to BAC Home Loans
Servicing, L.P., as a defendant. As Plaintiff herself alleges in her Second Amended Complaint,
the Property was purchased by Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) at a
foreclosure auction that took place on or around June 21, 2011. Sec. Am. Compl. ¶ 12.
However, Fannie Mae is not named as a defendant in the action, as is required by G.L. c. 184 §
15(b).
Plaintiff has failed to comply with the procedural prerequisites set forth in G.L. c. 184 §
15(b), and her Motion for Memorandum of Lis Pendens should therefore be denied.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons cited above, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court deny
Plaintiff’s Motion for Memorandum of Lis Pendens.

1

In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has mislabeled her wrongful foreclosure claim as “Count VI.”
