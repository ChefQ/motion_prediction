and SONAR PRODUCTS, INC., corporations,

BILLOCH individuals,
Defendants.

DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO SEAL OR REDACT
CONSENT DECREE OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION
Defendants Stratus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Stratus”) and Sonar

Products, Inc.

(“Sonar”), corporations, and Alberto Hoyo and Juan Carlos Billoch, individuals (hereinafter,
collectively, “Defendants”), pursuant to Local Rule 5.4 request that the Consent Decree of
Permanent Injunction filed by Plaintiff at D.E. 4-1 and any copy of the Consent Decree that
may in the future be entered by the Court be filed under seal or redacted.
BACKGROUND
This case concerns two related corporations: Sonar, a drug manufacturing company
based in New Jersey; and Stratus, a drug distribution center based in Miami, Florida. Stratus
owns 80% of the stock in Sonar. Hoyo and Billoch are shareholders of Stratus.
Defendants’ problems with the FDA began several years ago when Sonar was under the
operational control of its former president, Mark Newman. During this time, Stratus, Hoyo and
Billoch were not actively involved in Sonar’s management. Mr. Newman did not inform them

Case 1:17-cv-21659-KMW Document 11 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/25/2017 Page 2 of 8

of customer complaints or problems that were occurring at Sonar. Eventually, the FDA’s
inspections at Sonar revealed some critical observations that Sonar allegedly was not operating
in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”). Because Sonar was the
sole manufacturer of products being distributed by Stratus, the problems with the products
manufactured a Sonar trickled down to Stratus.
Despite support from Stratus, Hoyo and Billoch, Mr. Newman failed to address and
correct the cGMP issues at Sonar to the satisfaction of the FDA in a timely manner. Eventually,
Sonar fired Newman and replaced him with a new president. Defendants then invested
hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovating the manufacturing plant at Sonar. However, it
was too late. The FDA requested that the parties enter into a Consent Decree to resolve the
forthcoming enforcement action.
The Consent Decree the parties eventually signed was discussed and negotiated under
the presumption that both corporate Defendants would stay in business. While it includes some
corrective actions that must be taken by Stratus to avoid future cGMP issues, it is mostly
focused on preventing the manufacture and distribution of unapproved drugs that were
manufactured at Sonar and the manufacture of products in a facility that had several alleged
critical cGMP issues.
Pursuant to the parties’ agreement, Sonar effectively ceased all manufacturing
operations on April 28, 2017. With Sonar’s closure, the gravamen of issues addressed by the
Consent Decree have been resolved, leaving many portions of the Consent Decree inapplicable.
For example, with Sonar no longer manufacturing products, Stratus does not have a stream of
unapproved products to distribute. In addition, as a distribution center, the cGMP issues Stratus
had were simple reporting issues related to drugs manufactured by Sonar. Accordingly, the

FDA’s goals in the instant enforcement action have been accomplished.
ARGUMENT
A.

Legal Standard for Sealing or Redacting Court Documents

Courts have long recognized a public right of access to many documents filed before
them. See In re Alexander Grant & Co. Litig., 820 F.2d 352, 355 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam).
However, the public’s right of access to records in civil proceedings is not absolute. See
Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263 F.3d 1304, 1311 (“right to inspect and
copy [judicial records] is not absolute”) (citing Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589,
597 (1978)). “Courts have refused to permit their files to serve as reservoirs of libelous
statements for press consumption, or as sources of business information that might harm a
litigant's competitive standing.” Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598. The decision to allow or restrict access
to judicial records is left to the sound discretion of the court. F.T.C. v. AbbVie Prods LLC, 713
F.3d 54, 61 (11th Cir. 2013); Nixon, 435 U.S. at 599.
“The test for whether a judicial record can be withheld from the public is a balancing
test that weighs the competing interests of the parties to determine whether there is good cause
to deny the public the right to access the document.” AbbVie Prod. LLC, 713 F.3d at 62. The
common law right of access to documents involved in litigation may be overcome by a showing
of good cause, which requires “balanc[ing] the asserted right of access against the other party’s
interest in keeping the information confidential.” Romero v. Drummond Co., Inc., 480 F.3d
1234, 1245 (11th Cir 2007); Chicago Tribune v. Bridgestone/Firestone, 263 F.3d 1304, 1309
(11th Cir.2001). “[W]hether good cause exists ... is ... decided by the nature and character of the
information in question.” Id. at 1315.

In balancing the public interest in accessing court documents against a party’s interest in
keeping the information confidential, courts consider, among other factors, whether allowing
access would impair court functions or harm legitimate privacy interests, the degree of and
likelihood of injury if made public, the reliability of the information, whether there will be an
opportunity to respond to the information, whether the information concerns public officials or
public concerns, and the availability of a less onerous alternative to sealing the documents.
Romero v. Drummond Co., Inc., supra.
B.

Disclosure of the Consent Decree will Cause Substantial Irreparable Harm
to Stratus, Outweighing the Public’s Need for Access to the Terms of the
Consent Decree.

The FDA’s last inspection at Sonar was in 2015. All of the products manufactured by
Sonar during the times it was cited by the FDA are now expired, having shelf-lives of two years
or less. In addition, Sonar is no longer manufacturing any products. Therefore, there is no risk of
harm to the public from products manufactured under the alleged cGMP violations.
By its explicit terms, the Consent Decree requires that its contents be published to all
“associated parties,” which is broadly defined to include all employees, officers, subsidiaries and
affiliates of Defendants. Moreover, all clients of Sonar have already been advised that Sonar has
stopped manufacturing not only unapproved drugs but any other products whatsoever. Similarly,
Stratus’ clients have been advised that it will no longer distribute the products at issue.
Accordingly, there is no further public need to know about the reasons for the shutdown of Sonar
and the cessation of manufacture of drugs which Plaintiff deems to be illegal, even though other
manufacturers are continuing to produce, market and distribute them.
The cGMP violations alleged to have occurred at Stratus concerned failure to report
product complaint to Sonar. Those issues were correct years ago. Notwithstanding, to avoid

4
111766788.1

Case 1:17-cv-21659-KMW Document 11 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/25/2017 Page 5 of 8

costly litigation, Stratus agreed to the terms of the Consent Decree. However, its entry and public
disclosure will have a severely negative impact on the public’s perception of Stratus. Stratus
anticipates that it will likely lose a substantial number of customers when they learn that it is
under a Consent Decree. Its competitors will also likely use the Consent Decree to persuade
Stratus’ customers to take their business elsewhere. Such a mass exodus of its customers will
drive Stratus out of business. It is not in the public’s interest to put a company list Stratus out of
business. If Stratus goes out of business, the price of drugs it distributes will likely skyrocket.
Already the prices of some of the products it has stopped distributed due to this action have
increased significantly, affecting such customers as the Veteran’s Administration.
To put Stratus or its principals in public view as responsible for past conduct of a former
president (Mark Newman) who has been terminated and for cGMP violations of a company
which has been shut down gives the appearance of personal liability for corporate negligence of
a company with which Stratus no longer has any involvement whatsoever. Stratus is entitled to
move past this enforcement action, which primarily dealt with its subsidiary, in a manner that
allows it to remain a viable going-concern.
C.

Proposed Duration of the Seal is Permanent.

Defendants propose that the duration of the seal or redactions be permanent or until such
time as the Consent Decree is vacated.
CONCLUSION
There is good cause for sealing the Consent Decree or, at a minimum, redacting the
names of Stratus and the individual Defendants to avoid the substantial and irreparable business
harm these parties would suffer if the Consent Decree remains public. The financial viability of
Stratus and maintaining individuals’ reputations in the industry outweigh the need for public
access to the terms of the Consent Decree, in light of the complete shut-down of Sonar, which

was the real target of this enforcement action.
