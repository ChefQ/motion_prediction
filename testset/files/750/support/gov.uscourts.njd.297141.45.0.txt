PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Defendant Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor submits this Memorandum of Law
in support of its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). By statutory mandate, the mission of the Commission is to
investigate, deter, combat and remedy criminal activity and influence in the Port of New York-New
Jersey, and to ensure fair hiring and employment practices so that the Port and region can grow and
prosper. Since the enactment of the Waterfront Commission Act in 1953, Plaintiffs – disgruntled by
its limiting effect on their perceived absolute collective bargaining rights to engage in conduct that
promotes discriminatory hiring practices – have challenged virtually every attempt by the
Commission to ensure that Plaintiffs abide by the spirit and the letter of the Act.
Recently, to combat continued discriminatory practices, the Commission amended its Rules
and Regulations to require employers in the industry to submit a certification that the persons they
select for hiring have been hired in a fair and non-discriminatory basis in accordance with state and
federal equal employment opportunity laws. In response, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, alleging that
the Commission has “gone off the rails,” and is improperly interfering with their collective
bargaining process. Not only are they challenging the Commission’s recent amendment, but they
are seeking to completely eradicate a critical provision of the Act, “Section 5-p,” which empowers
the Commission to safeguard fair and nondiscriminatory hiring in the Port. Plaintiffs are also
challenging the Commission’s attempts to ensure that the hiring plan they promulgated and
implemented is being fairly administered.
As argued below, the Amended Complaint is just another attempt by Plaintiffs to prevent the
Commission from fulfilling its mandate to ensure the fair hiring of a diverse workforce in the Port.
For the reasons set forth below, the Amended Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 9 of 49 PageID: 1124

STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY1
I. THE PARTIES
Defendant Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor (“Commission” or “Defendant”) is
a bi-state corporate and politic entity created by compact between the states of New York and New
Jersey in 1953. (N.J. STAT. ANN. § 32:23-1; N.Y. UNCONSOLIDATED LAWS § 9801; Complaint ¶ 9,
attached to the Affidavit of Phoebe S. Sorial, Esq.[“SORIAL AFFIDAVIT”], as Exhibit A)) “The
Compact creates the Waterfront Commission as an agency of both states, with the authority to
license or register workers, and, for good cause, to refuse licenses or registrations, and to regulate
labor and hiring practices on the waterfront.” In Re Application of Waterfront Commission, 32 N.J.
323 (1960). The Commission is a fully recognized law enforcement agency, vested with licensing,
regulatory and investigative powers. (Id. at § 32:23-10; Id. at § 9811)
1

In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a court may consider the
allegations of the complaint, as well as documents attached to or specifically referenced in the
complaint, and matters of public record. Pittsburgh v. W. Penn Power Co., 147 F3d 256, 259 (3d
Cir. 1998); see also 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure:
Civil 3d § 1357 (3d ed. 2007); see also Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus. Inc.,
998 F.2d 1192, 1196–97 (3d Cir. 1993)(“a court may consider an undisputedly authentic document
that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff’s claims are based on
the document.”). “Plaintiffs cannot prevent a court from looking at the texts of documents on which
its claim is based by failing to attach or explicitly cite them.” In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec.
Litig. 114 F. 3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997).
Matters of public record have been understood to include “copies of pleadings and other
materials filed in other courts.” Caldwell Trucking PRP Group v. Spaulding Composites Co., 890 F.
Supp. 1247, 1252 (D.N.J. 1995); see also Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. L’Oreal USA, Inc., 458
F. 3d 244, 256 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding that consideration of pleadings from other court
proceedings did not require the district court to convert a motion to dismiss into one for summary
judgment because, “to resolve a 12(b)(6) motion, a court may properly look at public records,
including judicial proceedings, in addition to the allegations in the complaint.”)(internal quotations
and alteration marks omitted).
In this motion, the facts are derived from (1) Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, (2)
undisputedly authentic documents specifically referenced in the Amended Complaint; (3) exhibits
attached to pleadings filed by Plaintiffs on December 11, 2013 in this litigation in support of their
Motion for Preliminary Injunction; and (4) public records of which the Court may take judicial
notice, including press releases, publicly available transcripts of public hearings, and copies of
pleadings filed in other courts.

comprise the “A” register, as discussed below. ILA Local 1814 represents maintenance and repair
workers employed by NYSA and MMMCA members on the New York side of the Port. (Compl.
¶8) It is a party to CBAs with NYSA and MMMCA pertaining to maintenance and repair workers,
and represents deep sea longshoremen covered by the NYSA-ILA CBA.
II. THE WATERFRONT COMMISSION ACT
A. Enactment
In 1953, the New York State Crime Commission issued a report detailing pervasive crime
and widespread corruption on the waterfront. (FOURTH REPORT OF THE NEW YORK STATE CRIME
COMMISSION, New York State Leg.Doc.No. 70)(1953)[“CRIME COMMISSION REPORT”]) The Report
described “skullduggeries on the waterfront [that] were largely due to the domination over
waterfront employment gained by the International Longshoremen’s Association, as then
conducted. Its employment practices easily led to corruption, and many of its officials participated
in dishonesties.” De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960).
3

In the wake of that report, the

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 11 of 49 PageID: 1126

legislatures of the states of New York and New Jersey, with the consent of Congress, created the
Commission by enacting the Waterfront Commission Compact.

(N.J.S.A. 32:23-1; N.Y.

UNCONSOL. 9801-9873) That Compact, along with the implementing provisions enacted by the two
legislatures, is known as the Waterfront Commission Act (hereinafter, “Act”). (Id. at §32:23-1 et
seq; Id. at §9801 et seq.)
As set forth in the Findings and Declarations of the Act, the legislatures found that:
[t]he conditions under which waterfront labor is employed with the Port of New
York district are depressing and degrading to such labor, resulting from the
lack of any systematic method of hiring, the lack of adequate information as
to the availability of employment, corrupt hiring practices and the fact that
persons conducting such hiring are frequently criminals and persons notoriously
lacking in moral character and integrity and neither responsive nor responsible to
the employers . . . that as a result waterfront laborers suffer from irregularity
of employment, fear and insecurity . . .and a loss of respect for the law; that not
only does there result a destruction of the dignity of an important segment of
American labor, but a direct encouragement of crime which imposes a levy of
greatly increased costs on food, fuel and other necessaries handled in and through
the Port of New York district.
(Id. at §32:23-2; Id. at §9802)(Emphasis added)
The legislatures deemed that the occupation of longshoremen and stevedores, among others,
are “affected with a public interest requiring their regulation and that such regulation shall be
deemed an exercise of the police power of the two States for the protection of public safety, welfare,
prosperity, health, peace and living conditions of the people of the two States.” (Id. at §32:23-5; Id.
at § 9805)
B. Regulation of Longshoremen and Stevedores
The Act required that all those longshoremen who loaded and unloaded cargo on and off
vessels in the Port (“deep sea longshoremen”) be hired through employment information centers
operated by the Commission. (Id. at §§32:23-52; Id. at §§9852-9853) The Commission was
required to maintain a list, known as the “longshoremen’s register,” of all individuals qualified to
work as longshoremen. (Id. at §32:23-7; Id. at §9827) No person was to work as a longshoreman
4

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 12 of 49 PageID: 1127

in the Port unless included in the longshoremen’s register. (Id.) The Act also delegated to the
Commission the power to issue licenses to stevedoring companies that wish to operate in the Port.
(Id. at §§32:23-19 to 32:23-23.1; Id. at §§9819-9823) A “stevedore” was originally defined as “a
contractor engaged by a carrier of freight by water to move waterborne freight on ships berthed at
piers, on piers, or at other waterfront terminals.” (N.J.S.A. 32:23-06; N.Y. UNCONSOL. 9806)
Stevedores who employ deep-sea longshoremen, as defined above, are known as “general
stevedores.” Bozzi v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15664 at
*6 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)
C. 1966 Legislation – Section 5-p and the Deep Sea Longshoremen’s Register
When the Act was first adopted, any individual who was qualified to become a
longshoreman was entitled to be registered by the Commission. Bozzi, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
15664 at *6. However, with the advent in the early 1960’s of a new method of transporting freight
by containers, the need for labor in the Port drastically reduced. Id. In 1964, in order to avoid
having the existing workforce bear the entire cost of containerization and the concomitant
elimination of jobs, a CBA was entered into between the NYSA and ILA. Id. According to the
terms of that agreement, employers were permitted to reduce the number of employees in exchange
for their promise that registered displaced longshoremen would receive a Guaranteed Annual
Income (GAI), whether or not there was work available.
In 1966, these developments led to the enactment of Section 5-p of the Act, referred to as the
“closed-register” statute.2 Bozzi, supra at *6. Under Section 5-p, the Commission is empowered to
close and open the register in order to “balance the longshoreman’s workforce with the demand for
2

In 1965, the ILA and NYSA sought legislation for a closed register which could only be opened
under their joint control. (MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT, NEW YORK STATE SENATE, reprinted in 1999
N.Y. Laws (McKinney) at 1842) This bill was vetoed by New York Governor Nelson A.
Rockefeller, since it gave control of the register to private parties and not to the Commission. Id.
5

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 13 of 49 PageID: 1128

waterfront labor.” When Section 5-p was first adopted, once the Commission determined that
additional longshoremen were needed, applications were required to be processed in the order that
they were filed (i.e., on a first-come first-served basis). In determining whether to open or close the
register, the Commission is required, inter alia:
[t]o encourage as far as practicable the regularization of the employment of
longshoremen . . .[t]o eliminate oppressive and evil hiring practices injurious to
waterfront labor and waterborne commerce in the Port of New York district
including, but not limited to, those oppressive and evil hiring practices that may
result from either a surplus or shortage of waterfront labor [and] . . .[t]o protect
the public interest in the Port of New York district.
(N.J.S.A. 32:23-114; N.Y. UNCONSOL. 9920)
D. 1969 Legislation – “A” Register
In 1969, as a result of the technological advances described above, the statutory definitions
of a stevedore and longshoreman were further expanded to include a new class of longshore
workers.3 Bozzi, supra at *5. These longshoremen do not load and unload ships, but perform
services incidental to the loading and unloading operations. (Id.) These longshoremen that are
registered by the Commission pursuant to the 1969 amendments to the Act are known as “1969
longshoremen” or “A registrants,” and are distinguished from “deep-sea longshoremen.” Id. “A”
registrants are not permitted to perform work involving the discharge or loading of general cargo
vessels, and are not eligible to receive the GAI payments described above. (Id.)
The amendments also expanded the definition of stevedore to include contractors that were
involved in the loading and unloading of containers, cargo storage, cargo repairing, coopering,
general maintenance, carpentry, mechanical and miscellaneous work.

Id.

These contractors

included in the 1969 amended definition of a stevedore are known as “1969 stevedores,” as
distinguished from the “general stevedores” defined earlier. Bozzi, supra at 5. The industry
3

The term “A” registrants is derived from the “A” prefix before the multi-digit number that appears
on licenses issued by the Commission to those registrants. Bozzi, supra at *5.
6

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 14 of 49 PageID: 1129

adapted to the 1969 legislation by creating separate workforces.

As set forth above, NYSA

members employ the deep-sea longshoremen and checkers/clerks, and MMMCA members employ
the “A” registrants.
E. 1982 Amendment to Section 5-p – Clarification of “A” Registrants
In the early 1980’s, the Commission proposed legislation that would clarify the status of “A”
registrants as they related to the closed register statute, and provide an exception for certain classes
of individuals to the existing statute. Bozzi, supra at *10. In the Commission’s Memorandum in
Support of the Bill, the background of the bill was presented, in relevant part, as follows:
[This] class of persons the Commission wishes to have as an exception to the “closed
Register” statute are persons who perform work incidental to the movement of
waterborne freight in the harbor, who are required to be registered by amendments to
the Act enacted in 1969, and who are not subject to the guaranteed annual income
provisions pertaining to traditional longshoremen which led to the enactment of the
“closed Register” statute. Since 1969, the Commission has administratively excluded
these persons from the “closed Register” statute since the reasons for the enactment
does not pertain to such registrants. In order to clarify the status of such registrants with
respect to the existing law, the Commission is now proposing that an exception be made
to them in the “closed Register” statute.
Id. The Commission added, “[t]he Commission also believes that those persons who have been and
are being added to the Register pursuant to the 1969 amendments to the Act should also be excluded
from the closed Register provisions.” Bozzi, supra at *11. Accordingly, Section 5-p was amended
to provide that, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may include
[“A” registrants] in the longshoremen’s register under such terms and conditions as the commission
may prescribe.” Today, this provision is set forth at Section 5-p(5)(b).
F. 1999 Amendment to Section 5-p – Certification by Employers that Selection
is Made in a Fair and Non-Discriminatory Basis
In the late 1990’s, the procedures described above pertaining to the opening of the deep-sea
longshoremen’s register became outdated as a result of the increased business in the Port,
significant changes to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between management
7

and labor, and attrition in the waterfront labor force. (MEMORANDUM

IN

SUPPORT, NEW YORK

STATE SENATE, reprinted in 1999 N.Y. Laws (McKinney) at 1843) The Commission determined
that changes needed to occur to then-existing provisions of Section 5-p, and initiated discussions
with representatives of management and labor to develop a more expeditious manner to meet the
demand for waterfront labor. Id. On April 28 and 29, 1998, the Commission held public hearings
to determine whether and in what manner Section 5-p should be amended. Id. Prior to the hearing
representatives of management and labor, government officials, individual dockworkers and other
interested parties were provided with a draft of the proposed amendments to Section 5-p, and were
invited to testify and present their views on the subject. Id.
The proposed amendment permitted controlled openings of the deep-sea register through the
use of an employer sponsorship procedure. Id. No longer were applications to be processed in the
order that they were received by the Commission but instead, contingent on the employer
sponsorship procedure. (Id.) Inasmuch as applications were no longer processed on a first-come,
first-served basis, the proposed amendment contained a provision that “the sponsoring employer
shall certify that the selection of the persons so sponsored was made in a fair and nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the requirements of the laws of the United States and the
states of New York and New Jersey dealing with equal employment opportunities.” (Id.)
Numerous witnesses from the Commission, ILA, NYSA, MMMCA and other interested
parties testified at the hearing. (Id.) There was a general consensus that the proposed amendatory
language to Section 5-p was the joint product of the Commission’s collaboration with the industry.

Indeed, James A. Capo, then president of the NYSA, testified, “[t]he legislation before us today as
8

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 16 of 49 PageID: 1131

[sic] a result of the hard work of this Commission, its staff, NYSA, its staff and its members, both
carriers and terminal operators, as well as the ILA, its officers and its hardworking, dedicated
members.” (Id. at Tr. 120:20 to 121:2)
At the hearing, the Commission presented the proposed amendatory language pertaining to
the certification required of employers and explained:
[t]he proposed amendment to Section 5-p, although it shifts the emphasis of
sponsorship from the Contract Board to each individual employer, still retained
that which the Contract Board has continued to provide to the Commission for the
past twenty years, that is, a certification that the selection of the sponsoring
persons was made in a fair and nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with the
laws of the United States and the states of New York and New Jersey dealing with
equal employment opportunities.
(Id. at Tr. 99:20-100:10) During the hearing, David J. Tolan, an NYSA director, was asked why he
considered the employer sponsorship method an improvement over the 5-p system that existed at
the time. (Id. at Tr. 179:9-17) He testified:
Well, I think this opportunity for the employers to have a role in the selection
process and the referral of personnel really, in effect, puts the onus back on the
employer to make the right selection, and to have the criteria. You can’t
complaint to anyone else, because they don’t have the right skills when they come
into the workforce. That’s why I believe it’s better.
(Id. at Tr. 179:18 to 180:4)

When asked how these individuals would be hired, Mr. Tolan

responded:
Well, what I would envision is that the employers will engage in the selection of
personnel that they’re going to refer to the Joint Committee, and that those
persons that they select are going to have to be able to demonstrate certain basic
skills and intelligence, and that they would have the right racial and sexual mix,
and that those person would be then referred over to the Joint Committee, and the
Joint Committee would ensure that the overall mix of employees, both from a
skill, intelligence level, physical attribute level and equal employment opportunity
requirement would be met before they come to the Commission for introduction
to the workforce.

sponsorship certification that is now at issue in this litigation. (MEMORANDUM
YORK STATE SENATE, reprinted in 1999 N.Y. Laws (McKinney) at 1843)

IN

SUPPORT, NEW

The certification

provision was specifically included, “to protect against possible discrimination.” Id. at 1841. The
Commission explained:
Any “opening” of the register will be controlled, and will not only be in full
accordance with the Commission’s mandate to balance the number of
longshorepersons with the demand for their services but will “protect the public
interest of the port of New York district.” . . . Throughout the agency’s history of
authorizing temporary registrations pursuant to its special and emergency the
Commission steadfastly made sure that all persons sponsored for temporary
registration were selected on a fair and non-discriminatory basis in accordance
with the laws of the United States and the States of New York and New Jersey
dealing with equal employment opportunities. The proposed amendment
continues this requirement.
(Id. at 1843-44)

Notably, the NYSA issued a statement in support of the legislation

unreservedly endorsing the suggested amendatory language, particularly concerning the
certification requirement that hiring be done in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. (Letter to
Honorable George E. Pataki dated June 28, 1999 [attached as Exhibit 3 to the Certification of James
R. Campbell, Esq., in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction], SORIAL AFFIDAVIT,

New York and New Jersey.

NEW YORK STATE DIVISION OF HUMAN RIGHTS CHARGES AGAINST
THE NYSA, ILA AND ILA LOCALS

Notwithstanding Section 5-p’s requirement that the selection of persons sponsored be made
on a fair and non-discriminatory basis, it is well reported that the Commission has taken the position
that there remains a lack of diversity in waterfront employment as well as an income gap among
those few minorities that are employed there. The issues between the Commission and the NYSA,

On August 7, 2012, the New York State Division of Human Rights (hereinafter, “DHR”)
filed a Complaint against the NYSA, MMMCA, ILA and ILA Local 1814, among others, alleging
violations of New York State human rights laws for failing to employ individuals on the New York
docks and for the exclusion of applicants from union membership because of their race, color,
national origin or sex. (DHR Complaint, attached to SORIAL AFFIDAVIT as Exhibit D) The DHR
Complaint alleges, inter alia, that with regard to New York harbor: the ILA workforce lacks racial
diversity and does not reflect the racial composition of the surrounding communities; the ILA
workforce lacks diversity as it relates to sex because the number of women working on the docks is
minimal (DHR Compl. ¶ 39); ILA referral practices and the employer sponsorship system have
caused a disproportionate number of minorities and women to be excluded from ILA membership
and employment opportunities with NYSA and MMMCA (Id., ¶ 40); and NYSA, ILA and various
ILA locals have refused to integrate their workforce to allow minorities and women to be union
members. (Id. ¶¶ 45-48) The Complaint specifically alleges:
In March of 2011, the NYSA and ILA sent a formal “joint proposal” [to the
Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor] requesting new baggage handlers
for the ports of New York and New Jersey. After negotiations, the Commission
agreed in May of 2011 to open the Deep Sea Register in order to add 50 new
4

Inasmuch as they are not set forth within the parameters of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, they
will not be reiterated herein.
11

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 19 of 49 PageID: 1134

temporary baggage handlers. Additionally it was agreed that the NYSA and ILA
would each provide 25 individuals to the pool of candidates and ensure diversity
existed among the new temporary registrants. The Commission would select an
additional 50 individuals from its prequalified candidates and all names would be
submitted to a lottery. The NYSA did not have a hiring process and as a result
deferred its 25 candidates to the ILA.
In late May of 2011, the president of the NYSA, Mr. Joseph Curto, certified that
the 50 candidate pool provided to the Commission was chosen in a fair and
nondiscriminatory way . . .The Commission began to qualify the ILA-NYSA
candidates as baggage handlers. However, despite its agreement to provide a
diverse pool of registrants the process revealed that virtually all ILA-NYSA
candidates were White men, except for 3 White women and 1 African American
who did not wish to proceed with the certification process. As a result of the
ILA-NYSA’s failure to provide a diversified pool, the Commission stopped
certifying the ILA-NYSA candidates, leaving 8 candidates uncertified and unable
to work.
(Id. ¶¶ 45-48)

Among its requests for relief, the DHR has demanded outreach and

advertising to local communities regarding the availability of jobs, and the requirement that
respondents certify that their employment practices are done in a fair and non-discriminatory
manner. (Id. ¶¶ 56, 58)
IV. THE COMMISSION’S AMENDMENT TO REGULATION 4.4(D)
Section 4.4(d) of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations (hereinafter “Rule 4.4(d)”),
which pertains to the hiring of “A” registrants, provides that “no application shall be accepted from
any person seeking inclusion in the ‘A’ register unless that person is sponsored for employment by
a stevedore or by any person, within the meaning of those terms contained in the 1969 amendments
to the Act.” In May 2013, the Commission advised NYSA employers that, pursuant to their
request, it would permit them to sponsor and hire “A” registrants directly to perform maintenance
and other tasks incidental to cargo handling. (Compl. ¶38)
The hiring procedures set forth in the NYSA-ILA CBA and the MMMCA-ILA CBA with
regard to “A” registrants provide, in pertinent part, that “[w]ith respect to new employees, the
Employer shall notify the [ILA] of the number and classifications of employees required. It shall be
12

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 20 of 49 PageID: 1135

the responsibility of the [ILA] to furnish the necessary employees requested by the Employer.”
(Compl. ¶39) In short, the NYSA and MMMCA – the employers – have surrendered to the ILA the
exclusive right to initially recruit and select those individuals that are referred to the employers to
be considered for employment as “A” registrant mechanics. Under this framework, the employers’
selection and sponsorship of individuals is only from the applicants supplied to them by the ILA.
The Commission determined that the hiring procedures set forth in those collective bargaining
agreements, reminiscent of the “shape-up” banned by the Act (as discussed below at page 22),
promote the very same deleterious conditions expressly enumerated in the Act (e.g., the lack of a
systematic method of hiring, irregularity of employment, the lack of adequate information as to the
availability of employment, and the selection of employees by those who are neither responsive nor
responsible to the employers). (Compl. ¶46; Compl. - Exh. 4 and 5)
On August 26, 2013, the Commission sent NYSA President John Nardi an email advising
that a proposed modification to Rule 4.4(d) was going to be presented to the Commissioners for
adoption at the September 9, 2013 Commission meeting. (Compl. ¶ 40) (August 26, 2013 Email
from Jeffrey R. Schoen to John Nardi, attached to SORIAL AFFIDAVIT as Exhibit E) Attached to that
email was the amendatory language requiring the sponsoring employer to submit a letter setting
forth the name and address of the person, and the labor service(s) to be performed, and to certify
that the selection of the persons so sponsored was made in a fair and nondiscriminatory basis in
accordance with the requirements of the laws of the United States and the States of New York and
New Jersey dealing with equal employment opportunities. (Compl. ¶ 40) The Commission invited
Mr. Nardi to submit any comments before or at this meeting, and asked him to advise the
Commission if he was planning on appearing. (SORIAL AFFIDAVIT, Exhibit E)
By letter dated September 6, 2013, the NYSA opposed the certification requirement
proposed by the Commission. (Compl. ¶41; September 6, 2013 letter attached to SORIAL AFFIDAVIT
13

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 21 of 49 PageID: 1136

as Exhibit F) On September 9, 2013, the MMMCA also opposed the amendment. (Compl. ¶
43)(September 9, 2013 letter attached to SORIAL AFFIDAVIT as Exhibit G)5 Instead of the language
set forth above, NYSA proposed that the employer certify that “to the extent of its involvement the
hiring of the employee was fair and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the requirements of the
laws of the United States and the States of New York and New Jersey dealing with equal
employment opportunities.” (Compl. ¶42) The NYSA declined the Commission’s invitation to
submit comments at the meeting. After reviewing written opposition by the NYSA (which was
virtually the same as the MMMCA), the Commission adopted the Resolution amending Section
4.4(d) on September 9, 2013. (Compl.¶44 - Exh. 5)
V. REQUEST TO OPEN THE DEEP SEA LONGSHOREMEN’S REGISTER AND THE
COMMISSION’S ISSUANCE OF DETERMINATION 35
By letter dated September 9, 2013, the NYSA and ILA requested that the Commission, on
its own initiative pursuant to Section 5-p, add 682 employees (532 longshoremen and 150 checkers)
to the deep sea register. (Compl. ¶32; Compl. - Exh. 2) The NYSA and ILA advised that they,
along with the terminal operators, will recruit, hire, and train as per the terms of the Recruitment
and Hiring Plan (hereinafter, “Hiring Plan”) of the new NYSA-ILA collective bargaining
agreement. (Id.) That Hiring Plan provides that “[t]he selection process for new hires will include
three designated referral sources: Military Veterans (51%), ILA (25%), and NYSA/Employers
(24%).” (Compl. ¶31; Compl. - Exh. 1 at 4) It further provides that each applicant from the three
pools will be interviewed and evaluated by an Employment Screening Committee, consisting of the
terminal operator employer, the ILA Director of Safety, and the NYSA Director of Workforce
Development. (Compl. - Exh. 1 at 5) As part of their request, the ILA-NYSA Contract Board
specifically requested that new employees be brought into the industry in a metered sequence of 150

A review of these two letters, both of which are directly referenced in Plaintiffs’ Amended
Complaint, reveals that they are virtually identical.

longshoremen and 25 checkers per month, “to allow for proper training without creating a backlog
of individuals waiting to be trained.” (Compl. ¶33; Compl. - Exh. 2 at 4)
On November 6, 2013, the Commission met with the NYSA and representatives of The Port
Authority of New York & New Jersey (hereinafter “PANYNJ”) in order to address various port
hiring

issues.

On December 3, 2013, the Commission issued Determination 35, which opened up the deep
sea longshoremen’s register. (Compl. ¶34; Compl. - Exh. 3) The Commission indicated that it had
consulted with industry representatives of management and labor concerning their request for
longshore employees, and determined that “the immediate addition of 150 longshore employees is
appropriate in light of current shortages and that the future addition of 382 longshore employees is
appropriate in light of expected retirements in April 2014.” (Id. at 2-3) The Commission also
found that the immediate addition of 75 checkers was appropriate, and that the future addition of
checkers is appropriate in light of the expected April 2014 retirements. (Id.at 3) The Commission
also determined that:
the Hiring Plan is, in fact, appropriate if it is (1) implemented according to its
terms; (2) not utilized as a means by which to deny particular groups of persons
the opportunity to become longshore workers; and (3) not utilized as a subterfuge
to permit a referral source to exceed the percentages allotted to it by the Hiring
Plan through the inclusion of its referrals in other referral pools;
(Id. at 3) Since the Hiring Plan was promulgated and administered by the NYSA-ILA Contract
Board and its representatives, the Commission required that a representative of the Board directly
involved with the administration of the Hiring Plan to submit a certification that (1) he or she has
15

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 23 of 49 PageID: 1138

personal knowledge of the facts concerning the recruitment, referral, selection and sponsorship of
that individual, and (2) the selection of the person so sponsored was made in a fair and
nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the requirements of the lase of the United States and the
States of New York and New Jersey dealing with equal employment opportunities. (Id. at 4) In
light of Plaintiffs’ demonstrated failure to take their certification obligations seriously in the past,
and to caution them of the potential legal consequences of submitting a false sponsorship letter, the
Commission specifically referenced the statutory prohibition of offering of a false instrument for
filing, as set forth under N.Y. Penal Law § 175.35, in its determination. (Id. at 5)
VI. CURRENT PROCEEDINGS
Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on November 22, 2013 seeking declaratory, injunctive, and
other relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 2201-2202 (West 2006). On
December 11, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, seeking an order
restraining the Commission from implementing or enforcing the September 9, 2013 amendment to
Rule 4.4(d), which is at issue in this litigation. That motion was denied by this Court, in part,
because of Plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the
merits. On December 16, 2013, the Commission filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint for failure
to state a claim. On January 7, 2014, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, again seeking
declaratory, injunctive and other relief. For the reasons set forth herein, it is respectfully submitted
that the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and must
therefore be dismissed in its entirety.
LEGAL ARGUMENT
I.

STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR MOTIONS TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM
In deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted

under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must “‘accept all factual allegations as true, construe the
16

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 24 of 49 PageID: 1139

complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable
reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.”’ Phillips v. County of Allegheny,
515 F.3d 224, 232 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). However, “the tenet that a court must accept as
true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare
recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not
suffice.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). The adequacy of pleadings is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), which
requires that a complaint allege “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is
entitled to relief.” Additionally, an adequate complaint “requires more than labels and conclusions,
and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must
be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . .” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555
(internal citations omitted)
Generally, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual
matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. A claim has
facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility
requirement is not akin to a probability requirement and instead, asks for more than a sheer
possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are “merel y
consistent with” a defendant's liability, it “stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility
of ‘entitlement to relief.’” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556–57) (internal
citations omitted). Determining whether the allegations in a complaint are “plausible” is “a contextspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common
sense.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950. If the “well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more

17

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 25 of 49 PageID: 1140

than the mere possibility of misconduct,” the complaint should be dismissed for failing to show that
the pleader is entitled to relief, as required by Rule 8(a)(2). Id.
As set forth above, in reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court may
consider the allegations of the complaint, as well as documents attached to or specifically
referenced in the complaint, and matters of public record. Pittsburgh, 147 F3d at 259; see also 5B
Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 3d § 1357 (3d ed.
2007). In this matter, for the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fails to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted and must therefore be dismissed.
II.

COUNT I SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE CERTIFICATION PROVISION IN
REGULATION 4.4(D) AND SECTION 5-P IS A VALID AMENDMENT OF THE
COMPACT AND WAS THEREFORE MADE WITH CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT
Plaintiffs allege that the purposes of the Compact did not include requiring employers to

certify that the selection of longshoremen to be registered complied with federal and state laws
dealing with equal employment opportunities, nor did it include “enhancement of the diversity of
the registered workforce of longshoremen.” (Compl. ¶ 57).

They contend that the certification

provision in Section 5-p is therefore an invalid amendment of the Act. These arguments are without
merit. As an initial matter, it is well settled that enactments in furtherance of the Compact, or as
amendments or supplements to implement its purposes, are deemed to have been approved by
Congress in advance. See, Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor v. Construction and Marine
Equipment Company, Inc., 928 F. Supp. at 1403. In this instance, the amendatory language at issue
was included in Section 5-p by the legislatures of the states of New York and New Jersey. It is well
established that “[l]egislatures are presumed to have acted constitutionally.” See, e.g., McDonald v.
Board of Election Comm’rs, 394 U.S. 802, 809 (1969).6

6

Notably, NYSA has introduced several bills to the New York State Legislature to repeal various
sections of 5-p. As detailed in the NYSA’s 2012 annual report:
18

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 26 of 49 PageID: 1141

The purposes of the Act that were specifically articulated by the legislatures in 1953
included the elimination of oppressive and evil hiring practices injurious to waterfront labor in the
Port. The legislatures deemed the regulation of longshoremen and stevedores to be in the public
interest, and that such regulation by the Commission was “an exercise of the police power of the
two States for the protection of public safety, welfare, prosperity, health, peace and living
conditions of the people of the two States.” N.J.S.A. 32:23-23-5; N.Y. UNCONSOL. 9805.

The

Commission was established to remedy and rectify degrading labor conditions, corrupt hiring
practices and irregularity of employment.
Discrimination in hiring based on race, color, national origin or sex clearly falls within these
enumerated categories, and is well within the purview of the Act. Thus, the enactment of 5-p
clearly implements the purposes of the Act. Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary are completely
belied by Plaintiffs’ sworn testimony of before this Commission in 1999 and the written statement
The import of a number of stories in the local and regional press proved to be
detrimental to that effort, which described workplace condition in the industry as
drug infested, and the scathing findings of a special report issued by the
Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor in March of 2012. The Waterfront
Commission report, which was the result of an investigation and hearings
convened by the Commission between October and December of 2010, depicted
conditions in the Port’s maritime industry that evolved over decades as a result of
“custom and practice” as an environment that fostered unfair employment
practices. The report portrayed the collective bargaining agreement between the
New York Shipping Association and the International Longshoremen’s
Association (ILA) as an agreement which “breeds waste and favoritism and
detracts from the competitiveness of the Port of New York & New Jersey,” . . and
also provides prime positions described as low-show and no-show jobs to
members of our workforce who have a questionable or an actual history of
association with organized crime figures (which is of course not permitted under
the law). After meetings with [members of the New York State Senate], it
became evident that there are a number of housekeeping issues that need to be
addressed by the industry before serious consideration could be given to the
amending section 5-p.

Commission of New York Harbor – New York Legislation, at 30-31 [Dec. 2012])(found at

Apparently frustrated

of the NYSA to then Governor Pataki in support of the 1999 5-p legislation.

Plaintiffs

unreservedly supported the purposes and language of the 1999 legislation amending Section 5-p,
and endorsed the suggested amendatory language, particularly concerning the certification
requirement that hiring be done in a fair and non-discriminatory manner:
Of equal importance, this legislation makes is sure that future additions to the
workforce contain a number of women, Blacks and Hispanics. The amendatory
language differs from the process required by the current law under which wouldbe longshore workers apply to the Commission, and the Commission considers
each application on a first come, first served basis, which obviously does not
result in a guarantee that any members of the aforementioned groups would be
added to the workforce on a permanent basis.
S.4488-B, A 7634-B requires that the applications of sponsorship by the
prospective employers include a certification that the applicants were selected in a
fair non-discriminatory basis, that complies with state and federal equal
employment opportunity laws. The parties believe that this language is more than
adequate to assure that the persons sponsored will include a number of women,
Blacks and Hispanics.
. . . NYSA and ILA wish to assure you that the industry is committed to further
increase the representation of minority groups within its workforce.
(Emphasis added)(SORIAL AFFIDAVIT, Exhibit C). Plaintiff’s allegations to the contrary are
totally unsupportable.
Indeed, the eradication of corrupt employment practices in the Port is one of the foremost
reasons for which this Commission was created. In addition to the Act itself, there is extensive case
law in support. See, e.g., Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor v. Mercedes-Benz, 99 N. J.
402, 403 (1985) (“In accordance with its statutory mandate to eliminate the pervasive involvement

The June 28, 1999 letter, which directly undermines every allegation by Plaintiffs pertaining to
Section 5-p, was inexplicably attached to the Certification of James R. Campbell, counsel for the
NYSA, in Support of the NYSA and ILA’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed with this Court
on December 11, 2013. It is certainly not for Defendant to comment on Plaintiffs’ puzzling
litigation strategy, but only to observe that this document – which is fatal to several counts of
Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint – would not have otherwise been relied upon by Defendant in
support of this motion, since it was not attached to, or referenced in, the Complaint or the Amended
Complaint. As set forth above, this Court may now properly consider this document a matter of
public record for purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Caldwell Trucking
PRP Group, 890 F. Supp. at 1252.

of criminals in waterfront activity, the Waterfront Commission established by the Act proceeded to
regulate employment practices in the Port of New York.”) (citing N.J.S.A. 32:23-7; N.Y.
UNCONSOL. 9807); see also Connolly v. O’Malley, 234 N.Y.S2d 889, 896 (App. Div. 1st Dept.
1962)(“The purposes of the Act were to eliminate depressing and degrading labor conditions,
corrupt hiring practices and . . . to control and regulate in the public interest the occupations of
longshoremen, stevedores. . . Clearly, in the administration and enforcement of the provision of the
Act, paramount considerations are the public interest and orderly waterfront employment and the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the people”).
This issue was also squarely addressed in Cernadas v. The Waterfront Commission of New
York Harbor, Index No. 22405/80, Sup. Ct. Sp. Term 1981)(aff’d)(attached to SORIAL AFFIDAVIT as
Exhibit H) (holding that a business agent was required to obey a subpoena issued by the
Commission pertaining to its inquiry concerning possible racial discrimination in dock employment.
In that case, the Court addressed the Act’s Findings and Declarations and held:
to combat these conditions, the Commission has promulgated certain regulations . .
.designed to effectuate the purposes of the Waterfront Commission Act and to prevent
circumvention and evasion thereof. The regulations are designed to further the public
policies of the States of New York and New Jersey by providing fair and equal
employment opportunities and by establishing a systematic method of hiring.
To further these ends, it is necessary that the Commission conducts an investigation to
determine whether racial discrimination has played a part in the hiring of longshoremen.
Upon a finding that in fact racial quotas have been employed in determining which
longshoremen are hired, it could, if it be so advised, revoke, suspend or reprimand the
license of one or more persons governed by it . . .Such potential disciplinary action is,
of course, not covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
Id at 3-4. (internal citations and alteration marks omitted) It cannot be cogently alleged, as
Plaintiffs have alleged, that discrimination in hiring based on race, color, national origin or sex does
not fall within these enumerated categories and within the purview of the Act. Under this backdrop,
there can be no question that Rule 4.4(d), which requires employers to certify that the selection of

21

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 29 of 49 PageID: 1144

longshoremen complied with federal and state laws dealing with equal employment opportunities, is
in furtherance of, and effectuates, the purposes of the Act.
COUNT II SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE COMMISSION’S AMENDMENT
TO RULE 4.4(D) WAS WITHIN ITS STATUTORY AUTHORITY

III.

In general, the Commission is empowered to make and enforce such rules and regulations as
the Commission may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act, “or to prevent the
circumvention or evasion thereof.” N.J.S.A. 32:23-10(7); N.Y. UNCONSOL. 9810. In accordance
with the ordinary rules for construction of interstate compacts, the Act “shall be liberally construed
to eliminate the evils described therein and to effectuate the purposes thereof.” Id. at §32:23-72; Id.
at § 9872)
It is well settled that “an agency’s grant of authority to promulgate regulations is to be
liberally construed to enable the agency to accomplish its statutory goals.” Waterfront Comm’n of
New York Harbor v. Construction and Marine Equipment Co., Inc., 928 F. Supp. 1388, 1488
(D.N.J. 1996), aff’d 105 F.3d 115 (3rd Cir. 1996)(citation omitted).

“A court must accord

substantial deference to the regulations adopted by administrative agencies, based on our
recognition that certain subjects are within the peculiar competence of that agency.” Id. Under this
framework, regulations of an agency are accorded a presumption of reasonableness, and “courts
must not substitute their judgment for the expertise of the agency.” Id. Moreover, “courts generally
place considerable weight on the construction of a statute given by the agency charged with
enforcing it, and understand that agencies must be flexible and responsive to changing situations in
adopting regulations.” Id.
In this matter, as described above, the NYSA and MMMCA – the employers in the Port –
have completely surrendered to the ILA the exclusive right to initially recruit and select those
individuals that are referred to the employers to be considered for employment as “A” registrant
mechanics. These are not necessarily ILA members and indeed, rarely are. Under this framework,
22

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 30 of 49 PageID: 1145

the employers’ selection and sponsorship of individuals is only from the applicants supplied to them
by the ILA.
This agreed upon manner of hiring simply advances the “shape-up”8 method of employment
that is specifically prohibited by the Act, and promotes the very same deleterious conditions
expressly enumerated in the Act, including the lack of a systematic method of hiring, irregularity of
employment, the lack of adequate information as to the availability of employment, and the
selection of employees by those who are neither responsive nor responsible to the employers.
Indeed, it specifically goes against the testimony of the employers in support of the 1999 5-p
amendment at the public hearings cited above, that the opportunity for the employers to have a role
in the selection process and the referral of personnel “puts the onus back on the employer to make
the right selection,” in accordance with relevant criteria.
By amending Rule 4.4(d) to require the certification of employers that their selection was
done in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner, the Commission – while not dictating to employers
the manner in which employees are to be selected – is ensuring that employers will be active,
accountable participants in the process.

This is particularly critical since the ILA has not been

receptive to the thought of going to employment centers and other non-traditional (i.e., non-union)
venues to assemble a diverse pool of potential employees. Disturbingly, the position of the ILA
was best summarized by International President and former Local 1804-1 President, Harold
8

Prior to the advent of the Commission, the Crime Commission Report described the “shape up”
method of hiring as a distressing condition faced by waterfront labor:
Among the more unhealthy conditions existing on the waterfront are the present shapeup system of hiring dock workers and the practice of compelling employers to accept
undesirable men as hiring foremen. . .Under the shape-up the hiring foremen holds the
key position on the pier, and has the absolute right to use any method he desires and to
employ anyone he wishes. The right, therefore to select and control the hiring foreman
is of vital importance to all concerned. . . The power to hire not only enables an
unscrupulous hiring foreman to exact tribute from the dock worker but also makes it
possible for him to dispense patronage to relatives, friends and criminal associates.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/nyregion/told-to-diversify-dock-union-offers-nearly-all-whitelist.html) The Commission’s regulation is a means by which to ensure that employers will remain
diligent, and accountable, in ensuring that the hiring of “A” registrants is done in a fair and
discriminatory manner.
Plaintiffs contend that the Rule 4.4(d) amendment was improper because neither Section 5-p
nor any other provision of law authorizes the Commission to require employers to submit a
certification with respect to the hiring of “A” registrants. Plaintiffs contend that Section 5-p does
not apply to “A” registrants, and that on its face, Section 5-p applies only deep sea longshoremen
who are in the closed register. In support of their allegations, Plaintiffs cite to Bozzi, supra, for the
proposition that the Commission “has consistently interpreted [Section 5-p] as applying only to the
Deep-Sea longshoremen’s register and not to the “A” Register.” (Compl. ¶64)
In so arguing, Plaintiffs ignore the clear language of Section 5-p(5)(b) which provides:
[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may include in
the longshoremen’s register under such terms and conditions as the
commission may prescribe: . . . (b) a person defined as a longshoreman in [§
9905(6)] of this act who is employed by a stevedore defined in [§9905(1)(b)&(c)]
and whose employment is not subject to the guaranteed annual income provisions
of any collective bargaining agreement relating to longshoremen.”
(Emphasis added)(McK. Unconsol. Laws 9920; N.J.S.A. 32:23-114). Plaintiffs have not, and
indeed cannot, dispute that “A” registrants fall squarely within Section 5-p(5)(b) of the Act.
It is well settled that courts must defer to reasonable agency interpretations of administrative
statutes. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).
“Interpretation given a statute by an agency charged with its enforcement is, as a general matter,
given great weight and judicial deference, so long as the interpretation is neither irrational,
24

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 32 of 49 PageID: 1147

unreasonable nor inconsistent with the governing statute.” Bozzi, supra at *9 (citations omitted). In
this instance, the Act specifically empowers the Commission to prescribe the terms and conditions
pursuant to which “A” registrants may be included. The Commission’s amendment to Rule 4.4(d)
was therefore expressly permitted under Section 5-p(5)(b).
Plaintiffs misstate both the issue and legal holding of Bozzi, supra. In that case, two
longshoremen who had initially been brought in to the industry as “A” registrants under Section 5p(4)(a) (now codified as Section 5-p(5)(a)) sought inclusion in the closed register as unrestricted
deep sea longshoremen. As set forth in the Statement of Facts, above, the court extensively
reviewed the Act’s legislative history and found that this provision of Section 5-p was, as the
Commission contended, simply a “housekeeping” to clarify the status of “A” registrants. (Bozzi,
supra at *11)

The Court observed that the 1998 amendatory language with respect to “A”

registrants “was proposed simply to clarify that the practice of registering the ‘1969’ amendment
longshoremen without regard to the closed register was to continue.” Bozzi, supra at *11. The
Court therefore agreed with the Commission’s position that the two “A” registrants could not be
included in the closed deep-sea register. Id.
Plaintiffs have correctly pointed out that in Bozzi, the Commission maintained that it has
consistently interpreted the closed register statute as applying only to the deep sea longshoremen’s
register and not to the “A” register, and that persons who have been and are being added to the
longshoremen’s register pursuant to the 1969 amendments to the Act should be excluded from the
closed register provisions of Section-5p. Bozzi, supra at *21. In so arguing, the Commission was
re-stating its position as presented to the legislatures in support of the bill, that “[t]hese classes of
persons would not be subject to the requirement that the Register be open for their admission
pursuant to [§9920] of the Act and their applications for registration would not require that they be
processed on a first-come, first-served basis.” Bozzi, supra at *25. The Commission did not, as
25

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 33 of 49 PageID: 1148

Plaintiffs contend, mean that none of the provisions of Section 5-p could apply to it. Since the
Commission is best suited to interpret its administrative statute, Plaintiffs’ claims must be
dismissed.
IV.

COUNTS III AND IV SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE COMMISSION’S
AMENDMENT TO RULE 4.4(D) IS NOT AN IMPROPER INTERFERENCE WITH
PLAINTIFF’S COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS AND DOES NOT VIOLATE
NATIONAL LABOR POLICY
Plaintiffs argue that by requiring employers to certify that the selection of “A” registrants

was made in a fair and non-discriminatory basis, the Commission is forcing them to choose between
breaching their collective bargaining agreements or seeking to renegotiate them. (Compl. ¶72)
Plaintiffs claim that as a result of the recently amended Rule 4.4(d), NYSA and MMMCA members
will have to “eschew” the union-referral systems of their labor contracts pertaining to the
employment of “A” registrants. (Compl. ¶78) Plaintiffs generally allege that the Commission has
interfered with their collective bargaining rights in violation of the Act, and that it has violated
national labor policy by attempting to dictate the substantive terms of Plaintiffs’ collective
bargaining agreements. These allegations are without merit.
It is well settled that, in approving the Act, Congress expressly granted the Commission the
authority to infringe upon federally guaranteed collective bargaining rights traditionally reserved to
Plaintiffs’ exclusive control:
If the Waterfront Commission Act were purely a creature of bi-state law, the
doctrine of preemption would be applicable to remedy any existing conflicts
between it and federal labor law. State attempts to influence the substantive terms
of collective-bargaining agreement may conflict with federal labor law. It is
recognized that matters of seniority classification, hiring priorities and employee
transfers from section to section, are commonly matters subject to collective
bargaining and generally within the exclusive province of employers and unions.
Thus, where a state law empowers a state commission to intrude into areas
normally reserved to collective bargaining, federal preemption might bar such
state action whenever it directly infringes upon rights guaranteed by the federal
Labor Act. However, the touchstone to finding a basis to preemption in this type
of controversy must be Congressional intent to preempt.
26

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 34 of 49 PageID: 1149

Here, Congress has specifically adopted the bi-state legislation. In approving
the Act, Congress has already authorized the impairment of collective
bargaining rights are provided by federal labor law. Inasmuch as the
Commission was granted total control over the expansion or reduction of the
workforce, the Commission’s authority already “infringes” upon collective
bargaining function normally reserved only to employers and unions. Thus,
Congress has already created an exception and specifically anticipated the need
for future enactments and other action necessary to the carrying out and
effectuation of the compact. In vesting the Commission with the sole power to
control the size and character of the labor force, Congress specifically
sanctioned the Waterfront Act, with full knowledge and intention that its
specific provisions would override the general polices of federal labor rights
if the two came in conflict. In contemplating the Commission’s need to enact, in
futuro, further edits to continue to effectuate the policies of the compact, Congress
approved those additional interferences with federal labor law which might arise
as a natural consequence thereof.
New York Shipping Association, Inc., et al. v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, Civ. A. No.
78-995 (D.N.J. June 1, 1978), aff’d 582 F.2d 1275 (3d Cir. 1978)(Emphasis added, internal citations
omitted)(attached to SORIAL AFFIDAVIT as Exhibit I).
Going forward, the Commission may continue to “infringe” on such collective bargaining
rights if its actions are in furtherance of the original policies and purposes of the Act. Id. (“If it does
so, then that impairment was specifically anticipated by Congress and has its approbation, for in
approving the compact Congress also put its imprimatur on future legislation in furtherance of the
original policies and purposes of the compact.”) As the Supreme Court noted:
It is of great significance that in approving the [Waterfront Commission] compact
Congress did not merely remain silent regarding supplementary legislation by the
States. Congress expressly gave its consent to such implementing legislation not
formally part of the compact. This provision in the consent by Congress to a
compact is so extraordinary as to be unique in the history of compacts. Of all the
instances of congressional approval of state compacts – the process began in
1791, with more than one hundred compacts approved since – we have found no
other in which Congress expressly gave its consent to implementing legislation.
It is instructive that this unique provision has occurred in connection with
approval of a compact dealing with the prevention of crime where, because of a
peculiarly local nature of the problem, the inference is strongest that local polices
are not to be thwarted.
De Veau, 363 U.S. 144 at 154. As set forth above, one of the Commission’s critical statutory
mandates under the Act is to ensure that longshoremen are employed using systematic hiring
27

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 35 of 49 PageID: 1150

methods. While the Act safeguards the collective bargaining rights of labor and management to
agree upon methods for the selection of longshoremen by way of seniority, experience, regular
gangs, or otherwise, such methods cannot be in conflict with the Act. N.J.S.A. 32:23-69(2); N.Y.
UNCONSOL. 9869; see also Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor v. Sea Land Service, Inc.,
764 F.2d 961 (3rd Cir. 1985)(in reconciling a conflict between the Commission’s registration
provisions and an existing collective bargaining agreement, the court declined to adopt a proposal
that would “trench upon the statutory framework of the Waterfront Commission Act.”)
In this instance, the current method of hiring exclusively through ILA referrals promotes the
very same deleterious conditions expressly enumerated in the Act. Rule 4.4(d), as amended, is not
only proper – it is necessary. The Commission’s regulation is consistent with, and in furtherance of,
the underlying purposes of the Act, and as such, it is not an improper interference with Plaintiffs’
collective bargaining rights and does not interfere with national labor law.
V.

COUNT V SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS NOT PRECLUDED
BY THE PRIMARY AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION DOCTRINE FROM ENSURING
THAT HIRING IN THE PORT IS DONE IN A FAIR AND NONDISCRIMINATORY
MANNER
Plaintiffs allege that the Commission is using the Section 5-p certification as a “sword” to

deny registration to new applicants chosen in a manner that the Commission believes is in violation
of employment discrimination laws. (Compl. ¶82) Generally citing the primary and exclusive
jurisdiction doctrine, Plaintiffs contend that the Commission may not determine violations of
federal or state employment discrimination laws, and that the Commission should instead refer such
matters to “agencies that are statutorily mandated to determine purported violations of employmentdiscrimination laws.” (Compl. ¶83) Plaintiff seek injunctive relief prohibiting the Commission
from using such laws, which they allege it is not authorized to enforce, to deprive them of their right
to hire workers, and to a declaration that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to determine violations
of federal or state employment discrimination laws. (Compl. ¶85)
28

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 36 of 49 PageID: 1151

Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to state a claim under the doctrine of exclusive
primary jurisdiction, which is inapplicable in this matter. “The doctrine of primary jurisdiction, like
the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, is concerned with promoting proper
relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory
duties. ‘Exhaustion’ applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative
agency alone; judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course.
‘Primary jurisdiction,’ on the other hand, applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the
courts, and comes into place whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues
which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an
administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues
to the administrative body for its views.” United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 77
S. CT. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1956).
The doctrine does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, focus on the interplay between administrative
agencies but rather, between the courts and agencies. It allows for agencies to exercise discretion
“in cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases…” United
States v. Western Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 64 (1956).

A court will decide whether “the

controversy, in the first instance, can and should be resolved in whole or in part before an
administrative tribunal, or whether it must immediately be considered by the judiciary.” Abbott v.
Burke, 100 N.J. 269 (1985) “[W]hen the legislature provides an agency with ‘exclusive primary
jurisdiction,’ it preempts the courts’ original jurisdiction over the subject matter.” Greate Bay Hotel
& Casino v. Tose, 34 F.3d 1227, 1230 n.5. (3d Cir. 1994). “If the legislature has vested an
administrative agency with exclusive primary jurisdiction, the agency is the only forum in which
complaints within that jurisdiction may be adjudicated originally.” Id.

29

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 37 of 49 PageID: 1152

Here, Plaintiffs’ reliance on the doctrine is misplaced. It must be emphasized that the
Commission, which is vested with the authority to insure that waterfront workers are not subjected
to corrupt, depressing and degrading hiring practices, is responsible for ensuring that the
stevedoring companies, who are licensed by the Commission to operate in the Port, are not
engaging in discriminatory hiring practices or in a system of employment that perpetuates such
practices.

As discussed above, in order to be permanently licensed as a stevedore by the

Commission, the Commission must be satisfied that the applicant possesses “good character and
integrity.” N.J.S.A § 32:23-21(b); N.Y. UNCONSOL. § 9821(b). The standard of good character and
integrity remains in effect at all times while licensed with the Commission, and the Commission
may, in its discretion, deny applications for such licenses and revoke licenses as it deems in the
public interest.
If discrimination in hiring is practiced by Commission licensees, then the Commission –
and not some other agency – is in the best position to take expeditious remedial action. Those
licensees would be subject to appropriate censure after notice, an administrative hearing and
determination of charges. Moreover, the Commission is empowered to turn over any evidence of
discrimination to the New Jersey Division of Human Rights, the New York State Division of
Human Rights, or to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.9 Advancement of the public
interest through interagency cooperation was specifically contemplated by the States of New York
and New Jersey during the enactment of the Waterfront Commission Act, which empowers the
Commission:
To co-operate with and receive from any department, division, bureau, board,
commission, or agency of either or both States, or of any county or municipality
thereof, such assistance and data as will enable it to carry out its powers and duties
9

Indeed, as discussed in detail above, there is a case currently pending by the New York State
Division of Human Rights against Plaintiffs (excluding ILA Local 1804-1 which maintains a New
Jersey office and operates on the New Jersey side of the Port), alleging discriminatory referral and
hiring practices in the Port.
30

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 38 of 49 PageID: 1153

hereunder; and to request any such department, division, bureau, board, commission, or
agency, with the consent thereof, to execute such of its functions and powers, as the
public interest may require.
(N.J.S.A. 32:23-10, NY UNCONSOL. 9810) Plaintiff’s allegations to the contrary are without merit,
and Count V must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
VI.

COUNT VI SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED
THAT THE INCLUSION OF 532 LONGSHOREMEN AND 150 CHECKERS IN THE DEEP
SEA REGISTER IS APPROPRIATE, AND DETERMINATION 35 IS THEREFORE NOT
ARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS AND AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Plaintiffs allege that even though they “jointly recommended” that 532 longshoremen and

150 checkers be added to the deep sea register, the Commission issued Determination 35,
announcing that it will approve “a total of 150 longshoremen and 75 checkers.” (Compl. ¶¶ 91-92).
They contend that the Commission has no record and no factual basis for its decision “to reject the
joint recommendation of NYSA and ILA,” and therefore contend that the Commission’s
determination is arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. (Compl. ¶¶ 93-94). Plaintiffs seek
injunctive relief directing the Commission to accept for inclusion in the deep sea register 532
longshoremen and 150 checkers. For the reasons set forth below, these allegations are categorically
untrue and must therefore be dismissed.
First, there was no joint recommendation. There was a request by the NYSA-ILA Contract
Board that the Commission open the register on its own initiative.10 (See Compl. - Exh. 2)

11

Second, Determination 35 did not announce that the Commission will only approve a total of 150
longshoremen and 75 checkers. To the contrary, the Commission specifically acknowledged that
10

11

This is specifically admitted in ¶¶ 32 and 104 of the Amended Complaint.

For purposes of this litigation, the manner by which the deep sea register was opened is
particularly important, because it dictates the legal framework that must be followed under Section
5-p of the Waterfront Commission Act, and directly impacts the Court’s analysis with respect to the
Commission’s actions that are at issue. When the Commission determines to open the deep sea
longshoremen’s register on its own initiative, this is done “in such manner deemed appropriate by
the Commission.”
31

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 39 of 49 PageID: 1154

“the immediate addition of 150 longshore employees is appropriate in light of current shortages and
that the future addition of 382 longshore employees is appropriate in light of the expected
retirements in April 2014, and . . . the immediate addition of 75 checkers is appropriate in light of
current shortages and that the future addition of checkers is appropriate in light of the expected
retirements in April 2014.” (Compl. - Exh. 3 at 2-3)
As set forth in the Statement of Facts, above, the ILA-NYSA Contract Board requested that
new employees be brought into the industry in a metered sequence of 150 longshoremen and 25
checkers per month to allow for proper training without creating a backlog of individuals waiting to
be trained. For that reason, Determination 35 – the first in a series of determinations to open the
deep sea register to meet the industry’s metered-hiring approach – opened the register to accept
applications from 150 longshoremen and 75 checkers. Notwithstanding the Commission’s position
that it will open the deep sea register for the inclusion of 532 longshoremen and 150 checkers,
Plaintiffs allege that “the Commission has stated that it will accept a total of only 150 applications
for longshore positions and only 75 applications for checker positions, compared to the requested
and previously accepted numbers of 532 longshoremen and 150 checkers.”

(Compl. ¶¶ 34, 92)

The allegations of Count VI are without any support and must therefore be dismissed.12
VII.

COUNT VII SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT
ARTICULATED HOW DETERMINATION 35 LIMITS THEIR COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING RIGHTS, AND BECAUSE DETERMINATION 35 IS NOT AN
IMPROPER INTERFERENCE WITH PLAINTIFF’S RIGHTS

In Count VII of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs recite, in bullet point form, various
provisions of Determination 35 and then generally allege that the provisions “dealing with

12

Plaintiffs’ allege that the Commission “had no record and therefore no basis for its decision to
reject the joint recommendation of the NYSA and ILA.” This allegation is denied. However, even
accepting it as true for purposes of this motion, this issue is moot and need not be addressed herein
since the Commission did not reject Plaintiffs’ request.

assignment of seniority, and the formulation of hiring rights and priorities are matters of collective
bargaining, which Article XV of the Compact prohibits the Commission from limiting in any way.”
(Compl. ¶¶98-99) Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for two reasons.
First, Plaintiffs have not articulated how, or in what manner, the cited provisions limit their
collective bargaining rights.13 They make no reference to the collective bargaining provisions or
agreements that are allegedly limited by Determination 35. They do not even generally allege that
any of their rights have been limited by the provisions at issue. Instead, they simply indicate that
the Commission is prohibited from limiting their collective bargaining rights. As set forth above,
the principle that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is
inapplicable to legal conclusions. Ashcroft, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. For this reason alone, Plaintiffs’
claim must be dismissed.
Second, notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ bald recitals, the Commission (as argued at length in
Section IV above) has the express authority to infringe upon federally guaranteed collective
bargaining rights traditionally reserved to Plaintiffs’ control. New York Shipping Association, Inc.,
et al., Civ. A. No. 78-995. This includes various matters relating to hiring that are subject to
collective bargaining and generally within the exclusive province of employers and unions.

Id.

When Congress vested the Commission with “the sole power to control the size and character of the
labor force,” it was with the full knowledge and intention that the Act’s specific provisions would
override the general polices of federal labor rights if the two came in conflict. Id. The Commission
may “infringe” on such collective bargaining rights if its actions are in furtherance of the policies
and purposes of the Act. Id.
In this instance, the provisions at issue ensure that hiring is done in a fair and systematic
fashion. They ensure that the new hires are in accordance with the goals and percentages of the
13

Notably, Plaintiffs have not even included a prayer for relief or requested any legal remedy or
redress from the Court with regard to Count VII.

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 41 of 49 PageID: 1156

collectively bargained Hiring Plan, and that new employees are assigned the appropriate seniority
level so that they are not more senior than those already in the industry. Rather than limit their
rights, the provisions challenged by Plaintiffs are for the express purpose of fulfilling their requests
that (1) new employees be granted temporary registrations in order to allow employers to evaluate
their job performance and replace any employees who display that they are not capable of fulfilling
the job standards; (2) new employees be prevented from having priority over the existing workforce
in the filling of lists; and lastly, (3) to “fulfill the section 5-p standard of assuring regularization of
employment and full utilization of the existing workforce.” (Compl. – Exh. 2 at 4) Plaintiffs’ rights
have not been limited in any way and therefore, Count VII must be dismissed.
VIII. COUNT VIII SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED BY
DETERMINATION 35 DOES NOT VIOLATE SECTION 5-P OF THE ACT
Plaintiffs allege that the Commission is exceeding its statutory authority by requiring
NYSA-ILA Contract Board representatives to certify that the selection of individuals – pursuant to
the Hiring Plan that they promulgated in accordance with their collective bargaining agreement –
was done in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner. Plaintiffs appear to be advancing two arguments
in the Amended Complaint. First, that the Commission is prohibited by the Act from requiring any
certification since it determined to open the deep sea register on its own initiative, rather than
pursuant to a joint recommendation by the industry. Second, that even if a certification was proper,
the Commission cannot require that the certification come from an NYSA/ILA Contract Board
representative, since neither the NYSA nor the ILA is subject to the jurisdiction. 14 (Compl ¶¶105106) Both arguments are without merit.
14

Plaintiffs assert two directly conflicting factual positions regarding the opening of the deep sea
register. In ¶¶91 and 93 (Count VI), they allege that they “jointly recommended” that 532
longshoremen and 150 clerks and checkers be added to the deep sea register and that the
Commission rejected their “joint recommendation.” In ¶32, they allege that they “accepted the
Commission’s suggestion that the Commission open the register on its own initiative,” and in ¶104
(Count VIII) argue that the Commission cannot require a certification “since the Act requires such
34

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 42 of 49 PageID: 1157

In general, the Act provides that when the Commission determines to accept applications for
acceptance for inclusion in the longshoremen’s register on its own initiative, as it did here, “such
acceptance shall be accomplished in such manner deemed appropriate by the Commission.”
N.J.S.A. 32:23-114; N.Y. UNCONSOL. 9920.

In this instance, the NYSA-ILA Contract Board

advised the Commission that they, along with the terminal operators, will recruit, hire, and train the
new longshoremen according to the terms of their new Hiring Plan. New hires will be interviewed
and evaluated by an employment screening committee consisting of the terminal operator employer,
the ILA Director of Safety, and the NYSA Dirctor of Workforce Development.
Even though the Commission may determine the appropriate manner by which to accept
new applications, it advised Plaintiffs that it would accept applications pursuant to their Hiring Plan.
The Commission, as it is statutorily empowered to do, issued Determination 35 to ensure that the
implementation of the Hiring Plan is not done in a manner that will circumvent the purposes of the
Act (i.e., that will promote the lack of a systematic method of hiring, irregularity of employment,
the lack of adequate information as to the availability of employment, and the selection of
employees by those who are neither responsive nor responsible to the employers). As part of that
process, the Commission determined that since the employers are not the ones who are exclusively
recruiting, referring, interviewing and selecting the new hires, they could not feasibly certify that
those individuals were selected in a fair and nondiscriminatory basis. For this reason, it required
that certifications come from a Contract Board representative. This decision was well within the
Commission’s statutory authority and Plaintiffs’ claims to the contrary are without basis.

certifications only when the Commission is not on its own initiative but rather upon a joint
recommendation.” If the Court were to accept the factual allegations in Count VI as true, that
Plaintiffs “jointly recommended” that the Commission open the register, this would defeat their
legal argument in Count VIII that the Commission may not require a certification because it has
opened the register on its own initiative. Plaintiffs’ September 9, 2013 letter, attached to their
Amended Complaint as Exhibit 2, clarifies that they requested that the Commission open the
register on its own initiative.

IX.

COUNT IX SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS WITHIN ITS
AUTHORITY TO CAUTION PLAINTIFFS THAT THE FILING OF A FALSE SPONSORSHIP
LETTER IS PUNISHABLE BY APPLICABLE PENAL LAWS
In light of Plaintiffs’ demonstrated failure to take their certification obligations seriously in

the past, and to caution them of the potential legal consequences of submitting a false sponsorship
letter, the Commission specifically referenced the statutory prohibition of offering of a false
instrument for filing, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law § 175.35, in Determination 35. (Compl. – Exh. 3
at 5)15 Plaintiffs allege that “the Commission lacks legislative authority to impose a criminal
sanction for a purported violation of one of its determinations,” and seek a declaration that the
Commission is prohibited from imposing a criminal sanction for the submission of a false
sponsorship letter. (Compl. ¶¶114-115) There is no basis for Plaintiffs’ claims.
N.Y. Penal Law § 175.35 (McKinney 2010) provides, in pertinent part:
A person is guilty of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree when,
knowing that a written instrument contains a false statement or false information,
and with intent to defraud the state or any political subdivision, public authority or
public benefit corporation of the state, he offers or presents it to a public office,
public servant, public authority or public benefit corporation with the knowledge
or belief that it will be filed with, registered or recorded in or otherwise become
part of the records of such public office, public servant, public authority or public
benefit corporation.
“Written instrument,” is defined as “any instrument or article . . . containing written or printed
matter or the equivalent thereof, used for the purpose of reciting, embodying, conveying or
regarding information, or constituting a symbol or evidence of value, right, privilege or
15

Section 1.23 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations provides that the Commission’s records
are to be made public, and available for inspection, at its main office located at 39 Broadway, New
York, New York. Pursuant to §1.23(b), requests for access to those records are to be submitted to
the Commission’s Secretary, also at this address. For this reason, in accordance with the
Commission’s longstanding practice, Determination 35 provides that the sponsorship letters at issue
are to be filed in the Commission’s New York office. If the Commission had, instead, required
sponsorship letters to be filed in its New Jersey offices, those written instruments would be subject
to the provisions of New Jersey equivalent statute for offering a false instrument for filing, codified
at N.J.S.A.2C:21-3(b).
36

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 44 of 49 PageID: 1159

identification, which is capable of being used to the advantage or disadvantage of some person.”
N.Y. Penal Law §175.00 (McKinney 2010).
In general, the purpose of the false filing statute is “to guard against the possibility that
officers of the State or its political subdivisions would act upon false or fraudulent ‘instruments’
that had been filed with their offices in the belief that such documents were accurate and true.”
People v. John E. Headley, 960 N.Y.S.2d 51 (Sup. Ct. 2012)(quoting People v. Bel Air Equipment
Corp., 39 NY 2d 48, 54 (Ct. App. 1976)) When a claim is made that a document is not an
instrument within the meaning of the statute, “the character and contents of the document must be
closely analyzed. The court must not only ascertain whether the particular document falls within
the literal scope of the statute but is of a character that the mischief the statute seeks to prevent
would ensure if the document were filed.” People v. Bel Air Equipment Corp., 39 NY 2d at 54.
Where both standards are satisfied, the document is an instrument as that term is utilized in the
statute. Id. (payment voucher containing a certification by a contractor that he completed certain
prescribed work was a written instrument); see also People v. Armitt, 195 Misc. 2d 879, 762
N.Y.S.2d 222 (2nd Dep’t 2003)(application for a job with the District Attorney’s office that falsely
stated that the applicant had never been convicted of a crime was a written instrument); People v.
Jacob, 248 AD 2d 638 (2nd Dep’t, 1998)(vouchers submitted to the State Comptroller’s Office were
written instruments even though their content was not relief upon by the government, as the purpose
of the law is to guard against even the possibility that the government would act upon false
instruments filed in the belief that they were accurate).
In this matter, the sponsorship letters at issue fit within both the literal and constructive
scope of the false filing statute. They are written documents, offered to the Commission which is a
public authority, with knowledge or belief that they would become part of the Commission’s
records, containing a certification that, inter alia, hiring was done in a fair and nondiscriminatory
37

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 45 of 49 PageID: 1160

manner. Sponsorship letters are, and will continue to be, relied upon by the Commission as one of
the bases for issuance of longshoremen’s registrations.

Submitting a false sponsorship letter

containing a certification that hiring was done in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner when, in fact,
it had not been, would interfere with the Commission’s legitimate function of ensuring fair hiring in
the Port.
Contrary to Plaintiffs’ allegations, the Commission has not imposed a criminal sanction for
“a purported violation of one of its determinations.” The Commission has simply issued a reminder
to Plaintiffs of the serious, potential legal consequences associated with the submission of a false
written instrument. If the Commission has reason to believe that a false sponsorship letter was filed
by Plaintiffs or their members, the Commission would refer that matter to the appropriate
prosecutorial agency (i.e., the New York County District Attorney’s Office) for further investigation
and/or prosecution. Anyone found to have submitted a false sponsorship letter would be subject to
criminal penalties, regardless of whether the Commission included the cautionary provision within
Determination 35 that is at issue in this litigation. In effect, Plaintiffs have taken the position in this
litigation that it was improper for the Commission to provide them with fair warning that the filing
of a false sponsorship letter is punishable by law. Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim accordingly,
Count IX should be dismissed.
X.

COUNT X SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE COMMISSION’S ISSUANCE OF ITS
RESOLUTION CONCERNING ITS AMENDMENT TO RULE 4.4(D) DID NOT VIOLATE
PLAINTIFFS’ DUE PROCESS RIGHTS
Plaintiffs aver that the procedure used by the Commission to issue the resolution amending

Rule 4.4(d) failed to comport with their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.
(Compl. ¶¶ 121-122) They allege that since the Commission failed to hold hearings at which the

38

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 46 of 49 PageID: 1161

interested parties could provide evidence and argument, the resolution is therefore null and void.
(Compl. ¶¶120-123)16
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that "[n]o state. . . shall. . .deprive any person of life,
liberty or property, without due process of law." A plaintiff must establish that he has a protected
property interest to which the Fourteenth Amendment's due process protection applies. Gikas v.
Washington School District, 328 F.3d 731, 735 (3d Cir.2003). This provision has been interpreted
as having both substantive and procedural components. See, Planned Parenthood of S.E.
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846-47 (1992).
“The basic elements of procedural due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard.”
Fenning v. Materio, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15215, 31 (D.N.J. July 5, 1984) However, it is well
settled that a government agency has no constitutional requirement to hold a public hearing before it
exercises its rule-making authority. Parsons v. United States Postal Service, 380 F. Supp. (D.N.J.
1974); see also Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 519 (1944). Nor does the Administrative
Procedures Act apply to the rule-making powers to the Commission’s regulation that is now at
issue. 39 U.S.C. § 410.

Thus, in this instance, the Commission did not violate Plaintiffs’ due

process rights in promulgating the amendment to Rule 4.4(d) without holding a hearing.17
To establish a claim under Section 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the challenged
conduct deprived him of right, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or the laws of
16

As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for violation of the takings clause of the
Fifth Amendment. “In order to succeed in a due process or takings case under the Fifth
Amendment, a plaintiff must first show that a legally cognizable property interest is affected by the
Government’s action in question.” Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, 373 F.3d 372, 428 (3d Cir.
2004). Here, Plaintiffs’ conclusory allegations that the hiring procedures set forth in their CBA
constitute a property right are without support and must therefore be dismissed.
17

Notably, as set forth in Section IV of the Statement of Facts, the Commission provided the NYSA
with notice of the pending amendment, and invited it to submit comments and to appear at a
Commission meeting. After reviewing the NYSA’s written opposition (which was virtually the
same as that submitted by the MMMCA), the Commission adopted the resolution at issue.
39

Case 2:13-cv-07115-SDW-SCM Document 45 Filed 01/21/14 Page 47 of 49 PageID: 1162

the United States. See Parratta v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 525 (1981). “[T]he first step in evaluating
a section 1983 claim is to identify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been
violated and to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at
all.” Chainey v. Street, 523 F.3d 200, 219 (3d Cir. 2008)(citation omitted). The first thread of
substantive due process applies when a plaintiff challenges the validity of a legislative act.
Typically, a legislative act will withstand challenge if the government identifies a legitimate state
interest that the legislature could rationally conclude was served by the statute, although legislative
acts that burden certain fundamental rights may be subject to stricter scrutiny. Applying these
principles in the context of a motion to dismiss, the Third Circuit has held that “to state a claim,
[plaintiff’s] complaint would have to allege facts that would support a finding of arbitrary or
irrational legislative action by the [legislative body].” Pace Resources, Inc. v. Shrewsbury
Township, 808 F.2d 1023, 1035 (3d Cir. 1987).
In this instance, Rule 4.4(d), which is aimed at ensuring fair and nondiscriminatory hiring in
the Port, falls within the police power of the states of New York and New Jersey. See, e.g.,
Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 928 F. Supp. 1403 (“such power is broadly defined to
include virtually any health, safety, or general welfare goal.”) As long as there is a “minimally
rational relation between the means chosen and the end being pursued, courts must defer to the
exercise of the state’s police power. Unless the state legislature has acted in an ‘arbitrary and
irrational way’, there is a presumption that such regulation is constitutional.” Waterfront Comm’n
of New York Harbor, 928 F. Supp. 1403 (citation omitted). The Complaint states no facts which, if
proven, would support a finding of irrational action. Count X of the Complaint fails to state a valid
claim and must therefore be dismissed.
