INTRODUCTION

2

Lucent and MPT submit this memorandum in opposition to defendants’ motion for reversal

3 of Magistrate Judge Bencivengo’s order denying defendants’ motion to strike the 6-page
4 supplemental expert report of Lucent and MPT’s damages expert Roger Smith. As recognized by
5 the defendants, Magistrate Judge Bencivengo made a Court-informed decision to allow the
6 supplemental expert report and explicitly recognized that Mr. Smith’s expert report was issued in
7 response to an intervening Court ruling that may impact the legal boundaries of the damages
8 analysis. Since Mr. Smith’s report was issued, the defendants have deposed Mr. Smith and issued
9 rebuttal expert reports―well in advance of trial. Therefore, the Magistrate’s refusal to strike the
10 report is clearly in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allowing supplemental
11 expert reports where timely, substantial justified and/or harmless.

Because Magistrate Judge

12 Bencivengo’s order refusing to strike the report is neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law, the
13 Court should deny defendants’ motion.
14 II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

15

The original case between the parties was divided into six trials: Group 1 (Video Coding);

16 Group 2 (Audio Coding); Group 3 (Speech Coding); Group 4 (Graphical User Interface) and Group
17 5 (Fleming/Doughty patents); and Group 6 (Xbox 360), with the first trial set to go forward in
18 November 2006. (Ex. B, Trial Schedule; D.I. 1876.)1 Due to defendants’ repeated requests to
19 postpone the trials and other dispositive motions, the upcoming February 2008 trial involves five
20 remaining Lucent and MPT patents and numerous accused products consolidated from the Group 1,
21 Group 4, Group 5 and Group 6 trials, including Microsoft software, and Gateway and Dell computer
22 systems, and third-party software sold by Gateway and Dell. The upcoming trial was preceded by

1 the Group 2 Audio trial between Lucent and Microsoft that took place in January 2007. Lucent
2 obtained a jury verdict in its favor with the jury awarding Lucent all the damages it sought—over
3 $1.5 billion. (D.I. 1187.) Judge Rudi Brewster subsequently set the verdict aside on August 6, 2007.
4 (D.I. 1975.) In doing so, Judge Brewster concluded that the jury’s damages verdict in that case
5 constituted an inappropriate application of the entire market value rule, because the evidence (in his
6 view) did not permit an award of reasonable royalty damages based on the infringing computer
7 system.2 (Id. at 34.) Previously, Judge Brewster twice denied defendants’ attempts to preclude
8 Lucent’s damages theory regarding the computer system as the royalty base. (D.I. 827 at 4; D.I.
9 1737 at 3.) After the verdict, Judge Brewster even explicitly expressed his view that the jury’s
10 award of damages based on the entire computer system comported with the unrebutted evidence in
11 the Group II trial. (Ex. A, Letter Brief at Ex. 1.) Thus, in setting aside the damages verdict, Judge
12 Brewster reversed his own prior decisions on that very issue, and for the first time potentially placed
13 new legal restrictions on the outcome of the Georgia-Pacific hypothetical negotiation underlying the
14 reasonable royalty.
Lucent and MPT’s damages expert, Roger Smith, subsequently issued a 6-page supplemental

15

16 expert report that expressly purports to address the potential effect of Judge Brewster’s ruling on the
17 Georgia-Pacific analysis. (Ex. C, Second Supp. Report of Roger Smith.) Despite the report being
18 issued more than three months before trial, and after turning down two opportunities to depose Mr.
19 Smith at the time the report was served, (Ex. 1, Letter Brief at Ex. 2; Ex. 1, Letter Brief at Ex. 3.),
20 the defendants requested Magistrate Judge Bencivengo strike the supplemental expert report as
21 untimely. (Def. Opening Br. at Exs. A and B.) After briefing and argument—during which
22 defendants made all of they arguments they do now—Magistrate Judge Bencivengo properly denied
23 defendants’ motion. (D.I. 116). Magistrate Judge Bencivengo gave defendants the opportunity to
24 depose Mr. Smith and to issue rebuttal expert reports. (Id.) Defendants deposed Mr. Smith on

LEGAL STANDARD

4

The Court has already recognized the proper standard of review to be applied to Magistrate

5 Judge Bencivengo’s order. Specifically, as a nondispositive order on a discovery matter, the Court:
6

may only modify or set aside the order if it is “found to be clearly erroneous or
contrary to law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a); 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(A) (magistrate judge’s
decision on nondispositive issue reviewed under clearly erroneous standard); see
Bhan v. NME Hospitals, Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1414 (9th Cir. 1991) (same). Discovery
matters are considered nondispositive. See Bhan, 929 F.2d at 1414; Green v. Baca,
219 F.R.D. 485, 489 (C.D. Cal. 2003).

ARGUMENT

14

Magistrate Judge Bencivengo’s Order Denying Defendants’ Motion To Strike
The Supplemental Report Is Neither Clearly Erroneous Nor Contrary To Law
Because The Report Is Timely, Substantially Justified, And Causes No
Prejudice.

15

1.

16

A.

Mr. Smith’s Report Is Timely Under Rule 26(e).

Rule 26(e) requires supplementation of discovery disclosures at appropriate intervals and

17 seasonable amendments of prior discovery if the earlier discovery is found to be incorrect or
18 incomplete. FED. R. CIV. P. 26(e). With regard to expert testimony, those disclosures are to be made
19 at least 30 days prior to trial. See id; FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(3). As this Court has recognized, an
20 intervening Court ruling may constitute a proper basis for supplementation under Rule 26. See
21 Becton Dickinson and Co. v. Syntron Bioresearch, Inc., No. 97-CV-1634 K (POR), 1998 U.S. Dist.
22 LEXIS 22082, at *50-55 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 1998) (refusing to preclude supplemental expert
23 opinion issued after a court order construing claim terms). Given that Judge Brewster had not
24 previously found to the contrary, and given the law and facts supporting the reasonable royalty in the
25 audio trial prior to the August decision (see D.I. 1848 at 17; D.I. 1849 at 14-16.), Mr. Smith’s brief
26 supplemental report is both timely and justified under Rule 26(e). Accordingly, the Magistrate
27 Judge denial of defendants’ motion to strike was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law. See

3 submitted two months before trial even where supplemental report substantially changed prior
4 opinions).
5

2.

Mr. Smith’s Supplemental Report Is Substantially Justified.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 also provides support for the Magistrate’s Order. As

7 defendants recognize, Rule 37 will not operate to exclude an expert’s opinion if failure to disclose
8 the information during the discovery period is substantially justified or harmless. Mr. Smith’s
9 supplemental expert report addresses only the potential impact of Judge Brewster’s intervening
10 ruling, and is thus substantially justified.

See The SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., No.

11 2:04CV139DAK, 2007 WL 2702456, at *1-3 (D. Utah Sept. 11, 2007) (holding supplemental
12 disclosure substantially justified as a result of an intervening court order); Engineered Prods. Co. v.
13 Donaldson Co., Inc., 313 F. Supp. 2d 951, 1005-06 (N.D. Iowa 2004) (denying motion to strike
14 supplemental expert report because report was substantially justified following a ruling that resolved
15 certain issues as a matter of law).
16

Defendants do not claim that Judge Brewster’s ruling does not constitute an intervening

17 development in the damages portion of this case. Instead, the defendants make the unfounded and
18 misleading claim that Lucent and MPT should have anticipated the intervening development. As
19 discussed above, Judge Brewster twice denied defendants’ previous attempts to preclude Lucent’s
20 damages theory regarding the computer system as the royalty base and even explicitly expressed his
21 view after the verdict that the jury’s award of damages based on the entire computer system
22 comported with the unrebutted evidence in the Group 2 trial. It was not until its decision on post23 trial motions that the Court adopted a different view of the applicable law and facts. Mr. Smith’s
24 supplemental report is substantially justified in light of Judge Brewster’s unanticipated ruling.
25 Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge’s denial of defendants’ motion to strike was neither clearly
26 erroneous nor contrary to law.

Mr. Smith’s Report Causes No Prejudice.

Nor does the timing of the 6-page report cause any genuine prejudice to defendants. The

3 Court has recognized that “preclusion of evidence is among the most severe” of sanctions under
4 Rule 37 and is “generally improper absent undue prejudice.” Klund v. High Tech. Solutions, Inc.,
5 No. 05CV0565JAH, 2006 WL 549385, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2006). The “touchstone” of the
6 prejudice inquiry under Rule 37 is whether “a discovery violation ‘threaten[s] to interfere with the
7 rightful decision of the case’ or ‘impair[s] the moving party’s ability to go to trial.’” Id. (internal
8 citations omitted).
9

Here, both the limited nature of the report and the fact that it was served more than three

10 months before trial demonstrates that it causes no prejudice. It does not present any new evidence or
11 licensing approaches not previously known to the defendants; indeed, all evidence Mr. Smith cites in
12 his supplemental expert report was explicitly discussed in Mr. Smith’s initial reports, and admitted in
13 evidence at the Group 2 trial—some of which is also relied upon by defendants’ own expert.
14 Moreover, Mr. Smith’s supplemental alternative opinions are based on the application of Lucent’s
15 adoption of IBM licensing policies, just as disclosed in his earlier reports.3 Nor has there been any
16 undue delay, since the report was served within a reasonable period after the decision and well
17 before trial. And, defendants have already had the opportunity to fully depose Mr. Smith regarding
18 his opinions expressed in the supplemental report and to issue rebuttal expert reports in ample time
19 before trial.
Numerous courts (including this one) have found such an opportunity to depose the expert

20

21 sufficient to alleviate any alleged prejudice. See, e.g., Michelone v. Desmarais, 25 Fed. Appx. 155,
22 159 (4th Cir. 2002); Lozano v. City of Hazelton, 241 F.R.D. 252, 258-59 (M.D. Pa. 2007);
23
24
Defendants’ complaints that they have been deprived of the chance to seek contradicting
documents or testimony from third parties is disingenuous. Defendants have known the basis for
26 Mr. Smith’s opinions for years and have had ample opportunity to seek discovery regarding IBM
policies.

By statute, Lucent and MPT are entitled to “damages adequate to compensate for the

13 infringement but in no event less that a reasonable royalty” for defendants’ infringement. 35 U.S.C.
14 § 284. Accordingly, there is nothing clearly erroneous nor contrary to law about Magistrate Judge
15 Bencivengo’s order denying defendants’ motion to strike the timely and highly relevant expert
16 report, and the Court should not modify Magistrate Judge Bencivengo’s order to endorse defendants’
17 attempt to limit the damages Lucent and MPT are entitled to by law. Any continuing dispute about
18 the appropriateness of damages theories to be presented at trial—and there should be none—may be
19 properly addressed in pretrial filings.
20 V.

CONCLUSION

21

Magistrate Judge Bencivengo’s Order denying defendants’ motion to strike the supplemental

22 expert report of Roger Smith is neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.

Accordingly,

23 defendants’ motion for reversal of the Magistrate Judge’s ruling should be denied.
