TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT that, on a date and time to be set by the Court, in the
Courtroom of the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff of the United States District Court, located at 880
Front Street, San Diego, California 92101-8900, Defendants and Counterclaimants Gateway, Inc.,;
Gateway Country Stores LLC; Gateway Companies, Inc.; Gateway Manufacturing LLC; and
Cowabunga Enterprises, Inc. ("Gateway") will, and hereby do, move the Court, pursuant to Rule
72(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to review and modify the Magistrate Judge's Order
Following 11/1/07 Telephonic Discovery Conference (Doc. No. 40). The Magistrate Judge
ordered supplemental production of damages documents regarding Intuit Quicken and Microsoft
Money even though these products had already been excluded from the case pursuant to Judge
Brewster's prior ruling on a motion-in-limine. Gateway respectfully requests that this Court
modify the Magistrate Judge's order so as to exclude the obligation to produce supplemental
financial information regarding Intuit Quicken and Microsoft Money.

This motion is based on the following:

1. Gateway's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of its Motion Under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) For Review Of Magistrate Judge's Ruling Which Declined To Reach
Predicate Issue Of Admissibility Regarding Intuit Quicken And Microsoft Money;

2. The Declaration of Jonathan D. Baker in Support of Gateway's Motion Under Fed.
R. Civ. P. 72(a) For Review Of Magistrate Judge's Ruling Which Declined To Reach Predicate
Issue Of Admissibility Regarding Intuit Quicken And Microsoft Money, including Exhibits 1, 4-
8, 10, and 12-15 (filed with the declaration) and Exhibits 2-3, 9 and 11 (filed with the Notice of
Lodgment of Documents Submitted Under Seal);

3. The files and records in this action, and any and all other materials submitted to

the Court on or before the time of its decision in this matter.
