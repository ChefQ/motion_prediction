GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS’ COMBINED MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO
MOTIONS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FILED BY TEVA, APOTEX, AND MYLAN
INTRODUCTION
Intervenors and cross-claim plaintiffs Apotex Inc. (“Apotex”) and Teva Pharmaceuticals
USA, Inc. (“Teva”) contend that their abbreviated new drug applications (“ANDAs”) for
amlodipine besylate tablets (“amlodipine”) are entitled to immediate approval. Pfizer Inc.
(“Pfizer”) holds the new drug application (“NDA”) for amlodipine, which it markets under the
name Norvasc. The last of the patents that Pfizer asserted prevented competition from generic
versions of Norvasc, Patent No. 4,879,303 (“‘303 patent”), expired on March 25, 2007. Apotex
and Teva contend that their respective ANDAs became eligible for final approval at that time.

The only currently approved amlodipine ANDA was submitted by Mylan Laboratories, Inc. and
Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Mylan”). Both Mylan and Pfizer are currently marketing generic
versions of amlodipine. Mylan contends that no other ANDA can be approved at least until
September 19, 2007. Apotex also seeks an order requiring FDA to convert Mylan’s ANDA from
final approval to tentative approval status in order to require Mylan to withdraw its product from
the market.
Because of the complexity of the legal issues involved in the approval decisions regarding
the amlodipine ANDAs, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued a
request for comments on several issues, and established a docket for posting the comments on its
website. See Docket 2007P-0123,
http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0123/07n0123.htm. These issues included: the
effect of the opinion issued by the Federal Circuit on March 22, 2007, that the three claims in the
‘303 patent Pfizer asserted that Apotex infringed were invalid as obvious (Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex,
Inc., No. 2006-1261, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 6623 (Mar. 22, 2007) (hereinafter “Apotex
Opinion”)); whether ANDA approval was blocked by Pfizer’s “pediatric exclusivity,” an award
of six months of exclusivity beyond the expiration date of a patent for new drug manufacturers
who complete pediatric studies pursuant to a request from FDA; and whether ANDA approval
was blocked by “180-day marketing exclusivity,” an incentive for the first applicant for the
generic version of a new drug to challenge the innovator’s patent for that drug (here, the first
applicant is Mylan).
On April 18, 2007, after considering comments submitted by interested parties, FDA
issued an administrative decision that concluded as follows:

-2-

1. For purposes of pediatric exclusivity, the Apotex Opinion will not be effective until
issuance of the mandate; thus all pending ANDAs are currently blocked by Pfizer’s pediatric
exclusivity.
2. Apotex will cease to be subject to Pfizer’s exclusivity if the mandate issues before
September 25, 2007.
3. If the mandate issues before the expiration of pediatric exclusivity on September 25,
2007, ANDAs other than Apotex’s may not be eligible for immediate approval, but FDA cannot
resolve the issue on the record before the Agency.
4. Mylan’s eligibility for 180-day exclusivity does not extend beyond the expiration of
the patent.
FDA Letter Decision (Apr. 18, 2007) (submitted to the Court on April 18, 2007, and also
available at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0123/07n-0123-let0002-vol1.pdf)
(hereinafter “FDA Decision”). As a result of this decision, neither Apotex’s nor Teva’s ANDA
is eligible for immediate approval. However, FDA determined that Apotex’s ANDA would be
eligible if and when the mandate effectuating the Apotex opinion issues. FDA has not
determined whether Teva’s ANDA would be eligible for approval at that time.
Apotex and Teva now seek injunctive and declaratory relief that would overturn FDA’s
administrative decision and declare their respective ANDAs eligible for immediate approval.
Specifically, Apotex is challenging FDA’s decision on issue 1, but does not object to FDA’s
decisions on issues 2, 3, and 4. Teva is challenging FDA’s decisions on issues 1 and 3, but does
not object to FDA’s decisions on issues 2 and 4. Apotex also challenges an issue that was not
enumerated in FDA’s decisional letter but simply mentioned in a footnote. See FDA Decision at
5-6 n.4. This issue relates to whether Mylan’s ANDA should have lost its final approval status
based on a district court injunction in Mylan’s patent litigation with Pfizer, even though the
Federal Circuit stayed the district court injunction. FDA decided that, because of the stay, Mylan
did not lose its final, effective approval.

In the telephone conference with the Court’s clerk last week in which the briefing
schedule for these motions for injunction was established, Mylan did not indicate that it would be
filing its own motion for preliminary injunction this week. However, on April 23 Mylan also
filed a motion for preliminary injunction in which it objects to the FDA decisions on issues 2 and
4 (hereinafter “Mylan Mem.”). On April 24, Mylan submitted a supplemental memorandum in
support of an “amended” application for a preliminary injunction that includes additional
arguments and also objects to the FDA Decision on issue 3 (hereinafter “Mylan Supp. Mem.”).
The relief Mylan seeks is to enjoin approval of other ANDAs while the Court considers the
pediatric exclusivity and 180-day exclusivity issues. There is some obvious overlap, however,
between Mylan’s requested relief and arguments and those of Teva and Apotex, and FDA will
address Mylan’s arguments in this memorandum to the extent possible. Also, Mylan’s
arguments are thoroughly addressed in the FDA decision, and FDA hereby refers to and
incorporates that decision in rebuttal to Mylan’s arguments to the extent its arguments are not
addressed in this memorandum.
The issues in this case involve interpreting the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
(“FDCA”), the statute that Congress charged FDA with implementing, and balancing competing,
complex statutory provisions and policy questions within the agency’s expertise. FDA’s detailed
explanation demonstrates that it gave careful consideration to the relevant factors in reaching its
conclusion. Accordingly, the Court should defer to FDA’s conclusions on these issues and deny
the requested preliminary injunctions.

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
I.

New Drug Applications (“NDAs”)
FDA approves applications to market drugs under the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. § 355.1 Under

this provision, pharmaceutical companies seeking to market “pioneer” or “innovator” drugs must
first obtain FDA approval by filing an NDA containing extensive scientific data demonstrating
the safety and effectiveness of the drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(a), (b). An NDA applicant must also
submit information on any patent that claims the drug or a method of using the drug and for
which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted against an unauthorized party.
21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1), (c)(2). FDA publishes the patent information it receives in “Approved
Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the “Orange Book”). Id.; see also
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(7); 21 C.F.R. § 314.53(e).
II.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”)
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (known as the

“Hatch-Waxman Amendments”), codified at 21 U.S.C. §§ 355, 360cc, and 35 U.S.C. §§ 156,
271, 282, permits the submission of ANDAs for approval of generic versions of approved drug
products. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j). The ANDA process shortens the time and effort needed for

1

In December 2003, Congress amended certain provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 355. See The Access
to Affordable Pharmaceuticals provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-173, 117 Stat. 2066 (Dec. 8, 2003) (the “MMA”).
These amendments do not apply to many of the issues in this case because of the effective dates
of the amendments and the operative dates of the underlying facts. Accordingly, unless
otherwise noted, this memorandum refers to the pre-December 2003 version of the statute.
Indeed, the analysis provided in the FDA Decision was expressly limited to the pre-MMA
statute. FDA Decision at 1. Teva asserts that the pediatric exclusivity is governed by the
MMA’s application approval provisions. See Brief of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. In
Support of its Cross-Claim and Application for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Teva Mem.”)
at 7 n.1. However, the relevant pediatric exclusivity provisions predated the MMA.

approval by, among other things, allowing the applicant to demonstrate its product’s
bioequivalence to a drug already approved under an NDA (the “listed” drug) rather than having
to reproduce the safety and effectiveness data for that drug. Eli Lilly and Co. v. Medtronic, Inc.,
496 U.S. 661, 676 (1990). If an ANDA applicant establishes that its proposed drug product has
the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, route of administration, labeling, and
conditions of use as a listed drug, and that it is bioequivalent to that drug, the applicant can rely
on FDA’s previous finding that the listed drug is safe and effective. See id.2 The FDCA sets
forth in detail additional information that an ANDA must contain, and lists the numerous
deficiencies that may prevent or delay approval of an ANDA. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(j)(2),
355(j)(4).
A.

Patent Certifications

The timing of approval of ANDAs depends in part on patent protections for the pioneer
drug. An ANDA must contain one of four specified certifications for each patent that “claims the
listed drug” or “a use for such listed drug for which the applicant is seeking approval.” 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii). The certification must state one of the following:
(I) that the required patent information relating
to such patent has not been filed;
(II) that such patent has expired;
(III) that such patent will expire on a particular date; or
(IV) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed
by the drug for which approval is being sought.

2

Two drugs are considered bioequivalent if, in general, the rate and extent of absorption of the
proposed drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed
drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(8)(B).
-6-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 7 of 49

See id. If a certification is made under paragraph I or II indicating that patent information
pertaining to the drug or its use has not been filed with FDA or the patent has expired, then the
patent, by itself, will not delay approval of the ANDA. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(i). A
certification under paragraph III indicates that the ANDA applicant does not intend to market the
drug until after the applicable patent has expired, and FDA will not approve the ANDA until
after the patent has expired. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(ii).
If an applicant wishes to challenge a patent’s validity, or to claim that the patent would
not be infringed by the product proposed in the ANDA, the applicant must submit a paragraph IV
certification to FDA. The applicant must also provide notice of the paragraph IV certification to
the NDA holder and the patent owner and describe the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s
opinion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B). The filing of a
paragraph IV certification is an act of infringement. 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A). This enables the
NDA holder and patent owner to sue the ANDA applicant.
If the patent owner or NDA holder brings a patent infringement suit against the ANDA
applicant within 45 days after receiving notice of the paragraph IV certification, the suit triggers
an automatic stay of FDA approval for 30 months from the date the patent owner or NDA holder
received notice of the certification (“30-month stay”). 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). The 30month stay can be modified or lifted if the patent court reaches a decision before 30 months
expires or otherwise orders a longer or shorter stay period. Id. The statute provides that if the
district court decides in favor of the patent holder and the court of appeals reverses, approval
shall be made effective on “the date on which the court of appeals decides that the patent is

-7-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

invalid or not infringed.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(II)(aa)(AA).3 At the end of 30 months (or
such shorter or longer period as the court orders), FDA will approve the ANDA in spite of the
unexpired patent and ongoing litigation if the ANDA is otherwise ready for approval.
If the patent owner or NDA holder does not bring suit within 45 days after it has received
notice of the paragraph IV certification, the unexpired patent will not, by itself, bar FDA’s
approval of the ANDA, even if patent litigation is subsequently commenced and is ongoing at the
time the requirements for approval are met. In that circumstance, FDA may approve the ANDA
provided there are no other barriers to approval and the other conditions of approval are met. 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii); 21 C.F.R. § 314.107(f)(2).
FDA requires ANDA applicants to amend their patent certifications to reflect any
material changes in circumstances such as the expiration of a patent or the withdrawal of a patent
challenge. See 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(1). The regulation provides that “an applicant
shall amend a submitted certification if, at any time before the effective date of the approval of
the application, the applicant learns that the submitted certification is no longer accurate.” Id.;
see also 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(4)(K) (barring approval of application containing an untrue statement
of material fact). FDA has determined (and courts have upheld) that, upon patent expiration, an
ANDA applicant must change (and can be deemed to have changed) a paragraph III or IV
certification to a paragraph II certification to accurately conform the certification to the changed
circumstance. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. v. Thompson, 302 F. Supp. 2d 340 (D.N.J. 2003);

This provision was revised with the MMA. Under the effective dates of the various provisions,
the new version (quoted above) would be applicable to the amlodipine ANDAs (when the
circumstances provided for its application).

B.

180-Day Period Of Market Exclusivity

The FDCA provides an incentive and reward to generic drug manufacturers who expose
themselves to the risk of patent litigation. Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, an ANDA
applicant that is “first” to challenge a particular patent may enjoy a 180-day “exclusivity” period.
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). See Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. v. Crawford, 410 F.3d 51,
52 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1998). The
(pre-MMA) statutory provision governing 180-day exclusivity provides:
If the application contains a certification described in subclause (IV) of paragraph
(2)(A)(vii) and is for a drug for which a previous application has been submitted
under this subsection [containing] such a certification, the application shall be
made effective not earlier than one hundred and eighty days after(I) the date the Secretary receives notice from the applicant under the
previous application of the first commercial marketing of the drug under
the previous application, or
(II) the date of a decision of a court in an action described in clause (iii)
holding the patent which is the subject of the certification to be invalid or
not infringed,
whichever is earlier.
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). See also 21 C.F.R. §§ 314.107(c)(1) & (2).
Although this “exclusivity” provision is commonly characterized as granting 180-day
exclusivity to the first applicant to submit an ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification, the
statute does not provide for that result directly. Instead, this end is accomplished by delaying the
approval of subsequently filed ANDAs containing a paragraph IV certification until 180 days
after the exclusivity period for the first (“previous”) applicant has begun. During that time, the

-9-

first applicant can market its product, and approvals of other ANDAs that contain paragraph IV
certifications to the same patent are held in abeyance.
III.

Pediatric Exclusivity
A.

Origin and Purpose of Pediatric Exclusivity

The pediatric exclusivity statute, enacted in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug
Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) and renewed in 2002 in the Best Pharmaceuticals
for Children Act (BPCA), provides an economic incentive for drug manufacturers to invest the
resources necessary to conduct and submit pediatric studies of drugs. At the time of its initial
enactment, “less than 20 percent of the prescription medications on the United States market
[were] approved for use in the pediatric population and labeled for pediatric use,” often forcing
physicians to prescribe drugs that were developed for and tested on adults for use in children.
S. Rep. No. 105-43, at 51 (1997). Children may not metabolize drugs the same way adults do,
and drugs may have different side effects and higher levels of toxicity for children than for adults
– hence, the need for clinical drug trials involving children. Id.
Despite that need, drug manufacturers have had little incentive to conduct such studies for
several reasons. Drugs approved for use in children do not ordinarily generate significant
revenue. Further, pediatric studies “pose ethical and moral issues” not present in adult studies,
raise “substantial product liability and medical malpractice issues,” have difficulty attracting
subjects, and present special problems of “drug administration and patient compliance.” Id.
Although FDA had taken some regulatory steps to encourage pediatric labeling of drugs,
Congress determined that drug manufacturers needed a greater economic incentive to conduct
pediatric studies. It therefore enacted 21 U.S.C § 355a, granting pediatric exclusivity – an
additional six months of marketing exclusivity beyond the term of applicable patents and other
-10-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 11 of 49

marketing exclusivities – to drug manufacturers that conduct such pediatric studies at FDA’s
request. S. Rep. No. 105-43, at 52.
Under the pediatric exclusivity provision, when FDA determines that the use of an
already approved and marketed drug may produce health benefits in the pediatric population, it
may ask the drug’s manufacturer to conduct pediatric studies within a specified time frame. If
the studies are completed and the results are reported to FDA in accordance with certain
requirements, the statute imposes an additional six-month delay in the approval of any ANDA for
a generic version of the same drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2).4
The goals of pediatric exclusivity – obtaining pediatric labeling and usage information –
can be in conflict with the Hatch-Waxman Amendments’ goal of approving generic versions of
brand name drugs at the earliest possible time. Indeed, Congress recognized that awarding
pediatric exclusivity meant that some less expensive versions of generic products would reach
the market six months later than otherwise. S. Rep. No. 105-43, at 52, 73. See also H.R. Rep.
No. 107-277, at 28-29 (2001); S. Rep. No. 107-79, at 11 (2001).
B.

Mechanics of Pediatric Exclusivity

The statutory provisions governing the attachment of pediatric exclusivity take account of
the different patent certifications that an applicant may make as part of its ANDA submission.
The statute provides:

4

The pediatric exclusivity provision also delays the approval of applications submitted under 21
U.S.C. § 355(b)(2), in addition to ANDAs. No applicants submitting such applications have
intervened in this case, although one such applicant for a combination drug containing
amlodipine besylate submitted a comment to Docket 2007P-0123. Comment of Daiichi Sankyo,
Inc. (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0123/07n-0123-c000002-01-vol1.pdf).

(c) MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR ALREADY -MARKETED DRUGS.
If the Secretary determines that information relating to the use of an approved drug in
the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population and makes a
written request to the holder of an approved [NDA] for pediatric studies (which shall
include a timeframe for completing such studies), the holder agrees to the request, the
studies are completed within any such timeframe, and the reports thereof are submitted in
accordance with subsection (d)(2) of this section or accepted in accordance with
subsection (d)(3) of this section–
*

*

*

(2)(A) if the drug is the subject of–
(i) a listed patent for which a [paragraph II] certification has been
submitted . . . and for which pediatric studies were submitted prior to the
expiration of the patent (including any patent extensions); or
(ii) a listed patent for which a [paragraph III] certification has been
submitted . . .,
the period during which an [ANDA] may not be approved under . . . [21 U.S.C.
§] 355(j)(5)(B) shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the
patent expires (including any patent extensions); or
(B) if the drug is the subject of a listed patent for which a [paragraph IV]
certification has been submitted . . . , and in the patent infringement litigation
resulting from the certification the court determines that the patent is valid and
would be infringed, the period during which an [ANDA] may not be approved
under . . . [21 U.S.C. §] 355(j)(5)(B) shall be extended by a period of six months
after the date the patent expires (including any patent extensions).
21 U.S.C. § 355a(c).
Thus, by the terms of these provisions, pediatric exclusivity applies when there is a listed
patent to which unapproved ANDA have submitted patent certifications. If an ANDA contains a
paragraph II (the patent has expired) or paragraph III (the patent will expire on a specified date)
certification, and pediatric studies qualifying for exclusivity have been submitted prior to the
expiration of the patent, pediatric exclusivity will delay approval of the ANDA for six months
after the date the patent expires. 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A). If the ANDA contains a paragraph
IV certification (patent is invalid or will not be infringed), and the patent court determines that
-12-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 13 of 49

the patent is valid and infringed, “the period during which an [ANDA] may not be approved
under . . . [21 U.S.C. §] 355(j)(5)(B) shall be extended by a period of six months after the date
the patent expires (including any patent extensions).” 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B).
FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
The underlying material facts of this case are undisputed.
I.

Pfizer’s NDA for Norvasc
On July 31, 1992, FDA approved Pfizer’s NDA for amlodipine besylate tablets, a long-

acting calcium channel blocker, which Pfizer began marketing later that year under the brand
name Norvasc. Pfizer held two patents with respect to Norvasc: patent 4,572,909 (‘909 patent),
which expired on July 31, 2006, and the ‘303 patent, which expired on March 25, 2007.
FDA requested that Pfizer conduct pediatric studies on Norvasc and Pfizer did so in
accordance with FDA's written request; consequently, FDA granted Pfizer pediatric exclusivity
for Norvasc on November 27, 2001. Pediatric exclusivity, by delaying approval of ANDAs for
six months after the expiration date for a patent, had the potential to block approvals of ANDAs
until January 31, 2007, with respect to the ‘909 patent, and until September 25, 2007, with
respect to the ‘303 patent. On or about March 23, 2007, Pfizer launched its own generic version
of Norvasc. Pfizer Press Release (Mar. 23, 2007) (available at
http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/are/news_releases/index.jsp).
II.

Mylan’s ANDA for Amlodipine Besylate
In May 2002, Mylan filed an ANDA for amlodipine, and was the first to file a paragraph

IV certification to the ‘303 patent. See Comment of Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0123/07n-0123-emc0006-02.pdf) (“Mylan

Page 14 of 49

Mylan Labs., Inc., No. 02-cv-1628 (W.D. Pa.); see Am. Compl. ¶12. However, because Pfizer
did not file its lawsuit within 45 days of receiving notice of Mylan’s paragraph IV certification,
the filing of the lawsuit did not result in the 30-month stay of approval pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(iii).
In October 2005, FDA approved Mylan’s ANDA. Mylan Comment at 1; Am. Compl.
¶13. However, Mylan did not begin to market its product at that time.
In February 2007, the district court in the patent litigation between Mylan and Pfizer
entered judgment for Pfizer that Mylan had infringed the ‘303 patent. Pfizer, Inc. v. Mylan
Labs., Inc., No. 02-cv-1628, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14417 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 27, 2007). On March
16, 2007, the district court amended the judgment and enjoined the approval of Mylan’s ANDA
until the ‘303 patent expired. Id., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18699 (Mar. 16, 2007). Mylan
appealed that judgment and sought a stay of the district court’s injunction. On March 23, 2007,
the Federal Circuit granted the stay. Pfizer Inc. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., No. 2007-1194 (Mar. 23,
2007). Mylan began marketing its product on March 23, 2007. Mylan Comment at 1; Am.

Apotex’s ANDA for Amlodipine Besylate
Apotex (formerly Torpharm, Inc.) filed an ANDA for amlodipine besylate tablets, which

contained a paragraph IV certification to the ‘303 patent. On July 20, 2003, Pfizer sued Apotex
for patent infringement. In January 2006, the district court held the patent was valid and
infringed. Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc, No. 03C 5289, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95778 (N.D. Ill.
January 24, 2006). The Federal Circuit reversed in the opinion noted above, finding that
Apotex’s amlodipine besylate tablets did not infringe claims 1-3 of the ‘303 patent because those
claims were invalid for obviousness. See Apotex opinion. The Federal Circuit did not address

the validity of the remaining claims of the patent, presumably because those were not claims on
which Pfizer had sued Apotex. On April 5, 2007, Pfizer filed a motion in the Federal Circuit,
seeking a rehearing and/or rehearing en banc of the Apotex opinion. This motion stayed issuance
of the mandate pending its resolution under Rule 41(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure (“FRAP”). During a conference call with the Court’s chambers in the instant case on
April 19, 2007, counsel for Apotex reported that the Federal Circuit had directed Apotex to
respond by May 1, 2007, to Pfizer’s motion.

Teva’s ANDA for Amlodipine Besylate Tablets
Teva filed an ANDA for amlodipine besylate tablets on September 9, 2003. See

Comment of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
(http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0123/07n-0123-emc0007-02.pdf) (“Teva
Comment”) at 4. That ANDA contained paragraph III certifications to both of Pfizer’s patents.
Id. Following Apotex’s victory in the Federal Circuit on March 22, 2007, on March 23, 2007,
Teva changed its paragraph III certification to a paragraph IV certification for the ‘303 patent. Id.
Teva reported that it notified Pfizer of its paragraph IV certification, but Pfizer did not file suit
before the patent expired two days later. Id. On March 28, 2007, following the expiration of the
‘303 patent, Teva changed its certification to paragraph II. Id.5

FDA’s Administrative Determination
In the weeks before the ‘303 patent expired, decisions were issued in patent litigation

between various parties that had the potential to affect FDA’s amlodipine beslylate ANDA
approval decisions. First, because Mylan’s ANDA had been approved in October 2005, and
because the pediatric exclusivity statute delays approval only of unapproved ANDAs, Mylan was
not barred by pediatric exclusivity from marketing its product after its ANDA approval.
However, when Mylan lost its patent litigation in the district court, that court enjoined the
approval of Mylan’s ANDA until the ‘303 patent expired pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A).6
FDA had previously determined on similar facts that, based on the district court ruling in the
patent case enjoining the approval of an already approved ANDA, the ANDA should then be
converted to “tentatively approved” instead of “approved,” and pediatric exclusivity would attach
upon patent expiration. See Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 106 (D.D.C. 2004),
aff’d, 389 F.3d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (hereinafter “Mylan (fentanyl)”). However, before FDA
had taken an action to change the approval status of Mylan’s amlodipine besylate ANDA to
conform to the district court's order, the Federal Circuit stayed the district court injunction in the
patent litigation. After that stay, FDA believed it had no basis to convert the approval status of
Mylan’s ANDA from approved to tentatively approved. On March 23, the same day the stay was
entered, Mylan began marketing its product.

6

Under section 271(e)(4)(A), when an NDA holder or patent owner sues the ANDA applicant
and wins – that is, the court hearing the patent infringement litigation finds the patent valid and
infringed -- the Patent Code provides that “the court shall order the effective date of any approval
of the drug . . . involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the
expiration of .the patent which has been infringed.”

Page 17 of 49

Second, before March 22, 2007, FDA (and presumably all of the interested parties as
well) understood that Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity blocked the approval of all ANDAs other than
Mylan’s. The issuance of the Apotex opinion raised the question whether Apotex would still be
subject to pediatric exclusivity and, if not, whether the Apotex opinion also cleared the path for
some or all of the remaining ANDA applicants to obtain final, effective approval. These
determinations involved legal questions of first impression for the agency, as reflected by the
wide divergence in the legal theories and arguments presented to FDA in the comments.
In making its decision, FDA strove to give effect to the literal words of the relevant
statutory provisions in the context of the overall statutory scheme, to the policies behind the
provisions in question, and to applicable precedent. FDA decided that pediatric exclusivity does
not bar the approval of an ANDA when that applicant has prevailed in patent litigation against
the innovator. However, FDA also concluded that a court of appeals “determines” validity and
infringement when it issues the mandate, not when it issues the panel opinion. Here, the issuance
of the panel opinion on March 22 was not sufficient to remove pediatric exclusivity as a barrier
to approval of the ANDAs. Therefore, pediatric exclusivity continues to bar the approval of
ANDAs other than Mylan’s. If and when the mandate issues effectuating the panel opinion that
claims 1-3 of the patent are invalid, Apotex’s ANDA would not be barred by pediatric
exclusivity and could be immediately approved if otherwise eligible.
FDA next considered whether the other ANDAs would share the same benefit from the
issuance of the mandate effectuating the Apotex opinion. Although the other applicants did not
prevail in patent litigation against Pfizer, the commenters offered two theories as to why pediatric
exclusivity would no longer bar approval of some or all of the remaining ANDAs. First, some
maintained that, once the patent is declared invalid, it should be presumed delisted from the
-17-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 18 of 49

Orange Book. That would mean that no ANDA applicants would be required to maintain their
certifications to that patent, and pediatric exclusivity, by its literal terms, would not bar any
approvals. Second, Teva asserted that, once a patent is found invalid in litigation against one
ANDA applicant, the patent owner is collaterally estopped from asserting infringement claims
based on that patent against additional defendants. As a result, all applicants who submitted
paragraph IV certifications should be considered victorious in their individual patent litigation
against Pfizer. This would mean that ANDAs containing paragraph IV certifications at the time
of patent expiration would be eligible for approval, while those containing paragraph III
certifications would be blocked until the expiration of pediatric exclusivity.
FDA concluded, however, that it could not make the determination of the approvability of
the remaining ANDAs based on the record before it. Some commenters had asserted that,
because the Apotex opinion invalidated only part of the ‘303 patent, the remaining ANDAs
would still be subject to other claims of the patent. In contrast, one commenter asserted that,
under patent law, once the first three claims of the patent were found invalid, the remaining
claims applicable to the amlodipine besylate tablets were invalid as well. Many commenters did
not address the issue. FDA explained it is well established that FDA does not resolve patent
listing questions, and instead relies on the innovator to correctly list patents, and the courts to
resolve patent disputes. Accordingly, FDA had neither the information or the expertise to
resolve the question of the approvability of the remaining ANDAs, including Teva’s. FDA
stated: “in the absence of further judicial or other action clarifying the status of the patent, FDA
will assume the ‘303 patent remains validly listed.” FDA Decision at 10.
FDA further concluded that Mylan’s 180-day marketing exclusivity expired at the time
the ‘303 patent expired. This decision was based on the agency’s long-held and consistent
-18-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 19 of 49

understanding of the language of the statute. FDA explained in detail why it was unpersuaded by
Mylan’s arguments to the contrary.
ARGUMENT
Apotex, Teva, and Mylan have failed to establish the requirements for a preliminary
injunction. On the merits, the parties interested in the outcome of the amlodipine ANDA
approval issues presented to FDA numerous and diverse arguments as to how this complex
statutory scheme should be applied to these facts. On April 18, 2007, FDA issued a detailed
administrative decision that includes its interpretation of the ambiguous pediatric exclusivity
provisions in light of the language of the statute, statutory context and scheme, policies, and
precedent, and the application of the plain language of the 180-day exclusivity provision. FDA
had also determined, a few weeks earlier, that it would not change the approval status of Mylan’s
ANDA based on the clear application of applicable law and precedent to the facts here. Because
FDA has considered all of the relevant factors and reached reasonable conclusions, this Court
should defer to its decisions.
In addition, no party can establish irreparable harm. There are currently two generic
versions of amlodipine besylate tablets on the market, in addition to the brand name product.
The issues in this case relate to the timing of the entry of other generic versions to the market,
which in turn will presumably affect the size of each company’s market share. Although the
sales for this product are considerable, no movant has alleged that the existence of its company
depends on a favorable resolution of its motion. Also, the public interest favors denial of the
requested injunctions.
Accordingly, the Court should deny the motions for preliminary injunctions.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, the movants must each demonstrate that: (1) it

has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) it will suffer irreparable injury in the
absence of preliminary relief; (3) other interested parties will not be substantially injured if the
requested relief is granted; and (4) granting such relief would serve the public interest. E.g.,
Mova, 140 F.3d at 1066. The Court must balance the four factors in deciding whether to grant
the injunctive relief. Id. (citing CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738,
747 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).
A preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy” and is not to be granted lightly.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Shalala, 923 F. Supp. 212, 215 (D.D.C. 1996) (citing WMATC v.
Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). Moreover, the ultimate relief that
Apotex and Teva seek – orders compelling FDA to approve their respective ANDAs – is a
“mandatory injunction” that must be reviewed “with even greater circumspection.” Mylan
Pharm., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 36 (D.D.C. 2000). Because the movants have failed
to meet the stringent standards for such extraordinary relief, their motions for preliminary
injunctions should be denied.
II.

THE MOVANTS HAVE NO LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS
A.

FDA’s Administrative Determinations Are Entitled to Deference

FDA’s actions in this case are subject to review by the Court under the Administrative
Procedure Act (“APA”), and may be disturbed only if “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). This standard is
highly deferential to the agency. See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S.
402, 416 (1971). Indeed, “[t]here is a presumption in favor of the validity of the administrative

action.” Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 923 F. Supp. at 216; see also Watson Pharms. v. Henney,
194 F. Supp. 2d 442, 445 (D. Md. 2001). The reviewing court must consider whether the
agency’s decision was based upon a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has
been a clear error of judgment. Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416. However, “under this narrow
scope of review, ‘the court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.’”
Bristol-Myers, 923 F. Supp. at 216 (quoting Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416).
When the Court is reviewing an agency’s construction of statutory provisions, it is
governed by the two-step analysis of Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,
467 U.S. 837 (1984). First, the Court must inquire “whether Congress has directly spoken to the
precise question at issue;” if Congress’s intent is clear, the Court “must give effect to [such]
unambiguously expressed intent.” Id. at 842-43. Formulated another way, the Court must
initially decide “whether the statute unambiguously forbids the Agency’s interpretation.”
Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 218 (2002). Second, if Congress has not “directly” addressed
“the precise question at issue,” the Court may not “impose its own construction on the statute.”
Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843. Rather, it must determine if the agency’s interpretation is based on “a
permissible construction of the statute.” Id.
Chevron deference applies when, as here, “Congress delegated authority to the agency
generally to make rules carrying the force of law.” Gonzales v. Oregon, 126 S. Ct. 904 (2006)
(quoting United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001)). “Delegation of such
authority may be shown in a variety of ways.” Mead Corp., 533 U.S. at 227. With the FDCA,
Congress has authorized and directed FDA to decide what drugs may lawfully enter the
marketplace, and when and how they may enter. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(c), 355(d), 355(e),
355(f), 355(j), 355a. Further, the Supreme Court has explained that Chevron deference is
-21-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 22 of 49

appropriate when “the interstitial nature of the legal question, the related expertise of the Agency,
the importance of the question to administration of the statute, the complexity of that
administration, and the careful consideration the Agency has given the question over a long
period of time all indicate that Chevron provides the appropriate legal lens through which to
view the legality of the Agency interpretation here at issue.” Barnhart, 535 U.S. at 222. Thus,
deference is appropriate in the drug approval context because of “the complexity of the statutory
regime” and “FDA’s expertise.” Mylan v. Thompson, 389 F.3d at 1280.
Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit has repeatedly given Chevron deference to FDA’s
interpretation of the FDCA, as well as the agency’s own implementing regulations. See, e.g.,
Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. v. Leavitt, 435 F.3d 344, 349 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“We have held
on a number of occasions that FDA interpretations of the FDCA receive deference, as do its
interpretations of its own regulations unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulations.”); Mylan v. Thompson, 389 F.3d at 1281; Purepac Pharm. Co. v. Thompson, 354
F.3d 877, 883 (D.C. Cir. 2004); Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1319, 1320 (D.C.
Cir. 1998) (citing Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997)).7 Furthermore, Chevron deference
extends to administrative determinations that are not embodied in rulemaking or formal
adjudication, including, as in this case, a decision letter setting forth the agency’s statutory
constructions of provisions of the FDCA. See Mylan (fentanyl), 389 F.3d at 1279-80; Apotex,
Inc. v. FDA, No. 06-5060, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 4270 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 23, 2007) (“the district

authority is a ‘highly detailed’ regulatory program to which the agency has brought its
‘specialized expertise,’ . . . a characterization that aptly describes the FDA’s role in the context of
the regulatory scheme created pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act.”) (quoting Mead, 533 U.S. at

judge’s opinion, which grants Chevron deference to the FDA’s statutory interpretation of 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) embodied in FDA approval letters (i.e., informal adjudications), is
supported by the Supreme Court’s post-Mead decision in Barnhart, 535 U.S. [at 222], as well as
our own decision in Mylan [(fentanyl), 389 F.3d at 1279-80]”).
B.

FDA Properly Concluded that, for Purposes of Pediatric Exclusivity, the
Court of Appeals “Determines” Patent Invalidity When It Issues the
Mandate

The first step in determining whether the unapproved ANDAs are barred by pediatric
exclusivity required FDA to construe the provision of the pediatric exclusivity statute that related
to applicants that file paragraph IV certifications to the listed patent. That section provides that
when the ANDA applicant, such as Apotex, submits a paragraph IV certification,
if . . . in the patent infringement litigation resulting from the certification the
court determines that the patent is valid and would be infringed, the period during
which an application may not be approved . . . shall be extended by a period of six
months after the date the patent expires . . . .
See 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B). FDA concluded in its letter that Congress also intended the
converse of the literal language of this provision: that pediatric exclusivity does not apply when
the ANDA applicant prevails in its patent challenge – i.e., when the court determines that the
patent is invalid or would not be infringed, and that construction has been acknowledged as
appropriate by a court. See FDA Decision at 6; Mylan (fentanyl), 332 F. Supp. 2d at 124 (“As
the FDA has correctly noted in its papers, § 355a(c)(2)(B) would apply ‘where an ANDA
applicant submits a paragraph IV certification, and prevails in the patent litigation.’”) (dicta,
citing Federal Defendants’ Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary
Injunction and Summary Judgment and In Support of Cross Motion for Summary Judgment at 38
(July 8, 2004)).

-23-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 24 of 49

In applying that provision to these facts, the parties disagree over whether the phrase “the
court determines” means the court’s issuance of the panel opinion or issuance of the mandate.
FDA concluded that the plain language does not compel either interpretation. Congress could
have been more precise, as it has been in other statutory provisions, in indicating exactly which
event was operative. Compare, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 7481(a) (finality is determined “upon mandate”
issued by Court of Appeals or Supreme Court) with 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(I)(aa)-(bb)
(approval “shall be made effective on the date on which the court enters judgment reflecting the
decision; or the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court
stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed.”). The
word “determine” by itself is subject to several different meanings. See FDA Decision at 6.
Nevertheless, in context, FDA concluded that the better reading was that the court
“determines” the validity of the patent when the mandate issues. As FDA explained in its
decision, in terms of the statutory scheme, when the district court decides a patent issue, FDA
applies that decision, unless it is stayed, in determining issues related to ANDA approval. Id. at
6. The district court decision continues to control the rights of the parties until the appellate
court mandate issues. Thus, the vital date under this scheme is when the rights of the parties
become fixed by the decision of the court of appeals, that is, the date the mandate issues. This
understanding of the phrase “the court determines” is further supported by the more prevalent
dictionary definitions of “determine.” See id. at 6.
In addition, the 1998 advisory committee notes to FRAP 41(c) state that “[a] court of
appeals judgment or order is not final until issuance of the mandate; at that time the parties’
obligations become fixed.” These notes have been cited with approval by courts, Mercer v. Duke
Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 212 n.7 (4th Cir. 2005); Stewart Park & Reserve Coalition Inc. v. Slater,

374 F. Supp. 2d 243, 248 n.5 (N.D.N.Y. 2005); United States v. Swan, 327 F. Supp. 2d 1068,
1071-72 (D. Neb. 2004). See also Flagship Marine Services, Inc. v. Belcher Towing Co., 23
F.3d 341, 342-43 (11th Cir. 1994) (“Until the mandate issues, an appellate judgment is not final;
the decision reached in the opinion may be revised by the panel, or reconsidered by the en banc
court, or certiorari may be granted by the Supreme Court.”); Bryant v. Ford Motor Co., 886 F.2d
1526, 1530-31 (9th Cir. 1989) (“where the mandate has not issued the availability of appeal has
not yet been exhausted”); Mary Ann Pensiero, Inc. v. Lingle, 847 F.2d 90, 97 (3d Cir. 1988).
Furthermore, as a matter of policy, FDA believes that the parties to paragraph IV litigation are
best served by a rule that, consistent with the statutory language, errs on the side of greater
finality. Such a rule reduces the possibility that an appellate court opinion will be relied on and
then overturned (through an adverse opinion after rehearing or rehearing en banc) in very short
order.
1.

Apotex and Teva Incorrectly Assert that FDA’s Interpretation is
Contrary to the Plain Meaning of the Statute

Apotex and Teva assert that the phrase “the court determines” is unambiguous and means
the issuance of the panel opinion or the entry of the judgment on the docket. Apotex’s
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction
(“Apotex Mem.”) at 4-5; Teva Mem. at 22-25. Teva argues that lawyers frequently refer to
opinions as making determinations. Therefore, Teva asserts, the ordinary usage of the word
“determine” is most consistent with a court of appeals opinion being legally effective when
issued. Teva Mem. at 22-23. There are at least two logical flaws in Teva’s argument. First,
because a court’s reasoning is contained in its opinion, most ordinary references to the substance
of a court decision will be to that opinion. But most such references will be outside the context

-25-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 26 of 49

of the timing of the effectiveness of the opinion on the rights of the parties. There is no need in
other contexts for layman, lawyers, and judges to qualify their word choice with precision to as to
the legal effectiveness question here. These routine references cannot be presumed to
demonstrate that the speakers understand that, in using the word “determine,” they are asserting
that an opinion is legally effective when issued. Second, Teva’s proposed ordinary meaning does
not foreclose the existence of other ordinary meanings. Although Teva accuses FDA of “handpicking” definitions, FDA’s decisional letter set forth the first four definitions it found in the
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (2002). Of these definitions, one supports Teva’s
definition and other three support FDA’s ultimate conclusion. FDA Decision at 6. Accordingly,
FDA correctly found that the words of the statute are ambiguous.
Apotex does not argue that the language by itself is subject to only one meaning. Instead,
it argues essentially that “determine” is synonymous with the entry of the judgment on the
docket, which under Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (“FRAP”) immediately
follows the issuance of the opinion. Apotex Mem. at 5-6. However, FDA concluded in its
administrative decision that the language of the rules themselves does not compel the conclusion
that Apotex advocates. FRAP 36 states that a judgment is entered when it is noted on the docket,
while FRAP 41(c) states that the mandate is effective when issued. Neither rule spells out the
intended legal effect of either event. Moreover, as noted above, the advisory committee notes to
Rule 41(c) provide a clear indication of what the drafters intended these rules to mean, and that
authority undermines the meaning that Apotex ascribes to the rules. FDA Decision at 6-7.8

8

The advisory committee notes to FRAP 41(d), which Apotex quotes in part as support for it
argument, Apotex Mem. at 8, when read in context further support FDA’s understanding that the
rights of the parties are not fixed until the mandate issues.
-26-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 27 of 49

Apotex further argues that because Supreme Court rules provide that the time for
challenging an appellate decision runs from the date the judgment is entered, the judgment is
final. Id. Apotex’s argument puts form over substance, however. The procedural mechanisms
are far less significant than the event that determines when the obligations of the parties become
fixed, that is, the issuance of the mandate. Indeed, the Supreme Court case that Apotex cites to
support its argument actually supports FDA’s analysis. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 98
(2004) (“‘while [a] petition for rehearing is pending,’ or while the court is considering, on its
own initiative, whether rehearing should be ordered, ‘there is no “judgment” to be reviewed,’”
quoting in part Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 46 (1990)).
Teva and Apotex argue that Congress could have simply used the word “mandate” in the
statute or otherwise indicated it intended finality. Apotex at 9; Teva at 24-25. That argument
begs the question, however, because Congress equally could have been more precise if it wanted
the issuance of the appellate court opinion to be the operative date. See FDA Decision at 7
(“Compare, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 7481(a) (finality is determined “upon mandate” issued by Court of
Appeals or Supreme Court), with 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(I)(aa)-(bb) (approval “shall be
made effective on the date on which the court enters judgment reflecting the decision; or the date
of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that
is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed.”). Apotex and Teva also both make
arguments based on other provisions of FDCA, the language of those statutes, and FDA’s
interpretive history. Apotex Mem. at 7-8; Teva Mem. at 24-25. None of those instances
however, involved either the language (“the court determines”) or the context (pediatric
exclusivity) presented by this matter.

-27-

In sum, none of Apotex’s or Teva’s arguments establish that Congressional intent is
evident from the plain meaning of the phrase “the court determined” as used in section
355a(c)(2)(B).
2.

FDA Reasonably Balanced the Competing Policy Considerations in
Making Its Determination

Apotex and Teva further assert that FDA’s decision is inconsistent with the policies
behind the statutory provisions in question. Apotex 9-10; Teva at 28-30. Apotex contends that
FDA’s interpretation is contrary to the central purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of
getting generic drugs to consumers as soon as possible. Apotex at 10. Teva likewise asserts that
the “paramount congressional objective” is approving generic drugs quickly. Teva at 29. But
these arguments fail to take into account the competing objective of the pediatric exclusivity
provision – to reward manufacturers for conducting pediatric studies.
Congress enacted the pediatric exclusivity provisions after the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments. In doing so, Congress was well aware that this step would mean that some less
expensive generic products will reach the market six months later than without pediatric
exclusivity. S. Rep. No. 105-43 at 52, 73. See also H.R. Rep. No. 107-277, at 28-29 (2001);
S. Rep. No. 107-79, at 11 (2001). Congress balanced the competing interests at stake and made a
deliberate policy choice: by creating a period of pediatric exclusivity, it gave precedence to the
goal of obtaining pediatric labeling and usage information for drugs over the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments’ goal of approving generic versions of brand name drugs at the earliest possible
time. Moreover, because of the progress made in encouraging research on the use of drugs in the
pediatric population since the enactment of the pediatric exclusivity provision, see Department of
Health & Human Servs., The Pediatric Exclusivity Provision: January 2001 Status Report to

FDA also stated that it believed that “the parties to paragraph IV litigation are best served
by a rule that, consistent with the statutory language, errs on the side of greater finality.” FDA
Decision at 7. This rule “reduces the possibility that an appellate court opinion will be relied on
and then overturned (through an adverse opinion after rehearing or rehearing in banc) in very
short order.” Id. Teva and Apotex both argue that FDA’s decision subverts congressional policy
by putting the finality of the Federal Circuit opinion in the control of the patent holder, whose
interests may lie in delaying the conclusion of the litigation. Apotex Mem. at 9-10; Teva Mem.
at 29-30. Ultimately, however, control over the timing of the issuance of the mandate remains
with the court: for example, the court may lift the stay of the mandate or shorten time for its
issuance. See FRAP 41(b) & 41(d)(1). In addition, the mandate is not automatically stayed
pending the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari, but such a stay must be sought by motion.
FRAP 41(d)(2). Significantly, both Teva and Apotex note the rarity of en banc review and
certiorari. Teva Mem. at 27-28 & n.5; Apotex Mem. at 10 & n.2. Thus, the extreme delays
posited by Teva and Apotex do not seem realistic. In these circumstances, FDA’s decision to
seek “greater finality” is a reasonable one.

FDA Properly Concluded That Pediatric Exclusivity is Not Limited to
Situations Where the NDA Holder Prevails in Patent Litigation Before the
Patent Expires

Teva, in its main argument before this Court, ignores applicable precedent and asserts that
the plain language of the statute leads to a conclusion that has already been rejected by FDA, this
Court, and the D.C. Circuit. Specifically, Teva asserts that pediatric exclusivity cannot apply to
any applicant that files a paragraph IV certification when the NDA holder does not prevail in the
patent litigation before patent expiration: “The statute’s plain text puts the onus on the brand
manufacturer to win its lawsuit in order to earn pediatric exclusivity.” Teva Mem. at 16. FDA
has rejected this position, and FDA’s position was affirmed in the Ranbaxy litigation.
In Ranbaxy, Ranbaxy filed ANDAs to manufacture generic fluconazole and submitted
paragraph IV certifications. It was sued by the patent holder, Pfizer; however, the patent
litigation was not resolved before expiration of the patent. Meanwhile, FDA had requested
pediatric studies from Pfizer, Pfizer complied, and FDA decided it was entitled to such
exclusivity. Ranbaxy argued (just as Teva argues here), that Pfizer was not entitled to pediatric
exclusivity under 355a(c)(2)(B) “unless Pfizer obtained a ruling that the ‘216 patent was valid
and would be infringed.” 307 F. Supp. 2d at 18; see also id. at 19 (“Under [355a(c)(2)(B)],
Ranbaxy argues, the only circumstance in which the pediatric exclusivity protections delay an
ANDA holder’s entry into the market is when the court in the underlying patent infringement
litigation has determined that the patent was valid and would be infringed. Here, there was no
such determination . . . ”). This Court flatly rejected this argument, and upheld FDA’s decision
that Ranbaxy’s paragraph IV certification became a paragraph II certification upon expiration of

-30-

the patent because the patent litigation was not resolved when the patent expired. Id. at 20-21.
As noted above, the D.C. Circuit affirmed.
As explained in the administrative decision in this case, in determining the application of
pediatric exclusivity in such circumstances, FDA relies on the broader certification scheme under
Hatch-Waxman. FDA Decision at 8. “It has been FDA’s longstanding view, that, when a patent
expires before pending patent litigation is resolved, ANDA applicants who have not received
final effective approval are required under Hatch-Waxman, to change their paragraph III and
paragraph IV certifications to paragraph II certifications. Because, upon patent expiry, all ANDA
applicants are presumed to have paragraph II certifications, the paragraph II provision of the
pediatric exclusivity statute, 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i), would control.” That means that,
when the patent expires before the paragraph IV infringement litigation is resolved, paragraph IV
certifications switch to paragraph II certifications, subsection 355a(c)(2)(A)(i) controls, and
pediatric exclusivity applies. This approach, as noted above, has been affirmed in this Circuit.
That decision conclusively rejects Teva’s interpretation that section 355a(c)(2)(B) bars the
application of pediatric exclusivity in all circumstances unless the innovator prevails in patent
litigation.
Teva argues that FDA has taken inconsistent positions in the past. Teva Mem. at 21.
Teva argues: “Because the plain text of the statute explicitly requires the brand manufacturer to
prevail in post-paragraph IV litigation in order to obtain eligibility for pediatric exclusivity, FDA
routinely grants [paragraph IV ANDA] applicants final approval where the brand manufacturer
does not initiate suit at all.” Id. All of the instances cited by Teva, however, involved approval
of an ANDA before the last patent expired and before pediatric exclusivity attached to prevent
approval (and there was no patent litigation or 30-month stay that precluded approval). Contrary
-31-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 32 of 49

to Teva’s assertion, the ANDAs were not approved because the statute “requires the brand
manufacturer to prevail” in patent litigation. FDA has consistently held that if an ANDA is
eligible for final effective approval before the patent expires – as in the instant case with Mylan’s
amlodipine ANDA – it may be approved even if the innovator has been granted pediatric
exclusivity because pediatric exclusivity only blocks approval of ANDAs that remain
unapproved at the time of patent expiration. The examples Teva cites involved such
circumstances and do not conflict with the analysis in the FDA decision.
The Ranbaxy precedent, however, did not fully resolve the question presented here; i.e.,
when the Federal Circuit issued a panel decision concluding that three claims of the patent were
invalid but the mandate has not yet issued. In its decision, FDA explained:
The statute provides that, where the ANDA applicant submits paragraph IV
certification, “if . . . in the patent litigation resulting from the certification the
court determines that the patent is valid and would be infringed, the period during
which an application may not be approved . . . shall be extended by a period of six
months after the date the patent expires . . . .” See 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B).
Based on this language, FDA determines that the converse must also be true - if in
paragraph IV litigation a court determines that a patent is invalid or not infringed,
pediatric exclusivity will not bar approval of that applicant’s ANDA. This is the
implicit meaning and logical interpretation of subsection 355a(c)(2)(B). . . .
FDA Decision at 8. Thus, FDA concluded that, when the ‘303 patent expired on March 25,
2007, all of the certifications to that patent contained in the unapproved ANDAs were required to
change (or deemed to have changed) to paragraph II certifications and became subject to Pfizer’s
pediatric exclusivity at that time. Id. at 9. That conclusion follows from the analysis applied and
upheld in the Ranbaxy case discussed above.
However, because the language of subsection 355a(c)(2)(B) “manifests a clear
Congressional intent that pediatric exclusivity not block the approval of an ANDA where the
ANDA applicant has prevailed in the paragraph IV patent litigation,” that provision “creates an
-32-

exception to the application of the Hatch-Waxman certification provisions.” Id. Therefore, FDA
concluded that, if and when the mandate effectuating the panel’s March 22 decision issues in the
Apotex case, Apotex’s ANDA will not be blocked by Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity because it will
have prevailed in the patent infringement litigation. Id. at 8-9. The reasoning for this exception
renders irrelevant Mylan’s argument that Apotex should automatically be converted to a
paragraph II because of past FDA policy and the rulings in Ranbaxy and Mylan (fentanyl).
Mylan Mem. at 5-11; Mylan Supp. Mem. at 5-6. This FDA conclusion is not a departure from
past practice, but the interpretation and application of law to a new situation not previously
presented to FDA, i.e., a situation in which the patent expires after a paragraph IV ANDA
receives a favorable panel decision from the Federal Circuit in patent litigation but before the
mandate issues. See FDA decision at 1 (noting some of the issues involved in this matter “of
first impression for the agency.”). The prior cases cited by the parties do not address this issue.
FDA’s reasoning, as discussed above, reflects an appropriate interpretation of the statute and the
“clear Congressional intent that pediatric exclusivity not block the approval of an ANDA where
the ANDA applicant has prevailed. . . .” FDA Decision at 9. This conclusion is reasonable and
compels rejection of Mylan’s assertions.
D.

FDA Properly Concluded That It Cannot Determine the Approvabilty of the
Remaining ANDAs at this Time

FDA properly concluded that it could not determine, on the record then before the
agency, whether the issuance of mandate would lift the pediatric exclusivity barrier to approval
of the other ANDAs, including Teva’s ANDA, because of conflicting information as to whether
all of the claims of the ‘303 patent would be invalid, after issuance of the mandate, with respect
to the other ANDAs. Patents are required to be listed in FDA’s Orange Book if they claim the

-33-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Page 34 of 49

approved drug substance, approved drug product, or an approved method of use. 21 U.S.C.
§ 355(b)(1); 21 C.F.R. § 314.53. If one or more of the remaining claims of the patent claims the
approved drug substance, approved drug product, or approved method of use, the patent can
remain properly listed until the expiration of pediatric exclusivity. In such a case, the patent
should remain in the Orange Book and the remaining unapproved ANDAs are potentially subject
to Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity.
Here, the Apotex opinion invalidated three claims of the patent. The commenters
provided conflicting information as to whether the remaining claims of the ‘303 patent would
provide a valid basis to list the patent if claims 1-3 are invalid. Several commenters maintained
that the other claims presumptively remained valid because they had not been declared invalid.
One commenter asserted that, as a matter of patent law, the remaining claims were invalid as
well.
FDA has long maintained that its has neither the expertise nor the resources to resolve
patent issues and does not make independent determinations of the merits or applicability of
patent claims. 59 Fed. Reg. 50338, 50342-43, 50345, 50349, 50352 (1994). FDA’s ministerial
role in the listing process has been upheld. Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347 F.3d at 1348-49;
aaiPharma, Inc. v. Thompson, 296 F.3d 227, 243 (4th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 923
(2003); Alphapharm Pty Ltd. v. Thompson, 330 F. Supp 2d 1, 7-8 (D.D.C. 2004). Thus, FDA
properly concluded that it lacked both relevant information and expertise to resolve this issue.
However, FDA did not foreclose the possibility that other information may come to light that
would allow FDA to conclude that the patent is invalid: FDA stated that “in the absence of
further judicial or other action clarifying the status of the patent, FDA will assume the ‘303
patent remains validly listed.” FDA Decision at 10 (emphasis added).
-34-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Page 35 of 49

FDA also indicated in its administrative decision its view as to what effect a finding of
complete patent invalidity would have on the remaining ANDAs. As FDA noted in its letter and
above, the commenters offered different views on this question. Some maintained that, once the
patent is declared invalid, it should be presumed delisted from the Orange Book, and pediatric
exclusivity would cease to block the approval of any ANDA. In its administrative decision,
FDA generally endorsed this approach:
If the remaining claims do not provide a basis on which to list the patent (i.e., do
not claim the approved drug substance, drug product, or an approved method of
use), the patent would no longer be eligible for listing in the Orange Book. In
such a case, the patent must be withdrawn by Pfizer and any pediatric exclusivity
that attached to the patent will no longer serve as a barrier to ANDA approval.
FDA Decision at 9.
In contrast, Teva asserted (and continues to assert) that, once a patent is found invalid in
litigation against one party, the patent owner is collaterally estopped from asserting infringement
claims based on that patent against additional defendants. See Teva Mem. at 19-20 (citing
Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. University of Ill. Found., 402 U.S. 313, 350 (1971)). Teva argues
that, applying collateral estoppel, all applicants who submitted paragraph IV certifications should
be considered victorious in their individual patent litigation against Pfizer. As a result, ANDAs
containing paragraph IV certifications at the time of patent expiration would be eligible for
approval, while those containing paragraph III certifications would be blocked. See Teva
Comments at 11-13. Thus, the difference in the result of the two approaches is that the first
would make all ANDAs eligible for approval while Teva’s approach would allow only those
ANDAs that contained paragraph IV certifications at the time of patent expiration to be
approved.

-35-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 36 of 49

There are several reasons why Teva’s theory should be rejected. First, the application of
the doctrine of collateral estoppel requires, among other things, that the issue be identical with
that presented in the prior adjudication. Blonder-Tongue Labs., 402 U.S. at 323. That
requirement is in question here, because it is possible that more than the three claims found to be
invalid in the Apotex opinion may apply to other ANDAs. Given the possibility of the nonidentity of issues from one patent litigation to another, and FDA’s lack of expertise on patent
law, that is not a decision for FDA to make. Teva has failed to articulate a mechanism for
presuming all paragraph IV litigants victorious in their patent litigations.
Second, even if Teva’s approach were legally sound, it does not invalidate the patent
delisting approach suggested by the other commenters and endorsed by FDA. Teva has failed to
explain – once the entire patent is found to be invalid as to any ANDA – how it can continue to
remain listed and bar the approval of any ANDA, including those that contained paragraph III
certification at the time the patent expired. Accordingly, even if Teva were correct that Pfizer is
collaterally estopped from asserting infringement against Teva, that would not prevent the
approval of an ANDA application that had contained a paragraph III certification at the time of
patent expiration once the patent is delisted.
Third, Teva’s interpretation would permit gamesmanship on the part of ANDA applicants
that would undermine the purposes of the statutory provisions in question. In the Ranbaxy case
discussed above, Ranbaxy argued that Pfizer was not entitled to pediatric exclusivity because
Ranbaxy had a paragraph IV certification and Pfizer had not won its patent infringement case
before patent expiration. FDA rejected this argument, and noted the type of shenanigans that
Ranbaxy’s position would allow:

-36-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 37 of 49

Ranbaxy’s interpretation opens the door to the potential evisceration of pediatric
exclusivity. Ranbaxy’s interpretation would provide a perverse incentive for
generic applicant[] companies to change their paragraph III certifications to
paragraph IV certifications shortly before patent expiry, and to otherwise delay
filing paragraph IV certifications until the latest possible time. This tactic would
permit ANDA applicants to circumvent pediatric exclusivity in almost every case
by filing a paragraph IV certification with insufficient time to conclude the
litigation. It would reward ANDA applicants who have done little more than
challenge a listed patent that was otherwise due to expire shortly, at the expense of
NDA holders who have incurred the expense and risk of performing the pediatric
studies that the statute was designed to elicit, and at the expense of other ANDA
applicants who filed their paragraph IV certifications with enough time to litigate
their patent challenges to conclusion.
Ranbaxy (fluconazole) letter, Jan. 28, 2004, at 6, Attachment A hereto.
That is also the case here. Teva switched its paragraph III certification to a paragraph IV
certification on March 23, 2007, with two days remaining on the patent – after the Federal Circuit
had ruled against the validity of the patent – and now seeks to be rewarded for having
“challenged” the patent. This conduct curtails Pfizer’s opportunity to defend its pediatric
exclusivity. Moreover, Teva’s theory would reward it for simply filing a changed certification
knowing it would face no risk or expense of defending patent litigation. That is not the kind of
incentive that Congress intended. There is no reason Teva should have an advantage here over
the other ANDA applicants who maintained paragraph III certifications during the pre-patent
expiration pendency of their ANDAs simply because it switched to a paragraph IV certification
two days before the patent expired.
E.

Mylan’s ANDA Approval Remains Effective

Apotex argues that Mylan is not properly on the market because it lost its patent litigation
in district court and that district court decision “converted Mylan’s final approval to a tentative
approval by operation of law.” Apotex Mem. at 14. In support of this position, Apotex cites the
Mylan (fentanyl) case. In Mylan (fentanyl), as in the instant case, Mylan received final approval
-37-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 52

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 38 of 49

of its ANDA prior to expiration of the relevant patent. Subsequently, however, a district court
ruled against Mylan in its patent litigation, and ordered the effective date of Mylan’s fentanyl
approval be deferred until expiration of the patent. 389 F.3d at 1277. FDA concluded that this
decision required FDA to convert Mylan’s final approval into a tentative approval and that, upon
expiration of the patent, Mylan’s paragraph IV certification would have to be changed to a
paragraph II (indicating that the patent had expired). Id. at 1277-78. Meanwhile, FDA had
approved pediatric exclusivity for the innovator company, ALZA, and concluded that Mylan’s
ANDA was subject to ALZA’s pediatric exclusivity because it had a paragraph II certification
upon expiration of the patent. Id. at 1277-78. These decisions were upheld by this Court and by
the D.C. Circuit. See id. at 1281-84.
The distinction between Mylan (fentanyl) and the instant case is that here, before FDA
acted on the injunction issued by the district court in the amlodipine patent litigation, Mylan
received a stay of the district court’s decision from the Federal Circuit. Pfizer Inc. v. Mylan
Labs., Inc., No. 2007-1194 (Mar. 23, 2007). After that stay, FDA had no basis to convert the
approval status of Mylan’s ANDA from approved to tentatively approved. As noted, FDA does
not make independent assessments of patent validity; the basis for changing the approval status
of the Mylan ANDA in Mylan (fentanyl) was the (unstayed) district court injunction.
In fact, this issue was the basis for the other amlodipine lawsuit filed by Mylan in this
Court on March 23, 2007. Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Leavitt, et al., Civ. No. 07-0571 (RMU).
Initially, FDA had informed Mylan that its final approval for amlodipine would be converted to a
tentative approval based on the Pennsylvania district court injunction, and Mylan sought to
enjoin FDA from this action. When the Federal Circuit stayed the district court injunction, FDA
informed Mylan and this Court’s clerk on March 23 that FDA would not change Mylan’s final
-38-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Page 39 of 49

approval to a tentative approval unless there was a supervening order of a court. Because no
supervening order issued, the lawsuit became moot.
Although Apotex argues that Mylan’s final approval was converted to a tentative
approval “by operation of law” and without any FDA action, Apotex Mem. at 14, FDA has never
taken that position. Indeed, Apotex also seems to recognize that some action by FDA is
required: “In [Mylan (fentanyl)], FDA converted Mylan’s final approval to a tentative approval
following Mylan’s loss in patent litigation.” Apotex Mem. at 15 (emphasis added). Similarly, in
Mylan (fentanyl) the D.C. Circuit noted that some action was required by FDA to convert a final
approval to a tentative approval: “Mylan contends that FDA lacked authority to revoke Mylan’s
final ANDA approval . . . .,” “the provision does not prohibit FDA from withdrawing approval . .
. .” 389 F.3d at 1281 (emphasis added).10 Even if such a conversion were appropriate under
“operation of law,” however, the issuance of the Federal Circuit stay on March 23 rendering
ineffective the district court injunction would have, “by operation of law,” undone any prior
conversion. For these reasons, Apotex’s argument that Mylan’s ANDA does not have approval
status is incorrect.

10

The legislative history of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments also suggests that FDA is required
to act to convert a full approval to a tentative approval to conform to the court’s order. See H.R.
Rep. No. 98-857, pt. 1, at 46 (1984) (“If the infringing party has not begun commercial marketing
of the drug, injunctive relief may be granted to prevent any commercial activity with the drug and
the FDA would be mandated to make the effective date of any approved ANDA not earlier than
the expiration date of the infringed patent.”) (emphasis added).

Mylan’s Eligibility for 180-day Exclusivity Does Not Extend Beyond the
Expiration of the Patent 11

Mylan asserts that regardless of the applicability of pediatric exclusivity, it has 180 days
of exclusivity which expires on September 19, 2007. Mylan Mem. at 11-14; Mylan Supp. Mem.
at 1-3. In its memorandum in support of its preliminary injunction, Mylan specifically argues
that this exclusivity blocks the approval of Apotex’s ANDA. FDA reached a contrary conclusion
in its administrative decision issued on April 18, and most of those who commented to FDA
agreed with FDA’s conclusion. FDA Decision at 10-13.
By the terms of the statute, when a listed patent expires, a paragraph IV certification is no
longer accurate. The statute and FDA’s regulations require ANDA applicants to change from a
paragraph IV certification to a paragraph II certification stating “that such patent has expired.”
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(II),(IV); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C) (“an applicant shall
amend a submitted certification if, at any time before the effective date of the approval of the
application, the applicant learns that the submitted certification is no longer accurate”). FDA has
determined, and courts have upheld, that in cases where an applicant neglects to amend its
certification to a paragraph II certification after a patent expires, FDA may treat it as having done
so. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, 302 F. Supp. 2d 340; Ranbaxy.
Although the 180-day “exclusivity” provision, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv), is commonly
characterized as granting 180-day exclusivity to the first applicant to submit an ANDA
containing a paragraph IV certification, the language of the statute does not provide for that result

11

Apotex and Teva do not challenge FDA’s decision on 180-day exclusivity. The government
includes this issue here in case the Court determines to address all of the pending issues at once.

directly. Instead, this end is accomplished by delaying the approval of subsequently filed
ANDAs containing a paragraph IV certification until 180 days after the exclusivity period for the
first (“previous”) applicant has begun. If the first applicant’s ANDA no longer contains a valid
paragraph IV certification when it is ready for approval, the first applicant is not eligible for
exclusivity. Similarly, when subsequent applications do not contain paragraph IV certifications,
their approval is not delayed under this statutory provision. Thus, once the patent expires and all
of the subsequent ANDA applicants are required to change their paragraph IV certifications to
paragraph II certifications, the first paragraph IV certification no longer blocks anything under
the express terms of the statute. FDA has consistently taken this position and it has been upheld.
See 59 Fed. Reg. 50338, 50348 (Oct. 3, 1994) (stating “a patent is deemed to be relevant [for
exclusivity purposes] until the end of the term of the patent or applicable 180-day period,
whichever occurs first”); Ranbaxy Labs., Ltd. v. Leavitt, 469 F.3d 120, 126 (D.C. Cir. 2006)
(“[T]he first generic applicant may no longer retain exclusivity when the patent has expired.”).
This conclusion is also consistent with the statutory scheme. Applications with paragraph
II certifications (i.e., certifying that the patent has expired) are generally eligible for immediate
effective approval; the patent ceases to be a barrier to that approval upon its expiration.
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(i) (when an applicant files a paragraph II certification, approval of the
applicant’s ANDA “may be made effective immediately”); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(12)(viii).
Further, the fact that the express language of the exclusivity provision, 21 U.S.C
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(iv), blocks only paragraph IV certifications and not paragraph III certifications
makes sense only if exclusivity expires with the patent because ANDAs with paragraph III
certifications cannot be approved before patent expiration.
If Mylan were correct about exclusivity lasting after patent expiration, 180-day
-41-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

exclusivity would block ANDAs containing paragraph IV certifications but not those containing
paragraph III certifications. This would have the perverse effect of punishing applicants who
took the risk of challenging a patent with a paragraph IV certification in order to remove a barrier
to approval and to reward those applicants who sat back and waited for the patent to expire. This
result is clearly inconsistent with the intent and logic of Hatch-Waxman. Thus, the fact that
section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) by its terms blocks only ANDAs containing paragraph IV certifications –
the only ANDAs that can be approved before the expiration of an applicable patent – indicates
Congress did not intend exclusivity to extend beyond patent expiration.
This plain language reading of the statute effectuates the statutory goals. The 180-day
exclusivity provision was drafted to give ANDA applicants an incentive to be first to challenge a
listed patent and remove that patent as a barrier to approval. Once a listed patent expires and is
no longer a barrier to ANDA approval, there is no longer a need to provide an incentive to
challenge it in court. Thus, an expired patent does not serve as the basis for a 180-day
exclusivity award, and 180-day exclusivity does not extend beyond the life of the patent.
Mylan argues that 21 U.S.C. § 355a(k) compels the conclusion that 180-day exclusivity
extends beyond the date the patent expires. See Mylan Supp. Mem. at 3. That section provides:
If a 180-day exclusivity period . . . overlaps with a 6-month [pediatric exclusivity]
period . . . , so that the applicant for approval of a drug under section [355(j)]
entitled to the 180-day period under that section loses a portion of the 180-day
period to which the applicant is entitled for the drug, the 180-day period shall be
extended from –
(1) the date on which the 180-day period would have expired by the number of days of
the overlap, if the 180-day period would, but for application of this subsection, expire
after the 6-month exclusivity period; or
(2) the date on which the 6-month exclusivity period expires, by the number of days of
the overlap if the 180-day period would, but for application of this subsection, expire
during the six-month exclusivity period.

On its face, this section is inapplicable here because Mylan is approved and is not subject to
Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity and there is thus no 180-day exclusivity to restore.
Instead, Mylan argues that by providing, in circumstances not applicable here, that 180day exclusivity will follow pediatric exclusivity, Congress must have been assuming that 180-day
exclusivity survives patent expiration. See Mylan Supp. Mem. at 3. If Mylan were correct, then
section 355a(k) would conflict with FDA’s longstanding understanding of the Hatch-Waxman
statutory provisions governing 180-day exclusivity, as discussed above, which FDA believes to
be compelled by the plain language of the statute. Thus, Mylan is essentially arguing that section
355a(k) repealed part of the Hatch-Waxman 180-day exclusivity provisions.
For one federal statute to repeal another:
[T]he intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest. . . . In
practical terms, this “cardinal rule” means that in the absence of some affirmative
showing of an intention to repeal, the only permissible justification for a repeal by
implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.
Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 189-90 (1978) (citations omitted). The
“irreconcilable conflict” required is a conflict
in the sense that there is a positive repugnancy between [the two statutes] or that
they cannot mutually coexist. It is not enough to show that the two statutes
produce differing results when applied to the same factual situation, for that no
more than states the problem.
Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 155 (1976). Here, there is no evidence that
Congress ever affirmatively indicated it intended to repeal or change the operation of the 180-day
exclusivity provision in enacting section 355a(k).
Nor can Mylan show that the 180-day provisions in Hatch-Waxman and section 355a(k)
are irreconcilable because it is possible to construe them in a way that they can mutually coexist.
By its terms, section 355a(k) only addresses the curtailment of exclusivity to which the applicant
-43-

Page 44 of 49

is otherwise “entitled.” As explained above, under Hatch-Waxman, the applicant is not entitled
to exclusivity after the patent expires. That means, in reconciling the statutes, that the
application of section 355a(k) is limited to the situation where there is more than one patent and
the two exclusivity periods are each attached to different patents. Thus, one patent may expire,
and pediatric exclusivity would start to run as to that patent, but the ANDA applicant could still
be eligible for 180-day exclusivity on a later patent that had not yet expired. If that 180-day
exclusivity period were triggered by a court decision on the later patent, it would be running at
the same time the ANDA was blocked from approval by the pediatric exclusivity on the earlier
patent.
Indeed, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to address this narrow
situation by adding 21 U.S.C. § 355a(k) to restore the exclusivity to which the ANDA applicant
was entitled but which otherwise would have been lost because the pediatric exclusivity on
another patent blocked final effective approval:
The amendment gives the filer of an [ANDA] who challenges a patent no more
and no less time to market his drug exclusively before subsequent [ANDAs] for
the drug may be approved then it would have received but for the intervening
period of pediatric exclusivity.
For example, the committee understands that there may be instances in which 2 patents
on a drug are challenged in an [ANDA], and that, in subsequent litigation, a court holds
the first patent to expire to be valid and infringed, and the second patent to expire to be
invalid. If the section [355(b)(1), 21 U.S.C.] drug is granted a period of pediatric
exclusivity with respect to the first patent, and if the court decision, which triggers the
beginning of ANDA exclusivity, falls 60 days before that period of pediatric exclusivity
begins (that is, 60 days before the first patent will expire), the ANDA exclusivity will
overlap with the pediatric exclusivity for 120 days. In the absence of the pediatric
exclusivity, the holder of the [ANDA] would enjoy at most 120 days to market its drug
before a subsequent [ANDA] for the drug could be approved. But for the amendment,
because of pediatric exclusivity, the holder of the [ANDA] would enjoy no ANDA
exclusivity, because the first 120 days of the pediatric exclusivity period would run over
the last 120 days of its ANDA exclusivity period.

S. Rep. No. 107-79, at 6-7 (2001); see also id. at 14 (“[Section 9 of BPCA] specifies that, when
the pediatric exclusivity period for a drug overlaps with a period of ANDA exclusivity for the
drug, the period of ANDA exclusivity is extended by an amount necessary to ensure that the
holder of ANDA exclusivity enjoys the same possibility of exclusive commercial marketing that
the holder would have enjoyed in the absence of pediatric exclusivity, no more and no less.”).
This language confirms both that Congress intended only the limited application of section
355a(k) and that this section can be construed consistently with the Hatch-Waxman exclusivity
provisions. Thus, “[b]ecause the statutes are not irreconcilable and there is no convincing
evidence that the later act was intended as a substitute, . . . a repeal by implication did not occur.”
United States v. Williams, 216 F.3d 1099, 1102 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

MOVANTS HAVE NOT SHOWN THEY WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE
INJURY ABSENT THE REQUESTED PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Not only do the movants’ claims for preliminary injunctive relief lack substantive merit,

they have also failed to demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm absent such relief or
that the balance of hardships tips in its favor. “The sine qua non of granting any preliminary
injunctive relief is a clear and convincing showing of irreparable injury to the plaintiff.”
Experience Works, Inc. v. Chao, 267 F. Supp. 2d 93, 96 (D.D.C. 2003). Because the likelihood
of success is extremely slim, the parties “would have to make a very substantial showing of
severe irreparable injury” to prevail on its motion. National Pharm. Alliance v. Henney, 47 F.
Supp. 2d 37, 41 (D.D.C. 1999). Irreparable injury is a “very high standard.” See Varicon Int’l v.
Office of Personnel Mgmt., 934 F. Supp. 440, 447 (D.D.C. 1996); Bristol-Myers, 923 F. Supp at
220. The injury alleged must be certain, great, actual, and imminent, Wisconsin Gas Co. v.
FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and it must be “more than simply irretrievable; it

must also be serious in terms of its effect on the plaintiff.” Mylan v. Thompson, 139 F. Supp. 2d
1, 27 (D.D.C. 2001) (quoting Gulf Oil Corp. v. Dep’t. of Energy, 514 F. Supp. 1019, 1026
(D.D.C. 1981)).
Mere economic loss in and of itself does not constitute irreparable harm. Wisconsin Gas,
758 F.2d at 674; Mylan Pharm., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 42; Bristol-Myers, 923 F. Supp. at 220. “Mere
injuries, however substantial in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended” are
inadequate. Wisconsin Gas, 758 F.2d at 674 (quoting Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. FPC,
259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958)). Even irrecoverable economic loss does not rise to the level
of irreparable harm unless the financial injury is so great as to “cause extreme hardship to the
business, or even threaten destruction of the business.” Gulf Oil, 514 F. Supp. at 1025; see also
Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20894 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2006) (to show irreparable
harm from economic loss, “a plaintiff must establish that the economic harm is so severe at to
cause extreme hardship to the business or threaten its very existence.”) (citation omitted);
Experience Works, Inc., 267 F. Supp. 2d at 96 ($21.1 million reduction in funding is serious
financial blow, but one frequently faced by other similar entities, and not an economic loss that
threatens survival of the business); Sociedad Anonima Vina Santa Rita v. Dep’t of Treasury, 193
F. Supp. 2d 6, 14 (D.D.C. 2001) (“financial harm alone cannot constitute irreparable injury
unless it threatens the very existence of the movant’s business”).
Apotex estimates that a favorable decision in this case (and an April launch date) could
net it $50-80 million in sales above what it would earn with a September launch date. Apotex
Mem. at 12. Teva similarly contends that “tens of millions” are at stake. Teva Mem. at 30.
Neither company contends that the existence of its company is at stake. Mylan does not attempt
to quantify its alleged harm, but alleges that if other ANDAs are approved it “would lose a

portion of the amlodipine market. . . . Mylan has forecasted that its revenues would reach several
million dollars per day.” Declaration of Brian S. Roman ¶6 (Mar. 23, 2007). Obviously because
Mylan is already on the market it would suffer, at most, an incremental impact on its sales. This
Court has previously noted that the “D.C. Circuit is hesitant to award injunctive relief based
purely on lost opportunities and market share,” and that “‘Mylan is the nation’s largest generic
drug manufacturer, with annual sales of approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars.’”
Mylan Pharmaceuticals, 139 F. Supp. 2d at 27-28 (quoting in part Mylan, 81 F. Supp. 2d at 43).
In addition, assertions such as Mylan’s that are not supported “with specific citations to the
record . . . do not rise above the level of mere speculation.” Id. at 28.
Mylan’s revenue for 2006 exceeded $1.25 billion. See
http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/66/66563/2006IAR/pdf/mylan_ar06_fin.pdf. The
worldwide sales of the Apotex Group of companies exceed $900 million (Canadian) per year.
See http://www.apotex.com/CorporateInformation/. It has been estimated that Teva (USA)’s
sales in 2006 were in the neighborhood of $130 million. See
http://www.hoovers.com/teva-pharmaceuticals-usa/--ID__111935--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml.
Moreover, Teva (USA) is the wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,
which considers itself “among the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the world” and
had $8.4 billion in total sales in 2006. See http://www.tevapharm.com/about/.
It is apparent from these figures that, while there is a lot of money to be made from the
sale of amlodipine, the absence of immediate relief from this Court will not destroy the business
of any company. Accordingly, the parties have failed to show irreparable harm.

THE BALANCE OF HARMS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST WEIGH
AGAINST THE MOVANTS’ REQUESTS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
The movants have also failed to show that the harm they will purportedly suffer in the

absence of injunctive relief outweighs the potential harm to other affected parties or that the entry
of such relief would further the public interest. Serono Labs, 158 F.3d at 1326; Mylan, 81 F.
Supp.2d at 44-45. Although FDA has no commercial stake in the outcome of this litigation,
FDA is the government agency charged with implementing the statutory scheme governing the
approval of generic drugs and with encouraging appropriate pediatric studies. As such, FDA’s
interest coincides with that of the public.
American consumers benefit from FDA ensuring that pediatric exclusivity is granted and
generic drugs are approved in accordance with the statutory scheme that Congress enacted and
that the rewards and incentives contained in the statute are properly allocated in the manner
Congress intended. See Biovail Corp. v. FDA, No. 06-1487, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20238 at
*29 (D.D.C. Mar. 22, 2007) (“The pubic will suffer harm if the FDA does not follow proper
procedures in approving generic drugs.”). The relief sought by the movants would upset
Congress’ careful balancing of incentives and rewards and disrupt the agency’s longstanding
administration of the pediatric exclusivity and ANDA approval provisions of the Act. Teva
asserts that “the public has been deprived of full access to safe and affordable generic amlodipine
drug products for nearly one month.” Teva Mem. at 33. There is no factual basis for this
hyperbole: beginning on March 23, 2007, two generic versions of Norvasc entered the market.
Moreover, any financial harm the movants would suffer in the absence of injunctive relief
would be at offset by the financial impact on the other interested parties should the requested

-48-

relief be granted. In addition, Pfizer could lose the full benefit of the pediatric exclusivity it
earned by conducting expensive and important pediatric studies of its product. Moreover, the
dispute before the Court is simply about how the profit from the sales for this drug product are
divided among the parties, so that any gain for Apotex, Teva, or Mylan is a loss for another party
and vice versa.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Apotex’s, Teva’s, and Mylan’s motions for preliminary
injunction should be denied.
