APOTEX'S OPPOSITION TO
MYLAN'S MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
INTRODUCTION
Mylan Laboratories, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceutical, Inc. (collectively "Mylan") are not
entitled to an injunction ordering the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) to
withhold approval of Apotex’s Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for generic
amlodipine. The injunction is inappropriate because:

Mylan does not have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits because the
FDA’s decision that Apotex’s ANDA is not subject to Pfizer's pediatric
exclusivity is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in
accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C.
§ 706(2)(A).

Mylan does not have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits because the
FDA’s decision that Mylan’s 180 day exclusivity rights ended with patent
expiration is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in
accordance with law under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

(3)

Apotex will suffer irreparable harm if it is prevented from entering the market for
amlodipine immediately.

The public interest in acquiring reduced pricing of prescription drugs is
substantial and favors allowing Apotex into the marketplace.

The balance of harms is neutral.
ARGUMENT

I.

MYLAN DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARD FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Mylan’s motion for preliminary injunction should be denied because it failed to satisfy

the requisite four factors:
(1)

a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,

(2)

that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted,

(3)

that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and

(4)

that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.

Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).
The four factors should be balanced on a sliding scale, and a party can compensate for a
lesser showing on one factor by making a very strong showing on another factor. CSX Transp.,
Inc. v. Williams, 406 F.3d 667 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citing CityFed Fin. Corp., 58 F.3d at 747).
However, it is particularly important for Mylan to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success
on the merits. Cf. Benten v. Kessler, 505 U.S. 1084, 1085 (1992) (per curiam). Absent a
“substantial indication” of likely success on the merits, “there would be no justification for the
court’s intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.” Am. Bankers
Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 38 F. Supp. 2d 114, 140 (D.D.C. 1999) (internal quotation
omitted).
Further, the other salient factor in the injunctive-relief analysis is irreparable injury.
Mylan must “demonstrate at least ‘some injury’” to warrant the granting of an injunction.
CityFed Fin. Corp., 58 F.3d at 747 (quotation omitted). Indeed, if Mylan makes no showing of
irreparable injury, the Court should deny the motion for injunctive relief without considering the
other factors. CityFed Fin. Corp., 58 F.3d at 747.
Because interim injunctive relief is an extraordinary form of judicial relief, courts should
grant such relief sparingly. Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997). As the Supreme
Court has said, “[i]t frequently is observed that a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and
drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the
burden of persuasion.” Id., 520 U.S. at 972 (citation omitted).

MYLAN CANNOT SHOW A LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS BECAUSE
THE FDA’S DECISION THAT APOTEX’S ANDA IS NOT SUBJECT TO PFIZER’S
PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY IS CORRECT
A.

The FDA’s Decision Is Supported By The Literal Wording Of The
Statute

The FDA has decided that Apotex is not blocked by pediatric exclusivity under 21 U.S.C.
§ 355a(c)(2)(B). That decision fits squarely within the statute. The following chart shows the
elements of the statute as compared to the status of Apotex’s ANDA.

The statute is silent about whether “the court” is a district court or an appellate court. The

The FDA’s Decision To Not Automatically Convert Apotex’s
Paragraph IV Certification to a Paragraph II Certification Is
Justified by Apotex’s Actual Victory Before the ‘303 Patent Expired

The FDA does not evaluate patent infringement or validity itself.2 See Mylan Labs., Inc.
v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 106 (D.D.C. 2004). Rather, it relies on court decisions as factual
inputs for its own actions. Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 389 F.3d 1272, 1284 (D.C. Cir. 2004)
(“The Vermont district court’s finding of patent validity and consequent injunction changed the
factual and legal landscape and the agency’s response to the court’s decision is both reasonable
and consistent with the statutory language.”) Here, FDA was required to account for the Federal
Circuit’s invalidity judgment in Pfizer v. Apotex in assessing the status of Apotex’s Paragraph IV
certification. In so doing, it properly determined that Apotex had met the statutory requirements
for a Paragraph IV certification by proving that Pfizer’s ‘303 patent was invalid per the Federal
Circuit’s Pfizer v. Apotex judgment. This Federal Circuit judgment meant that Apotex had
satisfied the Paragraph IV requirements and that the presumption of conversion to a Paragraph II
that might otherwise apply when a patent expired did not apply to Apotex.

The FDA’s

recognition of the Federal Circuit’s judgment of invalidity is a reasonable factual and legal basis
for the FDA to operate from, just as it was reasonable for the FDA to operate from the district

2

It is Apotex’s position that it should have been approved upon the entry of the order and the
judgment in the Federal Circuit. Apotex’s Motion for A Preliminary Injunction and Apotex’s
Memorandum Of Points And Authorities In Support Of Its Motion For Preliminary Injunction To
Order The FDA To Immediately Grant Approval To Apotex’s Anda For Amlodipine And Require
FDA To Order Mylan To Stop Marketing Its Generic Amlodipine And For Other Relief, filed
Apr. 23, 2007. However, for now, the FDA has decided that it will only approve Apotex’s
ANDA as of the issuance of the mandate of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. If Apotex is
wrong, then the FDA’s present position is the correct one. If the FDA was reasonable in
deciding that it needed to wait for mandate to approve Apotex’s ANDA (which it was not), then
FDA was also reasonable in not converting Apotex’s ANDA from a Paragraph IV certification to
a Paragraph II certification.

court order in the “Vermont” case (Alza v. Mylan). Therefore, Mylan has not shown that the
FDA’s decision is unreasonable. Mylan is unlikely to succeed on the merits.
C.

Mylan’s Argument Ignores That Apotex Has Overcome The
Presumption Of Conversion To A Paragraph II Certification

Mylan argues that the FDA presumes that Paragraph IV certifications are converted to
Paragraph II certifications by the expiration of the patent.

Memorandum Of Points And

Authorities In Support Of Plaintiffs’ Application For A Preliminary Injunction, at 5, citing FDA
Decision, at 8. Mylan ignores the fact that presumptions are not absolute and that here there is
ample support for the FDA’s and Apotex’s position that overcomes this presumption.
Mylan’s reliance on Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 106 (D.D.C. 2004)
(assessing the effects of the Vermont district court’s decision in the underlying patent
infringement case, Alza v. Mylan), is inapposite. As the court found:
On March 25, 2004, the Vermont Court, sitting as the patent court,
issued its ruling and concluded that, under patent law, Alza’s
patent was valid and had been infringed. Alza Corp., 310
F. Supp. 2d at 623-37. Therefore, the court, applying the remedies
listed in § 271(e)(4)(A) of the patent code, ordered that “the
effective date of any approval of Mylan’s ANDA product shall be
no earlier than the date of expiration” of Alza's '580 patent. Id. at
637. This order created a new legal and factual predicate upon
which the FDA was required to operate.
Id. at 119 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the FDA had ample support for its finding that Alza
had met its factual burdens under 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B) (i.e., that a court had determined
that Alza’s patent was valid and infringed by Mylan such that the pediatric exclusivity would
apply), and had a legal basis for finding Mylan’s Paragraph IV certification no longer accurate.
Id. Further, the judgment of the Vermont Court was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on appeal.
Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 391 F.3d 1365, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Here, just the opposite happened. The Federal Circuit issued an opinion and judgment of
invalidity against Pfizer and for Apotex. In the Alza v. Mylan case, Mylan had lost both in the
district court and on appeal. In this case, the FDA has ample support that Pfizer was not entitled
to a full six months of pediatric exclusivity under 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B) with respect to
Apotex, and that Apotex’s Paragraph IV certification is still accurate in all material respects.
Accordingly, the FDA decision that Apotex’s Paragraph IV certification remains valid is not
arbitrary or capricious and is in accordance with law.
Mylan further contends that the FDA has erred in not concluding that Apotex’s
Paragraph IV certification contains an “untrue statement of material fact.” The record, including
the judgment and opinion of the Federal Circuit, is sufficient for the FDA to base its decision on
the new “legal and factual predicate[s]” created by the Federal Circuit. Id. Because Apotex
prevailed before the Federal Circuit, its Paragraph IV certification remains factually accurate.
The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 389 F.3d 1272, 1282-84 (D.C.
Cir. 2004), which pertains to a situation where the Paragraph IV filer loses its court challenge to
the patent, is inapposite.
D.

Mylan’s Attack On The FDA Decision Does Not Recognize The
Distinction Between “Necessary” Conditions And “Sufficient”
Conditions

Mylan’s attempts to analogize to the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Mova Pharm. Corp. v.
Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1998), which pertained to an entirely different part of the
statute, fall well short of the mark. In Mova, the D.C. Circuit determined that FDA exceeded its
statutory authority in imposing a “successful defense” requirement as a prerequisite to the
invocation of the 180-day exclusivity rule by a first applicant under section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). Id.
at 1076. The reason was that the non-statutorily based, extra requirement as a prerequisite to

-7-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 55

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 8 of 17

application of the statutory 180-day exclusivity was inconsistent with the plain meaning of the
statute. Id. Here, by contrast, FDA’s decision is based on the rationale that where the patent
holder has a burden to show validity and infringement, and the ANDA applicant successfully
proves a patent to be invalid, the ANDA applicant’s successful defense defeats the patent
holder’s pediatric exclusivity rights.
III.

MYLAN CANNOT SHOW THAT IT IS ENTITLED TO A FULL 180 DAYS OF
EXCLUSIVITY
For more than a decade, FDA has squarely taken the position that the expiration of a

patent divests the first Paragraph IV filer of any entitlement to 180-day exclusivity based on that
patent. That interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the statute, longstanding FDA
regulations on 180-day exclusivity, the existing case law on 180-day exclusivity, and the policies
underlying the statute. Mylan has not identified any basis for departing from FDA’s settled
practice, and there is none. As a result, Mylan is not entitled to continued 180-day marketing
exclusivity for generic amlodipine drug products, and the Agency may not lawfully rely upon
Mylan's first-filer status to withhold the approval of any pending ANDA that otherwise is
eligible for final approval now that the patent has expired.
A.

The Plain Language Of The Statute And Longstanding FDA
Regulations Compel The Conclusion That Patent Expiration Divests
The First Filer Of Any Remaining 180-Day Exclusivity.

On its face, the plain language of the Hatch-Waxman Act distinguishes between cases
where a patent has expired and cases where the patent has not. In the former circumstance, the
statute permits the Agency to grant an applicant final approval “effective immediately.” 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(i). In the latter circumstance, by contrast, the statute precludes the Agency
from granting final approval for “one hundred and eighty days after” either (1) the first

-8-

Page 9 of 17

Paragraph IV applicant commercially markets its product, or (2) the date of a court decision
holding the patent invalid or not infringed. Id. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv).
B.

FDA Regulations Are Consistent With The Clear Statutory Language

To effectuate that aspect of the statutory scheme, FDA regulations have told applicants
that patents are only relevant until the end of their patent term. See 21 C.F.R.
§ 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) (recognizing that a patent is of no continuing relevance for 180-day
exclusivity purposes after expiration). As the FDA explained in its rulemaking preamble: “[A]
patent is deemed to be relevant . . . until the end of the term of the patent or applicable 180-day
exclusivity period, whichever occurs first.” Abbreviated New Drug Applications: Patent And
Exclusivity Provisions, 59 Fed. Reg. 50,338, 50,348 (Oct. 3, 1994) (emphasis added).
C.

Existing Case Law Supports The Conclusion That Patent Expiration
Divests A First-Filer Of 180-Day Exclusivity

Every court decision that has addressed the impact of patent expiration on a first-filer's
180-day exclusivity supports the view that patent expiration divests the first filer of its
exclusivity period, even after that period has commenced. See, e.g., Ranbaxy Labs. Ltd. v.
Leavitt, 469 F.3d 120, 126 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Dr. Reddy’s Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 302 F. Supp.
2d 340, 354-55 (D.N.J. 2003). For instance, in Dr. Reddy’s, the court specifically upheld FDA’s
determination that the expiration of a patent divests the first-filer of its eligibility for exclusivity
as a reasonable interpretation of the statute. 302 F. Supp. 2d at 354-55.
To be sure, Dr. Reddy’s involved a case where the underlying patent expired before the
Agency granted final approval to the first filer, rather than after it did so. But the court’s
rationale applies equally on the facts of this case. As Dr. Reddy’s explains, a rule maintaining
exclusivity after patent expiration would lead to perverse results, because it would allow an
applicant to file the first Paragraph IV certification immediately prior to patent expiration and

-9-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 10 of 17

then delay the onset of full market competition even after the only patent barrier to full generic
competition has fallen. Dr. Reddy’s, 302 F. Supp. 2d at 354. As the court noted, that would be
inconsistent with the purpose of the statutory scheme, which is intended to encourage patent
challenges in order to remove “listed patents that prevent final ANDA approval,” id., and thereby
facilitate early generic market entry. Once there are no remaining listed patents that prevent final
ANDA approval, however, there is no reason to erect another barrier to all generic market entry;
all subsequent applicants should be permitted to enter the market without regard to their status as
subsequent filers. Id. (“Once a listed patent expires, there is no longer a need to provide an
incentive to challenge it in court. Consistent with this statutory purpose, the FDA construes the
statute to award 180-day exclusivity based only upon Paragraph IV certifications to unexpired
patents.”) (citing 59 Fed. Reg. at 50348)).

More recently, the D.C. Circuit built on the

Dr. Reddy’s holding by explaining that “the text and structure of the statute suggest ... that the
first generic applicant may no longer retain exclusivity when the patent has expired.” Ranbaxy,
469 F.3d at 126 (emphasis supplied). That is so, the court suggested, because of 21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(i), which provides that an application containing a paragraph II certification may
be approved “effective immediately.” Id. As the D.C. Circuit thus has recognized, the statute
plainly suggests that there is no basis for continuing first filer 180-day exclusivity after patent
expiration, because the statute unambiguously permits subsequent ANDAs to be approved as
soon as they contain post-expiration paragraph II certifications.
D.

Divesting The First Filer Of Exclusivity Upon Patent Expiration Is
Consistent With FDA’s Interpretation Of The Court-Decision Trigger

Finally, interpreting the statute to divest a first filer of its remaining 180-day exclusivity
after patent expiration is consistent with FDA's longstanding interpretation of the pre-MMA
court-decision trigger. By now, it is well-settled that the first filer effectively may be deprived of

- 10 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 55

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 11 of 17

its exclusivity where a subsequent applicant prevails in its own Paragraph IV litigation, and
thereby triggers the first-filer's 180-day exclusivity period, before the first filer can market its
product. See, e.g., Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Barr Labs., 289 F.3d 775, 780 (Fed. Cir.
2002) (“The District of Columbia Circuit has explicitly held that § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II) [can be]
triggered by the termination of an action commenced by the second ANDA filer, and we agree.”)
(citing Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. FDA, 182 F.3d 1003, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 1999)). Thus, if a
subsequent applicant obtains a court decision of invalidity, non-infringement, or unenforceability
through its own Paragraph IV litigation with the patentee, the first filer’s exclusivity will begin to
run whether or not the first filer is eligible to market its product at that time.
As a result, the first filer's 180-day exclusivity period may run out entirely before the first
filer can market its product for a single day. See, e.g., SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Geneva
Pharms., Inc., 210 F.R.D. 547, 553 (E.D. Pa. 2002). In such cases, all applicants – regardless of
their patent certifications – are potentially eligible to receive final approval to market their drug
products on the 181st day after the triggering court decision, and that is so whether or not the
first applicant has enjoyed a moment of its exclusivity period. It goes without saying that if the
first filer's exclusivity period can begin and end before the first filer can ever use it, that period
cannot be extended past the 180th day simply because the manufacturer began its commercial
marketing at some point during the period. In other words, it is well-settled that the mere
triggering of a 180-day exclusivity period does not necessarily entitle the first filer to its full 180
days of exclusive marketing.
The same is true of patent expiration: the mere fact that Mylan finally triggered its 180day exclusivity period two days before patent expiration does not entitle Mylan to the full
measure of its exclusivity now that the final patent obstacle has expired. Instead, permitting

- 11 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 12 of 17

Mylan to do so would be flatly inconsistent with the fundamental goal of the statutory scheme,
which aims to "'get generic drugs into the hands of patients at reasonable prices-fast."' Andrx
Pharms., Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Int'l, 256 F.3d 799, 809 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting In re Barr
Labs., Inc., 930 F.2d 72, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). That policy assumes a paramount importance once
the expiration of a listed patent opens the pathway to full generic market entry, and there is no
basis for depriving consumers of broader competition and increased price relief now that the '303
patent has expired.
IV.

MYLAN HAS FAILED TO SHOW IRREPARABLE HARM AND THE BALANCE OF
THE HARMS FAVORS APOTEX
The nature and extent of Mylan’s asserted harm and the overall balance of the harms

militate against entry of Mylan’s requested preliminary injunction. Every showing of irreparable
harm that Mylan attempts to make is contradicted by its failure to recognize that Apotex
similarly faces irreparable harm. Furthermore, Apotex has a strong argument, as asserted in its
own Application for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 47), that Apotex, not Mylan, should be the
only true generic on the market because Mylan lost its patent infringement lawsuit with Pfizer
and therefore should have been returned to tentative approval by operation of law before the time
the patent expired. Under Mylan’s own analysis, Mylan therefore should have converted to a
Paragraph II certification once Pfizer’s patent expired, and as such, Mylan should be barred by
Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity.
A.

Apotex Will Lose The Ability To Fight For A Market Leadership
Position

Mylan's cases in support of its argument of irreparable injury to itself directly contradict
its argument that the harm to Apotex is insignificant. See Express One Intern., Inc. v. U.S. Postal

- 12 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Serv., 814 F. Supp. 87, 91 (D.D.C. 1992) (stating that the court has recognized irreparable injury
when a party lost the renewal of a contract to another bidder).
A decision that the FDA cannot approve Apotex's ANDA for generic amlodipine would
seriously disadvantage Apotex. If Mylan continues to sell its generic drug, and Apotex is not
permitted to enter the market, Apotex will lose its opportunity to fight for a leadership position in
the marketplace as an early entrant. Having that leadership position is essential to capture a
sizable portion of the amlodipine market and associated annual sales that are forecasted to reach
the hundreds of millions of dollars – harms for which there is no legal redress.
B.

Loss Of Market Share In A Highly Competitive Industry Where
Market Share Is Unlikely To Be Recaptured Is Irreparable Harm

Loss of market share in a highly competitive industry is irreparable harm because of the
difficulty of recovering from a loss of market share. As the court in Novartis Consumer Health,
Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 595-96 (3d Cir. 2002),
explained (emphasis supplied):
Nonetheless, we conclude that the District Court's error in citing
the wrong standard was harmless because there is sufficient
evidence in the record to support a finding of irreparable harm
necessary to issue a preliminary injunction. The District Court
observed that the promotion and sale of MNTS had already had a
measurable effect on Maalox's market share as reflected by a
decrease in sales of Maalox that corresponds to the increased sales
for MNTS. 129 F. Supp. 2d at 369. We are satisfied that this loss
of market share constitutes irreparable harm. See Moltan Co. v.
Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 55 F.3d 1171, 1175 (6th Cir. 1995)
(affirming decision to grant preliminary injunction where
manufacturer's false claims were causing irreparable injury to a
competitor in the form of lost sales and market share); Cordis
Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc., 835 F.2d 859, 864 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("a
loss in market share caused by an injunction could result in
irreparable harm"); see also Pappan Enters., Inc. v. Hardee's Food
Sys., Inc., 143 F.3d 800, 805 (3d Cir. 1998) ("Grounds for
irreparable injury include loss of control of reputation, loss of
trade, and loss of goodwill."); Opticians Ass'n v. Indep. Opticians,

920 F.2d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 1990) (same). In a competitive
industry where consumers are brand-loyal, we believe that loss
of market share is a "potential harm which cannot be
redressed by a legal or an equitable remedy following a trial."
Instant Air Freight, 882 F.2d at 801.
Representatives from both parties that are seeking to establish a leadership position in the
market for generic amlodipine tablets have offered declarations supporting the proposition that
irreparable harm is caused by being kept out of the generic drug market during this crucial
period. See McIntire Decl. (for Apotex) (attached as Exhibit B to 4/23/07 Apotex Mem.); Roman
Decl. (for Mylan) (attached as Exhibit C to 4/23/07 Apotex Mem.). The existence of irreparable
harm is undisputed by the parties with economic interests in the matter.
The requested preliminary injunction will prevent Apotex from getting a fair start in this
race to market. Mylan is obtaining a head start against Apotex that it is not entitled to. That head
start will permit Mylan to secure distribution channels, favorable positioning in customer supply
programs, and access to customers, thereby enabling Mylan to retain a greater market share in
the long term. See Roman Decl., ¶6 at 2. Apotex will never be able to recover for its lost market
share from FDA or anyone else.
Based on its experience in the industry, Apotex calculates that if it receives final FDA
approval for its ANDA in April 2007, a best case scenario would give Apotex a 30% market
share of the generic sales, which would result in Apotex sales of $83,718,851 for the first 12
months post-launch. McIntire Decl., ¶14. Even in a worst case scenario, for an April launch,
Apotex would have 20% of the market at approximately $55,673,036 in sales for the first 12
months post-launch. (Id.) However, if Apotex is prohibited from launching until September
2007, it would be lucky to obtain a 10% market share with yearly revenues of approximately
$5,244,000. (Id.)

Mylan itself recognizes the value of the market for generic Norvasc® tablets. Mylan’s
Vice President and General Counsel, Brian S. Roman, filed a declaration to support Mylan’s
emergency application for a temporary restraining order, stating that Mylan “has forecasted that
its revenues would reach several million dollars per day” (Roman Dec. ¶ 6), and he further stated
that by being the first to launch into the generic marketplace, Mylan will be able to gain
favorable positioning in customer supply programs and access to additional customers, thereby
obtaining and retaining a greater market share in the long term. (Id.) Mr. Roman also claimed
that FDA approval of other ANDAs would mean that “Mylan would lose a portion of the
amlodipine market and associated sales that are forecasted to reach the hundreds of millions of
dollars. . . .”

(Id.)

Therefore, the requested preliminary injunction would exacerbate the

irreparable harm to Apotex.
C.

Mylan Could Have Been On The Market Long Ago

Mylan itself could have avoided the potential harm that it now asserts (loss of 6 months
of market exclusivity) if it had begun marketing its generic amlodipine besylate product when it
first was granted final FDA approval back in October 3, 2005. Final approval means that Mylan
could have shipped product on that date, or at any time thereafter, until it lost its patent case on
February 27, 2007. If it had done so, it could have enjoyed a full 6 months of exclusivity as the
only generic on the market. Mylan has been long aware of the FDA's position that 180 day
exclusivity does not survive patent expiration. Thus, Mylan has had ample opportunity to start
marketing and get the full benefit of its 180-day exclusivity. Mylan also had ample opportunity
to challenge FDA's views in this area if it were so inclined, rather than waiting until just before
the stroke of midnight to seek a TRO without giving notice to known, adversely affected entities
like Apotex.

V.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS SERVED BY DENYING MYLAN'S MOTION FOR
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND PERMITTING APOTEX TO ENTER THE MARKET
The public has a well-recognized interest in "receiving generic competition to

brand-name drugs as soon as is possible," Boehringer Ingelheim Corp. v. Shalala, 993 F. Supp.
1, 3 (D.D.C. 1997), and a "delay in the marketing of [the generic] drug could easily be against
the public interest in reduced prices," Schering Corp. v. Sullivan, 782 F. Supp. 645, 652 (D.D.C.
1992). Accordingly, the public interest is in having Apotex on the market with its generic drug.
VI.

THE BALANCE OF HARMS FAVORS APOTEX OR IS NEUTRAL
Presently, Mylan is on the market. If the FDA is allowed to permit Apotex to enter the

market, Mylan will have to compete for market share with Apotex as opposed to being the only
true generic on the market. If it were to turn out that Mylan's requested preliminary injunction
was improperly denied, and Apotex is forced to leave the market at a later date, Mylan could
seize the market share that Apotex had been holding. In other words, in the event of an
erroneous denial of a preliminary injunction, Mylan is not harmed. However, if the Court
erroneously grants the injunction, Apotex will never be able to recover its market share in this
highly competitive market.
Each party is seeking the same market share for the same reasons. Neither needs the
market share more than the other. The balance of harms is equal.
Accordingly, denial of the requested injunction to prevent Apotex from entering the
market minimizes the prospect of irreparable harm all around, while the risk of economic harms
is equal.
