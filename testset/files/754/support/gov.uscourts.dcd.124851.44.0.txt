INTRODUCTION
Mylan seeks to enjoin the FDA from implementing that part of its April 18, 2007
decision holding that Apotex’s ANDA is eligible for approval if the Pfizer v. Apotex1 mandate
issues before September 25, 2007. Should the mandate issue, Apotex’s ANDA would still be
blocked either by pediatric exclusivity or by Mylan’s 180-day generic exclusivity. Under the
FDA’s rules and long-standing practice, Apotex’s paragraph IV ANDA automatically converted
to a paragraph II ANDA when the last Orange Book patent expired. Section 355a(c)(2)(B) of the
Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act prohibits the approval of any paragraph II ANDA during
pediatric exclusivity, and the FDA’s attempt to reward the second-filer under these
circumstances directly contravenes that statute. See Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 140
F.3d 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Moreover, even if Apotex somehow maintained its paragraph IV
certification after patent expiration, § 355(j)(5)(b)(iv) of the Hatch-Waxman Act expressly
provides that a paragraph IV ANDA cannot be approved until Mylan’s 180-day exclusivity
period has run.
The FDA has refused to agree to provide this Court with any notice prior to approving
Apotex’s ANDA once the Pfizer v. Apotex mandate issues. Because the Federal Circuit could
issue its mandate at any time, Mylan faces irreparable harm if the FDA approves Apotex’s
ANDA and Apotex enters the market, destroying Mylan’s right to be free from other generic
competition during the statutory period. In order to preserve the status quo as well as this
Court’s jurisdiction to review the FDA’s decision to reward the second-filer Apotex at Mylan’s
expense, the Court should enjoin FDA from approving Apotex’s ANDA following issuance of
the Pfizer v. Apotex mandate until Mylan’s claims can be adjudicated on the merits.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
On May 22, 2002, Mylan became the first ANDA applicant to submit a substantially
complete application containing a paragraph IV certification to the patents listed in the Orange
Book for the reference listed drug, Norvasc® (amlodipine besylate tablets). Mylan challenged
Pfizer’s improper patent monopoly on Norvasc a year before the next ANDA filer, Apotex, did
so. The FDA granted final approval of Mylan’s ANDA on October 3, 2005.
In a letter notifying Mylan that its ANDA had received final approval, the FDA
confirmed that because Mylan was the first applicant to file an ANDA with a paragraph IV
certification, “Mylan is eligible for 180 days of market exclusivity.” Declaration of Shannon M.
Bloodworth in Support of Plaintiffs’ Application for a Preliminary Injunction (“Bloodworth
Decl.”), Exh. A, October 3, 2005 letter from Gary J. Buehler to Mylan at 2. The letter went on to
state, consistent with the plain language of the Hatch-Waxman Act and the FDA’s own
regulations, that Mylan’s 180-day generic marketing exclusivity “will begin to run from the
earlier of commercial marketing or court decision dates identified in [21 U.S.C.] section
355(j)(5)(B)(iv).” Id. The FDA approved Mylan’s amlodipine ANDA despite the fact that in
November 2001, the FDA had granted Pfizer so-called pediatric exclusivity pursuant to 21
U.S.C. § 355a. See Bloodworth Decl., Exh. B, FDA’s Letter Decision dated April 18, 2007
(“FDA Ltr.”) at 4.
On September 20, 2002, Pfizer brought suit against Mylan for patent infringement in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania
action”).

In May 2003, Apotex filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to sell

amlodipine besylate tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer’s ‘303 patent and submitted a
paragraph IV certification that its amlodipine besylate products would not violate the ‘303
patent. On July 30, 2003, Pfizer sued Apotex for patent infringement in the United States
2

Page 9 of 26

District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the “Illinois action”). The FDA has not
approved Apotex’s amlodipine besylate ANDA.
Following a bench trial in the Illinois action, on January 29, 2006, the district court
entered judgment dismissing Apotex’s invalidity and unenforceability defenses and declaring
that Apotex’s amlodipine besylate tablets infringed the ‘303 patent. The district court ordered
that the effective date of Apotex’s ANDA be no earlier than September 25, 2007 (reflecting the
patent term plus six months of pediatric exclusivity) and enjoined Apotex from engaging in
commercial activities with respect to amlodipine besylate. Bloodworth Decl., at Exh. C. Apotex
appealed the district court judgment to the Federal Circuit.
On February 27, 2007, following a bench trial in the Pennsylvania action, the district
court entered judgment dismissing Mylan’s invalidity and unenforceability defenses and
declaring that Mylan’s amlodipine besylate tablets infringed the ‘303 patent. See Bloodworth
Decl., at Exh. D. The district court ordered that the effective date of Mylan’s ANDA be no
earlier than March 25, 2007. See id. at Exh. E. Mylan appealed the district court judgment to the
Federal Circuit.
On March 22, 2007, the Federal Circuit issued its decision in the Apotex case, holding the
‘303 patent invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103. See Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., No.
06-1261, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 6623 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 22, 2007). The following day, the Federal
Circuit issued a stay of the district court’s order in the Pennsylvania action. See Bloodworth
Decl., at Exh. F. Later that same day, Mylan began commercial marketing of amlodipine
besylate tablets, thereby triggering its 180 days of exclusivity afforded by § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) of
the Hatch-Waxman Act and the FDA’s approval letter. See id. at Exh. G.

On March 26, 2007, Mylan filed this action and moved for a preliminary injunction
prohibiting the FDA from approving any other ANDAs during Mylan’s 180-day period of
generic exclusivity and the six-month period of pediatric exclusivity. The FDA responded by
seeking comments on the applicability and effect of generic and pediatric exclusivity in this case.
Bloodworth Decl., at Exh. H. On April 18, 2007, the FDA issued a decision letter ruling that,
with one exception, all unapproved ANDAs were blocked by pediatric exclusivity until
September 25, 2007. Bloodworth Decl., Exh. B., FDA Ltr. at 9. With respect to Apotex, the
FDA ruled that its ANDA could be approved if the Federal Circuit were to issue its mandate
before September 25, 2007. Id.
ARGUMENT
I.

LEGAL STANDARDS
Mylan is entitled to a preliminary injunction if it can show “1) a substantial likelihood of

success on the merits, 2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, 3)
that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and 4) that the public
interest would be furthered by the injunction.” Mova, 140 F.3d at 1066 (quoting CityFed
Financial Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). These
factors interrelate on a sliding scale and must be balanced against each other. “If the arguments
for one factor are particularly strong, an injunction may issue even if the arguments in the other
areas are rather weak.” CityFed Fin. Corp., 58 F.3d at 746.
II.

MYLAN HAS A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCEEDING ON THE
MERITS OF ITS CLAIM AGAINST THE FDA
Mylan challenges that part of the April 18, 2007 FDA decision holding that Apotex’s

ANDA is eligible for approval if the Pfizer v. Apotex mandate issues before September 25, 2007.
The FDA’s decision to create an “exception” for Apotex is arbitrary and capricious because even
4

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 44-2

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 11 of 26

if the mandate issues before September 25, Apotex’s ANDA will still be blocked either by
Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity or by Mylan’s 180-day generic exclusivity.
A.

THE FDA’S DECISION TO MAINTAIN APOTEX’S PARAGRAPH IV
CERTIFICATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING APOTEX TO AVOID
PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY VIOLATES THE PLAIN STATUTORY LANGUAGE, THE
FDA’S OWN PRECEDENTS, AND IS ARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS, AND CONTRARY
TO LAW.

In its April 18 decision, the FDA correctly ruled that Pfizer maintains pediatric
exclusivity2 despite the panel decision in Pfizer v. Apotex because (1) the mandate has not issued,
and (2) the panel decision invalidated only claims 1-3 of the ‘303 patent, leaving the remaining
claims unaffected and the ‘303 patent “validly listed in the Orange Book.” FDA Ltr. at 5-7,
9-10. Inexplicably, however, the FDA ruled that while all other ANDAs are blocked until the
mandate issues, “if and when the mandate finalizing the panel’s decision issues in the Apotex
case, Apotex’s ANDA will not be blocked by Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity.” Id. at 9.
When the ‘303 patent expired on March 25 of this year, Apotex held an unapproved
paragraph IV certification. Under longstanding FDA policy and practice, “upon patent expiry,
all ANDA applicants are presumed to have paragraph II certifications, [and] the paragraph II
provision of the pediatric exclusivity statute, 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i) [] control[s].” FDA
Ltr. at 8. That section provides:

2

The six-month period of pediatric exclusivity was established by the passage of the
Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, Pub. Law 105-115, 111 Stat. 2296
(Nov. 21, 1997). It was reenacted and enhanced in 2002 as the Best Pharmaceuticals for
Children Act, Pub. Law 107-109, 115 Stat. 1408 (Jan. 4, 2002). Pediatric exclusivity affords a
six-month period of marketing exclusivity following expiration of the listed patent during which
the FDA may not grant final approval to any ANDA. See 21 U.S.C. § 355a (2002). Its purpose
is to encourage pharmaceutical companies to study the effects of their drugs in the pediatric
population.

if the drug is the subject of—
(i) a listed patent for which a [paragraph II] certification has been submitted . . . and
for which pediatric studies were submitted prior to the expiration of the patent
(including any patent extensions) . . .
*

*

*

the period during which an application may not be approved under section 505(c)(3) or
section 505(j)(5)(B)(ii) shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the
patent expires (including any patent extensions).
21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The language chosen by Congress is clear and
unambiguous – upon the patent’s expiration, the period during which the FDA may not approve
paragraph II ANDAs “shall” be extended by six months. There is nothing in the language of
subsection (c)(2)(A) that permits an inquiry into whether the patent was held valid or infringed,
or whether there was a “favorable decision” that the patent is invalid or not infringed. This
analysis applies only to those ANDAs that contain a paragraph IV certification and are
accordingly governed by subsection (c)(2)(B).

The FDA cannot read the requirements of

(c)(2)(B) into (c)(2)(A). See Western Union Tel. Co. v. FCC, 729 F.2d 811, 817 (D.C. Cir. 1984)
(stating that the agency “cannot simply ignore Congress’ words and attempt to write a new
statute out of whole cloth”); cf. Teva Pharms., Indus., Ltd. v. FDA, 355 F. Supp. 2d 111, 115
(D.D.C. 2004) (rejecting Teva’s argument that the FDA acted contrary to the purpose of the
FDCA because the plain language of the statute was clear). If the FDA or others (such as
Apotex) disagrees with this plain language, then their grievance lies not with the FDA or this
Court, “but with the response of the Congress.” Williams Natural Gas Co. v. FERC, 943 F.2d
1320, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1991).
The FDA’s decision to maintain Apotex’s paragraph IV certification is contrary to the
FDA’s long-standing, well-established rules and policies. For years, the FDA has consistently
held that all tentatively approved ANDAs containing a paragraph IV certification automatically

become paragraph II certifications upon the relevant patent’s expiration.

See Mylan v.

Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 106, 114 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d, 389 F.3d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The
FDA has based this position on 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(4)(K), which precludes the FDA from
approving any ANDA that “contains an untrue statement of material fact.” See also 21 C.F.R. §
314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(1) (mandating a certification change “if, at any time before the effective
date of the approval of the application, the applicant learns that the submitted certification is no
longer accurate”). Even if the applicant fails or refuses to change its certification to a paragraph
II upon the patent’s expiration, the FDA’s long-standing policy is that the certification is
“deemed” changed as a matter of law.
The D.C. Circuit has upheld this policy of automatically changing an unapproved
ANDA’s paragraph IV certification to a paragraph II certification once it becomes (due to
expiration of the relevant patent) “at variance with the legal reality.” Mylan v. Thompson, 389
F.3d 1272, 1281-1282 (D.C. Cir. 2004).3

The change occurs at “the ‘magic moment’ of

midnight,” and pediatric exclusivity immediately attaches. Ranbaxy Labs. Ltd. v. FDA, 307 F.
Supp. 2d 15, 19 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 8311 (D.C. Cir., Apr. 26, 2004);
see also Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. v. Thompson, 302 F. Supp. 2d 340, 351 (D.N.J. 2003)

In Mylan v. Thompson, which involved an ANDA for a fentanyl transdermal patch,
Mylan had received final approval, which was subsequently converted to tentative approval
pursuant to an order by the Vermont district court. The FDA held that because Mylan was a
tentatively approved applicant, its paragraph IV certification converted to a paragraph II
certification at the time that the challenged patent expired. The D.C. Circuit, affirming the
district court, found “the FDA’s application of the statutory provisions both reasonable and
supported by Ranbaxy.” 389 F.3d at 1281-83, aff’g 332 F. Supp. 2d 106. This is exactly the
situation faced by Apotex, which likewise had a paragraph IV certification with tentative
approval at the time the ‘303 patent expired.

certification in a tentatively approved ANDA is no longer accurate and it converts de facto or de
jure to a paragraph II certification at the moment the patent expires).
Throughout its April 18 decision letter, the FDA repeatedly affirmed its commitment to
its “long-standing” rule that, upon expiration of the relevant patent, it would “deem” any
outstanding paragraph IV certification in an unapproved ANDA to have become a paragraph II
certification. See FDA Ltr. at 8 (“It has been FDA’s long-standing view, that, when a patent
expires before pending patent litigation is resolved, ANDA applicants who have not received
final effective approval [such as Apotex] are required under Hatch-Waxman, to change their . . .
paragraph IV certifications to paragraph II certifications.”); id. (“[U]pon patent expiry, all
ANDA applicants are presumed to have paragraph II certifications[.]”); id. at 9 (“When the ‘303
patent expired on March 25, 2007, all of the unapproved ANDAs were required to change (or
deemed to have changed) to paragraph II certifications and became subject to Pfizer’s pediatric
exclusivity at that time.”); id. at 10 (“If one or more of the remaining claims qualified the patent
for listing as of the time the patent expired, all of the remaining ANDAs who had . . . paragraph
IV certifications at the time of patent expiry are required to maintain their paragraph II
certifications.”); id. (“[W]hen a listed patent expires, a paragraph IV certification is no longer
accurate. In these circumstances, the statute and FDA’s regulations require ANDA applicants to
change form a paragraph IV certification… to a paragraph II certification… . In cases where an
applicant neglects to amend its certification to a paragraph II certification after a patent expires,
FDA will treat it as having done so.”); id. at 13 (“[A]ll of the remaining unapproved applications
change to a paragraph II certification when the patent expires, as they are required to do, they
will no longer be applications containing paragraph IV certifications.”).

Based on the FDA’s court-approved rules and long-standing agency practice, Apotex’s
ANDA thus should have been converted to a paragraph II application at midnight on March 25.
And at that precise point, § 355a(c)(2)(A) of the BPCA unambiguously provides that “the period
during which an application may not be approved . . . shall be extended by a period of six
months after the date the patent expires” (emphasis added).

Yet the FDA, relying on an

unarticulated “clear Congressional intent,” concluded that “where the ANDA applicant has
prevailed in the paragraph IV patent litigation,” there should be “an exception to the HatchWaxman certification provisions.” FDA Ltr. at 9. This “exception,” according to the FDA,
permits it to continue to treat Apotex’s ANDA as a paragraph IV certification even though the
‘303 patent has expired, unlike any other ANDA.
The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) requires that the “court shall . . . hold
unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”

5 U.S.C.

§ 706(2)(A). The FDA’s decision to reward Apotex with a statutorily unauthorized exception to
pediatric exclusivity violates the plain statutory language and the FDA’s own long-standing,
court-approved regulations and practices. See, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union v.
Federal Labor Relations Authority, 404 F.3d 454, 457-58 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“The Authority’s
failure to follow its own well-established precedent without explanation is the very essence of
arbitrariness.”); id. at 457 (“It is well established that . . . any agency’s ‘unexplained departure
from prior agency determinations’ is inherently arbitrary and capricious in violation of APA §
706(A)(2).”) (quoting American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2761 v. Federal
Labor Relations Authority, 866 F.2d 1443, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1989)); Verizon Telephone
Companies v. FCC, 453 F.3d 487, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“[A]n agency acting consistently with

its prior actions is generally what makes an agency action not arbitrary[.]”); The Greyhound
Corp. v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 551 F.2d 414, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“This court
emphatically requires that administrative agencies adhere to their own precedents or explain any
deviations from them.”).
The FDA’s newly fashioned nonstatutory “Apotex exception” to pediatric exclusivity also
is contrary to Mova Pharm., 140 F.3d at 1060, a case in which the D.C. Circuit held that it is the
first filer, not the first court victor, that receives exclusivity. In Mova, the D.C. Circuit, relying
on Chevron4 “step one” struck down the FDA’s importation into the statute that to receive 180day exclusivity, the ANDA filer must “successfully defend” the patent litigation. See id. at 1069
(“We conclude that the FDA’s successful-defense requirement is inconsistent with the
unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”). This case is Mova all over again. Here again,
the FDA is attempting to read into the plain statutory language a benefit for the first ANDA filer
to obtain a “favorable decision,” even though the statutory language contains no hint of such a
reward. See FDA Ltr. at 8.5

4

Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (“If a court,
employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on
the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.”).
5

The FDA’s unlawful action cannot be justified on the theory that Apotex should receive
a benefit for challenging the ‘303 patent. Any such argument is contrary to Congress’s clear
intent, because Mylan is entitled by statute to a period of exclusivity. In any event, Apotex did
not take any risk in challenging the ‘303 patent. It was Mylan’s defenses that paved the way for
all the subsequent challenges to the ‘303 patent. Those subsequent-filers had the benefit of the
extensive discovery conducted in Mylan’s case. This was particularly so for Apotex, which
adopted wholesale the invalidity and unenforceability defenses that Mylan had already
developed, took extensive (and unacknowledged) advantage of Mylan’s research and written
work product, and even compelled the production of Mylan’s expert reports in its litigation. See
Bloodworth Decl., Exh. I (attaching Apotex’s Motion to Compel the production of Mylan’s
expert reports). The retirement of the district court judge in Mylan’s case and an accompanying
delay resulted in Apotex’s later-filed case going to trial first, and its appeal being decided before
Mylan’s appeal. But it was Mylan that first developed the legal and expert foundations for the
10

The FDA cannot avoid the unambiguous language of the BPCA by hiding behind vague
and unexplained notions of Congressional intent. The FDA litigated Ranbaxy and DRL for the
express purpose of receiving judicial approval of its policy of automatically converting
paragraph IV certifications to paragraph II certifications upon patent expiration. See Ranbaxy,
307 F. Supp. 2d at 19; DRL, 302 F. Supp. 2d at 351. It is arbitrary and capricious for the FDA to
now abandon that policy in order to carry out a statutorily unauthorized goal of rewarding
Apotex at Mylan’s expense.
B.

EVEN IF THE FDA COULD CONTINUE TO TREAT APOTEX’S ANDA AS A
PARAGRAPH IV CERTIFICATION, APOTEX WOULD BE BLOCKED BY MYLAN’S
180-DAY GENERIC EXCLUSIVITY.

If the FDA is correct that Apotex’s ANDA can maintain its paragraph IV certification
despite the expiration of the ‘303 patent, then the plain language of the 180-day exclusivity
provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act precludes the FDA from granting Apotex final approval.
The controlling provision reads6:
If the application contains a certification described in subclause (IV) of paragraph
(2)(A)(vii) and is for a drug for which a previous application has been submitted
under this subsection continuing [sic] such a certification, the application shall be
made effective not earlier than one hundred and eighty days after [generic
exclusivity has been triggered].
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (2002). As the D.C. Circuit has emphasized, the meaning of the
“literal language” of this provision is clear: “Section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) says that, if an applicant
has already filed a paragraph IV ANDA, later applications shall be approved ‘not earlier than one

arguments that led to the Federal Circuit’s decision that claims 1-3 of the ‘303 patent are invalid.
It was mere happenstance – a toss of the coin – that led Apotex to reach the Federal Circuit first.
6

Because Mylan submitted its ANDA with a paragraph IV certification to the ‘303 patent
prior to the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
(“MMA”), Pub. L. No. 108-173 (Dec. 8, 2003), the pre-MMA statute applies. See MMA,
§ 1102(b)(1).

hundred and eighty days after’ the commercial-marketing trigger or the court-decision trigger is
satisfied.” Mova, 140 F.3d at 1069; see also Lamie v. United States Tr., 540 U.S. 526, 534
(2004) (“[W]hen the statute’s language is plain, the sole function of the courts—at least where
the disposition required by the text is not absurd—is to enforce it according to its terms.”
(internal quotations and citations omitted)). Mylan activated the “commercial-marketing trigger”
on March 23, 2007, so it is entitled to 180 days of generic exclusivity against all other paragraph
IV ANDAs. Accordingly, even if Apotex could maintain its paragraph IV certification despite
years of FDA practice to the contrary, Mylan’s 180-day exclusivity still bars Apotex’s approval.
Despite the FDA’s decision to the contrary, nothing in the text or legislative history of the
Hatch-Waxman Act indicates that generic exclusivity is forfeited upon patent expiration. In fact,
Congress adopted the generic exclusivity, inter alia, to encourage generics to file paragraph IV
challenges to the validity of pharmaceutical patents7 and to reward such challengers for their risk

See, e.g., 152 Cong. Rec. S7922, at S7928 (daily ed. July 19, 2006) (statement of Sen.
Leahy) (“[T]he original intent of the Hatch-Waxman law . . . was to provide incentives for
generic companies to challenge the validity of patents on medicines and provide incentives for
generic companies to manufacture low-cost medicines” and “that [a] generic company would
have the exclusive right for 180 days to make the generic version of the patented medicine); 149
Cong. Rec. S15670-03, at S15746 (daily ed. Nov. 24, 2003) (statement of Sen. Schumer)
(“Fourth, the generic provisions revamp the 180-day exclusivity incentive provided in the HatchWaxman Act. Under the act, the first generic drug company to challenge a patent on a brand
drug has the exclusive right to market its drug for 6 months before any other generic can

consumers much quicker access to affordable generic drugs.”); 149 Cong. Rec. S8686-03, at
S8691 (daily ed. June 26, 2003) (statement by Sen. Hatch) (“The Waxman-Hatch law provides
an incentive for generic firms to challenge patents. To encourage generic competitors to pursue
patent challenges in a vigorous fashion, the 1984 law provided 180 days of marketing exclusivity

infringed.”); Proposed Rule, 180-Day Generic Drug Exclusivity for Abbreviated New Drug

an incentive to the first generic maker to expose himself to the risk of costly patent litigation, the
Hatch-Waxman regime provides that the first to file a paragraph IV certified ANDA (“the first
filer”) is eligible for 180-day period of marketing protection, commonly known as the 180-day
exclusivity period (“the Exclusivity Incentive”). By its terms, the Exclusivity Incentive affords
the first filer protection from competition from subsequent generic makers for 180 days
beginning from the earlier of a commercial marketing or court decision.”) (internal citations
omitted)); 54 Fed. Reg. 28872, 28895 (July 10, 1989) (“The purpose of [the 180-day exclusivity
provision] of the act is to reward the first applicant to test the scope or validity of a patent… .”)
(emphasis added)).8 This purpose can only be accomplished if the first filer challenging the
invalid patent is assured of generic exclusivity, regardless of how long the litigation takes. If
potential challengers must consider factors such as the speed of various courts’ dockets, the
possibility that various presiding judges may retire, and other uncontrollable events in deciding
whether to challenge invalid patents, then Congress’s clear intent will be precluded.
Mylan was the first to file under paragraph IV, and it was the first to be sued by Pfizer for
patent infringement. Mylan’s case was delayed due to circumstances outside of its control,
including a lengthy delay cause by a change of trial judges. That resulted in the unique posture
of these cases: Apotex was able to use Mylan’s arguments and expert reports in their litigation
and go to trial first. Mylan took the risk that was recognized by Congress as critical, and it is

purpose of [the 180-day exclusivity provision] of the act is to reward the first applicant to test the
scope or validity of a patent. . . .”).
8

The 180-day exclusivity incentive for the first paragraph IV filer has proved powerful
and productive. According to an FTC report issued in 2002, generic patent challenges have
succeeded in 73% of cases. See Federal Trade Commission, “Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent
Expiration,” July 2002, at 16, available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/07/genericdrugstudy.pdf.

entitled to the reward of generic exclusivity regardless of how long its case took to resolve. The
FDA’s ruling that the 180-day period of generic exclusivity does not survive patent expiration
cannot justify a “departure from the plain meaning of statutory language,” and its reliance on
vague notions of Congressional intent cannot satisfy this “considerable burden.” Mylan Pharms.
Inc., 94 F. Supp. 2d at 55-56; id. (noting that to depart from the plain language of a statute, there
must be a “clear indication of congressional intent at odds with the text of the statute”).
III.

MYLAN WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT IMMEDIATE
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FROM THIS COURT.
The FDA has refused to agree to give this Court any notice prior to approving Apotex’s

ANDA. As a result, Mylan faces the real danger that the Federal Circuit’s mandate will issue
and Apotex’s ANDA will be approved before this Court can consider the merits of Mylan’s
objections. Under this scenario, the Court would be presented with a fait accompli and Mylan
would be denied the opportunity to be heard before the status quo is altered – a result that would
cause Mylan irreparable harm and render the FDA’s action effectively unreviewable. The D.C.
Circuit has emphasized that preliminary injunctive relief is particularly appropriate as a means of
insulating parties from imminent harm when another party threatens to suddenly alter the status
quo in a manner that would deprive another of its rights. See Barrow v. Graham, 124 F. Supp.
2d 714, 716 (D.D.C. 2000) (“In the absence of facts that would enable a court fully to assess the
merits of the parties’ respective positions, a TRO may issue to preserve the status quo and to
prevent imminent harm until a hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction may be
held.”). In this case, FDA’s approval of Apotex’s ANDA upon issuance of the mandate would
drastically and irrevocably change the status quo before Mylan would have an opportunity to
respond.
Moreover, courts have repeatedly recognized that a generic drug manufacturer is
14

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 44-2

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 21 of 26

irreparably harmed when it is wrongfully deprived of its 180-day period of marketing exclusivity
vis-à-vis other generic manufacturers. See Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 955 F. Supp. 128, 131
(D.D.C. 1997) (finding irreparable harm where the FDA deprived a party of its “180-day
statutory grant of exclusivity”); aff’d by 140 F.3d at 1067, n. 6 (confirming that Mova’s loss of
its “‘officially sanctioned head start’ … suffices to show a severe economic impact to Mova,” for
purposes of satisfying the irreparable harm standard); Bracco Diagnostics, Inc. v. Shalala, 963 F.
Supp. 20, 29 (D.D.C. 1997) (granting preliminary injunction and acknowledging that “there is a
significant economic advantage to receiving first approval and being the first company to enter
the market, an advantage that can never be fully recouped through money damages or by
‘playing catch-up’”) (emphasis added); Boehringer Ingelheim Corp. v. Shalala, 993 F. Supp. 1, 2
(D.D.C. 1997) (denying injunctive relief, while recognizing that losing “the advantage of being
the first to market” amounts to significant harm for purposes of balancing hardships).
Mylan will suffer tremendous and irreparable harm if it is deprived of its opportunity to
be heard, and thus its opportunity to protect its 180-day exclusivity rights. Mylan is currently the
only generic drug producer approved to sell amlodipine besylate. If Mylan is deprived – before
having any opportunity to be heard – of its status as exclusive generic producer, it would lose all
of the benefits that it has worked for five years to obtain. Loss of such exclusivity would impair
its access to customers and diminish its ability to establish and retain market share.

Declaration of Brian Roman., ¶ 6; see also, TorPharm Inc. v. Shalala, No. 97-1925, 1997 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 21983, at *13-14 (Sept. 15, 1997) (“early market entry is critical to success in the
… market because competitors will vie for a small number of long-term contracts”).
In addition, since Congress has not allowed the FDA to be sued for the type of decision at
issue here, Mylan will not be able to recoup any monetary damages from the FDA. See United

States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980); see also Komongnan v. United States Marshals
Serv., 471 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2006) (“In the absence of an express waiver, sovereign
immunity precludes suits against the United States and its agencies.”). The “discretionaryfunction exception” of the Federal Tort Claims Act bars any and all claims against the FDA that
are “based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary
function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or
not the discretion involved be abused.” 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a). That Mylan’s economic damages
are unrecoverable more than justifies the limited injunctive relief that it seeks. See, e.g., Express
One Int’l, Inc. v. United States Postal Serv., 814 F. Supp. 87, 91 (D.D.C. 1992) (finding
irreparable harm supported where the “non-recoverable monetary losses [movant] faces are
therefore real and present” and damages exist “for which there is no recourse”); HoffmanLarouche, Inc. v. Califano, 453 F. Supp. 900, 903 (D.D.C. 1978) (noting that “[i]f the order goes
into effect, plaintiff will suffer loss of sales and good will for which it would have no right of
recourse, and thus its injury will be irreparable” (emphasis added)).
IV.

THE BALANCE OF THE RELATIVE HARMS FAVORS ENTRY OF AN
INJUNCTION.
The injunctive relief that Mylan requests is limited in nature. Mylan is asking only that it

be granted the right to be heard before the FDA effectuates any approval of Apotex’s ANDA.
Such limited injunctive relief would harm no other interested party in this case. In fact, such
injunctive relief would provide broad-based benefits to both Mylan and the FDA, since such
relief would guarantee that both parties will have the opportunity to prospectively address the
legality of any change to Apotex’s approval status. Both parties will benefit from the court’s
views on these issues, and both parties will benefit from having these issues resolved before any
change to the status quo is effectuated.
16

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Page 23 of 26

The same principles apply to Apotex and other generic manufacturers, which are legally
precluded from entering the market. As such, these parties will suffer no harm if the FDA is
preliminarily enjoined from approving Apotex's ANDA. This is particularly true in light of the
high likelihood that this Court would find any intervening FDA approval of Apotex’s ANDA to
have been unlawful, thereby necessitating the post-hoc rescission of any such approval. No
party’s interests would be served by the uncertainty and confusion that would result from such an
ultra vires FDA action. Apotex – like the FDA and Mylan – all share an interest in preserving
the status quo pending judicial consideration of the issues raised by this motion.
V.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST WILL BENEFIT FROM AN INJUNCTION
On March 26, 2007, this Court ordered that the FDA could not “grant[] any ANDAs at

issue in this matter” for two days after it had notified the Court of its intended course of action.
The point of this delay was “[t]o ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to advance
their positions to the court on this matter prior to the FDA taking final action on the pending drug
approvals.” The court entered a similar order on April 10. Now, some two weeks later, the
relevant circumstances have not changed.

The public interest again will be served by a

temporary injunction that requires the FDA to provide notice before it approves Apotex’s
ANDA, rendering Mylan’s suit effectively unreviewable and destroying the status quo.
The injunction will allow Mylan to submit a motion that demonstrates why the FDA has
no lawful basis for approving the ANDA. If this Court concludes that Mylan is correct—a result
that is likely for the reasons explained above—it can then prohibit the FDA from issuing the
approval. By enabling the Court to forestall the FDA’s unlawful action, the injunction will
promote the well-recognized public interest in ensuring that federal agencies faithfully comply
with their statutory mandates as prescribed by Congress. See, e.g., Mylan Pharms. Inc. v.

also Jacksonville Port Authority v. Adams, 556 F.2d 52, 59 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“[T]here is an

quoting Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Espy, 814 F. Supp. 142, 152 (D.D.C. 1993). The injunction
likewise will enable this Court to avoid the wasted resources and the potential for public
confusion that would result if the FDA permitted Apotex to begin selling amlodipine besylate
products, only to rescind its approval (and force Apotex to pull its products off the shelves) a few
days later based on the Court’s grant of relief in favor of Mylan.
Finally, the public has a significant interest in “receiving generic competition to brandname drugs as soon as is possible.” Boehringer, 993 F. Supp. at 3. The Hatch-Waxman Act
promotes this interest by giving generic drug makers a vital incentive to “incur the potentially
substantial litigation costs associated with challenging pioneer drug makers’ patents.” Mylan
Pharms. Inc., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 33. That incentive is the 180-day exclusivity period—the very
period that the FDA is attempting to take away in this case. An order requiring the FDA to
provide notice at least forty-eight hours before it acts will protect Congress’s careful and
unmistakable incentive structure by briefly delaying the FDA approval so that Mylan, which has
incurred significant costs in defending its ANDA and which would be irreparably harmed by the
FDA’s unlawful action, receives an opportunity to respond.

CONCLUSION
For these reasons, Mylan seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA from
rendering Mylan’s suit effectively unreviewable and to preserve the status quo.

Mylan

respectfully requests the Court to enjoin the FDA from approving Apotex’s ANDA following
issuance of the Pfizer v. Apotex mandate until Mylan’s claims can be adjudicated on the merits.

Dear ANDA Applicant/Holder for Amlodipine Besylate Tablets :
This letter addresses issues related to the timing of potential approvals of abbreviated new drug
applications (ANDAs) that reference Norvasc tablets . This letter construes the provisions of the
Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (known as the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments or Hatch-Waxman), codified at 21 U .S.C . §§ 355, 360cc, and 35 U .S.C. §§ 156,
271, 282, and does not necessarily apply to changes made in the Medicare Modernization Act
(MMA) of 2003 .'
As you are aware, Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) manufactures and markets Norvasc, a besylate salt of
amlodipine, indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina . Pfizer had listed two
patents with FDA, asserting that they claim Norvasc and would be infringed by the marketing of
generic versions of the product . The later of these patents, Patent No . 4,879,303 ('303 patent),
expired on March 25, 2007, so that these patents, by themselves, no longer bar the marketing
of generic versions of Pfizer's product . Several companies have submitted ANDAs for approval
to market generic versions of Norvasc . Mylan Laboratories, Inc . and Mylan Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Mylan) filed the first ANDA to market a generic version of Norvasc and had challenged
Pfizer's patents by submitting the first "paragraph IV certifications" to those patents with its
application . FDA approved Mylan's ANDA in October 2005, and Mylan began marketing its
product on March 23, 2007 . On or about the same day, Pfizer began marketing a generic
version of Norvasc .
Pfizer and Mylan now contend that the approvals of the other ANDAs for amlodipine besylate
are blocked by Pfizer's "pediatric exclusivity" until September 25, 2007 . Mylan contends,
alternatively, that the approvals of its competitors' ANDAs are blocked by Mylan's "180-day
marketing exclusivity" until September 19, 2007 .2 Resolution of whether pending ANDAs
referencing Norvasc are blocked either by Pfizer's pediatric exclusivity or Mylan's 180-day
exclusivity involves a number of legal issues, some of first impression for the agency . Part of
the analysis requires FDA to determine the effect of a recent Federal Circuit decision in patent
litigation between Pfizer and Apotex Inc . (Apotex), another ANDA applicant for amlodipine
besylate who filed a paragraph IV certification after Mylan had submitted its certification . On
March 22, 2007, the Federal Circuit ruled that the three claims in the '303 patent that Pfizer
asserted that Apotex infringed were invalid as obvious . Pfizer Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., No. 20061261, 2007 U .S. App. LEXIS 6623 (March 22, 2007) (the Apotex decision).
' The 1984 Hatch-Waxman provisions govern most issues related to ANDA approval for amlodipine
besylate tablets . Although certain provisions of Hatch-Waxman have been superseded by changes made
in the MMA, the 180-day exclusivity provisions of the MMA apply only to applications for which the first
ANDA with a paragraph IV certification was filed after December 3, 2003 . Mylan's ANDA was filed before
December 3, 2003, and hence is governed by the pre-MMA provisions with respect to 180-day
exclusivity .
2 Mylan has claimed in its submissions to FDA that its 180-day exclusivity commenced on March 23,
2007 and would expire on September 23, 2007 . See Petition for Stay of Action, Docket 2006P-01 16
(March 26, 2007) (http :/lwww .fda .aov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07p0116/07q-0116-psa0001-01-vo11 od_O .
However, 180 days after March 23 is September 19 .

ANDA 76-418

Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Attention: S. Wayne Talton
781 Chestnut Ridge Road
P.O. Box 4310
Morgantown, WV 26504-4310
Dear Mr. Talton:
This letter is in reference to your approved ANDA for amlodipine besylate tablets. As you may
be aware, on March 26, 2007, Mylan Laboratories, Inc. filed a complaint against the Food and
Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking to enjoin FDA from immediately approving abbreviated
new drug applications for amlodipine besylate products. Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Michael
Leavitt, CA No. 07-579 (RMU) (D.D.C.). Because the recent developments in the amlodipine
besylate patent litigation (in particular, the Federal Circuit’s March 22, 2007 decision in Pfizer
Inc. v Apotex, Inc., No. 2006-1261 (Fed. Cir. March 22, 2007)) presented several regulatory
issues that need to be resolved before any applications could be approved, FDA informed the
court (in CA No. 07-579) that it planned to solicit comments from interested parties before it
reached decisions on the matters that Mylan sought to enjoin. The court has memorialized
FDA’s proposal, and enjoined the agency from implementing its decisions once made, until 5:00
pm on April 13, 2007, to allow the court the opportunity to review the FDA decisions. Mylan
Laboratories, CA No. 07-579, Order (March 26, 2007).
The FDA is considering the following questions. Should you wish to comment on them, your
response will be posted at http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Other submissions relevant to
these issues will also be posted at this address. Please send your response, if any, by close of
business on April 4, 2007 to:
Food and Drug Administration
Office of Generic Drugs, HFD-600
Attention: Gary J. Buehler, Director
7519 Standish Place
Rockville, MD 20855
1.
What date controls FDA’s giving effect to the decision in Pfizer Inc. v Apotex, Inc., No.
2006-1261 (Fed. Cir. March 22, 2007) (“Apotex decision”) holding that Pfizer’s patent 4,879,303
(“the ‘303 patent”) is invalid? Can FDA treat the ‘303 patent as invalid as of March 22, 2007, or
must FDA await the issuance of the mandate? Is the answer the same for all purposes, that is, for
determining the applicability of pediatric exclusivity, the triggering of 180-day exclusivity, and
the eligibility of other ANDA applicants for final approval?

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 44-4

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 43 of 50

2.
If FDA must await the issuance of the mandate, does pediatric exclusivity bar approval of
all unapproved ANDAs in the meantime?
3.
If and when the Apotex decision is implemented, what is the effect of the decision that the
‘303 patent is invalid on the obligation of an ANDA applicant to change its certification? Must
Pfizer delist its patent, so that certifications can be withdrawn? Or can FDA treat an invalid
patent as delisted as a matter of law, and presume the withdrawal of the certifications? Or must
the ANDA applicants file paragraph II certifications stating that the ‘303 patent has expired?
4.
If and when the Apotex decision is implemented and the patent is treated as invalid, does
pediatric exclusivity attach to the ‘303 patent with respect to any unapproved ANDAs? Does it
matter whether the ANDA applicant filed a paragraph III or IV certification before patent
expiration?
5.
Does 180-day exclusivity triggered before a patent expires continue to bar approvals of
other ANDAs after the patent expires, even if other ANDA applicants change their certifications
to paragraph II or withdraw their certifications altogether?
We note that several citizen petitions have been submitted that also raise issues relevant to
approval of ANDAs for products containing amlodipine. The petition docket numbers are:
2007P-0116, submitted by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc; 2007P-0110 and 2007P-0111 submitted
by Pfizer Inc. If you believe your comments are also relevant to consideration of those petitions,
you may submit your comments to the petitions dockets as well. In addition, FDA may consider
relevant comments received in this context when answering the petitions.
Thank you for your consideration of these questions. If you have any questions regarding this
letter, please contact Cecelia Parise, Regulatory Policy Advisor to the Director, Office of Generic
Drugs, at 240-276-9310.
Sincerely,

Gary J. Buehler
