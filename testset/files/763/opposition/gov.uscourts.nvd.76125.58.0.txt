INTRODUCTION

2

Righthaven LLC (“Righthaven”) has, with a third revision of its Strategic Alliance

3

Agreement with Stephens Media LLC (“Stephens Media”), attempted again to mask its lack of an

4

adequate interest to bring claims as an agent for enforcement of others’ copyrights. But this third

5

time is no charm. This Court has repeatedly determined that Righthaven lacks standing and that

6

Stephens Media was the real party in interest with respect to the hundreds of copyright actions

7

Righthaven has filed in this district. This Court has rejected the original Strategic Alliance

8

Agreement (Dkt. 26 Exh. 2) (“SAA”) as “disingenuous,” and noted that the “Clarification” (Id.

9

Exh. 3) was no such thing, but rather an effort to cloak an unlawful delegation of the right to sue

10

through cosmetic changes. Yet Righthaven still refuses to recognize that its right to commence

11

these actions has been decided, and that its rights cannot be resurrected by any amount of further

12

“clarification” or “restatement” of agreements purporting—after this Court’s deliberations—to

13

redefine retroactively Righthaven’s ownership rights for the last year and a half.

14

While Righthaven doubtless is disappointed, the reality is that Righthaven, LLC v. Hoehn,

15

2:11-cv-00050-PMP, 2011 WL 2441020 (D. Nev. June 20, 2011), Righthaven, LLC v. DiBiase,

16

No. 2:10-cv-01343-RLH, 2011 WL 2473531 (D. Nev. June 22, 2011) and Righthaven, LLC v.

17

Mostofi, No 2:10-cv-01066-KJD-GWF, 2011 WL 2746315 (D. Nev. July 13, 2011), have each

18

been reduced to a judgment. Each therefore subjects Righthaven to issue preclusion as to its

19

standing to sue on the SAA, and as to its inability to cure its lack of standing by amendment. See

20

Clements v. Airport Auth. of Washoe County, 69 F.3d 321, 330 (9th Cir. 1995) (issue

21

preclusion—formerly known as collateral estoppel—bars “the re-litigation of any issue that has

22

been actually litigated and necessarily decided”). Moreover, the June 14 Order in Righthaven,

23

LLC v. Democratic Underground, No. 2:10-cv-01356-RLH-GWF, 2011 WL 2378186 (D. Nev.

24

June 14, 2011)—holding that Righthaven’s subsequent amendments could not resurrect its

25

claim—was specifically adopted as the reasoning for the dismissal of DiBiase. The Democratic

26

Underground decision thus further precludes relitigation of these issues.

CASE NO. 2:10-cv-01575-JCM (PAL)

Case 2:10-cv-01575-JCM -PAL Document 58

Accordingly, as a starting point for any analysis, amici Democratic Underground, Citizens

1
2

against Litigation Abuse, and Professor Jason Shultz note that following issues have been

3

conclusively determined and are not in dispute:

4



“[T]he SAA in its original form qualifies the Assignment with restrictions or
rights of reversion, such that in the end, Righthaven is not left with ownership
of any exclusive rights.” Hoehn, 2011 WL 2441020, at *5.



“[T]he SAA prevents Plaintiff from obtaining any of the exclusive rights
necessary to maintain standing in a copyright infringement action.” Mostofi,
2011 WL 2746315, at *5.



“Righthaven and Stephens Media went to great lengths in the SAA to be sure
that Righthaven did not obtain any rights other than the bare right to sue.
Thus, the Court finds that the plain language of the SAA conveys the intent to
deprive Righthaven of any right, save for the right to sue alleged infringers and
profit from such lawsuits.” Democratic Underground, 2011 WL 2378186, at
*4.



“Righthaven and Stephens Media may have wanted Righthaven to be able to
sue, but the SAA was anything but silent in making sure that Stephens Media
retained complete control over the Work rather than actually effectuate the
necessary transfer of rights. The entirety of the SAA is concerned with making
sure that Righthaven did not obtain any rights other than the right to sue.” Id.
at *5.



“[T]he SAA makes abundantly clear [that] Stephens Media retained the
exclusive rights, never actually transferring them to Righthaven.” Id. at *6
(emphasis original).



The prior orders on motions to dismiss in this district that found standing based
upon the assignment alone “were tainted by Righthaven's failure to disclose the
SAA and Stephens Media’s true interest.” Id. at *6.1



The May 9 Clarification “cannot create standing because “’[t]he existence of
federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the
complaint is filed.’” 2011 WL 2746315, at *3; see also Democratic
Underground, 2011 WL 2378186, at *4; Hoehn, 2011 WL 2441020, at *6.



“Righthaven and Stephens Media attempt to impermissibly amend the facts to
manufacture standing. Therefore, the Court shall not consider the amended
language of the SAA, but the actual transaction that took place as of the time
the complaint was filed.” Democratic Underground, 2011 WL 2378186, at *4;
Mostofi, 2011 WL 2746315, at *3.



The “May 9, 2011 Clarification ... does not provide Righthaven with any
exclusive rights necessary to bring suit.” Hoehn, 2011 WL 2441020, at *6.

CASE NO. 2:10-cv-01575-JCM (PAL)

Case 2:10-cv-01575-JCM -PAL Document 58

Given these determinations, the simple answer to this Court’s order to show cause is that

1
2

dismissal of Righthaven’s present actions is mandated by the doctrine of issue preclusion

3

(collateral estoppel). Righthaven cannot relitigate the conclusions of Judge Hunt, Judge Pro and

4

Judge Dawson that the SAA did not provide standing and that this failing cannot be cured after

5

the fact. Judgment should be entered now in the current cases, and the defendants should proceed

6

with any request for fees and costs.
The slightly more complicated issue is whether Righthaven is precluded not only from

SAN FRANCISCO

7

8

continuing with its present actions, but also from filing new ones attempting the same claims

9

against the same defendants, but based on repackaged documentation. The answer is that

10

Righthaven may not relitigate these issues in subsequent cases, and this Court should so hold to

11

stop a senseless proliferation of lawsuits that require defendants to answer the same tired

12

arguments.
Righthaven continues to claim that it and Stephens Media may avoid these adverse rulings

13
14

by collusively re-characterizing its agency relationship in as many contradictory and inconsistent

15

ways as they want – including describing their relationship and intentions as exactly the opposite

16

of what this Court found to be the truth. Nonsense. These freewheeling re-characterizations,

17

regardless of the realities of Righthaven and Stephens Media’s relationship, show how superficial

18

their entire “assignment” construct is. It would make a mockery of this Court’s process to adopt

19

the pretense that Righthaven now is suddenly in the business of owning and licensing exclusive

20

rights in copyrights, rather than merely suing on them, when it has done, and is empowered to do,

21

nothing else. This is especially true given Righthaven’s established history of false representation

22

as to the nature of its relationship and Righthaven’s authority. Declaration of Clifford Webb,

23

attaching as Exh. 1 the transcript of Judge Hunts ruling at the July 14, 2011 sanctions hearing in

24

Democratic Underground (“DU OSC Ruling”) at 15 (“The representations about the relationship

25

and the right of Righthaven were misrepresentations. They were misleading”)2. Righthaven

Righthaven was required by Judge Hunt’s July 14th ruling on the Order to Show Cause in the Democratic
Underground matter to submit the transcript of that oral ruling in each case it has filed in this district. DU OSC
Ruling at 22. Amici submit this copy of the transcript until such a time as Righthaven complies with that order.

F ENWICK & W EST LLP

4

unlawful nature of its relationship with Stephens Media, in either of two respects. See Dkt. 57-1.

5

First, this Court has already held that it was Righthaven’s intent not to receive any rights other

6

than the right to share in the proceeds of another’s legal claims—a relationship that, by definition,

7

constitutes champerty, an illegal practice under Nevada law. Democratic Underground, 2011

8

WL 2378186, at *3 (“In reality, Righthaven actually left the transaction with nothing more than a

9

fabrication since a copyright owner cannot assign a bare right to sue after Silvers. To approve of

10

such a transaction would require the Court to disregard the clear intent of the transaction and the

11

clear precedent set forth by the en banc Ninth Circuit in Silvers”). Ex post facto amendments

12

cannot obscure the champertous nature of Righthaven’s pursuit of Stephens Media’s claims:

13

Righthaven’s agreements and assignments with Stephens Media are therefore an illegal nullity

14

that can never form the basis for Righthaven to sue.
Second, as persuasively argued by Amicus Citizens against Litigation Abuse,

15
16

Righthaven’s scheme constitutes the unlawful, unauthorized practice of law. Indeed, Judge Hunt

17

expressed that conclusion in his detailed sanctioning Righthaven for intentionally misleading the

18

Court. OSC Ruling at 14 (holding that Righthaven is nothing “but a law firm with a contingent

19

fee agreement masquerading as a company that’s a party”). For this reason too, Righthaven’s

20

agreements and assignments with Stephens Media would have to be disregarded, and its claims

21

dismissed—even assuming no Court had ever previously entered judgment against it.

22

Accordingly, Amici respectfully urge the Court to dismiss the instant action, and in doing so,

23

make clear that no subsequent action based on the SAA may be pursued by Righthaven.

25

Righthaven’s inability to create jurisdiction and standing after the fact is, of course, no

15

less true with its third attempt, the July 7, 2011 Restated SAA, than it was with its second, the

16

May 9, 2011 Clarification. As the above decisions have recognized, the existence of standing

17

depends on the jurisdictional facts as they exist at the time the complaint is filed. See Lujan v.

18

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 571 n.4 (1992) (citing quoting Newman-Green, 490 U.S. at

830). And while a deficient allegation of jurisdiction can be corrected, the facts themselves

20

cannot be changed. Thus, while a litigant may be able to amend to correct a misstatement of their

21

domicile, it may not move to change that domicile to create jurisdiction. Newman-Green, 490

22

U.S. at 830; see also Democratic Underground, 2011 WL 2378186, at *4.3
Here, changing the facts is precisely what Righthaven and Stephens Media have attempted

24

to do—or, more appropriately, attempted to create the appearance of doing. They have sought to

25

entirely reorder the rights actually granted in the SAA to Righthaven to, as they put it, “address

disguises might cause less concern. The Restated SAA pretends to create control in Righthaven,

2

when in reality no such control exists. It purports now to keep for Stephens Media only a “non-

retained the exclusive license in all rights (SAA ¶ 7.2). Similarly, the Restated SAA claims to

Even if genuine, this kind of revisionism could not manufacture jurisdiction or a valid

The Restated SAA Cannot Mask the True Role of Righthaven as a Mere
Hired Gun.

Even were Righthaven theoretically able to cure its standing defect after the fact, which it

12

legally cannot, its course of conduct with Stephens Media overwhelms any possible argument that

13

revisionist documentation is sufficient to comply with Silvers. Plaintiff’s repapering of its deal

14

with its 50% owner to assert status as an owner of its owner’s copyright, rather than as a hired

16

For over a year and a half, Righthaven has operated purely as the agent of Stephens

17

Media. See Democratic Underground, 2011 WL 2378186, at *7 (noting agency relationship). In

18

addition to having to share 50% of all proceeds with Stephens Media, the remaining 50% flows

Even the Restated SAA provides in no uncertain terms that it was created because this

5

Court “held that the SAA and Amendment were insufficient to transfer sufficient copyright

6

ownership to Righthaven such that it had standing to sue for infringement.” Restated SAA at 1

7

(emphasis added). This third rewriting of the SAA, by its terms, was not motivated by a desire to

8

actually empower Righthaven to do anything other than sue; rather, it was motivated by a desire

9

to provide a patina for a claim of adequacy under Silvers. As Righthaven’s own witness declared,

10

(Dkt. 27), the parties’ intent is to preserve “Stephens Media’s ability to continue to display or

11

otherwise use the assigned content through the grant of a license from Righthaven.” Hinueber

12

Decl. (Dkt. 27) at ¶ 6; see also Gibson Decl. (Dkt. 26) at ¶ 13. In short, Stephens Media wants to

13

maintain its ownership, as if the SAA did not change a thing but the right to sue.

14

The Restated SAA is just another attempt by contract to accomplish this illegal objective.

15

Most tellingly, the fundamental premise of the Restated SAA is one this Court has already found

16

to be false. It recites that “the intent of the Parties in entering in the SAA and Amendment was to

17

convey all ownership rights in and to any identified Work to Righthaven . . . .” Restated SAA, at

18

1; see also id.§ 8 (incorporating recitals as substantive terms). Yet this Court has already found

19

that “the plain language of the SAA conveys the intent to deprive Righthaven of any right, save

20

for the right to sue alleged infringers and profit from such lawsuits.” Democratic Underground,

21

2011 WL 2378186, at *4, adopted by DiBiase, 2011 WL 2473531, at *1. Righthaven and

22

Stephens Media cannot, by a wave of the pen, change their past intentions to the opposite of what

23

this Court adjudicated, let alone comply with Silvers retroactively by doing so.

24

Just as transparently, the Restated SAA creates bizarre contradictions with its

25

predecessors. These range beyond the mutating grants of licenses back from Righthaven to

26

Stephens Media—a grant first labeled “exclusive,” then “clarified” to be “non-exclusive” but with

27

Stephens Media retaining a veto over every subsequent license by Righthaven, and now, in the

28

Restated SAA, purportedly erasing that veto.

As an initial matter, the Restated SAA shows that the now defunct Clarification was

2

nothing more than a bad faith attempt to dig out of the deep well created by Righthaven’s original

3

non-disclosure of the SAA. Take, for example, the Clarification’s $1 per year licensing fee

4

payable by Stephens Media. Righthaven and Stephens Media inserted this provision into the

5

Clarification, claiming it reflected the parties’ intent all along. See e.g. Righthaven Response to

6

OSC (Dkt. 25) at 14 (claiming the Clarification’s purpose was to “clarify and effectuate, to the

7

extent not already accomplished, what has at all times been the intent of the parties.”).

8

Righthaven did not explain why the parties’ supposed intent to have a license fee was overlooked

9

in drafting the first version. The likely explanation: this provision was a fiction, designed solely

10

to gin up the subsequent argument that Righthaven was the “beneficial owner,” and therefore

11

entitled to sue. See Righthaven Response to OSC (Dkt. 25) at 9.6 Given that the provision has

12

now disappeared, and there is no evidence any royalties were ever paid, it is difficult to see it as

13

anything other than an attempt to fool the Court into accepting a fiction and then issuing a

14

decision premised on it.
Likewise, under the Clarification, the parties asserted that it “would cause Stephens Media

15
16

irreparable harm” if Righthaven exploited any copyrighted work by granting even one license to

17

which Stephens did not approve. Clarification ¶ 7.2. As Judge Pro summarized, under the

18

Clarification, “Stephens Media may obtain injunctive relief against Righthaven to prevent such

19

‘irreparable harm’ and, pursuant to the Clarification, Righthaven has no right to oppose Stephens

20

Media’s request for injunctive relief.” Hoehn, 2011 WL 2441020, at *6. Since Righthaven’s

21

entering into competing licenses could present a serious problem for Stephens Media’s

22

exploitation, Stephens Media was quite concerned and required a right to reject every license.

23

But now Righthaven wants this Court to believe that Stephens Media will exercise no sway over

24

Righthaven’s rights to license anyone and everyone—that is, that Stephens Media would have no

25

problem with such “irreparable” harm. This is so even though the Amended SAA had such a

26

strong provision and the original “SAA was anything but silent in making sure that Stephens

Media retained complete control over the Work rather than actually effectuate the necessary

transfer of rights. The entirety of the SAA is concerned with making sure that Righthaven did not

*5. That the parties to the SAA can so blithely recast their agreement, disregarding all the

5

purported economics, to try to establish Righthaven’s right to sue, overwhelmingly demonstrates

6

that singular objective.
The Restated SAA is also replete with internal contradictions. Despite the purported

ATTORNEYS AT LAW

7

F ENWICK & W EST LLP

Filed 07/20/11 Page 17 of 26

8

change in ownership of the copyright, Stephens Media may still maintain its funding

9

securitization. Restated SAA ¶ 5. Apparently, Stephens Media has used its copyrights as

10

collateral for financing, and needs this provision to avoid problems with its lenders. However,

11

the Restated SAA’s contractual fancy dancing cannot avoid the fundamental problem: “a

12

mortgage ... or any other ... hypothecation of a copyright” is a “transfer of copyright ownership.”

13

17 U.S.C. § 101. And this is something that a non-exclusive licensee cannot do, even with the

14

licensors’ permission.
Several other provisions of the original SAA remain curiously unchanged. Pursuant to

15
16

Section 9.4, Stephens Media still might settle an infringement action. Section 10.2 still

17

contemplates that a “Recovery Instrument” might be in Stephens Media’s name. Section 11 still

18

acknowledges that Stephens Media may be liable for attorneys’ fees for an infringement action.

19

The unchanged provisions, of course, reflect the truth underlying the transaction: that Stephens

20

Media is the true owner.
Silvers requires that the Court look beyond formal recitations to practical reality of the

21
22

relationship between the parties. See Nafal v. Carter, 540 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1144 (C.D. Cal.

2007) (rejecting standing for a “glorified non-exclusive licensee” noting that court’s cannot

24

“ignore[] reality” in the application of Silvers nor accept “formalistic labels” attached by the

25

parties). No matter what Righthaven and Stephens Media attempt to conjure up with this or any

26

“amendment,” it cannot change the true fact, already determined by this Court, that Stephens

27

Media is the real party in interest and the only party with any actual ability to exploit the assigned

works.

Amici do not make this accusation lightly, recognizing that fraud on the court “embraces

only that species of fraud which does or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud

14

perpetrated by officers of the court.” Appling v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 340 F.3d 769,

15

780 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing In re Levander, 180 F.3d 1114, 1119 (9th Cir. 1999)). A party’s failure

16

to disclose information, or even a party’s perjury, does not ordinarily constitute fraud on the

court. Id. However, “when false evidence or testimony is provided under oath, knowingly and

disclose Stephens Media’s direct pecuniary interest in this and its hundreds of other cases in this

23

district or presenting “multiple inaccurate and likely dishonest statements to the Court.”

Case 2:10-cv-01575-JCM -PAL Document 58

1

Led by Steven Gibson (Righthaven’s CEO and member of the Nevada bar), Righthaven

2

cooked up a scheme to defile the integrity of the Court by manufacturing a false “Assignment”

3

form to present to litigants and the courts. Not only was it designed to mislead, it in fact did

4

mislead “the district judges of this district to believe that it was the true owner of the copyright in

5

the relevant news articles.” Democratic Underground, 2011 WL 2378186, at *6. As a result, the

6

prior orders in this district finding standing based upon the assignment alone “were tainted by

7

Righthaven’s failure to disclose the SAA and Stephens Media’s true interest.” Id. at *6; see also

8

Sanctions Minute Order (Dkt. 138) (holding that “there is a significant amount of evidence that

9

Righthaven made intentional misrepresentations to the Court and also engaged in a concerted

10

effort to hide Stephens Media's role in this litigation.”).7
This Court has held that “the plain language of the SAA conveys the intent to deprive

12

Righthaven of any right, save for the right to sue alleged infringers and profit from such

13

lawsuits.” Id. at *4. Accordingly, as of January 2010 when they entered the SAA, the parties

14

intended to convey only the right to sue, in contravention of Silvers. Righthaven has admitted,

15

however, that it knew about the Silvers rule. It claimed that “the manner in which the [SAA] was

16

drafted accounted for Silvers and any other relevant legal authorities.” Righthaven, LLC v.

17

Democratic Underground, No. 2:10-cv-01356-RLH-GWF, Dkt. 78 at 6. The SAA was an

18

intentional effort to circumvent Silvers’ clear mandate.
Rather than argue for a change in the law, Righthaven instead made, as Judge Hunt

19
20

determined, a “concerted effort to hide Stephens Media’s role in this litigation” using both a

21

“consistent, repeated failure to identify Stephens Media as having any interest in” the lawsuits,

22

and making representations that were “intentionally untrue.” OSC Ruling at 15-16. The

23

“Copyright Assignment” speaks vaguely of unidentified “monetary commitments and

24

commitment to services provided” (Dkt. 26 Exh. 1) rather than disclosing that Stephens Media

25

got 50% of the proceeds. Moreover, the “Copyright Assignment” characterized itself as a transfer

26
27
28

7

Nevertheless, Righthaven continues to cite to these fraudulently obtained opinions. See e.g. Righthaven v.
Newsblaze, Case No. 11-cv-00720-RCJ–GWF, Righthaven Response to Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 13) at 11-12 (filed

As explained by Amicus Democratic Underground elsewhere, “[t]he purpose of this

design is obvious. In litigation, Righthaven could and did trot out a copy of the one-page

consistently refused to produce the [SAA] agreement.”)

11

More insidiously, this design takes advantage of the economics of nuisance litigation. As

12

Judge Hunt also recognized, “Righthaven and Stephens Media have attempted to create a cottage

13

industry of filing copyright claims, making large claims for damages and then settling claims for

14

pennies on the dollar.” Democratic Underground, Order on Motion to Reconsider (Dkt. 94) at 2;

15

see also Righthaven, LLC v. Hill, Case No. 1:11-cv-00211-JLK, Dkt. 16 at 2 (D. Colo. April 7,

16

2011) (“Plaintiff’s wishes to the contrary, the courts are not merely tools for encouraging and

22

courts.”)

23

Righthaven knew that, before anyone could get to the SAA and challenge its scheme, the

24

defendant would need to file a responsive pleading, hold a Rule 26 conference, exchange initial

25

disclosures, issue requests for the production of documents, negotiate a protective order, meet and

Righthaven’s efforts to “needlessly increase[] the costs of litigation.” Democratic Underground,

4

actions and uncover the SAA, Righthaven may well have continued its unlawful scheme

5

indefinitely.
Against this background, it becomes obvious that Restated SAA is not a candid expression

SAN FRANCISCO

Filed 07/20/11 Page 21 of 26

7

of its subscribers intent, but an after-the-fact attempt to create new fictional “evidence” that

8

simply says whatever Righthaven thinks will avoid the judgments against it. The Restated SAA

9

seeks to perpetuate, in fact, to revitalize Righthaven’s fraud by denying its victims the dismissals

10

of Righthaven’s claims that they deserve. It seeks to undo the rulings of this Court based on the

11

pretense that Stephens Media and Righthaven supposedly intended to convey all rights to

12

Righthaven from the beginning (see SAA Recitals)—an assertion 180 degrees from the truth

13

already settled by this Court’s adjudication. While Stephens Media and Righthaven continue to

14

behave as they always have, and the true nature of their transaction is not substantively changed,

15

they hope that they can keep massaging the wording of the SAA until they find the magic words

16

that turn Silvers into an empty letter. This Court need not be an accomplice to that mission.
Accordingly, Righthaven’s fraud on the courts provides an independent basis for

17
18

dismissal. While “dismissal is so harsh a penalty [that] it should be imposed only in extreme

19

circumstances,” Wyle, 709 F. 2d at 589, Righthaven’s fraud upon this Court presents such a

20

circumstance. Righthaven’s fraud goes directly to the merits of the action: the ownership of the

21

copyright at work. Righthaven’s “conduct demonstrated Righthaven's bad faith, wasted judicial

22

resources, and needlessly increased the costs of litigation.” Democratic Underground, Sanctions

23

Minute Order (Dkt. 138). More importantly, Righthaven’s Restated SAA continues its attempt to

24

subvert the integrity of the Courts, thus allowing this Court to dismiss with prejudice and to deny

25

leave to amend or commence a new action.

Now, as ever, under the Restated SAA, Righthaven’s conduct squarely fits this definition.

5

Just as before, Righthaven began with no genuine interest in any alleged infringement of the

6

Review-Journal article—no one disputes this point. Further, Righthaven has undertaken Stephens

7

Media’s copyright litigation at its own expense. See SAA ¶ 6 (“Righthaven shall be responsible

8

for all Costs incurred in an Infringement Action.”) (unchanged by Restated SAA). Again, this is

9

undisputed. Third, Righthaven has done so with the expectation of receiving a part of the

10

litigation proceeds in the event of success. SAA ¶ 5 (providing Righthaven a 50% split of the

11

Recovery (less costs), unchanged by Restated SAA). Likewise, undisputed. As an unlawful and

12

champertous agreement under Nevada law, Righthaven and Stephens Media’s Restated SAA is

13

void and cannot confer standing.

14

That the Restated SAA now purports to convey an ownership interest in the copyrights

15

free of some of the restrictions of its predecessor drafts does not change the champerty analysis.

16

The most recent amendment is merely the next instrument designed to accomplish the

17

champertous scheme. As Righthaven admits, it executed this latest Restated SAA in an effort to

18

empower Righthaven to sue because this Court rejected its standing before, and for no other

19

reason. Restated SAA at 1. Executing a document designed to assist a champertous scheme to

20

comply with Silvers makes it no less champertous, and no less illegal. Indeed, if a champertous

21

scheme could, once challenged, be immunized by mid-stream reallocation of interests between

22

the parties, the doctrine would be essentially nugatory: the parties could always reallocate

23

ownership after the fact and accomplish thereby their illegal objective.

The Restated SAA Amounts to an Illegal Attempt to Practice Law Without a

Independently, as has been persuasively argued by Amicus Citizens against Litigation

illegal as constituting the unauthorized practice of law. See generally Dkt. 48-1. Under the

1

Restated SAA, as with the previous SAA and Clarification, Righthaven remains, in essence, a law

2

firm taking cases on a contingency fee basis, masquerading as a business. Id. at 4-13.

3

Righthaven takes an “assignment” from Stephens Media for a 50% share in recovery. That

4

“assignment” however is an assignment only in name—actually constituting nothing but an illicit

5

contingency fee agreement. This exact arrangement has been repeatedly rejected by courts across

6

the country as illegal; it cannot form the basis for standing here. Id.

7

Judge Hunt recognized this point in this recent order imposing Sanctions in the

8

Democratic Underground case. DU OSC Ruling at 14 (“In the Court’s view, the arrangement

9

between Righthaven and Stephens Media is nothing more nor less than a law firm, which

10

incidentally, I don’t this is licensed to practice law in this state, but a law firm with a contingent

11

fee agreement masquerading as a company that’s a party”). A law firm may not lawfully take

12

cases from its clients to sue on them in its own name. See, e.g., Bay County Bar Ass’n. v. Finance

13

Sys., Inc., 345 Mich. 434 (1956). For a law firm to do so without even qualifying to practice is

14

doubly illegal.10

15

The illegal nature of Righthaven’s relationship with Stephens Media thus provides not

16

only a basis to dismiss the present action, but to preclude any future claims based on the SAA,

17

however it might be amended.

18

IV.

19

RIGHTHAVEN’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND SHOULD BE DENIED AS
FUTILE AND ABUSIVE.

20

Righthaven’s Motion for Leave to Amend should also be denied. First, it is premised

21

entirely on flawed conclusion that its Restated SAA can manufacture standing in this action.

22

However, as explained above, no amendment can cure Righthaven’s lack of standing at the

23

initiation of this suit, and accordingly leave to amend is futile. Saul v. United States, 928 F.2d

24

829, 843 (9th Cir. 1991) (district court does not abuse its discretion when it denies leave to amend

25
