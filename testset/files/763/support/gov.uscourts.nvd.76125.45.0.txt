MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I.

INTRODUCTION
Righthaven seeks leave to amend its complaint in order to correct any defects in standing that

3
4

exist under the original complaint. Leave to amend is liberally granted, and as explained below,

5

courts routinely grant leave to amend in order to cure defects in standing. Further, the additional

6

allegations in the amended complaint are limited to Righthaven’s ownership of the copyright at issue

7

and its standing to sue; thus, the amended complaint would relate back to the date of the original

8

filing of the complaint, mooting the standing issue. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c). For these reasons,

9

Righthaven’s motion for leave to amend should be granted.

10

II.

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS
Righthaven filed its complaint for copyright infringement against the defendants1 on August

11
12

14, 2010 (Doc. # 1). Defendants answered the complaint (Doc. # 9) and moved for summary

13

judgment (Doc. # 12). In its April 28, 2011 order denying summary judgment, the Court issued an

14

order to show cause why Righthaven’s complaint should not be dismissed for lack of standing.

15

(Doc. # 21 (“Order”).) In the Order, the Court expressed concern that Righthaven lacked standing to

16

sue under the Strategic Alliance Agreement (“SAA”) between Righthaven and Stephens Media. (Id.

17

at 2.) Since the Court’s Order, the parties, as well as amici, have submitted briefing on the standing

18

issue. The hearing for the Court’s Order is currently set for June 30, 2011. (Doc. # 38.)
Subsequent to the filing of Righthaven’s complaint, and the Court’s Order, Righthaven and

19
20

Stephens Media executed the Clarification and Amendment to Strategic License Agreement

21

(“Amendment”) in order to clarify the parties’ intentions regarding copyright assignments to

22

Righthaven and to eliminate Stephens Media’s right of reversion and convert its right to use an

23

assigned copyright to a mere non-exclusive license. (Doc. # 26, Ex. 3.) As explained in detail in

24

Righthaven’s Omnibus Response to the Amicus Curiae Briefs of Democratic Underground and

25

Professor Jason Schultz (Doc. # 44), there is no doubt that under the recently executed Amendment,

26

Righthaven is the assignee and current owner of the copyrighted work at issue in this case and has

27

standing to sue for infringement.

28

1

For ease of reference, Righthaven refers to “defendants” both individually and collectively.

Case 2:10-cv-01575-JCM -PAL Document 45

Filed 06/23/11 Page 3 of 6

Notwithstanding Righthaven’s present copyright ownership under the Amendment, another

2

court in this District has held that because Righthaven lacked standing under the original SAA, its

3

complaint must be dismissed because standing did not exist at the inception of the lawsuit.

4

Righthaven LLC v. Democratic Underground, LLC, Doc. # 116, Case. No. 2:10-cv-01356-RLH-

5

GWF (D. Nev.) (Hunt, J.). In light of this decision, and to resolve any lingering procedural defect in

6

Righthaven’s standing under the original complaint, Righthaven has filed the instant motion for

7

leave to file an amended complaint that alleges its copyright ownership under the Amendment. In

8

accordance with Local Rule 15-1, Righthaven has attached its proposed amended complaint to this

9

motion.

III.

ARGUMENT
A party may seek leave of the court to amend its pleadings, and “[t]the court should freely

12

give leave when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Further, “the filing of a supplemental

13

pleading is an appropriate mechanism for curing numerous possible defects in a complaint.” Franks

14

v. Ross, 313 F.3d 184, 198-99 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing Wilson v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 838 F.2d

15

286 (8th Cir. 1988) (concluding that the plaintiff’s amended complaint cured ripeness defect in

16

original complaint); Lynam v. Livingston, 257 F. Supp. 520, 525 (D. Del. 1966) (explaining that

17

plaintiff was entitled to supplement complaint to demonstrate that she had made mandatory demand

18

upon corporation and thereby had standing to bring stockholder derivative suit); Ridgeway v. Int’l

19

Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 466 F. Supp. 595 (N.D. Ill. 1979) (allowing amendment to add party in order

20

to cure defect in Title VII claim); Bates v. W. Elec., 420 F. Supp. 521 (E.D. Pa. 1976) (permitting

21

plaintiffs to file amended complaint to demonstrate that, subsequent to filing of initial complaint,

22

they complied with jurisdictional prerequisites of Title VII)).

23

Courts routinely allow parties to file amended complaints in order to cure standing defects

24

existing in the original complaints. See, e.g., Bushnell, Inc. v. Brunton Co., 659 F. Supp. 2d 1150,

25

1160 (D. Kan. 2009) (granting leave to amend complaint to cure standing defect existing at inception

26

of lawsuit and noting that a dismissal of the case would waste judicial resources); Northstar Fin.

27

Advisors, Inc. v. Schwab Inv., 2011 WL 1312044, at *3-4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2011) (finding that

28

amending complaint after patent assignment to plaintiffs cured prior standing defect and that
2

Case 2:10-cv-01575-JCM -PAL Document 45

Filed 06/23/11 Page 4 of 6

1

dismissal of case would elevate form over substance); Travelers Ins. Co. v. 633 Third Assoc., 973

2

F.2d 82, 87-88 (2d Cir. 1992) (granting plaintiff leave to file a supplemental pleading incorporating

3

events occurring after the complaint was filed in order to establish standing); see also Galen Med.

4

Assoc., Inc. v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 377, 382 (Fed. Cl. 2006) (amended complaint filed by re-

5

instated corporation cured original standing defect in complaint that was filed when corporation was

6

suspended). Further, such amendments relate back to the time of filing the original complaint

7

pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c). See In re Vivendi Universal, S.A. Sec. Litig., 605 F. Supp. 2d 570,

8

585 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (granting plaintiffs time to acquire assignments or ratifications from real

9

parties in interest and amend complaints to cure standing defects and holding that such amendments

10

would relate back to original filing of complaints); Haddad Bros. Inc. v. Little Things Mean A Lot,

11

Inc., 2000 WL 1099866, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (“Initial defects in standing are remediable

12

through an amended complaint. Where an amendment cures a standing defect, nothing in the nature

13

of that amendment would prohibit it from relating back to the initial complaint.”); cf. Valmet Paper

14

Mach., Inc. v. Beloit Corp., 868 F. Supp. 1085, 1089-1090 (W.D. Wis. 1994) (“[A] decision that the

15

[post-filing] written assignment did not cure the standing defect would simply lead plaintiffs to

16

amend the complaint to add the assignor and then dismiss it as an unnecessary party, or simply to

17

reinstate the lawsuit. Either alternative would result in needless delay and needless expenditure of

18

the parties’ and the court’s resources. Thus, holding that the written assignment executed only

19

thirteen days after suit was commenced did not cure plaintiffs’ standing defect would only ‘exalt

20

form over substance.’”).

21

As explained in detail in Righthaven’s Omnibus Response to the Amicus Curiae Briefs of

22

Democratic Underground and Professor Jason Schultz, even if Righthaven’s standing was defective

23

under the original SAA, Righthaven now has standing pursuant to the the recently executed

24

Amendment between Righthaven and Stephens Media. Righthaven’s First Amended Complaint

25

includes factual allegations regarding the Assignment; thus, it cures any procedural standing defect

26

existing under the original complaint. In order to avoid the needless additional expenditure of time

27

and judicial resources that would result from a dismissal and re-filing of Righthaven’s lawsuit, the

28

Court should grant Righthaven leave to amend its complaint.
