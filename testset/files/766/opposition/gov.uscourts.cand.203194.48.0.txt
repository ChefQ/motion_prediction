Based on those [personal] obligations, which recently arose, the Parties believe
that rescheduling of the current date is appropriate but, if also appropriate with
the Court, do not want this delay to impact on the setting of the trial date at the
earliest possible date. Based on conversations with the Calendar Clerk, the
Parties were informed that there was availability for trial dates in September or
October 2009. The parties have agreed that trial in this matter will require
between 8-12 trial days. (Murthy Decl., Ex. E; Draft Stipulation To Continue
CMC)

As StemCells understands it, the Court has trial dates already set in the November and
into December 2009 timeframe. Thus, this window of opportunity for an earlier trial date could
be lost over other suits on the docket if the Case Management Conference was continued. Given
Defendants’ serious press release allegations that StemCells’ committed fraud on the Patent
Office on the recently obtained (and asserted) ‘505 Patent, StemCells must preserve every
opportunity it can to press forward for the earliest possible trial date to clear this cloud and
enforce its intellectual property. Defendants’ position that Mr. Murthy’s personal issue, which
we accommodated, should impact on StemCells procedural position in the que to obtain the
earliest possible trial date is unjust and unfair to the rights of StemCells
Further, this represents Defendants’ third rationale to avoid or not go forward with the
CMC on August 26. First, they claimed that a Clerk’s Order vacated the CMC. (See Gaede
Decl.,1 Exs. 1 and 2.) Second, after conceding that position did not have merit, Defendants
claimed that this Court could not have intended the August 26 Case Management Conference to
go forward despite two orders to the contrary. Defendants represented to Judge Williams in
Maryland on August 6:

relief. Third, this personal circumstance has recently arisen on August 14 to justify delaying the
CMC. Moreover, two highly experienced Bell Boyd partners listed ahead of Mr. Murthy on the
pleadings have made no representation of unavailability to attend the August 26 conference.
There is a pattern here of developing whatever rationale may be asserted to attempt to delay
StemCells vindicating its rights before this Court.
StemCells does not oppose Mr. Murthy’s request that his personal circumstance should be
accommodated, but it should not impact, to the extent appropriate with the Court’s own
management over its docket, with the earliest possible date for trial.2 As to the disclosures under
the Northern District Local Patent Rules, the initial infringement contentions may be filed no later
than 10 days after the CMC. Of course, they may be filed earlier, triggering the responsive
invalidity contentions.

StemCells will continue forward with the original September 10

disclosure date, so that the current local rule disclosure schedule is adhered to so as to provide
more than enough time in advance of a September or October 2009 trial date. It would be
disingenuous for Defendants to argue that adhering to this schedule poses any difficulties when
they have known of it since May and have leveled in Maryland affirmative invalidity contentions
against StemCells’ two patents.

Nevertheless, in light of Judge Wilken’s Order dated July 24, 2008 granting it a
sixty-day extension of time to respond to the California Complaint (Opposition,
Exhibit C), Neuralstem will be seeking relief from the Court in California
from the Case Management Conference date and/or the requirements under
the Federal Rules and Local Rules that are triggered by that conference until
this Court decides which forum is appropriate for this dispute.

Finally, this Court has set in place a self-triggering mechanism of what will occur

As part of the hyperbole in Defendants’ motion, Defendants contend that StemCells refused to
contact the Court to attempt to arrange an earlier CMC date than September 16. Not true.
StemCells would welcome any date during the week of September 2 for a CMC, which
Mr. Murthy has represented will work for him given his personal circumstance. Indeed, upon
reading that incorrect assertion, StemCells’ counsel contacted Mr. Murthy and informed him of
his error.
3
Just today, Judge William entered an order which denied re-opening the administratively closed
First Maryland Case. (See Gaede Decl., Ex. 4.) Thus, that Maryland suit will not be proceeding
forward at this time and remains administratively closed.

its newly issued patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,361,505 (the “‘505 patent”)), Neuralstem, which was already
being sued by StemCells in this Court for the same activity on nearly identical patents, filed this
Declaratory Judgment Action to clear its name. Rather than proceed in Maryland again, StemCells filed
a reactionary infringement lawsuit within hours on the opposite side of the country. StemCells’ decision
to file the exact lawsuit that Neuralstem feared belies any claim that this suit was in “bad faith,”
“anticipatory,” or lacking a justiciable controversy. If anything, StemCells’ nearly simultaneous filing
proves a controversy existed.
StemCells’ claims that the “convenience factors” articulated in Micron Technology, Inc. v.
MOSAID Technologies, Inc., 518 F.3d 897 (Fed. Cir. 2008), weigh in favor of resolving this dispute in
California are groundless. It is undisputed that some (if not all) of the allegedly infringing conduct in
this case and the Related Maryland Action is the same. Without consolidating this case with the
previous action, there is a serious risk of inconsistent rulings on the “safe harbor” defense (at issue in
both litigations) and different claim constructions for the same terms in the patents involved in this case
and the Related Maryland Action, which are all related.
Finally, StemCells’ assertion that the California Action is moving “expeditiously forward” is
untrue. (Motion, at 4, 8.) Recognizing that Neuralstem’s suit was the first-filed action, Judge Wilken
“defer[red] to the District of Maryland to decide the appropriate forum and whether an exception to the
first-to-file rule is applicable.” (Ex. A, at 8.)3 One day after Defendants’ Motion was filed, Judge
Wilken cancelled the Case Management Conference set for August 26, 2008, refuting any notion that

she intends to proceed until this Court rules. (Ex. B.) Yesterday, she granted Neuralstem’s motion to
extend time, rejecting StemCells’ pleas to keep the California case moving. (Ex. C.)
As the plaintiff, StemCells had the opportunity to select the forum for this dispute in 2006; it
chose Maryland. StemCells’ motion, which effectively seeks to overturn its own previous forum
selection, should be denied.
II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

The Related Maryland Action

In October 2006, StemCells filed its Second Amended Complaint alleging that Neuralstem
infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 6,294,346 (“‘346 patent”); 6,497,872 B1 (“‘872 patent”); 5,851,832 (“‘832
patent”); and 7,101,709 (“‘709 patent”) (collectively, the “patents-in-suit”).

(06-Dkt. No. 23.)4

Neuralstem Answered the Second Amended Complaint and asserted, inter alia, affirmative defenses that
(1) Neuralstem does not infringe any valid or enforceable claim of the patents-in-suit; (2) its activities
are protected from infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1); and (3) each claim of the patents-in-suit is
invalid. (06-Dkt. No. 32.)
In October 2006, Neuralstem filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary
Judgment asserting that all of Neuralstem’s allegedly infringing activities are exempt from infringement
by the Hatch/Waxman “safe harbor” of 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1). (See 06-Dkt. Nos. 27, 28.) This Court
granted a joint motion to stay substantive patent discovery pending resolution of Neuralstem’s motion to
dismiss. (06-Dkt. No. 31.)
In February 2007, the United States Patent & Trademark Office (“PTO”) ordered reexamination
of the ‘346 and ‘709 patents based on a substantial new question of patentability. Thereafter, the PTO

uncertainty and impede the administration of justice. This untenable prospect favors resolving related
patent cases in the same forum whenever possible.”)
Finally, the court systems in California and Maryland would be tasked with duplicative efforts,
and both parties would be forced to proceed with two costly litigations, one on each coast. Not
surprisingly, Defendants have failed to address that their “proposal” would not only waste judicial
resources, it would create havoc in both cases and the patent system.
IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Neuralstem respectfully requests that this Court deny Defendants’

Motion to Dismiss or Alternative Motion to Transfer in its entirety.

Subject: RE: StemCells/Neuralstem

Dear Bill,
We will have to agree to disagree on whether Judge Wilken intends for the parties begin costly discovery matters in
this case before Judge Williams resolves the motion to dismiss and/or transfer. In addition, as requested in my last
letter to you, I would appreciate an explanation on how holding such a conference at this time would be useful to
the parties or the court when: (1) briefing on StemCells’ motion to dismiss in the Maryland Action will be
completed in a few days; and (2) a ruling from Judge Williams will likely be issued before any response to the
Amended Complaint in this action is due.
Judge Wilken's clerk cancelled the hearing scheduled for 2 p.m. on August 26th, which as you know, was the exact
same time as the case management conference. If, as you claim, a conference is still appearing on the calendar,
then we will be requesting clarification and/or moving Judge Wilken to vacate the conference or move the date
consistent with her previous orders to prevent any unnecessary expenses and efforts by the parties and the Court
until Judge Williams decides the appropriate forum for this dispute. In the interim, we can have a discussion about
these issues today if you like. I am generally available after 4 p.m. (CST).

Plaintiff, Neuralstem, Inc. (“Neuralstem”), respectfully submits this Notice of Correction
to its Opposition to StemCells, Inc. and StemCells California, Inc., and Neurospheres Holding
Ltd.’s (collectively “Defendants” or “StemCells”) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter
Jurisdiction, Personal Jurisdiction, and Improper Venue, or in the Alternative for to Transfer to
the Northern District of California. (Dkt. No. 26, hereinafter “Opposition”).
In its Opposition, Neuralstem argued on pages 2 and 28 that Judge Wilken cancelled the
Case Management Conference set for August 26, 2008. Neuralstem would like to correct the
record since it recently learned that Judge Wilken’s Order dated July 16, 2008 (Opposition,
Exhibit B) was intended to cancel only the hearing on Neuralstem’s Motion to Extend Time, and
apparently not the Case Management Conference that had been set for the exact same date and
time.
Nevertheless, in light of Judge Wilken’s Order dated July 24, 2008 granting it a sixty-day
extension of time to respond to the California Complaint (Opposition, Exhibit C), Neuralstem
will be seeking relief from the Court in California from the Case Management Conference date
and/or the requirements under the Federal Rules and Local Rules that are triggered by that
conference until this Court decides which forum is appropriate for this dispute.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND

Plaintiffs,

vs.

Civil Action No. AW-06-1877
*
NEURALSTEM, INC.,
*
*
Defendant.

******************************************************************************
ORDER
Currently pending before the Court is Defendant Neuralstem, Inc.’s Motion to Re-Open Case
and Lift Stay (Doc. No. 71). The Court held a telephonic conference to discuss the pending motion
on August 13, 2008.1 See Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2008). For the reasons articulated during the
telephonic conference and briefly stated below, the Court will DENY Defendant’s motion.
Defendant Neuralstem begins its motion by stating, “[l]ifting the current stay will allow the
court to dispose of this entire litigation.” See Docket Entry No. 71, at 2. Defendant also states,
however, that the reexamination proceedings are “nearly complete” and “almost done.” Id. at 2, 3.
The Court must first note that the terms “nearly” and “almost” do not indicate full completion. In
fact, both parties represented to the Court that reexaminations are still pending for two of the four
patents.2
Plaintiff StemCells contends that the appropriate time to re-open this case will be when the
1

The Court also discussed the pending Motion to Dismiss in Neuralstem, Inc. v. StemCells, Inc. et al, Civil
Action No. AW-08-1173.
2

The four patents involved here are U.S. Patent Nos. 6,497,872 (“‘872 Patent”), 5,851,832 (“‘832 Patent”),
6,294,346 (“‘346 Patent”), and 7,101,709 (“‘709 Patent”). Reexamination has been completed for the ‘872 and ‘832
Patents. The reexamination process, however, is still pending for the ‘346 and ‘709 Patents. During the telephonic
conference with the parties, the parties informed the Court that the reexamination proceedings could potentially
continue for another six months to a year with respect to these two patents.

Patent Office has issued all four reexamination certificates. Plaintiff further argues that until all four
patents have finished the reexamination process, re-opening the case will only lead to fractured
litigation. Lastly, StemCells maintains that it is the only party with the right to move to lift the
consented-to stay. Without deciding the issue of whether either or both parties have a right to reopen,3 the Court concludes that it is not appropriate, at this time, to lift the stay and re-open this
action when the reexamination process is not fully complete.4 Therefore, in the interest of
preserving judicial economy and resources, and finding no undue prejudice if this case remains
closed, the Court will deny Defendant’s Motion to Lift the Stay and Re-Open the Case.
Accordingly, IT IS, this 15th day of August, 2008, by the United States District Court for
the District of Maryland hereby ORDERED:
1.

That Defendant Motion to Re-Open Case and Lift Stay (Doc. No. 71) BE,
and the same hereby IS, DENIED;

2.

That the Clerk of the Court transmit a copy of the Order to all counsel of
record.

/s/
Alexander Williams, Jr.
United States District Judge

3

As the Court noted during the conference with the parties, and will reiterate here, the Court, on its own,
could reopen this action if it, in fact, had determined that there was such a need.
4

The Court welcomes the parties to move to re-open the case upon the completion of the reexamination
process for the remaining two patents.
