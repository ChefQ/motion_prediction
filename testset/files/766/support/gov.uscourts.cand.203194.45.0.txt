TO ALL PARTIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

2

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, pursuant to Civil L.R. 7-11, Neuralstem, Inc., Karl K. Johe,

3

and I. Richard Garr (collectively “Defendants”) move the Court to reschedule the Case

4

Management Conference currently set for August 26, 2008 to September 16, 2008.

5

STATEMENT OF FACTS

6

The background facts of this new case are well-known to this Court already. (Dkt. No. 37).

7

On July 1, 2008, in response to Neuralstem’s motion to dismiss or transfer to the District of

8

Maryland, this Court held “the first-to-file rule is applicable” and “defer[red] to the District of

9

Maryland to decide the appropriate forum and whether an exception to the first-to-file rule is

10

applicable.” (Dkt. No. 37, Order at 8). On July 15, 2008, StemCells filed its Motion to Dismiss or

11

Transfer in the Maryland Action. (Dkt. No. 40.) The Court in Maryland held a hearing on

12

StemCells’ Motion to Dismiss the Maryland Action and Neuralstem’s Motion to Reopen the

13

Closed Maryland Action on August 13, 2008. (Declaration of Sanjay K. Murthy in Support of

14

Defendants’ Administrative Motion to Reschedule the Case Management Conference (“Murthy

15

Decl.”), at ¶ 3.) Judge Williams indicated he would rule in a week. (Murthy Decl., at ¶ 3.)

16

That same day, counsel for Neuralstem learned that his wife, who is pregnant with their

17

first child, would likely be delivering much sooner than expected, on or near the date of the Case

18

Management Conference currently scheduled in this case. (Murthy Decl., at ¶ 4.) Based on this

19

news, Neuralstem’s counsel contacted counsel for StemCells to advise him, and to explore the

20

possibility of moving the August 26, 2008 hearing date back at least a week. (Ex. A.)

21

After reviewing this Court’s website, it appeared that September 2, 2008 would work as

22

alternative date for the hearing.

StemCells’ counsel agreed to moving the hearing date to

23

September 2, 2008. (Ex. B.) Unfortunately, after further investigation into this Court’s schedule, it

24

appears the Court’s first available date is actually September 16, 2008. (Ex. C.) StemCells has

25

refused to consent to moving the Case Management Conference to September 16, 2008, unless

26

Neuralstem agreed to certain conditions, such as setting a Trial Date and expediting its obligations

27

under the Local Patent Rules. (Ex. D.) Neuralstem’s counsel offered to contact the Court to

28

explore alternative dates in between September 2, 2008 and September 16, 2008 to arrive at a

compromise. (Murthy Decl., at ¶¶ 7,9; Ex. E.) That offer was not accepted, thus Neuralstem is

2

forced to bring this motion so that its lead counsel can attend to his family and participate in the

3

Case Management Conference for his client.

4

II.

ARGUMENT

5

“A district court has inherent power to control the disposition of the causes on its docket in

6

a manner which will promote economy of time and effort, for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”

7

See, e.g., Filtrol Corp. v. Kelleher, 467 F.2d 242 (9th Cir. 1973).

8

A.

Under the Local Rules Lead Counsel Is Required To Attend.

9

Given Neuralstem’s counsel’s family obligations, Defendants respectfully request this

10

Court reschedule the Case Management Conference set for August 26, 2008 to September 16,

11

2008. Under the Local Rules, Lead Counsel is required to attend the Case Management

12

Conference. See Civil L.R. 16-10. Mr. Murthy is the only attorney with an appearance in this case

13

as Lead Counsel. Moreover, Mr. Murthy has orally argued all motions over the last two years in

14

Maryland on behalf of Neuralstem in the litigation between these parties, he has also prepared and

15

signed virtually every brief filed with this Court and the Court in Maryland in both the 2006 and

16

2008 disputes. (Murthy Decl., at ¶¶ 1-2.) StemCells cannot deny that Mr. Murthy is the principal

17

attorney for Neuralstem in this matter since all written correspondence for this case has been

18

directed to him. (Id. at 2). When StemCells hired a new law firm to represent it in these matters,

19

Mr. Murthy was the first attorney that was contacted. (Id.) Thus, granting a limited extension of

20

time so that Mr. Murthy can be there for his family, and also fully participate in the Case

21

Management Conference, is not only required by the Local Rules, it makes logical sense.

22

B.

The District of Maryland Will Issue A Decision On StemCells’ Motion Shortly.

23

Although the compelling personal issues are reason enough for moving the Case

24

Management Conference, there are also issues of judicial economy. As discussed above, Judge

25

Williams held a telephonic hearing on StemCells’ Motion to Dismiss and/or Transfer the Maryland

26

Declaratory Judgment Action that was filed before this case on August 13, 2008. Judge Williams

27

told the parties he would issue a ruling in approximately one week. (Murthy Decl., at ¶ 3). In the

28

event Judge Williams denies StemCells’ Motion, no Case Management Conference will even be

necessary. Thus, it only makes sense to move the Case Management Conference back just a few

2

weeks to September 16, 2008.

3

C.

4

StemCells’ counsel claimed that moving the Case Management Conference back three

5

weeks “delays (1) trial setting (and thus available dates for the trial to be set), (2) the deadlines for

6

disclosures under the ND Patent Local Rules and (3) overall progression of the case.” (Ex. D.) In

7

order to address this alleged prejudice, in order to secure a new Case Management Conference date

8

just a few weeks later, StemCells counsel demanded that Neuralstem agree to a trial date now and

9

also consent to proceeding with the obligations under the Local Patent Rules using August 26,

10

StemCells Will Suffer Absolutely No Prejudice.

2008 as the date all obligations are keyed from. (Ex. E.)

11

Proceeding with the obligations under the Local Patent Rules and setting a trial date—

12

especially when the parties do not even agree on a case schedule—without the benefit of Case

13

Management Conference makes absolutely no sense. Nevertheless, StemCells’ claims of harm and

14

prejudice based on a short “three week delay” in this case are belied by its own actions. For

15

instance, StemCells’ complaints about prejudice ring hollow in view the following undisputed

16

facts:

17

21

23

28

1)
StemCells’ Amended Complaint in this action alleges
infringement of the ‘418 patent which issued in October 2006—a
year and half before its Complaint was filed. As this Court knows,
StemCells was already suing Neuralstem on four other patents
disclosing the exact same technology in Maryland. Thus,
StemCells was certainly aware of Neuralstem and its activities. If
infringement of the ‘418 patent was so damaging, why did
StemCells sit on its hands for a year and a half?
2)
Most of the statements that StemCells asserts are libelous,
including those that allegedly resulted in an “injury,” were made in
May 2007, a year before it bothered to file this case. (Dkt. No. 10,
First Amended Complaint, at ¶¶ 22-27.) One again, the fact that
StemCells lived with these statements for over a year belies its
current claim that it needs a trial date immediately or that a three
week delay will cause it any harm.
3)
As a justification for dismissing the Maryland Action,
StemCells admitted that it was “pushed” into suing Neuralstem:

“The fact that StemCells was pushed into having to bring
litigation in order to protect its property rights is clearly not the
same as a decision to enforce those particular property rights
against any particular person. Essentially Neuralstem created this
controversy, and there was no controversy at the time it filed this
anticipatory action.” (Civil Action No. 08-1173, Defendants’
Reply Memorandum in Support of Their Motion To Dismiss, at pp.
6-7 n.7.) (emphasis added).

6

Given the fact that it sat on its infringement claims for the ‘418 patent for over a year and a

7

half, claimed it only filed the lawsuit because it was “pushed” into suing Neuralstem, and then

8

argued that there was “no controversy” between the parties at all, StemCells cannot seriously

9

claim it must have a trial date set immediately (without the benefit of a Case Management

10

Conference), or that a three week delay in holding the Case Management Conference and related

11

disclosure obligations will cause it any harm.

12
13

IV.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ administrative motion to reschedule the Case

14
Management Conference in this case to September 16, 2008 should be granted.

I, Sanjay K. Murthy, declare:
1.

2

I am a partner with the law firm of Bell, Boyd & Lloyd LLP and I am designated as

3

lead counsel for defendants Neuralstem, Inc., Karl K. Johe and I. Richard Garr (collectively

4

“Defendants”) in the above-captioned matter. I submit this Declaration in support of Defendants’

5

Motion For Administrative Relief To Move The Case Management Conference.
2.

6

I have been working on litigation matters between Neuralstem and StemCells, Inc.

7

since 2006. In that capacity, I have personally argued the only three motions which had hearings,

8

including the hearing held on August 13, 2008 in the Maryland Actions. In addition, I have

9

personally prepared and signed almost every brief filed in the 2006 Maryland Action, the 2008

10

Maryland Action, and this matter. All written correspondence that counsel for StemCells, Inc. and

11

StemCells California, Inc. (collectively “StemCells”) in both of these matters has been directed to

12

me. When StemCells brought in McDermott Will and Emery to replace its former counsel in these

13

matters, I was the first attorney from my firm that was contacted.
3.

14

On August 13, 2008, Judge Alexander Williams, Jr. or the United States District

15

Court for the District of Maryland held a telephonic hearing on StemCells’ Motion to Dismiss.

16

During that hearing, Judge Williams indicated he would rule on that motion in approximately one

17

week.

18

4.

My wife is pregnant with our first child. After the hearing with Judge Williams was

19

concluded, I learned that she would be delivering sooner than expected, and approximately, on a

20

date on or very near the Case Management Conference set by this Court for August 26, 2008. My

21

wife’s original due date was after the Case Management Conference.

22

information, I immediately contacted William G. Gaede, counsel for StemCells in this matter to

23

explore the possibility of agreeing to move the Case Management Conference to September 2,

24

2008. A true and correct copy of my e-mail to him dated August 13, 2008 is attached as Exhibit A.

25

5.

After learning this

Mr. Gaede responded to my e-mail and agreed to move the Case Management

26

Conference to September 2, 2008. A true and correct copy of Mr. Gaede’s e-mail to me of August

27

13, 2008 is attached as Exhibit B.

After discussing the scheduling matter further with this Court, Mr. Gaede advised

2

me that September 2, 2008 was not available. He further indicated that September 16, 2008 was

the first available date for a new Case Management Conference. A true and correct copy of Mr.

Gaede’s e-mail to me of August 14, 2008 is attached as Exhibit C.

After receiving Mr. Gaede’s August 14, 2008 e-mail, I called him to discuss this

6

issue. I proposed we call the Court together to discuss any alternative dates that might be available

7

in between September 2, 2008 and September 16, 2008. I reiterated my stance to Mr. Gaede later

8

that evening in an e-mail which is attached as Exhibit D and left him a voicemail message in the

9

evening on August 14, 2008 to once again seek resolution of this issue.

10

After our conversation, Mr. Gaede sent me a revised stipulation to move the Case

11

Management Conference. A true and correct copy of Mr. Gaede’s e-mail to me of August 14,

I contacted Mr. Gaede again on August 15, 2008, but was advised by his assistant

14

that he was not in the office. I left him another voicemail message that was not returned before this

15

motion was filed.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the

foregoing is true and correct.

Subject: RE: StemCells/Neuralstem Draft CMC
Dear Bill:
In light of Judge Williams' indication today that a ruling would issue in one week, I suggest we contact Judge
Wilken to see if she would be willing to move back the Case Management Conference by one week or so. I think
it makes logical sense to wait and see what Judge Williams does with your motion.
In addition, my wife is pregnant with our first child. Her due date was originally after the CMC, however,
our doctor just informed us that she will likely go earlier. Thus, I would appreciate the personal accommodation
so that I could attend, since I am the lead attorney with responsibility for these matters.
It looks like Judge Wilken is available on September 2, 2008. I realize that is immediately following a holiday
weekend, so if that does not work for you, it would have to be the 16th since it does not appear she is available on
September 9th.
Please let me know if you will agree to this extension. In addition, if you would still like to discuss additional 26(f)
issues, I am available after 5 pm today.
Thanks,
Sanjay

Subject: RE: StemCells/Neuralstem Draft CMC
Dear Sanjay:
We do not oppose a request to the Court to extend to September 2 the CMC date and presumably adjust by one
week the day for filing the CMC Statement and ADR Certification in view of your personal circumstance. We don't
agree to September 16 nor do we agree that any delay is appropriate in California due to Judge Williams'
indication that he may rule next week. Thus, that latter ground should be omitted from any request. Assuming
the date for the CMC slips one week, let's pick up the issues for the CMC statement next week.
On another point, as we agreed last week, discovery in California may be used in the current Maryland 2 action
and vice versa. Thus, we will be looking to Neuralstem to comply with its discovery obligations on the discovery
served on August 5.
Congratulations on your pending family!

Subject: RE: StemCells/Neuralstem Draft CMC
Dear Bill:
In light of Judge Williams' indication today that a ruling would issue in one week, I suggest we contact
Judge Wilken to see if she would be willing to move back the Case Management Conference by one
week or so. I think it makes logical sense to wait and see what Judge Williams does with your motion.
In addition, my wife is pregnant with our first child. Her due date was originally after the CMC, however,
our doctor just informed us that she will likely go earlier. Thus, I would appreciate the personal
accommodation so that I could attend, since I am the lead attorney with responsibility for these matters.
It looks like Judge Wilken is available on September 2, 2008. I realize that is immediately following a
holiday weekend, so if that does not work for you, it would have to be the 16th since it does not appear she
is available on September 9th.
Please let me know if you will agree to this extension. In addition, if you would still like to discuss
additional 26(f) issues, I am available after 5 pm today.

Dear Sanjay:
We called Sheila to confirm that the Judge was available on September 2 for the CMC to move from August 26.
She is not setting Case Management Conferences for that day. Unfortunately, as I told you originally, we can't
agree to an extension of the August 26 CMC to September 16 as that delays (1) trial setting (and thus available
dates for the trial to be set), (2) the deadlines for disclosures under the ND Patent Local Rules and (3) overall
progression of the case. I fully appreciate your desire to be present on August 26, and normally, as we did, am
happy to accommodate on a personal request. I don't believe that covering the Conference on the 26th should be
too difficult with three local attorneys plus three Bell Boyd partners listed on Neuralstem's pleadings.
Happy to discuss further. Also, we do need to finish the CMC Statement by next Tuesday, so please get your
comments back to us on the draft sent earlier this week.

Bill

Attached is a revised stip to file with the Court. This accommodates your desire for an extension and our desire
for the Court to set the trial date so we do not lose time by accommodating your request. Assuming this is ok with
you, we can go ahead and file. Also, assuming the extension is granted, as we discussed, we would agree to
adhere to the disclosure dates under the Patent Local Rules keyed off the original August 26 date, as reflected in
the draft CMC Statement sent to you earlier this week.
Please contact me tomorrow as well so we can address the Order on ADR that issued today. We have discussed

Whereas Plaintiffs StemCells, Inc. and StemCells California, Inc. (collectively
“StemCells”) and Defendants Neuralstem, Inc., Karl K. Johe, and I. Richard Garr (collectively
“Neuralstem”) (StemCells and Neuralstem shall be collectively referred to as the “Parties”)
hereby stipulate as follows:

Document 45-8

On May 12, 2008, this Court set a Case Management Conference on August 26, 2008, at
2:00 pm for this patent infringement suit and associated state law claims. (Docket No. 11.)
Neuralstem’s principal counsel in this matter has family obligations that will prevent his
attendance at the hearing date currently scheduled by the Court. Based on those obligations,
which recently arose, the Parties believe that rescheduling of the current date is appropriate but,
if also appropriate with the Court, do not want this delay to impact on the setting of the trial date
at the earliest possible date. Based on conversations with the Calendar Clerk, the Parties were
informed that there was availability for trial dates in September or October 2009. The parties
have agreed that trial in this matter will require between 8-12 trial days.

14

Therefore, the parties jointly agree and request as follows:

15

(1) That the Case Management Conference in this matter be rescheduled for

16

September 16, 2008, at 2:00 p.m.

17

(2) That the Court set the trial date in this matter for a date no later than October 20,

18

2009.

19

SO STIPULATED this ____ day of August 2008.
