DEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is untimely. This Court granted defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment and entered final judgment dismissing this case with prejudice
on August 30, 2011. See Docs. 33, 34. 1 Nearly two years later, plaintiff now seeks
reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2), on the basis of newly discovered
evidence. See Doc. 45. But a motion for reconsideration on the basis of newly discovered
evidence must be made “no more than a year after the entry of the judgment.” Fed. R. Civ. P.
60(c). Plaintiff’s motion therefore should be denied as untimely. See SEC v. Bilzerian, 729 F.
Supp. 2d 9, 18-19 (D.D.C. 2010).
In any event, plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is meritless. In order to receive relief
under Rule 60(b)(2), plaintiff must establish that she has identified “‘newly discovered evidence’

On October 17, 2011, this Court denied plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration. See Doc. 39.
On May 25, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted
defendant’s motion for summary affirmance, and on August 29, 2012, the mandate issued in this
case. See Doc. 43.

that could not have discovered through ‘reasonable diligence’” and that “must be admissible and
of such importance that it probably would have changed the outcome.” Lightfoot v. District of
Columbia, 555 F. Supp. 2d 61, 68 (D.D.C. 2008). Plaintiff has not demonstrated that any of the
evidence she now relies upon could not have been discovered through reasonable diligence prior
to this Court’s original order. She relies in her motion for reconsideration primarily upon a
report she claims was released to the public on March 7, 2011, more than five months before this
Court issued its final judgment. See Doc. 45 at 6. Plaintiff also has not shown how any of the
evidence she relies upon, even if admissible, is “of such importance that it would probably have
changed the outcome.” Lightfoot, 555 F. Supp. 2d at 68. Rather, plaintiff’s motion is premised
on “nothing more than an unsubstantiated ‘bare suspicion’ of wrongdoing.’” Memorandum and
Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration, Doc. 39 at 3 (quoting Nat’l Archives and
Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 174 (2004)).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.
