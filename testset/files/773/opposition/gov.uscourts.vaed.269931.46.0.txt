LITTON LOAN SERVICING, LP'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO MAKE
SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT FILING

Comes the named Defendant Litton Loan Servicing, LP ("Litton"), and submits this
response in opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Authority [Doc. 45],

as follows:

I, BRIEF PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND.

1. Plaintiff filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and supporting
Memorandum of Law in this action on February 10, 2012. See Docs, 28 & 29.

2. Defendant timely filed its response in opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment on February 24, 2012. See Doc. 33. In its opposition, Defendant requested
that summary judgment be granted in its favor in accordance with Rule 56(f) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Id.

3. Plaintiff moved for two extensions to file her reply memorandum concerning the

motions for summary judgment -- one of which was filed after the deadline had expired and after
Case 3:11-cv-00497-JRS Document 46 Filed 03/20/12 Page 2 of 9 PagelD# 585

she had already untimely filed her reply. See Docs. 35, 37, 38 & 39. Out of professional
courtesy, Defendant did not oppose either of the motions.!

4. On March 16, 2012, and just days before the hearing on the pending summary
judgment motions, Plaintiff moved to make another untimely filing concerning the pending
~ summary judgment motions (see Doc. 45).'

I. ARGUMENT.
A. Untimeliness of Plaintiff's Proposed Filing.

Plaintiff has requested leave to file supplemental authority concerning the pending
Motion for Summary Judgment. See Doc. 45. Notably, this is the third request by Plaintiff for
the untimely filing of papers related to the pending Motion for Summary Judgment. See Docs.
35, 37, 38, 39 & 45. And counsel for Plaintiff did not attempt to confer with counsel for
Defendant prior to the untimely filing of the last two (2) requests.

Plaintiff took twenty-one (21) days to submit the proposed filing in reply to Defendant's
opposition to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion. Of course, the local rule only permits three
(3) days to submit the reply. Although Defendant notes the untimeliness of Defendant's
summary judgment papers, Defendant's objection is more centered upon the shear unreliability,
fundamental unfairness and irrelevancy of Plaintiff's proposed filing; which is discussed in more

detail in Section "B" below.

 

' Of note, one of the motions dealt with the ability of one of Plaintiff's attorneys to type the brief. See Doc. 38.
Plaintiff, though, has used at least four (4) different attorneys to simultaneously litigate this action against
Defendant. So respectfully, the ability of one of the attorneys to type, should not have impacted the ability to type
of those other attorneys.

* Defendant views Plaintiff's proposed filing by Plaintiff as an implicit recognition of Plaintiff's concern pertaining
to the strength of the legal authority in favor of Defendants' position on summary judgment. See Doc. 33.

Case 3:11-cv-00497-JRS Document 46 Filed 03/20/12 Page 3 of 9 PagelD# 586

Regardless of the Untimeliness of the Proposed Filing, the Proposed Filing is
Procedurally and Substantively Unreliable, Fundamentally Unfair, and
Irrelevant.

I=

I. The Proposed Filing is Procedurally Unreliable and Fundamentally
Unfair.

Plaintiff's proposed filing is procedurally unreliable and fundamentally unfair for a
number of reasons. For one, in Plaintiff's proposed filing, she attempts to offer the affidavit of a
witness, whom she has never disclosed in this action. Two, the purported legal opinion that that
witness attempts to espouse is not published anywhere nor has it been subjected to appropriate
peer review.' Three, Defendant has had no meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the affiant
concerning his opinions and the bases therefor. Notably, and with all due respect, the affiant's
opinions are based upon Plaintiff's rendition to that affiant of the matters at issue in this case; and
there is an implicit bias component given that counsel for Plaintiff (namely Kristi Cahoon) and

the affiant are or have both been associated with the University of Richmond."

 

> Compare with the Virginia Practice Series, which is a published treatise and has been subjected to peer review, and
was cited in Defendant's summary judgment memorandum. See Doc. 33. And notably, not even the affiant in
Plaintiffs proposed filing attempts to contradict that that treatise stands for the legal proposition that shelter is a
necessary under the doctrine of necessaries as codified in Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37.

* Attorney Kristi Cahoon is a 2006 graduate of the University of Richmond School of Law, and the affiant is a
professor at said school. And Interestingly, despite having submitted an Affidavit from her legal assistant in support
of Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment herein (see Doc. 29 -- specifically the Affidavit of Olga Macias),
Attorney Cahoon previously and repeatedly represented to Defendant in correspondence that it was the Fraziers
(both Plaintiff and her husband) who desired to keep their home and that it was "their" HAMP modification request.
Examples of specific language used by Attorney Cahoon includes but is not limited to the following:

However the Fraziers remain committed to keeping their home and have enclosed their
tax returns and updated Profit & Loss Statement ... As such we would ask that you
would properly consider the Fraziers for a HAMP modification.

See Collective Exhibit 1 (specifically Attorney Cahoon's 7/14/10 letter)

kkk *

Upon filing their 2009 tax returns, the Fraziers intend to supplement that in support of
their HAMP application ... As such we would ask that you would consider the Fraziers'
HAMP application complete.

See Collective Exhibit 1 (specifically, Attorney Cahoon's 8/27/10 letter)
3
Case 3:11-cv-00497-JRS Document 46 Filed 03/20/12 Page 4 of 9 PagelD# 587

Therefore, Plaintiff's proposed filing is procedurally unreliable and fundamentally unfair,
and it should not be considered or given any weight by this Court in this action.

2 The Proposed Filing is Substantively Unreliable and Irrelevant.

Plaintiff's proposed filing is substantively unreliable and irrelevant. The lack of
reliability and the irrelevant nature of the affidavit upon which the proposed filing is premised is
readily apparent as enumerated below.

First, the affiant's opinion in the proposed filing is clearly based upon an incorrect
understanding of the issue pending before this Court on summary judgment. The issue on
summary judgment for this Court is whether Plaintiff is liable for the debt incurred for the
provision of a necessary for Plaintiff, namely her shelter. The issue does not concern title to the
shelter, nor any attempt by Defendant to assert a judgment lien on the property in this action, as
erroneously construed by the affiant. Accordingly, the affiant's opinion is entirely unreliable and
irrelevant.

Second, the affiant's incorrect understanding of the issue in this action is magnified by the
affiant's reliance on a portion of Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37, which is not even at issue in the underlying

summary judgment motion. That is, the affiant premises his opinion around the last sentence in

 

keke KK

Please consider Mr. Frazier's HAMP application complete. Mr. Frazier and his wife,
Victoria Frazier, remain committed to keeping their home and will await your responses
to their request for their application a Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)
loan modification.

See, e.g., Collective Exhibit 1 (specifically, Attorney Cahoon's letters dated 3/8/11,
4/15/11, 7/26/11).

It begs the question that if Plaintiff's husband requests a modification under the federal program HAMP, which his
own counsel (who is also Plaintiff's counsel in this action and an officer of this Court) represents to Defendant as
"their" application to keep their home, then how is it that Plaintiff is truly not obligated on the debt for her shelter
that was incurred (assuming arguendo) by her husband for Plaintiffs benefit? Presumably, this information was
also not shared with the affiant in Plaintiff's proposed filing.

4
Case 3:11-cv-00497-JRS Document 46 Filed 03/20/12 Page 5 of 9 PagelD# 588

Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37, which provides: "No lien arising out of a judgment under this section shall
attach to the judgment debtor's principal residence held by them as tenants by the entireties." See
Doc. 45. Notably, Defendant is not seeking to assert a judgment lien on Plaintiff's principal
residence via this action, thereby rendering this portion of Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37 irrelevant. The
portion of Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37 that is relevant are the two preceding sentences in Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37,
which plainly carves out an exception for a wife's liability to a third party for the debts of her
husband -- that exception being that a wife (such as Plaintiff) is liable for her husband's debts
related to the provision of a necessary for the wife (i.e., such as shelter). A discussion of this
relevant provision of Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37 is noticeably absent from the affiant's opinion affidavit.
Third, the affiant's reliance on Vasilion v. Vasilion, 192 Va. 735, 66 S.E.2d 599 (Va.
1951) is clearly misplaced. As an initial matter, Vasilion is not even referred to in the case notes
to Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37, thereby demonstrating its lack of significance in interpreting that statute.
See Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37, Case Notes. Moreover, the facts in Vasilion dealt with a pre-existing debt
of the husband that was subsequently reduced to a judgment, and which the husband's creditors
sought to enforce via a lien on the property owned as tenants by the entirety by the husband and
wife -- which property the husband allegedly fraudulently conveyed to the wife to avoid the
creditors. See Vasilion, 66 S.E.2d 599-602. The facts in the pending action are strikingly
different. In the case at bar, the facts concern a debt incurred for the provision of a necessary for
Plaintiff, namely her shelter. And the lien for that debt is already attached to that shelter. In this
action, Defendant is not prosecuting the case to attach a lien to Plaintiff's shelter; but is instead
defending claims by Plaintiff that Defendant inaccurately reported that she was liable for the debt
incurred for the shelter. See Doc. 33. Vasilion does not examine Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37 under such

circumstances, and Vasilion plainly limits its very brief discussion of the predecessor of Va.
Case 3:11-cv-00497-JRS Document 46 Filed 03/20/12 Page 6 of 9 PagelD# 589

Code 0x00A7 55-37 to the facts of Vasilion (The Court plainly states: "The effect, if any, of the
Virginia Married Women's Property Act (Code, 0x00A7 55-35, ef. seq.) on this case .. . ") (bold
emphasis added). See Vasilion, 66 S.E.2d at 604.0x00B0

Therefore, Plaintiff's proposed filing is substantively unreliable and irrelevant, and it
should not be considered or given any weight by this Court in this action.

II. REQUEST FOR CERTIFICATION OR INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL.

Both parties have acknowledged to the Court that the issue of Plaintiff's liability for the
debt incurred for Plaintiffs shelter is a question of law which is the pivotal liability issue in this
action. That is, if Plaintiff is liable for the debt incurred for Plaintiff's shelter -- whether through
the "Adjustable Rate and Balloon Rider" which she plainly signed, or through Va. Code 0x00A7 55-37
and the doctrine of necessaries -- then Plaintiff's action herein against Defendant is rendered
moot. In other words, there are no alleged violations by Defendant under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act if Plaintiff is in fact liable for the debt for her shelter.

Accordingly, if the Court deems that additional legal authority is needed to interpret Va.
Code 0x00A7 55-37 and the doctrine of necessaries (which issue the Court never reaches if the Court
finds that Plaintiff is obligated for the debt for her shelter via her signature on the "Adjustable
Rate and Balloon Rider"), then Defendant respectfully requests that this Court stay this action
and certify that question to the Supreme Court of Virginia; as opposed to considering and relying
upon the unreliable, fundamentally unfair and erroneous affidavit upon which Plaintiff's
proposed filing is premised. See, e.g., Tandberg v. Advanced Media Design, Inc., 2009 WL

4067717, *4 (FN #5) (E.D. Va., Nov. 23, 2009) (Virginia law allows a U.S. District to certify a

 

0x00B0 Defendant also takes issue with the affiant's erroneous opinions concerning Lundell v. Citibank, 92 F.3d 1192 (9th
Cir. 1996). Defendant, though, has adequately briefed the Lundell case, and therefore, will not regurgitate that
briefing herein. See Doc. 33.
Case 3:11-cv-00497-JRS Document 46 Filed 03/20/12 Page 7 of 9 PagelD# 590

question to the Supreme Court of Virginia where there is no controlling authority and the
question is dispositive).0x00B0

Further, if the Court disagrees with Defendant and thinks that Plaintiff is not liable for the
debt for her shelter -- which it has been conceded is a question of law -- then Defendant
respectfully requests that the Court stay this action and grant an interlocutory appeal to the 4th
Circuit on said issue. See, e.g., Atlantic Textile Group v. Neal, 191 B.R. 652, 653 (E.D. Va.,
1996) (Leave to file interlocutory appeal should be granted only when (1) order involves
controlling question of law, (2) as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,
and (3) immediate appeal would materially advance termination of litigation).

Respectfully, Defendant should not be made to incur the expense of further litigating this
action through trial when its non-liability is plainly established as a matter of law.

IV. CONCLUSION.

WHEREFORE, for the forgoing reasons and other good cause, Defendant requests that
Plaintiff's motion for leave (Doc. 45) be denied, that the Court deny Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment (Docs. 28 & 29), and that the Court grant Defendant summary judgment in
accordance with Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Doc. 33). Alternatively,
Defendant requests that the Court stay this action and certify the legal question of Plaintiff's
liability for the debt for her shelter to the Virginia Supreme Court. And alternatively, should the
Court be inclined to find that Plaintiff is not liabile for the debt for her shelter as a matter of law,
then Defendant requests that the Court stay this action and grant it an interlocutory appeal to the

4th Circuit on said issue.

 

(R) Defendant believes that there is controlling authority -- including but not limited to the plain language of Va. Code
0x00A7 55-37 -- to find in Defendant's favor on the issue of Plaintiff's liability on the debt for her shelter; but if the Court
disagrees as to the availability of controlling authority, then Defendant requests that the Court certify the question to
the Virginia Supreme Court.
