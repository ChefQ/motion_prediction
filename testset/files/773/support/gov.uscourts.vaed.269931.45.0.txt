IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA
Richmond Division
VICTORIA L. FRAZIER,
Plaintiff
v.

CIVIL NO. 3:11cv497-JRS

EXPERIAN INFORMATION
SOLUTIONS, INC., et al.
Defendants.
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY
COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Victoria Frazier, by counsel, and respectfully moves the
court for leave to file supplemental authority directly related to the Defendant’s Opposition to
Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Docket No. 33) and in support of Plaintiff’s
Reply (Docket No. 37). Under the rules of this court, the Plaintiff is not entitled to file any
additional papers and therefore, under L. Rule 7(F)(1), seeks leave to file supplemental authority
directly bearing on the issues presented in the Defendant’s Opposition and the Plaintiff’s Reply.
See, Dennis v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Civ. No. 2:11CV401-MSD (E.D.Va. Oct. 24,
2011)(Docket No. 29)(granting leave to file supplemental authority in the form of a court’s
hearing transcript that was not available at the time the plaintiff’s response was due). In this
case, the Plaintiff seeks leave to file the Affidavit of Peter Swisher, who is the author of the
Virginia Practice Series on Family Law and the doctrine of necessaries.
The Defendant raised two issues in its opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment that may complicate an otherwise straightforward motion: (1) invoking the doctrine of
necessaries in order to justify its inaccurate reporting of a home loan owned by one spouse, but
not the other; and (2) under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), requesting summary judgment in Defendant’s

favor based on its opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. The only authority
cited by the Defendant in support of its argument that the doctrine of necessaries justified its
inaccurate credit reporting was to the Virginia Practice Series on Family Law, § 4.7, which
section was authored by Professor Peter Swisher of the University of Richmond.
In addition to her legal research and argument on this point, Plaintiff sought the
independent judgment of the applicability of the doctrine of necessaries from Professor Swisher,
who unfortunately was abroad and unavailable to provide the attached affidavit at the time the
Plaintiff’s Reply was filed. Plaintiff recognizes that she is providing the affidavit of a law
professor on a question of law to supplement authority presented in her motion. However, the
only Virginia law cited by the Defendant in support of its novel theory was based on the section
of the Virginia Practice Series authored by Peter Swisher and which goes directly to applicability
of Defendant’s argument to the facts of the case at hand. Because it was impossible for the
Plaintiff to obtain Professor Swisher’s affidavit prior to filing her Reply, because the issue
presented is novel and lacks other authority, because the court would benefit from the
information contained in the affidavit, and because the issue is one that could potentially be
dispositive, good cause is shown for the filing of supplemental authority.
Respectfully Submitted,
Victoria Frazier,
