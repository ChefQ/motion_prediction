Plaintiff’s Motion for Remand (“Motion”) is a highly emotional (and equally
transparent) invective against insurance companies in general that seeks to parlay the
current political climate against the industry into a reason to remand the case. On a
substantive level, the Motion ignores or misapplies governing precedent, is internally
inconsistent in that it alleges CareFirst removed the case both too early and too late, and,
as demonstrated by the quoted passages above, is highly dubious given the position that
Plaintiff has taken up until now. In the final analysis, the Motion fails to provide any
reason to remand the case.
RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Only a few procedural events bear on Plaintiff’s remand motion. First, on June 1,
2009, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Doc. 46-4.
In Count I, Plaintiff asserts that it “properly provided Covered Services to patients
pursuant to the PPP [Participating Professional Provider] Agreement and is entitled to be
paid thereunder; in the alternative, Plaintiff is entitled to be reimbursed as an out-ofnetwork provider for the Covered Services it provided to CareFirst’s insureds.” Id. ¶¶
29, 35 (emphasis added). In addition to bringing a cause of action for breach of contract,
Plaintiff also seeks recovery under the extra-contractual theories of unjust enrichment and
bad faith. Id. ¶¶ 34-43.
On September 11, 2009, Plaintiff served the following response to CareFirst’s
Interrogatory No. 18, which asked about all agreements, contracts and understandings
between the parties: “Feldman’s is entitled to provide Factor VIII therapies to Factor VIII
patients as an out-of-network provider to the extent any such patient’s health benefits
provide for such coverage.” Ex. 1 at 19 (emphasis added). (Exhibit 1 is a true and

correct copy of Plaintiff Feldman’s Medical Center Pharmacy, Inc.’s Responses and
Objections to First Set of Interrogatories.)
On December 4, 2009, CareFirst’s counsel deposed Plaintiff’s chief executive
officer, Jarrett Bostwick. A true and correct copy of relevant portions of Mr. Bostwick’s
deposition testimony is attached as Exhibit 2. From that deposition, it appeared for the
first time in the context of this litigation that Feldman’s is apparently using the term “outof-network provider” to mean “non-participating provider.” Ex. 2 at 147, ln. 10 through
149, ln. 7. While those terms are not synonymous, they are sometimes confused by
persons not intimately familiar with insurance terminology. See Declaration of Michelle
Powell (Ex. 3) ¶¶ 5-9.
At Mr. Bostwick’s deposition, the following exchange took place:
Q.
If – assume for a moment that CareFirst is correct
and there is no contract that covers the provision of Factor
VIII services provided by Feldman’s … and [CareFirst’s]
only contract is with [its] members. In that scenario, how
does [CareFirst’s] obligation get from the members to
Feldman’s?
…
A.
Taking the assumption that you, that you posed, my
understanding is that if the members’ benefits, whatever all
of those things are in their insurance plan with CareFirst, if
the members’ benefits provide that, that they seek services
from an out-of-network provider, if their benefits indicate
that they are allowed to do that and those services will be
paid for, then that’s where the obligation arises, and that’s
assuming that the member is compliant with their
agreement with CareFirst, an out-of-network provider
would be entitled to payment.
Ex. 2 at 241, ln. 21 through 243, ln. 7.
Up to that point in the litigation – December 4, 2009 – Plaintiff had made it clear
that it was relying in the alternative on a theory that it was entitled to payment as a non-

3

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 4 of 15

participating provider (what it called an “out-of-network provider”). Plaintiff had not,
however, explained the source of its right to collect as a non-participating provider, and it
had not revealed that it had received assignments of benefits from its members.
On November 25, 2009, CareFirst filed a Third Party Complaint for Interpleader.
Doc. 17. In response, on January 4, 2010, Plaintiff filed among other things a motion for
summary judgment and memorandum in support of the motion. Doc. 46-7. Included was
an affidavit from Mr. Bostwick that disclosed for the first time that Plaintiff had received
from each of its customers a “Service Agreement/Assignment of Benefit”
(“Assignment”). Id. at 30-34. Mr. Bostwick never mentioned those Assignments in his
deposition. In the memorandum in support of the motion, Plaintiff made many
statements related to the assignments, including the following:
Whether or not Feldman’s is a “Participating Provider” or a
“Non-Participating Provider” – one of the critical issues in
the underlying suit – makes no difference in determining
whether there are any adverse claims at issue in the case of
the Third Party Complaint. [¶] If Feldman’s is a
participating provider, then even CareFirst acknowledges
that “CareFirst would be obligated to pay Feldman’s
directly for factor product provided by Feldman’s to John
DOES 1 and 2 after December 11, 20008.” (Third Party
Compl. ¶ 37). If Feldman’s is a non-participating
provider, then the Service Agreement/Assignment of
Benefits and the affidavits of John DOES 1 and 2
conclusively prove that Feldman’s is the party entitled to
receive payment from CareFirst for factor product provided
by Feldman’s to John DOES 1 and 2.
Doc. 46-7 at 7-8 (emphasis added).
Prior to receiving Plaintiff’s response to the Third Party Complaint, CareFirst
served a second set of interrogatories in an attempt to clarify the as-of-then unresolved
question of why Plaintiff believed it was entitled to payment as a non-participating
provide. A true and complete copy of Plaintiff Feldman’s Medical Center Pharmacy,

Inc.’s Responses and Objections to Second Set of Interrogatories is attached hereto as
Exhibit 4. Plaintiff responded to Interrogatory No. 21 by stating in part that “even if the
Court ultimately agrees with CareFirst’s reading of the PPP Agreement, Feldman’s is, at
a minimum, entitled to payment as a non-participating provider.” Ex. 4 at 1. When
asked the basis for any contention that it is entitled to receive payments as a nonparticipating provider, Feldman’s responded to Interrogatory No. 22 in relevant part as
follows:
The bases for such entitlement are the relevant statutes and
member and other contracts, as well as the Assignment of
Benefits executed by each of those CareFirst members who
received factor products from Feldman’s. Such
Assignments grant Feldman’s “all rights, title and interest
to reimbursement payable” to such CareFirst member, in
respect of products and services provided to such member
by Feldman’s.
Id. at 2. Plaintiff identified no Maryland statute that entitles non-participating providers
to payments from health insurance companies (and indeed no such statute exists). Nor
did Plaintiff explain how the “member and other contracts” entitle Plaintiff to payment as
a non-participating provider, leaving only the Assignments as the real basis.
On February 1, 2010, CareFirst removed the matter to this Court. On March 3,
Plaintiff filed its Motion for Remand, stating, among other things, that:
• “it bears emphasizing that Plaintiff is only asserting its right to payment as
‘in network provider’ in the present case.” Doc. 46-1 at 7-8, n.3
(emphasis added);
• “the Assignments are not relevant to this litigation, because Plaintiff sued
Defendant for breach of contract. The Assignments grant Feldman’s
Pharmacy an alternative ground for payment it reserves but nonetheless
has not exercised in the current lawsuit.” Id. at 10 (emphasis in original);
• “[t]he Assignments that form the basis for the Removal Petition do not
implicate ERISA because Plaintiff has not asserted a right to payment
under the Assignments in this case.” Id. at 11 (emphasis added);
• “the Assignments are actually immaterial to the instant suit….” Id. at 14;

5

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 6 of 15

• “[r]edress of Plaintiff’s claims does not implicate the Assignments
whatsoever” id. (emphasis added); and
• “Plaintiff has never claimed any right of action or remedy in this
proceeding via the Assignments.” Id. at 20 (emphasis added).
It is also helpful to understand something about the difference between how
claims are paid based on whether an insured receives treatment from a participating or
non-participating provider. An insured is free to go to a non-participating provider, but
the fact that the provider has no contract with CareFirst has certain implications. Ex. 3 ¶¶
13, 14. Assuming the insured’s policy covers services rendered by non-participating
providers, the insured or the provider submits a claim. Except in rare circumstances not
at issue in this case, the insurance company then pays the insured – not the provider – the
amount allowed by the policy for that service. Id. ¶ 13. If the provider happens to charge
more for the service than the amount allowed under the policy, then the provider can look
to the insured to cover the difference. Id. ¶ 14. This is known as “balance billing.” Id. ¶
12. Nothing obligates the insurance company to the provider in that situation.
The foregoing scenario is in stark contrast to the situation with participating
providers. Insurers like CareFirst offer providers the opportunity to participate. To do
that, the provider signs a contract that, among other things, obligates the provider to
accept predetermined amounts for services. Id. ¶¶ 11-12. The contract also prohibits the
provider from collecting any money from an insured other than copayments and coinsurance. In return, the provider gets certain benefits. For example, a participating
provider gets paid directly from the insurance company. Id. In addition, because
members understand that they cannot be balanced billed by participating providers, they
generally tend to favor those providers. Id. ¶ 15. A provider may decide to participate

6

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 7 of 15

with an insurance company if the ability to collect directly from the company and the
increase in patients more than offset the chance to charge higher fees and balance bill.
ARGUMENT
I.

PLAINTIFF RELIES ON THE ASSIGNMENTS AS A
BASIS FOR RECOVERY IN THIS ACTION

The primary thrust of Plaintiff’s Motion is a simple one: Plaintiff does not rely on
the Assignments. If, given the record above, the Court finds that Plaintiff is correct,
CareFirst concedes that the Court should remand the case. CareFirst would only ask that
the Court make it clear that Plaintiff is estopped from relying on the Assignments.
It is CareFirst’s position, though, that Plaintiff is, in kind words, being somewhat
disingenuous in now asserting that it is only seeking reimbursement as an “in-network”
or participating provider. After all, in the Complaint and several other documents signed
under oath or filed with the Court, Plaintiff asserts it is entitled to relief as an “out-ofnetwork” or non-participating provider. Plaintiff is equally disingenuous in now
asserting that it does not rely on the Assignments when Plaintiff so clearly cited those
very documents in opposing the Third Party Complaint and responding to discovery. 2
Beyond the question of whether Plaintiff is relying on Assignments, the answer to
the question at hand is relatively easy: the Court has jurisdiction under the complete
preemption doctrine of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1977, 29 U.S.C.

2

CareFirst recognizes that because the undersigned is a full-time employee, there is little
point in seeking sanctions because CareFirst cannot point to any legal fees it incurred in
opposing the Motion for Remand. However, CareFirst respectfully suggests that if the
Court reads the foregoing procedural history the same way CareFirst does, the Court may
want to sua sponte address the issue of whether Plaintiff’s Motion violates the obligation
to assert only good faith arguments.

§ 1001, et seq. (“ERISA”) over Plaintiff’s claim for payment as a non-participating
provider because the claim is based on the assignment of ERISA rights. 3
II.

CLAIMS FOR ASSIGNED ERISA BENEFITS ARE
COMPLETELY PREEMPTED AND GIVE RISE TO
REMOVAL JURISDICTION
A. The Relevant Case Law Supports Removal Jurisdiction

It is now well-established law that any claim for relief that falls within the ambit
of ERISA’s carefully crafted enforcement scheme is completely preempted and gives rise
to federal jurisdiction. Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 210 (2004). 4 That
scheme is contained § 502(a) of ERISA, which is codified at 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a). Id. at
204. Under a firmly established exception to the “well-pleaded complaint rule,” ERISA
completely preempts a case that falls under § 502(a) even if the plaintiff pleads only state
law claims. Id. at 207-08.
The lesson of the Davila opinion is quite simple: if a suit could have been
brought as an ERISA claim under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), then it is completely preempted
and creates federal question jurisdiction. Id. at 210. Applying that lesson to this case
means that the Court only needs to answer the following question: could Plaintiff have
brought those claims based on the Assignments as an ERISA claim under 29 U.S.C. §
1132(a)? The answer is a resounding “yes.”
Multiple opinions from federal courts have held as much. See, e.g., Quality
Infusion Care, Inc. v. Humana Health Plan of Tex. Inc., 290 Fed.Appx. 671 (5th Cir.,

3

CareFirst does not assert that the Court has removal jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims
based on the PPP. Rather, the Court has pendant jurisdiction over those claims under 28
U.S.C. § 1441(c).
4
Plaintiff does not claim (nor could it) that none of the underlying insurance contracts are
part of an ERISA welfare benefit plan. Therefore, what the insureds assigned were
ERISA rights.

2008); Montefiore Med. Center v. Teamsters Local 272, CA No. 3096(HB), 2009 WL
3787209 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 12, 2009; In re Managed Care Litig., Master File No. 00-1334MD, 2009 WL 855967 (S.D. Fla. March 30, 2009).
Additionally, those opinions point out that if the question concerned is one of a
right to a payment as opposed to an amount of payment, the issue is likely one so
intertwined with interpretation of an ERISA plan that complete preemption is
appropriate. Quality Infusion Med. Center, 290 Fed.Appx. at 680; Montefiore Med.
Center, 2009 WL 3787209 at *6. There is little question that what is at issue here is
Plaintiff’s right to be paid by CareFirst, as opposed to what amount CareFirst owes.
The cases that Plaintiff cites regarding situations in which health care providers
potentially have both ERISA claims and state law claims are inapposite. Doc. 19-20.
CareFirst does not dispute that Plaintiff is also asserting state law claims. What CareFirst
contends is that when multiple claims are asserted and one is completely preempted, the
case can be removed to federal court. Indeed, if that were not the case, the pendant
jurisdiction provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c) would make little sense.
Furthermore, the cases cited by Plaintiff supports CareFirst’s position. The key
factor in those cases is that, unlike here, the plaintiffs asserted only state law claims. As
explained in one of those opinions: “[t]hus, so long as the provider's state law claim does
not fall within § 502(a), the existence of the assignment is irrelevant to complete
preemption if the provider asserts no claim under the assignment.” Connecticut State
Dental Ass’n v. Anthem Health Plans, Inc., 591 F.3d 1337, 1347 (11th Cir. 2009)
(emphasis added). CareFirst removed this case because Plaintiff is pleading that it is

9

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 10 of 15

entitled to payment as a non-participating provider, and only recently acknowledged that
it does so based on the Assignments of ERISA rights.
B. In a Related Case, Plaintiff Acknowledges a Claim
Based on the Assignments is an ERISA § 502 Claim
Aside from suing CareFirst in the instant action, Plaintiff also sued CareFirst in a
case styled Templin v. Independence Blue Cross, Civil Action No. 09-4092 (JHS), which
is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. A
true and correct copy of the First Amended Complaint in that case (without exhibits) is
attached hereto as Exhibit 5. In that case, Plaintiff, a related entity, and two insureds sued
CareFirst and two other insurance companies for failing to cover the cost of Factor VIII
provided by Plaintiff to the individuals. In other words, Templin very closely mirrors the
instant case except that in Templin Plaintiff brought in other plaintiffs.
In its jurisdictional allegation in Templin, Plaintiff states that the U.S. District
“Court has jurisdiction over this action because it involves a federal question under the
Employee Retirement and Security Income [sic] Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) ….” Ex. 5 ¶ 8.
And why does Plaintiff – a medical provider – assert that it has standing to bring the
ERISA claim under federal jurisdiction? Because the “[i]ndividual Plaintiffs assigned
their right to payment” to the pharmacies, including Plaintiff. Id. ¶ 17. In opposition to a
motion to dismiss the Templin case, Plaintiff asserted that the assignments from its
customers entitle Plaintiff to bring an ERISA § 502(a) action. Ex. 6 at (internal pages) 78. (Exhibit 6 is a true and correct copy of the Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant
CareFirst, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint, filed in Templin).
So on the one hand, Plaintiff asserts in Templin that it can bring an action in
federal court under ERISA § 502(a) because it was assigned ERISA rights from its

10

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 11 of 15

customers. On the other hand, and in direct contradiction to its assertions in Templin,
Plaintiff tells this Court that it there is no federal jurisdiction under ERISA § 502(a) even
though Plaintiff clearly relies on the Assignments as one of its bases for recovery.
In its reply memorandum Plaintiff will no doubt point out that in Templin
CareFirst argues that Plaintiff does not have standing under ERISA. That is true but the
reason is that the insurance contracts in Templin have anti-assignment clauses. See Ex. 6
at (internal pages) 8-10. The question of whether anti-assignment clauses will come into
play in this case is not germane to the instant Motion. As Plaintiff pointed out in
Templin, “‘a person does not lack standing to claim benefits under ERISA simply
because it may turn out that he or she is not entitled to prevail and ultimately collect the
benefits.’” Id. at (internal page) 10 (quoting Chiropractic Nutritional Assocs. v. Empire
Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 669 A.2d 975, 981 (Pa. Super. 1995)).
In other words, the fact that Plaintiff may not be able to recover under the
Assignments (because of anti-assignment clauses) does not mean that Plaintiff’s claim
does not fall under ERISA § 502(a), and therefore subject to complete preemption and
removal. At most, if CareFirst proves enforceable anti-assignment clauses exist, the
Court could dismiss Plaintiff’s claim as a non-participating provider and remand the
surviving contract claims back to state court. But those are all issues for another day.
C. Plaintiff Misrepresents the Terms of the Underlying
Insurance Contracts
A central question in this case is whether Plaintiff needed a Residential Service
Agency license, or “RSA”, to distribute Factor VIII. See Doc. 46-5 at 4 ¶ 6. Plaintiff
asserts that “[a] patient-insured’s right to payment does not depend upon the presence or
absence of a ‘Residential Services Agency license.’” Doc. 46-1 at 22. Therefore,

11

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 12 of 15

Plaintiff argues, the dispute here could not possibly be one that invokes ERISA. Plaintiff
has failed to read or chooses to ignore the policies that are part of the record in this case.
The policy covering John DOE 1specifically provides that “[s]ervices are covered
only if the provider” is “licensed in the jurisdiction in which services are provided…” and
“to be covered, the services must be within the lawful scope of the services for which that
provider is licensed.” 5 Doc. 29-2 at 31 ¶ 1.6.

Contrary to Plaintiff’s position, the

sources of the ERISA benefits (the insurance policies) explicitly limit coverage to
services covered by a provider’s license. It is disputed whether Plaintiff needed an RSA
to dispense Factor VIII. Thus, the case clearly involves adjudication of ERISA rights.
III.

CAREFIRST TIMELY REMOVED THIS CASE

On the one hand, Plaintiff argues that CareFirst prematurely removed this case
because it is only “[a]t some future unspecified date” that “Plaintiff may or may not
choose to pursue” recovery based on the Assignments. Doc. 46-1 at 21. On the other
hand, Plaintiff also argues that CareFirst is too late in removing the case. Id. at 24-27.
As shown above, CareFirst clearly did not remove the case prematurely. It also did not
remove the case too late. CareFirst removed the case within thirty days of receiving
notice that Plaintiff intended to rely on the Assignments. That comports with the time
period set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b). Indeed, it is rather odd that Plaintiff cites Lovern
v. General Motors Corp., 121 F.3d 160 (4th Cir. 1997) for this issue. The Lovern
decision clearly holds that a court cannot look at the “subjective knowledge of the
defendant” to determine when the 30-day removal clock starts to run. Lovern, 121 F.3d
at 162. The clock starts when the grounds for removal appear in the record. Id. It is

12

Case 1:10-cv-00254-WDQ Document 48

Filed 03/17/10 Page 13 of 15

simply ridiculous for Plaintiff to assert that the 30-day removal clock started “once
Defendant’s Interpleader Complaint laid the first brick of ERISA’s alleged foundation.”
Doc. 46-1 at 27. 6
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant CareFirst, Inc. respectfully requests that the
Court deny Plaintiff’s Motion for Remand.

Identical language appears in the policy covering John DOE 2, but for some reason that
policy (which should have been 29-3) does not appear in the Court’s online records, even
though it was submitted along with Docs. 29, 29-1 and 29-2.
6
CareFirst sees little chance that the Court will reward Plaintiff with attorney’s fees as
requested. See Doc. 46-1 at 27-29. Therefore, CareFirst will not address that issue.
Likewise, CareFirst will also avoid the temptation to point out why so many of Plaintiff’s
assertions of fact are incorrect. Those misrepresentations, while obviously meant to be
inflammatory, are not relevant to the Motion for Remand. CareFirst is prepared to
address whatever questions the Court has either through a supplemental submission or at
a hearing on this Motion.
