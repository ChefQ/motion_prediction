MOTION FOR REMAND
Plaintiff Feldman’s Medical Center Pharmacy, Inc. (“Feldman’s” or
“Plaintiff”), through undersigned counsel, files this Motion for Remand.

For the

reasons set forth in this motion and as more fully explained in the accompanying
Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion for Remand, and the Declaration of
Jordan D. Becker dated March 3, 2010, attached as Exhibit 1, Plaintiff requests
that this Court remand this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447 to the Circuit
Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, and requests an oral hearing on all issues

Case 1:10-cv-00254-SKG Document 46 Filed 03/03/10 Page 2 of 4

raised herein pursuant to Local Rule 105.6.
1.

A Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County,

Maryland, on June 1, 2009. In the Complaint, Plaintiff pleads state-law causes of
action, charging Defendant Carefirst, Inc. (“Carefirst” or “Defendant”) with failure
to provide payment for unpaid claims due under the Professional Provider
Agreement: (i) breach of contract, (ii) unjust enrichment, and (iii) statutory bad
faith.

The claims against the Defendant are based solely on state law and the

Complaint does not plead an ERISA claim or defense.
2.

Plaintiff is a citizen of Maryland. Defendant Carefirst is also a

citizen of Maryland.
3.

On February 1, 2010, Defendant filed a Notice of Removal with

this Court, alleging that Plaintiff is seeking to enforce rights that arise under ERISA
and thus Plaintiff has asserted a cause of action arising under the laws of the
United States, and this court has original jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s claims. See
28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1441.
4.

Because this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, and

Defendant failed to remove this case within the required 30-days as proscribed in
28 U.S.C. § 1446(b), this case must be remanded under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).
Additionally, Plaintiff requests that the Court require the removing Defendant to
pay Plaintiff's costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of

the removal, under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court: (1) grant
oral argument on this motion; (2) grant this motion and remand this case to the
Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland; and (3) order the removing Defendant
to pay all Plaintiff's costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred because
of the wrongful removal of this action.
