PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO UNITED STATES’ OPPOSED MOTION
TO EXTEND TIME TO RESPOND TO PLAINTIFFS’ CROSS MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiffs hereby respond to defendant’s motion to extend time to respond to plaintiffs’
cross-motion for summary judgment, and in support hereof state as follows:
1) Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment on June 4, 2007.
2) Defendant did not conduct any depositions in these consolidated cases until June 12,
2007. Thus, defendant has only recently become convinced that depositions are
necessary to the issues raised in the cross-motion for summary judgment.
3) The Court originally scheduled discovery to end on August 1, 2007, despite defendant’s
request for a longer period in the JPSR. Thus, defendant waited until approximately one
and one-half months were left in the discovery period before it took any depositions in
this case. On August 2, 2007, the Court partially granted defendant’s request for an
extension of the discovery period (beyond what the parties had agreed to) because
defendant had not had time to complete discovery.
4) Defendant asserts that it needs additional time to respond to plaintiffs’ cross-motion for
summary judgment so that it may conduct additional discovery regarding various
documents it has obtained from the trustee for The Heritage Organization, which it
believes might be useful in responding to plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment.

However, defendant has had the Heritage documents in its possession since at least June
19, 2007, when it informed plaintiffs in response to their First Request for Production of
Documents that these documents existed but were not being produced because the IRS
was still reviewing them. (Plaintiffs believe that defendant orally advised plaintiffs of
these documents even earlier, but the attorney for plaintiffs who would have knowledge
of this is out of the country and not presently reachable.) Defendant delayed until just
this week to produce these documents to plaintiffs.
5) Defendant was not required to file its motion for summary judgment before discovery
was complete in this case. Under the Court’s prior scheduling order, dispositive motions
were not due until December 17, 2007.
6) Defendant does not explain why the additional discovery is necessary to the issues it
raised on its own schedule in its own motion for summary judgment, particularly when it
had the documents in its possession when it filed its motion (or shortly thereafter).
7) Defendant’s response to the summary judgment motion was due August 7, 2007. If
defendant needed to conduct discovery pertaining to the Heritage documents (which it
has had in its possession since at least June 19, 2007) it should have timely conducted
that discovery rather than wait until the day before its response to the plaintiffs’ crossmotion is due to seek relief from the Court for defendant’s own delay.
8) Plaintiffs respectfully request that defendant’s request be denied.
