UNITED STATES’ OPPOSED MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO RESPOND TO
PLAINTIFFS’ CROSS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
The United States moves this Court for an Order extending the time for it to respond to the
Plaintiffs’ Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and Response to the United States’ Motion for
Summary Judgment. The United States must file its Response by August 7, 2007. The United States
requests this Court to extend the date for filing its response by 30 days. In support hereof, the
United States would respectfully show that the motion should be granted for the following reasons:
(1)

In their Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, the plaintiffs raised a “reasonable

cause” defense to the application of accuracy related penalties. In order to properly respond to this
defense (which was not addressed in the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment), additional
discovery will be needed.
(2)

On July 25, 2007, counsel for the United States received additional documents

consisting of business records and files of The Heritage Organization, which will be helpful in
responding to plaintiffs’ “reasonable cause” defense. The IRS obtained these documents from the
Trustee in The Heritage Organization bankruptcy. The United States provided a copy of these
documents to plaintiffs on July 31, 2007.

It is anticipated that additional documents will be

forthcoming as the IRS continues its review of The Heritage Bankruptcy files. The United States

will need additional time to respond to plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment since it will
need time to evaluate the information received from the bankruptcy trustee and determine whether
the information can be incorporated into its Response.
(3)

The United States also needs deposition testimony from witnesses who have not yet

been deposed to properly respond to Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The parties
have been trying to schedule several depositions over the past month. Some of these depositions
have taken place, including one in Dallas, Texas on July 17, 2007 and two depositions on July 31,
2007 in Rochester, New York. The parties received an extension of time to conduct fact discovery
until August 29, 2007. Because the parties are still completing depositions, the United States will
need to evaluate this testimony to determine its effect on its Response to the Cross-Motion for
Summary Judgment. In fact, the United States will be deposing several former employees of The
Heritage Organization regarding certain information obtained from the bankruptcy trustee. These
depositions may be important in responding to the plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.
(4)

Over the past month, the parties have been working towards completion of fact

discovery. The plaintiffs served First Request for Admissions, a Second Request for Production and
a Second request for Interrogatories on the United States on June 29, 2007. The Plaintiffs’ Request
for Admissions contained 100 admissions. The United States has worked diligently over the past
30 days to complete its discovery responses, which the United States served on plaintiffs on July 31,
2007. The United States was also required to file a Motion for Protective Order regarding the
deposition of its 30(b)(6) witness.
(5)

The United States’ response to the plaintiffs’ cross motion must go through an

extensive review process in Washington D.C.

Accordingly, the United States requests an additional 30 days to respond to the

Plaintiffs’ Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and Response to the United States’ Motion for
Summary Judgment.
(5)

Additional time will not impact scheduling since no trial date has been set.

(6)

Plaintiffs oppose the requested extension.
CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above, the United States respectfully prays that the Court enter an
order extending the time by 30 days for it to respond to the Plaintiffs’ Cross Motion for Summary
Judgment and Response to the United States’ Motion for Summary Judgment.
Respectfully submitted,
