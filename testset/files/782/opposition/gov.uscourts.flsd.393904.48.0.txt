IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

BUBBLE GUM PRODUCTIONS, LLC,
Case No. 1:12-cv-20367-PAS
Plaintiff,
v.
DOES 1-80,
Defendants.
___________________________/
REPLY TO PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO AND MOTION TO STRIKE “NOTICE OF
NONCOMPLIANCE,” AND TO STAY AND RECONSIDER AUGUST 2, 2012 ORDER
John Doe 67.77.173.88 by and through undersigned counsel, files this reply to Plaintiff’s
Response to and Motion to Strike ‘Notice of Noncompliance,’ and to Stay and Reconsider August
2, 2012 Order. Plaintiff fails to justify the extraordinary relief sought in its attempt to have this
Court reconsider its Order. Thus, this Court should deny the relief sought.
ARGUMENT
As a threshold matter, Plaintiff has completely failed to satisfy the stringent standard for
consideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).
It is well-settled that reconsideration ‘is an extraordinary remedy to be employed
sparingly.’ Relief under Rule 60(b) is available only when one of the following
pertain:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have
been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);
(3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic),
misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party; (4) the
judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or
discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been
reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer
equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief.

*1 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 23, 2011) (internal citation omitted) (denying motion for reconsideration
because “the reasons advanced . . . do not justify the extraordinary relief requested”). Plaintiff’s
filing makes no such showing, and therefore the Court should summarily deny this attempt. “[A]
motion for reconsideration is not a vehicle ‘to reiterate arguments previously made.’ Nor is mere
disagreement with the Court's conclusions enough to warrant reconsideration. Id. at *1 (internal
citation omitted).
Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s failure to provide a legitimate basis for reconsideration,
Plaintiff makes two arguments in its Response: (1) that the Notice failed to comply with Rule 11
because it included an anonymous declaration; and (2) that the Notice did not identify any
noncompliance with this Court’s Order. Both arguments fail.
First, the Notice complied with all requirements of Rule 11. Plaintiff’s Response appears
to have mistakenly omitted a portion of Rule 11. Response at 5. The Rule states: “Every
pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in
the attorney’s name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11
(emphasis added). Here, the Notice of Noncompliance clearly met that standard, as it was signed
by the undersigned counsel, and does not involve an “unrepresented” party.1
Second, as explained in the Notice, “Plaintiff’s counsel, on July 23, 2012, after this
Court’s Dismissal Order, sent a threatening demand letter to John Doe 67.77.173.88 representing
that the proceeding was ongoing against all 80 Doe Defendants in this case.” Notice at 1. Thus,
the noncompliance pointed out by the undersigned involved the Plaintiff using information
obtained from a now-vacated subpoena to assert to former Doe Defendants that the case against

Further, any attempt to call into question the use of the declaration is meritless. 28 U.S.C. § 1746; Thomas v. U.S.
Dept. of Energy, 719 F.2d 342, 344 n.3 (10th Cir. 1983) (“28 U.S.C. § 1746 (1976) specifically authorizes the use in
federal proceedings of unsworn declarations given under penalty of perjury in lieu of affidavits.”).

them was ongoing, despite the fact that the Court has already dismissed the action against the
recipient.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons contained herein, the Court should deny all relief sought by Plaintiff in its
Response.
