INTRODUCTION
Apotex, the second paragraph IV filer, challenges the FDA’s ruling that it is blocked
from entering the market for amlodipine besylate tablets by pediatric exclusivity until the Federal
Circuit issues its mandate in Pfizer v. Apotex.1 In the first prong of its application for
preliminary injunctive relief, Apotex maintains that the FDA’s refusal to give final effect to
Pfizer v. Apotex until the mandate issues is “not consistent with the statutory language” of the
Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”)2, and is therefore arbitrary and capricious.
Mem.3 at 5. As we show in Part I, however, the relevant statutory provisions are ambiguous. It
is not at all clear when “the court determines that a patent is valid and would be infringed” under
the relevant BPCA pediatric exclusivity provision. 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B). Nor is it apparent
when that determination is superseded by appellate action. The FDA’s decision in this case to
await a mandate before terminating pediatric exclusivity is, at the very least, a reasonable
construction of the statutory language and is supported by substantial legal and policy
considerations.
In the second prong of its application, Apotex asks the Court to require the FDA “to
recognize that Mylan’s ANDA for amlodipine has not had final approval since Mylan lost in the
district court, and send a letter to that effect.” Mem. at 14. Putting aside the issue of this Court’s
power to force the FDA to “recognize” things and send letters, Apotex relegates to a footnote the
Federal Circuit’s stay of the very district court judgment upon which it relies. As we show in

Part II, the Federal Circuit’s stay of the district court’s judgment legally prevented the FDA from
doing what Apotex now claims it was required to do “by operation of law.”
Apotex has no reasonable likelihood of prevailing on either prong of its motion. And as
we show in Part III, the equitable factors for preliminary injunctive relief, particularly the
balance of harms, weigh heavily against Apotex’s application.
For all of these reasons, Apotex’s application for a preliminary injunction should be
denied in its entirety.
ARGUMENT
I.

APOTEX HAS NO REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCEEDING ON THE
MERITS OF ITS CHALLENGE TO THE FDA’S DECISION TO AWAIT A
MANDATE BEFORE TERMINATING PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY.
In its April 18 decision letter, the FDA considered the question whether the pediatric

exclusivity provisions of the BPCA, 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B), govern when the Pfizer v. Apotex
decision should be given effect for purposes of pediatric exclusivity. Ltr.4 at 5-7. Section
355a(c)(2)(B) provides:
If the drug is the subject of a listed patent for which a certification has been
submitted under [paragraph IV], and in the patent infringement litigation resulting
from the certification the court determines that the patent is valid and would be
infringed, the period during which an application may not be approved . . . shall
be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires (including
any patent extensions).

21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B). According to Apotex, this “statutory language is unambiguous”
and requires the FDA in this case to declare an immediate end to pediatric exclusivity, without
waiting for the Federal Circuit’s mandate. Mem. at 4. The problem, of course, is that calling the
statutory language unambiguous does not make it so, and the quoted language above says

nothing about when the FDA should give effect to an appellate panel decision reversing a “court
determin[ation] that the patent is valid and would not be infringed.”
A.

THE AUTHORITIES RELIED ON BY APOTEX DO NOT RENDER THE FDA’S
MANDATE POLICY ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS

The FDA’s decision not to terminate pediatric exclusivity until a court of appeals
decision is final necessarily makes the issuance of the appeals court mandate the operative date,
for until then the decision is not final. “A court of appeals’ judgment or order is not final until
issuance of the mandate; at that time the parties’ obligations become fixed.” Fed. R. App. P.
41(c) note; see Mercer v. Duke Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 212 n.7 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting with
approval the advisory committee note); United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934, 956 (2d Cir.
1991) (“A Court of Appeals decision does not become effective until its mandate issues.”);
United States v. Foumai, 910 F.2d 617, 620 (9th Cir. 1990) (“F]inality of an appellate order
hinges on the mandate, as does a defendant's expectation of finality.”); Mary Ann Pensiero, Inc.
v. Lingle, 847 F.2d 90, 97 (3d Cir. 1988) (“An appellate court'’ decision is not final until its
mandate issues.”); Stewart Park & Reserve Coalition Inc. v. Slater, 374 F. Supp. 2d 243, 248 n.5
(N.D.N.Y. 2005) (quoting with approval the advisory committee note); United States v. Swan,
327 F. Supp. 2d 1068, 1071 (D. Neb. 2004).
Until mandate, the court of appeals retains jurisdiction to amend or otherwise change its
decision. Charpentier v. Ortco Contrs., No. 06-60217, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 4583, at *7 (5th
Cir. Feb. 28, 2007) (“This court retains control over an appeal until we issue a mandate. Before
our mandate issues, we have the power to alter or modify our judgment. Accordingly, our
decision is not final until we issue a mandate.”) (footnotes omitted); Mariscal-Sandoval v.

Ashcroft, 370 F.3d 851, 856 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Until the mandate issues, we retain
jurisdiction. . . .”).5
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 36, cited by Apotex, does not provide that an
appellate “judgment” is final. Mem. at 5-6. To the contrary, the rule permits a party to seek
rehearing before the decision is final (i.e., before a mandate issues). Rule 36 governs when “[a]
judgment is entered.” The time to petition the court of appeals for rehearing (either by the panel
or en banc) is calculated from entry of judgment. See Fed. R. App. P. 35, 40.
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure Rule 41(d) prevents a mandate from issuing while a
petition for rehearing is pending. Rules 35, 36, 40, and 41(d) work together to ensure that the
decision is not final and the court of appeals retains jurisdiction until all appellate rights are
exhausted. For that very reason, the FDA chose to wait for the mandate to issue. The FDA acted
well within its authority in adopting a rule that “reduces the possibility that an appellate opinion
will be relied on and then overturned (through an adverse opinion after rehearing or rehearing en
banc) in very short order.” Ltr. at 7.
Apotex argues that the FDA should not have relied on the advisory committee notes to
Fed. R. App. R. 41(c) – to the effect that a court of appeals judgment or order is not final until
issuance of the mandate – without considering the advisory committee notes to Rule 41(d). But
the note to Rule 41(d) provides Apotex with no support either: “The Committee’s objective is to
treat a request for a rehearing en banc like a petition for panel rehearing so that a request for a
rehearing en banc will suspend the finality of the court of appeals’ judgment and delay the
running of the period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari[.]” Fed. R. App. P. 41(d) note
5

The Federal Circuit is currently considering whether to take further action in Pfizer v.
Apotex; and during last week’s status conference Apotex’s counsel represented that the court has
ordered Apotex to respond to Pfizer’s petition by May 1, 2007.

(emphasis added). The note only confirms that a court of appeals’ decision is not final until the
mandate issues.
In Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 97-98 (2004), the Supreme Court interpreted 28 U.S.C.
§ 2101(c), which instructs that a petition for certiorari must be filed “within ninety days after the
entry of . . . judgment.” Supreme Court Rule 13(3) similarly provides that “[t]he time to file a
petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be
reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).”
These provisions are parallel to Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 35 and 40, which calculate
the time to seek rehearing from entry of judgment, not mandate. Like Rules 35 and 40, Rule
41(d) prevents the mandate from issuing while a petition for certiorari is pending, again ensuring
that the court of appeals retains jurisdiction until all appellate rights are exhausted.
Hibbs most assuredly does not stand for the proposition that “[t]he Supreme Court
recognizes that the entry of judgment is ‘an appellate court’s final adjudication.’” Mem. at 6.
The language quoted by Apotex reads in full: “An appellate court’s final adjudication, Congress
indicated, makes the time from which the period allowed for a certiorari petition begins to run.”6
In Hibbs, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the period for bringing a petition for
certiorari began to run from the entry of judgment, because the court of appeals ordered briefing
on whether the case should be reheard en banc. That order “suspended the judgment’s finality
under § 2101(c) . . . .” 542 U.S. at 97. “In other words, ‘while [a] petition for rehearing is
pending’ or while the court is considering, on its own initiative, whether rehearing should be
ordered, ‘there is no judgment to be reviewed.’” Id. at 98 (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S.
33, 46 (1990)) (emphasis added).
6

See Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 99-100, not at 96-97, as cited by Apotex.

So too here. Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pfizer’s petition for
rehearing suspended the finality of the Federal Circuit’s Rule 36 judgment and, until that petition
is decided, “there is no judgment to be reviewed.”
Finally, Apotex appeals to one of the recognized Congressional purposes of the HatchWaxman Act, the desire to get “generic drugs to consumers as soon as possible.” Mem. at 9-10.
But by passing the BPCA, the law the FDA is charged with interpreting in this case, Congress
evinced an intent to encourage pharmaceutical companies to conduct pediatric testing of patented
drugs. Surely a rule that prematurely terminates pediatric exclusivity would be contrary to that
intent. The bottom line is that vague statements of general Congressional purposes are of little or
no use in interpreting § 355a(c)(2)(B).
B.

THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF § 355a(c)(2)(B) DOES NOT REQUIRE THE FDA TO
DECLARE AN END TO PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY BEFORE THE MANDATE ISSUES

Pediatric exclusivity under § 355a(c)(2) of the BPCA operates by delaying the approval
of unapproved ANDAs for six months after a patent expires.7 Ltr. at 5. The operative subsection
of § 355a(c)(2) varies according to the certification issued by the ANDA applicant. Id. at 5-6.
When the applicant submits a paragraph IV certification, “if . . . in the patent infringement
litigation resulting from the certification the court determines that the patent is valid and would
be infringed, the period during which an application may not be approved . . . shall be extended
by a period of six months . . .” See 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B)(emphasis added).8

7

Pediatric exclusivity does not apply to Mylan’s ANDA because it received final
approval in October of 2005, and “therefore, under the literal terms of the statute, [Mylan’s]
ANDA cannot be delayed.” Ltr. at 5 n.4.
8

As explained in Plaintiff’s April 23, 2007, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, based on
its rules and longstanding practice, the FDA should have converted Apotex’s unapproved
paragraph IV ANDA to a paragraph II certification upon patent expiration. Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs’ Application for a Preliminary Injunction [Dkt.
(Footnote continued)

Page 12 of 23

Applying the language of § 355a(c)(2)(B) to this case, “in the patent litigation resulting
from the certification,” i.e., the Northern District of Illinois action brought by Pfizer against
Apotex, “the court” i.e., the district court for the Northern District of Illinois, “determin[ed],”
i.e., entered a final judgment, “that the [‘303] patent is valid and infringed.” Under the plain
language of the statute, the FDA is, at a minimum, prohibited from approving Apotex’s ANDA
during the six-month pediatric period. Indeed, this is precisely the relief that Northern District of
Illinois entered against Apotex. See Pfizer Inc. v. Apotex Inc., No. 03-5289, 2006 U.S. Dist
LEXIS 95778 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 24, 2006) (ordering that “the effective date of any approval of
Apotex's Abbreviated New Drug Application No. 76-719 shall be [delayed] … with attached six
months of pediatric exclusivity … ending on September 25, 2007.”).
As to what happens after that, the statute is silent. Section 355a(c)(2)(B) says nothing
about whether, once awarded, pediatric exclusivity is lost as soon as the panel decision
overturning the district court’s finding of validity and infringement is announced or if it is lost
after the mandate issues, or even if it is never lost. Because the statute is silent, the FDA
correctly concluded, “that the operative phrase – ‘the court determines’ – is ambiguous as to the
action it describes,” and that it was therefore required to consider authority outside the statutory
language. Ltr. at 6.

No. 44-2], at 5 (“Under longstanding FDA policy and practice, ‘upon patent expiry, all ANDA
applicants are presumed to have paragraph II certifications, [and] the paragraph II provision of
the pediatric exclusivity statute, 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i) [] control[s].” (quoting Ltr. at 8));
see generally id. at 5-11. In that case § 355(a)(c)(2)(A) would block Apotex’s application
without regard to the “court’s determin[ation].” For purposes of this opposition only, Mylan
assumes that § 355(a)(c)(2)(B) applies.

THE FDA’S DECISION TO AWAIT THE MANDATE WAS REASONABLE AND
SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

All that is required of an agency faced with statutory ambiguity is that it make a
considered and reasonable judgment under the circumstances. See Mova Pharm. Corp. v.
Shalala, 955 F. Supp. 128, 130 (D.D.C. 1997), aff’d, 140 F.3d 1060 (1998) (stating that
deference is applied if Congress has not “‘directly spoken to the precise question at issue’ and if
the agency interpretation is reasonable’”) (quoting Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984)); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.
Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971) (court to review whether the agency’s decision was based on,
e.g., a clear error of judgment). The Court must accord substantial deference to the agency’s
decision, and, if reasonable, approve it. See Purepac Pharm. Co. v. TorPharm, Inc., 354 F.3d
877, 883 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“FDA interpretations of the FDCA receive deference[.]”).
Here, the FDA found that the word “determines” in § 355a(c)(2)(B) reasonably can be
read to mean “the fixing or settling of rights,” thus requiring it to wait until the appellate decision
is “final” before acting. Ltr. at 6. But the FDA went well beyond dictionary definitions, and the
April 18 decision provides the FDA other substantial reasons why the statute should be read in
this manner:
•

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the commentary to the rules support the
FDA’s reading of the statute. Ltr. at 6-7. As discussed in the following section,
the FDA was correct that under the rules of appellate procedure, finality does not
occur until the mandate issues.

•

As a matter of policy, parties to paragraph IV litigation are best served by a rule
that “errs on the side of greater finality.” Such a rule “reduces the possibility that
an appellate court opinion will be relied on and then overturned . . . .” Ltr. at 7.

•

When the patent holder prevails in the district court, the FDA “applies [the district
court] decision, unless it is stayed, in determining issues related to ANDA
approval.” Ltr. at 7. Thus, a district court order under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A)
directing that an unsuccessful paragraph IV challenger’s approval date be set “not

once final judgment is entered in the district court, even if that judgment is
appealed. If the generic challenger prevails on appeal, the FDA will not grant the
required “immediate approval” until the mandate issues.
Each of these reasons is eminently reasonable. Though there may be counter-arguments,
the FDA’s decision to establish an even-handed, bright line, mandate-based rule that “errs on the
side of finality” is at the very least a permissible reading of the statue. That is all that is required.
See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 and n.11 (“The court need not conclude that the agency
construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction, or
even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial
proceeding.”).
II.

APOTEX HAS NO REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCEEDING ON ITS
CLAIM THAT MYLAN DOES NOT HAVE FINAL APPROVAL
Mylan’s October 3, 2005 final approval letter from the FDA is unequivocal: “the ANDA

is approved.” Declaration of Shannon M. Bloodworth In Support of Plaintiffs’ Application for a
Preliminary Injunction, Exhibit A [Dkt. No. 44-4]. The FDA has never revoked that approval or
“converted” it to tentative. Nonetheless, Apotex contends that when the district court in the
Pennsylvania action entered a final judgment that included a § 271(e)(4)(A) order that “approval
of Mylan’s [ANDA] . . . shall be a date which is not earlier than the date of expiration of the ‘303
patent,” Mylan’s final approval “became tentative by operation of law” and has remained
“tentative” since then. Mem. at 14. Because Mylan only has tentative approval, Apotex argues,
the FDA should “order Mylan to immediately cease interstate distribution of amlodipine besylate
tablets.” Mem. at 16. Apotex is wrong for at least two reasons.

THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT DID NOT “CONVERT” MYLAN’S FINAL
APPROVAL TO TENTATIVE BY “OPERATION OF LAW”

Apotex insists that no FDA action was needed to rescind Mylan’s final approval because
Mylan’s final approval became tentative by “operation of law.” Mem. at 15. What “law”
Apotex is referring to remains unclear. The only support cited by Apotex for its “operation of
law” argument is Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Thompson, 389 F.3d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 2004). But
Thompson did not hold that a final effective FDA approval is rescinded as a matter of law by a
patent court’s entry of a § 271(e)(4)(A) order, and is in fact inapposite. In Thompson, the D.C.
Circuit upheld the FDA’s decision to attach pediatric exclusivity upon the patent’s expiration to
Mylan’s ANDA, which had been converted by the FDA to tentatively approved due to a district
court’s § 271(e)(4)(A) order. Id. at 1284.
Although Apotex asserts that “[t]here are no meaningful distinctions between the current
amlodipine matter and [Mylan v. Thompson],” Id. at 1278, there are many major factual
distinctions that Thompson inapposite, not the least of which is that the conversion to a tentative
approval in Thompson did not occur by “operation of law,” but rather by FDA action. In fact, in
Thompson, after the Vermont district court’s § 271(e)(4)(A) order:
The FDA corresponded and met personally with representatives of both
companies to discuss the matter. In a letter dated June 22, 2004, the FDA issued
its administrative decision concluding that, as a result of the change in the
effective approval date of Mylan’s ANDA in the Vermont Court’s order, the final
approval of Mylan’s ANDA had been reclassified and Mylan’s prior, finally
approved ANDA, was now a “tentative approval.”
Mylan Labs, Inc. v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 106, 114 (D.D.C.), aff’d, 389 F.3d 1272 (2004).
In the letter to Mylan, the FDA explicitly stated that “in light of [the Vermont district court’s]
decision, the Agency hereby rescinds the final approval of ANDA 76-258 issued on November
21, 2003, and regards ANDA 76-258 as tentatively approved.” Thompson, 389 F.3d at 1278;

for Preliminary Injunction (hereinafter “Bloodworth Decl.”), Exh. A, Letter from FDA to Mylan
rescinding final approval and issuing tentative approval. Here, the FDA has taken no such
action.9
Apotex’s reliance on Thompson is particularly misplaced given that Thompson is
dispositive of why Apotex – an ANDA filer that never received final FDA approval – is barred
from marketing its amlodipine besylate products by the six-month period of pediatric exclusivity.
As in the case Thompson, Apotex had a tentatively approved ANDA at the time of the patent’s
expiration. Under the holding in Thompson, “at the time the applicable patent expired” Apotex’s
tentatively approved ANDA with its “paragraph IV certification was automatically converted to
a paragraph II certification (patent expired).” Mem. at 15. As Apotex “then had a tentatively
approved paragraph II ANDA on the date of patent expiration, final approval was blocked for an
additional six months after patent expiration by 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i).” Id. It is Apotex,
not Mylan, that is therefore barred by the six-month period of pediatric exclusivity.
B.

APOTEX IGNORES THAT THE DISTRICT COURT’S § 271(e)(4)(A) ORDER WAS
STAYED BY THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

Within a week of issuance, the district court’s § 271(e)(4)(A) order was stayed by the
Federal Circuit. Upon the entry of the stay, the FDA properly refused to act to reset the effective
date of Mylan’s approval. As the FDA explained in its April 18th letter decision,
9

Thompson aside, Apotex’s arguments would render several FDA regulations
superfluous. For example, the FDA defines a “listed drug” as “evidenced by the drug product’s
identification as a drug with an effective approval in the current edition of FDA’s “Approved
Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” [also commonly called the “Orange
Book”]. . . as a drug with an effective approval.” 21 C.F.R. § 314.3(b) (emphasis added). It
would be impossible for the effective approvals to be deemed meaningless by operation of law,
as some action by the FDA must be taken in order for the product to be delisted from the Orange
Book. Here, Mylan’s amlodipine besylate products were never delisted from the Orange Book.
See Bloodworth Decl., Exh. B., excerpts from the Orange Book listing Mylan’s products, dated
March 21, 2007 (five days after the District Court’s amendment judgment).

Page 17 of 23

[B]efore FDA took such action [to convert Mylan’s final approval to tentative
approval], the Federal Circuit stayed the district court injunction in that litigation.
After that stay, FDA had no basis to convert the approval status of Mylan’s
ANDA from approved to tentatively approved.
Ltr. at 5-6 n.4 (emphasis added); see also id. at 7 (“When the district court decides a patent issue,
FDA applies that decision, unless it is stayed, in determining issues related to ANDA
approval.”).
The FDA is charged with the fair and just administration of the nation’s food and drug
laws. See Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, 657 F.2d 275, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1981)
(“While we are admonished from “rubber stamping” agency decisions as correct, our task is
complete when ‘we find that the agency has engaged in reasoned decisionmaking within the
scope of its Congressional mandate.’”) (quoting American Radio Relay League, Inc. v. FCC, 617
F.2d 875, 879 (1980)) (internal citations omitted)). Improvident action by the FDA would have
rendered the Federal Circuit’s stay meaningless, indeed it would have deprived the Federal
Circuit of the ability to review the district court’s judgment. Such an outcome would eviscerate
the stay, whose very purpose is to protect a party from losing rights that cannot be regained
should the party be successful on appeal. See, e.g., In re Combined Metals Reduction Co., 557
F.2d 179, 188 (9th Cir. 1977) (“[A] party who chooses to appeal but who fails to obtain a stay or
injunction pending appeal, risks losing its ability to realize the benefits of the successful
appeal.”) (internal quotation and citation omitted).
Far from being arbitrary and capricious, the FDA’s decision to not reset Mylan’s
approval date in the face of the Federal Circuit stay was reasonable and prudent.10 Apotex has

The FDA’s decision to treat Apotex, an unapproved ANDA holder at the time the
patent expired, differently from all the other unapproved ANDA filers, whose paragraph IV
certifications were “deemed” to be converted to paragraph II certifications upon the patent’s
expiration, is particularly arbitrary and capricious. See Bracco Diagnostics, Inc. v. Shalala, 963

provided no reason why this Court should not accord deference to the FDA’s recognition of the
Federal Circuit’s stay.
III.

THE EQUITABLE FACTORS FAVOR MYLAN.
Because Apotex has failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, it

must make a “very strong” showing of irreparable harm to obtain a preliminary injunction.
Sandoz, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 439 F. Supp. 2d 26, 32 (D.D.C. 2006), aff’d, 2006 U.S.
App. LEXIS 22343 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 30, 2006) (quoting Apotex, Inc., v. Food & Drug Admin.,
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20894, at *16 (D.D.C. April 19, 2006)). Because its allegations of
economic losses are overstated, speculative, and remote at best, Apotex has failed to make the
requisite showing. Moreover, the balance of harms weighs strongly in Mylan’s favor and the
public interest favors maintaining the status quo.
A.

APOTEX’S CLAIMED HARM IS OVERSTATED AND SPECULATIVE

Apotex argues that, but for the FDA’s decision letter denying it final approval, it would
be able “to fight for a leadership position in the marketplace as an early entrant” and would enjoy
up to a 30 percent share of the amlodipine besylate market. Mem. at 10-11. Those claims are
hardly credible, however, given that Apotex currently has no share of the amlodipine besylate
market, and is currently legally precluded from entering the market under any legal theory.
Moreover, even if Apotex could enter the amlodipine besylate market in the near future, it would
take no more than a tertiary position to the current market leaders (Pfizer and Mylan), thereby
rendering its own ultimate market share far from certain. The speculative and theoretical harms

F. Supp. 20, 27-28 (D.D.C. 1997) (FDA “must treat similar cases in a similar manner unless it
can provide a legitimate reason for failing to do so. Government is at its most arbitrary when it
treats similarly situated people differently.” (internal quotations and citations omitted)).

13

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

alleged by Apotex are insufficient to constitute irreparable harm. See Power Mobility Coalition
v. Leavitt, 404 F. Supp. 2d 190, 205 (D.D.C. 2005) (finding no irreparable injury where harm is
speculative); Wisconsin Gas Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Com., 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C.
Cir. 1985) (In order to qualify as irreparable injury, “injury must be both certain and great; it
must be actual and not theoretical.”).
More fundamentally, any asserted harm is purely economic in nature, and – as the D.C.
Circuit has repeatedly held – such a harm would not give rise to the level of irreparable harm –
especially where the plaintiff has other legal recourse. See Wisconsin Gas, 758 F.2d at 674 (D.C.
Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (“It is also well settled that economic loss does not, in and of itself,
constitute irreparable harm.”). Apotex cites no authority from this Circuit to justify its broadbased allegations of harm. Indeed, its primary legal basis is a Third Circuit case stating that
“loss of market share constitutes irreparable harm.” Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson
& Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 595-96 (3d Cir. 2002). Quite apart
from the issue of whether Apotex has actually “lost” market share, it is highly unlikely that the
articulation of harm in Novartis coincides with the prevailing law of this Circuit. Compare id.
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Shalala, 923 F. Supp. 212, 221 (D.D.C. 1996) (concluding that
the plaintiff's unsupported claim that it would lose between 50 and 70 percent of its market was
insufficient to allege irreparable harm) (citing Mead Johnson Pharm. Group v. Bowen, 655 F.
Supp. 53 (D.D.C. 1986))).
Finally, Apotex’s claim that is has “no legal redress” for its alleged harms rings
particularly hollow in light of its recent assertion of a legal claim against Mylan for a bond
valued at over $70 million. Apotex cites to no legal authority to support its contention that it
lacks any means of legal recourse for its alleged harms. Indeed, it is impossible to reconcile

14

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 53

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 20 of 23

Apotex’s claim that it is helpless and without any possible legal redress, when the company so
recently filed claims before this very court for precisely the legal redress that it now claims not to
have.
B.

THE BALANCE OF HARMS WEIGHS HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF MYLAN

In contrast to the speculative harms that Apotex alleges, Mylan faces real, irreparable
harm from the FDA’s threatened actions that are imminent, certain and grave. Mylan’s harms –
unlike Apotex’s – are not merely economic in nature; at their core they are legal harms.
Mylan is faced with a sudden deprivation of its statutorily guaranteed legal rights without
any advance notice or procedural protections. If Apotex’s demand for immediate final approval
is granted – either now or after the mandate issues, Mylan would lose its 180-day exclusivity
rights without any prior notice or due process of law. This Circuit has acknowledged that
preliminary injunctive relief is particularly appropriate as a means of insulating parties from
imminent harm when another party (such as Apotex here) threatens to suddenly alter the status
quo in a manner that would deprive another of its rights. See Barrow v. Graham, 124 F. Supp.
2d 714, 716 (D.D.C. 2000) (“In the absence of facts that would enable a court fully to assess the
merits of the parties’ respective positions, a TRO may issue to preserve the status quo and to
prevent imminent harm until a hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction may be
held.”).
If Apotex has its way, Mylan would also suffer a complete deprivation of its 180-day
exclusivity rights. Courts have repeatedly recognized that a generic drug manufacturer is
irreparably harmed when it is wrongfully deprived of its 180-day period of marketing exclusivity
vis-à-vis other generic manufacturers. See Mova Pharm. Corp., 955 F. Supp. at 131 (finding
irreparable harm where the FDA deprived a party of its “180-day statutory grant of exclusivity”),

15

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 53

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 21 of 23

(confirming that Mova’s loss of its “‘officially sanctioned head start’ … suffices to show a
severe economic impact to Mova,” for purposes of satisfying the irreparable harm standard).
As reflected above, on balance, the harm to Mylan from a grant of the relief sought by
Apotex greatly outweighs the harm that Apotex would suffer in the absence of such relief. On
the other hand, denial of the relief requested by Apotex would – ultimately – benefit all parties.
Judicial restraint in this case would avoid a sudden change to the status quo, and would ensure
that all interested parties (FDA, Apotex, Pfizer, Mylan and others) could be heard by the court
before the status quo is altered. Issuance of a mandatory injunction requiring the FDA to
approve Apotex’s ANDA immediately would be disruptive, and, should such an injunction
ultimately be reversed upon appeal, it would necessitate the post-hoc rescission of any such
forced approval. No party’s interests would be served by the uncertainty and confusion that
would result from such reversals in policy. Apotex – like the FDA and Mylan – all share an
interest in preserving the status quo pending judicial consideration of the issues raised by this
motion.
C.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS SERVED BY MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO

The public interest will be served by maintaining the status quo and denying Apotex’s
request for a mandatory injunction that would require the FDA to approve its ANDA
immediately. Judicial restraint here would also avoid a situation in which the court intervenes
too aggressively and forces the FDA to take actions that are at odds not only with applicable
statutory authorities, but also with the FDA’s regulations and its longstanding practices (such as
the FDA’s “deeming policy”). Judicial restraint would thus promote the well-recognized public
interest in ensuring that federal agencies faithfully comply with their statutory mandates as
prescribed by Congress. See, e.g., Mylan Pharms. Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 45 (D.D.C.
2000) (“It is in the public interest for courts to carry out the will of Congress and for an agency
16

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 53

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 22 of 23

to implement properly the statute it administers.”); see also Jacksonville Port Authority v.
Adams, 556 F.2d 52, 59 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“[T]here is an overriding public interest . . . in the
general importance of an agency’s faithful adherence to its statutory mandate.”); The Fund for
Animals v. Clark, 27 F. Supp. 2d 8, 15 (D.D.C. 1998) (“[T]he public has a general interest in ‘the
meticulous compliance with the law by public officials.’”)(quoting The Fund for Animals, Inc. v.
Espy, 814 F. Supp. 142, 152 (D.D.C. 1993)).
Denial of the mandatory injunctive relief requested by Apotex would likewise enable this
Court to avoid the wasted resources and the potential for public confusion that would result if the
court required the FDA to approve Apotex’s ANDA, only to rescind its approval (and force
Apotex to pull its products off the shelves) thereafter if the appellate court chose to reverse the
mandatory injunction.
CONCLUSION
For all of these reasons, Apotex’s motion for a preliminary injunction should be denied in
its entirety.
