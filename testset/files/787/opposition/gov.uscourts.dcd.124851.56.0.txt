INTRODUCTION
Teva filed its paragraph IV certification on March 23, 2007, a scant two days before
Pfizer’s last Orange Book patent expired, and now complains that the FDA’s April 18 decision
“penalize[s] paragraph IV applicants” like itself, particularly “where the brand manufacturer
does not initiate litigation against a patent-challenging generic applicant at all.” Mem.1 at 5, 18.
According to Teva, the FDA denied its short-lived paragraph IV application because the FDA
decided that “each generic applicant” must prevail in “its own [Hatch-Waxman] litigation” with
the brand manufacturer, which Teva sees as an attempt by the FDA to “revive its discredited
‘successful defense requirement[.]’” Mem. at 5. As we show in Part I, however, Teva’s
argument is a straw man – the FDA did not block Teva’s ANDA because it failed to prevail in
“its own litigation,” but rather because the pediatric exclusivity provisions of the Best
Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”)2, as interpreted by the FDA, prevent the FDA from
approving any unapproved ANDAs, including Teva’s.
Teva also argues that the “plain text” of the BPCA is “unambiguous” and requires the
FDA to immediately treat the Pfizer v. Apotex panel decision3 as a “court determin[ation]” rather
than awaiting the mandate from the Federal Circuit. Mem. at 22. As we show in Part II, Teva
finds plain meaning where there is none. Section 355a(c)(2)(B) does not tell the FDA when to
terminate pediatric exclusivity in the event a “court determin[ation] that the patent is valid and
would be infringed” is overturned on appeal. That is why, in this case, the FDA had to resort to

a call for comments to aid its construction of the relevant statutory language. The FDA’s
decision to require a mandate before terminating pediatric exclusivity was reasonable and based
on substantial legal and policy considerations, and this Court must afford that decision full
Chevron deference. Likewise, in Part III we show that Teva has provided no reason the Court
should not afford full Chevron deference to the other basis for the FDA’s refusal to approve
Teva’s ANDA – the fact that “the Apotex decision addressed only claims 1-3 of an 11 claim
patent” and that unless it is shown that “the remaining claims do not . . . claim the approved drug
substance . . .,” the ‘303 patent “remains validly listed.” Ltr.4 at 9.
Finally, as we show in Part IV, any harm to Teva from being denied entry into a multigeneric market until September is slight indeed. Moreover, any comparison of the balance of
harms must favor Mylan, and the public interest will be served by maintaining the status quo.
For all of these reasons, Teva’s application for declaratory and injunctive relief should be
denied in its entirety.
ARGUMENT
I.

THE FDA DID NOT DECIDE “THAT GENERIC APPLICANTS MUST
PREVAIL IN THEIR OWN LITIGATION WITH THE BRAND
MANUFACTURER.”
Teva devotes the first section of its brief to a battery of arguments against the FDA’s

supposed decision “that generic applicants must prevail in their own litigation with the brand
manufacturer.” Mem. at 15 (emphasis added); see also id. at 16 (“. . . FDA’s Letter Decision
reads the statute to provide that each generic applicant must secure its own ‘court determination
that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed’ in order to defeat the brand manufacturer’s

pediatric exclusivity — even where the brand manufacturer does not initiate litigation against a
patent-challenging generic applicant at all”) (emphasis added); id. at 20 (“[I]t makes no sense to
have a rule requiring the generic applicant to await the onset of that litigation”). This decision to
require each paragraph IV filer to prevail in “its own litigation,” Teva argues, prejudices a
“patent-challenging generic applicant” like itself, who having amended to a paragraph IV two
days prior to patent expiration, not unexpectedly, was not sued by the patent-holder. Id. at 16.
But Teva has constructed a straw man. Despite Teva’s creative use of snippets from the
April 18 decision, the FDA did not decline to approve Teva’s application because Teva had not
prevailed in “its own” paragraph IV litigation, but because (1) at least until the Pfizer v. Apotex
mandate issues, the only final “court determin[ation]” in effect is the final judgment of the
district court for the Northern District of Illinois finding the ‘303 valid and infringed; and (2) the
Federal Circuit panel decision only invalidated three claims of the ‘303 patent, leaving the
remaining eight claims presumptively valid, and the ‘303 patent “validly listed” in the Orange
Book. Ltr. at 10.
II.

THE FDA DID NOT ERR BY CONSTRUING THE BPCA TO REQUIRE AN
APPELLATE MANDATE BEFORE A PATENT HOLDER WHO PREVAILS IN
THE DISTRICT COURT IS DEPRIVED OF PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY
The BPCA provides that pediatric exclusivity applies to a paragraph IV filer if “in the

patent infringement litigation resulting from the certification the court determines that the patent
is valid and would be infringed. . . .” 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B).5 The statute is silent with

5

The six-month period of pediatric exclusivity does not apply to Mylan’s ANDA because
it received final approval in October of 2005, and “therefore, under the literal terms of the
statute, [Mylan’s] ANDA cannot be delayed.” Ltr. at 5 n.4.

regard to what happens when, as in this case, that “court determin[ation]” is overturned on
appeal.
The FDA decided, based on a number of substantial legal and policy considerations, that
in these circumstances, it will not terminate pediatric exclusivity until a court of appeals decision
is final, as evidenced by the issuance of a mandate. As we show in our opposition to Apotex’s
motion for a preliminary injunction, which raises the same APA objections as Teva, the FDA’s
reading is, at the very least, a reasonable interpretation of the statutory text.6 That is all that is
required; the question is not whether the agency’s interpretation is the best one, but rather
whether it is a permissible one. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). Therefore, until a mandate issues overruling the district court’s
determination, the ‘303 patent is valid and infringed and, according to the plain language of the
statute, Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity continues.
III.

TEVA VIRTUALLY IGNORES THE SECOND BASIS FOR THE FDA’S
DECISION NOT TO APPROVE ITS ANDA — THE REMAINING VALID
CLAIMS OF THE ‘303 PATENT.
In Part III of the April 18 decision, the FDA ruled that, even if the Pfizer v. Apotex

mandate issues before the expiration of pediatric exclusivity next September 25, “ANDAs other
than Apotex [such as Teva] may not be eligible for immediate approval.” Ltr. at 9. The FDA
noted “that the Apotex decision addressed only claims 1-3 of an 11 claim patent.” Id. Unless it
can be shown that “one or more of the remaining claims” do not “claim the approval drug
substance, drug product or an approved method of use,” the “FDA will assume the ‘303 patent
remains validly listed.” Id. at 9-10.

See Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Apotex’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Apr. 26,
2007) at 8-9.

In its preliminary injunction brief, Teva buries its two-paragraph argument against this
aspect of the FDA’s decision in the section otherwise devoted to arguing that the FDA has
wrongly decided that “each generic applicant” must prevail in “its own litigation.” See Mem. at
16, 20-21. In the first of those paragraphs, Teva dismisses Part III of the FDA’s April 18
decision as a “red herring.” It is unclear from Teva’s argument why this is so. Part III sets out a
separate and additional reason why pediatric exclusivity blocks Teva’s ANDA, regardless of the
correctness of the mandate ruling in Part I. In Part III, the FDA explains that a patent may
remain in the Orange Book if “one or more of the remaining claims claims the approved drug
substance, approved drug product, or approved method of use, . . . the patent should remain in
the Orange Book. . . .” Ltr. at 9. The responsibility for determining whether particular claims
cover a listed drug or method of use is with the parties; the FDA “has neither the expertise nor
the resources to resolve patent issues,” therefore, in the absence of a court decision invalidating
all potentially assertable claims, the “FDA will assume the patent remains validly listed.” Id. at
10. The FDA’s Part III ruling is based on clearly articulated legal and policy considerations,
and, just like the Part I mandate ruling, is entitled to full Chevron deference.
In the second paragraph of its argument, Teva, without even acknowledging the Chevron
deference due to the FDA’s Part III ruling, weakly argues that the FDA’s approach “subjects the
entire process to manipulation by the brand manufacturer” by permitting the brand manufacturer
to “selectively assert patent claims in paragraph IV litigation.” Mem. at 20. But, at most, the
ruling requires a generic applicant to challenge all claims that might cover the listed drug. To the
extent all of those claims are not asserted by the patent holder, it is an easy matter for the generic
applicant to bring a declaratory judgment counterclaim to ensure that all claims are covered.
See, e.g., Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. 06-1181, 2007 U.S. App.

LEXIS 7383 * 24 (Fed. Cir. March 30, 2007) (“The [ANDA] declaratory judgment provisions . .
. simply levels the playing field by making it clear that the generic applicant can also seek a
prompt resolution of these patent issues by bringing a declaratory judgment action[.]”). And in
any event, Teva’s policy argument does nothing more than contend that one interpretation of the
statute is better than another. That is not the issue; Chevron requires only that the agency’s
interpretation be a permissible one, not the only one or the best one. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843
and n.11.
IV.

ALL EQUITABLE FACTORS WEIGH IN MYLAN’S FAVOR.
Because Teva has shown no likelihood of success on the merits, it must make a “very

strong” showing of irreparable harm to obtain a temporary restraining order. Sandoz, Inc. v.
Food & Drug Admin., 439 F. Supp. 2d 26, 32 (D.D.C. 2006), aff’d, No. 06-5204, 2006 U.S. App.
LEXIS 22343 (D.C. Cir. Aug 30, 2006) (quoting Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, No. 06-627, 2006 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 20894, at *16 (D.D.C. April 19, 2006)). With allegations of economic losses that
are speculative and remote at best, Teva has simply failed to make out a showing of irreparable
injury sufficient to sustain that burden.
A.

TEVA IS NOT HARMED AT ALL BY FDA’S DECISION.

Teva argues that, but for the FDA’s decision letter denying generic ANDA approvals
until the end of the pediatric exclusivity period, it “reasonably could have expected to make [tens
of millions of dollars] from selling generic amlodipine drug products.” Mem. at 30. But Teva
has no right to market access. It is blocked by both the six-month period of pediatric exclusivity
and by Mylan’s 180-day exclusivity. Teva cannot overcome the legal barriers that prevent it
from receiving final FDA approval for its ANDA under any scenario. Teva has no prospect of

6

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 56

Filed 04/26/2007

Page 10 of 14

receiving final approval and no prospect of participating in the amlodipine besylate market until
the end of September 2007, at the earliest. It is damaged not at all by the FDA’s decision.
Because Teva lacks any reasonable legal expectation of FDA approval, its asserted harms
– including its professed ability to secure amlodipine besylate sales in the “tens of millions of
dollars” – are completely speculative. Teva acknowledges that, even if it were legally permitted
to enter the amlodipine besylate market in the near future, it would likely follow Pfizer, Mylan
and Apotex into that market. As the fourth market entrant, it is highly unlikely that Teva would
occupy more than a marginal position in the market – especially since the earlier entrants are
likely to have secured many of the valuable long-term contracts by then. Indeed, Teva’s
assumption that it would be one of four players in the market is also flawed. If the FDA were
forced to approve Teva in spite of Teva’s precarious legal posture, the FDA would also
presumably approve all of Teva’s other competitors that are similarly situated, leading to a glut
of generic manufacturers in the amlodipine besylate market. Such a development would
undermine any expectation that Teva might have of enjoying a preeminent market position.
Correspondingly, Teva can cite only to speculative and theoretical harms, which are insufficient
to constitute irreparable harm. See Power Mobility Coalition v. Leavitt, 404 F. Supp. 2d 190,
205 (D.D.C. 2005) (finding no irreparable injury where harm is speculative); Wisconsin Gas Co.
v. Federal Energy Regulatory Com., 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (In order to qualify as
irreparable injury, “injury must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”).
More fundamentally, Teva’s asserted harms are purely economic in nature, and – as the
D.C. Circuit has held repeatedly held – such harms do not give rise to claims of irreparable harm
– especially where the plaintiff has other legal recourse. See Wisconsin Gas, 758 F.2d at 674

(per curiam) (“It is also well settled that economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute
irreparable harm”).
B.

THE HARM TO MYLAN OUTWEIGHS ANY HARM TO TEVA.

In contrast to Teva’s speculative harms, if the Court granted Teva’s request for a
mandatory injunction resulting in final approval of its ANDA, Mylan would face harm that is
imminent and certain. Mylan’s harms – unlike Teva’s – are not merely economic in nature; at
their core they are legal harms.
If Teva’s demand for immediate final approval is granted, Mylan would lose its 180-day
exclusivity rights. Courts have repeatedly recognized that a generic drug manufacturer is
irreparably harmed when it is wrongfully deprived of its 180-day period of marketing exclusivity
vis-à-vis other generic manufacturers. See Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 955 F. Supp. 128, 131
(D.D.C. 1997) (finding irreparable harm where the FDA deprived a party of its “180-day
statutory grant of exclusivity”); aff’d, 140 F.3d at 1067, n. 6 (1998) (confirming that Mova’s loss
of its “‘officially sanctioned head start’ … suffices to show a severe economic impact to Mova,”
for purposes of satisfying the irreparable harm standard).
Denial of the relief requested by Teva would – ultimately – benefit all parties. Issuance
of a mandatory injunction requiring the FDA to approve Teva’s ANDA immediately would be
disruptive – and should such mandatory injunction ultimately be reversed upon appeal – it would
necessitate the post-hoc rescission of any such forced approval. No party’s interests would be
served by the uncertainty and confusion that would result from such reversals in policy. Teva,
the FDA, and Mylan all share an interest in preserving the status quo pending judicial
consideration of the issues raised by this motion.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST WILL BENEFIT FROM A DENIAL OF THE MANDATORY
INJUNCTION REQUESTED BY TEVA.

Teva misrepresents the public interest as elevating the importance of open market access
for generic drugs over all other considerations – including statutory and regulatory requirements,
patent-holder pediatric exclusivity periods, and first-to-file generic company’s 180-day
exclusivity – to name a few of the interests that Teva would sacrifice. Teva’s analysis – and its
characterization of the FDA as “simply a government agency with no particular stake in this
dispute” – is deeply flawed. Mem. at 32.
The public interest depends upon the faithful compliance of federal agencies with their
statutory mandates. See, e.g., Mylan Pharms. Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 45 (D.D.C.
2000) (“It is in the public interest for courts to carry out the will of Congress and for an agency
to implement properly the statute it administers.”). The importance of abiding by statutory
requirements and the will of Congress cannot be understated. The FDA – which bears
responsibility for the administration of the Hatch-Waxman Act and the BPCA – must ensure that
it complies with, and administers, the laws in a manner that heeds the broader implications of the
underlying incentive structure of the Hatch-Waxman Act. If the Court were to accept Teva’s
invitation not to recognize either pediatric exclusivity or Mylan’s 180-day exclusivity, it would
be undermining the policies underlying these statutory frameworks, and it would also be forcing
the FDA to violate express its statutory obligations relating to pediatric and 180-day exclusivity.
Such an outcome would not serve the public interest.
The public interest will be best served by a denial of Teva’s request for a mandatory
injunction. Such a denial would avoid the wasted resources and the potential for public
confusion that would result if the court required the FDA to approve Teva’s ANDA, only to

rescind its approval (and force Teva to pull its products off the shelves) thereafter if the appellate
court chose to reverse the mandatory injunction.
CONCLUSION
For all of these reasons, Teva’s application for declaratory and injunctive relief should be
denied in its entirety.
