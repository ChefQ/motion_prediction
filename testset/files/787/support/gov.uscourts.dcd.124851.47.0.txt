INTRODUCTION
Apotex, Inc. (“Apotex”) is entitled to an injunction ordering the United States Food and
Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) to approve Apotex’s Abbreviated New Drug Application
(“ANDA”) for generic amlodipine. The injunction is appropriate because:
(1)

Apotex has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits because the FDA’s
decision to not approve Apotex’s ANDA until after the mandate of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has issued is arbitrary, capricious,
an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law under the
Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

(2)

Apotex will suffer irreparable harm if it is not permitted to enter the market for
amlodipine immediately.

(3)

The public interest in acquiring reduced pricing of prescription drugs is
substantial and favors issuing the injunction.

(4)

The balance of harms favors Apotex.

Apotex is also entitled to an injunction ordering the FDA to notify Mylan that it does not
have final approval for its ANDA for generic amlodipine. The injunction is appropriate because:
(1)

Apotex has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits that the FDA’s
continuing acquiescence in the purported final approval of Mylan’s ANDA
despite agency policy and judicial precedents to the contrary is arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law under
the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

(2)

Apotex will suffer irreparable harm if Mylan remains on the market when Apotex
is not on the market.

ARGUMENT
I.

THE COURT HAS THE POWER TO GRANT APOTEX’S REQUESTED INJUNCTIONS
The court may issue the preliminary injunctions requested by Apotex if Apotex

demonstrates that:
(1)

there is a substantial likelihood it will succeed on the merits;

(2)

it will be irreparably injured if an injunction is not granted;

(3)

an injunction will not substantially injure the other party; and

(4)

the public interest will be furthered by an injunction.

Davenport v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 361 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also
World Duty Free Americas, Inc. v. Summers, 94 F. Supp. 2d 61, 64 (D.D.C. 2000).
The court does not consider the factors in isolation from one another, and no one factor is
necessarily dispositive as to whether preliminary injunctive relief is warranted. See CityFed Fin.
Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995).
A particularly strong showing on one factor may compensate for a weak showing on one
or more of the other factors. Serono Labs. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998), on
remand, 35 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 1999), For instance, as to the first factor, “the court is not
required to find that ultimate success by the movant is a mathematical probability, and indeed,
[the court] may grant [an injunction] even though its own approach may be contrary to [the
movants’] view of the merits. The necessary ‘level’ or ‘degree’ of possibility of success will vary
according to the court's assessment of the other factors.” New Mexico v. Richardson, 39 F. Supp.
2d 48, 50 (D.D.C. 1999) (quoting Holiday Tours, 559 F.2d at 843).

A strong showing of likely success on the merits may warrant issuance of preliminary
injunctive relief even if the plaintiff makes a less compelling showing on the other three factors.
See Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. Federal Power Comm'n, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir.
1958) (“injury held insufficient to justify a stay in one case may well be sufficient to justify it in
another, where the applicant has demonstrated a higher probability of success on the merits”);
National Wildlife Fed’n v. Andrus, 440 F. Supp. 1245, 1256 (D.D.C. 1977) (enjoining further
construction on dam power plant, despite dispute over irreparable injury, because “the court is
convinced by plaintiffs’ argument on the merits and therefore finds it sufficient on the question
of irreparable injury . . .”).

Apotex Has A Substantial Likelihood Of Success On The Merits
Because The FDA’s Interpretation Of The Statute Is Clearly Wrong
1.

The FDA Is Entitled To No Deference Because The Statutory
Language Is Unambiguous

“If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as
the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Chevron USA
Inc. v NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). The FDA has adopted the view of several of the
commentators who urged the FDA to accept the view that a judgment of a United States Court of
Appeals is not final until mandate issues.1 Because the FDA’s view is not consistent with clear

statutory language, supported by unambiguous Supreme Court precedent and the Advisory
Committee Notes to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure regarding the finality of the
judgments of United States Courts of Appeal, it must be reversed.
2.

The FDA’s Interpretation Is Not Consistent With The
Statutory Language

The FDA has refused to approve Apotex’s ANDA because of Pfizer’s pediatric
exclusivity under 21 U.S.C. § 355a (c)(2)(B), which reads (emphasis supplied):
if the drug is the subject of a listed patent for which a certification
has been submitted under subsection … (j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of
section 505, and in the patent infringement litigation resulting from
the certification the court determines that the patent is valid and
would be infringed, the period during which an application may
not be approved under … section 505(j)(5)(B) shall be extended by
a period of six months after the date the patent expires (including
any patent extensions.)
In the present case the Federal Circuit was the “court [that] determine[d]” that all the
relevant claims of Pfizer's patent were not "valid" on March 22, 2007. The Federal Circuit’s
judgment was final because under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 36 an appellate court
"determines" the merits of the case in its opinion and that opinion constitutes the "judgment."
Rule 36 directs the clerk of the court to "prepare, sign, and enter the judgment … after receiving
the court’s opinion," and requires the clerk "[o]n the date when judgment is entered [to] serve on
all parties a copy of the opinion … and a notice of the date when the judgment was entered."
Fed. R. App. P. 36 (emphasis supplied).
In the present case, the clerk for the Federal Circuit entered the judgment "Reversed" on
March 22, 2007. The opinion on which that judgment was based "determine[d]" that the claims
of Pfizer's patent that were asserted against Apotex were invalid. See Judgment and Opinion,

Regulatory Affairs, Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. to Gary J. Buehler, Director, Office of Generic Drugs (Mar.
30, 2007) (Zydus Comment).

attached as Exhibit A. The Federal Circuit’s judgment was served on the District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois and was entered into that court’s docket for this case. This is in
accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 36 ("A judgment is entered when it is
noted on the docket"). On the day Exhibit A was entered in the Federal Circuit, that opinion and
judgment could have been the subject of a petition for certiorari under the Rules of the Supreme
Court. See Supreme Court Rules 14(1)(i)(i)&(iv). The judgment was final.
3.

The FDA's Decision Is Not Consistent With Supreme Court
Case Law

The Supreme Court recognizes that the entry of judgment is "an appellate court's final
adjudication." Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 96-97 (2004). The Supreme Court pays attention to
the difference between the date of entry of judgment and the issuance of the mandate – it knows
and observes the difference. See id., citing and quoting Supreme Court Rule 13(3) (“The time to
file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought
to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local
practice).”).
4.

In Deciding Petitions for Panel Rehearing, Rehearing En Banc,
And Certiorari, The Courts Of Appeal And The Supreme
Court Are Not "Determining"

A petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc does not vacate the opinion or the judgment
of the Court of Appeals issued by the three-judge panel, even under the Federal Rules of
Appellate Procedure. Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Edward H. Cooper, 16A Fed.
Prac. & Proc. Juris.3d § 3981.2. (2007) (Courts of Appeal are split between those that
automatically vacate the panel decision, and those that require a specific order to withdraw it).
The Federal Circuit does not have an express rule on the matter, but in practice vacates panel
decisions that are to be reheard.

-6-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 9 of 25

“Granting hearing or rehearing en banc is always discretionary with the court of appeals.”
Id. at § 3981.1. In deciding whether to rehear Apotex v. Pfizer, the Federal Circuit would not be
"determining" whether the Pfizer's patent is valid or infringed – it would be determining whether
the panel decision needs to be revisited for reasons of consistency with prior cases, or because it
presents an issue of exceptional importance. Id.
Similarly, the Supreme Court's certiorari procedure is discretionary. Supreme Court Rule
10. The principal considerations are whether there is conflict among the United States Courts of
Appeal, the appellate court has seriously departed from accepted or usual proceedings, the
appellate court has sanctioned such a departure by a lower court, the appellate court has decided
an important issue of federal law that should be decided by the Supreme Court, or the appellate
court has decided a case in a way that conflicts with Supreme Court precedent. Id.
Both of these mechanisms involve courts deciding whether they will re-determine the
issue, not whether the Court of Appeals has made a determination. Accordingly, applications for
these later events do not make the initial judgment any less a “determination” by an Article III
Court.
5.

The FDA Has Long Drawn The Line Based On Whether
Appeal Was Available Or Not, Excluding The Possibility of
Rehearing Or Certiorari

The FDA’s analysis regarding the meaning of the phrase “the court determines” is wrong,
and entitled to no deference. First, the FDA has long construed a “decision of a court” or “court
decision” as a “final decision of a court from which no appeal can or has been taken.” Court
Decisions, ANDA Approvals, and 180-Day Exclusivity Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, at 2 (Mar. 2000) (hereinafter “Court Decisions
Guidance”). This is the definition the FDA used for years. Id. Once the judgment of the appellate

-7-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 10 of 25

court is entered, it is not subject to any more appeals as a matter of right, only discretionary
petitions and certiorari.
The statutory construction question posed is when the Federal Circuit has “determined”
that Pfizer’s patent is invalid as against Apotex. The FDA says it has not done so until the
mandate issues. It is not within the FDA's purview to tell Article III Courts what they have
“determined” and what they have not, and the FDA is not entitled to any deference on that issue.
6.

The FDA's Reliance On The Advisory Committee Notes To
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(c), Without Reading
The Notes To 41(d), Is Not Reasonable and Not Entitled To
Deference

The seeds for the error in the FDA's analysis appear to have arisen from a
misunderstanding of the distinction between judgment and mandate. As Hibbs teaches, finality is
determined by the judgment, not the mandate. Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 96-97. FDA relies on the
comment to Fed. R. App. P. 41(c) for the proposition that an appellate judgment does not
become final until mandate issues. However, it is wrong to read the comment for Rule 41(c) in
isolation and not read it along with the comment for Rule 41(d). The Advisory Committee Notes
to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d) read (emphasis supplied):
The Committee's objective is to treat a request for rehearing en
banc like a petition for panel rehearing so that a request for a
rehearing en banc will suspend the finality of the court of appeals'
judgment and delay the running of the period for filing a petition of
certiorari.
The Advisory Committee also knew that the judgment was final as of the date of entry, and
suspended by the petition procedure for the purpose of making sure that it did not reach the
Supreme Court too soon.
7.

The FDA's Reliance On Statutes That Use Mandate To Set
Finality Is Misplaced

-8-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 11 of 25

In drafting the pediatric exclusivity statute, Congress focused on the court's
"determination," not when it relinquishes jurisdiction to another court. The FDA has relied on
statutes that say that the orders of administrative agencies become final a certain time after the
mandate of a reviewing court issues. E.g., 26 U.S.C. § 7481(a) (finality of a Tax Court decision –
not the appellate court or Supreme Court decision – remanded to the Tax Court from the
Supreme Court or a Court of Appeals is 30 days after mandate); 15 U.S.C. § 21(g) (the orders of
the Commission, Board, or Secretary – not a court – vest with jurisdiction become final 30 days
after the issuance of mandate from the Supreme Court); 15 U.S.C. § 45 (same). These are not
apposite – the Federal Circuit here is reviewing a district court, not an administrative agency.
Further, all that these statutes prove is that when Congress wants to specify something other than
the otherwise clear general rule – that a court has made a “determination” when it enters a
judgment – it can pass a statute to obtain its alternative desired outcome. This in no way lends
ambiguity to the present statute or supports the FDA's interpretation. Just because interested
parties disagree as to an interpretation of statutory language, this does not make that language
ambiguous. In the present case, Congress could have used the word “mandate” if it wanted to do
so. Instead it used the words “court determines,” which in the appellate context is the Federal
Circuit’s judgment of invalidity or noninfringement.
8.

Congress Wanted The Courts To Get Generic Drugs To
Consumers If Possible, Not Enable Brand Manufacturers To
Use Delaying Tactics To Keep Generic Drugs Off The Market

The FDA's interpretation puts the finality of the judgment of the Federal Circuit in the
hands of Pfizer, not the hands of the Federal Circuit. The congressional policy was to put the
“determination” in the hands of the courts, not aggrieved parties. The FDA's interpretation is
directly contrary Congress' intent that the court make the determination.

-9-

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 12 of 25

The FDA has apparently concluded that Congress’ intended effect was to make
controlling the unlikely discretionary events of rehearing and certiorari so that a brand
manufacturer such as Pfizer could maintain its pediatric exclusivity in the face of an adverse
appellate decision. Losing litigants have 14 days to file petitions for rehearing, and that petition
indefinitely stays the mandate. Fed. R. App. P. 41(d)(1). Even if the petition for rehearing is
denied immediately, there is another 7 days for the mandate to issue. Fed. R. App. P. 41(b).
Petitions for rehearing are exceedingly rare – they are granted only in a few cases.2
This can be further extended because, as noted earlier, parties have 90 days to petition for
certiorari. The Supreme Court takes fewer than 100 cases a year, and "paid cases" like Pfizer's
(cases not filed in forma pauperis) would have less than a 4% chance of receiving certiorari.
Timothy S. Bishop & Jeffrey W. Sarles, Petitioning and Opposing Certiorari in the U.S.
Supreme Court, http://library.findlaw.com/1999/Jan/1/241457.html. Permitting the filing of
discretionary applications that have a low likelihood of success to extend the brand company
monopoly is contrary to the central purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act of getting generic drugs
to consumers as soon as possible.
B.

Apotex Will Be Irreparably Harmed Without A Preliminary
Injunction

A decision not to order the FDA to approve Apotex's ANDA for generic amlodipine
would seriously disadvantage Apotex. If the preliminary injunction is not granted, and Mylan
continues to sell its generic drug, Apotex will lose its opportunity to fight for a leadership
2

A review of petitions for rehearing submitted to the Federal Circuit over a 16-month period demonstrated that the
Federal Circuit grants petitions for rehearing by the panel less than 3% of the time, while petitions for rehearing en
banc are granted only about 0.6% of the time. See George Quillin & Jacqueline Wright, Rare Success Upon Filing

position in the marketplace as an early entrant. Having that leadership position is essential to
capture a sizable portion of the amlodipine market and associated annual sales that are forecasted
to reach the hundreds of millions of dollars – harms for which there is no legal redress.
Loss of market share in a highly competitive industry is irreparable harm because of the
difficulty of recovering from a loss of market share. As the court in Novartis Consumer Health,
Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 595-96 (3d Cir. 2002),
explained (emphasis supplied):
Nonetheless, we conclude that the District Court's error in citing the
wrong standard was harmless because there is sufficient evidence in the record to
support a finding of irreparable harm necessary to issue a preliminary injunction.
The District Court observed that the promotion and sale of MNTS had already
had a measurable effect on Maalox's market share as reflected by a decrease in
sales of Maalox that corresponds to the increased sales for MNTS. 129 F. Supp.
2d at 369. We are satisfied that this loss of market share constitutes
irreparable harm. See Moltan Co. v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 55 F.3d 1171,
1175 (6th Cir. 1995) (affirming decision to grant preliminary injunction where
manufacturer's false claims were causing irreparable injury to a competitor in the
form of lost sales and market share); Cordis Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc., 835 F.2d
859, 864 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("a loss in market share caused by an injunction could
result in irreparable harm"); see also Pappan Enters., Inc. v. Hardee's Food Sys.,
Inc., 143 F.3d 800, 805 (3d Cir. 1998) ("Grounds for irreparable injury include
loss of control of reputation, loss of trade, and loss of goodwill."); Opticians Ass'n
v. Indep. Opticians, 920 F.2d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 1990) (same). In a competitive
industry where consumers are brand-loyal, we believe that loss of market
share is a "potential harm which cannot be redressed by a legal or an
equitable remedy following a trial." Instant Air Freight, 882 F.2d at 801.

Representatives from both parties that are seeking to establish a leadership position in the
market for generic amlodipine tablets have offered declarations supporting the proposition that
irreparable harm is caused by being kept out of the generic drug market during this crucial
period. See McIntire Decl. (for Apotex) (attached as Exhibit B); Roman Decl. (for Mylan)
(attached as Exhibit C). The existence of irreparable harm is undisputed by the parties with
economic interests in the matter.

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Page 14 of 25

FDA's refusal to approve Apotex's ANDA has prevented Apotex from getting a fair start
in this race to market. Mylan is obtaining a head start against Apotex that it is not entitled to.
That head start will permit Mylan to secure distribution channels, favorable positioning in
customer supply programs, and access to customers, thereby enabling Mylan to retain a greater
market share in the long term. See Roman Decl., ¶6 at 2. Without an injunction, if, as Apotex
expects, it is found that the Federal Circuit's “determin[ation]” that the asserted claims of Pfizer's
patent were invalid as of in the date of the court’s opinion and judgment of March 22, 2007,
Apotex will never be able to recover for its lost market share from FDA or anyone else.
Based on its experience in the industry, Apotex calculates that if it receives final FDA
approval for its ANDA in April 2007, a best case scenario would give Apotex a 30% market
share of the generic sales, which would result in Apotex sales of $83,718,851 for the first 12
months post-launch. McIntire Decl., ¶14, Exhibit B.
Even in a worst case scenario, for an April launch, Apotex would have 20% of the market
at approximately $55,673,036 in sales for the first 12 months post-launch. (Id.) However, if
Apotex is prohibited from launching until September 2007, it would be lucky to obtain a 10%
market share with yearly revenues of approximately $5,244,000. (Id.)
Mylan itself recognizes the value of the market for generic Norvasc® tablets. Mylan’s
Vice President and General Counsel, Brian S. Roman, filed a declaration to support Mylan’s
emergency application for a temporary restraining order, stating that Mylan “has forecasted that
its revenues would reach several million dollars per day” (Exhibit C, ¶ 6), and he further stated
that by being the first to launch into the generic marketplace, Mylan will be able to gain
favorable positioning in customer supply programs and access to additional customers, thereby
obtaining and retaining a greater market share in the long term. (Id.) Mr. Roman also claimed

- 12 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Page 15 of 25

that FDA approval of other ANDAs would mean that “Mylan would lose a portion of the
amlodipine market and associated sales that are forecasted to reach the hundreds of millions of
dollars. . . .” (Id.) FDA should be ordered to immediately grant Apotex final approval to sell
generic amlodipine besylate to mitigate this irreparable harm, which will continue to grow until
Apotex’s products reach the market.
C.

The Public Interest Is Served By The Issuance Of a Preliminary
Injunction

The public has a well-recognized interest in "receiving generic competition to
brand-name drugs as soon as is possible," Boehringer Ingelheim Corp. v. Shalala, 993 F. Supp.
1, 3 (D.D.C. 1997), and a "delay in the marketing of [the generic] drug could easily be against
the public interest in reduced prices," Schering Corp. v. Sullivan, 782 F. Supp. 645, 652 (D.D.C.
1992). Accordingly, the public interest is in having Apotex on the market with its generic drug.

D.

The Balance Of Harms Favors Apotex

Presently, Mylan is on the market. If this Court orders the FDA to permit Apotex to enter
the market, Mylan will have to compete for market share with Apotex as opposed to being the
only true generic on the market. If it were to turn out that the preliminary injunction was issued
erroneously, and Apotex was forced to leave the market, Mylan could seize the market share that
Apotex had been holding. In other words, in the event of an erroneous preliminary injunction,
Mylan is not harmed. However, if the Court erroneously withholds the injunction, Apotex will
never be able to recover its market share in this highly competitive market as recognized in
Cordis. Accordingly, allowing Apotex to enter the market minimizes the prospect of irreparable
harm all around, while the risk of economic harms is equal.

THE FDA SHOULD BE ORDERED TO RECOGNIZE THAT MYLAN'S ANDA FOR
AMLODIPINE HAS NOT HAD FINAL APPROVAL SINCE MYLAN LOST IN THE
DISTRICT COURT, AND SEND A LETTER TO THAT EFFECT
A.

Apotex Is Likely To Succeed On Its Claim That Mylan Has No Legal
Right To Market Its Generic Amlodipine Besylate Tablets At This
Time

For the reasons discussed below, Mylan was not entitled to begin marketing generic
amlodipine besylate tablets on March 23, 2007. Had FDA applied its judicially-sanctioned
precedents, Mylan would not have held final ANDA approval, only a “tentative” approval, at
that time and at all times since then.
1.

When Mylan Lost In Its Patent Infringement Litigation With
Pfizer, Its Approval to Market Generic Amlodipine Besylate
Became Tentative By Operation Of Law

On February 27, 2007, Mylan lost its patent suit to Pfizer in the Pennsylvania district
court. Specifically, the Pennsylvania court entered judgment against Mylan and in favor of
Pfizer, concluding that the ’303 patent was infringed by Mylan, not unenforceable, and not
invalid. On March 16, 2007, the Pennsylvania district court issued an amended judgment, which
stated as follows in relevant part:
ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that, pursuant to the
provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A), the effective date of any
approval of Mylan’s Abbreviated New Drug Application No. 76418, seeking FDA approval of amlodipine besylate tablets, 2.5, 5
and 10 mg dosage strengths, shall be a date which is not earlier
than the date of expiration of the ’303 patent (March 25, 2007)….
Under established FDA practice and judicial precedents, the March 16, 2007 amended
judgment pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A) from the Pennsylvania district court converted
Mylan’s final approval to a tentative approval by operation of law. The present situation is the
same as the situation addressed by the D.C. Circuit in Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Thompson,
389 F.3d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 2004). In both situations, Mylan had filed a paragraph IV certification,

- 14 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 17 of 25

was sued for patent infringement, and had received final ANDA approval. In both situations,
Mylan then lost its patent case before the district court. In both cases, the district court presiding
over the patent action ordered, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A), that the effective date of
ANDA approval be delayed until patent expiration.
In the earlier matter considered by the D.C. Circuit (involving a generic fentanyl “patch”
drug product), FDA converted Mylan’s final approval to a tentative approval following Mylan’s
loss in patent litigation. FDA then went on to conclude that at the time the applicable patent
expired, Mylan’s paragraph IV certification was automatically converted to a paragraph II
certification (patent expired). As Mylan then had a tentatively approved paragraph II ANDA on
the date of patent expiration, final approval was blocked for an additional six months after patent
expiration by 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i). Once its final approval was converted by operation
of law to a tentative approval, Mylan did not have any legal right to ship its generic product in
interstate commerce. Mylan challenged the legality of FDA’s actions, which challenges were
rejected by the district court and affirmed by the D.C. Circuit.
There are no meaningful distinctions between the current amlodipine matter and the
earlier fentanyl patch matter considered by the D.C. Circuit.3

FDA’s failure to apply the

reasoning sanctioned by the D.C. Circuit with regard to the fentanyl patch matter to the current
3

Mylan may try to argue that one distinguishing feature between the current matter and the fentanyl patch
matter is the March 23, 2007 Federal Circuit order that “temporarily stayed” the Pennsylvania district court’s March
16, 2007 amended judgment. But that “temporary stay” was intended only to maintain the status quo pending
further briefing and the Federal Circuit’s consideration, and did not reflect a substantive reversal or vacating of the
March 16 amended judgment by the Federal Circuit.

Although the Federal Circuit on March 26, 2007 stayed the Pennsylvania district court’s March 16, 2007
amended judgment against Mylan, that Federal Circuit decision had no effect on the applicability of pediatric
exclusivity to Mylan. Specifically, the Federal Circuit’s March 26, 2007 order did not affect the requirement in 21
U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A) that “the period during which an application may not be approved under [21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(5)(B)] shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires,” as the determination as
to the applicability of pediatric exclusivity is made at the time of patent expiration (March 23, 2007), not three days
later. Simply stated, the Federal Circuit’s March 26 order has no effect on whether Mylan was entitled to be on the
market at that time, or any time thereafter.

matter constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action, in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C.
§ 706(2)(A). The Agency cannot justify this inconsistent treatment because no lawful reason
exists.

FDA’s failure to convert Mylan’s amlodipine ANDA final approval to a tentative

approval after Mylan’s patent loss is unlawful and cannot stand. See Indep. Petroleum Ass’n of
Am. v. Babbitt, 92 F.3d 1248, 1258 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (stating that an agency must afford similar
treatment to comparable cases); El Rio Santa Cruz Neighborhood Health Ctr., Inc. v. HHS, 300
F. Supp. 2d 32, 42 (D.D.C. 2004) (finding HHS’s denial of coverage was arbitrary and
capricious due to agency’s inconsistent treatment of similarly situated parties); Bracco
Diagnostics, Inc. v. Shalala, 963 F. Supp. 20, 27-28 (D.D.C. 1997) (granting injunctive relief
based on FDA’s disparate treatment of one product as a device and another product as a drug);
Bush-Quayle ‘92 Primary Comm. v. FEC, 104 F.3d 448, 453 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (stating that
should an agency change its course, it “must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior
policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored”) (quoting Greater
Boston Tel. Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970)); Transactive Corp. v. United
States, 91 F.3d 232, 237 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding Treasury acted arbitrarily for not conforming
its electronic benefits transfer policies to its existing regulations nor offering a ‘reasoned
analysis’ for the difference).
2.

Because Mylan Only Has Tentative Approval By Operation Of
Law, FDA Should Be Ordered To Withdraw Mylan’s Final
Approval and To Order Mylan To Immediately Cease
Interstate Distribution of Amlodipine Besylate Tablets

Once the district court’s judgment against Mylan converted Mylan’s final approval to a
tentative approval by operation of law, Mylan was prohibited from selling its generic product
until FDA issued a letter granting final approval to sell. As FDA previously had told Mylan in
similar circumstances:

- 16 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 19 of 25

First, the FDA concluded that the Vermont district court’s order
that “the effective date of any approval of Mylan’s ANDA product
shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the ‘580 patent
family, transformed Mylan’s ANDA approval into “an approval
with a delayed effective date,” which “is a tentative approval that
cannot be made effective until the FDA issues a letter granting
final effective approval.”
Mylan v. Thompson, 389 F.3d 1272, 1277 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).
This result was required by the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 C.F.R. 314.107(a) and (b)(3)(v),
which states:
(a) General. …approval of an application or abbreviated
application for a drug product becomes effective on the date FDA
issues an approval letter … for the application or abbreviated
application.
(b)(3)(v)…Tentative approval of an application does not constitute
“approval” of an application and cannot, absent a final approval
letter from the agency, result in an effective approval under
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
FDA must apply this regulation – and Mylan must obey it - with respect to what is now Mylan’s
tentative approval.
As previously described, Mylan is in an identical position as it was when FDA ruled an
approval letter was required before it was allowed to sell, namely (1) Mylan first obtained final
approval of its ANDA; (2) it lost its infringement case in the district court and the district court
ordered the effective approval date could be no earlier than the expiration date of the patent; and
(3) as a result Mylan’s approval was reclassified from a final to a tentative approval by operation
of law. Because FDA in Mylan v. Thompson concluded an approval letter must issue after a final
approval is reclassified as a tentative approval and the D.C. Circuit upheld that ruling, id. at 1282
(“…the FDA was bound under the district court’s order to treat the status of Mylan’s ANDA

- 17 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 20 of 25

under the FDCA ‘the same as that of other ANDAs blocked from final approval by patent or
exclusivity rights.’”), the same rule must apply here.
In fact, Mylan was again told earlier this year that an injunction of the district court
would compel a change in the effective date of an application that had previously been finally
approved by FDA. In Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. Mylan, 2007 WL 869545 (March
20, 2007 D.N.J.) (unpublished), Mylan argued the district court had no authority to order the
effective date of an application to be changed after it had already obtained final approval from
FDA. Id. at *2. The district court held that “Congress envisioned the factual scenario in which
the ANDA had been approved, and intended that the district court then change the effective
date.” Id. (citing H. R. Rep. No. 98-857, pt. 1 (1984) (“In the case where an ANDA had been
approved, the order would mandate a change in the effective date.”)) And controlling precedent
requires that once the earliest effective date FDA can issue final approval has changed, only a
letter issued by FDA can finally approve the application and allow Mylan to move forward.
Instead, Mylan has ignored two earlier, indistinguishable directives directed at the
company that it was not finally approved to sell its generic product until FDA issued a letter
reclassifying its tentative approval to a final approval. Mylan is now selling its generic product
without express FDA authority to do so in direct violation of 21 U.S.C. §355(a) (prohibition
against introducing unapproved drugs into interstate commerce and §331(d) (corresponding
“prohibited act”). The fact that FDA was required to issue a letter of approval is exemplified in
this case because it was necessary, even after the expiration of the patent and the Federal
Circuit’s March 26 stay of the Pennsylvania district court’s order, for FDA to decide whether or
not pediatric exclusivity should apply to Mylan because its patent litigation was not resolved

- 18 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Page 21 of 25

prior to expiration of the patent. Mylan v. Thompson, 389 F.3d 1272, 1282-83 (D.C. Cir. 2004)4.
Not until FDA had decided that issue could it have granted final approval to Mylan. Mylan sold
anyway. FDA has still not finally approved Mylan’s application after it was converted to a
tentative approval by operation of law. Mylan sells anyway, in disregard of the law.
Even if we were to assume FDA’s ruling that Apotex is blocked by Pfizer’s pediatric
exclusivity until the Federal Circuit issues a mandate were correct (it is not), this ruling cannot
be reconciled with Mylan’s continued selling of its generic product. Apotex continues to be
blocked from obtaining final approval due to Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity, but Mylan is not.
Once Mylan lost in the district court, it only had tentative approval, and even after the patent
expired, it was still bound by Pfizer’s pediatric exclusivity. FDA is equating Apotex’s victory
with the Federal Circuit’s stay of Mylan’s district court injunction pending resolution of Mylan’s
appeal. Yet inexplicably, Apotex’s actual victory is ineffectual while Mylan’s purported victory
is final. Apotex’s case is the only case where a final judgment finding the patent invalid and
uninfringed has issued. Mylan, on the other hand, is in the position of a generic defendant whose
case is still pending, and who is still bound by a district court’s judgment finding the patent valid
and infringed. Even if the Federal Circuit’s stay of Mylan’s injunction freed the way for FDA to
finally approve Mylan’s application (it did not), the decision certainly didn’t constitute a letter
issuing final approval.
FDA has simply chosen to ignore Mylan’s illegal rush to the market. FDA’s failure to
act and its condoning Mylan’s continued unlawful marketing of a tentatively approved drug are

4

The FDA’s equation of Apotex’s victory with a Mylan victory is erroneous. Each decision of the district courts of
the United States must be followed. No court has overruled the Pennsylvania district court’s order in the Mylan
action, and the FDA is bound by that decision and cannot deem Mylan to have won its action.

contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious and harm Apotex. Apotex is entitled to preliminary
injunctive relief against FDA to remedy this situation.
B.

An Injunction Against Continued Sales of Generic Amlodipine By
Mylan Would Further The Public Interest

The public interest is best served by granting the requested injunctive relief, as the
public’s interest lies in the “faithful application of the laws” (Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v.
Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1998)), which, here, is served by requiring the agency to
apply the governing statute in a manner that is consistent with FDA’s prior judicially-approved
rulings and the controlling statutory language. Injunctive relief comports with the purpose of the
statute and, in particular, the need to properly interpret the pediatric exclusivity provisions as
well as the need to give proper respect to court judgments. Any other result will undermine the
balance struck in Hatch-Waxman and the pediatric exclusivity law.
Granting the requested injunction would mean, in essence, replacing Mylan's illegally
marketed generic amlodipine tablets with those of Apotex, which earned the right to market by
being the only generic firm to win its patent case against Pfizer. Apotex stands ready to ship
once it receives final approval. Pfizer also is presently marketing both a “generic” amlodipine
besylate product and its branded drug, Norvasc®. Thus, the public will continue to have generic
amlodipine tablets available.
C.

Apotex Will Be Irreparable Harmed Without A Preliminary
Injunction

A decision not to order the FDA to notify Mylan that Mylan's ANDA for generic
amlodipine is not approved would seriously harm Apotex. If the preliminary injunction is not
granted, and Mylan continues to sell its generic drug, Apotex will lose its opportunity to fight for
a leadership position in the marketplace as an early entrant. Having that leadership position is

- 20 -

Case 1:07-cv-00579-RMU

Document 47

Filed 04/23/2007

Page 23 of 25

essential to capture a sizable portion of the amlodipine market and associated annual sales that
are forecasted to reach the hundreds of millions of dollars – harms for which there is no legal
redress.
Loss of market share in a highly competitive industry is irreparable harm because of the
difficulty of recovering from a loss of market share. Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson
& Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 595-96 (3d Cir. 2002) .
Representatives from both parties that are seeking to establish a leadership position in the market
for generic amlodipine tablets have offered declarations supporting the proposition that
irreparable harm is caused not obtaining this leadership position which is otherwise impossible to
attain. See McIntire Decl. (for Apotex) (attached as Exhibit B); Roman Decl. (for Mylan)
(attached as Exhibit C). The existence of irreparable harm arising from not getting the market
share that the party is entitled to is undisputed by the parties.
The only thing standing between Apotex and market leadership in the true generic drug
market is the FDA's approval of Mylan when Mylan was not entitled to such approval. Apotex's
demonstration of likelihood of success on the merits shows that Mylan should be off the market.
The head start that Mylan has seized is rightfully Apotex's, and Apotex cannot replace that
position with any remedy at law.
The harm to Apotex, coupled with Mylan’s disregard of the law (in the form of having
been told twice before it could not lawfully market its generic product in essentially identical
situations) warrant an injunction to require FDA to order Mylan to recall its illegally distributed
product from the marketplace.
D.

The Balance Of Harms Is Neutral

Presently, Mylan is on the market. If this Court orders the FDA to notify Mylan to leave
the market and to require Mylan to recall its unlawfully marketed generic product from the
marketplace, Mylan will have to compete for market share with Apotex when it reenters the
market. Each party is seeking the same market share for the same reasons. Neither needs the
market share more than the other. The balance of harms is neutral.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein, Apotex respectfully requests that this Court enter a
preliminary injunction:
A.

directing FDA to immediately grant Apotex final approval of its ANDA for the

sale and marketing of amlodipine besylate tablets.
B.

directing FDA to immediately convert Mylan’s final ANDA approval for

amlodipine besylate tablets to a tentative approval as of March 16, 2007.
C.

directing FDA to immediately convert Mylan’s Paragraph IV ANDA certification

to a paragraph II ANDA certification as of March 23, 2007.
D.

directing FDA to immediately order Mylan to stop interstate distribution of its

amlodipine besylate tablets.
E.

directing FDA to order Mylan to recall all its amlodipine besylate tablets in the

marketplace.
