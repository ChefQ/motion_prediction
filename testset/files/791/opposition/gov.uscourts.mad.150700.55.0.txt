C.A. No. 13-10822

PLAINTIFF PAULA F. SOTO’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE’S MOTION TO STAY
For over two years, the City of Cambridge has insisted that its City ordinance and a state
statute justify its policy of prohibiting the Plaintiff, Paula F. Soto, from placing flyers about free
monthly film screenings related to political and social issues on the windshields of vehicles
parked on public streets. The City has rejected Plaintiff’s claims that the City’s policy
prohibiting such leafleting violates the First Amendment 1 and lacks any basis in the law,
including the City of Cambridge Ordinance—which contains no provision expressly prohibiting
such activity. On numerous occasions, Plaintiff requested that the City drop its unconstitutional
enforcement policy or at least suspend enforcement while staying this action to allow the City
Council to take whatever action it deemed necessary to make clear that the City Ordinance does
not prohibit such constitutionally-protected activity. The City refused—instead insisting on

maintaining its policy and litigating this case. See, e.g., Dkt. 29. Now, literally on the eve of
filing summary judgment motions, and after Plaintiff has devoted substantial effort and expense
toward discovery and summary judgment, the City seeks to stay this case based on proposed
amendments to the Ordinance that, on their face, do not in fact render this action “moot.” The
City does not contend otherwise. See Dkt. 47 at 2 (City stating that it is only “possible” that the
proposed amendments will render the action moot). Indeed, when asked to explain why the City
thinks the proposed amendments will resolve this case, the City failed to provide any response.
See Exhibit A.
In deciding whether to stay the proceeding, the Court must “balance[] the interests of the
parties and the Court.” Bank of Am., N.A. v. WRT Realty, L.P., 769 F.Supp.2d 36, 39 (D. Mass
2011). Some factors that courts consider when determining whether to grant a stay include: (1)
prejudice to the non-moving party; (2) status of the case; and (3) likelihood of conserving
judicial and party time, resources and energy. See id.; New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. v.
Converse Inc., 2015 WL 685070 at *1-2, No. 14-14715 (D. Mass. Feb. 18, 2015); see also
Zavatsky v. O’Brien, 902 F.Supp.2d 135, 147 (D. Mass. 2012). Here, on balance, the factors—
which the City does not even bother to address—weigh against granting a stay because (1) the
City refused to defer enforcement and a stay of litigation would prejudice Plaintiff’s interest in
proceeding expeditiously to protect her First Amendment rights, (2) it would not conserve the
Court’s or parties’ time and resources because the City’s proposed amendments would not
resolve this matter, and (3) Plaintiff has already expended substantial time and incurred costs
toward discovery and summary judgment briefing.

For these reasons and those stated below, the Court should deny the City’s motion and
enforce the Scheduling Order, requiring the City to respond to Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment by April 15, 2015.
I.

The City’s Proposed Amendments Will Not Render This Action Moot
On March 16, 2015, the last business day before the deadline to file summary judgment,

the City filed a perfunctory six paragraph motion seeking to stay this case based on two proposed
amendments to the City Ordinance. First, the City proposes the following amendments to
Section 9.04.050:
9.04.050 – Defacing public property.
A. No person shall post or attach, or directly or indirectly cause to be posted or attached
in any manner, any handbill, poster, advertisement or notice of any kind on public
property including without limitations motor vehicles except by permission of the City
Manager or his designee, or on private property without the consent of the owner or
occupant thereof.
Dkt. 47, Ex. A at p. 8. Second, the City proposes to add a new Section, 9.04.051, titled
“Attaching Commercial Notices to Private Property Not Allowed,” with the following proposed
language:
9.04.051 – Attaching Commercial Notices to Private Property Not Allowed:
A.

No person shall post or attach, or directly cause to be posted or attached in any manner,
any commercial handbill poster, advertisement or notice of any kind on any private
property including without limitations motor vehicles without the consent of the owner or
occupant thereof.

B.

Any person who violates this section shall be subject to a fine of three hundred dollars.
Each illegally posted notice, advertisement, poster or sign shall be considered a separate
violation of this section, and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day
during or on which a violation of this section occurs or continues.

C.

As an altemative to the penalty set forth in subsection B, whoever violates any provision
of this section shall be penalized by a noncriminal disposition as provided for in G.L. c.
40, §21D. For purposes of this section, the following officials shall be enforcing persons:
-3-

Case 1:13-cv-10822-JGD Document 55 Filed 03/27/15 Page 4 of 9

Cambridge Police Officers and designated staff of the Cambridge Department of Public
Works and the Inspectional Services Department.
The noncriminal penalty for the first violation of this section shall be twenty-five dollars;
for the second violation, one hundred dollars; and for the third and all subsequent
violations, two hundred dollars.
Dkt. 47, Ex. A at pp. 8-9.
While the City represents that “it is possible” that these proposed amendments might
render the action moot, the City never explains how or why that might be. Indeed, when asked
to provide the basis for its representations, the City refused. See Exhibit A. In fact, the proposed
amendments, even if adopted, would not moot Plaintiff’s claims that the City’s enforcement of
its stated policy and interpretation of its City ordinance and a state law is a violation of her First
Amendment rights, and her claim that the laws the City relies on do not support the City’s
unconstitutional policy.
First, the addition of “motor vehicles” to Section 9.04.050 and new Section 9.04.051
does not resolve Plaintiff’s argument that placing a flyer on a windshield is not “posting” or
“attaching” a flyer within the meaning of the Ordinance. See Dkt. 50, Pl. Memorandum of Law
In Support Motion for Summary Judgment at 9-10; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 35. Throughout this
litigation, the City has justified its ban on Plaintiff’s leafleting activity by claiming, among other
things, that it is prohibited by the existing Ordinance, Section 9.04.050, which is titled “Defacing
public property.” Specifically, the City claims that Plaintiff’s activity of placing leaflets on
parked vehicles is covered under the Ordinance because it constitutes “posting” or “attaching” as
those words are used in the Ordinance. See e.g., City’s Response to Interrogatory No. 12
(Exhibit B); see also Response to Request for Admission No. 6 (Exhibit C). But nothing in the
proposed amendments is directed towards the meaning of the words “posting” or “attaching.”

Thus, these proposed amendments to Section 9.04.050 and the new Section 9.04.051 would
allow the City to continue to contend that the act of placing a loose piece of paper on the
windshield of a car constitutes “posting” or “attaching.” It would not moot Plaintiff’s claims that
“posting” and “affixing” do not encompass Plaintiff’s activities. See Dkt. 50, Pl. Memorandum
of Law In Support Motion for Summary Judgment at 9-10 (“the plain meaning of the terms
‘attach’ and post’ requires the physical act of fixing or binding an object [which does not cover
Plaintiff’s act of placing flyers on the windshields of vehicles parked on public streets].”).
Second, the proposed new section that limits the prohibition of leafleting only to
commercial flyers on private property would not moot this action, including Plaintiff’s claim that
the City’s enforcement of its policy against her violates her First Amendments rights. While
Plaintiff has always contended that her activity is not commercial, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 38, 52, the
City has taken the opposite view. See Response to Request for Admission No. 9 (denying that
Plaintiff’s activity does not constitute commercial speech) (Exhibit C); see also Dkt. 41 at 9
(Ninth Affirmative Defense that “Plaintiff’s advertisements constitute commercial speech.”).
Third, nothing in the proposed amendments does anything to alter the City’s contention
that its policy against Plaintiff’s leafleting activity is also justified based on Mass Gen. Laws. Ch.
266, § 126. Dkt. 41 at 9 (Eleventh Affirmative Defense that “Plaintiff’s admitted actions of
placing advertisements on parked motor vehicles without the owner’s consent is “affixing” or
“putting upon” . . . done in violation of the Statute.”). Of course, none of the proposed
amendments by the City Council purport to change anything in Mass Gen. Laws. Ch. 266, § 126.
In short, none of the proposed amendments resolves the legality of the City’s policy and
its application to Plaintiff’s leafleting activity, and they do not, as the City contends, “moot” this

action. Thus, granting a stay is not “likely to conserve judicial and party time, resources and
energy.” Bank of Am. NA, 769 F.Supp.2d at 39 (citation omitted).
II.

The City’s Motion is Untimely and Unreasonably Delays Resolution of Important
First Amendment Issues
The City’s motion to stay is simply an effort to prevent a timely resolution of this case,

which has gone on for several years with the City having had ample opportunities to resolve it
through the City Council or other action. An eleventh hour effort to stop the Court’s
consideration of the issues, after all this time—and where the City refuses to hold off enforcing
its policy—harms the exercise of Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights and should not cause further
delay.
First, to avoid even filing suit, Plaintiff sought a written statement from the City that it
had abandoned its policy of forbidding the placement of flyers on cars. See Letter from Richard
Johnston to Nancy Glowa, dated February 21, 2013 (Exhibit D). The City refused, stating that
the “ordinance is presumptively valid and as such the City is required to enforce it.” (See Am.
Compl., Exhibit 5, Letter from Nancy Glowa to Richard Johnston, dated March 13, 2013
(emphasis added)).
Second, shortly after filing suit, Plaintiff proposed to stay the litigation to allow the City
Council time to consider the question of whether the Ordinance at issue should be amended,
provided that the City agree to suspend enforcement activity against Plaintiff. The City refused.
With the City having repeatedly refused to defer enforcement and agree to stay litigation,
the City’s request now for a stay—on the eve of dispositive motions—and only after Plaintiff has
invested significant time and effort to litigate the case—should be rejected. Plaintiff has already

-6-

Case 1:13-cv-10822-JGD Document 55 Filed 03/27/15 Page 7 of 9

waited nearly two years to vindicate her rights and it would be prejudicial to her to stay the case
now.
III.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the City’s Motion to Stay and order the

City to file a response to Ms. Soto’s motion for summary judgment per the Court’s Scheduling
Order.
