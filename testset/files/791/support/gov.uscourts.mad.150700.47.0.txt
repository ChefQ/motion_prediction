UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

 

PAULA F. SOTO,
Plaintiff,
v. C.A. No.13-10822

CITY OF CAMBRIDGE,

Defendant.

i

 

DEFENDANT CITY OF CAMBRIDGE'S
MOTION TO STAY

Defendant, City of Cambridge (the "City'"") respectfully requests that the Court stay this
action pending the Cambridge City Council's (the `"Council'') review of City Ordinance, 0x00A7
9.04.050 ( the "Ordinance") which is the subject of the above-captioned matter. In support of this
request, the City states the following:

hs This action is a constitutional challenge to provisions of the Ordinance both as

applied and on its face.

2. The Council, as the legislative body of the City, has the authority to promulgate,

amend and rescind the ordinances of the City.

3. Amendments to the Ordinance were presented to the Council on March 2, 2015

(see attached proposed amendments attached as Exhibit "A"). The Council voted
to refer the proposed amendments to the Ordinance to the Council's Ordinance
Committee.

4. The current deadline for the filing of motions for summary judgment in the

present action is set for Monday, March 16, 2015.
Case 1:13-cv-10822-JGD Document 47 Filed 03/13/15 Page 2 of 9

5 Should the Council decide to adopt the proposed amendments to the Ordinance, it
is possible this action will be rendered moot.

6. Continuing to litigate a matter that ultimately may be rendered moot is wasteful of
the Court's time and would incur needless costs to the parties. The Court's stay
of this matter would temporarily preclude the parties from filing non-emergency
motions (including summary judgment motions) or other pleadings with the Court
until the expiration of the stay.

WHEREFORE, the City respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. stay this action for two months to conserve the Court's and the parties' resources and
to allow time for the City Council's Ordinance Committee and the City Council itself
to consider the proposed Amendments to the Ordinance; and,

B. schedule a conference with the parties after the City Council has concluded its review

of the proposed amendments, or in two months' time, whichever comes first.

Respectfully submitted,

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Attached for your consideration are proposed amendments to City of Cambridge Ordinance Chapter 9.04
"Offenses Against Property."

The proposed amendments would serve to clarify the applicability of the Ordinance. Specifically
Amendment No. | would remove the applicability of private property owner consent from the operation of
this section of the Ordinance. Amendment No. 2 would create a new section entitled "Illegally Attaching
Commercial Notices to Private Property." This section would expressly prohibit the posting of commercial
materials to any private property, including motor vehicles, without the consent of the private property
owner. The Ordinance would also clarify that the provisions of the Ordinance apply to motor vehicles.

Very truly yours, "
