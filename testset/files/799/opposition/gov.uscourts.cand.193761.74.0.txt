INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

This litigation seeksremediesagainstone of the country'slargestapartmentdevelopersfor

t7

constructionof tens of thousandsof apartmentunits and their common areasthat are not accessibleto or

l8

usableby people with disabilities. The primary remedy-an order requiring the SpanosDefendantsto

t9

make retrofits to the complexesthat do not comply with the design and constructionrequirementsof the

20

Fair Housing Act (hereinafter,"FHA" or "Act")-is

21

the businessof design,constructionand development,so have the capacityto make the repairsthe Court

22

may require. Even though Defendantshave sold many of the noncompliant properties,Plaintiffs have

readily achievable. The SpanosDefendantsare in

24

proposeda straightforwardmeansofjoining current owners for purposesof effectuating any retrofits
"FAC") proposes
requiredof thoseDefendants.Plaintiffs' First AmendedComplaint(hereinafter,

25

26

and through that device the Court can ensuresufficient accessto the subjectproperties,both for purposes

27

The complaint herein allegesthat the SpanosDefendantshave been engagedin a continuing

I
z

Document 74

violation sincethe 1990s,consistingof a patternand practiceof designingand building at least82
apartmentcomplexes'in ten states-an averageof more than five per year-that violate the design and

4

constructionprovisions of the FHA and are thereforemade unavailableto wheelchair usersand other

5

peoplewith mobility impairments. The developmentof thesepropertieswas continuousand seamless,

6

one overlapping another,and the instancesof noncomplianceare identical or remarkably similar from

7

one property to another. Notwithstanding their sale of many of the propertiesto third parties,the lawsuit

8

allegesthat the SpanosDefendantsremain liable for their noncompliant design and constructionof at

9

least82 properties.
The SpanosDefendantshave acknowledgedthat as many as 19 propertiesencompassedin the

l0

n

FAC were eitherbuilt within two yearsof the filing of the complaint,or are still underconstruction.2

t2

Therefore,there can be no questionthat the statuteof limitations concerningthe last discriminatory act

l3

in the seriesdid not even begin to run until after the filing of the complaint. This pattern and practice has

Plaintiffs acknowledgetheir error in listing ConstellationRanch in Fort Worth, Texas and Orion at
Roswell in Roswell, Georgia,in misnumberingthe apartmentcomplexesin the appendixto the FAC.
Removing thesefrom the purview of the FAC, however, still leaves82 propertiesthat are
"so vagueand
unquestionablypled into this case. Surely,this doesnot rise to the level of being
ambiguousthat fDefendants]cannotreasonablypreparea response,"Fed.R. Civ. P. 12(e),as suggested
by Defendants.MDS 6-7. As modified by the foregoing,the FAC allegesviolationsof the FHA's
designand constructionrequirementsat82 known properties,34 of which were visited and/ortestedby
Plaintiffs. The FAC also allegesthat Defendantsmay have committedFHA designand construction
violations at other propertiescurrentlyunknown to Plaintiffs, FAC $ 45, but likely to be identified in

Plaintiffs now turn to a summaryof their argumentwith respectto the four substantivegrounds

for the motions. First, the SpanosDefendantsare simply wrong to assertthat any portion of this

8

litigationis barredby the statuteof limitations. MD 9-11,MS 7-8; MDIP 8:7-16. When seenin the

9

propercontext-th at of a continuingviolation by the SpanosDefendantsover a period of severalyears,

manifestingitself in a patternand practiceof designingand building inaccessiblehousingunits and

"the last asserted

Under Rule l2(b) (6), theseallegationsand concessions

t7

portions of Motions #1, #2 and #3 that rely upon the defenseof the statuteof limitations must be denied.

l8

Second,the SpanosDefendantscontendthat Plaintiffs lack standingto sue under the FHA or to

19

seekcertainrelief authoizedby the FHA. MD 1I-18,19-25;MDS 7-13;MS 8-11. But as demonstrated

20

"aggrievedpersons"within the meaningof 42 U.S.C.
in SectionIV.B., below, Plaintiffs are clearly
$

21

3602(l), and have sufficiently pled facts to establishtheir standingto sue under the FHA. Defendants'

22

crampedand illogical view of standing-that Plaintiffs are required to show that the SpanosDefendants

ZJ

denied rental housing to particular individuals with disabilities and to show that Plaintiffs either belong

24

to, or are suingon behalfof membersof, an FHA protectedclass(MD 12-16,18-25;MDS 7-13;MS 8-

25

The SpanosDefendantsnext arguethat the FAC should be dismissedpursuantto Rule I2(b)(7)

4

5

areat least 82 such complexes),all current tenantsof those complexes(there are estimatedto be 22,000

6

apartmentsin thesecomplexes)and all lenderswhose loans are securedby thesecomplexes. Should this

7

Court grant injunctive relief to require the SpanosDefendantsto bring noncompliant propertiesinto

8

FHA-accessiblecondition, Plaintiffs agreethat current owners of any such propertiesmay be required

9

for purposesof effectuatingthat relief. At that point it will be important to ensurethat the Spanos

l0

Defendantsare permitted to come onto the propertiesto make the necessaryretrofits.

BecausePlaintiffs do not seekto hold currentownersliable for noncompliancewith the FHA's

preliminary stageof the litigation, when the Rule 23 issueshave not beenbriefed. As explained further

l8

in SectionIV.C., below, the Court shoulddeclineDefendants'invitation to engagein this inquiry until a

20

In addition,the SpanosDefendantshave failed to show that (l) thejoinder of ownersis infeasible

22

or (2) that joinder of tenantsand lendersis required. For thesereasonsas well, their Rule l2(bX7)

Finally, the SpanosDefendantsemploy a motion to strike in an attempt to eliminate claims for

violation of the FHA and Plaintiffs' claims were timely becausethey were filed within two yearsof the

Rather than acknowledging that Havens is controlling on the continuing violation issue,

J

Defendantsspendjust one paragraphexplaining why the Court should rely on Nat'l R.R. Passenger

5

Corp. v. Morgan,536 U.S. 101, 115n.l6 (2002),MD at 11. That reliancewould be misplacedbecause

6

the SupremeCourt in Morgan expresslysaid it "ha[d] no occasionhereto considerthe timely filing

7

question with respectto 'pattern-or-practice'claims brought by private litigants as none are at issue

8

here." Id. at ll5, n.9. Furthermore,Morgan consideredthe statuteof limitationsunder Title VII of the

9

Civil Rights Act which, by its terms,is more restrictivethan the limitations provision underthe FHA.

l0

Finally, Morgan involved only a singleplaintiff alleginga seriesof discreteactsof discrimination

ll

outside the statuteof limitations. Here, Plaintiffs plead and can demonstrate,a conlinuous courseof

l2

conduct over more than a decade,with instancesof discrimination that are identical or very similar in as

l3

many as 82 apartmentcomplexes. Havens,which analyzedthe FHA and specifically addresseda

l4

repetitivepractice,controlshere. Morgan doesnot.

l5

Defendantsdevotethe rest of their statuteof limitations objection to three argumentsthat are

l6

entirelyacademic.Theseargumentsconcernhow the FHA's statuteof limitations applieswhen only

t7

one apartmentcomplex is at issue,whether the discovery rule applies to the statuteof limitations, and

l8

whether the limitations period may be equitably tolled. There is no need for the Court to considerthese

argumentsbecausePlaintiffs' FHA claims are timely under Havens. Moreover, eachof thesearguments

The SupremeCourt found that acts of steeringthat occurredoutside the limitations period were

Ignoring Havens entirely, Defendantsrely exclusively on Morgan to assertthat their unlawful

t l

claims regardingtheir similarly unlawful design and constructionof older apartments. SeeMD $

t2

IV,A.3. But Morgan, an employrnentcaseinvolving a single plaintiff suing for race discrimination,

l3

merely held that Title VII and its applicable statuteof limitations required the SupremeCourt to consider

l4

the plaintiff s allegationsas constitutinga seriesof discreteand unrelatedacts,most of which occurred

t5

beyond the limitations period and were, therefore,no longer actionable. The Court merely held that a

Title VII plaintiff may not string togethera seriesof such discreteacts to revive time-barred claims.

Morgan is inappositeto the caseat bar for two fundamentalreasons.

7

8

shouldbe given effect. See,e.g.,Schneiderv. Chertoff,450 F.3d 944,954 (9th Cir. 2006). Defendants,

9

however, effectively ask the Court to ignore the additional words included by Congressin the FHA's

"occurred," the FHA

l0

limitations provision by ignoring the well-pled fact that Defendants' unlawful practice did not terminate

ll

beforethe limitationsperiod. Implicitly recognizingthe differencebetweenTitle VII and the FHA, the

t2

Court in Morgan did not even mention Havens; it certainly did not displaceHavens in any respect,as a

I J

reading of Defendants' brief would suggest. Even Defendantsthemselvesinadvertently demonstratethat

14

the statutesof limitations under the FHA and Title VII are markedly different. Morgan affirmed that

l5

equitabletolling appliesto the limitationsperiod underTitle VII, see 536U.S.at 113,yet Defendants

Plaintiffs do not rely on any of theseargumentsto establishthe timeliness of their claims. Each

was consideredby the Ninth Circuit panel in Garcia, but Garciq did not considerthe application of the
continuingviolation doctrineto serialviolationsat multiple developments.Here,unlike Garcia, morc

4

than 80 developmentsare involved and Defendantsconcedethat the certificatesof occupancyfor eight

6

all three issues,then, it would not make any difference becausePlaintiffs' claims involve multiple

private litigant, but by the U.S. Departmentof Justice.12Finally, in Mosekev. Miller & Smith,lnc.,202

t4

F. Supp.2d 492,501 (E.D. Ya.2002), the Defendantsresponsiblefor multiple developmentsagreed

with Plaintiffs' position here. They "proffer[ed] that the statuteof limitations expired two yearsafter the

the FHA may seeka remedy if the were injured by discriminatory acts that were aimed at others. See,

The Ninth Circuit has also addressedthe standardfor an organizationpleading diversion of

accessiblemulti-family building. In Pacific Properties,the plaintiff, DRAC, pleadedin its complaint

Defendantsattempt to distingurshPacific Properties on the groundsthat the Ninth Circuit was
consideringthe appealof a grant of a motion to dismiss without leave to amend. The procedural
posture,however, was not determinative. The Ninth Circuit was clear in its statementthat DRAC's
allegations,without the need for amendment,were sufficient to establishthat the organizationhad
divertedits resourcesand had standing.Pacific Propertiesat 1106. As simply statedby the Ninth
Circuit in its conclusion,"DRAC hasalso madea sufficient showingto supportits claim of

Finally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Defendantsstill arguethat Plaintiffs' allegationsare too

Plaintiffs' injuries, supportedby evidence,is premature. Plaintiffs need only plead injury now, not

As the Sixth Circuit describedin Fair Housing Council, Inc. v. Village of Old St.Andrews,

"regardlessof whether an organizationlearnsof potential discrimination through independent

Therefore,discriminatory conduct directed atracial minorities that indirectly injures whites can

9

diversion of resourcesis only a cognizableinjury if it can be shown that somepersonin a protectedclass

l0

was also injured by the challengedconduct. In Village of Old St.Andrews,the Sixth Circuit did not

il

require that there be an allegation that somepersoirwith a disability was injured by defendant's

t2

constructionof an inaccessiblebuilding. 210 Fed.Appx. 469,2006WL3724128. Instead,it was

sufficient for the organizationalplaintiff to allege that its staff observednon-compliant steps,which

frustratedtheir mission, and took actionsto investigateand counteractthe observeddiscrimination. Id.

l5

There was no suggestionin Village of Old St.Andrews or in Pacific Properties that the organization

l6

would first have to prove that an individual was injured by the challengeddiscrimination. Instead,the

applied to absentplaintiff classmemberswho were citizens of other states,in a classlawsuit wholly or
predominantly for moneyjudgment. The Court held that where a proposedsettlementseeksto bind
plaintiffs who are not subjectto personaljurisdiction of the forum court, due processrequired notice and
the opportunity to exclude them from the lawsuit. Id. at 8ll-12. The Court was careful, however, to
distinguishits holding from the factspresentedheresaying:

Id. at8l3, fn. 3. Unlike Phillips Petroleum,Plaintiffs heredo not seekmoney damagesfrom the
defendantclass,but only injunctive relief--that they permit the retrofits to be made to their propertiesto
bring them into compliancewith the requirementsof federal law, which appliesto all properties,with
four or more apartments,built for first occupancyafter March 1991. And, unlike Phillips Petroleum,
this is a defendants'classaction. Defendants'citation to Witson v. Heilig -Meyers,1995U.S. Dist.

The premise is faulty because,as previous federal courts have held, the remedy Plaintiffs seekcan be

As countlessfederal courts have ordered,both in private FHA design and construction litigation

5

and in similar casesbrought by the U.S. Departmentof Justice,retrofitting of noncompliant apartment

6

complexesis often the most appropriateremedy in a casesuch as this. The precisecontoursof the

7

retrofitting that might be necessaryin this caseare yet to be determined,but could certainly include

8

widening of doors to permit sufficient room for wheelchair usersto enter, reinstalling fixtures in

9

kitchensand bathroomsto make them accessibleto and usableby peoplewith disabilities,and

l0

repositioninglight switchesand environmentalcontrolsso they are within the reachrangeof wheelchair

areasand building accessibilityramps to ensurethat people with disabilities can use common features

t4

like meeting rooms, recreationaland entertainmentfacilities on the samebasis as people without

disabilities.FAC U 47.
Any inconvenienceto tenantscan be minimized by carefully controlling when the retrofit work is

16
l7

done, such as betweentenancies,thereby disrupting no one. Alternatively, when current tenantswish to

l8

have their apartmentsimmediately retrofitted, the work could be scheduledto take into accounttheir

preferencesand at their convenience,e.g. that the work be performed when they are at work or away on

20

vacation. Many of the retrofits within the apartmentsthemselves,such as replacing thresholdsat doors

complain that other remedial measuresto bring a property into compliancewith local building, safefy or

17

rental income cashflows (or, at the very least,none that could not be reimbursedby the Spanos

of requiringthat lendersbejoined as partiescan be seenwhen the Court considersthe slipperyslope

the subjectproperty be transferuedto the aggrievedperson; otherforms of

Hovnanian was an action to recover attorney feesand costsby a non-profit, following the settlementof a

arguing that the relief obtainedwas so insignificant as to deny the nonprofit the statusof a
party." The court held otherwise. It said that, althoughthe sold units were beyond the courts authority
to remedy,citing $ 3613(d),plaintiff had receiveda substantialportion of the remedyit intended;and
this was sufficient to warrant finding that plaintiff was a prevailing party. Id. at 155-56. The court's

DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE IS NEITHER AN AUTHORIZED NOR A
PROPER WAY TO PROCURE DISMISSAL OF PART OF THE FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT
Defendantsrecycle a number of substantiveargumentsfrom their other motions to peck away at

the FAC, asking that five of Plaintiffs claims be stricken from the FAC.2e Plaintiffs note that the Spanos
Defendantsare using the wrong proceduralmeansto challengethe sufficiency of the FAC. This Court
haspreviouslyheld that "Rule l2(f) 'is neitheran authorizednor a properway to procurethe dismissal
lnc.,2007 WL3231738 (N.D.Cal.Oct. 30,

Plaintiffs would also remind Defendantsthat motionsto strike

While Defendantspluck out a quotationfrom Wilkersonv. Butler,229 F.R.D. 166,172 (E.D.Cal,
2005), they fail altogetherto mention that the reasoningof that caseis substantiallycontra to the very
substanceof their motion to strike. The Wilkerson court provided a thoughtful definition and analysisof
eachof the four terms referencedin Rule 12(f):
A "redundant" matter consistsof allegationsthat constitute a needless
repetition of other avermentsor which are foreign to the issueto be
denied.An "immaterial" matter has no essentialor important relationship
to the claim for relief or defensespleaded.A statementof unnecessary
particulars in connectionwith and descriptive of a material matter may be
stricken as "immaterial." Superfluoushistorical allegationsare properly
subjectto a motion to strike.
An'oimpertinent"allegationis neitherresponsivenor relevantto the issues

someone,usually aparty. Allegationsmay be strickenas scandalousif the
matter bearsno possiblerelation to the controversyor may causethe
objecting party prejudice.
Id. at 170 (internal citations omitted). A close reading of that casein conjunction with the complaint
herein suggeststhat none of the grounds for Defendants' motion to strike can supportthe relief they
requestof this Court.

The Fair Housing Act Permits Plaintiffs to Recover Damagesfor Defendants'
Violations of the Act's Desisn and Construction Accessibilitv Requirements

t0

While not using the languageor analysisfamiliar in a challengeto a party's standing,it is clear
ll

that Defendants' first target for their motion to dismiss is premisedon standing. The memorandum
t2

assertsthat Plaintiffs may not recover damagesabsentan allegation in the First Amended Complaint that

For reasonsoutlined in SectionIV.B., above,Defendantsare simply wrong in this assertion.32

The FAC adequatelypleadsthat Plaintiffs have had their respectivemissions frustratedby the
l8

Defendants' pattern and practice of building noncompliant housing, and have had to divert scarce

resourcesfrom other efforts to promote awarenessof-and compliancewith-federal accessibility laws.

perplexing. This out-of-Circuit caseinvolved appellatereview of a jury verdict in a caseinvolving
slanderand sex discrimination. The footnoted passagein Barnes, on which Defendantsrely, is pure
dictum, in that it is only a passingreferenceto the fact that the statuteof limitations defensein that case
had beenraised in a motion to strike, but not determining that that proceduralvehicle was appropriate.
In any case,this passingreferencein Barnesplayedno part in the holding in that case.

Defendantscite, out of context, to casesinvolving people with disabilities or those who soughtto
provide housing for them. While not misstating the elementsof a prima facie casein the context of an

The Complaint Adequatelv Pleadsa Claim for Iniunctive Relief

In their motion to strike, Defendantscontendthat Plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief

J

4

requiring Defendantsto retrofrt all noncompliant complexesbecausePlaintiffs have not (1) namedthe

5

owners, rentersand securedlendersofthe 82 properties,and thereforehave not stateda claim for

6

injunctive relief, and(2) allegedthat the SpanosDefendantsactually denied, or could deny, a rental to

7

anyone. The first of theseclaims repeatsthe arguments(virtually verbatim) from anothermotion, MDIP

8

6-8, which Plaintiffs have alreadyaddressedin SectionIV.C., above. The secondis basedon a cramped

9

and incompleteunderstandingof liability underthe FHA.

l0

It is entirelyappropriatethat the Court shouldorderthe SpanosDefendantsto correcttheir

ll

violationsof the FHA; after all, they are the onesthat choseto designand constructas many as 82

t2

apartmentcomplexesin a fashion that makesthem inaccessibleto, and unusableby, people with

l3

disabilities. FAC ffi 46-71. Plaintiffs seekcompleterelief from the SpanosDefendants,including the

l4

retrofitting necessaryat eachapartmentcomplex and the paymentof such sums to cunent owners as are

l5

necessaryto hold them harmlessagainstany costsassociatedwith those retrofits. Prayerfor Relief t[fl B-

't7

Successfullyretrofitting the noncompliantcomplexeswill requirethe cooperationof current

l8

owners, whom Plaintiffs proposeto add in the form of a defendantclass. FAC lTfl30-37. Although class

t9

certification has not been briefed and is not currently before the Court, Plaintiffs representthat such a

20

vehicle will permit the Court to direct current ownersto cooperatein the assessmentand retrofitting of

21

eachproperty, thereby making manageableand achievablethe retrofitting relief Plaintiffs seek.

zz

Defendantsconfusethe questionof whether the Court has authority under the FHA to enjoin

23

Defendantsto correcttheir noncompliantdesignand constructionof 82 propertieswith the questionof

24

whetherother partiesmight be requiredor indispensablein this litigation. That other partiesmay need

25

notice or must cooperatewith any retrofitting injunction enteredby the Court doesnot diminish the

26

Court's ability to declarethat the SpanosDefendantshave violated the FHA design and construction

27

provisions,and to provide an effectiveremedyfor thoseviolations.

28

As outlined above, current owners of the subjectpropertiesare adequatelyrepresented

challengethe adequacyof their representationor advocacy,Plaintiffs submit that the appropriatetime to
do that will be during the litigation on the defendantclasscertification motion, and not on a motion to

As further outlined above,Defendantmisread42 U.S.C. $3613(d). Ratherthan impairing the
6

Court's ability to order full relief in this matter,$ 3613(d)providesthe frameworkthroughwhich an

7

orderly retrofitting can be done. See,e.g.,Rommel,40 F.Supp.2datTll-12 (rejectingthe argument

8

made by Defendantsin the caseat bar in the context of condominium owners, who claimed their rights

9

would be infringed by the retrofitting of the common areasof the condominium; court held that

l0

retrofitting is permissibleas long as the leastrestrictiveremediesare employedwhen possible). Seeqlso

For reasonsoutlined in SectionIV.B., above,the Court shouldrejectthe Defendants'invitation

to narrow FHA liability to circumstancesin which they deny rental units to individual tenants. Since

l6

The SpanosDefendantsallege that the FAC is "uncertain [about] the number of complexessued

5

on," MDS 6:18-19,and seeka more definite statementpursuantto Fed.R. Civ. P. l2(e). Plaintiffs

6

have,at n.l, supra, acknowledgedtheir error in listing ConstellationRanchin Fort Worth, Texasand

7

Orion at Roswell in Roswell, Georgia,and in mis-numberingthe apartmentcomplexesin the appendix

8

to the FAC. Removingthesefrom the purview of the FAC, however,still leaves82 propertiesthat are

"so vagueand

l0

ambiguousthat [Defendants]cannotreasonablypreparea response,"Fed.R. Civ. P. 12(e),as suggested

by Defendants.MDS 6-7. As modified by the foregoing,the FAC allegesviolations of the FHA's

t2

design and constructionrequirementsat 82 knowrzproperties,34 of which were visited andlortestedby

l3

Plaintiffs. The FAC also allegesthat Defendantsmay have committed FHA design and construction

't4

violations at other propertiescurrentlyunknown to Plaintiffs, FAC fl 45, but likely to be identified in

discovery. Plaintiffs submit that the foregoingamountsto all the relief to which Defendantsare entitled

Defendantsalso recasttheir standingchallengeas a mattersubjectto Rule l2(e). MDS 7-13.
