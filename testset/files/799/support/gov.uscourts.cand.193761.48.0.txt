A.G. Spanos Development, Inc., A.G. Spanos Land Company, Inc., A.G. Spanos
Management, Inc., and The Spanos Corporation ("Defendants") will and hereby do move this
court, pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for an order
dismissing the claims of Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance, Inc., Fair Housing of
Marin, Inc. Fair Housing Napa Valley, Inc., Metro Fair Housing Services, Inc., Fair Housing
Continuum, Inc. ("Plaintiffs").

The basis of this Motion, as set forth more fully in the accompanying Memorandum of
Points and Authorities, is that: (1) Plaintiffs' claim for relief under the Fair Housing
Amendments Act, 42 U.S.C. 0x00A70x00A7 3601, et. seq. ("FHAA") is barred by the statute of
limitations as to all but eight of the eighty-five properties identified in the First Amended
Complaint; (2) Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action because
they are not "aggrieved persons" within the meaning of the FHAA, they do not claim to
belong to the protected class or to sue on behalf of members of the protected class, their
damages, as alleged, were voluntarily incurred, and they have failed to name necessary and/or
indispensable parties; (3) Plaintiffs fail to allege that the Spanos Defendants actually denied, or
could deny, a rental to any member of the protected class; and (4) the First Amended
Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to establish plaintiffs' standing to sue.

This Motion will be based upon this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in support of this Motion, the Request for Judicial Notice filed in
support of this Motion, and the pleadings, orders, records and documents on file in this case,
as well as such oral and documentary evidence as may be properly presented at the hearing on
this Motion.

Opposition, if any, to the granting of the motion must be served and filed not less than
twenty-one (21) days before the hearing date. If the party against whom the motion is directed
