PLAINTIFF SENECA IP LICENSING LLC'S OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT OKI DATA AMERICAS, INC.'S
MOTION TO DISMISS OR TRANSFER THE COMPLAINT FOR IMPROPER VENUE
On October 6, 2017, Plaintiff Seneca IP Licensing LLC ("Seneca IP") filed a complaint
against Defendant Oki Data Americas, Inc. ("ODA") alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No.
7,441,699 (the "'699 patent"). Without first asking Seneca IP if it would consent to transfer this
case to the District of Delaware, on December 21, 2017, ODA filed its Motion to Dismiss or
Transfer the Complaint for Improper Venue. In support of its Motion, ODA filed a declaration
from its "Director, HR & Legal Affairs" dated December 19, 2017 (Dkt. 10-1); this declaration
could have been provided to Seneca IP for its consideration prior to ODA's filing its Motion had
ODA sought Seneca IP's agreement to transfer the case to the District of Delaware. But, instead
of learning whether Seneca IP would consent to transfer the case, ODA decided to have the
Court and parties spend resources on motion practice.
Having reviewed the declaration (Dkt. 10-1), Seneca IP does not oppose transferring this
case to the District of Delaware. Seneca IP does, however, oppose dismissing this case and
requests the Court transfer it to the District of Delaware, where, as ODA admits, this case could
have been brought. (Dkt. 10 at 4 ("[T]he Court should transfer this case to the District of

Case 2:17-cv-00687-RWS-RSP Document 12 Filed 01/02/18 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 82

Delaware, where it could originally have been brought.").)
