Civil Action No. 3:11-cv-00342

DEFENDANT’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS
PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 12(b)(6)
COMES NOW the defendant, City of Fredericksburg, Virginia, (―the City‖), by counsel,
in support of its Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for
failure of the plaintiff‘s Complaint to state any claims upon which relief can be granted.
Plaintiff‘s Complaint purports to contain a total of five enumerated claims against the
City, based upon alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (―ADA‖), the
Rehabilitation Act, RLUIPA, the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment. See Complaint, pp. 15-21. Plaintiff has failed to state
any claims against the City upon which relief can be granted, so each of the claims asserted in
the Complaint and the request for relief (―Prayer for Relief‖) should be dismissed against the
City by this court.
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE FACTS
The plaintiff in this action is Calvary Christian Center (―the Church‖) which is a church
located within the City of Fredericksburg, Virginia. Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 17. The Church desires
to allow the operation of Fairwinds day school on its premises. Id. at ¶ 46. Fairwinds is a day

school for children with mental and emotional disabilities. Id. at ¶ 44. The Church submitted an
application to obtain a special use permit to allow 12 children between the ages of 10 and 15 to
attend the day school. Id. at ¶ 35, Exhibit D to Complaint. The Church had already received a
permit to operate a daycare back in 2009 from the city council for the City of Fredericksburg. Id.
at 34. On November 23, 2010, the city council voted on a motion to grant the Church a special
use permit for the operation of the Fairwinds day school. The vote was 3-3 so the motion failed.
Id. at ¶ 110. The Church then filed its Complaint against the City of Fredericksburg on May 23,
2011 alleging five causes of action, labeled Counts 1-5. See Complaint.
LEGAL ARGUMENT
I.

Plaintiff Lacks Standing to Assert Counts 1 and 2 of the Complaint.

This court should dismiss Counts 1 and 2 as alleged in the Complaint since Calvary
Church lacks standing to assert such claims. Count 1 is a claim for a violation of the Americans
with Disabilities Act, and Count 2 is a claim for a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Calvary
Church is not the proper party to assert either of these claims against defendant.
The preliminary standing requirements in federal proceedings have been clearly set forth
in several cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. To have initial standing to
bring a claim, a plaintiff must meet the following:
Article II, § 2 of the United States Constitution limits federal jurisdiction to actual
cases and controversies…In order to meet the Article III requirements for
standing, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that he or she suffered an ―injury-in-fact;‖ (2)
a causal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) that
the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision. Friends of the Earth.
Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Services, 528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed.
2d 610 (2000); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct.
2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). If a plaintiff fails to make the necessary
allegations, he or she has no standing. Warth, 422 U.S. at 517-518, 95 S. Ct. 2197.

Goldstein v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 278 F. Supp. 2d 766, 769 (E.D. Va. 2003). At minimum,
plaintiff would need to meet these requirements to be able to assert its claims. However, plaintiff
is required to meet additional elements to have standing to assert claims for the discriminatory
impact upon the disabled students from the denial of the special use permit under the ADA and
the Rehabilitation Act.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the additional standing requirements
under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act in the case of Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health,
Inc., 313 F.3d 205 (4th Cir. 2002). In Freilich, the court found that a doctor did not have third
party standing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act to bring suit for claims of
violations of these acts regarding her dialysis patients. Id. at 215. The court found that to
overcome limitations on third party standing, the plaintiff must show an injury in fact, a close
relationship between the plaintiff and the people that the entity desires to assert rights on behalf
of, and ―a hindrance to the third party‘s ability to protect his or her own interests.‖ Id. Even
assuming that plaintiff had met the first two prongs of standing in Freilich, the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals found that she did not allege sufficient obstacles to her patients bringing
lawsuits on their own behalf (prong #3). Id. The doctor could not bring suit on behalf of her
patients, as even patients with disabilities are often capable of asserting their own rights. Id. No
hindrance to the plaintiff‘s patients‘ ability to do so was sufficiently demonstrated in this case.
This court should apply the holding in Freilich to the case at hand.
Plaintiff will likely rely on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Helping Hand
v. Baltimore County, Md. in order to assert that it has standing in the present situation to file suit
asserting the claims for violations of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. 515 F.3d 356 (4th Cir.
2008). In Helping Hand, the Court of Appeals held that a methadone clinic had standing to

3

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 4 of 30 PageID# 139

assert a claim on its own behalf for an alleged violation of the ADA based upon the Attorney
General‘s implementation into Title II of the ADA some regulations that bar associational
discrimination. Id. at 364. The appendix to the regulations made it clear that the provisions were
intended to ensure that healthcare providers and others who provide professional services to
those with disabilities are not subject to discrimination because of any association with people
with disabilities. Id.
In Helping Hand, the plaintiff, a methadone clinic, filed suit due to a county zoning
ordinance preventing its operation based upon its association with methadone patients. Id. at
358. The methadone clinic was found to have associational standing under Title II of the ADA
to sue on its own behalf for a violation of the ADA for discrimination it had faced based upon its
association with prior drug addicts. Id. at 365.1 But see Goldstein v. Costco Wholesale Corp.,
278 F. Supp. 2d at 766 (holding that the Disability Rights Council of Greater Washington lacked
standing to bring suit on its own behalf for violations of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act).
The differences between the court‘s decisions in Freilich and Helping Hand are small but
highly important. The court in Helping Hand explained how the seemingly incongruous
decisions were reached based upon the exact types of claims asserted by the plaintiffs in each
case. See Helping Hand, 515 Fr.3d at fn. 4. The decision in Freilich is much more applicable to

1

It should be noted, however, that one factor which reinforced the decision in Helping Hand is
that the particular plaintiff was a methadone clinic. ―Every circuit that has considered whether a
methadone clinic has standing under Title II of the ADA to bring a claim based upon injuries
resulting from its association with the addicted persons its serves has found that the clinic does
have standing.‖ Helping Hand, 515 F.3d at 364. Defendant argues that methadone clinics in
particular are a niche group of facilities which will always have standing. Therefore, Helping
Hand may not be an applicable case for plaintiff to use as basis to claim standing in the present
situation as neither the Church nor the Fairwinds day school is a methadone clinic. Furthermore,
it should be noted that Helping Hand mainly addresses standing under the ADA and likely does
not provide plaintiff any support for proceeding on a claim for a violation of the Rehabilitation
Act.
4

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 5 of 30 PageID# 140

the case at bar than the decision in Helping Hand since plaintiff‘s claims under Counts 1 and 2
most closely align with claims asserted on behalf of third parties (the disabled students) rather
than claims on behalf of the Church itself.
Plaintiff has not clearly specified the specific provisions of the ADA or the Rehabilitation
Act under which plaintiff‘s claims against defendant have been brought. Plaintiff has also failed
to plead that its claims were being made on behalf of itself rather than simply on behalf of the
disabled children allegedly intending to enroll in Fairwinds day school. Plaintiff has alleged a
general ADA violation and a general Rehabilitation Act violation, but Plaintiff has not pled an
associational discrimination claim on behalf of itself under Count1 or Count 2. The allegations
contained in Count 1 refer repeatedly to the ―unlawful discriminatory effect upon disabled
children in the day school‖ and the ―significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on disabled
children in the day school.‖ Complaint, ¶¶ 133-134. The Complaint also alleges under Count 1
that defendant ―failed to make a reasonable accommodation for disabled children in the day
school.‖ Id. at ¶ 135. See also ¶¶ 149-151, regarding the same allegations under Count 2, the
claim for the violation of the Rehabilitation Act.
What plaintiff fails to do under Counts 1 and 2 of the Complaint is to allege any unlawful
discriminatory effect under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act that the Church itself has suffered as
a result of its association with the disabled students. Plaintiff Calvary Church is not alleging that
it has suffered a discriminatory impact in these two claims. It has admitted over and over again
that the discriminatory impact has been upon the disabled students. Id. at ¶¶ 133- 134, 149-151.
It has not alleged sufficient allegations to proceed on these claims on its own behalf. The Church
is only asserting alleged violations of the acts and the corresponding impact on the disabled
children, rather than on the Church. Plaintiff would have had to plead that the Church had been

5

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 6 of 30 PageID# 141

discriminated against in order to attempt to assert a claim on its own behalf under the ADA or
the Rehabilitation Act for associational discrimination. Even then, however, plaintiff would still
be the improper party to assert such actions.
Clearly plaintiff‘s claims under Counts 1 and 2 should be found to be third party claims.
These claims should be dismissed as plaintiff has failed to plead facts sufficient to meet the three
requirements for third party standing in Freilich, especially the requirement that the disabled
students are incapable of bringing the claims on their own behalf. Freilich, 313 F.3d at 215.
Plaintiff‘s claims under Counts 1 and 2, therefore, fail to meet the necessary standing
requirements.
Furthermore, even if this court determines that the Church is asserting an associational
discrimination claim under Title II of the ADA or under the applicable portion of the
Rehabilitation Act, the Church does not have associational standing to assert these claims
because only Fairwinds day school would have standing to assert associational discrimination
claims on its own behalf. The association between the Church and the disabled students is too
tenuous for an associational claim by plaintiff. Plaintiff is also not the appropriate entity to bring
a third party claim on behalf of the members of Fairwinds (the disabled students), as Fairwinds is
the actual day school that the students would be attending, had the special use permit been
granted. The Church is one step removed from standing, even for an associational claim, since
Fairwinds is the entity that will operate the school and have the disabled students as its students.
For the reasons discussed above, this court should find that plaintiff lacks standing to assert the
claims found under Counts 1 and 2 of the Complaint.
II.

Counts I and II Should Be Dismissed as Safety Was a Valid Consideration
for the Denial of the Special Use Permit.

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 7 of 30 PageID# 142

In Counts I and II of the Complaint, plaintiff contends that defendant‘s ―decision to deny
Plaintiff‘s request for a special use permit was a direct result of animus towards children in the
day school‖ and that ―[d]efendant has no legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for denying
Plaintiff‘s request for a special use permit.‖ Complaint, ¶¶ 131-32, 147-48. In fact, plaintiff
acknowledges several times in the Complaint (and the documents attached to it) that city council
stated that safety was the primary concern for denying the special use permit. Plaintiff asserts
that ―Councilman Ellis stated at the meeting that his concern boiled down to safety and ‗whether
or not it is safe to operate a special needs day school within the same facility as a daycare.‘‖ Id.
at ¶ 92. Councilman Ellis‘ statements were notably supported by concerned parents who had
children in daycare (¶ 93), a licensed social worker (¶ 94), a teacher, and a rehabilitation
specialist. See ―WRT SUP for a Special Day School,‖ attached to Complaint, pp. 87-88.
Safety concerns are a valid reason for denying the special use permit, as safety is a
justifiable factor in evaluating situations involving persons with disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. §
12182 (b)(3). In Montalvo v. Radcliffe, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a karate
facility did not violate the ADA by not allowing a student with AIDS to participate in a karate
group lesson program. 167 F.3d 873, 879 (4th Cir. 1999). The karate facility offered to give the
student with AIDS private lessons to eliminate the risk of HIV transmission from the disabled
student to other students that could possibly occur if the lessons were taught in a group setting.
Id. Safety to the other students in the program was a paramount concern in the court‘s decision
to exclude the student from the group karate lessons. Id.
In the present situation, Fairwinds day school desires to operate out of the same facility as
a before and after-school daycare. Plaintiff alleges that the day school will operate on a separate
floor of the church and at hours that allegedly will not overlap with the children from the

7

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 8 of 30 PageID# 143

daycare. Complaint, ¶¶ 50-52, 101. However, since there is still a chance that the students from
both programs would interact, at which point safety becomes a factor (see ―WRT SUP for a
Special Day School,‖ attached to Complaint, pp. 87-88), the best option is to preclude both the
daycare and the day school from operating in the same building.
The city council members did propose a solution to eliminate the risk involved to the day
care students. Plaintiff states that ―Councilman Ellis suggested that the Church have its special
use permit for the day care revoked if it wanted to pursue the day school.‖ Id. at ¶ 109. Plaintiff
also alleges that the ―City Council encouraged the Church to give up its special use permit for
the daycare if it wanted to have a day school for the disabled children.‖ Id. at ¶ 111. This
solution would allow for a facility for the day school students, while at the same time completely
eliminating any potential safety hazard to daycare students. The only truly safe measure to
ensure that the daycare students are protected from possible hazards associated with the
operation of the day school would be to not operate both programs out of the same building.2
Plaintiff asserts that there is no safety threat to the daycare students and that ―Fairwinds
has never had any safety issues with the children in the day school.‖ Complaint, ¶ 54. However,
as the attachment to plaintiff‘s Complaint suggests, childcare workers familiar with students with
mental and emotional disabilities had expressed concern over the possible interaction between
the students. The teacher felt that the ―risk was not worth it.‖ The social worker felt that the
possibility of the interaction ―should be avoided at all costs.‖ Finally, the rehabilitation specialist
stated that a lot of red flags go up regarding the proposal. ―WRT SUP for a Special Day
School,‖ attached to Complaint, pp. 87-88.

Furthermore, it is important to note that defendant‘s position need only pass a rational basis
scrutiny evaluation. See Doe v. University of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1267
(4th Cir. 1995).

8

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 9 of 30 PageID# 144

Safety concerns are a valid defense for denying the special use permit, as ―nothing in the
Americans with Disabilities Act requires ‗an entity to permit an individual to participate in or
benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of such
entity where such individual poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others.‘‖ Breece v.
Alliance TractorTrailer Training II, Inc., 824 F. Supp. 576, 579-580 (E.D. Va. 1993) (denying
the applicant with hearing disability entry into a truck driving training program). In Breece, the
court found that there was no violation of the ADA. Id. at 580. Safety concerns are an equally
valid defense under the Rehabilitation Act for the denial of the special use permit as well. See
Doe v. University of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d at 1261.
Furthermore, plaintiff‘s claims are pure conclusory allegations with no factual support to
show that any ―nondiscriminatory reason given by the Defendant for denying Plaintiff‘s request
for a special use permit was a pretext for discrimination.‖ Complaint, ¶¶ 132, 148. It is true that
―in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court accepts all well-pled facts as true and
construes these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff in weighing the legal sufficiency
of the complaint.‖ Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 255 (4th
Cir. 2009). However, ―legal conclusions, elements of a cause of action, and bare assertions
devoid of further factual enhancement fail to constitute well-pled facts for Rule 12(b)(6)
purposes.‖ Id. ―Unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments‖ are also not
considered. Id. (quoting Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc., 562 F.3d 599, 615 n. 26 (4th
Cir. 2009)). Conclusions alone are not sufficient to establish a cause of action in a complaint:
While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need
detailed factual allegations, ibid.; Sanjuan v. American Bd. of Psychiatry and
Neurology, Inc., 40 F.3d 247, 251 (CA7 1994), a plaintiff's obligation to provide
the ―grounds‖ of his ―entitle[ment] to relief‖ requires more than labels and
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will
not do, see Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986) (on a motion to dismiss,
9

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 10 of 30 PageID# 145

courts ―are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual
allegation‖). Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the
speculative level, see 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §
1216, pp. 235-236 (3d ed. 2004).
Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). See also Strauss v. City of Chicago,
760 F.2d 765, 767 (1985) (holding that the lower court‘s dismissal of a complaint for failure to
state a claim was affirmed since ―no facts [were alleged] to suggest that the policies of which
[plaintiff] complain[ed] actually exist[ed]‖); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. ___ 071015, Slip Op. 22
(2009). ―[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.‖
Id. at Slip Op. 14-15.
By asserting that there was no legitimate reason to deny the special use permit, while at
the same time reiterating in the Complaint that Councilman Ellis discussed safety issues at the
city council meetings time and again, plaintiff is simply espousing unwarranted inferences,
unfounded legal conclusions, and bare assertions devoid of ―factual enhancement.‖ Counts 1
and 2 should be dismissed against defendant since safety was a valid reason for the denial of the
special use permit.
III.

Count II Should Be Dismissed Because Plaintiff Has Not Shown that the Day
School Students’ Disabilities Were the Sole Reason for the Denial of the
Special Use Permit.

This court should dismiss Count II against defendant since plaintiff has failed to show
that the disabilities of the students enrolled in the day school were the sole reason for the denial
of the permit. Unlike the less stringent requirements of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act
requires a claimant to demonstrate that the alleged harm done giving rise to a violation was
―solely by reason of her or his disability.‖ See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); see also Manickavasagar v.
VCU, 667 F. Supp. 2d 635, fn. 4 (E.D. Va. 2009); Baird Ex Rel. Baird v. Rose, 192 F.3d 462 (4th
Cir. 1999). Showing that the denial of the special use permit was solely due to the disability of
10

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 11 of 30 PageID# 146

the students intending to enroll in the day school is a vital component for a claim under this act.
Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that defendant ―has no legitimate, nondiscriminatory
reason for denying Plaintiff‘s request for a special use permit.‖ Complaint, ¶ 145. Plaintiff does
not provide sufficient factual support for this position, thus it is nothing more than a conclusory
allegation that should not be considered by this court. Furthermore, plaintiff has not alleged
under Count 2 that the permit was denied solely because of the disabilities of the student.
Plaintiff has alleged several times that the permit was denied due to ―discriminatory‖ reasons,
but plaintiff has not pled under Count 2 that the discrimination was solely based upon the
disabilities of the students. For the sake of argument, the alleged ―discrimination‖ could have
been based upon any number other factors not related to disabilities. As this court is aware,
discrimination arises in infinitely more contexts than simply in relation to mental and emotional
disabilities.
Furthermore the facts, as alleged by plaintiff in the Complaint, do not support the
conclusion that the permit was denied solely based upon the disabilities of the students at the day
school. Plaintiff alleges that the motion to grant the special use permit failed because the vote
ended in a 3-3 tie. Complaint, ¶ 110. Plaintiff states several times that both Councilwoman
Devine and Councilman Ellis raised questions about the school. Id. at ¶¶ 77-79, 91-94, 97. In
order for the motion to grant the special use permit to have passed, the motion needed at least
four votes in its favor. As plaintiff has alleged in the Complaint, there were three votes against
the motion. See Id. at ¶ 110.
Plaintiff has made no mention of which members of city council voted against the
motion. Plaintiff has also not put forth any comments or concern expressed by one of the council
members who voted against the proposal. Therefore, plaintiff has no basis for alleging in the

11

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 12 of 30 PageID# 147

Complaint (and can assert nothing but conclusory allegations) that the special use permit was
denied solely based upon discriminatory reasons because of the disabilities of the day school
students; plaintiff has not asserted the rationale underlying the third ―nay‖ voter‘s decision.
Count 2 of the Complaint should be dismissed against defendant since plaintiff has failed to
sufficiently assert that the special use permit was denied solely based upon the disabilities of the
students in the day school.
IV.

Count 3 Should Be Dismissed as Plaintiff Has Failed to State any Claims
under RLUIPA upon which Relief Can Be Granted.

Under Count 3 of the Complaint, plaintiff asserts that the denial of the special use permit
violated plaintiff‘s ―free exercise of religion as guaranteed by RLUIPA.‖ Complaint, ¶ 153.
Plaintiff also alleges that the denial of the special use permit imposes a ―substantial burden on
Plaintiff‘s religious exercise.‖ Id. at ¶ 155. Plaintiff asserts that the ―Church has a sincere
religious belief to minister to emotionally and mentally disabled children.‖ Id. at ¶ 41. Finally,
plaintiff states that ―the Church will operate Fairwinds as a ministry of the church.‖ Id. at ¶ 46.
Despite all of these conclusory allegations, Count 3 of the Complaint still fails to state any claim
against defendant upon which relief can be granted for the following reasons.
A. The operation of the Fairwinds day school at the Church is not a religious exercise.
As a prerequisite for RLUIPA to apply at all in this situation, as plaintiff alleges, the
operation of the Fairwinds day school at the Church‘s facilities must constitute a religious
exercise. While plaintiff claims that the school will operate as a ministry of the Church, plaintiff
has not pled that the day school will be religious in and of itself. Plaintiff has failed to plead that
religion courses will be taught to the day school students, that the students will partake in
religious activities, or that religion will play any role at all in the functioning of the day school,
apart from its physical location inside of the Church.
12

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 13 of 30 PageID# 148

RLUIPA in part states that ―[n]o government shall impose or implement a land use
regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,
including a religious assembly or institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition
of the burden on that person, assembly, or institution - (A) is in furtherance of a compelling
governmental interest; and (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling
governmental interest.‖ 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(1). Religious exercise has been defined as:
A "religious exercise" consists of a specific type of exercise, an exercise of
religion, and this is not the equivalent of an exercise—any exercise— by a
religious body. "The term `religion' has reference to one's views of his relations to
his Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and
character, and of obedience to his will." Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, 342, 10
S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890), overruled on other grounds in Romer v. Evans,
517 U.S. 620, 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). The United States
Supreme Court has explained that "[t]he `exercise of religion' often involves not
only belief and profession but the performance of... physical acts [such as]
assembling with others for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use
of bread…‖
Greater Bible Way Temple v. City of Jackson, 733 N.W. 2d 734, 741 (Mich. 2007). Regarding a
claim for a violation of RLUIPA, plaintiff carries the burden of proof. ―The plaintiff has the
burden to prove that RLUIPA is applicable and that the government has implemented a land use
regulation that imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion.‖ Id. The burden is also
on the plaintiff to prove that the desired activity is a religious exercise. Id. at 745.
Not every activity conducted in a religious building owned by a religious organization
falls within the category of religious exercise. See New Life Worship Ctr. v. Town Of Smithfield
Zoning Bd. Of Review, C.A. No. 09-0924, p.25 (R.I. Super, 2010). Buildings used by any
religious organizations for secular purposes and activities or to generate revenue to finance
religious activities are not automatically protected. See Westchester Day v. Village of
Mamaroneck, 386 F.3d 183, 189-190 (2nd Cir. 2004).

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 14 of 30 PageID# 149

In New Life Worship Ctr., the court found that a fitness facility and dance studio
proposed to be located within a high school building to be used in connection with the activities
of the church located on the property did not automatically constitute a religious use. Id. at 25.
Furthermore, the denial of the special use permit for the dance and fitness facility on the church
property did not render impracticable any religious use on the property. Id. at 26. The court
upheld the board of zoning‘s decision to deny the special use permit for the facility. Id. at 30.
Additionally, the court stated that ―the religious aim of strengthening the congregation through
fellowship may not be permitted to be perverted into a justification for establishing a commercial
operation of a fitness center and dance studio that is open to the public and located in the same
building where students attend school.‖ Id. at 24. See also Community Synagogue v. Bates, 1
N.Y.2d 445, 493, 154 N.Y.S.2d 15, 22 (N.Y.C.A. 1956); Westchester Day Sch., 386 F.3d at 18990. Ultimately the court in New Life Worship Ctr. stated that the use of the building for a public
fitness and dance facility was likely not a religious use. Id. at 25. Even if it was considered to be
such, taking all factors into consideration (including safety issues to the high school students),
the denial of the special use permit by the board of zoning was affirmed, and there was no
RLUIPA violation. Id. at 30.
Although a finding that the activity in question constitutes a ―religious exercise‖ is not
the only requirement to succeeding on a claim for a violation of RLUIPA, this determination is
certainly a key component. In Greater Bible Way Temple, the only evidence that the plaintiff
presented to establish that the proposed use of an apartment complex was a religious exercise
was an affidavit signed by the bishop of the church setting forth the church‘s mission. 733 N.W.
2d at 734. The mission included furthering the teachings of Jesus Christ by provided assistance
and housing to the citizens of Jackson. Plaintiff did not present any evidence that the proposed

14

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 15 of 30 PageID# 150

apartment complex ―would be used for religious worship or for any other religious activity.‖ Id.
The court held that ―[s]omething does not become a ‗religious exercise‘ just because it is
performed by a religious institution.‖ Id. The court found that there was no burden on a
religious exercise and the city's decision not to rezone the property was not a violation of
RLUIPA. The plaintiff had not shown that the building of the apartment complex constituted an
exercise in religion. Id.
In another case, with facts similar to those in the present case before this court, the
operation of a daycare in a school was found to not be a religious exercise. See Ridley Park v.
Zoning Hearing Bd., 920 A.2d 953 (Pa. Commw. Ct., 2007). Although a daycare was a
component of carrying out a church‘s religious mission, it was not considered to be a
fundamental religious activity of the church. Id. at 960. The court stated that ―the Church failed
to meet its burden of proving that it was substantially denied a reasonable opportunity to engage
in activities that were fundamental to its religion, [and] the Board erred in granting the Church's
application to operate a daycare on its property.‖ Id. See also Grace United Methodist Church
v. City of Cheyenne, 451 F.3d 643, 654 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding that there was no evidence that
building a daycare on a particular site was intimately related to the religious tenants of the
church); Camp Ramah in the Poconos, Inc. v. Zoning Hearing Board of Worcester Township,
743 A.2d 1019 (Pa. Cmwlth.2000) (holding that a summer camp that included a religious
component and was run by practitioners of a particular religion did not change the recreational
nature of the use of the property into one that constituted a religious use).
In the present situation, this court should find that the Fairwinds day school, though
operated by a religious organization (plaintiff) and situated in a church, does not constitute a

15

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 16 of 30 PageID# 151

religious exercise that falls within the protections afforded by RLUIPA. Count 3 should be
dismissed against defendant.
B. The denial of the special use permit has not put a substantial burden on plaintiff’s
exercise of religion.
Despite plaintiff‘s allegations that the denial of the special use permit puts a substantial
burden on the Church‘s exercise of religion (Complaint, ¶ 155), plaintiff has asserted nothing
more than legal conclusions to show that that a ―substantial burden‖ has been placed upon it.
While substantial burden has not been explicitly defined under RLUIPA, various circuits have
attempted to define it in different ways. See Lovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir. 2006).
The Fourth Circuit has followed the United States Supreme Court‘s guidance and decided that
―for RLUIPA purposes, a substantial burden on religious exercise occurs when a state or local
government, through act or omission, ‗put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his
behavior and to violate his beliefs.‘‖ Id. (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Sec.
Div., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981)). See also Smith v. Ozmint, 578 F.3d 246, 251 (4th Cir. 2009).
According to this definition adopted by the Fourth Circuit, there is no substantial burden to
plaintiff‘s exercise of religion as the Church in no way has been forced to modify its beliefs.
However, despite the various definitions of what constitutes a substantial burden, an
applicable definition has specifically been addressed in the context of a school setting, which
might be considerably appropriate to the case at hand.3 In Shepherd Montessori Center v. Ann
Arbor Charter Twp, the court felt that for a burden under RLUIPA to be considered substantial
―the government regulation must compel action or inaction with respect to the sincerely held

Defendant offers the court this slightly alternative definition of ―substantial burden,‖ as the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals cases defining ―substantial burden‖ in the context of RLUIPA
almost exclusively deal with prisoners‘ rights. See Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 174; Ozmint, 578 F.3d
at 246.

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

belief; mere inconvenience to the religious institution or adherent is insufficient.‖ 675 N.W.2d
271, 281 (Mich. App. 2003). In Shepherd Montessori Center, the court decided that government
regulation does not create a substantial burden on religious activity when it only incidentally
makes it more difficult to practice the religion. Id. Without deciding for sure whether a
substantial burden was imposed, the court considered the following factors:
[W]hether there are alternative locations in the area that would allow the school
consistent with the zoning laws; the actual availability of alternative property,
either by sale or lease, in the area; the availability of property that would be
suitable for a K-3 school; the proximity of the homes of parents who would send
their children to the school; and the economic burdens of alternative locations.
These types of factors must be taken into consideration in determining whether
there has been a substantial burden on religious activity.
Id. at 282. In applying these factors to the facts of this case, there is no substantial
burden on religious exercise to plaintiff. Although plaintiff has alleged that the day
school has no current location to meet (Complaint, ¶ 115), plaintiff has not pled that there
is no other property that is available for purchase or lease or that there would be an
additional economic burden for relocating in another location. Plaintiff‘s ability to
practice its religion has only been incidentally burdened, as the denial of the special use
permit is not a substantial burden on the exercise of religion and simply constitutes an
inconvenience. Not only is the operation of the Fairwinds day school not an exercise of
religion (as discussed in § IV(A) above), but there is no substantial burden on plaintiff by
not allowing the day school to operate in the same facilities as the daycare.
Deciding that there is a substantial burden on the exercise of religion in this situation
would be overstepping the bounds set forth in the Constitution and giving preference to a
religious entity when a non-religious facility would not be so fortunate. The granting of the
special use permit would favor religious entities over non-religious entities, as a non-religious
facility seeking to house the same type of non-religious day school for disabled children would
17

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 18 of 30 PageID# 153

not have the benefit of RLUIPA protection.
In Village of Mamaroneck, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
stated that ―RLUIPA occupies a treacherous narrow zone between the Free Exercise Clause,
which seeks to assure that government does not interfere with the exercise of religion, and the
Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from becoming entwined with religion in
a manner that would express preference for one religion over another, or religion over
irreligion.‖ 386 F.3d at 189. Although the court in Village of Mamaroneck did not make a
specific ruling on this issue, it indicated that a plan by a religious school to create addition
classrooms for purposes that were both religious and secular was not necessarily a religious
undertaking simply because the school was religious. This type of action would not necessarily
be covered by RLUIPA because there would be no such protection if the institution was not
religious; RLUIPA would not apply. The court cited the following example:
[A]ny improvement or enlargement proposed by a religious school to its secular
educational and accessory facilities would be immune from regulation or rejection
by a zoning board so long as the proposed improvement would enhance the
overall experience of the students. Thus if two identically situated schools
submitted functionally identical applications to a zoning board to rebuild and
enlarge their gymnasium facilities, one being a religious school, the other a
secular school, according to standards applied by the district court, the zoning
board would be free to reject the application of the secular school but not that of
the religious school, assuming the gymnasium would improve the experience of
the students in the religious school.
Id. at 189. This court should consider these same implications, as any non-religious organization
or facility attempting to operate Fairwinds day school (a non-religious school) would not qualify
for any relief under RLUIPA.
In the present situation, the Fairwinds day school is not a religious institution in and of
itself, as plaintiff has not pled any facts indicating that there would be any religious aspects of
the school itself. Plaintiff only argues that assisting children with disabilities is one of its desired
18

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 19 of 30 PageID# 154

ministries. Complaint, ¶ 40. There is no substantial burden upon plaintiff‘s exercise of religion,
and the denial of the special use permit is simply inconvenient in preventing the operation of the
specific Fairwinds day school on plaintiff‘s facilities. Plaintiff has not asserted that there are no
reasonable alternative locations for the school to operate, and providing relief to plaintiff in this
situation under RLUIPA would be an improper use of the Act. This court should find that there
has been no substantial burden to plaintiff‘s exercise of religion, and Count 3 should be
dismissed against defendant.
C. Denying the special use permit was the least restrictive means for furthering a
compelling government interest.
Even if this court finds that the denial of the special use permit by the city council has
placed a substantial burden on the Church‘s exercise of religion, the denial of the permit was
arguably the least restrictive means for furthering the compelling governmental interest of the
safety of the children in the daycare.
It is clear that the safety, especially that of children, is a compelling government interest.
See Schleifer v. City of Charlottesville, 963 F. Supp. 534, 543 (W.D. Va. 1997); see generally
Forest Hills Early Learning Center v. Lukhard, 728 F.2d 230, 241 (4th Cir. 1984). As noted by
plaintiff in the Complaint and the documents attached, the primary concern stressed by
Councilman Ellis relating to the special use permit was the concern for the safety of the daycare
students situated in the same building as the students planning to attend the Fairwinds day
school. Complaint, ¶ 92. See ―WRT SUP for a Special Day School,‖ attached to Complaint, pp.
87-88. Therefore, it is indisputable in this case that a primary justification for the denial of the
special use permit was in fact a compelling government interest, one requirement for those
seeking to defend a claim for a violation of RLUIPA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a)(1).
Defendant also argues the denial of the permit for Fairwinds to operate in the same
19

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 20 of 30 PageID# 155

facility as the daycare is the least restrictive means to further the compelling state interest of the
safety of the daycare students. While plaintiff attempts to argue that the students in both the
daycare and the day school will occupy different floors of the Church and that the schools will
operate at different times, there is always the risk that the two groups will overlap to pose a
safety risk to the daycare students. The Fairwinds day school has already attempted to operate
its school at two other locations without zoning approval. See Memorandum from the City
Manager, attached as p. 82 to the Complaint. Therefore, it is apparent that the day school has
operated in violation of proper zoning procedures on two occasions. The least restrictive means
to satisfy the compelling state interest of the safety of the day care students is to operate the
daycare and the day school in separate facilities. The RLUIPA claim should be dismissed
against defendant for all of the reasons mentioned above.
V.

Plaintiff Has Failed to State any Claim under Count 4 of the Complaint upon
which Relief Can Be Granted.

In Count 4 of the Complaint, plaintiff asserts that defendant‘s denial of the special use
permit violates plaintiff‘s right to the ―free exercise of religion, as guaranteed by the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution.‖ Complaint, ¶ 166. However, plaintiff‘s claim
under Count 4 fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for several reasons.
First, for the reasons noted in § IV of this Memorandum, plaintiff has failed to state a
viable claim for a violation of RLUIPA. The applicable case law is clear that ―[e]valuating a
statutory violation under RLUIPA involves the same threshold issues as invoked by the Free
Exercise Clause for the most part.‖ Brown v. Ray, 695 F. Supp. 2d 292, 299 (W.D. Va. 2010).
Since plaintiff has failed to state a claim for a violation of RLUIPA upon which relief can be
granted, plaintiff cannot state a viable claim for a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the
First Amendment. In fact, plaintiff has a much higher hurdle in attempting to establish an
20

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 21 of 30 PageID# 156

RLUIPA claim than in attempting to assert a claim under the Free Exercise Clause. See Ozmint,
578 F.3d at 251; Braithwaite v. Hinkle, 752 F. Supp. 2d 692, 695 (E.D. Va. 2010); Madison v.
Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566 (W.D. Va. 2003) (stating that ―a governmental accommodation of
religious exercise, such as the one provided by RLUIPA, is not per se invalid as an establishment
of religion despite granting protections going beyond what the Free Exercise Clause would
otherwise require.‖). Id. at 572.
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment forbids the adoption of laws designed
to suppress religious beliefs or practices. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of
Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 523 (1993). Its protections include its directive that no law shall prohibit
the free exercise of religion. Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 656 (4th Cir. 2001). While
plaintiff has asserted several times that the denial of the special use permit constituted a violation
of the Free Exercise Clause, plaintiff does not specifically reference any statute, law, or
ordinance utilized by defendant in the denial of the special use permit that gives rise to the claim
asserted under Count 4. The only mention of any law giving rise to the violation is plaintiff‘s
assertion that ―Defendant‘s Zoning Code contains a system of individualized exemptions such
that it is not neutral and generally applicable.‖ Complaint, ¶ 171. Plaintiff has pled no other
facts or allegations asserting that a specific law has been enacted which violates Free Exercise
Clause in regard to Count 4.
Although Count 5 of the Complaint discusses that specific zoning code sections violate
free speech, there is nothing under Count 4 which states that any specific zoning ordinances are
in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Plaintiff bases its claim simply
upon the denial of the special use permit by defendant and nothing more. Plaintiff‘s claim under
Count 4 is deficient for failure to plead which zoning code provisions have been adopted to

21

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 22 of 30 PageID# 157

suppress plaintiff‘s religious beliefs, practices, or exercises in regards to the claim presented. If
indeed plaintiff has any claim for a violation of rights of religious exercise (though defendant
argues it does not), the claim would be most appropriately brought via RLUIPA, which plaintiff
has already done in Count 3.
Even if this court finds that plaintiff has asserted that the special use permit was denied
pursuant to a particular law or ordinance, plaintiff has failed to show under Count 4 that the
denial of the permit was not based upon a neutral law of general applicability. Defendant
contends that plaintiff‘s legal conclusions to the contrary contained in ¶ 169 are insufficient. The
Fourth Circuit has stated that a neutral, generally applicable law does not offend the Free
Exercise Clause, even though the law may have an incidental effect on religious practice.
American Life League, Inc. v. Reno, 47 F.3d 642, 654 (4th Cir. 1995).
While defendant still argues that the denial of the special use permit does not have any
effect on a ―religious exercise,‖ even if this court finds there to be such an effect, plaintiff has not
identified the specific law causing the burden nor has plaintiff pled that there is a law which is
not neutral and generally applicable so as to offend plaintiff‘s rights under the Free Exercise
Clause. Plaintiff only asserts that defendant‘s ―denial of Plaintiff‘s special use permit application
is neither neutral nor a law of general applicability.‖ Complaint, ¶ 169. A ―denial‖ is not a law,
however, and defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to effectively plead the requirements for
asserting a violation of the Free Exercise Clause.
This court should also dismiss Count 4 of the Complaint because the denial of the permit
was justified by a compelling state interest. This compelling interest involving public safety has
frequently been considered by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals involving claims of violations
of the Free Exercise Clause. In Forest Hills Early Learning Center v. Lukhard, the court stated

22

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 23 of 30 PageID# 158

that although a particular law impeding religious activity would generally violate the Free
Exercise Clause, it is ―justified by [showing] a compelling state interest arising from some
substantial threat to public health, safety, peace, or order, see Yoder, 406 U.S. at 221-29, 92 S.
Ct. at 1536-40; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403, 83 S. Ct. at 1793, and [that it] is the least restrictive
means for protecting the compelling state interest, id. at 406, 83 S. Ct. at 1795.‖ 728 F.2d 230,
240-41 (4th Cir. 1984).
In Forest Hills Early Learning Center v. Lukhard, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a ruling of summary judgment which had been granted in favor of the state which had
enacted legislature exempting religious daycare centers from complying with licensing and other
regulations. Id. at 235. Non-religious daycares had filed suit stating that these exemptions were
improper, as they provided the religious daycare centers with a competitive advantage. Id. at
233, 237. The court overturned the ruling on summary judgment based upon several
considerations, including safety and whether the activities of the daycare were actually shown to
be religious. Id. at 242-43. The considerations for safety by the court asserted in Forest Hills
Early Learning Center v. Lukhard should also be recognized by the court in the present case. 4
Furthermore, defendant has already asserted in this Memorandum that the permit was denied
based upon a compelling government interest done with the least restrictive means. See § IV(C).
Additionally, in First Assembly of God v. City, Alexandria, Va., the Fourth Circuit Court

4

Although defendant acknowledges that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reached a different
holding in Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr. v. Grace Bap., 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988) (finding
that the exemptions provided to the religious daycares did not violate the Establishment Clause),
this subsequent case did not specifically overrule the holding in Forest Hills Early Learning
Center v. Lukhard, 728 F.2d 230, nor does it invalidate the significance of the court‘s
consideration of the safety factors discussed in that case.
23

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 24 of 30 PageID# 159

of Appeals held that there was no violation of the Establishment Clause.5 739 F.2d 942, 944 (4th
Cir. 1984). The court upheld the revocation of a special use permit for a church to operate a day
school based upon zoning ordinances. Id. at 943. The court felt that ―the challenged special use
permit conditions [had] a strictly secular purpose: the promotion of public health, safety, and
welfare.‖ Id. at 944.
The principles of First Assembly of God should be applied to this case involving the Free
Exercise Clause. This court should also find that plaintiff has not asserted a viable claim for a
violation of the Free Exercise Clause in the present case, as the ordinances and considerations for
the special use permit promote public health, safety, and welfare. ―The City‘s authority to
require that such conditions be met was specifically recognized in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 91 S. Ct. 2105, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745, reh'g denied, 404 U.S. 876, 92 S. Ct. 24, 30 L. Ed. 2d 123
(1971), where the Supreme Court emphasized that ‗Fire inspections [and] building and zoning
regulations… are examples of necessary and permissible [requirements].‘ Id. at 614, 91 S. Ct. at
2112 (emphasis added).‘‖ First Assembly of God, 739 F.2d at 944. For all of the reasons stated
above, plaintiff has not made any claims under Count 4 upon which relief can be granted, and
this court should dismiss this claim against defendant.
VI.

Count 5 of the Complaint Does Not State a Claim Against Defendant upon
which Relief Can be Granted.

Plaintiff alleges that defendant‘s denial of the special use permit and its ―standards for
granting a special use permit under § 78-994 of the Zoning Code violate the Free Speech Clause
5

In considering violations of the Free Exercise Clause, it is helpful to consider the Establishment
Clause as well. ―The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment must be read together with
the Establishment Clause. ‗The Establishment Clause limits any government effort to promote
particular religious views to the detriment of those who hold other religious beliefs or no
religious beliefs, while the Free Exercise Clause affirmatively requires the government not to
interfere with the religious practices of its citizens.‘‖ Mellen v. Bunting, 181 F. Supp. 2d 619,
631 (W.D. Va. 2002) (quoting Brown v. Gilmore, 258 F.3d 265, 274 (4th Cir.2001)).
24

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 25 of 30 PageID# 160

of the First Amendment.‖ Complaint, ¶ 177. Plaintiff also asserts that its proposed use of its
real property is entitled to First Amendment protection as expressive content and expressive
conduct. Id. at ¶ 178. However, there is no restriction on speech in the denial of the special use
permit to plaintiff, and this claim should be dismissed against the City.
The United States Supreme Court has carefully considered when limitations on conduct
or expression are violations of the First Amendment. In Texas v. Johnson, the court stated:
In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative
elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we have asked whether ―[a]n
intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the
likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed
it.‖ 418 U.S., at 410–411, 94 S.Ct., at 2730. Hence, we have recognized the
expressive nature of students' wearing of black armbands to protest American
military involvement in Vietnam, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community
School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505, 89 S.Ct. 733, 735, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); of a
sit-in by blacks in a ―whites only‖ area to protest segregation, Brown v. Louisiana,
383 U.S. 131, 141–142, 86 S.Ct. 719, 723–24, 15 L.Ed.2d 637 (1966); of the
wearing of American military uniforms in a dramatic presentation criticizing
American involvement in Vietnam, Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 90
S.Ct. 1555, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970); and of picketing about a wide variety of causes,
see, e.g., Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308, 313–314, 88
S.Ct. 1601, 1605–06, 20 L.Ed.2d 603 (1968); United States v. Grace, 461 U.S.
171, 176, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1706, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983).
491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989). If indeed any expressive conduct or expressive content is to be
considered ―speech‖ in the present situation, plaintiff has put forth no indication of particularized
message in regard to ministering to disabled children. Plaintiff had also not pled that a
particularized message was to be conveyed, how the message was to be understood, and who
was to view the message. Furthermore, plaintiff clearly has not asserted how the message would
be presented outside of the Church building itself.
Plaintiff‘s allegations in the Complaint under Count 5 misstate the applicable First
Amendment jurisprudence. The use of property as a day school is a form of content, and not, in
and of itself, speech or expressive. The expressive nature of some conduct does bring it within
25

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 26 of 30 PageID# 161

the First Amendment‘s protection as ―symbolic speech.‖ See United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S.
367 (1968) (burning of draft card), Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 397 (burning the American
flag). However, not all conduct qualifies as expressive conduct. The mere intent to express an
idea by engaging in conduct does not convert conduct into speech. Instead, First Amendment
protection extends only to conduct that is ―inherently expressive,‖ and the message conveyed by
the conduct must be ―overwhelmingly apparent.‖ Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and
Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 65-66 (2006). Where an action is expressive only because
of an accompanying explanatory speech, then the conduct itself does not come within the
protection of the First Amendment.
In Rumsfeld, law schools denied military recruiters access to on-campus interviews, as a
means of expressing their disapproval of the government‘s policy on homosexuals in the
military. Id. at 51. They claimed that the Solomon Act, which conditioned certain federal
funding on permitting military on-campus access, denied their freedom of speech, and that their
action in denying accessibility to the recruiters was expressive conduct. Id. at 53. The United
States Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that ―an observer who sees military
recruiters interviewing away from the law school has no way of knowing whether the law school
is expressing its disapproval of the military, all the law school‘s interview rooms are full, or the
military recruiters decided for reasons of their own that they would rather interview someplace
else.‖ Id. at 66. Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that a ―law school's recruiting services
lack the expressive quality of a parade, a newsletter, or the editorial page of a newspaper.‖ Id. at
64. The court held that there was no violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of
speech.
Likewise, the Fairwinds day school lacks these expressive qualities as well. An observer

26

Case 3:11-cv-00342-JAG Document 12

Filed 06/14/11 Page 27 of 30 PageID# 162

who sees that a day school is located within the Church‘s facilities would have no way of
knowing whether the Church is expressing its support for the education of children or whether
the arrangement is a straight-forward, arms length business transaction between the owner of real
property and a tenant. The lease or use of space in and of itself is not ―inherently expressive,‖
and the message conveyed is not ―overwhelmingly apparent.‖ Additionally, the proposed
activity in this case is to take place indoors (see Complaint, ¶ 51), in the classrooms and offices
on the second floor of the building, so it is unclear who a reasonable ―observer‖ would be. There
would be nothing to observe. The use of the Church for the day school could be expressive if it
were to be accompanied by a statement by the Church that it supports the education of all
children or these children in particular, but plaintiff has not pled that such statements were
planned and now have been thwarted. Plaintiff is not qualified for protection under the First
Amendment‘s free speech provision.
Furthermore, even if this court finds that plaintiff‘s speech was limited, there is no
restriction on freedom of speech in the present situation. Contrary to plaintiff‘s conclusory
allegations, the ordinance plaintiff cites that allegedly gives rise to the violation was not adopted
to curtail conduct, expression, or speech. Therefore, this court should also apply a lower
standard of scrutiny when evaluating the ordinance in question. When a ―regulation [is] adopted
for a purpose unrelated to the suppression of expression — e.g., to regulate conduct, or the time,
place, and manner in which expression may take place — a court must apply a less demanding
intermediate scrutiny. See id. at 406-07; see also City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 289
(2000).‖ Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 512-513 (4th Cir. 2002).
Intermediate scrutiny should be used to evaluate the ordinance, and this court should find that no
violation has been committed.

As noted earlier in this Memorandum, there is clearly a compelling government interest
in the safety of the daycare students to justify denying the special use permit. Plaintiff‘s claim
under Count 5 should also fail because there is nothing asserting that the zoning ordinance in
question affected the ability of the members of the Church to speak, assemble, or associate with
one another in any regard. See Grace United Methodist v. City of Cheyenne, 451 F.3d 643 (10th
Cir. 2006) 6; see also American Life League Inc., 47 F.3d at 645 (holding that act in question did
not violate free speech as it served substantial government interests, was not aimed at expression,
and was narrowly tailored). For these reasons, Count 5 should be dismissed against defendant
for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
VII.

Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to the Relief Sought in the “Prayer for Relief.”

Plaintiff is not entitled to the injunction, the declaratory judgment, or the damages and
other relief sought in the Prayer for Relief, as plaintiff has failed to state any claims upon which
relief can be granted. The declaratory judgment is not proper relief in this case. Plaintiff has
filed a motion for preliminary injunction, and defendant intends to oppose that motion in another
responsive pleading. This court should not grant any of the items sought by plaintiff, including
compensatory or nominal damages, and plaintiff‘s Prayer for Relief should be denied.
VIII. Conclusion
For the above stated reasons, the City of Fredericksburg, Virginia, by counsel,
respectfully requests that this court grant defendant‘s Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal
6

In Grace United Methodist, the church argued that there was a violation of free speech when it
did not receive a permit to operate a daycare center because the church was prohibited from
gathering children together to hear the message of the church. 451 F.3d at 656. The court
affirmed the district court‘s decision to dismiss such a claim ―because in its view the City's land
use regulations were unrelated to expression and there was no evidence presented that the zoning
regulations affected the ability of the Church members to speak, assemble, or associate with one
another.‖ Id. at 656-57.
