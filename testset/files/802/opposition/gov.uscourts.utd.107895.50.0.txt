IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH, CENTRAL DIVISION
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,

Case No. 2:17-cv-01223-RJS

v.
PAUL KENNETH CROMAR,
BARBARA ANN CROMAR,
UTAH HOUSING FINANCE
AGENCY,
UNIVERSAL CAMPUS FEDERAL
CREDIT UNION,
STATE OF UTAH, TAX
COMMISSION,
AND UTAH COUNTY, UTAH
Defendants.

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS (ECF
NOS. 48 AND 49)

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 50 Filed 05/24/18 Page 2 of 4

The United States of America, through undersigned counsel, submits this
Response to Defendants’ “Objection and Motion to Strike Improper Pleadings for
Lack of a Demonstrated subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that is properly and
fully shown on the record of the action” (ECF No. 48) and “Motion for Hearing”
(ECF No. 49).
On April 27, 2018, the Court entered an Order (ECF No. 27) denying the
Defendants’ motions challenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction (ECF Nos.
11 and 12). On May 15, 2018, the Court denied (ECF No. 46) the Defendants’
second motion challenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 39).
The Court’s May 15, 2018 Order warned the Defendants that “the filing of
improper and frivolous motions may result in the imposition of sanctions.” (ECF
No. 46 p. 2.)
In defiance of the Court’s previous Orders, the Defendants filed yet another
motion challenging the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 48) and a
motion requesting a hearing (ECF No. 49) on May 23, 2018. These motions raise
the same frivolous arguments that were dismissed by the Court on two prior
occasions. For the same reasons set forth in the Court’s April 27, 2018 and May
15, 2018 Orders, the Defendants’ motions should be denied.
