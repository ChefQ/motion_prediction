UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,

v.
PAUL KENNETH CROMAR, and
BARBARA ANN CROMAR, et al.
Defendants.

Defendant's Objection

Motion to Strike
Improper Pleadings for Lack of a
Demonstrated subject-matter jurisdiction
of the court that is properly and fully
shown on the record of the action

Defendant's Objection and
Motion to Strike Improper Pleadings
for Lack of a Demonstrated subject-matter jurisdiction
of the court that is properly and fully shown on the record of the action
1. Comes now, Paul Kenneth: Cromar and Barbara Ann: Cromar, pro se, en pauperis,
Defendants who hereby files this Objection and Motion to Strike the improper pleadings
[Scheduling Order] that are being improperly filed with the court by the plaintiff United
States, because neither the plaintiff United States nor the court itself, have yet properly
identified and fully established on the written record of the civil action, all of the required
legal elements of the alleged constitutionally granted subject matter jurisdiction of the
court that it can lawfully take over this civil action.

"So, we conclude, as we did in the prior case, that, although these suits
may sometimes so present questions arising under the Constitution or laws
of the United States that the Federal courts will have jurisdiction, yet the

mere fact that a suit is an adverse suit authorized by the statutes of
Congress is not in and of itself sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the
Federal courts." Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U.S. 505, 513
(1900).

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 2 of 8

2. Until all three required elements of the alleged constitutionally granted subject matter
jurisdiction of the court, that it can lawfully take over this civil action, are established on

the formal record of the action in the court, the court cannot allow or entertain any other
pleadings.
"There is a presumption against existence of federal jurisdiction; thus,
party invoking federal court's jurisdiction bears the burden of proof. 28
U.S.C.A. §§ 1332, 1332(c); Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. Rule 12(h)(3), 28
U.S.C.A. 11
"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only power
authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by
judicial decree. It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited
jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the
party asserting jurisdiction." Kokkenen V. Guardian Life ins. Co. of
America, 511US375 (1994)

3. The Plaintiff must establish the fully granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the court
that it can take over this action, before the court can allow, entertain, or rule on, any other
pleadings submitted by the plaintiff, or schedule any further proceedings in the matter.
Furthermore, the defendant cannot be expected, or required by the court, to answer or
respond to any other pleadings improperly submitted by the plaintiff, until all three
elements of this essential, fully granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that can
be taken over this action is first identified and established on the record of the court.

"Once challenged, jurisdiction cannot be assumed, it must be proved to
exist." Stuckv. Medical Examiners, 94 Ca.2d 751. 211P.2d389.

4. It is well established that it is absolutely necessary for any litigant in the courts to
fully know and understand the true subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that exists to
be taken over the action, before that litigant can properly argue any issue in the case,
correctly.

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 3 of 8

"Lack of jurisdiction cannot be waived and jurisdiction cannot be conferred
upon a federal court by consent, inaction, or stipulation. 28 U.S.C.A.
§1332."

5. Before proceeding even one step further, in any manner at all, the plaintiff must
establish the alleged subject matter jurisdiction of the court that it alleges exists,
sufficient to support the claims, as specifically argued in the plaintiffs Complaint

"However late this objection has been made or may be made in any cause
in an inferior or appellate court of the United States, it must be considered
and decided before any court can move -~me further step in the cause,
as any movement is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is
the power to hear and determine the subject matter in controversy between
parties to a suit, to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power over them; ;
the question is, whether on the case before a court, their action is judicial
or extra-judicial; with or without the authority of law, to render a
judgment or decree upon the rights of the litigant parties " State of Rhode
Islandv. The State ofMassachusetts, 37 U.S. 657, 718 (1838)

6. This court cannot ignore the Motions of the defendant challenging the absence of a
properly identified and declared, fully granted, subject-matter jurisdiction of the court
that can be taken over this action.

Subject-matter jurisdiction of the court must be

established on the record of the action in the court. This court cannot allow or rule on
any other pleadings or filings, or allow any scheduling of subsequent matters, or allow

any other proceedings to go forward in the federal district court in this action, - including
any filing or pleading by the plaintiff United States seeking to move forward in any way
at all, until all three elements of the granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that
can be taken over this action are plainly and clearly fully identified and properly
established on the record of the action in the court.

"It is well established that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,
possessing only that power authorized by the Constitution and statute."
Hudson v. Coleman, 347 F.3d 138, 141 (6th Cir. 2003)

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 4 of 8

"It remains rudimentary law that "[a]s regards all courts of the United
States inferior to this tribunal [United States Supreme Court], two things
are necessary to create jurisdiction, whether original or appellate. The
Constitution must have given to the court the capacity to take it, and
an act of Congress must have supplied it. ..." [Emphasis in original.]
Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989).

7. In order for the plaintiff (or the court itself) to lawfully and properly, fully establish
the granted subject~matter jurisdiction of the district court that is alleged to exist, and that
allegedly can be taken over the civil action by the court, • to sustain the action in the
court; - it is absolutely necessary for the plaintiff to fully identify on the record of the
action, all three of the required elements of a properly and fully constitutionally
granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that can be taken over the civil action, i.e.:
(1) a specific power must be identified as granted by the Constitution (or
Amendment) for the U.S. Congress to exercise;
(2) a specific grant of authority for Congress to wrjte Ja_w_ must be made by
the Constitution (or Amendment), with respect to the administration and
enforcement of the specific power granted in (#1) above 1; and,
(3) a specific statute must be legislatively enacted by an authorized
Congress, that has specific application to the enforcement of the power
granted and exercised in (#1) above and made e1'.forceable with law from
a so-authorized Congress, under (#2) above.

8.

Until the plaintiff, or this court itself, have properly fully established the alleged

subject matter jurisdiction of the court that has been taken over the civil action, which it
has not yet done on the record of the action, defectively invoking only vague and
arbitrary, non-specific statutes that do not appear to establish the necessary legal cause
for the claims with specific respect to the defendant in this action, but which, are in fact
so vague as that they do not apply to any defendant as a legal cause. The plaintiff fails to
1

i.e.: a specific enabling entorcement clause of the Constitution, or one of its Amendments, must be
shown to have been made applicable to the specific taxing power alleged constitutionally granted, and
operationally practiced under (#1) above;

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 5 of 8

identify any specific alleged fundamental constitutional authority or power alleged
exercise, that is made enforceable by an applicable enabling enforcement clause of the
U.S. Constitution, as the constitutional foundation to the entire action.

It is legally

insufficient to vaguely infer constitutionality as the basis for an alleged subject-matter

jurisdiction of the court. As stated by the Defendants in the pretrial hearing presided over
by Judge Furse on May 9, 2018 via teleconference, the transcript reads:

MR. CROMAR: This is law school 101 and the plaintiff is using the court as
a collection agency without properly identifying any law, -- constitutionally
authorized law. So we object to any proceeding, any scheduling, anything and
everything until this item is addressed on the record of the Court in writing
covering [subject-matter jurisdiction] items one, two and three as outlined in
our [May 4, 2018] motion to dismiss.

9. Furthermore, claiming the defendant is presenting frivolous arguments, does not
satisfy the legal burden ofthe plaintiff to then establish what is correct and lawful as to
the alleged subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that can be taken over the action. Nor
does a claim offrivolity relieve the plaintiff of its due process legal duty to fully identify
all three elements of the alleged subject-matter jurisdiction of the court alleged taken
over the action

A court may not render a judgment which transcends the limits of its
authority, and a judgment is void if it is beyond the powers granted to the
court by the law of its organization, even where the court has jurisdiction
over the parties and the subject matter. Thus, if a court is authorized by
statute to entertain jurisdiction in a particular case only, and undertakes to
exercise the jurisdiction conferred in a case to which the statute has no
application, the judgment rendered is void. The lack of statutory authority
to make particular order or a judgment is akin to lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and is subject to collateral attack. 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments
§ 25, pp. 388-89.
10. It is now clear, after repeated Motions for the plaintiff United States to fully identify
the alleged subject-matter jurisdiction of the court, that the Plaintiff obviously cannot do
what is required by law to proceed; - as made evident from its ludicrous subject-matter

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 6 of 8

jurisdiction claims defectively invoking only vague and non-specific statutes and
irrelevant opinions (which do not provide, and which cannot be, the legal basis for a
claimed subject-matter jurisdiction of the court) - without citing any specific legitimate
constitutional power exercised or granted as the legal foundation to the civil action in the
court; and without citing any applicable enabling enforcement clause that is properly
associated with the enforcement of the specific power alleged granted and exercised in
the plaintiff IRS' operational practices. Therefore, this so called legal action cannot
proceed any further in the federal district court, and the plaintiffs improper pleadings
must be stricken from the record and cannot be ruled upon by the court without first

identifying and declaring all three elements of the alleged subject matter jurisdiction of
the district court that can be, and has been, taken over the claims made in the Complaint
filed by the plaintiff in the civil action.
"The law provides that once State and Federal Jurisdiction has been
challenged, it must be proven ... Jurisdiction, once challenged, cannot be
assumed and must be decided." Maine v Thiboutot, 100 S. Ct. 2502
(1980).

"Subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court's power to hear a
case, can never be forfeited or waived. Consequently, defects in subjectmatter jurisdiction require correction regardless of whether the error was
raised in district court." United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002);
Accord Jordon v. Gilligan, 500 F.2d 701 (6th CA, 1974) ("[A] court must
vacate any judgment entered in excess of its jurisdiction."); State v.
Swiger, 125 Ohio.App.3d 456. (1995) ("If the trial court was without
subject matter jurisdiction of defendant's case, his conviction and sentence
would be void ab initio."): Burrell v. Henderson, et al., 434 F.3d 826, 831
(6th CA 2006) ('[D]enying a motion to vacate a void judgment is a per se
abuse of discretion.").

11. Therefore, as there is no proper or complete declaration of the specific subject matter

jurisdiction of the court that was taken over the civil action that is present on the record
of the action in the court, the plaintiff's pleadings are certainly filed with the court
prematurely and improperly, and cannot entertained by it, until these live issues of the

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 7 of 8

granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the court that can properly and lawfully be taken
over this civil action, are settled. Based on the defective filing by plaintiff United States,
the only lawful action allowed the court under its limited authority is to dismiss the case.
If at some future time the plaintiff can discover and defme a subject-matter jurisdiction
path that can be proven to fully and lawfully lead directly to the Defendants, only then
could this or some other lawful court address this issue.

"In a long and venerable line of cases, the Supreme Court has held that,
without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only
note the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit. See, e.g., Capron v.
Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126; Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,
520 U.S. 43, (1997). Bell v. Hood, supra; National Railroad Passenger
Corp. v. National Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 465, n.
13; Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 531; Secretary of Navy v. Avrech,
418 U.S. 676 , 678 (per curiam); United States v. Augenblick, 393 U.S.
348; Philbrookv. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 721; and Chandler v. Judicial
Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U.S. 74, 86-88, distinguished. For a court to
pronounce upon a law's meaning or constitutionality when it has no
jurisdiction to do so is, by very definition, an ultra vires act. Pp. 93-102."
Steel Co., aka, Chicago Steel & Pickling Co. v. Citizens For a Better
Environment, No. 96-643, 90 F.3d 1237 (1998)

12. Further proceedings in this action are therefore procedurally barred by the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure from going forward, until the plaintiff makes a proper and full
disclosure of the alleged subject matter jurisdiction of the federal district court that it is
alleged can be taken over the civil action, to allow the court to entertain the action, to
allow it to proceed in the federal courts under the specifically identified, legitimate,

en/orceable subject matter jurisdiction of the court.

"If parties do not raise question of lack of jurisdiction, it is the duty of the
federal court to determine the manner sua sponte. 28 U.S.C.A. §1332."

13. The plaintiffs pleading is obviously filed with the court improperly and

prematurely, and cannot be properly or lawfully accepted, heard, or entertained by the

7

Case 2:17-cv-01223-RJS-EJF Document 48 Filed 05/23/18 Page 8 of 8

court at this time, until the apparent lack of a granted subject-matter jurisdiction of the
court that can lawfully be taken over the civil action, is resolved and remedied, and the
granted subject-matter jurisdiction taken, is properly shown on the formal record of the
action in the court by the plaintiff United States.
