REPRESENTIVE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO BE APPOINTED BY THE COURT.

 

SUBMISSION BY CTS PLAINTIFF REGARDING APPOINTMENT OF INTERIM LEAD CLASS COUNSEL
Case 1:07-mc-00489-PLF Document65 ~~ Filed 03/02/2008 Page 2of19

I. INTRODUCTION

The three plaintiffs law firms currently seeking appointment (in two competing motions)
for interim class counsel appointment are, beyond dispute, well qualified to serve as lead counsel
in these consolidated cases. Based on each of the three firm's respective qualification,
background, work on the cases so far and importantly, geographic proximity to the Court and the
Defendants, the Court should seriously consider appointing all three as co-lead class counsel in
this MDL. While Plaintiff Complete Transportation and his counsel believe that, in most cases,
only one or two lead counsel should be appointed, it also appears that each of the three firm's
bring a unique perspective and skill to the case, warranting their appointment as co-lead class

counsel.

As noted below, however, the other proposal of the Cohen and Quinn firms (hereinafter,
the "Cohen Group") for the appointment of a self selected group of firms for the important
Executive Committee is one that warrants further scrutiny by this Court. The Cohen Group's
recommendation and proposed Executive Committee appears to be an effort to `reward'
supporters to the exclusion of other, worthy candidates. Indeed, the Cohen Group's proposal
fails to include the entire `mosaic' of clients and their respective counsel from the entire process.
Accordingly, the Plaintiff Complete Transportation System and his counsel respectfully
recommends that this Court appoint an Executive Committee that is fully representative of all the
cases and prevent firms with one or two filed cases to totally dominate the plaintiffs leadership

structure before this Court.

IL. ARGUMENT

A. The Manual For Complex Litigation Makes Clear That
So-Called "Private Ordering" - As Suggested by the Cohen Group - Is Not
Appropriate In This Case.

Assuming the Court appoints a three way lead counsel (or not), the Court should not

simply also approve of the Cohen Groups suggestion for a limited, self selected appointment of

certain firms to the extremely important Plaintiffs Executive Committee (hereinafter, the "EC").
While members of the Cohn Group have apparently decided, amongst themselves, as to who
should serve on the EC (and other undisclosed `committees'), such recommendations, even if all
counsel agree, are not automatic assurances of appointment to such a position by a Court. As the
Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth), a Third Circuit Task Force Report, and logic make
clear, private "ordering" should only be adopted when unanimous consent emerges among all the
plaintiffs' firms. Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, 0x00A7 21.272 (private ordering is
appropriate when "the lawyers agree who should be lead class counsel," but when the lawyers
"are unable to agree on a lead counsel . . . [the court should choose the lawyers] best able to
represent the class's interests"); accord Third Circuit Task Force Report: Selection of Class
Counsel, 208 F.R.D. 340, 345 (Grd Cir. 2002) ("Much of the time they work out among
themselves a voluntary plan to allocate responsibility, often referred to as `private ordering.' In
other cases, however, judges must decide who should speak for the plaintiffs and serve as lead
counsel.") Indeed, as the Task Force Report cautioned:

[Voluntary agreements among lawyers may create cartel-like

groupings that favor some lawyers and disfavor others on the basis

of factors that have little to do with ability or fees, and such

agreements may also result in overstaffing and padded hours. [n

order to reach a "deal", lead counsel may have to "cut in" so many

lawyers that the representation of the class becomes inefficient and

the ultimate fee request becomes inflated."
fd, at 348.

While a broad base of support may indicate confidence in a particular group, and this

may be a factor to be considered by the Court, the significance of such support should not

overshadow the ultimate question of the ultimate leadership appointment by a Court considering

such an application. See, e.g., In re Air Cargo Shipping Services Antitrust Litigation, 24) F.R.D.

56, 58 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (although support from other attorneys may serve as "some measure of
the respect [candidates] command," the "appointment is not supposed to be a popularity
contest"). Adding up "raw numbers" can be more than a little misleading, and in some instances,
inappropriate.

In this case, in fact, the proposed EC is not actually the result of a supra majority vote
and essentially appears to `reward' certain firms with the EC appointments (and undisclosed
committee positions) in exchange for a firm's support of the Cohen Group's motion for lead
counsel.

The cases also make clear that improper procedural devices (such as duplicative filings
and/or more than two firms listed on one complaint) should not be rewarded by a Court. See Jn
re Cendant Corp. Securities Litigation, 404 F.3d 173, 181 (3 Cir. 2005) (explaining that
because duplicative complaints do not confer a benefit upon a class, "[t]here is no reason to
compensate such piling on, much less create an economic incentive to repeat it."); In re Auction
Houses Antitrust Litig. 2001 WL 210697, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("{t}he filing of scores of
duplicative class action complaints served no useful purpose. It simply multiplied the number of
individual plaintiffs and their respective individual lawyers without benefiting the class.").

In the present case, if the Court accepts the proposed co-lead applications, the Court
should allow all clients with filed cases to have an opportunity to be represented on the
Executive Committee and otherwise be allowed an equal ability to contribute to the prosecution

of these consolidated cases.

B. The Executive Committee In This Case Should Be Reflective of the Cases and
Complaints Filed and Exclude Any Firms With "Double" Representation in
The Proposed Leadership Structure.

As the Manual notes, any "arrangements" between counsel should be part of the Court's

overall analysis of any leadership proposals. As the Manual points out, the Court should

Case 1:07-mc-00489-PLF Document65_~ Filed 03/02/2008 Page5of19

"assess" among other factors "whether there has been full disclosure of all agreements and
understandings among counsel." Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth), 0x00A7 10.224. The
concern expressed by the Manual is the fact that such undisclosed agreements could potentially
impact the proposed leaders counsel's ability to in fact serve as lead attorney for all the cases and
all attorneys with filed cases. Indeed, without Court examination of such agreements (and other
factors) undisclosed agreements: "invites problems down the road if designated counsel turn out"
to be unwilling or unable to discharge their responsibilities satisfactorily or if they incur
expensive costs." Manual , 0x00A7 10.224. See also Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, 0x00A7 22.62
(the Court "must be satisfied that counsel can perform the assigned roles and that they have not
entered into improper arrangements to secure such positions"). As the Manual points out:
"While it may be appropriate and possibly beneficial for several firms to divide work among
themselves, such an arrangement should be necessary, not simply the result of a bargaining
among the attorneys." /d.

In this case, it appears that the EC proposed to this Court by the Cohen Group may be the
result of a number of `quid pro quos', (i-e., implicit or explicit exchange of `support' in exchange
for position on the Executive Committee or other assignments). Indeed, according to its own
submission, the Cohen Group already has plans to appoint its supporters to EC positions and as
"co-chairs of major substantive committees..." (Cohen Group Memorandum at page 16).

In light of this potential problem, the Court should seriously consider an alternative
structure for the EC - one unfettered by any `deals' or promises of work in exchange for support
(or undisclosed `chair' positions). Instead, the Plaintiff before this Court suggest that the
composition of the EC in fact be democratic and allow for broader representation in the litigation

as a whole. As it stands now, the Cohen Group's EC, combined would the proposed leads, only

5
Case 1:07-mc-00489-PLF Document65_ Filed 03/02/2008 Page6of19

represent a limited number of cases filed, to the exclusion of other firms, including the
undersigned counsel and other similarly situated well qualified plaintiffs firms. A number of the
complaints now before this Court list multiple firms - and the one case has more than one
representative in the leadership structure already vis-a-vis the lead counsel position. If the EC
proposed by the Cohen Group is appointed, a number of cases will be overrepresented by
plaintiffs firms to the total exclusion of unrepresented cases in the leadership structure.

For example, the Dakota Granite case lists four plaintiffs firms. Of these firms, two seek
leadership appointment - one lead (Cohen) and another on the EC (Heins Mills). Similarly, the
Dust Pro cases list three plaintiffs firms. Of these firms, two seek leadership appointment - one
lead (Cohen) and another on the EC (Carella). Thus, with just a limited number of clients, a
limited number of firms will purport to represent the entire breadth of cases filed. The only
equitable solution is to allow for "one case, one vote" and for each case filed, with only one firm
from each complaint able to serve in the leadership structure appointed by the Court in this case.
No group of firms will be able to `double dip' or to obtain two leadership appointments with one
joint client. With the limited number of cases - and the fact that a number of firms with filed
cases may not wish to serve on the EC - this proposal would ensure fair and equitable

representation for all clients.

C. Any Group's (And Any Firm's) Purported "Contributions" Are Significantly
Overstated And All Named Plaintiffs Should Have A Representative In The
Leadership Structure, Including CTS Plaintiff.

In reality, this case is in its infancy stage. Any claim that one group or set of firms is
further advanced than any other group or firm is utterly without merit. As such, this Court could
appoint any firm to a leadership position that is qualified and the case would not be delayed or
hampered in any manner whatsoever. No significant discovery has been exchanged, the cases

have only recently been sent to this Court by the MDL Panel and the submissions to this Court so

Case 1:07-mc-00489-PLF Document65_ Filed 03/02/2008 Page/7of19

far have in fact been the result of cooperation amongst the attorneys who are interested in
working on the cases.

In view of this undisputable fact, Plaintiff Complete Transportation Systems requests that
its counsel of record, William M. Audet, of Audet & Partners, llp., serve as a representative
member of the EC. See Ex. A (attached hereto). As the attached CV and the firm resume of
Audet & Partners, Ilp. reveals, Mr. Audet and his firm have been appointed to significant lead
positions in dozens of class action cases, including many antitrust cases. Mr. Audet has a JD and
an LLM, and had the honor and privilege of serving as law clerk to the Honorable Fern M. Smith
and Alphonso Zirpoli, as well as a clerk for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Audet's
firm is based in San Francisco, California, and Mr. Audet has served as lead counsel through-out
the United States in state and federal court. Among other accomplishments, Mr. Audet is also
the co-author of a well respected book on discovery, entitled "Handling Federal Discovery
(James Publishing, 1995-2007)(with special comments by the Honorable Fern M. Smith). His
firm is comprised of a number of wel! respected members of the plaintiffs bar, If appointed, Mr.
Audet will personally commit to work on the case - not just hand the case off to another attorney

in his firm.

Ul. CONCLUSION

In light of their geographic location and proximity to the Courthouse and their respective
qualifications, the two `competing' motions by the Cohen Group and the Whatley Group should
be granted. These three firms appear to represent the "best of the best" for this case.

Nonetheless, the undersigned counsel respectfully requests that a more democratically

selected group of attorneys and plaintiffs firms be appointed by this Court to serve on the EC. If
