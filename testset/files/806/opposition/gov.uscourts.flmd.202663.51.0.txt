DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
AMEND (Doc. 49) AND TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXTEND TIME
(Doc. 50) , WITH INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT

COMES NOW Defendants, and through their undersigned counsel file their
Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 49) and to Plaintiff's Motion to
Extend Time (Doc. 50).

1. Defendants oppose both Motions (Doc. 49 and Doc. 50).

2. Plaintiff did not consult with undersigned counsel in advance of filing
either Motion, so Plaintiff failed to comply with Local Rule 3.01(g).

Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 49)

3. Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 49) comes almost one year
after the Case Management Order (Doc. 20) advised the parties that such motions filed
after the Case Management Order are "disfavored", referring to Rules 3.05(c)(2)(E). The
Motion fails to attach a copy of Plaintiff's proposed amended pleading as required by

Rule 4.01(a). Amendment of the pleadings at this late stage would prejudice Defendants.

Maynard v. Board of Regents, 342 F.3d 1281, 1286-87 (11"0x2122 Cir. 2003) (district court did

not abuse discretion in denying plaintiff's motion for leave to amend, filed on last day of
extended discovery period, because amendment "would have produced more attempts at
discovery, delayed disposition of the case, and likely prejudiced" the defendant, and there
was no good reason why plaintiff could not have filed motion earlier). Finally, Plaintiff
has stated no "Justifying reason" that would form a basis for granting his request. Beren
v. Raymond James, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21249 (M.D. Fla. 2009), citing to Foman vy.
Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).

Plaintiff's Motion to Extend Time (Doc. 50)

4. Plaintiff also seeks to file amended responses to the Defendants' Motions
for Summary Judgment, Previously, the Court has twice granted extensions of time
permitting Plaintiff additional time to respond to Defendants' Motions for Summary
Judgment (Docs. 39, 45). Plaintiff has now filed Responses (Docs. 46 through 48), but
now wants to file amended Responses. The reasons given are that he doesn't have a
lawyer and that he is "addressing medical issues".

5. Defendants oppose Plaintiff's Motion. Plaintiff has provided no
explanation of why he could not have presented his arguments before his twice-extended
deadline. Denial of the Motion is justified on that basis alone. Keeler v. Dept. of Health,
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8880 (11" Cir, 2009).

For the reasons stated, both Motions should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
