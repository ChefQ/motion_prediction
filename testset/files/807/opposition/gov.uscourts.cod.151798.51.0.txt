INTRODUCTION
Defendant The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”) submits this brief in opposition to the
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (Dkt. 49, the “Motion” or “Mot.”).
Plaintiffs’ hyperbolic rhetoric—inventing a so-called “Forced Labor Policy,”
gratuitously invoking images of the “master’s whip,” “slave-like conditions,” and a
“captive workforce” that is “exploit[ed] conscripted, coerced, and underpaid,” Mot. at 3,
17, 21—is no substitute for their lack of a factual or legal basis for this case. It is
undisputed that Plaintiffs—and the putative class members—were (or are) lawfully
detained at GEO’s Aurora facility, pursuant to a contract between GEO and Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). The requirement that detainees perform household
chores, as well as the allowance of $1.00 per day for participating in a voluntary work
program, are fully authorized by the federal government—and have been for decades.
Plaintiffs clearly dislike the ICE policies that authorize required housekeeping by
detainees, and ICE’s Voluntary Work Program (“VWP”) that is administered and
supervised by GEO. Yet, rather than submit their grievances to Congress or raise a
challenge to ICE, Plaintiffs ask this Court to certify a class of 50,000 to 60,000 detainees
based on a claim that GEO subjects detainees to “forced labor” in violation of the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589 et seq., and to certify
another class of detainees who are alleged to have “unjustly enriched” GEO through their
own, voluntary choice to participate in a work program. Plaintiffs have not identified a
single case in which a court has certified a class in circumstances remotely comparable.
1

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 56

This Court should not be the first to do so. Both proposed classes fall woefully short of
meeting the strict requirements for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 23, and certification must therefore be denied.
BACKGROUND
GEO has already exposed in detail the legal deficiencies in both of Plaintiffs’
remaining claims.

Their TVPA claim is at odds with multiple, basic principles of

statutory construction, as well as with common sense.

See GEO Mot. for

Reconsideration (Dkt. 29) at 10–23; GEO Mot. to Certify and Stay (Dkt. 38) at 7–10.
Likewise, Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim fails because Plaintiffs—who are not
employees in any sense—did not allege, and could never show, a “reasonable
expectation” of being paid more than $1.00 per day for participating in the VWP. See,
e.g., Stanford v. Ronald H. Mayer Real Estate, 849 P.2d 921, 923 (Colo. App. 1993);
Britvar v. Schainuck, 791 P.2d 1183, 1184 (Colo. App. 1989) (“[A] plaintiff cannot
recover for unjust enrichment . . . for services rendered absent proof of circumstances
indicating that compensation is reasonably expected.”).

See also GEO Mot. for

Reconsideration, at 23–28; GEO Mot. to Certify and Stay, at 11–13.

GEO is not

attempting to reargue the merits of the Plaintiffs’ remaining claims at this juncture. But
to understand the class action issues, it is necessary to have some background on the
work programs at the Aurora facility and the legal framework in which they are
administered.

I.

GEO Lawfully Administers And Supervises Detainee Housekeeping And The
Voluntary Work Program Pursuant To Its Contract With ICE.
The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) confers on ICE broad authority to

detain aliens pending removal or a removal hearing, and mandates that ICE detain certain
categories of aliens. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225, 1226, 1226a, 1231. ICE has responsibility to
provide safe, secure, and humane confinement for aliens in the United States who may be
subject to removal. See id. ICE also has authority to contract with private sector entities,
such as GEO, to provide secure facilities. Id. § 1231(g). ICE may disburse funds at the
discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Id. §§ 1103(a), (c).
Detainees at the Aurora facility are required to perform certain housekeeping
duties in their common living areas without pay, and detainees may also volunteer to
participate in the federally-authorized VWP for $1.00 per day.

Both the work

requirement and payment for voluntary work are entirely lawful, and conform to ICE’s
standards as well as GEO’s ICE-approved policies and contractual obligations.
A.

The Requirement That Detainees Perform Housekeeping Chores Is
Lawful.

Proper sanitation at the Aurora facility is crucial. See Deposition of Dawn Ceja
(Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 81:11-23 (“Ceja Dep.”). Consequently, ICE requires that detention
facilities “maintain the highest sanitation standards at all times in all locations without
exception.” See ICE Aurora Facility Detainee Handbook (“ICE Aurora Handbook”)
(GEO Ex. 1) at PL000046; Performance-Based Nat’l Detention Standards 2011
(“PBNDS”) (GEO Ex. 2) § 1.2 (V.A.3); ICE Nat’l Detainee Handbook (GEO Ex. 3), at

3

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 56

PL000092. This is done through “an organized, supervised and continuous program of
daily cleaning by all detainees[.]” ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO Ex. 1) at PL000046;
Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 36:8-36:23. GEO administers and supervises an ICE-approved
program for implementing these requirements. See, e.g., Aurora Detention Center, Policy
and Procedure Manual (“P&P”) (Pl.’s Ex. 2) § 12.1.4 (GEO_MEN 00001510-13)
(bearing ICE approval); Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 39:17-40:25, 125:24-134:25 (testifying
that ICE’s detention standards authorize the housekeeping duties requirement at Aurora).
The program involves two overlapping types of duties: personal housekeeping and
cleaning of common living areas. See Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 36:8–37:22, 39:17–
40:25, 128:20–131:16, 133:15–134:25; PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2) §§ 1.2 (V.A.3), 5.8 (V.C).
First, all detainees are required to keep their “personal living area clean and sanitary,”
including the bunk and immediate floor area about and under the bunk, locker and any
personal items. ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO Ex. 1) at PL000046 (emphasis added); see
also PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2) § 5.8 (V.C). Second, ICE also requires that “[e]ach and every
detainee … participate in the facility’s sanitation program.” ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO
Ex. 1), at PL000047; PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2) § 1.2 (V.A.3) (“staff and detainees [must]
maintain a high standard of facility sanitation and general cleanliness”). The “[h]ousing
units and all common areas must be kept clean and should be ready for inspection at any
time.” ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO Ex. 1) at PL000046.1 A list of detainees designated

1

Plaintiffs inaccurately argue that GEO has misinterpreted ICE standards to “give [GEO]
carte blanche to assign detainees to perform almost any janitorial work it requires in the
detention pods.” Mot. at 5. This simply ignores that the ICE Aurora Handbook and the ICE4

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 56

to perform duties is developed each day by staff and is posted daily for viewing by
detainees. Id. at PL000047. Additionally, ICE specifies that the Housing Unit Officer is
responsible for assuring that a general cleanup is done on a regular basis, and “all
detainees” must participate during a general cleanup. Id.; Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at
36:24-37:22; 40:7-25.2
Under ICE policy, “[r]efusal to clean [an] assigned living area” constitutes a 300level “high moderate” offense, which could result in the typical sanctions of a warning or
reprimand. See PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2), App’x 3.1.A, § III; Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at
51:12-52:23; 79:19-25. A permissible, but rare, step is to place a detainee in disciplinary
segregation. Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 88:24-90:3. If this rare step is taken, the detainee
is initially placed in administrative segregation while awaiting a hearing. Id. at 57:1558:5.

In administrative segregation, detainees are still allowed to watch television,

although their amount of social time is reduced to 2 hours. Id. at 54:4-12, 55:15-19.
GEO’s corporate representative, Ms. Dawn Ceja, could recall only one instance where a
detainee “complained about being put into seg for a cleaning issue.” Id. at 69:5-22,
71:12-18. In fact, those who are placed in administrative segregation (if found “guilty”)
are usually sentenced to “time-served” and never spend any time in disciplinary
approved policies and procedures for sanitation at Aurora require the cleaning of “common
areas.” ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO Ex. 1) at PL000046; P&P (Pl.’s Ex. 2) § 12.1.4
(GEO_MEN 00001511).
2

Not all of the housekeeping in the common areas of the facilities is done by detainees.
The Aurora facility’s maintenance department performs upkeep and preventative maintenance on
the facility’s HVAC systems and rooftop units, changes filters and lightbulbs. Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s
Ex. 1), at 19:21-20:13. Aurora has one janitor, but her tasks are generally focused on
administrative areas outside of the detainees’ common living areas. Id. at 101:6-16.
5

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 14 of 56

segregation. Id. at 57:15-58:5. This is perhaps why Plaintiffs have offered no evidence
of any detainee being placed in disciplinary segregation for refusing to perform the
required housecleaning responsibilities.3

None of the Plaintiffs or other detainees who

submitted declarations in support of the Motion state that they themselves have been
placed in segregation for refusing to clean.
Courts have repeatedly upheld requirements that federal detainees perform
housekeeping chores without pay (or for minimal pay). See, e.g., Channer v. Hall, 112
F.3d 214, 219 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that “the federal government is entitled to require
a communal contribution by an INS detainee in the form of housekeeping tasks”); Hause
v. Vaught, 993 F.2d 1079, 1081, 1085 (4th Cir. 1993) (holding that pretrial detainees may
be required to “assist in cleaning the common areas of their cell-block”); Bijeol v. Nelson,

Some declarants state that they believe other detainees were put in segregation for
refusing to clean, but this evidence is unreliable. For example, Alejandro Hernandez Torres’
declaration states that non-plaintiff detainees Ricardo Tinoco and Cesar Duran were placed in
segregation for refusing to clean, but a review of their files reveals that they were not. See Ceja

the Thirteenth Amendment.”).
In this case, the plaintiff and non-plaintiff declarants uniformly state that they
were required to perform cleaning work in private and common living areas without pay.

a detainee.4

General housekeeping duties have been deemed to include a wide range of activities,

sanitation” through the ICE-authorized VWP. ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO Ex. 1), at
PL000036; ICE Nat’l Detainee Handbook (GEO Ex. 3), at PL000092; PBNDS (GEO Ex.
2) § 5.8. GEO administers and supervises the VWP at Aurora pursuant to ICE standards,
and under the terms of the ICE-approved Aurora policies and procedures. See P&P (Pl.’s
Ex. 13) § 8.1.8

(GEO_MEN 00001395) (bearing signature of approval from ICE

officer).
The VWP has several objectives: (1) to allow physically and mentally able
detainees to be gainfully employed while contributing to the orderly operation of the
facility; (2) to improve essential operations and services through the productivity of
detainees; and (3) to reduce inactivity-induced idleness and disciplinary-code violations.
P&P (Pl.’s Ex. 13) § 8.1.8 (GEO_MEN 00001395); see PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2) § 5.8.
In contrast to the ICE-approved housekeeping chores, all work under the VWP is
performed on a voluntary basis. P&P (Pl.’s Ex. 13) § 8.1.8 (GEO_MEN 00001395)
(“Work assignments are voluntary.”). The facility’s Classification Officer selects and
assigns eligible workers for job vacancies, based on numerous factors including
classification level, criminal history, escape history and medical status. ICE Aurora
Handbook (GEO Ex. 1), at PL000036. Up to 80 people per day work in the VWP at
Aurora. Deposition of Melody Furst (Pl.’s Ex. 14), at 12:5-8 (“Furst Dep.”).

No

detainee is allowed to work more than one shift (or eight hours per day), and no more
than 40 hours per week. Id. at 42:7-9; P&P (Pl.’s Ex. 13) § 8.1.8 (GEO_MEN 0000139697). And detainees may be removed from the program for unexcused absences or

unsatisfactory performance or specified inappropriate behavior.
§ 8.1.8 (GEO_MEN 00001397).

P&P (Pl.’s Ex. 13)

All of the rules pertaining to the VWP are

communicated to each participant in a language or manner the detainee can understand.
Id. at 00001398.
Detainees receive training on job tasks and safety and medical treatment when
needed. Id. at GEO_MEN 00001398-99. Detainees’ performance is regularly evaluated
and recorded, and detainees receive written recognition of competencies that they
acquire. Id. at GEO_MEN 00001397. Indeed, it is common for GEO’s detention officers
to work along with detainees who are performing VWP jobs. See Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1),
at 168:7-170:3; id. at 169:22-170:3 (“Q. … They’re actually cooking the meals, is that
right, or are they standing guard while the detainees cook meals? A. It’s both. … They’re
assisting and supervising.”).
ICE states that “[d]etainees shall receive monetary compensation for work
completed in accordance with the facility’s standard policy. The compensation is at least
$1.00 (USD) per day.” PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2) § 5.8 (V.K). Thus, a facility may lawfully
provide an allowance of $1.00 per day under ICE policy. GEO’s standard policy for
Aurora provides that detainees shall receive an allowance (or “stipend”) of $1.00 per day,
paid daily. Furst Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 14), at 44:2-5; P&P (Pl.’s Ex. 13) § 8.1.8 (GEO_MEN
00001397). GEO pays the amount directly to detainees on a daily basis, and then GEO is
reimbursed by ICE. Furst Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 14), at 34:24-35:8, 42:22-43:6. The $1.00 per
day allowance accords with the reimbursement rate for VWP work determined by the
9

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 18 of 56

contract between ICE and GEO. Ceja Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 185:14-19, 187:1-8; Furst
Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 14), at 39:12-40:10, 46:5-12; Dkt. 11-2, Ex. C at 3 (providing for
reimbursement “at actual cost of $1.00 per day per detainee” and that GEO “shall not
exceed the quantity shown without prior approval by the Contracting Officer”).
The $1.00 per day is Congressionally authorized. From 1950 to 1979, Congress
authorized “payment of allowances . . . to aliens, while held in custody under the
immigration laws, for work performed.” 8 U.S.C. § 1555(d); Act of July 28, 1950, 64
Stat. 380, ch. 503, § 6. But the amount to be paid was left to be “specified from time to
time in the appropriation Act involved” for each fiscal year. 8 U.S.C. § 1555(d). The
appropriations bills for this time period authorized reimbursement for the VWP program
“at a rate not in excess of $1.00 per day.” See, e.g., Dep’t of Justice Appropriation Act,
1979, Pub. L. No. 95-431, 92 Stat. 1021, 1027 (Oct. 18, 1978); Dep’t of Justice
Appropriation Act, 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-86, 91 Stat. 419, 426 (Aug. 2, 1977).
After the 1979 appropriation, Congress ceased specifically appropriating monies
for the VWP program, opting instead to provide more general appropriations
authorization. See Dep’t of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, 1979, Pub. L. No.
96-132, § 2(10), 93 Stat. 1040, 1042 (1979) (“Section 2(10)”) (appropriating funds to the
INS “for expenses necessary for the administration and enforcement of the laws relating
to immigration . . ., including—(B) payment of allowances to aliens, while held in
custody under the immigration laws, for work performed….” ). Under this more general
authority, INS (and now ICE) retained authority to reimburse VWP detainees, but
10

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 19 of 56

without the requirement that “Congress [] set the rate of compensation for each fiscal
year.” See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Your CO 243C Memorandum of November 15, 1991: DOD Request for Alien Labor, General Counsel
Op. No. 92-63, 1992 WL 1369402, at *1 (Nov. 13, 1992) (citing 93 Stat. at 1042).5
Today, the rate for VWP reimbursement is typically dictated—as it is here—by the
contract between ICE and each individual detention facility.

The $1.00 per day

allowance, then, is “a matter of legislative [and agency] discretion.” See Guevara v. INS,
No. 90-1476, 1992 WL 1029, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 6, 1992) (unpublished). Plaintiffs have
identified no lawful basis on which detainees can assert a right to bargain with GEO for
an allowance of more than $1.00 per day, as if they were in a labor market.
The $1.00 per day allowance has withstood legal challenges for decades. In
Alvarado Guevara v. INS, 902 F.2d 394 (5th Cir. 1990), current and former detainees
brought an action against, inter alia, the INS and an INS processing center, challenging
the $1.00 per day allowance as a violation of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). The Fifth Circuit held that “[d]espite this apparent
exchange of money for labor,” the plaintiffs were not covered by the FLSA, because the
congressional motive for enacting the FLSA was to protect the “standard of living” and
“general well-being” of the worker in American industry. Id. at 396 (quotation marks
5

Congress has renewed Section 2(10) in subsequent fiscal years. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 98166, § 205(a), 97 Stat. 1071, 1086 (1983); Pub. L. No. 102-140, § 102(a), 105 Stat. 782, 791
(1991); Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 102, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-17 (1996); Pub. L. No. 107-77, § 102,
115 Stat. 750, 764 (2001) (providing that “Authorities contained in the Department of Justice
Appropriation Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1980 (Public Law 96-132; 93 Stat. 1040 (1979)),
as amended, shall remain in effect until the effective date of a subsequent Department of Justice
Appropriation Authorization Act”).

omitted). By contrast, alien detainees are “removed from American industry,” they are
“not within the group that Congress sought to protect in enacting the FLSA.” Id. at 396.
Thus, the allowance is “a valid exercise of the congressional power to regulate the
conduct of aliens.” Id. at 396–97. See also Guevara, 1992 WL 1029, at *2 (“Congress
was not unaware of the situation in which these detainees might find themselves, or of the
practice of the INS in asking for volunteers to undertake work projects at the detention
centers.”) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1555(d)). Recently, a Massachusetts court also rejected an
ICE detainees’ claim for more than $1 per day. See Whyte v. Suffolk Cnty. Sherriff’s
Dep’t, No. 15-00444-E (Sup. Ct. Mass. Jan. 8, 2016) (appeal filed, Feb. 4, 2016) (opinion
attached as GEO Ex. 5).6
The INS General Counsel has likewise concluded that “[a]lien detainees who
perform work for the INS . . . are not considered ‘employees’ for purposes of employer
sanctions.” INS General Counsel, The Applicability of Employer Sanctions to Alien
Detainees Performing Work in INS Detention Facilities, General Counsel Op. No. 92-8,

6

In Whyte, the ICE detainee, who was represented by at least one of the counsel for
Plaintiffs in this case, sued the Suffolk County Sherriff’s Department for violations of state wage
laws, breach of contract and unjust enrichment based on a claim that the County deprived him of
the fair value of his services by only paying him $1.00 per day. The trial court dismissed the
entire case for failure to state a claim, rejecting all of the minimum wage contentions, relying on
several of the same cases that GEO relies on here, such as Guevara v. INS, supra. See id. at 4-5.
The court found “no persuasive argument as to why this court should deviate from the sound
reasoning and guidance of this jurisprudence.” Id. at 5. The state wage laws “do not apply to
[plaintiff] as an ICE detainee in a Massachusetts correctional facility.” Id. at 6. The court also
rejected the detainee’s breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. Id.
12

1992 WL 1369347, at *1 (Feb. 26, 1992). Rather, “[a] detainee performs work for
institution maintenance, not compensation.” Id.7
Accordingly, the $1.00 per day allowance to detainees for performance of VWP
jobs, paid by GEO and reimbursed by ICE, is entirely lawful and approved by the federal
government.
C.

The Plaintiff Detainees’ Claims.

In light of this background, the Plaintiffs’ claims and their proposed classes are
simply unworkable. Plaintiffs propose a class of “[a]ll persons detained in [GEO’s]
Aurora Detention Facility in the ten years prior to the filing of this action,” Mot. at 10,
premised on the claim that the housekeeping chores allegedly performed by the 50,00060,000 detainees at the Aurora were all uniformly instances of “forced labor” performed
under threats of disciplinary segregation that violate the TVPA. The requirement that
detainees perform the housekeeping chores was and remains categorically lawful and
provides no basis for certifying a class (based on a strained interpretation of the TVPA)
to permit the Plaintiffs to sue for damages or restitution for performing those chores.
Even if the TVPA somehow applied in this context (and it does not), the proposed class
collapses under the impossible task of aggregating the tens of thousands of individualized

7

See also id. (concluding that “[w]ork performed by alien detainees is incident to their
detention,” and the allowance of $1.00 per day for detainee work under 8 U.S.C. § 1555(d) “does
not constitute an appointment of the detainee to the position of a federal employee”). In fact, the
INS General Counsel also opined that INS was authorized to use the labor of aliens at a federal
detention facility to perform projects at a neighboring Air Force facility, where INS would
“share in the benefit of the aliens’ labor.” See INS General Counsel, supra, 1992 WL 1369402,
at *2.
13

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 22 of 56

determinations that would need to be made about why and how detainees performed their
household chores.
Similarly, Plaintiffs propose a class of “[a]ll people who performed work [at]
[GEO’s] Aurora detention facility under [GEO’s] VWP policy in the three years prior to
the filing of this action,” Mot. at 19, on the theory that GEO was unjustly enriched by the
labor of all of the detainees who voluntarily worked in the VWP. But GEO administered
and supervised the VWP as directed by ICE and paid the only allowance ($1.00 per day)
ever authorized by Congress.8 No detainee ever had a reasonable expectation that his or
her VWP job would pay a negotiated wage. Classes are rarely, if ever, certified based on
unjust enrichment claims because, like this case, trying these claims would involve highly
individualized inquiries into the expectations and intentions of each individual Plaintiff
and proposed class member about whether and why work was performed, and whether
the work provided an “unjust” benefit to GEO that would support an equitable remedy.
ARGUMENT
“The class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by
and on behalf of the individual named parties only.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564
U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (quotation marks omitted). To ensure that class actions remain the
exception, and not the norm, “a party seeking to maintain a class action ‘must
affirmatively demonstrate his compliance’ with Rule 23.” Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,
8

Using Colorado unjust enrichment law to require GEO to pay more than the $1.00 per
day it was permitted to pay under its contract impermissibly interferes with the federal
government’s contracting prerogatives. Accordingly, GEO continues to assert the government
contractor defense. See GEO Mot. for Reconsideration (Dkt. 29) at 29–30.

133 S. Ct. 1426, 1432 (2013) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). The plaintiff bears
the burden of showing that the class complies with Rule 23, and district courts must
“conduct a ‘rigorous analysis’ before concluding that Rule 23’s requirements have been
satisfied.” Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust v. XTO Energy, Inc., 725 F.3d
1213, 1217 (10th Cir. 2013); see also Friedman v. Dollar Thrifty Automotive Grp., Inc.,
304 F.R.D. 601, 605 (D. Colo. 2015); Stender v. Archstone-Smith Operating Trust, No.
07-cv-02503, 2015 WL 5675304, at *4 (D. Colo. Sept. 28, 2015).
In conducting its rigorous analysis of class certification, the Court must address
Rule 23’s “requirements ‘through findings,’ regardless of whether these findings
necessarily ‘overlap with issues on the merits.’” Friedman, 304 F.R.D. at 606 (quoting
Vallario v. Vandehey, 554 F.3d 1259, 1267 (10th Cir. 2009)); see also Wal-Mart, 564
U.S. at 351 (noting that frequently the rigorous analysis under Rule 23 “will entail some
overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim” which “cannot be helped” as
the class determination “generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the
factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s cause of action”) (quotation marks
omitted).
A district court errs by “‘relaxing and shifting Rule 23(a)’s strict burden of proof’
to the party opposing certification, ‘liberally construing’ the class certification
requirements, or resolving doubts ‘in favor of certification.’” Friedman, 304 F.R.D at
605 (alterations omitted) (quoting XTO Energy, 725 F.3d at 1218). Thus, “[a]ctual, not
presumed, conformance” with Rule 23 remains “indispensable.” CGC Holdings Co.,

LLC v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076, 1086 (10th Cir. 2014) (alterations and quotation
marks omitted).
Plaintiffs request that the Court certify two classes under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and
(b)(3): (1) a class comprised of all detainees at GEO’s Aurora detention facility over the
past 10 years (the “TVPA class”); and (2) a class comprised of detainees who participated
in the VWP (the “Unjust Enrichment class”). See Mot. at 10, 19. As explained below,
neither of Plaintiffs’ proposed classes satisfy the threshold requirements of Rule 23(a),
and the Court should therefore deny class certification on that basis alone. Moreover,
even if the Court were to conclude that either or both of Plaintiffs’ proposed classes
satisfy Rule 23(a), neither class comes remotely close to satisfying the stringent
requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). Consequently, the Court must deny Plaintiffs’ request for
certification in its entirety.

I.

Plaintiffs’ Proposed Classes Do Not Satisfy Rule 23(a).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) imposes threshold requirements for class

certification. A class may be certified “only if”:
(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;
(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;
(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or
defenses of the class; and
(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
class.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). In order for class certification to be appropriate, the “‘party
seeking class action certification must [first] demonstrate, under a strict burden of proof,
that all of the requirements of [Rule] 23(a) are clearly met.’” Tabor v. Hilti, Inc., 703
16

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 25 of 56

F.3d 1206, 1228 (10th Cir. 2013) (quoting Rex v. Owens ex rel. State of Okla., 585 F.2d
432, 435 (10th Cir. 1978)). Thus, the party seeking class certification “must be prepared
to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or
fact, etc.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis added).
Plaintiffs do not satisfy Rule 23(a)’s threshold requirements of numerosity,
commonality, or typicality as to either proposed class. The Court must therefore deny
class certification.
A.

Numerosity.

Rule 23(a) requires that “the class [be] so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). The Tenth Circuit has held that this
requirement is “not a question of numbers” only.

Colo. Cross-Disability Coal. v.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co., 765 F.3d 1205, 1215 (10th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks
omitted).

Rather, the numerosity inquiry requires consideration of various factors,

including “[1] the nature of the action, [2] the size of the individual claims, and [3] the
location of the members of the class or the property that is the subject matter of the
dispute,” id. at 1215 (quotation marks omitted), as the means of assessing whether
“joinder of all members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).
As to both their proposed classes, Plaintiffs’ rely solely on an alleged
“presumption” that classes with greater than 40 putative members satisfy the
“numerosity” requirement. See Mot. at 10 (citing 1 William B. Rubenstein, et al.,
Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:12 (5th ed. 2011)); id. at 20 (same). This is insufficient.

17

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 26 of 56

Even if numerosity only depended on the number of putative class-members involved
(which it does not), the Supreme Court has been crystal clear that “actual, not presumed,
conformance with Rule 23(a) remains . . . indispensable.” Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,
457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (emphasis added). The Court therefore cannot conclude that
Plaintiffs have met their “strict burden of proof,” XTO Energy, 725 F.3d at 1218, by
reliance on this presumption.
Moreover, apart from each class’ estimated number, Plaintiffs have not put
forward any evidence regarding the other factors relevant to the numerosity inquiry. See
Colo. Cross, 765 F.3d at 1215; cf. Mot. at 10, 20. Thus, having failed to prove that
numerosity is “in fact” satisfied, Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis added), Plaintiffs
have not met their “strict burden of proof” under Rule 23. XTO Energy, 725 F.3d at
1218. The Court must deny certification for both classes on this basis alone. See id.
(“[I]t is not the defendant who bears the burden of showing that the proposed class does
not comply with Rule 23, but rather the plaintiff who bears the burden of showing that
the class does comply with Rule 23.”) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).9

9

Nor should the Court entertain any attempt by the Plaintiffs to offer new evidence for the
first time in their reply brief. United States v. Harrell, 642 F.3d 907, 918 (10th Cir. 2011)
(arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief generally are deemed waived); Alcohol
Monitoring Sys. Inc. v. Actsoft, Inc., 682 F. Supp. 2d 1237, 1242 (D. Colo. 2010) (noting that
“[t]he rationale underpinning this rule is tied to the fact that a responding party to a motion
ordinarily does not have an opportunity to respond to a reply”).
18

B.

Commonality.

Plaintiffs have not met their “strict burden [to] pro[ve],” Tabor, 703 F.3d at 1228,
that their putative TVPA and Unjust Enrichment classes satisfy the commonality
requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to
the class.” The “commonality” requirement is not satisfied where the putative class
members claim “that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law,” or
identify a factual commonality which “gives no cause to believe that their claims can
productively be litigated at once.” See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350. Rather, commonality
“requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have suffered the same
injury.” Id. (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted); see also Tabor, 703 F.3d at
1228 (same). In other words, “[t]heir claims must depend on a common contention”
which “must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means
that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity
of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis added).

1. TVPA Class.
Plaintiffs request that the Court certify the following class: “All persons detained
in [GEO’s] Aurora Detention Facility in the ten years prior to the filing of this action.”
See Mot. at 10.

None of the “commonalities” that Plaintiffs advance satisfy Rule

23(a)(2).

19

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 28 of 56

Plaintiffs start by identifying three putative common questions: (1) whether GEO
“obtains the labor of class members”; (2) whether GEO “threatens class members with
physical restraint, serious harm or abuse of the legal process’; and (3) whether GEO
“‘knowingly’ obtains class members’ labor ‘by . . . means of’ these threats.” Mot. at 11
(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(1)). These three “commonalities” are, however, simply
elements of § 1589. See 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a). So Plaintiffs’ argument on this point is, in
reality, that Rule 23(a)(2) is satisfied because all putative class-members would be
asserting that GEO violated the same provision of law.
The Supreme Court has, however, been crystal clear that merely alleging “that
[class-members] have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law,” is
insufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement. See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.
Just as Title VII plaintiffs cannot satisfy the commonality requirement by alleging “that
they have all suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury,” id.,
neither can Plaintiffs here satisfy the commonality requirement by alleging that all classmembers suffered a § 1589 injury.
Plaintiffs only other asserted basis for satisfying the commonality requirement is
the existence of the so-called “Forced Labor Policy,” which Plaintiffs argue “is the
common ‘glue’ that allows the Forced Labor Class’s claims to be resolved ‘in one
stroke.’” Mot. at 12 (quoting In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 768 F.3d 1245, 1253 (10th
Cir. 2014)). This, too, is wrong.

20

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 29 of 56

Plaintiffs appear to argue that the so-called “Forced Labor Policy” itself
constitutes a “threat” within the meaning of § 1589. But this question, however, is not
susceptible to producing “common answers.” See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (quotation
marks omitted).

Even assuming the TVPA would apply, to determine whether the

Aurora facility’s ICE-approved housekeeping requirements (and the attendant sanctions)
constitute a “threat” under § 1589 would require an individualized assessment into what,
if anything, each individual detainee perceived to be threatened in each instance that the
detainee performed housekeeping chores. For instance, the ICE Aurora Handbook for
detainees indicates that “[r]efusal to clean [an] assigned living area” is one of twenty-four
different “level-300” offenses. See ICE Aurora Handbook (GEO Ex. 1) at PL000054.
And this category of offenses is subject to thirteen different potential “sanctions,”
including a “[w]arning,” a “[r]eprimand,” “monetary restitution,” “[r]emov[al] from [a]
program and/or group activity,” and “[l]oss of privileges.” Id.
The Plaintiffs’ theory depends on the factually unsupported and implausible
assumption that each and every putative class detainee (assuming each detainee reviewed
his or her ICE Aurora Handbook) reached the conclusion that “[r]efusal to clean [their]
assigned living area,” id., will be penalized by “[d]isciplinary segregation” in an manner
that violates § 1589. Id. The evidence indicates that that was not the routine experience;
commonly, issues are resolved by detainees speaking with GEO officers who are making
their rounds at the facility without any segregation or other measures involved. See Ceja
Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 1), at 70:19-71:11. The determination of what, if anything, compelled
21

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 30 of 56

housekeeping to be performed in each instance would require precisely the individualized
inquiry that is not susceptible to “classwide resolution,” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.
Evidence that one detainee perceived the ICE Aurora Handbook as a “threat” of
disciplinary segregation would not “generat[e] [a] common answer[]” for all other
detainees. Id. (quotation marks omitted).10
The existence of multiple possible sanctions, coupled with the need for
individualized evidence of the purported injury that would violate § 1589, is fatal to
Plaintiffs’ ability to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement.

As noted,

Plaintiffs must show, “under a strict burden of proof,” Tabor, 703 F.3d at 1228, that “the
class members have suffered the same injury,” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis
added) (quotation marks omitted), and that the putative class “depend[s] upon a common
contention” that “will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the
claims in one stroke.” Id. For these reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to show, “under a
strict burden of proof,” that the requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is satisfied. See Tabor, 703
F.3d at 1228. The Court should therefore deny the motion to certify the TVPA class.

10

The likelihood that the ICE Aurora Handbook was not perceived, on a class-wide basis,
as a “threat” is evidenced by the fact that none of the declarants identified that handbook (or any
other written source) as the basis for their understanding that refusal to participate in the required
cleaning could result in disciplinary segregation; rather, the declarants indicate that they learned
of this by allegedly seeing other people put in “isolation” or “solitary confinement.” See
generally Pl. Decls. ¶ 3, supra at 7.
22

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 31 of 56

2. Unjust Enrichment Class.
Plaintiffs request that the Court certify the following class: “All people who
performed work [at] [GEO’s] Aurora detention facility under defendant’s VWP policy in
the three years prior to the filing of this action.” See Mot. at 19.
To make out an unjust enrichment claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the defendant
received a benefit, (2) at the plaintiff’s expense, (3) under circumstances that would make
it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without commensurate compensation.
Lewis v. Lewis, 189 P.3d 1134, 1141 (Colo. 2008); see also DCB Constr. Co., Inc. v.
Cent. City Devel. Co., 965 P.2d 115, 120–21 (Colo. 1998) (same). The third element—
i.e., whether retention of the benefit under certain “circumstances” would be unjust—“is
a fact-intensive inquiry in which courts look to, among other things, the intentions,
expectations, and behavior of the parties.” Melat, Pressman & Higbie, L.L.P. v. Hannon
Law Firm, L.L.C., 287 P.3d 842, 847 (Colo. 2012). Under Colorado law, courts must
“make extensive factual findings” and give “careful consideration of particular
circumstances” to determine “whether a party has been unjustly enriched.” Lewis, 189
P.3d at 1140; see also DCB Constr., 965 P.2d at 120 (“The notion of what is or is not
‘unjust’ is an inherently malleable and unpredictable standard.”).
Plaintiffs assert that a first “common issue” is whether “GEO misrepresents to
Plaintiffs . . . that ICE sets VWP payment at exactly $1 a day.” See Mot. at 21 (emphasis

23

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 32 of 56

added).

This does not come remotely close to satisfying Rule 23(a)(2).11

Some

individual detainees who inquired as to additional pay could have concluded that GEO,
in response, stated that ICE sets pay at $1.00 per day. See Furst Dep. (Pl.’s Ex. 14), at
39:2–40:10; see also Detainee Grievance Forms (Pl.’s Ex. 16). But even assuming that
this statement would somehow be a misrepresentation to the detainees who received such
an answer (which GEO denies), there is no evidence as to how many participants in the
VWP inquired about additional pay or how many of those who inquired were told that
ICE dictates $1.00 per day pay. Moreover, Handbooks given to the detainees upon
admittance and VWP applications represent that pay will be $1.00 per day. See ICE
Nat’l Detainee Handbook (GEO Ex. 3), at PL000092 (“you will be paid $1.00 per day
worked”); VWP Application (GEO Ex. 6), at PL000058 (“Work detail members will
receive $1.00 per work day. The maximum paid out will be $1.00 per day.”). But neither
of these statements of the daily $1.00 allowance constitutes evidence that GEO made a
classwide representation that ICE dictates a $1.00 per day.
Thus, even indulging Plaintiffs’ misrepresentation theory, proving that GEO
unjustly derived a benefit in any particular circumstance based on an alleged
“misrepresentation” that ICE dictates the $1.00 per day allowance would require
11

The Plaintiffs’ “misrepresentation” theory should also be rejected because it was not
pled. See Compl. ¶¶ 86–107. Nowhere in the Plaintiffs’ complaint do they allege that unjust
enrichment arises from a misrepresentation about what ICE tells GEO with respect to the
permissible allowances under the VWP. Alternatively, Plaintiffs’ assertion of this new theory
should be considered a request to amend the complaint, see Viernow v. Euripides Devel. Corp.,
157 F.3d 785, 790 n.9 (10th Cir. 1998), which, if granted, should provide GEO a full opportunity
to move to dismiss the amended complaint.
24

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 33 of 56

individualized proof about what a detainee read and heard in the circumstances.

For

example, proving that one VWP detainee inquired into additional pay and was told that
ICE dictates $1.00 per day pay would have no bearing on whether other participants in
the VWP likewise inquired and received the same answer. Nor have Plaintiffs’ provided
any basis for how to assess whether this purported misrepresentation led to an unjust
benefit retained by GEO and any particular instance. This is no issue that can be settled
“in one stroke,” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350, and there is no reason to believe putative
class members’ claims could “productively be litigated at once.” Id.
Plaintiffs’ remaining alleged “common issue” appears to be that the $1.00 per day
pay is “substantially discounted” from market rates. See Mot. at 20; id. at 21 (stating that
GEO would “otherwise turn to an open market that would supply similar labor at
substantially higher costs”). But whether an amount paid is “substantially discounted”
depends on what it is being compared to. Plaintiffs argument presupposes that the VWP
detainees are participants in the same market as other persons who could become
employed by ICE to perform the same work. See Bock v. Am. Growth Fund Sponsors,
Inc., 904 P.2d 1381, 1387 (Colo. App. 1995) (holding in unjust enrichment context that
“the measure [of damages is] the difference between the consideration paid and the fair
market value of the employee’s services”) (emphasis added). This is a false comparison.
As this Court recognized in dismissing Plaintiffs Colorado minimum wage claim,
Plaintiffs are not “employees” covered by that law, see Dkt. 23 at 3, and neither are they
covered by the FLSA.

See Alvarado, 902 F.2d at 396–97 (holding that detainee25

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 34 of 56

immigrants were not covered by the minimum wage provision of the Fair Labor
Standards Act because the detainees—like the detainees here—are “removed from the
American industry”).
Thus, Plaintiffs allegation of “substantial” difference is premised on a comparison
that is not legally relevant to an unjust enrichment claim under Colorado law. Whether
$1.00 per day in the VWP is “substantially” less than what an employee would get paid
for such work outside of the VWP is therefore not an “issue central to” the unjust
enrichment claim, and, moreover, resolving that question would not “generate . . .
answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”

Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350

(quotation marks omitted). And Plaintiffs have utterly failed to put forward evidence—as
is their burden—to support a claim that the $1.00 per day pay received by VPW
participates is “substantially” less than others who are similarly situated. See XTO
Energy, 725 F.3d at 1218 (“[I]t is not the defendant who bears the burden of showing that
the proposed class does not comply with Rule 23, but rather the plaintiff who bears the
burden of showing that the class does comply with Rule 23.”) (quotation marks and
alterations omitted).
At bottom, Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment argument appears to be premised on the
idea that “GEO relies on [a] necessarily captive workforce for $1-a-day labor, when it
would otherwise turn to an open market that would supply similar labor at substantially
higher costs.” Mot. at 21. But this yields no common issue; only unanswered questions.
Plaintiffs provide no example of a successful claim for unjust enrichment based on such a
26

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 35 of 56

theory (much less, a class). For example, Plaintiffs do not place in evidence any proof
that GEO or any other federal detention facility operator has operated a facility based on
labor from an “open market;” therefore any “benefit” GEO has received is pure
speculation. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 243–44 (3d Cir. 1999) (pretrial
detainee not entitled to minimum wage because standard of living is guaranteed and work
“bears no indicia of traditional free-market employment”); Villarreal v. Woodham, 113
F.3d 202, 206–07 (11th Cir. 1997) (same); Alvarado, 902 F.2d at 396 (immigrant
detainees “not within the group” protected by labor laws). For reasons already described,
no detainee would have ever had a reasonable expectation that he or she would be paid
more than $1.00 per day at the Aurora facility, and if some hypothetical detainee ever
did, whether GEO “unjustly” derived any benefit from that detainee would necessarily be
an individualized inquiry completely inappropriate for classwide resolution.
C.

Typicality.

Rule 23(a) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are
typical of the claims or defenses of the class[.]”

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).12

Plaintiffs’ proposed classes fail to satisfy this requirement.
“Typicality exists where the claims of the representative plaintiff ‘arise out of the
same course of conduct and are based on the same theories as those of the absent class
12

See Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1275 (11th Cir. 2009) (noting that
“[a]lthough typicality and commonality may be related,” they are distinct because “traditionally,
commonality refers to the group characteristics of the class as a whole, while typicality refers to
the individual characteristics of the named plaintiff in relation to the class.”) (quotation marks
and alterations omitted).
27

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 36 of 56

members . . . .’” See Ellis v. Spectranetics Corp., No. 15-cv-01857, 2015 WL 9259928,
at *2 (D. Colo. Dec. 18, 2015) (quoting Schwartz v. Celestial Seasonings, Inc., 178
F.R.D. 545, 552 (D. Colo. 1998)). Thus, for a plaintiffs’ claim to be typical, it must
“challenge[] the same conduct that would be challenged by the class,” Pliego v. Los
Arcos Mexican Restaurants, Inc., 313 F.R.D. 117, 126 (D. Colo. 2016) (quotation marks
omitted), such that there is a “sufficient nexus [] between the claims of the named
representatives and those of the class at large.” Vega, 564 F.3d at 1275 (quotation marks
omitted).13
There is no evidence that the Plaintiffs are “typical” of the class for purposes of
the TVPA claim.

Although the Plaintiff and non-plaintiff declarants make similar

statements that failure to perform housekeeping work would result in being put in “the
hole” or “solitary confinement,” and some state that they knew of other detainees being
sent there for a refusal to work, none of the declarants were placed in segregation
themselves for refusing to clean. To the extent the Plaintiffs claim to have perceived a
“threat” of being placed in segregation, this perception of a threat is subjective, and could
turn on allegations of entirely different conduct. Additionally, the proposed TVPA claim
spans 10 years prior to the filing of the action, yet the declarants stay at Aurora only
spans back to May 2011. See Dkt. 49-6 (Valerga Decl). Therefore there is no proof that
the experience of any of the Plaintiffs would be typical of detainees at Aurora prior to
May 2011.
13

This requires that “the claims of the class representative and class members are based on
the same legal or remedial theory.” Colo. Cross, 765 F.3d at 1216 (quotation marks omitted).
28

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 37 of 56

Plaintiffs have also failed to “affirmatively demonstrate” that their proposed
Unjust Enrichment class satisfies the typicality requirement. See Comcast Corp., 133 S.
Ct. at 1432.

Plaintiffs assert—in their arguments supporting “commonality” and

“typicality”—that one of the two pillars of their unjust enrichment claim is “that GEO
misrepresents to Plaintiffs . . . that ICE sets VWP payment at exactly $1 a day[.]” See
Mot. at 21; see id. at 22 (asserting that Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claims are typical
because “[t]hey claim here that GEO misled them about whether they could ever be paid
more than $1 a day”). As already explained, Plaintiffs’ alleged “misrepresentation” does
not qualify as a common question for Rule 23(a)(2) purposes because Plaintiffs have
offered no evidence that GEO has made the alleged “misrepresentation” to detainees on a
classwide basis; rather, the only evidence offered shows that such a representation has
been made to individual VWP participants who specifically inquired. See supra at 23–
24.
But even if every other member of the putative class had made such an inquiry, the
Plaintiffs own evidence shows that they do not all share this feature. Five of the nine
named-Plaintiffs submitted declarations.14 While these Plaintiffs’ state that they were
paid $1.00 per day, only one of those five, along with another Plaintiff who did not
submit a declaration, has submitted any evidence that he inquired as to whether he could
receive higher pay, or that any GEO party represented to them that ICE dictates $1.00 per

14

See Dkt. 49-2 (Menocal Decl.); Dkt. 49-3 (Xahuentitla-Flores Decl.); Dkt. 49-4 (Argueta
Decl.); Dkt. 49-5 (Gaytan Decl.); Dkt. 49-6 (Valerga Decl.).
29

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 38 of 56

day. See Pl. Decls. supra at n.14; Detainee Grievance Forms (Pl.’s Ex. 16). Nor did
Plaintiffs include such an allegation in the Complaint. See Compl. ¶¶ 86–107 (unjust
enrichment allegations). By contrast, two of the putative class-members’ declarations do
state that they inquired into receiving higher pay, and were told that GEO could not pay
more. See Dkt. 49-9 (Castellanos Decl.) ¶ 4 (“I was told that GEO could only pay $1 per
day.”); Dkt. 49-8 (Torres Decl.) ¶ 4 (“One guard . . . told me that GEO could only pay
one dollar per day, no more.”). But the third non-Plaintiff declarant does not allege that
he inquired regarding the $1.00 per day pay. See Dkt. 49-7 (Muñoz Decl.). Thus, the
evidence demonstrates that not all Plaintiffs share with the putative class-members one of
the essential “features” on which the unjust enrichment claim “rests,” cf. Mot. at 21, and
not all putative class-members share that feature either.

Plaintiffs would not be

“challenge[ing] the same conduct that would be challenged by the class,” Pliego, 313
F.R.D. at 126, and therefore there is not a “sufficient nexus [] between the claims of the
named representatives and those of the class at large.” Vega, 564 F.3d at 1275.

II.

Plaintiffs’ Proposed Classes Do Not Satisfy Rule 23(b)(3).
If a court determines that Rule 23(a)’s “threshold requirements” are satisfied, “it

must then examine whether the action falls within one of three categories of suits set
forth in Rule 23(b).” Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 F.3d 963, 971 (10th Cir. 2004)

30

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 39 of 56

(quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs allege that its proposed classes may be certified
under Rule 23(b)(3).15 See Mot. at 13–19, 22–24.
Rule 23(b)(3) provides that a court may certify a class if “the court finds that the
questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions
affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available
methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.” As the Supreme Court
has noted, Rule 23(b)(3) is “an ‘adventuresome innovation,’” that is “designed for
situations ‘in which class-action treatment is not as clearly called for.’” Comcast Corp.,
133 S. Ct. at 1432 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 362). As with Rule 23(a), Rule
23(b)(3) “demands a rigorous analysis” by the district court to ensure that its
requirements are satisfied. See XTO Energy, 725 F.3d at 1219 (quotation marks omitted).
In particular, both the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit have repeatedly recognized
that “Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance criterion is ‘far more demanding’ than Rule 23(a)’s
commonality requirement.” Id. at 1220 (emphasis added) (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc.
v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623–24 (1997)); see also Friedman, 304 F.R.D. at 615 (same).
Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance inquiry “‘tests whether proposed classes are
sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.’” CGC Holding, 773
F.3d at 1087 (quoting Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 623). While “predominance” does not
15

Plaintiffs argue that “‘in a doubtful case, . . . any error . . . should be committed in favor
of allowing the class action.’” See Mot. at 14 (quoting Esplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 101 (10th
Cir. 1968)). This misstates current Tenth Circuit law. In XTO Energy, the Tenth Circuit
reversed a district court’s certification order that relied on precisely this principle, concluding
that applying such an “err-on-the-side-of-certification” principle was an abuse of discretion. See
725 F.3d at 1217–18, 1221.
31

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 40 of 56

require absolute uniformity, Rule 23(b)(3) does require that “common, aggregationenabling, issues in the case are more prevalent or important than the non-common,
aggregation-defeating, individual issues.” CGC Holding, 773 F.3d at 1087 (emphasis
added) (quotation marks omitted). “Considering whether questions of law or fact
common to class members predominate begins, of course, with the elements of the
underlying cause of action.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. 804,
809 (2011).
Neither of Plaintiffs proposed classes satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirements. As
such, this Court must deny certification.
A.

Predominance.

1. TVPA Class.
Plaintiffs’ TVPA class falls woefully short of satisfying Rule 23(b)(3)’s “far more
demanding” standard. See XTO Energy, 725 F.3d at 1220 (quotation marks omitted).
Section 1589’s language, which centers around an individual “person” being
forced to labor,16 evinces that the “non-common, aggregation-defeating, individual

16

Section 1589(a) provides:

(a) Whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of, or by
any combination of, the following means—
(1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of physical restraint
to that person or another person;
(2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person;
(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; or
(4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe
that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person
would suffer serious harm or physical restraint,
shall be punished as provided under subsection (d).
32

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 41 of 56

issues” are “more prevalent [and] important” than common issues. See CGC Holding,
773 F.3d at 1087. First, § 1589’s text is clear that it only proscribes the listed conduct—
e.g., “threats of physical restraint” or “threats of serious harm”—when “the labor or
services of a person” are obtained “by means of” that conduct. See § 1589(a)(1)–(4)
(emphasis added). This language requires that the defendant’s alleged conduct have
caused the plaintiff to perform “labor or services.” See § 1589(a); see, e.g., Headley v.
Church of Scientology Int’l, 687 F.3d 1173, 1179–80 (9th Cir. 2012). And as courts have
also recognized, proving that a defendant’s alleged conduct caused a plaintiff to perform
labor or services is a highly individualized inquiry, which requires individualized proof.
See David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, No. 08-cv-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at *16–22 (E.D. La.
Jan. 4, 2012).
Proving the required causal connection in this case will require a highlyindividualized inquiry into the reasons for why each of the putative class members
performed the cleaning duties required of Aurora detainees. Demonstrating that one
detainee’s labor was obtained “by means of” conduct proscribed in § 1589 does not
resolve whether any other detainee’s performance of labor or services—much less all
50,000 or 60,000 putative class-members—was likewise caused by such conduct.17 This
necessity of individualized assessment is particularly acute with respect to whether

17

Even if 99 percent of the putative TVPA class-members did perform their mandatory
cleaning duties because of the possible sanctions (and no evidence indicates that is true), the
remaining one percent would still represent over 500 putative class members whose claims could
not be adjudicated on a class-wide basis.
33

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 42 of 56

putative class members performed their requiring housekeeping duties without having
experienced any of the available sanctions for not doing so.18 To prove that the “threat”
of disciplinary segregation, or any of the other available sanctions19 were the “means” by
which a detainee’s labor or service was obtained, would require some proof that the
threatened, but not imposed, sanction was the reason he or she performed the labor in
every instance. Indeed, even under Plaintiffs’ theory, there would be no reason to award
damages or restitution to a detainee who performed chores because, for example, he or
she wished to stay busy; but the reasons each detainee performed the chores cannot be
ascertained without individual inquiry.
The individualized nature of § 1589’s causal requirement precludes classcertification here. Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge that their TVPA claims
“turn on” whether GEO “obtained Plaintiffs’ labor ‘by . . . means of’ the threat of solitary
confinement.” Mot. at 15. Because this central issue necessitates individualized proof,
the individualized issues in the case are “more prevalent [and] important” than any
alleged common issues. See CGC Holding, 773 F.3d at 1087.20

18

Plaintiffs’ proposed class is not limited to detainees who were sanctioned for not
performing their required housekeeping duties. See Mot. at 10 (defining class). Quite the
contrary, none of the Plaintiffs declare that they were cited for any offense for refusing to
perform the chores.

19

This is assuming solely for the sake of argument that any sanction that could be imposed
for a level-300 offense would fall within a category of conduct proscribed by § 1589.
20

Plaintiffs again assert that the elements of a § 1589 claim constitute common questions
under Rule 23(a)(2). As indicated above, this is incorrect. See supra at 19–20. Because those
“questions” do not qualify as common questions of law or fact under Rule 23(a)(2), they cannot
aid Plaintiffs in the context of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement.
34

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 43 of 56

Plaintiffs argue, however, that § 1589’s causal requirement is purely objective—
“turn[ing] on whether a reasonable person would provide labor . . . if placed in the
position of the person providing such labor,” Mot. at 15—such that no individualized
determination of causation would be needed. See Mot. at 15–17 (relying on Tanedo v. E.
Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., No. 10-cv-01172, 2011 WL 7095434 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 12,
2011)).21 In particular, Plaintiffs argue that a purely objective focus is “evident in the
fact that the statute focuses on the [defendant’s] scienter, not the plaintiff’s state of
mind,” and because § 1589’s definition of “serious harm” refers to “reasonable person.”
See Mot. at 15–16. Neither argument is correct.
First, Plaintiffs cite no authority for the strange proposition that the presence of a
mens rea (addressing the defendant’s state of mind) has any bearing on whether the
defendant’s actions produced a certain result. And there is no reason why it would.22

Id. at 16 (“Applied to the facts of this case, that standard would require asking a
factfinder whether GEO implemented the Forced Labor Policy to obtain labor from detainees,
knowing or intending that a reasonably person in the detainees’ position would feel compelled to
provide that labor. That question would be answered based on a consideration of the uniformly
applicable Forced Labor Policy and the factfinder’s analysis of how a reasonable person would
respond to that policy.”).
21

22

Plaintiffs quote United States v. Dann, 652 F.3d 1160, 1169–70 (9th Cir. 2011) to support
this argument. See Mot. at 15–16. This case does not, however, adopt an objective standard to
causation. Rather, the passage quoted is interpreting the term “serious harm.” See 652 F.3d at
1169–70. In its discussion, the Court notes that, in order for “harm” to be sufficiently “serious,”
it must be the type of harm that would cause a “reasonable person” to perform labor or services.
Id. at 1170. But that rule does not remove the separate requirement that the “serious harm” in
fact cause the particular plaintiff person to perform the labor or service. See id. at 1169–70.
Indeed, if § 1589(c)(2)’s reference to a “reasonable person” were sufficient to create a purely
objective standard for causation, it could do so only with respect to some of the subparts in
§ 1589(a), since only some subparts reference “serious harm.” Cf., § 1589(a)(1) (not referencing
“serious harm). This interpretation would create a convoluted statute with differing causation
35

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 44 of 56

Section 1589 requires that the “labor or services” at issue be obtained “by means of” the
conduct specified. § 1589(a)(1)–(4). That inquiry necessarily turns on what, in fact,
motivated the plaintiff to perform the labor or service, not on what the defendant knew.
Likewise, Plaintiffs’ reliance on § 1589’s definition of “serious harm” is also
misplaced.

See Mot. at 16 & n.6.

Section 1589 provides that “serious harm” is

determined by looking to whether a “reasonable person of the same background and in
the same circumstances” would be “compel[led]” to perform the labor or services. See
§ 1589(c)(2). But as other courts have held, this reference to a “reasonable person” does
not create a purely objective causation standard: “[T]he injection of the objective
reasonable person standard into the forced labor equation does not serve to eliminate the
subjective aspects of the crime”; rather, “the jury must still determine whether the victim
was coerced subjectively to provide labor based on the defendant’s threats.” David, 2012
WL 10759668, at *20. In other words, while “the victim’s response to the defendant’s
actions must pass the reasonable person test,” id. “[t]he plaintiff must prove . . . that
compulsion at the hands of the defendant caused the plaintiff to render his services
involuntarily,” id., and “one cannot determine whether the defendant’s actions [caused]
the victim to provide labor without looking to the specific victim involved.” Id. at *19
(emphasis added). In fact, the plaintiff’s burden to show a subjective coercion is “the
very essence of the crime of forced labor[.]” Id. at *20; see also United States v. Rivera,

standards depending on which form of proscribed conduct was alleged, without any textual basis
for doing so.
36

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 45 of 56

799 F.3d 180, 186–87 (2d Cir. 2015); Panwar v. Access Therapies, Inc., No. 1:12-cv00619, 2015 WL 329013, at *6 (S.D. Ind. Jan. 22, 2015) (holding in the Rule 23(a)(3)
context that “it would not be appropriate to apply a ‘reasonable person’ standard to
determine whether the Defendants’ varying actions constituted a threat of harm for each
proposed class member”).
Plaintiffs argue, alternatively, that even if a subjective standard of causation
applies, “it makes little sense to require . . . individual showings of coercion when GEO
requires” detainees to perform cleaning duties. See Mot. at 17. Their sole basis for this
claim comes from dicta in David, supra, which speculated—after having determined not
to certify the TVPA class at issue there—that “based on the type of coercion used, there
may be cases where consent becomes irrelevant.” 2012 WL 10759668, at *21. This
argument rests on the absurd insinuation that the sanctions available for not performing
cleaning duties are remotely comparable to the horrific abuse slaves suffer by “use of the
master’s whip.” See Mot. at 17 (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs—as well as every
other putative class member—are (or were) lawfully detained under the authority of the
United States government, and each of the sanctions for a 300-level offense (including
disciplinary segregation) is expressly authorized by ICE. See PBNDS (GEO Ex. 2), at
App’x 3.1.A, § III (listing offenses and sanctions identical to those in ICE Aurora
Handbook).23

23

In similar fashion, Plaintiffs argue that “[i]t is enough to conclude . . . that the evidence
supports an inference that class members did not voluntarily consent” to performing their
cleaning duties. See Mot. at 17–18 (emphasis added). But Plaintiffs do not cite any authority
37

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 46 of 56

In the end, Plaintiffs’ belief that it “makes no sense” to require each putative classmember prove causation is irrelevant since the text of § 1589 mandates that a plaintiff do
so. See § 1589(a) (prohibiting obtaining “the labor or services of a person” by specified
means) (emphasis added). Indeed, plaintiffs in § 1589 cases that (unlike here) actually
involved slave-like treatment still proved, on an individualized basis, that their labor was
obtained “by means of” proscribed conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Callahan, 801
F.3d 606, 613, 615, 620–21 (6th Cir. 2015) (relying on individualized evidence of
coercion to affirm § 1589 conviction where victims were forced to perform labor by,
inter alia, “threaten[ing] or assault[ing]” her, “depriv[ing] [her] of food,” “shoving [one
victim’s] face in dog excrement,” “locking [a victim] in the basement,” and “ordered [one
victim] to beat [another victim]”); accord United States v. Kaufman, 546 F.3d 1242,
1246, 1263–64 (10th Cir. 2008) (considering sufficiency-of-evidence challenge to § 1584
conviction and crediting testimony by victim that he did not perform the work
voluntarily).
Moreover, in addition to the individualized causation issue just discussed,
Plaintiffs seek class-wide compensatory and punitive damages, as well as restitution for
the alleged § 1589 violation. See Compl. ¶¶ 83–84; §§ 1595(a), 1593. Plaintiffs make no
effort to contend that the TVPA damages they seek present a question that can be
resolved on a class-wide basis, Mot. at 10–13; nor do they address damages in the context
that such an inference is permissible in the § 1589 context, but rather seek to import a rationale
applied in the RICO context to § 1589 claims. See Mot. at 18 (citing CHC Holding, 773 F.3d at
1073 (RICO case), In re U.S. Foodservice Inc. Pricing Litig., 729 F.3d 108, 120 (2d Cir. 2013)
(RICO case), and Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241 (11th Cir. 2004) (RICO case)).
38

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 47 of 56

of their Rule 23(b)(3) argument. See Mot. at 14–18. While individualized damages do
not automatically preclude class certification, “predominance may be destroyed if
individualized issues will overwhelm those questions common to the class[.]” XTO
Energy, 725 F.3d at 1220; see also id. (“‘To be sure, individualized damage
determinations cut against class certification under Rule 23(b)(3).’”) (quoting Ward v.
Dixie Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 595 F.3d 164, 180 (4th Cir. 2010)).
Establishing damages for a § 1589 violation would necessarily be an intensely
individualized determination, one dependent on which of the numerous possible
proscribed “means” in § 1589(a) was implicated by the facts of each putative classmember’s case.

Indeed, even if a jury were to conclude that the requirement that

detainees perform housekeeping chores (and the attendant sanctions) constituted a
“threat” proscribed by § 1589, any damages assessment would necessarily need to inquire
into whether any of the other means of § 1589(a) were violated, e.g., whether “force”
was used, whether “physical restraint” was involved,
financial, or reputational harm” occurred.

or whether “psychological,

See § 1589(a)(1), (2); § 1589(c)(2).24

Calculating damages for any detainee who was subject to “force,” “physical restraint,”
etc. would require proof of these occurrences, but none of these issues are susceptible to
class-wide determination. And further individualized assessment would be required for
those putative class-members who attempt to prove their entitlement to punitive damages.
See Compl. ¶ 83. Thus, many of the 50,000 to 60,000 putative class-members’ damages
24

In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege violations of, and seek damages for conduct
proscribed in § 1589(a)(1), (2), and (4). See Compl. ¶¶ 76–78.
39

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 48 of 56

inquiries would devolve into mini-trials on what additional portions of § 1589 may have
been violated vis-à-vis a particular detainee, and whether that detainee was entitled to
punitive damages. Plaintiffs, however, have indicated no means by which these damages
could be uniformly calculated—because none exists.
In short, the highly-individualized questions inherent in § 1589’s causal
requirement, and in a damages assessment, “are more prevalent [and] important,” CGC
Holding, 773 F.3d at 1087, than any common issue that might exist. The Court should
therefore deny certification of Plaintiffs’ proposed TVPA class.

2. Unjust Enrichment Class.
To make out an unjust enrichment claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the defendant
received a benefit, (2) at the plaintiff’s expense, (3) under circumstances that would make
it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without commensurate compensation.
Lewis, 189 P.3d at 1141. Because of the “fact-intensive” nature of unjust enrichment
claims, Melat, 287 P.3d at 847, “‘courts generally find that unjust enrichment claims are
not appropriately certified for class treatment, as common questions will rarely, if ever,
predominate.’” Friedman, 304 F.R.D. at 611 (quoting In re Mots. to Certify Classes
Against Court Reporting Firms, 715 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1284 (S.D. Fla. 2010) aff’d 439 F.
App’x 849 (11th Cir. 2011)).
Plaintiffs argue that Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement is “easily”
satisfied here, but their argument for this conclusion is nonsensical. Plaintiffs argue that
“the question posed by Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claims is not whether any particular
40

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 49 of 56

individual unjustly enriched GEO . . . .”

Mot. at 23 (emphasis added).

But if no

“particular individual unjustly enriched GEO” then no Plaintiff or putative class-member
has a claim against GEO. Thus, the “question posed” by Plaintiffs unjust enrichment
claims is precisely whether GEO was unjustly enriched by individual Plaintiffs.
The individualized nature of an unjust enrichment claim cannot be salvaged by
Plaintiffs’ argument that the “unjust enrichment claims call for a classwide adjudication
of the “intentions, expectations, and behavior of the parties related to the entire VWP
Policy.” Mot. at 23 (quoting Hannon Law Firm, LLC v. Melat, Pressman & Higbie, LLP,
293 P.3d 55, 59 (Colo. App. 2011)).

Plaintiffs act like it is self-evident that the

“intentions, expectations, and behavior of the parties” is a common question that can
predominate over individualized issue.25 This is wrong. As the Supreme Court held, a
common question under Rule 23(a)(2) is one whose “determination . . . will resolve an
issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart,
564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis added). “Expectations” and “intentions” are, however, highly
individualized, and determining the “expectations” or “intentions” of one VWP
participant would provide no insights into the “expectations” or “intentions” of another
VWP participant.
Thus, far from supporting Plaintiffs Rule 23(b)(3) predominance argument, the
highly-individualized nature of discerning “expectations” and “intentions” demonstrates

25

Plaintiffs did not argue in their Rule 23(a)(2) section that the “intentions, expectations,
and behavior of the parties related to the entire VWP Policy” was a “common question.” See
Mot. at 20–21.
41

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 50 of 56

why, in this case, “non-common, aggregation defeating, individual issues,” are “more
prevalent [and] important” that common issues. See CGC Holding, 773 F.3d at 1087.
Indeed, it is precisely because an assessment of parties’ intentions and expectations is
such a “fact-intensive” inquiry, Melat, 287 P.3d at 847, that “courts generally find that
unjust enrichment claims are not appropriately certified for class treatment, as common
questions will rarely, if ever, predominate.” Friedman, 304 F.R.D. at 611 (emphasis
added) (quotation marks omitted).
The individualized nature of the damages sought further demonstrates that Rule
23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement is not satisfied. Cf. Mot. at 23–24. Plaintiffs
acknowledge that “individual questions may arise with respect to damages,” Mot. at 23,
but argue that the possibility of individualized-damages awards does not automatically
preclude certification. Id. (citing cases). As the Tenth Circuit has recognized, however,
“individualized damage determinations cut against class certification under Rule
23(b)(3),” and “predominance may be destroyed if individualized issues will overwhelm
those questions common to the class[.]” XTO Energy, 725 F.3d at 1220 (quotation marks
omitted). Individualized issues predominate here.
Plaintiffs’ themselves identify two issues that would require individualized
assessment with respect to damages: (1) VWP participants worked a different number of
hours; and (2) VWP participants did not all perform the same work. See Mot. at 23.
Beyond these, other factors that could hypothetically be relevant to the damages inquiry
would require individualized assessment. For example, as discussed above, Plaintiffs
42

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 51 of 56

argue that GEO made misrepresentations to detainees regarding the $1.00 per day pay.
See Mot. at 21; supra at 23–24, 28–30. But because Plaintiffs have not identified any
general source of the alleged misrepresentation, individualized proof would be required
to show to whom GEO made the allegedly false representation. See supra at 23–24, 28–
30.
In short, any class-wide damages assessment would necessarily involve highlyindividualized assessments. Combined with the individualized inquiries necessary to
demonstrate the “expectations” and “intentions” of each putative class-member, these
individualized issues overwhelmingly predominate any potential common issues.
Plaintiffs argue further that the Court could side-step these individualized concerns
by “use of a formula and statistical sampling . . . [so] the factfinder could determine
unjust enrichment damages without individualized hearings.” See Mot. at 24.26 But it is
Plaintiffs burden to “present[] ‘a common formula to the class’ that ‘approximate[s]
damages,’ ” if it wishes to avoid a case-by-case damages assessment. See Stender, 2015
WL 5675304, at *11 (emphasis added) (quoting Newberg, § 12.5 and Urethane Antitrust
Litig., 768 F.3d at 1257. Plaintiffs have plainly not met this burden as they have not
presented any means or method of calculating damages that would not require
“individualized hearings.” Mot. at 24. Both this Court and the Supreme Court have
26

It is unclear whether Plaintiffs are here referring to “aggregate damages” (i.e., class-wide
damages) or a common method of calculating individualized damages. See 4 William B.
Rubenstein, et al., Newberg on Class Actions, § 12.1, at 91–92 (5th ed. 2014) (hereafter
“Newberg”) (differentiating between “aggregate damages” and a common-means for calculating
“individualized” damages).
43

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 52 of 56

found insufficient asserted class-wide methods for calculating damages.

See, e.g.,

Comcast Corp., 133 S. Ct. at 1432–35; Stender, 2015 WL 5675304, at *11. Plaintiffs
opaque reference to “a formula and statistical sampling,” Mot. at

24—without

identifying any such formula or statistics—is a fortiori insufficient. See, e.g., Seabron v.
Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., No. 11-cv-01096, 2013 WL 3713652, at *9 (D. Colo. July 16,
2013) (“Plaintiffs have failed to set forth any model for calculating damages on a classwide basis.

Such failure is further reason for this Court to deny Plaintiffs’ class

certification motion.”).
Lastly, Plaintiffs suggest that the Court could “bifurcate damages determinations
for the [Unjust Enrichment] class.” See Mot. at 23–24. This would not, however, cure
the significant predominance issues vis-à-vis the non-damages elements of an unjust
enrichment claim. As courts have recognized, and as noted above, the necessity of
inquiring into whether a benefit was “unjustly” retained is “inherently malleable and
unpredictable,” DCB Constr., 965 P.2d at 120, and requires a “fact-intensive inquiry”
into, inter alia, “the intentions, expectations, and behavior of the parties.” Melat, 287
P.3d at 847; see also Lewis, 189 P.3d at 1140 (court must “make extensive factual
findings” and give “careful consideration of particular circumstances” to determine
“whether a party has been unjustly enriched”). This inquiry, separate from determining
damages, could not be done without a detainee-by-detainee assessment. See supra at 40–
41.

44

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 53 of 56

B.

Superiority.

Rule 23(b)(3) also requires that Plaintiffs prove that “a class action is superior to
other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 23(b)(3). This inquiry should take account of “(A) the class members’ interests in
individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and
nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class
members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the
claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.”
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).
Plaintiffs have also failed to satisfy their burden under this requirement as to either
proposed class because Plaintiff has not presented evidence to support the points it
alleges show that a class action is “superior” in this context. See XTO Energy, 725 F.3d
at 1218 (“[I]t is not the defendant who bears the burden of showing that the proposed
class does not comply with Rule 23, but rather the plaintiff who bears the burden of
showing that the class does comply with Rule 23.”) (quotation marks and alterations
omitted).
As to the TVPA class, Plaintiffs opine on what is “likely” to be the case, but do
not present evidence to support these claims. See Mot. at 19. And as to the Unjust
Enrichment class, Plaintiffs only state that “largely the same reasons” support a finding of
superiority. See Mot. at 24. In essence, Plaintiffs are asking the Court to presume that
the statements it makes to support superiority are, in fact, true.

45

But “[a]ctual, not

Case 1:14-cv-02887-JLK Document 51 Filed 06/01/16 USDC Colorado Page 54 of 56

presumed, conformance with Rule 23 remains indispensable.” CGC Holding, 773 F.3d at
1086 (quotation marks and alterations omitted).

Such generalized and unsupported

statements fall woefully short of satisfying the Plaintiffs strict burden to “prove that . . .
in fact” a class action “is superior to other available methods[.]” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at
350; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).

Given the many individualized mini-trial type

determinations that inhere in the Plaintiffs’ remaining causes of action, it is clear that
classwide resolution of neither question is superior. The Court should therefore deny
certification on this basis as well.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, GEO respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’
motion for class certification in its entirety.
