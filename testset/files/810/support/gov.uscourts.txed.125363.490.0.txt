IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
TYLER DIVISION
ERICSSON INC., et al.,
Plaintiffs,
Civil Action No. 6:10-cv-473
vs.
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
D-LINK CORPORATION, et al.,
Defendants.

PLAINTIFF’S’ MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW
Plaintiffs Ericsson Inc.’s and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson’s (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) hereby file these motions for judgment as a matter of law.
Rule 50 motions are governed by “the law of the regional circuit where the appeal from
the district court normally would lie.” Z4 Techs., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 507 F.3d 1340, 1346
(Fed. Cir. 2007). Judgment as a matter of law is proper if no “reasonable juror could arrive at a
verdict in [the plaintiff’s] favor” on plaintiff’s legal claims, or against a defendant on its
affirmative defenses. See McNair v. City of Cedar Park, 993 F.2d 1217, 1219 (5th Cir. 1993).
“‘Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.’” Eli Lilly & Co. v. Aradigm
Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S.
197, 229 (1938)). Entry of a judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if evidence supporting
the movant is “uncontradicted and unimpeached [or] if the facts and inferences point so strongly
and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that [a] reasonable [jury] could

not arrive at a contrary verdict.” Med. Care Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 341 F.3d 415,
420 (5th Cir. 2003).
In resolving a Rule 50 motion, the court “must first excise inadmissible evidence,”
including unreliable expert testimony. Hodges v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 474 F.3d 188, 193 (5th Cir.
2006). Inferences that are “mere speculation and conjecture” are “not sufficient to support a
jury’s verdict.” Guile v. United States, 422 F.3d 221, 225 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Further, conclusory expert testimony does not qualify as substantial evidence.
See Iovate Health Sci., Inc. v. Bio-Engineered Supplements & Nutrition, Inc., 586 F.3d 1376,
1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (applying Fifth Circuit law). Likewise, “when an expert opinion is not
supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or when indisputable record
facts contradict or otherwise render the opinion unreasonable, it cannot support a jury’s verdict.”
Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242 (1993); Smith v.
Louisville Ladder Co., 237 F.3d 515, 519-21 (5th Cir. 2001) (failure of expert witness to support
proof of necessary case elements warrants judgment as a matter of law); El Aguila Food Prods.,
Inc. v. Gruma Corp., 131 Fed. Appx. 450, 453-54, 2005 WL 1156090, *2 (5th Cir. 2005)
(affirming district court’s exclusion of damages expert testimony and finding that it “would not
have provided a sufficient basis on which the jury could have arrived at a reasonable and just
estimate of actual damages”).
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 1: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient clear
and convincing evidence that U.S. Patent No. 6,466,568 (“the ‘568 patent”) is invalid under 35
U.S.C. 102 and 103. The Defendants failed to show that either element of claim 1 of the ‘568
patent or the entirety of claim 5 of the ‘568 patent is met by any of the prior art listed in their
invalidity contentions. Defendants also did not present any evidence that the ‘568 patent claims

2

Case 6:10-cv-00473-LED-KFG Document 490

Filed 06/11/13 Page 3 of 8 PageID #: 15472

were invalid under any section of 35 U.S.C. 112.

Therefore, none of these defenses can

invalidate the ‘568 patent by clear and convincing evidence.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 2: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient clear
and convincing evidence that U.S. Patent No. 6,772,215 (“the ‘215 patent”) is invalid under 35
U.S.C. 102 and 103. The Defendants failed to show that the third element of claim 1 of the ‘215
patent or the entirety of claim 2 of the ‘215 patent is met by any of the prior art listed in their
invalidity contentions. Defendants also did not present any evidence that the ‘215 patent claims
were invalid under any section of 35 U.S.C. 112.

Therefore, none of these defenses can

invalidate the ‘215 patent by clear and convincing evidence.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 3: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient clear
and convincing evidence that U.S. Patent No. 6,519,223 (“the ‘223 patent”) is invalid under 35
U.S.C. 102 and 103. The Defendants failed to show that either element of claim 11 of the ‘223
patent is met by any of the prior art listed in their invalidity contentions. Defendants also did not
present any evidence that the ‘223 patent claims were invalid under any section of 35 U.S.C.
112. Therefore, none of these defenses can invalidate the ‘223 patent by clear and convincing
evidence.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 4: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient clear
and convincing evidence that U.S. Patent No. 6,330,435 (“the ‘435 patent”) is invalid under 35
U.S.C. 102 and 103. The Defendants failed to show that the third or fourth elements of claim 1
of the ‘435 patent or the entirety of claim 2 of the ‘435 patent is met by any of the prior art listed
in their invalidity contentions. In addition, Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing
evidence that the Petras ETSI Submission (DX-120) met each and every element of claims 1 and
2 of the ‘435 patent. Defendants also did not present any evidence that the ‘435 patent claims

3

Case 6:10-cv-00473-LED-KFG Document 490

Filed 06/11/13 Page 4 of 8 PageID #: 15473

were invalid under any section of 35 U.S.C. 112.

Therefore, none of these defenses can

invalidate the ‘435 patent by clear and convincing evidence.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 5: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient clear
and convincing evidence that U.S. Patent No. 6,424,625 (“the ‘625 patent”) is invalid under 35
U.S.C. 102 and 103. The Defendants failed to show that the first element of claim 1 of the ‘625
patent is met by any of the prior art listed in their invalidity contentions. In addition, Defendants
failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the Petras ETSI Submission (DX-120) met
each and every element of claim 1 of the ‘625 patent. Defendants also did not present any
evidence that the ‘625 patent claims were invalid under any section of 35 U.S.C. 112. Therefore,
none of these defenses can invalidate the ‘625 patent by clear and convincing evidence.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 6: Ericsson also moves for judgment as a matter of law
on damages.

Defendants’ damages theory improperly disregards the numerous real world

licenses covering the patents in suit. In addition, Defendants ask the jury to award hypothetical
future damages based on an improperly calculated royalty rate.

By doing so, Defendants

improperly attempt to usurp the role of the Court in determining the appropriateness of an
injunction or a compulsory royalty. The evidence shows that the appropriate damages in this
case are 50 cents per unit.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 7: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their laches defense. Defendants provided no proof of (1) unreasonably delay in
filing suit or (2) prejudice to Defendants resulting from the delay.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 8: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their equitable estoppel defense. Defendants provided no proof of (1) misleading

statements or conduct, (2) any action in reliance on those statements or conduct, or (3) prejudice
resulting from that reliance.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 9: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their waiver defense. Defendants provided no proof that (1) Ericsson intentionally
relinquished its rights to enforce the patents in suit or (2) otherwise engaged in conduct so
inconsistent with an intent to enforce its rights as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has
been relinquished.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 10: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their implied license defense. Defendants provided no proof that (1) Ericsson
granted any rights to the defendants regarding the patents in suit, or (2) that those granted rights
lead to reasonable belief that an implied license had been granted.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 11: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their acquiescence defense. Defendants provided no proof that Ericsson acquiesced
to Defendants use of the patents in suit.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 12: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their lack of standing defense. Defendants provided no proof that (1) Ericsson lacks
standing in this case or (2) Ericsson is not the owner of the patents in suit or the holder of the
exclusive enforcement rights of the patents in suit.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 13: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their exhaustion defense. Defendants provided no proof of (1) Defendants’ purchase
of a patented article from Ericsson or (2) a grant of a license or authority from Ericsson to the
patents in suit.

Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 14: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their unclean hands defense. Defendants provided no proof that Ericsson has acted
unethically, in bad faith, or otherwise come to this suit with unclean hands.
Judgment as a Matter of Law No. 15: Defendants failed to produce legally sufficient
evidence of their failure to comply with 35 U.S.C. § 111 and 116 defense. Defendants provided
no proof that (1) Ericsson failed to comply with any portion of § 111 or 116, including defective
oaths and improper or incorrect inventorship.
