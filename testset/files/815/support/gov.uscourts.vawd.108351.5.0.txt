EXPEDITED MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, Plaintiff, by counsel, respectfully requests that the Court
grant him a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (1) enjoining the Defendants
from revoking or modifying Plaintiffs permit for which he applied on May 30, 2017 to hold a
demonstration in Emancipation Park on August 12, 2017; 2) enjoining Defendants to allow
Plaintiffs pennitted demonstration to go on as planned in Emancipation Park from 12pm to 5pm
on August 12, 2017; and 3) enjoining Defendants to provide such security as may be necessary to
protect the rights of the demonstrators and the public.
As more fully set f01th in Plaintiffs Memorandum in Support, Plaintiff is likely to succeed
on the merits of its claims and will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.

Case 3:17-cv-00056-GEC Document 5 Filed 08/11/17 Page 1 of 4 Pageid#: 47

The balance of equities tilts strongly in its favor, and an injunction protecting Plaintiff's
constitutional rights is accord with the public interest.
Wherefore a preliminary injunction and or temporary restraining order should issue.

Respectfully submitted,
JASON KESSLER

By Counsel
