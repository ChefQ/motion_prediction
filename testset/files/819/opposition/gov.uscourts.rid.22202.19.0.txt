MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF PLAINTIFF JKA, INC.’S OBJECTION
TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF
PERSONAL JURISDICTION OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
TO TRANSFER TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA

Plaintiff JKA, Inc. d/b/a Diversified Distribution (“Diversified”) submits this
memorandum in support of its objection to the “Motion To Dismiss For Lack Of Personal
Jurisdiction Or, In The Alternative, To Transfer To The Northern District Of Georgia”
(the “Motion”) filed by defendant Anisa International, Inc. (“Anisa”). As shown below,
this Court has both specific and general personal jurisdiction over Anisa. As a
consequence, the Motion should be denied.
Factual Background
A. The Litigation
This is a patent infringement action. Diversified is the assignee of U.S. Design
Patent No. D-475,918 (the ‘918 Patent”), entitled “Cosmetic Carrying Case,” which
issued on June 17, 2003. A copy of the ‘918 Patent is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

The product covered by the ‘918 Patent is a plastic carrying case with a slide
fastener running along the rear side of the case. The case is used to hold brushes or other
cosmetic products. Exhibit B hereto is a photograph of a carrying case made by
Diversified which embodies the invention of the ‘918 Patent.
In its Complaint, Diversified alleges that Anisa has been and is making, using,
offering for sale, and selling cosmetic carrying cases which embody the invention of the
‘918 Patent, without authorization from Diversified. Complaint ¶ 7. Diversified alleges
that these activities constitute patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271.
B. The Parties
1. Plaintiff Diversified
Diversified is a Rhode Island corporation based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.
Diversified makes bath and beauty products, including the cosmetic carrying case
embodying the ‘918 Patent. Diversified sells these products at wholesale to companies
which operate retail stores.
2. Defendant Anisa
Anisa is a Georgia corporation.1 Like Diversified, Anisa makes bath and beauty
products, and sells them at wholesale to companies which operate retail stores. Id.
Among the products which Anisa makes and sells is a plastic cosmetic carrying case with
a slide fastener running along the rear side of the case. These cases are used to hold
brushes or other cosmetic products. Exhibit C is a photograph of a case made by Anisa.

In its Motion, Anisa argues that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Anisa.
But the Motion fails to discuss several points which are critical to the jurisdictional
analysis in patent infringement cases. The Motion fails to discuss the Federal Circuit
Court of Appeals case law which applies to jurisdictional disputes in patent infringement
cases; it fails to discuss the “stream of commerce” rule of personal jurisdiction followed
by the Federal Circuit; and it fails to address many of the significant contacts between
Anisa and the State of Rhode Island.
In the alternative, Anisa requests that this action be transferred to the Northern
District of Georgia. But it has presented no facts in support of that request.
ARGUMENT
For the reasons given below, this Court has both specific and general personal
jurisdiction over Anisa. As a result, Anisa’s Motion should be dismissed.
I.

The Process For Determining Whether Personal Jurisdiction Exists In
A Patent Infringement Case

The principles used for determining whether personal jurisdiction exists over an
out-of-state defendant in a patent infringement case differ somewhat from the principles
used in other cases. The standards used in patent infringement litigation were set out by
the Federal Circuit in Schwanger v. Munchkin, Inc., 1999 WL 820449 (Fed. Cir. 1999):
Determining whether jurisdiction exists over an out-of-state
defendant involves two inquiries: whether a forum state’s
long-arm statute permits the assertion of jurisdiction and
whether assertion of personal jurisdiction violates federal
due process. In performing the first inquiry, this court
defers to the interpretation of a state’s long-arm statute
given by that state’s highest court, particularly whether or
not the statute is intended to reach the limit of federal due
process. However, in the second inquiry, the federal
constitutional due process analysis, this Court analyzes the
defendant’s contacts with the forum state to determine if
-6PRV 928343.1

Case 1:07-cv-00123-S-DLM

the exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. In
doing so for patent cases, this Court does not defer to the
interpretations of other regional federal and state courts.
Schwanger, supra at *2 (citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).
This two-part approach to the jurisdictional analysis in patent cases -- and the fact
that regional federal law is not relevant to the analysis in patent infringement cases -- has
been expressed by the Federal Circuit and other federal courts on numerous occasions.
See, e.g., Beverly Hills Fan Company v. Royal Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558, 1565
n.13, 1566-69 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (following two-part inquiry described in Schwanger; “we
owe no special deference to regional circuit law…Since an important role of the Federal
Circuit is to eliminate forum shopping, on either substantive or procedural grounds,
consistency in this area [of personal jurisdiction] would advance that role.”); Red Wing
Shoe Co. v. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc., 148 F.3d 1355, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 1998)(same);
Fallon Luminous Products Corp. v. Multi Media Electronics, Inc., 343 F. Supp. 502, 504
(D.S.C. 2004) (following two-part analysis set out in Beverly Hills Fan; “Because this is
a patent infringement case, Federal Circuit law, rather than Fourth Circuit law, controls
the analysis of jurisdiction.”) (citations omitted).
A. The Rhode Island Long-Arm Statute
The first part of the Federal Circuit’s two-part jurisdictional inquiry requires
consideration of the forum state’s long-arm statute. Anisa correctly notes that Rhode
Island’s long-arm statute, R. I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-33, extends to the full extent permitted
by the federal constitution. Def. Mem., p. 8. “Because the Rhode Island Supreme Court
has held that the state’s long-arm statute is co-extensive with federal constitutional limits,

only those limits constrain this Court’s jurisdiction.” CVS Corp. v. Taubman Centers,
Inc., 225 F. Supp. 2d 120, 123 (D.R.I. 2002).
B. Federal Due Process
The second part of the inquiry requires a review of federal due process
considerations. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that, for federal due
process purposes, personal jurisdiction comes in two forms: general and specific.
Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 966 U.S. 408, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80
L.Ed.2d 404 (1984). The showing needed to establish each of these types of jurisdiction,
consistent with federal due process, is discussed below. As noted, only Federal Circuit
law—not regional circuit law—is relevant to this discussion.10
1. Specific Jurisdiction
To establish specific jurisdiction, the court must be able to find that “if [the
defendant] be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum
contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend “traditional notions
of fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310,
316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed.2d 95 (1945), quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457,
463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 343, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940). Later cases have clarified that the
minimum contacts must be “purposeful contacts.” Beverly Hills Fan, supra at 1565,
quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 2183, 85
L.Ed.2d 578 (1985). “The requirement for purposeful minimum contacts helps ensure

10

Anisa fails to recognize this important point. In the discussion of federal due process contained in its
brief, Anisa relies heavily on First Circuit and Rhode Island District Court case law in support of its
jurisdictional argument. Def. Mem., pp. 7-10, 13. For the reasons given above, however, these cases are
not relevant. In a patent infringement case, only Federal Circuit (and Supreme Court) case law is relevant
to the due process analysis.

that non-residents have fair warning that a particular activity may subject them to
litigation within the forum.” Id.
a. Minimum Contacts
In World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62
L.Ed.2d 490 (1980), the United States Supreme Court announced that, in certain
circumstances, the delivery of goods into the “stream of commerce” can satisfy the
“purposeful minimum contacts” test for specific personal jurisdiction:
[I]f the sale of a product of a manufacturer or
distributor…is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises
from the efforts of the [defendants] to serve, directly or
indirectly, the market for its product…, it is not
unreasonable to subject it to suit…The forum state does not
exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts
personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its
products into the stream of commerce, with the expectation
that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum
State.
Id. at 297-98, 100 S. Ct. at 567.
The Federal Circuit has held that personal jurisdiction exists over a foreign
defendant under the “stream of commerce” doctrine if two facts are present: the
defendant placed its products into the stream of commerce through “an established
distribution channel,” and the defendant knew, or reasonably could have foreseen, that a
termination point of the channel was the forum state. For example, in Beverly Hills Fan,
the manufacturer and importer of a fan (Ultrec and Royal, respectively) which allegedly
infringed the plaintiff’s patent sold the accused fans to a national chain of hardware stores
known as Builder’s Square. At the time of suit, the plaintiff showed that 52 of the
accused fans were for sale in Builder’s Square stores in the forum state (Virginia). Based
on these facts, the Federal Circuit found personal jurisdiction:
-9PRV 928343.1

Case 1:07-cv-00123-S-DLM

Document 19

Filed 01/04/2008

Page 12 of 23

It is undisputed that at least fifty-two Ultrec fans were
present in Virginia…[I]t can be presumed that the
distribution channel formed by defendants and Builder’s
Square was intentionally established, and that the
defendants knew, or reasonably could have foreseen, that a
termination point of the channel was Virginia.
21 F.3d at 1564.
In Schwanger, the Federal Circuit held that the same two factors—an established
distribution channel, and knowledge that it terminated in the forum state—was sufficient
to confer jurisdiction over a foreign defendant under the stream of commerce theory. In
the process, the court found that selling to a national retailer amounted to the use of a
well-established distribution channel:
[T]he allegations here are that [defendant] purposefully
shipped the accused product into Ohio, through Wal-Mart,
an established distribution channel. The cause of action for
patent infringement is alleged to arise out of these
activities. No more is required to establish the purposeful
minimum contacts necessary for personal jurisdiction.
217 F.3d *6 (citing Beverly Hills Fan, supra, 21 F.2d at 1565).
Following Beverly Hills Fan and Schwanger, numerous federal district courts
have found personal jurisdiction over patent infringement defendants who ship their
products through an established distribution channel (or to a national retail chain) with
knowledge that the channel terminates in the forum state. For example, in Fallon
Luminous Products Corp., the court found jurisdiction because the defendant (MME)
sold its product to a national retailer (Wal-Mart), and the products ended up in the forum
state:
MME intentionally sells the allegedly infringing neon signs
to Wal-Mart, knowing that it has stores throughout the
nation. By selling the neon signs to Wal-Mart, a likely
destination of the neon signs is one of the eighteen WalMart discount stores or forty-two Wal-Mart supercenters in

South Carolina. Further, [plaintiff] confirmed the presence
of MME’s allegedly infringing neon signs in South
Carolina by purchasing one of them at a Spartanburg, South
Carolina Wal-Mart. Based on the foregoing, the court finds
that MME purposefully directed the allegedly infringing
neon signs at South Carolina by placing them in the stream
of commerce through an established distribution chain.
343 F. Supp. 2d at 507.11 Accord, Elonex Plase II Power Management Litigation, 2003
WL 21026758 *2 (D. Del. 2003) (defendant Jean sold its computer monitors to
distributors, who resold them to national retailer chains such as Circuit City and
CompUSA; “given [the distributors’] extensive re-reseller networks in Delaware and on
the Internet, Jean cannot credibly claim it had no inkling that some of its monitors would
make their way into Delaware via well-established distribution channels.”) Braley v.
Sportec Products Co., 2002 WL 1676293 *4 (D.N.H. 2002)(finding personal jurisdiction
where defendant “put its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that
it would be purchased by NASCAR fans, many of whom could be found in New
Hampshire.”).
b. Reasonableness
A finding of minimum contacts and purposeful availment is not by itself enough
to establish specific personal jurisdiction consistent with federal due process. “Even if
the requisite minimum contacts have been found through an application of the stream of
commerce theory or otherwise, if it would be unreasonable for the forum to assert
jurisdiction under all the facts and circumstances, then due process requires that
jurisdiction be denied.” Beverly Hills Fan, 21 F.3d at 1568. Evaluating the
11

Like the Schwanger court, the Fallon court found that sales to a national retailer amounted to the use of
an established distribution channel: “MME sold the allegedly infringing neon signs to a national retailer,
Wal-Mart, which has a known nationwide distribution chain. Therefore, MME intentionally established a
nationwide distribution network.” Id.

reasonableness of asserting jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant requires a
consideration of several factors, including the burden on the defendant, the interest of the
forum state, and the plaintiff’s interests. Id.
The Federal Circuit, however, has made it clear that cases where reasonableness
concerns override otherwise sufficient minimum contacts will be very unusual:
[T]hese cases are limited to the rare situation in which the
plaintiff’s interest and the state’s interest are so attenuated
that they are clearly outweighed by the burden of
subjecting the defendant to litigation within the forum. See
Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477, 105 S. Ct., at 2185 (must be
“compelling case” of unreasonableness); Keeton, 465 U.S.
at 774-75, 104 S. Ct. at 1478-79 (purposeful minimum
contacts ‘ordinarily’ enough).

2. General Jurisdiction
The second type of personal jurisdiction is general jurisdiction. “General
jurisdiction arises when a defendant maintains ‘continuous and systematic’ contacts with
the forum state even when the cause of action has no relation to those contacts.” LSI
Indus. Inc. v. Hubbell Lighting, Inc., 232 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2000), citing
Helicopteros Nacionales, supra, 466 U.S. at 414-16. “Neither the United States Supreme
Court nor [the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals] has outlined a specific test to follow
when analyzing whether a defendant’s activities within a state are ‘continuous and
systematic.’ Instead, a court must look at the facts of each case to make such a
determination.” Burger King, supra, at 472-73.
Although no specific test has been articulated, the Supreme Court has issued two
decisions which illustrate how the “continuous and systematic” inquiry applies in
particular cases. In Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 72 S.Ct.
413, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952), the Court found that the defendant’s in-forum contacts were
continuous and systematic enough to justify the exercise of general personal
jurisdiction.12 On the other hand, in Helicopteros Nacionales, the Court found that the
defendant’s in-forum contacts were did not justify the assertion of general jurisdiction.13

12

In Perkins, the general manager and president of the defendant (a Phillipine corporation) maintained an
office in Ohio, maintained company documents in Ohio, held directors’ meetings in Ohio, and “carried on
in Ohio a continuous and systematic supervision of the necessarily limited wartime activities of the
company.” 342 U.S. at 448, 72 S.Ct. at 419.
13

The Helicopteros Nacionales court found that the defendant Columbian corporation’s general business
contacts with Texas were not “continuous and systematic” where the defendant made purchases from
Texas, sent personnel to Texas for training, and sent an officer of the corporation on a single trip to Texas
for contract negotiations, but had never performed operations or solicited business within the state. The
Court held that “mere purchases” and the related brief presence of employees in the forum state did not
amount to the “continuous and systematic general business contacts” contemplated by the Perkins court.

The Federal Circuit has stated that where an agent or employee of an out-of-state
company lives and works in the forum state, “that weighs in favor of the exercise of
general jurisdiction over the company.” Delta Sys., Inc., v. Indak Mfg. Corp., 4
Fed.Appx. 857, 861 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (unpub. op.)14 The Delta court noted with approval
two regional Circuit Court decisions which held that the presence of a defendant’s agent
in the forum state is relevant to the question whether general jurisdiction exists. 4 Fed.
Appx. at 861 (citing Trieweiler v. Croxton & Trench Holding Corp., 90 F.3d 1523, 1533
(10th Cir. 1996) (“whether the corporation solicits business in the state through a local
office or agents” is pertinent factor in jurisdictional analysis) and Michigan Nat’l Bank v.
Quality Dinette, Inc., 888 F.2d 462, 466-67 (6th Cir. 1989) (reversing dismissal for lack
of general jurisdiction where, inter alia, foreign company retained independent sales
representative in forum state)).
As in the case of specific personal jurisdiction, if the court determines that there
are sufficient minimum contacts with the forum to support general jurisdiction over the
defendant, the court still must determine whether the assertion of such jurisdiction is
reasonable under the circumstances of the case. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc., v. Propet

466 U.S. at 416-18, 104 S.Ct. at 1873-74.

It appears that the Delta decision was originally released pursuant to Local Rule 47.6 of the Federal
Court Rules. That Rule prohibited parties from citing the “order” within a decision “as precedent.”
However, Local Rule 47.6 was repealed in 2006 pursuant to new F.R.A.P. 32.1. Moreover, numerous
district courts have cited to the Delta decision. See, e.g., Massachusetts Institute of Technology v. Micron
Technology, Inc., 508 F.Supp.2d 112, 121 (D. Mass. Aug. 23, 2007) (finding general jurisdiction over
foreign defendant); 3M Innovative Properties Co. v. InFocus Corp., 2005 WL 361494, *2 (D.Minn. 2005);
Eli Lilly and Co. v. Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc., 504 F.Supp.2d 387, 394 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 28, 2007); Logan
Farms v. HGH, Inc., DE, 282 F.Supp.2d 776, 793 (S.D.Ohio 2003). Diversified therefore believes that it
may cite to and rely on the Delta decision as long as it indicates that the decision is unpublished.

Application Of The Foregoing Standards Makes Clear That This
Court Has Specific Jurisdiction Over Anisa
__

Beverly Hills Fan and its progeny make clear that this Court has specific personal
jurisdiction over Anisa under the “stream of commerce” doctrine. [REDACTED] p. 72.
[REDACTED] Id., p. 75. Diversified’s own witnesses saw dozens of the Accused
Carrying Cases for sale at the same store on two other occasions. Barna Aff., ¶ 3; King
Aff., ¶ 3.
These facts make it plain that the two points needed to establish specific personal
jurisdiction under the Federal Circuit’s stream of commerce doctrine—the defendant’s
use of an established distribution channel (or national retailer), and its knowledge that the
forum state is a likely termination point of that channel—are present here. There is no
meaningful difference between the facts of this case and those at issue in Beverly Hills
Fan (defendants sold to Builder’s Square knowing that Builder’s Square would resell
product in forum state); Schwanger (sales to Wal-Mart knowing Wal-Mart would resell
in forum); Fallon (same) and Elonex (sales to distributor, which resold to Circuit City and
CompUSA). Because Diversified’s claim of patent infringement relates to Anisa’s sale
[REDACTED], “No more is required to establish the purposeful minimum contacts
necessary for personal jurisdiction.” Schwanger, 1999 WL 820449 *6 (Fed. Cir. 1999).16

Anisa notes that Diversified did not plead facts in its Complaint that would demonstrate that this Court
has personal jurisdiction over Anisa. Def. Mem. at 10. Doing so is not necessary. “[T]he complaint need
not allege . . . the basis for jurisdiction over the defendant’s person or property.” Wright & Miller, Federal
Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d § 1207, p. 121.

There is no question that the carrying cases Del Ponte identified at his deposition as having been sold to
[REDACTED] are the same products alleged to infringe the ‘918 Patent. Affidavit of Janice Ajootian, ¶ 3.

This is not one of those “rare” cases in which it would be unreasonable to assert
jurisdiction over Anisa despite its purposeful minimum contacts with Rhode Island. To
begin with, Rhode Island has a significant interest this dispute. To paraphrase the
Beverly Hills Fan court:
[Rhode Island’s] interests in the dispute are significant.
[Rhode Island] has an interest in discouraging injuries that
occur within the state. That interest extends to design
patent infringement actions such as the one here.
Beverly Hills Fan, supra at 1568 (citation omitted).
Rhode Island has another interest in serving as the forum for this action as well.
To paraphrase Beverly Hills Fan again:
[Rhode Island] also has a substantial interest in cooperating
with other states to provide a forum for efficiently litigating
plaintiff’s cause of action. [Diversified] will be able to
seek redress in [Rhode Island] for sales of the [Accused
Carrying Cases] to consumers in these other states. These
other states will thus be spared the burden of providing a
forum for [Diversified] to seek redress for these sales. And
[Anisa] will be protected from harassment resulting from
multiple suits.
Beverly Hills Fan, supra at 1568 (citation and footnote omitted).
Finally, the burden on Anisa of litigating this action in Rhode Island would not be
so onerous as to deny it due process. A comparison with other cases makes this clear.
See Fallon, supra at 508 (requiring New York company to defend patent infringement
action in South Carolina did not impose excessive burden); Elonex, supra at *3 (requiring
Taiwanese company to defend in Delaware did not impose excessive burden); Beverly
Hills Fan, 21 F.3d at 1569 (requiring Chinese and New York companies to defend in
Virginia did not impose excessive burden).
For the foregoing reasons, this Court has specific personal jurisdiction over Anisa.

Application Of The Foregoing Standards Makes Clear That This
Court Has General Personal Jurisdiction Over Anisa

This Court also has general personal jurisdiction over Anisa. That is because
Anisa has “continuous and systematic” contacts with Rhode Island. Two points make
this clear.
First, the fact that Del Ponte lives and works for Anisa in Rhode Island establishes
a continuous and systematic contact with this State, and “weighs in favor of the exercise
of general jurisdiction.” Delta, supra at 861. The nature and extent of Del Ponte’s
activities make his presence here especially significant. Del Ponte is not a mere dealer or
sales representative trying to sell his company’s wares. Rather, he is a corporate officer
of Anisa. He is “responsible for Anisa’s sales throughout the United States.” Def. Mem.
at 5. In the course of supervising Anisa’s sales throughout the United States, Del Ponte
[REDACTED] – a testament to his importance to the company. Under Federal Circuit
case law, these substantial activities all weigh strongly in favor of a finding of general
jurisdiction.17
A second reason why general jurisdiction is present here is because the facts of
this case are much closer to those in Perkins – where the Supreme Court found that
general jurisdiction existed – than to those in Helicopteros Nacionales, where it found
that such jurisdiction did not exist. In contrast to Helicpoteros Nacionales, where the
defendant’s agents made just a few visits into the forum, Del Ponte lives and works
continuously in Rhode Island. In contrast to Helicpoteros Nacionales, where the
defendant never performed any business or conducted any operations in the forum, Del
17

As Anisa notes, several district courts have found that the presence of one or more sales agents in the
forum state is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction. See Def. Mem. at 14-16 (citing cases). These
cases are not controlling, however, because i) they were not decided under Federal Circuit law, and ii) they
involved sales agents with far less substantial responsibilities than Del Ponte has.

Ponte has spent thousands of hours performing a variety of substantive tasks for Anisa in
Rhode Island. As in Perkins, where the defendant maintained an office, maintained
company documents, and conducted meetings in the forum state, Anisa’s Del Ponte
maintains an office, maintains company documents, and has [REDACTED].
In fact, the volume of contacts between Anisa and Rhode Island dwarfs the forum
contacts identified in Perkins. Anisa pays taxes to Rhode Island; [REDACTED] sold
goods to a Rhode Island company; has made an estimated [REDACTED] phone calls
into Rhode Island; has sent at least [REDACTED] emails, comprising an estimated
[REDACTED] pages of material, into Rhode Island; has conducted [REDACTED] in
Rhode Island; and has a corporate officer living and working here. These contacts are
more than enough to support a finding of general jurisdiction.
IV.

Anisa’s Motion In The Alternative To Transfer This Case To The
Northern District Of George Should Be Denied

If the Court concludes that it has personal jurisdiction over Anisa, Anisa requests
that this action be transferred to the Northern District of Georgia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1404. The factors traditionally weighed in considering a transfer request under § 1404
include: “(1) the plaintiff’s choice of forum; (2) the convenience of the parties; (3) the
convenience of witnesses and location of documents; (4) any connection between the
forum and the issues; (5) the law to be applied; and (6) the state or public interest at
stake.” Cruz v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 2005 WL 1231965 *2 (D.R.I. 2005).
Apart from the bare fact that it is based in Georgia, Anisa has not presented any
facts which demonstrate that the Cruz factors militate in favor of transferring this case.
Anisa’s failure to adduce any supporting facts requires that its transfer request be denied.
