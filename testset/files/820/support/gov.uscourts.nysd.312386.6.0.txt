Plaintiff Navigator Capital Partners, L.P. respectfully submits this memorandum of law in
support of its Motion to Remand this action to the Supreme Court of the State of New York.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
In a contrived effort to avoid defending Plaintiff’s fiduciary duty claims on the merits,
Defendants strain to shoehorn the facts alleged in the Complaint1 into two wholly inapplicable
statutory bases for removal: SLUSA and CAFA. Neither the law nor the facts alleged in the
Complaint support Defendants’ ludicrous attempt to characterize Plaintiff’s claims under
Delaware law as federal securities law claims. Plaintiff respectfully submits that remand to New
York State Supreme Court is required to enable Plaintiff to pursue its claims without further
unwarranted delay. An award of attorneys’ fees and costs incurred as a result of Defendants’
improper removal is also appropriate here.
Plaintiff and the other limited partners (the “Class”) that held Partnership Interests at any
time during the period from August 1, 2006 through July 18, 2007 (the “Class Period”) lost
hundreds of millions of dollars when Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies, L.P.
(the “Partnership” or the “Fund”) imploded this summer. The Partnership and the value of Class
members’ Partnership Interests evaporated because the Management Defendants failed to
properly manage the Partnership and its investments during the recent decline in the sub-prime
mortgage market. This case arises out of the Management Defendants’ breach of the fiduciary
duties they owed to Plaintiff, other limited partners, and to the Partnership itself. Accordingly,
the Complaint alleges prototypical Delaware state law breach of fiduciary duty claims, and does
not present any federal question or other basis for federal jurisdiction. The complexity of the

1

Capitalized terms used in this Preliminary Statement but not defined herein have the meanings attributed to such
terms in the Statement of Facts below and/or in the Complaint.

Case 1:07-cv-07783-AKH

Document 6

Page 7 of 28

underlying facts and circumstances does not alter the fact that Plaintiff’s claims are classic
breach of fiduciary duty claims that belong in state court.
Defendants first attempt to avoid defending Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claims by
pretending that the Complaint concerns “covered securities” and is therefore removable under
SLUSA. As a threshold matter, it is beyond dispute that: (a) the Partnership Interests that
Plaintiff and other Class members held in the Partnership are not covered securities; and (b) the
shares of the Cayman-based Master Fund through which the Partnership invested substantially
all of its assets are not “covered securities.” In fact, the Complaint does not allege any
misrepresentations or omissions of material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of any
“covered security.” Rather, the mismanagement and lack of candor at issue in the Complaint
concern sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and related instruments, such as collateralized
debt obligations (“CDOs”) and credit default swaps, all of which are also indisputably not
“covered securities” under any reading of SLUSA.
Because there is no “covered security” to ground their argument for removal under
SLUSA, Defendants are confined to focusing upon a small number of relatively low-dollar
amount positions in publicly traded equity securities held by the Master Fund. Defendants
contend that the mere presence of these minuscule investments warrants removal of this action.
As explained below in Point I.B., these “equity securities” are entirely tangential to the claims at
issue, de minimis in amount and provide no basis for removal under SLUSA. It is therefore
unremarkable that Defendants cite no authority supporting removal based upon the reed thin
relationship that Defendants contend “equity securities” bear to Plaintiff’s claims.
The Court can dispose of Defendants’ fallback argument for removal under CAFA with
equal ease. CAFA specifically exempts from its reach fiduciary duty claims such as those

2

asserted here. As set forth in Point I.C., Defendants’ restrictive reading of CAFA’s “fiduciary
duties” exception is contrary to the plain language of the statute and has been directly rejected by
courts in this District and elsewhere.
New York State Supreme Court is the appropriate forum to resolve this state law
controversy. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant this Remand Motion and award
Plaintiff its costs and attorneys’ fees.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Plaintiff Navigator Capital Partners, L.P. (“Plaintiff”) filed its Class Action and Verified
Derivative Complaint (“Complaint”) on August 6, 2007 in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York (Index No. 07-602663).2 On August 31, 2007, Defendants
Bear Stearns Asset Management Inc. (“BSAM”), Ralph Cioffi, Raymond McGarrigal, Matthew
Tannin (collectively, the “Management Defendants”), Bear, Stearns Securities Corp. (“BSSC”),
The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (“BSC”) and Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. (“BS&Co”)
(collectively, together with the Management Defendants, the “Defendants”) filed a Notice of
Removal (“Def. Notice”) in this Court removing the action in reliance upon the Securities
Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (“SLUSA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77p(c) & 78bb(f)(2), and
the Class Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332, 1441 & 1453.

debt obligations (“CDOs”) that included sub-prime mortgages. ¶ 44. Defendants Cioffi,
McGarrigal and Tannin are officers of BSAM and, together with BSAM, managed the
Partnership at all relevant times. ¶¶ 15, 19-22. BSC is the parent of BSAM, BSSC and BS&Co.,
and is the second largest underwriter of mortgage bonds in the United States. ¶ 17. BSSC acted
as Prime Broker and Custodian to the Master Fund. ¶ 16. BS&Co. is a broker-dealer subsidiary
of BSC and BSSC. ¶ 18.
Defendants offered to sell Partnership Interests to prospective investors through a
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum (“PPM”), dated August 31, 2004. ¶ 28.
Defendants offered additional Partnership Interests pursuant to a second Confidential Private
Placement Memorandum, dated August 2006 (“August 2006 PPM”). ¶ 29. Plaintiff invested
more than $700,000 in the Partnership, and was admitted as a Limited Partner as of September
2004. ¶ 56.
A.

The Partnership’s Investments
1.

Master-Feeder Structure

The Partnership invested substantially all of its assets through the Bear Stearns HighGrade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. (the “Master Fund”), a Cayman Islands
entity. ¶ 34. The Master Fund was organized as part of a “master-feeder” structure through
which separate funds made investments. ¶¶ 34-35. Under the “master-feeder” structure,
“feeder” funds, including the Partnership, conducted most or all of their investment and trading
activities indirectly through investments in the Master Fund. Id.
During the relevant period, the Partnership had beneficial ownership of a percentage of
the Master Fund’s assets. As of December 31, 2006, the Partnership’s beneficial ownership of
the Master Fund’s net assets amounted to 28.58%. ¶ 37. The Master Fund’s assets consisted
predominantly of CDOs and other mortgage-backed structured finance securities.

The Structured Finance Securities At Issue

The objective of the Partnership was to seek high current income and capital
appreciation, “primarily through leveraged investments in investment-grade structured finance
securities with an emphasis on triple-A and double-A rated structured finance securities.” ¶¶ 4,
39 (emphasis added). Defendants stated to investors in August 2005 that the Partnership
“generally takes positions in the high end of the capital structure which is hedged through the
use of credit default swaps”. ¶ 49 (quoting Defendants’ August 2005 response to the Alternative
Investment Management Association’s Illustrative Questionnaire (the “Response”); Entwistle
Decl. Ex. 2, at 14 (emphasis added)). Defendants further stated in the Response that “[t]he Fund
generally invests, on a leveraged basis, in investment-grade structured finance securities rated
AA or higher. In addition, various derivatives, primarily credit-default swaps, but also options,
swaps, swaptions, futures and forward contracts, equity securities and currencies, may be used
for hedging purposes.” ¶ 51 (emphasis added).
Through the Master Fund, the Management Defendants invested Partnership funds in,
among other things, mortgage-backed CDOs. ¶ 40. CDOs are bundled bonds or loans that are
typically “split” or “slice[d”] into several parts (or tranches). Id. The CDO parts are then sold
individually to investors as separate securities. Id. In this case, the Management Defendants
invested the Partnership’s money in CDOs that were backed by sub-prime mortgages, which are
riskier than traditional, credit-worthy mortgages given the borrowers’ poor credit or heavy debt
loads. ¶ 41. The market value of these investments depended upon the flow of principal and
interest paid by sub-prime borrowers whose mortgages served as the underlying collateral for the
mortgage-backed securities. Id. The Defendants were directly involved in the formation of
many of the CDOs that the Management Defendants purchased on the Partnership’s behalf. ¶
42. Given this involvement, and BSAM’s position as the third largest manager of CDOs backed
5

Case 1:07-cv-07783-AKH

Document 6

Filed 09/28/2007

Page 11 of 28

by sub-prime mortgages, the Defendants were keenly aware of the risks inherent in the CDOs in
which they invested the Partnership’s money. ¶¶ 42, 44, 45.
B.

Defendants’ Response To The Collapse Of The Sub-Prime Mortgage Market

Beginning at least as early as August 1, 2006, borrowers increasingly fell behind on their
mortgage payments. ¶ 46. Among sub-prime loans, delinquencies of more than 90 days,
foreclosures and seized properties rose to their highest levels in at least the preceding six years.
Id. These events led to a decrease in the value of CDOs backed by such loans, including those in
which the Partnership was invested. Id. Even as the sub-prime market was collapsing, the
Management Defendants continued to invest the Partnership’s money in risky sub-prime
mortgage-backed securities while at the same time failing to implement hedging and other
strategies to minimize risk effectively. ¶¶ 43, 47. BSC, however, took steps in January 2007 to
reduce its own exposure to the worsening sub-prime mortgage-backed securities market. ¶ 48.
Despite the lack of an effective strategy to minimize the credit risk in the Partnership’s
mortgage-backed investments, the Management Defendants assured investors in a report for
month end February 2007 that notwithstanding the volatility in credit markets associated with
sub-prime mortgages:
The Fund was well positioned for this spread widening because of
the hedges put in place over the second half of 2006. These
hedges were concentrated in the triple-B and single-A tranches
of the ABX indices.4
For the month of March 2007, BSAM reported that the Fund had lost an estimated
3.71%, commenting that:
4

Paragraph 58 of the Complaint inadvertently quoted the Preliminary Performance Profile of a different failed Bear
Stearns fund (the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund) for the period ended
February 28, 2007, and provided the estimated return for that fund. The correct quote is stated above, and a copy of
the February 28, 2007 Preliminary Performance Profile for the Partnership is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Entwistle
Declaration and states that the Fund had lost an estimated 1.32% for the month.

6

Case 1:07-cv-07783-AKH

Document 6

Filed 09/28/2007

Page 12 of 28

Performance suffered in March for two reasons: first, continued
weakness in CDOs with exposure to sub-prime collateral caused
additional mark downs in our long asset exposure; second, our
short positions rose in price as many investors who were short the
sub-prime credit default index covered their positions . . . .
¶ 59 (emphasis added).
For the month of April 2007, BSAM reported (on June 8, 2007) that the Partnership lost,
on an unaudited basis, 5.09%, and that this brought the year to date return as of April 30, 2007,
to negative 6.24%. ¶ 60.
On July 18, 2007, Defendants announced to Plaintiff and to other Class Members that
there was “very little value left for the investors in the High-Grade Fund as of June 30, 2007”
and that “[i]n light of these returns, we will seek an orderly wind-down of the Fund[] over time.”
¶¶ 10, 63. As of March 31, 2007, the Fund had $925 million of investor capital and gross long
positions of $9.682 billion. ¶ 61. As the New York Times concluded, the events leading to the
collapse of the Partnership was “a crisis that Bear, with its long expertise in bonds, structured
products and in particular mortgage-backed securities, should have seen coming.” ¶ 12
(emphasis added).
C.

The Management Defendants’ Breaches Of Fiduciary Duties

As managers and General Partner of the Partnership, the Management Defendants owed
fiduciary duties to Plaintiff and to the other Limited Partners, as well as to the Partnership itself.
¶¶ 2, 12, 87. Under Delaware law, the Management Defendants’ fiduciary duties included the
highest obligations of due care, good faith, candor, loyalty and fair dealing. ¶¶ 70, 89. Indeed,
the August 2006 PPM acknowledged that “[t]he General Partner [i.e., BSAM] has fiduciary

7

Case 1:07-cv-07783-AKH

Document 6

Filed 09/28/2007

Page 13 of 28

responsibilities with respect to the Partnership and will make investment decisions in a manner
consistent with those responsibilities.” ¶ 69 (quoting August 2006 PPM, at 30).5
The Management Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Partnership “by
neglecting to manage the Fund in a manner that would minimize risk and control losses in
connection with sub-prime mortgage-backed securities.” ¶ 2 (emphasis added). See also, e.g.,
¶¶ 54, 75-84. Based upon the Management Defendants’ mismanagement of the Partnership and
their failure to adequately assess, monitor and hedge the risks associated with its investments
backed by sub-prime mortgages, Count III of the Complaint asserts a derivative claim against the
Management Defendants for their breach of fiduciary duties to the Partnership.
The Management Defendants also breached their fiduciary duties to Plaintiff and to the
other Limited Partners by systematically and continuously failing to disclose to Class Members
that the Management Defendants: (a) were not sufficiently monitoring and adequately assessing
the credit risk inherent in the Partnership’s investments; (b) were not determining the frequency
and severity of defaults of the underlying assets of each of the structured finance securities
invested in by the Partnership; (c) were not developing and implementing credit enhancement
mechanisms which would cause cash flow to be diverted away from the Partnership’s riskier
investments under certain market conditions; and (d) were not otherwise adequately engaging in
hedging techniques to minimize risk. ¶¶ 55, 68-74. Based upon the Management Defendants’
failure to adequately disclose these facts, Count I of the Complaint asserts a Class claim against
them for their breach of fiduciary duties to Plaintiff and the Class.
Defendants BSC, BSSC and BS&Co. knowingly participated in, and had actual
knowledge of, the Management Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duties. Accordingly, the

All claims are brought under Delaware law.
ARGUMENT
I.

REMAND OF THIS CASE IS REQUIRED
A.

Legal Standards Governing Remand Motions

Defendants bear the burden of proving that this case has been properly removed, as it is
well settled that “when a party challenges the removal of an action from state court, the burden
falls on the removing party to establish its right to a federal forum by competent proof.” Phillips
v. Reckson Assocs. Realty Corp., No. 06-CV-5971, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83288, *5-6
(E.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2006) (citations and quotations omitted). See also Blockbuster, Inc. v.
Galeno, 472 F.3d 53, 58 (2d Cir. 2006) (party removing under CAFA bears burden of proof).
Further, “out of respect for the independence of state courts, and in order to control the federal
docket, federal courts construe the removal statute [28 U.S.C. 1447] narrowly, resolving any
doubts against removability.” Phillips, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83288, at *6 (citations and
quotations omitted; emphasis added) (rejecting SLUSA removal).
B.

SLUSA Is Inapplicable

Defendants try to miscast Plaintiff’s Complaint in an attempt to bring this case within the
scope of SLUSA. SLUSA does not justify Defendants’ improper removal of this case because
the Complaint’s allegations are plainly beyond the intended scope, purpose and language of
SLUSA. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77p(c), 78bb(f).
In order to be removed under SLUSA, Defendants must establish that Plaintiff’s claims:
(1) constitute a “covered class action” (2) filed in state court (3) based on state law (4) alleging a

misrepresentation or omission of material fact (5) “in connection with” the purchase or sale (6)
of a “covered security.” See, e.g., Ring v. AXA Financial, Inc., 483 F.3d 95, 98 (2d Cir. 2007).
“[A] lawsuit that does not satisfy all the SLUSA criteria must be remanded to state court.” Id.
(citing 15 U.S.C. §§ 78bb(f)(1) and (f)(3)(D)).
Plaintiff does not dispute that the Complaint’s claims satisfy the first, second and third of
these elements (nor, with respect to the Class Claims, the fourth element). Defendants, however,
cannot establish the remaining essential elements for SLUSA removal: that the claims allege
misrepresentations or omissions of material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of a
covered security.
1.

No “Covered Security” Is At Issue

As the Second Circuit has observed, “SLUSA only converts into federal claims those
state claims that fall within its clear preemptive scope, thereby confining federal question
jurisdiction under this statutory regime to a subset of securities fraud cases.” Spielman v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 332 F.3d 116, 124 (2d Cir. 2003). In particular, Congress
“expressly confin[ed] SLUSA preemption and removal to lawsuits in which the plaintiff alleges
a state law violation stemming from (for purposes of this suit) ‘a misrepresentation or omission
of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.’” Id. (quoting
15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1)(A)) (emphasis added).6
“SLUSA defines ‘covered securities’ by reference to paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15 U.S.C.
§ 77r(b). The cited paragraphs define ‘covered securities’ [as] securities listed on one of the
national securities exchanges as well as securities issued by investment companies registered
with the SEC.” Ring, 483 F.3d at 99 (citing 15 U.S.C. § 77p(f)(3) and 15 U.S.C. § 77r(b)(1) &
6

See also 15 U.S.C. § 77p(b) (Securities Act of 1933) (same).

(2)). Citing no case law whatsoever, Defendants baldly assert that this action “clearly pertains to
‘a covered security.’” (Def. Notice ¶ 18.) Not so.
Defendants cannot dispute that the Partnership Interests that Plaintiff and other Class
members held in the Partnership are not “covered securities” under SLUSA. Nor is there any
dispute that shares of the Cayman-based Master Fund – through which the Partnership “invested
substantially all [of its] assets” (Def. Notice ¶ 4 (quoting Compl. ¶ 34)) – are not “covered
securities.” Further, it is undisputed that the investments at the heart of this case – collateralized
debt obligations (CDOs) and other structured finance securities backed by sub-prime mortgages
– are not covered securities.
Accordingly, the only conceivable “covered securities” to which Defendants can point
are a handful of relatively small equity positions taken by the Master Fund, none of which are at
issue in this case. Indeed, Defendants’ entire argument rests on the purported fact that a de
minimis portion of the “Fund’s assets were invested through the Master Fund in multiple
positions consisting of millions of dollars in equity securities listed on national exchanges.”
(Def. Notice ¶ 18.)7 As the Complaint makes plain, these small equity positions are irrelevant
and entirely tangential to the claims in this case – claims which are based on the Management
Defendants’ inadequate monitoring and hedging activities in connection with the Partnership’s
highly leveraged exposure to the sub-prime mortgage market. Apart from the fact that the equity
positions held by the Master Fund were insignificant in comparison to the Master Fund’s overall

7

Notably, the dollar amounts of these equity positions taken by the Master Fund – which, according to Defendants,
ranged from $430,375 to $16,407,702 – all pale in comparison to the $925 million of total investor capital controlled
by the Fund as of March 31, 2007 (Def. Notice at ¶ 7 (citing Compl. ¶ 7).) They are even more minimal when one
takes into account that the Partnership had a beneficial interest in less than a third (28.58% as of December 31, 2006
(¶ 37)) of the Master Fund’s total net assets. Their insignificance is even clearer when compared to the $9.682
billion in gross long positions the Partnership had through March 31, 2007. ¶ 61 (emphasis added).

Case 1:07-cv-07783-AKH

Page 17 of 28

assets (which predominantly consisted of mortgage-backed instruments), these equities are
simply not implicated in Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claims.
Defendants rely upon the statement in the August 2006 PPM that the Fund “may invest in
. . . equity securities” and that “equity securities” appears on a laundry list of instruments that
could be used for “hedging purposes.” (Def. Notice ¶ 18; emphasis added (selectively excerpting
¶ 51)). Yet, there is no allegation that Defendants actually used any “equity positions” to hedge
any of the Partnership’s investments (much less investments with sub-prime exposure), and
Defendants do not contend that they did so. Indeed, to the extent that Defendants purportedly
hedged at all, “[t]hese hedges were concentrated in the triple-B and single-A tranches of the
ABX indices” (Feb. 28, 2007 Performance Profile; Entwistle Decl., Ex. 3) and/or were “through
the use of credit default swaps” (¶ 49). See also, e.g., ¶ 59 (quoting March 31, 2007
Performance Profile; Entwistle Decl., Ex. 4 (“our short positions rose in price as many investors
who were short the sub-prime credit default index covered their positions”) (emphasis added)).
Defendants cite no case law suggesting that the tangential and far-removed presence of a
“covered security” implicates SLUSA. Rather, Defendants incorrectly presume this to be the
law and selectively quote Kenneth Rothschild Trust v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 199 F. Supp.
2d 993, 1000 n.21 (C.D. Cal. 2002), for the dubious proposition that “[w]hen a claim concerns a
transaction that involves both covered and non-covered securities as alleged, the entire claim is
subject to removal under SLUSA.” (Def. Notice ¶ 19.) In distinct contrast to Plaintiff’s claims,
the covered securities in Kenneth Rothschild were at the heart of the claims there, as Morgan
Stanley “allegedly made misrepresentations concerning [] a money market mutual fund” (a
covered security). Id. at 999. Thus, that Court held plaintiff’s claims to be removable under
SLUSA, finding that “[t]he fact that plaintiff’s claims may tangentially relate to non-securities,

12

Case 1:07-cv-07783-AKH

Page 18 of 28

i.e., the certificates of deposit – does not alter this result.” Id. at 1000 n.21. This case, however,
presents the opposite situation: Plaintiff’s claims undeniably rest on non-covered securities (e.g.,
structured finance securities backed by sub-prime mortgages) and have, at best, only the most
attenuated relationship to “covered securities.”
The Second Circuit’s recent decision in Ring v. AXA Financial, Inc., 483 F.3d 95 (2d Cir.
2007) is instructive and supports remand here. There, the Court was presented with the question
of “whether a Children’s Term Rider (“CTR”) that is not by itself a ‘covered security’ becomes a
‘covered security’ and thus subject to SLUSA removal and dismissal because it is attached to a
variable life insurance policy falling within the definition of a ‘covered security.’” Id. at 96.
Holding that “we should not preempt and dismiss a suit that alleges fraud occurred in connection
only with a promise in a contract that does not relate to a ‘covered security’ even where another
promise in the same contract does concern a ‘covered security,’” the Second Circuit ordered the
case remanded to New York County Supreme Court. Id. at 101-02.
Moreover, SLUSA’s legislative history confirms that the Act was never intended to reach
claims where, as here, the litigation centers on non-covered securities, and there is only an
extremely tangential and tenuous relation to covered securities. In particular, the Senate Report,
in discussing SLUSA’s “purpose and scope,” explains that a motivating factor was:
the dangers of maintaining differing federal and state standards of
liability for nationally-traded securities [and that d]isparate, and
shifting, state litigation procedures may expose issuers to the
potential for significant liability that cannot easily be evaluated in
advance, or assessed when a statement is made.
S. Rep. 105-182, at 3 (1998) (emphasis added). Such concerns are plainly not implicated by this
case. No issuer of the nationally traded securities to which Defendants point is being sued, or is
at any risk of liability from this case. Rather, this case involves breaches of fiduciary duties, and

13

knowing participation in those breaches, in connection with structured finance securities backed
by sub-prime mortgages – which are indisputably not “covered securities.”
2.

No Misrepresentation Or Omission Is Alleged “In Connection With”
The Purchase Or Sale Of Any Covered Security

Defendants erroneously contend that “the Complaint’s alleged misrepresentations or
omissions of material fact are made ‘in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered
security,’” (Def. Notice at ¶ 16 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1))) because – they incorrectly state
– “[t]he Complaint [purportedly] alleges that the failures to disclose were made in connection
with the trading of equity securities in the Master Fund”. (Def. Notice at ¶ 16 (citing ¶¶ 34, 47,
49-53, 55).) Defendants, however, should not be permitted the luxury of attacking phantom
allegations found nowhere in the Complaint.
In fact, no misrepresentations or omissions are alleged in connection with any of the
Master Fund’s purchases or sales of equity securities. Moreover, Defendants’ misconduct is too
far removed from any of those transactions to be said to “coincide” with them. See Indiana
Electric Workers Pension Trust Fund v. Millard, No. 07 Civ. 172 (JGK), 2007 WL 2141697, at
*6 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2007) (“An alleged fraud is ‘in connection with’ a purchase or sale of
securities under SLUSA if the fraud ‘coincides’ with or is ‘more than tangentially related’ to the
transaction.”) (citations omitted).
Here, the only “purchase or sale of securities under SLUSA” to which Defendants point
is the Master Fund’s handful of purchases of equity securities. However, “[w]here the alleged
conduct giving rise to the claim is too far removed from a [covered] securities transaction, the ‘in
connection with’ requirement is not met.” LaSala v. UBS, AG, 06 Civ. 1736 (CSH), 2007 WL
2331054, at *24, 27 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2007) (“[B]ecause the conduct . . . in which the Bank is
implicated here is too far removed from a securities transaction to be said to have ‘coincided’

with it, Count 1 of the complaint [aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty] is not preempted
by SLUSA.”). See also, e.g., Strigliabotti v. Franklin Res., Inc., 398 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1100
(N.D. Ca. 2005) (“The fraud in question . . . must have more than some tangential relation to the
securities transaction.”) (citations omitted); French v. First Union Sec, Inc., 209 F. Supp. 2d 818,
824 (M.D. Tenn. 2002) (“[I]n order for a breach to be ‘in connection with’ securities sales, the
breach of the fiduciary duty must do more than simply implicate securities. Rather, there must
be a showing of a nexus between the fraud and a securities transaction.”) (citations omitted);
Gavin v. AT&T Corp., 464 F.3d 634, 639 (7th Cir. 2006) (“Of course there is a literal sense in
which anything that happens that would not have happened but for some prior event is connected
to that event. In that sense the fraud of which the plaintiff complains is connected to the merger,
without which there would not have been such a fraud against the plaintiff and her class. But in
the same sense the fraud is connected to the Big Bang, without which there would never have
been a MediaOne or even an AT&T.”).
The failures to disclose at issue simply have nothing to do with the handful of equity
positions taken by the Master Fund. Rather, the disclosure failures all go to the Management
Defendants’ mismanagement of the Partnership and their failure to adequately assess, monitor
and hedge the risks associated with non-covered instruments such as CDOs exposed to the subprime mortgage market. See, e.g., ¶¶ 2-4, 12, 39-49. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims are not “in
connection with” the purchase or sale of any covered security.8

Even if the Court were somehow to find that the Partnership Interests are “covered securities” and specifically
“equity securities” (though they plainly are neither), and that all the other substantive requirements for SLUSA
removal have been met (though, as explained herein, they have not), remand would still be required because
Plaintiff’s claims would then satisfy the conditions of SLUSA’s savings clause known as the “‘Delaware carve-out,’
which rescues certain ‘covered class actions’ based on the law of the issuer’s state of incorporation from SLUSA’s
preemptive sweep.” Ind. Elec. Workers Pension Trust Fund, 2007 WL 2141697, at *3 (citing 15 U.S.C. §
78bb(f)(3)(A)).

The Derivative Claims Are Not Preempted By SLUSA Because They
Do Not Sound In Fraud

The “requirements that must be satisfied for SLUSA preemption to apply are, under the
law of this Circuit, applied to each claim in the Complaint rather than to the whole action.”
LaSala v. UBS, AG, No. 06 Civ. 1736, 2007 WL 2331054, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2007). As
discussed above, SLUSA does not bar any of Plaintiff’s claims. In addition to the reasons set
forth above, Counts III and IV of the Complaint are not subject to SLUSA because these
derivative claims do not sound in fraud. Id.
Indeed, the derivative claims are not based at all on any misrepresentations or omissions;
rather, they are based on the Management Defendants’ “grossly negligent and/or bad faith failure
to adequately assess, monitor and hedge the credit risks of investments held by the Fund and the
Master Fund, and otherwise failing to manage the Fund with the requisite amount of due care.”
¶ 90; see also ¶¶ 98-99. “Because none of these claims sounds in fraud or contains fraudulent
conduct as a necessary component of the claim, none of them falls within SLUSA’s reach.”

Defendants’ Removal Finds No Support In The Policies Underlying
SLUSA

Congress enacted SLUSA with the goal of providing “uniform national rules for class
action litigation involving our national capital markets” by making federal courts the exclusive
venue for class actions alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection
with the purchase or sale of a covered security: “The purpose of SLUSA was to prevent
plaintiffs from making an end run around the restrictions on suits for federal securities fraud suits
introduced by the [PSLRA] by filing the suits in state courts under state law.” Gavin, 464 F.3d
at 640 (citing Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit, 126 S. Ct. 1503, 1510-11
(2006)). See also, e.g., Ring, 483 F.3d at 97.

This is not a securities fraud case, nor one that Plaintiff should have brought under the
federal securities acts. Resolution of this case does not depend upon whether Defendants
violated any securities law. Rather, this is a Delaware law breach of fiduciary duties case,
brought by a limited partner on behalf of a Delaware limited partnership and other limited
partners asserting claims against the general partner for breaching its fiduciary obligations in
managing the Partnership and failing to communicate fully and candidly with Plaintiff and other
limited partners.
Defendants’ removal arguments are unavailing in light of the plain language of SLUSA
and the policy bases pursuant to which SLUSA was enacted.
C.

CAFA Is Inapplicable

This case is not properly removable under CAFA. A plain reading of the Complaint
establishes that Plaintiff’s claims fall within the “fiduciary duties” exception to CAFA
jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(9)(C). Accordingly, remand is required.
1.

The Section 1332(d)(9)(C) Exception To CAFA Jurisdiction Applies

Even assuming the threshold requirements of CAFA are satisfied, this case falls within
the “fiduciary duties” exception to CAFA removal.9 CAFA provides an express exception to
federal subject matter jurisdiction over any class action that “solely involves” a claim
that relates to the rights, duties (including fiduciary duties), and
obligations relating to or created by or pursuant to any security
(as defined under section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933

9

Defendants cite Serrano v. 180 Connect, Inc., 478 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2007) for the proposition that Plaintiff has
the burden to prove the application of any express statutory exception to jurisdiction under CAFA. (Def. Notice
¶ 25.) Defendants’ reading of Serrano is too broad, as that court held only that the party objecting to removal had
the burden of proving the applicability of the §§ 1332(d)(4)(A) & (B) exceptions to CAFA removal. While this may
be the law in the Ninth Circuit, as of the date of this filing, the Second Circuit has not decided which party bears the
burden of proof on the statutory exceptions to CAFA. See Blockbuster, Inc. v. Galeno, 472 F.3d 53, 58 (2d Cir.
2006). Plaintiff does not concede that it has the burden of proof on this exception.

[“Securities Act”]) (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(1)) and the regulations
issued thereunder.
28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(9)(C) (emphasis added). Defendants do not (and cannot) dispute that the
Partnership Interests at issue here constitute “securities” under the Securities Act.10
The only claims asserted in the Complaint are for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and
abetting breach of fiduciary duty under Delaware law. See ¶¶ 68-102. These claims all relate to
and are made pursuant to Plaintiff’s ownership of its Partnership Interests. Accordingly, all
claims in the Complaint plainly “relat[e] to” fiduciary duties owed to Plaintiff by virtue of its
ownership interest in the Partnership as required under section 1332(d)(9)(C).11
Breach of fiduciary duty claims like those presented here are precisely what section
1332(d)(9)(C) was designed to exempt from removal under CAFA. See, e.g., In re Textainer
P’ship Sec. Litig., No. C 05-0969 (MMC), 2005 WL 1791559, at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. July 27, 2005)
(remanding under section 1332(d)(9)(C) plaintiff’s class action breach of fiduciary duty claim
based on ownership of limited partnership interests); Carmona v. Bryant, No. CV-06-78-S-BLW,
2006 WL 1043987, at *3 (D. Idaho Apr. 19, 2006) (remanding shareholder’s Delaware breach of
fiduciary duty claim on grounds that “plain language of [section 1332(d)(9)(C)] covers” such a
case); Genton v. Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc., No. 06-CV-2517-BEN (WMC), 2007 WL
951838, *2 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 9, 2007) (“The plain language of the statute, by adding ‘including
fiduciary duties’ in parentheses . . . shows a clear intent to cover fiduciary duty claims in addition
10

See Def. Notice ¶¶ 36-37; see also, e.g., Estate of Pew v. Cardarelli, No. 5:05-CV-1317, 2006 WL 3524488, at
*5 n.3 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2006). Of course, the definition of a “security” under CAFA has no bearing upon whether
a claim involves a “covered security” under SLUSA.
11

The Complaint here is plainly distinguishable from the complaint considered by the court in Davis v. Chase Bank,
U.S.A., N.A, 453 F. Supp. 2d 1205 (C.D. Cal. 2006) cited by Defendants. In Davis, the court found that section
1332(d)(9)(C) did not apply because the credit card agreements at issue were not securities, and the complaint
asserted claims for breaches of certain California consumer protection statutes. Id. at 1209. Plaintiff here brings
only state law breach and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claims arising from the Partnership Interests,
which are the very claims explicitly exempted from CAFA under section 1332(d)(9)(C).

fiduciary duty and related state law claims against indenture trustee subject to section

(M.D. Tenn. Aug. 8, 2005) (finding breach of fiduciary duty and related claims under Delaware
law were exempt from CAFA removal under section 1332(d)(9)(C)). The same result is required
here.
Defendants erroneously read the section 1332(d)(9)(C) exception as being limited to
“disputes regarding the terms of a security,” or the “formative documents” establishing those
terms. (Def. Notice ¶¶ 36-37.)12 No such limitation is found in the express language of the
statutory provision, nor can one be drawn from the legislative history.13 The plain language of
section 1332(d)(9)(C) specifically encompasses claims based on fiduciary duties which “relate
to,” are “created by,” or are made “pursuant to” a security under the Securities Act. Under any
common sense reading, such broad language includes fiduciary duties not only created by the
terms of a particular security and the documents under which it was issued, but also fiduciary

12

In addition to being contrary to CAFA’s plain language, Defendants’ proposed interpretation would lead to a
perverse circumstance in which it would be appropriate for a state court to determine whether a security creates a
fiduciary duty but that only a federal court could decide whether such duties were properly discharged.

13

Defendants erroneously suggest that the Senate Committee Report on CAFA limits the application of section
1332(d)(9)(C) to only those cases concerning the meaning or scope of a particular security’s terms. (Def. Notice
¶ 36). This argument is inapt since, as discussed herein, the plain language of the statute and the cases interpreting it
contradict the cited committee report language. In such circumstances, the committee report cannot override the
express language of the statute. See, e.g., Blockbuster, 472 F.3d at 57 (rejecting Senate Committee Report language
shifting burden of proof for CAFA jurisdiction to plaintiff given absence of such language in statute itself).

duties which arise pursuant to ownership of the security, or that otherwise relate to such
security.14
Even the case cited by Defendants on this point, Estate of Pew v. Cardarelli, No. 5:05CV-1317, 2006 WL 3524488 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2006), directly rejected the same formalistic
argument Defendants make here. The Defendants in Pew asserted that the section 1332(d)(9)(C)
exception should apply only “‘to those claims that relate to the rights arising out of the security
itself or the rights that a corporation’s . . . organizational documents confer[] on a holder of the
corporation’s securities.’” Id. at *5. In rejecting this “restrictive reading” of the statute, the
court held that
[i]n referring to rights, duties and obligations ‘relating to’ a
security, as well as those ‘created by or pursuant to’ a security,
section 1332(d)(9)(C) covers not only rights, duties and obligations
conferred by the terms of the security itself, such as voting rights,
but also those rights, duties and obligations that are connected with
the security.
Id. The court’s reasoning in Pew applies with equal force to Plaintiff’s claims here. See also
Carmona, 2006 WL 1043987, at *2 (finding terms “relating to” and “pursuant to any security” in
1332(d)(9)(C) serve to “broaden subsection (C)’s applicability beyond those cases where the
duty is ‘created by’ the [terms of the] security”).
Both a plain reading of section 1332(d)(9)(C) and the cases interpreting it compel
remand.

14

In any event, Defendants’ suggestion that fiduciary duties are created only by the terms of a security or its
formative documents ignores well-settled law to the contrary. See Boxer v. Husky Oil Co., 429 A.2d 995 (Del Ch.
1981) (general partner owes fiduciary duty to limited partners under common law and provisions of Delaware
Uniform Partnership Act and Uniform Limited Partnership Act); see also 6 Del. Code Ann. § 15-404 (defining
general partner’s fiduciary duties to partnership and other partners), § 15-405 (providing for derivative claim against
partnership or partner to enforce fiduciary duties).

The Section 1332(d)(3) And (d)(4) Exceptions To CAFA Jurisdiction
Potentially Apply

The exceptions to CAFA jurisdiction found in 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(3) (the “interests of
justice” exception), and § 1332(d)(4) (the “local controversy”/”home-state controversy”
exceptions) potentially apply here.15 Both statutory exceptions to CAFA jurisdiction require a
determination of the proposed class members’ citizenship. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(3) (granting
court discretion to decline CAFA jurisdiction when more than one-third but less than two-thirds
of proposed plaintiff class members are citizens of forum State), § 1332(d)(4) (requiring court to
decline CAFA jurisdiction where more than two-thirds of plaintiff class members are citizens of
forum State). For purposes of these CAFA exceptions, the statute states that “[c]itizenship of the
members of the proposed plaintiff classes shall be determined as of the date of filing of the
complaint.” 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(7) (emphasis added).
The Declaration of Rajan Govidan offered by Defendants contains a “sampling” of the
States of residence of all investors who held Partnership interests as of August 1, 2006,
December 31, 2006, and April 30, 2007. (Def. Notice, Ex. D.) This “sampling” indicates that
approximately 26 percent of the proposed Class were New York residents at some point during
the Class Period. Although this substantial percentage falls just short of the one-third threshold
needed to invoke the § 1332(d)(3) discretionary exception, Defendants have not provided the
citizenship statistics of the proposed Class members as of August 6, 2007, the date when the
Complaint was filed. Moreover, by merely sampling the citizenship of Partnership investors as
of certain dates, the Govidan Declaration fails to accurately account for the citizenship of

15

As noted in footnote 9 above, as of the date of this filing, the Second Circuit has not decided which party bears
the burden on proof on the statutory exceptions to CAFA. By raising the argument above, Plaintiff does not concede
that it has the burden of proving these exceptions, but is merely responding to Defendants’ contention that these
exceptions do not apply. (Def. Notice ¶ 27.)

investors who may have redeemed their Interests before the Partnership collapsed. Such Class
members would not necessarily be reflected on the “sampling” dates chosen by Mr. Govidan, but
would still be members of the proposed Class.
The “sampling” of information that Defendants have elected to provide does not rule out
application of these express exceptions to CAFA jurisdiction. Accordingly, while Plaintiff
contends that section 1332(d)(9)(C) requires remand (see supra C.1), should the Court determine
that CAFA removal is warranted, Plaintiff reserves the right to seek leave to take limited
jurisdictional discovery to determine the applicability of sections 1332(d)(3) and (d)(4).16
II.

PLAINTIFF SHOULD BE AWARDED COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES
RESULTING FROM DEFENDANTS’ IMPROPER REMOVAL
This Court has the discretion to award costs and attorney fees incurred from improper

removal. See Morgan Guar. Trust Co. v. Republic of Palau, 971 F.2d 917, 924 (2d Cir. 1992)
(28 U.S.C. 1447(c) “affords a great deal of discretion and flexibility to the district courts in
fashioning awards of costs and fees”). Such expenses and fees may be awarded absent a finding
of bad faith. Id. at 923.
An award of fees and expenses is appropriate here. Defendants’ improper removal has
subjected Plaintiff to unnecessary expense, forcing it to appear in federal court, as well as
research and prepare a motion to remand, merely to get this action returned to the court where it
originally filed the Complaint. See Circle Indus. USA v. Parke Constr. Group, Inc., 183 F.3d
105 (2d Cir. 1999) (providing for attorneys’ fees when granting a motion to remand serves the
purpose of deterring improper removal).

16

Given that Defendants bear the burden of proving that all the prerequisites for CAFA jurisdiction have been
satisfied, but have not offered any evidence as to the size of the proposed Class – despite their ready ability to do so,
see Govidan Declaration ¶ 1 – Plaintiff also reserves the right to seek leave to take limited jurisdictional discovery
on this issue as well. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(d)(2) & (d)(5).
