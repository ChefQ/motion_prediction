IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS

TAMARA BERRY, ET AL.,
Plaintiffs,
v.

No. 13-457C

THE UNITED STATES,

(Judge Lettow)

Defendant.

PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO TRANSFER
The Plaintiffs, by and through their undersigned counsel, hereby file this Response in
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Transfer. Plaintiffs further highlight two recent decisions in
this Court denying identical Motions. In support thereof, Plaintiffs state as follows:

Background
On July 5, 2013, Plaintiffs filed the above captioned Complaint. The Complaint was filed
on behalf of the Plaintiffs and all similarly situated individuals who are current or were
previously employed by the United States Department of Homeland Security as Immigration
Officers ("IOs”) in the GS-1801 Series or Intelligence Research Specialists (“IRSs”) in the GS312 Series. The Complaint alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).
On September 5, 2013, the Defendant filed a Motion to Transfer the Complaint to the
United States District Court for the District of Nebraska alleging that this Court does not possess
subject matter jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims. Plaintiffs now file this Response in
Opposition.

ARGUMENT AND ANALYSIS
I.

The Defendant’s Motion should be denied because the FLSA provides for
jurisdiction in this Court as decided in two recent decisions by this Court.

In two recent decisions by this Court, identical Motions to Transfer have been denied.
The first to be decided, King v. United States, No. 12-175C (Fed. Cl. Aug. 30, 2013), like the
case herein, involved a Complaint covering multiple employees who alleged that their employing
Agency failed to pay overtime compensation due to them under the Fair Labor Standards Act
(“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. (2012). On July 30, 2013, the Defendant in that matter filed a
Motion to Transfer, based upon the decision in United States v. Bormes, 133 S. Ct. 12 (2012)
(“Bormes”). In Bormes, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff could not import the waiver of
sovereign immunity found in the Little Tucker Act to pursue a Fair Credit Reporting Act
(“FCRA”) claim against the federal government. Bormes, 133 S. Ct. at 15. The Supreme Court
held that “[w]here, as in FCRA, a statute contains its own self-executing remedial scheme, we
look only to that statute to determine whether Congress intended to subject the United States to
damages liability.” Id. at 17. The Government in King, as did the Defendant herein, based its
Motion to Transfer on the fact that the FLSA has a self-executing remedial scheme, and per 28
U.S.C. § 1631, that “whenever a civil action is filed in a court . . . and that court finds that there
is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action . . . to
any other such court in which the action . . . could have been brought at the time it was filed . . .”
The King Plaintiffs opposed the Motion by arguing that the Supreme Court’s holding in
Bormes did not introduce a new jurisdictional bar to the FLSA claims in the Court of Federal
Claims (“COFC”) because the sovereign immunity of the United States has already been waived
per the FLSA, and the terms of the FLSA allow the case to be heard in the COFC. After
considering the Agency’s Motion and Plaintiffs’ Response in Opposition, Judge Nancy Firestone

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 6 Filed 10/02/13 Page 3 of 7

denied the Government’s Motion for several reasons discussed below. Based on review of that
Decision, and the reasoning addressed herein, the Agency’s Motion should be denied because the
COFC maintains jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims.
The King Defendant and Defendant herein read Bormes to mandate that the COFC’s
jurisdiction under the Tucker Act is available only where the Tucker Act provides both the
waiver of sovereign immunity and the jurisdictional grant in the COFC. According to the
Defendants, a statute that provides its own waiver of sovereign immunity necessarily displaces
the COFC from hearing claims against the federal government arising under that statute,
regardless of the forum provided for in the statutory text. But the Defendants’ reading of Bormes
is overly broad. As Judge Firestone noted, the “…government’s reading of Bormes goes too far
and improperly conflates the issue of sovereign immunity waiver with the issue of proper forum
in every case involving a detailed remedial federal statute.” King Order, p.5-6. The issue
decided in Bormes was that the Tucker Act could not replace FCRA’s “detailed remedial
scheme” to provide a waiver of sovereign immunity by the federal government. Bormes, 133 S.
Ct. at 15. The Bormes Court determined that because Congress had created a comprehensive
remedial scheme under FCRA, only the terms of FCRA itself could provide a waiver of
sovereign immunity by the United States. Id. at 19. Contrary to the Defendants’ position,
however, the Supreme Court did not then hold that any statute containing a “detailed remedial
scheme” necessarily eliminates the COFC from hearing cases under that scheme; rather, the
terms of the detailed remedial statute itself govern. Based on this analysis of Bormes, this Court
concluded that where a statute with a comprehensive remedial scheme provides for its own
waiver of sovereign immunity independent of the Tucker Act, that statute can still provide for
jurisdiction in the COFC through application of the Tucker Act, if Congress so intended under

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 6 Filed 10/02/13 Page 4 of 7

the terms of the statute. King Order, p.6. Thusly, Bormes did not eliminate the COFC’s
jurisdiction to hear cases arising under the FLSA. Whether the COFC is a forum with jurisdiction
to hear a case where sovereign immunity has already been waived is a separate question that
turns on whether the statute identifies a different forum or precludes the COFC as a proper forum
for relief.
The proper analysis herein, therefore, turns on two issues: 1) whether the FLSA contains
an express waiver of sovereign immunity, and if so, 2) whether the FLSA allows for claims to be
heard in the COFC. With regard to the first issue, this Court already determined that the FLSA
contains an express waiver of sovereign immunity per El-Sheikh v. United States, 177 F.3d 1321,
1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999), in which the Federal Circuit held that the 1974 amendments to the FLSA
expanded the definition of “employee” and when read together with the private right of action
found in 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), provided an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity authorizing
federal employees to sue the United States as an employer. El-Sheikh, 177 F.3d at 1323-24. The
FLSA, therefore, in stark contrast to the FCRA addressed in Bormes, unquestionably provided a
waiver for sovereign immunity.
With regard to the second issue, this Court already determined that the FLSA does
provide for jurisdiction in the COFC based on the broad statutory provision which does not vest
any specific court with jurisdiction to hear FLSA cases. The reasoning is clear. The FLSA
provides statutory jurisdiction in “any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.” 29
U.S.C. § 216(b) (emphasis added). As such, a government employee may sue in the COFC,
which is plainly a federal court of “competent jurisdiction” to hear claims for monetary relief
against the United States, especially as herein, where the individual FLSA claims exceed

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 6 Filed 10/02/13 Page 5 of 7

$10,000, in which case the COFC not only has jurisdiction over the claims but has exclusive
jurisdiction per the Tucker Act.
In King, this Court noted that this holding, per the FLSA, is distinguishable from the one
in Foster v. United States, where this Court applied Bormes to deny jurisdiction where the statute
at issue therein provided for “original jurisdiction” in “[t]he district courts of the United States.”
Foster, 111 Fed. Cl. 658, 662-63 (2013). The Court held that the statutory provision there
displaced this Court’s Tucker Act jurisdiction. Id. But the holding here is different precisely
because the FLSA does not specifically provide for jurisdiction in the district courts, or in any
specific court. This Court also pointed out that this issue was examined in detail in Brooks v.
Weinberger, 637 F. Supp. 22 (D.D.C. 1986), where the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia, concluded that the FLSA, which does not expressly mention federal district
court jurisdiction, must be read to allow for jurisdiction in the COFC by virtue of the Tucker Act.
637 F. Supp. at 24. Thus, the terms of the FLSA itself do not limit jurisdiction to the federal
district courts or bar this Court’s jurisdiction to hear FLSA claims against the federal
government. Rather, the FLSA’s broad forum provision provides for cases to be heard in any
court of competent jurisdiction and the COFC has long been recognized by the Federal Circuit
and other circuit courts of appeals as the exclusive “federal court” with jurisdiction to hear FLSA
claims by federal employees in excess of $10,000 under the provisions of the Tucker Act. Id.;
Saraco v. United States, 61 F.3d 863, 865-66 (Fed. Cir. 1995). As the King Court noted, the
Federal Circuit’s decision in Saraco v. United States is particularly instructive, where it was held
that “the issue in this case is not whether governmental immunity from suit has been waived, for
it explicitly has been. The issue is only in which federal court the authorized suit may be
brought.” Id. at 865-66. In addressing the appropriate forum, the Federal Circuit Court affirmed

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 6 Filed 10/02/13 Page 6 of 7

its decision in Zumerling v. Devine, 769 F.2d at 749, which held that, “the FLSA contained the
requisite waiver of sovereign immunity [for suits against the federal government]; but only the
Tucker Act provided jurisdiction of suits to enforce that right.” Saraco, 61 F.3d at 685. Under
Zumerling and Saraco, the Federal Circuit and other circuit courts of appeals have continued to
hold that the COFC is a court of “competent jurisdiction” for suits by federal employees under
the FLSA, consistent with the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional grant. See El-Sheikh, 177 F.3d at 1323;
Waters v. Rumsfeld, 320 F.3d 265, 272 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Parker v. King, 935 F.2d 1174, 1177-78
(11th Cir. 1991). In this regard, the use of the Tucker Act as a basis for this court’s jurisdiction to
hear FLSA claims is not an impermissible “mix[ing] and match[ing]” of the provisions of the
FLSA and the Tucker Act. Bormes, 133 S. Ct. at 19. Unlike in Bormes, the Tucker Act is not
simply tacked onto the FLSA, regardless of the terms of the FLSA, to provide for jurisdiction in
this court. Rather, the Tucker Act properly fills a “gap” created by the FLSA’s own statutory text
based on the broad grant of jurisdiction to any court of competent jurisdiction. See Bormes, 133
S. Ct. at 18. Because nothing in Bormes mandates a rejection of this long-settled precedent, this
Court should find that it has jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ FLSA claims in this case.
In the second case decided by this Court, Frost v. United States, No. 13-50C, Judge
Thomas Wheeler agreed with the recent decision in King, and ruled that Bormes does not prevent
this Court from exercising jurisdiction over claims brought against the Government pursuant to
the FLSA because the terms of the FLSA (1) contain a waiver of sovereign immunity
independent of the Tucker Act and (2) provide for jurisdiction in this Court. King, slip op. at 6,
8. As noted in Frost, the facts of this case that bear on the determination of this Motion are
identical to those of King. As in King, Plaintiffs herein sought to invoke the jurisdiction of this
Court over a claim against the Government for the payment of overtime compensation pursuant

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 6 Filed 10/02/13 Page 7 of 7

to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. (2012). Here, as in King, the
Government has argued that the jurisdiction of this Court over such a claim is precluded by
Bormes. As this Court did in King and Frost, and based on the arguments and analysis addressed
above, the Defendant’s Motion must be denied.

Conclusion
Based upon the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Defendant’s
Motion to Transfer be denied. The FLSA provides for waiver of sovereign immunity and this
Court has jurisdiction over the subject case pursuant to the FLSA and Tucker Act.

Respectfully submitted,

October 2, 2013
