No. 13-457C
Judge C. Lettow

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO TRANSFER
Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims
defendant, the United States, respectfully requests that the Court transfer plaintiffs’ complaint to
the United Stated District Court for the District of Nebraska because this Court does not possess
subject matter jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs’ complaint. Counsel for plaintiffs has indicated
that plaintiffs oppose this request.
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE
Whether this Court possesses jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., because that Act imposes monetary
liability and has its own judicial remedies and, thus, the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, is
displaced as a source of jurisdiction.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Plaintiffs are past or present employees of the United States Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), and are currently or were previously employed as Immigration Officers (IOs) in
the GS-1801 Series, or Intelligence Research Specialists (IRSs) in the GS-312 Series. 1 Compl.

These facts are taken from the allegations in the plaintiffs’ complaint. Nothing in this
motion, including but not limited to this recitation of the Statement of the Case, should be
interpreted as an admission of any such allegations. If the Court were to deny this motion, we

“Parties” ¶ 2. The complaint alleges that plaintiffs, and other similarly situated employees, were
designated as non-exempt from the FLSA as of February 12, 2012. Compl. “Parties” ¶ 4. The
complaint also alleges that there were no changes to the duties of their positions prior to or
subsequent to this change in exemption status. Compl. “Parties” ¶ 7. The complaint alleges that
plaintiffs and other similarly situated employees were not compensated at a rate of not less than
one and one half times their regular rate for hours worked in excess of the hourly standards as
mandated by the FLSA, and seek compensation under the FLSA for time spent in discharge of
their job duties. Compl. “Cause of Action” ¶¶ 11-15. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on July 5,
2013, and assert that this Court has jurisdiction “pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 201, et. seq., 29 U.S.C.
§ 216, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1337.” Compl. “Jurisdiction and Venue” ¶ 1.
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
This Court does not possess jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the
FLSA. The Tucker Act, the only possible source of this Court’s jurisdiction in this case, was
created to provide a remedy when statutes impose monetary liability upon the United States but
do not themselves provide remedies. When a law imposing monetary liability contains its own
judicial remedies, however, the Tucker Act does not apply. United States v. Bormes, 133 S. Ct.
12 (2012), and cases cited therein.
The FLSA establishes liability, a cause of action, a measure of damages, and an
applicable statute of limitations. Moreover, it expressly authorizes judicial review. Because the
FLSA provides the accoutrements of a judicial action, the liability that Congress intended to
create can be determined from only the text of the FLSA, and the Tucker Act is displaced. As a
result, this Court does not possess jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs’ claims.

reserve the right to contest each factual allegation in the complaint. See, e.g., M. Snower & Co.
v. United States, 140 F.2d 367, 370 (7th Cir. 1944).

ARGUMENT
I.

Standard of Review
“Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold matter that must be determined at the outset of

a case.” King v. United States, 81 Fed. Cl. 766, 768 (2008) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a
Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95 (1998); PODS, Inc. v. Porta Stor, Inc., 484 F.3d 1359, 1365
(Fed. Cir. 2007)). When deciding a motion to dismiss based upon lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, “the allegations of the complaint must be construed favorably to the plaintiff.”
Hamlet v. United States, 873 F.2d 1414, 1416 (Fed.Cir.1989). Nonetheless, plaintiff bears the
burden of establishing jurisdiction. Taylor v. United States, 303 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir.
2002); Reynolds v. Army & Air Force Exch. Serv., 846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed. Cir. 1988)).
“Determination of jurisdiction starts with the complaint, which must be well-pleaded in that it
must state the necessary elements of the plaintiff's claim, independent of any defense that may be
interposed.” Holley v. United States, 124 F.3d 1462, 1465 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing Franchise Tax
Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1 (1983)).
The United States is immune from suit unless it has specifically waived sovereign
immunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976); United States v. Sherwood, 312
U.S. 584, 586 (1941). “Waivers of the Government’s sovereign immunity, to be effective, must
be unequivocally expressed” and “consent to be sued must be construed strictly in favor of the
sovereign and not enlarge[d] . . . beyond what the language requires.” United States v. Nordic
Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33-34 (1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A
waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be “unequivocally expressed.” INS v.
St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 299 n. 10 (2001).
II.

This Court Does Not Possess Jurisdiction To Entertain Plaintiffs’ FLSA Claims
In the present action, plaintiffs cite two statutes in support of their assertion that this

3

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 5 Filed 09/05/13 Page 4 of 9

Court has jurisdiction over this case – 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which grants district courts “original
jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United
States,” and 28 U.S.C. § 1337, which grants district courts jurisdiction over any action arising
under a federal law “regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints
and monopolies.” Neither statute confers subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims upon
this Court. This Court has expressly held in the past that “[p]laintiff erred when claiming federal
question jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, grants this court jurisdiction. The Court of
Federal Claims does not possess federal question jurisdiction.” Hernandez v. United States, 38
Fed. Cl. 532, 537 (Fed. Cl. 1997). The Court has also held that antitrust claims governed by 28
U.S.C. § 1337 “are outside this Court’s purview and, therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction to
hear any matter under [that statute].” Wade v. United States, 08-385C, 2008 WL 4056331 (Fed.
Cl. Aug. 6, 2008), aff’d, 321 F. App’x 940 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Accordingly, neither 28 U.S.C.
§ 1331 nor 28 U.S.C. § 1337 confer jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims upon this Court.
Nor is there any other federal statute that confers jurisdiction upon this Court to entertain
plaintiffs’ complaint. Like its predecessor, the United States Court of Claims, this is a Court of
limited jurisdiction. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953, 47 L.Ed.2d
114 (1975). The central provision granting consent to suit in this Court is the Tucker Act, 28
U.S.C. § 1491. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. at 397; Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. United
States, 228 Ct. Cl. 146, 151, 655 F.2d 1047, 1051 (1981). In United States v. Bormes, 133 S. Ct.
12 (2012), however, the Court confirms that, when a statute imposing monetary liability against
the United States contains its own self-executing remedial scheme, the Tucker Act does not
apply. Because the FLSA satisfies these criteria, this Court does not possess jurisdiction to

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 5 Filed 09/05/13 Page 5 of 9

entertain plaintiffs’ claims. 2
The United States Court of Claims was established pursuant to the Act of 1855 in order to
provide a judicial forum for certain monetary claims against the United States for which there
were no other avenues of judicial enforcement. See Act of Feb. 24, 1855 (1855 Act), ch. 122,
§ 1, 10 Stat. 612 (1855). It was created, in other words, to fill a gap. It was not designed to
replace or to provide an alternative to an avenue of judicial enforcement provided in another
statute.
Like its predecessors (the Act of 1855 and its successors), the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.
§ 1491, establishes jurisdiction in this Court for actions against the United States for certain
monetary claims not otherwise judicially enforceable. The Tucker Act’s jurisdictional grant, and
accompanying immunity waiver, supplied the missing ingredient for an action against the United
States for the breach of certain monetary obligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.
Bormes, 133 S. Ct. at 18. The Tucker Act does not replace or provide an alternative to a judicial
remedy established in another statute. When a law imposing monetary liability on the United
States contains its own judicial remedies, the Tucker Act is inapplicable. Id.
Bormes was a putative class action against the United States premised upon the Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Plaintiff sued in the district court for damages under 15 U.S.C.
§ 1681n(a), and invoked the court’s jurisdiction under the jurisdiction provision for FCRA
actions, 15 U.S.C. § 1681p, as well as the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). The district
court dismissed for failure to state a claim, holding that the FCRA did not contain a waiver of
sovereign immunity. The Little Tucker Act was not addressed.
Plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit based
2

In Abbey v. United States, Fed Cir. No. 2013-5009, the unavailability of Tucker Act
jurisdiction in FLSA cases has been raised, along with other issues, before the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit.
5

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 5 Filed 09/05/13 Page 6 of 9

upon that court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(2) over appeals from cases in which
jurisdiction was based in whole or in part upon the Little Tucker Act. The Government
requested to transfer the appeal to the Seventh Circuit, because the Little Tucker Act’s
jurisdictional grant did not apply to the case. The court of appeals denied the transfer motion and
vacated the district court’s decision, holding that the Little Tucker Act provided the
Government’s consent to suit for violation of the FCRA. The court of appeals reasoned that,
because the FCRA could “‘fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal
Government for the damage sustained,’” it fell within the waiver of sovereign immunity
contained in the Little Tucker Act. Bormes v. United States, 626 F.3d 574, 578 (Fed. Cir. 2010)
(quoting United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, 472 (2003)).
The Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit’s decision. The Court reviewed the
history and purpose of the Tucker Act and Little Tucker Act and concluded that the Tucker Act’s
jurisdictional grant and accompanying immunity waiver were enacted to supply the missing
ingredient for an action against the United States for the breach of certain monetary obligations
not otherwise judicially enforceable. The Court further explained:
The Tucker Act is displaced, however, when a law assertedly
imposing monetary liability on the United States contains its own
judicial remedies. In that event, the specific remedial scheme
establishes the exclusive framework for the liability Congress
created under the statute. Because a precisely drawn, detailed
statute pre-empts more general remedies, FCRA’s self-executing
remedial scheme supersedes the gap-filling role of the Tucker Act.
Bormes, 133 S. Ct. at 18 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
The Court then applied this principle to the case before it:
FCRA creates a detailed remedial scheme. Its provisions set out a
carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific cause of
action, and also precisely define the appropriate forum. It
authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold ‘any person’ who willfully
or negligent[ly] fails to comply with the Act’s requirements liable

6

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 5 Filed 09/05/13 Page 7 of 9

for specified damages. Claims to enforce liability must be brought
within a specified limitations period, § 1681p, and jurisdiction
will lie in any appropriate United States district court, without
regard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court of
competent jurisdiction. Without resort to the Tucker Act, FCRA
enables claimants to pursue in court the monetary relief
contemplated by the statute.
Id. at 19 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
This case involves claims based upon the FLSA, not the FCRA. Like the FCRA, the
FLSA establishes a detailed remedial scheme. Both the FCRA and the FLSA authorize liability
for specific monetary damages. The FCRA authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any
person” liable for specified damages, 15 U.S.C. § 1681n. Similarly, the FLSA provides for
employees to hold “[a]ny employer” liable for unpaid wages, minimum wage, or overtime wages
due to the employee. 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
Both statutes limit the period during which a suit may be brought. The FCRA requires
that claims to enforce liability must be brought within two years of plaintiffs’ discovery of the
violation or five years of the date of the violation, 15 U.S.C. § 1681p. The FLSA requires that
claims to enforce liability must be brought within two years, except if the violation is willful, in
which case the claim must be brought within three years. 29 U.S.C. § 255(a). Both statutes also
provide for the payment of attorney fees. 15 U.S.C. § 1681n(a)(3); 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
Finally, both statutes explicitly authorize a judicial avenue of review. The FCRA
provides that suit may be brought in “in any appropriate district court . . . or in any other court of
competent jurisdiction.” 15 U.S.C. § 1681p. The FLSA provides that suit may be brought “in
any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
Thus, like the FCRA, the FLSA imposes monetary liability and contains its own judicial
remedies. The reasoning in Bormes dictates, therefore, that there is no “gap” for the Tucker Act
to fill and that the Tucker Act is unavailable as a source of jurisdiction for FLSA suits.
7

Case 1:13-cv-00457-EDK Document 5 Filed 09/05/13 Page 8 of 9

The Federal Circuit and other circuit courts of appeal have long permitted FLSA suits to
be brought against the United States, primarily in this Court, pursuant to the Tucker Act. See
Saraco v. United States, 61 F.3d 863, 865-66 (Fed. Cir. 1995); Parker v. King, 935 F.2d 1174,
1177-78 (11th Cir. 1991); Zumerling v. Devine, 769 F.2d 745, 748-49 (Fed. Cir. 1985); Graham
v. Henegar, 640 F.2d 732, 733-36 (5th Cir. 1981). In Zumerling, the court explained:
29 U.S.C. § 216(b) authorizes Fair Labor Standards Act suits in
any Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction, but the words
“of competent jurisdiction” tell us that the words do not stand
alone but require one to look elsewhere to find out what court, if
any, has jurisdiction. Zumerling, 769 F.2d at 749 (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted). See also Saraco, 61 F.3d
at 865.
Although the jurisdictional provision of the FLSA, unlike the FCRA, does not
specifically name the district court or any other particular court as the appropriate forum for
suits, it nevertheless defines a “self-executing remedial scheme” that provides a complete remedy
“[w]ithout resort to the Tucker Act.” Bormes, 133 S. Ct. at 18-19.
The cause of action that the FLSA creates against employer defendants, both
governmental and non-governmental, fits naturally within district courts’ general Federalquestion jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The cause of action is, thus, fully available
irrespective of the existence of the Tucker Act, and the Tucker Act is accordingly displaced.
Because the Tucker Act is not available as a source of jurisdiction for plaintiffs’ complaint, this
Court does not possess jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs’ claims.
III.

Transfer
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631, “[w]henever a civil action is filed in a court ... and that

court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice,
transfer such action ... to any other such court in which the action ... could have been brought at
the time it was filed.” See Jan’s Helicopter Serv. v. FAA, 525 F.3d 1299, 1303-04

(Fed.Cir.2008); Rodriguez v. United States, 862 F.2d 1558, 1559-60 (Fed. Cir. 1988). At the
time it was filed, plaintiffs’ complaint could have been brought in the United States District
Court for the District of Nebraska, where a majority of the named plaintiffs in this action reside.
Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Court transfer plaintiffs’ complaint to that court.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, we respectfully request the Court to determine that it does not possess
jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs’ complaint and to transfer it to the district court.
