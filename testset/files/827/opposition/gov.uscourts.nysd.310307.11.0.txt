Case 1:07-cv-06597-AKH Document11 Filed 08/27/2007 Page 6 of 21

Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., formerly known as Enron Corp. ("Enron" or
"Appellant"), respectfully submits this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion
to Dismiss Appeal ("Motion") filed by Caisse de Depet.et placement du Quebec
("Caisse") and National Australia Bank (""NAB," and with Caisse, "Appellees").

IL
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The Appellees urge this Court to dismiss as untimely Enron's appeal of the
Bankruptcy Court's judgment dismissing Enron's claims against them. The Motion is
premised upon Enron's "failure" to appeal from earlier orders entered in June and August
2006, which, as a matter of law, were unappealable. Specifically, Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 54, applicable here pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7054
("Rule 54"), and the case law construing those rules, make clear that appeals properly lie
only from the final judgment disposing of an action -- in this case entered on June 18,
2007 -- and do not lie from orders or judgments dismissing only some of multiple claims
and some of multiple defendants in a single ongoing action absent an express certification
that never occurred in this case.

This is not even a close case because traditional federal policy against piecemeal
appeals from partial judgments is rigorously enforced in the Second Circuit. That policy
is subject to exception under Rule 54(b) "only upon an express determination that there is
no just cause for delay." FED.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (emphasis added). No Rule 54(b)
determination was made in this case in connection with the entry of the August 2006
partial judgment dismissing Caisse and NAB from the adversary proceeding. That alone
should end the matter, as the requirement of express language is of obvious import in
clearly delineating for the parties the very limited circumstances when an immediate
appeal of a partial judgment is necessary and when it is not. 10 Wright, Miller & Kane,
FED. PRAC. & PROC. CIVIL 3D, 0x00A7 2660 ("Although it is somewhat unclear what form the

certification under Rule 54(b) should take, both the court's direction and determination

 
Case 1:07-cv-06597-AKH Document11 Filed 08/27/2007 Page 7 of 21

must be apparent and there should no doubt as to the district court's intention to certify.
A strong policy in favor of certainty as to the district court's intention to give its decision
final judgment status underlies the rule's procedure.").

In this case, Appellees never sought a Rule 54 determination in the Bankruptcy
Court nor did they ever allege that there was "some danger of hardship or injustice
through delay which would be alleviated through immediate appeal." Citizens Accord,
Inc. v. Town of Rochester, 235 F.3d 126, 129 (2d Cir. 2000). Even now, they do not
contend that this is "the infrequent harsh case," id, in which such conditions were
present. Instead, they argue that this case "present[s] a fact pattern without precedent,"
Motion, page 1, in which this Court should divine "judicial intent [to] establish that Judge
Gonzalez intended the [2006 partial] Judgment as final." Jd, page 2. That divination
purportedly arises from two facts: (i) the Bankruptcy Court's deletion of Rule 54(b)
language from a proposed judgment submitted by other defendants, Motion, page 6 & n.
5, a deletion which was unnecessary as to Appellees as such language was never part of
any order or judgment they submitted; and (ii) the Bankruptcy Court's recitation in the
order granting the Appellees' 12(b)(6) motions that "this order shall take effect
immediately upon its entry." Motion, page 7. As we discuss below, these facts, if
relevant at all, argue against the Motion.

Not only is divination inappropriate in general, it is completely unnecessary to
interpret rulings by Judge Gonzalez, as he knows how to make clear, and does make
clear, when he believes certification is appropriate and when it is not. For example, in
another adversary proceeding, also arising out of the Enron bankruptcy case, decided in
April 2006, Judge Gonzalez not only denied certification but explained why he does not
lightly certify partial judgments under Rule 54(b). Dorsey v. Enron Corp. (In re Enron
Corp.), 2006 WL 1030413, at *5-6 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. April 10, 2006) (denying Rule
54(b) certification because the standards for Rule 54(b) certification are "stringent in this

Circuit," and must "be reserved for those rare cases where there exists some danger of

 
Case 1:07-cv-06597-AKH Document11 Filed 08/27/2007 Page 8 of 21

hardship or injustice through delay which would be alleviated by immediate appeal.").
By contrast, where Judge Gonzalez has certified an otherwise interlocutory ruling under
Rule 54(b), he has done so in strict compliance with the Rule's requirements. See RMM
Records & Video Corp. v. Universal Music & Video Distrib. Co. (In re RMM Records &
Video Corp.), 2007 WL 1630493, at *11-13 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2007).

Neither Rule 54(b) language nor its rationale was present here -- and this is no
surprise as Appellees made no attempt to obtain certification. Instead, Appellees seek to
create a post hoc amorphous exception to the final judgment rule! that would render the
express finding requirement of Rule 54(b) a nullity. Not only would this be unwarranted
in this case, it would spawn confusion in the future, leading to improper and unnecessary
protective appeals of interlocutory orders and partial judgments in derogation of the
policies of judicial economy, clarity and finality embodied in the final judgment rule and
Rule 54. As the Supreme Court noted in its leading decision interpreting Rule 54 in its
current form, the history of Rule 54 itself illustrates such an amorphous exception is
unworkable and was rejected by the drafters in amending the Rule to require an express
determination. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 433-34, 76 S.Ct. 895,
100 L.Ed. 1297 (1956). Accordingly, there is no basis for Appellees' claim that Enron's
notice of appeal, following entry of final judgment on June 18, 2007, is untimely.

Appellees' speculation regarding how and why Enron determined to file this
appeal is unsupported and irrelevant. The only relevant point is that Enron timely filed

its notice of appeal. Enron's timing in perfecting its appeal here was not only

 

For a description of the rule, see, e.g., Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489
U.S. 794, 798, 109 S. Ct. 1494, 103 L. Ed. 2d 879 (1989) ("In the Judiciary Act of
1789, ... the First Congress established the principle that only final judgments and
decrees of the federal district courts may be reviewed on appeal.... The statute has
changed little since then.... For purposes of this provision, a final judgment is
normally deemed not to have occurred until there has been a decision by the District
Court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but
execute the judgment.") (internal quotes and citations omitted).

 
Case 1:07-cv-06597-AKH Document11 Filed 08/27/2007 Page 9 of 21

procedurally proper, but compelled by the applicable rules and authorities; as such, the
Motion should be denied.
Il.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

As the motion to dismiss before the Court revolves entirely around the procedural
issue of the timeliness of the filing of Enron's notice of appeal, Appellant offers a highly
abbreviated Statement of Facts that focuses on the procedural issue before the Court
rather than the merits of the appeal and the complex securitization structure and related
transactions that are at issue in connection with those merits.

On December 2, 2001, Enron (and thereafter various affiliates) filed voluntary
petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On July 15, 2004, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an Order confirming the Debtors' Supplemental Modified Fifth
Amended Joint Plan of Affiliated Debtors in the underlying Chapter 11 cases. The Plan
became effective on November 17, 2004. Shimshak Decl., Exh. 14, page 2.

Prior to plan confirmation, Enron commenced this adversary proceeding by filing
a complaint (the "Complaint"). Shimshak Decl., Exh. 1. The Complaint sought to avoid
and recover certain transfers made to and for the benefit of Caisse and NAB, as well as
fourteen other unaffiliated financial institutions, as fraudulent transfers pursuant to
sections 548 and 550 of the Bankruptcy Code. Jd. 0x00A70x00A7 5-25. More specifically, Enron 0x00B0
sought to avoid three different sets of pre-bankruptcy cash transfers to or for the benefit
of the sixteen named defendants each of whom had held some portion of approximately

$300 million in so-called CLO' notes issued in December 1999 on behalf of an Enron

 

"CLO" is an acronym for "collateralized loan obligation." The Enron affiliate that
originally owned the underlying obligations being securitized was Enron North
America Corp. ("ENA"). Through a complex securitization structure ENA
transferred and pooled these obligations in Enron affiliated partnerships which in turn
assumed obligations to a trust (the CLO Trust) formed for the purpose of issuing

 
Case 1:07-cv-06597-AKH Document11 Filed 08/27/2007 Page 10 of 21

affiliate: (i) the "May 2001 Transfers" totaling approximately $99 million which involved
the repurchase of the defendants' non-recourse CLO notes at par plus accrued interest,
even though the value of the collateral supporting those notes was known to be
insufficient to repay them in full, id. |0x00A7f 37-41; (ii) the "January 2001 Put Payment" of
approximately $63 million which involved Enron's agreement to repurchase part of the
collateral pool supporting the non-recourse CLO notes at face value, even though the
repurchased assets were known to be in default and with a fair value far less than their
face amount, id. J] 47-48; and (iii) the "June 2001 Put Payments" of approximately $50
million which likewise involved Enron's agreement to repurchase part of the collateral
pool supporting the non-recourse CLO notes at face value, even though the repurchased
assets were known to be in default and with a fair value far less than their face amount.
Id. {0x00A7 49-50. The Complaint alleged that these transfers took place at a time when Enron
was insolvent or undercapitalized, that Enron did not receive reasonably equivalent value
in exchange, and that Caisse and NAB were indirect or subsequent transferees (as
distinguished from initial transferees) of the January 2001 Put Payments and the June
2001 Put Payments. Id. J] 47-56.

Caisse and NAB moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to FED.R.CIv.P.
12(b)(6). Shimshak Decl., Exh. 8 & 9. Appellees' motions to dismiss centered around
the legal question presented in this appeal: Whether the legal representative of a
bankruptcy estate that has timely filed suit against a subsequent transferee to avoid and
recover a fraudulent transfer, but that has not sued the initial transferee, states a claim

upon which relief can be granted.

 

notes secured by the CLO assets to various institutional investors including Caisse
and NAB. The independent examiner appointed in the Enron Chapter 11 cases issued
a report concluding, among other things, that Enron could avoid and recover several
transactions or transfers pertaining to the CLO Trust. Shimshak Decl., Exh. 1, 0x00A7 4.
