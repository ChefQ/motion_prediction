Caisse de Dkp8t et placement du Quebec ("Caisse") and National

Australia Bank ("NAB," and, together with Caisse, the "Appellees") respectfully submit
this melnoi-andum of law in support of their motion to dismiss the above-captioned

appeal pursuant to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 81302 and SO1 1, and Federal

Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) (made applicable to this proceeding by Federal Rule of
Banlcmptcy Procedure 7054(a)) ("Rule 54").
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This appeal arises from the dismissal with prejudice under Federal Rule of
Bankruptcy Procedure ("Bankruptcy Rule") 701 2(h) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

12(b)(6)of an adversary proceeding brought by Erlrotl Creditors Recovery Corp.

(formerly known as EIWOH
Corp.) (CLEnrot~")
against the Appellees and others. Appellees
move to dismiss this appeal as untimely. Enroll filed its notice of appeal after nearly ten
months of total inactivity in the underlying adversary proceeding and nearly ten months

after the entry of a final judgment (the "Judffment") under Rule 54 in Appellees' hvor.
Enron has suggested in its Notice of Appeal dated June 22, 2007 that,

based on Second Circuit precedents, it could riot appeal from the Judgment as a matter of
right by fling a notice of appeal on or before the August 2 1,2006 deadline to appeal.
Without saying so, Enron appears to maintain that the variance of the Judgment's form
from the letter of Rule 54 rettdered the Judgrnent interlocutory. not final, and this relieved
Enron of the need to appeal.
The matter, of course, is not that simple. The procedural posture of

Enron's appeal and the procedural posture of the underlying adversary proceeding both in
August 2006 and June 2007 present a fact pattei-n withclut precedent in this Circuit and

thus this motion involl~esa matter of first impression. The decisions in this Circuit and

elsewhere establish that finahty under Rule 54 in a case like this does not depend

invariably, as Enron apparently contends, on the inclusion of "magic words" and written
reasons for those words, but rather on a determination of judicial intent based on the state

of the record when the Bankruptcy Clerk entered the judgment. The evident facts and
circumstances establish that Judge Gonzalez intended the Judgment as final.
Whether Enron made an initial determination not to appeal the Judgment

despite i t s finality, or whether Enron's new counsel has decided "no thing ventured,
nothing gained" in revisiting a decision that Enron made ten months ago, matters little.

Enron allowed the ten-day appeal period to lapse following entry of the Judgment. The
Judgment is final and non-appealable, and this Court should dismiss Enron's appeal.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
The Collateralized Loan Oblieation Transaction
Thj s litigation results from Enron's structured financing activities. In or
about December 1 999, Enron and two other entities, Emon North America Cop.

("'ENA")and LJM2, entered into a transaction known as a "collateralized loan
obligation," or "m,"
to securitize a portfolio of loan facihties (the "CLO Assets")

owned by ENA a 1 ~ other
1
affiliates of Enron. Enron caused LJM2 to establish a trust,
ENA CLO I Trust (the "CLO Trust"), which issued several series of notes to third parties
(the "CLO Notes"). (Complaint (defined below) 7 24, attached as Exhibit 1 In the
Declaration of Stephen J. Shimshali ("Shimshak D d " )swonl to on August 1,2007)

("Compl.").) To enslire timely interest and other payments on the CLO Notes, Enron
separately formed three other entities as pal? of the CLO t~+nnsaution
structure: ENA

CLO I Holding Company GP L.L.C. ("Holding GP"), ENA CLO I Holding Company I

Page 7 of 22

L.P. ("Holding I LP"), and ENA CLO I Holding Company I1 L.P. (Id. 7 27.) Holding

GP served as the general partner of both limited partnerships. (Id.) The CLO Trust
served as the sole limited partner of Holding 1 LP. (Id 7 29.)
After establishitlg these entities, Enron caused ENA and other Enron

afiliates to transfer the CLO Assets to Holding I LP. (id.7 228. ) These assets enabled the

CLO Trust, through distributions received as the sole limited partner, to make payments

to holders of the CLO Notes. (Id. 730.) All of the defendants in above-captioned
adversary proceeding, including the Appellees, held CLO Notes. (id.7 3 1.)

Decline in The Value of the CLO Assets
Some nine months after the baasfer of the CLO Assets to Holding I LP,

the market value of the CLO Assets began to decline. (Id. 7 -72.) In response, on or about
September 1,2000, Enron granted a put option (the "Put Option") to Holding 1 LP that
enabled Holding I LP to require Enron tn purchase ir~terestsin the CLO Assets in an

amount up to $1 13 million. (Id.)
Between September 2000 and Ayi+il2001,the decline in the market value
of the CLO Assets continued, and the underlying obligors of the collateralized loans

included in the CLO Assets failed to make payments sufficient to cover the CLO Trust's
obligations on the CLO Notes. (Id. 7 34.) On or about December 29, 2000, Holding 1 LP

exercised its rights under the Put Option, and on or about January 12,2001, Eru.o~~
paid
$63,109.023.64 to Holding I LP (Id 7 47), which, jn turn, distributed this amount to the

CEO Trust, as limited partner. (Id. 133.) The CLO Trust then trmsfirt-ed these funds to

certain holders of CLO Notes in or around January 2001 and June 2001 (the "Put
Transfers"), including the Appellees. (Id,f 47, S O . )

In spring 2001, Enron purcl~asedthe then-outstanding CLO Notes from
certain defendants at face value, plus accn~cdinterest. (d.
7 35,) To do so, Enron made

certain transfers by wire to Chase Manhattan Bank ("Chase"), as indenture trustee for the
benefit of holders of CLO Notes. (Id. 1137-40.) On the same dates as those transfers,
Chase made transfers (the "May Transfe-")

to certain of the Defendants other than the

Appellees, and, in exchange, those Defendants transferred their CLO Notes to Enroll or
ENA. (Id.)

The Adversa]? Proceeding

In November 2003, Enron filed a complaint seeking to recover frorn
sixteen defendants, including the Appellees, payments made in respect of the CLO Notes
(the "Complaint"). In Count I of the Coiplajat, Enron sought to avoid and recover the

May Transfers from ten of the Defendants (die "hitial Transferees") as constructive
fraudulent trarlsfers pursuant to sections 548(a)(l)(B) and 550(a)(l) of the Bankruptcy
Code. (Id. 17 36-45.)I11 Count 11, Enron sought to recover the Put Transfers from the

Appellees and frorn other defendants as alleged mediate transferees of Enron (the
"Subsequent Transferees"). (Id, m46-56.) Enron sought to recover the Put Transfers as

constructive kaudulent transfers, pursuant to section 550(a)(2) of the Ba~lki-uptcyCode.

(Id.) Finally, in Count 111, Enron sought to disallow any claims of the defendants on the

basis that the defendants held property recoverable by Enron under section 550 of the
Bankruptcy Code as alleged in Counts I and 11. (Id. 77 57-6 1 .)

Initial Dismissals
Withi11 a few months of filing the Complajnt, in the first quarter of 2004,

Enron filed stipulations voluntarily dismissing the Complaint against two of the Initial
Transferees and orle of the Subsequent Transferees. (ShirnsIlak Decl., Exs. 2, 3 .)I

Motions to Dismiss
Over the next nine months, Z~etweenMay 2004 and January 2005, seven of

the eight remaining Initial Transferees and one of the five remaining Subsequent
Transferees filed motions to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim, on the
grounds that the safe harbor for "settlementpayments" provided by section 54G(e) of the

Bankruptcy Code barred Enmn from avoiding and recovering the subject transfers.2
(Shimshrk Decl., Exs. 4, 5 , 6 , 7 . )
In August 2004 and June 2005, Caisse and NAB, two of the five

remaining Subsequent Transferees, each separately moved to dismiss the Conxplaint for

failure to state a claim because Enron could not establish the elements o f a claim for

recovery under section 550 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Shimshak Decl.. Exs. 8,9.) More
specifically, Enron could not recover from the Appellees because Enrotl had neither
avoided the initial transfer nor sued the initial transferee.

The Clerk of the Bankruptcy Comt had entered a default judgment against one of the
Initial Transferees, Protective Life; the parties subsequently set aside the default by
"so ordered stipulation," which enabled Protective Life to file a motion to dismiss.
The Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court had entered a default judgment against NAB in
November 2004; the parties subsequently set aside the default by "so ordered"
stipulation, which permitted NAB to file its motjorl to dismiss.

By opinion dated May 2,2006 (the ''546Ce) Oninion") (Shimshak Decl.,

Ex. 101, Bankruptcy Court Judge Gonzalez granted the motions to dismiss filed by five of
the Initial Transferees and one Subsequent Transferee, reducing the number of remaining
defendants to five.' In the 546(e) Opinion, the Bankruptcy Court held that sectio~l516(e)
of the B a u h p t c y Code protected the suhject transfers from avoidance by Enron. (546(e)
Op- pp. 458-59.) On June 15,2006, the Bankruptcy Court entered a corresponding order

that dismissed all counts in the Complaint against tbese six defendants with prejudice,

and directed the clerk to enter a final judgment pursuant to Bankniptcy Rule 7054(b) and
Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) dismissing the adversary proceeding as to them with prejudice (the
"546(e')Order"). ( Shimshak Decl., Ex. 1 I .) The form of that Order proposed to Judge

Gonzalez on May 2,2004, contained a "Whereas" recital "that there is no just reason for
delay" in the entry of judgment in the proceeding with respect to the moving defendants.

(Shimshak Decl., Ex. 12.) Juclge Gonznlez deleted that recital from the form of the order
that he entered. (546(e) Order.) The clerk entered a judgment on Aug~st9,2006.

(Shimshak Decl., Ex. 13 .)
Though the 546(e) Opinioil and f o m ~of proposed order preceded the

opinion on Appellees' motion to dismiss, the entry of the correspondii~gorder and
judgment did n o t . h y opinion dated May 18,2006 (the "550 Opinion") (Shimshak

After filing motions to dismiss, but before issuance ofthe 546(e) Opinion, two Initial
Transferees entered into settlements with Enron; thus, the Cornplaiilt was dismissed
against each before issuance of this opinjon.

Enron may contend that the deletion of the language in the 546(e) Order, submitted
before, but entered after, the 550 Order, soinellow reflects the Bankruptcy Court's
view that the 550 Order did riot constitute a final order within the meaning of Rule
54. In fact, the docket just as readily supports the opposite conclusion -- that the
Bankruptcy Court detex-rninedcorrectly that there was no firlality when it received the

Decl., Ex. 141, the Bankmptcy Court granted the Appellees' motions to dismiss. In the

550 Opinion, Judge Gonzalez reasoned that section 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code
required that Enron first establish the initial transfers as improper and avoided (which

Enron failed to do) before it could recover such transfers from the Appellees. (550 Op.
p. 84.)

On June 5,2006, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the "550 Order")

in accordance with the 550 Opinion, (Shirnshak Decl., Ex. 1 5 .) Rather than addressing
Rule 54's timing element in the negative ("no just reason for delay"), the 550 Order
(unlike the 546(e) Order) expressed the same thought in the affirmative (". . . this order
shall take effect im~nediatelyupon its entry"). (550 Order 7 3 .) It also directed the

Bankruptcy Clerk to enter final judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7054 and Fed. R.
Bankr. P. 902 1 di stnissing the adversary proceeding as to Caisse and NAB with
prejudice. (Id, 7 4.) The Bankruptcy Clerk entered the Judgment on August 9,2006.

(Shimshak Decl., Ex. 1 6.) Therefore, on Aubust 2 1,2006, ten days after the Bankt-uptcy

Clerk entered the Judgment, the 550 Order became final and non-appealable.
New Counsel and the Remaining Defendants
In November 2004, the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court entered a default

judgment against CDC Investment Management COT.("CDC"), a Subsequent

Transferee, and, in December of that year, the Bankruptcy C o u ~entered
t
an order

proposed 546(e) order because it had not yet entered the 550 Opinion. That the
Harlkruptcy Court docketed the 546(e) Order after the 550 Order suggests nothing
more tbm an internal administrative delay. This Court should dl-aw its conclusions
from the actual posture of the case at the time of the 550 Order 'and Judgment.

granting default judgment against CDC in a specified dollar amount. (Shimshak Decl.,
Exs. 17, 1 8 . 1 ~
In June 2005, Berkeley Capital Management, LLC ("Berkeley"), the only

Initial Transferee that had not either been dismissed or filed a mu tion to dismiss as of that

time, filed an answer to the Complaint. (Shimshak Decl., Ex. 19,) In its answer,

Berkeley asserted several affirmative defenses, including the defense provided by the safe

harbor pl-ovision for settlement payments under section 54B(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.
(Shimshak Decl., Ex. 19, p,9.)
This was, then, the procedural posture of the adversary proceeding as of
August 9,2006. F'or all intents and purposes, for the nine months following entry of the

Judgment on August 9,3006, nothing happened in the adversary proceeding. Beginning
in April, 2007, a series of seemingly interrelated events took place. In April, 2007,
several attorneys from the law firm of Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff & Stern LLP

C"m

Tuchin"), moved for admission to practice,pro hac vice, before the Bankruptcy Court to
represent Enron in the adversary proceeding. (Shimshak Decl., Ex. 20.)
On June 14,2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered two "so ordered"
stipulations that (i) simultaneously vacated the default judgment against CDC and
dismissed the adversary proceeding against CDC. with prejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P.

41 (a)(l )(ii); and (ii) dis~nissedthe adversary proceeding against Berkeley with prejudice
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(l)(ii). ( S himshak Decl., Exs. 2 1 ,22.) On that same date,
Enron filed a notice of djsr~~issal
of action, dismissing the adversary proceeding against

the Complaint nor appear in the case. However, nothing happened with respect to AP

Four days later, the clerk of the Bankruptcy Court entered a judgment

respect to [Berkeley] and [CDC]." (Shimshak Decl., Ex.24.)
On June 19,2007, Enton substituted its counsel thoughout the adversary

proceeding, Togut, Segal & Segal LLP ("Towt"), with new counsel, Venable LLP
("Venable"). (Shirnshak Decl., Ex.25.) Veilable rlow serves with [<leeTuchii-r as co-

counsel to Enron.
On June 22,2007, Enron filed its notice of appeal (the "Notice of

Appeal") from the 550 Opinion, 550 Order and Judgment of the B a n h ~ p t c yCourt,

nearly ten months after the entry of the Judgment. (Shirnshak Decl,, Ex. 26.)
ARGUMENT
This Court Should Dismiss Enron's Appeal as Untimely

The disposition of this imution tur-11son whether the Judgment entered by
the Bankruptcy Court on August 9,2006 was final under Rule 54.7If it was, then Enron
had to file a notice of appeal by August 2 1 , 2006 (which i t did not do), and it cannot

Rule 54@) provides:

When more than one claim for relief is presented in an
action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or
third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the
court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or
more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon
an express determination that there is no just reason for
delay and upon an express direction for the etdry of
judgment. In the absence of such deteimination and
direction, any order or other form of decision, however
designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or
the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall
not tei-tninate the action as to any of the claims or parties.
and the order or other f o m of decisicln is subject to
revision at any time before the entry of judgment
adjudicating all the claims and d ~ rizhts

m d liabilities of
all the patties.
The purpose of Rule 54 is straigl~thnvard:to avoid d ~ denial
e
of justice through delay in
the context of a multi-party litigation; before Rule 54, courts jl-rcreasingly needed to await
adjudication of all claims before rendering appealable a judgment on a distinctly separate

claim, due to the liberalization of the joinder and intervention provisions in the federal
rules. Advisory Committee Note of 1946; Sears. Roebuck d Co. v. M a c k ~ y3, 5 1 U,S.

posture of the adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order pursuant to
Bankruptcy Rule 7054 and Rule 54, dismissing the action with prejudice as to the

Appellees. The Bu~kruptcyCourt's order. did not recite the words that "there is no just
reason for delay," found in Rule 54. It made that determination using different words

with the same meaning, stating that j ts order shall "take effect immediately," and

Awwlication of Rule 54 Within the Second Circuit
Was the Judgment tinal? The answer to that question 011these unique
facts lies in the precedents it1 this Circuit and elsewhere concernillg Rule 54. As

den~onstratedbelow, the answer to that question is "Yes.''
Unlike the situation here. the Second Circuit has generally applied Rule 54
strictly in the context of a party's attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeals prematurely, not belatedly. HBE Lcnsitzg Corp, v. Frank, 48 F.3d 623,Gj 1

159 B.R. 396,400 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) ("The law of this Circuit, however requircs, 'strict

The rigid applicatiorl of Rule 54 is not invariable, howevcr. Wheri the

underlying recol-d demonstrates finality. the Second Circuit has displayed flexibility and
does not insist y o n an express determination of "no just reason for delay."

St. Paul is illustrative. In St. Paul, PepsiCo, Tnc. ("PepsiCo") moved for

entry of judgment pursuant to Rule 54. See id. at 692. In granting PepsiCo's motion, the

district court gave no reasons for its action and si~nplywrote the words "motion granted
so ordered" and signed the cover of the notice of motion submitted to the court. Id. at

693. The district court issued no opinion whatsoever on the matter nor did it adopt any

reasons for the decision. See id. While displeased with the district court's failure to use

the words "no just reason for delay" or to supply any reasons for granting the motion
under Rule 54@), the Second Circuit, upon examination of the record, f o n d the reasons

for the district court's actions readily apparent. id. In granting PepsiCo's motion, the
District Court disposed of PepsiCo' s "entire clairn for indemnity [and] finally

deterrnine[dJ a distinct and separable part of the suit." Id. Thus, based on the record, the
court had effectively deemed that there was no just reason for delay. Spc id.at 694.

lo

The record before the Bankruptcy Court clearly demonstrated the finality of the
proceedings -- in substance, the 546(e) and the 550 Opinions granting the tnot ions to
dismiss together resolved all claims against all remaining defendanis, even if they did

its etltry." The effect of both directing an immediately effective dismissal with prejudice
and entry of a final order negates any intention on Judge Gonzalez's part to reserve his

prerogative to revise the order or other forrn of decision before the entry of final
judgment against the remairljng defendants, Berkeley and CDC" -- both of which had the

benefit of the 550 Opii~ionand the 546(e) Opinion. Why afier all would he choose to
resave that pl-erogative'! The combined effect of the two Opinions, as shown by Enron's

subsequent conduct, disposed of the case, leaving nothing more to adjudicate.
In its Notice of Appeal, Enron states that "[tlhe opinion, order and
judgment listed as Docket Nos. 132, 1 37 and 140 became appealable as final only upon
entry of the orders and judgmemi t [Docket Nos. 153. 1 54 and 1 561 disposing of the

remaining claims against the remaining deferidants," and, as noted above, cites two cases
in support of this proposition -- LTCI Steel Co. v. United Mine Workers ofArneuic~r(In re

matters -- are distinguishable and do not support Enron's contention that the Judgment

was not final as of August 2 1, 2006.
not t echnjcally dismiss the three remaining non-moving defkndants. These
defendants only "remained" in the adversary proceeding in the technical sense that an
order had not been entered specifically dismissing such defendants; however, upon
entry of the 546(e) and the 550 Opinions, each had the j~l~mediate
advantage of one or
both of these opinions.
I'

AP Funding, a defendant and Subsequent Transferee, did not appear in the adversary
proceeding. While the Court had not dismissed the adversary pi-oceeding against AP
Funding as of entry of the 550 Opinion, it, too, had the halefit of the decision. On
June 12,2307, Enron filed a notice of dismissal of action dismissing the adversary
proceeding agninst AP Funding with prejudice.

Chateaugay invol ?red an appeal from a partial summary judgment in favor

of LTV. Cha~eaugrryat 57. In its opinion, the Second Circuit focused on the wellunderstood proposition that "[ajn order granting a partial summary judgment is
interlocutory." Id. (citing Liberty Muhkal Ins. Cu. v, Pvedel, 424 U.S. 737,742-43
(1 976); 9 J, Moose, R. Ward & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice 7 1 2 0.08 [ 1] (1 990));

see also Delta, 1 59 B. R. at 400 (an order partially granting a motion to dismiss
considered interlocutory). As distinct from an order granting partial summary judgment,
dismissal of the only claim against a defendant collveys full finality. See I.l-'itchardv.
MontefioreItfedical Cenfcr,2006 WL 2773870. at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26,2006)

("Dismissal with prejudice as a result of a successful motion to dismiss is usually

considered a final adjudication on the merits."). Unlike with a partial sumrnory judgment,
nothing remains to continue. That was the very circumstance here,

Enron's reliance on Delta is also misplaced. Delta involved a
consolidated appeal from an order that both granted a motion to disnljss third-party

claims and counterclaims as to individual members of a creditors committee and denied
the motion to dismiss as to the creditors cornrnittee itself in two separate adversary
proceedings. The other causes of action in the underlying adversary proceeding remained
pending. After reaching its decision on the motion to dismiss, the bankruptcy court had

the option to choose between two proposed orders -- one containing a citation to Rule 54
and one without. The bankruptcy court entered the order without the reference to Rule
51. Because the bankruptcy court partially granted the motion to dismiss, the district
court analogized the situation to Chatecrugay: "[nzlore specifically, the Second Circuit
has held that an order granting partial sumlnary judgment disposing of 0111 y one of two

not appealable as a

final order abserlt compliance rvi th Rule 54(b)." Id. at 400 (citing Chnteaugay, 922 F.2d
at 90-91 .) Unlike the circumstances in Delta, Judge Gonzalez, for the obvious reasons

identified above, directed that his order of dismissal wit11 prejudice take immediate effect

and directed entry of a final judgment.

A final note: while Enron in its June 22, 2007 Notice of Appeal insists
that it could only proceed with an appeal at that time, its conduct of the adversary
proceeding after August 2006 supports precisely the opposite conclusion -- that Enron

regarded the adversary proceeding as over, save for tying up some procedural, not

substantive, loose-ends.
Consider the subsequent record. Following entry of the Judgment on
August 9,2006, nothing at all happened in the adversary proceeding until April of 2007,

when the Klee Tuchin attorneys moved for admission to practice. pro /lac vice, before the

Bankruptcy Court. (Shimshak Decl., Ex. 20.) I'
The next event occurred on June 14,2007, when by a "so ordered"
stipulation and order, Enron vacated the default judgment agail~stCDC and dismissed the
adversary proceeding as against CDC. (Shimshak Decl., Ex. 2 1.) That very day, also by

"so ordered" stipulation and ordel; Enron dismissed the adversary proceeding as against
Berkeley (Shimshak Decl., Ex. 22), and, by r~oticeof dismissal, dismissed the adversary

In August and September, 2006, Enron filed three documents that related to the Iarger
insolver~cyproceedings in the Enron chapter 1 1 cases. These filings are not specific
to the adversary proceeding and are unrelated to the subject-matter of this
memorandum.

proceeding as against AP Funding (Shimshak Decl., Ex.23). On June 19,2007, Emon

substituted Togut with new counsel, Venable -- now co-counsel with Klee Tuchin. Three
days later, Enron filed the Notice of Appeal.

Enron Identifies these three docket items -- 1 5 3 , 154, and 156 -- as the

equivalent to "entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities
of all the parties," in other words, a final judgment. See Craig C . Reilly, 22 No. 2 LITIG

43,43,1?.rterlocutowO).ders:Getlirig D Xigh r The Second Time (Winter, 1996) (under
Rule 54(b), "at1 order that adjudicates 'all the claims and the rights and listbillties of all
the parties' would be 'final"'). These acts prove the npposi te proposition. See Kalan v.
Chase Manhattan Bank, N . i I . , 9 1 F.3d 3 85, 3 88 (2d Cir. 1996) (finality, for purposes of

the application of Rule 54(b), is "defined as a judgment which ends the litigation on the
merits and leaves nothing for the cout-t to do but execute the judgment") (citing Acha v.
B ~ n m e570
, F.2d 57,62 (2d Cir. 1978)). They amoulit to nothing more than long

overdue, and perfunctorily-perfomled tasks to clean up n docket resolved with finality
under the 550 and 546(e) Opinions months earlier.
None of these actions were the by-product of any litigating in the case.
They confirm the obvious: that this appeal involves nothing more tlinn the second

guessing of Enron's earlier decision not to appeal the Judgment as final.
