MEMORANDUM OF LAW OF DEFENDANTS JENNIFER S.WILKOV
AND EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGIC PLANNING, INC. IN SUPPORT
OF THEIR MOTION TO STAY THESE PROCEEDINGS PENDING
RESOLUTION OF A PENDING CRIMINAL CASE INVOLVING THE SAME
FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, PEOPLE AND INVESTMENTS AS THIS CASE
This memorandum of law is respectfully submitted on behalf of Defendants
Jennifer S. Wilkov ("Ms. Wilkov") and Evolutionary Strategic Planning, Inc. ("ESP"), a
corporation wholly owned and operated by Ms. Wilkov, in support of their motion to stay
these civil proceedings against them pending resolution of an ongoing criminal case filed
in New York County by the Manhattan District Attorney and captioned People v. Carla
Zimbailist, et al., Indictment No. 2765/2007.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

On or about June 26, 2007, a New York State Grand Jury, sitting in New York
County, issued a felony indictment against Ms. Wilkov and two of the co-defendants in this
action, Carla Zimbalist and Pam Chanla. The indictment accuses Ms. Wilkov of
participating in a Scheme to Defraud in the First Degree and violating the anti-fraud

provisions of New York's Martin Act. The allegations contained in the criminal indictment

mirror those set forth in Plaintiffs' Complaint almost 100% because the civil complaint arises
Case 1:07-cv-06272-AKH Document12_ Filed 09/14/2007 Page 5 of 14

out of the same series of transactions. The motion to stay has been made because a stay

is necessary to avoid prejudice to Ms. Wilkov and her Fifth Amendment rights if she is

forced to defend this action. Accordingly, for the reasons set out more fully below, in the

interests of justice, these proceedings should be stayed until the criminal matter is resolved.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The Criminal Proceedings

On or about June 26, 2007, a Grand Jury sitting in New York County returned
an indictment against Jennifer Wilkov and two other individuals, Carla Zimbalist, Pam
Chanla a.k.a. Sayasith Khammanivong. The indictment is attached as Exhibit A to the
Declaration of Thomas M. Campbell, dated September 14, 2007 ("Campbell Decl."). After
the indictment was issued, the District Attorney's Office brought a civil forfeiture action
against Ms. Wilkov and obtained an interim order of attachment. The Verified Complaint,
the Supporting Affidavit of Danie! Frooks, sworn to June 22, 2007, and the interim order of
attachment filed in the forfeiture action, are attached as Exhibits D, E, and F to the
Campbell Declaration.

The indictment accuses Ms. Wilkov of violating Penal Law Section
190.65(1)(b), Scheme to Defraud in the First Degree, General Business Law 352-(c){5) and
General Business Law Section 352-(c)(6). The latter statutes, part of New York's Martin
Act, prohibit schemes to defraud in conjunction with the purchase and sale of securities.
All of these charges are felonies. Ms. Wilkov, along with her codefendants Zimbalist and
Chanla, is accused of engaging in a scheme to defraud by promoting investments in real

properties that Zimbalist and Chanla were purportedly going to purchase, renovate and
Case 1:07-cv-06272-AKH Document12_ Filed 09/14/2007 Page 6 of 14

resell.' The investors were supposed to be repaid their investment plus a profit once the
properties were sold. Campbell Decl. Ex. D, Jf 8-9. According to the government, the
properties were not purchased or renovated. Instead the invested funds were used to pay
off existing judgments and personal expenses of Zimbalist and Chanla and to remunerate
Ms. Wilkov. Campbell Decl. Ex. D, 710. Ms. Wilkov is also alleged to have used her
position as a financial advisor with American Express Financial Advisors ("AEFA") to induce
individuals to invest in the fraudulent scheme. Campbell Decl. Ex. E, 6.

The indictment lists 27 individual victims of the alleged fraud. Twenty-four of
these individuals are named Plaintiffs in the Complaint in this action. According to the
government, the amount allegedly lost by the victims is $1,663,334. Campbell Dect. Ex. D,
q 11.

On Sepiember 7, 2007, Ms. Wilkov moved to dismiss the indictment on
(among other reasons) the ground that the prosecution did not recognize that Ms. Wilkov
and her family were also victims of Zimbalist and Chanla's investment scam. Acopy of the
Notice of Motion to dismiss the indictment is attached as Exhibit C to the Campbell
Declaration. The motion is scheduled to by heard by Justice Wittner on December 6, 2007.

The civil forfeiture action brought by the government is still pending. A
restraining order is in place that has frozen approximately $200,000, representing
essentially 100% of Ms. Wilkov's assets. Campbell Decl. 97 and Ex. F.

The Civil Complaint

The Complaint in this Action has been brought by essentially the same group

 

lZimbalist and Chanla also were charged with multiple counts of Grand Larceny. Ms. Wilkov has
not been charged with even a single count of Grand Larceny.

3
Case 1:07-cv-06272-AKH Document12 Filed 09/14/2007 Page 7 of 14

of individuals who are listed as victims in the indictment? Filed two weeks after the
indictment was issued, the Complaint mirrors the allegations made by the government in
ihe criminal proceeding in that it asserts that the plaintiffs were induced to invest a
fraudulent real estate scheme originated by Zimbalist and Chanla. Complaint J 2. Like the
government, Plaintiffs assert that Zimbalist and Chanla sought investments for the
purchase, renovation and sale of properties that were never actually purchased, renovated
or sold. Complaint J 14. The Complaint also alleges that Zimbalist and Chania utilized Ms.
Wilkov and her status as an advisor with American Express Financial Advisors, Inc.
("AEFA") to promote the scheme and that Ms. Wilkov was paid a commission by Zimbalist
and Chanla. Complaint J 9, 11. Plaintiffs also allege that Ms. Wilkov failed to exercise due
diligence to investigate the credentials of Zimbalist and Chanla or the legitimacy of the real
estate investments. Complaint J] 13, 15. Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc., the
successor in interest to AEFA, Ms. Wilkov's former employer, also is named as a defendant.

The Complaint asserts claims against Ms. Wilkov and ESP for unjust
enrichment, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and seeks a return of $1,380,000 allegedly
invested by the Plaintiffs in the fraudulent scheme. Complaint Ex. 4.

ARGUMENT

I. The Interests of Justice Require that the Court Stay the Civil Case
Against Ms. Wilkov and ESP

Itis axiomatic that district courts have the discretionary authority to stay a case

when the interests of justice so require. Kashi v. Gratsos, 790 F.2d 1050, 1057 (2d Cir.

 

Attached as Exhibit B to the Campbell Declaration Is a chart showing that individuals who
appear as Plaintiffs in this action are listed as, or joint investors with, victims in the indictment.

1986) (citations and internal quotations omitted); Crawford & Sons LTD v. Besser, 298 F.
Supp.2d 317, 319 (E.D.N.Y. 2004). The district court can employ a stay to address the
interests of a criminal defendant asserting Fifth Amendment rights who faces the difficult
choice of being prejudiced in the civil litigation if those rights are asserted or prejudiced in
the criminal proceeding if those rights are waived. In re Worldcom Securities Litigation Inc..,
No. 02 Civ. 3288, 2002 WL 31729501 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. December 5, 2002) (hereinafter
"Worldcom') (citation omitted).

Courts in this District consider at least six factors, ail of which are present here
and counsel a stay, to determine whether a stay is appropriate. The factors are: (1) the
extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil case;
(2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; (3)
the private interesis of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the
prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the
defendants; (5) the interest of the courts and (6) the public interest. Trustees of the
Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund v. Transworld Mechanical Inc., 886
F.Supp. 1134, 1139 (S.D.N.Y.1995); see also SEC v. Treadway, No. 04 Civ. 3464, 2005
WL 713826 at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. March 30, 2005); (setting out six factor test); Johnson v. New
York City Police Department, No. 01 Civ. 6570, 2003 WL 21664882 (S.D.N.Y. July 16,
2003) (same); Worldcom, 2002 WL 31729501 at *3 (same). As shown below, in this case
all of the listed factors are present and weigh in favor of granting the requested stay.

A. Overlap of Issues

"The strongest case for granting a stay is where a party under criminal
Case 1:07-cv-06272-AKH Document12_ Filed 09/14/2007 Page 9 of 14

indictment is required to defend a civil proceeding involving the same subject matter."
Voimar Distributors v. New York Post, 152 F.R.D. 36, 39 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) citing SEC v.
Dresser Industries, 628 F.2d 1368, 1375-76 (D.C. Cir. 1980). This "strongest case" is
precisely the scenario before the Court here. The civil action involves the same actors, the
same transactions and essentially the same allegations of wrongdoing as the criminal
proceeding.* In fact, given the degree of overlap and timing of the filing of the Complaint
(two weeks after the indictment was filed), one can reasonably assume that the indictment
provided a model for the claims in the civil action. The identity of issues in the two actions
makes it more likely that Ms. Wilkov's Fifth Amendment rights will be compromised if she
is forced to participate in the civil proceeding. The scope of overlap of issues here weighs
"strongly" in support of granting the stay. Volmar Distributors, 152 F.R.D. at 39.
B. Status of the Criminal Case

The existence of an indictment generally favors the granting of a stay in a
related civil proceeding. Johnson v. New York City Police Department, 2003 WL 21664882
at * 2 citing In re Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. Securities Litigation, 133 F.R.D. 12, 13 (S.D.N.Y.
1990). As Judge Lynch of this Court stated in Sterling National Bank v. A-1 Hotels
International, inc., 175 F.Supp.2d 573, 577 (S.D.N.Y 2001} "[w]hen a defendant has been

indicted, his situation is particularly dangerous, and takes a certain priority, for the risk to

 

3 As shown on the accompanying chart (Campball Decl., Exhibit B ), the degree of overlap

is extraordinary. For example, 28 of the 30 Plaintiffs specifically named in the Complaint are either
mentioned in the indictment or are allegedly joint investors with those mentioned in the indictment; the
properties referenced by the government in { 14 of the Frooks Affidavit are referenced In the Complaint
(Campbell Decl. 7 6 and Ex. E) and ail of the individual criminal defendants are named as Defendants in
the Camplaint. The amount allegedly defrauded by the criminal defendants is $1,663,334 which is
comparable to the $1,380,000 allegedly invested and lost by the Plaintiffs (accounting for the fact that the
indictment mentions other investors who are not Plaintiffs in this action).

6
Case 1:07-cv-06272-AKH Document12 Filed 09/14/2007 Page 10 of 14

his liberty, the importance of safeguarding his constitutional rights, and even the strain on
his resources and attention that makes defending satellite civil litigation particularly difficult,
all weigh in favor of his interest." In light of the serious nature of the charges against Ms.
Wilkov and the impact on her constitutional rights, the interests of justice support allowing
Wlikov to focus her time and resources on defending the criminal case without
simultaneously being forced to contest the civil proceedings.

The pendency of the indictment also reduces the impact of a stay on the
Plaintiffs because it is likely that the criminal case will be resolved relatively expeditiously,
either because the motion to dismiss the indictment is granted or because the case will
proceed to trial in the time frame mandated by the Speedy Trial Act. See e.g., Worldcom,
2002 WL 31729501 at "5 (prejudice of delay to civil plaintiff reduced because of Speedy
Trial Act considerations); Transworld, 886 F.Supp. at 1139 (same); Sterling National Bank,
175 F. Supp.2d at 577 (same).

Cc. The Interests of the Plaintiffs

Plaintiffs will suffer no real prejudice if a stay is entered. In fact their interests
may be served if the criminal proceeding is concluded before the civil case proceeds
because the criminal action may clarify the issues and make any later civil discovery more
efficient. See Rosenthal v. Giuliani, No. 98 Civ. 8408, 2001 WL 121944 at *2 (S.D.NLY.
February 9, 2001). In addition, as Ms. Wilkov's assets are currently subject of a freeze
order, the stay does not increase the risk that Plaintiffs will not be able to enforce a
judgment. In fact a stay increases the probability that there will assets available to pay

restitution to the Plaintiffs because it allows Ms. Wilkov to avoid the cost of duplicative
