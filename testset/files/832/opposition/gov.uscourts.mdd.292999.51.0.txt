Case No.: 8:14-cv-03124-TDC

RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ALTER OR AMEND
JUDGMENT PER FRCP RULE 59(e) AND MOTION FOR LEAVE
TO AMEND COMPLAINT PER FRCP RULE 15(a)(2) AND (c)
COMES NOW Defendant Romarm S.A. (“Romarm”), by and through its undersigned
attorneys, and files this response in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment
Per FRCP Rule 59(e) and Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint Per FRCP Rule 15(a)(2) and
(c).
ARGUMENT
As will be shown, Plaintiffs’ motion must be denied as they have wholly failed to sustain
their burden to show any of the three grounds on which a Rule 59(e) motion may be granted.
Further, even if Plaintiffs could sustain their burden on the Rule 59(e) aspect of the motion, the
motion should be denied as permitting the filing of the proposed Amended Complaint would be
futile and Plaintiffs have already filed five separate Complaints or Amended Complaints related
to these claims, all of which have resulted in dismissal.
I.

PLAINTIFFS’ RULE 59(E) MOTION
The threshold issue for Plaintiffs’ motion is whether they have included sufficient facts

and argument to meet their burden in asking the Court to amend or alter its Order dismissing the

1

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 51 Filed 09/03/15 Page 2 of 10

matter per its Order dated July 17, 2015 (Docket No. 49). “Although Rule 59(e) does not itself
provide a standard under which a district court may grant” such a motion, the Fourth Circuit has
recognized only three grounds “for amending an earlier judgment: (1) to accommodate an
intervening change in controlling law; (2) to account for new evidence not available at trial; or
(3) to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.” Pacific Ins. Co. v. Am. Nat’l
Fire Ins. Co., 148 F.3d 396, 403 (4th Cir. 1998)(citing Lockheed Martin Corp. Aero & Naval
Sys., 116 F.3d 110, 112 (4th Cir. 1997).

Plaintiffs do not complain that there was an

“intervening change in controlling law” or “a clear error of law.” Thus, Plaintiffs appear to be
claiming that either they have “new evidence not available” prior to dismissal, or the amendment
is needed to “prevent manifest injustice.”

Based on a review of the proposed Amended

Complaint, neither argument is viable.
“[T]he district court may not grant [a Rule 15(a)] motion unless the judgment is vacated
pursuant to Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).” Mayfield v. NASCAR, 674 F.3d 369, 378-79 (4th Cir.
2012). Plaintiffs argue that a Rule 59(e) motion and a Rule 15(a) motion “rise and fall together.”
A better summary of the interrelationship of the Rule 59(e) motion and the Rule 15(a) motion, in
this context, is if the Court were to abuse its discretion in denying a motion to amend a pleading
prior to dismissal, then an appellate court would rule that both the Rule 59(e) motion and Rule
15(a) motions should be granted. Id. Here, Plaintiffs cannot show that any of the three grounds
for relief under Rule 59(e) are present, and further, they cannot show that the proposed Amended
Complaint would have survived Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (i.e., that the filing of an
amended complaint would not be futile).
“Rule 59(e) motions may not be used, however, to raise arguments which could have
been raised prior to the issuance of the judgment, nor may they be used to argue a case under a

2

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 51 Filed 09/03/15 Page 3 of 10

novel legal theory that the party had the ability to address in the first instance.” Pac. Ins. Co., 148
F.3d at 403. “Whatever may be the purpose of Rule 59(e) it should not be supposed that it is
intended to give an unhappy litigant one additional chance to sway the judge.” Richardson v.
Union Pub. Safety Dep’t Police, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127990, *6 (citing Crosswhite v. E.I.
Dupont de Nemours & Co., 896 F.2d 1366 (4th Cir. 1990)). It is clear that Plaintiffs’ motion is
simply their attempt to try argue new points available prior to the issuance of the judgment or
reargue points that have already been made to, and rejected by, this Court, as well as the federal
courts in the District of Columbia. This includes Plaintiffs’ argument that “Romarm, through its
General Manager, Mr. Crisan, thereby waived any claim or defense that there was no personal
jurisdiction over it” when he sent a letter to the District of Columbia clerk dated October 25,
2011. Without addressing the validity of such an argument (or the lack thereof), any such
argument arising from this letter was clearly available to Plaintiffs when they were before the
District Court in Washington, D.C., and of course this Court more recently. Plaintiffs are
unhappy litigants and this motion should not be used as “one additional chance” 1 to sway the
Court.
“Similarly, if a party relies on newly discovered evidence in its Rule 59(e) motion, the
party ‘must provide a legitimate justification for not presenting the evidence during the earlier
proceeding.’” Pac. Ins. Co., 148 F.3d at 403 (citing Small v. Hunt, 98 F.3d 789, 798 (4th Cir.
1996)(internal citation omitted). Here, not only have Plaintiffs failed to identify any “newly
discovered evidence,” but they have wholly failed to justify why any new factual allegations set
forth in the Amended Complaint were not presented in some form during the briefing or at
argument on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.

1

In the present context, it may be more appropriate to think of it as “yet another additional chance” to sway a court.

3

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 51 Filed 09/03/15 Page 4 of 10

“In general ‘reconsideration of a judgment after its entry is an extraordinary remedy
which should be used sparingly.’” Id. (citing 11 Wright et al, Federal Practice and Procedure §
2810.1, at 124 (2d ed. 1995)).

Plaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to present all well

pleaded facts, and even evidence beyond the four corners of the Complaint, in opposition to
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. Thus, the extraordinary remedy using Rule 59(e) is not
appropriate in this case. The Court issued a well-reasoned, thorough and substantive analysis of
all claims; and ultimately agreed with Romarm’s position that this Court lacked personal
jurisdiction over Romarm. While Plaintiffs are clearly not satisfied with this result, their future
options to try to pursue their claims, wherever that properly may be, do not include the motion
before this Court.
II.

PLAINTIFFS’ RULE 15(A) MOTION
Rule 15 allows a party to amend its pleading once before being served with a responsive

pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). “The right to amend is never absolute, however, as a District
Court may deny a motion to amend if it concludes that the amendment would be futile.” Foman
v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). The Court may also deny leave
to amend based on “undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated
failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing
party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of amendment.” Foman, 371 U.S. at
182.
1. Amendment is Futile
A proposed amendment is futile if the complaint, as amended, would be subject to
dismissal. Bradley v. ValMejias, 379 F.3d 892, 901 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing Jefferson County
Sch. Dist. V. Moody's Investor's Servs., 175 F.3d 848, 859 (10th Cir. 1999)). “A court properly

4

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 51 Filed 09/03/15 Page 5 of 10

may deny a motion for leave to amend as futile when the proposed amended complaint would be
subject to dismissal for any reason. . . .” Bauchman v. West High School, 132 F.3d 542, 562
(10th Cir. 1997). “Futility” means that the complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted. Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 623 (1st
Cir. 1996); see also Ketchum v. Cruz, 961 F.2d 916, 920 (10th Cir. 1992) (“A district court is
clearly justified in denying a motion to amend as futile only if the proposed amendment cannot
withstand a motion to dismiss or otherwise fails to state a claim.”). “In reviewing for ‘futility,’
the district court applies the same standard of legal sufficiency as applies to a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion.” Id.; Thompson v. Gjivoje, 687 F. Supp. 922, 924 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). “[A] complaint
which consists of conclusory allegations unsupported by factual assertions fails even the liberal
standard of Rule 12(b)(6).” DeJesus v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 87 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.
1996)(emphasis added)(internal citations omitted). Here, the Court’s analysis and dismissal of
Plaintiffs’ Complaint is equally applicable to the proposed Amended Complaint, and as such, the
amendment would be futile.
a. No New Allegations
It is clear that Plaintiffs, for some unknown reason, are seeking to delete numerous causes
of action, but they fail to point the Court to any new, well pleaded, factual allegations that
support their jurisdiction arguments. In fact, even a cursory review of the proposed new
allegations reveal that Plaintiff’s Proposed Amended Complaint does not - and cannot - assert
any facts sufficient to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Plaintiff has only
offered conclusory and generalized allegations that are contradicted by the record and which fail
even the liberal standard of Rule 12(b)(6).
b. Plaintiffs Failed to Plead Facts to Establish Minimum Contacts Between Romarm and
the Forum.

5

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 51 Filed 09/03/15 Page 6 of 10

Ultimately, if the Court deems it necessary, the question is whether Plaintiffs alleged
specific facts to establish minimum contacts with the forum in the propose Amended Complaint?
Carefirst of Md., Inc. v. Carefirst Pregnancy Ctrs., Inc., 334 F.3d 30, 396 (4th Cir. 2003). The
answer to this question is still a resounding “no.” The incident giving rise to Plaintiffs’ lawsuit
occurred wholly in the District of Columbia and occurred after criminals illegally trafficked and
utilized a firearm manufactured by Romarm in Romania. (Dkt. No. 1-1, Plt. Compl., ¶¶ 3-4.)
The only alleged connections to the State of Maryland are: (1) that Romarm sells its products
“outside the United States for distribution to dealers inside the United States” and (2) “the
weapon was transported from the State of Maryland” into Washington, D.C. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 5.) Now,
Plaintiffs add the additional allegations that Romarm firearms made their way into “warehouses
in Prince Georges County, and elsewhere in Maryland” and “Romarm has received at least $1
Million in revenue from the sales of its weapons that have been stored in Maryland and
distributed or sold by affiliated dealers in Maryland over that period.” See proposed Amended
Complaint, Docket No. 50-1, ¶¶ 33-34. Plaintiffs still cannot link Romarm to activity targeted to
the forum. General allegations that Romarm’s products make their way into Maryland are not
sufficient. The fact that Plaintiffs claim that Romarm sold its products outside the United States
is simply not enough to establish minimum contacts with the forum because a broad desire to
target the United States through a distributor does not establish personal jurisdiction. See
McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct 2780, 2791-92 (2011) (Breyer J., concurring).
Plaintiffs’ convoluted arguments in support of its motion to amend simply do not alter the
conclusion that their Complaint and proposed Amended Complaint contain insufficient facts to
establish minimum contacts between Romarm and the forum.

2. Plaintiffs’ Attempt to Amend is Dilatory, in Bad Faith and Further Evidence of
Repeated Failures to Cure Deficiencies by Amendments Previously Allowed
On or about April 22, 2011, Plaintiffs Norman Williams and Diane Howe commenced a
lawsuit against Romarm in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia (“First Lawsuit”).
(Dkt. No. 9-3, Dkt. Sheet for 2011 CA 002349.) The plaintiffs made no attempt to serve either
complaint. A Second Amended Complaint was subsequently filed on or about August 30, 2011.
(Dkt. No. 9-4, Plt. Am. Compl. 8/30/11.) On or about March 26, 2012, Plaintiffs Williams and
Howe voluntarily dismissed their pending lawsuit, and the case was dismissed on April 2, 2012.
(Dkt. No. 9-5, Dkt. Sheet for Civ. Action No. 1:11-cv-01924-ABJ.)
On March 20, 2012, less than one week before voluntarily dismissing their First Lawsuit,
Plaintiffs Williams and Howe filed a second lawsuit against Romarm in the District Court for the
District of Columbia. (Dkt. No. 9-6, Plt. Comp. 3/20/12.) As the record from the prior lawsuit
in the District Court for the District of Columbia reflects, on or about October 3, 2012, a Motion
for Leave of Court to Amend Pleadings and Join Similarly Situated Parties was filed by
Plaintiffs’ counsel. (See Dkt. No. 17 at Ex. B.) However, on the date the motion was filed,
District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan entered an order permanently striking the motion for leave to
amend because “Plaintiffs’ motion only attaches a document that purports to list what would be
added to the current complaint, rather than attaching the amended complaint as a whole.” (See
Dkt. No. 9-7, 1:12-cv-00436-EGS Dkt. Sheet at p. 5.)
Finally, Plaintiffs filed this Complaint on or about September 2, 2014, bringing claims for
wrongful death arising from the shooting deaths of certain minors. (See Dkt. No. 1-1, Plt.
Compl.)
As such, prior to the subject motion for leave under Rule 15(a), Plaintiffs have filed or
attempted to file five (5) Complaints or Amended Complaints related to these claims. This Court

7

Case 8:14-cv-03124-TDC Document 51 Filed 09/03/15 Page 8 of 10

was addressing Plaintiff’s fifth attempt at properly and sufficiently crafting a pleading that would
survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge. The Court should deny leave to amend based on “repeated
failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed.” Foman, 371 U.S. at 182.
Plaintiffs have had sufficient opportunities to cure the defects and inadequacies in their pleadings
and have failed to do so.
CONCLUSION
The majority of Plaintiffs’ arguments in support of the motion do not appear relevant to
the analysis for Rule 59(e) or Rule 15(a). These would include issues related to the PLCAA (15
U.S.C. 7901, et seq.), FSIA (28 U.S.C. 1602, et seq.), venue, and statute of limitations issues.
Nothing about the incident, filing of the prior actions, the applicability of the PLCAA or FSIA to
this action, or the location of the incident or residences of the plaintiffs have changed in any way
between the Complaint and the proposed Amended Complaint. It is somewhat baffling why
paragraphs 9-31 are even included in the supporting brief. However, if the Court finds such
arguments relevant to the issues presented in the subject motion, Defendant refers to and
incorporates its arguments on these issues as presented in its Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 9), its
Reply brief (Dkt. No. 26), and at oral argument.
Based on the foregoing and upon the arguments and legal authorities outlined herein, it is
respectfully requested that Plaintiffs’ Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment Per FRCP Rule 59(e)
and Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint Per FRCP Rule 15(a)(2) and (c) be denied. The
Court is respectfully requested to grant such other and further relief deemed necessary and just,
including the imposition of costs and fees against Plaintiffs.
