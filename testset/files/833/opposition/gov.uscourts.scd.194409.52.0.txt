MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO EXTEND TIME

In reply to their SCDC co-Defendants' motion to extend their deadline by which to file
dispositive motions (ECF Docket Entry #50), Defendants Frick, SC Office of Attorney General
and Fairfield County Solicitor's Office hereby consent to same. Moreover, these Defendants
would request that the Court extend the dispositive motions deadline for all Defendants up to and
including October 4, 2013. This request is based upon the parties' desire for a commonality of
dates for the convenience of all defense counsel as well as Plaintiff's counsel. Upon information
and belief, extending the current dispositive motions deadline for all Defendants would provide
Plaintiff with a single, common deadline by which to file responsive memoranda.
