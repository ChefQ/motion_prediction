INTRODUCTION

2

Plaintiffs file this brief in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant

3

California Travel and Tourism Commission (“CTTC”).1 The majority of the arguments presented

4

by the CTTC are addressed in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Motions to Dismiss, filed in conjunction

5

herewith.2 To the extent that the CTTC has presented unique arguments, they are addressed here.

PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS ARE PROPERLY BEFORE THIS COURT
A.

8

This Court Should Exercise Supplemental Jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’
Bagley-Keene Act Claim

9

This Court should exercise pendent, or what is now referred to as supplemental,

10

jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) over Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene Act claim3 because that

11

claim shares a common nucleus of operative facts with the Plaintiffs’ federal Sherman Act claim

12

and because judicial economy, convenience, and fairness would be undermined by litigating the

13

Bagley-Keene Act claim in a new, parallel lawsuit in state court. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,

14

383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966) (“Gibbs”); Exec. Software N. Am. v. U.S. Dist. Court, 24 F.3d 1545,

15

1551 (9th Cir. 1994).

16

Analysis of supplemental jurisdiction begins with 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), which provides:

17

(a) Except as provided in subsections (b)4 and (c) or as expressly provided
otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have
original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all
other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original
jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of
the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims
that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.

1

Plaintiffs agree to dismiss Caroline Beteta from this action. Plaintiffs will also agree to dismiss
their UCL claim against the CTTC.
2

Specifically, Defendants’ arguments regarding state action immunity under Parker v. Brown and
the Twombly standard on a motion to dismiss are addressed in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Motions to
Dismiss.
3

Because Plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss its UCL claim against Beteta and the CTTC and the
Rental Car Defendants have not challenged the Court’s supplemental jurisdiction over the UCL
claim, Plaintiffs will not address that claim.

4

Subdivision (b) is inapplicable here because it governs supplemental jurisdiction when federal
jurisdiction is based on diversity pursuant to § 1332. Here, this Court’s jurisdiction is based on the
federal questions raised by Plaintiffs’ Sherman Act claim over which this Court has original
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1337 and 1331.

28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). The exercise of this supplemental jurisdiction in the first instance rests in the

2

sound discretion of this Court, but that discretion must be infused with and impelled by certain

3

practical and common-sense considerations that are at its foundation. As the Supreme Court

4

stressed in Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343 (1988):

10

Under Gibbs, a federal court should consider and weigh in each case, at every stage
of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity
in order to decide whether to exercise jurisdiction over a case brought in that court
involving pendent state law claims. When the balance of these factors indicates that
a case properly belongs in state court, as when the federal-law claims have dropped
out of the lawsuit in its early stages and only state-law claims remain, the federal
court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction . . . . As articulated by Gibbs, the
doctrine of pendent jurisdiction thus is a doctrine of flexibility, designed to allow
courts to deal with cases involving pendent claims in the manner that most sensibly
accommodates a range of concerns and values.

11

Id. at 350 (citation and footnote omitted, emphasis added) (quoted and cited with approval, Exec.

12

Software N. Am., 24 F.3d at 1553 (“[Gibbs] establishes that pendent jurisdiction doctrine is

13

designed to enable courts to handle cases involving state law claims in the way that will best

14

accommodate the values of economy, convenience, fairness, and comity, and Gibbs further

15

establishes that the Judicial Branch is to shape and apply the doctrine in that light.”) (citing Gibbs,

16

383 U.S. at 351) (emphasis in original)); see also Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 545 (1974).5

As the Supreme Court also observed in Carnegie-Mellon, when the balance of these

18

practical considerations “indicates that a case properly belongs in state court, as when the federal

19

claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages and only state-law claims remain, the

20

federal court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction.” Carnegie-Mellon Univ., 484 U.S. at 350

(footnote omitted). But the mirror image is also true: When it “will best accommodate the values

The statute reads broadly because it is meant to be broad. As one commentator explains:
Subsection (a) of the supplemental jurisdiction statute is a broad grant of supplemental
jurisdiction, extending to the full extent of Article III. Subject to the exceptions provided
in subsections (b) and (c), or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute, in any
civil action in which the district court has original jurisdiction, it also has supplemental
jurisdiction over ‘“all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within
original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III
of the United States Constitution.”

16-106, James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore’s Federal Practice, Civil ¶ 106 (3d ed. 2007).

of economy, convenience, fairness, and comity” the federal court should not require the filing of

2

another lawsuit and should retain jurisdiction over state law claims. See id. at 351. In point of

3

fact, Congress has carefully limited those instances where otherwise proper supplemental

4

jurisdiction may be denied.

5

The Ninth Circuit explained the relationship between section 1367(a), where supplemental

6

jurisdiction “shall” exist, and the enumerated exceptions to that mandate in subdivision (c), in

7

Executive Software North America:

16

Congress, in codifying supplemental jurisdiction, has chosen to codify as well the
discretionary factors that warrant declining jurisdiction. Section 1367(a), providing
that “the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims
that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they
form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States
Constitution,” confers power to entertain supplemental jurisdiction in mandatory
terms. By use of the word “shall,” the statute makes clear that if power is conferred
under section 1367(a), and its exercise is not prohibited by section 1367(b), a court
can decline to assert supplemental jurisdiction over a pendent claim only if one of
the four categories specifically enumerated in section 1367(c) applies . . . . By
selecting this statutory structure, it is clear that Congress intended section 1367(c)
to provide the exclusive means by which supplemental jurisdiction can be declined
by a court.
24 F.3d at 1555-56 (citation and footnote omitted; emphasis in original).

17

In sum, when considering whether the CTTC is correct that Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene Act

18

claim should be litigated in another, parallel state court proceeding, they must demonstrate that the

19

values of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants would not be offended by

20

such a result. Hagans, 415 U.S. at 545.

22

B.

The Court Should Not Require Plaintiffs to File a Separate Lawsuit Seeking
to Block the CTTC from Unlawfully Meeting in Secret

23

Plaintiffs’ state claim alleging that the Defendants (including the CTTC) together all

24

conspired in secret to violate the Sherman Act in a way that violates California’s open meeting

25

laws logically has a common nucleus of operative fact to Plaintiffs’ claim of an unlawful

26

conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act.

27

Moreover, the values of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants as well

28

as comity to state courts persuade that Plaintiffs should not have to file a parallel lawsuit blocking

1

the CTTC from unlawfully meeting in secret because Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene Act state law claim

2

has already substantially been resolved while in this federal court.

3

Defendants sought from Plaintiffs an interim resolution governing their future meetings after

4

Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction in this Court seeking enforcement of the

5

Bagley-Keene Act. Thus, the Plaintiffs and Defendants cooperatively and under the aegis of this

6

federal court jointly moved for an interim order addressing many of the Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene

7

Act allegations. This Court signed the order on December 12, 2007. While some issues remain,

8

and there are questions about whether the Court’s order was obeyed, this Court’s interim order if

9

made permanent would resolve most of this state claim.

The CTTC and Beteta

10

That the parties have negotiated and submitted a joint order to this Court – and that this

11

Court issued such an order − is what distinguishes this case from Southern California Edison Co.

12

v. Lynch, 353 F.3d 648 (9th Cir. 2003), relied upon by the CTTC. CTTC Mem. at 24. Here, the

13

parties appear to have reached at least a tentative resolution of most of the outstanding Bagley-

14

Keene Act claims. They have done so by mutually invoking the ongoing authority of this Court.

15

In Edison, by contrast, the parties were still contesting vigorously the Bagley-Keene Act claim.

16

Moreover, the issue in Edison was both legal and novel: whether the Bagley-Keene Act is violated

17

when public officials agree to settle a case in closed session. In vast contrast, as revealed both by

18

the provisions of the joint order, the Complaint, and even the barest review of Plaintiffs’ Motion

19

for a Preliminary Injunction, the allegations here are both almost exclusively factual and factually

20

incontestable.

21

Furthermore, while CTTC is correct that in Edison the Ninth Circuit certified the Bagley-

22

Keene Act issue to the California Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit retained jurisdiction over the

23

matter and it was that federal court that issued the dispositive ruling. S. Cal. Edison Co., 353 F.3d

24

648.6

25

Having already largely addressed this important claim in this federal court, it would be

26

wasteful to begin the process of adjudicating and resolving it afresh in state court. Indeed, to

27

6

28

The CTTC cites the same Ninth Circuit’s Per Curiam opinion (CTTC Mem. at 24) but does not
acknowledge that the federal appellate court retained jurisdiction when it certified the issue to the
California Supreme Court.

1

prevent just such a needless waste of time, money, and resources, federal District Courts in this

2

Circuit have sensibly retained jurisdiction over state claims in some instances even when the

3

underlying federal claims have been entirely dismissed.

4

Thus, in Ponce v. GMC, No. CV-01-56-ST, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27974 (D. Or. Nov. 13,

5

2002), the only remaining claims were state ones for assault and battery and intentional infliction

6

of emotional distress. Pointing to exactly the kind of common-sense factors stressed in Gibbs and

7

its progeny, the Magistrate (in reasoning adopted by the District Court) reasoned that the values of

8

“economy, convenience, fairness and comity” were served by retaining jurisdiction over the state

9

law claims even though all of the federal claims had been dismissed.

15

Here, this court’s continuing exercise of jurisdiction will serve “the values of
economy, convenience, fairness and comity.” Discovery has been completed and
dispositive motions have been filed. Once these motions are decided, the parties
will be ready for trial. Although Ponce initially filed this action in state court,
indicating his preference for that jurisdiction, a return to state court may jeopardize
his ability to obtain a timely trial. The Multnomah County Circuit Court for the
State of Oregon has recently announced that due to a budgetary crisis, it may
suspend all civil trials for an extended period of time. Therefore, this court
recommends retaining jurisdiction of the two remaining state law claims against
Kaleikilo.

16

Ponce, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27974, at *42. Moreover, in La Patagonia Compania Argentina de

17

Seguros, S.A. v. Empresa Lineas Maritimas Argentinas, S.A., Case No. C 91-2634 BAC, 1992

18

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15281, at *10-*11 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 1992), the District Court in the interest of

19

judicial economy, exercised supplemental jurisdiction over supplemental state claims, even though

20

the statute of limitations had run on the principal federal claim.7

C.

22

While the CTTC Argues that It Is Distant from the Case in Controversy, the
Rental Car Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Argues Otherwise

23

The CTTC argues that “[i]f there is any inference to be drawn from the facts alleged by

24

Plaintiffs, it is that the Commission has absolutely no interest in the prices being set by the Rental

25

Car Companies and has no relationship whatsoever to the Airport Concession Fees.” CTTC Mem.

26

7

27
28

The CTTC does not argue that the conditions for dismissal under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) are met.
The Bagley-Keene Act claim does not “substantially predominate” over the Sherman Act claim.
This Court has not dismissed the federal claim and the CTTC has not pointed to “exceptional” or
other “compelling” reasons to deny supplemental jurisdiction.

1

at 18 (emphasis omitted). But, in contrast, the Rental Car defendants place the CTTC at the

2

epicenter of their Motion to Dismiss. Indeed, they cast the 2.5% assessment not as one assessed

3

by the Defendants on themselves but repeatedly as the “CTTC assessment.” See, e.g., Rental Car

4

Defs.’ Mem. at 3, 6, 12.

5

Moreover, the Rental Car defendants argue that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine shields

6

them from Sherman Act liability because the assessment was not an assessment of companies on

7

each other but really an effort to “lobby” the CTTC (Rental Car Defs.’ Mem. at 12) and they argue

8

that “legislatively-sanctioned decision of the CTTC’s rental car members to impose a 2.5% self-

9

assessment to fund the CTTC is immune from [liability].” Id. at 13.

10

Indeed, the Rental Car defendants argue that business-run CTTC – far from being a

11

bystander in the case − stood to benefit by tens of millions of dollars from the assessments the

12

Defendants agreed to charge each other. Id. at 4. While the Rental Car defendants for some

13

reason do not say precisely how much the CTTC stands to benefit (id. at 4, referencing only an

14

“increase” in funding) the Assembly Floor analysis they seek the court to notice makes clear the

15

dimensions of the CTTC’s stake: a nearly ten-fold increase in its funding from about $7 million to

16

$50 million. All this extra money is for an “agency” that is not run by or funded by any

17

government and that, if the CTTC is to be believed, is also somehow a stranger to the facts that

18

give rise to its substantial increase in funding.

19
20

D.

Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene Act Claim Is Not Time-Barred, as Defendants’
Violations Are Ongoing

21

CTTC argues that Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene Act cause of action is time-barred because it

22

supposedly is based upon those violations that are alleged to have occurred in furtherance and as a

23

part of the conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act. CTTC Mem. at 22. This argument must be

24

rejected for three reasons:

25

First, in the Complaint (¶ 69), Plaintiffs allege that the violations of the Bagley-Keene Act

26

are “continuing.” Since the claim alleges “continuing” violations of the Act, it is not applying just

27

to “past conduct” as CTTC argues (CTTC Mem. at 23) and instead applies to “present or future

28

conduct” (id.) which is by definition not time-barred.
6

Case 3:07-cv-02174-H-BLM

Document 60

Filed 03/11/2008

Page 8 of 9

1

Second, the Bagley-Keene Act cause of action is based upon this Court’s supplemental

2

jurisdiction, as the CTTC itself acknowledges. Id. at 23. It is a state law claim that exists and may

3

be adjudicated apart from Plaintiffs’ Sherman Act claim. Indeed, under the authorities discussed

4

above, Plaintiffs’ Bagley-Keene Act claim may be adjudicated by this Court even if the federal

5

claim for some reason fails. Thus, because the claim alleges continuing violations of a state law

6

that has force and effect independent of the facts that gave rise to the Sherman Act claim, this

7

Court has jurisdiction of those Bagley-Keene Act violations that are ongoing and that might not

8

have occurred in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy.

9

Phrased differently, the time for filing a complaint based on alleged continuing violations

10

of the Act cannot be timed from the date of those violations that are alleged to have played a role

11

in the antitrust conspiracy.

12

Third, this Court has already signed a joint motion of the parties for an interim order

13

requiring the CTTC to abide by various portions of the Act. This interim order follows the filing

14

of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction to enforce the Act, which has yet to be finally

15

adjudicated. The order states that “the parties stipulate and agree that the following will be

16

binding on both CTTC and its committees until the hearing on Plaintiffs’ [Motion for a

17

Preliminary Injunction].” Order at 1. Respectfully, the CTTC would not likely have agreed to the

18

detailed provisions of the interim order governing their future hearings if the CTTC in fact

19

believed that the entire claim was time-barred. They would have, instead, opposed the motion for

20

a preliminary injunction on statute of limitations grounds.

21

III.

22

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons and those expressed in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Rental Car

23

Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the CTTC’s motion must be denied.
