Case 3:07-cv-02174-H-BLM Document50 ~~ Filed 02/08/2008 Page2of3

TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on April 1, 2008, at 10:30 a.m., or as soon thereafter as
the matter may be heard, in Courtroom 13 of the above-entitled Court, located at 880 Front
Street, No. 4290, San Diego, California 92101, defendant California Travel and Tourism |
Commission ("CTTC") will, and hereby does, move the Court for an order dismissing with
prejudice Plaintiffs' Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

This motion is made on the basis that CTTC is entitled to immunity from antitrust liability
for any acts complained of in the Complaint as a state actor. Alternatively, the allegations in the
Complaint fail to satisfy the pleading standard announced in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, -__
U.S. , 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007). Alternatively, CTTC is immune from antitrust liability under
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and Plaintiffs have suffered no injury.

CTTC moves to dismiss the Unfair Competition Law claims on the grounds that CTTC is
not a "person" for unfair competition purposes and is therefore not subject to suit. The untair
competition claim should also be dismissed because Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to establish any illegal activity on the part of CTTC on which to base an unfair
competition claim. CTTC is expressly immune from any such suit pursuant to California
Government Code section 13995.90(c). Any conduct Plaintiffs complain of was done in
compliance with the California Tourism Marketing Act, California Government Code
sections 13995 et seq.

CTTC moves to dismiss the third claim, alleging violations of the Bagley-Keene Open
Meeting Act for lack of jurisdiction since the third claim is not transactionally related to the
antitrust claims over which the Court has original jurisdiction. CTTC also moves to dismiss the
Bagley-Keene Act claim. because the alleged violations are time-barred, and on comity
principles, as this is an issue best left for the California state courts, or better yet, the California
Legislature.

This motion is based upon this Notice, the accompanying Memorandum of Points and
Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss, the Motion to Dismiss filed by the Rental Car

Defendants on January 25, 2008, in which CTTC has joined, the Request for Judicial Notice
