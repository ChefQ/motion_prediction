Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 7 of 30

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Plaintiff Sarah Palin’s motion for reconsideration of this Court’s August 29, 2017 Order
and to alter or amend the Court’s August 30, 2017 judgment should be denied for two separate
but related reasons.
First, Mrs. Palin’s motion proceeds from the false premise that she was deprived of “a
meaningful opportunity to plead her case.” Pl.’s Mem. of Law in Support of Mot. For
Reconsideration and to Alter or Amend the Judgment, Dkt. 52 (“Mem.”) at 1. In fact, the Court
not only held an evidentiary hearing that provided her with an opportunity to cure her facially
deficient pleading, it also thereafter permitted her to submit two supplemental briefs in which she
relied on the same factual allegations and legal theories that now undergird her motion for
reconsideration. As a result, the Court has already considered the very same contentions that
Mrs. Palin now re-urges in her motion, expressly concluding “it is plain that plaintiff has not and
cannot meet” the applicable “plausibility” standard by which her case must be judged, “even
with the benefit of the facts brought forth by the evidentiary hearing” and the “gloss” Mrs. Palin
sought to put on them in her supplemental briefs. Opinion & Order, Dkt. 45 (“Op.”) at 17-18.
Mrs. Palin’s attempt to reargue her case, therefore, offers no proper basis for reconsideration—
i.e., no “data that the Court overlooked . . . that might reasonably be expected to alter the
conclusion reached.” Crupar-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc., 41 F. Supp. 3d 411, 413
(S.D.N.Y. 2014) (Rakoff, J.) (citation omitted); see also Sequa Corp. v. GBJ Corp., 156 F.3d
136, 144 (2d Cir. 1998) (a motion for reconsideration is not “a vehicle for relitigating old issues,
presenting the case under new theories, securing a rehearing on the merits, or otherwise taking a
‘second bite at the apple’”) (citations omitted). The motion should be denied on this basis alone.
Second, even if the Court were to allow Mrs. Palin a “second bite at the apple” following
the entry of judgment, the amendment she contemplates is demonstrably futile because it fails to

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 8 of 30

make plausible allegations of “actual malice.” To the extent the proposed amendment ventures
beyond the same allegations the Court has already rejected in assessing both Mrs. Palin’s
complaint and her supplemental briefs, it doubles down on the very same kinds of “gross
supposition” and “weak” allegations that characterized those previous submissions, Op. at 25, by
infusing her proposed amended pleading with an admixture of facially implausible and internally
contradictory contentions, unreasonable inferences from facts actually adduced at the evidentiary
hearing, and conclusory assertions that there can be no good-faith basis to make. It is well
settled that the Court need not credit such implausible allegations and unreasonable inferences
and, when the proposed Amended Complaint is stripped of them, there can be no serious dispute
that leave to amend would be futile. Mrs. Palin’s motion for reconsideration should be denied on
this basis as well.
RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On July 7, 2017, the parties appeared before the Court for an initial case management and
scheduling conference. At that conference, defendant The New York Times Company (“The
Times”) stated its intention to move to dismiss the complaint on several grounds, including most
notably that Mrs. Palin had failed to plead plausible allegations of actual malice. In considering
whether to grant The Times’s request to stay discovery pending its resolution of that motion, the
Court specifically inquired whether a decision granting such a motion would prompt the filing of
an amended complaint. Counsel for Mrs. Palin represented that, in that event, no such
amendment would be tendered because Mrs. Palin did not possess “any additional facts of
malice.” See July 7, 2017 Tr. (“7.17 Tr.”) at 7:7-18. The Court then granted The Times’s
request to stay discovery. Id. at 10:20-21.
In its subsequently filed motion, The Times demonstrated that Mrs. Palin’s contention
that it had published the challenged statements with actual malice was premised on a series of
2

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 9 of 30

implausible assumptions and strained inferences: i.e., the supposition that members of The
Times’s Editorial Board, because they politically oppose and personally dislike Mrs. Palin,
deliberately published false and defamatory statements about her alongside (and while linking to)
other publications that would instantly alert readers to their falsity, and then promptly corrected
those statements when their scheme to defame Mrs. Palin inevitably failed, all in the hope that
one passing mention of her name deep in the text of an editorial that was not otherwise about her
would nevertheless draw a multitude of online readers and result in additional advertising
revenue. In opposing the motion, Mrs. Palin urged that her pleadings plausibly alleged precisely
those facts. Mem. in Opp.to Def.’s Mot.to Dismiss, Dkt. 29 (“MTD Opp.”) at 14-21.1
On August 10, shortly after hearing argument on The Times’s motion, the Court issued
an Order convening a hearing pursuant to Rule 43(c) to assist in addressing the “plausibility”
issue. Order, Dkt. 35. “To a large extent,” the Court explained, “determination of that issue may
turn on what inferences favorable to the plaintiff are reasonable given the circumstances alleged
in the Complaint.” Id. at 1. Thus, “to help inform the Court of what inferences are reasonable or
unreasonable in this context,” the Order directed The Times to produce at the hearing the author
of the challenged statements, who The Times identified as Editorial Page Editor James Bennet.
Id. at 2. Neither party objected to this procedure, Aug. 16, 2017 Tr. (“8.16 Tr.”) at 72:23-25,
75:21-24, which, as a practical matter, afforded Mrs. Palin an additional opportunity to attempt
to develop a factual predicate supporting a plausible claim of actual malice.

1

Mrs. Palin argued that her thesis was further supported by allegations that The Times failed to
heed other articles it published on the same topic, MTD Opp. at 17-19; Compl. ¶¶ 4, 5, 41-47,
67-68; violated its own and otherwise accepted journalistic standards, MTD Opp. at 19-20;
Compl. ¶¶ 6, 69-72, 81; and failed “meaningfully” to retract or correct the challenged statements,
MTD Opp. at 20-21; Compl. ¶¶ 49-66.

3

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 10 of 30

Prior to the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to exchange any exhibits they proposed
to introduce in connection with Mr. Bennet’s testimony. Mrs. Palin initially designated some 56
exhibits, reducing that number to 32 on the eve of the hearing. At the Court’s request, The
Times produced to Mrs. Palin an initial draft of the challenged editorial that had been prepared
by Mr. Bennet’s colleague Elizabeth Williamson. On August 16, Mr. Bennet testified at the
hearing, at which time he was questioned by counsel for the parties and by the Court. Id. at 3:810. Following Mr. Bennet’s testimony, the Court asked counsel if either party wished to take
testimony from Ms. Williamson. Id. at 72:1-6. Mrs. Palin opted not to seek such testimony. Id.
at 73:4-20 (requiring Ms. Palin to submit a letter if she wished to call Ms. Williamson, which
was never submitted).
At the close of the hearing, the Court ordered supplemental briefing for the express
purpose of assessing how the testimony and other evidence adduced at the hearing affected the
question of whether Mrs. Palin could plausibly allege that the challenged statements were
published with actual malice. Id. at 73:21-74:7. At the same time, the Court asked The Times to
produce to Mrs. Palin additional documents referenced by Mr. Bennet in his testimony, a request
with which The Times promptly complied. Id. at 79:1-25. In seeking such briefing, the Court
reiterated that the purpose of the hearing was not to adjudicate disputed facts or to make
credibility determinations, but rather to assess “what is a plausible possibility and what is not a
plausible possibility in this so far as a motion to dismiss is concerned.” Id. at 74:3-6.
On August 21, the parties submitted their supplemental briefs. In her submission, Mrs.
Palin recognized that, to assess the plausibility of a complaint’s allegations on a motion to
dismiss, “[t]rial courts are permitted to consider a limited universe of documents and information
extraneous to the complaint to evaluate context,” including by permitting “limited plausibility

4

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 11 of 30

discovery or, as was the case here, to conduct a plausibility hearing to assist the court in its
gatekeeping role.” See Pl.’s Mem. of Law on Context, Inferences and Plausibility, Dkt. 40, at 12. Proceeding from this premise, Mrs. Palin argued that the combination of the facts pled in her
complaint, Mr. Bennet’s testimony at the hearing, and the documents that she had designated as
exhibits along with those that The Times had produced, yielded a sufficient basis for her
plausibly to allege, inter alia, that:


Mr. Bennet (and thus The Times) had an “inferred actual knowledge” of
prior press reports demonstrating the falsity of the challenged statements,
both in The Times and in The Atlantic, at which he had previously served
as its editor, id. at 5-6;



Mr. Bennet had a “pre-determined theory” about Mrs. Palin’s role in
inciting the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, which he was determined
to expound regardless of its accuracy, id. at 4-5;



Mr. Bennet was motivated to do so both because of his desire to increase
advertising revenue by portraying Mrs. Palin in an unfavorable manner
and because Mr. Bennet disagrees with Mrs. Palin politically and dislikes
her personally, id. at 8-10; and



Mr. Bennet’s personal animus was fueled specifically by the fact that his
brother is a United States Senator who belongs to a different political party
than Mrs. Palin and who holds views contrary to hers (particularly about
gun control) and had received threats of violence as a result, id. at 5 n.22.

Mrs. Palin’s supplemental brief was accompanied by a declaration that contained 34 exhibits.
Declaration of Shane B. Vogt, Dkt. 41 (“Vogt Decl.”).2
On August 29, 2017, the Court issued its Opinion and Order dismissing the Complaint.
In it, the Court concluded that Mrs. Palin was unable plausibly to allege actual malice,
emphasizing that it had considered not just the well pleaded allegations of the Complaint, but

2

On August 22, the day after she submitted her supplemental brief, Mrs. Palin requested
permission to submit an additional brief. Over The Times’s objection, the Court granted her
request and Mrs. Palin filed a further supplemental memorandum on August 22, 2017. Pl.’s
Reply to Response to Motion, Dkt. 43.

5

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 12 of 30

also the evidence adduced at the hearing and the arguments based on that evidence contained in
Mrs. Palin’s supplemental briefs. As the Court explained, “plaintiff’s complaint, even when
supplemented by facts developed at an evidentiary hearing convened by the Court” failed to
make a plausible showing of actual malice. Op. at 1 (emphasis added). The Court specifically
assessed the new “facts” that Mrs. Palin identified in her supplemental briefs and concluded that
each and every item of alleged support for plaintiff’s claim of actual malice
consists either of gross supposition or of evidence so weak that, even together,
these items cannot support the high degree of particularized proof that must be
provided before plaintiff can be said to have adequately alleged clear and
convincing evidence of actual malice.
Id. at 25. In so concluding, the Court expressly considered the inferences Mrs. Palin drew from
Mr. Bennet’s testimony to support her assertion that he “actually knew, or recklessly
disregarded, that his editorial statements were false, because of prior articles in the Times and the
Atlantic … that he presumably read and that disclaimed any link between the SarahPAC Map
and the Loughner Shooting,” id. at 22, rejecting the proffered inferences that Mr. Bennet had
these prior reports in mind when he wrote the challenged statements as unpersuasive “lawyers’
arguments.” Id.3 Ultimately, the Court concluded that, “[b]ecause … this Court has canvassed
in the discussion above all the various additions that plaintiff has even remotely suggested it
would include in an amended complaint, the dismissal is ‘with prejudice,’ that is, final.” Id. at
25. Judgment was entered the following day. Judgment, Dkt. 46.
The instant motion was filed on September 25. Notice of Mot., Dkt. 51. Styled as a
“motion for reconsideration and to alter or amend the judgment,” it cites no specific, dispositive
3

The Court did not, as Mrs. Palin now asserts, “credit Mr. Bennet’s testimony” that he did not
recall these prior articles when he wrote the challenged statements. Mem. at 6. Rather, it
appropriately determined both that Mr. Bennet’s testimony provided no basis for Mrs. Palin to
draw a contrary inference, see Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., 466 U.S. 485, 511-14
(1984) (disbelief of author’s testimony does not warrant drawing contrary inference), and that the
proffered inference was demonstrably unreasonable in any event, see Op. at 22.

6

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 13 of 30

legal or factual issue allegedly overlooked by the Court. Rather, the motion asserts only that the
Court erred by dismissing the complaint with prejudice rather than with leave to amend, see
Mem. at 1, and contends that the attached 221-paragraph proposed Amended Complaint,
accompanied by 29 exhibits, plausibly alleges actual malice, id. at 1-2.
Although the proposed Amended Complaint includes Mr. Bennet in many places in
which its predecessor had referenced only The Times or its Editorial Board, it substantively
tracks the same allegations made in the Complaint and in Mrs. Palin’s supplemental briefs—i.e.,
it alleges that Mr. Bennet must have known the challenged statements were false because he
must have specifically remembered 2011 articles in The Atlantic and stories in The Times
reflecting a journalistic “consensus” to the contrary, id. at 10-11, 19-20; that he pursued a
preconceived story line he therefore knew to be false, id. at 12-14; that he did so because he was
motivated by a desire to increase advertising revenue and because of “bias” and “ill will” arising
from his own political views and those of his brother, id. at 14-15; that he and The Times
“refused to meaningfully retract” the Editorial, id. at 15-17; and that, in doing all of this, he
violated accepted journalistic standards, id. at 17-18.
ARGUMENT
I.

MRS. PALIN’S MOTION SEEKS TO RELITIGATE ISSUES THE COURT HAS
ALREADY DECIDED AND FAILS TO SATISFY THE STRICT STANDARDS
GOVERNING REQUESTS FOR RECONSIDERATION
Under the rules of this Court, motions for reconsideration require a memorandum “setting

forth concisely the matters or controlling decisions which counsel believes the Court has
overlooked.” L. Civ. R. 6.3. As the Second Circuit has instructed:
The standard for granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will
generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or
data that the court overlooked – matters, in other words, that might reasonably be
expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.

Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995); see In re Refco Secs. Litig., 2012
WL 607612, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2012) (Rakoff, J.) (denying reconsideration motion and
motion to amend because “Local Rule 6.3 should be ‘strictly applied so as to avoid repetitive
arguments on issues that have been considered fully by the Court’” (citation omitted)); Simon v.
Smith & Nephew, Inc., 18 F. Supp. 3d 423, 427 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (denying reconsideration and
motion for leave to file amended complaint where plaintiff “failed[ed] to point to any facts the
Court overlooked that would warrant reconsideration”); Cox v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 2009
WL 2634792, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2009) (“a plaintiff may not rescue his complaint by
inserting new or revised allegations in a motion for reconsideration”). In short, “post-judgment
motions for leave to replead must be evaluated with due regard to both the value of finality and
the policies embodied in Rule 15.” Williams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011).
And, as the Court of Appeals has emphasized, “[l]eave to amend is especially inappropriate
where . . . plaintiff’s proposed amendments [are] merely recycled versions of claims which had
already fallen victim to a motion to dismiss.” Bellikoff v. Eaton Vance Corp., 481 F.3d 110, 118
(2d Cir. 2007).
Mrs. Palin’s motion is just that. All of the factual allegations that were—or reasonably
could be—made in support of her contention that the challenged statements were published with
actual malice have already been fully considered by the Court. In its Order, the Court expressly
considered not only the allegations contained in the complaint itself but also the extensive
arguments made by Mrs. Palin in her supplemental briefs following the hearing, including “all
the various additions that plaintiff has even remotely suggested it would include in an amended
complaint.” Op. at 25. Those additions encompass all of the various species of allegations now
urged by Mrs. Palin on reconsideration. Compare Mem. at 10-11, 19-20 (alleging knowledge of

8

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 15 of 30

falsity by Mr. Bennet based on prior reports in The Times and The Atlantic and resulting
journalistic “consensus”), with Op. at 22, 24 (rejecting plausibility of same); compare Mem. at
12-14 (alleging preconceived story line and “purposeful avoidance” of the truth), with Op. at 20,
23 (rejecting plausibility of same); compare Mem. at 14-15 (alleging “bias, motive and ill will”),
with Op. at 18-19 (rejecting plausibility of same); compare Mem. at 15-16 (alleging “refus[al] to
meaningfully retract”), with Op. at 25 (rejecting plausibility of same); compare Mem. at 17-18
(alleging violation of journalistic standards), with Op. at 21 (rejecting plausibility of same); see
also Op. at 25 (rejecting “other alleged evidence of actual malice” as “too inconsequential to be
worth further discussion”).4
The sole error of law alleged by Mrs. Palin is her contention that the Court should not
have found amendment to be futile until “after a plaintiff has an opportunity to proffer an
amended complaint.” Mem. at 3. This contention not only ignores what actually happened in
this case, it is incorrect as a matter of law. The fundamental flaw in Mrs. Palin’s argument that
4

Although the proposed Amended Complaint includes a number of exhibits, all of them were
either already produced in advance of the plausibility hearing—including all of The Atlantic
articles that now feature prominently in Mrs. Palin’s motion for reconsideration—or could have
been. None represents the kind of newly discovered evidence not previously available to a
plaintiff that might properly be the subject of a reconsideration motion. Indeed, the overarching
notion advanced by Mrs. Palin—that the factual predicates for her “new” allegations did not and
could not have become known to her until after the close of supplemental briefing, see Mem. at
1-2—does not survive reasonable scrutiny. When Mrs. Palin filed her initial complaint, it was
certainly no secret that (1) Mr. Bennet was The Times’s Editorial Page Editor, (2) that he bore
overall responsibility for its editorials, or (3) that he had been editor of The Atlantic at the time of
the Arizona shooting. The articles from that era on which Mrs. Palin relied at the evidentiary
hearing, in her supplemental briefing, and then again in her proposed Amended Complaint were
all available to her before she filed her initial complaint. Especially given her repeated allegation
that it is reasonable to infer, from the mere fact that Mr. Bennet was once editor of The Atlantic,
that he not only was responsible for and therefore read every article that magazine published
during his tenure, but that he also committed them to memory, id. at 10-11 (summarizing
allegations), there is no reasonable basis for Mrs. Palin now to claim, as she does in this motion,
see Mem. at 1-2, that Mr. Bennet’s involvement in the editorial’s publication, his prior role at
The Atlantic, or that magazine’s publication of articles about the Arizona shooting came as a
surprise to her.

9

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 16 of 30

she “should be given a meaningful opportunity to plead her case,” id. at 1, is that she has already
been afforded just such an opportunity. Although Mrs. Palin expressly disclaimed any desire to
amend her complaint at the Initial Pretrial Conference, precisely because she was aware of no
additional relevant facts that could be pleaded in good faith, 7.17 Tr. at 7:7-18, the Court
nevertheless provided her an opportunity both (a) to amass such facts by holding an evidentiary
hearing and (b) to submit multiple supplemental briefs setting out why she believed she could—
in the wake of that hearing—plausibly allege actual malice. As a practical matter, the
supplemental briefs served the same function as the motion for leave to file an amended
complaint Mrs. Palin now claims she was deprived of the ability to make: It afforded her a full
and fair opportunity to identify for the Court facts plausibly establishing her claim prior to any
decision that it should be dismissed with prejudice.
As a matter of law, Mrs. Palin is entitled to nothing more. In SPV OSUS Ltd. v. AIA LLC,
for example, this Court dismissed claims with prejudice after granting plaintiff leave to file a
letter identifying what supplemental allegations it would make if afforded an opportunity to
replead. 2016 WL 3039192, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2016) (Rakoff, J.) (cited at Mem. at 4),
appeal docketed sub nom. SPS OSUS Ltd. v. UBS AG, No. 16-2173 (2d Cir. June 24, 2016). The
Court dismissed the claim with prejudice because the resulting submission, taken together with
alternate theories proffered in the plaintiff’s briefing, was insufficient to plead a required element
of the claim. Id. Similarly, in Smith v. Stevens, the Court entertained a faxed submission on a
key factual point, but dismissed the claim with prejudice because the submission only confirmed
the implausibility of the complaint’s allegations. 957 F. Supp. 2d 466, 470-71 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)
(Rakoff, J.) (cited at Mem. at 4). And, in Tabaei v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp.,
when counsel for a plaintiff orally sought leave to amend at a hearing on a motion to dismiss, the

10

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 17 of 30

Court asked counsel to identify those additional facts that would save its claim and, because “few
were mentioned and none was material,” dismissed the case with prejudice. 2011 WL 6778500,
at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2011) (Rakoff, J.) (cited at Mem. at 4).
In this case, the Court did not—as Mrs. Palin now asserts—evaluate the validity of an
amended pleading based on its own “improper speculation” about what that pleading might
allege. Mem. at 4. Rather, the Court considered her counsel’s examination of Mr. Bennet at the
evidentiary hearing (as well as its own examination of the witness), the exhibits she proffered in
connection with that hearing, and Mrs. Palin’s own arguments based on that evidence, which
were set out in detail in her supplemental briefs and the 34 exhibits she submitted along with
them. Op. at 25. This was not a “limited” or otherwise “truncated” process. Mem. at 2, 5.
Where, as here, the Court “canvassed … all the various additions that plaintiff has even remotely
suggested it would include in an amended complaint” and found them insufficient as a matter of
law, Op. at 25, dismissal with prejudice is entirely appropriate. See Porat v. Lincoln Towers
Cmty. Ass’n, 464 F.3d 274, 276 (2d Cir. 2006) (no error to dismiss with prejudice where
plaintiff’s counsel “fail[ed] . . . to make a showing that the complaint’s defects can be cured”);
Hayden v. Cty. of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[W]here the plaintiff is unable to
demonstrate that he would be able to amend his complaint in a manner which would survive
dismissal, opportunity to replead is rightfully denied.”); see also Van Buskirk v. N.Y. Times Co.,
325 F.3d 87, 92 (2d Cir. 2003); Lopez v. Ctpartners Exec. Search Inc., 173 F. Supp. 3d 12, 43
(S.D.N.Y. 2016) (liberal repleading rules do not “require that a plaintiff receive, as a matter of
course, repeated judicial decisions on the same motion”).

II.

AMENDMENT WOULD BE FUTILE BECAUSE THE PROPOSED AMENDED
COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM
Even if the proposed Amended Complaint is considered on its merits, it fails for the same

reason as its predecessor—it does not plausibly allege “sufficient particularized facts” to “prove
by ‘clear and convincing evidence’ that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with
‘actual malice’—that is, with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard
as to their falsity.” Op. at 15-16 (citations omitted). Thus, the proposed amendment would be
“futile,” and Mrs. Palin’s motion is properly denied on this basis as well.
A.

The Court Is Not Required to Credit All Allegations in a Complaint, No
Matter How Implausible, Unreasonable, or Conclusory

Mrs. Palin’s contention that her proposed Amended Complaint plausibly alleges actual
malice is premised squarely on her assertion that the Court is “duty-bound . . . to accept as true
Mrs. Palin’s allegations that Mr. Bennet knew about and recalled The New York Times and The
Atlantic articles and the consensus among journalists which demonstrated that Mr. Bennet’s
statements about Mrs. Palin were false.” Mem. at 7. Mrs. Palin is wrong about this and her
misapprehension of the requirements imposed by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is fatal to her
claim.
As the Supreme Court has explained, “[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550
U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content
that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the
misconduct alleged.” Id. (emphasis added). In other words, the well-pleaded “[f]actual
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” Twombly, 550
U.S. at 555. As the First Circuit has explained, in a decision similarly assessing the plausibility
12

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 19 of 30

of a plaintiff’s allegations of actual malice, “[p]lausible . . . means something more than merely
possible, and gauging a pleaded situation’s plausibility is a ‘context-specific’ job that compels us
‘to draw on’ our ‘judicial experience and common sense.’” Schatz v. Republican State
Leadership Comm., 669 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679).
In making the plausibility assessment required by Iqbal and Twombly, a court is not
“duty-bound” to accept all of the complaint’s allegations that the plaintiff denominates as
“facts.” Mem. at 7. For one thing, courts are not obliged to accept factual allegations that are
themselves demonstrably implausible or speculative. See, e.g., Levine v. FDIC, 2 F.3d 476, 479
(2d Cir. 1993) (“the creativity of an attorney may not transcend the facts of a given case”)
(citation omitted). Indeed, long before Iqbal and Twombly, courts rejected factual allegations
that were “pure conjecture.” Bozzuto v. Sarra, 2001 WL 266028, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 12,
2001) (denying leave to amend where new allegations were “wholly fanciful”); see also
Sourceone Healthcare Techs., Inc. v. Bensonhurst Imaging Assocs. Mgmt. LLC, 2008 WL
2697324, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 2, 2008) (“[A] party cannot allege facts to make out the substance
of a claim when it has an insufficient basis to make those allegations in the hope that discovery
may fortuitously give it a good faith basis, unless it has reason to believe that will in fact
occur.”).5
5

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have long proceeded from the premise that the “factual
contentions” made in a complaint must “have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified,
will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or
discovery.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3). While a plaintiff is not required to know all potentially
relevant facts prior to filing its pleading, “a complaint must always be based ‘on more than pure
speculation and fantasy.’” Murphy v. Cuomo, 913 F. Supp. 671, 683 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) (quoting
In re Keegan Mgmt. Co. Sec. Litig., 154 F.R.D. 237, 241 (N.D. Cal. 1994)); see also Landesman
v. City of N.Y., 501 F. Supp. 837, 840 (E.D.N.Y. 1980) (“Careful examination of the complaint
reveals that, with respect to defendants . . . it is based wholly on speculation and conjecture and
is an artful attempt to satisfy the pleading requirements of the federal rules while avoiding the
proscriptions of Rule 11.”).

13

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 20 of 30

Following Iqbal and Twombly, courts have similarly rejected factual allegations that are
themselves implausible or otherwise contrary to “common sense.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. In
one recent defamation case, for example, the court granted a motion to dismiss because the
complaint’s allegation that the defendant published a challenged article with an intent to defame
him was premised on the implausible factual allegation that, despite the article’s attribution of
the alleged defamation to an unnamed government official, there was actually no source because,
the complaint alleged, “no Justice Department official would have leaked the allegedly
defamatory quotes.” Cabello-Rondon v. Dow Jones & Co., 2017 WL 3531551, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.
Aug. 16, 2017), appeal docketed, No. 17-2895 (2d Cir. Sept. 18, 2017); accord, McNaughton v.
De Blasio, 644 F. App’x 32, 33 (2d Cir. 2016) (plaintiff’s “allegations of a conspiracy spanning
several years and involving his sister, two separate police departments, dozens of police officers,
and numerous underage children [were] implausible and conclusory,” and, therefore, “[n]one of
his allegations against any of the defendants satisfy the pleading standard of Twombly that
McNaughton, as a lawyer, was required to meet.”); Gallop v. Cheney, 642 F.3d 364, 369-70 (2d
Cir. 2011) (affirming dismissal where complaint’s allegations that government officials had
engaged in a conspiracy to violate her constitutional rights were “factually frivolous”).
The kinds of allegations that may properly be rejected as implausible include those that
are internally contradictory, see, e.g., Combier v. New York, 2010 WL 3785130, at *12
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2010) (rejecting contradictory allegations made in a complaint as “totally
implausible”), report and recommendation adopted, 2010 WL 3835030 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2010);
Hopper v. Banana Republic, LLC, 2008 WL 490613, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2008) (rejecting
factual allegations in complaint as “inherently contradictory and therefore implausible”), as well
as those that are demonstrably false based on matters of which the court may properly take

14

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 21 of 30

judicial notice, see Kendall v. Cuomo, 2013 WL 5425780, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2013)
(taking judicial notice of valid court order and dismissing claim based on allegation that such
order did not exist). Similarly, in adjudicating a motion to dismiss, courts need not accept
factual allegations that are conclusory, a proposition that is especially well taken in defamation
cases, like this one, where the actual malice inquiry necessarily focuses on the defendant’s state
of mind. See Biro v. Conde Nast, 963 F. Supp. 2d 255, 279-80 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff’d, 807 F.3d
541 (2d Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 2015 (2016).6
By the same token, courts are not obliged to credit unreasonable inferences or chains of
inferences represented in a complaint to be “fact.” Put another way, “in ruling on a motion to
dismiss, courts are [only] required to ‘draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.’
The obvious inverse of that rule is that courts need not draw unreasonable inferences in the
plaintiff’s favor.” Nungesser v. Columbia Univ., 244 F. Supp. 3d 345, 354 n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 2017)
(quoting Doe v. Columbia Univ., 831 F.3d 46, 48 (2d Cir. 2016)). This is particularly so when
those unreasonable inferences are stacked one upon the other, taking the pleader far from the
underlying factual allegations. See, e.g., RSM Prod.Corp. v. Fridman, 643 F. Supp. 2d 382, 413
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (dismissing complaint without leave to replead where the proposed amended
pleading “is devoid of factual support for each of the causes of action alleged therein and is,
instead, based almost entirely on speculation and inference stacked upon inference”), aff’d, 387
6

See also Shay v. Walters, 702 F.3d 76, 82 (1st Cir. 2012) (“While the plaintiff’s complaint
contains conclusory allegations about ‘ill-will’ and ‘actual malice,’ it contains no factual
assertions that in any way lend plausibility to these conclusions.”); Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev,
2011 WL 6097136, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2011) (rejecting conclusory allegations of actual
malice); see also, e.g., Glob. Packaging Servs., LLC v. Glob. Printing & Packaging, --- F. Supp.
3d ---, 2017 WL 1232731, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2017) (recognizing that court “is not
required to accept conclusory allegations—particularly allegations such as those asserted here,
characterizing or attributing a state of mind of another person,” and dismissing tortious
interference claim based on allegations that defendant “intentionally interfered with those
relationships” and “acted with the sole purpose of harming Plaintiff”).

15

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 22 of 30

F. App’x 72 (2d Cir. 2010). For this reason, courts have emphatically rejected efforts to
“reverse-engineer” a complaint based on the stacking of inferences on top of a modest factual
predicate to arrive at a set of “facts” that purports to state a valid claim. United States ex. Rel.
Ceas v. Chrysler Grp. LLC, 78 F. Supp. 3d 869, 882 (N.D. Ill. 2015); accord, Saenz v. Ledbetter,
2017 WL 2626987, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June 15, 2017) (holding that because complaint’s “allegation
of Defendant’s invidious purpose can only pass muster with ‘unreasonable inferences’ and
‘unwarranted deductions,’” it failed to state a viable claim).
Perhaps most significantly, courts have recognized that a complaint’s factual allegations
should be rejected as implausible when there is an “obvious alternative explanation” for them.
See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 682; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567. In Iqbal itself, the Supreme Court
considered a claim that the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI violated plaintiff’s
constitutional rights by mistreating him on the basis of his race and religion. 556 U.S. at 669.
The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint, in significant part, because there was an “obvious
alternative explanation” for what plaintiff had experienced:
The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who
counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic
fundamentalist group. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim—Osama
bin Laden—and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It should
come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest
and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would
produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose
of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respondent
alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his
nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United
States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist
acts. As between that “obvious alternative explanation” for the arrests, and the
purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer, discrimination is
not a plausible conclusion.
Id. at 682 (citations omitted); see also Barsky v. Spiegel Accountancy Corp., 2015 WL 580574,
at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 11, 2015) (“None of the schemes alleged above are plausible when

16

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 23 of 30

compared to the obvious alternative explanations that Defendants simply made an inadvertent
mistake and/or were following the instructions of their clients . . . . It is not plausible that
Defendants would file a correct form, then deliberately change the form to an incorrect amount,
and then change the form again to the correct amount, as part of a scheme to defraud.”).7
B.

The Proposed Amended Complaint Fails to Plead a Plausible Claim of
Actual Malice

Stripped of its implausible, speculative, contradictory, and conclusory allegations, as well
as the wholly unreasonable inferences that Mrs. Palin draws from them, the proposed Amended
Complaint fails to state a viable claim. Indeed, to a significant extent, the allegations contained
in Mrs. Palin’s proposed amended pleading are identical to those that the Court has already
considered, and rejected, in its predecessor. Thus, for example, the proposed Amended
Complaint’s allegations that The Times (1) had an “economic motive” to defame Mrs. Palin;
(2) failed to follow its own and generally accepted journalistic standards; and (3) declined to
make a “meaningful” retraction all remain largely unchanged from the initial complaint and have
already been directly addressed by this Court. Op. at 19-21, 25. The proposed Amended
Complaint’s remaining allegations with respect to actual malice, although plainly embellished
from their previous formulation in Mrs. Palin’s supplemental briefs, remain essentially the
same—i.e., that The Times, through Mr. Bennet, (1) published the challenged statements with
7

Accord, Eclectic Properties E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990, 999 (9th Cir.
2014) (affirming dismissal where “Plaintiffs’ fraud theory is not plausible when considered in
light of the innocent explanation that failure of franchise businesses in making rental payments,
and their abandonment of leases, took place in the context of a deep national recession”); Davila
v. Johnson, 2015 WL 8968357, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2015) (rejecting as implausible
conspiracy claim based on allegation that individual complained to police that Petitioner was an
attorney, despite the allegation that he had never said as much to that individual, because of the
obvious alternative explanations that “Ms. Martinez misunderstood Petitioner or lied to the
police of her own initiative”); High Falls Brewing Co., LLC v. Boston Beer Corp., 852 F. Supp.
2d 306, 322-23 (W.D.N.Y. 2011) (rejecting proposed counterclaim because allegations were
“not plausible in light of the more likely and eminently more plausible view of the facts”).

17

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 24 of 30

knowledge of their falsity because he was aware of prior and contemporaneous publications that
contradicted them and (2) that he did so because he disliked Mrs. Palin, disagreed with her policy
positions, especially with respect to the Second Amendment, and viewed his brother as her
political adversary. As The Times has demonstrated, see supra pp. 8-10, the Court has already
considered and rejected these allegations as well, see Op. at 19-25.
Upon examination, the proposed Amended Complaint differs from Mrs. Palin’s previous
formulations in only one respect—it doubles down on the “gross supposition” contained in her
initial complaint and post-hearing briefs, supplementing it with a host of ostensibly “new”
allegations she claims renders plausible her overarching contention that the challenged
statements were published with actual malice. However, these new allegations, like their
predecessors, consist of an admixture of implausible, inherently speculative, contradictory and/or
conclusory assertions, as well as a host of unreasonable inferences premised upon them. They
cannot, therefore, serve as the basis for a plausible claim that The Times published the
challenged statements with actual malice.
Specifically, the proposed Amended Complaint’s effort to bolster Mrs. Palin’s contention
that Mr. Bennet published the challenged statements with actual knowledge that they were false
or purposely avoided the truth in the course of publishing them is plainly implausible.8 To make
8

Separate and apart from these theories of liability, both the proposed Amended Complaint and
Mrs. Palin’s motion make the demonstrably incorrect assertion that she can secure a judgment
based on a showing that Mr. Bennet engaged in “highly unreasonable conduct constituting an
extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by
responsible publishers.” Am. Compl. ¶ 172; Mem. at 18 (quoting Curtis Publ’g Co. v. Butts, 388
U.S. 130, 155 (1967) (plurality opinion)). As the U.S. Supreme Court explained more than 25
years ago:
The language . . . discussing professional standards is taken from Justice Harlan’s
plurality opinion in Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts . . . . This proposed standard,
however, was emphatically rejected by a majority of the Court in favor of the
stricter New York Times actual malice rule.
18

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 25 of 30

this case, the proposed Amended Complaint proceeds from the predicate that Mr. Bennet edited
The Atlantic at the time of the Arizona shooting when the magazine published “numerous
articles” about it. Vogt Decl., Ex. A (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 7, 54, 57-67. It then sets out a series of
inferences, ostensibly drawn from that otherwise unobjectionable fact, including, inter alia, that
those articles “established there was no established link between the Palin Map and Loughner’s
crime,” id. ¶ 153, and that Mr. Bennet not only “read about and committed” those articles “to
memory,” id. ¶ 155, but that he was also aware of a national journalistic “consensus,” reached
within days of the Arizona shooting, that Mr. Loughner had never seen the Crosshairs Map, id.
¶¶ 5, 65, 155. None of these allegations withstand analysis.
Needless to say, the assertion that Mr. Bennet committed to memory lengthy articles
published years before the challenged editorial was published is absurd and cannot conceivably
have a good faith basis in fact. And, as the Court has already explained, the notion that Mr.
Bennet had those articles in mind when he wrote the challenged statements is itself implausible.
See, e.g., Op. at 22 (“[A]ll these articles appeared years earlier, and there is no reason to suppose
that, even if Bennet had read them at the time, he would necessarily remember their
conclusions.”).9 Indeed, the proposed Amended Complaint alleges not just that Mr. Bennet read

Harte-Hanks Commc’ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 665-66 (1989) (citations omitted)
(emphasis added). Thus, “[t]oday, there is no question that public figure libel cases are
controlled by the New York Times standard and not by the professional standards rule.” Id. at
666; see also Robert D. Sack, Sack on Defamation § 5:5.2[B] (4th ed. 2010) (actual malice is not
shown by evidence “that the defendant journalist ‘violated journalism ethics,’ and the article
does not ‘hold[] up to normal standards of investigative reporting’”).
9

Similarly unreasonable is the proposed Amended Complaint’s proffered inference that, simply
because he served as its editor, Mr. Bennet was not only aware of, but endorsed the views
expressed in each of the articles published in The Atlantic during his tenure. See, e.g., Am.
Compl. ¶ 56 (alleging that “Mr. Bennet knew about and approved of Mr. Sullivan’s ‘TrigTrutherism’ campaign”). By that implausible logic, Mr. Bennet must be deemed to “approve of”
directly contradictory views expressed not only by The Atlantic’s many contributing authors
19

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 26 of 30

and memorized articles published in The Atlantic, but that he read and memorized the hyperlinks
within those articles—and even hyperlinks within those hyperlinks. See, e.g., Am. Compl.
¶¶ 63-64 (relying on a hyperlink within an Atlantic article to a National Review article—and then
a hyperlink within that National Review article to article in The Times).
Moreover, the Court properly can—and already did—take judicial notice that there is no
national journalistic “consensus” about the relationship, if any, between the Crosshairs Map and
the Arizona shooting, much less one reached “[w]ithin days” after that tragedy. Id. ¶ 65. For
one thing, articles published years after that event continue to invoke the map when discussing,
as the challenged editorial did, the relationship between “fiery rhetoric” and politically inspired
violence.10 Indeed, many of the articles attached as exhibits to the proposed Amended
Complaint themselves raise questions about whether or not Loughner was politically motivated
and whether political rhetoric, including specifically the Crosshairs Map, was at least in part to
blame. See articles cited at id. ¶¶ 57, 58, 59(a)-(b), 61-64. The Court has already recognized
both that “there were also articles that appeared shortly after the Loughner shooting that drew
contrary conclusions,” Op. at 22 (citing Compl. ¶ 24), and that even the previously published
editorials and column in The Times emailed to Ms. Williamson11 and copied to Mr. Bennet prior

during his tenure there, but also those published on The Times’s’ editorial pages, including those
vigorously advocating, inter alia, against gun control legislation.
10

See, e.g., Petula Dvorak, “Fiery rhetoric a close relative of violence,” Wash. Post (Dec. 1,
2015) at B.1 (citing the Crosshairs Map and decrying leaders who “incite and inflame with fiery
speeches” even when that “may not be their intent”); Robin Marty, “Donald Trump Acts Like
Words Don’t Matter. They Do,” Cosmopolitan (Aug. 10, 2016) (linking the Crosshairs Map and
“‘Second Amendment remedies’” like the Giffords shooting); Clay Jones, “‘Second Amendment
People,’” The (Utah) Independent (Aug. 10, 2016) (“Democratic U.S. Representative Gabby
Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head by Jared Lee Loughner after Sarah Palin published a
bulls-eye on her district.”).
11

The proposed Amended Complaint’s multiple references to Ms. Williamson’s conduct and
state of mind, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 92, 96, warrant specific mention. Having affirmatively
20

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 27 of 30

to the challenged editorial’s publication “do not contradict [Mr. Bennet’s] thesis nearly as much
as plaintiff suggests”—rather, in many cases, they “contain some language tending to
corroborate parts of the challenged statements.” Id. at 23-24.12
Perhaps most significantly, the proposed Amended Complaint’s allegations that Mr.
Bennet knowingly endorsed this purported journalistic “consensus” in the pages of The Atlantic
on multiple occasions, even if credited, cannot be reconciled with its parallel contention that he
was motivated to publish defamatory falsehoods about Mrs. Palin because of his long-simmering
personal animus toward her based on their differing politics. If that were the case, Mr. Bennet
surely would not have approved for publication in The Atlantic “numerous articles” that
exonerated her from any responsibility for the Arizona shooting.
In that regard, the proposed Amended Complaint’s newly enhanced allegation that Mr.
Bennet “harbors deep-seeded resentment and animus toward Mrs. Palin and her political views”
is demonstrably implausible. See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 49, 52, 53, 71, 160, 168. The only
“facts” offered in support of this conclusory assertion are (1) that Mr. Bennet is himself an
“ardent” and “outspoken advocate for gun control,” id. ¶¶ 3, 49 (emphasis added), (2) that he has
worked for what Mrs. Palin characterizes as “liberal” publications, id. ¶ 168, and (3) that his
brother, a United States Senator from a different political party than hers, was once threatened
with violence because of his political views, id. ¶¶ 45-48. The proposed Amended Complaint

declined an opportunity to take her testimony with respect to those very subjects, 8.16 Tr. at
73:4-20, the proposed amendment’s factual representations about what Ms. Williamson did and
thought are the very definition of unbridled speculation devoid of a good faith basis in fact.
12

Such ongoing debate underscores that there was nothing “inherently implausible” about the
challenged statements—despite the Amended Complaint’s conclusory allegations to the contrary.
See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 65, 174. The Crosshairs Map employed gun imagery; Rep. Giffords was
specifically identified in the Map; she complained of receiving increased threats of violence as a
result of the Map; and Loughner targeted her at a campaign event not long thereafter.

21

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 28 of 30

offers no factual basis at all for the first assertion, which is itself remarkable given that Mr.
Bennet has spent his career writing for the public. If he held such purportedly deep-seated
loathing for all politicians who opposed gun control, it is implausible he would not have proudly
revealed it—in his own name—on the pages of one of the “liberal” publications for which he has
written. As for the latter two assertions, they not only fail to carry the weight Mrs. Palin places
on them—i.e., the plainly unreasonable inference that Mr. Bennet harbored “deep-seeded
resentment and animus” toward Mrs. Palin merely because he and his brother hold different
political views than she does—a virtually identical version of this contention was proffered in
Mrs. Palin’s supplemental briefs and properly rejected by this Court, for good reason: “If such
political opposition counted as evidence of actual malice, the protections imposed by Sullivan
and its progeny would swiftly become a nullity.” Op. at 19.
At bottom, therefore, the narrative set out in the proposed Amended Complaint is, at best,
internally contradictory and inherently implausible. According to that pleading: Mr. Bennet
hated Republicans generally, and Mrs. Palin specifically, long before the Arizona shooting;
despite this blinding hatred, he oversaw, approved, and subsequently memorized a large number
of articles that conclusively stated that there was no link between Loughner and the Crosshairs
Map; while overseeing the publication of these articles during his brother’s political rise, Mr.
Bennet did nothing to act on his hatred or to slander Mrs. Palin for many years; indeed, six years
later, Mr. Bennet oversaw and approved the publication of several columns in The Times that
similarly reflected this journalistic consensus; then, seizing his long-delayed moment, Mr.
Bennet suddenly wrote an editorial and in its sixth paragraph embedded a defamatory falsehood
about Mrs. Palin, all in an effort to act on his animus toward her and reap profits for The Times.

22

Case 1:17-cv-04853-JSR Document 59 Filed 10/09/17 Page 29 of 30

In the last analysis, the proposed Amended Complaint requires the Court to indulge
inference upon unreasonable inference and, contrary to common sense, endorse a factual
scenario that is the very definition of implausible—especially when compared to the “obvious
alternative explanation,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 682; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567, already articulated
by this Court:
What we have here is an editorial, written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice
an opinion on an immediate event of importance, in which are included a few
factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to Mrs. Palin that are very rapidly
corrected. Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is
not.
Op. at 25.
CONCLUSION
The Times respectfully submits that, for all of the foregoing reasons, leave to file the
proposed Amended Complaint would be futile and that Mrs. Palin’s motion for reconsideration
and to alter or amend the judgment should be denied.
