Motion for Summary Judgment
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, the Plaintiff Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission moves for summary judgment on the grounds
that there is no material factual dispute that the Defendant discharged
Aimee Stephens because of sex.
The Commission further states neither the First Amendment to the
Constitution nor the Religious Freedom Restoration Act authorizes the
discharge of employees on the basis of sex, thus Defendant’s affirmative
defenses must fail as a matter of law.
Finally, the Commission states that there is no material factual
dispute with respect to Defendant’s clothing allowance, which provided

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 2 of 50

Pg ID 592

free clothing benefits to male employees and nothing to females until
October 2014. Since that time, Defendant has provided stipends to
women which are less than the value of the benefit provided to men. Both
fringe-benefit policies constitute sex discrimination in violation of Title
VII.
The Commission respectfully directs the Court to the attached
memorandum for the arguments supporting this Motion.
The Commission sought concurrence in this motion from defense
counsel on February 1, 2016 and said concurrence was denied.
Wherefore, the Commission respectfully moves for summary
judgment in its favor.

Statement of the Issues
1. Title VII is a neutral rule of general applicability which applies to
businesses operated by non-religious and religious persons alike.
Does the Commission’s attempt to vindicate Aimee Stephens’s Title
VII rights violate Defendant’s rights under the First Amendment
Free Exercise Clause?
The Commission answers “No.”
2. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act prohibits the government
from substantially burdening a sincere religious exercise unless
such is done in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest
and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
Defendant admits that it would not have had to change any of its
religious practices if it had continued to employ Stephens, and has
only asserted that Rost’s beliefs have been impinged upon.
Protection of the Title VII rights of employees is a compelling
governmental interest, and Title VII is precisely tailored to further
that interest. Does RFRA trump this enforcement action under
Title VII?
The Commission answers “No.”
3. The Defendant’s owner and sole decisionmaker has admitted that
his decision to fire Aimee Stephens was motivated by his beliefs
and attitudes about how men and women are supposed to act and
present themselves. Are these testimonial admissions sufficient to
warrant summary judgment in favor of the Commission as to
liability for Aimee Stephens’s termination?
The Commission answers “Yes.”
4. Until October 2014, Defendant provided a fringe benefit by which
male employees were granted a clothing allowance of suits and ties
free of charge, including free replacements as they wore out,
iv

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 8 of 50

Pg ID 598

whereas female employees were given nothing. The approximate
value of a suit and tie is $235. Since October 2014, the female
employees have been given annual stipends of either $75 or $150
depending upon whether they are part- or full-time, while the male
employee benefit has remained the same. Do the pre- and
post-October 2014 fringe benefit policies violate Title VII,
warranting summary judgment in favor of the Commission?
The Commission answers “Yes.”

INTRODUCTION
A.

Overview of the Case.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought this
Title VII case alleging sex discrimination. The case stems from a Charge
filed by Aimee Stephens, who is a transgender woman and served as a
funeral director/embalmer for the Defendant for nearly six years under
the name of Anthony Stephens. It is undisputed that Stephens was a
capable, competent employee who was not fired for performance reasons.
The Commission’s Complaint alleged, inter alia, that the
Defendant discharged her because she did not conform to the
Defendant’s sex-based stereotypes. Despite being a good employee, she
was fired after giving the Defendant’s owner, Thomas Rost, a letter
describing her life struggles with gender-identity issues and stating her
intention to present at work as a woman in appropriate business attire.
Ex. A, Stephens Letter.
Rost responded two weeks later by handing Stephens a severance
agreement. Ex. B, Rost 30(b)(6) Dep. at 126:1-8. “[T]he specific reason”
Rost fired Stephens was that Stephens was going to present as a female:
1

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 16 of 50

Pg ID 606

“he [Stephens] was no longer going to represent himself as a man. He
wanted to dress as a woman.” Id. at 135:24-136:1.
Given the testimonial admissions of Rost, there is no material
dispute that Stephens was terminated because she did not conform to
Rost’s gender stereotypes, and summary judgment in favor of the
Commission as to the termination claim is appropriate.
In addition, the Defendant has maintained a discriminatory
clothing-allowance policy which until October 2014 provided suits and
ties to male employees who interacted with the public and nothing to
similarly situated females. Since October 2014, female employees have
been given an annual stipend of either $75 or $150, but this is still
inferior to that accorded to men, both in dollar value and in flexibility, as
the men can replace suits as needed. Thus, summary judgment is also
appropriate as to this issue.
B.

The Affirmative Defenses

After eight months of litigation—including a Motion to Dismiss and
an initial Answer to the Complaint—Defendant injected new defenses.
Only after the Commission filed an Amended Complaint, which merely
2

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 17 of 50

Pg ID 607

corrected the spelling of the Charging Party’s first name, Defendant first
asserted that its termination of Stephens was protected by the Free
Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1 (“RFRA”). See Dkt. 22, Answer to
Amended Complaint, p. 5 (Affirmative Defenses 12-13).
Defendant admits it discharged Stephens because she did not
conform to the masculine gender stereotypes that Rost expected of her.
That is sex discrimination. Yet, Defendant asserts that its religious
beliefs have been burdened by Aimee Stephens’s Title VII right to not be
subject to gender stereotypes in the workplace.
That argument misconstrues both the Free Exercise Clause and
RFRA. Controlling Supreme Court precedent makes clear that the Free
Exercise Clause does not excuse compliance with a neutral and generally
applicable law such as Title VII. Moreover, Defendant has identified no
religious exercise that is substantially burdened, as is required to invoke
RFRA. Even if Defendant had done so, courts have consistently
recognized that preventing employment discrimination is a compelling
government interest, which also takes this matter outside of RFRA’s
3

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 18 of 50

Pg ID 608

scope. Because there are no material facts in dispute, summary
judgment in favor of the Commission is appropriate on Affirmative
Defenses 12 and 13.
C.

Thomas Rost Limits His Religious Exercise.

Thomas Rost owns 94.5% of the shares of Defendant and was the
sole decision-maker who terminated Stephens’s employment. Ex. B, Rost
30(b)(6) Dep. at 26:20-26:24; 117:23-118:6 . Rost testified as to
Defendant’s religion-based affirmative defenses. Ex. C, Notice of 30(b)(6)
Deposition, and Ex. B at 6:14-10:3. Defendant’s religious exercises are
those of Rost. Ex. B at 29:1-7.
Rost is a Christian. Id. at 29:20-22. He attends two churches with
some regularity. Id. at 29:25-30:1-6. However, the evidence shows that
Rost’s exercise of his religious beliefs at or through RGGR is limited to
the placement of (1) “Daily Bread” devotional books and (2) cards bearing
the name of Jesus with New Testament verses on the back.

which is a little daily devotional; it's a pick
up. We have a little card that people can pick
up. That would be the only thing.
Okay. And this is just -- as they walk out
they can grab something like that?
Yes. It's a pick up item if they so desire.
What about, you say a little card, what's that?
We call it a Jesus card.
Okay.
I forgot what it says on the front. It's kind
of to grab your attention and then on the back
it just has references, verse references.
Scriptural references about Jesus?
Yes, exactly. Yes.

Id. at 39:23-40:17; Ex. D (Daily Bread Devotional); and Ex. E (Jesus
card). These publications were placed on a credenza or desk at the entry
place for each location for visitors to take or leave as they desire. Ex. B,
Ex. B at 39:14-40:17.
Rost admitted that continuing to employ Stephens would not have
interfered with these religious practices at RGGR. Id. at 57:2-19.
D.

RGGR does not operate as a religious enterprise.

Defendant is not affiliated with or part of any church. Id. at
31:15-31:19. Rost employs people from different denominations and of no
religious beliefs at all. Id. at 40:18-41; Ex. F, Shaffer Dep. at 33:10-12. He
admits that employing individuals with beliefs different from his own
5

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 20 of 50

Pg ID 610

does not constitute an endorsement of their beliefs or activities by
RGGR. Ex. B at 41:20-42:18. He does not impose his own beliefs on
employees, stating that he would not, for example, terminate an
employee because he or she had sex outside of marriage, had an abortion,
or committed adultery. Id. at 138:2-138:16.
The Defendant’s articles of incorporation do not avow any religious
purpose. Ex. R, Articles of Incorporation at p. 6. There are no religious
views or values that employees are expected to uphold. Ex. B at 81:18-21.
RGGR’s website contains a “mission statement” which makes two
references to God, the second of which is a passage in the Gospel of
Matthew (Ex. G), which Rost chose because he liked it. Ex. B at
85:7-85:21. And the Defendant’s employees do not regard RGGR as a
Christian business enterprise. See, e.g., Ex. H, Nesmith Dep. at
19:18-20:4; Ex. I, Kish Dep. at 55:10-55:25.
Defendant is open 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, and Easter
is not a paid holiday. Ex. B at 88:20-89:21. It serves clients of every
religion (various Christian denominations, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish,
native Chinese religions) or those of no religious affiliation. Ex. J, Cash
6

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 21 of 50

Pg ID 611

Dep. at 41:19-42:10; Ex. K, Crawford Dep. at 32:18-34:9; Ex. B at
33:19-36:23. Indeed, employees have been known to wear Jewish head
coverings when holding a Jewish funeral service. Ex. K at 34:20-35:4; Ex.
J at 42:7-12. The business keeps Catholic religious items (crucifixes,
kneelers, candles) in storage until requested by Catholic (or occasionally
non-Catholic) clients. Ex. L, Matthew Rost Dep. at 36:20-25; Ex. J at
42:19-25; Ex. H at 26:1-10; Ex. K at 34:20-35:11; Ex. F at 34:16-35:10; Ex.
M, McKie Dep at 29:12-25; 31:11-14.
While the rooms where funerals are held on site are called
“chapels,” they are decorated to look like living rooms and are not
decorated with visible religious fixtures. Ex. B at 84:2-85:6. This is done
deliberately to avoid offending people of different religions. Id. Although
some of the chapels have statues of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary,
these are kept hidden behind curtains unless a Catholic service is being
held. Ex. J at 53:7-16; Ex. M at 29:16-25.
As far as presenting itself to the outside world, Defendant has not
advertised in Christian publications or church bulletins in more than
twenty years, with one exception. Ex. B at 37:25-38:9. The one exception
7

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 22 of 50

Pg ID 612

is a small advertisement in a Catholic parish’s festival publication that
Rost regards as a “gift.” Id. at 39:2-13.
RGGR does not sponsor publications which call people to join the
Christian faith or celebrate Christian holidays. Id. at 31:20-32:2; 39:2-16.
There are no prayer groups or Bible studies at RGGR. Ex. J at 47:8-16;
Ex. N, Kowalewski Dep. at 30:11-12; Ex. H at 19:18-24; Ex. I, Kish Dep.
at 55:10-20; Ex. M at 27:8-15. RGGR does not have any religion-based
exclusions to employee medical coverage, such as refusing to pay for
abortions. Ex. B at 92:17-93:20.
Significantly, Rost admitted that the business climate causes him
to act against his religious ideals: the practice of cremation instead of
holding a funeral. His Christian beliefs align him toward performing
funerals. Id. at 51:22. However, the industry has changed, with a
growing preference for cremations, and he needs to do them to stay in
business. Id. at 52:14-53:10.
E.

Rost’s religious beliefs about men and women
motivated him to fire Stephens.

Rost’s religious beliefs—not a religious exercise—led him to
terminate Stephens’s employment after she presented her transition
8

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 23 of 50

Pg ID 613

letter. When asked what was objectionable to him about continuing to
employ Aimee Stephens, Rost stated that transgender expression
violated his beliefs regarding proper behavior by men and women:
Q So, your personal faith as a follower of Jesus
22
Christ tells you that it would be improper
23
or -- to employ someone like the person you
24
knew as Anthony Stephens?
25 A Absolutely.

employ Stephens?
5 A I believe it would violate my faith, yes,

absolutely.
7 Q Okay. What aspects of it?
8 A Well, I believe that God created a man as a man
9
and God created a woman as a woman. And to -10
to not honor that, I would feel it's a
11
violation of my faith, absolutely.
12 Q So Stephens would be presenting in a way that
13
offended your religious beliefs, essentially?
14 A Yes. Yes.
Ex. B at 54:21-55:19. Later, under questioning by his own attorney, Rost
re-affirmed that Stephens’s non-conformance with his beliefs regarding
the behavior of men and women prompted the firing decision. Compare
the above with Id. at 135:24-136:3 (“[the specific reason Stephens was
fired] was [that Stephens was] no longer going to represent himself as a

man. He wanted to dress as a woman”).
Rost also testified that he objected to Stephens’s use of “Aimee” in
the charge of discrimination, saying that this made him
“uncomfortable….because he’s [Stephens] a man.” Ex. O, Rost Dep. at
23:4-8.

Defendant’s Clothing-Allowance Policy

Defendant provides a different clothing allowance to its male and
female employees. Id. at 24:8-25; Ex. I, Kish Dep. at 16:13–19:5. This
dress code requires female employees to wear a suit jacket, skirt, and
blouse. Ex. O at 24:8-25; Ex. I at 16:15-17:7. Male employees, including
funeral directors, must wear a suit jacket, suit pants, white dress shirt,
and tie. Ex. O at 13:4-21; Ex. I at 17:8-24.
For male employees who have contact with customers, Defendant
provides nearly all work attire free of charge. Approximately 10 years
ago, Defendant made an arrangement with a local clothier—Sam
Michael’s—to pay for suit jackets, suit pants, and ties for the male
employees. Immediately upon hire of a full-time male, Defendant pays
for two suit jackets, two suit pants, and two ties from Sam Michael’s. Ex.
10

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 25 of 50

Pg ID 615

O at 14:9-19. For part-time males, Defendant pays for one suit jacket,
one suit pant, and one tie. Id. These clothing benefits also include
tailoring of the suit jackets and pants (Ex. I at 19:20-24) and repairs to
the suit as needed (Ex. O at 19:2-24). Moreover, replacement suit jackets,
suit pants, and ties are provided on an as-needed basis, which, on
average, is every year or sometimes more often. Ex. K at 19:1-3; Ex. J at
21:4-8; Ex. F at 44:3-15; Ex. N at 22:21-23:1.
No work-clothing benefits were provided to any female employees
until late 2014. Ex. O at 15:16-16:12; Ex. I at 20:16–21:3; Ex. P, Clothing
Allowance Checks; Ex. M at 42:1-4; Ex. H at 13:5–14:4. Beginning in
October 2014, Defendant began to provide female employees who have
customer contact an annual clothing stipend. Ex. I at 20:16–21:23; Ex. P.
The amount depends on the employee’s status: full-time females are
given $150 per year and part-time women receive $75 per year. Ex. I at
20:16-21:23. Defendant acknowledges, however, that the attire it
provides to its male employees costs Defendant approximately $235
(part-time) to $470 (full-time) per employee. Ex. O at 15:3-6. Defendant
also acknowledges that it based the amount of clothing allowance for its
11

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 26 of 50

Pg ID 616

female employees on what it determined was “fair,” rather than the
amount it paid for its male employees’ clothes. Id. at 45:12-20.
Furthermore, unlike Defendant’s male employees who receive their
clothing benefits immediately upon hire, Defendant’s female employees
are required to wait until the next clothing allowance checks are issued
for all female employees. Ex. I at 25:11-15, 38:15-25.

RELEVANT LAW
A.

Rule 56 Standard

Summary judgment is only appropriate where the record reveals
there are no issues of material fact in dispute. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). The moving party bears the burden of
“clearly and convincingly” demonstrating the absence of any genuine
disputes of material fact. Sims v. Memphis Processors, Inc., 926 F.2d 524
(6th Cir. 1991) (citing Kochins v. Linden-Ailmak, Inc., 799 F.2d 1128,
1133 (6th Cir. 1986)). If Plaintiff meets this burden, the Defendant is
required to present significant probative evidence showing that genuine,
material disputes remain. Sims, 926 F.2d at 526.

First Amendment Free Exercise Standard

The standard for review of a free-exercise claim is well-established:
a religious objector to legislative enactments must comply with neutral
laws of general applicability. Mt. Elliott Cemetery Ass’n. v City of Troy,
171 F.3d 398, 403 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting Employment Division v.
Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990)).
To determine whether a law is neutral and of general applicability,
the Sixth Circuit asks if the object of the law is to target practices
because of their religious motivation:
A law is not neutral if the object of the law, whether overt or
hidden, is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their
religious motivation. See [Church of the] Lukumi Babalu [, Aye, Inc.
v. City of Hialeah,] 508 U.S. 520, 535 (1993).
The requirement that the law be of general applicability protects
against unequal treatment which results when a legislature
decides that the governmental interests it seeks to advance are
worthy of being pursued only against conduct with a religious
motivation.
Mt. Elliott Cemetery Ass’n., 171 F.3d at 405.
Ultimately, if a religious person is being treated the same as a
non-religious person under a valid and neutral law of general
applicability, there is no free-exercise violation. See Hansen v. Ann Arbor

Pub. Schools, 293 F. Supp. 2d 780, 809 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (where no
students were permitted to comment at a school panel on homosexuality,
free-exercise rights of religious student were not violated).
C.

RFRA Standard

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) prohibits the
government from substantially burdening the exercise of religion unless
the government demonstrates that the burden is in furtherance of a
compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of
furthering that interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–1(a), (b).
The standard for analyzing a RFRA claim is a two-step process:
First, the plaintiff must make out a prima facie case by
establishing Article III standing and showing that the law in
question would (1) substantially burden (2) a sincere (3) religious
exercise. If the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, it falls to the
government to demonstrate[ ] that application of the burden to the
person (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;
and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling
governmental interest . The government carries the burdens of
both production and persuasion when it seeks to justify a
substantial burden on a sincere religious practice.
Michigan Catholic Conf. v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372, 383 (6th Cir. 2014),
vacated and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 1914; affirmed after remand, 807 F.3d

Determining whether or not the government has substantially burdened
an exercise of religion is a question of law. Id. at 385. Further, “[a]
substantial burden exists when government action puts substantial
pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his
beliefs.” Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008)
(quoting Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 717, 718 (1981)).
III. ARGUMENTS
A.

The Commission Has Not Violated Defendant’s FreeExercise rights.

Defendant alleges in Affirmative Defense 12 that the EEOC’s
claims violate RGGR’s free exercise rights, but that cannot be: the
Defendant did not put the Commission on notice that religious exercise
issues were involved until it filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint
in June 2015. Rost admits that he did not raise such defenses during the
EEOC’s investigation of Stephens’s charge of discrimination. Ex. B at
70:7-71:17; 141:2-142:15. Thus, the lawsuit could not have been
formulated with any anti-religious motive in mind.
Even if the defense were construed to be an attack on Title VII,
which it does not seem to be, Defendant’s claim would be unsuccessful
15

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 30 of 50

Pg ID 620

under the Free Exercise Clause. Title VII is a neutral law of general
applicability. 1 See General Tel. Co. of the Northwest, Inc. v. EEOC, 446
U.S. 318, 326 (1980) (there is a public interest in preventing
employment discrimination ). Title VII applies equally to all employers
with 15 or more employees regardless of religious status—including
Defendant. See Dkt. 22 at paragraphs 5-6 (admitting that Defendant is
an employer for the purposes of Title VII).
A free-exercise claim cannot insulate an employer from liability
under Title VII, and no court has so held. See EEOC v. Townley
Engineering & Mfg. Co., 859 F.2d 610, 620-21 (9th Cir. 1988)
(elimination of mandatory attendance requirement for corporate prayer
meetings to accommodate the Title VII rights of a non-religious employee
did not violate Defendant’s free exercise rights). In another religious
claim involving Title VII enforcement, the court held that an
investigation and subsequent lawsuit did not infringe upon a business
owner’s religious practices. See EEOC v. Preferred Mgmt. Corp., 216 F.
Supp. 2d 763, 810 (S.D. Ind. 2002) (even assuming the effect of EEOC’s
Far from being intended to infringe upon religion, Title VII protects the
convictions of religious institutions by allowing them to restrict
employment to those of their own faith. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–1(a).

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 31 of 50

Pg ID 621

investigation and litigation were to force conformance to Title VII’s
strictures against using religious criteria to make employment decisions,
such would not “substantially burden” owner’s religious beliefs or
practices).
Consequently, summary judgment in favor of the Commission is
proper as to Defendant’s free-exercise defense set forth in Affirmative
Defense 12.
B.

Defendant’s RFRA defense should be rejected.
1.

The Commission does not contest Defendant’s religious
sincerity.

Defendant’s religious exercise is limited—much more than the
religious practices of other plaintiffs in RFRA disputes. See, e.g., Hobby
Lobby v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1122 (10th Cir. 2013), aff’d sub nom
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014) (describing
the evangelical activity, religious principles and actions demonstrated by
the two plaintiff corporations). And the Defendant here gave no
indication that its religious beliefs were being violated until litigation
had been underway for nearly eight and a half months. Nevertheless, for
the purposes of this motion, the Commission will not contest the
17

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 32 of 50

Pg ID 622

sincerity of Defendant’s religious views.
2.

Defendant’s Religious Exercise at RGGR is Not Affected
by Title VII Enforcement.

There is nothing about enforcement of Title VII that will interfere
with Rost’s religious exercises at Defendant. RFRA protects religious
exercise, not simply beliefs. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(1)(a)) In particular,
RFRA does not protect Mr. Rost from having his religious beliefs
offended. The Commission is not requesting that Defendant endorse
Stephens’s transition or otherwise affirm something to which Rost
objects.
In Wilson v. James, __ F. Supp .3d __, 2015 WL 5952109 (D.D.C.
2015), the plaintiff, a member of the Utah National Guard, was
reprimanded after he sent an email using a military account objecting to
a same-sex marriage ceremony held in the Cadet Chapel at West Point.
The plaintiff sued under RFRA, claiming that he was being punished for
his beliefs. However, the district court rejected the RFRA claim, noting
that a burden on beliefs was different from a burden on the exercise of
those beliefs:
A substantial burden on one’s religious beliefs—as distinct from
18

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 33 of 50

Pg ID 623

such a burden on one’s exercise of religious beliefs—does not violate
RFRA. [H]ere, Plaintiff has not identified any burdened action or
practice of the LDS faith. The discipline imposed did not “force[
him] to engage in conduct that [his] religion forbids” or “prevent[
him] from engaging in conduct [his] religion requires,” Henderson
v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 16 (D.C.Cir.2001). Nor did it “condition[ ]
receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by [his]
religious faith, or ... den[y] such a benefit because of conduct
mandated by [his] belief,” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind.
Employment Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717–18, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67
L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). Nothing prevented Plaintiff from continuing to
maintain his beliefs about same-sex marriage and homosexuality,
just as he had before the [reprimand], without repercussion.
Wilson, 2015 WL 5952109 at *8.
Similarly, in McKnight v. MTC, 2015 WL 7730995 (N.D. Tex. Nov.
9, 2015), a prisoner filed a claim under the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc–1, et seq.,2 alleging
that his religious freedom rights had been violated by the placement of a
homosexual cellmate in his cell. In the absence of any claim that the
plaintiff’s religious exercise had been changed, the court held that the
claim was without merit:
Here, Plaintiff has pled no facts tending to show that Defendants'
refusal to accommodate his housing request “put a substantial
pressure on him to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.”
RLUIPA claims are evaluated under the same standard as RFRA
claims. See Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 860 (2015).

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 34 of 50

Pg ID 624

Jehovah [v. Clarke], 798 F.3d [169 (4th Cir. 2015)] at 180–181
(quotations and quoted case omitted). Plaintiff relies instead on
conclusory statements that sharing a cell with a homosexual
inmate is against his conscience and “religious obligation to honor
God.” … Thus, Plaintiff's allegations suggest that he takes issue
only with the exposure to a homosexual cellmate, and not with any
effect it has on his religious activities. Indeed, his filings do not
identify any religious exercise apart from mentioning very general
tenets of his religion to “honor God” and maintain his “human
dignity.”
McKnight, 2015 WL 7730995 at *4.
The facts are similar here: Rost avers that his obligation to honor
God obliges him to fire Stephens, who does not act as Rost’s beliefs
dictate she should. In other words, the mere presence of and exposure to
Stephens offends his beliefs. See Ex. T, Def’s Answers to Plaintiff’s First
Set of Discovery Requests at p. 4 (“Stephens[‘s] intentions also violated
Mr. Ros[t]’s sincerely held religious beliefs”). However, this is not
sufficient to sustain a RFRA claim.
Significantly, Defendant is still able to engage in the religious
activities identified by Rost—the placement of devotionals and cards for
the public—regardless of whether or not one of its employees happens to
violate Rost’s religion-based gender stereotypes. Thus, Rost’s religious
exercises are not affected by the presence or employment of Stephens.
20

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 35 of 50

Pg ID 625

The mere fact that Rost thinks Stephens’s continued employment
violates his religious beliefs is legally insufficient under RFRA.
3.

Enforcement of Title VII does not substantially burden
Defendant.

Even if Defendant identifies a religious exercise that has been
burdened, RFRA requires a “substantial burden” and such is a question
of law for the Court. “RFRA is not a mechanism to advance a generalized
objection to a governmental policy choice, even if it is one sincerely based
upon religion.” Michigan Cath. Conf. v. Burwell, 807 F.3d 738 (6th Cir.
2015) (Burwell II) (affirming Burwell I):
But a government action does not constitute a substantial burden
on the exercise of religion even if “the challenged Government
action would interfere significantly with private persons’ ability to
pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own religious beliefs”
if the governmental action does not coerce the individuals to violate
their religious beliefs or deny them the “rights, benefits, and
privileges enjoyed by other citizens.” Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery
Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439, 449, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534
(1988).
Id., 755 F.3d at 384 (6th Cir. 2014).
Here, RGGR cannot establish a substantial burden. As stated
before, there is no burdened exercise. Further, the Commission is not
asking Rost to adopt a different belief about transgender people, and
21

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 36 of 50

Pg ID 626

Rost has already admitted that employing people with religious beliefs
different from his own does not constitute an endorsement of the
employee’s religious views.
Likewise, continued employment of Aimee Stephens does not
constitute an endorsement of any religious view. As Justice O’Connor
stated in a concurring opinion:
A statute outlawing employment discrimination based on race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin has the valid secular purpose
of assuring employment opportunity to all groups in our pluralistic
society. Since Title VII calls for reasonable rather than absolute
accommodation and extends that requirement to all religious
beliefs and practices rather than protecting only the Sabbath
observance, I believe an objective observer would perceive it as an
anti-discrimination law rather than an endorsement of religion or a
particular religious practice.”
Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 711-712 (1985).
Instead, in this case, the EEOC has filed suit in an effort to create a
workplace free of gender discrimination for a qualified funeral director
and embalmer. Since no employer can discharge people for reasons
grounded in sexual stereotypes, the Defendant is not being denied any
right, benefit or privilege granted to an employer who does not share its
views. Further, Commission investigations and lawsuits under Title VII
22

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 37 of 50

Pg ID 627

are not a substantial burden under RFRA. In EEOC v. Preferred Mgmt.
Corp., 216 F. Supp. 2d 763 (S.D. Ind. 2002), the Commission investigated
and sued an employer under Title VII for alleged religious discrimination
against employees and applicants who did not share the fundamentalist
Christian views of the Defendant’s management. Both the investigation
and lawsuit involved extensive and searching examination of the
religious viewpoints of the Defendant’s decision-makers and employees.
See Preferred, 216 F. Supp. 2d at 772-803. The defendant in Preferred
objected to this process, claiming that it violated its rights under RFRA
and the First Amendment. Id. at 804-805. The court held that neither
the 2½-year investigation (which included 24 depositions) nor the
litigation itself constituted a substantial burden on the religious rights of
the employer. Id. at 807-809, 810.
Here, because the Defendant chose not to assert them, the
Commission was entirely unaware of any potential religious issues
during the investigation. Thus, there can be no claim of a substantial
burden from the investigation. As to the litigation itself, Defendant
injected religion into the matter, so the Commission properly probed the
23

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 38 of 50

Pg ID 628

religious claims at stake.
Therefore, as a matter of law, it should be held that Defendant’s
rights have not been substantially burdened by this action.
4.

Enforcement of Title VII here furthers a compelling
governmental interest in eradicating sex discrimination
and is precisely tailored to further that interest.

To the Commission’s knowledge, there is no case law holding that
RFRA trumps Title VII. To the contrary, the Supreme Court suggested
in a colloquy between the principal dissent and the majority opinion in
Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. 2751, that Title VII serves a compelling
governmental interest which cannot be overridden by RFRA. While
dealing with a matter far removed from the dispute here, the discussion
is worth quoting in full.
In Burwell, the principal dissent expressed concerns about RFRA
being used to trump laws regarding accommodation and hiring,
especially in the context of sex-based hiring decisions informed by
religion. See Burwell at 2804-2805 (Ginsberg, J., dissenting).
In response, the majority opinion emphasized that
anti-discrimination laws with respect to hiring would not be trumped by
24

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 39 of 50

Pg ID 629

RFRA:
The principal dissent raises the possibility that discrimination in
hiring, for example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as
religious practice to escape legal sanction. See post, at 2804 – 2805.
Our decision today provides no such shield. The Government has a
compelling interest in providing an equal opportunity to
participate in the workforce without regard to race, and
prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to
achieve that critical goal.
Id. at 2783. Title VII’s prohibitions against sex discrimination in the
workplace demonstrate that the government has a compelling interest in
protecting employees from losing their jobs on the basis of an employer’s
gender stereotyping, and they are precisely tailored to ensure this.
Ultimately, the concurring opinion stated the balance most clearly
in the employment context:
Among the reasons the United States is so open, so tolerant, and so
free is that no person may be restricted or demeaned by
government in exercising his or her religion. Yet neither may that
same exercise unduly restrict other persons, such as employees, in
protecting their own interests, interests the law deems compelling.
Id. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J., concurring).
Even if Title VII burdens a religious practice, there “is a
‘compelling government interest’ in creating such a burden: the
eradication of employment discrimination based on the criteria
25

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 40 of 50

Pg ID 630

identified in Title VII[.]” Preferred Mgmt., 216 F. Supp. 2d at 810.
In the final analysis, Thomas Rost is free to exercise his Christian
religious beliefs, but he is not free to take away Aimee Stephens’s
livelihood in the process. Nor is he able to excuse his actions under the
cloak of religious freedom. Neither the Constitution nor RFRA authorize
the firing of Stephens. To the contrary, Rost’s admissions warrant entry
of judgment in favor of the Commission.
C.

Summary Judgment as to liability for Stephens’s
gender-motivated termination is warranted.

Title VII violations can be established through either
circumstantial or direct evidence. “Direct evidence of discrimination is
that evidence which, if believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful
discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer’s
actions.” Wexler v. White’s Fine Furniture, Inc., 317 F.3d 564, 570 (6th
Cir. 2003). Rost admits that his sex-based stereotypes motivated
Stephens’s termination. Ex. B at 135:24-136:3. And this constitutes an
admission of discrimination. Thus, the Commission respectfully requests
that summary judgment as to liability for Stephens’s termination be
entered in favor of the Plaintiff.
26

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 41 of 50

Pg ID 631

As this Court discussed in its Amended Opinion & Order Denying
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 13), an employer discriminates on
the basis of sex when it fires an employee for failing to conform to the
employer’s notions of the employee’s sex. See Price Waterhouse v.
Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 239 (1989) (sexual stereotyping claim based on,
among other things, instruction to plaintiff to wear jewelry and dress
more femininely); Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S.
75, 79 (1998) (“statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to
cover reasonably comparable evils”). Here, there is no material dispute of
fact regarding motivation. Rost has frankly and forthrightly stated his
motivation for firing Stephens in no uncertain terms—that Stephens was
a man and had to present as one. Ex. B at 135:24-136:3.
In Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 575 (6th Cir. 2004), the
Sixth Circuit explained that an employer violates Title VII when it takes
action against an employee based on “[s]ex stereotyping,” that is, “based
on a person’s gender non-conforming behavior.” This includes penalizing
an employee for dress or mannerisms that, in the employer’s mind,
conform to the wrong sex stereotypes. See also Myers v. Cuyahoga Cty.,
27

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 42 of 50

Pg ID 632

182 Fed. Appx. 510, 519 (6th Cir. 2006) (“Title VII protects transsexual
persons from discrimination for failing to act in accordance and/or
identify with their perceived sex or gender”) (citing Smith and Barnes);
Fabian v. Hospital of Central Connecticut, No. 3:12-cv-1154, __F. Supp.
3d __, 2016 WL 1089178 at *10-13 (D. Conn. March 18, 2016) (following
inter alia, Title VII’s plain language, Price Waterhouse and Smith and
discussing the development of the case law).
Thus, an employee who alleges that failure to conform to sex
stereotypes concerning how a man or woman should look and behave was
the “driving force” behind the employer’s adverse employment actions
“state[s] a claim for relief pursuant to Title VII’s prohibition of sex
discrimination.” Smith, 378 F.3d at 575. In particular, an employer may
not fire a transgender woman for failing to comport with the employer’s
gender expectations. Such an act is discrimination “because of … sex,”
which Title VII prohibits.
RGGR fired Stephens because she did not conform to its
expectations of how someone assigned the male sex at birth should look

Q
A

Pg ID 633

[Defense Counsel] Okay. Why did you -- what was the specific
reason that you terminated Stephens?
Well, because he -- he was no longer going to
represent himself as a man. He wanted to dress
as a woman.

Ex. B at 135:24-136:1. Rost also admits that Stephens’s termination was
not motivated by any performance reasons. Id. at 108:25-109:9.
Stephens intended to provide the same level of services to the
Respondent as she had always provided. And she still intended to dress
professionally, in a manner consistent with the Respondent’s dress
requirements for women. Ex. Q, Stephens Dep. at 133:6-133:9. In other
words, she still intended to meet all of the Respondent’s legitimate
business expectations. Therefore, RGGR discriminated against Stephens
based on its gender stereotypes, in contravention of Smith. Ex. B at
55:8-55:9 (“Well, I believe that God created a man as a man and God
created a woman as a woman.”). As the Sixth Circuit noted in Smith,
Price Waterhouse states that Title VII forbids discrimination based on
the employer’s notions of how a male or female should look or act. See
378 F.3d at 572-73.
Because the Commission can establish direct evidence of
29

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 44 of 50

Pg ID 634

discrimination, the Court need not proceed to the second step of the
traditional McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis for cases
proceeding under a circumstantial evidence theory. Even if the Court
considers RGGR’s dress code a possible defense, RGGR’s argument fails
for two reasons: RGGR’s dress code is not a legitimate,
non-discriminatory reason for terminating Stephens, and even if it were
non-discriminatory, the dress code is a pretext, not the real reason
RGGR fired Stephens.
RGGR is likely to cite a string of cases allegedly standing for the
proposition that sex-specific dress codes do not violate Title VII. See Dkt.
7 at Pg ID 38-40. However, as this Court already recognized, this is not
the Commission’s allegation in the lawsuit. See Dkt. 13 at Pg ID 197
(“Here, however, the EEOC’s complaint does not assert any claims based
upon a dress code and it does not contain any allegations as to a dress
code at the Funeral Home”). The Commission is not asserting that
RGGR’s dress code violates Title VII—rather the violation is RGGR’s
insistence that Stephens dress in accord with Rost’s gender stereotypes.
Stephens’s gender identity is female, and she was prepared to abide by
30

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 45 of 50

Pg ID 635

RGGR’s female dress code. Ex. Q, Stephens Dep. at 133:6-9. RGGR’s
desire to force her to present as a male at work evidences the exact
sex-based consideration that establishes RGGR terminated Stephens
because of her sex.
RGGR claims that if it cannot force Stephens to dress inconsistent
with her gender identity, sex specific dress codes would be “effectively
invalidate[d].” Dkt. 7 at Pg ID 40-42. RGGR’s argument misses the mark
because Stephens fully intended to abide by the female dress code—and
to continue to dress in a professional manner at work.
RGGR claims that employers will not be “able to any longer control
how its employees and agents appear to the public.” Dkt. 7 at Pg ID 41.
This is unworthy of credence. RGGR can require its employees to dress
professionally and appropriately. What RGGR cannot require is that an
employee dress inconsistently with his or her gender identity. It is
RGGR’s insistence that it could require Stephens to present
inconsistently with her gender identity—but consistently with RGGR’s
stereotypes for how she should dress—that establishes that RGGR
terminated Stephens for violating its gender-based expectations. Such
31

employer action violates Title VII.
D.

Defendant’s Clothing-Allowance Policy Constitutes
Sex-Based Discrimination.

Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to “to discriminate
against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . .
sex . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Defendant’s policy of paying for the
work clothing of male employees, while failing to provide a comparable
benefit to female employees violates Title VII.
As clarified by the EEOC Guidelines on Discrimination Because of
Sex, “fringe benefits” are encompassed by the language in §
2000e-2(a)(1). 29 C.F.R. §1604.9(a)–(b). Federal courts have also
recognized various allowances, including work-clothing-related
allowances, as being fringe benefits under Title VII. See Laffey v.
Northwest Airlines, Inc., 567 F.2d 429, 443, 453–56 (D.C. Cir. 1976)
(upholding lower court’s finding that providing a uniform-cleaning
allowance to only the male employees, but not female employees,
constituted a violation under Title VII); Long v. Ringling
Brothers-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, 9 F.3d 340, 343–44 (4th
32

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 47 of 50

Pg ID 637

Cir. 1993) (finding genuine issues of material fact in a Title VII case
involving a claim of fringe benefits, which included allowances for meals,
laundry and valet services, and life and health insurances).
Thus, Defendant’s practice of providing fringe benefits only to men
in the form of free work clothing violated Title VII.
Even now, although Defendant provides female employees with a
yearly clothing allowance of $75 to $150, this is significantly less than
the clothing benefits in excess of $200 provided to male employees, and is
less flexible, since women can only obtain it on a pre-determined
schedule and even part-time male employees can replace clothing at
need as it wears out or is damaged.
Specifically, RGGR permits its male employees to receive their
clothing benefits immediately upon hire and they can replace soiled or
damaged clothes as needed, also at no cost. In contrast, Defendant’s
female employees are required to wait until the next clothing allowance
checks are issued for all female employees before they receive their
clothing allowance. As a consequence, Defendant has only lessened, but
not eliminated, its discrimination against female employees. Hence, it
33

2:14-cv-13710-SFC-DRG Doc # 51 Filed 04/07/16 Pg 48 of 50

Pg ID 638

continues to violate Title VII and is liable for damages for discrimination
on the basis of sex. Thus, summary judgment is appropriate as to the
clothing-allowance claim as well.
IV.

CONCLUSION
There is no factual dispute that Thomas Rost discharged Aimee

Stephens because she refused to conform to his sex-based stereotypes
and present as a man. Rost has forthrightly admitted this, and more
than once. Moreover, his religious beliefs regarding transgender persons
do not excuse him from his duty as an employer to respect Aimee
Stephens’s Title VII rights. No case has held that either the First
Amendment or RFRA trumps or voids employee discrimination claims.
Further, Defendant has and continues to provide inferior clothing
allowance benefits to female employees. This, too, is not a matter of
dispute. Consequently, summary judgment in favor of the Commission is
appropriate as to both of the claims at issue in this lawsuit, and the
Commission respectfully requests that the Court grant its motion as to
liability and the matter proceed as to the calculation of damages
Respectfully submitted,
